Study Title
A Phase 3, Double-blind, Randomized Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of 
Luspatercept (ACE-536) Versus Placebo for the Treatment of Anemia Due to IPSS-R Very Low, 
Low, or Intermediate Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes in Subjects with Ring Sideroblasts Who Require Red Blood Cell Transfusions
Indication
Treatment of anemia due to very low, low, or  intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes 
(MDS) according to the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) in subjects 
with ring sideroblasts who requi re red blood cell (RBC) transfusions
Objectives
The primary objective is:
!To evaluate RBC transfusion independence (RBC-TI) of luspatercept compared with 
placebo for the treatment of anemia due to IPSS-R very low, low, or intermediate risk MDS in subjects with ring sideroblasts who require RBC transfusions
The secondary objectives are:
!To assess the safety and tolerability of luspatercept compared with placebo
!To evaluate the effect of luspatercept on re duction in RBC transfusions, increase in 
hemoglobin, duration of RBC-TI, improvement in h ealth-r elated quality of life (HRQoL)
(ie, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life 
Questionnaire [EORTC QLQ-C30]), increase in neutrophils, increase in platelets, 
decrease in serum ferritin, decrease in iron chelation therapy use, and time to RBC-TI 
compared with placebo
!To evaluate population pharmacokinetics and exposure-response relationships for 
luspatercept in MDS subjects
Study Design
This is a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, pl acebo-controlled, multicenter study to determine 
the efficacy and safety of luspatercept (ACE-536) versus placebo for the treatment of anemia due 
to IPSS-R very low, low, or intermediate risk  MDS in subjects with ring sideroblasts who require 
RBC transfusions. 
The study is divided into the Screening Period, a double-blind Treatment Period (Primary Phase 
and Extension Phase) and a Posttreatment Follow-up Period.  
The study design is described in detail in Section 3.
The study will be conducted in compliance wi th International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) 
Good Clinical Practices (GCPs).

Confidential and Propri etary 6 ACE-536-MDS-001 Amendment 2.0 Final: 09 May 2017!Experimental Arm - Luspatercept (ACE-536): Starting dose of 1.0 mg/kg subcutaneous 
injection every 3 weeks (administered on Day 1 of each 21-day treatment cycle) 
OR 
!Control Arm: Placebo (volume equivalent to experimental arm) subcutaneous injection 
every 3 weeks (administered on Day 1 of each 21-day treatment cycle). 
After randomization, no crossover between the tr eatment arms will be permitted at any point 
during the study.
Best supportive care may be used in combinatio n with study treatment in both arms when 
clinically indicated per investig ator discretion. See Section 8for more details.  
Stratification will be based on the following factors:
1. RBC Transfusion burden at baseline 
!≥ 6 RBC units/8 weeks (mean of the two consecutive 8-week periods immediately 
prior to randomization)
!< 6 RBC units/8 weeks (mean of the two consecutive 8-week periods immediately 
prior to randomization)
2. IPSS-R at baseline 
!Very low, low
!Intermediate
Primary Phase of the Treatm ent Period: Weeks 1-24
Subjects should receive investig ational product (IP) through at least the first 24 calendar weeks 
unless the subject experiences unacceptable toxicities, withdraws consent, or meets any other
discontinuation criteria (Section 11).
Refer to Section 6.2.1 for additional details related to st udy procedures and assessments during 
the Primary Phase of the Treatment Period.
MDS Disease Assessment: Week 25 Visit 
The Week 25 Visit should be completed 24 calendar weeks after the date of first dose, regardless 
of dose delays.  Because central laboratory results from bone marrow and peripheral blood 
samples are required as part of the MDS Disease Assessment, a 14-day window is allowed for 
the Week 25 Visit.  Please refer to Section 6.2.2 for details.  
In order for subjects to remain on double-blind treatment beyond the first 24 calendar weeks, the 
following criteria must be confirmed upon the completion of the MDS Disease Assessment by 
the investigator at the Week 25 Visit:
!Evidence of clinical benefit (eg, decrease in  RBC transfusion re quirement compared 
to baseline requirement or hemoglobin increase compared to baseline)
AND
!Absence of disease progression per IWG criteria for altering natural history of MDS 
(Cheson, 2006 ; Appendix E ).

Protocol ACE-536-MDS-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 7 ACE-536-MDS-001 Amendment 2.0 Final: 09 May 2017Based on the outcome of the Week 25 Visit MDS Disease Assessment, subjects will either be 
discontinued from treatment with IP and enter the Posttreatment Follow-up Period or continue 
double-blind treatment with IP  in the Extension Phase of the Treatment Period. 
Refer to Section 6.2.2 for additional details related to procedures/assessments.
Extension Phase of the Treatment Period:  After Week 25 Visit
Subjects who meet the criteria for r emaining on double-b lind treatment with IP in the Extension 
Phase may continue dosing on Day 1 of each 21-day treatment cycle until the subject 
experiences unacceptable toxicities, disease progression per IWG criteria for altering natural 
history of MDS ( Cheson, 2006 ; Appendix E ) or withdrawsconsent, or meets any other
discontinuation criteria (Section 11).  
MDS Disease Assessment will be repeated by the investigator at Extension Cycle 8, Day 1 and 
Day 1 of every eighth Extension cycle thereaf ter (ie, Extension Cycle 8, 16, 24+, or every 24 
weeks in the event of dose delays) until the subject is discontinued from IP.
Refer to Section 6.2.3 for additional details related to procedures/assessments.
Posttreatment Follow-up Period:
All subjects discontinued from protocol-prescribed therapy for any reason will be followed for
adverse event (AE)/serious adverse event (SAE) reporting for a period of 42 days after the last 
dose of IP, as well as for SAEs made known to the Investigator at any time thereafter that are 
suspected of being related to IP, as described in Section 10.
For subjects who do not complete the Primary Treatment Phase or do not participate in the 
Extension Phase or subjects who terminate the Extension Phase with less than 1-year of ADA 
monitoring, ADA and PK samples will be collected at End of Treatment (EOT) and then every 12 weeks for up to 1 year from the first dose in the Primary Treatment Phase (please refer to 
Section 6.4and Section 6.5).
Transfusion data collection will continue up until 16 weeks from the date of last dose of IP or the 
EOT Visit (whichever is later).  
Continuation of monitoring for progression to AML and other malignancies/pre-malignancies
(please refer to Section 10.5 for details) will occur in the Posttreatment Follow-up Period along 
with collection of information related to subsequent MDS therapies, and overall survival for at 
least 3 years from the date of last dose of IP un less the subject withdraws consent from the study, 
dies, or is lost to follow-up.  
Refer to Section 6.8for additional details.
Study Population
The study will enroll approximately 210 subjects with IPSS-R ( Greenberg, 2012; Appendix D ) 
very low, low, or intermediate MDS with ring siderobl asts who require RBC transfusions.
Length of Study
The expected duration of the study is a pproximately 5 years which consists of a pproximately 2
years of enrollment, approximately 1 additional year of blinded luspatercept or placebo treatment

posttreatment follow-up period.
The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last subject to complete the 
post-treatment follow-up, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last subject that is required for primary, secondary  analysis, as prespecified in the protocol
and/or SAP, whichever is the later date.  
The Sponsor may end the trial when all key endpoints and objectives of the study have been 
analyzed and the availab ility of a roll-over protocol exists into which any subjects remaining on 
study may be consented and continue to receive access to luspatercept and/or complete long-term 
follow-up. Such a protocol would be written for a compound that would not  yet be commercially 
available.

(placebo).  The sample size calculation is based on one-sided alpha of 0.025, test s tatistics on 
difference of proportions using pool ed estimate of variance and 10% dropout rate. 
The primary efficacy analysis will be the comparison of the response rates in the two treatment 
arms in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. The primary efficacy endpoint of transfusion 
independent response is defined as the absence of any RBC transfusion during any consecutive 
56 day period during the Primary Phase of the Treatment Period.
The Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) test will be used to compare the response rates from 
treatment group and control group with randomization factors as strata. Ka plan–Meier methods 
will be used to characterize the duration of response and survival.
The primary efficacy endpoint will be tested fi rst at the one-sided 0.025 significance level. If 
superiority of luspatercept is demonstrated for the primary efficacy endpoint, then the key 
secondary endpoint will be tested at a one-sided 0.025 significance level. The key secondary endpoint, proportion of subjects achieving RBC-TI with duration ≥ 12 weeks, will be tested in 
the same manner as primary efficacy endpoint using the CMH test.
The analyses for the key secondary endpoint will be based on the ITT population. In order to 
perform hypothesis testing on multiple endpoints while controlling the overall Type I error rate, 
a sequential testing approach will be employed where the order of the endpoints to be tested are 
prespecified.
An interim analysis to assess futility w ill be performed when approximately 105 subjects have 
completed the Primary Phase of the Treatment Period (first 24 weeks of double-blind treatment) 
or discontinued before reaching 24 weeks of double-blind treatment (50% information for primary endpoint). 
Conditional power for the primary endpoint will be calculated assuming the observed trend 
continues for the rest of the data. If it is 10% or less, with confirmative data for secondary and 
other efficacy endpoints, the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) may recommend stopping the 
study for futility.
There is no plan to claim luspatercept superiority based on interim analysis efficacy results, thus
the type one error rate remains at 0.025 one-sided for the final analysis.
The final analysis will be performed when all 210 subjects have completed 48 weeks of 
treatment or discontinued before 48 weeks. 
Additional follow-up analysis for efficacy and safety will be performed when all subjects have 
been followed for at least 3 years from the last dose of IP.

1.1. Disease Background 
Anemia is the predominant cytopenia observed in adult myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and is 
present in approximately 85% of MDS patien ts at the time of diagnosis ( Noel, 1992 ). Anemia in 
MDS can range in severity from mild (asy mptomatic) to severe, requiring re gular RBC 
transfusion support. Of the approximately 80%  to 90% of patients with MDS who develop 
anemia, 40% become transfusion dependent (TD) ( Zeidan, 2013 ).
Lower hemoglobin (Hgb) le vels and red blood cell ( RBC) transfusion-dependence have been 
associated with inferior cardiovascular outcomes and increased mortality in patients with MDS, 
representing a strong rationale for aggressive management of anemia in MDS ( Zeidan, 2013 ). In 
addition, long-term RBC transfusion dependence has other clinical and economic consequences, 
including a potentially negative imp act on health-related qu ality of life  (HRQoL), iron overload, 
and its associated complications, immune-related disorders, and increased risk of infections 
(Hellstrom-Lindberg, 2003; Jansen, 2003; Thomas, 2007 ). Therefore, a therapeutic option that 
would achieve transfusion independence in patients with International Prognostic Scoring System-Revised (IPSS-R) lower-risk MDS for a sustained period of time is an important unmet 
medical need.
Myelodysplastic syndromes are a heterogeneous group of clonal disorders of hematopoietic stem 
cells characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis that manifest clinically as anemia, neutropenia, 
and/or thrombocytopenia of variable severity; these often result in RBC- transfusion dependent 
(TD) anemia, increased risk of infection, and/ or hemorrhage, as well as a potential to progress to 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) ( Adès, 2014; Visconte, 2014; Zeidan, 2013; Brunning, 2008; 
Fenaux, 2009; Steensma, 2013; Catenacci, 2005 ).
For most patients with MDS, anemia and associated transfusion dependency are the most 
prominent clinical problems and the main d eterminants of quality-of-life (QoL) ( Balducci, 2010; 
Chan, 2014; Kao, 2008; Malcovati, 2005; Platzbecker, 2012; Hellström-Lindberg, 2013 ).
1.1.1. Staging and Prognostic Factors 1.1.1.1. Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) for MDS
Patients with MDS can be categorized into 1 of 4 risk groups according to the IPSS (low,
intermediate [Int]-1, Int-2, and high) based on cytogenetics, number of peripheral blood cell 
lineages affected by cytopenia, and bone marrow (BM) blast percentages obtained at diagnosis. 
The 4 risk groups showed significantly different risk of progression to AML and overall survival (OS) ( Greenberg, 1997 ). The median survival rate is 5.7 years for patients with low risk MDS is
as short as 0.4 years for high-risk MDS.
While p roviding insight into the prognostic significance of baseline variables such as percent 
bone marrow blasts and cytogenetics, one of the limitations of the International Prognostic 
Scoring System (IPSS) ( Greenberg, 1997 ) is that it underestimates the impact of cytopenias on 
prognosis for patients with lower-risk disease. The IPSS also underestimates the impact that RBC transfusion dependency has on overall survival and does not adequately assess the impact 
of cytogenetic changes ( Germing, 2012 ).

Confidential and Propri etary 18 ACE-536-MDS-001 Amendment 2.0 Final: 09 May 2017A recent revision of the IPSS (the IPSS-R) provides more discriminatory risk factor assessment 
than the original IPSS for evaluating clinical outcomes (survival duration and time to AML 
evolution) for MDS patients ( Greenberg, 2012 ). Bone marrow cytogenetics, bone marrow blast 
percentage, and cytopenias remain the basis of the IPSS-R, but with further refinement of these 
categories ( Table 1 ). Cytogenetic prognostic subgroups were split into 5 rather than 3 categories 
with the addition of new and specific classif ications of a number of less common cytogenetic 
subsets. Low bone marrow blast percentage was split into 2 categories (ie, ≤ 2% versus > 2% to 
< 5%), and the depth of cytopenias was defined using precise cutpoints. The application of 
additional refinements and prognostic variables in IPSS-R were intended to provide more 
meaningful classifications upon which to assess clinical outcome in MDS patients.

1.1.1.2. Ring Sideroblasts
Early investigators defined ring sideroblasts as having iron granules in a perinuclear distribution 
surrounding the entire nucleus. The definition of a ring sideroblast proposed by the International 
Working Group on Morphology of Myelodysplas tic Syndromes (IWGMDS) (a n erythroblast 
with at least 5 siderotic granules covering at least a third of the circumference of the nucleus) has been incorporated into the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of Tumors of 
Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Ti ssues and for the definition of refractory anemia with ring 
sideroblasts (RARS), the required number of ring sideroblasts is ≥15% ( Mufti, 2008 ).  The 2016 
update to the WHO criteria further expanded on this definition of ring sideroblastic disease by 
also including cases with ring sideroblasts ≥ 5% if SF3B1 mutation is present ( Arber, 2016 ).
It is estimated that approximately 30% of all MDS patients have > 15% of bone marrow 
erythroid precursors being ring sideroblasts. Recently, spliceosome mutations were shown to be 
prevalent in MDS with ring sideroblasts, particul arly mutations involving splicing factor 3B 
subunit 1 (SF3B1). RNA splicing is the most commonly mutated pathway in MDS, and there is strong evidence that mutations in splicing factors occur early in disease evolution. These 
mutations play a major role in determining the clinical features of the disease, with differences in 
morphological features seen on bone marrow biopsy and in leukemia-free survival 
(Papaemmanuil, 2013 ).
Subjects with RS with splicing factor mutations have been shown to have ineffective 
erythropoiesis, possibly related to  defects in iron utilization ( Conte, 2015; del Rey, 2015; 
Dolatshad, 2015 ). Recently, a heterozygous conditional knock-in mouse model has been 
developed with the most frequent K700E mutation of SF3B1 ( Obeng, 2014 ). Ineffective

precursors.
1.1.2. Current Treatment Options for Lower Risk MDS
In lower risk MDS, the risk of AML progression is less and survival is longer, with 
approximately one-half of these elderly patients dying from a cause other than the consequences 
of MDS or AML ( Greenberg, 2012 ). In those patients, the main priority is generally the 
treatment of cytopenias, primarily anemia (usually the predominant cytopenia), and the improvement in quality of life ( Fenaux, 2013 ). A clinically prominent challenge in patients with 
lower-risk MDS is the management of preexisti ng conditions aggravated by anemia, such as 
cardiovascular diseases.
The standard of care for cytopenias remains s upportive treatment with er ythropoiesis-stimulating 
agents (ESAs) such as epoetin alfa or darbepoetin, administration of RBC and/or platelet 
transfusions, infection prophylaxis and/or treatment and use of hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and nutritional supplements when needed 
(Greenberg, 1997; Casadevall, 2004 ). 
1.1.2.1. Revlimid
Revlimid
®(lenalidomide) is approved in the United States (US) for the treatment of patients with 
transfusion-dependent anemia due to low- or Int-1-risk MDS associated with a del (5q) abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. This is the standard of care (in 
those countries where it is approved) for the small proportion of patients with lower risk del-5q 
MDS. In this population, lenalidomide led to transfusion independence for 67% of the patient population and a median duration of transfusion independence of 44 weeks. 
1.1.2.2. Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESAs) Therapy
Erythropoiesis s timulating agents (ie, recombinant eryt hropoietin [EPO] or darbepoetin [DAR]), 
although not currently approved in most countrie s, are commonly used for the treatment of 
anemia in lower-risk MDS without del(5q) cytogenetic abnormality. Major favorable prognostic 
factors for response to ESAs are low or no RBC transfusion requirement (< 2 U per month) and baseline serum EPO level < 500 U/L. ( Fenaux, 2013 ) Responses to ESAs are best in subjects 
with low endogenous levels (eg < 500 U/L) of eryth ropoi etin (EPO), normal blast counts and 
lower IPSS/WHO Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS) scores ( Hellström-Lindberg, 2003; 
Santini, 2011 ).
More recently, the European ESA Scoring System was developed, using a serum EPO level of 
≤200 U/L as a prognostic factor for ESA responsiveness ( Santini, 2013 ). Approximately 70% of 
the relapses of anemia after initial response to ESAs are not associated with progression to 
higher-risk MDS but simply to loss of sensitiv ity of erythroid progenitors to ESAs. Second-line 
treatments in those patients may be different from those required in patients showing concomitant progression to higher-risk MDS ( Fenaux, 2013 ).
1.1.2.3. Red Blood Cell Transfusions 
In many patients with lower-risk MDS, anemia will eventually become resistant to all available 
drug treatments, even in the absence of evolution to higher-risk MDS, and will require repeated

Confidential and Propri etary 20 ACE-536-MDS-001 Amendment 2.0 Final: 09 May 2017RBC transfusions. Frequent RBC transfusions ar e associated with chronic anemia (ie, average 
hemoglobin levels < 10g/dL) which can lead to increased morbidity, especially as a result of 
cardiac failure, falls, fatigue and lower quality of life ( Fenaux, 2013 ). The development of 
transfusion dependency significantly worsens the survival of patients with MDS ( Malcovati, 
2005 ). Long-term RBC transfusion dependence has several detrimental clinical effects including 
iron overload, economic consequences, and a negative impact on patients’ QoL (Hellström-
Lindberg, 2003 ; Jansen, 2003 ; Thomas, 2007 ).
1.1.2.3.1. Iron Chelation Therapy (ICT)
Clinically significant iron overload associated with decreased cardiac function is often observed 
in patients who have received 100 or more RBC units ( Adès, 2014 ). Therefore, iron chelation 
may be required in patients receiving frequent transfusions in order to avoid iron-related cardiac, 
hepatic and endocrine toxicities. Deferoxamine (intramuscular/subcutaneous/intravenous) or 
deferasirox (oral) have been used in MDS patients as a treatment for iron overload ( Messa, 
2010 ). However, deferasirox is fre quently associated with  gastrointestinal side effects and cannot 
be used in patients with renal function impairment ( Fenaux, 2013 ). 
Retrospective studies suggest that when serum ferritin levels exceed 1000 μg/L, in the absence of 
inflammatory or other causes for ferritin elevation, transfusion burden often exceeds the body’s 
capacity to maintain iron bound to transferrin ( Dreyfus, 2008 ). Patients with lower-risk World 
Health Organization (WHO) morphologic categories of refractory anemia (RA) or refractory anemia and with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) who had ferritin levels above 1,000 μg/L 
experienced more cardi ac complications a nd had a reduced overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 
1.51; p < 0.001) ( List, 2010 ). 
Sanz, et al reported that transfusion dependence and iron overload are independent risk factors 
for overall survival and leukemic progression ( Sanz, 2008 ). In their review of 2241 patients 
whose complete transfusion history was available, 835 were transfusion dependent at the time of diagnosis, 526 became transfusion dependent during follow-up, and 880 remained transfusion 
independent ( Sanz, 2008 ). Median survival was significantly shorter in patients who were 
transfusion dependent at diagnosis (19 months) compared with 60 months for those who later became transfusion dependent and 96 months for those who remained transfusion free 
(p < 0.0001). Independent prognostic factors associated with OS in a multivariate analysis 
included iron overload (HR = 52.4; p < 0.0001) and transfusion dependency (HR = 8.8; p < 0.0001) ( Sanz, 2008 ).
Hence, therapeutic options that would achieve transfusion independence (TI) or reduce 
transfusion intensity in patients with lower-risk MDS for a significant amount of time would be highly desirable in terms of reduced requirements for iron chelation therapy.
1.1.2.4. Hypomethylating Agents
There are 2 hypomethylating agents currently approved for the treatment of various subtypes of 
MDS, azacitidine and decitabine.
Vidaza® (azacitidine for injection) is indicated for treatment of patients with the following 
French-American-British (FAB) classification subtypes of MDS ( Appendix C ) in the US:  RA or 
RARS (if accompanied by neutropenia or thrombocytopenia or requiring transfusions),

routinely utilized in the lower risk disease setting.  
Azacitidine is approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of adult patients who are 
not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplan tation with IPSS Int-2 or High risk MDS, 
CMML with 10% to 29% marrow blasts without myeloproliferative disorder and AML with 20% 
to 30% blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, according to WHO classification. In addition to the 
US and EU, azacitidine is currently approved in 30 other countries, including Canada, Switzerla nd, Australia and Japan, for the treatment of MDS (approvals for specific subtypes vary 
by country).
Dacogen
®(decitabine for injection), another hypomethylating agent, is approved in the US for 
treatment of patients with MDS, including previously treated and untreated, de novo and 
secondary MDS of all FAB subtypes (RA, RARS, RAEB, RAEB-T, and CMML) and Int-1, 
Int-2, and high-risk IPSS groups.
While azacitidine and decitabine are approved for treatment of various subtypes of MDS 
including Int-1 risk MDS in some countries, these agents are not uniformly administered as 
standard of care. This is partly because clinicians are reluctant to treat asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic lower-risk MDS patients, especially those who are not yet transfusion-
dependent. In addition, extensive data for these agents in the lower-risk MDS patient population 
are not currently available.
1.2. Compound Background 
Luspatercept (ACE-536) is a recombinant fusio n protein consisting of a modified form of the 
extracellular domain (ECD) of the human activin receptor type IIB (ActRIIB) linked to the 
human IgG1 Fc domain. The ActRIIB receptor and its ligands are members of the transforming growth factor (TGF)- β superfamily, a group of proteins involved in the development, 
differentiation, and/or maturation of various organ systems. No species differences have been 
described in the ligand-receptor interactions among members of the TGF- β family as the ligands 
and receptors are highly conserved across species ( Massagué, 1998 ).  Thus, observations from 
pharmacology studies of luspatercept or its murine analog RAP-536 in animal models provide 
significant insight into the potential of luspatercept to treat human disease. 
Members of the TGF- β family have been shown to play a role as negative regulators of red bl ood 
cell (RBC) development (e rythropoiesis). In nonclinical experiments, luspatercept has been 
shown to bind with high affinity to some TGF- β ligands (eg, growth differentiation factor 
[GDF]8, GDF11, bone morphogenetic protein [BMP]6 and activin B)  
. The emerging body of evidence on 
luspatercept suggests that its mechanism of action is completely independent from that of EPO, and involves stimulation of the later, maturation phase of erythroblast differentiation and 
maturation in the bone marrow ( Figure 1 ).
Across the Phase 2 program, responses to luspatercept treatment were observed in the majority 
of subjects at expected pharmacologic dos e levels of approximately 0.75 up to 1.75 mg/kg, 
administered once every 3 weeks. In particular, as described in more detail in the following 
sections, luspatercept treatment led to hematologic improvement in erythroid response (HI-E) in a substantial proportion of MDS subjects within the initial 3 months of treatment.

Confidential and Propri etary 22 ACE-536-MDS-001 Amendment 2.0 Final: 09 May 2017The preliminary Phase 2 data suggest luspatercept is likely to attenuate ineffective erythropoiesis 
and correct the anemia that characterizes MDS and could provide significant clinical benefit to 
patients by improving hemoglobin levels and reducing the need for regular RBC transfusions. 
The impact on these endpoints, as supported by the preliminary clinical evidence presented here, suggest that luspatercept may provide a sustained clinical benefit (eg, RBC transfusion 
independence) for the treatment of anemia in  patients with IPSS lower risk MDS with ≥15% ring 
sideroblasts.

1.2.2. Summary of Clinical Experience 
One Phase 1 trial with healthy postmenopausal women has been completed. Two Phase 2 studies 
with MDS patients are ongoing:
!Study A536-03: A Phase 2, Open-label, Ascending Dose Study of ACE-536 for the 
Treatment of Anemia in Patients with Low or Intermediate-1 Risk Myelodysplastic 
Syndromes (MDS)
!Study A536-05: An Open-label Extension Study to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of 
ACE-536 for the Treatment of Anemia in Patients with Low or Intermediate-1 Risk 
Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)
Preliminary results from ongoing Phase 2 studies of luspatercept in patients with MDS indicate 
that the dose levels up to 1.75 mg/kg have been generally safe and well-tolerated to date, with no dose-limiting toxicities observed as of 07 July 2015 in either study.  Efficacy parameters are still 
under evaluation.
Additional information regarding clinical experience with luspatercept is summarized in the
current version of the luspatercept IB.
1.2.2.1. Potential Risks of Human Use 
Increases in hematologic parameters (RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, reticulocytes) are expected 
pharmacologic effects of luspatercept treatment. Increases in systolic and diastolic blood 
pressures may occur in concert with increases in hemoglobin values. Excessive or rapid increases 
in hemoglobin or blood pressure may occur and w ill be monitored. Dose modification rules for

Confidential and Propri etary 24 ACE-536-MDS-001 Amendment 2.0 Final: 09 May 2017individual subjects, including dose delay and/or dose reduction, will be utilized to minimize risks 
associated with increased RBC parameters. 
Adverse events considered probably or possibly related to study drug that were reported in at 
least 5% of subjects in the Phase 1 study in h ealthy volun teers included injection site hemorrhage 
and injection site macule.  Adverse events reported in at least 10% of patients regardless of 
causality in the ongoing Phase 2 studies in MDS and β-thalassemia included bone pain, 
headache, asthenia, myalgia, arthralgia, py rexia, musculoskeletal  pain, oropharyngeal pain, 
diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, and cough. As with all biologics, there is the potential for antidrug 
antibodies (ADA) that can be associated with increased drug clearance and hypersensitivity 
reactions.  
 
Luspatercept has exhibited maternal and developmental toxicity in reproductive toxicity studies 
in preclinical species and therefore luspatercept should not be administered to pregnant or nursing women. Male and female subjects of childbearing potential participating in studies of 
luspatercept must be willing to use effect ive methods of contraception during the Treatment 
Period and up to 12 weeks from the last dose of IP. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)must agree to pregnancy testing prior to enrollment and prior to each treatment cycle for the 
duration of the Treatment Period. 
 The occurrence of new malignancies, pre-malignant 
or precancerous lesions will be monitored as events  of interest and will be included as part of the
assessment of adverse events regardless of cau sality, throughout the course of the study. In 
addition, participating subjects should be follow ed long term as specified in the protocol for 
evidence of tumor formation.  
Safety effects will be 
monitored closely through adverse event (AE) reporting, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, 
physical examinations, and ongoing review of unblinded data by an external Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC).  
Please refer to the most current version of the Investigator’s Brochure and subsequent safety 
correspondence for additional information regarding findings from toxicology and clinical
studies.
The most recent version of the luspatercept IB should be reviewed prior to initiating the study.
1.2.2.2. Overall Benefit Risk Assessment
Current available information continues to support an acceptable benefit-risk profile for 
luspatercept when used in accordance with the precautions, dosing, and safety monitoring 
outlined in the study protocol and the routine pharmacovigilance practices.

Confidential and Propri etary 25 ACE-536-MDS-001 Amendment 2.0 Final: 09 May 20171.3. Rationale
1.3.1. Study Rationale and Purpose
IPSS-R classification of MDS (very low, low, or intermediate risk) 
The IPSS-R classification has been chosen to define the Phase 3 patient population because as 
discussed in Section 1.1.1.1 , the IPSS-R classificatio n provides a more discriminatory risk factor 
assessment than the original IPSS ( Greenberg, 1997 ) for evaluating clinical outcomes (survival 
duration and time to progression of AML) for MDS subjects ( Greenberg, 2012 ). The Phase 3 
patient population has been defined as having IPSS -R very low, low or, intermediate risk MDS. 
This patient population represents a subset of subjects with IPSS-R lower-risk MDS who have 
anemia and have limited treatment options in managing the anemia. Subjects in the lower risk groups often become dependent on frequent RBC transfusions, which leads to decreased health-
related quality of life (HRQoL) and increased morbidity and mortality ( Hellström-Lindberg, 
2003; Malcovati, 2005 ). Therefore, the clinically prominent challenge in subjects with lower risk 
MDS is the management and treatment of cy topenias, mainly anemia (the predominant 
cytopenia), and the improvement in QoL. The recent IPSS-R classified 39% of subjects with 
RARS as very low risk, 56% as low risk, and 5% as intermediate risk. The IPSS-R assigns 34% 
of subjects with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia with ringed sideroblasts 
(RCMD-RS) to the very low risk, 50% to the low, and 16% to the intermediate risk groups 
respectively ( Malcovati, 2013 ). 
Ring sideroblasts ≥ 15% of erythroid precursors in bone marrow (or ≥ 5%, if SF3B1 
mutation is present)
According to WHO criteria, refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) is characterized by 
isolated anemia, erythroid dysplasia only, less than 5% blasts and ≥ 15% ring sideroblasts in the 
bone marrow. The 2016 update to the WHO criteria further expanded on this definition of ring 
sideroblastic di sease by also including cases with ring sideroblasts ≥ 5% if SF3B1 mutation is 
present ( Arber, 2016 ). Anemia is macrocytic in the large majority of these subjects, while 
reticulocyte count is in the normal range , reflecting an inappropriately low RBC production 
leading to anemia. The natural history of RARS is characterized by an initial phase of erythroid hyperplasia and ineffect ive erythropoiesis ( Malcovati, 2013 ).
Two recent phase 3 randomized controlled st udies evaluated the us e of erythropoiesis-
stimulating agents (ESAs) versus placebo. In these studies, subjects with lower-risk MDS without ring sideroblasts had a higher probability of response, compared to those with ring 
sideroblasts. In subjects wi th RARS, responses were less frequent and not significantly different 
between ESAs and placebo ( Hellström-Lindberg, 2013 ). The mode of action of ESAs on early 
erythroid progenitors would not be expected to bene fit subjects with defects in the later stages of 
erythropoiesis when erythropoietin r eceptors are absent ( Hattangadi, 2011; Broudy, 1991 ).
Study A536-03 is a Phase 2, open-label, ascending dose study of luspatercept for the treatment of 
anemia in patients with low or intermediate-1 risk MDS.  
In patients (n = 49) receiving 0.75 to 1.75 mg/kg, 51% of patients responded per International 
Working Group (IWG) hematologic improvement, erythroid response (HI-E) hemoglobin increase ≥1.5 g/dL for low transfusion burden patients or reduction of ≥ 4 RBC units or ≥50%

were observed in ring sideroblast positive patients.  Patients with splicing factor mutations 
present (primarily SF3B1) had a 58% response rate.  Of the patients in the higher-dose group 
who received RBC transfusions pri or to luspatercept treatment (ra nge 2 to 18 units/8 weeks), 14
out of 40 (35%) patients were transfusion-free for ≥8 weeks during the 12-week treatment 
period. Add itional information is summarized in the current version of the luspatercept IB.
Refractory, intolerant, or ineligible (endogenous serum erythropoietin level >200 U/L) for 
ESAs.
Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are often used in many newly diagnosed IPSS-R lower
to intermediate (very low, low, intermediate) risk MDS subjects with early onset anemia, as many subjects respond well to ESAs. To be eligible for the ACE-536-MDS-001 Phase 3 study, 
subjects must be refractory to, intolerant, or ineligible for ESAs.
Treatment guidelines vary in regards to defining an adequate course of ESA treatment.  The 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines ( NCCN 2015 guidelines )
recommends dose levels starting at 40,000 IU administered 1-3 times weekly for a duration 6-8 
weeks prior to assessment of hematological improvement. The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines recommend dose levels starting at 30,000 IU weekly ( Fenaux, 
2014 ).  However, a significant proportion of these subjects will be resistant to ESAs as 
monotherapy or experience short-lasting responses. ( Hellström-Lindberg, 2013 ). Studies have 
shown that elevated endogenous serum erythropoietin levels and RBC transfusion requirements 
are negatively correlated with response to ESAs. ( Hellström-Lindberg, 2013 ).
Meta-analyses of clinical trials with thousands of treated subjects have led to the following 
conclusions: 
!RARS subjects with or without a need for transfusion but with a serum EPO level > 200 
U/L had a response rate of 0% to ESAs ( Hellström-Lindberg, 1995; Santini, 2011 ).
!MDS subjects without a need for transfusion, with a serum EPO level < 200 U/L, and a 
diagnosis other than RCMD-RS have a higher response rate to ESAs ( Santini, 2011 ). 
In study A536-03, high response rates were also seen in subjects in the higher-dose group with 
EPO levels < 200U/L (68%) and 200-500 U/L (36%).
1.3.2. Rationale for the Study Design
ACE-536-MDS-001 is a phase-3 multicenter randomized double-blind placebo controlled study.
The primary objective is to evaluate RBC tran sfusion independence (RBC-TI) in 2 treatment
arms (luspatercept versus placebo) for treatment of anemia due to very low, low, or intermediate
risk (IPSS-R) MDS in subjects with ring sideroblasts who require RBC transfusions. Secondary 
objectives include evaluation of efficacy (eg, h ematological improvement, HRQoL, changes in 
serum ferritin and iron chelation therapy use) as well as safety and tolerability.
The multicenter nature of the study provides assurance that the results are likely to have general 
applicability.  The design of this study (ie, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, and 
parallel-group) will eliminate bias in assignment of the IP or in data interpretation.
A 2:1 randomization w ill be used as this is an orphan disease with a limited number of subjects 
available. Subjects will be randomized to receive luspatercept or placebo at a 2:1 ratio. A 2:1

group ( Dumville, 2006 ).
In order to mitigate the potential bias should subjects in the control arm drop out early due to the
lack of a quick response, the primary efficacy analysis will be the proportion of subjectsachieving RBC-TI with a duration ≥8 weeks measured at 24 weeks.
After completion of the MDS Disease Assessment by the investigator at the Week 25 Visit, 
subjects who exhibit clinical benefit with no evidence of disease progression per IWG criteria for altering natural history of MDS ( Cheson, 2006 ; Appendix E ) will continue double-blind
treatment. The proportion of subjects achieving RBC-TI with a duration ≥8 weeks at 48 weeks
will be assessed as a secondary endpoint to capture potential late responders. In addition, the proportion of subjects achieving RBC-TI with a duration ≥ 12 weeks will be assessed as a 
secondary endpoint, representing extended duration of benefit achieved with therapy.
The study will be stratified by RBC transfusion burden and IPSS-R risk category ( Greenberg, 
2012 ) at baseline. These factors are discussed below.
RBC transfusion burden at baseline
The primary endpoint for the study is the proportion of subjects who are RBC transfusion free 
over any consecutive 56-day period. In the phase 2 studies, achieving transfusion independence 
(TI) was shown to be dependent on baseline transfusion burden, Subjects who receive an average 
of ≥ 6 RBC units during each of two consecutive 8-week periods prior to randomization will be 
less likely to become transfusion independent than those subjects who receive < 6 RBC units/8 
weeks. Thus, stratification by RBC transfusion burden is considered useful due to its likely effect 
on the primary endpoint.
IPSS-R classification at baseline: Very low and low versus intermediate
Among the lower risk categories for IPSS-R, m ortality risk is distinctively worse for 
intermediate risk than for very low and low ri sk. The intermediate classification may also be 
indicative of higher risk of progression to AML ( Greenberg, 2012 ). Thus in consideration of the 
long-term safety analyses, stratification for IPSS-R will be used.
1.3.3. Rationale for Dose, Schedule and Regimen Selection
The starting dose level of 1.0 mg/kg and the maximum dose level of 1.75 mg/kg are based on 
clinical data from the ongoing Phase 2 A536-03 and A536-05 studies in MDS. Preliminary 
results indicate that the dose levels up to 1.75 mg/kg have been generally safe and well-tolerated to date. A higher response rate, including HI-E  and RBC-TI, was observe d in the higher dose 
groups (0.75-to 1.75 mg/kg subcutaneous every 3 w eeks [Q3W]) compared to the lower dose 
groups (0.125-0.5 mg/kg subcutaneous Q3W).
Selection of the dosing schedule (every 3 weeks, Q3W) was based on the duration of the 
luspatercept responses as well as pharmacokinetic parameters for luspatercept in MDS patients.  
The transfusion-reducing effect of luspatercept relies  on its ability to increase hemoglobin; in the 
Phase 2 studies, the increase in hemoglobin was well maintained with the Q3W dosing schedule.
Additional information regarding these clinical studies is summarized in the current version of 
the luspatercept IB.

Confidential and Propri etary 28 ACE-536-MDS-001 Amendment 2.0 Final: 09 May 20171.3.4. Rationale for Choice of Placebo Comparator
Treatment algorithms such as those issued by NCCN ( NCCN 2015 guidelines ) suggest that 
lower risk MDS patients with symptomatic anemia be treated with ESAs ± G-CSF if the serum 
EPO level is ≤500 U/L. Those without a response or who have a higher EPO level and either 
have a poor probability to respond to immune suppressive therapy, or who are intolerant to or 
fail immune suppressive therapy, have three op tions proposed: hypomethylating agents (HMAs), 
lenalidomide, or entry on a clinical trial. 
Entry into a clinical trial of luspatercept rather than use of HMAs or lenalidomide may be 
preferred in order to avoid the risk of Grade 3-4 cytopenias, which occur with both azacitidine 
and decitabine. Since lower risk MDS patients wi th ring sideroblasts a nd low blast counts (< 5%) 
are unlikely to progress to AML, the predominant therapeutic objective is the management of 
anemia and the prevention of trans fusion related complications. Since this might mean 5 or more 
years of primarily chronic anemia management before disease progression, the benefit/risk of early intervention with HMAs is questionable. Subjects who fail to benefit from study drug in 
this clinical trial may subsequently receive HMAs or lenalidomide.
The primary endpoint for this study , RBC-TI, is b etter assessed against the natural history of the 
disease (ie, in subjects previously untreated with disease modifying agents). Based on these 
considerations, placebo is the appropriate comparator for the proposed Phase 3 study. Standard 
of care for the management of acute anemia (ie, RBC transfusions) will be applied to both treatment groups.

of RS+ patients ( Papaemmanuil, 2011; Malcovati, 2011 ) and thought to be causally related to 
chromosome stability, DNA repair and gene regulation that may result in anemia and

Table 2: Study Objectives
Primary Objective
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate RBC transfusion independence (RBC-TI) of 
luspatercept compared with placebo for the treatment of anemia due to IPSS-R very low, low, or 
intermediate risk MDS in subjects with ring sideroblasts who require red blood cell (RBC) 
transfusions.
Secondary Objectives
The secondary objectives are:
!To assess the safety and tolerability of luspatercept compared with placebo
!To evaluate the effect of luspatercept on reduction in RBC transfusions, increase in 
hemoglobin, duration of RBC-TI, improvement in h ealth-r elated quality of life (HRQoL)
(ie, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life 
Questionnaire [EORTC QLQ-C30]), increase in neutrophils, increase in platelets, decrease in serum ferritin, decrease in iron chelation therapy use, and time to RBC-TI 
compared with placebo
!To evaluate population pharmacokinetics and exposure-response relationships for 
luspatercept in MDS subjects

3.1. Study Design
The study will be conducted in compliance w ith the International Council on Harmonisation 
(ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registrati on of Pharmaceut icals for Human Use/Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.
This is a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to determine 
the efficacy and safety of luspatercept (ACE-536) versus placebo in subjects with anemia due to 
IPSS-R very low, low, or intermediate MDS with ring sideroblasts who require RBC 
transfusions. 
The study is divided into the Screening Pe riod, a double-blind Treatment Period (Primary Phase 
and Extension Phase), and a Posttreatment Follow-up Period. See Figure 2 for more details and 
refer to Section 6for full list of study procedures/assessments. 
Screening Period 
Upon giving written informed consent, subjects enter the Screening Period to determine 
eligibility. Subject screening procedures are to ta ke place within 5 weeks prior to randomization. 
During the Screening Period, the subject will undergo safety and other assessments to determine 
eligibility for the randomized study.
Central review of bone marrow aspirate smear and biopsy, peripheral bl ood smear, cytogenetics,
will be used to confirm MDS dia gnosis and WHO classification ( Appendix B ) and/or FAB
classification ( Appendix C ) and to determine the baseline IPSS-R riskclassification ( Greenberg, 
2012; Appendix D ).
Transfusion history must be available for at least the 16 weeks immediately preceding and 
including the date of rando mization. Transfusion d ata should include the type of transfusion (eg, 
RBC, pl atelets), number of units, and d ate of transfusion.  Red bloo d cell (RBC) cell transfusion 
data should include the hemoglobin (Hgb) value for which the transfusion was administered (ie, 
pretransfusion Hgb value).
Refer to Section 6for full list of study procedures/assessments.  
Randomization
Randomization will occur bya central rando mization procedure using integr ated re sponse 
technology (IRT). Eligible subjects will be  randomized at a 2 :1 ratio to either:
oExperimental Arm: Luspatercept (ACE-536): Starting dose of 1.0 mg/kg subcutaneous 
injection every 3 weeks (administered on Day 1 of each 21-day treatment cycle)
OR 
oControl Arm: Placebo (Volume equivalent to experimental arm) subcutaneous injection 
every 3 weeks (administered on Day 1 of each 21-day tr eatment cycle)
After randomization, no crossover between the tr eatment arms will be permitted at any point 
during the study.

!IPSS-R at baseline
∀Very low, low
∀Intermediate
Refer to Section 6for additional details.
Primary Phase of the Treatment Period: Weeks 1-24 
The first dose of investigational product (IP) should be administered after, but within 3 days of 
randomizatio n and can be on the same day as randomization. Refer to the IRT manual for 
additional information on randomization utilizing IRT.  
Subjects will receive IP (either luspatercept or matching placebo) on Day 1 of each 21-day 
treatment cycle.
In both treatment arms, best supportive care (BSC) may be used in combination with study 
treatment when clinically indicated per investigat or. Best supportive care includes, but is not 
limited to, treatment with transfusions, antibiotic, antiviral and/or antifungal therapy, and 
nutritional support as needed.  Best supportive care forthis study excludes the use of ESAs.  Refer to Section 8for additional details.
Subjects should receive IP through at least the first 24 calendar weeks after the date of first dose
unless the subject experiences unacceptable toxicities, withdrawsconsent, or meets any other treatment discontinuation criteria (Section 11.1).
Week 25 Visit:  MDS Disease Assessment 
The Week 25 Visit should be completed 24 calendar weeks after the date of first dose, regardless 
of dose delays.  As central laboratory results from bone marrow and peripheral blood samples are 
required as part of the MDS Disease Assessment, a 14 day window is allowed for the Week 25 
Visit.  Please refer to Section 6.2.2 for more details related to assessments/procedures. 
In order for subjects to remain on double-blind treatment beyond the first 24 calendar weeks, the 
following criteria must be confirmed upon the completion of the MDS Disease Assessment by 
the investigator at the Week 25 Visit:
!Evidence of clinical benefit (eg, decrease in RBC transfusion requirement compared to 
baseline requirement or hemoglobin increase compared to baseline)
AND
!Absence of disease progression per IWG criteria for altering natural history of MDS 
(Cheson, 2006 ; Appendix E ).

Confidential and Propri etary 36 ACE-536-MDS-001 Amendment 2.0 Final: 09 May 2017Based on the outcome of the Week 25 Visit MDS Disease Assessment, subjects will either be 
discontinued from treatment with IP and enter the Posttreatment Follow-up Period or continue 
double-blind treatment with IP in the Extension Phase of the Treatment Period. 
Extension Phase of the Treatment Period:  After Week 25 Visit
Subjects who meet criteria to remain on double-blind treatment after completion of the Week 25 
Visit MDS Disease Assessment may continue dosing on Day 1 of each 21-day treatment cy cle in 
the Extension Phase of the Treatment Period until the subject experiences unacceptable toxicities, disease progression per IWG criteria for altering natural history of MDS ( Cheson,
2006 ; Appendix E) , withdrawsconsent, or meets any othe r discontinuation criteria (Section 11). 
MDS Disease Assessment will be repeated by the investigator at Extension Cycle 8, Day 1 and 
Day 1 of every eighth Extension Cycle thereafter (ie, Extension Cycle 8, 16, 24+, etc. or every 
24 weeks in the event of dose delays) until th e subject is disconti nued from treatment.  
For subjects to continue double-blind treatment in the Extension Phase of the Treatment Period, 
each MDS Disease Assessment (criteria detailed in Section 6.2.2 ) should confirm continued 
clinical benefit and absence of disease progression per IWG criteria for altering natural history of 
MDS ( Cheson, 2006 ; Appendix E ).
Serial measurements of safety and efficacy will continue on scheduled study visits (Day 1 of 
every treatment cycle) in the Exten sion Phase of the Treatment Peri od.  Refer to Section 6for 
full list of study procedures/assessments.
Best supportive care (BSC) may continue to be used in combination with study treatment when 
clinically indicated per investigator. See Section 8for more information on best supportive
care/concomitant medications.
The same dose titration, delay and/or reduction, and treatment discontinuation criteria will st ill 
apply in the Extension Phase of the Treatment Period.  See Section 7.2.1 for dose modification 
rules and Section 11.2 for discontinuation criteria.
All subjects who have received at least one dose of study treatment should undergo end of
treatment (EOT) evaluations when IP is discontinued.  The reason for discontinuation will be 
recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) pages and in the source document.
Posttreatment Follow-up Period
All AEs will be recorded by the Investigator from the time the subject signs informed consent 
until 42 days after the last dose of IP as well as those serious adverse events (SAEs) made known to the Investigator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being related to IP. 
Transfusion data collection will continue up until 16 weeks from the date of last dose of IP or the 
End of Treatment Visit (whichever is later).  
Females of childbearing potential (FCBPs) will be  advised to avoid becoming pregnant during 
study and for 12 weeks after the last dose of IP.  Males will be advised to use a latex condom 
during any sexual contact with FCBP prior to starting investigational product and continue for 12 weeks following the last dose of IP, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.  Refer 
to Section 10.

After a Screening Period of up to 5 weeks, eligible subjects who are randomized to receive IP 
(either placebo or luspatercept) should continue double-blind treatment through at least the first 
24 calendar weeks of the study unless the sub ject experiences unacceptable toxicities, disease 
progression per IWG criteria for altering natural history of MDS ( Cheson, 2006 ; Appendix E ),
withdraws consent, or meets any other discontinu ation criteria (Section 11).
Subjects who experience clinical benefit as determined by the Week 25 Visit MDS Disease 
Status Assessment (Section 6.2.2 ) may continue double-blind treatment beyond the Week 25 
Visit (ie, in the Extension Phase of the Treatment Period) until the subject experiences 
unacceptable toxicities, disease progression per IWG criteria for altering natural history of MDS 
(Cheson, 2006 ; Appendix E ), withdraws consent, or meets any other discontinuation criteria 
(Section 11).
For all subjects who receive at least one dose of IP, continuation of monitoring for progression to 
AML and other malignancies/pre-malignancies (please refer to Section 10.5 for details) will 
occur in the Posttreatment Follo w-up Period, along with subse quent MDS therapies, and overall 
survival for at least 3 years from the date of last dose of IP unless the subject withdraws consent 
from the study, dies or is lost to follow-up.
3.3. End of Trial
The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last subject to complete the 
post-treatment follow-up, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last subject that is 
required for primary, secondary  analysis, as prespecified in the protocoland/or SAP, whichever is the later date.
The Sponsor may end the trial when all key endpoi nts and objectives of the study have been 
analyzed, and the availability of a roll-over protocol exists into which any subjects remaining on 
study may be consented and continue to receive access to luspatercept and/or complete post-
treatment follow-up.  Such a protocol would be  written for a compound that would not yet be 
commercially available.

Section 4.2.
4Subjects must have at least 16 weeks documented transfusion history prior to randomization. This transfusion data includes hemo globin measured prior to transfusion 
(pretransfusion Hgb).  Refer to Section 6.1.
5Urinalysis assessed centrally and to include microscopic, quantitative analysis of urine. (eg, microalbumin/albumin, protein, cr eatinine, microalbumin/creatinine ratio).
6A local Coomb’s test is only performed if total bilirubin > 2 x ULN (see Section 4.3).  If positive, a local reticulocyte count may be requested.  Local test results confirming 
known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C status should not have been performed earlier than 4 weeks from  the date of ICF signature.  If beyond 
this window, additional local testing may be requested (see Section 4.3).
7Pregnancy test is required for all female subjects of childbearing potential.  Serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( β-hCG) will be performed at screening.  A urine (or 
serum) pregnancy test will be repeated prior to the first administration of IP on C1D1, unless the screening pregnancy test was done within 72 hours of C1D1. During the 
Treatment Period, urine or serum pregnancy test is allowed. For males and FCBP, counseling about pregnancy precautions and the p otential risks of fetal exposure must be 
conducted prior to each IP administration or on a monthly basis (eg, in the event of dose delays). Refer to Section 6.1for additional details.
8Serum chemistry (eg, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate [if available], calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, blood urea nitrog en [BUN], creatinine, creatinine clearance 
and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate, glucose, albumin, total protein, alkaline phosphatase, direct/indirect total bilir ubin, AST/SGOT or ALT/SGPT, lactate 
dehydrogenase [LDH], uric acid) will be analyzed by the central laboratory.  Refer to Section 6.1. 
9Hematology assessment (eg, red blood cell [RBC] count, complete blood count [CBC], white blood cell [WBC] with differential, he moglobin, hematocrit, nucleated red blood 
cells [nRBC], absolute reticulocyte count, platelet count, mean corpuscular volume [MCV], mean corpuscular hemoglobin [MCH], me an corpuscular hemoglobin concentration 
[MCHC], and red blood cell distribution width [RDW]) will be tested by the central laboratory.  Refer to Section 6.1.  
10EPO will be assessed centrally.  During the Screening Period, the serum EPO level should be collected on the same day as a plan ned RBC transfusion, prior to the transfusion 
or 7 days after any RBC transfusion due to possible reduction of the serum level related to the hemoglobin level achieved after  the last transfusion. 
11Serum ferritin will be assessed centrally. Sample should be collected within 5 weeks prior to randomization. Sample should be c ollected prior to administration of IP.  
Additional serum ferritin results from previous local laboratory assessments (ie, within the 16 week window immediately prior t o randomization date) should be collected, if 
available in the medical records, and entered into the eCRF.
12During the Treatment Period, MDS Disease Assessment (which includes investigator assessment of clinical benefit and MDS disease status) should be completed by the 
investigator in conjunction with bone marrow/peripheral blood sample collection for cytomorphology and cytogenetics collected at the Week 25 Visit.  For details related to the 
allowed time window related to procedures and assessments refer to Section 6.2.2 .  Based on the outcome of the MDS Disease Assessment, subjects will either be discontinued
from treatment with IP and enter the Posttreatment Follow-Up Period or continue double-blind treatment with IP in the Extension  Phase of the Treatment Period.  Refer to 
Section 6.2.3 for additional details.
13During the Screening Period, bone marrow biopsy AND bone marrow aspirate are required. The screening BMB should be performed wi thin 5 weeks prior to randomization.  
The screening BMA should be collected within the protocol screening window.  After randomization, a bone marrow biopsy is colle cted only when adequate aspirate is not 
attainable.  During the Extension Phase of the Treatment Period: Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples to be collected at Ext ension Cycle 8, Day 1 and Day 1 of every 
eighth Extension Cycle thereafter (ie, Extension Cycle 8, 16, 24+, etc. or approximately every 24 weeks in the event of dose de lays). Bone marrow samples at End of Treatment 
Visit: Perform only if visit is > 90 days from prior bone marrow procedure. Refer to central laboratory manual for additional i nformation related to sample collection
 
 
  
 
.
15On dosing days, local laboratory sample should be collected and Hgb levels assessed prior to each IP administration to ensure do se modification rules are followed as outlined 
in Section 7.2.1.1 , Table 6.  In these circumstances, a split sample should also be collected and sent to the central laboratory for analysis. Sub jects must have blood pressure 
assessed (as detailed in Section 6.1) prior to each IP administration.
16If subject completed Screening EORTC QLQ-C30  questionnaires within 14 days prior to C1D1, it does not have to be repeated at C1 D1. If performed on C1D1, 
both EORTC QLQ-C30  questionnaires should be completed by the subject prior to IP administration.
17Long-Term Posttreatment Follow-up for Overall Survival (OS), Progression to AML, other malignancies/pre-malignancies (please ref er to Section 10.5 for details), and data
collection for subsequent MDS therapies may be conducted by record review (including public records if allowed by local regulati ons) and/or telephone contact with the

Any questions regarding the protocol should be directed to the Celgene Medical Monitor or 
designee. 
All of the protocol required assessments are listed in Section 5, Table 4 , with an “X” indicating 
at which visits the assessments are to be performed. All data obtained from these assessments must be recorded in the subject’s source documentation.  Except for the Week 25 Visit, all study
visits during the Treatment Period (both Primary and Extension Phases) must occur within 
± 3 days of the scheduled day.  A 14 day window  is allowed for the Week 25 Visit (refer to 
Section 6.2.2 for details).  Week 25 Visit and Extension Cycle 1 Visit procedures/assessments 
may not need to be repeated if previously performed within ±7 days of the scheduled visit.
  
End of Treatment Visit procedures/assessments may not need to be repeated if previously 
performed within ±7 days of EOT visit.  If a subject is discontinued during a regular scheduled 
visit, all EOT procedures should be completed at that visit.  End of Treatment Visit 
procedures/assessments may occur at 42 Day Follow-up assessment if subject is discontinued within ± 7 days of 42 Day Follow-up assessment.
A window of ± 14 days is allowed for Posttreatmen t Long-Term Follow-up assessments (ie, OS, 
progression to AML, other malignancies/pre-malignancies, subsequent MDS therapies).  Procedures are described in detail below.
Subjects must have hemoglobin and blood pressure assessed prior to each IP administration. 
Blood pressure values should be confirmed by a mean of two readings obtained approximately 5minutes apart with the subject seated for approximately 10 minutes prior to initial reading. 
Safety laboratory analyses and all laboratory assessments will be performed centrally (except 
otherwise stated in this section) during the Treatment Period.  
Local laboratories are allowed in cases when timely results are needed (eg, randomization, study 
treatment dosing decisions, hematology assessments between clinic visits, adverse event).  In 
these circumstances, a split sample should st ill be co llected and sent to the central laboratory for 
analysis.  With prior sponsor consultation, local la boratories may also be used to determine study 
eligibility if central laboratory results are not availab le (eg, hemolyzed sample, etc.) or if there is 
a discrepancy between local and central labor atory results impacting st udy eligibility.  Local 
laboratory data should be collected in the eCRF if relevant to st udy eligibility determination, 
dose administration, dose modification, or an AE, significant discrepancy between local and 
central laboratory results (from samples coll ected at the same study time point), or when no 
central laboratory results were obtained.  
Refer to the eCRF completion guidelines for additional information related to data entry 
requirements of local laboratories.  
Sample collection, processing, storage, and shipment procedures will be provided in the Study 
Laboratory Manual.

Protocol ACE-536-MDS-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 54 ACE-536-MDS-001 Amendment 2.0 Final: 09 May 2017!Assessment of Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria For Study Eligibility
Screening evaluations will be performed for all subjects to determine study eligibility. These 
evaluations must be completed within 5 weeks of rando mization (refer to Table of Events,
Section 5, Table 4 for further information). Screening la boratory values must demonstrate 
subject eligibility, but may be repeated wi thin the screening window, if necessary.
Waivers to the protocol will not be granted during the conduct of this trial, under any 
circumstances.
The following assessments/procedures will be performed during the Screening Period as 
specified in the Table of Events, Table 4 :
!Bone Marrow and Peripheral Blood Samples
Screening MDS diagnosis confirmation requires both bone marrow biopsy (BMB), bone marrow 
aspirate (BMA), and peripheral blood samples. Samples may be reviewed locally, but must also
be sent to the central laboratory for analysis.
The screening BMB, BMA, and peripheral bl ood samples should be co llected within the protocol 
screening window or 5 weeks prior to randomization.  If a subject is rescreened (eg, due to 
retesting of another lab), repeat bone marrow samples do not need to be collected contingent that 
initial samples were adequ ate for cytom orphology/cytogeneti c assessment by the central 
laboratory. During the course of the study, wh enever a bone marrow sample is collected, a 
peripheral blood smear is to be prepared.
Sample collection, processing, storage, and shipment procedures will be provided in the study’s 
Central Laboratory Manual.
!Cytomorphology Assessment
Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples will be prepared locally and sent to the
central laboratory for analysis to c onfirm MDS diagnosis and baseline WHO
(Appendix B ) and/or FAB classification ( Appendix C ) prior to randomization.  
If the central reviewer and local pathologist disagree on the diagnosis of a subject, a 
third reviewer at the central laboratory may be consulted to provide an adjudication assessment. The central laboratory may also request the site to send in samples 
reviewed by the local pathologist for further assessment.
!Cytogenetics Analysis
The central laboratory will conduct cytogenetic analysis throughout the study. The 
central laboratory will provide standardized analysis and reporting for all subjects. 
Bone marrow samples will be sent to the central laboratory for processing and 
cytogenetic analysis prior to randomization.
In the event that cytomorphology/cytogenetic analysis cannot be performed by the central 
laboratory prior to randomization, local cytom orphology/cytogenetic an alysis may suffice for
randomization purposes after consultation with the S ponsor. Every attempt should be made to
send bone marrow and peripheral blood samples to the central laboratory for processing and
analysis prior to the first dose of investigational product. If this does not occur, a central “over

date) by the central laboratory.
Results from central laboratory analysis should be used to d etermine baseline IPSS-R category 
(Greenberg, 2012 ; Appendix D ).  
The central laboratory will also assess bone marrow and peripheral blood samples during the 
Treatment Period of the study.
 
Refer to Section 6.11 for additional information and Table 4 for timing of sample collection 
during the study.
!Prior Transfusion History
Transfusion history must be available for at least the 16 weeks immediately preceding and 
including the date of randomization. Transfusion d ata should include the type of transfusion (eg, 
RBC, pl atelets), number of units, reason and d ate of transfusion.  
Transfusion data should also include the pretransfusion Hgb levels that triggered the RBC 
transfusions. 
These Hgb levels can be from local or centr al laboratory measure ments.  For platelet 
transfusions, data should include the platelet value for which thep latelet transfusion was 
administered. These platelet values can be from the central or a local laboratory. 
Documentation of the following criteria is required to meet protocol inclusion criteria and must 
be confirmed prior to randomization:
!Average transfusion requirement of at least 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) 
per 8 weeks during the 16 weeks immediately preceding randomization.  Only RBC 
transfusions administered due to a pre-transfusion Hgb of ≤ 10 g/dL will counted to 
determine eligibility.
!There must also not be any consecutive 56-day period that was RBC transfusion free 
during the 16 weeks immediately preceding randomization.
All RBC transfusion records for at least 16 weeks immediately preceding and including the date 
of randomization s hould be collected (including any transfusio ns at outside local institutions).  
Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions administered for elective surgery will not count towards 
meeting RBC transfusion inclusion cr iteria requirements, but should st ill be rec orded in the 
eCRF.  
The RBC transfusion data during the 16 weeks immediately preceding randomization will be
used to determine the baseline RBC transfusion re quirement for an individual study subject.  
Thus, this information must be collected during the Screening window (prior to randomization). 
!Prior Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) Therapies
Type of ESA, dose, frequency, duration, best response, and reason for discontinuation should be 
collected and entered into the eCRF re gardless of date of discontinuation.

ESA treatment.  See Section 4.2for additional details .
!Demographics and Medical History
The subject’s date of birth, sex, race and ethnicity will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.
Relevant medical history (including recent surgical history) and current med ical c onditions, 
including those symptoms related to MDS, must also be recorded on the appropriate eCRF at 
screening. 
History of MDS disease and other prior maligna ncies will also be r ecorded on th e appropriate
eCRF. This may include relevant information related to original MDS diagnosis (eg, date of 
original diagnosis, WHO and/or FAB classification at original diagnosis, prior treatments 
administered) and/or other past malignancies.

total bilirubin is ≥ 2.0 x ULN.  Refer to Section 4.3.  If positive, a local reticulocyte count may 
be requested.
!Assessment of HIV/Hepatitis B/Hepatitis C status 
If known, local test results confirming HIV, Hepa titis B, Hepatitis C status should not have been 
performed earlier than 4 weeks from the date of ICF signature.  If beyond this window, 
additional local testing may be requested (see Section 4.3).
!Serum Ferritin
Sample should be  collected within 5 week s prior to randomization. 
Serum ferritin analysis is to be performed by the central laboratory. 
Additional serum ferritin results from previous local la boratory assessments (ie, within the 16 
week window immediately prior to randomization date) should be collected, if available in the 
medical records, and entered into the eCRF.
Refer to Table 4 for timing of serum ferritin testing during the study.
!Serum EPO Level
During the Screening Period, the serum EPO level should be collected on the same day as a
planned RBC transfusion, prior to the transfusion or 7 days after any RBC transfusion due to 
possible reduction of the serum level related to th e hemoglobin level achieved after the last 
transfusion. 
Serum EPO analysis is to be performed by the central laboratory.

Confidential and Propri etary 58 ACE-536-MDS-001 Amendment 2.0 Final: 09 May 2017On dosing days, local laboratory sample should be  collected and Hgb levels assessed prior to 
each IP administration to ensure dose modification rules are followed as outlined in Section 
7.2.1.1 , Table 6 .  In these circumstances, a split sample should also be collected and sent to the 
central laboratory for analysis.  
Refer to Table 4 for timing of hematology assessments during the study.  
!Serum Chemistry Panel
Serum chemistry (eg, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate [if available], calcium, 
magnesium, phosphorus, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, creatinine clearance and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate, gluc ose, albumin, total protein, alkaline phosphatase,
direct/indirect total bilirubin, AST/SGOT or ALT/SGPT, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], uric 
acid) will be analyzed by the central laboratory.  
Refer to Table 4 for timing of serum chemistry assessments during the study. 
!Pregnancy Testing and Counseling 
This protocol defines a FCBP as a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a 
hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 2) has not been naturallypostmenopausal
(amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24
consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).
A medically supervised serum pregnancy test (condu cted at the central labor atory or locally) is to 
be obtained and verified negative in all female subjects of childbearing potential at screening.  
The investigator will appraise a female subject as a FCBP according to this definition.  Justification must be recorded in the eCRF and the source document. Pregnancy testing is not 
required for non-FCBP subjects.
Serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( β-hCG) pregnancy test (which must be negative) 
with a minimum sensitivity of 25 mIU/mL will be performed within 5 weeks prior to Dose 1 Day 
1. Urine (or serum) pregnancy test will be performed to assess subject eligibility within 72 hours 
prior to the first administration of IP, if the initial serum pregnancy test did not already occur with 72 hours of dosing (negative results required for IP administration). 
During the Treatment Period urine or serum pregnancy test is allowed. 
For males and FCBP, counseling about pregnancy precautions and the potential risks of fetal 
exposure must be conducted prior to each IP administration or monthly (eg, in the event of dose 
delays).  Refer to Section 10.4 for additional details.
Refer to Table 4 for timing of pregnancy testing and counseling during the study.
!Vital Signs, Height, and Weight
Vital signs, including height (measured at Scr eening only), weight (at Screening and on study 
drug dosing days only), seated blood pressure, temp erature, heart rate, a nd respiratory rate. 
On study drug dosing days, blood pressure must be assessed prior to each IP administration.  
Blood pressure values should be confirmed by mean of two readings obtained approximately 5 
minutes apart with the subject seated for approximately 10 minutes prior to initial reading. 
Refer to Table 4 for timing of vital signs during the study.

!Baseline IPSS-R risk category ( Greenberg, 2012; Appendix D )
!Average 8-week baseline RBC transfusion requirement.
The first dose of IP should be administered after, but within 3 days of rando mization and can be 
on the same day as randomization.  Refer to the IRT manual for additional information on randomization u tilizing IRT.
!Monitoring for Progression to AML and Other Malignancies/Pre-malignancies
Progression to AML as per WHO classification (V ardiman, 2009) will be monitored and will be 
included as part of the safety assessment throughout the course of the study.  Progression to 
AML should be monitored from time of signing of informed consent through at least 3 years 
after last dose of IP or until death, lost to fo llow-up or withdrawal of consent from the study. 
The occurrence of a new malignancy or pre-malignant lesion will be monitored as an event of 
interest and should be included as part of the assessment of adverse events throughout the course 
of the study (please refer to Section 10.5 for details). Investigators are to report the development 
of any new malignancy or pre-malignant lesion as a serious adverse event, regardless of causal 
relationship to IP (study drug[s] or control), occurring at any time for the duration of the study, 
from the time of signing the ICF for up to and including at least 3 years of long-term follow-up, 
or until death, lost to follow-up, or with drawal of consent for further data collection.
Documentation supporting the diagnosis of progr ession to AML and other malignancies/pre-
malignancies (eg, confirmatory histology or cyto logy results, etc.) may be requested.  
Appropriate information rel ated diagnosis of AML and other malignancies/pre-malignancies 
should be captured on the eCRF and in the subject’s source documents.  
Refer to Section 10.5 and Section 10.6 for more information regarding reporting requirements.  
6.2. Treatment Period
The subject will begin treatment upon confirmation of eligibility. The subject must start 
treatment within 5 weeks of signing the informed consent form (ICF).  If screening assessments 
are performed within 72 hours of Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1), safety laboratory and physical 
examinations need not be repeated at C1D1 with the exception of blood pressure measurement, hematology, serum ferritin, and serum EPO sample collection.

weeks of C1D1, it does not have to be repeated at C1D1. If performed on C1D1, both EORTC
QLQ-C30  questionnaires should be completed by the subject prior to IP 
administration.
On dosing days, local laboratory hgb levels should be assessed prior to each IP administration to 
ensure dose modification rules are followed as outlined in Section 7.  In these circumstances, a 
split sample should also be collected and sent to the central laboratory for analysis.  Subjects 
should also have blood pressure assessed (as detailed in Section 6.1) and the clinical site should 
confirm with the subject if any transfusions were received at outside local centers in between 
study visits, prior to each IP administration.
6.2.1. Primary Phase of the Treatment Period: Weeks 1-24
Subjects will receive IP (either luspatercept or matching placebo) on Day 1 of each 21-day 
treatment cycle.
Treatment cycles are 21 days in duration, and will occur as described in Section 7.2.
The following procedures/evaluations will be performed at the frequency specified in the Table

6.2.2. MDS Disease Assessment: Week 25 Visit
Assessment of Transfusions, Bone Marrow, and Peripheral BloodThe MDS Disease Assessment consists of the investigator’s assessment of clinical benefit from 
study drug and status of underlying disease.
The first MDS Disease Assessment should be completed 24 calendar weeks after the date of 
first dose, regardless of dose delays. The calculated due date for the first MDS Disease 
Assessment is defined as C1D1 + 168 days (ie,  24 weeks). The MDS Disease Assessment by the 
investigator should be completed no sooner than 24 calendar weeks (ie, 168 days) after the day
of C1D1 and requires a minimum of 24-weeks of transfusion information for the assessment of 
clinical benefit.  Up to date information related to all transfusions received during the Treatment Period (including those received at outside institutions) must be available prior to completion of
the clinical benefit component of the MDS Disease Assessment.
As central laboratory results from bone marrow and peripheral blood samples (eg, 
cytomorphology, cytogenetics analy sis) are required as part of the MDS Disease Assessment, a 
14-day window is allowed for the Week 25 Visit in order to account for sample co llection and 
turnaround time of results.  
In order for subjects to remain on double-blind treatment beyond the first 24 calendar weeks, the 
following criteria must be confirmed upon the completion of the MDS Disease Assessment by 
the investigator:

baseline requirement or hemoglobin increase compared to baseline)
AND
!Absence of disease progression per IWG criteria for altering natural history of MDS 
(Cheson, 2006 ; Appendix E ).
Based on the outcome of the MDS Disease Assessment, subjects will either be discontinued from 
treatment with IP and enter the Posttreatment Follow-up Pe riod or continue double-blind 
treatment with IP in the Extension Phase of the Treatment Period. 
For subjects that meet criteria to continue double-blind treatment in the Extension Phase, the 
duration between the last dose of IP in the Primary Phase and first Extension Phase dose should not be delayed beyond 21 days solely due to awaiting cytomorphology/cytogenetics results 
contingent that the investigator has confirmed  absence of signs of disease progression based on 
review of peripheral blood parameters.  
In circumstances where the subject does receive the first Extension Phase dose prior to 
cytomorphology/cytogenetics resu lts being available, the investigator must complete assessment 
of cytomorphology/cytogenetics results prior to the next IP administr ation.
A bone marrow biopsy is to be collected only when adequate aspirate is not attainable. Whenever 
a bone marrow sample is collected, a peripheral blood smear is to be prepared.  Refer to the
Central Laboratory Manual for additional information.

Subjects who meet criteria to remain on double-blind treatment after completion of the Week 25 
Visit MDS Disease Assessment may continue dosing on Day 1 of each 21-day treatment cy cle in 
the Extension Phase of Treatment Period until the subject experiences unacceptable toxicities, 
disease progression per IWG criteria for altering natural history of MDS ( Cheson, 2006 ; 
Appendix E ), withdrawsconsent, or meets any other discontinuation criteria (Section 11).
Bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood s amples will be collected  (eg, cytomorphology, 
cytogenetics analysis) and the MDS Disease Assessm ent will be repeated by the investigator at 
Extension Cycle 8, Day 1 and Day 1 of every eighth Extension Cycle thereafter (ie, Extension 
Cycle 8, 16, 24+, etc. or approximately every 24 weeks in the event of dose delays) until the 
subject is discontinued from treatment.  
A bone marrow biopsy is to be collected only when  adequate aspirate is not attainable. Whenever 
a bone marrow sample is collected, a peripheral blood smear is to be prepared.  Refer to the
Central Laboratory Manual for additional information.
In addition, information related to all tran sfusions received during the Treatment Period 
(including those received at outside institutions) should be available prior to completion of each 
MDS Disease Assessment. Clinical site staff should conti nue to confirm if any transfusions were 
received by the subject (including any at outside lo cal institutions in between study visits) prior 
to each IP administration via use of patient diary or other local procedure in place at the 
investigational site.
For subjects to continue double-blind treatment in the Extension Phase of the Treatment Period, 
each MDS Disease Assessment (criteria detailed in Section 6.2.2 ) should confirm continued 
clinical benefit and absence of disease progression per IWG criteria for altering natural history of 
MDS ( Cheson, 2006 ; Appendix E ).
Additional procedures/assessments as outlined in Section 6.2.1 will also continue in the 
Extension Phase.  The frequency of procedures/a ssessments in the Extension Phase may differ 
than the Primary Phase.  Refer to Table 4 for additional information related to required 
assessments/procedures and frequency in the Extension Phase.

time period of dose delay, the following assessments/procedures should be pe rformed:
!If dose delay is due to a laboratory or vital signs abnorm ality, the assessment that was the 
reason for the dose delay should be repeated at least on weekly basis.
!If dose delay is due to increased hemoglobin  level, perform hematology at least weekly.
!If dose delay is due to an AE, perform hematology, serum chemistry, and serum ferritin 
at least every 3 weeks thereafter and before next dose administration. 
!Pharmacokinetic (PK)/ADA samples should be collected on first day of dose delay and 
prior to IP administration on day dosing resumes.
!For males and FCBP, pregnancy counseling as detailed in Section 6.1.
Refer to the eCRF completion guidelines for detailed instructions related to eCRF data entry.
6.4. Pharmacokinetics
Blood samples will be collected to analyze luspatercept concentrations in serum in all subjects.  
At each PK time point, approximately 3 mL of blood will be collected and serum prepared as 
described in the study reference guide. Blood samp les for PK will be taken at the following visits 
during the study (also see Table 4 ): 
!Primary Phase of Treatment Period: C1D1 (must be collected before the first dose), 
C1D8, C1D15, C2D1, C4D1, C5D8 and then Day 1 of every other treatment cycle thereafter in the Primary Phase (ie, C6D1 and C8D1, if no dose delays)
!Week 25 Visit (Collect sample only if > 14 days from prior sample collection.)
!Extension Phase of Treatment Period (if applicable): Extension Phase Cycle 4, Day 1 and 
Day 1 of every fourth Extension Phase treatment cycle thereafter (eg, Extension Phase Cycles 4, 8, etc.) for up to one year from the first dose in the Primary Tr eatment Phase. 
!Posttreatment Follow-up: For subjects who do not complete Primary Treatment Phase or 
do not participate in Extension Phase or subjects who terminate the Extension Phase with 
less than 1-year ADA of moni toring, PK samples will be collected at EOT and then every 
12 weeks for up to one year from the first dose in the Primary Treatment Phase.
After the study is unblinded, PK samples may no longer be collected from subjects in the 
placebo arm. In addition, upon unblinding of the study, PK sampling at all Post-Treatment Follow-up visits may continue only if subjects’ last available ADA is positive and they have not 
reached the maximum of 1-year ADA monitoring. Pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling per 
investigator’s or sponsor’s discretion is allowed and should be recorded as an unscheduled visit.  
Detailed procedures of PK sample collection, processing, and shipping are provided in the study 
reference guide.

time point, approximately 3 mL blood will be collected and serum prepared as described in the 
study reference guide. However, during the firs t year of treatment, an additional blood draw is 
not needed for the ADA test, as the ADA test will be conducted utilizing the PK samples obtained at the same visit.  Blood samples for ADA will be taken at the following visits during 
the study (also see Table 4 ): 
!Primary Phase of Treatment Period: C1D1 (must be collected before the first dose), 
C2D1, and then Day 1 of every other treatment cycle thereafter in the Primary Phase (ie, C4D1, C6D1, and C8D1 if no dose delays).
!Week 25 Visit (Collect sample only if > 14 days from prior sample collection)
!Extension Phase of Treatment Period (if applicable): Extension Phase Cycle 4, Day 1 and 
Day 1 of every fourth Extension Phase treatment cycle thereafter (eg, Extension Phase Cycles 4, 8, 12, 16+, etc.) for up to 1 year from the first dose in the Primary Treatment 
Phase.
!Post-treatment Follow-up: For subjects who do not complete the Pr imary Treatment 
Phase or do not participate in the Ex tension Phase or subjects who terminate the 
Extension Phase with less than 1-year  of ADA monitoring, ADA samples will be 
collected at EOT and then every 12 weeks for up to one year from the first dose in the 
Primary Treatment Phase.
After the study is unblinded, ADA samples may no longer be collected from subjects in the 
placebo arm. In addition, upon unblinding of the study, ADA sampling at all Post-Treatment 
Follow-up visits may continue only if the s ubject’s last available ADA sample is positive and the 
subject has not reached the maximum of  1-year ADA monitoring.  Antidrug anti bodies (ADA)
sampling per investigator’s or sponsor’s discretion is allowed and should be recorded as an 
unscheduled visit.
Detailed procedures of ADA sample co llection, processing, and shipping are provided in the 
study reference guide.
6.6. Unscheduled Visits
Should it become necessary to repeat an evaluat ion (eg, laboratory tests or vital signs), the results 
of the repeat evaluation should be entered as an additional unscheduled visit in the eCRF.  
Refer to the eCRF completion guidelines for detailed instructions related to eCRF data entry.
6.7. End of Treatment Visit
An end of treatment (EOT) evaluation will be performed for subjects who are withdrawn from 
treatment for any reason as soon as possible af ter the decision to permanently discontinue 
treatment has been made. Evaluations will be performed as specified in the Table 4 .
If a subject is discontinued during a regular scheduled visit, all EOT procedures should be 
completed at that visit. If a procedure had been performed within 7 days of the EOT visit, it does 
not need to be repeated unless clinically indicated pe r investigator discretion (with the exception 
of blood pressure assessment and sample co llection for h ematology, chemistry, and urinalysis).

marrow procedure.  End of Treatment (EOT) Visit procedures/assessments may occur at 42 Day 
Follow-up assessment if subject is discontinued within +/- 7 days of 42 Day Follow-up 
assessment.
The reason for discontinuation will be recorded in the eCRF and in the source document for all 
randomized subjects, regardless of whether they are dosed or not. Reasons for treatment 
discontinuation are provided in Section 11.1.
6.8. Posttreatment Follow-up Period 
6.8.1. Safety Follow-up
All subjects discontinued from protocol-prescribed therapy for any reason will be followed for a 
period of 42 days after the last dose of IP for AE reporting, as well as SAEs made known to the 
Investigator at any time thereafter that ar e suspected of being related to IP.
Females of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant for 12 weeks after the last 
dose of IP and male subjects should avoid fathering a child for 12 weeks after the last dose of IP. 
Refer to Section 10for additional details.
6.8.2. Long-Term Follow-up
Transfusion data collection will continue up until 16 weeks from the date of last dose of IP or 16 
weeks after the End of Treatment Visit (whichever is later).  
For subjects who do not complete the Primary Treatment Phase or do not participate in the 
Extension Phase or subjects who terminate the Extension Phase with less than 1-year of ADA monitoring, ADA and PK samples will be collected at EOT and then every 12 weeks for up to 
one year from the first dose in the Primary Treatment Phase (please refer to Section 6.4and 
Section 6.5).
All subjects discontinued from protocol-prescribed therapy for any reason should be followed for 
progression to AML, other malignancies/pre-malignancies, survival and subsequent MDS 
therapies.
Subjects who discontinue from treatment for any reason will be followed via telephone contact 
by the site for collection of data on survival, cause(s) of death, progression to AML, other 
malignancies/pre-malignancies (please refer to Section 10.5 for details), post-treatment therapy 
(ies) for MDS at the 42-Day and 12-Week Follow-up assessments and then every 3 months after 
the 12 Week Follow-up assessment for at least 3 years after last dose of IP or until death, lost to 
follow-up or withdrawal of consent from the study. Refer to Table of Events, Section 5, Table 4 .
Data regarding subsequent MDS therapies,  determination of AML progression and other 
malignancies/pre-malignancies, (refer to Section 6.1and Section 10.5 for additional details), and 
date and cause of death will be recorded in the eCRF.  The investigator must make every effort 
to obtain information regarding the subject’s survival status before determining the subject is lost 
to follow-up. If the subject is discontinued from Long-Term Follow-up, the reason for 
discontinuation should be recorded on the End of Study eCRF.

Confidential and Propri etary 67 ACE-536-MDS-001 Amendment 2.0 Final: 09 May 2017Long-term follow-up may be conducted by record review (including public records if allowed by 
local regulations) and/or telephone contact with the subject, family, or the subject’s treating 
physician.
6.9. Efficacy Assessments
Treatment response will be assessed locally by the investigator in accordance with IWG 2006 
criteria for MDS ( Cheson, 2006 ; Appendix E ) with modifications for the erythroid response 
criteria through transfusion assessments, hemato logy laboratory parameters, peripheral bl ood 
smear, bone marrow aspirates and/or biopsies, and cytogenetics.
Other efficacy assessments will include serum ferritin, concomitant iron chelation therapy use, 
health-r elated qu ality of life, .  
Efficacy data will also be reviewed by an external unblinded DMC and/or external blinded 
Steering Committee as specified time points detailed in each committees’ respective charters.  
Bone marrow aspirate (or biops y, if adequate aspirate is not attainable) samples for assessing 
treatment response will be collected at the fre quency specified in the Table of Events, S ection 5, 
Table 4 .  Whenever a bone marrow sample is collected, a stained peripheral blood smear is to be 
prepared.
Cytogenetic testing is to be completed whenever a bone marrow aspirate is obtained for 
assessment of cytogenetic response in accordance with IWG 2006 criteria for MDS ( Cheson,
2006 ; Appendix E ).  Bone marrow biopsy can be used for cytogenetics testing if adequate 
aspirate is not attainable (note that specific handling of the biopsy is required for cytogenetics 
testing).
6.10. Safety Assessments
The safety measures assessed are routinely used in clinical studies evaluating the safety of investigational product for hematologic malignan cies. Safety assessments, including (but not 
limited to) physical examination, vital signs, ECG, urinalysis, hematology, serum chemistry, 
pregnancy testing (for FCBP subjects only), AEs, concomitant medications and procedures, and 
transfusion data collection and assessment, will be performed at the frequency specified in Table 4 or more frequently if clinically indicated.

6.12. Subject Reported Outcomes or Quality of Life Measurements
The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life questionnaire 
(EORTC QLQ-C30) ( Aaronson, 1993; Appendix F ) is a valid ated health -related qu ality of life
(HRQoL) measure applicable to subjects with any cancer diagnosis. It is composed of 30 items that address general physical symptoms, physical functioning, fatigue and malaise, and social 
and emotional functioning. Subscale scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, with higher 
scores on functional scales indicating better function and higher score on symptom scales indicating worse symptoms. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is available in many languages. This 
instrument takes 10 to 15 minutes to administer. 
  
 
 
  All eligible subjects will complete the EORTC QLQ-C30  at the frequency 
noted in the Table of Events, Section 5, Table 4.
For the C1D1 visit, if the subject completed the Screening Visit EORTC QLQ-C30  
questionnaires within 14 days prior to C1D1, they do not have to be repeated at C1D1. If 
performed on C1D1, both EORTC QLQ-C30  que stionnaires should be completed by 
the subject prior to IP administration.
It is important that every subject comple te all of the EORTC QLQ-C30 assessments 
at every specified time point to minimize the amount of missing data.

Confidential and Propri etary 70 ACE-536-MDS-001 Amendment 2.0 Final: 09 May 20177. DESCRIPTION OF STUDY TREATMENTS
7.1. Description of Investigational Products
Luspatercept will be provided by the Sponsor. Luspatercept for injection is formulated as a 
sterile, preservative-free, lyophilized cake/powde r.  Luspatercept for injection is available in 2 
fill sizes, and when reconstituted, each consists of 50 mg/mL luspatercept in a 10 mM citrate 
buffer-based solution (10 mM citrate, pH 6.5, 9% sucrose, 0.02% polysorbate 80).  The drug 
product is packaged in a 3 mL glass vial in the following f ill sizes:  
!25 mg/vial:  The 25 mg/vial presentation contains 37.5 mg of luspatercept protein.  
After reconstitution with 0.68 mL water for injection (WFI), each single-use vial will deliver at least 0.5 mL of 50 mg/mL luspatercept (25 mg)
!75 mg/vial:  The 75 mg/vial presentati on contains 87.5 mg of luspatercept protein. 
After reconstitution with 1.6 mL WFI, each single-use vial will deliver at least 1.5 mL of 50 mg/mL luspatercept (75 mg)
The recommended storage condition for Luspatercept for Injection (25 mg/vial and 75 mg/vial; 
lyophilized powder formulation) is 2°C to 8°C. It is recommended that the reconstituted 
luspatercept for injection, at room temperature, be  administered immediately.  However, it may 
be held for up to 10 hours at 2°C to 8°C.  If not used immediately, the total in-use time of the 
reconstituted luspatercept for injection, from reconstitution to administration, must not exceed 10 
hours.
Samples of luspatercept drug product, held at the recommended storage condition, have been 
shown to be stable through the labeled shelf-life.
Placebo to be used in the study will be sterile normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride for injection) 
subcutaneous.  Sterile, normal s aline s hould be s upplied by the site. The investigational site’s 
designated individuals will prepare the placebo syringes to match the active syringes. The 
investigator and subject will be blinded. The manufacturer’s directions for storage and handling are to be followed, as are standard clinical practices for ensuring sterility of the placebo.
7.2. Treatment Administration and Schedule
There will be unblinded designated site personnel at each site responsible for preparing the 
investigational product.  Luspatercept or placebo will be administered as a subcutaneous injection to subjects by the study staff at the clinical site and administration will be documented 
in the subject’s source record.  Subjects must have Hgb, blood pressure and weight assessed 
prior to each IP administration. Clinical site staff should also confirm if any transfusions were 
received by the subject (including a ny at outside local institutions in between study visits) prior 
to each IP administration via use of patient diary or other local procedure in place at the 
investigational site.
Subcutaneous injections will be given in the upper arm, thigh, and/or abdomen. Calculated doses 
requiring reconstituted volume greater than 1.2 mL should be divided into separate similar 
volume injections across separate sites using the same anatomical location but on opposite sides of the body (example left thigh and right thi gh).  The maximum volume per SC injection should

which results in 3.36 mL maximum total volume after reconstitution.
The injection sites can be rotated according to Investigator judgment, and the injections can be 
given in the following order as needed, for example: 1) right upper arm, 2) left upper arm, 3) right upper thigh, 4) left upper thigh.
Eligible subjects will be rando mized at a 2:1 ratio to either:
!Experimental Arm: Luspatercept (ACE-536): Starting dose 1.0 mg/kg subcutaneously 
injection every 3 weeks (administered on Day 1 of each 21-day treatment cycle).  
Luspatercept clinical drug product will be provided by the Sponsor as a lyophilized 
powder.  Luspatercept will be administered after reconstitution as a subcutaneous 
injection to subjects by the study staff at the clinical site.
OR
!Control Arm: Placebo (Volume equivalent to experimental arm) subcutaneously 
injection every 3 weeks (administered on Day 1 of each 21-day treatment cycle).  
Placebo (normal saline) product will be provided by the local investigational site.
7.2.1. Dose Modifications: Dose Titration, Dose Reduction, and Dose Delay
7.2.1.1. Dose Titration Increase
Starting as soon as Cycle 3 Day 1 and assessed by the investigator prior to every subsequent 
treatment cycle, subjects may have the dose level increased in a stepwise manner beyond the 
starting dose of 1.0 mg/kg to 1.33 mg/kg, and up to  a maximum of 1.75 mg/kg, but the maximum 
total dose should not exceed 168 mg, during both the Primary and Extension Phases of the 
Treatment Period if all the following criteria are met:
!Subject has ≥ 1 RBC transfusion event (for pretransfusion Hgb of < 9.0 g/dL) during the 
2 most recent prior treatment cycles (~6-weeks).
!The two most recent prior treatment cycles assessed must be at the same dose level.
!Subject must not have met protocol dose delay and/or reduction criteria in the two most 
recent treatment cycles (exception of dose delay required due to influence of RBC transfusions).  Refer to Table 6 , footnote b .
If all criteria above are met, the dose may be increased by 1 dose level.
The dose level should be titrated individually for each subject and must not exceed 1.75 mg/kg.
Starting dose with dose increases and reducti ons are presented below for reference ( Table 5 ).

hThe investigator may contact the Medical Monitor prior to making decision regarding treatment discontinuation.
7.2.1.3. Overdose 
Overdose, as defined for this protocol, refers to luspatercept dosing only.  On a per dose basis, an
overdose is defined as the following amount over the protocol-specified dose of luspatercept 
assigned to a given subject, regardless of any associated adverse events or sequelae.  
Subcutaneous 10% over the protocol-specified dose
On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as anything more frequent than the 
protocol required schedule or frequency.  Complete data about drug administration, including any overdose, regardless of whether the overdose was accidental or intentional, should be 
reported in the eCRF.  See Section 10.1 for the reporting of adverse events associated with

Confidential and Propri etary 74 ACE-536-MDS-001 Amendment 2.0 Final: 09 May 20177.3. Method of Treatment Assignment
The treatment assignment (randomization) will occur at the end of the Screening Period, once all 
the required screening procedures have been completed and subject is deemed eligible to 
participate in the study based on assessment of all prot ocol inclusion and exclusion criteria.  This 
study will utilize the IRT for enrollment. 
Designated research personnel at each investigational site will be assigned password protected, 
coded identification numbers which gives them  the authorization to call into IRT to enroll 
subjects.  For drug assignment at each dose start and in the event of any dose reduction, dose 
titration site staff must contact IRT to record the new dose level and obtain the new study 
treatment assignment.
The relationship of the randomization number to the sub ject identification (ID) number will be 
described by a ra ndomizatio n algorithm. The randomization algorithm will be employed by the 
IRT system to assign a subject to a treatment based on the prespecified rules, such us double 
blind study, stratified randomization with randomization ratio active versus placebo on a 2:1; subjects will be placed into the appropriate stratum per the responses/data entered/collected for 
questions collecting stratification and based on the combination of these d ata points, the IRT will 
place the subject in the next available slot within the appropriate stratum for that subject.  TheIRT will be ut ilized to ensure an equal weight central randomization based on randomization 
method according to stratification factors defined in Section 3.1,Study Design. The 
randomization number corres ponds to a particular treatment arm within a stratum. The 
randomization number, by itself, w ill not unblind a user to the subject’s treatment. The 
randomizatio n number should be coupled with all the unblinded code information, in order the 
subject to become unblinded.
7.4. Packaging and Labeling
The IP will be labeled per local requirements.
7.4.1. Blinding
For this trial, all subjects, study site staff and Celgene Corporation representatives with the 
exception of designated individuals (eg, the pharmacist at the investigational site, the 
bioanalytical laboratory), will remain blinded to  all treatment assignments until all subjects have 
completed the study, or at the time the study is unblinded (per DMC recommendation) and the 
database is locked.
Placebo will not be supplied for luspatercept. The designated site individual (for example the 
pharmacist) at the investigational site will use a syringe (that exactly matches the syringe used 
for reconstituted luspatercept) and sterile normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride for injection) to 
prepare a matching placebo. Thus, the designated site individual at the Investigational site will be unblinded and will give Investigators and their staff luspatercept and placebo in a blinded 
manner.
Randomization, drug dispensing, dose reduction/titration, and drug discontinuation will be 
accomplished by an IRT system. Authorized site personnel must contact the IRT for 
randomization, study drug assignment at the beginning of each cycle, to register dose reductions

investigational site and Celgene.
For emergency unblinding refer to Section 12.2.
If applicable, include information in this section regarding the physical aspect of blinding related 
to the packaging and labeling.
7.5. Investigational Product Accountability and Disposal 
Accountability for study drug that is administr ated during the course of the study is the 
responsibility of the Investigator or  designee.  Investigational clinical supplies must be received 
by a designated person at the clinical site and kept in a secure and temperature-controlled 
location.  The investigational site must maintain accurate records demonstrating dates and 
amounts of study drug received, to whom it was administered (subject-by-subject accounting), and accounts of any luspatercept accidentally or deliberately destroyed or returned.  Accurate 
recording of all IP administration will be made in the appropriate section of the subject’s eCRF 
and source documents.  Unless otherwise notified, all vials of study drug, both used and unused, must be saved for drug accountability.  The used v ials may be discarded, per the institution’s 
standard practice, after drug accountab ility has been comp leted by the monitor.  The Investigator 
must return all unused vials of study drug to the Sponsor at the end of the study, or the study 
drug may be destroyed at the clinical site with th e permission of the Sponsor.  For either 
scenario, the outcome must be documented on the drug accountability log.  The Sponsor will 
provide direction fo r the outcome of all unused vials.
Celgene (or designee) will review with the Inve stigator and relevant site personnel the process 
for investigational product return, disposal, and/or destruction including responsibilities for the 
site versus Celgene (or designee).
7.6. Investigational Product Compliance
Study drug will be administered as a subcutaneous injection at the clinical site by the study staff.  
Monitoring for subject compliance with the treatment regimen is therefore unnecessary.
Accurate recording of all IP administration will be made in the appropriate section of the 
subject’s eCRF and source documents.
The Investigator or designee is responsible for accounting for all IP that is administered during 
the course of the study.

Over the course of this study, additional medications may be required to manage aspects of the 
disease state of the subjects, including side e ffects from trial treatments or disease progression. 
Supportive care, including but not limited to anti-emetic medications, may be administered at the 
discretion of the Investigator. 
All prior/concomitant treatments used from 5 w eeks prior to first dose of IP until 42 days after 
the last dose of IP (or the End of Treatment (EOT) Visit, whichever occurs later) must be 
reported on the eCRF. 
All prior procedures within the 8 weeks prior to randomization will be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF(s).
Prior G-CSF/GM-CSF and iron chelation ther apy should be recorded o n the appropriate eCRF(s) 
regardless of treatment discontinuation date.
Prior anti-cancer treatments should be r ecorded on the appropriate eCRF(s) regardless of 
treatment discontinuation/procedure date.
If a subject requires treatment with any new medications that are specifically excluded in 
Section 8.2, the subject will be discontinued from treatment and should complete the end of 
treatment visit and enter the posttreatment follow- up period of the study. The Investigator should 
consult the medical monitor regarding any questio ns about whether a new medication or dosage 
of existing medication would require the subject to discontinue from the study. 
For information regarding other drugs that may interact with IP and affect its metabolism, 
pharmacokinetics, or excretion, please see the Investigators Brochure and/or local package insert.
8.1. Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures
Granulocyte colony stimulating factors (ie, G-CSF, GM-CSF) are allowed only in cases of neutropenic fever or as clinically indicated per product label.
Concurrent corticosteroids used for medical conditions other than MDS is allowed provided 
subject is on a stable or decreasing dose for ≥ 1 week prior to randomization.
Administration of attenuated vaccines (eg, influen za vaccine) is allowed if clinically indicated,
per investigator discretion.  
8.1.1. Iron Chelation Therapy
Subjects who are using iron-chelating therapies at time of randomization should be on a stable or 
decreasing dose for at least 8 weeks.  
Concurrent treatment with iron chelation therapies during the Treatment Period is allowed at the 
discretion of the investigator and is recommended to be used per product label.
8.1.2. RBC Transfusions
Concurrent treatment for anemia with blood transfusions is allowed, at the discretion of the 
Investigator, for low hemoglobin levels, symptoms  associated with ane mia (eg, hemodynamic or

transfusion.
Each subject will have a “pre-trans fusion hemoglobin threshold” for requiring transfusion during 
the study which will be determined based on transfusion history. Baseline pre-transfusion hemoglobin threshold will be the mean of all documented pre-transfusion hemoglobin values 
during the 16 weeks prior to Dose 1 Day 1. During treatment, if the pre-transfusion hemoglobin 
level is increased by ≥ 1 g/dL (at the time of a next anticipated transfusion event) compared to 
the pre-transfusion hemoglobin threshold for that subject, transfusion should be d elayed by a 
minimum of 7 days and/or the number of units transfused should be reduced by 1 or more RBC 
units. Subjects may be transfused at the Investigator’s discretion for symptoms related to anemia or other requiremen ts (eg, infection).
8.2. Prohibited Concomitant Medications and Procedures
Best supportive care for this study specifically excludes cancer surgery, immunotherapy, 
biologic therapy, radiotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy where the goal is to eradicate or slow the progression of the disease.
The following concomitant medications are specifically excluded during the course of the study:

Protocol ACE-536-MDS-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 78 ACE-536-MDS-001 Amendment 2.0 Final: 09 May 20179. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
9.1. Overview
This is a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placeb o-controlled, multicenter study to determine 
the efficacy and safety of luspatercept (ACE-536) versus placebo in subjects with anemia due to 
very low, low, or intermediate MDS with ring sideroblasts who require RBC transfusions. 
The design of the study, including the proposed targeted subject population, study endpoints, and 
statistical plan, is discussed below.
9.2. Study Population Definitions
Study populations to be analyzed are defined as follow: 
Intent-to-treat (ITT): The intent-to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all randomized 
subjects regardless of whether or not the subject received IP. 
Safety: The Safety Population w ill consist of all subjects who were randomized and received at 
least one dose of IP.  Subjects will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the IP they actually received.
Statistical methods to handle missing data will be described in the statist ical analysis plan (SAP).
The SAP will describe any predefined rules for including/excluding any subjects with data from any analyses (eg, time windows, visit by visit analysis, endpoint analysis, protocol violation).
9.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations
A total sample size of 210 (140 in experimental arm [luspatercept (ACE-536)], 70 in control arm [placebo]) will have 90% power to detect the difference between a response rate of 0.30 in the experimental arm (luspatercept [ACE-536]) and a response rate of 0.10 in the control arm 
(placebo).  The sample size calculation is based on one-sided alpha of 0.025, test statistics on 
difference of proportions using pooled estimate of variance and 10% dropout rate. 
9.4. Randomization and Stratification
A 2:1 rando mization w ill be used as this is an orphan disease with a limited number of subjects 
available. Subjects will be randomized to receive luspatercept or placebo at a 2:1 ratio. A 2:1 randomization sch eme would enrich the number of participants exposed to the active treatment 
group ( Dumville, 2006 ). 
Subjects will be randomized to receive luspatercept or placebo at a 2:1 ratio. Randomization will 
be accomplished by an IRT to ensure timely registration and randomization. A stratified 
randomization schedule will be implemented. Randomization w ill be stratified by baseline RBC 
transfusion burden and baseline IPSS-R risk category ( Greenberg, 2012; Appendix D ). 
Stratification will be based on the following factors:
!RBC transfusion burden at baseline
∀≥ 6 RBC units/8 weeks (mean of the two consecutive 8 weeks periods 
immediately prior to randomization)

9.5. Background and Demographic Characteristics
Subjects’ age, height, weight, and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics, while gender, race and other categorical variables will be provided using frequency tabulations by dose cohort.  Prior transfusion hi story will be summarized.  Medical history data 
will be summarized using frequency tabulations by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) system organ class and preferred term.  Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
diagnoses as well as RBC transfusion dependence will be summarized using frequency 
tabulations.
9.6. Subject Disposition
Subject disposition (analysis population allo cation, entered, discontinued, along with pr imary 
reason for discontinuation) will be summarized using frequency and percent for both treatment 
and follow-up phases.  A summary of subjects enrolled by site will be provided. Protocol 
deviations will be summarized using frequency tabulations.
9.7. Efficacy Analysis
9.7.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis
The primary efficacy analysis will be the comparison of the response rates in the two treatment 
arms in ITT population. The primary efficacy endpoint of transfusion independent response is 
defined as the absence of any RBC transfusion during any consecutive 56 day period during the 
Primary Phase of the Treatment Period (first 24 weeks of double-blind treatment) ie, days 1 to 56, days 2 to 57, days 3 to 58, etc.
Subjects discontinued from the Primary Phase of the Treatment Period without achieving at least 
56 days consecutive of RBC transfusion independence will be counted as non-responders. 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, 56-day RBC tran sfusion independence, the response rate will 
be calculated using the number of responders divided by number of subjects in the ITT 
population (responders pl us non-responders). The response rates of the subjects who were 
randomized to luspatercept and the placebo will be calculated. In the primary efficacy analysis,

(CMH) test will be used to test the difference between the 2 response rates at a 1-sided 
significance level of 0.025 with rando mization factors as strata. 
Additional details will be outlined in the SAP.
9.7.2. Secondary Efficacy Analyses9.7.2.1. Key Secondary Efficacy Analyses
The key secondary endpoint, proportion of subjects achieving RBC-TI with duration ≥ 12 weeks, 
will be tested in the same manner as primary efficacy endpoint using the CMH test.
The analyses for the key secondary endpoint will be based on the ITT population. In order to 
perform hypothesis testing on multiple endpoints while controlling the overall Type I error rate, 
a sequential testing approach will be employed where the order of the endpoints to be tested are 
pre-specified. The primary efficacy endpoint will be tested first at the one-sided 0.025 significance level. If superiority of luspatercept is demonstrated for the primary efficacy 
endpoint then the key secondary endpoint will be tested, at a one-sided 0.025 significance level.
Proportion of subjects achieving RBC-TI with duration ≥ 12 weeks is the absence of any 
RBC transfusion during any consecutive 84 day period during the Treatment Period (Weeks 1-
24; Weeks 1-48), ie, days 1 to 84, days 2 to 85, days 3 to 86, etc. Subjects discontinued from the 
Treatment Period without achieving at least 84 consecutive days of RBC transfusion independence will be counted as non-responders. 
Full details will be included in the SAP.
9.7.2.2. Additional Secondary Efficacy Analyses
Other secondary variables will be analyzed descriptively, unless otherwise specified, and will be 
based on the ITT population. Kaplan-Meier methods will be used to estimate curves for time to 
event secondary variables. Counts and percentages will be used to describe categorical secondary variables. 
Hemoglobin (Hgb) increase ≥ 1.0 g/dL is defined as proportion of subjects with ≥ 1.0 g/dL Hgb 
increase compared to baseline that is sustained over any consecutive 56-day period in the 
absence of RBC transfusions.
Total RBC units transfused over 16 weeks is defined as the total number of RBC units 
transfused over a fixed period of 16 weeks (weeks 9-24; weeks 32-48) compared to the total 
number of RBC units transfused in the 16 weeks immediately prior to randomization.
Proportion of subjects achieving RBC-TI with duration ≥ 8 weeks (Weeks 1-48) is the 
absence of any RBC transfusion during any consecutive 56-day period during the Treatment 
Period (Weeks 1-48).
Proportion of subjects achieving modified erythroid response (mHI-E) is defined as 
proportion of subjects meeting modified HI-E criteria ( Cheson, 2006 ; Appendix E ) sustained 
over any consecutive 56-day period duri ng the Treatment Peri od. Red blood cell (RBC)
transfusions administered for  a pre-transfusion Hgb of > 9.0 g/dL will count in the RBC 
transfusion response evaluation.

Confidential and Propri etary 81 ACE-536-MDS-001 Amendment 2.0 Final: 09 May 2017Duration of RBC-TI will be determined only for subjects who achieve RBC TI ≥ 8 weeks on 
treatment. Duration of RBC-TI is defined as the longest RBC-TI period during the Treatment 
Period.  Subjects who maintain RBC-TI through the end of the Treatment Period will be 
censored at the date of treatment discontinuation or death, whichever occurs first. 
Time to RBC-TI will be su mmarized only for subjects who achieve RBC TI ≥ 8 weeks on 
treatment. It is defined as the time between randomization and the date onset of TI is first 
observed (ie, Day 1 of 56 days without any RBC transfusions). 
Proportion of subjects achieving hematological response to neutrophils (HI-N) is defined as 
proportion of subjects meeting HI-N criteria ( Cheson, 2006 ; Appendix E ) sustained over any 
consecutive 56-day period during the Treatment Period.
Proportion of subjects achieving hematological response to platelets (HI-P) is defined as 
proportion of subjects meeting HI-P criteria ( Cheson, 2006 ; Appendix E ) sustained over any 
consecutive 56-day period during the Treatment Period.
Mean Change in Mean Daily Dose of Iron Chelation Therapy (ICT)
The change in daily dose for each subject is calculated as the difference of post-baseline mean 
daily dose and baseline mean daily dose. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to compare the treatment difference between groups, with the stratification factors and baseline ICT 
value as covariates.
Mean Serum Ferritin Decrease
The change is calculated as the difference of post-baseline mean serum ferritin and baseline 
mean serum ferritin. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to compare the treatment
difference between groups, with the stratification factors and baseline serum ferritin value ascovariates.
Time to progression to AML is defined as the time between randomization and first diagnosis 
of AML as per WHO classification of ≥ 20% blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow.  
Subjects with diagnosis of AML will be considered to have had an event.  Subjects who have not 
progressed to AML at the time of analysis will be censored at the last assessment date which 
does not indicate progression to AML.
Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time b etween rando mization and d eath/censored date.  
Subjects who die, regardless of the cause of death, will be considered to have had an event.  
Subjects who are alive at the time of analysis will be censored at the last assessment date at which the subject was known to be alive. All subjects who were lost to follow-up will also be 
censored at the time of last contact.
Full analysis details will be included in the SAP.
9.8. Safety Analysis
All safety analyses will be performed on the safety population. Full details will be included in 
the SAP. Planned data presentations and analyses include the following:
Adverse events will be coded using MedDRA. Adverse event listings will include the verbatim

Clinical laboratory results will be summarized descriptively by treatment group. Clinically 
significant hematologic and non-hematologic la boratory abnormalities will be listed and 
summarized according to the NCI CTCAE (version 4.03) by treatment group.
Physical examination data and vital sign measurements, including body weight, will be listed for 
each subject at each visit. Descriptive statistics for vital signs, both observed values and changes from baseline, will be summarized by treatment group.
9.9. Other Analysis
Change in health related quality of life questionnaires utilizing EORTC QLQ-C30 
, changes from baseline in overall score and sub-scores will be analyzed and compared between 
treatment groups using repeated measures of An alysis of Variance (ANOVA)/ANCOVA using 
the screening scores as covariates where appropriate.  Various schemes will be assessed for 
missing data imputation.
 
 
 
 
 
9.10. Timing of Analyses
9.10.1. Interim Analysis 
An interim analysis to assess futility w ill be performed when approximately 105 subjects have 
completed the Primary Phase of the Treatment Period (first 24 weeks of double-blind treatment) 
or discontinued before reaching 24 weeks of double-blind treatment (50% information for primary endpoint). There will be no plan to claim luspatercept superiority based on efficacy 
results so the type one error rate remain s at 0.025 one-sided for the final analysis. 
Conditional power for primary endpoint will be calculated assuming the observed trend 
continues for the rest of the data. If it is 10% (corresponding to a fut ility boundary of p-value 
≥0.201 using beta-spending function) or less, with confirmative data for secondary and other 
efficacy endpoints, the DMC may recommend stopping the study for fut ility.
This interim analysis will be performed by an independent statistician not affiliated with the 
study. The sponsor will remain blinded throughout the study.

10.1. Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events
An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen 
in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening 
concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject’s health, including 
laboratory test values (as specifi ed by the criteria in Section 10.3), regardless of etiology. Any 
worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse ch ange in the frequency or intensity of a pre-
existing condition) should be considered an AE .  A diagnosis or syndrome  should be recorded on 
the AE page of the eCRF rather than the indi vidual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or 
syndrome. 
Abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to an investigational product should be reported as an 
AE. Overdose, accidental or intentional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be reported on the overdose eCRF. (See Section 7.2.1.2 for the definition of overdose.) Any 
sequela of an accidental or intentional overdose of an investigational product should be reported 
as an AE on the AE eCRF. If the sequela of an overdose is an SAE, then the sequela must be reported on an SAE report form and on the AE e CRF. The overdose resulting in the SAE should 
be identified as the cause of the event on the SAE report form and eCRF but should not be 
reported as an SAE itself.
In the event of overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive 
supportive measures as necessary. There is no known specific antidote for luspatercept overdose. 
Actual treatment shoul d depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and 
experience of the treating physician.
All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study.  Assessments may include monitoring 
of any or all of the following parameters:  the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory, pathological, radiological or surgical findings , physical examination findings, or findings from 
other tests and/or procedures.
All AEs will be recorded by the Investigator from the time the subject signs informed consent 
until 42 days after the last dose of IP as well as those SAEs made known to the Investigator at 
any time thereafter that are suspected of being related to IP.  Adverse events (AEs) and SAEs 
will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF and in the subject’s source documents.  All SAEs must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the 
event by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved 
equivalent form.  
10.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events
A qualified Investigator will evaluate all adverse events as to: 
10.2.1. Seriousness 
An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that:

Protocol ACE-536-MDS-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 86 ACE-536-MDS-001 Amendment 2.0 Final: 09 May 2017!Is life-threatening (ie, in the opinion of the Investigator, the subject is at immediate risk 
of death from the AE);
!Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of ex isting hospitalization 
(hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay);
!Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions);
!Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;
!Constitutes an important medical event.
Important medical events are defined as those occ urrences that may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death, hospitalization, or disability, but may jeopardize the subject or 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be 
considered serious.
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospitalizations for:
!a standard procedure for protocol therapy administration.  However, hospitalization or 
prolonge d hospitalization for a complication of therapy administration will be reported as 
an SAE. 
!routine treatment or monitoring of the stud ied indication not associated with any 
deterioration in condition.
!the administration of blood or platelet transfusion as routine treatment of studied 
indication.  However, hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE.
!a procedure for protocol/disease-related investigations (eg, surgery, scans, endoscopy, 
sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow sampling).  However, hospitalization or 
prolonge d hospitalization for a complication of such procedures remains a reportable
SAE.
!hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization for technical, practical, or social 
reasons, in absence of an AE.
!a procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to start of treatment on study); must be 
documented in the source document and the eCRF.  Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication remains a reportable SAE.
!an elective treatment of or an elective procedure for a pre-existing condition, unrelated to 
the studied indication, that has not worsened from baseline. 
!emergency outpatient treatment or observation that does not result in admission, unless 
fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the eCRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed.

Protocol ACE-536-MDS-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 87 ACE-536-MDS-001 Amendment 2.0 Final: 09 May 2017For each SAE, the Investigator will provide information on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to the IP, action taken regarding the IP, and outcome.
10.2.2. Severity/Intensity
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator must assess the severity/ intensity of the event. 
The severity/intensity of AEs will be graded based upon the subject’s symptoms according to the 
current active minor version of the Common Terminol ogy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, 
Version 4.0); http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40
Adverse events that are not defined in the CTCAE should be evaluated for severity/intensity 
according to the following scale:
!Grade 1 = Mild – transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required
!Grade 2 = Moderate – mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may be 
needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required
!Grade 3 = Severe – marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; 
medical intervention/therapy requi red, hospitalization is possible
!Grade 4 = Life-threatening – extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance 
required; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization or hospice care probable
!Grade 5 = Death - the event results in death
The term “severe” is often used to describe th e intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  This criterion is notthe same as “serious” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or functioning.  
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining regulatory obligations.
10.2.3. Causality
The Investigator must determine the relationship between the administration of the IP and the 
occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: a causal relationship of the adverse event to IP administration is 
unlikely or remote , or other medications, therapeutic 
interventions, or underlying c onditions provide a sufficient 
explanation for the observed event.
Suspected: there is a reasonable possibility that the administration of IP 
caused the adverse event.  ‘Reasonable possibility’ means there 
is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IP and 
the adverse event.

Protocol ACE-536-MDS-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 88 ACE-536-MDS-001 Amendment 2.0 Final: 09 May 2017Causality s hould be a ssessed and provided for every AE/SAE based on currently available 
information.  Causality is to be reassessed and provided as additional information becomes 
available.
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or additional IP 
that has not been manufactured or provided by Celgene, please provide the name of the 
manufacturer when reporting the event.
10.2.4. Duration
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the 
event.
10.2.5. Action Taken
The Investigator will report the action taken with IP as a result of an AE or SAE, as applicable 
(eg, discontinuation, interruption, or dose reduction of IP, as appropriate) and report if concomitant and/or additional treatments were given for the event. 
10.2.6. Outcome
The Investigator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs.
All SAEs that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study 
must be followed until recovered (returned to baseline), recovered with sequelae, or death (due to 
the SAE).
10.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the abnormality:
!results in discontinuation from the study;
!requires treatment, modification/ interruption of IP dose, or any other therapeutic 
intervention; or
!is judged to be of significant clinical importance, eg, one that indicates a new disease 
process and/or organ toxicity, or is an exacerbation or worsening of an existing 
condition.
Regardless of severity grade, only laboratory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a serious adverse event.
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF.  If the abnormality was not a part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laborat ory abnormality should be recorded as the AE. 
If possible, the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as a medical term and not simply as an 
abnormal laboratory result (eg, record throm bocytopenia rather than decreased platelets).
10.4. Pregnancy
All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in either a female subject of childbearing 
potential or partner of childbearing potential of a male subject are immediately reportable events .

Protocol ACE-536-MDS-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 89 ACE-536-MDS-001 Amendment 2.0 Final: 09 May 201710.4.1. Females of Childbearing Potential:
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including elevated βhCG or positive pregnancy test in a 
female subject of childbearing potential regardless of disease state) occurring while the subject is 
on IP, or within 12 weeks of th e subject’s last dose of IP, are considered immediately reportable 
events.  Investigational product is to be discontinued immediately. The pregnancy, suspected 
pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by 
email, phone or facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the Pregnancy Initial Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  
The female subject may be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist or another appropriate 
healthcar e professional for further evaluation.
The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify Celgene Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or 
abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow -up Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous abortion), the Investigator 
should report the abnormal outcome as an AE.  If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious 
criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safety by facsimile, or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report 
Form, or approved equivalent form.
All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported, without regard to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant d eath after 28 days that the Investigator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safety by 
facsimile, or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
10.4.2. Male Subjects
If a female partner of a male subject taking IP becomes pregnant, the male subject taking IP 
should notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female partner should be advised to call their 
healthcare provider immediately.  
Males will be advised to use a male latex condom or nonlatex condom NOT made out of natural 
(animal) membrane (for example, polyurethane), during any sexual contact with FCBP prior to 
starting investigational product and continue for 12 weeks following the last dose of IP, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.
10.5. Other Malignancies/Pre-malignancies
Events of new malignancy, pre-malignant lesions (excluding benign tumors or benign neoplasia) are to be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved 
equivalent form. All SAE criteria (eg, hospitalization) should be marked if applicable, and all 
events must be marked as an “Important Medical Event” even if no other serious criteria apply; these events must also be documented in the appropriate page(s) of the CRF and subject’s source 
documents.  Documentation related to the diagnos is of malignancy must be provided at the time 
of reporting as a serious adverse event (eg, any confirmatory histology or cytology results, X-
rays, CT scans, etc.).

Protocol ACE-536-MDS-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 90 ACE-536-MDS-001 Amendment 2.0 Final: 09 May 2017Malignancies or cancerous tumors are lesions capable of invading into adjacent tissues, and may 
be capable of spreading to distant tissues. A benign tumor has none of those properties.
Malignancy or cancer is characterized by anaplasia, invasiveness, and metastasis.  For the 
Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) studies, these al so include progression to high/very high risk 
of MDS (per IPSS-R; Greenberg, 2012 ); myeloproliferation (eg, clinically significant increases 
in blasts), progression to AML, etc.
Premalignant or precancerous lesions refer to a state of disordered m orphology of cells  that is 
associated with an increased risk of cancer. If left untreated, these conditions may lead to cancer. 
Such conditions are usually either dysplasia or benign neoplasia (and the dividing line between 
those is sometimes blurry). Sometimes the term "precancer" is used to describe carcinoma in situ, which is a noninvasive cancer that has not progressed to an aggressive, invasive stage. Not 
all carcinoma in situ w ill progress to invasive disease.
Premalignant lesions are morphologically at ypical tissue which appears abnormal under 
microscopic examination, and in which cancer is more likely to occur than in its apparently 
normal counterpart.
10.6. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF.  All SAEs must be reported to 
Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event by facsimile, 
or other appropriate method (eg, via email), using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  This instruction pertains to initial SAE reports as well as any follow-up reports.
The Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.  
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to IP) that occur during the study (from the time the subject  signs informed consent until 42 days after the last dose of IP) or any 
SAE made known to the Investigator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being related to 
IP.  Serious adverse events occurring prior to treatment (after signing the ICF) will be captured.
The SAE report should provide a detailed description of the SAE and include a concise summary 
of hospital records and other relevant documents .  If a subject died and an autopsy has been 
performed, copies of the autopsy report and d eath certificate are to be sent to Celgene Drug 
Safety as soon as these become available.  Any follow-up data should be detailed in a subsequent 
SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form, and sent to Celgene Drug Safety.  
Where required by local legislation, the Investigator is responsible for informing the Institutional 
Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) of the SAE and providing them with all relevant 
initial and follow-up information about the event. The Investigator must keep copies of all SAE 
information on file including correspondence with Celgene and the IRB/EC.
10.6.1. Safety Queries
Queries pertaining to SAEs will be communicated from Celgene Drug Safety to the site via 
facsimile or electronic mail.  The response time is expected to be no more than five (5) business 
days.  Urgent queries (eg, missing causality assessment) may be handled by phone.

Confidential and Propri etary 91 ACE-536-MDS-001 Amendment 2.0 Final: 09 May 201710.7. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events
For the purpose of regulatory reporting, Celgene Drug Safety will determine the expectedness of 
events suspected of being related to luspatercept based on the Investigator Brochure.
In the United States, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be 
reported in an expedited manner in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32.
For countries within the European Economic Area (EEA), Celgene or its authorized 
representative will report in an expedited manner to Regulatory Authorities and Ethics 
Committees concerned, suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC and the Detailed Guidance on collection, verification and 
presentation of adverse reaction reports arising from clinical trials on investigational products for 
human use (ENTR/CT3) and also in accordance with country-specific requirements.
In addition, any report of progression to high risk MDS or AML if the case is in the luspatercept 
arm, upon unblinding regardless of causality, will be re ported as an expedited safety report to the 
regulatory authorities, as requested.
Celgene or its authorized representative sh all notify the Investigator of the following 
information:
!Any AE suspected of being related to the use of IP in this study or in other studies 
that is both serious and unexpected (ie, SUSAR);
!Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for 
human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.
Where required by local legislation, the Investigator shall notify his/her IRB/EC promptly of 
these new serious and unexpected AE(s) or significant risks to subjects.
The Investigator must keep copies of all pe rtinent safety information on file including 
correspondence with Celgene and the IRB/EC.  (See Section 14.3 for record retention 
information).
Celgene Drug Safety Contact Information:
For Celgene Drug Safety  contact information, pleas e refer to the Serious Adverse Event Report

11.1. Treatment Discontinuation
Subjects will have an End of Treatment (EOT) vi sit at the time of IP discontinuation.  All 
subjects who received at least one dose of IP will be followed for at least 3 years post last dose of 
IP. 
The following events are considered sufficient reasons for discontinuing a subject from the 
investigational products:
!Lack of Efficacy 
!Adverse Event
!Withdrawal by subject
!Death
!Lost to follow-up
!Pregnancy
!Protocol violation
!Study terminated by Sponsor
!Disease Progression as per IWG criteria for altering natural history of MDS ( Cheson, 
2006 ;Appendix E )
∀For subjects with 5-10% blasts, a 2ndbone marrow sample should be collected 
within 4 weeks for clinical assessment (e g, cytom orphology, cytogenetics) to 
confirm progression before disc ontinuing subjects from treatment. 
!Other (to be specified on the eCRF)
∀Including treatment discontinuation guida nce related to dose modification 
Table 6 .
The reason for discontinuation of tr eatment should be rec orded in the eCRF and in the source 
documents.
The decision to discontinue a subject from treatment remains the responsibility of the treating 
physician, which will not be delayed or refused by the Sponsor.  However, prior to discontinuing a subject, the Investigator may contact the Medical Monitor and forward appropriate supporting 
documents for review and discussion.
11.2. Study Discontinuation
Subjects who discontinue from treatment for any reason will be followed via telephone contact by the site or subject site visit for collection of data on survival, cause(s) of death, progression to 
AML, other malignancies/pre-malignancies, post-treatment therapy(ies) for MDS at the 42-Day and 12-Week Follow-up assessments and then every 3 months after the 12-Week Follow-up 
assessment for at least 3 years after last dose of IP or until death, lost to follow-up or withdrawal 
of consent from the study.

Confidential and Propri etary 94 ACE-536-MDS-001 Amendment 2.0 Final: 09 May 201712. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
12.1. Emergency Contact
In emergency situations, the Investigator should contact the responsible Clinical Research 
Physician/Medical Monitor or designee by telephone at the number(s) listed on the Emergency 
Contact Information page of the prot ocol (after title page).
In the unlikely event that the Clinical Research Physician/Medical Monitor or designee cannot be 
reached, please contact the global Emergency Call Center by telephone at the number listed on 
the Emergency Contact Information page of the protocol (after title page). This global 
Emergency Call Center is available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. The representatives are 
responsible for obtaining your call-back information and contacting the on-call Celgene/contract 
research organization Medical Monitor, who will then contact you promptly.
Note: The back-up 24-hour global emergency contact call center should only be used if you are 
not able to reach the Clinical Research Physician(s) or Medical Monitor or designee for 
emergency calls. 
12.2. Emergency Identification of Investigational Products
The blind must not be broken during the course of the study unless in the opinion of the Investigator, it is absolutely necessary to safely treat the subject.  If it is medically imperative to 
know what IP the subject is receiving, IP should be temporarily discontinued if, in the opinion of the Investigator, continuing IP can negatively affect the outcome of the subject’s treatment.
The decision to break the blind in emergency situations remains the responsibility of the treating 
physician, which will not be delayed or refused by the Sponsor.  However, the Investigator may contact the Medical Monitor prior to breaking the blind to discuss unblinding, mainly in the 
interest of the subject. 
The Investigator should ensure that the code is broken only in accordance with the protocol. The 
Investigator should promptly notify the Medical Monitor of the emergency unblinding and the 
reason for breaking the blind, which should be clearly documented by the Investigator in the 
subject’s source documentation.
Emergency unblinding should only be performed by  the Investigator through the IRT by using an 
emergency unblinding personal identification number (PIN), and the Investigator should call IRT
for unblinded dose information.

13.1. Good Clinical Practice
The procedures set out in this study protocol pertaining to the conduct, evaluation, and 
documentation of this study are designed to ens ure that Celgene, its authorized representative, 
and Investigator abide by Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as described in International Council for
Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline E6 and in accordance with the general ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study w ill receive approval from an IRB/EC prior to 
commencement. The Investigator will conduct all aspects of this study in accordance with 
applicable national, state, and local laws of the pertinent regulatory authorities.
13.2. Investigator Responsibilities
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and in the local regulations.  Celgene staff or an authorized representative will evaluate and approve all Investigators who in turn will select their staff.
The Investigator should ensure that all persons a ssisting with the study are adequately informed 
about the protocol, amendments, study treatments, as well as study-related duties and functions, including obligations of confidentiality of Celgene information. The Investigator should maintain 
a list of Sub-investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom he or she has 
delegated significant study-related duties.
The Investigator is responsible for keeping a record of all subjects who sign an informed consent 
form (ICF) and are screened for entry into the st udy.  Subjects who fail screening must have the 
reason(s) recorded in the subject’s source documents.
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to subject records (eg, 
medical records, office charts, hospital charts, and study-related charts) for source data verification.  The Investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of eCRFs and queries.
The information contained in the protocol and amendments (with the exception of the 
information provided by Celgene on public registry websites) is considered Celgene confidential 
information.  Only information that is previously disclosed by Celgene on a public registry 
website may be freely disclosed by the Investigator or its institution, or as outlined in the Clinical 
Trial Agreement.  Celgene protocol, amendment and IB information is not to be made publicly 
available (for example on the Investigator’s or their institution’s website) without express written 
approval from Celgene.  Information proposed  for posting on the Investigator’s or their 
institution’s website must be submitted to Celgene for review and approval, providing at least 5 business days for review.
At the time results of this study are made available to the public, Celgene will provide 
Investigators with a summary of the results that is written for the lay pe rson. The Investigator is 
responsible for sharing these results with the subject and/or their caregiver as agreed by the 
subject.

The Investigator must obtain informed consent of a subject and/or a subject’s legal representative 
prior to any study related procedures.
Documentation that informed cons ent occurred prior to the study subject’s entry into the study 
and of the informed consent process should be recorded in the study subject’s source documents including the date.  The original ICF signed and dated by the study subject and by the person 
consenting the study subject prior to the study subject’s entry into the study, must be maintained 
in the Investigator’s study files and a copy given to  the study subject.  In addition, if a protocol is 
amended and it impacts on the content of the infor med consent, the ICF must be revised.  Study 
subjects participating in the study when the amended protocol is implemented must be re-
consented with the revised version of the ICF.  The revised ICF signed and dated by the study subject and by the person consenting the study s ubject must be maintained in the Investigator’s 
study files and a copy given to the study subject.
13.4. Confidentiality
Celgene affirms the subject's right to protection against invasion of privacy and to be in 
compliance with ICH and other local regulations (w hichever is most stringent). Celgene requires 
the Investigator to permit Celgene's representatives and, when necessary, representatives from 
regulatory authorities, to review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in 
accordance with local laws.
Should direct access to medical records require  a waiver or authorization separate from the 
subject’s signed ICF, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain such permission in writing from the appropriate i ndividual.
13.5. Protocol Amendments
Any amendment to this protocol must be approved by the Celgene Clinical Research 
Physician/Medical Monitor.  Amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC for written approval.  
Written approval must be obtained before implementation of the amended version occurs.  The 
written signed approval from the IRB/EC should specifically reference the Investigator name, protocol number, study title and amendment number(s) that is applicable. Amendments that are 
administrative in nature do not require IRB/IEC approval but will be submitted to the IRB/IEC 
for information purposes.
13.6. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Review 
and Approval
Before the start of the study, the study protocol , ICF, and any other appropriate documents will 
be submitted to the IRB/EC with a cover letter or a form listing the documents submitted, their 
dates of issue, and the site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable) for which approval is sought. If applicable, the documents will also be submitted to the authorities in accordance with 
local legal requirements.
Investigational product (IP) product can only be supplied to an Investigator by Celgene or its 
authorized representative after documentation on all ethical and legal requirements for starting

must also include a list of the members of the IRB/EC and their occupation and qualifications. If 
the IRB/EC will not disclose the names, occupations and qualifications of the committee 
members, it should be asked to issue a statement confirming that the composition of the committee is in accordance with GCP. For example, the IRB General Assurance Number may be 
accepted as a substitute for this list. Formal appro val by the IRB/EC should mention the protocol 
title, number, amendment number (if applicable), study site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as 
applicable), and any other documents reviewed. It must mention the date on which the decision 
was made and must be officially signed by a committee member. Before the first subject is 
enrolled in the study, all ethical and legal requirements must be met.
The IRB/EC and, if applicable, the authorities, must be informed of all subsequent protocol 
amendments in accordance with local legal requirements. Amendments must be evaluated to 
determine whether formal approval must be sought and whether the ICF should also be revised.
The Investigator must keep a record of all co mmunication with the IRB /EC and, if applicable, 
between a Coordinating Investigator and the IRB /EC. This statement also applies to any 
communication between the Investigator (or Coordinating Investigator, if applicable) and regulatory authorities.
Any advertisements used to recruit subjects for the study must be reviewed by Celgene and the 
IRB/EC prior to use.  
13.7. Ongoing Information for Institutional Review Board/ Ethics 
Committee
If required by legislation or the IRB/EC, the Investigator must submit to the IRB/EC:
!Information on serious or unexpected adverse events as soon as possible; 
!Periodic reports on the progress of the study;
!Deviations from the protocol or anything th at may involve added risk to subjects.
13.8. Termination of the Study
Celgene reserves the right to terminate this st udy prematurely at any time for reasonable medical 
or administrative reasons. Any premature discontinuation will be appropriately documented 
according to local requirements (eg, IRB/EC, regulatory authorities, etc).
The Sponsor may consider closing this trial when data supporting key endpoints and objectives 
of the study have been analyzed.  In the case where there are subjects still being administered the 
investigational product, and it is the opinion of the Investigator(s) that these subjects continue to 
receive benefit from treatment, the Sponsor may c hoose to initiate an open-label, roll-over or 
extension study under a separate protocol to allow these subjects continued access to luspatercept 
following their participation in this study ACE-536-MDS-001.

All aspects of the study will be carefully moni tored by Celgene or its authorized representative 
for compliance with applicable government regula tions with respect to current GCP and SOPs.
15.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification
Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after 
the study.  All aspects of the study are reviewed  with the Investigator and the staff at a study 
initiation visit and/or at an Investigators’ Meeting.  Prior to enrolling subjects into the study, a 
Celgene representative will review the protocol , eCRFs, procedures for obtaining informed 
consent, record keeping, and reporting of AEs/SAEs with the Investigator.  Monitoring will include on-site visits with the Investigat or and his/her staff as  well as any appropriate 
communications by mail, email, fax, or telephone.  During monitoring visits, the facilities, 
investigational product storage area, eCRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study documentation will be inspected/reviewed by the Ce lgene representative in  accordance with the 
Study Monitoring Plan.
Accuracy will be checked by performing source data verification that is a direct comparison of 
the entries made onto the eCRFs against the appropriate source documentation.  Any resulting 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the Investigator and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary 
corrections will be made directly to the eCR Fs or via queries by the Investigator and/or his/her 
staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed consents, adherence to inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and documentation of SAEs and their proper recording be verified.  Additional 
monitoring activities may be outlined in a study-specific monitoring plan.
15.2. Audits and Inspections
In addition to the routine monitoring procedure s, a Good Clinical Practice Quality Assurance 
unit exists within Celgene.  Representatives of this unit will conduct audits of clinical research 
activities in accordance with Celgene SOPs to evaluate compliance with Good Clinical Pract ice 
guidelines and regulations.
The Investigator is required to permit direct access to the facilities where the study took place, 
source documents, eCRFs and applicable supporting records of study subject participation for 
audits and inspections by IRB/ECs, regulatory  authorities (eg, Food and Drug Administration 
[FDA], European Medicines Agency [EMA ], Health Canada) and company authorized 
representatives.  The Investigator should make ever y effort to be available for the audits and/or 
inspections.  If the Investigator is contacted by any regulatory authority regarding an inspection, 
he/she should contact Celgene immediately.

As ring sideroblast positive disease is a key attribute of the study’s patient population additional 
language was added to the protocol taking into consideration the recent update to the WHO
classification criteria (Arber, 2016), which further expanded the definition of ring sideroblast positive disease to also include patients with ≥ 5% ring sideroblasts and confirmation of SF3B1 
mutation along with patients who sol ely meet the previously established ≥ 15% threshold.  In 
addition, the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) agreed to this modification and also 
recommended use of the French-American-British (FAB) classification system in addition to the 
WHO classification system to determine eligibility related to baseline MDS diagnosis.

!Included upper pre-transfusion Hgb threshold of 10 g/dL to protocol eligibility 
criterion related to requirement of transfusions
With the older demographic in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), patients often develop 
overlapping comorbidities.  When erythrocyte production is affected in MDS, patients frequently 
present with signs and symptoms of anemia including pallor, tachycardia, hypotension, fatigue, 
headache and exercise intolerance, or with signs and symptoms of worsening of an underlying condition such as angina pectoris, heart failure, or a pulmonary disorder. Patients with such co-
morbidities may have more symptoms at a hi gher baseline Hgb level than patient who do not 
have such co-morbidities. Due to this fact, some practitioners choose to transfuse their older MDS patients with multiple co-morbidities at a higher Hgb level of 10 g/dL than they would 
younger and/or more fit patients.  This was disc ussed and agreed to with the Scientific Steering 
Committee (SSC).  
It is important to note that subjects may still receive transfusions at a lower Hgb threshold during 
the Treatment Period if clinically indicated at the inve stigators discretion as outlined in Protocol 
Section 8.1.2.  Additional language has been added to Section 8.1.2 as per SSC recommendation to provide further clarification on ensuring consisten cy in transfusion practices in regard to pre-
transfusion Hgb threshold after study entry.
Revised sections:  Section 4.2, Inclusion Criter ion 6; Section 6.1, Screening Period; Section 
8.1.2, RBC Transfusions
!Added language to allow for the participation of patients with > 2.0 upper limit of 
normal (ULN) serum bilirubin if in the presence of diagnosed or known Gilbert syndrome.
Gilbert syndrome, also known as Gilbert-Meulengracht syndrome, is a benign hereditary
condition characterized by intermittent unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the absence ofhepatocellular disease or hemolysis (Fretzay az, 2012). Patients with Gilbert syndrome are
asymptomatic and typically have otherwise normal liver serum chemistries (VanWagner, 2015). 
This is a benign condition that does not othe rwise affect normal liver function and should not 
exclude patients from the trial.
Revised section: Section 4.3, Exclusion Criterion 14
!Revised eligibility criteria to exclude patients with significant cardiac dysfunction 
based on known local ECHO/MUGA results
To further ensure patients with significant cardiac dysfunction are not enrolled into study, the 
Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) recommended that patients with known ejection fraction < 
35% be excluded (based upon local ECHO or MUGA performed within 6 months of randomization d ate).

Confidential and Propri etary 6 ACE-536-MDS-001 Amendment 1.0 Final: 21 Sep 2016!Revised eligibility criteria to allow use of experimental agents prior to 
randomization
As the MDS population is an older demographic, ma ny patients have overlapping comorbidities 
that may require treatment, which may include i nvestigational agents.  Contingent that the last 
dose of the investigational agent is at least 5 weeks from date of rando mization (or 5 times the 
half-life, if half-life is known), these patients should not be excluded.
Revised sections : Section 4.3, Excl usion Criteria 1 and 8
!Revised eligibility criteria to allow enrollm ent of patients who received a prior sub-
therapeutic course of hypomethylating agent or lenalidomide 
As the investigational use of active therapy (eg, hypomethylating agents, lenalidomide) is 
common in the clinical setting in certain countries (eg, US) for lower risk, non del5q, MDS patients who are erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) refractory; patients who may have 
received sub-therapeutic courses of these agents  and discontinued due to intolerance should not 
be excluded from the protocol.  The Scientif ic Steering Committee recommended the following 
maximum durations of prior treatment with these agents to ensure only patients receiving sub-
therapeutic courses are enrolled.  
Lenalidomide = no more than 1 calendar week of treatmentHypomethylating agents = no more than 2 doses 
Revised section: Section 4.3, Exclusion Criterion 1 
!Decreased the ESA/G-CSF/GM-CSF washout window to 4 weeks from date of 
randomization
In order to ensure that the required ESA/growth factor washout period can be completed within 
protocol 5-week screening window, the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) recommended 
decreasing the washout period to 4 weeks to avoid unnecessary screen failures.
Revised section: Section 4.2, Inclusion Criterion 5
!Updated applicable protocol sections to a lign with Investigator’s Brochure (IB) 
Edition 8 (IB update occurring in parallel)
Revised sections: Section 1.2, Compound Bac kground; Section 1.2.1.1, Toxicology Studies; 
1.2.2.1, Potential Risks of Human Use; Section 1.3.1, Study Rationale and Purpose
!Added information related to benefit/risk and added section titled Overall Benefit 
Risk Assessment to the protocol
 information 
related to benefit/risk and an overall benefit risk assessment has been included in the protocol to allow the investigator to review the information a nd form his/her opinion of the benefit/risks to 
the patient in the current clinical trial.

STUDY PROTOCOL  
This study was  a crossover trial  of healthy participants .  After providing written informed consent, 
participants were screened for eligibility criteria.  Eligible participants then underwent three inter ventions 
across three separate sessions.  First, participants completed a  cold water immersion task that included 
immersion of the dominant hand in a bath of water for 1 minut e, 4 times .  Second, participants completed 
a pain inducing stretching in which  they underwent stretching of the upper trapezius for a moderate 
intensity for 1 minute, 4  times.  Third, participants underwent a pain free stretch in which  they underwent 
stretching of the upper trapezius for a low intensity  for 1 minute, 4 times.   Between each minute, pressure 
pain threshold was assessed at the non -dominant webspace of the foot.  
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
To examine the immediate changes in PPT by condition, a repeated measures  ANOVA was conducted .  
Simple effects decomposition with Bonferroni correction were  completed.  Our a priori alpha level is 
<0.05.

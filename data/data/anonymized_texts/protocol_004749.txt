Safety and Monitoring :  
Monitoring and Management of Potential  AEs and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
Potential AEs:  
Based on findings in nonclinical models, potential AEs include reversible hypoglycemia and metabolic 
acidosis.  Potential cases of reversible hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis will be identified by 
routine safety monitoring of AEs and clinical safety laboratories.  
Musculoskeletal Safety:  
Patients with CK abnormalities will also be reviewed for any other lab changes, such as creatinine, and 
any reported AEs or SAEs.  Musculoskeletal events will be identified and evaluated by routine safety monitoring of PE findings and AEs.  
Diabetes and Hyperglycemia:  
Cases of new onset of diabetes will be recorded as AEs.  Clinical laboratories, including HbA 1C and 
fasting glucose, will also be evaluated across treatment groups during this study and all ongoing 
studies to  identify potential cases of new onset of diabetes.  
Neurocognitive Events: 
Neurocognitive events will be identified and evaluated by routine safety monitoring of PE findings and AEs.  
Clinical Endpoints:  
Clinical endpoints will be monitored and adjudicated by an independent expert CEC for this study and 
other ongoing studies in the bempedoic acid program.  
Routine cardiovascular monitoring will include review of MACE and non- MACE cardiovascular AEs, 
SAEs, standard vital signs, and ECGs. 
Further details on occurrence and monitoring of AESI are available in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
Statistical Methods:  
Sample Size  
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is the percent change from baseline to Week  12 in LDL-C.   
The sample size of 150 randomized patients in the bempedoic acid 180 mg group and 75 randomized 
patients in the placebo group is expected to provide more than 95% power to detect a difference of 15% in 
the percent change from baseline to Week  12 in calculated LDL -C between the bempedoic acid treatment 
group and the placebo group.  This calculation is based on a 2- sided t -test at the 5% level of significance  
and a common standard deviation of 15%.  The sample size of 150 randomized patients in the bempedoic 
acid 180 mg group and 75 randomized patients in the placebo group gives a total study sample size 
of 225.  
Analysis Populations 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS), used for all of the efficacy analyses, is defined as all randomized patients.  
The FAS is also known as the intention -to-treat (ITT) set of patients.   Patients in the FAS will be included

Confidential Page 10 of 144 in their randomized treatment group, regardless of their actual treatment.  
The Safety Population (SP), used for all of the safety summaries, is de fined as all randomized patients 
who received at least 1  dose of study medication.  Patients in the SP will be included in the treatment 
group that they actually received, regardless of their randomized treatment.  
Disposition and Baseline Characteristics  
Disposition, including reason for withdrawal from the study, will be summarized by treatment group.  
Demographic information and patient characteristics including, but not limited to, gender, race, age, and 
baseline vital signs will also be summarized by treatment group. 
Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change from baseline to Week  12 in LDL -C.  Baseline is 
defined as the mean of the values from Week  -1 (Visit S3 ) and predose Day  1/Week  0 (Visit  T1).  The 
primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with treatment group as a factor and baseline LDL -C as a covariate.   The ANCOVA will be performed using the FAS, 
with patients included in their randomized treatment group regardless of th e treatment they actually 
received.   Missing data will be imputed using multiple imputation method that accounts for treatment 
adherence via a pattern mixture model (PMM).  Imputed datasets will be analyzed using ANCOVA with 
treatment as a factor  and basel ine LDL -C as a covariate.  Approximately 200 imputed datasets will be 
created, with results from the analysis of each imputed dataset combined using Rubin’s method.  For final 
results,  the least squares mean (LSM) and standard error (SE) will be provided for both treatment groups, 
along with the placebo -corrected LSM, its 95% confidence interval (CI) , and associated p -value.  
Secondary and Tertiary Efficacy Analysis  
Absolute and percent change from baseline to specific time points for lipid parameters and hs- CRP  will 
each be analyzed similarly using ANCOVA with treatment group as a factor and the relevant baseline as 
the covariate.   Baseline for non -HDL -C, HDL -C, TC, and TG are defined as the mean of the values f rom 
Week  -1 (Visit S3 ) and predose Day  1/Week  0 (Visit  T1), while baseline for apoB and hs- CRP  is defined 
as the predose Day 1/Week  0 (Visit  T1) value.   Each ANCOVA will be performed using the FAS , with 
patients included in their randomized treatment group regardless of the treatment they actually received .  
For each lipid parameter at each time point, the LSM and SE will be provided for both treatment groups, 
along with the placebo -corrected LSM, its 95% CI and associated p -value .  
For all continuous efficacy endpoints (percent change from baseline and absolute change from baseline in LDL -C, HDL -C, non- HDL -C, TC, TG, apoB, and hs- CRP ; to Week s 4, 8, and 12, as appropriate ), the 
ANCOVA assumption of normality will be assessed.   If non-normality of the data is found at any time 
point for any parameter, either the data will be transformed so that it is normally distributed or a 
nonparametric test will be used instead of the planned ANCOVA.  
Safety Analyses  
The summarization of AEs will include only TEAEs.  TEAEs  and SAEs will be summarized by system 
organ class (SOC), severity, and relationship to study drug for each treatment group.  These AE 
summaries will include cumulative incidence (percent of patients experiencing the AE) and patient -year 
adjusted incidence rates.   If appropriate, absolute and relative risk differences will be calculated using 
both cumulative incidence and incidence rates.  Deaths, withdrawal from study treatment due to AEs, and withdrawal from the study due to AEs will each be summarized by treatment group. 
Clinical safety laboratories, including hematology, blood chemistry, HbA
1C, fasting glucose, and 
urinalysis; PE findings; vital signs; ECG readings; and weight will be summarized by the value and by 
change from baseline in the value (where appropriate) at each postbaseline time point.  
Hepatic Safety  
For liver -associated enzymes and TB , the number and percent of patients with abnormal values for ALT, 
AST, and TB will be summarized.  Hy’s criteria (≥3  × ULN for either ALT or AST, with accomp anying 
TB >2  × ULN in the absence of other known causes  (≥2 × ULN conjugated [direct ] bilirubin will be used 
Bempedoic acid   Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol 1002-048  Amendment 2, 10 February 2017  
Confidential Page 11 of 144 in patients with Gilbert’s Disease ), will also be applied to the data; any potential Hy’s law cases will be 
listed separately.  
Musculoskeletal Safety 
AEs of muscle related symptoms will be summarized by treatment group.   In addition, the number and 
percent of patients with abnormal CK values will be summarized.  
Diabetes and Hyperglycemia 
Cases of worsening and new onset of diabetes will be recor ded as AEs and will be summarized using the 
appropriate SOC.  These events will be summarized by severity and relationship to study drug for each 
treatment group. 
Renal Safety  
Baseline eGFR and values of CK will be summarized by treatment group and by baseline eGFR 
categories.   Shift tables of eGFR category from baseline over the study, will be provided by treatment 
group.  Finally, muscle -related AEs will be summarized by treatment group and by baseline eGFR 
category.  
Neurocognitive Events 
Neurocognitive events will be identified and evaluated by routine safety monitoring of PE findings and AEs.   Summarization of neurocognitive events will occur using prespecified Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms and will be performed by treatment group.  
Clinical endpoints  
Clinical endpoints using standardized definitions will be adjudicated by an independent blinded expert 
CEC for all ongoing Phase 3 studies in the bempedoic acid program.  Investigator -reported clinical 
endpoints and adjudicated clinical endpoints will be summarized by e vent type and treatment group.  
Additional details regarding the clinical endpoints and their definitions will be included in CEC Charter.  
PK and Other biomarkers  
PK plasma concentrations for ETC -1002 and its metabolite ESP15228 will be summarized at  Week  4 
(Visit T2), Week  8 (Visit  T3), and Week 12 (Visit T4).

4.1. Lipid -Regulating Drugs and Cardiovascular Disease  
Bempedoic acid (ETC -1002) is an inhibitor of adenosine triphosphate- citrate lyase (ACL) 
(adenosine triphosphate [ATP] citrate lyase), an enzyme upstream of 3 -hydroxy-3- methylglutaryl 
coenzyme A (HMG -CoA) reductase in the ch olesterol biosynthesis pathway .  It is an oral , first -
in-class small molecule designed to lower low -density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL- C) levels in 
patients with high cardiovascular (CV) risk unable to meet their treatment goals with currently 
available lipid-lowering therapies.  
The target population for this study includes patients with elevated LDL -C who are only able to 
tolerate low dose or less than low dose of statins (including those not taking a statin due to  
inability to tolerate a statin) or in c ombination with other lipid -modifying therapies (in some 
cases also includes ezetimibe) and who require additional LDL-C lowering. 
Elevated  LDL-C is a major modifiable risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis and 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases  (ASCVD) [1].  Despite aggressive interventional and 
pharmacologic therapies, CV disease is the number 1 cause of death globally [ 2].  An estimated 
17.5 million people died from CV  diseases in 2012, representing 31% of all deaths worldwide.  
Of these deaths, an estimated 7.4 million were due to coronary heart disease (CHD) and 
6.7 million were due to stroke [ 2].  Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death 
among Americans, Europeans , and around the world.  The Global Burden of Disease study 
estimated that 29.6% of all deaths ( approximately 15.6 million deaths) were caused by CV disease 
in 2010, more than all communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders combined, 
and double the number of deaths caused by cancers [ 3].  In the United States  (US), based on 
2011 death rate data, more than 2150 Americans die from CV diseases daily, an average of 
1 death every 40 se conds.  Approximately 155,000 Americans dying from CV disease are less 
than 65 years of age .  In 2011, 34% of deaths due to CV  disease occurred prior to the age of 
75 years, less than the current 78.7- year average life expectancy  [4].  
LDL-C is largely  accepted as a valid surrogate endpoint of CV  events by clinicians and 
regulatory authorities [5].  Long -term elevations in LDL -C lead to progressive accumulation of 
atherosclerotic lesions in the walls of arteries that require long- term management.  While 
lifestyle changes  are the primary intervention, these measures rarely decrease plasma LDL- C by 
>15%.  Evidence supporting LDL-C as a therapeutic target and surrogate for CV outcomes 
comes from interventional studies with LDL -C-lowering therapies, epidemiological studies, 
genetic variants (both gain  of function and loss of function).  Large randomized clinical studies 
aimed at lowering LDL-C show a consistent log-linear relationship between LDL -C reduction 
and CV  risk reduction, independent of the way LDL-C lowering was achieved based on 
mechanism of action [ 6,7,8,9].  A published patient -level meta -analysis including 26 trials and 
more than 160,000 participants, showed a consistent relationship between LDL-C reduction and 
CV outcomes [ 7].  This analysis showed that a 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL -C was associated 
with a 22% reduction in the 5- year incidence of major coronary events, revascularizations, and 
ischemic strokes.  Intensive statin therapy relative to low/moderate intensity statin treatment produces greater benefit in patients at high CV risk [10].

Confidential Page 24 of 144 Unfortunately, some patients with elevated LDL -C are unable to take high intensity statins due to 
dosing limits bas ed on comorbidities, contraindications, and/or tolerance [ 11].  Nonstatin 
therapies may provide additional lowering of CV risk as demonstrated in the IMPROVE -IT trial 
which added  ezetimibe to statin therapy [12].  The addition of bempedoic acid to ezetimibe and 
low intensity statin therapy may offer additional lowering of LDL- C with associated lowering of 
CV risk .  Bempedoic acid  has been well tolerated to date and Phase 2 data demonstrate 
significant LDL-C lowering, prompting further evaluation in Phase 3 clinical studies .  
4.2. Background on Be mpedoic Acid  
4.2.1. Mechanism of Action  
Bempedoic acid is a first -in-class small molecule inhibitor of ACL, an enzyme upstream of 
HMG-CoA in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.  Bempedoic acid is a prodrug that requires 
activation in liver to ETC -1002- coenzyme A (ETC -1002-CoA), which mediates competitive 
inhibition of ACL.  Inhibition of ACL by ETC-1002- CoA decreases cholesterol synthesis in the 
liver leading to increased low-density lipoprotein receptor ( LDLR ) expression and LDL particle 
clearance from  the blood.  Therefore, inhibition of ACL by ETC-1002- CoA decreases  LDL- C 
via the same pathway as HMG -CoA reductase inhibition by statins.  
An important differentiating feature of bempedoic acid is that, unlike statins, it does not inhibit cholesterol synthesis in skeletal muscle.  The enzyme required to convert bempedoic acid  to 
ETC -1002-CoA is not present in skeletal muscle.   Therefore, bempedoic acid is not anticipated 
to mediate the adverse effects associated with inhibition of biological intermediates within the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in skeletal muscle ; however, the safety of bempedoic acid and 
its metabolites regarding human skeletal muscle is not yet established .

4.2.5. Background Therapy  
In this study, bempedoic acid is being evaluated as an add- on therapy to ezetimibe for decreasing 
LDL-C in addition to background low dose or less than low dose statin therapy in patients with 
elevated LDL -C who require additional LDL- C lowering.

To date, the nonclinical and clinical data indicate that bempedoic acid  has a favorable risk -
benefit profile.  The ability of bempedoic acid  to achieve clinically meaningful LDL-C-lowering 
responses while demonstrating a favorable tolerability profile in a variety of patient populations 
supports continued development of bempedoic acid , an oral ACL inhibitor, in the Phase 3 
program.

6.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase  3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study evaluating 
the efficacy  and safety  of bempedoic acid  as an add -on therapy to ezetimibe in patients with 
elevated LDL -C.  
Screening Week  -5 (Visit S1) will begin  approximately 5  weeks prior to randomization, but can 
be extended for an additional 4 weeks , if needed , to adjust background medical therapy or for 
other reasons as specified in the protocol.  Eli gible patients will return to the clinical site at 
Week  -4 (Visit S2) to  begin treatment with study supplied ezetimibe 10  mg and single -blind 
placebo .  Patients having their own supply of ezetimibe will switch to study -supplied ezetimibe  
at this visit.  
6.2. Study Hypothesis  
The study will assess the 12 -week efficacy of bempedoic acid as an add -on therapy to ezetimibe 
in decreasing LDL -C versus placebo .  The treatment duration of 12 weeks and study population 
of 225 patients  will provide data on the lipid profile, safety, and tolerability of bempedoic acid in 
patients with elevated LDL -C who have a need for additional lipid- lowering therapy .  
6.3. Study Duration and Period  
The expected total duration of study participation for each randomized  patient is  approximately 
17 weeks .  The study will consist of an approximately 1- week screening  period, a 4- week 
placebo run-in period, and a 12-week of treatment period . 
6.4. End of Study  
The study will end when the last randomized patient completes  the Week  12 visit.  The estimated 
overall duration of the study (first patient first visit [FPFV] to last patient last visit [LPLV] ) is 
approximately 11 months. 
6.5. Number of Patients 
Approximately 225 eligible patients will be randomized 2:1 on Day  1 (Visit  T1) to receive either 
bempedoic acid  180 mg ( N = 150) or placebo (N = 75) for 12 weeks.  
6.6. Patient Identification Numbers 
A unique patient identification number will be assigned to identify each patient throughout the 
study and will be entered on all documentation.  If a patient i s not eligible to receive treatment, 
or if a patient discontinues from the study, their patient identification number cannot be assigned 
to another patient.  
Patient identification numbers will be  assigned sequentially by interactive web response system 
(IWRS) at the time of informed consent during the screening module transaction.

Confidential Page 31 of 144 6.6.1. Screening and Placebo Run- in Period  
Screening will occur approximately 5  weeks prior to Day 1 (Visit T1) when the patient’s 
eligibility will be evaluated.  Eligible patients who  are taking concomitant medications must be 
on stable regimens as defined in Section  7.1.  At the investigator’s discretion, screening may be 
extended for an additional 4 weeks , if needed , to adjust background medical therapy or for other 
reasons as specified in the protocol.  Eligible patients will return to the clinical site at Week  -4 
(Visit S2) to initiate administration of open label ezetimibe and single -blin d placebo.   Eligible 
patients will return at Week  -1 (Visit S3) for basic fasting lipids assessments and an assessment 
of tolerability and study drug adherence (see Section  7 for eligibility criteria) .  Patients who are 
deemed not eligible for randomization at any point during screening will be notified by clinical 
site personnel regarding their eligibility status and considered screen failures.  As necessary, for 
reasons of safety if a patient begins the run-in period but fails screen ing prior to randomization, 
the patient may be asked to return to the clinical site fo r further evaluation and follow-up of AEs. 
6.6.2. Randomization and Treatment Periods 
For patients who satisfy all entry criteria and complete the 1-week screening period and 4- week 
run-in period, randomization to a treatment group will occur via I WRS at Week  0 (Visit T1) .  
Approximately 225 patients will be randomized in a ratio of 2:1 to receive 1  of the 2 following 
treatments in a double-blind fashion: 
• Bempedoic acid 180- mg tablet  
• Matching placebo tablet

atorvastatin <10  mg, simvastatin <10  mg, lovastatin <20 mg, pravastatin <40 mg, fluvastatin 
<40 mg, or pitavastatin <2  mg.  Patients unable to take any dose of statins are also eligible 
provided that statin therapy has be en attempted  as described above.   
Patients should continue taking their LMT  throughout the study.   
PCSK9 inhibitors are not allowed during the study period.   
The ezetimib e and IMP will be study-supplied.  Patients on ezetimibe at Visit S1 will stop taking 
their supply of medication at Visit S2 and begin taking study- supplied ezetimibe.  
8.4.2. Prohibited Medications

Confidential Page 39 of 144 • Any experimental or investigational drugs within 30  days before screening (Week  -5, 
Visit S1).   Patients who have enrolled in a study of an experimental siRNA in hibitor 
of PCSK9 are excluded.  
8.4.3. Allowable Medications  
LMT not prohibited are allowed and should remain stable for at least 4 weeks prior to screening 
(Week -5, Visit S1); fibrates (with the exception of gemfibrozil which is exclusionary in patients 
taking a statin ) should remain stable for at least 6  weeks prior to screening (Week -5, Visit S1).  
Use of any of the following medications are allowed if started before the randomization visit 
(Day  1, Visit T1)  as defined below and are expected to remain stable through completion of the 
study:   
• Hormone replacement therapy  (≥6 weeks before Day  1, Visit T1)  
• Thyroid replacement therapy  (≥6 weeks before Day  1, Visit T1)  
• Diabetes medications  (≥4 weeks before Day  1, Visit T1)  
• Obesity medications  (≥4 weeks before Day  1, Visit T1)  
Other concomitant medications and doses must be stable for 2 weeks prior to screening and, if 
possible, not be adjusted during the study except for reasons of safety.   
8.5. Treatment Compliance  
8.5.1. Screening Compliance 
No study medication treatment will be given during the Screening period; therefore, compliance 
will not be assessed.  
8.5.2. Placebo Run- in and Treatment  Period Adherence 
At the Week  -1 (S3) visit in the placebo and ezetimibe  run-in period and at each of the 
subsequent patient visits, designated clinical site staff will assess patients for ezetimibe and IMP 
adherence by counting the number of tablets that are returned as unused and by query ing the 
patient with  regards to daily intake.  Prior to randomization, duri ng the ezetimibe and single -
blind run-in period, patients with ≤80% adherence to either ezetimibe or single-blind placebo 
and/or who experienced an AE judged at least possibly related to ezetimibe and/or single -blind 
placebo  will not go on to randomization. 
After randomization, if the patient has not taken all doses of study drug  as instructed, the patient 
will be queried for a reason, findings will be documented, and the patient will be counseled on the importance of carefully following all dosing instructions.  Factors contributing to poor 
adherence will be determined and, if possible, remedied.  Following randomization, patients 
demonstrating poor adherence will continue to be counseled on the importance of carefully 
following all dosing instructions, but will not be removed from the study. 
8.6. Blinding  
Patients who satisfy all entry criteria during the screening , complete treatment with ezetimibe 
10 mg and the single -blind placebo during the run-in period, and meet the lipid, safety,

Confidential Page 40 of 144 tolerability, and drug adherence measures will be randomized to receive either bempedoic acid or 
placebo at Week  0 (Visit T1).  The investigator or designee will contact IWRS at this visit to 
randomize the patient into the study.   
After patients have been randomized, study drug, as assigned by the IWRS, will be administered 
in a double-blind fashion.  The Sponsor, all clinical site personnel (investigator , pharmacist, etc), 
and other vendor personnel will be blinded to the treatment group for each patient .  Patients will 
also be b linded to the treatment they receive.  Unblinded user(s) will be designated for each 
clinical site and at the Sponsor (or designee) as needed.  Unblinded individuals will be provided 
IWRS access allowing them the ability to perform emergency unblinding of treatment for an 
individual patient.  An affirmative entry of the user’s login details will be required before the 
treatment group is displayed.  Unblinding at the clinical site for any other reason will be 
considered a protocol deviation.  Unblinded treat ments for patients will NOT automatically 
discontinue the patient from the study.  To discontinue the patient from the study, the appropriate 
clinical site personnel will need to register the ‘discontinuation’ visit separately.  
Blinding of treatment must be maintained for all patients unless, in the opinion of the 
investigator , the safety of the patient may be at risk.  Only under the rarest of circumstances 
should the investigator  consider breaking the blind and only when medical/supportive care 
cannot be provided without determining if the patient is receiving active drug treatment.  In the event that the blind needs to be broken prior to completion of the study, the investigator  should 
contact the appropriate Medical Monitor by telephone.  If the blind must be broken prior to 
consultation with the Medical Monitor, contact must be made within 24 hours of breaking the 
blind.  At the initiation of the study, the clinical site will be instructed on procedures for breaking the blind via the IWRS.  In all cases of breaking the blind, the investigator  must document in the 
patient’s medical record the date, time, and reason for breaking the blind, and the names of personnel involved.  
Limited vendors (ie, the bioanalytical laboratory and other vendor personnel, if any, that are 
responsible for PK analysis) will have access to the randomization codes to facilitate  PK 
analytical work, and will be instructed to not communicate in any manner information associated 
with treatment assignment to any personnel at the clinical site, the Sponsor, or contract research 
organization ( CRO ).  
Post-randomization values for individual laboratory measures for LDL-C, TG, TC, HDL-C, 
non-HDL, apoB, and hs- CRP that may inadvertently suggest treatment assignment will not be 
available to personnel from the clinical site, the patient, the Sponsor, or CRO.  
A blinded independent expert Clinical Events Committee (CEC) will adjudicate designated clinical endpoints, including all major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and non- MACE 
endpoints defined as:  CV death (MACE), non-CV death (non- MACE), nonfatal myocardial 
infarction [MI] (MACE), nonfatal stroke (MACE), hospitalization for unstable angina (MACE), coronary revascularization (MACE), non- coronary arterial revascularization (non -MACE), and 
hospitalization for heart failure (non-MACE) using standardized definitions. Any clinical endpoints that meet SAE criteria will be reported as SAEs . 
An independent expert Data Moni toring Committee  (DMC) will formally review accumulating 
unblinded safety data from this and other ongoing studies of bempedoic acid.

Confidential Page 41 of 144 8.7. Overdose  
There is no specific antidote for an overdose of bempedoic acid.  Management of an overdose 
should be focused on the treatment of symptoms.   These symptoms should be managed 
according to current standards of care with appropriate supportive measures.  Also 
discontinuation of study drug should be considered, as per medical judgement. 
In clinical studies, administration of ezetimibe, 50 mg/day to 15 healthy subjects for up to 
14 days, 40 mg/day to 18 patients with primary hyperlipidemia for up to 56  days, and 40 mg/day 
to 27 patients with homozygous sitosterolemia for 26  weeks was generally well tolerated.  One 
female patient with homozygous sitosterolemia took an accidental overdose of ezetimibe 120 mg/day for 28  days with no reported clinical or laboratory adverse events.  In the event of an 
overdose, symptomatic and supportive measures should be employed [ 14].

9.1. Investigational Medicinal Product Supply and Control  
The Sponsor will supply the IMP for this study.  The IMP for this study includes bempedoic acid 
(180- mg film- coated tablets) and matching placebo (film -coated tablets).  IMP will be distributed 
and released in accordance with regional and local requirements during the conduct of the study. 
The medical identific ation ( MED ID ) number (an identifier on the study drug packaging ) will be 
obtained via IWRS and used to select placebo for the single-blind placebo run-in period and 
double-blind IMP for the treatment period from available clinical supplies at the clinical site .  
A 35 -day supply of single-blind placebo drug will be dispensed one time at Week - 4 (Visit S2) 
for the 4 -week placebo run-in period of the study.  Double-blind IMP will be dispensed in one 
100-day supply increments (one 100 -day supply bottle) to pat ients by appropriate clinical site 
personnel at Week  0 (Visit T1) .  Patients will bring their bottle at each subsequent visit for 
tablets to be counted by study personnel.  After tablets have been counted, the same bottle will 
be reissued to patients at Week  4 (Visit T2) and Week  8 (Visit T3) with the bottle being returned 
to study site at Week  12/EOS for the final count.   
A 30 -day supply of open- label ezetimibe 10  mg will be dispensed  at Week -4 (Visit S2) for the 
run-in period of the study.  A 90- day s upply will be dispensed at Week 0 (Visit T1).  Patients 
will bring their bottle to  each subsequent visit for tablets to be counted by study personnel.  After 
tablets hav e been counted, the same bottle will be reissued to patients at Week  4 (Visit T2 ) and 
Week 8 (Visit T3) with the bottle being returned to study site at Week  12/EOS for the final 
count.  
Please see Pharmacy Manual for detailed storage requirements and management instructions.  
9.2. Administration of Investigational Medicinal Product  
Patients will b e instructed to ingest study-supplied ezetimibe 10  mg and single -blind placebo 
starting  at Visit S2 for the duration the placebo run- in period and the IMP starting at Visit T1 for 
the duration of treatment period orally once daily (once every 24 hours) at approximately the 
same time each day with water.  Ezetimibe and IMP may be taken with or without food.  On 
clinic visit days, patients will be instructed to delay ingestion of ezetimibe and IMP until all 
study procedures have been completed.  If a patient arrives at clinic on Visits  T2, T3, or T4  
without having fasted or having taken ezetimibe and/or IMP before arriving at the clinic, the visit should be rescheduled for the next day or as soon as possible so that the fasting and dosing 
requirements can be met.  Patients will be instructed to return all packaging and unused IMP and 
ezetimibe  at each clinic visit.   
If the patient forgets to take ezetimibe and/or IMP at the usual time on nonclinic visit days, it 
may be taken up to 12 hours later the same day.  After that time, the patient should not take the 
medication that day and should resume ingestion of the medicine the following day.  If a patient 
fails to take  ezetimibe and/or  IMP, details describing the reasons for nondosing should be 
documented in the patient’s medical records and electronic case report form  (eCRF ).  Extra 
ezetimibe and IMP (7  extra days per bottle) will be  provided and can be used, if needed, prior to

damaged.  
9.3. Investigational Medicinal Product Accountability  
Accurate records of the receipt of all IMP and Sponsor- supplied ezetimibe  shipped by the 
Sponsor (or designee) and the disposition of that IMP and ezetimibe  must be maintained .  
IMP/ezetimibe  records or logs must comply with applicable regulations, local law, and 
guidelines, and should include: 
• Amount received/placed in storage area  
• Amount currently in storage area 
• MED ID number  
• Dates and initials of person(s) responsible for invent ory (including 
entry/movement/disposition) 
• Date and amount of dispensed to each patient, including unique patient identifiers 
• Date was returned by patient, assessment of compliance, and relevant documentation 
of discrepancies  
• Nonstudy disposition (eg, lost, broken, wasted) 
• Amount returned to Sponsor/Sponsor’s designee/destroyed or amount destroyed per local standard operating procedure (SOP) following accountability by site monitor. 
9.4. Investigational Medicinal Product Handling and Disposal  
Upon completion or termination of the study, all used and unused IMP with the IMP packaging and ezetimibe must be returned to the Sponsor (or designee) for eventual destruction unless 
otherwise authorized by the Sponsor.  All IMP returns must be accompanied by the appropriat e 
documentation.

10.1. Informed Consent  
The patient must be adequately informed of the nature and risks of the study and understand the 
informed consent document (ICD).  No study-related procedure will be performed until the 
patient has been com pletely informed of the study, has freely consented to take part in the study, 
and has signed and dated an ICD approved by the Sponsor (or designee) and the IRB  or IEC.  
10.2. Procedures and Schedule of Assessments 
Patients who provide informed consent and sign the ICD will be eligible to begin screening for 
the study.  The study is comprised of 3 distinct periods:  screening , single -blind placebo and 
ezetimibe  run-in, and double- blind treatment.  
The schedule of study events is provided in Appendix 1.  However, a patient can be seen at any time for reasons of safety .  
Data will be captured on eCRFs .  Randomization, drug supply (re)ordering, and patient tracking 
will occur via I WRS.  Instructions for these systems will be provided separately. 
10.2.1. Screening Week -5 (Visit S1; Day -35 to ± 7 days) 
The screening period will begin with a screening visit that will occur approximately 5  weeks 
prior to randomization.  At the investigator’s discretion, screening may be extended for an additional 4 weeks , if needed , to adjust background medical therapy or for other reasons as 
specified in the protocol.  Visit S1 will allow the investigator to assess the patient’s preli minary 
eligibility .  After the patient provides written informed consent ( Section  10.1), th e patient will 
undergo the following assessments and proc edures at Visit S1: 
• Informed consent 
• Review of all inclusion/exclusion criteria that can be assessed at this time  
• Demographics 
• Clinically relevant medical history   
• Concomitant and prohibited medication review 
• Weight (kg)  
• Height (cm), BMI (kg/m2) 
• Vital signs  
• Serum pregnancy test (on appropriate female patients) /FSH  
• TSH

• Conduct diet and exercise counseling 
• Contact I WRS to register the patient  
Patients who meet all enrollment criteria that can be assessed at Visit S1 will be instructed to 
continue their background LMT for lipid regulation and to maintain consistent diet a nd exercise 
patterns throughout the study.  Patients who fail to meet any entry criterion that can be assessed 
at Visit S1 are considered to be screen failures and are not required to return for additional visits 
(although a patient can be seen at any time for safety reasons).  
Under rare circumstances, p atients who are considered to be screen failures due to not meeting 
stability requirements for a condition or concurrent medication that is  considered to warrant 
rescreening after consultation with the Spons or (or designee)  may be rescreened.  These patients 
must be re-consented, re-registered in the IWRS, and will have a new patient ID number 
assigned.  
10.2.2. Placebo  and Ezetimibe  Run in Week -4 (Visit S2; Da y -28 to ±3 days) 
Prior to scheduling Visit S2, review the screening clinical results to evaluate whether the patient continues to meet eligibility criteria.

10.3. Subject Withdrawal Criteria 
10.3.1. Early Withdrawal from the Study 
Patients must remain in the study until the last scheduled visit at Week  12 (Visit T4) to be 
considered as having completed participation in the study.  
Patients who withdraw from IMP and/or ezetimibe prior to Week 12 (Visit T4) for any reason 
will be asked to continue to be followed for safety assessments, including basic fasting lipids , at 
clinic visit following the protocol-specified visit schedule (see Appendix 1 ).   
Patients who temporarily withdraw from IMP and/or ezetimibe prior to Week 12 (Visit T4) for 
any reason may restart IMP and/or ezetimibe providing that (1) the patient and the investigator 
are in agreement regarding this course of action, (2) the patient has been off of IMP for 4 weeks 
or less; and (3) IMP can be started as soon as possible.  For cases where the patient has been off of IMP for more than 4 weeks, the investigator must contact the medical monitor for approval 
prior to restarting IMP.  
Patients who refuse  to continue to return to the clinic for safety assessments will be asked to 
participate in phone calls from the site at protocol- specified visits (see Appendix 1) , or at a 
minimum at 12 weeks,  to collect information on AEs, concomitant medications, and current 
health status.   
The patient’s decision to participate in the clinical study is voluntary .  Patients may refuse to 
continue in the study and/or withdraw from participation in this study at any time, for any reason, 
speci fied or unspecified, and without penalty or loss of benefits to which the patient is otherwise 
entitled.  
It is the right and duty of the investigator  to interrupt the treatment of any patient whose health or 
well-being may be threatened by continuation in this study .  Such patients should be withdrawn 
from the study and should not be continued under a modified regimen. 
Patients who are withdrawn from the study may not re- enter .  The reasons for withdrawal from 
this study may include:  
• Patient’s withdrawal o f consent  
• Failure to comply with the protocol 
• Lost to follow-up 
• Illness, condition, or procedural complication (including AEs) affecting the patient’s 
ability to participate or requiring prohibited medication  
• The Sponsor or investigator terminates the stud y  
• In the investigator’s judgment, it is deemed in the best interest of the patient to discontinue his/her participation in the study 
• Any other reason

10.3.2. Procedures for Early Withdrawal  
If a patient withdraws or is removed from the study for any reason, the patient should comple te 
an En d of Study visit.  Reason for withdrawal, date of the discontinuation, and date of the last 
dose of study drug should be recorded in the appropriate section of the eCRF.  Additionally, the 
discontinuation visit date must be registered in IWRS.  Stu dy drug assigned to the withdrawn 
patient may not be assigned to another patient. 
All effort should be made to have each patient complete all study visits on schedule according to 
the protocol.  Accommodations for early or late visits in special circumstances will be considered 
by the Sponsor to prevent early withdrawal .  Written notice (regardless of cause) is to be 
provided within 48 hours of the withdrawal to the Sponsor personnel or the Medical Monitor.  At 
the time of discontinuation, every effort should be made to ensure all relevant procedures and 
evaluations scheduled for the final study visit are performed.  Except in the case of a medical 
emergency, the procedures and assessments detailed  in Section  10.3 will be performed upon the 
discontinuation of the study.

11.1. Safety Parameters  
At all clinic visits, investigators will review all safety information including vital signs, AEs, 
concomitant medications , and ECG reports and will ensure that the collected data are recorded 
into the appropriate eCRF.  Additionally, clinical laboratory samples will be collected and sent for analysis and the investigator will review the results to ensure continued patient safety while 
participating in the study.   
11.1.1. Demographic/Medical History  
Demographic data and a complete medical history will be obtained from the patient.  For medical history, conditions t hat are relevant and/or clinically significant should be captured with at least a 
start date (month and year) and whether the condition is ongoing or resolved.  All surgeries regardless of date should be reported.  
11.1.2. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include diastolic and systolic blood pressure as well as heart rate.  
The patient should sit quietly for 5 minutes prior to collection of vital signs.  At all time points, 
vitals will be collected prior to blood collection.  Blood pressure and heart rate will be me asured 
using a calibrated, fully automated machine with a cuff that is appropriate to the size of the upper arm.  If a fully automated machine is not available, blood pressure may be measured manually.  The same method (either automated or manual) and the same arm (right or left) must be used 
throughout the study.  The patient should be in a seated position with feet touching the floor.  Patients should be seated quietly for at least 5  minutes in a chair with their backs supported, their 
feet flat on the gr ound, and their arms bared and supported at heart level. 
11.1.3. Weight, Height, and Body Mass Index  
Body weight will be measured in the morning using consistent scales while the patient is fasting, 
after voiding, and without shoes and outerwear (eg, coats).  
Heig ht will be measured using standard clinic procedures.  
BMI will be calculated using the formula:  
BMI (kg/m
2) = weight in kg  / (height in meters)2 
11.1.4. Physical Examination 
Physical examinations (PE) will include an assessment of the following:  
• General appearance  
• Skin 
• Eyes, ears, nose, and throat 
• Head and neck  
Bempedoic acid   Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol 1002-048  Amendment 2, 10 February 2017  
Confidential Page 52 of 144 • Extremities  
• Musculoskeletal examination  
• Respiratory examination  
• Cardiovascular assessment, including rhythm and presence of cardiac abnormalities 
• Abdominal examination  
• Neurologic examination  including documentation of the presence of abnormalities in 
mental status and motor and sensory function 
• Any additional assessments necessary to establish baseline status or evaluate 
symptoms or adverse experiences 
Documentation of the PE  findings will be includ ed in the source documentation at the clinical 
site.  Significant findings prior to the start of study drug will be recorded on the Medical 
History/Current Medical Conditions page of the eCRF.  Only changes from baseline physical 
examination findings that meet the definition of an AE will be recorded on the AE page of the 
eCRF.  
Note:  Additional information will be collected regarding muscle -related AEs.  See 
Section  12.7.2. 
11.1.5. Electrocardiogram  
ECG collection will be preceded by a 10 -minute rest time during which the patient will remain in 
the supine position.  At each time point , ECGs will be collected prior to blood collection .  ECGs 
will be assessed using machine readings and physician review.  
11.1.5.1. Monitoring and Management of Abnormal Electrocardiograms 
If a clinically significant ECG abnormality not present at baseline (screening) is determined by 
the investigator  to be related to study drug, the abnormality will be discussed with the Sponsor 
personnel or the authorized Medical Monitor .  The event will be followed and evaluated with 
additional tests (if necessary) until the underlying cause is determined or the event is brought to an acceptable resolution .  Additional clinical and laboratory information will be collected and 
carefully documented in order to better characterize the ECG abnormality and rule out 
alternative causes .  ECG findings determined to be a clinically significant change from baseline 
should be reported as an AE regardless of causality. 
Unscheduled ECG assessments will be completed at the discretion of the investigator . 
11.1.6. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
11.1.6.1. Laboratory Parameters (Safety) 
Patients will be in a  seated position during the blood collection.  Clinical laboratory parameters 
and tests will include those listed in  Table 3.  Collection schedule, schedule of laboratory 
parameters by visit,  and instructions are in the Clinical Laboratory Manual provided by the 
Central Laboratory .

11.1.6.2. Sample Collection, Storage, and Shipping  
Clinical laboratory samples will be collected by appropriate clinical site personnel and then 
shipped according to a separate laboratory manual provided by the central l aboratory.   
Blood draws for lipids, TG, and glucose must meet the fasting criteri on listed below.  If this 
criteri on has not been met, these blood samples will NOT be collected .  If this criteri on can be 
met by rescheduling the clinic visit to occur within 3  days, the lipid, TG, and/or glucose blood 
samples will be collected at the reschedu led clinic visit only.  
• Blood samples will be drawn after a minimum 1 0-hour fast (water is allowed) 
11.1.6.3. General Monitoring and Management of Abnormal Clinical Labs 
It is the investigators’ responsibility to review the results of all laboratory tests as they become 
available and to sign and date the report to document their review .  For each laboratory test 
outside of the laboratory normal range, the investigator  needs to ascertain if this is a clinically 
significant change from baseline for the individual patient, with baseline defined as the last value 
Bempedoic acid   Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol 1002-048  Amendment 2, 10 February 2017  
Confidential Page 55 of 144 or observation before the first dose of study drug .  The investigator may repeat the laboratory test 
or request additional tests to verify the results of the original laboratory test. 
If a laboratory value is determined to be an abnormal and clinically significant change from 
baseline for the patient, the investigator  should determine if it qualifies as an AE  (as described 
below), and if yes, an appropriate eCRF will be completed .  All clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities occurring during the study that were not present at baseline should be followed and evaluated with additional tests if necessary, until diagnosis of the underlying cause or resolution.  Specific monitoring and management guidelines for laboratories of special interest are outlined 
in the sections below. 
An abnormal laboratory value that is not already associated with an AE is to be recorded as an 
AE only if any one of the following criteria is met: 
• an action on the study drug is made as a result of the abnormality 
• intervention for management of the abnormality is required 
• at the discretion of the investigator should the abnormality be deemed clinically 
significant  
11.1.6.3.1. Mon itoring and Management of Elevated Liver Function Tests 
If at any time after randomization a patient experiences a new  ALT and/or AST >3 × ULN, the 
patient will undergo repeat confirmatory liver function test (LFT) assessment as soon as is 
reasonably possible, preferably within 3 to 7 days of the laboratory result becoming available.  
Repeat LFT assessment will include:  (1) measurement of ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total 
and direct bilirubin, prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio ( INR), eosinophil 
count, CK, anti hepatitis  A virus (total), HBsAg (confirmation of screening measurement), 
hepatitis  C virus ( HCV) (confirmation of screening measurement), and anti-
cytomegalovirus/immunoglobulin M; (2) history of concomitant medication use; (3) history of 
exposure to environmental chemical agents, including ethanol; and (4) query for related 
symptoms .  Additionally, further testing such as liver ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI ) scanning may be warranted to rule out additional pathology depending on clinical 
presentation and should be discussed with the Sponsor personnel or the authorized Medical Monitor.  
• If repeat LFT assessment confirms ALT  and/or AST  >3 × ULN, consideration should 
be given to withdrawing the patient and administering no further doses of study drug.  
At the investigator’s discretion, study drug may be interrupted and the patient 
rechallenged with study drug after LFTs have returned to baseline levels.  
• If repeat LFT assessment confirms ALT and/or AST >5  × ULN, patient should be 
withdrawn from IMP treatment,  but will be asked to  continue to be followe d for 
safety using the protocol-specified visit schedule (see Appendix 1)  or more frequently 
as determined by the investigator . 
• If repeat LFT assessment confirms ALT and/or AST >3  × ULN in addition to any of 
the following, the patient should be given no further IMP treatment,  but will be asked 
Bempedoic acid   Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol 1002-048  Amendment 2, 10 February 2017  
Confidential Page 56 of 144 to continue to be followed for safety using the protocol-specified visit schedule (see 
Appendix 1)  or more frequently as determined by the investigator: 
− TB >2 × ULN  
Note:  In the case of patients with Gilbert’s disease, TB will be fractionated and 
the determination of 2 × ULN will be based upon direct (conjugated) bilirubin. 
− INR >1.5 × ULN (unless the patient is on stable dose of anticoagulation 
medicati on) 
− Appearance or worsening of right upper abdominal discomfort, anorexia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, fever, rash, or eosinophilia 
11.1.6.3.2. Monitoring and Management of Elevated Serum Creatinine 
If at any time after randomization, a patient experiences a decrease i n eGFR to the level of  
15 mL/min /1.73 m
2) or if the patient experiences acute renal failure, the patient should be 
withdrawn from IMP treatment but will be asked  to continue to be followed for safety using the 
protocol-specified visit schedule (see Appendix 1 ) 
11.1.6.3.3. Monitoring and Management of Hemoglobin Change 
If at any time after randomization a patient experiences a Hgb decrease >2.0  g/dL (20  g/L) from 
baseline (Week  0 [Visit T1]), the patient will undergo repeat confirmatory hematology testing as 
soon as is reasonably possible, preferably within 3 to 7 days of the laboratory result becoming 
available.  
Repeat hematology assessment will include:  (1) measurement of Hgb, hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, platelet count, reticulocyte count (percent and absolute), red blood cell count (RBC), 
and white blood cell count (WBC) with differential (absolute values only); (2) history of 
concomitant medication use; and (3) query for related symptoms.  Additionally, further testing may be warranted to rule out additional pathology depending on clinical presentation, and should 
be discussed with Sponsor personnel or the authorized Medical Monitor.  
• If repeat Hgb assessment confirms a decrease >2.0  g/dL (20  g/L) from baseline, the 
patient should be monitored carefully during the study and return at 2- week intervals 
after study complet ion for additional Hgb measurement until the level returns to 
baseline or reaches a stable level.   
• If repeat Hgb assessment confirms Hgb <8  g/dL (80  g/L), the patient should be 
withdrawn from IMP treatment.  The patient will return at 1 -week intervals after 
withdrawing from IMP treatment for additional Hgb measurement until the level 
returns to baseline or reaches a satisfactory conclusion.  
• If the patient is withdrawn from IMP treatment,  the patient  should be asked to 
continue being  followed for safety using the protocol- specified visit schedule  (see 
Appendix 1).  
At any time, the investigator may choose to consult with a specia list to further evaluate the cause 
of the alteration in Hgb.

Confidential Page 57 of 144 11.1.6.3.4. Monitoring and Management of Elevated Creatine Kinase 
If at any time after randomization a patient experiences a marked CK elevation >5 × ULN, the 
patient will undergo repeat confirmatory assessment as soon as is reasonably possible, preferably 
within 3  to 7 days of the laboratory result becoming available.  
Repeat CK assessment will include query for related symptoms.  
• If the repeat CK assessment confirms an unexplained (ie, not associated with recent 
trauma or physically strenuous activity) CK abnormality >5 × ULN, if asymptomatic 
the patient should receive further assessment and investigation into the cause, assess 
whether there is renal injury , and measure CK approximately weekly or more 
freque ntly if clinically indicated  until resolution.  If CK levels continue to rise; IMP 
and study- supplied ezetimibe  should be discontinued.   
• If symptomatic , the following steps should be completed: 
− Hold IMP  and study- supplied ezetimibe  
− Clarification of the nature, duration, and intensity of muscle symptoms 
− Review possible predisposing factors, such as unaccustomed exercise, heavy 
alcohol intake, viral illness (consider performing serology)  
− Evaluation for additional diagnoses or other conditions which can ca use 
myopathy including muscle tenderness (by PE), weakness, rash, measurement of 
serum creatinine, dipstick urinalysis with microscopy if indicated  
− Obtain clinical chemistries to assess the possibility of lactic acidosis  
− Follow symptoms and CK until the abnormality has resolved  
− If based on the above evaluation an alternative explanation is suspected, 
consideration can be given to resuming IMP once CK returns to baseline levels 
− If no alternative explanation exists,  consideration should be given to withdrawing 
the patient from IMP treatment.  
• If the repeat CK assessment confirms an unexplained (ie, not associated with recent 
trauma or physically strenuous activity) CK abnormality as listed below, the patient 
should be withdrawn and given no further doses of study drug:  
− >10 × ULN, even in the absence of symptoms.  
− In all cases, evaluate the signs/symptoms and laboratory evaluations as outlined 
above. 
• If the patient is withdrawn from IMP treatment, the patient should be asked to 
continue being followed for safety using the protocol- specified visit schedule (see 
Appendix 1).

Confidential Page 58 of 144 11.1.6.3.5. Monitoring and Management of Potential Hypoglycemia and Metabolic Acidosis 
Patients w ill be educated on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.  If such signs and 
symptoms are experienced, patients will be instructed to report these signs and symptoms to the 
investigator.  
During each study visit, patients will be reminded to report all signs and symptoms associated 
with hypoglycemia to the investigator.  For each occurrence of patient-reported signs and 
symptoms associated with hypoglycemia, the investigator will discuss these symptoms with the patient and assess whether they are attributable to hypoglycemia or to another potential cause.  
All investigator -confirmed occurrences of hypoglycemia will be recorded as an AE.  All 
occurrences of signs and symptoms that are not confirmed by the investigator to be attributable 
to hypoglycemia will be reported using the appropriate diagnosis. 
Clinical laboratories will be assessed to determine any signs of anion gap metabolic acidosis.  If laboratories are consistent with metabolic acidosis, immediate follow up with the patient for further medical evaluation of the acidosis.  This event should be captured as an AE. 
11.1.6.3.6. Monitoring and Management of Elevated Triglycerides  
Patients may continue to use stable doses of TG-lowering medications during the study.  An adjunctive therapy plan is in place for those patients whose TG values meet the protocol-defined 
threshold criteria.  Post-randomization, TG results will be masked to investigators in order to 
maintain the blind; however, a threshold has been set to notify investigators and provide an opportunity to adjust the patient’s standard of care regimen.  Beginning at Week 4 (Visit T2), if 
the TG level exceeds 1000  mg/dL (11.3 mmol/L) while on treatment, the investigator will 
receive notification from the central laboratory that the patient has met or exceeded the protocol-
defined threshold criteria for TG.  The investigator will initiate the following plan:  
• Any patient with TG >1000  mg/dL (11.3 mmol/L), will be reminded to fast for at 
least 10  hours and will return to clinic within 1 week for a repeat, fasting TG sample 
to confirm the TG value meets the threshold criteria  
• Any patient with a confirmed TG >1000 mg/dL (11.3 mmol/L) may initiate standard -
of-care therapy to lower TG using a patient -specific prescription.  The initiation of 
this medication will be documented on the case report form as a concomitant 
medication with the associated start date.  These medications will not be provided by the Sponsor. 
• Patients continuing to exceed the TG threshold after maximizing the standard -of-care 
triglyceride -lowering therapy will be discontinued from IMP treatment and will be 
asked to continue to be followed for safety using the protocol-specified visit schedule 
(see Appendix 1).  
• Please see the Clinical Laboratory Manual  and Section  11.1.6.2 for sample collection 
and instructions. 
11.1.6.4. Pharmacokinetic A ssessments 
Pharmacokinetic assessments to measure plasma concentrations of ETC -1002 and its metabolite 
ESP15228 will be conducted from 6 mL whole blood samples collected .  At the time of sample 
Bempedoic acid   Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol 1002-048  Amendment 2, 10 February 2017  
Confidential Page 59 of 144 collection, the date and time of blood draw and the last 2 dos es of study medication will be 
collected.  Pharmacokinetic sample analyses for ETC -1002 and ESP15228 will be conducted by 
the bioanalytical laboratory. 
11.1.6.5. Collection and Assessment of Pharmacokinetic Samples  
Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected from patients prior to dose at Week 4 (Visit T2), 
Week  8 (Visit T3), and Week 12 (Visit T4) , dosing time and PK sampling time must be 
documented, for use in further developing the population PK model.  
Plasma concentrations of ETC -1002 and its metabolite (ESP15228) will be determined using 
validated methods.  Plasma PK samples will be labeled with preprinted information, including 
study number, patient identification number, study day, nominal time of sample collection, matrix, and a text identification (ie, “Plasma  PK”).  See the study laboratory manual for further 
instructions. 
11.1.6.6. Shipment of Pharmacokinetic Samples  
Plasma PK samples will be shipped frozen on dry ice according to instructions provided in the 
laboratory manual.  
11.1.6.7. Total Blood Volume of Clinical Laboratory and Pharmacokinetic Samples  
The total number of venipunctures and total volume of whole blood collected during the study will be limited to that needed for safety monitoring,  PK, efficacy, and biomarker assessment .  
Total whole blood volume collected over the study duration is not to exceed approximately 
250 mL for each patient.  
11.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
11.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a 
pharmaceutical product, including control, and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with treatment.  
An AE can be:  
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product 
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease  
• Any deterioration in nonprotocol-required measurements of laboratory value or other clinical test (eg, ECG or x -ray) that results in symptoms, a change in treatment, or 
discontinuation from study drug 
• TEAEs are defined as AEs that begin or worsen after the first dose of study drug 
• Adverse drug reaction (ADR; see Section  11.2.2)  
Bempedoic acid   Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol 1002-048  Amendment 2, 10 February 2017  
Confidential Page 60 of 144 11.2.2. Adverse Drug Reaction  
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be 
considered an ADR.  “Responses” to a medicinal product means that a causal rel ationship 
between a medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility (ie,  the relationship 
cannot be ruled out). 
An unexpected ADR is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not 
consistent with the applicable product information (eg, IB for an unapproved investigational 
product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product). 
11.2.3. Reporting  
All AEs occurring during the course of the study (starting from signing informed consent to 
study co mpletion  or discontinuation) will be collected on the AE eCRF . Patients should be 
instructed to report any AE that they experience through 30 days following the last dose of IMP to the investigator .  Any SAE that occurs within 30 days following the last study visit should be 
reported to the Sponsor per Section  11.3.  Beginning with Visit S2 (Week  -4), investigator s 
should make an assessment for AEs at each visit and record the event on the appropriate AE eCRF.  
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by the investigator and recorded on the eCRF.  However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or syndrome by the investigator, it should be recorded as a separate AE on the eCRF.  Additionally, 
the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth 
extraction, transfusion) should be recorded as an AE, not the procedure.  
Any medical condition already present at screening or baseline should not be reported as an AE 
unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at baseline change in severity or 
seriousness at any time during the study .  In this case, it should be reported as an AE. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examina tion (eg, ECG) findings that are 
detected during the study or are present at baseline and significantly worsen during the study should be reported as AEs.  The investigator  will exercise his or her medical and scientific 
judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is 
clinically significant.  Significant abnormal laboratory values occurring during the clinical study 
will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically signif icant .  Any abnormal test that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an 
AE. 
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity, seriousness, and causal relationship to the investigational drug .  For each AE, the following information wi ll be recorded:  
• Description of the event (eg, headache)  
• Date of onset  
• Date of resolution (or that the event is continuing) 
• Action taken as a result of the event  
• Seriousness of the event 
Bempedoic acid   Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol 1002-048  Amendment 2, 10 February 2017  
Confidential Page 61 of 144 • Severity of the event  
• Outcome of the event  
• Investigator’s assessment o f relationship to study drug 
A cluster of signs and symptoms that results from a single cause should be reported as a single 
AE (eg, fever, elevated WBC, cough, abnormal chest x- ray, etc, can all be reported as 
“pneumonia”). 
The investigator will carefully  evaluate the comments of the patient and the response to 
treatment in order that he/she may judge the true nature and severity of the AE .  The question of 
the relationship of AEs to study drug administration should be determined by the investigator or 
study physician after thorough consideration of all facts that are available.  
Additional information will be collected regarding muscle -related AEs that may include, but may 
not necessarily be limited to, a muscle -related questionnaire, with questions regardi ng type of 
muscle -related symptoms, location of the muscle- related AE, and potential cause of the muscle-
related AE .  
11.2.4. Severity  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to assess the intensity (severity) of an AE.  
The severity of the AE will be characterized as mild, moderate, or severe according to the 
following definitions: 
• Mild:  Events are usually transient and do not interfere with the patient’s daily 
activities  
• Moderate:  Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the patient 
and may interfere with daily activities  
• Severe:  Events interrupt the patient’s usual daily activity, are incapacitating with 
inability to do usual activities, or significantly affect clinical status and warrant 
intervention and/or close follow-up 
Note :  A severe AE need not be serious and an SAE need not, by definition, be severe. 
11.2.5. Relationship  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to assess the relationship of the AE to  both the IMP and 
ezetimibe .  The degree of “relatedness” of the AE to the IMP and ezetimibe  should be described 
using the following scale: 
• Not Related :  No temporal association and other etiologies are likely the cause. 
• Unlikely:  While cannot be definitively ruled as not related to IMP, a causal 
association is remote, and other etiologies are more likely to be the cause.  For 
reporting and summarization, events assessed as “Unlikely” to be related to IMP will be considered as “Not Related” to IMP for regulatory report ing purposes.  
• Possible : Temporal association, but other etiologies are likely the cause.  However, 
involvement of the study drug cannot be excluded. 
Bempedoic acid   Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol 1002-048  Amendment 2, 10 February 2017  
Confidential Page 62 of 144 • Probable :  Temporal association, other etiologies are possible but unlikely.  The event 
may respond if the study drug is discontinued. 
• Definite:  Established temporal association with administration of the study drug with 
no other more probable cause.  Typically, the event should resolve when the study 
drug is discontinued and recur on re- challenge.  
11.2.6. Monitoring  and Follow- up of Adverse Events  
Patients having AEs will be monitored with relevant clinical assessments and laboratory tests, as determined by the investigator.  All follow -up results are to be reported to the Sponsor personnel 
or the authorized Medical Monitor.  Any actions taken and follow up results must be recorded either on the appropriate page of the eCRF or in appropriate follow-up written correspondence, as well as in the patient’s source documentation .  Follow-up laboratory results should be filed 
with the patient’s source documentation. 
For all AEs that require the patient to be discontinued from the study, relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory tests must be repeated at appropriate intervals until final  resolution, 
stabilization of the event(s) , or until the patient is lost to follow -up or dies. 
Patients with AEs that are ongoing at study completion or study withdrawal must be followed 
until resolution or for 30 days after the last study visit, whichever  comes first  (see Section  11.3).  
11.2.7. Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events  
TEAE are defined as AEs that begin or worsen after the first dose of study drug. 
11.2.7.1. Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Resu lts in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or substantial disruption of 
the ability to conduct normal life functions 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• An important medical event 
Note:  Hospitalization is defined as a formal inpatient admiss ion.  This will not include 
admissions under “23-hour Observational Status”, an emergency room visit without hospital admission , or an urgent care visit and therefore such events will not be recorded as an SAE under 
this criterion, nor will hospitalization  for an elective or outpatient procedure scheduled or 
planned before signing of informed consent.  However, unexpected complications and/or prolongation of hospitalization that occur during elective or outpatient surgery should be 
recorded as AEs and asses sed for seriousness.  Admission to the hospital for social or situational

Clinical Study Protocol 1002-048  Amendment 2, 10 February 2017  
Confidential Page 63 of 144 reasons (eg, no place to stay, live too far away to come for hospital visits) will not be considered 
inpatient hospitalizations.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition .  Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room, blood dyscrasias, 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse. 
Any clinical endpoints that meet SAE criteria  will be also reported as SAEs.  The CEC will 
adjudicate clinical endpoints  in a blinded fashion, but the DMC will review clinical endpoints 
and SAEs in an unblinded fashion. 
11.2.7.2. Definition of Serious Adverse Event s or Outcomes not Qualifying as Serious 
Adverse Events  
The following are not considered SAEs and therefore do not need to be reported as such: 
• Preplanned or elective hospitalization including social and/or convenience situations 
(eg, due to inclement weather) 
• Overdose of either Esperion study drug or concomitant medication unless the event meets SAE criteria (eg, hospitalization).  However, the event sh ould still be captured 
as a non serious AE on the appropriate eCRF page 
11.2.7.3. Clinical Laboratory Assessments as Adve rse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to assess the clinical significance of all abnormal values 
as defined by the list of reference ranges from the local laboratory.  In some cases, significant 
changes in lab v alues within the normal range will require similar judgment.  
11.3. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, occurring from the time of informed consent 
until 30 days following the last dose of IMP ( for most patients 30  days following their Week 12 
visit), must be reported by the principal  investigator or designee to the authorized s afety designee 
within 24 hours of the principal investigator  or the clinical site becoming aware of the 
occurrence.  All SAEs that the inves tigator  considers related to study drug that occur after the 
30-day follow-up of the study period must be reported to the Sponsor.  
To report the SAE, complete the provided SAE form  and submit it to the safety designee within 
24 hours of becoming aware of the occurrence.  
The investigator is required to submit SAE reports to the IRB /IEC  in accordance with local 
requirements .  All investigators involved in studies using the same investigational product will 
receive any safety alert notifications for onward submission to their local IRB as required.  All 
reports sent to investigators will be blinded. All SAEs should be recorded on the eCRF and source documents.  Criteria for documenting the 
relationship to study drug and severity will be the same as those previously described. 
Bempedoic acid   Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol 1002-048  Amendment 2, 10 February 2017  
Confidential Page 64 of 144 The investigator must continue to follow the patient until the SAE has subsided or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment), or the 
patient dies.  
Within 24 hours of receipt of follow-up information, the investigator  must update the SAE form 
and submit any supporting documentation (eg, patient discharge summary or autopsy reports) to the safety designee.  
11.3.1. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Authorities  
The Sponsor (and/or designee)  is responsible for submitting expedited reports of suspected and 
unexpected serious adverse reactions  (SUSARS) to the appropriate regulatory authorities.  All 
investigator s participating in  ongoing clinical studies with the study drug will be notified by the 
Sponsor (or designee) of SUSARs.   SUSARS must be communicated as soon as possible to the 
appropriate IRB /IEC by the investigator, as applicable and/or reported in accordance with local 
laws and regulations.  Investigators should provide writ ten documentation of IRB /IEC  
notification for each report to the Sponsor. 
SAEs that are anticipated to occur in this patient population will be collected and reported by the 
investigator  as described in Section  11.3.  However, these events will not be submitted to the 
regulatory authorities as expedited reports unless they meet SUSAR criteria.  These events that 
are considered to be exempt from expedit ed reporting include the following clinical endpoints: 
• CV death  
• Nonfatal MI  
• Nonfatal stroke 
• Unstable angina requiring hospitalization  
• Coronary revascularization  
• Heart failure requiring hospitalization  
• Noncoronary arterial revascularization  
11.3.2. Reporting of Patient Death  
The death of any patient during the study, or within the 30-day follow-up period after they have 
completed the study ( regardless of the cause ), must be reported as detailed in Section  11.3. 
11.3.3. Reports of Pregnancy  
Although not considered an SAE (unless the event occurs with a serious outcome), pregnancy information on female patients will be collected by the authorized safety desi gnee .  If a female 
patient becomes  pregnant during the course of the study, study treatment should be discontinued 
immediately.  The principal  investigator  or designee must complete and submit the Pregnancy 
Report Form within 24 hours of awareness  of the pregnancy.  In addition, patients who become 
pregnant will complete the Week  12/End of Study evaluations  according to Appendix 1.  
Whenever possible, pregnancies should be followed until outcome and the Pregnancy Outcome Reporting Form submitted to the safety designee once the outcome is known.

Adverse events of special interest (AESI) include metabolic acidosis (clinical laboratories), 
hepatic, muscular (AE and CK ev aluation), new onset diabetes/hyperglycemia, renal, 
cardiovascular, and neurocognitive/neurologic events.  Based on previous experience with 
bempedoic acid , uric acid and hemoglobin will be closely monitored.  Safety monitoring 
guidelines for hemoglobin are detailed in Section  11.1.6.3.3.  S pecific monitoring guidelines are 
provided in the case of AEs uncovered through laboratory evaluations.  Patients are to be queried at each study visit regarding changes in cognition and or signs/symptoms of hypoglycemia.  
The protocol procedures included in the bempedoic acid clinical studies are part of standard clinical care for patients with elevated LDL -C and also address the potential and theoretic risks 
of bempedoic acid.  
All bempedoic acid studies will include standard pharmacovigilance including evaluation of 
AEs, PE findings, vital signs, and laboratory assessments.  Cardiovascular events will be adjudicated by an independent CEC in accordance with a prespecified charter.

11.5. Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent D MC will monitor  unblinded accumu lating patient safety and efficacy  data until 
the last patient has completed study treatment.  In addition, data on SAE s and deaths, including 
clinical endpoints, will be monitored by the D MC during this period.  At each D MC review, 
relevant unblinded safety and efficacy  information from ongoing studies of bempedoic acid  will 
be provided to the DMC by an independent unblinded statistician and programmer.  Additional 
details will be provided in a D MC Charter.  
11.6. Clinical Event Committee 
A blinded independent expert CEC will adjudicate designated clinical endpoints, including all MACE and non-MACE endpoints defined as: CV death (MACE), non-CV death (non- MACE), 
nonfatal MI (MACE), nonfatal stroke (MACE), hospitalization for unstable angina (MACE), coronary revascularization (MACE), non- coronary arterial revascularization (non -MACE), and

11.7.1. Lipid Parameters  
Basic fasting lipid samples will be collected during Screening (Visit s S1 and  S3) and at the 
4 double- blind treatment visits (Visits  T1, T2, T3, and T4) .  Lipid a ssessments will be performed  
as follows: 
• Calculated  TC, LDL-C, HDL -C, non- HDL -C, and TG.  
− If TG exceeds 400  mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L) or LDL -C is ≤50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L), 
direct measure of LDL -C will be conducted. 
Additional fasting lipids and other biomarkers, including apoB and hs- CRP , will be collected at 
Visits  T1 and T4.  
11.7.2. Clinical Safety Laboratory Tests 
Clinical Safety laboratory samples will be collected Screening (Visit S1) and at the 
4 double- blind treatment visits (Visits  T1, T2, T3, and T4).   
Blood draws for lipids (and glucose) must meet the criteria below.  If thes e criteria have not been 
met, these blood samples will NOT be collected.  If these criteria can be met by rescheduling 
clinic visit to occur within 3  days, these blood samples will be collected at the rescheduled clinic 
visit only.  
• Blood samples will be drawn after a minimum 10 -hour fast (water is allowed)  
Patients are encouraged to be in a seated position during the blood collection.  Clinical laboratory 
parameters and tests will include those listed in  Table 4.  Collection schedule and instructions are 
provided in the Clinical Laboratory Manual.  A description of the sample collection, storage, and 
shipping as well as monitoring and management of abnor mal laboratories are described in 
Section  11.1.6.

12.1. General Considerations  
The statistical analyses described in this section will be pe rformed as further outlined in a 
separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) .  The SAP will supersede the protocol in the event of 
any differences between the two documents in the plans for data analysis, and the protocol will 
be amended , if needed .  The SAP will be included as an appendix in the clinical study report for 
this protocol. 
12.2. Determination of Sample Size  
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is the percent change from baseline to Week 12 in 
LDL-C.   
The sample size of 150 randomized patients in the bempedoic acid 180 mg group and 
75 randomized patients in the placebo group is expected to provide more than 95% power to detect a difference of 15% in the percent change from baseline to Week  12 in calculated LDL -C 
between the bempedoic acid treatment group and the placebo group.  This calculation is based on a 2-sided t-test at the 5% level of significance and a common standard deviation of 15 %.  The 
sample size of 150 randomized patients in the bempedoic acid 180 mg group and 75 randomized patients in the placebo group gives a total study sample size of 225
.  
12.3. Analysis Po pulations  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS), used for all of the efficacy analyses, is defined as all randomized 
patients.   The FAS is also known as the intention- to-treat (ITT) set of patients.   Patients in the 
FAS will be included in their randomized treatment group, regardless of their actual treatment.  
The Safety Population (SP), used for all of the safety summaries, is defined as all randomized 
patients who received at least 1  dose of study medication.  Patients in the SP will be included in 
the treatment g roup that they actually received, regardless of their randomized treatment.  
12.4. Disposition, Demographics, and Baseline Characteristics  
Disposition, including reason for withdrawal from the IMP or study, will be summarized by 
treatment group.  Demographic inf ormation and patient characteristics including, but not limited 
to, gender, race, age, and baseline vital signs will also be summarized by treatment group. 
12.5. Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change from baseline to Week  12 in LDL- C.   
Baseline LDL- C is defined as the mean of the values from Week  -1 (Visit S3) and predose 
Day 1/Week  0 (Visit T1).   The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA), with treatment group as a factor and baseline LDL -C as a covariate.  
The ANCOVA will be performed using the FAS, with patients included in their randomized treatment group regardless of the treatment they actually received.   The details of the ANCOVA 
model and options to correct for unequal variances and group size will be described in the SAP. 
Bempedoic acid   Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol 1002-048  Amendment 2, 10 February 2017  
Confidential Page 70 of 144 Missing data for the primary endpoint will be imputed using a multiple imputation method that 
accounts for treatment adherence.  A pattern mixture model (PMM)  will be used  to specify 
different imputation strategies depending on whether the patient is still on study treatment.   
Imputed datasets will be analyzed using ANCOVA with treatment as a factor  and baseline 
LDL- C as a covariate.  Approximately 200 imputed datasets will be created, with results from 
the analysis of each imputed dataset combined using Rubin’s method.  T he least squares mean 
(LSM) and standard error (SE) will be provided for both treatment groups, along with the placebo -corrected LSM, i ts 95% confidence interval (CI), and associated p -value.   A 
confirmatory analysis using observed data only will also be performed for the primary endpoint. 
12.6. Secondary and Tertiary Effic acy Endpoints  
Secondary efficacy endpoints are also of interest for this study, in terms of controlling the overall 
Type  I error rate.  A gatekeeping or stepdown approach will be used to test the primary efficacy 
endpoint and then specific secondary efficacy endpoints sequentially in order to preserve the 
study- wise Type  I error rate.  The sequence for the stepdown procedure in this study is as 
follows: 
1. Test the primary efficacy endpoint: percent change from baseline to Week  12 in LDL- C  
2. Test the percent change from baseline to Week  12 in non- HDL -C 
3. Test the percent change from baseline to Week  12 in TC 
4. Test the percent change from baseline to Week  12 in apoB 
5. Test the percent change from baseline to Week  12 in hs- CRP  
In this hierarchical testing structure, each hypothesis is tested at a significance level of 0.05 2-sided.  Statistical significance at each step is required in order to test the next hypothesis.  If 
the primary efficacy endpoint meets the criteria for statistical significance, then the percent 
change from baseline to Week  12 in non- HDL -C will be tested; and so forth. 
For the remaining secondary efficacy endpoints (percent change from baseline to Week  12 in TG 
and HDL- C) and the tertiary efficacy endpoints, a significance level of 0.05 will be used; given 
the large numbe r of remaining endpoints, the p -values for those endpoints will be considered 
descriptive.  
In general, change or percent change in lipid parameters at a given time point will be analyzed 
using a similar ANCOVA model for the primary endpoint with treatment group as a factor and 
the relevant baseline as the covariate.    
Baseline for non- HDL -C, HDL -C, TC , and TG is  defined as the mean of the values f rom 
Week  -1 (Visit S3) and predose Day  1/Week  0 (Visit  T1).  Baseline for apoB and hs- CRP  is 
defined as the predose Day 1/Week  0 (Visit T1) value.    
Each ANCOVA will be performed using the FAS , with patients included in their randomized 
treatment group  regardless of the treatment they actually received .  Same imputation method 
described for the p rimary endpoint will be used for the secondary endpoints included in the 
stepdown testing procedure, while only observed data analysis will be used for other secondary 
and tertiary endpoints.  For each lipid parameter at each time point, the LSM and SE wil l be

Confidential Page 71 of 144 provided for both treatment groups, along with the placebo-corrected LSM, its 95% CI and 
associated p -value.  
The ANCOVA assumption of normality will be assessed.  If non-normality of the data is found at any time point for any parameter, either the d ata will be transformed so that it is normally 
distributed or a nonparametric test will be considered instead of the planned ANCOVA. 
12.7. Safety Endpoints  
The summarization of AEs will include only TEAEs.  TEAEs and SAEs will be summarized by SOC, severity, and relationship to study drug for each treatment group.  These AE summaries 
will include cumulative incidence (percent of patients experiencing the AE) and patient -year 
adjusted incidence rates.   If appropriate, absolute and relative risk differences will be calculated 
using both cumulative incidence and incidence rates.  Deaths, withdrawal from study treatment due to AEs, and withdrawal from the study due to AEs will each be summarized by treatment 
group. 
Clinical safety laboratories, including hematology, blood chemistry, HbA
1C, fasting glucose, and 
urinalysis; PE findings; vital signs; ECG readings; and weight will be summarized by the value 
and by change from baseline in the value (where appropriate ) at each postbaseline time  point. 
12.7.1. Hepatic Safety  
For liver-associated enzymes and TB , the number and percent of patients with abnormal values 
for ALT, AST, and TB will be summarized.  Hy’s law criteria (≥3  × ULN for either ALT or 
AST, with accompanying TB >2  × ULN  [≥2 × ULN conjugated /direct] \bilirubin will be used in 
patients with Gilbert’s Disease ]) in the absence of o ther known causes will also  be applied to the 
data; any potential Hy’s law cases will be listed separately.  
12.7.2. Musculoskeletal Safety  
AEs of muscle- related symptoms will be summarized by treatmen t group.  In addition, the 
number and percent of patients with abnormal CK values will be summarized.  
12.7.3. Diabetes and Hyperg lycemia  
Cases of worsening and new onset of diabetes will be recorded as AEs and will be summarized 
using the appropriate SOC.  These events will be summarized by severity and relationship to 
study drug for each treatment group. 
12.7.4. Renal Safety  
Baseline eGFR and values of CK will be summarized by treatment group and by baseline eGFR 
categories.   Shift tables of eGFR category from baseline o ver the study will be provided by 
treatment group.  Finally, muscle -related AEs will be summarized by treatment group and by 
baseline eGFR category.

16.1. Inspection of Records  
Applicable regulations require the Sponsor (or the Sponsor’s authorized representative) to 
inspect all documents and records to be maintained by the investigator , including but not limited 
to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospital) for the patients in this study .  These regulations 
also allow the Sponsor’s records to be inspected by authorized representatives of the regulatory 
agencies.  The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB or IEC  review, and 
regulatory inspections by providing dir ect access to source data/documents .  Direct access 
includes permission to examine, analyze, verify, and reproduce any records and reports that are important to the evaluation of a clinical study.  
16.2. Retention of Records 
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator /Institution agrees to retain and 
maintain all study records that support the data collected from each patient, as well as all study 
documents as specified in ICH/GCP, Section 8 Essential Documents for the Conduct of a 
Clinical Trial.  The investigator  agrees to contact the Sponsor before destroying or relocating any 
study documentation and is expected to take measures to prevent accidental or premature 
destruction of these documents.  
If the investigator retires, relocates, or for othe r reasons withdraws from the responsibility of 
keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a person who will accept responsibility.  
The Sponsor must be contacted in writing regarding the name and address of the new person 
responsible as well  as the disposition of document storage.  Under no circumstances shall the 
investigator  relocate or dispose of any study documents before having obtained written approval 
from the Sponsor. 
Essential records (including eCRFs, source documents, study drug disposition records, signed patient ICDs, AE reports, and other regulatory documents) as required by the applicable 
regulations, must be maintained for 2 years after a marketing application is approved for the drug 
for the indication for which it is being investigated; or, if no application is to be filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until 2 years after formal discontinuation of 
clinical development of the investigational product. 
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the investigator /Institution as to when these 
documents no longer need to be retained. 
16.3. Case Report Forms and Study Records  
Access to eCRFs will be provided to the clinical site .  As part of the responsibilities assumed by 
participating in the study, the investigator agrees to maintain adequate case histories for the 
patients treated as part of the research under this protocol .  The investigator agrees to maintain 
accurate source documentation and eCRFs as part of the case histories.  
Study records are comp rised of source documents, eCRFs, and all other administrative 
documents (eg, IRB or IEC  correspondence, clinical study materials and supplies shipment 
Bempedoic acid   Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol 1002-048  Amendment 2, 10 February 2017  
Confidential Page 79 of 144 manifests, monitoring logs, and correspondence) .  A study -specific binder will be provided with 
instructions for the maintenance of study records. 
Source documentation is defined as any handwritten or computer-generated document that 
contains medical information or test results that have been collected for or in support of the protocol specifications (eg, laboratory reports, clinic notes, study drug disposition log, pharmacy 
records, patient sign -in sheets, patient completed questionnaires, telephone logs, x-rays, and 
ECGs) .  All draft, preliminary, and pre/final iterations of a final report are also considered to be 
source documents (eg, faxed and hard copy of laboratory reports, faxed and hard copy of initial results, and final report).  
The investigator agrees to allow direct access to all essential clinical study documents for the 
purpose of monitoring and/or auditing by the Sponsor or its authorized representatives and 
inspection by the appropriate regulatory authorities. 
Data reflecting the patient’s participation with the study drug under investigation are to be 
reported to the Sponsor.  The data are t o be recorded on the eCRFs and/or other media provided 
or approved by the Sponsor.  
A completed eCRF must be submitted for each patient who receives study drug, regardless of 
duration.  All supportive documentation submitted with the eCRF, such as laboratory or hospital 
records, should be clearly identified with the study and patient number.  Any personal 
information, including patient name, should be removed or rendered illegible to preserve individual confidentiality.  The eCRF should not be used as a source document unless otherwise 
specified by the Sponsor .  
Neither the Sponsor nor a service provider contracted to analyze data and complete the study 
report is permitted to interpret a blank answer; therefore, all fields  should be completed.  All 
requested information must be entered on the eCRFs.  If an item is not available or is not 
applicable, this fact should be indicated as not available (N/A) or not done (N/D); do not leave a 
field blank.  
Each set of completed eCR Fs must be signed and dated by the investigator acknowledging 
review and that the data are accurate and complete.  The completed database is to be returned to 
the Sponsor as soon as practical after completion by the mechanism prescribed for the protocol. 
It is essential that all dates appearing on the Sponsor’s patient data collection forms for 
laboratory tests, cultures, etc , be the dates on which the specimens were obtained or the 
procedures performed.  The eCRFs will be electronically signed by the inves tigator  and dated as 
verification of the accuracy of the recorded data.  All data collection forms should be completed 
within a timely manner according to the CRF completion guidelines following the evaluation.

Statistical Methods:  
Sample Size  
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is the percent change from baseline to Week  12 in LDL- C.   
The sample size of 150 randomized patients in the bempedoic acid 180 mg group and 75 randomized 
patients in the placebo group is expected to provide more than 95% power to detect a difference of 15% in the percent change from baseline to Week  12 in calculated LDL-C between the bempedoic acid 
treatment group and the placebo group.  This calculation is based on a 2 -sided t -test at the 5% level of 
significance and a common standard deviation of 15  mg/dL.  The sample size of 150 randomized patients 
in the bempedoic acid 180 mg group and 75 randomized patients in the placebo group gives a total study 
sample size of  225.

Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change from baseline to Week  12 in LDL -C.  Baseline is 
defined as the mean of the values from Week  -1 (Visit S3 ) and predose Day 1/Week  0 (Visit  T1).  The 
primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with treatment group as a factor and baseline LDL -C as a covariate.  The ANCOVA will be performed using the FAS, 
with patients included in their randomized treatment group regardless of the treatment they actually 
received.  Two methods for data handling will be used:  the first is observed case data only, while the 
second will involve specification of the missing data mechanism using a pattern mixture model (PMM).  
The primary analysis will be that from the PMM, while the observed case analysis will be used as 
confirmatory.  The PMM will be used to specify different imputation strategies depending on whether or not the patient is still on study treatment.  Imputed datasets will be analyzed using ANCOVA with 
treatment as a factor  and baseline LDL -C as a covariate.  Approximately 100 imputed datasets will be 
created, with results from the analysis of each imputed dataset combined using Rubin’s method.  For each 
ANCOVA (observed case; imputation via PMM), the least squares mean (LSM) and standard error (SE) will be provided for both treatment groups, along with the placebo-corrected LSM, its 95% confidence interval (CI), and associated p -value.  
Secondary and Tertiary Efficacy Analysis  
For the remaining secondary efficacy endpoints (percent change from baseline to Week  12 in TG and 
HDL -C) and the tertiary efficacy endpoints, a significance level of 0.05 will be used; given the large 
number of remaining endpoints, the p- values for those endpoints will be considered descriptive.  
A significance level of 0.05 will be used ; given the large number of tertiary endpoints, the p- values for 
those endpoints will be considered descriptive. 
Change from baselin e to Week  12 in LDL- C; and percent change from baseline to Week  12 in HDL- C, 
non-HDL -C, TG, TC, apoB, and hs- CRP  will each be analyzed using ANCOVA with treatment group as 
a factor and the relevant baseline as the covariate.   Baseline for non- HDL -C, HDL -C, TC, and TG are 
defined as the mean of the values f rom Week  -1 (Visit S3)  and predose Day  1/Week  0 (Visit  T1), while 
baseline for apoB and hs- CRP is  defined as the predose Day  1/Week  0 (Visit T1) value.   Each ANCOVA 
will be performed using the FAS , with patients included in their randomized treatment group regardless of 
the treatment they actually received .  Only observed case data will be included (no imputation will be 
performed for missing data).  For each lipid parameter at each time point, the LSM and SE will be 
provided for both treatment groups, along with the placebo- corrected LSM, its 95% CI and associated 
p-value .  
For all continuous efficacy endpoints (percent change from baseline and absolute change from baseline in 
LDL -C, HDL -C, non- HDL -C, TC, TG, apoB, and hs- CRP; to Weeks 4, 8, and 12, as appropriate), the 
ANCOVA assumption of normality will be assessed.  If non-normality of the data is found at any time point for any parameter, either the data will be transformed so that it is normally distributed or a 
nonparametric test will be used instead of the planned ANCOVA.  
Safety Analyses  
No statistical analyses will be performed on any of the safety data in this study.  
The summarization of AEs will include only treatment- emergent AEs (TEAEs) .  TEAEs and SAEs will 
be summarized by system organ class (SOC), severity, and relationship to study drug for each treatment

An important differentiating feature of bempedoic acid is that it does not inhibit cholesterol 
synthesis in skeletal muscle.  In addition to preliminary data suggesting that only minor amounts 
of bempedoic acid enter skeletal muscle (<5% of systemic exposure), skeletal muscle does not 
express the enzyme required to activate bempedoic acid to ETC -1002-CoA and inhibit ACL.  
Therefore, bempedoic acid is not anticipated to mediate the adverse effects associated with inhibition of biological intermediates within the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in skeletal muscle.

ETC -1002- CoA is not present in skeletal muscle. In addition to preliminary data suggesting that 
only minor amounts of bempedoic acid enter skeletal muscle (<5% of systemic exposure), 
skeletal muscle does not express the enzyme required to  activate bempedoic acid to ETC -1002-
CoA and inhibit ACL.  Therefore, bempedoic acid is not anticipated to mediate the adverse 
effects associated with inhibition of biological intermediates within the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in skeletal muscle ; however, the safety of bempedoic acid and its metabolites 
regarding human skeletal muscle is not yet established .

After randomization, if the patient has not taken all doses of study drug  as instructed, the patient 
will be queried for a reason, findings will be documented, and the patient will be counseled on 
the importance of carefully following all dosing instructions.  Factors contributing to poor 
adherence will be determined and, if possible, remedied.  Following randomization, patients 
demonstrating poor adherence will continue to be counseled on the importance of carefully 
following all dosing instructions, but will not be removed from the study.  Prior to 
randomization, during the ezetimibe and single blind run-in period, patients with ≤80% 
adherence and/or who experienced a study drug-related AE will not go on to randomization.

The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change from baseline to Week  12 in LDL-C.  
Baseline is defined as the mean of the values from Week  -1 (Visit S3) and predose 
Day 1/Week  0 (Visit T1).  The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA), with treatment group as a factor and baseline LDL -C as a covariate.  
The ANCOVA will be perfor med using the FAS, with patients included in their randomized 
treatment group regardless of the treatment they actually received.   
Two methods for data handling will be used:  the first is observed case data only, while the 
second will involve specificati on of the missing data mechanism using a pattern mixture model 
(PMM).  The primary analysis will be that from the PMM, while the observed case analysis will be used as confirmatory.  The PMM will be used to specify different imputation strategies depending on whether the patient is still on study treatment.  Imputed datasets will be analyzed 
using ANCOVA with treatment as a factor and baseline LDL -C as a covariate.  Approximately 
100 imputed datasets will be created, with results from the analysis of each imputed dataset 
combined using Rubin’s method.  For each ANCOVA (observed case; imputation via PMM), the 
least squares mean (LSM) and standard error (SE) will be provided for both treatment groups, 
along with the placebo-corrected LSM, its 95% confidence interval (CI), and associated p- value.

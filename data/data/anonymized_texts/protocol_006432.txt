SUMMARY OF CHANGES FR OM PREVIOUS VERSION

Amendment Number 
3 Amendment Date  
17 Sep 2020 Global/Region/Count ry/Site Specific 
Global  
Protocol Amendment Summary and Rationale: 
The main purpose of SHP647-303 Amendment 3 is to provide an update regarding the early closure of this study 
due to sponsor decision and to provide corresponding updates to the end of treatment procedures, including 
unblinding, as well as to reflect the impact of the ear ly discontinuation of the study on the study objectives, 
endpoints, further assessments, and associated analyses of the data. As ontamalimab will not be further developed, 
most of the non-key secondary endpoints and all of the ex ploratory endpoints will not be analyzed, and data for the 
associated assessments will not be collected going forward.  Due to early termination of the ontamalimab program, 
the sponsor is providing an option for subjects who are re sponding to active treatment in this maintenance study or 
who are on placebo and had resp onded to active treatment in an induction study to continue to receive ontamalimab 
in the long-term safety extension study SHP647-304. Subj ects already enrolled in this maintenance study and who 
are responding to active treatment, or who are on placebo and had responded to active treatment in an induction 
study, will be offered the opportunity to continue to receive ontamalimab in  Study SHP647-304 provided they meet 
the eligibility criteria under SHP647-304 Amendment 4, which is being implemented concurrently. Subjects who 
received placebo in both the inductio n and maintenance studies will not be eligible to roll over into 
Study SHP647-304. 
As the eligibility criteria for Study SHP647-304 depend on the blinded treatment assignment in this study, for a 
given subject, there is potential for the treatment assignment  in this study to be unblinded at the early termination 
visit when assessing whether the subject may roll over into  the SHP647-304 study or sh ould proceed to the safety 
follow-up period. In addition, due to the early discontin uation of the SHP647 program, the SHP647-304 study is 
planned to be unblinded prior to the database lock for this study, which would unblind the treatment assignment in 
this study for a significant portion of subjects. As such, this study will be considered unblinded when the 
SHP647-304 study is unblinded, and the date of study unblinding will be recorded. 
All subjects who discontinue investigational product and are not entering Study SHP647-304 should complete the 
protocol-specified safety follow-period in this study. Note  that, with this amendment, the safety follow-up period 
has been reduced from 16 weeks to 12 weeks, based on emergent data on the half-life of ontamalimab (16 days). 
This amendment also provides clarification around home admi nistration of investigational product, a provision that 
has been implemented in response to the World Health  Organization (WHO) offici ally declaring the novel 
Coronavirus a pandemic on 11 March 2020. This amendment incorporates changes to provide flexibility in timing of 
site visits, to identify home healthcare solutions as permitte d by local regulations, and to maintain subject safety and 
confidentiality and study integrity in the context of h ealthcare delivery challenges presented by the COVID-19 
pandemic. 
The significant changes in SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3 relative to the previous edition, SHP647-303 
Protocol Amendment 2, are captured below.

STUDY SYNOPSIS 
Protocol number: SHP647-303  Drug:  Ontamalimab (SHP647)  
Title of the study: A Phase 3 Randomized, Double -blind, Placebo-controlled, Para llel-group Efficacy and Safety 
Study of SHP647 as Maintenance Therapy in Subj ects With Moderate to Severe Ulcerative Colitis 
(FIGARO UC 303)  
Number of subjects (total a nd for each treatment arm): 
Approximately 696 subjects were planned for enrollment into the study: approximately 592 subjects from active induction treatments and approximately 104 subjects from placebo induction groups. A total of 366 subjects have 
been enrolled.  
Investigator(s): Multicenter study. 
Site(s) and Region(s): 
This study will be conducted in approximately  164 sites in approximately 31 countries. 
Study period (planned): 
2018 to 2021 Clinical phase: 3 
Objectives: 
Primary: To evaluate the efficacy of ontamalimab as maintenance treatment of remission, based on composite score 
of patient-reported symptoms and centrally read endoscopy,  in subjects with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis 
(UC).  
Key Secondary:  
• To evaluate the efficacy of ontamalimab on endoscop ic remission, based on centrally read endoscopy 
• To evaluate the efficacy of ontamalimab on clinical re mission, based on composite score of patient-reported 
symptoms 
• To evaluate the efficacy of ontamalimab on maintenance of remission among subjects in remission at baseline 
of the SHP647-303 study, based on composite score of patient-reported symptoms and centrally read 
endoscopy 
• To evaluate the efficacy of ontamalimab on clinical re sponse, based on composite score of patient-reported 
symptoms and centrally read endoscopy 
• To evaluate the efficacy of ontamalimab on mucosal h ealing, based on a centra lly read endoscopic and 
histological assessment using th e Geboes Score grading system 
• To evaluate the efficacy of ontamalimab on glucocorticoid-free clinical remission 
• To evaluate the efficacy of ontamalimab on glucocorticoid-free remission. 
Other Secondary:  
• To evaluate the effect of ontamalimab maintenance treatment on other clinical and endoscopic outcomes 
(Mayo-based remission, clinical remission over time, and sustained endoscopic remission) 
Rationale: This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy an d safety of ontamalimab as maintenance therapy in 
subjects with moderate to severe UC who achieved clinical response in induction study SHP647-301 or 
SHP647-302.

SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
Investigational product, dose, and mode of administration: 
The test product is ontamalimab, which will be provided as a sterile aqueous buffered solution for subcutaneous 
(SC) administration in a glass prefilled syringe (PFS) with a fixed needle. Each PFS contains 1 mL of ontamalimab 
solution for injection at an appropriate concentration to provide the intended dose of drug (25 mg or 75 mg). 
Additional information is provided in the current ontamalimab Investigator’s Brochure. 
The reference product is placebo, which will be provided in  a PFS with a fixed needle containing 1 mL of placebo 
solution for SC administration. The placeb o solution will contain the same sterile  aqueous buffered solution as the 
test product but will not contain ontamalimab.  
Methodology:  
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in subjects with moderate to 
severe UC who completed their participation in an induction study (either SHP647-301 or SHP647-302) and 
achieved a clinical response. Clinical response is defined as: 
1) A decrease from the induction study (SHP647-301 or SHP647-302) baseline in the composite score of 
patient-reported symptoms using daily electronic diary (e-diary) and centrally read endoscopy of at least 
2 points and at least 30%, with an accompanying decrease in the subscore for rectal bleeding (RB) ≥1 point 
or a subscore for RB ≤ 1 
OR 
2) A decrease from the induction study (SHP647-301 or SHP647-302) baseline in total Mayo score of at least 3 points and at least 30%, with an accompanying decrease in the RB subscore of at least 1 point or an absolute RB subscore of 0 or 1. 
This study consists of a 52-week, double-blind treatment pe riod, followed by a 12-week safety follow-up period for 
subjects who either discontinue treatment early or who complete the treatment period and do not enter the long-term safety extension (LTS) study (SHP647-304). 
The eligibility of a subject for the study will be assessed based on the study data collected at the Week 12 visit of the 
induction studies (SHP647-301 or SHP647-302), which will be  considered as the baseline visit for this maintenance 
study. 
Eligible subjects who received active treatment in 1 of the induction studies and achieved a clinical response will be 
randomly assigned as follows: subject s who received 25 mg ontamalimab in  1 of the induction studies will be 
randomized (1:1) to receive e ither 25 mg ontamalim ab or placebo, and subjects who received 75 mg ontamalimab in 
1 of the induction studies will be randomized (1:1) to recei ve either 75 mg ont amalimab or placebo. 
Eligible subjects who received placebo in 1 of the induction studies and ac hieved a clinical response will be 
randomly assigned in a 2:2:1 ratio to  receive 1 of 3 treatments (25 mg ontamalimab, 75 mg  ontamalimab, or 
placebo, respectively) during this maintenance study. Subjects will be stratified according to glucocorticoid use at SHP647-303 baseline, the subject’s status of prior 
anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment (naïve or expe rienced), and the degree of clinical response in the 
induction study (whether remission is achieved or not). 
Subjects enrolled in this study (SHP 647-303) will receive  double-blind maintenance tr eatment in the form of 
SC injections, using a PFS, once every 4 weeks (Q4W) for 52 weeks. Subjects will undergo efficacy,  
 and safety assessments. 
Patient-reported UC signs and symptom data (including SF, RB severity and frequency, diarrhea frequency, urgency 
frequency, and abdominal pain worst severity) will be collected using an e-diar y daily. The Mayo score is a measure 
of UC disease activity consisting of the following 4 subscores: SF, RB, findings of endoscopy, and physician global 
assessment (PGA). The partial Mayo sc ore consists of the Mayo score without the endoscopic subscores. The 
composite score is a recommended measure consisting of the Mayo score without the PGA subscore, and will be 
used for the primary efficacy endpoint. The Mayo scores and composite sc ore will be based on subject daily e-diary 
entries.

SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
Under Amendment 3, subjects who complete the double-blind treatment period, or subjects who are withdrawn from 
the study prior to completing the double-blind treatment period due to early closure of the study by the sponsor, may 
be eligible to enter the LTS study (SHP647-304) provi ded they meet the eligibility criteria under SHP647-304 
Amendment 4. Offering treatment in the LTS study after exiting this maintenance study allows subjects who 
benefited from active treatment, in this study or the induc tion study, to potentially benefit from continued treatment 
at the same dose of ontamalimab or at  different dose of ontamalimab if, during the course of the SHP647-304 study, 
one of those doses (25 mg or 75 mg) is determined to be more efficaciou s based on emergent data from the 
induction studies. However, if there is no evidence of effica cy of either of th e doses in comparison to placebo in the 
UC/CD clinical study, the entire program may be stopped, including the LTS study. Subjects who are not entering study SHP647-304 will enter a 12-week safety follow-up period. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria: 
Inclusion Criteria: 
Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment into the study. 
1. Subjects and/or their parent or legally authorized re presentative must have an understanding, ability, and 
willingness to fully comply with st udy procedures and restrictions. 
2. Subjects must be able to voluntarily provide written, si gned, and dated (personally or via a legally authorized 
representative) informed consent and/or  assent to participate in the study. 
3. Subjects must have completed the 12-week induction treatment period from study SHP647-301 or SHP647-302. 
4. Subjects must have achieved clinical response in induction study SHP647-301 or SHP647-302. Clinical 
response is defined as: 
1) A decrease from the induction study (SHP647-301 or SHP647-302) baseline in the composite score of 
patient-reported symptoms using daily e-diary and centrally read endoscopy of at least 2 points and at least 
30%, with an accompanying decr ease in the subscore for RB ≥1 point or a subscore for RB ≤1 
OR 
2) A decrease from the induction study (SHP647-301 or SHP647-302) baseline in total Mayo score of at least 
3 points and at least 30%, with an accompanying decrease in the RB subscore of at least 1 point or an absolute RB subscore of 0 or 1. 
For eligibility assessment, clinical response will be determined based on the centrally read endoscopy performed during screening and at Week 12 of induction study SHP647-301 or SHP647-302. 
5. Subjects receiving any treatment(s ) for UC described in Sec tion 5.2.1 are eligible provided they have been, and 
are anticipated to be, on a stable dose  for the designated period of time. 
Exclusion Criteria: 
Subjects are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria are met: 
1. Subjects who had major protocol deviation(s) (as determined by the sponsor) in induction study SHP647-301 or 
SHP647-302. 
2. Subjects who permanently discontinued investigational product because of an adverse event (AE), regardless of relatedness to investigational product, in induction study SHP647-301 or SHP647-302. 
3. Subjects who are likely to require surgery for UC during the study period. 
4. Subjects are females who became pregnant during induction study SHP647-301 or SHP647-302, females who are planning to become pregnant during the study period, or males or females of childbearing potential not 
agreeing to continue appropriate c ontraception methods (ie, highly effect ive methods for female and medically 
appropriate methods for male study subjects) through the conclusion of study participation. 
5. Subjects who do not agree to postpone donation of any organ or tissue, including male subjects who are planning to bank or donate sperm, and female subjects who are planning to harvest or donate eggs, for the 
duration of the study and through 16 weeks after last dose of investigational product.

SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
6. Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator or the sponsor, will be uncooperative or unable to comply with 
study procedures. 
7. Subjects who have a newly diagnosed malignancy or recurrence of malignancy (other than resected cutaneous 
basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or carcinoma in situ of the uterine cerv ix that has been treated 
with no evidence of recurrence).

(eg, renal, hepatic, hematologic, gastrointestinal (e xcept disease under study), endocrine, cardiovascular, 
pulmonary, immunologic [eg, Felty’s syndrome], or local  active infection/infectious illness) that, in the 
investigator’s judgment, will substantially increase the risk to the subject if he or she participates in the study. 
9. Subjects with any other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory or 
electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or 
investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the 
judgment of the investigator, would make the su bject inappropriate for entry into this study. 
10. Subjects with known exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis  (TB) since testing at screening in induction study 
SHP647-301 or SH P647-302 and who are with out a generally accepted course of treatment. 
11. Subjects who are investigational site staff members or re latives of those site staff members or subjects who are 
sponsor employees directly involve d in the conduct of the study. 
12. Subjects who are participating in or plan to participate in other investigational studies (other than induction 
study SHP647-301 or SHP647-302) during Study SHP647-303. 
Maximum duration of subject  involvement in the study: 
• Maximum duration of participation: Approximately 64 weeks 
• Planned duration of treatment period: 52 weeks 
• Planned duration of safety follow-up: 12 weeks 
Endpoints and statistical analysis: 
Analysis Sets: 
The safety set will consist of all subjects who have recei ved at least 1 dose of inve stigational product in the 
SHP647-303 study, regardless of treatment received during the induction studies (SHP647-301 and SHP647-302). 
The ontamalimab responder full analysis set (FAS) will c onsist of all subjects in the randomized set who have 
received at least 1 dose of investiga tional product in the SHP647-303 study and who were previously treated with 
ontamalimab in the induction studies. The placebo responder FAS will co nsist of all subjects in the randomized set who have received at least 1 dose of 
investigational product in the SHP647 -303 study and who were previously treated with placebo in the induction 
studies. 
 
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Unless otherwise specified, all efficacy analyses will be based on the ontamalimab responder FAS and subjects will 
be analyzed according to their randomized treatment , regardless of the treatment they actually received. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is remission at the Week 52  visit. Remission is defined as a composite score of 
patient-reported symptoms using daily e-diary and centrally read endoscopy as follows: 
• stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1 with at least a 1-point change from induction (SHP647-301 or 
SHP647-302) baseline 
AND 

Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 24 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
• rectal bleeding subscore of 0 
AND 
• endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified, excludes friability). 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be compared for each active treatment group (25 mg or 75 mg ontamalimab) to 
the corresponding placebo group (25 mg in induction placebo group or 75 mg  in induction placebo group; placebo 
groups are not pooled) using a Cochran-Mantel Haenszel (CMH) chi-square test stratified by status of glucocorticoid 
use at SHP647-303 baseline, prior anti-TNF treatment, and the degree of clinical response in the induction studies 
(whether remission is achieved or not). Subjects with missing  remission data at Week 52 will be considered failures 
and counted as nonresponders. The endoscopy sc ore will be based on centrally read results. 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be tested by the follo wing hypothesis: 
H0: δ = 0 
H1: δ ≠ 0 
Where δ is the common treatment difference across strata,  j=1 to m. The common treatment difference is a weighted 
average of the stratum-speci fic treatment differences. 
The estimate of the common treatme nt difference along with the corresponding stratified Newcombe 95% 
confidence interval (CI) using the met hod of Yan and Su (2010) and CMH p- value will be presented for each active 
treatment group to placebo comparison. 
Adjustments for multiplicity 
The global family-wise Type-I error rate (FWER) for the statistical tests of the primary and key secondary endpoints 
will be strongly controlled at .05 (2-sided). To control the FWER, graphical methods discussed in Bretz et al. (2009) 
will be utilized to propagate α from primary to key secondary endpoints and between the 2 ontamalimab treatment 
group and placebo comparisons. Alpha is initially split equa lly at the .025 level (2-sided) for each of the pairwise 
treatment comparisons for the primary endpoint (P) and alpha is propagated in a hierarchical manner to each of the 7 key secondary endpoints (K1-K7) within a pairwise treatment comparison. 
Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: 
• Endoscopic remission, as defined by centrally read endoscopic subscore 0 or 1 (modified, excludes 
friability), at the Week 52 visit. 
• Clinical remission as defined by SF subscore of 0 or 1 with at least a 1-point change from induction study (SHP647-301 or SHP647-302) baseline in SF subscore, and RB subscore of 0, at the Week 52 visit. 
• Sustained remission, ie, in remission at the SHP647-303 Week 52 visit, among subjects who were in remission at the time of baseline in study SHP647-303. Remission is defined as a composite score of patient-reported symptoms using daily e-diary and centrally read endoscopy, with SF subscore of 0 or 1 
with at least a 1-point change from induction study (SHP647-301 or SHP647-302) baseline, and RB 
subscore of 0, and endoscopic subscore of  0 or 1 (modified, excludes friability). 
• Clinical response based on composite score at the W eek 52 visit. Clinical response (composite) is defined 
as a decrease from induction study (SHP647-301 or SHP647-302) baseline in the composite score of 
subject-reported symptoms using daily e-diary and centrally read endoscopy of at least 2 points and at least 30%, with an accompanying decr ease in the subscore for RB ≥1 point or a subscore for RB ≤1. 
• Mucosal healing, based on endoscopic and histologic assessment, at the Week 52 visit. Mucosal healing is defined by centrally read endoscopic subscore 0 or 1 (modified, excludes friability) and centrally read 
Geboes score of ≤2. 
• Glucocorticoid-free clinical remission at Week 52, among subjects using glucocorticoids at induction study baseline. Glucocorticoid-free clinical remission is defined as clinical remission in addition to not requiring 
any treatment with glucocorticoids for at least 4 weeks prior to the Week 52 visit. Clinical remission is 
defined as SF subscore of 0 or 1 with at least a 1-
point chan ge from induction stud y (SHP647-301 or 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 25

SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
SHP647-302) baseline in SF su bscore, and RB subscore of 0, at the Week 52 visit. 
• Glucocorticoid-free remission at Week 52, among subjects using glucocorticoids at induction study 
baseline. Glucocorticoid-free remission is defined as remission in addition to not requiring any treatment 
with glucocorticoids for at least 4 weeks prior to the Week 52 visit. Remission is defined as a composite score of subject-reported symptoms using daily e-diary and endoscopy, with SF subscore of 0 or 1 with at 
least a 1-point change from induction study (SHP647-301 or SHP647-302) baseline, and RB subscore of 0, 
and endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified, excludes friability). 
Similar to the primary endpoints, the key secondary ef ficacy endpoints will all be tested by the following 
hypothesis: 
H
0: δ = 0 
H1: δ ≠ 0 
The key secondary endpoints will be analyzed using the same approach as described for the primary endpoint. 
Subjects with missing key secondary endpoint data at the Week 52 visit will be considered failures and counted as 
nonresponders. 
Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: 
• Remission defined as a total Mayo score of ≤2 with no individual subscore (SF, RB, endoscopy [modified, 
excludes friability], and PGA)  exceeding 1, at Week 52. 
• Clinical remission over time with both RB and SF subscores of 0. 
• Sustained endoscopic remission ie, in endoscopic remission at the SHP647-303 Week 52 visit among 
subjects who were in remission at the time of baseline in Study SHP647-303, as defined by a centrally read 
endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified, excludes friability). 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints will be summarized by descriptive statistic s and presented by treatment group 
for the ontamalimab responder FAS. The other secondary en dpoints will be analyzed using the same approach as 
described for the primary endpoint. Subjects with missing ot her secondary endpoint data at a visit will be considered 
failures and counted as nonresponders at that visit. The ot her secondary endpoints will be summarized separately for 
the placebo responder FAS by treatment group without inferential methods, as described for the primary endpoint. 
Safety Analyses: 
All safety analyses will be performed using the safety set. Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they 
actually received. Adverse events will be coded usin g the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. 
Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs with star t dates at the time of or following the first exposure 
to investigational product in the SHP647-303 study. The number of events, incidence, and percentage of TEAEs will be calculated overall, by system orga n class, by preferred term, and by treatment group. Treatment-emergent AEs 
will be further summarized by severity and relationship to investigational product. Adverse events leading to 
withdrawal, serious AEs, and deaths will be similarly summarized or listed. A dverse events of special interest will 
be summarized by treatment group. 
Clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG findings w ill be summarized by treatment group and visit. Potentially 
clinically important findings will also be summarized or listed. 
Antidrug antibody data will be summarized by treatment group and visit.

the subject’s last study visit prior to th e implementation of SHP647-304 Amendment 4. 
a The Week 12 assessment from the induction study (SHP647-301 or SHP 647-302) will be used as the ba seline (Day 1/Week 0) assessme nts for Study SHP647-303. 
b No follow-up is required if subject is entering the LTS  study (SHP647-304) at the Week 52/ET visit (Visit 14).

Week 52/ET and 12-week safety follow-up visits are preferred to be  on-site visits; however, due to the COVID-19 public health e mergency (or other similar pandemic), these 
may also be done at a subject’s home provided a qualified site staff member performs these eval uations following DTP guidance. 
d Part 1 of Visit 14 must be completed within 10 days (preferably,  within 5 to 7 days) before Part 2; this will allow sufficient time for data from the centrally read endoscopy to 
be available at Part 2 of the visit. For subjects who meet the criteria for treatment failure (as defined in Section  4.5.1.1 ) or are discontinuing prior to completing the 52-week 
treatment period due to early study closure and will be enteri ng the LTS study (SHP647-304), Part 2 of Visit 14 should be sched uled at least 2 weeks after the last dose of 
investigational product, to allow a sufficient time interval prior to the first dose in the LTS study.

1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
1.1 Indication and Current Treatment Options 
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing disease marked by ulcera tion and inflammation of 
the colonic mucosa and submucosa. Initially it usually involves the rectum but may extend 
proximally to involve a por tion of, or the entirety of, the colo n. In the early stages, hemorrhagic 
and erythematous tissue is obser ved, progressing to mucosal ulcera tion with purulent exudates in 
severe cases. The ulceration patter n is continuous and may extend th e entire length of the colon. 
Perforation of the bowel wall causing ileus and peri tonitis can occur with tr ansmural extension of 
the ulceration. Bloody diarrhea with  or without mucus and lower a bdominal pain with periods of 
remission and exacerbation are the most common symptoms. 
The incidence of UC is estimated to be up to  24.3 cases per 100,000 persons per year in Europe 
and up to 19.2 cases per 100,000 persons per year in North America. No clear difference in 
incidence has been observed between men and wo men. Although UC can occur at any age, peak 
incidence has been observed in the se cond to fourth decades of life ( Molodecky et al., 2012 ). 
Ulcerative colitis is a lifelong condition with  a serious effect on the quality of life. 
Current treatment primarily consists of symptoma tic management with dietary modifications and 
opiate antidiarrheal drugs (loperamide), as we ll as disease modifying agents such as 
5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), systemic glucocorticoids, imm unosuppressive agents 
(azathioprine [AZA]/6- mercaptopurine [6-MP], cyclosporin e), and biologic therapy with 
anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or anti-integrin agents. Despite recent advances, there is still an 
unmet need for an effe ctive pharmacological treatment that will induce and maintain remission. 
1.2 Product Background and Clinical Information 
The selectivity of lymphocyte homing to specia lized lymphoid tissue and mucosal sites of the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract is influenced by the endothelial expression of mucosal addressin cell 
adhesion molecule (MAdCAM). MA dCAM is a member of the im munoglobulin super family of 
cell adhesion molecules and is mostly expressed on the cell surface of high endothelial venules 
of organized intestinal lymphoid tissue such as Peyer’s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes 
(Shyjan et al., 1996; Briskin et al., 1997 ; Liaskou et al., 2011 ). MAdCAM plays a role in gut 
immune surveillance, and also appears to faci litate excessive lymphocyte infiltration under 
conditions of chronic GI inflammation. The α4β7 integrin is the recognized ligand for MAdCAM, 
and expression of this ligand on populations of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as on subsets of 
B cells, distinguishes them as  unique gut homing lymphocytes. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 31 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
Ontamalimab (previously known as PF- 00547659 and SHP647) is a fully human 
immunoglobulin G 2 kappa (IgG 2κ) monoclonal antibody that bi nds to human MAdCAM to 
reduce lymphocyte homing to the gut and GI inflammation. Ontamali mab binds MAdCAM-1 
with high affinity and selectivit y that prevents the binding of α4β7+ lymphocytes to 
MAdCAM-expressing sites in the high e ndothelial venules of the GI tract. 
1.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment 
Ontamalimab has been evaluated in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies in subjects with UC and 
Crohn’s disease (CD). In UC study A7281009, inducti on with ontamalimab at doses of 7.5 mg, 
22.5 mg, or 75 mg once every 4 weeks (Q4W) resu lted in statistically significantly higher 
proportions of subjects in re mission at Week 12 based on total Mayo score (both locally and 
centrally read) when compared with place bo treatment. In CD study A7281006, induction with 
ontamalimab did not meet the primary endpoint; no statisticall y significant differences were 
observed between the active treatment arms and the placebo arm in CD Activity Index-70 
response rate at Week 8 or Week 12. Post hoc an alyses suggested evidence of drug effect in 
subjects with more inflammation at baseline, as indi cated by higher serum concentrations of 
C-reactive protein (CRP) or S imple Endoscopic Score for CD. 
In UC induction study A7281009, decr eases in fecal calp rotectin were obser ved in all groups, 
including placebo; however, there were no statistical ly significant differen ces in the decrease in 
fecal calprotectin between any dose level of ontamalimab and placebo. Decreases in 
high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) were also observed in all 4 treatment groups; however, other than 
the 75 mg dose group at Week 12, no statistically significant differences were observed in active 
treatment versus placebo. In the induction study A7281006 in subjects with CD, compared to 
placebo, nominally statistically si gnificant decreases in fecal calpr otectin were observed in the 
75 mg group at Week 8 and in the 22.5 mg and 75 mg groups at Week 12. Generally, decreases 
from baseline in hsCRP were observed in all 4 treatment groups over the 12-week induction 
period. Compared to placebo, nominally statistically significant decreases in hsCRP were observed in all 3 active treatment groups (22.5 mg, 75 mg, and 225 mg) at Week 12. There was no evidence of a dose response for either of these parameters. A no minally statistically 
significant increase was observed in circulating β
7+ central memory T lymphocytes at Weeks 8 
and 12, consistent with the pr edicted mechanism of action.

SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
The most common serious adverse events (SAE s) across all studies were CD and UC. In 
Study A7281006, the randomized, placebo-controlled induction study in CD, treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) were most commonly reported within th e GI disorders system organ 
class (SOC) followed by the infections and infe stations SOC. The most common all-causality 
TEAEs were CD (worsening and progression of underlying disease) , followed by pyrexia, 
headache, and arthralgia, all of which had si milar incidences in th e placebo treatment group 
compared with the activ e treatment groups. In Study A7281009, the randomized, 
placebo-controlled induction study in UC, TE AEs were most commonly reported within the 
GI disorders SOC followed by the infections and infestations SOC. The most common 
all-causality TEAE was headache, followed by a bdominal pain, nasopharyngitis, UC (worsening 
and progression of underlying disease), and nausea, all with  similar inci dence between 
placebo- and drug-treated subjects. 
The long-term, open-label safety studie s (Studies A7281007 and A7281010) were not 
placebo-controlled, but permitted exposure to the investigational product at doses of 75 mg or 
225 mg Q4W for 18 and 36 months, respec tively. In Study A7281007, the most common 
all-causality TEAE was CD (w orsening or progression), arth ralgia, nasopharyngitis, and 
abdominal pain. In Study A7281010, the mo st common all-causality TEAEs were 
UC (worsening or progression), arthralgia, and nasopharyngitis. 
Ontamalimab appears to be generally well tolerate d, with the majority of  TEAEs distributed at 
similar frequencies among treatment arms with only peripheral edema, gastroenteritis, and 
arthralgia more frequently repor ted in ontamalimab- than placebo-treated subjects in the pooled 
induction studies. In the placebo-controlled induction studies, nasopharyngitis was not reported 
more frequently in ontamalimab- than placebo- treated subjects, but occurred at relatively high 
frequency during long-term safety studies. Ontamalimab does not a ppear to be associated with 
impaired central nervous system (CNS) immune surveillance. No case of progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML) or myocarditis has b een reported. Ontamalimab, in doses of 7.5 mg, 
22.5 mg, and 75 mg, appears to increas e the rate of remiss ion in subjects with UC, and may have 
an effect in patients with CD who have greater evidence of in flammation based on biomarker or 
endoscopic data.

2. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE 
2.1 Rationale for the Study 
Ontamalimab, a fully human IgG 2κ antihuman MAdCAM monoclonal antibody, was under 
development for the treatment of UC. Ontamalimab prevents the binding of α4β7+ lymphocytes to 
MAdCAM-expressing sites with high affinity and selectivity. Principal sites of MAdCAM 
expression on normal tissue include intestine, pancreas, stomach, esophagus, spleen, and to a 
lesser extent lung, liver, and bladder but not the CNS (Steffen et al., 1996). 
Although selective targeting of  the MAdCAM receptors is a novel approach, the basic 
interference of lymphocy te homing by preventing the binding of these α4β7+ lymphocytes to the 
MAdCAM receptor and the resultant e fficacy in UC is well established ( Feagan et al., 2013 ). 
Ontamalimab is differentiated from other molecules us ed for the treatment of UC in that it blocks 
the interaction of α4β7+ lymphocytes to the MAdCAM receptor by selectively binding to 
MAdCAM in the gut (and related tissues) wherea s other molecules only target the integrins on 
the infiltrating lymphocytes. A dditionally, ontamalimab does not  bind to the vascular cell 
adhesion molecule; therefore, ont amalimab is not expected to be an effective treatment for 
multiple sclerosis, or affect lymphoc yte homing or surveillance in the CNS. 
This study is designed to evalua te the efficacy of ontamalima b as maintenance therapy in 
subjects with moderate to severe UC who achieved clinical response in induction study 
SHP647-301 or SHP647-302. 
Ontamalimab has been investigated  in subjects with moderate to severe UC in 3 completed 
studies: 2 dose-finding studies  (A7281001 and A7281009) and an open-label long-term safety 
extension (LTS) study (A7281010), which was ongoing at the time of the original protocol and 
has since completed. Phas e 1 study A7281001 evaluated both single (0.03–10.0 mg/kg 
intravenous [IV]; 3.0 mg/kg s ubcutaneous [SC]) and multip le doses (0.1–3.0 mg/kg IV; 
0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg SC) of ontamalimab in subjects w ith UC. Safety evaluation revealed a safety 
profile for ontamalimab similar to that of placebo, with no pattern of adverse events (AEs) 
suggestive of increased risk of opportunistic in fections or CNS effects, and no evidence of 
adverse effects on laboratory para meters, electrocardiograms (ECGs) , vital signs, or neurological 
function. Events leading to withdrawal were due to exacerbations of the underlying UC.

Study A7281009 was a Phase 2b proof-of-concept (randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel, dose-ranging) study de signed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and 
PK of ontamalimab in subjects with moderate to severe UC . Treatment was assigned in 
a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to dose levels of 7.5, 22.5, 75, or 225 mg ontamalimab or placebo administered SC Q4W at Weeks 0, 4, and 8. The primary endpoint  of the study was the proportion of subjects 
in clinical remission at Week 12, with remis sion defined as a total Mayo score of ≤2 with no 
individual subscore >1 (see Appendix 2 for details of the Mayo scor e). More subjects were in 
clinical remission at Week 12 in  ontamalimab-treated groups than in the placebo group, with 
statistical significance achieved for the 7.5, 22.5, and 75 mg doses ( Vermeire et al., 2017 ). Based 
upon the total Mayo score with a ce ntrally read endoscopic severi ty component, th e increase in 
clinical remission rates over  placebo at Week 12 for the 7.5, 22.5, and 75 mg doses were 
8.0% (p=.043), 12.8% (p=.010), and 11.8% (p=.012) , respectively. When the clinical remission 
rate at Week 12 was analyzed by stratum of prev ious anti-TNF exposure (experienced or naïve), 
a similar trend was observed acro ss dose levels in both the anti- TNF experienced and anti-TNF 
naïve subjects. There was no evidence of an adve rse safety signal, and there was no increase in 
the frequency of infections in MAdCAM-bearing tissues as evidenced by similar rates of 
nasopharyngitis among treatment arms. 
Based on the efficacy and safety data in Study A7281009 and the system ic population PK and 
pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling and simulation, clinical re mission, clinical response and 
mucosal healing rates were highe r in subjects with UC receiving doses of 22.5 and 75 mg Q4W 
than in those receiving doses of 7.5 mg and 225 mg Q4W. The induction responses were not 
demonstrated either at Week 4 or Week 8 but were observed at Week  12 regardless of dose level. 
No difference in the clinical responses betw een a 22.5 mg dose and a 25 mg dose is expected 
based on the current understanding of the mode  of action of ontamalimab and clinical 
observations to date. To better understand the exposure (dose)-response relationship in this 
population and understand individual patient exposu re needs, the 25 mg and 75 mg doses (Q4W) 
will be tested in the Phase 3 program. Therefore, SC doses of 25 mg or 75 mg of ontamalimab or 
placebo on Day 1 (Week 0), Week 4, and Week 8 are recommended for the Phase 3 induction 
studies SHP647-301 and SHP647-302. The Phase 1 study A7281001, which investigated the 
safety, tolerance, PK, and PD properties of ontamalimab, supports further clinical development of ontamalimab using SC administration.

3. STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 Study Design and Flow Chart 
This is a Phase 3, randomized, doub le-blind, placebo-controlled, pa rallel-group study in subjects 
with moderate to severe UC who completed thei r participation in an induction study (either 
SHP647-301 or SHP647-302) and achi eved a clinical response. 
Clinical response is defined as: 
1. A decrease from induction study (SHP647-301 or  SHP647-302) baseline in the composite 
score of patient-reported symptoms using daily electronic diary (e-diary) and centrally read 
endoscopy of at least 2 points and at leas t 30%, with an accompanying decrease in the 
subscore for rectal bleeding (RB) ≥1 point or a subscore for RB ≤1 
OR 
2. A decrease from induction study (SHP647-301 or SHP647-302) baseline in total Mayo score 
of at least 3 points and at leas t 30%, with an accompanying decrease in the RB subscore of at 
least 1 point or an absolute RB subscore of 0 or 1. 
This study consists of a 52-week, double-blind treatment period, followed by a 12-week safety 
follow-up period for subjects who either discon tinue treatment early or who complete the 
treatment period and do not en ter the LTS study (SHP647-304). 
Approximately 696 subjects were planne d to be enrolled into the study ( Figure 1 ): approximately 
592 subjects from active inducti on treatments and approximately  104 subjects from placebo 
induction groups. The eligibility of a subject fo r the study will be assessed based on the study 
data collected at the Week 12 visit of the induction studies, whic h will be considered as the 
baseline visit for th is maintenance study. 
Eligible subjects who received active treatment in 1 of the induction studies and achieved a 
clinical response will be randomly assigned as follows: subjects who received 25 mg 
ontamalimab in 1 of the inducti on studies will be randomized (1 :1) to receive either 25 mg 
ontamalimab or placebo, and subjects who r eceived 75 mg ontamalimab in 1 of the induction 
studies will be randomized (1 :1) to receive either 75 mg ontamalimab or placebo. 
Eligible subjects who received placebo in 1 of  the induction studies and achieved a clinical 
response will be randomly assigned in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive 1 of 3 treatments (25 mg ontamalimab, 75 mg ontamalimab, or pla cebo, respectively) during this maintenance 
study. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 37 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
Subjects will be stratified according to glucoc orticoid use at SHP647-303 baseline, the subject’s 
status of prior anti-TNF treatment  (naïve or experienced), and the degree of clinical response in 
the induction study (whether remi ssion is achieved or not). 
Subjects enrolled in this study (SHP647-303) will receive double-blind maintenance treatment in 
the form of SC injections, using a prefilled syringe (PFS), Q4W for 52 weeks. Subjects will 
undergo efficacy,  and safety assessments as 
detailed in Table 1 . 
Under Amendment 3, subjects who complete the double-blind trea tment period, or subjects who 
are withdrawn from the study prior to completing  the double-blind treatmen t period due to early 
closure of the study by the sponsor, may be eligible to enter the LTS study (SHP647-304) 
provided they meet the eligibility criteria under SHP647-304 Amendment 4. Offering treatment 
in the LTS study after exiting th is maintenance study allows s ubjects who benefited from active 
treatment, in this study or the i nduction study, to potentially benefi t from continued treatment at 
the same dose of ontamalimab or at different dose of ontamalimab if, during the course of the 
SHP647-304 study, one of those doses (25 mg or 75 mg) is determined to be more efficacious 
based on emergent data from the induction studies. However, if th ere is no evidence of efficacy 
of either of the doses in comparison to place bo in the UC/CD clinical study, the entire program 
may be stopped, including the LTS study. Subj ects who are not ente ring Study SHP647-304 will 
enter a 12-week safety follow-up period. 
The overall study design is shown in Figure 2 .

3.1.1 Rationale for Primary Endpoint 
The Mayo score has historically been used as the primary endpoint for pivotal studies of agents 
intended to treat UC. Over the past decade, health authority thinking regarding efficacy 
endpoints for UC has evolved such that the traditional total Ma yo score is no longer 
recommended. Current regulatory guidance (US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] 
Ulcerative Colitis: Clinical Trial Endpoints Gu idance for Industry [Draft], 2016; European 
Medicines Agency [EMA] Guideline on the Deve lopment of New Medici nal Products for the 
Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis [Draft], 2016) includes a dual m easurement of patient-reported 
signs and symptoms outcomes (SF and RB), and clinician-reported  endoscopic outcomes 
(scoring any endoscopy with evidence of friabi lity as a 2), including histology. Per agreement 
with health authorities, these 3 outcomes will be reported as a composite score. 
Data will be collected to calculate the total Ma yo score using both the traditional and modified 
endoscopy subscore as a sensitivity analysis and to estimate the impact of the modification on 
the primary endpoint. 
3.1.2 Rationale for Key Secondary Endpoints 
The first 2 key secondary endpoints are included to comply with EMA advice to support the 
composite primary endpoint with  a key secondary analysis, wher e the patient-reported symptoms 
and clinician-reported endoscopy are analyzed as “co-primary.” 
The third endpoint, maintenance of remission, is used to demonstrate that the induction of 
remission is maintained over 52 weeks. This end point is used to support the maintenance of 
remission indication. The clinical response endpoint is based on the new composite score, and also represents 1 of the 
entry criteria for the maintena nce study. This endpoint has not been previously tested. 
Mucosal healing as a key sec ondary endpoint comprises both endoscopic and histologic 
components as recommended in the draft FDA and EMA guidance on UC (FDA Ulcerative 
Colitis: Clinical Trial Endpoints Guidance for Industry [Draft], 2016; EMA Guideline on the Development of New Medicinal Products for th e Treatment of Ulcerativ e Colitis [Draft], 2016). 
The Geboes Score (see Appendix 2) will be used to evaluate histologic remission and to 
complement the endoscopic subscore  in the assessment of mucosal healing for the key secondary 
endpoint. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 41 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
The key secondary endpoints of glucocorticoid -free clinical remission and glucocorticoid-free 
remission are the ultimate treatment goals for all patients with UC (EMA Guideline on the 
Development of New Medicinal Products for th e Treatment of Ulcerativ e Colitis [Draft], 2016). 
3.1.3 Rationale for Treatment Failure 
To avoid confounding this study with rescue tr eatment, changes or additions to background 
therapy for UC are not permitted  (except for glucocorticoid tapering and dose reductions for 
subject safety). Ulcerative colitis  is a disease with considerable  variability in symptoms, and 
changes in treatment usually are not warranted for fluctuations of  limited severity or duration. 
However, when the increase in symptoms is clinically significant and sustained, treatment failure 
may be declared (see Section 4.5.1.1 ). In this setting “treatment failure” is not meant to imply 
lack of drug efficacy, but rather to provide a timely escape mechanism for subjects whose 
disease is not adequately contro lled by investigational product (w hich could be placebo) plus 
background therapy (eg, limited dose  of systemic glucocorticoids ). Subjects who meet the 
criteria for treatment failure will exit the study early and have an option to enter the LTS study 
SHP647-304 to receive activ e treatment with ontama limab as well as rescue therapy, or to 
complete an early termination ( ET) visit after which study-prohibit ed treatments may be used as 
clinically appropriate. 
Treatment failure assessment may begin no earlier than the Week 4 scheduled visit. 
3.2 Duration and Study Completion Definition 
Each subject’s final visit in this study will be the Week 52/ET visit, if continuing to the 
LTS study SHP647-304, or at the end of the 12-w eek safety follow-up period if not entering 
Study SHP647-304. Both the Week 52/ET and 12-week safety follow-up visits are preferred to 
be on-site visits; however, due to a pandemic [eg, coronavirus disease (COVID-19)] or other 
future similar unexpected public health concerns requiring physical distancing that may result in 
subjects missing their visits, these may also be done at a subject’s  home provided a qualified site 
staff member performs these evaluations fo llowing Direct-to-Patient (DTP) guidance. 
A subject’s maximum duration of pa rticipation is expected to be approximately 64 weeks. It was 
expected that the study would be completed in approximately 3.5 years; however, due to early 
closure by the sponsor, the study is expect ed to be completed by November 2021.

The study completion date is defined as the date th e final subject, across all sites, comp letes their 
final protocol-defined assessment. Please note that this includes the follow-up visit or contact, 
whichever is later. The study comp letion date is used to ascert ain timing for study results posting 
and reporting. 
3.3 Sites and Regions 
This study will be conducted in approximately  164 sites in approximately 31 countries.

condition (eg, renal, hepatic, hematologic, GI (except disease under study), endocrine, 
cardiovascular, pulmonary, immunologic [eg, Felty’s s yndrome], or local active 
infection/infectious illness) that, in the inves tigator’s judgment, will substantially increase the 
risk to the subject if he or she participates in the study. 
9. Subjects with any other severe acute or ch ronic medical or psyc hiatric condition or 
laboratory or ECG abnormality th at may increase the risk associ ated with study participation 
or investigational product administration or may interfere w ith the interpretation of study 
results and, in the judgment of  the investigator, w ould make the subject inappropriate for 
entry into this study. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 45 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
10. Subjects with known exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis  (TB) since testing at screening 
in induction study SHP647-301 or SHP647-302 and who are without a generally accepted 
course of treatment. 
11. Subjects who are investigational site staff member s or relatives of those site staff members or 
subjects who are sponsor em ployees directly involved in the conduct of the study. 
12. Subjects who are participating in or plan to participate in othe r investigational studies (other 
than induction study SHP647-301 or SHP647-302) during Study SHP647-303. 
4.3 Restrictions 
Smoking can have an influence on the severity of  UC disease symptoms. Subjects should inform 
the investigator of any changes to their smoking habits during the study; however, these data will 
not be captured in the electroni c case report form (eCRF). Use of nicotine patches should be 
recorded as concomitan t medication (see Section 5.2). 
For the purposes of this protocol , dietary supplements (such as vi tamins, minerals, purified food 
substances, and herbals with pharmaceutical pr operties) are considered to be concomitant 
medications (see Section 5.2). 
4.4 Reproductive Potential 
The potential effects of ontama limab on embryofetal or postnatal development have not been 
assessed in humans. Preliminary results from an enhanced pre-and postnatal development 
toxicity study of ontamalimab in  nonhuman primates i ndicated that, at the dose levels tested 
(30 and 60 mg/kg), infant losses were incr eased in ontamalimab-exposed animals when 
compared both to control animal s in the study and to the historic al control animal data from the 
testing facility. The relevance of this finding to humans is  unknown but cannot be excluded. 
Based on the exposure in the Phase 2 clinical study A7281009 (area under th e concentration-time 
curve [AUC] from 0 to 672 hours [AUC 0-672h ] at 6140 µg ∙h/mL following repeated 
SC administration of 75 mg SHP647 Q4W), mate rnal exposure (AUC) in cynomolgus monkeys 
within a similar duration at 30 and 60 mg/kg onc e every 10 days is approximately 77 times and 
172 times the clinical ex posure, respectively. 
To minimize the risk of unintenti onal exposure of the embryo or fetus in the clinical study, all 
sexually active male and female subjects who, in the opinion of the inves tigator, are biologically 
capable of having children and with their partners are at risk of pregnancy, must agree to use an 
appropriate form of contraception (ie, highly effective methods for female and medically 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 46 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
appropriate methods for male study subj ects), in accordance with the package 
instructions/leaflet, for the duration of the activ e treatment period and for at least 16 weeks after 
the last dose of inve stigational product. 
True abstinence is considered to be a highly effe ctive contraception (ie, a method that results in a 
failure rate of <1% per year) when it is in line  with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
subject. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovul ation, symptothermal, postovulation methods), 
declaration of abstinence for the duration of exposure to investigational product, and withdrawal 
are not appropriate meth ods of contraception. 
During the induction studies (SHP647-301 and SHP 647-302), the investigator or designee in 
consultation with the subject will confirm the subj ect’s childbearing potentia l status. For subjects 
of childbearing potential, it must be confirmed an d documented that the subject has selected the 
most appropriate method of cont raception (ie, highly effective methods for female and medically 
appropriate methods for male st udy subjects) from the permitted list of contraception methods. 
Subjects must affirm the consiste nt and correct use of at leas t 1 of these selected methods. 
Regular contraception check discussions will take place at the time points specified in Table 1 
(ie, at each site visit) and will be documented. In addition, the subj ect must be instructed to call 
the site immediately if the sele cted contraception method is di scontinued or if pregnancy is 
known or suspected. 
4.4.1 Contraceptive Methods for Female Study Subjects 
At baseline (Visit 1) in this study, the childbearing potential of subjects must be re-established 
and documented if the subject’s status has ch anged since the induction studies (SHP647-301 or 
SHP647-302) (see Section 7.3.3.7). 
Sexually active females of childbearing potential  must already be usi ng an established highly 
effective form of contraception, and must be  advised to use appropr iate contraceptives 
throughout the study period and for 16 weeks following the last dose of investigational product. 
If hormonal contraceptives are used they should be  administered according to the package insert. 
Contraception methods with low user dependency s hould preferably be used, in particular when 
contraception is introduced as a result of partic ipation in the clinical study. The following highly 
effective contraceptive methods are considered to be me thods with low user dependency: 
• Intrauterine device 
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 47 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
• Male sterilization/vasectomized partner 
• Implantable progesterone-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation. 
Female subjects should be in 1 of the following categories: 
• Postmenopausal (12 consecutive mont hs of spontaneous amenorrhea and ≥51 years of 
age); postmenopausal status should be c onfirmed by follicle-stimulating hormone 
(FSH) testing. 
• Surgically sterile (having undergone one of the following surgical acts: hysterectomy, 
bilateral tubal ligation, bilate ral oophorectomy or b ilateral salpingectomy) and at least 
6 weeks poststerilization or has medi cally confirmed ovarian failure. 
• Females of childbearing potenti al with a negative pregnanc y test result at baseline 
(ie, Week 12 of the induction st udy SHP647-301 or SHP647-302; Week 0 of 
Study SHP647-303). Females of childbearing po tential must agree to practice true 
abstinence (refrain from sexual activity that c ould result in pregnanc y) or agree to use 
appropriate methods of highl y effective contraception. 
Highly effective contraception (ie,  methods that result in a failure rate of <1% per year when 
used consistently and correctly) are: 
• Combined (estrogen- and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraceptives 
associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral,  intravaginal, transd ermal) stabilized for 
at least 30 days before baseline (ie,  Week 12 of the induction study SHP647-301 or 
SHP647-302; Week 0 of Study SHP647-303) 
• Progestogen-only hormonal contr aception associated with in hibition of ovulation plus 
a barrier method 
• Intrauterine device 
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion 
• Male sterilization/vasectomized partner with documented absen ce of sperm in the 
postvasectomy ejaculate 
• True abstinence (see Section 4.4).

SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
4.4.2 Contraceptive Methods for Male Study Subjects 
Contraception is required for all sexually activ e male subjects, who w ith their female sexual 
partners must agree to use one of the followi ng appropriate methods of  contraception throughout 
the study period and for 16 weeks following th e last dose of inve stigational product. 
Appropriate methods of contracep tion for male subjects are: 
• Male condom with spermicide; however, if sp ermicide is not availa ble in the country, 
additional contraception (ie, 1 of those liste d below) must be used in addition to a 
male condom. 
• Male sterilization with documented absen ce of sperm in the postvasectomy ejaculate. 
o Appropriate methods for female sexual pa rtners of male subjects are (unless 
the female sexual partner is sterile [surgically or doc umented nonsurgical 
sterility]): 
• Use of a highly effective method of  contraception listed in Section 4.4.1 OR an 
acceptable method of contraception (failure rate of >1% per year) 
o Female condom with spermicide (use by female sexual partner); however, if 
spermicide is not available in the country, additional contraception (ie, 1 of 
those listed below) must be used in addition to a female condom 
o Intrauterine device with spermicide 
o Contraceptive sponge with spermicide 
o Intravaginal system (eg, vaginal ring with spermicide, a diaphragm with 
spermicide, or a cervical cap with spermicide). 
4.5 Withdrawal of Subjects 
A subject may withdraw from th e study at any time for any re ason without prejudice to their 
future medical care by the physic ian or at the institution. The investigator or sponsor may 
withdraw the subject at any time (eg, in the in terest of subject safety). The investigator is 
encouraged to discuss withdraw al of a subject from investigational product with the medical 
monitor when possible. 
If investigational product is disc ontinued, regardless of the reason, the evaluations listed for 
Week 52/ET (Visit 14) are to be performed. All subjects who discontinue investigational product 
and who are not entering the LTS st udy (SHP647-304) should also undergo the 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 49 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
protocol-specified 12-week safe ty follow-up period. In the even t that subjects are unable to 
attend in person for the safety follow-up visits, al l efforts should be made to collect information 
on AEs and concomitant medications. Comments (spont aneous or elicited) or complaints made 
by the subject must be recorded. The reason for termination and date of  stopping investigational 
product must be recorded.  
Subjects who discontinue will not be replaced. 
4.5.1 Subject Withdrawal Criteria 
Additional reasons a subject may be withdrawn from study treatment  include but ar e not limited 
to: 
• Adverse events 
• Serious AEs 
• Meeting the criteria for treatment failure 
• Pregnancy 
• Protocol deviations 
• Failure to return for visits. 
A subject should be with drawn from study treatment: 
• If a new therapy is initiated for UC, or 
• If a subject undergoes surgery for UC. 
Subjects who withdraw from study treatment due to an increase in disease symptoms may see 
nonstudy-related physicians for treatment and may receive treatments prohibited during the 
treatment periods of this study. 
If a subject chooses to withdraw from study participation due to personal concerns related to a 
pandemic (eg, coronavirus disease [COVID-19]) or ot her future similar une xpected public health 
concerns requiring physical distanci ng that may result in subjects mis sing their visits (other than 
a COVID-19-related or other pand emic-related AE), this should be specified as the reason for 
subject withdrawal in  the source document. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 50 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
If a subject withdraws their consent, no fu rther evaluation should be performed, and no 
additional data should be collected. The sponsor  may retain and continue to use any data 
collected before such wi thdrawal of consent. 
4.5.1.1 Definition of Treatment Failure 
Treatment failure is declared  when 3 conditions are met: 
• E-diary documented sustained* symp tomatic worsening that includes RB 
• No other etiology (ie, inf ection) can be identified 
• Endoscopy confirms disease activity. 
*Sustained: for at least 1 week if the RB score has increased by ≥ 2 points, or at least 2 weeks if 
the RB score has increased by <2 points. 
If treatment failure is not confir med, subjects may continue with  their next scheduled visit. 
4.5.1.2 Assessing for Treatment Failure 
Treatment failure as sessment may begin no earlier than the Week 4 scheduled visit. 
All subjects will be monitored fo r potential symptomatic worsening at every visit. Initiation of 
assessment for treatment failure requires the pr esence of worsening in SF, RB, or both. Rectal 
bleeding must be present for a diagnosis of treatment failure , although it need not have 
worsened. Criteria for sympto matic worsening are shown in Table 2 . 
Table 2 Criteria for Symptomatic Worsening of Treatment Failure (Must be Met at 
Each of 2 Sequential Vi sits) E-diary Entries 
Increase of at least 1 point over baseline in each domain (SF and RB) 
OR 
Increase in RB score ≥2 points over baseline, regardless of SF 
OR 
Increase in SF score ≥2 points over baseline with presence of RB 
OR 
Current SF or RB score of 3 points and an  increase from baseline in the other ≥1 domain 
OR 
Current SF score of 3 and a RB score of 3 
RB=rectal bleeding; SF=stool frequency 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 51 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
Subjects who experience rapid symptomatic wo rsening and need an unscheduled evaluation 
between visits will additionally be  assessed for treatment failure. Other (eg, infectious) etiologies 
of symptomatic worsening must be ruled out by assessment of appr opriate stool samples 
(see Appendix 4 for Clostridium difficile testing). If a potential ot her cause is identified, 
treatment failure will not be assessed until a full course of treatment has been completed (or clear 
lack of response is identified) or if untreated, the infection would be expected to have resolved 
based on its natural history. 
If no other etiology is conf irmed, increased e-diary scores must still be present at a confirmatory 
visit for potential treatment failure assessment. Note that while criteria must be met at each visit, 
it is not required that the same criteria are met at  both visits. If testing fo r infectious agents does 
not reveal an etiology, an endoscopy must be scheduled to confirm th e treatment failure. The 
timing of the endoscopy (ie, be fore or after the confirmato ry visit) will depend on the 
investigator’s assessment of urgency. The endoscopy will confirm the presence of treatment failure if either of the following is present: 
• An endoscopic subscore that has increased by at least 1 point ove r baseline in this 
maintenance study 
OR 
• An endoscopic subscore of at least 2. 
4.5.1.3 After Treatment for Infectious Etiology 
If a subject completed an initial assessment for treatment failure and an infectious etiology was 
identified and appropriately treated, they should be  assessed for the efficacy of the treatment. If 
despite treatment they continue to  meet treatment failure criteria based on e-diary criteria, they 
should proceed immediately to endoscopy. 
4.5.2 Reasons for Withdrawal 
The reason for withdrawal must be determined by the investigator and reco rded in the subject’s 
medical record. This includes unavoidable circum stances, such as a pand emic (eg, coronavirus 
disease [COVID-19]) or other future similar unexpected public health  concerns requiring 
physical distancing that may result in subjects missing their visits. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 52 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
If a subject chooses to withdraw from study participation due to personal concerns related to a 
pandemic (eg, coronavirus disease [COVID-19]) or ot her future similar une xpected public health 
concerns requiring physical distanci ng that may result in subjects mis sing their visits (other than 
a COVID-19-related or other pand emic-related AE), this should be specified as the reason for 
subject withdrawal in the eCRF. 
Reasons for discontinuation incl ude but are not limited to: 
• Adverse event 
• Protocol deviation 
• Withdrawal by subject 
• Lost to follow-up 
• Treatment failure 
• Other (if “other” is selected, the i nvestigator must specify the reason) 
• Death 
• Physician decision 
• Pregnancy 
• Screen failure 
• Site terminated by sponsor. 
4.5.3 Subjects “Lost to Follow-up” Prior to Last Scheduled Visit 
A minimum of 3 documented attempts must be made to contact any subject lost to follow-up at 
any time point before the last scheduled contact (office visit or telephone contact). At least 1 of 
these documented attempts must include a written communication sent to the subject’s last 
known address via courier or mail (with an acknowl edgement of receipt re quest) asking that they 
return to the site for final safety evalua tions and that they re turn their e-diary.

5. PRIOR AND CONCOMI TANT TREATMENT 
5.1 Prior Treatment 
Prior treatment includes all treatment (including bu t not limited to herbal remedies and vitamins) 
that is ongoing at the time of the baseline visit (Visit 1). It is exp ected that prior treatment will 
have been recorded dur ing the induction study. 
5.2 Concomitant Treatment  
Concomitant treatment refers to all treatment taken between the dates of the first dose of 
investigational product in this maintenance study and the end of  the 12-week safety follow-up 
period, inclusive. 
5.2.1 Permitted Treatment 
Subjects must remain on  stable doses of permitted UC treatments until completion of the 
Week 52 visit, unless decreases are required because of AEs. Stable doses of the following 
treatments for UC are permitted as concomitant medication: 
• Oral 5-ASA (mesalamine) and sulfasalazine 
• Immunosuppressants (AZA, 6-MP, methotrexate [MTX]) 
• Oral glucocorticoids; however, taperi ng is mandatory starting on Day 1. As the 
subjects are transferred from induction studies SHP647-301 or SHP647-302, the 
maximum systemic glucocorticoid dose is 20 mg/day of oral predni sone or equivalent 
(see Appendix 3), and the maximum dose of topi cally active glucocorticoid is 
9 mg/day of oral budesonide or 5 mg/day of oral beclomethas one. Tapering should 
follow the procedure shown in Table 3 . 
Note: Rectal 5-ASA and parenteral or rectal glucocortico ids are prohibited.

Table 3 Glucocorticoid Tapering 
 First Taper Second Taper 
Timing Prospectively define glucocorticoid-dependent 
subjects (ie, European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation)
a When subject is stable 
Increments • If daily dose >10 mg: Taper by 5 mg/day each 1-2 weeks 
• When daily dose is ≤10 mg: 
Taper by 2.5 mg/day each 1-2 weeks 
• When daily dose of budesonide is up to a maximum of 9 mg/day: Taper by 3 mg every 3 weeks • If daily dose of prednisone is >5 mg: Taper by 2.5 mg/day each week 
• When daily dose of prednisone is ≤5 mg: Taper by 1 mg/day each week 
Action if unable to taper Return to SHP647-303 baseline dose Return to last effective dose: 
• If >10 mg, exit study 
• If ≤10 mg, remain as failure for 
glucocorticoi d-free population. 
a Glucocorticoid-dependent subjects are: 
Subjects who are unable to reduce glucocorticoids below the equivalent of prednisone 10 mg/day (or budesonide below 
3 mg/day) within 3 months of starting gluc ocorticoids, without re current active disease 
OR 
Subjects who have a relapse within 3 months of stopping glucocorticoids ( Dignass et al., 2012 ). 
During the glucocorticoid taper, subjects may ex perience worsening of UC signs or symptoms 
that, in the opinion of the investigator, are attr ibutable to reduction in  glucocorticoid dose. If 
signs or symptoms occur, the investigator can instruct the subject to revert to the preceding 
week’s daily dosage. The signs or  symptoms leading to this change (eg, increased SF, increased 
RB) must be recorded. 
Subjects using medicinal mariju ana (cannabis) under a physicia n’s prescription, and who obtain 
the product from a licensed pharm acy or provider, should conti nue to use it under the same 
regimen for the duration of the st udy, unless otherwise instructed by the investigator or treating 
physician. Routine nonlive vaccinations ar e allowed during the study. 
Dietary and herbal supplements and probiotics are allowed in th e study, provided they are being 
taken at stable doses at the time  of the baseline visit (Visit 1)  and for the duration of the study. 
They should be recorded as  concomitant medications. 
Use of nicotine patches should be r ecorded as concomitant medication.

5.2.2 Prohibited Treatment 
The following common treatments are excluded medi cations for this study. As the subjects are 
transferred from induction studies SHP647- 301 or SHP647-302, during which these treatments 
were also prohibited, no washout period is applicable. 
• Anti-integrin or antiadhesion molecule treatment (eg, natalizumab, vedolizumab, 
efalizumab, etrolizumab) 
• Parenteral and rectally ad ministered glucocorticoids 
• Rectally administered 5-ASA 
• Anti-TNF treatment and other biolog ics with immunomodulatory properties 
• Live (attenuated) vaccines 
• Any nonbiologic treatment with immunomodul atory properties (other than their 
current background UC treatment) 
• Leukocyte apheresis or selective lymphocyte,  monocyte, or granulocyte apheresis or 
plasma exchange. 
Treatments not listed in this section may be considered allowable; see Section 5.2.1 for further 
details. 
No new nonpharmacological therap ies that might affect bowel habit or GI function should be 
started during the study. 
5.2.3 Rescue Therapy 
Subjects must maintain their stable dose of background UC treatment, unless dose reduction or 
discontinuation are required due to  associated AEs. If a subject requires initiation of a new 
therapy or increase in glucocorticoids for UC above the SHP647-303 baselin e level, the subject 
should be withdrawn from study treatment and ente r the safety follow-up period, and appropriate 
treatment should be given at the discretion of the investigator. 
Subjects who enter the follow-up pe riod will no longer need to abst ain from the medications that 
were prohibited during the baseline and treatme nt periods. High-dose gluc ocorticoids and other 
UC treatments will be allowed. Biologics or nonbiologic immunosuppressants should not be 
initiated during the safety follow-up period wi thout prior discussion with the sponsor study 
physician or designee due to the long half-life of ontamalimab.

5.3 COVID-19 
In cases in which the subject is  known to have been infected with the COVID-19 virus but does 
not have the disease, he or she should be actively moved to lower doses of prednisone 
(<20 mg/day) or transition to budesonide when  feasible. Thiopurines and MTX should be 
temporarily withheld. The study dr ug should have dosing delayed for 2 weeks while the subject 
is monitored for the de velopment of COVID-19.

6. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT 
6.1 Identity of Investigational Product 
The test product is ontamalimab, which will be  provided as a sterile aqueous buffered solution 
for SC administration in a glass PFS with a fixed needle. Each PFS contains 1 mL of 
ontamalimab solution for injection at an appropria te concentration to provide the intended dose 
of drug (25 mg or 75 mg). Additional informati on is provided in the current ontamalimab IB. 
The reference product is placebo, which will be pr ovided in a PFS with a fixed needle containing 
1 mL of placebo solution for SC administrati on. The placebo solution will contain the same 
sterile aqueous buffered solution as the test  product but will not contain ontamalimab. 
6.1.1 Blinding the Treatment Assignment 
The placebo syringes and solution will match the ont amalimab syringes in appearance. The fill 
volume for all syringes will be the same. 
6.2 Administration of In vestigational Product 
6.2.1 Interactive Response Technology for Investigational Product Management 
An interactive response technology (IRT) system w ill be used for enrolling subjects, recording 
subject visits, randomization, investigational product supply dispensation and management, 
inventory management and s upply ordering, investigational product expiration tracking and 
management, and emergency unblin ding. Please refer to the Study Ma nual for additional details 
regarding the IRT system. 6.2.2 Allocation of Subjects to Treatment 
This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The actual treatment given to individual 
subjects is determined by a randomization schedule. 
The composite score and total Mayo score will be calculated at baselin e (Week 12/Visit 6 of 
induction study SHP647-301 or SHP647-302 will be used for Week 0/Day 1/Visit 1 of 
Study SHP647-303) before randomization. Endoscopic subscore based on the central reader’s assessment will be used to determine eligibility. 
Subjects who are qualified as a clin ical responder, who fulfill all other eligibility criteria, and 
who received active treatment  in the induction study (SHP 647-301 or SHP647-302) will be 
randomized via a computer-generat ed randomization schedule as foll ows: subjects who received 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 58 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
25 mg ontamalimab in 1 of the induction studies will be randomized (1:1) to receive either 
25 mg ontamalimab or placebo, and subjects who received 75 mg ontamalimab in 1 of the 
induction studies will be randomi zed (1:1) to receive either 75  mg ontamalimab or placebo. 
Subjects who are qualified as a clin ical responder, who fulfill all other eligibility criteria, and 
who received placebo in the inductio n study will be randomly assigned in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive 
1 of 3 treatments (25 mg ontam alimab, 75 mg ontamalimab, or pl acebo, respectively) during this 
maintenance study. 
Subjects will be stratified according to glucoc orticoid use at SHP647-303 baseline, the subject’s 
status of prior anti-TNF treatment  (naïve or experienced), and the degree of clinical response in 
the induction study (whether remi ssion is achieved or not). 
The randomization number represents a unique nu mber corresponding to i nvestigational product 
allocated to the subject, once elig ibility has been determined. I ndividual subject treatment is 
automatically assigned by the IRT system. Investigational product packag ing identification numbers, separate from randomization 
numbers/unique identifiers, may al so be assigned to subjects for specific treatment assignment as 
dictated by the study. In these cases, the same  investigational product packing identification 
number may not be assigned to more than 1 subject. 
6.2.3 Dosing 
Investigational product (ontamalimab or plac ebo) will be administered subcutaneously by 
qualified site personnel Q4W up to Week 52. See Section 7.3 for the timing of dosing relative to 
other procedures. Investigational product shoul d be administered in the anterolateral right or left thigh. If there are 
clinical reasons why the inve stigational product ca nnot be administered in the thigh, the 
investigational product ma y be administered in the deltoid area or abdomen with appropriate 
documentation. The location of the investigatio nal product administration will be recorded. 
After the first administration of investigati onal product, the subject must be observed by a 
member of the study staff for at least 30 minutes (the to tal duration should be  determined at the 
discretion of the investigator). For subsequent administrations, obser vation of the subject is at the 
discretion of the investigator. In jection site and allergic reactio n monitoring should be completed 
by a member of th e study staff. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 59 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
Principal investigators are re sponsible for ensuring that all study and nonstudy personnel 
identified to administer investigational product are qualified, with documented training and 
delegation of responsibilities prio r to their firs t investigational product administration visit at 
subjects’ homes (see Section 10.2.1 ). 
In a situation in which a subject is not ab le to visit the study s ite due to a pandemic 
(eg, coronavirus disease [COVID-19]) or other futu re similar unexpected public health concerns 
requiring physical distancing that may result in subjects missing their visits, DTP investigational 
product administration options may be available, in accordance with local regulations (refer to 
DTP guidance document). 
All subjects and nonstudy personnel performing th e investigational product administration must 
receive training in order to receive DTP ship ments. Training will include how to identify 
hypersensitivity reactions, inject the IP, and properly  dispose of IP after use. Training may be in 
person or via telephone call. All DTP ship ments will require pre-administration and 
post-administration calls by the site staff to assess and monitor subject’s health status and safety; 
to review any AEs, concomitant medications, and diary assessments; and to perform the 
neurological questionnaire asse ssment by the investigator. These calls must be appropriately 
recorded in the source document. 
The personnel that perform study procedures at the subjects’ ho mes will be delegated, trained, 
and properly supervised by the princi pal investigator(s) of each site. 
All study and nonstudy personnel will be trained on potential hypersensitivity reactions (Type I 
and Type III) and associated symptoms. 
NOTE: DTP investigational pr oduct administration, except when  performed by study personnel, 
is NOT ALLOWED for a subject’s first dose of investigational pr oduct in this study. 
Investigator-directed delays in dosing due to ab normal laboratory findings or AEs or due to a 
pandemic (eg, coronavirus disease [COVID-19]) or ot her future similar une xpected public health 
concerns requiring physical distan cing that may result in subjects missing their visits should be 
discussed with the medical monitor to determine whether the subject shou ld continue with the 
treatment. Dosing delays up to 8 weeks (2 doses) are allowed, and the subjects are allowed to 
miss a maximum of 2 doses due to COVID-rela ted or other pandemic- related issues (see 
Section 5.3). Sites must receive Shire approvals fo r each subject meeting the missed/delayed 
dosing criteria. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 60 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
The investigator, or an appr oved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all 
investigational product is disp ensed by qualified staff member s. During the COVID-19 public 
health emergency (or other similar pandemic), al ternative investigationa l product delivery to 
study participants may be necessary to avoid unn ecessary subject visits to sites while providing 
needed investigational product. Additional investigational pro duct may be dispensed during a 
scheduled study visit or investig ational product may be shipped di rectly from i nvestigational 
sites to participants’ residences by a contracted logistics provider  or distributor (DTP shipment) 
in compliance with national laws or temporary national emergency measures and sponsor 
processes. 
6.2.4 Unblinding the Treatment Assignment 
Whenever possible, the investigat or or subinvestigator should c ontact the Shire physician and/or 
assigned medical monitor before  breaking the blind. It is und erstood that in an emergency 
situation it may not be possible to communicate with the study team before breaking the blind. 
The safety of the subject should be of primary concern. When the blinding code is broken the 
reasons must be fully documented. 
In the event that the treatment assignment is broke n, the date, the signat ure of the person who 
broke the code, and the reason for breaking the code are recorded on the IRT and the source 
documents. Upon breaking the bli nd, the subject is withdrawn from the study, but should be 
followed up for safety purposes. The IRT will notif y the relevant personnel in the event of any 
code break. Code-break information is held by the pharmacist/designate d person at the site. 
Due to early termination of the ontamalimab pr ogram, the sponsor is providing an option for 
subjects who are responding to ac tive treatment in this maintena nce study or who are on placebo 
and had responded to active treatment in an induction study to continue  to receive ontamalimab 
in the long-term safety extension study SH P647-304. As this eligib ility criterion into 
SHP647-304 depends on the blinded treatment assi gnment in this study, for these subjects, there 
is a potential for the tr eatment assignment in this study to  be unblinded at the ET visit when 
assessing whether a subject can be a rollover in to the SHP647-304 study or proceed to the safety 
follow-up period. The date of the ET visit will be recorded. In addition, due to the early discontinuation of the SHP647 program, the SHP647-304 study is 
planned to be unblinded prior to the database lock in this study, which would unblind the 
treatment assignment in this study for a significan t portion of subjects. As such, this study will be 
considered unblinded when the SHP647-304 stud y is unblinded, and the date of study unblinding 
will be recorded.

6.3 Labeling, Packaging, Storage, and Handling 
6.3.1 Labeling 
The sponsor will provide the investigator with  packaged investigati onal product labeled in 
accordance with specific country regulatory requirements. All inve stigational prod uct is labeled 
with a minimum of the following: protocol num ber, medication identif ication number, dosage 
form (including product name and quantity in pack), directions  for use, storage conditions, 
expiry date (if applicable ), batch number and/or packaging refe rence, the statements “For clinical 
trial use only” and/or “CAUTION: New Dr ug – Limited by Federal (or US) Law to 
Investigational Use”, and the sponsor’s name and address. 
Additional labels may be applied in order to me et local or institutional requirements, but must 
not: 
• Contradict the clinical study label 
• Obscure the clinical study label 
• Identify the study subject by name. 
Additional labels may not be added without the sponsor’s prior written agreement. 
6.3.2 Packaging 
Investigational product is packag ed in the following labeled cont ainers: PFS with nominal fill 
volume of 1 mL. The PFS will be packaged in a foam insert and labeled carton. 
Changes to sponsor-supplied packaging before dosing may not occur wi thout prior written 
agreement by the sponsor. 
6.3.3 Storage 
The investigator has overall res ponsibility for ensuring th at investigational product is stored in a 
secure, limited-access lo cation. Limited responsibility may be delegated to the pharmacy or 
member of the study team, but th is delegation must be documente d. Investigational products are 
distributed by the pharmacy or delegated member of the study team. The pharmacist or delegated 
team member will enter the unique  subject identifier on the investig ational product labels as they 
are distributed. Investigational product must be stored in  accordance with labeled storage conditions. 
Temperature monitoring is required  at the storage location to en sure that the investigational 
product is maintained within an established temperatur e range. In case of a DTP situation, the 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 62 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
investigational product can  be shipped to subject’s home; please refer to DTP guidance for 
further details. 
The investigator is responsibl e for ensuring that th e temperature is monitored throughout the 
duration of the study and that records are main tained; the temperature should be monitored 
continuously by using either an in-house system, a mechanical recordi ng device such as a 
calibrated chart recorder, or by manual mean s, such that both minimum and maximum 
thermometric values over a specific time period can be recorded and retr ieved as required. Such 
a device (ie, certified minimum/maximum ther mometer) would require manual resetting upon 
each recording. The sponsor must be notified imm ediately upon discovery of any excursion from 
the established range. Temperature excursions wi ll require site investigation as to cause and 
remediation. The sponsor will dete rmine the ultimate impact of ex cursions on the investigational 
product and will provide supportive documentation as necessary. Under no circumstances should 
the product be dispensed to subjects until the impact has been determined and the product is 
deemed appropriate for use by the sponsor. The sponsor should be notified immediately if ther e are any changes to the storage area of the 
investigational product that coul d affect the integrity of the product(s), eg, fumigation of a 
storage room. 
6.3.4 Special Handling 
The investigational product should be protecte d from light and should not be frozen. Do not 
shake. In case of a DTP situation, the safety of  the investigational product will be managed; it 
will be transported via a secured courier or study site personnel with temperature monitoring and 
tracking; please refer to DT P guidance for further details. 
6.4 Drug Accountability 
Investigators will be provided with sufficient am ounts of the investigational product to carry out 
this protocol for the agreed number of subjects. The investigator or designee will acknowledge 
receipt of the investigational product, documenting shipment content and condition. Accurate 
records of all investigational product dispense d, used, returned, and/or destroyed must be 
maintained as detailed further in this section. 
The investigator has overall re sponsibility for adminis tering/dispensing investigational product. 
Where permissible, tasks may be delegated to a qualified designee (eg, a pharmacist) who is 
adequately trained in the protocol and who works under the direct supervisi on of the investigator. 
This delegation must be docum ented in the applicable study delegation of authority form. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 63 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
The investigator or his/her designee (as documented by the inves tigator in the applicable study 
delegation of authority form) will administer the investigational pr oduct only to subjects 
included in this study following the procedures set out in the study protocol. Each subject will be 
given only the investigational pr oduct carrying his/her treatment assignment. All administered 
investigational product will be documented in the subject’s source document and/or other 
investigational product recor d. In case of a DTP situati on, the investig ational product 
administration will be documented in the drug administration visit report form (if nonstudy 
personnel administer the i nvestigational product) and in the drug administration log (in case of 
self-administration by the subjects/caregivers/parents). 
No investigational product stock or returned inventory from a Shire- sponsored study may be 
removed from the site where or iginally shipped without prio r knowledge and consent by the 
sponsor. If such transfer is au thorized by the sponsor, all app licable local, state, and national 
laws must be adhered to for th e transfer. In case of a DTP situ ation, the process for shipping of 
used investigational product to the s ite is described in the DTP guidance. 
The sponsor or its representatives must be pe rmitted access to review the supplies storage and 
distribution procedures and reco rds provided that the blind of  the study is not compromised. 
With the written agreement of the sponsor, at the end of the study all unused stock may be 
destroyed at the site or a local  facility. In this case, destru ction records identifying what was 
destroyed, when and how, must be obtained with copies provided to the sponsor. Destruction of 
investigational products must be in accordance with local , state, and national laws. 
Based on entries in the site drug accountability forms, it must be possible to reconcile 
investigational products delivered  with those used and returne d. All investiga tional products 
must be accounted for and all discrepancies investigated a nd documented to the sponsor’s 
satisfaction. 
6.5 Subject Compliance 
Drug accountability must be assesse d at the container/packaging le vel for unused investigational 
product that is contained within the original tamper-evident seal ed container (eg, cartons) or at 
the individual count level for opened containers/packaging. The pharmacist or delegated team 
member will record details on the drug accountability form.

7. STUDY PROCEDURES 
7.1 Changes to Study Procedures Due to a Pandemic 
The following information provides guidance regardi ng changes to study pro cedures that may be 
implemented for study participants or study sites affected by a pandemic (eg, coronavirus disease 
[COVID-19]) or other future similar unexpected  public health concer ns requiring physical 
distancing that may result in subjects missing th eir visits. This guidan ce takes references from 
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical 
Products during COVID-19 Public Health Emerge ncy – Guidance for Industry, Investigators, 
and Institutional Review Boards, March 2020, up dated 02 July 2020; the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) Guidance on the Management of  Clinical Trials During the COVID-19 
(Coronavirus) Pandemic, Version 3 (28 April 2020); and the EMA Points to consider on 
implications of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on methodological aspect s of ongoing clinical 
trials, dated 26 June 2020. 
Because a pandemic (eg, COVID-19) may peak in  different regions at different times and 
restrictions implemented by local laws and recommendations  may vary, any decision on 
procedural changes should be made on a case-by -case basis by the principal investigator in 
consultation with the study team and the medica l team as needed, while maintaining subject 
safety and confidentiality as the priority. Procedural changes due to COVID-19 (or othe r similar pandemic) may include the following 
(refer to DTP guidance document for further details): 
• Allow study sites to follow COVID-19 screening requireme nts per local regulations. 
• Identify which study visits and procedures may be conducted in the clinic or by 
optional home healthcare and evaluations that may be done  remotely (eg, Telehealth, 
Telemedicine) (See Table 1 ). Home healthcare visits will  be documented in the study 
records. 
• Allowance of more flexibility around schedul ing of study visits and/or allowing some 
assessments to be conducted remotely (See Table 1 ). 
• For home healthcare visits, collection of cl inical laboratory samples (blood specimen 
collection or other diagnostic tests) may be  performed by the inves tigator or qualified 
site staff who can visit the trial participant’s residence. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 65 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
• Missed clinic visits or subject withdr awals due to COVID- 19 (or other similar 
pandemic) must be recorded in  the source document (See Section 4.5.2, Reasons for 
Withdrawal). 
• ECG procedures: For home hea lthcare visits, ECGs may be performed by a qualified 
healthcare professional who is authorized/cer tified to perform su ch tests routinely. 
• “Remote visits” via virtual communications  (eg, TeleHealth application) may be 
performed as a safety check (AE assessm ent) on subject well -being, concomitant 
medication use, neurologi cal assessments, etc. 
• Allow transfer of study participants to investigational sites away from risk zones or 
closer to their home that are already part icipating in the trial or to new sites. 
• Deviations from the protocol-specifi ed procedures (eg, not collecting a 
protocol-specified specimen, such as postdose bloodwork) will be recorded as related 
to COVID-19 (or othe r similar pandemic). 
• Alternative investigationa l product deliveries may include dispensing additional 
investigational product at clinic visits or DTP delivery of the investigational product 
from the investigational site to subjects  in compliance with national laws or 
temporary national emergency measures (See Section 6.2.3, Dosing and Section 6.3, 
Labeling, Packaging, Storage, and Handling). 
7.2 Study Schedule 
The investigator may schedule vi sits (unscheduled visits) in addition to those listed on the 
schedule of activities ( Table 1 ), in order to conduct evaluati ons or assessments required to 
protect the well-being of the subject. 
7.2.1 Baseline Visit 1 (Week 0/Day 1) 
Procedures performed at Week 12 (Visit 6)  of the induction studies (SHP647-301 or 
SHP647-302) will be the baseline (Day 1/Week 0)  assessments for this maintenance study. The 
baseline visit for this mainte nance study will be on the same da y as the Week 12 visit of the 
induction study. To be eligible for this maintenance study, subjects must have ac hieved a clinical 
response in the induction study (see Section 4.1 and Section 4.2 for a full list of inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, respectively). The assessments and procedures  performed during the baseline 
visit are specified in Table 1 . 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 66 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
A screen failure is a subject who has given informed consent or assent, as applicable (and whose 
parents or legally authorized repr esentatives have given informed c onsent, as applicable), failed 
to meet the inclusion criteria a nd/or met at least 1 of the excl usion criteria, and has not been 
randomized or administered investigationa l product. 
The composite score and total Mayo score will be calculated at ba seline of the SHP647-303 
study (Week 12/Visit 6 of the induction studies; used for Week 0/Day 1/Visit 1 of the 
maintenance studies) be fore randomization. 
For eligible subjects, all rele vant study information recorded  for Week 12 of the induction 
studies will be included in the baseline visit data for this main tenance study. The health outcome 
assessments completed at Week 12 in the induction study should have been completed before 
any other baseline visit a ssessments performed for this maintenance study. 
After eligibility has been confirmed and all baseline procedures and assessments have been completed, each subject will be randomized to 1 of the 3 trea tment groups as described in 
Section 6.2.2  and the first dose of investigatio nal product will be administered. 
7.2.2 Treatment Period 
7.2.2.1 Visits 2 to 13 (Weeks 4 to 48) 
The schedule of Visits 2 to 13 during the treatme nt period, and the assess ments and procedures 
to be performed at each visit, are specified in Table 1 . 
Note:  As soon as Amendment 3 is implemented, th e subject’s next scheduled visit will be the 
Week 52/ET visit, which should be conducted no  later than 4 weeks (±10 days) from the 
subject’s last study visit prior to implementation of SHP647-304 Amendment 4. 
7.2.2.2 Final On-treatment Visits: Visit 14, Pa rts 1 and 2 (Week 52/Early Termination) 
The Week 52/ET visit consists of 2 parts. Part 1 of Visit 14 must be completed within 10 days (preferably, within 5 to 7 days) before 
Part 2; this will allow sufficient time for data fro m the centrally read endoscopy to be available at 
Part 2 of the visit. The Week 52/ET assessments a nd procedures that will take place during Part 1 
are specified in Table 1 . 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 67 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
Part 2 of Visit 14 will take place on Day 364 ±10 days. The Week 52/ET assessments and 
procedures that will take place during Part 2 are specified in Table 1 . For subjects who meet the 
criteria for treatment failure (as defined in Section 4.5.1.1), or are discontinuing prior to 
completing the 52-week treatment period due to early study closure, and will be entering the 
LTS study (SHP647-304), Part 2 of Visit 14 should be  scheduled at least 2 weeks after the last 
dose of investigational product, to allow a sufficien t time interval prior to  the first dose in the 
LTS study. 
The Week 52/ET visit is preferred to be on-si te; however, due to a pa ndemic (eg, coronavirus 
disease [COVID-19]) or other future similar unexpected public health  concerns requiring 
physical distancing that may result in subjects missing their visits, the visit may also be done at a 
subject’s home provided a quali fied site staff member performs the evaluations following 
DTP guidance. 
Note:  For subjects discontinuing fro m the study due to early termination of the study by the 
sponsor, treatment response will be evaluated at the ET visit as well. Treatment response will be 
based on the following criteria: 
• Clinical composite score that has decreased by ≥2 points and ≥30%, with an 
accompanying decrease in the subscore for RB ≥1 point or a subscore for RB ≤1 from 
induction study (SHP647-301 or SHP647-302) baseline OR 
• Composite score that has decreased by ≥30% and ≥3 points compared to the higher 
baseline value for induction or maintenance studies from induction study 
(SHP647-301 or SHP647-302) baseline. 
Endoscopy is not  required (optional) at the ET visit if th e subject has not comp leted 52 weeks of 
treatment due to early closur e of the study (see Section 10.1.5 ). 
After both parts of Visit 14 have been complete d, the subject will eith er enter the LTS study 
(SHP647-304) or the 12-week safety follow-up period. 
The Week 52 assessments and procedures will al so form the ET assessments for any subjects 
who are withdrawn early from the study. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 68 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
7.2.3 Follow-up Period: Visit 15 (Week 64) 
Subjects who are withdrawn ear ly from the study, or w ho do not enter the LTS study 
(SHP647-304), should enter the 12-week safety fo llow-up period for safety monitoring. Subjects 
who are proceeding to the LTS study (SHP647-304) will not enter the safe ty follow-up period. 
For subjects who complete SHP647-303, safety  follow-up will occur 12 weeks following the 
subject’s last visit (Week 52) in the treatment period. 
At the end of the 12-week safety follow-up period, there will be a visit at the site on 
Day 448 ±10 days (for subjects who completed the 52-week treatment period) or 12 weeks 
±10 days after the ET visit (for subjects who are withdrawn early from the study), which will 
form the Week 64 visit (Visit 15) . The final 12-week safety follow-up visit is preferred to be 
on-site; however, due to a pandemic (eg, corona virus disease [COVID-19]) or other future 
similar unexpected public health  concerns requiring physical di stancing that may result in 
subjects missing their visits, th e visit may also be done at a subject’s home provided a qualified 
site staff member performs the evaluations following DTP guidance. The assessments and 
procedures specified in Table 1  will be performed, includi ng querying for SAEs, AEs, and 
concomitant medications and procedures. All AEs a nd SAEs that are not resolved at the time of 
this visit will be followe d to closure (see Section 8.1). 
7.2.4 Additional Care of Subj ects After the Study 
No aftercare is planned for this study. 
7.3 Study Evaluations and Procedures 
Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol-required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. However, it is antici pated that from time to  time there may be 
circumstances, outside the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to perform the 
tests and procedures. In these cases, the investigat or will take all steps necessary to ensure the 
safety and well-being of the subject. 
When timing of procedures and assessments co incide, the following orde r should be followed: 
• Patient-reported questionnaires 
• Vital signs and ECG 
• Laboratory sample collection 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 69 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
• Endoscopy (generally performed at  a separate visit; see Section 7.3.2.1) 
• Investigational pr oduct administration. 
Note: Blood and tissue samples ma y be stored for up to the dura tion allowed by local regulations 
but for no longer th an 25 years. 
7.3.1 Demographic and Other Ba seline Characteristics 
All relevant demographic and baseline characteristics reco rded for the in duction studies 
(SHP647-301 or SHP647-302) will be used as the ba seline characteristics for this maintenance 
study.  
7.3.2 Efficacy 
The primary efficacy endpoint is remission at the Week 52 visit. Remission is defined as a 
composite score of patient-reported symptoms using daily e-diary and centrally read endoscopy 
as described in Section 9.8.1. 
7.3.2.1 Endoscopy and Histology 
Endoscopy will be performed at the time points specified in Table 1 and will consist of either 
flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy (if preferred). 
If it is necessary, bowel preparation should be co nducted as per local routine. The position of the 
endoscope will be based on the length of the instrument at various levels of insertion as well as 
the morphological features of the intestine as seen during the ba seline endoscopy in the induction 
study (SHP647-301 or SHP647-302). The endoscopy report and any photographs and/or video 
recordings taken during the proce dure per local custom should be filed in the subject’s medical 
record. 
During endoscopy, 2 biopsy samples will be colle cted from the most inflamed area of the 
sigmoid colon at Week 52/ET. Endoscopy and bi opsy procedures will be defined in an 
endoscopy instructions manual and/or referen ce card(s), on which all sites will be trained. 
Endoscopy results will be reviewed by a central reader. Biopsy samples will be centrally-reviewed usi ng the Geboes Score cla ssification system and 
 (see Appendix 2) for the evaluation of histological disease 
severity in UC with higher num bers corresponding to more infl ammation. The Geboes score will 

Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 70 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
be used for the key and other secondary effica cy evaluations and  
 
Endoscopy is not  required (optional) at the ET visit if th e subject has not comp leted 52 weeks of 
treatment due to early closure of the study. 
7.3.2.2 Mayo Score 
The Mayo score is a measure of UC disease activity. Mayo scores (total or partial) will be 
recorded at the time points specified in Table 1 . 
The total Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12 points and consists of th e following 4 subscores, each 
graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores  indicating more severe disease (see Appendix 2): 
• Stool frequency (0-3) 
• Rectal bleeding (0-3) 
• Findings of endoscopy (0-3) 
• Physician global asse ssment (PGA; 0-3). 
The partial Mayo score consists of the Mayo sc ore without the endoscopi c subscores and ranges 
from 0 to 9 points. 
The composite score is a recommended measur e consisting of the Mayo score without the 
PGA subscore and ranges from 0 to 9 points. The composite score will be  used for the primary 
efficacy endpoint. 
Calculation of the total and pa rtial Mayo scores and composite score requires a self-assessment 
by the subject for SF and the amount of blood in the stool. These data on SF and RB will be 
captured in the patient-reported outcom e (PRO)-UC daily e-diary (see Section 7.3.2.3 ) as 
experienced over the previous 24 hours. 
The Mayo SF and RB subscores will be calculated ba sed on each subject’s e-diary data recorded 
over the most recent 3 days (consecutive or nonconsecu tive) of the last 10 days prior to the visit, 
excluding the following days: day of any bow el preparation, day of endoscopy, any days 
between day of bowel preparation and day of  endoscopy, and the 2 days after the day of 
endoscopy. 

Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 71 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
The mucosal appearance during the sigmoidosco pic portion of the endos copic examination will 
be assessed for the Mayo endoscopic subscore based on the scoring syst em provided in the 
protocol (see Appendix 2). The endoscopic appearance will be  read by both the study site 
investigator and a central reader  through video recorded during the procedure. Centrally read 
endoscopic subscores will be used for both eligibility and efficacy analyses. 
The PGA acknowledges the 3 other criteria: the subject’s recollec tion of abdominal discomfort 
and general sense of well-being and other obs ervations (such as phys ical findings and the 
subject’s performance status). The endoscopic subscore and th e PGA must be performed by a 
physician qualified to perform endoscopy; it is recommended that  the same physician performs 
all such assessments for a part icular subject throughout the st udy, and that the same physician 
who performed the assessments during the induc tion study does so during the current study. 
7.3.2.3 Patient-reported Outcome – Ulcerative Colitis Daily E-diary 
Patient-reported UC signs and symptoms data will be collected using a dail y e-diary that will be 
available throughout the study. Subjects will be required to enter data on UC signs and 
symptoms items using an electronic handheld device.  Compliance will be assessed by site staff at 
each visit. The site staff will instruct the subject on the appropriate use of the e-diary, particularly 
when compliance is below 80% (eg, <8 out of 10 diary entries) when compared with the 
previous visit. Subjects will be asked to record the following signs and symptom data, as experienced over the 
previous 24 hours, in the e-diary: 
• Stool frequency 
• Rectal bleeding severity and frequency 
• Diarrhea frequency 
• Urgency frequency 
• Abdominal pain worst severity. 
The full PRO-UC e-diary consists of 6 items. The first 2 items (SF and RB severity) will be used 
to determine the Mayo SF and RB subscores, which will be used to calculate the total and partial 
Mayo scores and the composite score. The PRO-UC e-diary is presented in Appendix 2.

7.3.3 Safety 
7.3.3.1 Medical and Medication History 
Medical history, including UC history, cardiac history, and smoking history, and prior 
medications will be collected at the screeni ng visit (Visit 1) of induction study SHP647-301 or 
SHP647-302. Concomitant medications and proce dures will be docum ented throughout the 
SHP647-303 study. 
7.3.3.2 Physical Examination (Including Weight) 
Complete and targeted physical examinations will be performed at the time points specified in 
Table 1 . Complete physical examina tion includes the review of  the following body systems: 
general appearance; skin; head, ey es, ears, nose, and throat; heart;  lungs; confrontational visual 
fields (eyes); breast (optional); abdomen; external ge nitalia (optional); ex tremities; neurologic 
function; back; and lymph nodes. Targeted physi cal examination include s the review of the 
following body systems:  skin, heart, lungs, confrontational visual fields (eyes), abdomen, and 
examination of body systems where there ar e symptom complaints  by the subject. 
Weight will be measured at th e time points specified in Table 1 . 
The complete physical examination performed  at Week 12 (Visit 6) of induction study 
SHP647-301 or SHP647-302 will be the baseline examination of Study SHP647-303. Abnormalities identified during th is visit will be documented. Any changes from the baseline 
visit (Week 0) in physical exa mination findings that are deemed  clinically significant in the 
opinion of the investigator are to be recorded as an AE. 
7.3.3.3 Targeted Neurological Assessment 
Targeted neurological assessments  to monitor the development of  signs and/or symptoms of 
PML will be performed at the time points specified in  Table 1 . Subjects will be evaluated to 
reveal any potential abnormalitie s in the following ne urological domains: vi sion, motor, tactile 
sensation, coordination/cerebellar function, sp eech, verbal comprehension, and 
cognition/behavior. 
If any abnormalities are indicated, subjects will be further evaluated to help clarify any potential 
abnormal responses. Focus will be placed on possible alternative etiology (eg, fracture or stroke). 
If additional evaluation reveals an unexplaine d new abnormality, neurologic examination(s), 
targeted to the abnormal domain, will be performed by an inves tigator or qualified personnel. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 73

SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
A step-wise approach for the proposed neur ological assessment pl an is provided in Table 4 . 
Table 4 Quarterly Neurological Assessments  
Domain Step 1: Interim Neurologic History 
and Targeted Neurological 
Examination Step 2: If Abnormal Response  
Vision  Diplopia or visual/visual field loss Perform visual field assessment 
Motor  Major motor weakness (eg, legs, arms) Test leg strength (hopping, foot tapping), 
finger tapping, pronator drift, and 
bilateral muscle stren gth 
Tactile sensation  Paresthesia, anesthesia in any domain 
(peripheral, cent ral) Pinprick test 
Coordination/Cerebellar  Clumsiness, difficulty with walking, 
writin g, or fine motor skills, etc. Finger-nose, heel-shin, heel-toe walk, 
writin g sample, draw a cloc k 
Speech  Dysarthria, expressive aphasia Naming objects, repeat multipart phrase, 
observe fo r dysarthria or aphasia 
Verbal comprehension  Agnosia, receptive aphasia Test to follow routine commands, 
eg, close e yes, touch fin ger to ea r 
Cognition/Behavior  New onset of difficulties with memory or 
thinking, important changes in behavior Recall 3 objects over 1 minute, serial 7s, 
proverbs; changes in activities of daily 
living over p rior 6 months 
Additionally, should there be any unexplained abnormal ne urological findings, the subject is to 
be urgently referred to a neurol ogist. The sites will immediately inform the sponsor of any such 
occurrences. If the neurologist confirms the pr esence of PML, appropriate actions, including 
discontinuation of investigational product, will be taken. Suspected  PML cases will be reviewed 
promptly by data monitoring committee (DMC) members with PML expertise and presented at 
the next scheduled DMC meeting(s). If PML is diagnosed, the treatment code will be unblinded 
and there will be an urgent meeting of the DMC.  A flow diagram of th e quarterly assessments 
and actions is presented in Figure 3 . Any concerns from the DMC will be promptly 
communicated to the sponsor, inve stigator, and trea ting neurologist.

It is important to note that a ssessments based on neurological  evaluations are collected and 
evaluated in a different manner than observed or volunteered AEs. Given these differences, no 
attempt will be made to reconcile any apparent  discrepancies between observed or volunteered 
AEs and data from neurological assessment collect ed from subjects. Inves tigators may determine 
if any finding on neurological testing constitute s an AE. Adverse event incidence rates will not 
be calculated from these neurological evaluation data but rather fro m the AE information 
recorded by the investigator. 
7.3.3.4 Adverse Event Collection 
At each study visit, subjects will be questione d in a general way to ascertain if AEs have 
occurred since the previous visit (eg, “Have you had any health problems since your last visit?”). 
Adverse events are collected from the time inform ed consent and/or assent is signed until the end 
of the defined safety follow-up period stated in Section 7.2.3 (See Section  8, Adverse and 
Serious Adverse Events Assessment). 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 75

SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
7.3.3.5 Vital Signs 
Vital signs will be measured at  the time points specified in Table 1 . Additional collection times 
or changes to collection times will  be permitted, as necessary to ensure appropriate collection of 
safety data. Vital signs include blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature. Vital 
signs should be recorded before la boratory blood samples are collected. 
Single measurements of sitting blood pressure  will be recorded at each time point. Blood 
pressure should be determined by cuff with the subject’s arm supported at the level of the heart 
and recorded to the nearest mmHg using th e same method, the same  arm (preferably the 
dominant arm), and the same position throughou t the study. 
Respiratory rate will be measured with the subject in a comfortable position. The observer 
should hold the extremity of the su bject as a distraction for the patient (ie, pretending he/she is 
taking the subject’s radial pulse) and count the respira tion for 1 minute. 
Body temperature should be taken using a ther mometer and reported in degrees Celsius or 
Fahrenheit. 
Any deviations from baselin e (Visit 1) vital signs that are deemed clinically significant in the 
opinion of the investigator are to be recorded  as an AE unless documented in the subject’s 
medical history as a pre- existing medical condition. 
7.3.3.6 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
All clinical laboratory assays will be performed  according to the central laboratory’s normal 
procedures. Reference ranges are to be supplied by the central laboratory and will be used to 
assess the clinical laboratory data for clinical significance and out-of-rang e pathological changes. 
Clinical laboratory assays can also be performed by the local laboratory in case of issues related 
to COVID-19 (or other similar pandemic) and if deemed necessary by the investigator to confirm 
the subject’s safety. In such a case, the inves tigative site must obtai n the local laboratory’s 
normal ranges as well as a CLIA  (Clinical Laboratory Improvem ent Amendments) certificate, 
and the investigator must add the local laboratory  as appropriate. The investigator should assess 
out-of-range clinical laboratory values for clinical  significance, indicating if the value(s) is/are 
not clinically significant or clin ically significant. Abnor mal clinical laborato ry values that are 
unexpected or not explained by the subject’s clin ical condition may, at the discretion of the 
investigator or sponsor, be repe ated as soon as possible until confirmed, explained, or resolved.

Diagnosis of C. difficile  infection should be made using the central laboratory. If, for any reason, 
the central laboratory is not available, please see Appendix 4 for guidance regarding diagnostic 
algorithms. When a subject experiences an incr ease in GI symptoms, which could be an 
exacerbation of disease, an infectious etio logy must be evaluated including testing for C. difficile 
as described in Appendix 4. 
Subjects performing home administrations consecutively for 3 months will need to perform liver 
function testing per FDA requireme nt. It may be done locally if it is not possi ble to collect 
samples at the central laboratory. 
7.3.3.7 Pregnancy Test and Follicle-stimulating Hormone Test 
A urine beta–human chorionic gonadotropin ( β–hCG) pregnancy test will be performed on all 
females of childbearing potential at the time points specified in Table 1 ; if pregnancy is 
suspected; or on withdrawal of the subject from the study. 
Pregnancy tests are not required for females of nonchildbearin g potential who have undergone 
hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, have medically confirmed ovarian failure, or are 
medically confirmed postmenopausal (cessation of  regular menses for at least 12 consecutive 
months with no alternative pat hological or physiologi cal cause; postmenopausal  status should be 
confirmed by FSH testing in females who have  had 12 consecutive months of spontaneous 
amenorrhea and are 51 years of age or older) . This does not need to be performed if 
postmenopausal status was confirmed by FSH in induction study SHP647-301 or SHP647-302. 
If a female subject’s status has changed to  postmenopausal since the induction studies 
(SHP647-301 or SHP647-302), the childbearing potential of the subj ect must be re-established 
and documented (FSH confirmation test) at base line (Visit 1) of SHP647-303. Once FSH results 
are received, and if postmenopausal status is uncertain, the routine pregnancy testing will 
continue as planned for the re mainder of the study. If postme nopausal status is confirmed, 
routine pregnancy testing is no longer required. 
7.3.3.8 Electrocardiogram 
A 12-lead ECG will be recorded at the time points specified in Table 1 . When timings of 
measurements coincide, ECGs should be performed before laboratory blood collection. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 78 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
A central ECG reader will be used in this study. The eligibility of the subject is based on the 
assessment of the ECG by the investigator. If abnormal results are observed following 
assessment by the central reader, the investigator, in consultation with the appointed sponsor or 
contract research organization ( CRO) medical monitor, reconfirms subject eligibility to continue. 
7.3.3.9 Antidrug Antibodies 
Blood samples for measurement of antidrug an tibodies (ADAs) and neutralizing antibodies 
(NAbs) will be collected at th e time points specified in Table 1 . Blood samples must be collected 
before the administration of investigational product at that visit. 
7.3.3.10 Monitoring for Type I and Type III Immune Reactions 
Subjects will be educated on the signs and symp toms of hypersensitivity  reactions and how to 
respond to them. In addition, subjects will be inst ructed to report hypersensitivity AEs to the 
investigator at the time of occurrence, and to seek immediate medical care if hypersensitivity 
develops. At each visit, the subject will be queried  for adverse events of special interest (AESIs) 
related to hypersensitivity. Subjects will be also instructed to report AEs su ch as serum sickness, va sculitis, Arthus reaction, 
and severe injection-related react ions to the investigator, and to  seek immediate medical care if 
these events are severe in intensity. Subjects who experience a hypersensitivity reacti on or severe or serious injection-related 
reaction (eg, shortness of breath, wheezing, stridor, angioedema, li fe-threatening change in vital 
signs) should discontinue investigational produc t until the adjudication committee assess the case 
and finalize recommendation of pe rmanent discontinuation or rech allenge with investigational 
product. Subjects who experience an AE suggestive of the presence of circulating immune complexes 
formation (eg, fever, rash [inc luding hives], arthralgia, myalgi a, vasculitis, Arthus reaction, 
general ill feeling, itchin g, and swollen lymph nodes) will have the related AEs reviewed by the 
adjudication committee and if the AEs are assessed  as related to formation of circulating of 
immune complexes and not related to underlying disease, blood samples will be collected and 
stored at the central laboratory. Tests will be performed as confirmatory of presence of circulating immune complexes at the re quest of the adjudication committee. 
Further details of hypersens itivity reactions as AESIs are provided in Section 8.1.3.1.

7.3.3.11 Evaluation of Increased Gastrointestinal Symptoms 
When a subject experiences an increase in GI  symptoms, which could be an exacerbation of 
disease, an infectious etiology must  be evaluated incl uding testing for C. difficile as described in 
Appendix 4. If the subject has undergone or is u ndergoing a glucocorticoid taper, the 
glucocorticoid dose should be increased to the pre-taper dose; when clinically stable, the taper 
may begin again per Table 3 . 
Subjects should be assessed for possible treatme nt failure no earlier than the Week 4 scheduled 
visit. If treatment failure is considered after in fectious etiology has been ruled out or treated, 
and/or after increase in the glucocorticoid dose (if appropria te), then the procedures in 
Section 4.5.1.1 should be followed. 
In each case, the appropriate AE (eg, infection, ex acerbation) should be reco rded in the subject’s 
source document.

The amount of blood to be drawn for each assessme nt is an estimate. The amount of blood to be 
drawn may vary according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer or laboratory for an 
individual assessment; however, the total volume drawn over the course of the study should be 
approximately 47 mL. When more than 1 blood assessment is to be  done at the time point/period, 
if they require the same type of t ube, the assessments may be combined.

8. ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE  EVENTS ASSESSMENT 
8.1 Definition of Adverse Events, Period of Observation, Recording of Adverse Events 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whethe r or not related to the medici nal (investigational) product 
(International Council for Harmoni sation [ICH] Guidance E2A 1995). 
All AEs are collected from the time the informed consent and/or  assent is signed until the end of 
the defined safety follow- up period stated in Section 7.2.3. Where possible, a diagnosis rather 
than a list of symptoms should be recorded. Resolved AEs considered to be significant by the 
investigator that occurred in induction studies SHP647-301 or SHP647-302 will be captured as 
part of the SHP647-303 baseline medical hist ory, while ongoing AEs from Studies SHP647-301 
or SHP647-302 will be captured as AEs in SHP647-303 and followed throughout the 
SHP647-303 study. If a diagnosis has not been made, then each symptom should be listed 
individually. All AEs should be captured in th e subject’s source documents. In addition to 
untoward AEs, unexpected benefits outside the in vestigational product indication should also be 
captured in the subject’s source document. 
All AEs must be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returned to his/her baseline status 
or all variables have returned to normal), regardle ss of whether the subject is still participating in 
the study. Closure indicates that an outcome is re ached, stabilization achie ved (the investigator 
does not expect any further improve ment or worsening of the even t), or the event is otherwise 
explained. When appropriate, medical tests and ex aminations are performed so that resolution of 
event(s) can be documented. 
8.1.1 Severity Categorization 
The severity of AEs must be recorded during the course of the event including the start and stop 
dates for each change in severity. An event that changes in severity should be captured as a new 
event. Worsening of pretreatment  events, after initiation of investiga tional product, must be 
recorded as new AEs (for example, if a subject experiences mild intermit tent dyspepsia before 
dosing of investigational product, but the dyspepsia  becomes severe and more  frequent after first 
dose of investigational product has been administ ered, a new AE of severe dyspepsia [with the 
appropriate date of onset] is recorded  in the subject’s source document). 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 82 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
The medical assessment of severity is de termined by using the following definitions: 
Mild: A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does  not generally interfere with usual 
activities of daily living. 
Moderate: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with specific therap eutic intervention. The 
event interferes with usual activities of  daily living, causing discomfort but poses 
no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject. 
Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activiti es of daily living, or significantly affects 
clinical status, or ma y require intensive therapeutic intervention. 
8.1.2 Relationship Categorization 
A physician/investigator must make  the assessment of relationship to inves tigational product for 
each AE. The investigator should decide whether,  in his or her medical judgment, there is a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product. If 
there is no valid reason for suggest ing a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not 
related.” Otherwise, if there is any valid reas on, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting 
a possible cause-and-effect rela tionship between the investigat ional product and the occurrence 
of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related.” The causality assessment must be 
documented in the source document. 
The following additional gui dance may be helpful: 
Term Relationship Definition 
Related The temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the 
investigational product is compelling and/or follows a known or suspected response 
pattern to that product, and the event cannot be explained by the subject’s medical condition, other ther apies, or accident. 
Not Related The event can be readily explained by other factors such as the subject’s underlying 
medical condition, concomitant therapy, or accident and no plausible temporal or biologic relationship exists between the investigational product and the event. 
8.1.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Adverse events of special interest will be cap tured and monitored during this study. Investigators 
will report all AESIs to the sponsor, regardless of causality, using th e same timelines as 
described for SAE reporting (see Section 8.2.2). The following describe the AESIs and the 
criteria for reporting AESIs. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 83 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
8.1.3.1 Hypersensitivity 
Potential hypersensitivity, serum sickness, vasc ulitis, and Arthus reac tions to ontamalimab will 
be regarded as AESIs. These events must be reported on Shire “Clinical Study SAE and 
Nonserious AE as Required by the Protocol Form” and within the time frame mandated for 
SAEs (see Section 8.2.2 ). 
It is well known that the administration of foreign proteins can cause immune responses 
including hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis and serum sickness. Other immune 
responses to foreign proteins include  the development of ADAs and NAbs. 
Monoclonal antibodies have been used in hum an therapeutics since the 1980s. The first 
monoclonal antibody approved for human use (O RTHOCLONE  OKT3®), was a murine protein 
which caused rapid production of NAbs. Since th en, much effort has been expended to reduce 
the immunogenicity of these usef ul therapeutic proteins by reduc ing the extent of “foreignness” 
from chimeric antibodies such as  infliximab, to humanized antibodi es such as vedolizumab, and 
finally to fully human antibodies such as adalimumab and ontamalimab ( Isabwe et al., 2018 ) (see 
Figure 4 ). 
Figure 4 Potential Immunogenicity of Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies 
 
Ontamalimab is a fully human antibody of th e immunoglobulin G2 subclass. In Phase 1 and 
Phase 2 clinical trials of ontam alimab, in which over 700 subjects we re treated for up to 3 years, 
there has been no case of anaphylaxis. Ther e have been 2 reported cases of drug 
hypersensitivity: serum sickness attributed to co ncomitant administration of penicillin; and a 
reaction characterized by dyspnea, facial erythe ma, and chest pain with onset 2 days after 
administration of the fifth dose of ontamalimab. The latter even t mimicked a reaction that the 
subject had previously e xperienced after 4 doses of infliximab. In addition, low titer activity has 
been observed in ADA assays, including pretreatme nt samples and placebo- treated subjects, and 
no subject has had a 2-fold or greater increas e in ADA titer. Analysis of PK and clinical 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 84 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
parameters has shown no differe nce between subjects whose ADA a ssays results are positive as 
compared with those whose are negative. 
Nonetheless the possibility of a hypersensitivity  reaction occurring after drug exposure cannot be 
fully ruled out. The reactions of concern ar e Type I (anaphylaxis) and Type III (immune 
complex) reactions. The clinical presentation of anaphylactic reacti ons is described in Table 6 . 
Table 6 Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis (Type I Hypersensitivity) 
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when below criterion and at least any one of the following criteria a and b are 
fulfilled : 
Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) w ith involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both 
(eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula) 
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING 
a) Respiratory compromise (eg, dys pnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia) 
b) Reduced BPa or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence) 
BP=blood pressure; PEF=peak expiratory flow 
a Low systolic BP for children is defined as less than 90 mmHg from 11 to 17 years. 
Source: Adapted from Sampson et al., 2006 . 
Type III hypersensitivity responses, including th ose mediated by immune complexes and T cells 
(delayed hypersensitivity responses in the older literature), are relatively rare with respect to 
therapeutic protein products and a high degree of clinical suspici on is necessary for the diagnosis 
(Center for Drug Evaluation and Research – Guidance for industry: Immunogenicity assessment 
for therapeutic protein products, 2014). Type III hypersensitivity reactions involve the formation 
of biologic/ADA immune complexes in the circ ulation which, when pr esent in the correct 
stoichiometric ratio, become deposited in ti ssues. Once immune complexe s are deposited, they 
can elicit complement activation and inflam mation, leading to tissue damage. When immune 
complexes are deposited in tissues, they tend to  localize in small postcapillary venules where 
there is loss of laminar blood flow , in sites of ultrafiltration wh ere there is high pressure and 
fenestrated endothelium (eg, chor oid plexus, ciliary body, synovium, and glomeruli), in sites of 
turbulent blood flow (eg, coronary  artery branches off aorta, ao rtic bifurcations, and cardiac 
valve leaflets), and in re nal glomerular endothelium. 
Signs and symptoms of immune complex deposit ion typically have onset  1 to 3 weeks after 
exposure ( Warrington et al., 2018 ) usually improving in 7 to 10 days, with full recovery in 2 to 
4 weeks and may include fever, rash (including hi ves), arthralgia, myalgia, vasculitis, Arthus 
reaction, general ill feeling, itching, and swollen lymph nodes. Some of these findings, such as 
fever, rash, arthralgia, and myal gia are consistent with findings  associated with IBD and may 
therefore be very difficult to assign to a partic ular etiology. When such a reaction is suspected, 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 85 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
samples for laboratory assessment will be obtained and stored. Tests will be performed if the 
diagnosis is confirmed and request ed by the adjudication committee. 
8.1.4 Outcome Categorization 
The outcome of AEs must be recorded during th e course of the study in  the source document. 
Outcomes are as follows: 
• Fatal 
• Not Recovered/Not Resolved 
• Recovered/Resolved 
• Recovered/Resolved With Sequelae 
• Recovering/Resolving 
• Unknown. 
8.1.5 Symptoms of the Disease Under Study 
Symptoms of the disease under study should not be cl assed as AEs as long as they are within the 
normal day-to-day fluctuation or expected progre ssion of the disease and ar e part of the efficacy 
data to be collected in the study; however, sign ificant worsening of th e symptoms should be 
recorded as an AE.  
8.1.6 Clinical Laboratory and Other Safety Evaluations 
A change in the value of a clinical laboratory, vital sign, or ECG assessment can represent an AE 
if the change is clinically relevant or if, during treatment with the investig ational product, a shift 
of a parameter is observed from a normal value to an abnormal valu e, or a further worsening of 
an already abnormal value. When evaluating such  changes, the extent of deviation from the 
reference range, the duration until return to the re ference range, either while continuing treatment 
or after the end of treatment w ith the investigational product, a nd the range of variation of the 
respective parameter within its reference ra nge, must be taken in to consideration. 
If, at the end of the treatmen t phase, there are abnormal clini cal laboratory, vital sign, or 
ECG values which were not present at the pretr eatment value observed closest to the start of 
study treatment, further investigations should be pe rformed until the values return to within the 
reference range or until a plau sible explanation (eg, concomit ant disease) is found for the 
abnormal values. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 86 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
The investigator should decide , based on the above criteria a nd the clinical condition of a 
subject, whether a change in a clinical labora tory, vital sign, or ECG pa rameter is clinically 
significant and therefore represents an AE. 
8.1.7 Pregnancy 
All pregnancies are to be reported from the time in formed consent is signed until the end of the 
defined safety follow-up period stated in Section 7.2.3. 
Any report of pregnancy for any female study pa rticipant or the part ner of a male study 
participant must be reported wi thin 24 hours to the Shire Global  Drug Safety Department using 
the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products  Pregnancy Report Form . A copy of the Shire 
Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form (and any applicable follow-up 
reports) must also be sent to the CRO/Shire medical monitor using the details specified in the 
emergency contact information se ction of the protocol. The pre gnant female study participant 
must be withdrawn from the study. 
Every effort should be made to gather info rmation regarding the pregnancy outcome and 
condition of the infant. It is the re sponsibility of the investigator to obtain this in formation within 
30 calendar days after the initia l notification and approximately 30 calendar days postpartum. If 
the pregnancy outcome is a live birth, the vital st atus and clinical conditi on of the infant should 
be obtained and documented at 1 year postpartum. 
Pregnancy complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congenital abnormality 
are considered SAEs and must be reported us ing the Shire “Clinical Study Serious Adverse 
Event and Nonserious AE as Required by the Prot ocol Form.” Note: An elective abortion is not 
considered an SAE. In addition to the above, if the investigator dete rmines that the pregnanc y meets serious criteria, 
it must be reported as an SAE using the Sh ire “Clinical Study Serious Adverse Event and 
Nonserious AE as Required by th e Protocol Form” as well as the Shire Investigational and 
Marketed Products Pregnancy Re port Form. The test date of the first positive serum/urine β-hCG 
test or ultrasound result will dete rmine the pregnancy onset date. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 87

SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
8.1.8 Abuse, Misuse, Overdose, and Medication Error 
Abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication error (as defined below) must be reported to the sponsor 
according to the SAE reporting procedure whether or not they result in an AE/SAE as described 
in Section 8.2. Note: The 24-hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply to reports of 
abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors unless these result in an SAE. 
The categories below are not mutually exclusive;  the event can meet mo re than 1 category. 
• Abuse  – Persistent or sporadic intentional intake of investigational product when 
used for a nonmedical purpos e (eg, to alter one’s state of  consciousness or get high) 
in a manner that may be detrimental  to the individual and/or society 
• Misuse – Intentional use of inves tigational product other than as directed or indicated 
at any dose (Note: this incl udes a situation where the inve stigational product is not 
used as directed at the dose prescribed by the protocol) 
• Overdose – Intentional or uninten tional administration of in vestigational product at a 
dose interval that is less than 2 weeks between doses 
• Medication Error  – An error made in prescribing, dispensing, administration, and/or 
use of an investigational product. For studi es, medication errors are reportable to the 
sponsor only as defined below. 
Cases of subjects missing doses of the investig ational product are not c onsidered reportable as 
medication errors. 
Medication errors should be collected/repor ted for all products under investigation. 
The administration and/or use of the unassigned treatment is/a re always reportable as a 
medication error. The administration and/or use of  an expired investig ational product should be considered as a 
reportable medication error. There is no specific antidote for overdose with ontamalimab. Tr eatment should be symptomatic 
and supportive.

8.1.9 Unexpected Adverse Event 
An unexpected AE is an AE whose nature, severit y, specificity, or outcome is not consistent with 
the term, representation, or desc ription used in the referen ce safety information (RSI). 
“Unexpected” also refers to the AEs that are men tioned in the IB as occurring with a class of 
drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacolo gical properties of the product, but are not 
specifically mentioned as occu rring with the particular product under investigation. 
The expectedness of AEs will be determined by the sponsor using the IB as the RSI. This 
determination will include considerations such as the number of AEs previously observed, but 
not on the basis of what might be anticipated from the pharmaco logical properties of a product. 
8.1.10 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction 
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) is defined as any suspected adverse 
reaction to study treatment (ie, including active comparators) th at is both serious and unexpected. 
The event(s) must meet all of the following: 
• Suspected adverse reaction 
• Serious 
• Unexpected 
• Assessed as related to study treatment. 
8.2 Serious Adverse Event Procedures 
8.2.1 Reference Safety Information 
The reference for safety information for this study is Section 6.8  of the ontamalimab IB, which 
the sponsor has provided under separate cover to all investigators. 
8.2.2 Reporting Procedures 
All initial and follow-up SAE repor ts must be reported by the i nvestigator to the Shire Global 
Drug Safety Department and th e CRO/Shire medical monitor w ithin 24 hours of the first 
awareness of the event. Note: The 24-hour repo rting requirement for SAEs does not apply to 
reports of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors (see Section 8.1.8 ) unless they result in 
an SAE. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 89 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
The investigator must complete, sign, and date  the Shire “Clinical Study Serious Adverse Event 
and Nonserious AE as Required by the Protoc ol Form” and verify the accuracy of the 
information recorded on the form with the corresponding source documents (Note: Source 
documents are not to be sent unless requested) and fax or ema il the form to the Shire Global 
Drug Safety Department. A c opy of the Shire “Clinical St udy Serious Adverse Event and 
Nonserious AE as Required by the Protocol Fo rm” (and any applicable follow-up reports) must 
also be sent to the CRO/Shire medical monito r using the details specified in the emergency 
contact information section of the protocol. 
8.2.3 Serious Adverse Event Definition 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be related to investigational 
product or not) that at any dose: 
• Results in death. 
• Is life-threatening. 
Note: The term “life-threatening” in the defi nition of “serious” re fers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at th e time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of exis ting hospitalization. 
Note: Hospitalizations, which are the resu lt of elective or previously scheduled 
surgery for pre-existing conditions, which have not worsened after initiation of 
treatment, should not be classified as SAEs. For example, an admission for a 
previously scheduled ventral hernia repair would not be  classified as an SAE; 
however, complication(s) re sulting from a hospitaliza tion for an elective or 
previously scheduled surgery that meet(s) se rious criteria must be  reported as SAE(s). 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. 
• Is a congenital abnormality/birth defect. 
• Is an important medical event. Note: Important medical events  that may not result in d eath, be life-threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize th e subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this  definition. Examples 
of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring in tensive treatment in 
an emergency department or at home; bl ood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not

result in inpatient hospitalization; or th e development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse. 
8.2.4 Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame 
All SAEs (regardless of relations hip to study) are collected from  the time the subject signs the 
informed consent until the defined safety  follow-up period stated in Section 7.2.3 and must be 
reported to the Shire Global Drug Safety Department and the CRO/Shire medical monitor within 
24 hours of the first awareness of the event. 
In addition, any SAE(s) considered “related” to the investigati onal product and discovered by the 
investigator at any interval af ter the study has completed must be  reported to the Shire Global 
Drug Safety Department within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event. 
8.2.5 Serious Adverse Event Onset and Resolution Dates 
The onset date of the SAE is defined as the date the event meets serious criteria. The resolution 
date is the date the event no longer meets serious criteria, the date the symptoms resolve, or the 
date the event is considered chronic. In the ca se of hospitalizations, the hospital admission and 
discharge dates are considered the onse t and resolution dates, respectively. 
In addition, any signs or symptoms experienced by the subject after signi ng the informed consent 
form, or leading up to the onset date of the SAE,  or following the resolution date of the SAE, 
must be recorded as an AE, if appropriate. 
8.2.6 Fatal Outcome 
Any SAE that results in the subject ’s death (ie, the SAE was noted as the primary cause of death) 
must have fatal checked as an out come with the date of death reco rded as the resolution date. For 
all other events ongoing at the time  of death that did not contri bute to the subject’s death, the 
outcome should be considered not resolv ed, without a resolution date recorded. 
For any SAE that results in the subject’s death or  any ongoing events at the time of death, unless 
another investigational product action was previously taken (eg, drug interrupted, reduced, 
withdrawn), the action taken with  the investigational product shoul d be recorded as “dose not 
changed” or “not applicable” (if the subject never received investigational product). The 
investigational product action of “withdrawn” should not be select ed solely as a result of the 
subject’s death.

8.2.7 Regulatory Agency, Institutional Review  Board, Ethics Committee, and Site 
Reporting 
The sponsor or the CRO  is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities , 
US central institutional review boards (IRBs),  and European Union (EU) central ethics 
committees (ECs) of related, une xpected SAEs (ie, SUSARs). 
In addition, the CRO is responsible for notifying active sites of all related, unexpected SAEs 
(ie, SUSARs) occurring during all interventional studies acro ss the ontamalimab program. 
The investigator is responsibl e for notifying the local IRB, lo cal EC, or the relevant local 
regulatory authority of all SAEs that occur at his or  her site as required. 
8.2.8 Safety Monitoring for Potential Ca ses of Drug-induced Liver Injury 
The following safety monitoring and stopping crit eria are provided for elevated hepatic blood 
tests based on normal and elevated baseline alan ine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin 
levels. 
Abnormal values in ALT concurrent with abnormal  elevations in total bi lirubin that meet the 
criteria outlined below in the absence of other ca uses of liver injury are considered potential 
cases of drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy ’s Law cases) and should always be considered 
important medical events. The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential case of drug- induced liver injury 
depends on the subject’s indivi dual baseline values and underlying conditions. Subjects who 
present with the following laboratory abnormalities per Table 7  should be evaluated further to 
definitively determine the etiology of the abnor mal laboratory values. The measurement(s) 
should be reconfirmed with another blood draw preferably within 48 to 72 hours of the initial 
finding of potential concern. Please refer to laboratory manual for further instructions. 
Guidance for Dosing Interruption:  Investigator-directed delays  in dosing due to abnormal 
laboratory findings or AEs should be discussed w ith the medical monitor to determine whether 
the subject should contin ue with the treatment.

9. DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL METHODS 
9.1 Data Collection 
The investigators’ authorized site personnel must  enter the information required by the protocol 
in the eCRF. A study monitor will visit each site  in accordance with the monitoring plan and 
review the eCRF data against the source data  for completeness and accuracy. Discrepancies 
between source data and data entered in the e CRF will be addressed by qualified site personnel. 
When a data discrepancy warrants correction, th e correction will be made by authorized site 
personnel. Data collection procedures will be discu ssed with the site at th e site initiation visit 
and/or at the investigator’s mee ting. It is expected that site personnel will complete the eCRF 
entry within approximately 3 busines s days of the subject’s visit. 
9.2 Clinical Data Management 
Data are to be entered into a clinical database as specified in the CRO’s  data management plan. 
Quality control and data validation procedures are applied to ensure the validity and accuracy of 
the clinical database. 
Data are to be reviewed and checked for om issions, errors, and values requiring further 
clarification using computerized and manual procedures. Data queri es requiring clarification are 
to be communicated to the site for resolution. On ly authorized personnel will make corrections to 
the clinical database, and all corrections are documente d in an auditable manner. 
9.3 Data Handling Considerations 
Prior to the unblinding described in Section 6.2.4 , data that may potentia lly unblind the treatment 
assignment (ie, investigationa l product serum concentrations, antibodies to investigational 
product, treatment allocation, and investigational product preparati on/accountability data) will be 
handled with special care duri ng the data cleaning and review process. These data will be 
handled in such a way that, before unblindi ng, any data that may unblind study team personnel 
will be presented as blinded information or otherwise will not be made available. If applicable, 
unblinded data may be made available to quality assurance representative s for the purposes of 
conducting independent drug audits.

SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
9.4 Statistical Analysis Process 
The study will be analyzed by the sponsor or its agent. 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide the statistical methods and definitions for the 
analysis of the efficacy and safety data, as we ll as describe the approaches to be taken for 
summarizing other study information such as su bject disposition, demogr aphics and baseline 
characteristics, investigationa l product exposure, and prior an d concomitant medications. The 
SAP will also include a description of how missi ng, unused and spurious data will be addressed. 
The SAP will be finalized before unblinding to preserve the integrity of the statistical analysis 
and study conclusions. 
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® Version 9.3 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, 
NC, US). 
Unless otherwise specified, summary tabulations will be presented by treatment group. All data 
listings will be sorted by treatment group, site, an d subject number, and will include the subject’s 
age, sex, and race. For categorical variables, the number and percenta ge of subjects within  each category (with a 
category for missing data as needed) of the parameter will be presented. For continuous 
variables, the number of subj ects, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum 
values will be presented. Note: The overall impact of COVID-19 (or othe r similar pande mic) on data analyses is unknown 
at the time of the writing of this amendment; details on changes to any analyses or any additional 
analyses to evaluate the imp act of COVID-19 (or other similar  pandemic) on the study objectives 
will be described in the SAP. 
9.5 Planned Interim Analysis, Adaptive Desi gn, Data Monitoring Committee, and 
Hypersensitivity Adjudication Committee 
There is no planned inter im analysis or adaptive  design in this study. 
An external DMC will be established to review  the overall safety of the study subjects on an 
ongoing basis. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 96 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
Until the time of unblinding, the DMC will be re sponsible for the ongoing monitoring of safety 
of subjects enrolled in the study according to the DMC charte r. Recommendations made by the 
DMC to alter the conduct of the study or to amend the protocol will be forwarded to Shire for 
review and for a final decision. Shire or its desi gnee will notify investigative sites and regulatory 
authorities as appropriate, of DMC recommendations (which may in clude summaries of 
aggregate analyses of endpoint events and of safety data that  are not endpoints). 
Further details regarding the DMC can be found in the DMC charter, which will be available 
before the administration of investigational produc t to any subject. Analyses of the data for DMC 
review will be conducted according to the DMC charter and the DMC SAP. Because no formal 
hypothesis testing for safety assessments is planned, multiplicity  concerns regarding repeated 
analyses are not applicable. 
An external hypersensitivity adj udication committee will be esta blished to review data from 
subjects who experience a suspected Type I or  Type III hypersensitivity reaction in order to 
confirm the nature and etiol ogy of the reaction, to determin e whether testing should be 
performed on stored blood samples, and to finalize recommenda tions of permanent 
discontinuation or rechallenge with investigational product. Further details regarding the 
adjudication committee can be found in the adjudication charter. 
9.6 Sample Size Calculation and Power Considerations 
The planned sample size for this maintenance study depends on enrol lment from the induction 
studies (SHP647-301 and SHP647-302). Assuming that 50% of subjects receiving ontamalimab 
induction treatments and 35% of subjects receiving placebo induction treatment in Studies SHP647-301 and SHP647-302 will have a c linical response at Week 12, an estimated 
696 subjects will be eligible to enter this ma intenance study: 296 subjects from ontamalimab 
25 mg induction treatment, 296 subjects from on tamalimab 75 mg induction treatment, and 
104 subjects from placebo induction treatment. Expect ed clinical response rates at Week 12 are 
based on observed rate s from the A7281009 study. 
This study is designed to have approximately 85% power for the primary endpoint to detect an 
individual pairwise treatment difference at a highly statistically pe rsuasive level (ie, a 
p-value ≤.001). However, an alpha of 0.05 (2-sided) will be used as the overall Type-I error rate 
for the purposes of demonstration of efficacy  in this study and declaring study success. The 
power will be reported for both Type-I error thresholds (0.05 and 0.001). 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 97 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
Graphical methods are used to control the global family-wise Type-I error rate (FWER) at the 
0.05 level (2-sided) for the comparisons of the 2 ontamal imab treatment groups with the 
respective placebo group based on induction ontamalimab dose. Alpha is split equally at the 0.025 level (2-sided) for each of the pairwise treatment comparisons. Therefore, the power 
analysis and sample size estimation was calculate d based on the chi-square test of proportions 
using nQuery Advisor Version 7.0 (Statistical Solutions Ltd, Cork, Ireland) for an individual 
ontamalimab dose compared with placebo. 
Power calculations are based on assuming a .025 (2 -sided) significance level for each pairwise 
treatment comparison; 296 subjec ts previously treated with 25  mg ontamalimab in induction 
(1:1 allocation ratio: 148 subj ects in 25 mg ontamalimab treatme nt group vs. 148 subjects in the 
placebo group) and 296 subjects treated with 75 mg ontamalimab in indu ction (1:1 allocation 
ratio: 148 subjects in the 75 mg ontamalimab tr eatment group vs. 148 subjects in the placebo 
group) were planned. These num bers would yield an approximately 98% power (85% for 
alpha = 0.001) to detect indivi dual pairwise treatment differ ence in the primary efficacy 
endpoint, remission at Week 52, of  23% (15% placebo versus 38% ontamalimab). Expected 
remission rates at Week 52 were based on obser ved rates from an analysis of Study A7281010, 
which was ongoing at the time of the origin al protocol and placebo remission rates from 
literature ( Feagan et al., 2013 ; Sandborn et al., 2017). No adjustment for missing data is required 
in these sample size calculations as subjects w ith missing data for remission at Week 52 are 
imputed as failures and the above rates account for these subjects. 
With the planned sample size of  296 subjects previously treate d with 25 mg in induction and 
296 subjects previously treated  with 75 mg in induction, Table 8  provides the power for 
detecting a treatment differen ce between ontamalimab treatmen t group and the placebo group for 
the key secondary endpoints.

With the early discontinuation of the study, the planned sample size of 696 subjects will not be 
attained as the final number of su bjects enrolled into this study is 366. Formal  statistical testing 
of the primary and key secondary endpoints will still be conducted de spite not reaching the 
planned sample size and power levels. 
9.7 Study Population 
The safety set will consist of all subjects who ha ve received at least 1 dose of investigational 
product in the SHP647-303 study, regardless of treatment received during the induction studies (SHP647-301 and SHP647-302). 
The ontamalimab responder full analysis set (FAS ) will consist of all su bjects in the randomized 
set who have received at least 1 dose of i nvestigational product in  the SHP647-303 study and 
who were previously treated with ontamalimab in the induction studies. 
The placebo responder FAS will consist of all subj ects in the randomized se t who have received 
at least 1 dose of investiga tional product in the SHP647-303 study and who were previously 
treated with placebo in the induction studies.

9.8 Efficacy Analyses 
Unless otherwise specified, all efficacy analyses will be ba sed on the ontamalimab responder 
FAS and subjects will be analyzed  according to their randomized treatment, regardless of the 
treatment they actually received. 
9.8.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint is remission at the Week 52 visit. Remission is defined as a 
composite score of patient-reported symptoms using daily e-diary and centrally read endoscopy 
as follows: 
• Stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1 with at least a 1-point change from induction 
(SHP647-301 or SHP647-302) baseline 
AND 
• Rectal bleeding subscore of 0 
AND 
• Endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (m odified, excludes  friability). 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be compared  for each active treatment group (25 mg or 
75 mg ontamalimab) to the corresponding place bo group (25 mg in induction placebo group or 
75 mg in induction placebo group; placebo group s are not pooled) using a Cochran-Mantel 
Haenszel (CMH) chi-square te st stratified by status of gl ucocorticoid use at SHP647-303 
baseline, prior anti-TNF treatment, and the degree  of clinical response in  the induction studies 
(whether remission is achieved or not). Subjects  with missing remission data at Week 52 will be 
considered failures and counted as nonres ponders. The endoscopy score will be based on 
centrally read results. 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be  tested by the following hypothesis: 
H0: δ = 0 
H1: δ ≠ 0 
Where δ is the common treatment difference across strata,  j=1 to m. The common treatment 
difference is a weighted average of th e stratum-specific treatment differences. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 100 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
The estimate of the common treatment differ ence along with the corresponding stratified 
Newcombe 95% confidence interval (C I) using the method of Yan and Su ( 2010) and CMH 
p-value will be presented for each active treatment group to placebo comparison. 
A sensitivity analysis will be performed on the subgroup of subjects that had the opportunity to 
complete 52 weeks of this study prior to the impleme ntation of Amendment 3 at their site. 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be summariz ed separately for the placebo responder FAS by 
treatment group without inferent ial methods. The number and per centage of subjects, and the 
estimate of the common treatment differen ce along with the corresponding unstratified 
Newcombe 95% CI, will be summarized by tr eatment group at Week 52. Subjects with missing 
data at Week 52 will be considered failures and counted as nonresponders. 
Adjustments for multiplicity 
The global FWER for the statistical tests of the primary and key secondary endpoints will be 
strongly controlled at .05 (2-sided). To control the FWER, graphical methods discussed in 
Bretz et al. ( 2009) will be utilized to propagate α from primary to key secondary endpoints and 
between the 2 ontamalimab treatment group and placebo comparisons. Alpha is initially split 
equally at the .025 level (2-sided) for each of the pairwise treatment comparisons for the primary 
endpoint (P) and alpha is propaga ted in a hierarchical manner to  each of the 7 key secondary 
endpoints (K1-K7) within a pairwise treatment comparison. A graphical visualization of the 
α propagation is presented in Figure 5 .

Only p-values that are significant according to this graphical approach  are inferential and 
statistically significant. All other p-values are descriptive. 
9.8.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
9.8.2.1 Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The key secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: 
• Endoscopic remission, as defined by centr ally read endoscopic subscore 0 or 
1 (modified, excludes friabil ity), at the Week 52 visit. 
• Clinical remission as defined by SF subscore of  0 or 1 with at least a 1-point change 
from induction study (SHP647-301 or SHP647-302) baseline in SF subscore, and 
RB subscore of 0, at the Week 52 visit. 
• Sustained remission, ie, in remission at  the SHP647-303 Week 52 visit, among 
subjects who were in remission at th e time of baseline in study SHP647-303. 
Remission is defined as a co mposite score of patient-re ported symptoms using daily 
e-diary and centrally read endoscopy, with SF subscore of 0 or 1 with at least a 
1-point change from induction study (SHP647-301 or SHP647-302) baseline, and 
RB subscore of 0, and endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified, excludes friability). 
• Clinical response based on composite scor e at the Week 52 visit. Clinical response 
(composite) is defined as a decrease  from induction study (SHP647-301 or 
SHP647-302) baseline in the composite scor e of subject-report ed symptoms using 
daily e-diary and centrally read endoscopy of  at least 2 points a nd at least 30%, with 
an accompanying decrease in the subscore for RB ≥1 point or a subscore for RB ≤1. 
• Mucosal healing, based on endoscopic and histologic assessment, at the Week 52 
visit. Mucosal healing is defined by centrally read endoscopic subscore 0 or 
1 (modified, excludes friability) a nd centrally read Geboes score of ≤2. 
• Glucocorticoid-free clinical remiss ion at Week 52, among subjects using 
glucocorticoids at induction study baseline. Glucocorticoid-free clinical remission is 
defined as clinical remission in additi on to not requiring any treatment with 
glucocorticoids for at least 4 weeks prior to the Week 52 visit. Clinical remission is 
defined as SF subscore of 0 or 1 with at  least a 1-point chan ge from induction study 
(SHP647-301 or SHP647-302) baseline in SF su bscore, and RB subscore of 0, at the 
Week 52 visit. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 103 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
• Glucocorticoid-free remission at Week 52, am ong subjects using glucocorticoids at 
induction study baseline. Gluc ocorticoid-free remission is defined as remission in 
addition to not requiring any treatment with glucocorticoids for at  least 4 weeks prior 
to the Week 52 visit. Remission is defined as a composite score of subject-reported 
symptoms using daily e-diary and endoscopy, wi th SF subscore of 0 or 1 with at least 
a 1-point change from induction study (SHP647-301 or SHP647-302) baseline, and RB subscore of 0, and endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified, excludes friability). 
Similar to the primary en dpoints, the key secondary efficacy endpoints will all be tested by the 
following hypothesis:
 
H0: δ = 0 
H1: δ ≠ 0 
The key secondary endpoints will be analyzed using the same approach as described for the 
primary endpoint. Subjects with missing key sec ondary endpoint data at the Week 52 visit will 
be considered failures an d counted as nonresponders. 
In addition, the same sensitivity an alysis as described for the prim ary endpoint will be repeated 
for the key secondary endpoints. The key second ary endpoints will be summarized separately for 
the placebo responder FAS by treatment group without  inferential methods as described for the 
primary endpoint. 
9.8.2.2 Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: 
• Remission defined as a total Mayo score of ≤2 with no individual subscore (SF, RB, 
endoscopy [modified, excludes friability], and PGA) exceeding 1, at Week 52. 
• Clinical remission over time with  both RB and SF subscores of 0. 
• Sustained endoscopic remission ie, in endoscopic remission at the SHP647-303 
Week 52 visit among subjects who were in re mission at the time of baseline in 
Study SHP647-303, as defined by a centrally read endoscopic subscore of 0 or 
1 (modified, excludes friability). 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 104 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints will be summari zed by descriptive statistics and presented by 
treatment group for the ontamalimab responder FAS. The other secondary endpoints will be 
analyzed using the same appro ach as described for the primar y endpoint. Subjects with missing 
other secondary endpoint data at a visit will be  considered failures and counted as nonresponders 
at that visit. The other seconda ry endpoints will be summariz ed separately for the placebo 
responder FAS by treatment group without inferent ial methods, as descri bed for the primary 
endpoint. 
9.9 Safety Analyses 
All safety analyses will be perform ed using the safety set. Subject s will be analyzed according to 
the treatment they actually received. 
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as AEs with start dates at the time of or following the first 
exposure to investigational pr oduct in the SHP647-303 study. The number of events, incidence, 
and percentage of TEAEs will be calculate d overall, by SOC, by preferred term, and by 
treatment group. Treatment-emergent AEs will be further summarized by severity and 
relationship to investigational pr oduct. Adverse events leading to  withdrawal, SAEs, and deaths 
will be similarly summarized or listed. Adverse even ts of special interest will be summarized by 
treatment group. Clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and EC G findings will be summarized by treatment group 
and visit. Potentially clinically important findings will also be summarized or listed. 
Antidrug antibody data will be summarized by treatment group and visit. Further details of safety analyses  will be described in the SAP.

SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
The investigator will maintain a list of appropriate ly qualified persons to whom the investigator 
has delegated significant study-related tasks, a nd shall, upon request of  the sponsor, provide 
documented evidence of any licenses and certif ications necessary to demonstrate such 
qualification. Curriculum vitae fo r investigators and subinvestigators are provided to the study 
sponsor (or designee) be fore starting the study. 
If a potential research subject has a primary ca re physician, the investig ator should, with the 
subject’s consent or subject’s le gally authorized representative ’s consent and/or assent, as 
applicable, inform them of the su bject’s participat ion in the study. 
A coordinating principal investigat or is appointed to review the final clinical study report for 
multicenter studies. Agr eement with the final clinical study report is documented by the signed 
and dated signature of the princi pal investigator (single-site study) or coordinating principal 
investigator (multicenter study), in compli ance with Directive 2001/83/EC as amended by 
Directive 2003/63/EC and ICH Guidance E3 (1995). 
10.2.2 Protocol Adherence and Investigator Agreement 
The investigator and any coinve stigators must adhere to the protocol as detailed in this 
document. The investigator is responsible fo r enrolling only those subjects who have met 
protocol eligibility criteria. I nvestigators are required to sign an investigator agreement to 
confirm acceptance and willingness to  comply with the study protocol. 
If the investigator suspends or te rminates the study at their site, the investigator will promptly 
inform the sponsor and the IRB/ EC and provide them with a de tailed written explanation. The 
investigator will also return al l investigational product, containe rs, and other study materials to 
the sponsor or designee. Upon study completion, the investigator  will provide the sponsor, 
IRB/EC, and regulatory agency w ith final reports and summaries as required by (inter)national 
regulations. 
Communication with local IRBs/ECs, to ensure a ccurate and timely info rmation is provided at 
all phases during the study, may be done by the sponsor, applicab le CRO, investigator, or for 
multicenter studies, the coordinating principal inve stigator according to national provisions and 
will be documented in the investigator agreement.

10.2.3 Documentation and Retention of Records 
10.2.3.1 Case Report Forms 
Case report forms are supplie d by the CRO and should be handled in accordance with 
instructions from the sponsor. 
The investigator is responsible for maintain ing adequate and accurate medical records from 
which accurate information is recorded in eCRF s, which have been designed to record all 
observations and other data pertinent to the clinical investigation. The e CRFs must be completed 
by the investigator or designee as stated in the site delegation log. 
All data in the eCRF will have a separate sour ce (eg, paper or electronic PRO); no data will be 
recorded directly in the eCRF. All data sent to the sponsor must  be endorsed by the investigator. 
The clinical research associate (CRA)/study monitor will verify the contents against the source 
data per the monitoring plan. If the data are unclear or contra dictory, queries are sent for 
corrections or verification of data. 10.2.3.2 Recording, Access, and Retention of Source Data and Study Documents 
Original source data to be reviewed during th is study will include but are not limited to the 
subject’s medical file, subject e- diary, original clinical laboratory reports, and histology and 
pathology reports. All key data must be recorded in  the subject’s medical records. 
The investigator must permit au thorized representatives of the sponsor; the respective national, 
local, or foreign regulatory author ities; the IRB/EC; and auditors to  inspect facilitie s and to have 
direct access to original s ource records relevant to this  study, regardless of media. 
The CRA/study monitor (and auditors, IRB/EC or  regulatory inspectors) may check the eCRF 
entries against the source documents. The consent form includes a statement by which the 
subject agrees to the monitor/auditor from the sp onsor or its representati ves, national or local 
regulatory authorities, or the IRB/EC, having acce ss to source data (eg, subject’s medical file, 
appointment books, original laboratory reports, x-rays etc). Nonstudy site personnel will not 
disclose any personal information or personal medical information. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 110 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
These records must be made av ailable within reasona ble times for inspecti on and duplication, if 
required, by a properly authorized representative of any regulato ry agency (eg, the US FDA, 
EMA, UK Medicines and Healthcare products  Regulatory Agency) or an auditor. 
Essential documents must be maintained accord ing to ICH GCP requirements and may not be 
destroyed without written pe rmission from the sponsor. 
Sites are to ensure that all study documents rela ted to DTP are complete, accurate, and retained 
at the site according to the document retention requirements. 
10.2.3.3 Audit/Inspection 
To ensure compliance with releva nt regulations, data generated by this study must be available 
for inspection upon request by representatives of, for example, the US FDA (as well as other 
US national and local regulatory authorities), the EMA, the Medi cines and Healthcare products 
Regulatory Agency, other regulato ry authorities, the sponsor or its representatives, and the 
IRB/EC for each site. 
10.2.3.4 Financial Disclosure 
The investigator is requ ired to disclose any financial arra ngement during the st udy and for 1 year 
after, whereby the outcome of th e study could be influenced by th e value of the compensation for 
conducting the study, or other payments the i nvestigator received from the sponsor. The 
following information is collected: any significant payments from the sponsor or subsidiaries 
such as a grant to fund ongoing re search, compensation in the form  of equipment, retainer for 
ongoing consultation or honoraria; any proprietary  interest in invest igational product; any 
significant equity interest in th e sponsor or subsidiaries as defined in 21 Code of Federal 
Regulations 54 2(b) (1998). 
10.3 Ethical Considerations 
10.3.1 Informed Consent 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to  obtain written informed  consent and/or assent  from 
all study subjects before any study-related proced ures. All consent documentation must be in 
accordance with applicable regulations and GCP. E ach subject or the subject ’s legally authorized 
representative, as applicable, is requested to sign and date the s ubject informed c onsent form or a 
certified translation if applicab le, after the subject has received  and read (or been read) the 
written subject information and re ceived an explanation of what the study involves, including but 
not limited to: the objectives, poten tial benefits and risk, inconveni ences, and the subject’s rights 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 111 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
and responsibilities. A copy of the informed consent documentation (i e, a complete set of subject 
information sheets and fully executed signature pages) must be given to the subject or the 
subject’s legally authorized repr esentative, as applicable. This document may require translation 
into the local language. Signed consent forms must  remain in each subject’s study file and must 
be available for verification at any time. 
The principal investigator provides the sponsor  with a copy of the c onsent form that was 
reviewed by the IRB/EC and received their fa vorable opinion/approval. A copy of the IRB/EC’s 
written favorable opinion/approva l of these documents must be provided to the sponsor before 
the start of the study unless it is  agreed to and documented (abiding by regulatory guidelines and 
national provisions) before study st art that another party (ie, sponsor or coordinating principal 
investigator) is responsible for this action. Addi tionally, if the IRB/EC requires modification of 
the sample subject inform ation and consent document provided by the sponsor, the 
documentation supporting this requirement  must be provided to the sponsor. 
10.3.2 Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee 
For sites outside the EU, it is th e responsibility of the investigator to submit this protocol, the 
informed consent document (approved by the spon sor or their designee), relevant supporting 
information and all types of subj ect recruitment information to the IRB/EC for review, and all 
must be approved befo re site initiation. 
The applicant for an EC opinion can be the sponso r or investigator for sites within the EU; for 
multicenter studies, the applicant can be the co ordinating principal inve stigator or sponsor, 
according to national provisions. Responsibility for coordinating with IRBs/ECs is defined in the inve stigator agreement. 
Before implementing changes in the study, the sponsor and the IRB/EC must approve any 
revisions of all informed consen t documents and amendments to the protocol unless there is a 
subject safety issue. Investigational product supplies wi ll not be released until the sponsor has received written 
IRB/EC approval of and copi es of revised documents. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 112 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
For sites outside the EU, the inve stigator is responsible for keeping the IRB/EC apprised of the 
progress of the study and of any ch anges made to the pr otocol, but in any ca se at least once a 
year; this can be done by the spons or or investigator for sites w ithin the EU, or for multicenter 
studies, it can be done by the coordinating prin cipal investigator, according to national 
provisions. The investigator mu st also keep the local IRB/EC  informed of any serious and 
significant AEs. 
10.4 Privacy and Confidentiality 
All US-based sites and laboratories or entiti es providing support for this study, must, where 
applicable, comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 
1996. A site that is not a covered entity as defined by HIPAA must pr ovide documentation of 
this fact to the sponsor or designee. 
The confidentiality of records that may be able  to identify subjects will be protected in 
accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines. After subjects have consented to  take part in the study, the spons or and/or its representatives 
reviews their medical records and data collected during the study. These records and data may, in 
addition, be reviewed by others including the following: indepe ndent auditors who validate the 
data on behalf of the sponsor; third parties w ith whom the sponsor ma y develop, register, or 
market ontamalimab; national or local regu latory authorities; and the IRB(s)/EC(s)  which gave 
approval for the study to proceed. The sponsor an d/or its representatives accessing the records 
and data will take all reasonable precautions in accord ance with applicable laws, regulations, and 
guidelines to maintain the confiden tiality of subjects’ identities. 
Subjects are assigned a unique iden tifying number; however, their in itials and date of birth may 
also be collected and used to a ssist the sponsor to verify the acc uracy of the data (eg, to confirm 
that laboratory results have been assigned to the correct subject). 
The results of studies – cont aining subjects’ unique identify ing number, relevant medical 
records, and possibly initials and dates of birth – will be recorded. They may be transferred to, 
and used in, other countries which may not afford the same level of protection that applies within 
the countries where this study is conducted. The purpose of any such tran sfer would include: to 
support regulatory submissions, to conduct new data analyses to publish or present the study 
results, or to answer questions aske d by regulatory or health authorities.

SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
10.5 Study Results/Publication Policy 
Shire will endeavor to publish the results of all qualifying, applicab le, and covered studies 
according to external guidelines in a timely manner regardless of whether the outcomes are 
perceived as positive, neutral, or negative. Additionally, Shire adheres to external guidelines (eg, Good Publication Practices 2) when form ing a publication steeri ng committee, which is 
done for large, multicenter Phase 2-4 and certain other studies as determined by Shire. The purpose of the publication steering committee is to act as a nonc ommercial body that advises or 
decides on dissemination of scientific study data in accordance with the scope of this policy. 
All publications relating to Shir e products or projects must un dergo appropriate technical and 
intellectual property review, with  Shire agreement to publish befo re release of information. The 
review is aimed at protecting the sponsor’s proprietary information existing either at the 
commencement of the study or generated duri ng the study. To the extent permitted by the 
publisher and copyright law, the pr incipal investigator will own (or share with other authors) the 
copyright on his/her publications. To  the extent that the principal i nvestigator has su ch sole, joint 
or shared rights, the principa l investigator grants the spons or a perpetual, irrevocable, 
royalty-free license to ma ke and distribute copies  of such publications. 
The term “publication” refers to any public disclosure including orig inal research articles, review 
articles, oral presentations, ab stracts and posters at medical c ongresses, journal supplements, 
letters to the editor, invited lectures, opi nion pieces, book chapters, electronic postings on 
medical/scientific websites, or other disclosure of the study results, in printed, electronic, oral or 
other form. 
Subject to the terms of the para graph below, the investigator sh all have the right to publish the 
study results, and any background information provided by the sponsor that is necessary to 
include in any publication of study results, or nece ssary for other scholars  to verify such study 
results. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no publ ication that incorporates the sponsor’s 
confidential information shall be  submitted for public ation without the spons or’s prior written 
agreement to publish and shall be given to the sponsor for review at least 60 days before 
submission for publication. If requested in writing by Shire, the inst itution and principal 
investigator shall withhold submission of such  publication for up to an additional 60 days to 
allow for filing of a patent application. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 114 
Ontamalimab 
SHP647-303 Protocol Amendment 3  17 Sep 2020 
 
If the study is part of a multicen ter study, the first publication of the study results shall be made 
by the sponsor in conjunction with the sponsor’s presentation of a joint,  multicenter publication 
of the compiled and analyzed study results. If such  a multicenter publication is not submitted to a 
journal for publication by the sponsor within an 18-month period after conclusion, abandonment, 
or termination of the study at al l sites, or afte r the sponsor conf irms there shall be no multicenter 
study publication of the study results , an investigator may individua lly publish the study results 
from the specific site in acco rdance with this section. The investigator must, however, 
acknowledge in the publication th e limitations of the single-s ite data being presented. 
Unless otherwise required by the journal in which the publication appears, or the forum in which 
it is made, authorship will comply  with the International Commit tee of Medical Journal Editors 
current standards. Participation as  an investigator does not confer  any rights to authorship of 
publications.

following either of th e algorithms shown in Figure A2  (using PCR for toxin), Figure A3 (using 
toxigenic culture) or Figure A4  (using toxigenic culture, follow ed by PCR). The rationale for the 
method in Figure A3 is that the majority of PCR tests are expected to be negative for toxin, thus 
obviating the need for the test at the central laboratory. The e xpected turnaround time at the 
central laboratory for a GDH card test  is expected to be shorter th an that for stool culture for 
C. difficile  at the local laboratory. The de tails of the sensitivity and specificity of these tests were 
reported by Khanna ( Khanna et al., 2017 ). 
When medically reasonable, treatment decisions should be deferred until an etiology has been 
determined. When this is not feasible, management of symptoms should be dictated by the 
clinical situation.

Treatment 
When medically reasonable, treatment decisions should be deferred until an etiology has been 
determined. When this is not feasible, management of symptoms should be dictated by the 
clinical situation. If management requires a prohibited treatment (eg, intravenous 
glucocorticoids for induction or maintenan ce studies) the subject should be withdrawn 
from treatment.  
If treatment has been deferred, once an etiology is determined (eg, C. difficile , disease 
exacerbation, Campylobacter), appropriate treatme nt should be promptly implemented without 
waiting for a scheduled visit. If th e etiology is determined to be C. difficile , treatment guidelines 
conforming to the current IDSA recommendations for C. difficile  infection ( McDonald et al., 
2018) or the recent expert review on C. difficile  infection in IBD ( Khanna et al., 2017 ) should be 
consulted. 
If C. difficile  infection was identified, clinical improve ment should be noted within about 5 days 
after the start of treatme nt. If improvement does no t occur, the etiology is  most likely an IBD 
flare secondary to C. difficile and treatment failure assessment should proceed per the protocol. 
Another possible explanati on is primary failure of C. difficile therapy which is unlikely. 
If an infectious e tiology other than C. difficile  is identified, it should be  managed as appropriate, 
with reference to current clinical guidelines ( Shane et al., 2017 ). 
If any infectious etiology is determined, the site  should contact the medica l monitor to make him 
or her aware of the diagnosis and to disc uss treatment and ongoi ng study participation.

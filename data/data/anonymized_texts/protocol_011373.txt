Study Rationale  
Patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) have a median overall survival (OS) of 
approximately 27 months. While OS has improved due  to the introduction of new therapeutic 
agents, drug resistance is an ongoing challenge in the treatment of patients with MBC. Most patients with MBC become resistant to standard ch emotherapeutic agents such as anthracyclines 
and taxanes or platinums; and while the development of hormonal therapies and anti-HER2 therapies have revolutionized treatment for pati ents with hormone receptor-positive and HER2-
positive breast cancer, patients with hormone re ceptor-negative/HER2-neg ative cancer (triple 
negative breast cancer, TNBC) are in need of more efficacious therapies.  
Mutations in the PI3K pathway are the second most common mutations in breast cancer, and are the most common activating mutations, found in as many as 26%-45% of breast cancers. Triple negative breast cancers demonstr ate higher levels of AKT activation, with consequent activation 
of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway downstream of AKT. Everolimus inhibits cytokine and growth-factor-dependent cell proliferation by inhibiting the mTOR pathway. Everolimus has shown significant anti-tumor activity, but since the PI3K-mTOR pathway is downstream of numerous other eff ectors known to play a role in cancer cell 
proliferation and/or survival, there is an increasing focus on the drug’s possibilities when combined with other anti-tumor therapies. Increased efficacy has been observed when everolimus is combined with many other drugs. Eribulin mesylate is a synthetic analog of halichondrin B, a natural product is olated from the marine sponge Halichondria okadai. It acts as 
a cancer therapeutic via a tubulin-based anti-mit otic mechanism, which leads to G2/M cell cycle 
arrest, disruption of mitotic spindles, and ultimately apoptotic cell death. It inhibits cell growth in 
a wide range of cancer cell lines and in patients with advanced solid tumors and MBC.  
Based on our preclinical findings, we hypothesi ze that the combination of everolimus and 
eribulin will have a synergistic effect and will  increase clinical activity in patients with 
metastatic TNBC. Previous studies of each of thes e drugs in MBC show acceptable toxicity, and 
we hypothesize that this drug combination could offer a novel approach to treat patients with 
metastatic TNBC who are resistant to anthracyclines and taxanes or platinums. 
Objectives 
The overall objective of this study is to conduct a phase I/Ib trial of everolimus plus eribulin in 
metastatic TNBC patients who progressed after ant hracyclines and/or taxanes or platinums. The 
trial will consist of a Phase I trial and with an extension to Phase Ib.  
Primary Objective for Phase I Study 
The primary objective of the Phase I portion of the study is to determine the safety and 
tolerability of everolimus and eribulin, and determine the recommended PhaseII dose (RP2D) of 
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 2 of 79the drug combination in patients with resistant metastatic TNBC. 
Primary Objective for Phase Ib Study 
The primary objective of the Phase Ib portion of the study is to evaluate the event-free survival 
(EFS) rate for patients with resistant metastatic TNBC  at the RP2D of everolimus and eribulin to 
determine if the drug combination is worthy of further study. 
Secondary Objectives for Phase Ib Study 
The secondary objectives of the Phase Ib portion of the study are to determine response rate, OS, 
toxicity, and pharmacokinetics (PK) for everolimus and eribulin in patients with resistant metastatic TNBC. 
A further secondary objective is to collect blood, skin punch biopsies, and tumor biopsies before 
and after treatment from all patients, and perfor m proteomic analysis to determine the level of 
inhibition of the PI3K pathway in tumor cells versus non-therapeutic targets.  
Study Design 
This is a Phase I/Ib trial of everolimus plus eribulin in metastatic TNBC patients who are 
resistant to anthracyclines and taxanes or platinums.
Phase I Study 
The Phase I portion of the trial will use the toxicity equivalence range (TEQR) design. Based on 
this design, the target equivalence range for  dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) is 0.20-0.35. 
Toxicity levels of ≥0.51 will be considered too toxic, and doses which achieve this level will be 
stopped. Patients will enter the protocol in cohorts of three. This phase will be considered 
complete when 12 patients are studied at a single dose level with a toxicity level <0.51. The RP2D will be the dose closest to the target of 0.25 below 0.51 based on isotonic regression. Based on these requirements, the TEQR design will use a minimum of 6 patients and a maximum of 24 patients (median of 18) to determine the RP2D.
The PMT team for protocol 14036 reviewed the data: dose level 2 was closed after 2 of 3 
evaluable participants experienced DLTs at an observed rate of 67%; for dose level 1, we saw 4 DLTs in 8 evaluable participants giving an observed DLT rate of 50% on this dose.  Our equivalence range for DLT rate for this trial is 20-35%, our observed rate  of 50% is above 35% 
so we plan to de-escalate. Two participants experienced grade 4 neutrophil count decrease and 
2 experienced mucositis (1 grade 3 DLT, 1 participant received 71% of Everolimus due to grade 
2 which is a DLT). Thus, the team decided to amend the protocol to allow for two new dose 
levels at a lower dose of Eribulin, and start the next cohort of patients at dose level B1. 
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 3 of 79Dosing Schedule: cycle length is 21 days 
Dose level A Everolimus (oral) Eribulin (intravenous)
A-1 2.5mg daily (day 1 to 21) 1.4mg/m2on days 1, 8
A1 5mg daily (day 1 to 21) 1.4mg/m2on days 1,8
A2 7.5mg daily (day 1 to 21) 1.4mg/m2on days 1,8
A3 10mg daily (day 1 to 21) 1.4mg/m2on days 1, 8
Dose level B Everolimus (oral) Eribulin (intravenous)
B1 5mg daily (day 1 to 21) 1.1mg/m2on days 1,8
B-1 2.5mg daily (day 1 to 21) 1.1mg/m2on days 1,8
Phase Ib Study 
In the Phase Ib portion of the trial, a Simon’s Optimal two -stage design will be used to determine 
if the combination of everolimus and eribulin results in a greater rate of patients who are event-
free at 4 months than with eribulin alone. Based on data from the EMBRACE trial, we set the 4-month EFS rate for eribulin at 45%. We want to determine if the drug combination has a 4-
month EFS rate of ≥70% (25% improvement). Setting both the type I and type II errors to 0.1 
after 12 patients (from the RP2D at the end of the phase I tri al), if ≤5 patients are event -free at 4 
months, the study will stop accrual. If ≥6 patients are event -free at 4 months we will enroll 15 
more patients for a total of 27 patients at the RP2D. If ≥16 patients out of the 27 are event -free at 
4 months we will consider the combination worthy of further study. 
The rationale for calling this a Phase Ib trial is th at this trial is a large combination Phase I trial 
that will indicate if there is some activity of the drug combination, but it will not provide the 
activity information that a randomized Phase II trial would provide. Nonetheless, it still will provide information about whether the drug combination should be studied further. 
Study Endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoints of the study are:  
xPhase I: DLT. 
xPhase IB: EFS at 4 months. 
Secondary Endpoints 
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 4 of 79The secondary endpoints are: 
xPhase Ib: Response rate, PFS, OS, toxicity profile and PK parameters 
Sample Size and Accrual Rate 
The expected combined sample size for the Phase I/Ib trial will be 33. We anticipate 18 study 
participants for Phase I portion, and 15 additional at the RP2D to finish out the Phase II portion of the trial (minimum sample size=6 and maximum =45 (Phase I: 24 + Phase II: 15 + 6 for unevaluable/ineligible patients  over the whole trial)).   
At the time of adding schedule B, 14 participants had been treated of which 12 are evaluable for 
dose escalation.  With the addition of 2 more doses we  expect to treat 12 to 15 more patients  for 
a total of ~29 on the phase I portion of the trial, thus we expect the trial sample size to stay 
within the above planned limit of 45.  
Our accrual is just over 1 participant a month so  the phase I portion should be completed after 2 
years from start of the trial. We will need to follow the last patient for 4 months to get EFS at 4 
months on the 12 patients studied at the RP2D, and expect to do the initial assessment of activity at approximately 2 1/2 years. If 6 or more of the patients studied at the RP2D are event free we 
will add on 15 additional patients. Based on th e same accrual rate we should complete the 
accrual of the Phase Ib portion within approximately 12 months or at  42 months after start of the 
study.

IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 5 of 79Exclusion Criteria
Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents; patients received chemotherapy 
and/radiation therapy within 2 weeks from study entry; patients with symptomatic brain metastases; uncontrolled current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection 
(>Grade 2), symptomatic congestive heart failur e, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial 
infarction within the past 6 months, cardiac ve ntricular arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic 
therapy, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements; pregnant women; prior eribulin use; patients with known history of HIV; chronic hepatitis B; or chronic hepatitis C ; Concomitant use with strong or moderate CPY3A4/PgP inhibitors and CPY3A4/PgP inducers is not permitted; patient who is noncompliant with oral medication and mouth wash regimen. 
Clinical Observations and Tests to be Performed 
Pre-study assessments should be performed within 28 days prior to initiating therapy. 
We will assess tumor response using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST)
Version 1.1 criteria based on radiologic imaging every 2 cycles of treatment (6 weeks). 
Toxicity will be evaluated based on the Nationa l Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.0.Patients enrolled in the expanded phase Ib coho rt at the RP2D will also be asked to undergo 
serial blood sampling to evaluate the PK of evero limus and eribulin. Although it is unlikely that 
these two agents will interact negatively, both drugs are substrates for the membrane transporter 
P-glycoprotein. Therefore, PK studies will be pe rformed in the expanded cohort treated at the 
RP2D to evaluate the PK of the drug combination. 
For correlative studies, blood will be collected from patients who consented at the prior time 
points: prior to the first dose of everolimus and eribulin, at 4 and 8 hours after the first dose of 
everolimus and eribulin on day 1, and at two post-dose time points on days 4 and 8 of the first cycle for patients enrolled on the expanded cohort of RP2D.
Two sets of optional punch biopsies (two biopsies per set for a total of four biopsies) will be 
performed on patients who consented as follows:  
xFirst set 
oBiopsy 1 (3mm diameter) will be performed one week prior to any dosing.  
oBiopsy 2 (3mm diameter) will be performed on the same site as Biopsy 1 on the 
day of the first dose of eribulin and everolimus; cycle 1 (prior to any dosing).  
xSecond set 
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 6 of 79oBiopsy 3 (3mm diameter) will be performed on a new site on the day of the first 
dose of eribulin and everolimus; cycle 1 (prior to any dosing). 
oBiopsy 4 (3mm diameter) will be perfor med on the same site as Biopsy 3, one 
week later on the day that the second dose of eribulin is given (prior to dosing). 
Patient will be asked to provide a fresh tumor tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion. Newly –obtained is defined as a specimen obtained up to 6 weeks (42 
days) prior to initiation of treatment on day 1. Subjects for whom newly-obtained samples cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject safety co ncern) may submit an archived specimen only 
upon agreement from the study PI. 
For patient who consented for optional tumor biopsy upon disease progression, a sample of 
tumor tissue will also be collected in patients who provided additional consent .
Serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), skin biopsy tissue and tumor tissue will be 
processed and stored according to established laboratory protocols and stored at -80°C until 
proteomic analysis. Analysis will be performed by Luminex and mass spectrometry, and western 
blotting for pAKT (Ser473), and AKT, p4E-BP1 (ser65/Thr70) and 4E-BP1, pS6K1 (Thr389) and S6K1, and pS6 (Ser235/236) and S6. 
Statistical Considerations
Tables will be created to summarize all toxicit ies and side effects by dose, course, organ, and 
severity. Rates and associated 95%  confidence limits will be estimated for DLTs at the RP2D, 
EFS at 4 months and response. Kaplan Meier met hods will be used to estimate the median and 
95% confidence limits for EFS and OS. Descriptiv e statistics will be provided for the research 
participant demographics and PK parameters.

Version: 13 Page 14 of 791.0 Background and Study Rationale 
1.1 Metastatic Breast Cancer 
Patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) have a median overall survival (OS) of 
approximately 27 months;1and median OS is even lower in previously treated patients.2While 
OS has improved due to the introduction of new therap eutic agents, drug resistance is an ongoing 
challenge in the treatment of patients with MBC.  Most patients with MBC become resistant to 
standard chemotherapeutic agents such as ant hracycline and/or taxanes or platinums; and while 
the development of hormonal therapies and anti-H ER2 therapies have revolutionized treatment 
for patients with hormone receptor-positive and HER2-positive breast cancer,3patients with 
hormone receptor-negative/HER2-negative cancer (triple negative breast cancer, TNBC) are in need of more efficacious therapies to improve clinical outcomes.  
1.1.1 Triple Negative Breast Cancer 
Metastatic TNBC is an aggressive disease w ith a poor prognosis reflected by low rates of 
relapse-free survival and OS.4Many patients with TNBC receive  anthracyclines and/or taxanes; 
and many develop resistant or refractory disease in the metastatic setting. Even when drug 
resistance is not noted, patients with TNBC have a suboptimal response to chemotherapy.5Since 
TNBC shares many features with BRCA1-assoc iated breast cancer, which is particularly 
susceptible to DNA-damaging agents, platinum combination therapy, including cisplatin and carboplatin, is commonly used to treat patients with TNBC. However, studies have shown that 
platinum combination therapy does not result in a significant improvement in outcome when compared with other regimens. The use of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors was suggested to be a promising novel approach to the treatment of TNBC, however, the highly 
anticipated results of the BSI-201trial of carboplati n, gemcitabine, and olaparib in patients with 
TNBC showed disappointing results. New effective therapeutic approaches to treat patients with 
metastatic TNBC are therefore needed. 
1.2 Eribulin and Everolimus 
1.2.1 Eribulin mesylate (E7389) 
Eribulin mesylate is a synthetic analog of halichondrin B, a natural product isolated from the 
marine sponge Halichondria okadai .6It acts as a cancer therapeutic via a tubulin-based anti-
mitotic mechanism, which leads to G2/M cell cycle arrest, disruption of mitotic spindles, and 
ultimately apoptotic cell death. It inhibits cell growth in a wide range of cancer cell lines 
including: breast; colon; prostate; ovarian; small ce ll lung cancer; non-small cell lung cancer; 
histiocytic lymphoma; promyelocytic leukemi a; pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma; 
melanoma; and uterine sarcoma.7  
Studies have assessed eribulin in advanced solid tumors defining the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and tumor response.
8Eribulin has also been studied in 
patients with MBC.9The E7389-A001-201 study enrolled 103 MBC patients after anthracycline 
and taxane failure. Patients received eribulin m onotherapy in two different schedules; days 1, 8, 
and 15 of a 28-day cycle; and days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. The most common drug-related adverse events (AEs) were Grade 3-4 neutropenia (60.4%, 28-day cycle and 65.7%, 21-day 
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 15 of 79cycle) and fatigue (52.4%). The clinical benefit rate (CBR) was 17.2%. Six of the 59 (10.2%) 
evaluable patients on the 28-day cycle and 4/ 28 (14.3%) patients on the 21-day cycle had a 
partial response (PR).8The EMBRACE trial was a phase 3 open-label randomized study of 
eribulin monotherapy versus treat ment of physician’s choice in 762 MBC patients who had 
previously received 2-5 chemotherapy regimens for MBC (84% of patients had previous hormonal therapy). Eribulin (1.4mg/m
2) given intravenously on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle 
showed a clinically meaningful OS improvement from 10.6 to 13.1 months (p=0.041). The CBR was 23% in the eribulin group versus 17% in the treatment of physician’s choice. The most common toxicities included asthenia (54%), ne utropenia (52%), peripheral neuropathy (34.6%), 
nausea (28.3%), and constipation (21%). Neutrop enia was the most common Grade 4 AE in 
patients receiving eribulin (24.1%).

1.2.2 Everolimus (RAD001, Afinitor) 
Everolimus inhibits cytokine and growth-factor-dependent cell proliferation by inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).
10mTOR functions as a sensor of mitogens, growth 
factors, energy, and nutrient levels; and it faci litates cell-cycle progression through the G1 to S-
phase. The regulation of mTOR signaling is complex and involves positive regulators such as protein kinase B (AKT) that phosphorylate and in activate negative regulators including the 
tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/TSC2). The phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-mTOR pathway is frequently activated in many human  cancers; and oncogenic transformation may 
sensitize tumor cells to mTOR inhibitors.
11, 12Everolimus has shown significant anti-tumor 
activity,13-20but since the PI3K-mTOR pathway is downstream of numerous other effectors 
known to play a role in cancer cell proliferation and/or survival, there is an increasing focus on the drug’s possibilities when combined with other anti -tumor therapies. Increased efficacy has 
been observed with all combination partners tested.
21-27
Everolimus has been evaluated in a number of cl inical trials including in patients with solid 
tumors and MBC.28-30In patients with advanced solid tumors, oral everolimus is rapidly 
absorbed with a median time to peak concentration of 1-2 hours post-dose. The steady-state AUC0-τ (area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable 
concentration) is dose-proportional over the dose range of 5-70mg in a weekly regimen and 5-10mg in a daily regimen. In a randomized, double-blind, multicenter phase III study of everolimus and exemestane vers us placebo and exemestane for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive 
MBC, 724 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 10mg daily everolimus (N=485) or matching placebo (N=239) in addition  to open-label 25mg daily exemestane. The 
study demonstrated a statistically significant clin ical benefit of the everolimus and exemestane 
over placebo and exemestane by a 2.4-fold increa se in median progression-free-survival (PFS) 
(6.93 months versus 2.83 months), resulting in a 57% risk-reduction of progression or death. 
Objective response was observed in 9.5% of patien ts in the everolimus and exemestane arm 
versus 0.4% in the placebo and exemestane ar m (p<0.0001). Furthermore, the CBR for patients 
receiving everolimus and exemestane was 33.4% versus 18% in patients receiving placebo and 
exemestane (p<0.0001.) The most common grade 3- 4 AEs in the everolimus and exemestane 
group versus the placebo and exemestane group we re stomatitis (8% versus 1%), anemia (6%

Approximately 35,982 cancer patients have been treated with everolimus as of  31-Mar-2014:
x19,668 patients in Novartis-sponsored clinical trials
x2,394 patients in the individual patient supply program
xMore than 13,930 patients in investigator-sponsored studies.
1.3 Rationale for the Combination of Eribulin and Everolimus 
in TNBC 
Mutations in the PI3K pathway are the second most common 
mutation in breast cancer, and are the most common activating 
mutations, found in 26%-45% of breast cancers. Patients with TNBC 
demonstrate higher levels of AKT activation compared  to other patients with breast cancers, with 
consequent activation of th e mTOR pathway downstream of AKT. There is a well known 
feedback response with mTOR inhibition that seems to activate AKT. We performed preclinical evaluation of the effect of eribulin treatment on the PI3K pathway in TNBC and HER2-expressing breast cancers, both alone and in combination with everolimus.  
We first evaluated the effect of eribulin on the growth of multiple breast 
cancer cell lines including TNBC cell lines. The half maximal 
inhibitory concentration (IC50) for eribulin ranged from 0.1nM-0.3nM in TNBC cells to ~0.06nM in the HER2-overexpressing cell line, SKBR3, to 0.5nM-0.8nM in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer cells. 
Importantly, eribulin clearly inhibited the 
phosphorylation of AKT in TNBC cells with inhibition of the Ser473 pAKT beginning between 1nM and 10nM and nearing complete inhibition at 50nM, with no effect on total AKT (Figure 1 ). In the 
HER2-expressing cell line, SKBR3, eribulin began to have its effect on pAKT at 10pM ( Figure 
2). This effect appeared to begin at 2-4 hours.  
In TNBC cells, everolimus has effects at very low doses, but increasing doses beyond a certain 
concentration did not show a linear incremental improvement in cell inhibition such that in some lines an IC50 was not achieved even at 10,000nM. We then evaluated everolimus using log dilutions in combination with standard dilutions of eribulin and found synergistic growth inhibition in TNBC cell lines using the MTT assay, except for at the highest doses ( Figure 3 ).

combinations. With the except ion of eribulin at 1.6nM with everolimus at 10,000nM in MDA468 cells (H1.6+R10), all CI’s are <1 (horizontal 
line), indicative of synergy.
We then performed western blots for pAKT and the mTOR target, pS6K1, and found that the 
combination of eribulin and everolimus suppressed both pAKT and pS6K1 at 24 hours; AKT was suppressed by eribulin in a dose-related fashion. A well known phenomenon associated with 
mTOR inhibition is the enhancement of pAKT when  mTOR is inhibited, and this was seen at 24 
hours with everolimus alone. However, in combin ation with eribulin, both the increased pAKT 
and pS6K1 were suppressed ( Figure 4; lanes 7 and 9 versus lane 5).

1.4 Rationale for Current Study 
Based on our preclinical findings, we hypothesize that the combination of everolimus and 
eribulin will have a synergistic effect with a dual inhibition of both AKT and mTOR and will 
increase clinical activity in patients with metastatic TNBC. Previous studies of each of these drugs in MBC show acceptable toxicity, and we hypothesize that this drug combination could Figure 4 :

IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 18 of 79offer a novel approach to treat patients with metastatic TNBC who are resistant to anthracyclines 
and taxanes or platinums. 
2.0 Specific Objectives 
The overall objective of this study is to conduct a phase I/Ib trial of everolimus plus eribulin in 
metastatic TNBC patients who are resistant to an thracyclines and/or taxanes or platinums. The 
trial will consist of a Phase I portion and a Phase Ib portion.  
2.1 Primary Objective for Phase I Study 
The primary objective of the Phase I portion of the study is to determine the safety and 
tolerability of everolimus and eribulin, and de termine the recommended Phase Ib dose (RP2D) of 
the drug combination in patients with resistant metastatic TNBC.  
2.2 Primary Objective for Phase Ib Study 
The primary objective of the Phase IB portion of the study is to evaluate the event-free survival 
(EFS) rate for patients with resistant metastatic TNBC  at the RP2D of everolimus and eribulin to 
determine if the drug combination is worthy of further study. 
2.3 Secondary Objectives for Phase Ib Study 
The secondary objectives of the Phase Ib portion of the study are to determine response rate, OS, 
toxicity, and PK for everolimus and eribulin in patients with resistant metastatic TNBC. 
A further secondary objective is to collect blood, skin punch biopsies, and tumor biopsies before 
and after treatment from all patients and perfor m proteomic analysis to determine the level of 
inhibition of the PI3K pathway in tumor cells versus non-therapeutic targets.  
3.0 Study Endpoints 
3.1 Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoints of the study are:  
xPhase I: DLT (see Section 11 for statistical considerations). 
xPhase IB: EFS at 4 months (see Section 11 for statistical considerations). 
3.2 Secondary Endpoints  The secondary endpoints are: 
xPhase Ib: Response rate, PFS, OS, toxicity profile and PK parameters. 
4.0 Study Design 
This is a Phase I/Ib trial of everolimus plus eribulin in metastatic TNBC patients who are 
resistant to anthracyclines and/or taxanes or platinum.
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 19 of 794.1 Phase I Study 
The Phase I portion of the trial will use the toxicity equivalence range (TEQR) design. Based on 
this design, the target equivalence range of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) is 0.20-0.35. Toxicity levels of ≥0.51 will be considered too toxic, and doses which achieve this level will be stopped. 
Patients will enter the protocol in cohorts of thre e. This phase will be considered complete when 
12 patients are studied at a single dose level with a toxicity level <0.51. The RP2D will be the dose closest to the target of 0.25 below 0.51 based on isotonic regression. Based on these requirements, the TEQR design will use a minimum of 6 patients and a maximum of 24 patients (median of 18) to determine the MTD. (see Section 11 ).  
The PMT team for protocol 14036 reviewed the data: dose level 2 was closed after 2 of 3 evaluable participants experienced DLTs an observed rate of 67%;  dose level 1, we saw 4 DLTs in 8 evaluable participants giving an observed DLT rate of 50% on this dose.  Our equivalence 
range for DLT rate for this trial is 20-35%, our ob served rate of 50% is above 35%  so we plan 
to de-escalate. Two participants experien ced grade 4 neutrophil count decrease and 2
experienced mucositis (1 grade 3 DLT, 1 participant received 71% of Everolimus due to grade 2 
which is a DLT). Thus, the team decided to amend the protocol to allow for two new dose levels at a lower dose of Eribulin, and start the next cohort of patients at dose level B1. 
Dosing Schedule: cycle length is 21 days 
Dose level A Everolimus (oral) Eribulin (intravenous)
A-1 2.5mg daily (day 1 to 21) 1.4mg/m2on days 1, 8
A1 5mg daily (day 1 to 21) 1.4mg/m2on days 1,8
A2 7.5mg daily (day 1 to 21) 1.4mg/m2on days 1,8
A3 10mg daily (day 1 to 21) 1.4mg/m2on days 1, 8
Dose level B Everolimus (oral) Eribulin (intravenous)
B1 5mg daily (day 1 to 21) 1.1mg/m2on days 1,8
B-1 2.5mg daily (day 1 to 21) 1.1mg/m2on days 1,8
4.2 Phase Ib Study 
In the Phase Ib portion of the trial, a Simon’s Optimal two -stage design will be used to determine 
if the combination of everolimus and eribulin results in a greater rate of patients who are event-
free at 4 months than with eribulin alone. Based on data from the EMBRACE trial, we set the 4-
month EFS rate for eribulin at 45%. We want to determine if the drug combination has a 4-month EFS rate of ≥70% (25% improvement). Setting both the type I and type II errors to 0.1 
after 12 patients (from the MTD at the end of the phase I trial), if ≤5 patients are event -free at 4 
months, the study will stop for further accrual. If ≥6 patients are event -free at 4 months we will 
enroll 15 more patients for a total of 27 patients at the RP2D. If ≥16 patients out of the 27 are 
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 20 of 79event-free at 4 months we will consider th e combination worthy of further study (see Section 
11).
Patient will be asked to provide a fresh tumor tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional 
biopsy of a tumor lesion. Newly –obtained is defined as a specimen obtained up to 6 weeks (42 
days) prior to initiation of treatment on day 1. Subjects for whom newly-obtained samples cannot 
be provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject safety co ncern) may submit an archived specimen only 
upon agreement from the study PI. 
For patients who consented for optional tumor biopsy upon disease progression, a sample of 
tumor tissue that may be biopsied or resected will also be collected (see Section 12.2 ).
To reduce dose-limiting oral mucositis, a mandatory dexamethasone mouth wash ( alcohol-
free 0.5 mg/5 mL dexamethasone solution ) will be used for primary prophylaxis of oral 
mucositis (Section 8.1.2) .
We will assess tumor response using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 criteria based on radiologic imaging every 2 cycles of treatment (6 weeks). 
Toxicity will be evaluated based on the Nationa l Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.0. 
Patients enrolled in the expanded cohort at the RP2D will also be asked to undergo serial blood 
sampling to evaluate the PK of everolimus and eribulin. Although it is unlikely that these two 
agents will interact negatively, both drugs ar e substrates for the membrane transporter P-
glycoprotein. Therefore, PK studies will be performed in the expanded cohort treated at the RP2D to evaluate the PK of the drug combination (see Section 12.1 ).
For correlative studies, blood will be collected from patients prior to the first dose of everolimus and eribulin, at 4 and 8 hours after the first dose of everolimus and eribulin on day 1, and at two post-dose time points on days 4 and 8 of the first cycle for patients enrolled on the expanded cohort of RP2D and consented for additional research blood collection.  
Two sets of optional skin punch biopsies (2 biops ies per set for a total of 4 biopsies) will be 
performed for patients who consented for skin biopsy for the expanded cohort level.

Patient will be asked to provide a fresh tumor tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional 
biopsy of a tumor lesion prior to study entry. Newly –obtained is defined as a specimen obtained 
up to 6 weeks (42 days) prior to initiation of treatment on day 1. Subjects for whom newly-obtained samples cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject safety concern) may submit an archived specimen only upon agreement from the study PI. 
For patients who consented for optional tumor biopsy upon progression, a sample of tumor tissue 
that may be biopsied or resected and will also be collected (see Section 12.2 ).
Serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), skin biopsy tissue and tumor tissue will be 
processed and stored according to established laboratory protocols and stored at -80°C until proteomic analysis. Analysis will be performed by Luminex and mass spectrometry, and western blotting for pAKT (Ser473), and AKT, p4E-BP1 (ser65/Thr70) and 4E-BP1, pS6K1 (Thr389) and S6K1, and pS6 (Ser235/236) and S6 (see Section 12.2 ).

Version: 13 Page 27 of 796.5 Registration Guidelines 
General Guidelines 
Eligible patients will be registered on the study centrally at the Data 
Coordinating Center (DCC) at the City of Hope.  Staff (including physicians, 
protocol  nurses and/or CRAs) should call the DCC at (626) 256-4673, ext. 64267 to verify dose level and slot availa bility, and to reserve a slot for a 
specific prospective subject.  Slots can  only be held for a limited time as 
specified in Appendix C. 
   Eligible patients must be registered within 2 weeks prior to start of protocol                   therapy.     
Issues that would cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Principal Investigator. If a patient does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the patient’s registration on  the study may be canceled. The Data 
Coordinating Center should be notified of cancellations as soon as possible.  
Registration Process 
Once a slot at a dose level has been reserved, the signed informed consent has been obtained, all pretreatment evalua tions have been performed, and 
patient’s eligibility has been c onfirmed by the Data Coordinating Center, a 
patient will be registered on study. 
To register a patient, the treating physician should contact the protocol nurse 
or the responsible Clinical Research Asso ciate (CRA) in Clinical Trial Office 
(CTO) to complete the eligibility/registration form. The protocol nurse or 
CRA will contact the Data Coordinating Ce nter at the City of Hope (626-256-
4673, ext. 64267 or e-mail dcc@coh.org), EMAIL a copy of the completed 
eligibility checklist, required pre-study tests (per protocol – and may include 
laboratory, CT and pathology reports), signed Informed Consent, signed 
Patients' Bill of Rights and HIPAA authorization form to dcc@coh.org. See Appendix C (“Registration Procedures”).
The protocol nurse or CRA will then cal l the Data Coordinating Center (626-
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 
2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 28 of 79256-4673 ext. 64267) to confirm receipt of all registration documents. To 
complete the registration process, the Data Coordinating Center will: 
xVerify and confirm the patient’s eligibility.
xAssign a patient accession number (for example, COH-001, COH-002, 
etc.). 
xRegister the patient on study centrally (the City of Hope CRA assigned to the trial will still be responsible for accessioning via MIDAS).  If 
multi-site study, COH DCC staff will be responsible for registering the participating site patients at City of Hope. 
xAssign the patient to a dose level (as applicable).  
xComplete and email a Confirmation of Registration form within 24 
hours to include the COH patient study number and dose level (as applicable) to the study team, which will include the Principal Investigator, treating physician, protocol nurse, CRA and COH IDS Pharmacy. 
xCall the protocol nurse and/or CRA to verbally confirm registration. 
xA patient failing to meet all protocol requirements will not be 
registered.

administered orally, once daily at the same time every day either consistently with food 
or consistently without food. Tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. The tablets must not be chewed or crushed. For patients unable to swallow tablets, everolimus tablet(s) should be dispersed completely in a glass of water (containing 
approximately 30mL) by gently stirring, immediately prior to drinking. The glass should 
be rinsed with the same volume of water and the rinse should be completely swallowed to ensure that the entire dose is administered. 
7.3 Treatment Overview 
For a tabular view of the treatment, monitoring, and follow-up schedule, see study 
calendar inSection 6.4 . For dose levels see the study design ( Section 4.0 ).
7.4 Planned Duration of Therapy 
Treatment cycle length is 21 days with response evaluation every 2 cycles. 
7.5 Subject Follow-Up
Patients will be followed after removal from  study until death. Patients removed from 
study for AEs will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the AE (See Section 10
for further AE information). 
7.6 Supportive Care, Other Concomi tant Therapy, Prohibited Medications 
Ondansetron will be used as pre-medication for prophylaxis of eribulin induced nausea.  
If needed, prior to each treatment with eribulin, patients may be pre-medicated with dexamethasone 10mg to prevent a hypersensitivity reaction.  Ondansetron 8mg oral tablet will be used as needed at home for tr eatment related nausea and/or vomiting. 
7.6.1 Dexamethasone Mouth Wash
To reduce dose-limiting oral mucositis, a mandatory dexamethasone mouth wash 
(alcohol-free 0.5 mg/5 mL dexamethasone solution ) will be used for primary 
prophylaxis of oral mucositis . Patients will start the prophylactic oral care regimen on 
the same day they start treatment with everolimus + eribuline. The mouthwash should be taken as directed in section 8.1.2. Treating physician or other health provider of the 
treatment team will write the prescription of the steroid-based mouthwash. Usage of the 
mouth wash should be documented by patien t and followed up during clinic visit.After 
first two cycles of treatment, patient can use the steroid mouth wash 4 times a day as needed .
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 
2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 31 of 797.6.2 Concomitant medications 
Patients must be instructed not to take any medications (over-the-counter or other 
products) during the protocol treatment period without prior consultation with the investigator. The investigator should instruct the patient to notify the study site about any new medications he/she takes after the start of study drug. All medications (other than 
study drug) and significant non-drug therapies (including physical therapy and blood 
transfusions) taken within 28 days of starting study treatment through the 30-day safety 
follow up visit should be reported on the CRF. 
7.6.2.1 Angioedema with concomitant use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors 
Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk for 
angioedema (e.g. swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory 
impairment). 
7.6.2.2 Cytochrome P450 and P-glycoprotein inhibitors/inducers/substrates 
Everolimus is metabolized by CYP3A4 in the liver and to some extent in the intestinal 
wall.  Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or PgP may cause increased everolimus concentrations. Inducers of CYP3A4 or PgP may cause decreased everolimus concentrations. Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4, and a substrate and moderate inhibitor of the multidrug efflux pump, PgP (PgP, MDR1, and ABCB1).  The extent of absorption and 
subsequent elimination of systemically absorbed everolimus may be influenced by 
products that are substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of CYP3A4 and/or PgP.  In vitro studies showed that everolimus is a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of CYP2D6, potentially increasing the concentrations of products eliminated by these enzymes. 
Therefore,  
xCo-administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or with a P-glycoprotein (PgP) 
inhibitor is not permitted. 
xCoadministration with PgP substrates should be with caution as everolimus can affect their drug concentrations. 
xCo-administration with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors is not permitted.   If a patient 
requires co-administration of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, everolimus therapy must 
be interrupted. Once the inhibitor is disc ontinued, everolimus can be resumed only 
after discussion with the PI and a after a minimum washout period of 2 days (or longer depending on agent’s half life).   
xGrapefruit, Seville oranges, and starfruit affect P450 and PgP activity. Concomitant 
use is not permitted. 
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 
2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 32 of 79xCoadministration of a CYP3A4 inducer is not permitted except topical steroid. Oral 
dexamethasone mouth wash is allowed.

7.6.3 Vaccinations 
Immunosuppressants may affect the response to vaccination and vaccination during 
treatment with everolimus may therefore be less effective. The use of live vaccines 
should be avoided during treatment with everolimus.  Examples of live vaccines are: intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella,  oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, 
and TY21a typhoid vaccines. 
8.0 Dose Delays/Modifications 
8.1 Everolimus 
The most common AEs reported for everolimus  that may require dose modifications are 
stomatitis, rash, and non-infectious pneumonitis.30
8.1.1 Dose Limiting Toxicities 
Definition of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) based on CTCAE 4.0. All toxicities will be 
attributed to study drug (everolimus) except hematological toxicities.  Hematological DLTs will be defined for the combination of eribulin and everolimus.  If a hematological 
DLT occurs, dose reduction or delay will be conducted according to rules defined in 8.1.6 
and 8.2.2. 
DLT is defined as an AE or abnormal laboratory value as at least possibly related to the 
study medication and meets any of the criteria per CTCAE 4.0 . The following table is recommended for the most anticipated toxicities.  
Decisions to escalate, de-escalate, or expand a dose level will be based on the first course 
of treatment. To be evaluable for toxicity, a patient must receive at least 1 complete 
course of treatment (at least 75% of planned dose of both drugs without toxicity) and be 
followed for at least 21 days (more if there is a dose delay) or have experienced a DLT as 
defined above. All patients enrolled are to be fully followed for toxicity; any patients who 
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 
2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 34 of 79are not evaluable for toxicity will be re placed. Intra-patient dose escalation is not 
allowed.
Table 8.1.1a Criteria for defining dose-limiting toxicities. 
Toxicity DLT criteria
HematologyCTCAE grade ≥3 neuropenia lasting more than  7 consecutive days
CTCAE grade 4 thrombocytopenia
CTCAE grade 4 neutropenia
CTCAE Grade 3 neutropenia wi th fever (temperature ≥38.5C)
Non-

Exceptions to 
DLT criteriaGrade 3 alopecia
Controllable  grade 3 nausea and vomiting
<5 days of CTCAE grade 3 fatigue
Triglycerides < 1,500mg/dl, which recover within 1  week
Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities that are correctable to grade 2 or less 
within 24 hours
Grade 3 hyperglycemia that is controlled to Grade 2 and under should 
not be considered DLT. For management of hyperglycemia, please refer
to section 8.1.9.
Treatment 
delays>2 weeks as a result of unresolved toxicity during the first cycle of 
therapy (failure of ANC to recover to ≥1,000/μ L or platelets to recover to 
≥50,000/μ L within 14 days of the last treatment)
OthersFailure to complete at least 75% of planned dose of either one of the
drugs during cycle 1, due to toxicity, will also be considered a DLT .
  
Follow-up for toxicities. 
Patients whose treatment is interrupted or permanently discontinued due to an AE or clinically significant laboratory value, must be followed up weekly  (or more frequently if 
clinically indicated) for 4 weeks, and subse quently at approximately 4 week intervals, 
until resolution or stabilization of the event, whichever comes first. Appropriate clinical 
experts such as cardiologist, pulmonologists etc should be consulted as deemed 
necessary. All patients must be followed up for 21 days when taken off study . 
  
8.1.2 Stomatitis 
Inflammation of the mucous membranes in th e mouth may occur. Ulcerated areas in the 
oral cavity, inner surface of the lips, or tongue, closely resembling aphthous stomatitis may occur. Onset ty pically occurs early ( ≤1 month after treatment initiation) and is 
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 
2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 35 of 79transient. 44%-70% of everolimus-treated patients develop mouth ulcers, stomatitis, or 
oral mucositis, which are mostly Grade 1 or 2.
To reduce dose-limiting oral mucositis, a mandatory dexamethasone mouth wash 
(alcohol-free 0.5 mg/5 mL dexamethasone solution ) will be used for primary 
prophylaxis of oral mucositis . Steroid based mouth wash was studied in a randomized 
phase II study evaluating miracle mouth wash  plus hydrocortisone versus prednisolone
mouth rinses as prophylaxis for everolimus- associated stomatitis[37]. This study 
provided evidence of a reduced incidence of mTOR-associated stomatitis with prophylactic use of a steroid mouth rinse. The 25% incidence of all-grade and 8%/0% 
incidence of G2/3 stomatitis compare favorably with the 67% and 24%/8% incidence of all-grade and G2/3 stomatitis, respectively , in BOLERO-2. These preliminary data also 
demonstrated the safety and tolerability of these 2 steroid mouth rinses. 
Currently, there is an ongoing phase II trial examining the effect of dexamethasone based 
mouth wash[38]. We would like to utilize this dexamethasone based mouth wash for the current study. The mouth care regimen consists of a steroid-based mouthwash (alcohol-free 0.5 mg/5 mL dexamethasone solution) . Patients will start the prophylactic oral care regimen on the same day they start treatment with everolimus + eribuline. The mouthwash should be taken as follow: 
- Swish and spit 10ml of mouthwash 4 times each day 
- Hold mouthwash in mouth for a minimum of 2 minutes - Swish it around in the mouth, so it comes in contact with every surface of the 
mouth 
- Spit it out  (do not swallow) - Abstain from eating or drinking for a leat 1 hour after performing mouthwash 
regimen 
- Continue with assigned oral care regimen for the first 2 months (56 days) of 
everolimus + eribuline therapy, after with mouthwash will be stopped. 
Treating physician or other health provider of the treatment team will write the 
prescription of the steroid-based mouthwash. Usage of the mouth wash should be 
documented by patient and followed up during clinic visit. After first two cycles of 
treatment, patient can use the steroid mo uth wash 4 times a day as needed .
Upon diagnosis of ≥ grade 1 stomatitis, a normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) mouth 
rinse will be added while patient is c ontinuing the dexamethasone mouthwash. The 
normal saline is administered as a 10mL swish and spit (QID) (must be done prior to the steroid mouthwash QID).  Patients admini stered normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride)
mouth rinse (swish and spit), then waited  for 10-15 mins, and then administered 
dexamethasone mouth wash. No dose adjustment is required for grade I stomatitis.

8.1.7    Management of infections 
Everolimus has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, 
fungal, viral or protozoal infections, including infections with opportunistic pathogens. 
Localized and systemic infections, including pneumonia, other bacterial infections, 
invasive fungal infections, such as aspergillosis or candidiasis and viral infections including reactivation of hepatitis B virus, have been described in patients taking 
everolimus Some of these infections have been severe (e.g. leading to sepsis, respiratory or hepatic failure) and occasionally have had a fatal outcome. 
Physicians and patients should be aware of the increased risk of infection with 
everolimus. Treat pre-existing infections prior  to starting treatment with everolimus. 
While taking everolimus, be vigilant for symptoms and signs of infection; if a diagnosis of infection is made, institute appropriate tr eatment promptly and consider interruption or 
discontinuation of everolimus. 
If a diagnosis of invasive systemic fungal infection is made, discontinue everolimus and 
treat with appropriate antifungal therapy. 
Cases of pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP ), some with a fatal outcome, have been 
reported in patients who received everolimus. PJP may be associated with concomitant 
use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents.  Prophylaxis for PJP should be 
considered when concomitant use of cortic osteroids or other immunosuppressive agents 
are required. 
8.1.8    Management of diarrhea 
Appearance of grade 1-2 diarrhea attributed to study drug toxicity may be treated with 
supportive care such as loperamide, initiated at the earliest onset (for example 4 mg 
orally followed by 2mg orally every 2 hours until resolution of diarrhea). 
8.1.9 Management of hyperglycemia 
Grade 3 hyperglycemia has been observed in pa tients receiving everolimus therapy. The 
fasting state of patients should be  verified when interpreting results. It is suggested that 
optimal glucose control should be achieved befo re starting a patient on everolimus and 
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 
2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 41 of 79should be monitored during everolimus ther apy. Should hyperglycemia develop during 
protocol therapy, standard glucose control interventions should be implemented. If 
hyperglycemia was well-controlled and improved to  less or equal then grade II, this will 
not count toward a DLT. 
8.2 Eribulin 
8.2.1 Dose delays during therapy 
Do not administer eribulin mesylate on Day 1 or Day 8 for any of the following:  
xANC <1×109/L  
xPLT <75×109/L  
xGrade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicities attributed by eribulin. 
8.2.2 Dose adjustment during therapy  
Subjects should be clinically evaluated during treatment by physical examination and 
laboratory testing including complete blood counts as indicated per protocol (see Section 
6.4). If Grade 3 and 4 toxicities are present, treatment should be delayed to allow recovery. Subjects should only be retreated when ANC is ≥1×10
9/L and PLT are 
≥75×109/L and all other toxicity from a previous cycle has recovered to ≤Grade 2. 
Recommended dose reductions as indicated in the US Package Insert are as follows: 
Permanently reduce the 1.4mg/m2eribulin mesylate dose to 1.1mg/m2for any of the 
following: 
xANC <500 mm3 for >7 days. 
xANC <1,000 mm3with fever or infection. 
xPlatelets <25,000 mm3.
xPlatelets <50,000 mm3requiring transfusion. 
xNon-hematologic Grade 3 or 4 toxicities graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.0. 
xOmission or delay of Day 8 dose in previous cycle for toxicity. 
Furthermore: 
xIf any event requires permanent dose reduction while receiving 1.1mg/m2, reduce 
the dose to 0.7mg/m2.
xIf any event requires permanent dose reduction while receiving 0.7mg/m2,
discontinue eribulin. 
There will be no dose reductions outside of the scheduled physical examination and laboratory testing including complete bl ood counts indicated per protocol (see 
Section 6.4).

Version: 13 Page 42 of 799.0 Discontinuation of Study Treatment 
9.1 Patient-initiated Discontinuation of Study Treatment 
Even after a patient agrees to take part in  the study, she may stop therapy or withdraw 
from the study at any time. If the study participant stops treatment but still allows the 
study physician to submit follow-up information, she will continue to be followed 
clinically according to the study schedule. Alternatively, she may choose to have no 
further interaction regarding the study in which case the Principle Investigator or Co-Investigators must obtain written documentation as to the patient’s decision to withdraw 
fully from the study. 
9.2 Investigator-initiated Discontinuation of Study Treatment 
The investigator may require a study subject to discontinue study treatment in the event 
of one of the following: 
xThe patient develops a serious AE (SAE) that she cannot tolerate or that cannot be 
controlled with other medication (see Section 10 ).
xThe patient has disease progression. 
xThe patient has concurrent illness that pre vents further administration of treatment 
If study therapy is stopped but the study subject allows the physician to submit follow-up 
information, she will continue to be followed clinically according to the study schedule. A Withdrawal/Discontinuation Form will be completed by the Principal Investigator, which will allow determination of which st udy subjects are receiving off-protocol 
therapy. 
10.0 Data Safety Monitoring 
10.1 Definition of Risk Level 
This is a Risk Leve l 3 study, as defined in the “Guidance, Policy and Procedures for Data 
and Safety Monitoring for In- House Trials at City of Hope”.
http://www .infosci.coh.org/prot_office/forms/Guidance.doc. Risks are at least balanced 
by the potential benefits to subjects and the importance of the knowledge that may result. 
Adverse events are expected and a formal pl an for monitoring and reporting these AEs is 
required (outlined below). 
10.2 Monitoring and Personnel Responsible for Monitoring 
The Protocol Management Team (PMT) c onsisting of the Principle Investigator, 
Collaborating Investigators, Co-Investigators, CRA, protocol nurse, and statistician is

10.3 Definitions 
Adverse event (AE) An AE is any untoward medical experience or change of an existing 
condition that occurs during or after treatment, whether or not it is considered to be related to the protocol intervention.  
Unexpected Adverse Event [21 CFR 312.32 (a)  An AE is unexpected if it is not listed 
in the investigator’s brochure and/or package insert; is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed; is not cons istent with the risk information described in 
the protocol and/or consent; is not an exp ected natural progression of any underlying 
disease, disorder, condition, or predisposed risk factor of the research participant experiencing the AE. 
Expected Adverse Event - Any event that does not meet the criteria for an unexpected 
event OR is an expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, 
condition, or predisposed risk factor of the res earch participant experiencing the adverse 
event 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) [21 CFR 312.32] is defined as any expected or 
unexpected adverse event that results in any of the following outcomes:
xDeath 
xIs life-threatening experience (places the s ubject at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred)

existing hospitalization 
xA persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
xA congenital anomaly/birth defect 
xSecondary Malignancy 
xAny other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may re quire medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above (examples of such events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensiv e treatment in the emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasisas of convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse).
Unanticipated problem (UP) Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all three
of the following criteria: 
1. Unexpected (in term nature, severity, or frequency) given the following: a) 
the research procedures described in the protocol-related documents such as the IRB approved research protocol, informed consent document or 
Investigator Brochure (IB); and b) the characteristics of the subject 
population being studied; AND
2. Related or possibly related to participati on in the research (possibly related 
means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcomes may have been caused by the drugs, devices or procedures 
involved in the research); AND
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than previously known or recognized. 
10.4  Reporting of Unanticipated Problems and Adverse Events 
Unanticipated Problems: Most unanticipated problems must be reported to the COH 
DSMC and IRB within 5 calendar days according to definitions and guidelines at 
http://www.coh.org/hrpp/Pages/hrpp -policies.aspx. Any unanticipated problem that 
occurs during the study conduct will be reported to the DSMC and IRB by submitting 
electronically in iRIS (http://iris.coh.org). 
Serious Adverse Events - All SAEs occurring during this study, whether observed by 
the physician, nurse, or reported by the patient, will be reported according to definitions 
and guidelines at http://www.coh.org/hrpp/Pages/hrpp-policies.aspx and Table 2 . Those 
SAEs that require expedited reporting will be submitted electronically in iRIS 
(http://iris.coh.org/ ).
Adverse Events - Adverse events will be monitored by the PMT.  Adverse events that do 
not meet the criteria of serious OR are not unanticipated problems will be reported only in the protocol continuation reports and PMT report (see Table 2).

10.5  Additional Reporting 
10.5.1 Eisai
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 
2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 46 of 79We will provide Eisai with copies of all SAEs within 7 working days of occurrence of the 
SAE. We will report any pregnancy occurring in association with use of an Eisai Product to Eisai.  
10.5.2 Novartis 
We will provide Novartis with copies of all SAEs within 24 hours of occurrence of the 
SAE. SAEs will be reported on the MedWatch Form 3500A, which can be accessed at: 
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/MedWa tch/MedWatch forms should be sent to the 
FDA online at the above internet address or at: 
MEDWATCH 
5600 Fishers Lane 
Rockville, MD  20852-9787 
Fax: 1-800-FDA-0178 (1-800-332-0178) 
Collection of complete information concerning SAEs is extremely important. Full 
descriptions of each event will be followed by Novartis. Thus, follow-up information which becomes available as the SAE evolves, as well as supporting documentation (e.g., hospital discharge summaries and autopsy report s), should be collected subsequently, if 
not available at the time of the initial re port, and immediately sent using the same 
procedure as the initial SAE report.  
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional ingestion of any dose of a product 
that is considered both excessive and medically important. For reporting purposes, 
Novartis considers an overdose, regardless of adverse outcome, as an important medical 
event. 
The principal investigator has the obligation to report all serious adverse events to the 
FDA, IRB, and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Drug Safety and Epidemiology Department (DS&E). All events reported to the FDA by the investigator are to be filed utilizing the Form FDA 3500A (MedWatch Form). 
To ensure patient safety, every SAE, regardless of suspected causality, occurring 
• after the patient has provided informed consent and until at least 30 days after thepatient has stopped study treatment/participation • after protocol-specified procedures begin (e.g., placebo run-in, washout period, double-blind treatment, etc.) and 30 days af ter the patient has stopped study treatment 
• after the start of any period in which the study protocol interferes with the standardmedical treatment given to a patient (e.g., treatment withdrawal during washout period, change in treatment to a fixed dose of concomitant medication) and until 30 days after the patient has stopped study treatment must be reported to Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence (fax: 877-778-9739). This includes serious, related, labeled (expected) and serious, related, unlabeled (unexpected) adverse experiences. All deaths 
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 
2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 47 of 79during treatment or within 30 days following completion of active protocol therapy must 
be reported within 5 working days. 
Any SAEs experienced after this 30 days period should only be reported to Novartis if 
the investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study drug. Recurrent episodes, complications, or progression of the initial SAE must be reported as follow-up to the original episode within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow-up information.  
A SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely 
unrelated to a previously reported one should be  reported separately as a new event. The 
end date of the first event must be provided. 
The original copy of the SAE Report and the fa x confirmation sheet must be kept within 
the Trial Master File at the study site. 
Follow-up information is sent to the same fa x number as the original SAE Report Form 
was sent, using a new fax cover sheet, stating that this is a follow-up to the previously 
reported SAE, and giving the date of the original report. Each re-occurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as a follow-up to that event regardless of when it occurs . The follow-up information should describe 
whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind was broken or not (if applicable), and whethe r the patient continued or withdrew from 
study participation. 
If the SAE is not previously documented in the Everolimus Investigator Brochure or 
Package Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the Novartis study drug, a DS&E associate may urgently require further information from the investigator forHealth Authority reporting. Novartis may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN), to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported. 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reac tions (SUSARs) will be collected and 
reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with 
Directive 2001/20/EC or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries. 
For Comparator Drugs/Secondary Suspects (Concomitant Medications), all serious 
adverse experiences will be forwarded to the comapartor drug company by the 
investigator. 
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 
2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 48 of 7910.4 Pregnancy 
Preclinical data regarding reproductive toxicity is described in the most recent 
Investigator Brochure. The potential reproductive risk for humans is unknown.  Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use highly effective contraception methods while they are receiving everolimus and up to 8 weeks after treatment has been stopped.   
To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy occu rring while the patient is on study treatment 
must be reported to Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed up to de termine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary 
termination, details of the birth, and the pres ence or absence of any birth defects, 
congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. The newborn will 
be followed for at least 12 months. 
Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form and reported by the 
investigator to the oncology Novartis Drug Safety and Epidemiology Department (DS&E). Pregnancy follow-up should be reco rded on the same form and should include 
an assessment of the possible relationship to  the study treatment and any pregnancy 
outcome. Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported on the SAE Report Form. 
10.6  Adverse Event Documentation 
All AEs occurring after the subject has signed the informed consent must be fully 
recorded in the subject’s case report form.
Documentation must be supp orted by an entry in the subject’s file. A laboratory test 
abnormality considered clinically relevant, e.g., causing the subject to withdraw from the 
study, requiring treatment or causing apparent clinical manifestations, or judged relevant by the investigator, should be reported as an adverse event. Each event should be described in detail along with start and stop dates, severity, relationship to investigational 
product, action taken and outcome. 
10.7  Comprehensive AEs and Potential Risks 
The descriptions and grading scales found in the current version of the NCI CTCAE (v.4) 
will be utilized for AE reporting. A copy of the current CTCAE can be downloaded from the CTEP web site: http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html. AEs will be collected 
according to the study calendar schedule in Section 6.4 .
10.7.1 Eribulin 
The most common AEs reported in >1 of 10 subjects receiving eribulin are shown below based on 827 breast cancer subjects who received the recommended dose in Phase II and Phase III breast cancer studies.

10.8 Other AE Factors to Consider 
Factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to study drugs include: 
xThe Temporal Sequence from Drug Administration : The event should occur after 
the drug is given. The length of time from drug exposure to event should be 
evaluated in the clinical context of the event.
xRecovery on Discontinuation (de-challenge), Recurrence on Reintroduction (re-challenge) :Subject’s response after drug discont inuation (de-challenge) or 
subjects response after drug re-introduction (r e-challenge) should be considered in 
the view of the usual clinical course of the event in question.
xUnderlying, Concomitant, Current Diseases : Each report should be evaluated in 
the context of the natural history and cours e of the disease being treated and any 
other disease the subject may have.
xConcomitant Medication or Treatment : The other drugs the subject is taking or 
the treatment the subject receives should be examined to determine whether any of them may be suspected to cause the event in question.
xThe Pharmacology and Pharmacokinetics of the Test Drug : The pharmacokinetic 
properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) of the test drug(s), coupled with the indi vidual subject’s pharmacodynamics should be considered.
11.0 Statistical Considerations 
Primary Objective for Phase I Study 
The primary objective of the Phase I portion of the study is to determine the safety and 
tolerability of everolimus and eribulin, and determine the recommended Phase II dose 
(RP2D) of the drug combination in patients with resistant metastatic TNBC. 
Primary Objective for Phase Ib Study 
The primary objective of the Phase Ib portion of the study is to evaluate the event-free 
survival (EFS) rate for patients with resistant metastatic TNBC at the RP2D of 
everolimus and eribulin to determine if the drug combination is worthy of further study. 
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 
2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 52 of 79Secondary Objectives for Phase Ib Study 
The secondary objectives of the Phase Ib portion of the study are to determine response 
rate, OS, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics (PK) for everolimus and eribulin in patients with resistant metastatic TNBC. 
A further secondary objective is to collect  blood, skin punch biopsies, and tumor biopsies 
before and after treatment from all patients, a nd perform proteomic analysis to determine 
the level of inhibition of the PI3K pathway in tumor cells versus non-therapeutic targets.  
11.1 Design 
11.1.1 Phase I portion 
The Phase I  portion of this study will use the toxicity equivalence range (TEQR) design 
of Blanchard and Longmate [35] to evaluate select dose levels of the everolimus in combination with eribulin and to determine the RP2D.  In this implementation of the TEQR design, we define the target equiva lence range of the DLT rate as 0.20-0.35. DLT 
rate levels of 0.51 or higher will be considered too toxic and doses that achieve that level will not be revisited.  The dose escalation de-esc alation rules will be the following. If the 
rate of participants that experience a DLT is below 0.20 we will escalate, if the rate is above 0.35 we will de-escalate a nd if it is between 0.20-0.35 we will stay at the current 
dose.  Participants will enter the protocol in  cohorts of 3.  The starting dose will be dose 
level 1. This study will end when 12 resear ch participants are studied at a single dose 
level with a toxicity level below 0.51.  Further we also implement the additional rules: 1) terminate the trial if dose level 1 is too toxic, and 2) if the current dose is safe but based  
on the data the next dose is deemed too toxic, stay at the current dose.  The RP2D will be 
the dose closest to target of 0.25 below 0.51 based on isotonic regression.The dose schedule is provided in Table 11.1 below.   
The PMT team for protocol 14036 reviewed the data: dose level 2 was closed after 2 of 3 
evaluable participants experienced DLTs an observed rate of 67%;  dose level 1, we saw 4 DLTs in 8 evaluable participants giving an observed DLT rate of 50% on this dose. Our equivalence range for DLT rate for this tria l is 20-35%, our observed rate  of 50% is 
above 35%  so we plan to de-escalate. Two participants experienced grade 4 neutrophil count decrease and 2 experienced mucositis (1 grade 3 DLT, 1 participant received 71% of Everolimus due to grade 2 which is a DLT). Thus, the team decided to amend the protocol to allow for two new dose levels at a lower dose of Eribulin, and start the next cohort of patients at dose level B1.

Table 11.2 is a pictorial representation of  the dose escalation/de-escalation guidelines 
for a target toxicity of 25% and ε1=5% ε2= 10% giving an equivalence range of 20%-
35%. The numbers of research participants treated at the current dose is provided in the 
columns and the number of research participants experiencing a DLT in the rows.  Note that this design is similar to a 3+3 design for the first 3 patients seen at a dose as it escalates if 0 study participants experience DLTs, holds if 1 experiences a DLT (33%), and de-escalates if 2 experience a DLT, di ffering from a 3+3 at sample sizes. of 6 and 
above patients as it holds at 33% toxicit y and de-escalates at 36% toxicity or above.
Based on the results of 1,000 simulated trials considering 4 toxicity probability schedules 
(Table 11.3) for the 4 doses in combination with the trial specifications listed above, the 
median sample size was 18 with 95% confidence limits of 12 and 24 and the sample size

which each dose level for each schedule was chosen as the MTD (MTD rate) and the 
average number of research participants seen at each dose (Ave # Pts.). 
11.1.2  Phase Ib portion 
In the Phase Ib portion of the trial, a Simon ’s Optimal two stage design [36] will be used 
to determine if the combination of everolimus  and eribulin results in a greater rate of 
patients event free at 4 months than eribulin alone. Based on data from the Embrace trial 
we set the 4 month EFS rate for eribulin to  be 45%. We want to determine if the 
combination has a 4 month EFS rate of 70% or higher, that is to show a 25% improvement.  Setting both the type I and type II errors to 0.1 after 12 patients (the number of patients at the RP2D dose at the end of the phase I trial), 
xif ≤ 5 patients are event free at 4 months the study will stop.  
xIf 6 or more patients are ev ent free at 4 months we will add on 15 more patients 
for a total of 27 at the RP2D.  
xIf 16 or more patients out of the 27 ar e event free we will determine the 
combination worthy of further study. Table 11.3 :  Associated rates each dose level is identified as the MTD and average number of patients  studied for 4

11.2 Sample Size and Accrual Rate 
The expected combined sample size for the Phase I/Ib trial will be 33. We anticipate 18 
study participants for Phase I portion, and 15 additional at the RP2D to finish out the Phase Ib portion of the trial (minimum sample size=6 and maximum =45 (Phase I: 24 + Phase Ib: 15 + 6 for unevaluable/ineligible  patients over the whole trial)).   
At the time of adding schedule B, 14 participants had been treated of which 12 are evaluable for dose escalation.  With the addition of 2 more doses we expect to treat 12 to 15 more patients  for a total of ~29 on the phase I portion of the trial, thus we expect the trial sample size to stay within the above planned limit of 45.  
Our accrual is just over 1 participant a mont h so the phase I portion should be completed 
after 2 years from start of the trial. We will need to follow the last patient for 4 months to 
get EFS at 4 months on the 12 patients studied at the RP2D, and expect to do the initial assessment of activity at approximately 2 1/2 years. If 6 or more of the patients studied at the RP2D are event free we will add on 15 additional patients. Based on the same accrual rate we should complete the accrual of the Phase Ib portion within approximately 12months or  and 42 months after start of the study.   
11.3 Statistical Analysis Plan 
Tables will be created to summarize all toxici ties and side effects by dose, course, organ 
and severity.  Rates and associa ted 95% confidence limits will be estimated for DLTs at 
the RP2D, EFS at 4 months and response. Kaplan Meier methods will be used to estimate 
the median and 95% confidence limits for PFS and OS. Descriptive statistics will be 
provided for the research participant demographics and PK parameters.

Version: 13 Page 56 of 7911.4 Definitions 
11.4.1 Response and progression 
Response and progression will be evaluated every 2 cycles in this study using RECIST 
Version 1.1. Changes in only the largest diameter (one-dimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST Vers ion 1.1 criteria. Note: Lesions are either 
measurable or non- measurable using the criteria provided below. The term “evaluable” in 
reference to measurability will not be used because it does not provide additional 
meaning or accuracy. 
Measurable Disease : Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm with 
conventional techniques (CT, MRI, x-ray) or as >10mm with spiral CT scan. All tumor 
measurements must be recorded in millime ters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).
Non-Measurable Disease : All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <20mm with conventional techniques or <10mm using spiral CT scan), 
are considered non-measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cu tis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, 
abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), and cystic lesions are all non-measurable.
Target Lesions : All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Ta rget lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate 
repeated measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically). A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum 
LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as re ference by which to characterize the objective 
tumor response.
Non-Target Lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-
target lesions and should also be recorded at ba seline. Non-target lesions include 
measurable lesions that exceed the maximum numbers per organ or total of all involved 
organs as well as non-measurable lesions. Measurements of these lesions are not required but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up. 
11.4.2 Guidelines for evaluation of measurable disease 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more th an 4 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment. 
Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a prev iously irradiated area might or might not be 
considered measurable. If the investigator thinks it appropriate to include them, the 
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 
2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 57 of 79conditions under which such lesions should be considered must be defined in the 
protocol.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging-based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination when both methods have been used to assess the antitumor effect of a treatment. 
Clinical Lesions : Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes). In the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. 
Chest X-Ray : Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable.
Conventional CT and MRI :These techniques should be performed with cuts of ≤10mm in 
slice thickness contiguously. Spiral CT should be performed using a 5mm contiguous 
reconstruction algorithm. This applies to tumors of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Head and neck tumors and those of extremities usually require specific protocols.
Ultrasound : When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response evaluation, 
ultrasound should not be used to measure tumor lesions. It is, however, a possible 
alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous lesions, and thyroid nodules. Ultrasound might also be useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by clinical examination.
Endoscopy and Laparoscopy : The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation has not yet been fully and widely validated. Their uses in this specific context 
require sophisticated equipment and a high level of expertise that may only be available in some centers. Therefore, the utilizat ion of such techniques for objective tumor 
response should be restricted to validation pur poses in reference centers. However, such 
techniques can be useful to confirm complete  pathological response when biopsies are 
obtained.
Tumor Markers : Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they mu st normalize for a patient to be considered 
in complete clinical response. Specific additional criteria for standardized usage of CA-
125 response in support of clinical trials are being developed.
Cytology and Histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 
2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 58 of 79stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease. 
11.4.3 Response criteria 
11.4.3.1 Evaluation of target lesions 
CR: Disappearance of all target lesions. 
PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum LD. 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions. 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started. 
11.4.3.2 Evaluation of non-target lesions 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non-targe t lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level. 
Incomplete Response/ Stable Disease (SD) : Persistence of one or more non-target 
lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non-target lesions. Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is e xceptional, in such 
circumstances the opinion of the treating  physician should prevail, and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time. Note: If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize 
for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. 
11.4.3.3 Evaluation of best overall response 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response 
assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation 
criteria.

PR Non-PD No PR

2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 59 of 79SD Non-PD No SD
PD Any Yes or No PD
Any PD Yes or No PD
Any Any Yes PD
Note: Patients with a global deterioration of  health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of dise ase progression at that time should be 
classified as having “symptomatic deteri oration.” Every effort should be made to 
document the objective progression, even after discontinuation of treatment. 
In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal 
tissue.  When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) before 
confirming the complete response status. 
11.4.3.4 Confirmatory measurem ent/duration of response 
Confirmation: To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must 
be confirmed by repeat assessments that should be performed no less than 4 weeks after 
the criteria for response are first met. In the case of SD, follow-up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after st udy entry at a minimum interval of 8 weeks.
Duration of Overall Response : The duration of overall response is measured from the 
time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented. 
Duration of Stable Disease : Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started.  
11.4.3.5 Response review 
All responses will be reviewed by an expert(s) independent of the study at the study’s 
completion. This will include simultaneous review o f the patients’ files and radiological 
images.

12.1.1   Everolimus PK sampling (whole blood) 
At each of the time points below ( Section 12.3.1 ), 5ml of anti-coagulated whole blood 
will be collected into a purple-top Vacutainer® tube containing EDTA for determination 
of everolimus. These tubes should be inverted several times to mix. Blood samples 
should be kept on ice until they can be transferred to the freezer. If you are using plastic 
Vacutainer ® tubes, the samples can be directly frozen at <-20ºC. If glass tubes are used for collection, whole blood must be transferred to polypropylene vials prior to being 
frozen at <-20 qC. In either case, plasma should n ot be separated from whole blood. 
12.1.2 Eribulin PK sampling (plasma) 
At each of the time points below ( Section 12.3.1), 5mL of anti-coagulated whole blood 
will be collected in green-top Vacutainer tubes (sodium or lithium heparin) from a site 
distal to the site of drug administration at the times shown in the table below. Blood 
samples will be kept on ice until plasma is separated from whole blood by centrifugation 
at 1500 x g (within 1 hour). Plasma will be transferred to appropriately labeled 
polypropylene tubes and stored at <-70 qC until analysis. A separate PK flow sheet will be 
used to record the actual times of blood dra ws, urine collections and other pertinent 
information. Each sample will be labeled with the patient’s name, medical record 
number, date of collection, sche duled sample collection time and actual sample collection 
time.

12.1.4 Analytical methods 
12.1.4.1 Everolimus blood concentrations 
Everolimus blood concentrations will determined in all samples in the Analytical 
Pharmacology Core Facility (APCF) at the City of Hope using a validated LC-MS/MS method. Briefly, following sample clean-up and LC separation from interfering 
substances in whole blood, a Micromass Quattro Ultima triple quadruple mass 
spectrometer operating in positive ion mode is used to detect everolimus according to the 
mass transition of m/z975.5o908.5 with tacrolimus ( m/z821.5o 768.5) as the internal 
standard. The limit of quantitation for everolimus in whole blood is 0.25ng/ml. 
12.1.4.2 Eribulin plasma levels 
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 
2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 62 of 79Eribulin plasma levels will be determined us ing a validated LC/MS/MS analytical assay 
also available in the Analytical Pharmacology Core Facility (APCF). Briefly, following 
reversed phase LC separation, eribulin a nd internal standard  (ER-076349) will be 
monitored by tandem MS with electrospray positive ionization operating at a capillary voltage of 2.9 kV and a cone voltage of 58  V. The detector is set to monitor the 
parent/daughter transitions [MH+] for E (m/z 730 to m/z 712) and IS (m/z 732 to m/z 
681). The lower limit of quantitation of the assay is 0.1ng/ml from a 200 Pl aliquot of 
plasma. 
12.1.5 Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Non-compartmental PK analyses of everolimus will be performed using statistical 
moment theory and according to the rule of linear trapezoids and statistical moment 
theory. Everolimus PK parameters (Cmax, Ctrough, AUC, CL/F, t1/2) will be determined 
for each individual and a two-stage approach  will be used to describe the study 
population PK.  
Compartmental analyses will be performed for eribulin data using ADAPT II (USC 
Biomedical Simulations Resource, Los Angeles, CA). Secondary pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g. CLsys, Vd, t1/2’s, AUC
0-∞) will be determined for each individual and a 
two-stage approach will be used to describe the study population pharmacokinetics. Population means and standard deviations will be compared to values obtained from patients treated on trials of single agent eribulin. 
12.1.6 Specimen collection/documentation 
Prior to drug administration on day 1 of cycle 1 of treatment, an indwelling heparin lock 
should be placed so that serial specimens ca n be collected. At each sampling time, 1mL 
of blood will be drawn and discarded to assure that the solution used to maintain catheter 
patency does not dilute the sample. Even if a patient has a central venous catheter, it is 
preferable for the day 8 PK samples to be drawn through a peripheral heparin lock. 
However, if the patient objects or has problems with peripheral venous access, the central venous catheter may be used for PK sampling. In the event that the central venous catheter is used, sufficient blood should be w ithdrawn before each PK sample to assure 
that the solution used to maintain catheter pa tency does not dilute the PK sample. It is 
important to document whether the sample wa s collected through a heparin lock or 
central venous catheter, especially for day 1 sampling. 
12.2 Molecular Studies 
12.2.1 Blood collection 
Blood collection will be performed from patien ts at the multiple time points for patients 
enrolled to expansion cohort (RP2D) and consented for additional blood collecton:
xPrior to the first dose of everolimus and eribulin.  
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 
2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 63 of 79x4 hours, 8 hours after dose of everolimus and eribulin, on day 1, day 4 and day 8 
of cycle 1.   
A serum specimen for proteomic analysis will consist of 7ml of blood in an uncoated 
tube (collected in the red top). This procedur e is performed under standard sterile medical 
conditions. The red tube should be kept at cold on wet ice (do not invert) and delivered within 15-30 minutes. Serum will be collected and stored at -80°C for proteomic analysis in Dr John Yim’s Laboratory using Luminex and mass spectrometry, with confirming ELISA, such as for VEGF, since everolimus and eribulin are known to influence 
angiogenesis.  
A specimen for peripheral blood mononuclear ce lls (PBMC) and plasma collection will 
consist of 10ml of blood drawn into an ACD tube (yellow top). This tube will be kept at 
room temperature and inverted 5-10 times to prevent coagulation. The tube will be brought to a designated person/lab within 15-30 minutes. The processing and storage of these samples will follow the blood separa tion protocol established in Dr Yim’s 
laboratory for the purpose of biomarker analyses as above. Lysates will be stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. 
12.2.2 Skin punch biopsy 
Two sets of optional skin punch biopsies (two biopsies per set for a total of four biopsies) 
will be performed for patients who enrolle d to dose expansion cohort (Phase Ib, RP2d) 
and consented as follows: 
xFirst set 
oBiopsy 1 (3mm diameter) will be performed one week prior to any dosing.  
oBiopsy 2 (3mm diameter) will be performed on the same site as Biopsy 1 on the day of the first dose of eribulin and everolimus; cycle 1 (prior to any dosing).  
xSecond set 
oBiopsy 3 (3mm diameter) will be performed on a new site on the day of the first dose of eribulin and everolimus; cycle 1 (prior to any dosing). 
oBiopsy 4 (3mm diameter) will be performed on the same site as Biopsy 3, one week later on the day that the second dose of eribulin is given (prior to dosing). 
Skin biopsy specimen will be placed in formalin containers and transported to Dr. John 
Yim’s lab for storage.  Specimen will be analyzed for several biomarkers in epidermal 
and vascular tissue (see Section 12.2.4). 
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 
2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 64 of 7912.2.3 Tumor biopsy 
Patient will be asked to provide a fresh tumor tissue from a newly obtained core or 
excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion upon study entry. Newly –obtained is defined as a 
specimen obtained up to 6 weeks (42 days) prior to initiation of treatment on day 1. Subjects for whom newly-obtained samples cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject safety concern) may submit an archived specimen only upon agreement from the study PI. 
Tumors may be biopsied or resected at time of disease progression and will also be 
evaluated by proteomic analysis. Tumors for wh ich frozen tissue can be obtained will be 
evaluated for breast cancer subtype using microarray analysis.  
The tumors will be pl aced in snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and sent to Dr John Yim’s 
laboratory (see Section 12.2.4 ).  
Protocol for Formaldehyde-Fixed, Paraffin  Embedded Tissue Specimens That May Have 
Been or Biopsied or Resected Befo re, During, or After Treatment 
Paraffin embedded specimens will be proce ssed in conjunction with the routine duties of 
the COH Anatomic Pathology Department. Additional collection or storage of research 
specimens outside of the storage per clinical standard of care (which will include additional tissue biopsy cores or parts of surgical tissue specimens, not required for standard pathological diagnosis) will be allowed and conducted under this protocol.  
Protocol Frozen Tissue Specimens That May Have Been or Biopsied or Resected Before, 
During, or After Treatment 
Tissue collection will be perf ormed on patients undergoing clinically indicated biopsies 
or surgical resection while at COH. Once the tissue is biopsied or surgically removed, the 
specimen will be taken to the pathology laboratory where the pathologist will ensure that the tissue is adequate for routine pathol ogy analyses (diagnosis, margin status 
assessment, and other indicated purposes). Then, and only then, if excess tissue remains, samples of that tissue will be harvested for archiving in the tissue bank. This archival tissue will be divided and placed into vials, labeled with the subject’s unique identification number (RPN) after all patient identifiers are removed, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. It will then be placed into the City of Hope tissue bank freezer (located in the Department of Pathology/or if necessary due to storage space needs in the Pathology 
Core-tracked in the same data base/LIMS) at temperatures down to -80°C. This tissue 
will remain in the freezer for at least a one-month period of time, or longer if needed, to 
ensure that there is no additional diagnostic pathologic requirement for the frozen 
specimen. During this time, no analyses will be performed on the specimen. This period of time will be known as the “Fail -Safe” time period. The Fail -Safe time period is 
intended to allow the pathologists the opportunity to withdraw banked tissue for any additional diagnostic testing they determine is necessary to patient care.  After the pathologist determines with final certaint y, by the publishing of the official final 
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 
2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 65 of 79pathologic report, that there is no diagnostic pathologic requirement for the frozen 
specimen, then the archived specimen on that patient will be released for research analyses, under appropriate research protocol approved by the IRB.  
Tissue collection for non-diagnostic/research pu rpose will preferably occur at the time of 
clinically indicated biopsies in the form of extra biopsy specimens. Alternatively, tissue 
collection for research purpose can occur under IRB-approved specific research protocols 
and after the patient signed the appropriate consent form. Patients, who are planning 
treatment with therapy prior to surgery, or have undergone definitive surgery, or are undergoing biopsy or removal of adjacent ti ssue or metastatic sites may be asked to 
consent to have an additional biopsy to co llect pre-treatment or post-treatment tumor 
specimens for banking, or alternatively, allow for access tissue collection, such as lymph 
nodes, or other tissues (for example, brain metastasis). 
These procurements can never compromise the establishment of proper diagnosis and the 
final say in allowing for such biopsies will reside with the pathologist. 
In those patients who consent, the tissue collected at biopsy or in surgery, will be placed 
fresh frozen into the COH tissue bank freezer (located in the Department of Pathology/or 
if necessary due to storage space needs in the Pathology Core-tracked in the same data 
base/LIMS at temperatures down to -80°C. In addition, if samples are available, tissue 
will be also placed in a labeled plastic vial containing RNAlater™ (“RNAlater tissue 
protect tubes”, Ambien Inc. USA) and subjected to labeling, processing, and banking procedures as described above.  
Protocol for Formalin-Preserved Tissue Specimens That May Have Been or Biopsied or 
Resected Before, During, or After Treatment  
If any additional excess tissue remains, or procured during biopsy or surgery, samples of 
that tissue will be harvested for archiving in a formalin tumor bank in the department of Pathology.  This archival tissue will be divided and placed into vials, labeled with the 
subject’s unique identification number (RPN) after all patient identifiers are removed, 
and tissues will be released for research via IRB-approved protocols.  
12.2.4 Proteomic Analysis 
All specimens will be processed at Dr. John Yim’s lab located at: 
John Yim, M.D. Lab 
1710 Flower Street, Room 154 
Beckman Research Institute/City of Hope  1500 E. Duarte Rd, Duarte, CA, 91010 
Analysis of PBMC will be performed by Western blotting for pAKT (Ser473), and AKT, 
p4E-BP1 (ser65/Thr70) and 4E-BP1, pS6K1 (Thr389) and S6K1, and pS6 (Ser235/236) 
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 
2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 66 of 79and S6. The use of PBMC’s for analysis in patients has been published.1However, 
successful demonstration of inhibition in PBMC’s can be difficult. Nevertheless, we 
would prefer to attempt correlative studies in PBMC due to greater acceptance of patients 
to blood draws rather than skin punch biopsies. It is anticipated that compliance to skin 
punch biopsies will be lower than collection of PBMC. Furthermore, we are anticipating 
a synergistic inhibition of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway that may result in more 
prominent correlative results with the combination of everolimus and eribulin which may 
improve the success rate in demonstrating inhibition. This should also apply to the skin punch biopsies.  
For patients in which pretreatment and post-treatment tumor biopsies were obtained in 
formalin immunohistochemistry analysis (IHC) will be performed for total AKT and 
pAKT at Ser473, total 4E-BP1, and p4E-BP1 at Thr70, total S6K1 and pS6K1 at Thr389, 
total S6, pS6 at Ser235/236 and Ki67. For patients in which fresh frozen tissue are available for both pretreatment and post trea tment tumor biopsies, Western blot and IHC 
will be performed for total AKT and pAKT at Ser473, total 4E-BP1, and p4E-BP1 at Thr70, total S6K1 and pS6K1 at Thr389, total S6, pS6 at Ser235/236 and Ki67.  
For patients in which fresh frozen tissue are available for both pretreatment and post 
treatment tumor biopsies, we will also use the Zeiss PALM Microlaser system for laser capture microdissection of invasive ductal cancer cells only for RNA. The microdissected sample will be catapulted to an adhesive cap and loaded to collection tubes for which total RNA isolation and ultimate microarray analysis will be performed by the Integrated Genomics Core using the Affymetrix Human Ge nome U133 Plus 2.0 array. Patterns of 
gene expression will be compared to the es tablished gene expression patterns correlating 
to 7 MBC subtypes displaying unique gene expression and ontologies. 
Skin IHC for pAKT (Ser473), and AKT, p4E-BP1 (ser65/Thr70) and 4E-BP1, pS6K1 
(Thr389) and S6K1, pS6 (Ser235/236) and S6 will  be performed on 4-uM formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded sections using rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Cell-Signaling 
Technologies). Immunohistochemical analys is of total AKT and pAKT at Ser473, total 
4E-BP1, and p4E-BP1 at Thr70, total S6K1 and pS6K1 at Thr389, total S6, pS6 at Ser235/236 and Ki67 will be performed on 4- μm formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded 
sections. A histo-score (H-score) will be  calculated by counting the percentage of 
keratinocytes from reparative epidermis or endothelial cells from vascular tissue that are positively stained with low, medium or high intensity. The final score ranging from 0 to 300 and will be calculated by the formula: H-score = (low%) × 1 + (medium%) × 2 + 
(high%) × 3, where the constants 1, 2 and 3 will be weighting factors for low, medium 
and high intensity, respectively. Changes between pre and on-therapy expression in 
paired samples will be calculated as H-score ratio and data analyzed using an analysis of 
variance one-way test.

Version: 13 Page 69 of 7914.0 Human Subject Issues 
14.1 Potential Risks to the Research Subjects 
This is a Risk Level 3 study, as defined in the “Guidance, Policy and Procedures for Data 
and Safety Monitoring for In- House Trials at City of Hope”.
http://www .infosci.coh.org/prot_office/forms/Guidance.doc. Risks are at least balanced 
by the potential benefits to subjects and the importance of the knowledge that may result. 
AEs are expected and a formal plan for monitoring and reporting these AEs is required (outlined in Section 10 ).
14.2 Potential Benefits to Research Subjects and Society 
Based on our preclinical findings, we hypothesize that the combination of everolimus and 
eribulin will have a synergistic effect and wi ll increase clinical activity in patients with 
TNBC. Previous studies of each of these drugs in MBC show acceptable toxicity, and we hypothesize that this drug combination could offer a novel approach to treat patients with TNBC MBC who are resistant to anthracyclines, taxanes or platinums. 
14.3 Alternatives 
The alternative is not to participate in the st udy. Not participating in the study will have 
no bearing on treatment or follow-up. 
14.4 Institutional Review Board 
In accordance with COH policies, an IRB that complies with the federal regulations at 45 
CFR 46 and 21 CFR 50, 56 and State of California Health and Safety code, Title 17, must 
review and approve this protocol and the i nformed consent form prior to initiation of the 
study. All institutional, NCI, Federal, and State of California regulations must be fulfilled. 
14.5 Recruitment of Subjects

Registration Procedures 
REGISTRATION PROCEDURES FOR PHASE I TRIALS 
I. REGISTRATION POLICIES 
A. Registrations for Phase I protocols will be done centrally through the City of 
Hope Data Coordinating Center (C OH DCC) in the Division of Clinical 
Research Information Support  (CRIS) between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 
4:30p.m., Monday through Friday (except holidays).    
B. Patients must begin protocol therapy within timeframe allowed per protocol in 
registration section.   
C. Pre-study laboratory tests, scans, and x-rays, must be completed prior to 
registration, within the time frame spec ified in the protocol (Staging image 
scans must be performed within 28 days prior to study entray). The eligibility 
checklist must be completed and signed by the treating physician. 
Additionally, patients must sign an in formed consent and HIPAA authorization 
form prior to registration.   
A patient failing to meet all protocol re quirements will not be registered.   
II. "HOLDING A SLOT" FOR A POTENTIAL PATIENT
x If a potential patient has been identified for a Phase I trial, the protocol nurse 
or CRA must contact the Data Coordinating Center (626-256-4673, ext. 64267 or e-mail dcc@coh.org to ve rify that a dose-level is open. 
1. If the current dose-level is open, then the Data Coordinating Center will 
reserve the "slot" for that patient for 7 days to allow sufficient time to 
obtain the informed consent. After re serving a slot and consenting the 
patient, you will have 14 days to work up the patient. (Additional time may 
be allowed for scheduling of required  tests and pending results, but the 
delay must be cleared by the DCC with the approval of the Protocol PI 
    
IRB Protocol No. 14036 Version Date: 
2/1/2017
Version: 13 Page 78 of 79before the 14 days expire).  Only on e reserved slot will be allowed per 
physician at a new dose level.  If no patient is available in that time, the 
physician that has additional patients for the study will then be given 
another slot at that dose level.  If there are any issues with slot 
reservations, the matter will be discussed with the Phase I Program 
Director and the Data Coordinating Center. 
a. The protocol nurse or CRA must call back within 14 days days to 
complete the registration or cancel the patient. 
2. If no dose-level is open (based on the criteria for dose expansion or 
escalation - as described in the pr otocol), then the Data Coordinator 
Center can indicate the anticipated da te of reopening and a slot may be 
reserved for that patient on the waiting list.  
3. No more than 3 patients may be held on the waiting list for a single 
protocol. 
a. If a patient on the waiting list becomes ineligible, then the protocol 
nurse or CRA must call to remove th e patient from the list in a timely 
manner. 
4. No slot reservation at a given dose level will be made prior to escalation 
or expansion until the DCC is notified by the Protocol PI or designee of 
the dose escalation/expansion decision. 
II. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES 
x Once a patient is eligible, all the pre-study requirements have been fulfilled, 
and informed consent obtained, then th e protocol nurse or CRA must contact 
the Data Coordinating Center (626-256-4673, ext. 64267 or e-mail 
dcc@coh.org) and EMAIL a copy of the completed eligibility checklist, 
required pre-study tests (per protocol – and may include laboratory, CT and 
pathology reports), signed Informed Consent, signed Patients' Bill of Rights and HIPAA authorization form to dcc@coh.org . 
x Upon receipt of the registration documents, the Data Coordinating 
Center will verify and confirm that the patient is eligible.

Version: 13 Page 79 of 79x  Assign a patient acce ssion number (for example, COH-001, COH-
002, etc.). 
Register the patient on study centrally (the City of Hope CRA assigned to the                             
trialwill still be responsible for accessioning via MIDAS).  If multi-site study, COH DCC 
staff will be responsible for registering parti cipating site patients at City of Hope. 
x Assign the patient to a do se level (as applicable).  
Complete and email a Confirmation of Registration form within 24 hours to 
Include the COH patient study numb er and dose level (as applicable) to the study         
 team, which will include the Principal Investigator, treating physician, protocol

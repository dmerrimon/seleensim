1.0	Objectives	
 
Primary objective: 
 
1. To evaluate the complete response (CR) rate with SGI-110 in patients with higher ri sk myelodysplastic 
syndrome (MDS).  
Secondary objectives: 
 
1. Overall response rate, survi val, transformation to AML, transfusion independence 
2. Safety and toxicity 
 
2.0	Background 	
 
2.1 Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) 
 
MDS is a heterogenous group of hematopoietic stem cell disorder s characterized by dysplastic changes 
in myeloid, erythroid, and megakaryocytic progenitors, and asso ciated with cytopenias affecting one or 
more of the three lineages (1-4). P atients often present with c omplications related to anemia (fatigue), 
neutropenia (infections) , or thrombocytopenia (bleeding). In ad dition, variable blast expansion and, less 
commonly, leukocytosis are observ ed. MDS may evolve into acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 10% 
to70% of patients. 
 
The French-American-British (F AB) classification system recogni zes four distinct subtypes of MDS, in 
addition to chronic myelomonoyctic  leukemia (CMML), based on mo rphology and percentage of marrow 
blasts: RA, RARS, RAEB, RAEB-t. Prognosis of MDS patients is po or. Patients die either from 
complications associated with cytopenias (infections and bleedi ng) or transformation  to AML. In practice, 
"low-risk" MDS may be distinguished from "high-risk" MDS by the  degree of pre-leukemic blast expansion 
together with the combination o f cytogenetic changes and degree  of cytopenia. These factors have 
allowed the establishment of an  International Prognostic Scorin g System (IPSS) to p redict survival and 
progression to AML (5).  Table 1. IPSS for MDS - Model

intermediate, other  abnormalities. 
 Based on this scoring system, patients with low-or intermediate -1 risk MDS (approximately 70% of 
patients) have an expected median survival of 3.5 to 5.7 years. Median survival for patients with intermediate-2 and high-risk MD S ranges from 0.4 - 1.2 years.

2.2 The Treatment – Hypomethylating agents or “epigenetic therapy” 
 
The standard for MDS therapy for many years has been supportive care (2,4). With the exception for 
allogeneic transplant, no moda lity has been shown to affect the  outcome of patients with MDS. Intensive 
chemotherapy was associated wi th CR rates of 40% to 60%, induct ion mortality rates of 10% to 40% and 
no improvement in survival (4). T he introduction of hypomethyla ting agents has changed the outlook of 
therapy for MDS. Azacitidine was given to 99 patients with MDS and compared with observation (n=92); 
67% had advanced-stage disease by FAB. The re sponse rate on the treatment arm was 60%: 7% CR 
and 16% PR, 37% HI. This was compar ed to 7% HI with observation  (p<.001). The median time to 
leukemic transformation or death was 21 months on treatment and  13 months on observation (p=.007). 
Median survival was 20 months fo r azacitidine and 14 months for  the control (p=.1). Quality of life 
measures were higher for azacitid ine. Azacitidine was relativel y well tolerated, although side effects 
included cytopenias and one treat ment-related death. The result s of this study led to approval of 
azacitidine in MDS and confirm ed a role for hypomethylating age nts in this disease ( 6). Similar data were 
noted with a second randomized study of azacitidine versus conv entional care in Europe (7). 
 
Decitabine is a deoxycytidine analog, which is phosphorylated to its nucleotide and incorporated into 
DNA. Once incorporated, it covalen tly binds to DNA-methyltransferases and traps the enzyme thus acting 
as an irreversible inhibitor of DNA-methyltransferase. Decitabi ne produces marked DNA hypomethylation 
(superior to azacitidine in this effect) via inhibition of DNA methyltransferase (8). At high doses, decitabine 
appears to cause DNA synthesis a rrest due to the formation of a  DNA/DNA- methyltransferase adduct, 
which results in cytotoxicity and apoptosis. At low doses, minimal cytotoxicty is observed, and treated 
cells exhibit marked reduction in  DNA-methyltransferase activit y, reduced overall and gene-specific DNA 
methylation and reactivation of silenced genes. This is associa ted with tumor suppressor gene activation, 
induction of cellular differentiation, and inhibition of clonog enic growth of leukemic progenitors. 
 
Based on in-vitro data suggesting greater hypomethylating activ ity at lower doses, a phase 1 biological 
study of decitabine was initiated at MD Anderson. To maximize t he hypomethylating e ffects of decitabine, 
multiple low dose schedules in patients with relapsed/refractor y myeloid malignancies were tried. Initially, 
patients were treated at 5 mg/m2 iv over 1 hour daily for 10 days (dose 30-fold lower than the reported 
MTD). The dose was then escalated to 10, 15, and 20 mg/m2 daily  for 10 days. Finally, a group of 
patients received 15 mg/m2 daily  for 15 days then 20 days. A to tal of 48 patients were enrolled on the 
study. Responses were seen at a ll dose levels, but 15 mg/m2 app eared to induce the most responses, 
with no further benefit for increa sing the dose or duration of administration. There were 9 complete 
remissions (CR 18%) a nd 7 partial remission s (14%), for a respo nse rate of 32%. Responses were seen 
in refra ctory/relap s
ed AML (8/ 37 = 22%), MDS (4/7 = 57%), and C ML (4/5 = 80%). In some patients who 
responded, there was a gradual diminution of blasts over 2-4 weeks, and eventual recovery of normal 
hematopoiesis at 5-6 weeks, sugge sting a non-cytotoxic mode of action for this regimen. Response 
duration ranged from 2 months to  10+ months. Therefore low-dose  decitabine was established as 
effective in myeloid malignancies, and appeared to induce remis sions in part through epigenetic 
modulation rather than cytotoxicity.   Wijermans et al. updated the results of 169 patients with MDS t reated on multiple studies with decitabine 
45-50 mg/m2 iv (continuous infus ion, or over 4 hours q 8 hours)  daily x 3 (135-150 mg/m2 per course) 
every 4-8 weeks (8). The CR rate was 20%, the overall response rate was 50%, the induction mortality 
was 8%. The median response durat ion was 9 months; the median s urvival was 15 months. There was 
no difference in response rat e by risk group (Table 2)

A study was conducted in the USA and Canada, randomizing patien ts to decitabine + supportive care vs. 
supportive care alone in MDS (in termediate-1 and above). This s tudy showed a response rate to 
decitabine of 17% (9% CR, 8% PR ) vs. 0% in the supportive care arm, and improvements in time to AML 
progression and quality of life (10). This led to approval of d ecitabine by the FDA. A similar randomized 
study in Europe of decitabine ve rsus standard of care showed de citabine to be associated with higher 
response rates and longer EFS; however survival was not improved (11). This was attributed to the 
suboptimal schedule of decitabine used, the low number of cours es given, and the treatment design 
limiting the total number of decitabine courses to a maximum of  8. 
 We have completed a randomized study of 3 dose schedules of dec itabine  100 mg/m2/course in MDS. 
Adults with advanced MDS or chr onic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) were randomized to one of 3 
decitabine schedules: 1) 20 mg/m2  IV daily x 5; 2) 20 mg/m2 sc daily x 5; and 3) 10 mg /m2 iv daily x 10. 
Randomization followed a Bayesian adaptive design. Ninety-five patients were treated (77 with MDS, all with IPSS score > 1.0, 18 with C MML). Overall 32 patients (34%)  achieved CR, and 69 (72%) had an 
objective response by the new modified International Working Group criteria. The 5-day iv schedule, which had the highest dose-intens ity, was selected as optimal; the CR rate in that arm was 39%, 
compared to 21% in the 5-day sc arm and 24% in the 10 day iv ar m (p<.05) (12). The efficacy of the new 
schedule was confirmed in a second study in the US (13).  2.3 SGI-110  
 
Further information is available in the Investigator Brochure. 
 2.3.1 General Information 
 
The active metabolite of SGI-110 (2’-deoxy-5-azacytidylyl-(3’→5 ’)-2’-deoxyguanosine sodium salt), a 
dinucleotide, is decitabine. SGI-110 is resistant to modificati on by cytidine deaminase, a common 
pathway of decitabine metabolism and deactivation. The molecula r weight of SGI-110 and decitabine are 
580 Da and 228 Da, respectively. T herefore, the molar equivalent dose of 1 mg of decitabine is 
approximately 2.5 mg of SGI-110. S GI- 110’s activity was demons trated with the same preclinical 
pharmacodynamic assays used to dem onstrate decitabine’s efficac y eg, re-expression of p15, p16, and 
MLH1 and induction of fetal hemoglobin, in vivo. In xenograft s tudies, SGI-110 demonstrates promising 
preclinical activity in both he matologic and solid tumors. 
 
In vitro evidence suggests that S GI-110 has a longer half-life than decitabine in the presence of cytidine 
deaminase. Exploratory preclinical studies demonstrate that unl ike decitabine, SGI-110 can suppress the 
polycomb repressor complex 2 whic h is involved in silencing tum or suppressor genes. These promising 
observations suggest that SGI-110 has improved pharmaceutical p roperties and biological activities that 
expand on decitabine’s current c linical utility. SGI-110 has shown to be better tolerated in mice than 
decitabine and is as effective in  vivo in inducing p16 expressi on, reducing DNA methylation at the p16 
promotor region, and retarding EJ 6 human bladder cancer tumor g rowth in athymic mice.

 The ability of SGI-110 to change global methylation status was tested by determining the methylation 
level of long interspersed nucleo tide element-1 (LINE-1) and p1 6 sequences (Figure 1). Repetitive DNA 
elements, such as LINE-1 retro- transposable elements, serve as useful markers of genome-wide 
methylation changes and have pre viously been shown to be demeth ylated upon treatment with SGI-110 
or decitabine (5-Aza-CdR). Both azacitidine and decitabine by i tself have low objective response rates.

and p16 Gene Methylation Leve ls in T-24 and HCT116 Cell Lines 
 
 
 
In both T-24 and HCT116 cells, the decrease in the level of met hylation was dose-dependent 
and comparable for SGI-110 and de citabine after 0.1 μM and 1 μM  treatment (Figure 1). In 
the figure noted above and any sub sequent places in this docume nt, S110 is the same as SGI- 
110. At 10 μM concentrations, only a small decrease in methylat ion was noted, probably due 
to side effects of high drug c oncentrations. In fact, 10 μM treatments may be too cytotoxic for 
effective demethylation to take p lace as the plating efficiency  of T-24 cells indicates. It is 
well-established that the cytoto xic dose of these demethylating agents is not ideal for optimal 
epigenetic therapy, since these dr ugs inhibit DNA methylation b est at low doses in cell lines 
as well as in the clinic.  
Next, the changes in a methylati on-silenced tumor suppressor ge ne, p16 were assayed in both 
cancer cell lines.

As shown in Figure 2, untreated T-24 bladder carcinoma cells do not express p16, and dose dependent 
increases in p16 expr ession were observed after 6 days of continuous treatment with SGI-110 or  
decitabine. After HCT116 colorec tal carcinoma cells were treate d for six days, a dose dependent increase  
in p16 expression was observed with both SG I-110 and decitabine . 
 
In Vivo Pharmacology 
 
The efficacy and safety of SGI- 110 was evaluated in several sol id tumor models and HL-60 
promyelocytic leukemia in comparison to equivalent doses of dec itabine (Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 
data on file). Female nu/nu mice  were implanted subcutaneously with HL-60 cells. Animals with 
exponentially growing tumors were randomized into 5 groups of 8  animals each to include vehicle, SGI-
110 5 mg/kg administered subcuta neously every 7 days and 2.5 mg /kg administered intraperitoneally 
Monday to Friday. Equivalent doses and schedules of decitabine 12.2 mg/kg and 6.1 mg/kg, respectively, were administered subcutaneousl y for comparison. Results from t his study are shown in Table 1 and  
Figure 3. Both SGI-110 and decitabine demonstrated equivalent a ntiproliferative activity when  
administered subcutaneously. When dosed intraperitoneally, SGI-110 seemed to have a greater effect but at the expense of higher toxicity as evidenced by more weig ht loss and death of 1 animal in the 
decitabine group.

C. General Safety (Cardia c, CNS, and Respiratory) 
 
SGI-110 was tested to examine the in vitro effects on the human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) potassium channel curre nt. Whole cell patch clamp recordings we re made on human embryonic kidney 
(HEK293) cells that were stably transfected with hERG cDNA. SGI -110 was tested at 10 μM and 300 μM.  
 SGI-110 inhibited hERG current b y 1.4 ± 0.3% (mean ± SEM) at 10  μM and by 1.0 ± 1.3% 300 μM. The 
half maximal inhibitory concentra tion (IC50) for the inhibitory  effect of SGI-110 on h ERG current was not 
calculated but was estimated to be greater than 300 μM.  
The potential neurobehavioral toxi city of SGI-110 was studied after a single subcut aneous dose of SGI-
110 (0, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) in 2 repeat dose GLP toxicology studies in rats. Functional Observational 
Battery (FOB) evaluations were conducted on 10 main study anima ls/group pre-dose ( Day -1) and 1 hour 
post-dose on Day 1 of the study  [23] [24]. There were no SGI-11 0 related changes in any of the FOB 
measurements in either study. T he noobserved-adverse-effect lev el (NOAEL) of SGI-110 on 
neurobehavioral function is 30 mg/kg.  
The potential effects of SGI-110 on respiratory function were s tudied in a GLP study  in rats. Pulmonary 
function (respiratory rate, tidal volume, and minute volume) we re monitored continuously on 8 
animals/sex/group for at least 1  hour pre-dose and at least 4 h ours post-dose. Test article or vehicle was 
administered to all groups via a single subcutaneous injection (0, 15, 30, and 60 mg/kg) SGI-110 did not 
produce mortality and had no effec t on clinical signs, respirat ory rate, tidal volume, and minute volume. 
With respect to the basic pulmona ry endpoints ev aluated in this  study, a no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) 
of at least 60 mg/kg has been established for SGI-110.

 In a Phase I study, 78 patients ( 64 AML, 14 MDS)  were enrolled in the dose escalation part: 44 patients in 
the daily x 5 regimen and 34 in  the weekly x 3 regimen. There m edian age was 69 years. Median number 
of prior regimens was 3.  
 
The PK profile demonstrated effi cient conversion of SGI-110 to decitabine as predicted from the SGI-110 
rational design, resulting in longer decitabine exposure window  (beyond 8 hours) compared to Dacogen 
IV (3-4 hours). At SGI-110 dose ra nge of 60-125 mg/m2, observed  mean decitabine AUCs (88-231 
ng*hr/mL) reach or exceed the t herapeutic range seen with 20 mg/m2 Dacogen IV (115 ng*hr/mL) while 
achieving only a small fraction of the Cmax (26-64 ng/mL vs 146  ng/mL for Dacogen IV). The effective 
half-life for decitabine after subcutaneous SGI-110 injection a ppeared to be prolonged (up to 4-fold or 
~2.4 hours) compared to Dacogen  IV (0.58 hrs). S GI-110 exposure s (AUC) increased in a dose 
proportional manner re gardless of the regimen and no accumulati on was observed.  
 Dose-related LINE-1 hypomethylation was observed in patients tr eated with the daily regimen between 18 
and 60 mg/m2; a plateau in maxim um average hypomethylation (~25 %) was evident at hig her daily doses 
(90-125 mg/m2) and therefore the BED for the daily x 5 schedule  is established at 60 mg/m2. The 25% 
average hypomethylation of LINE-1 compares favorably with that observed historically after Dacogen IV 
at the dose of 20 mg/m2 daily x 5. The extent of LINE-1 hypomethylation after weekly x 3 SGI-110 was 
inferior as the maximum averag e hypomethylation plateaued at ~8% from baseline.  
 Starting at 36 mg/m2 daily and 60 mg/m2 weekly (44 AML, and 7 MDS patients), clinical responses were 
observed: 2 CRs, 1 CRp, and 1 CR i in heavily pretreated AML pat ients; 1 mCR and 1 HI in MDS patients 
previously treated with azaciti dine. All responses were in pati ents who achieved >10% LINE-1 
hypomethylation. The most common adverse events (AEs), regardle ss of relationship to SGI-110, were 
diarrhea (21%), febrile neutrope nia (17%), fatigue/injection site pain/nausea at 15% each. The most 
common drug-related AEs were injection site pain (15%), fatigue  (8%), nausea (6%), and 
thrombocytopenia (5%). The MTD was not reached with the weekly regimen up to 125 mg/m2 weekly x 3. 
With the daily regimen, 125 mg/m2  daily x 5 resulted in 2 dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) of febrile 
neutropenia in 3 MDS patients (1 associated with bacteremia, an d the other with sepsis and 
thrombocytopenia Grade 4) while n one of the 9 patients with AML  had DLT at that dose (14). Since the 
abstract publication, maximum h ypomethylation was noted at the 60mg/m2 dose, while  clinical MTD was 
defined at 90mg/m2 dose. Therefor e the Phase II study proceeded  to compare 60 versus 90mg/m2 daily 
for 5 days in newly diagnosed MD S and AML. A further arm invest igated SGI-110 60mg/m2 daily x 10 
days in AML salvage. Finally SGI-110 60mg/m2 daily x 5 is being  evaluated in patients with MDS and 
progression on azacitidine/decitabine  therapy.  
 
The Phase II randomized study of t he biologic effective dose 60 mg/m2 daily x 5 and clinical Phase II dose 
90mg/m2 daily x 5 is ongoing. As of June 30, 2013, sixty-seven patients (50 relapsed/refractory AML, 17 
treatment naïve elderly AML) we re treated and had a minimum fol low up of 3 months. Patients were 
randomiz
ed to either 60 mg/m2 dose (32 patients) or 90 mg/m2 dose (35 patients). The median age was 
66 years (range, 22–84), 69% wer e male, and ECOG PS of 0/1/2 wa s reported in 11/47/9 patients 
respectively. Median number of p rior regimens was 2 (range, 0–1 0). Patients’ characteristics were well 
balanced between the 2 dose groups. The primary endpoint of ove rall remissions (CR, CRp, or CRi) was 
observed in 17/67 patients (25% with 95% CI, 16–37%). There wer e 8 complete remissions (CR, CRp, or 
CRi) in 50 patients with relapse d/refractory AML (16% with 95% CI, 7-29%); and 9 complete remissions 
(CR, CRp, or CRi) in 17 treatment-naïve elderly AML patients (5 3% with 95% CI, 28-77%).  Five patients 
(4 relapsed/refractory, and one  treatment-naïve elderly AML) subsequently received a stem cell 
transplant. There was no differenc e in the complete remission rate between 60 and 90 mg/m2 doses (8 
remissions in 32 patients at 60 mg/m2, and 9 remissions in 35 patients at 90 mg/m2).  LINE-1 DNA 
methylation data before and afte r treatment was available in 50  (75%) patients enrolled.  LINE-1 
demethylation ≥ 10% post treatmen t was observed in 83% and 78% in the 60 mg/m2 and 90 mg/m2, 
respectively. The median maximum LINE-1 demethylation for responders is 25% as compared to 19% for 
non-responders. The most common adv erse events (AEs) regardless of relationship to SGI-110 ≥ Grade 
3 include febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, leukop enia, neutropenia, and pneumonia. The

 90 mg/m2 dose showed a greater frequency of Grade 3/4 related AEs ≥ 10%  (anemia, febrile neutropenia, 
leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) compared to the 60 mg/m2 dose (15).   
 
 
 
2.3.4   Risks of SGI-110 Base d on Early Clinical Data 
 
For the most up to date clinical  safety information, please refer to the most recent Investigators’ Brochure. 
 
The most common risks of SGI- 110 are similar to decitabine. The se include myelosuppression 
(neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia ) and its consequences such as fever, 
infection, sepsis, bacteremia, or bleeding. While in GLP toxici ty studies with SGI-110 subcutaneous 
injections, no adverse local site reactions were noted in the m ultiple-dose rat and rabbit studies, clinical 
data indicate injection site pain, irritation, or inflammation in approximately 15% of patients. Local pain seems to be ameliorated by the use of ice packs before or after  injection, injecting SGI-110 slowly instead 
of a push, and carefully avoiding intradermal injections. 
 
2.3.5   Potential Benefits of SGI-110 
 Astex Pharmaceuticals has synt hesized more stable and potent in hibitors of DNA methylation than 
decitabine, and demonstrated that short oligonucleotides contai ning an azapyrimidine effectively inhibit 
DNA methylation in living cells. S GI-110 was synthesized by cou pling decitabine and guanosine into a 
dinucleotide in an attempt to improve the biological stability and thereby increase the in vivo efficacy of 
decitabine. Unlike decitabine, S GI-110 initially is resistant t o deamination by cytidine deaminases until it is 
converted into decitabine as a  result of cleavage of the phosph odiester linkage by phosphodiesterases. 
As such, decitabine is the active  metabolite of SGI-110. SGI-110 is a new chemical entity that may 
possess enhanced pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties compared to decitabine.  
 
The activity of SGI-110 was demonstrated with the same preclinical pharmacodynamics assays used to demonstrate the activity of decit abine, e.g., re-expression of p15, p16, and MLH1 and induction of fetal 
hemoglobin, in vivo. In vivo data demonstrate interspecies diff erences with respe ct to absorption, 
distribution, and conversion to  decitabine. In xenograft studie s, SGI-110 demonstrates promising 
nonclinical activity in hematol ogic malignancy and solid tumors . 
 As such, SGI-110 is an agent tha t holds promising activity in h ematological malignancies given 
decitabine’s proven activity in MDS and AML. The dosage form of  SGI-110 developed for use in this 
study as a subcutaneous injecti on has the potential for a more sustained release effect compared to an IV 
short infusion which, in additi on of being more convenient, may  prolong efficacy, lower toxicity and 
change the PK in a beneficial way.  
 
2.4 Rationale for Proposed Schedule  
 The best approach for patients wi th higher-risk MDS remains to be defined. Both azacitidine and 
decitabine by themselves have lo w objective response rates, and  a modest and limited survival benefit. 
From the early phase 1-2 experiences with SGI-110, it appears t o be potentially more effective and 
perhaps safer than azacitidine and decitabine. We would like to  expand our institutional experience with 
SGI-110 in newly diagnosed higher risk MDS to define more preci sely the rates of CR, overall response, 
duration of response, survival and toxicity  profiles. We will a lso assess determinants of better outcome 
with SGI-110 in MDS. The schedul e chosen is based on the Phase II expansion of SGI-110 in higher risk 
MDS whi ch treated a limited numbe r of 40 patient
s. We will use SGI-110 60mg/m2 subcutaneously daily x 
5 every 4 weeks. We would like to gain experience on the effica cy, outcome and safety in 100 patients 
with newly diagnosed MDS. The primary endpoint of the study is the objective CR rate. Secondary 
endpoints are overall response rate, rates of survival and tran sformation to AML, and toxicity profile.

4.0	Treatment 	Plan	
 
4.1  Study Treatment 
 
Patients will be treated with SGI-110 60mg/m2 subcutaneously daily x 5 eve ry 4 weeks until treatment 
failure or for a maximum of 2 y ears. Further therapy beyond 2 y ears could be extended if judged in the 
best patient interest. Treatment will be continued unless patie nts exhibit evidence of treatment failure, 
disease progression, experience an unacceptable toxicity, or th e investigator determines that 
discontinuation of treatment is in the patient best interest. 
 
All patients will be registered and entered through the Protoco l Data Management System (PDMS). 
 
4.2 Treatment Plan 
 
 SGI-110 60mg/m2 SQ daily x 5 days every 4 weeks  for a total of 24 courses. Int erval between 
courses can be extended to 8 weeks depending on toxicities, pat ient condition, and recovery of 
course.  
 
 Patients should not be taken off therapy with SGI-110 prior to  completion of the first 3 courses 
unless for unequivocal disease pr ogression while on therapy, un acceptable toxicities, or patient 
request. 
 
 Patients with stable disease a fter completion of three courses  can continue for up to 6 courses. 
Unless patients have achieved a t least a hematological improvem ent  after 6 courses, they 
should then be taken off therapy with SGI-110. 
 
December 28, 2017 
Phase 2 SGI‐110 MDS 
2013‐0901 
 
13 
  Patients may receive up to 24 courses depending on response an d tolerability of therapy. 
Courses should be repeated every 4 to 8 weeks. Continuing of SG I-110 beyond 24 courses is an 
option if judged to be in the patient best interest. 
 
 4.2.1 Supportive Measures during Treatment  
Necessary supportive measures for optimal medical care are to be given throughout the study as indicated by the treating physician's assessment of the patient 's medical need and by the institutional 
guidelines as far as established.  
 
 
4.3 Dose Modifications 
 
4.3.1 Induction, Re-Induction, and Consolidation Cycles 
 
All dose delays, reductions, and modifications for hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities will be 
assessed according to Sec tion 9, and Table 5 and 6. 
 
4.3.2 Hematologic (Blood/Bone Marrow) Toxicity  
No dose reductions, delays, or modifications are required for h ematologic toxicities during the first 2 
cycles of treatment. It is assumed  that low counts at diagnosis  are due to involvement by the disease 
process and require ther apy for improvement.  
 Patients who achieve a CR  that have not recovered periphe ral blood counts will be treated  with 
subsequent cycles and other dose modifications implemented at t he discretion of the investigator. 
 
4.3.3 Non-Hematologic Toxicity  
 Reduce SGI-110 by 25%  for grade 3-4 reversible toxicities (sam e as above). Dose reduction for 
grade 2 reversible toxicities and other dose modifications can be implemented if in the best 
interest of the patient, after disc ussion with primary investig ator. 
 
 
4.4  Infection Prophylaxis 
 
The use of prophylact ic antibacterial (e. g., levaquin), antifungals (e.g., voriconazole), and antiviral agents 
(e.g., valacyclovir) is recommende d according to institutional guidelines as established.  
 
4.4.1 Colony Stimulating Factors  
Hematopoietic growth factors (e .g., granulocyte colony stimulat ing factor [G-CSF], (er ythropoietin) can be 
administered at the treating phy sician's discretion and judgment. 
 
4.4.2 Concomitant Therapy 
 No concomitant cytotoxic therapy or investigational therapy is allowed during the study. Concomitant 
medications will be document ed in the medical record.

 5.0	Pretreatment 	Evaluations	
 
History and physical, CBC with differential and platelets, chemistry profile (total bilir ubin, serum creatinine, 
SGPT or SGOT, uric acid, LDH, potassium, magnesium) within 14 d ays of therapy start. 
 Bone marrow aspirate and/or biops y within 28 days of therapy start. The bone marrow evaluation will 
include immunophenotyping by flow cytometry and cytogenetic stu dies. 
 Pregnancy (urine or blo od) test for women of childbearing poten tial within two weeks prior of entering this 
study. Child bearing potential is  defined as not post-menopausal for 12 months or no previous surgical 
sterilization.  Screening physical assessment does not need to be repeated on C ycle 1 Day 1, if performed within 2 
days. 
6.0	Evaluation	 during	Study		
 
 CBC with differential and platel et counts weekly in the first course, then every 2 to 8 weeks 
thereafter as long as on study. N o differential is needed if the WBC is < 1.0 x 10 9/L. 
 
 Chemistry profile (at least cr eatinine, SGOT or SGPT, total bi lirubin) every 2-8 weeks while on 
therapy, then every 8 to 12 weeks as long as on study. 
 
 Bone marrow aspirate and/or bio psy at the end of course 1 and/ or 2 of SGI-110 (day 28 +/- 7 
days). If a patient is not in remission at this point, further bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy 
should be scheduled to document remission, for example at the e nd of course 6 (day 28 +/- 7 
days). 
 
 Bone marrow tests can be ordered more frequently if mandated b y development of peripheral 
blood counts. No repeat bone marr ow is necessary if non-respons e or progressive disease can 
be unequivocally diagnosed from peripheral blood tests or, in p atients with a WBC < 0.3 if the 
bone marrow test is considered no n-contributory by the investig ator at any time point. 
 
 Follow up marrow tests should include cytogenetic analysis for those patients who had 
abnormalities prior to therapy start. 
 
 Repeat physical examination (problem focused) on Day 1 (+ 3 da ys) of every cycle as long as on 
active therapy.  
 
 After completion of therapy and/or  30 days after last dose of study drug, patient s will be observed 
for survival only when off act ive treatment.  Patients will be called 30 days after last dose of study 
drug and every 2 months (+/ - 2 months) thereafter. 
 
 Optional: Blood 10cc pretreatm ent and on Day 5 +/- 2 days and Day 14 +/- 2 days to evaluate 
effect of SGI-110. 
 
 All outside labs will need to be reviewed, signed and dated by  the Principal Investigator (PI) or 
treating physician (listed on the Delegation of Authority) prio r to submission to the electronic 
medical record.  The PI or treating physician should appraise a bnormal lab results and 
determine/document clinical significance

9.0	Statistical 	Considerations 	
	
This is an open-label, phase II st udy of SGI-110 in patients wi th higher risk MDS. The primary endpoint is 
complete response (CR) in pati ents with higher risk MDS treated  with SGI-110.  CR will be first evaluated 
at any time after the first cyc le, then repeated every 3 cycles  thereafter as long as the patient continues 
treatment.   A maximum of 100 patients will be treated (3-5 per month).  
 
The method of Thall, Simon, and Estey [19] will be used to futility, monitor toxicity (adverse events and mortality at 3 months). Multc Lean Desktop (version 2.0) was us ed to generate the stopping boundaries 
and the OC tables for futility and the command stopbound in Sta ta for the toxicity monitoring. 
 
Futility Monitoring 
 
The historical data suggested a complete response rate of 10% w ith the standard of care treatment 
(AZA) and the target response rate w ith the experimental treatment ( SGI-110) is 25% . Giv en this, we will 
stop enrollment into this cohor t if the observed patients’ data  suggest that: 
 
Pr (E> H +0.15|data) < 0.025 
 
Here E and H are the complete response rate (CRR) for the experimental trea tment and historical 
standard of care treatment, respectively. That is, if at any ti me during the study we determine that there is 
a less than 2.5% chance that the average CRR improves over hist orical rate by more than 15% we will stop 
enrollment to this cohort.  E and H are assumed to follow a prior of Beta (0.2, 1.8) and Beta(100, 900), 
respectively. The stopping boundaries for CRR, based on these assumptions and monitoring conditions 
are found in Table 3. We will apply these stopping boundaries in cohorts of 10 starti ng from the 10th patient.  
For example, accrual will cease if 0 patients experiences complete response among the first 10 patients 
treated. The operating characte ristics are summarized in Table 4.  
 Table 3. Stopping boundaries for CRR

Toxicity Monitoring  
In addition, we will monitor toxicities (i.e., Grade≥3 non-hema tological toxicity) for all the patients treated. 
The toxicities will be evaluated at the end of week 12 from the start of treatment.  The probability of 
toxicity is denoted by P E. We assume P E ~ beta (0.6, 1.4).  Our stopping rule is given by the followin g 
probability statement: Pr(P E > 0.30 | data)>0.95. That is, we will stop the study if, at an y time during the

 study, we determine that there is  more than 95% chance that the toxicity is more than 30%. The stopping 
boundaries for toxicities, based on these assumptions and monit oring conditions is found in Table 5.  We 
will apply the toxicity monitoring rule in cohort size of 5 (minimum one patient). For example, accrual will 
cease if 4 patients experience toxicities among the first 5 pat ients treated. The operat ing characteristics are

Mortality rate at 3 months monitoring  
In addition, we will monitor the mortality rate at 3 months for all the patients treated. The probability of 
mortality is denoted by P E. We assume P E ~ beta (0.2, 1.8).  Our stopping rule is given by the followin g 
probability statement: Pr(P E > 0.10 | data)>0.95. That is, we will stop the study if, at an y time during the 
study, we determine that there is  more than 95% chance that the  mortality rate is more than 10%. The 
stopping boundaries for mortality rate at 3 months, based on th ese assumptions and monitoring conditions 
is found in Table 7.  We will apply the mortality monitoring rule in cohort size of 10 (minimum one patient). 
For example, accrual will cease if all 3 patients died among the first 5 patients treated. The operating characteristics are summarized in Table 8.

Statistical Analysis Plan 
 
All patients who received at l east 1 dose of the experimental treatment will be included in the intent-to-
treat analysis for efficacy and safety.  Safety data will be su mmarized using frequency and percentage, by 
organ type, grade and attributi on. Complete response and overal l response rates will be estimated along 
with the 95% credible intervals. S urvival times (overall surviv al, time to AML transformation and event-free 
survival) will be estimated usin g the Kaplan-Meier method for e ach patient cohort.  
10.0	Reporting	 Requirements 		
  
 
 Serious adverse events (SAEs) co nsidered associated with thera py should be reported to the Principal 
Investigator [ Guillermo Garcia-Manero , M.D., Telephone (713) 745-3428] within 24   hours of observing or 
learning of the event. All AEs sh ould be reported to the resear ch nurse. The principal investigator, in turn, 
will be responsible for reporti ng the event to the IRB, FDA, an d the SGI-110 manufacturer (Astex 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ) as applicable in compliance with regulatory and institutional requirements. Adverse 
events will be graded using CTC AE version 4.03 (Appendix D) 
 
 
December 28, 2017

 Serious and unexpected adverse events will be reported accordin gly to MDACC guidelines. (Appendix C 
entitled "Leukemia Specific AE Recording Guidelines (09/2009)-L eukemia specific Adverse Event 
Recording and Reporting Guidelin es". These events will be repor ted to the study chairman, who in turn 
will notify the Clinical Researc h Compliance office and the MDA CC IRB. The Clinical Research 
Compliance Office will be responsi ble to notify the FDA accordi ng to 21CFR312.32. 
 
 The investigator or physician designee is responsible for veri fying and providing source 
documentation for all adverse ev ents and assigning the attribut ion for each event for all subjects 
enrolled on the trial. 
 Grade 3 or 4 related and/or unexpected adverse events and prot ocol specific data will be entered 
into PDMS/CORe. PDMS/CORe will be  used as the elec tronic case r eport form for this protocol. 
 
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING FOR MD ANDE RSON – IND SPONSORED  PROTOCOLS 
 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE)  
 
An adverse event or suspected adv erse reaction is considered “s erious” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or the sponsor, i t results in any of the following  outcomes: 
 Death 
 A life-threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse exper ience that places the patient, in 
the view of the initial report er, at immediate risk of death fr om the adverse experience as it 
occurred. It does not include an adv erse experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death. 
 Inpatient hospitalization or pro longation of existing hospital ization 
 A persistent or significant inc apacity or substantial disrupti on of the ability to c onduct normal life 
functions. 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require hospitalization may be 
considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or su rgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical ev ents include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dysc rasias or convulsions that do not result 
in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug depend ency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32). 
 Important medical events as defined above, may also be consider ed serious adverse events. 
Any important medical event can and should be reported as an SA E if deemed appropriate 
by the Principal Investigator o r the IND Sponsor, IND Office. 
 
 All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meet ing the definition of a SAE must be 
reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and proce dures outlined in “The University 
of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Boar d Policy for Investigators on 
Reporting Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and Devices”.  Un less stated otherwise in the 
protocol, all SAEs, expected or  unexpected, must be reported to  the IND Office, regardless of 
attribution (within 5 working days of knowledge of the event). 
 
 All life-threatening or fatal events,  that are unexpected, and related  to the study drug, must have 
a written report submitted within 24 hours  (next working day) of knowledge of the event to the 
Safety Project Manager in the IND Office.

  Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) w ill be utilized for safety 
reporting to the IND Office and MDACC IRB.  
 Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the fi rst protocol-specific 
intervention,  until 30 days after the last dose of drug, unless the participant withdraws 
consent. Serious adverse events must be followed until clinical  recovery is complete and 
laboratory tests have returned to baseline, progression of the event has stabilized, or there 
has been acceptable resolution of the event. 
 
 Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the 3 0 day time period that are 
related to the study treatment must be reported to the IND Offi ce. This may include the 
development of a secondary malignancy. 
 
Reporting to FDA 
Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by the IND  Sponsor (Safety Project Manager IND Office) 
according to 21 CFR 312.32. 
It is the responsibility of the PI and the research team to ens ure serious adverse events are reported 
according to the Code of Federal Regulations, Good Clinical Practices, the protocol guidelines, the 
sponsor’s guidelines, and Instit utional Review Board policy. 
Investigator Communication with Supporting Companies:

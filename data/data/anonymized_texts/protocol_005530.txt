While the below message may not be applicable to this study, we are including this message on all 
study actions so that the Harvard research community is aware of current guidance.
 
The resumption of in-person research will occur in phases with timing based on governmental policies 
and the state of the disease, the health care system, and society at large. The principal investigator (PI) of 
a research program/study will be required to craft a plan outlining the COVID-19 precautions that will be 
undertaken for their research. The researcher’s plans will be subject to School/Departmental review and 
approval. No in-person research can begin until a researcher’s plan receives School/Departmental 
approval.

Instructions on how to get approval for in-person research from your School/Department may be 
found here -  https://cuhs.harvard.edu/instructions-returning-person-human-subjects-
research?admin_panel=1  You will also find on this site an outlined process, guidance, templates, and 
standard operating procedure examples to assist researchers and their Schools/Departments to get in-
person human subjects research up and running.
 
NOTE!
 
Should a researcher receive approval from their School/Department for in-person human 
subjects research and their study is taking place at a location outside of Harvard, it is 
important that these studies follow any guidelines or instructions from the specific facility 
where in-person research would occur. As some research may occur in another state, with 
another institution, or under the direction of another IRB (as in a reliance agreement 
situation), this is especially important.  It is the responsibility of the Study Team to 
keep apprised of potential restrictions and conduct their study accordingly.
 
Harvard Affiliates should note any travel and other restrictions that are in place by 
visiting the Harvard COVID-19 website - https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus.  
 
Please know that the default for all research involving in-person contact is to be paused. To the 
extent possible, study activities that can be done remotely by telephone or electronically, such as 
screening or follow-up, should be done in this way.
 
Should further restrictions pertaining to contact with study subjects be imposed at any time, it is 
the responsibility of the study team to follow guidance regarding when to pause a study and contact 
the HUA IRB.
 
Monitor the HUA IRB website < https://cuhs.harvard.edu/questions-about-covid-19-and-your-research>

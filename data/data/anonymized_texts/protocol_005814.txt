tenderness , is observed by a physician, and which is not due to primarily mechanical 
disorders or  to other identifiable causes.

If the patient meets the operational case definition, and the treating physician feels that one of 
the CTPs is appropriate for the patie nt, one of the following CTPs should be chosen.  
d. STEP -UP CTP  
Initiation ( baseline  
to 3 months)  Begin DMARD (methotrexate, sulfasalazine, or leflunomide)

 Prednisone  
 Intra-articular corticosteroid injections  
 Unscheduled clinic visit at 1 -2 months if no response or worsened 
to increase therapy.  
Condition

prior visit is suggested.  
Condition

STOP JIA Guide Version 15 DEC 2017   Page 6 of 15 MD Global & Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS)  Guidelines  
 
• The MD global should consider only children with PJIA as defined in the enrollment 
criteria (e.g. think about disease severity relative only to other children with PJIA, not 
across all categories of JIA).  
 
• MD Global of 0  should be used to indicate that the child has no evidence of arthritis, 
uveitis, enthesitis or tenosynovitis based on information from the current clinic visit that is 
available during the visit; this may include clinical exam, imaging studies and labs.  
 
• MD Global of 10  should be used to indicate severe, diffuse active arthritis, as well as 
severity of uveitis and enthesitis or tenosynovitis based on clinical exam and/or imaging 
studies associated with the current clinic visit, if available duri ng the clinic visit.  
 
Calculating the cJADAS10:  
The cJADAS10  should be calculated at the point of care . It is  a simple sum of :  
 
MD Global + Total Active Joint Count ( 10 maximum) + Parent Global  = ________  
 
Disease activity cut -offs:  
• Low disease activity ≤ 2.5  
• Moderate disease activity 2.51 -8.5 
• High disease activity > 8.5  
Caveats:  
• Patients may achieve moderate disease a ctivity if MD  Global = 0, 
AJC=0, and Parent Global >2.5 .  
• Clinical judgment  still required for interpretation of values .

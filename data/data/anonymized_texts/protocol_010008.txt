Amendment 5 08 September 2016
The purpose of this amendment is to:
●Update Section 1.2, Synopsis, Section 5.1, Overall Study Design and Plan:  
Description, and Section 5.3.1.1 , Study Procedures, to add a Survival Extended 
Access period to the trial.
Rationale:   AbbVie feels it is an ethical approach to continue to offer 
venetoclax in the study setting to those subjects who are continuing to derive 
clinical benefit and have not withdrawn consent.  The original study design 
allowed subjects to remain on study drug only up to 2 years following last subject first dose.  The Extended Access period will allow subjects to continue 
on venetoclax until disease progression; up to 5 years following last subject 
first dose (12 May 2020); or until a subject chooses to switch to commercial supply.
●Update Section 1.2, Synopsis, to clarify that study objectives, with the 
exception of Safety, will cease to be ev aluated beyond 2 years after last subj ect 
first dose.
Rationale:   The Survival Extended Access period is intended only to collect 
safety and long-term MRD data for analyses.

●Update Section 5.1, Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description, Post-
Treatment Visits, and Section 5.3.1.1 , Study Procedures, Post-Treatment, to 
discontinue post-treatment visits effective 12 May 2017.
Rationale:   As very few subjects entered the Post-Treatment period, there is 
little data to provide any meaningful, Statistical analyses.  Subjects will 
continue to be followed in Survival until disease progression or withdrawal of 
consent.
●Update Table 2 , Excluded and Cautionary Medications/Food Items.
Rationale:   Additional information has been added regarding excluded and 
cautionary medications/food.
●Update Table 4 , Study Activities, to include the activities to be performed 
during the Survival period.
Rationale:   The Survival period was not previously included in the table, so it 
has been updated to include the activities to be performed during the Survival 
Extended Access visits.
●Update Section 5.3.1.1 , Study Procedures, Quantitative Minimal Residual 
Disease (MRD) Assessment, to add the collection of blood specimen for MRD PCR every 12 weeks during the Survival Extended Access period for subjects who qualify.
Rationale: AbbVie would like to obtain additional, long-term MRD data for 
analysis. 
●Update Section 5.4.1 , Discontinuation of Individual Subjects, to allow subjects 
with progressive disease who remain on venetoclax the ability to receive other 
approved treatment agents for CLL in addition to venetoclax.
Rationale:   CLL patients with 17p deletion have limited options for treatment.  
The addition of other approved CLL agents may aid to slow the disease 
progression and extend the life of the subject.
●Update Section 6.0, Adverse Events, to reflect changes made to the AbbVie 
protocol template.
Rationale: Additional information has been added regarding medical and 
product complaints.
●Update Section 6.1.3 , Relationship to Study Drug.
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20

Rationale:  Definitions for adverse event causality have been updated to 
provide a more robust description.
●Update Section 6.1.6 , Adverse Event Reporting.
Rationale: Updated to reflect change in AbbVie medical monitor and to 
remove the Oncology Safety Management phone contact number.
●Update Section 7.0, Protocol Deviations.
Rationale: Updated to reflect changes in AbbVie Program Lead and medical 
monitor.
●Update Section 8.1.1.2.7 , Additional Exploratory Efficacy Analyses, and 
Section 8.1.4.1 , Additional Exploratory Efficacy Analyses, to confirm that 
MRD-Flow data for exploratory analysis will not be collected during the 
survival extended access portion of the study.
Rationale:   Only safety and MRD-PCR will be assessed during the extended 
access portion of the study.

1.2 Synopsis
AbbVie Inc. Protocol Number:   M13-982
Name of Study Drug:   Venetoclax Phase of Development:   2
Name of Active Ingredient:  Not available Date of Protocol Synopsis: 28 February 2017
Protocol Title:   A Phase 2 Open-Label Study of the Eff icacy of ABT-199 (GDC-0199) in Subjects with 
Relapsed/Refractory or Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Harboring the 
17p Deletion
Main Cohort Objectives:
Primary objective:  The primary objective of this cohort is to evaluate the efficacy of venetoclax monotherapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) harboring the 17p deletion.  Efficacy will be measured by overall response rate (ORR).
Secondary objectives:   The secondary objectives are to evaluate the complete remission rate (CR), 
partial remission rate (PR), duration of overall response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to 
progression (TTP), overall survival (OS) and percent of subjects who move on to stem cell transplant.  The safety and tolerability of venetoclax in subjects with relapsed or refractory CLL harboring 17p deletion will also be evaluated.
Safety Expansion Cohort Objectives:
Primary objective:  A safety expansion cohort is being added with the primary objective of evaluating 
the safety of venetoclax in approximately 50 subjects with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated CLL harboring 17p deletion per the updated TLS prophylaxis and management measures.
Secondary objectives:   The secondary objectives are to evaluate ORR, CR rate, PR rate, duration of 
overall response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), overall survival 
(OS), and percent of subjects who move on to stem cell transplant.
Exploratory objectives (both main and safety expansion cohorts):   Time to next anti-CLL treatment 
(TTNT), minimal residual disease (MRD) assessed in the peripheral blood and/or bone marrow (BM), 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenetics and biomarkers will be evaluated as exploratory objectives.  Health Economic and Patient-Reported Outcome Measures will include the MDASI (measure of subject reported symptoms), the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ CLL16 (a measure of health related quality of life specific to CLL) and the EQ-5D-5L (measure of general health status) and EQ-5D-VAS.
Note:  All study objectives, with the exception of Safety and MRD analyses, will cease to be evaluated beyond 2 years after last subject first dose.
Investigators:   Multicenter
Study Sites:   Approximately 60 research sites globally .
Study Population:   
Main Cohort:  Relapsed or refractory CLL subjects harboring 17p deletion
Safety Expansion Cohort:  Relapsed/refractory or previously untreated CLL subjects harboring 
17p deletion (previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia harboring 17p deletion patients will not be enrolled in Germany)
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 150 (100 subjects in the main cohort and 
50 subjects in the safety expansion cohort)

Methodology:   This is a Phase 2, open label, multicenter, study evaluating the efficacy of venetoclax in 
relapsed/refractory or previously untreated subjects with CLL harboring 17p13 deletion.  The main 
cohort will enroll approximately 100 subjects with relapsed/refractory CLL harboring 17p13 deletion to assess efficacy and safety of venetoclax.  The safety expansion cohort will enroll approximately 50 subjects with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated CLL harboring 17p13 deletion to assess the updated TLS prophylaxis measures.  The detection of 17p13 deletion (17p del) will be determined by the local laboratory and/or by the central laboratory which uses the Vysis CLL FISH probe kit.  Screening must be performed within 28 days of study drug administration.  CT scan must be performed within 35 days prior to study drug administration.  A bone marrow biopsy and aspirate will also be performed at Screening (within 35 days prior to study drug administration), and again in coordination with CT scans, to confirm complete remission.  Study visits will be conducted on Days 1 and 2 of each week through Week 5, then on Day 1 of every 4 weeks thereafter, beginning with Week 8 (e.g., Weeks 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, etc.) until Week 36, and then Day 1 of every 12 weeks thereafter.

Investigational Product: Venetoclax:  10 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg tablet
Venetoclax will be administered orally once daily (QD), continuously.  
Each dose of venetoclax should be taken with approximately 240 mL 
of water within 30 minutes after the completion of breakfast or the subject's first meal of the day.  To mitigate the risk for TLS, a lead-in period will be employed to evaluate a step wise dose escalation.
Dose – Main Cohort: Subjects will be admitted to the hospital and begin the lead-in period with an initial test dose of 20 mg venetoclax on Week 1 Day 1.  If no significant findings occur within 24 hours, then a test dose of 50 mg will be administered on Week 1 Day 2 followed by 50 mg venetoclax QD for 5 days (Week 1 Day 3 – Day 7).  If significant findings occur within 24 hours on Week 1 Day 1, the 20 mg dose will be maintained for 1 week prior to dose escalation to 50 mg on Week 2 Day 1 – 7.
After a week at 50 mg, the following dose escalation will proceed with 
weekly dose escalations →100 mg →200 mg →400 mg (or 
additional lead-in steps to designated 400 mg dose), as tolerated.
A lower starting dose and/or modification to the lead-in regimen may 
be implemented for individual subject(s) at particularly high risk for TLS.
Dose – Safety Expansion 
Cohort:Single daily doses QD starting with 20 mg; dose escalations will proceed weekly →50 mg →100 mg →200 mg →400 mg, as 
tolerated.
A lower starting dose and/or modification to the lead-in regimen may 
be implemented for individual subject(s) at particularly high risk for TLS.
Mode of Administration: Oral
Duration of Treatment:   Subjects may continue receiving study drug for up to 2 years following the 
date of the last subject enrolled provided they continue to tolerate the drug, have no evidence of disease progression, and do not meet any of the criteria for subject discontinuation.  The anticipated median treatment duration is approximately 24 months or greater.

M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
11
Survival Assessments:   Survival information will be collected every 3 months (±7 days) for up to 
5 years after the last subject has been enrolled for subjects who have not withdrawn consent.
Richter's Transformation and Second Primary Malignancies Assessment:   Information on Richter's 
Transformation and second primary malignancies will be collected every 3 months for up to 5 years after 
the last subject has been enrolled for subjects who have not withdrawn consent.
Survival – Extended Access:   For subjects who continue to derive benefit from venetoclax treatment 
2 years following the date of the last subject enrolled, AbbVie will provide venetoclax un til the subject 
develops disease progression or until 5 years following the date of last subject enrolled (12 May 2020).
Criteria for Evaluation:Efficacy:
Response will be assessed by the investigator, based on laboratory values, physical examinations, CT 
scans (or MRI if CT scan is medically contraindicated), and bone marrow examinations, using the 2008 Modified IWCLL NCI-WG Guidelines for Tumor Response.
In addition to being reviewed by the investigator and/or site staff, an independent review will be 
performed to assess tumor response and disease progression.  Clinical data and radiographic scans will be interpreted according to 2008 Modified IWCLL NCI-WG Guidelines for Tumor Response.  The independent review facility will provide instructions regarding the preparation and shipment of the data.  Interpretations from the independent review will not be sent to the site.  Subject treatment management will be based on review by the local investigator and/or site staff.
All measurable disease must be documented at screening by physical examination, laboratory testing and 
CT scan (or MRI if CT is medically contraindicated), and bone marrow.
During the study, subjects will be assessed at each visit by a physical examination and laboratory testing.  
Clinical disease assessments will take place at baseline, monthly for the first 9 months and then every 3 months until disease progression, death, discontinuation from the study, or study completion.
Additional radiographic studies will be performed as described below:
A CT scan must be performed to confirm the response no earlier than 8 weeks after a response is 
determined by clinical criteria (laboratory results and physical exam).  For consistency, the same method of imaging should be performed for a subject t hroughout the study.
For determination of CR, both the CT scan and bone marrow are required to be negative.
A CT scan (or MRI if CT is medically contraindicated), will be also performed in all subjects at 
36 weeks from the beginning of the study.
If a subject exhibits clinical signs of possible disease progression (i.e., increased or de novo enlargement 
of liver, spleen or lymph nodes on physical examination) without an increase in lymphocytes meeting PD criteria, then additional assessments including contrast enhanced CT scan (or MRI) and/or bone marrow must be performed within 2 weeks to confirm or rule out PD.

Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
MRD:
MRD for enumeration of CLL cells will be assessed using IWG-CLL recommended methods of flow 
cytometry and/or ASO-PCR. The ERIC panel based flow cytometry will be assessed by regional 
laboratories on available samples.  Specimens (bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood) for MRD analysis should be collected at the same time as the bone marrow aspirate and biopsy performed for tumor assessments to confirm the CR/CRi.  If MRD negativity is achieved in the bone marrow no further MRD analyses are required.  Otherwise, MRD should be assessed at 12-week intervals thereafter (in 
peripheral blood) until MRD negativity is achieved.  Once MRD negativity is achieved and confirmed in 
peripheral blood (e.g., two MRD negative consecutive peripheral blood samples), a bone marrow aspirate specimen will again be collected for analysis of MRD levels to confirm the peripheral blood 
negativity.
Subjects who meet all criteria for CR/CRi with the exception of a node(s) that is enlarged around
1.5 – 2 cm may also have a bone marrow performed and MRD assessment.  If a bone marrow and MRD assessment was not performed at the time of the confir matory CT scan, then they should be performed 
after the Week 36 Day 1 CT scan.  If MRD negativity is achieved in the bone marrow no further MRD analyses are required.  Otherwise, MRD should be assessed at 12-week intervals thereafter (in peripheral blood) until MRD negativity is achieved.  Once MRD negativity is achieved and confirmed in peripheral blood (e.g., two MRD negative consecutive peripheral blood samples), a bone marrow aspirate specimen will again be collected for analysis of MRD levels to confirm the peripheral blood negativity.
Pharmacokinetic:
Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected for venetoclax at designated time points throughout the study.  
Values for the PK parameters of venetoclax, including the apparent clearance (CL/F) and the apparent volume of distribution (V/F), may be determined using a population PK approach.  Additional parameters may be calculated if useful in the interpretation of the data.
Biomarkers:
Several putative biomarkers of efficacy and response may be evaluated in this st udy with the goal of 
defining the relationship between various disease markers and disease status that may predict the 
subject's response to therapy.  Exploratory research analyses may not be included in the clinical study report.
Pharmacogenetic:
DNA samples may be analyzed for genetic factors contributing to the subject's response to venetoclax.
Safety:Adverse event monitoring, vital signs, physical examination, ECG, and laboratory assessments will be 
evaluated.  Guidelines for the prophylaxis, monitoring and management of TLS are provided.
Statistical Methods:
Main Cohort:
Efficacy:
The following efficacy analyses will be analyzed:  ORR, CR rate, PR rate, duration of overall response, 
progression-free survival, event free survival, time to progression, time to first response, time to 50% reduction in ALC, overall survival and percent of subjects who move on to stem cell transplant.  Additional efficacy analyses will include time to next anti-CLL treatment, rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity status, and Health Economic and Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) measures.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Safety Expansion Cohort:
Secondary Efficacy:
The following secondary efficacy analyses will be analyzed:  ORR, CR rate, PR rate, duration of overall 
response, progression-free survival, event free survival, time to progression, time to first response, time to 50% reduction in ALC, overall survival, and percent of subjects who move on to stem cell transplant.  Additional efficacy analyses will include time to next anti-CLL treatment, rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity status, and Health Economic and Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) measures.
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic:
An analysis will be performed using a nonlinear  mixed-effect population modeling approach with 
NONMEM software to describe the disposition of venetoclax, to identify significant covariates and 
explore relationship between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics by combining data from this study with other venetoclax clinical studies.  Additional analyses may be performed if useful in the interpretation of the data.
Safety:
A safety analysis will be performed for all subjects participating in the study who took at least one dose 
of study drug for each cohort (main and safety expansion).  For the study as a whole, adverse events will be evaluated and summarized.  Laboratory values and vital signs will be explored for trends and summarized.

3.0 Introduction
Bcl-2 Family Proteins
The Bcl-2 family proteins are important regulators of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway.  
The Bcl-2 oncogene was first identified in follicular lymphoma where the t(14;18) 
chromosomal translocation results in signif icant over-expression of th e protein in B-cells.  
The Bcl-2 family of genes encodes a family of closely related proteins that possess either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic  activity and share up to four Bcl-2 Homology (BH) 
domains.
1-4  Bcl-2 overexpression is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of some types 
of lymphoid malignancies.  Bcl-2 is also overexpressed in acute and chronic leukemias.  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a ge netic disease where the microRNAs miR15a 
and miR16-1 that negatively regulate the transcription of Bc l-2 are deleted or 
down-regulated, resulting in uncontrolled expression of Bcl-2.
5,6
Venetoclax in vitro/in vivo Activity and Preclinical Pharmacokinetic Profile
Venetoclax is a novel, orally available small mo lecule Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor that 
binds with > 500-fold higher affinity (K i< 0.010 nM) to Bcl-2 and with lower affinity to 
other Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-X L(Ki– 48 nM) and Bcl-w (K i– 245 nM).7  
Overexpression of antiapoptotic Bc l-2 family proteins is associ ated with increased 
resistance to chemotherapy, and antagonism of the action of these proteins might enhance 
response to such therapy and overcome resistance.  Antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members 
are associated with tumor initiation, dis ease progression, and drug resistance, and making 
them compelling targets for antitumor therapy.
In vitro, venetoclax demonstrated broad cell killing activity against a panel of lymphoma 
and leukemia cells including B-cell follicular lymphomas (FLs), mantle cell lymphomas 
(MCLs), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma s (DLBCLs), and acute myeloid leukemias 
(AMLs).  Venetoclax was especially potent against cell lines expressing high levels of Bcl-2.  Leukemia and lymphoma cell lines bearing the t(14;18) translocation were significantly more sensitive to venetoclax than non-mutated cell lines.

M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20

Venetoclax inhibited subcutaneous murine xenograft growth of human tumor cell lines 
derived from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL).  The drug was also active in a model of disseminated ALL.
The pharmacokinetic profile of venetoclax was evaluated in multiple animal species.  In 
mouse, rat, monkey and dog, the venetoclax pharmacokinetic profile was characterized by low plasma clearance and low volumes of distribution.  Half-lives ranged from 2.2 hours in monkey to 12 hours in dog.  Food had a marked effect on the oral bioavailability in dog.
Venetoclax has high protein binding to human, rat, dog, and monkey plasma proteins 
(> 99.9%).  In rats, venetoclax was widely distributed into liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, lungs, small intestine, and white fat, but was poorly distributed in testes, brain, muscle, and bone.  Metabolism was the major route of elimination with biliary excretion of the parent drug playing the secondary role in rats.  Venetoclax showed moderate metabolic stability in in vitro hep atic systems across species tested, except for low to moder ate 
stability in dog hepatocytes.
In vivo, venetoclax was metabolized by CYP3A4; it was not a potent inhibitor of 
CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 (IC
50> 30 μ M); it did not induce 
CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 at concentrations up to 10 μM.  Venetoclax is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP.  Studies in Oatp1a/b cluster KO mice indicated that venetoclax may be an OATP substrate.  Active uptake of venetoclax or M27 metabolite was not observed in cells overexpressing OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or OCT1.  Venetoclax is a P-gp, BCRP and OATP1B1 inhibitor in vitro.
Venetoclax exhibited potent activity against patient-derived CLL cells treated ex vivo, 
killing these cells with an average concentration required for 50% effect (EC
50) of 
0.006μM (n = 35; note that not all subject samp les are from venetoclax trials).  
Venetoclax was equally potent against the subset of CLL samples bearing the high-risk 17p deletion, with an average EC
50of 0.008μM (n = 5), indicating that venetoclax may 
have a significant utility in treating sub jects with this high-risk disease.

Venetoclax Nonclinical Toxicology
Venetoclax has been assessed in repeated-dose general toxicology studies, and in genetic, 
developmental/reproductive, phototoxicity, and safety pharmacology studies.
The primary toxicities associated with repeat-dose administration of venetoclax were 
effects on the hematologic system (decreased lymphocytes and red blood cell [RBC] mass) in mice, rats and dogs, the male reproductive system (testicular germ cell depletion in dogs) and embryofetal toxicity in mice.   Other noteworthy findings were epithelial 
single cell necrosis in multiple tissues and hair coat color change, both in dogs.
In mice, rats, and dogs, venetoclax produced robust decreases in lymphocytes in the 
peripheral blood (up to 75% in mice, 64% in rats, and 81% in dogs) and in lymphoid 
tissues.  These findings are consistent with the expected pharmacologic effects of venetoclax (a selective Bcl-2 inhibitor).
8  In mice, total lymphocyte counts at 
600 mg/kg/day after 4 weeks of dosing were minimally decreased 21% to 6% relative to concurrent controls at the end of the 4-week recovery period.  In dogs, the recovery of peripheral blood decreases in total lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets (CD4+ T- cells 
and CD8+ T-cells and [CD21+] mature B cells) was prolonged, requiring up to 18 weeks after a single dose or after completion of 2 weeks of dosing.  B-cells were the most sensitive lymphocyte subtype based on the magnitude of decrease (> 90%) and/or the length of time required for recovery.  Lymphocy te decreases in lymphoid tissues were 
reversible in mice and dogs.  Venetoclax produced dose-related decreases in RBC mass due to decreased cellular hemoglobin in mice and dogs; these effects were adverse at the highest dosages in the 4-week mouse and dog studies and were reversible.  In studies to select carcinogenicity dose levels, RBC mass decreases were also observed in rats and were generally more severe than in mice or dogs.  Venetoclax produced adverse, non-dose related microscopic findings of testicular germ cell depletion in dogs at all doses tested; reversibility was not observed following a 4-week recovery period.  There were no 
testicular effects in mice.  Venetoclax resulted in increased post-implantation loss and decreased fetal body weights in the mouse embryo f etal development study at the highest 
dosage administered (150 mg/kg/day); the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
27
was defined at the mid dose of 50 mg/kg/day.  In mice and rabbits, venetoclax was not 
teratogenic, and there were no other effects on development or fertility.
Additional noteworthy effects of venetoclax included white hair coat discoloration in dogs 
(occurring after approximately 3 months of dosing in the 9-month study) and minimal to 
mild single cell necrosis in multiple epith elial tissu es (e.g., gallbladder and exocrine 
pancreas) in dogs.  None of these effects was considered to be adverse.
There was no evidence of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity of venetoclax, and there was 
no evidence of cutaneous phototoxicity of ven etoclax in an in vivo study in Crl:SKH1- hr 
female hairless mice.
Other minor effects of venetoclax were observed in dogs.  (1) At the high dosage of 
150 mg/kg/day in the 4-week study had clinical signs of swelling of the skin on the ears, head (cranial area), and forepaws and/or hindpaws.  Most but not all animals (8 of 10 dogs) were affected, and in 3 dogs the swelling reaction was observed after the first dose.  The clinical signs were limited to  the 150 mg/kg/dosage, were transient and 
sporadic in occurrence, and were absent duri ng the recovery period.  A mechanistic basis 
for the swelling reactions was not established, but the clinical signs were mild to moderate in severity and reversible, and there were no signs of anaphylaxis.  (2) Dose-related, transient post dose emesis, increased saliv ation, and fecal alterations (unformed or watery 
feces) were observed at dosages of ≥ 5 mg/kg/day.  These clinical signs were present 
throughout the dosing phase, but were not dose- limiting and were not observed in the 
recovery phase.  In the 9-month dog study, non-adverse decreases in mean body weight and body weight gain, associated with decr eases in food consumption, were observed at 
≥2 mg/kg/day.
M27 is a major human metabolite of venetoclax.  Although observed in mice and dogs, M27 is present at much lower levels (0.05- t o 0.09-fold), as compared with steady-state 
levels in humans, and therefore is a disproportionate metabolite.  By in silico analysis, M27 does not generate new alerts for mutagenicity, as compared with the venetoclax parent compound.  M27 shows low in vitro potency (at least 58-fold less than parent) and 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
28
produced no evidence of in vitro genotoxicity in Ames and chromosome aberration 
assays.  In a secondary pharmacology r eceptor panel screening study, M27 produced 
significant displacement of control-specific binding at the delta-opioid receptor (DOP K
i= 0.65 μM); however, when evaluated in a functional assay, agonist or antagonist 
activity was not observed at the DOP receptor up to a maximum concentration of 10 μM.  
No CNS or respiratory adverse events that could be attributed to off-target receptor-mediated pharmacologic effects of M27 have been observed in clinical trial subjects.
Venetoclax was tested in a battery of safety pharmacology assays, and produced no 
effects in the CNS/neurobehavioral or respiratory studies in mice at oral doses up to and including the highest dose of 600 mg/kg.  No effects on QTc were observed up to a maximum plasma concentration of 46 μg/mL in dogs.  In conscious dogs, venetoclax did 
not produce any cardiovascular effects up to and including the highest oral dose of 150 mg/kg (C
max= 16 μg/mL).  In the anesthetized dog at higher plasma concentrations, 
venetoclax produced mild reductions in myoca rdial contractility (6% – 13%) and cardiac 
output (–11% to –19%) at plasma concentrations of ≥ 16 μ g/mL and ≥  32 μ g/mL, 
respectively.  These concentrations are greater than the plasma concentration of venetoclax in oncology subjects (2.8 μ g/mL at the 600 mg dose).
On the basis of nonclinical safety pharmacology and toxicology evaluations of venetoclax, and on the basis of nonclinical and human studies of related antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein inhibitors, potential mechanism-based toxicities may include lymphopenia and neutropenia,
9signs of tumor lysis, reduction in red cell mass, decreased 
spermatogenesis, skin swelling, and hair hypopigmentation.  Although no effects of venetoclax on female reproductive tissues have been observed in general repeat-dose toxicology studies, embryo-fetal toxicity studies in animals have identified a fetal toxicity risk.  Thrombocytopenia has not been observed in toxicology studies in mice and dogs.  These findings are consistent with venetoclax as a Bcl-2 specific (Bcl-X
Lsparing) 
inhibitor.  Consequently, thrombocytopenia is not expected to be a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) clinically.

Venetoclax Clinical Exposure
As of 28 November 2016, on the basis of data available in the AbbVie and 
Genentech/Roche clinical databases, a total of 2573 subjects have been exposed to at least 1 dose of venetoclax in the oncology development programs.  Of these 2573, 1429 subjects had CLL/small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL), 637 subjects had NHL, 180 subjects had MM, and 327 had AML.  An additional 114 subjects were healthy volunteers.  A total of 749 oncology subjects received the drug as monotherapy, and 1922 received the drug in combination with other therapies.
Doses administered in venetoclax clinical stud ies have ranged from 20 mg to 1200 mg.  
Multiple ongoing Phase 1/2 AbbVie and Phase 1/2/3 Genentech/Roche clinical studies are 
evaluating safety, tolerability, pharmac okinetics, and efficacy of venetoclax as 
monotherapy or in combination with ot her therapies (rituximab [R], obinutuzumab 
(GA101) [G], rituximab or obinutuzumab plus CHOP [cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone; R-CHOP or G- CHOP, respectively], BR, bendamustine plus 
obinutuzumab [BG], bortezomib plus dexamethasone, azacitidine or decitabine, and cytarabine) in subjects with hematologic malignancies.  Data are available from DDI studies of venetoclax interaction with ketoc onazole, with rifampin, and with warfarin.  
Additionally, two Phase 3 studies are ongoing:  one study in relapsed/refractory (R/R) CLL exploring the combination of venetoclax and rituximab against BR and one Phase 3 study in first-line CLL exploring the combination of venetoclax and obinutuzumab against obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil.
Based on nonclinical and clinical data available with venetoclax administration, important 
identified risks are tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) and neutropenia, particularly in the CLL indication.  Infection is a potential risk.  Other adverse events commonly observed with venetoclax include nausea, diarrhea, and other hematological effects (including, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia).  Decreased spermatogenesis has been observed in

nonclinical studies with dogs and could present a risk to male infert ility.  In additi on, as 
venetoclax is being evaluated in subjects with relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease who had 
previously been treated with various cytotoxic agents, second primary malignancies are closely monitored.
Five dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of tumo r lysis syndrome (TLS) and 2 DLTs of 
fatalities in the s etting of TLS were reported in the venetoclax clinical program for 
subjects with CLL/SLL (Study M12-175 and Study M13-365).  The 5 DLTs of TLS 
occurred in Study M12-175 at either the starting dose of 100 or 200 mg venetoclax (3 subjects in Cohort 1) or the lower initia l dose of 50 mg venetoclax implemented to 
minimize the risk of TLS (1 subject each in Cohorts 2 and 4).  The sixth DLT of TLS occurred at the maximum designated cohort dose administered in the study (Cohort 8, 1200 mg), and the subject experienced sudden death.  In Study M13-365, there was a single DLT of death due to grade 5 hyperk alemia in a setting of TLS at the 50 mg initial 
dose.  (Additionally, single non-DLT adverse events of TLS were reported in a subject with MCL in Study M12-175 and a subject with CLL in Study M13-365).  Events of laboratory TLS were also observed in 2 subjects during dosing in Study GP28331 at the step-up dose of 50 mg venetoclax.  Additional DLTs included 2 cases of febrile neutropenia and 1 case of neutropenia in subjects with CLL and NHL, and 1 case each of histiocytosis hematophagic and thrombocytopen ia in subjects with NHL (both considered 
related to rituximab r ather than venetoclax).
Updated safety and efficacy data are described in detail in the Investigator Brochure.

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by a progressive accumulation of monoclonal, small, mature-appearing CD5
+B cells in 
peripheral blood, bone marrow, and secondary lymp hoid organs.  It is the most common 
form of leukemia in adults in the Western World, accounting for approximately 30% of all leukemias.
11  Chronic lymphocytic le ukemia primarily affects elderly individuals; 
however, approximately one third of patients are less than 60 years of age at diagnosis.12  
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
31
It is currently estimated that annually approximately 15,000 people will be diagnosed with 
CLL in the United States, and that almost 4,500 individuals will die of the disease.13  In 
Europe, CLL accounts for approximately 30% of all leukemias in adults with a reported age-standardized incidence rate of 3.79 per 100,000 individuals (for CLL/SLL) in the years 2000 – 2002.
11,14  The approximate 5-year survival rate for patients with CLL is 
73%.15  CLL presents with a variable clinical course.  Approximately one-third of patients 
have indolent disease with prolonged median survival that does not require treatment and die of causes unrelated to disease.  Another third have an initial indolent phase that is 
followed by rapid progression of the disease requiri ng therapy.  The remaining third have 
aggressive disease and require treatment at the time of diagnosis. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients will often have compromised bone marrow reserve due to their underlying disease.  The principal complication of CLL is immunodeficiency related to myelosuppression and as a result, infection is the major cause of death in patients with CLL.
16
Standard chemotherapeutic options for CLL cause significant immune suppression and myelosuppression, are not well-tolerated by the elderly population and have not 
consistently offered survival advantage.  Treatment decisions for patients with CLL are made on the basis of considerations such as age, clinical stage, expected survival, and anticipated toxicities.  With the notable exception of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, CLL is currently an incurable disease, despite good initial responses to chemo immunotherapy.  Nonetheless, globally access to allogeneic stem cell transplant and/or clinical trials is limited, and treatment options for relapsed disease tend to have increased toxicity and reduced antitumor activity.
17p Deletion in Relapsed or Refractory CLL
17p deletion is a chromosomal aberration of prognostic relevance in CLL and accounts for 
up to 30% of all relapsed/refractory subjects with  CLL due to clonal cell evolution or the 
selection pressure of chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy.17-20
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
32
At the time study was initiated, there were no treatments approved specifically to meet the 
need of the 17p deletion population and the median OS in relapsed CLL patients with 17p deletion is less than 24 months.  Active treatments for the broader CLL population, such as fludarabine based regimens and alkylators, have been associated with poor response in the 17p patient population.
17  In a recent study conducted in subjects with relapsed CLL 
treated with FCR, PFS and OS were 5 months and 10.5 months, respectively, in subjects with 17p deletion, compared to 20.9 months a nd 46.5 months in subjects who did not have 
chromosome 17 abnormalities.
21  Overall response rates were also significantly lower in 
the patients with 17p deletion, with 35% of  subjects achieving partial remission, no CR 
and 5% nodular PR (nPR), compared to 74% response rate, with 30% CR and 14% nPR in the CLL subjects without 17p deletion ( Table 1 ).

# The marketing authorization for Alemtuzumab has been withdrawn at the request of the marketing-authorization

In the CLL population harboring 17p deletion, immunochemotherapy based regimens 
such as BR provide short durations of response with the median PFS of approximately 6.8 months and ORR of 7% ( Table 1 ).
25  Although novel therapies, such as alemtuzumab 
based regimens and ofatumumab, show an improvement in ORR, the duration of response is still poor and the median PFS is approximately 6 months (Table 1 ).
22-24  Also 
alemtuzumab has limited use due to its toxicity profile.24  Due to the limited effectiveness 
of available therapies, treatment guidelines recommend enrollment in clinical trials and in eligible patients who achieve a response allogeneic transplant, as preferred treatment 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
33
options for patients with 17p deletion.26,27  Nonetheless, globally the access to allogeneic 
transplant and/or clinical trials is limited, and physicians often continue to use 
immunochemotherapy.
17p Deletion in Previously Untreated CLL
Deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p deletion) are found in 3% to 10% of 
CLL cases at diagnosis.28
Untreated CLL patients who harbor the 17p deletion have generally a short first remission if they respond to standard treatment.  17p deletion is prognostic marker for nonresponse to conventional chemotherapy and there is no standard treatment for patients with previously untreated CLL.
28
Thus, alternative therapeutic approaches, which act independently of the p53 signaling 
pathway are needed.
Study Rationale
CLL patients with the 17p deletion have a poor prognosis characterized by suboptimal 
responses to first-line and subsequent therapies.  There are currently no treatments approved and labeled specifically to meet the need of the 17p deletion population.  Because treatment with the conventional therapy is poor, the treatment guidelines
26,27
recommend that CLL patients with 17p deletion (as well as TP53 mutations) should be treated within new clinical trials from the start.  Those who achieve a response to init ial 
therapy should be considered for an allogen eic transplant.  For patients not eligible for an 
allogeneic transplant or clinical trial, until very recently suggested regimens included alemtuzumab, high-dose methylprednisolone (HDMP) or ofatumumab.  None of these regimens have been shown to be superior to  any other therapy in relapsed 17p deletion 
patients and median PFS with treatment wi th these agents was less than 7 months.

Venetoclax Mechanism of Action Compared with Other Therapeutic Agents
Many chemotherapeutics used in treating CLL, including fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, 
and bendamustine, act by inducing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage and triggering apoptosis.  The p53 tumor suppressor is essential for relaying the DNA damage signal to the apoptotic machinery via upregulation of BH3-only proteins like Noxa and Puma.
29,30  
When p53 is functionally inactivated, either  through mutation or deletion, these signals 
are not effectively relayed and the e fficacy of these agents is blunted.23,31  However, 
because venetoclax bypasses these signaling even ts and inhibits Bcl-2 directly, it is 
expected to be equally effective in p53 wildtype and 17p del tumors.
Preliminary Clinical Data
Early results from the ongoing venetoclax first-in-human Study M12-175 (as of 
03 February 2014) have demonstrated activity in  21 evaluable relapsed/refractory CLL 
subjects with 17p deletion who were treated with venetoclax.  Fifteen (15) of the 21 subjects have > 50% reduction in absolute lymphocyte count and/or 50% reduction in lymph node measurements by CT scan, results consistent with at least a partial remission (71% ORR).  Three subjects meet criteria for CR/CRi (complete remission with incomplete bone marrow recovery).  These encouraging preliminary data indicate that venetoclax may be beneficial in this unique patient population.
3.1 Differences Statement
This is the first Phase 2 study for venetoclax monotherapy.  Safety data and preliminary 
efficacy responses in the 17p deletion CLL population from Phase 1 support moving into Phase 2.
3.2 Benefits and Risks
The preliminary data of venetoclax monotherap y in subjects with CLL show a favorable 
benefit.  The risk profile of the drug supports the continuous dosing of venetoclax in this 
indication.  Dose titration and a prophylactic regimen of hydration and uric acid reducers, along with laboratory monitoring, provide ad equate protection from the potential risk of 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)

35
serious adverse events of TLS.  In addition, safety will be reviewed on an ongoing basis 
by the Sponsor to evaluate accumulated safety data to assess any trends that would require 
modifications to the trial.
The encouraging preliminary data from the ongoing venetoclax first-in-human 
Study M12-175 indicate that venetoclax may be beneficial in subjects with relapsed CLL harboring 17p deletion.
Additionally, for previously untreated subjects with CLL harboring 17p deletion, 
venetoclax could provide an alternative treatment with the absence or reduction of the toxicities commonly associated with to  the standard aggressive chemotherapy.
4.0 Study Objectives
Main Cohort
The primary objective of this cohort is to evaluate the efficacy of venetoclax monotherapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) harboring the 17p deletion.  Efficacy will be measured by overall response rate (ORR).
The secondary objectives are to evaluate the complete remission rate (CR rate), partial 
remission rate (PR rate), duration of overall response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), event-free survival,  time to progression (TTP), time to first response, time to 50% reduction in ALC, overall survival (OS) and percent of subjects who move on to stem cell transplant.  The safety and tolerability of venetoclax in subjects with relapsed or 
refractory CLL harboring 17p deletion will also be evaluated.
Safety Expansion Cohort
The primary objective of the safety expansio n cohort is to evaluate the safety of 
venetoclax in approximately 50 subjects with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated 
CLL harboring 17p deletion treated per the updated TLS prophylaxis and management measures.
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
36
The secondary objectives are to evaluate ORR, CR rate, PR rate, duration of overall 
response, progression-free survival, ev ent-free survival, time to progression, time to 
first response, time to 50% reduction in ALC, overall survival, and percent of subjects who move on to stem cell transplant.
Exploratory objectives will be evaluated in both cohorts.  Time to next anti-CLL 
treatment (TTNT) and minimal residual disease (MRD), assessed in the peripheral blood and/or bone marrow (BM), will be measured.  Pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenetics and biomarkers will also be evaluated as exploratory objectives.  Health Economic and Patient-Reported Outcome Measures will include the MDASI (measure of subject reported symptoms), the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ CLL16 (a measure of health r elated quality of life sp ecific to CLL) and the EQ-5D-5L (measure of general 
health status) and EQ-5D-VAS.
5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is an open-label, single arm, multicenter , global study to determine the efficacy of 
venetoclax monotherapy in subjects with r elapsed/refractory or previously untreated 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia harboring 17p deletion sponsored by AbbVie in collaboration with Genentech/Roche.  Previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia harboring 17p deletion patients will not be enrolled in Germany.
This study is designed to enroll in the main cohort approximately 100 subjects with 
relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia harboring 17p deletion, as confirmed by the central laboratory, and in the safety expansion cohort approximately 50 subjects with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia harboring 17p deletion as confirmed by local or central la boratory, to meet scientific and regulatory 
objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations.  Therefore, if the target number of subjects has been enrolled, there is a possibility that additional subjects in screening will not be enrolled.
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
37
Subjects in this study will be enrolled at approximately 60 research sites.
After approximately 20 subjects have completed at least 12 weeks of study treatment in 
the main cohort, a safety analysis will be conducted by an Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (IDMC).  In the safety expansion cohort, interim analysis results will be reviewed by the IDMC after approximately 20 subjects have completed approximately 2 – 3 weeks of the lead-in period.
Main Cohort Dosing Schedule
NOTE:  Enrollment in the main cohort is complete, and all subjects have completed the 
lead-in period under Protocol Amendment 1.
Venetoclax will be administered orally once daily (QD), continuously.  Each dose of 
venetoclax should be taken with approximately 240 mL of water within 30 minutes after the completion of breakfast or the subject's first meal of the day.  To mitigate the risk for TLS, a lead-in period (up to 5 weeks) will be employed to evaluate a step wise dose escalation.  All subjects will be admitted to the hospital and begin the lead-in period with an initial test dose of 20 mg venetoclax on Week 1 Day 1.  If no significant findings occur within 24 hours, then a test dose of 50 mg will be administered on Week 1 Day 2 followed by 50 mg venetoclax QD for 5 days (Week 1 Day 3 – Day 7).  If significant findings occur within 24 hours of the initial test dose of 20 mg venetoclax on Week 1 Day 1, the 20 mg dose will be maintained for 1 week prior to dose escalation to 50 mg on Week 2 Day 1 – 7.
After a week at 50 mg, the following dose escalation will proceed with weekly dose 
escalations → 100 mg →200 mg → 400 mg (or additional lead-in steps to designated 
400 mg dose), as tolerated.
A lower starting dose and/or modification to the lead-in regimen may be implemented for 
individual subject(s) at particularly high risk for TLS ( Figure 1 ).

Lead-in Period
Every subject will receive a test dose of 20 mg on Week 1, Day 1 of the lead-in period.
1. If one or more electrolyte changes (from the predose value) meeting Cairo-Bishop 
criteria occurs within 24 hours of the 20 mg dose and is confirmed on the next 
laboratory test (1 – 2 hours later), no additional venetoclax doses will be 
administered until resolution .  (For Cairo Bishop criteria, see Appendix F , 
Cairo-Bishop and Howard Definitions of Tumor Lysis Syndrome.  See Appendix D , 
Recommendations for Initial Management of Electrolyte Abnormalities and Prevention of Tumor Lysis Syndrome [TLS], for procedures to follow.)  Upon laboratory abnormalities resolution, the subject will remain on the 20 mg dose through Week 1 (e.g., Week 1 Day 2 – Week 1 Day 7).
and/or
2. For subjects with a predose lymphocyte count ≥ 5000/mm
3, if a decrease (from the 
predose value) in lymphocyte count ≥ 30% occurs within 24 hours of the 20 mg 
dose on Day 1, the subject will remain on the 20 mg dose through Week 1 (e.g., Week 1 Day 2 – Week 1 Day 7).

Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
39
For subjects who meet the electrolyte and/or lymphocyte changes described in 1 and/or 2 
above, escalation to 50 mg will occur on Week 2 Day 1 of the lead-in period.  Subjects who had drug interruptions may escalate to 50 mg after they have been on a 20 mg dose for approximately a week (e.g., 5, 6 days).
If none of the electrolyte and/or lymphocyte changes described in 1 and/or 2 above occur 
within 24 hours from venetoclax 20 mg dose administration, the subject, while hospitalized, will dose escalate to 50 mg on Week 1 Day 2.  After the first dose of 50 mg, if no laboratory abnormalities occur, the subject will remain on the 50 mg dose through Week 1 (e.g., Week 1 Day 2 – Week 1 Day 7).  If abnormalities are observed, no additional venetoclax doses will be administered until resolution.
After the subject has received the 50 mg dose for approximately a week (6 – 7 days), the 
following dose escalation will proceed with weekly dose escalations 
→100 mg →200 mg 
→400 mg (or additional lead-in steps to designated 400 mg dose), as tolerated.
For all dose escalations, laboratory values for subject management must be reviewed inreal time by the investigator and prior to the subject's next dose to ensure appropriate subject management.  Based upon the laboratory values, the subject may continue dosing, may need to hold dose until resolution, may require hospitalization for further monitoring or may need additional post-dose laboratory checks.  (See Appendix D , Recommendations 
for Initial Management of Electrolyte Abnormalities and Prevention of Tumor Lysis Syndrome [TLS], for procedures to follow.)
Refer to Section 6.1.8.1 , Prophylaxis and Management of Tumor Lysis Syndrome, for 
additional details on TLS prophylaxis.
Safety Expansion Cohort Dosing Schedule
To mitigate the risk for TLS, a lead-in period of 5 weeks will be employed with a 
step wise dose escalation ( Figure 2 ).  For tumor lysis syndrome prophylaxis, all subjects 
will be classified into 3 risk categories based on the risk for developing TLS prior to 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)

venetoclax administration (Section 6.1.8.1 , Prophylaxis and Management of Tumor Lysis 
Syndrome).
Subjects in the low risk category and medium risk category with CrCl ≥ 80 mL/min 
and low tumor burden will begin the lead-in period in the outpatient setting with an 
initial dose of 20 mg venetoclax on Week 1 Day 1.  
●If no significant findings suggestive of clinical or laboratory TLS occur within 
24 hours, the same dose will be continued through Week 1 Day 7 in the 
outpatient setting.  Subjects  with no laboratory  abnorm alities s uggestive of 
TLS will escalate to a dose of 50 mg venetoclax on Week 2 Day 1 in the 
outpatient setting.
●If there is indication of laboratory or clinical TLS, the study drug dose will be held until resolution of all findings.  TLS management will be implemented as 
appropriate.
Medium risk subjects with CrCl < 80 mL/min and/or higher tumor burden (i.e., ALC 
> 100 × 10
9/L or multiple bulky nodes) may be admitted to the hospital, at the 
investigator's discretion, to begin the lead-in period with an initial dose of 20 mg 
venetoclax on Week 1 Day 1.  
●If no significant findings suggestive of clinical or laboratory TLS occur within 
24 hours, the same dose will be continued through Week 1 Day 7 in the 
outpatient setting.  Subjects  with no laboratory  abnorm alities s uggestive of 
TLS will escalate to a dose of 50 mg venetoclax on Week 2 Day 1 in the 
outpatient setting.  However, subjects may st ill be hospi talized prior to the 
first dose escalation at 50 mg if they continue to have CrCl < 80 mL/min 
and/or higher tumor burden (i.e., ALC > 100 × 109/L or multiple bulky nodes), 
at the investigator's discretion.
●If there is indication of laboratory or clinical TLS, the study drug dose will be held until resolution of all findings.  TLS management will be implemented as appropriate.

All high risk subjects will be admitted to the hospital and begin the lead-in period with 
an initial dose of 20 mg venetoclax on Week 1 Day 1. 
●If no significant findings suggestive of clinical or laboratory TLS occur within 
24 hours, the same dose will be continued through Week 1 Day 7 in the 
outpatient setting.  Subjects will be hospitalized prior to the first dose escalation to 50 mg beginning on Week 2 Day 1.  Each subject's risk status 
may be reassessed prior to subsequent dose escalations per the guidelines in 
Section 6.1.8.1 , Prophylaxis and Management of Tumor Lysis Syndrome.
●If no significant findings occur within 24 hours of dose escalation, the study drug will be continued at the same dose from Days 2 through 7 in the outpatient setting.
●If there is indication of laboratory or clinical TLS, the study drug dose w ill be 
held until resolution of all findings.  TLS management will be implemented as appropriate.
A lower starting dose and/or modification to the lead-in regimen may be implemented for 
individual subject(s) at particularly high risk for TLS.  For these individual cases, a discussion should occur between the investigator and the AbbVie medical monitor.
If a high risk subject has clinical signs of progression during the first week of 20 mg 
dosing, correspondence between the investigator and the AbbVie med ical monitor must 
occur.

Lead-in Period
Every subject will receive a dose of 20 mg on Week 1, Day 1 of the lead-in period.  If one 
or more electrolyte changes (from the 0 hour m easurement prior to dosing) suggestive of 
TLS occur within 24 hours of the 20 mg dose, no additional venetoclax doses will be 
administered until resolution.  If aggressive  correction of electrolytes abnormalities is 
performed, the subsequent dose of venetoclax can only be given when electrolytes have been stable without any more treatment for at least 24 hours.  See Appendix D , 
Recommendations for Initial Management of Elect rolyte Abnormalities a nd Prevention of 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS), for addition al laboratory assessments and management 
guidelines.  Upon resolution of laboratory abnormalities, the subject will continue on the 20 mg dose through Week 1 (e.g., Week 1 Day 2 – Week 1 Day 7).
Subjects who had drug interruptions may escalate to 50 mg after they have been on a 
20 mg dose for at least one week (7 days).
After a week at 50 mg, weekly dose escalations will be implemented as follows:  
100 mg→200 mg →400 mg (or additional lead-in steps to designated 400 mg dose) as 
tolerated.
For all dose escalations, laboratory values for subject management must be reviewed in 
real time by the investigator, and prior to the subject's next dose, to ensure appropriate 
subject management.  Based upon the laboratory values, the subject may continue dosing, may need to hold dose until resolution, may require hospitalization for further monitoring or may need additional post- dose laboratory checks.  See Appendix D , Recommendations 
for Initial Management of Electrolyte Abnormali ties and Prevention of Tumor Lysis 
Syndrome (TLS) for additional laboratory assessments and management guidelines.

Main and Safety Expansion Cohorts
Dose Interruptions and Dose Reductions
If a subject has a venetoclax dose interruption or reduction, venetoclax may be 
reintroduced or escalated per correspondence between the Investigator and the AbbVie medical monitor.
Post-Treatment Follow-Up Visit(s)
For subjects who discontinue venetoclax (e.g., due to toxicity or stem cell/bone marrow 
transplant), post-treatment follow-up visits will be performed every 3 months until discontinuation from the study.  Post-Tr eatment follow-up visits are not required for 
subjects who have discontinued due to dis ease progression or a subject's refusal of the 
Post-Treatment visits.  This will be for a period of up to 5 years after the last subject has enrolled on the study.
Note:   Effective with protocol Amendment 6, subjects  being followed in Post-Treatment as 
of 12 May 2017 will switch to being assessed per the Survival Assessments below.  No 
new subjects will enter the Post-Treatment period.
Survival Assessment(s)
Survival information (i.e., the date and cause of death, post treatment cancer therapies, 
etc.) will be collected via telephone calls and/or clinical visits at 3 month (± 7 days) intervals after the last study visit for a period of 5 years after the last subject has enrolled on the study for subjects who have not withdrawn consent.
Richter's Transformation and Second Primary Malignancies Assessment
Richter's transformation and second primary malignancies information (i.e., confirmation 
if the subject developed Richter's transformation and/or second primary malignancies and post treatment cancer therapies, etc.) will be collected via clinic visits or telephone calls at 3 month intervals after the last study visit for a period of up to 5 years after the last subject 
has been enrolled, for those subjects who have not withdrawn consent.

Option to Continue Venetoclax Treatment
Subjects may continue receiving study drug for up to 2 years following the date of the last 
subject enrolled provided they continue to tolerate the drug, have no evidence of disease progression, and do not meet any of the criteria for subject discontinuation.  Please see Section 5.4.1 for additional information.
Survival – Extended Access
For subjects who continue to derive benefit from venetoclax treatment 2 years following 
the date of the last subject enrolled, AbbVie will provide venetoclax for monotherapy use until the subject develops disease progression or until 5 years following the date of last 
subject enrolled (12 May 2020).  In countries where venetoclax is commercially available, subjects have the option to discontinue receiving venetoclax via the study and switch to commercial supply at any time but may be contacted every 12 weeks (± 7 days) to collect the Survival information noted above, provided they have not withdrawn consent. 
For subjects continuing into the Survival Extended Access portion of the trial, venetoclax 
will be dispensed at the Final Visit, and Survival visits will begin 12 weeks (± 7 days) following the 30-day Safety Follow-Up Visit.  Survival visits will include collection of Survival information, AEs/SAEs and concomitant medication information, study drug administration, collection and dispensing of subject diaries, and MRD PCR sample collection for eligible subjects.  All other procedures for disease assessments will be performed as standard of care.

Table 4. Study Activities (Continued)
d. Subjects must have 17p deletion as assessed by local or central laboratory to be considered for enrollment.  A result obtained prior to study Screening may be used for 
eligibility.  A confirmatory sample will be sent to central laboratory at Screening.  Refer to Section 5.3.1.5 , Collection and Handling of Biomarker Variables, for more details.
e. A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening.  A symptom directed physical examination will be performed on Day 1 of Weeks 2 – 4 and the 30-day 
Safety Visit.  All other physical examinations will be targeted.  If during physical examination, signs or symptoms suggestive of Richter's Syndrome are observed, further 
assessments (e.g., lymph node biopsy, PET scan) should be considered to exclude or confirm the transformation.  Refer to Sectio n 5.3.1.1 Physical Examination, for more 
details.
f. For females of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test must be obtained and processed locally at the Week 1 Day 1, if it has been > 7 days since obtaining the serum 
pregnancy results at Screening.
g. Cholesterol and triglycerides are only required at Screening and Final Visit.
h. There is no 72 hour window for these samples.  Refer to Section 6.1.8.1 , Prophylaxis and Management of Tumor Lysis Syndrome and Appendix D – Recommendations for 
Initial Management of Electrolyte Abnormalities and Prevention of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS).
i. Assessment of ejection fraction will be made at screening at the discretion of the investigator.  Subsequent evaluation of Le ft Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) will be 
made as clinically indicated for subjects who develop signs of cardiac compromise.
j. If a subject exhibits clinical signs of possible disease progression (i.e., increased or de novo enlargement of liver, spleen or lymph nodes on physical examination without an 
increase in lymphocytes meeting PD criteria), a CT scan and/or bone marrow biopsy must be performed within 2 weeks to confirm or  rule out PD as described in 
Section 5.3.3.2 .
k. Imaging assessments are required for all subjects at Week 36 Day 1.  Assessment to be performed on Week 36 Day 1 only (not every 12 weeks).  The Week 36 scan may be 
performed within 4 weeks before or after the 36 week scheduled visit provided that it has been at least 8 weeks since the subje ct's last scan.
l. After a response is determined by clinical criteria, a CT scan will be performed no earlier than 8 weeks for confirmation of r esponse.  For determination of CR/CRi, both the 
CT scan and bone marrow are required to be negative.  It is recommended that the CT scan is performed first, and if it does conf irm a CR/CRi, then a BM biopsy should be 
obtained as soon as possible.  
m. Post-treatment CT or MRI scans to be done only if collected by the site as part of standard of care. 
n. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy will be performed and assessed locally at Screening (within 35 days prior to the first dose of study drug).  Bone marrow and aspirate for 
biomarker sample collection should be split from this sample.  Refer to Table 6 .
o. For subjects who meet all criteria for CR/CRi with the exception of a node(s) that is enlarged around 1.5 – 2 cm may also have  a bone marrow performed.  If bone marrow 
was not performed at the time of the confirmatory CT, then it should be performed after the Week 36 Day 1 CT scan.

Table 4. Study Activities (Continued)
p. At baseline, all measurable disease must be documented at screening by laboratory testing, physical examination and CT scans (or MRI if CT is medically contraindicated), 
and bone marrow examinations.
q. Specimens (bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood) for MRD analysis should be collected at the same time as the bone marro w aspirate and biopsy performed for tumor 
assessments to confirm the CR/CRi.  If MRD negativity is achieved in the bone marrow no further MRD analyses are required.  Otherwise, MRD should be assessed at 
12-week intervals thereafter (in peripheral blood) until MRD negativity is achieved.  Once MRD negativity is achieved and confi rmed in peripheral blood (e.g., two MRD 
negative consecutive peripheral blood samples), a bone marrow aspirate specimen will again be collected for analysis of MRD lev els to confirm the peripheral blood 
negativity.  Subjects who meet all criteria for CR/CRi with the exception of a node(s) that is enlarged around 1.5 – 2 cm may al so have a bone marrow performed and MRD 
assessment.  If a bone marrow and MRD assessment was not performed at the time of the confirmatory CT scan, then they should be  performed after the Week 36 Day 1 CT 
scan.  If MRD negativity is achieved in the bone marrow no further MRD analyses are required.  Otherwise, MRD should be assesse d at 12-week intervals thereafter (in 
peripheral blood) until MRD negativity is achieved.  Once MRD negativity is achieved and confirmed in peripheral blood (e.g., t wo MRD negative consecutive peripheral 
blood samples), a bone marrow aspirate specimen will again be collected for analysis of MRD levels to confirm the peripheral bl ood negativity.
r. The Health Economic and Patient Reported Outcomes questionnaires should be administered and completed prior to any other stud y procedures being performed at these 
visits.  Refer to Section 5.3.8 , Health Economic and Patient-Reported Outcome Measures, for further information.
s. For subjects in the United States only:  Subjects in the safety expansion cohort will be asked to complete a survey assessing the information they were provided for the Patient 
Information Card and the Tumor Lysis Syndrome Patient Information Brochure at Week 2 Day 1 or the next scheduled visit.  For su bjects participating in the main cohort, the 
survey will be given to the subject at the next scheduled study visit upon signing the Protocol Amendment 2 Informed Consent.  This survey is optional.
t. For subjects continuing into the Survival Extended Access portion of the trial, Survival vists will include collection of Sur vival information, AEs/SAEs and concomitant 
medication information, study drug administration, collection and dispensing of subject diaries, and MRD PCR sample collection for eligible subjects.  All other procedures 
for disease assessments will be perfomed as standard of care.

On Week 1 Day 1, any changes observed from the Screening assessments (prior to
dosing) will be recorded in the subject's medical history.  
Adverse Event and Concomitant Medication Assessment
Medication (prescription or over-the-counter, including vitamins and herbal supplements) 
will be recorded beginning with the Screening Visit through the end of the study.
At each visit, including the Final Visit and the 30-day Safety Follow-Up Visit, the 
subject's medical history will be reviewed and any changes from baseline will be recorded on the adverse event eCRF.
Physical Examination
A complete physical examination performed should include the evaluation of head, 
eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT); cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, 
respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological systems.
Changes from baseline abnormalit ies should be r ecorded at each subsequent physical 
examination.  New or worsened abnormalities should be recorded as AEs if appropriate.Physical examinations should also include the evaluation of the presence and degree of 
enlarged lymph nodes in two dimension (cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, inguinal and femoral nodes), hepatomegaly, and splenom egaly.  These should be noted on all 
examinations irrespective of being present or absent.  Refer to Section 5.3.3.1 for 
additional information pertaining to methods of measurement.
If during physical examination, signs or sympto ms suggestive of Richter's Syndrome are 
observed, further assessments (i.e., nodes, biopsy, PET scan) should be considered to 
exclude or confirm the transformation.
At Screening, the subject should have a complete physical examination.

It is recommended, where possible, that a subject's performance status will be assessed by 
the same person throughout the study.
Grade Description
0 Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without 
restriction.
1 Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to 
carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light housework, 
office work.
2 Ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any 
work activities.  Up and about more than 50% of waking hours.
3 Capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair more than 
50% of waking hours.
4 Completely disabled.  Cannot carry on any self-care.  Totally confined 
to bed or chair.
Clinical Laboratory Tests
A central laboratory will be utilized to process and provide results for the clinical 
laboratory tests.  The principal investigator or subinvestigator should review, initial, and date the Screening laboratory results after receipt from the central laboratory.  For 
subsequent laboratory tests, the principal investigator or subinvestigator will review, 
initial, and date laboratory results used for subject management after receipt from the laboratory (i.e., local and/or central).  The centr al laboratory values will be directly loaded 
to the clinical database from the central laboratory provider.  Laboratory normal ranges will be provided to the AbbVie Clinical Team, as requested.  
A laboratory test value that requires a subject to be discontinued from the study, requires a 
subject to receive treatment, meets protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.7 regarding toxicity management), and/or the Investigator considers clinically significant will be recorded as an adverse event.
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20

Local Laboratory Tests
Sites must utilize local laboratories to provide results for immediate subject management.  
Duplicate samples should also be sent to the central laboratory for processing for all protocol required laboratory samples, with the exception of serial laboratory samples 
collected on the same day (i.e., 4, 8 and 12 hour post dose laboratory collections).  Local laboratory results from samples that are als o processed by the central laboratory should 
not be input into the eCRF with the exception of calcium, inorganic phosphorus, 
potassium, uric acid, creatinine and LDH , which should be entered through the lead-in 
period, and ALC (or % lymphocytes if ALC is not tested), ANC (or % neutrophils if 
ANC is not tested), WBC, platelets and hemoglobin which should be entered throughout 
the duration of the study.
If a duplicate sample is not able to be provided (e.g., subject in hospital), local laboratory 
values, as requested by AbbVie, will be entered by the site directly onto the appropriate eCRF and laboratory normal ranges for the la boratory that is used will be provided to the 
AbbVie Clinical Team.
Pregnancy Test
For female subjects of childbearing potential, pregnancy testing must be performed as 
follows:
●Screening – Serum test

blood/plasma/serum samples potentially resulting in spuriously low plasma uric acid assay readings.  The 
following special sample handling procedure must be followed to avoid ex vivo uric acid degradation.  Uric acid must be analyzed in plasma.  Blood must be collected into pre-chilled tubes containing heparin anticoagulant.  Immediately immerse plasma samples for uric acid measurement in an ice water bath.   Plasma samples must 
be prepared by centrifugation in a pre-cooled centrifuge (4°C).  Finally, the plasma must be maintained in an ice 
water bath and analyzed for uric acid within four hours of collection.
c. Viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) samples are to be collected and sent to the central laboratory for archiving 
and will only be analyzed if needed due to manifestations of possible infections during the treatment period.

Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
76
●Final Visit
●As clinically indicated
The ECG results will be used by the investigator for subject safety assessments, including 
adverse event determination and management, dose escalation, and termination of subjects from the study.  ECG resu lts will be summarized as follows:
●normal ECG
●abnormal ECG – not clinically significant
●abnormal ECG – clinically significant
●unable to evaluate
Any reports that are abnormal and clinically significant will be faxed to the Oncology Safety Management Team via the contact information provided in Section 6.1.6 within 
5 business days of obtaining the results.  The QT interval measurement will be documented in the eCRF only if a "prol onged QT" is observed.  Correction by the 
Fridericia formula (QTcF) is preferred; how ever, correction by other methods may be 
acceptable based on correspondence with the A bbVie medical monitor.  The original ECG 
tracing will be retained in the subject's records at the study site.
Assessment of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) 
Assessment of ejection fraction will be made at screening by either echocardi ogram or a 
Multi Gated Acquisition Scan (MUGA) at the discretion of the investigator.  Subsequent 
evaluation of LVEF will be made as clinically indicated for subjects who develop signs of 
cardiac compromise.
Disease Assessments (2008 Modified IWCLL NCI-WG Guidelines)
Clinical response will be assessed by the investigator based on analysis of laboratory tests 
(hematology laboratory values) and comp lete physical examination.  In addition, based 
upon the clinical response (CR/CRi/PR), a CT scan of involved anatomic regions (or MRI if CT is medically contraindicated), and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy may be

performed.  Subjects will be evaluated against the 2008 Modified IWCLL NCI-WG 
Guidelines for Tumor Response34including CT imaging (or MRI).
Analysis of clinical laboratory values and physical examination will be performed at 
the following visits:
●Screening
●Week 5 Day 1
●Week 8 Day 1
●Week 12 Day 1
●Week 16 Day 1
●Week 20 Day 1
●Week 24 Day 1
●Week 28 Day 1
●Week 32 Day 1
●Week 36 Day 1 and Day 1 of every 12 weeks thereafter (e.g., Weeks 48, 60, 
72, etc.)
●No earlier than 8 weeks after the CR ,CRi or PR criteria is first met (if applicable)
●Final Visit
●Post Treatment Visits, if applicable
Note:  Disease Assessments may be performed within 72 hours prior to or after the 
scheduled visit starting with Week 8 Day 1.
Response criteria definitions are outlined in Section 5.3.3.1 .
Computed Tomography (CT) Scans (or Magnetic Resonance Imaging [MRI])
A CT scan with contrast must be performed within 35 days prior to study drug 
administration for all subjects.  CT scans (with contrast) should include neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvic sequences.  A contrast-enhanced MRI of the neck, chest, abdomen 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
78
and pelvis with a non-contrast CT scan of the chest may be used for subjects in whom a 
contrast CT is medically contraindicated (i.e., subjects with an allergy to CT contrast agents or subjects with impaired renal clearance).  Whichever method is used at Screening, it should be used consistently through the duration of the study.
When a response (PR or CR) is determined by clinical criteria (e.g., laboratory 
tests/physical exam) at any time during the study, a CT scan must be performed no earlier than 8 weeks later for confirmation per 2008 Modified IWCLL NCI-WG Guidelines for Tumor Response.  If the CT scan confirms a CR, then a BM biopsy should be performed as soon as possible to confirm the CR.  For determination of CR, both the CT scan andbone marrow are required to be negative.
A CT scan should also be performed at 36 weeks for all subjects.  This scan may be 
performed within 4 weeks before or after the 36 week scheduled visit provided that it has been at least 8 weeks since the subject's last scan.  For subjects whose response meets criteria for a PR at the time of the Week 36 CT scan, an additional CT scan should be performed (no earlier than 8 weeks following the Week 36 scan) if a subsequent clinical disease assessment indicates that a CR or CRi has been achieved.
If a subject exhibits clinical signs of possible disease progression (i.e., increased or 
de novo enlargement of liver, spleen or lymph nodes on physical examination) without an increase in lymphocytes meeting PD criteria , a CT scan must be performed within 
2 weeks to confirm or rule out PD as described in Section 5.3.3.2 according to Modified 
IWCLL NCI-WG Criteria for Tumor Response.
In addition to being reviewed by the investigator and/or site staff, an independent review 
will be performed to assess tumor response and disease progression.  Clinical data and radiographic scans will be interpreted according to 2008 Modified IWCLL NCI-WGGuidelines for Tumor Response (refer to Table 8 ).  The independent review facility will 
provide instructions re garding the preparation and shipment of the data.  Interpretations 
from the independent review will not be sent to the site.  Subject treatment management will be based on review by the local investigator and/or site staff.
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
79
Note :  Computed Tomography (CT) Scans (or MRI) may be performed up to 7 days after 
the scheduled visit.
Bone Marrow Aspirate and Biopsy
A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy will be performed and assessed locally at Screening 
(within 35 days prior to the first dose of study drug).  Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy for biomarker sample collection should be split from this sample.  A portion of the baseline aspirate may be used to design primers for ASO-PCR based MRD assessment.  The bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should be performed after all other eligibility criteria have been met, unless otherwise obtained through standard of care.  Bone marrow aspirates and biopsies performed as standa rd of care throughout the st udy should also be 
captured on an eCRF.
Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy reports will  be faxed to the AbbVie primary contact 
listed in Section 6.2or designee.
If the subject achieves a CR/CRi by both clinical criteria and confirmatory CT scan, a 
bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should be performed as soon as possible to confirm the CR/CRi.
Subjects who meet all criteria for CR/CRi with the exception of a node(s) that are 
enlarged around 1.5 – 2 cm may also have a bone marrow performed.  If bone marrow was not performed at the time of the confirmatory CT, then it should be performed after the Week 36 Day 1 CT scan.  Bone marrow for biomarker sample collection can be split from this sample, from the bone marrow used for eligibility criteria, or from any bone marrow performed as standard of care throughout the study.
Quantitative Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Assessment
MRD35for enumeration of CLL cells using ERIC panel based flow cytometry will be 
assessed by regional laboratories from all available samples.  Additionally, MRD may be 
assessed using a PCR based technique from all available samples. MRD negativity may 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
80
be defined as the presence of less than one CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes (or below 104) 
in the peripheral blood and/or bone marrow.
Specimens (bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood) for MRD analysis should be 
collected at the same time as the bone marrow aspirate and biopsy performed for tumor assessments to confirm the CR/CRi.  If MRD negativity is achieved in the bone marrow no further MRD analyses are required.  Otherwise, MRD should be assessed at 12-week intervals thereafter (in peripheral blood) until MRD negativity is achieved.  Once MRD negativity is achieved and confirmed in peripheral blood (e.g., two MRD negative consecutive peripheral blood samples), a bone marrow aspirate specimen will again be collected for analysis of MRD levels to  confirm the peripheral blood negativity.
Subjects who meet all criteria for CR/CRi with the exception of a node(s) that is enlarged around 1.5 – 2 cm may also have a bone marrow performed and MRD assessment.  If a bone marrow and MRD assessment was not perform ed at the time of the confirmatory CT 
scan, then they s hould be performed after the Week 36 Day 1 CT scan.  If MRD 
negativity is achieved in the bone marrow no further MRD analyses are required.  Otherwise, MRD should be assessed at 12-week intervals thereafter (in the peripheral blood) un til MRD negativity is achieved.  Once MRD negativity is achieved and 
confirmed in peripheral blood (e.g., two MRD negative consecutive peripheral blood samples), a bone marrow aspirate specimen will again be collected for analysis of MRD levels to confirm the peripheral blood negativity.
Subjects continuing into the Survival Extended Access portion of the study, and who 
continue to be eligible for MRD testing, will have blood specimens collected for MRD PCR collected at 12-week (± 7 days) intervals.  If a subject undergoes a bone marrow biopsy as standard of care while on the survival extended access portion, a portion of the aspirate is reques ted to be collected for MRD-PCR.

Assignment of Subject Numbers
Subjects will be assigned unique consecutive subject numbers at Screening, as described 
in Section 5.5.3 .  The results of all screening evaluations must be within clinically 
acceptable limits, upon review by the investigator and AbbVie medical monitor, before a subject can be administered study drug.  Subjects will not be enrolled in the study if laboratory or other screening results are unacceptable.
5.3.1.2 Confinement
Subjects will not be confined during this st udy, but all subjects at high risk for TLS will 
be hospitalized for TLS prophylaxis and observation prior to their first dose of venetoclax 
at 20 mg and at 50 mg.  Additionally, subjects  who continue to meet the criteria for high 
risk of TLS, or medium risk subjects with low creatinine clearance and/or higher tumor burden (i.e., ALC > 100 × 10
9/L or multiple bulky nodes), may be hospitalized for 
prophylaxis and monitoring at each subsequent dose escalation, at the discretion of the investigator.
5.3.1.3 Meals and Dietary Requirements
Each dose of venetoclax will be taken with approximately 240 mL of water within 
30 minutes after the completion of breakfast or the subject's first meal of the day.  On days that pre-dose PK sampling is required, dosing will occur in the morning at the clinic to facilitate PK sampling.
Subjects may not consume:
●Grapefruit or grapefruit products, Seville oranges (including marmalade 
containing Seville oranges) or Star fruit within the 3-day period prior to the first study drug administration and until th e last day of treatment is completed 
due to possible CYP3A mediated metabolic interaction.

5.3.1.4 Blood Samples for Pharmacogenetic Analysis (Optional)
One 4 mL whole blood sample for DNA isolation will be collected at Screening or prior 
to first dose of study drug on Week 1 Day 1 from each subject who consents to provide samples for pharmacogenetic analysis.  If the sample is not collected at either of these visits, it may be collected at any visit duri ng the study.  The procedure for obtaining and 
documenting informed consent is discussed in Section 9.3.
Whole blood will be collected by standard phlebotomy techniques as described below:
●Collect approximately 4 mL of blood into an appropriately labeled EDTA 
tube.
●Immediately invert the collection tube 8 to 10 times to reduce the likelihood of clot formation.
●Within 30 minutes of blood collection, store samples at –20°C or colder until shipped to central laboratory on dry ice sufficient to last during transport.
Samples will be shipped frozen to central la boratory.  The central laboratory or AbbVie 
will maintain the samples for DNA extraction and long-term storage.  Samples should not 
be allowed to thaw prior to arrival at the central laboratory.
The sample collection tubes will minimally be  labeled with "PG-DNA blood," the drug 
number, protocol number, subject number and the study day.  AbbVie or designee will 
store the DNA samples in a secure space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  The samples will be retained while research on venetoclax (or drugs of this class) continues but no longer than 20 years or per country requirement.

●Screening
Central Laboratory 17p Deletion Testing Information
17p deletion status is defined using FISH cytogenetic testing, as recommended in ESMO guidelines.
26  The detection of 17p del, identified by loss of TP53 locus, will be 
determined by FISH study using the Vysis CLL probe kit,36which is an IUO/PEO labeled 
test assessed by a central laboratory.
The kit uses FISH DNA probe technology to determine deletion status of probe targets for 
locus-specific identifier (LSI) including LSI- TP53 (containing tumor protein p53gene, located on the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p).  LSI TP3 probe, approximately 172 Kilobases in length, is located at 17p13.1 and contains the complete TP53 gene.  A normal/abnormal determination for LSI TP53 probe  is made by comparing the number of 
nuclei observed (per 200 scoreable nuclei) with the abnormal signal pattern to the normal cut-off value, which is > 7% (defined as 14 nuclei observed per 200 nuclei scoreable).

5.3.2.2 Handling/Processing of Samples
Blood and plasma samples must be protected  from direct sunlight during collection, 
processing and storage.  Immediately after collection, the blood samples for venetoclax 
will be inverted 8 to 10 times to ensure good mixing of the blood and anticoagulant, and will be placed in an ice bath.  The blood samples will be centrifuged using a refrigerated centrifuge (2° to 8°C) to separate the plasma at 1100 to 1600 × g for approximately 10 to 15 minutes.  The plasma samples will be transferred using plastic pipettes into screw-capped polypropylene tubes (cryovials) labeled with the drug number name, assay type, type of sample (plasma), the protocol number, the subject number, the study week and day, and the planned time of sampling relative to dosing and then frozen at –20°C or colder.  The entire process should be completed within one hour of draw.  Samples should be maintained at –20°C or colder until shipped to the central laboratory.
5.3.2.3 Disposition of Samples
The frozen plasma samples for venetoclax (and possible metabolite[s]) assay will be 
packed in dry ice sufficient to last during tran sport and shipped from the study site to the 
central laboratory according to instructions included in the Laboratory Manual for this study.  An inventory of the samples incl uded will accompany the package.  The central 
laboratory will be responsible for shipping the plasma samples to AbbVie or designated laboratory for testing.
5.3.2.4 Measurement Methods
Plasma concentrations of venetoclax (and possible metabolite[s]) will be determined 
under the supervision of the Drug Analysis Department at AbbVie.
5.3.3 Efficacy Variables
The primary objective of the main cohort is to evaluate the efficacy of venetoclax 
monotherapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory ch ronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 
harboring the 17p deletion.  Efficacy will be  measured by overall response rate (ORR).  
The secondary objectives are to evaluate CR, PR, duration of overall response, determine 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
94
progression-free survival (PFS), event free survival, time to progression (TTP), time to 
first response, time to 50% reduction in ALC, overall survival (OS) and percent of subjects who move on to stem cell transplant.
For the safety expansion cohort in sub jects with relapsed/re fractory or previously 
untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) harboring the 17p deletion, efficacy will 
be considered a secondary endpoint.  The secondary objectives are to evaluate ORR, CR, PR, duration of overall response, determine progression-free survival (PFS), event free survival, time to progression (TTP), time to first response, time to 50% reduction in ALC, overall survival (OS), and percent of subjects who move on to stem cell transplant.
Analyses of these endpoints are described in Section 8.0.
5.3.3.1 2008 Modified IWCLL NCI-WG Guidelines for Tumor 
Response
For disease assessments, response will be assessed by the investigator based on analysis 
of clinical laboratory tests (hemato logy laboratory values), complete physical 
examination, contrast-enhanced CT scan of involved anatomic regions, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy.  If a contrast-enhanced  CT is medically contraindicated (e.g., subjects 
with an allergy to CT contrast agents or subjects with impaired renal clearance), a contrast-enhanced MRI of all involved anatomical regions plus a non-contrast CT of the chest should be done.  Subjects will be evaluated against the 2008 Modified IWCLL NCI-WG Guidelines for Tumor Response
34with the addition of CT imaging (or MRI).
At Screening, all measurable disease must be documented by laboratory testing (hematology laboratory values), physical examination, CT scan, and bone marrow.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment with the exception of the CT scan and bone marrow biopsy and aspirate which must be completed within 5 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  All other tumor assessments after baseline should be performed within 7 days after the scheduled visit.
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
95
Beginning at Week 5 Day 1, disease response will be assessed by the investigator based 
on the analysis of clinical laboratory tests and a complete physical examination.  When a response (PR or CR) is determined by clinical criteria (laboratory tests and physical exam) at any time during the study, a CT scan must be performed no earlier than 8 weeks later to confirm clinical response.  If the CT scan confirms a CR, then a BM biopsy is required as soon as possible for confirmation of CR.  For determination of CR, both the CT scan and bone marrow are required to be negative.
A CT scan should also be performed at 36 weeks for all subjects.  This scan may be 
performed within 4 weeks before or after the 36 week scheduled visit provided that it has been at least 8 weeks since the subject's last scan.  For subjects whose response meets criteria for a PR at the time of the Week 36 CT scan, an additional CT scan should be performed (no earlier than 8 weeks following the Week 36 scan) if a subsequent clinical disease assessment indicates that a CR or CRi has been achieved.
If a subject exhibits clinical signs of possible disease progression (i.e., increased or 
de novo enlargement of liver, spleen or lymph nodes on physical examination) without an increase in lymphocytes meeting PD criteria, then additional assessments including contrast-enhanced CT scan and/or bone marrow must be performed within 2 weeks to confirm or rule out PD.
Methods of Measurement
Disease response and progression will be assessed by analysis of peripheral blood, clinical 
examination, radiographic techniques and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy.
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.
Details on the analysis of peripheral blood required to assess response are provided in 
Section 5.3.1.1 , Study Procedures.
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
96
A physical examination should be performed to assess the extent of disease involvement.  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., palpable lymph nodes).  The diameter, in two planes, of the largest palpable nodes in each of the following sites should be measure d:  cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, 
inguinal, and femoral.  Evaluation for the presence of hepatomegaly and splenomegaly should be performed.
The 12 largest bi-dimensional lesions should be recorded in the eCRF.
●Target Lesions:  A maximum of 12 target lesions may be selected (up to 
6 nodal and 6 extranodal).  Target nodal lesions must be abnormal (> 1.5 cm in 
LDi at baseline), clearly measurable and suitable for consistent, reproducible measurement in at least two perpendicular dimensions.  Target extranodal 
lesions must be > 1 cm in tw o perpendicular diameters at baseline. 
●Non-Target Lesions:  A maximum of 10 non-target lesions can be selected.  Non-target nodal lesions must be abnormal (> 1.5 cm in LDi at baseline).  
Non-target extranodal lesions must be > 1 cm in two perpendicular diameters.  Nodal and extranodal lesions that were not selected as target lesions at baseline 
can be followed as non-target lesions.
Computed tomography (CT) is the preferre d method to measure lesions selected for 
response assessment.  Contrast-enhanced CT scans with anatomical coverage of the neck, 
chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be performed.  CT scans for response assessment may be limited to areas of prior involvement only, if required by local regu latory authorities.  
Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans with anatomical coverage of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis plus a non-contrast CT scan of the chest may be used if CT is medically contraindicated (e.g., severe contrast allergy).  Whichever scanning method was used at baseline must be used during follow-up.  Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with cuts of 5 mm or less  in slice thickness contiguously.  Spiral CT 
should be performed by use of 5 mm cont iguous reconstruction algorithm; this 
specification applies to the regions of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis.

For accurate overall response evaluation, ultrasound (US) or PET scans should not be 
used to measure tumor lesions.
Details on bone marrow biopsy and as pirate are provided in Section 5.3.1.1 , Study 
Procedures.In addition to being reviewed by the investigator and/or site staff, an independent review 
will be performed to assess tumor response and disease progression.  Clinical criteria and radiographic scans will be evaluated using the 2008 Modified IWCLL NCI-WG Guidelines for Tumor Response (refer to Table 8 ).  The independent review facility will 
provide instructions  regarding the preparation and shipment of the data.  Interpretations 
from the independent review will not be sent to the site.  Subject treatment management will be based on review by the local investigator and/or site staff.
Disease Response Criteria
Complete Remission (CR)
CR requires all of the following criteria:
●Peripheral blood lymphocytes (evalu ated by blood and differential count) 
below 4 × 109/L (4000/μ L)
●Absence of lymphadenopathy (absence of nodes > 15 mm in longest diameter 
or any extra nodal disease) by physical examination and CT scan
●No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly by physical examination (as determined by 
measurement below the relevant costal margin) and CT scan (if abnormal prior to therapy or if physical exam is inconclusive at the time of evaluation)
●Absence of disease or constitutional symptoms (B symptoms:  unexplained fevers > 38°C or 100.4°F, drenching night sweats, > 10% body mass weight 
loss in the preceding 6 months)
●Blood counts above the following laboratory values:
○Neutrophils > 1.5 × 10
9/L [1500/μL] (without the need for exogenous
growth factors)
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
98
○Platelets > 100 × 109/L [100,000/ μL] (without the need for platelet 
transfusion or exogenous growth factors)
○Hemoglobin > 110 g/L [11 g/dL] (without the need for blood transfusions 
or exogenous eryth ropoietin)
●Bone marrow at least normocellular for age, < 30 % of nucleated cells being 
lymphocytes.  Lymphoid nodul es should be absent.  Bone marrow aspirate and 
biopsy should be performed as soon as possible after CR/CRi has been 
achieved by laboratory tests, physical exam and CT scan.  If the bone marrow 
is hypocellular, a repeat determination should be made in 4 weeks or when peripheral blood counts have recovered.  A marrow biopsy should be 
compared to a pre-treatment marrow if available.  Subjects who are otherwise 
in a complete remission, but bone marrow nodules can be identified 
histologically should be considered to be nodular PR (nPR) .  
Immunohistochemistry should be performed  to define whether these nodules 
are composed of primarily T cells or lymphocytes other than CLL cells, or CLL cells.
Complete Remission with Inc omplete Marrow Recovery (CRi)
Subjects who fulfill the criteria for CR (including bone marrow) but who have persistent 
cytopenia (anemia or thrombocytopenia or neutropenia) apparently unrelated to CLL but related to drug toxicity will be considered CRi.  The marrow evaluation described above should be performed with scrutiny and not show any clonal infiltrate.
Partial Remission (PR)
To be considered a PR at least 2of the following must be met:
●≥  50% decrease in peripheral blood lymphocyte count from the pretreatment
baseline value.
●≥  50% reduction in lymphadenopathy.
●≥  50% reduction in the enlargement of the liver and/or spleen (if abnormal 
prior to therapy).
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20

In addition at least one of the following criteria must be met:
●Neutrophils ∀1,500/# L or ≥50% improvement over baseline.
●Platelets > l00,000/ #L or ≥ 50% improvement over baseline.
●Hemoglobin > 11.0 g/dL or ≥ 50% improvement over baseline without 
transfusions or exogenous growth factors.

of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly.
i. Without the need for exogenous growth factors or transfusions.
To be assigned a status of PR, the response must be confirmed no earlier than 8 weeks 
after the clinical criteria for response are first met.
5.3.3.2 Definition of Disease Progression
Disease progression according to 2008 Modified IWCLL NCI-WG Guidelines for Tumor 
Response is characterized by at least one of the following:
●Appearance of any new lesion, such as enlarged lymph nodes (> 1.5 cm), 
splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, or other organ infiltrates.  An increase by 50% 
or more in greatest determined diameter  of any previous site and > 1.5 cm.
●An increase in the previously noted enlargement of the liver or spleen by 50% or more or the de novo appearance of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly.
●An increase in the number of blood lymphocytes by 50% or more with at least 5,000 B lymphocytes per microliter.  The increase should be assessed against 
the best response while on study.
●Transformation to a more aggressive  histology (e.g., Richter's Syndrome).  
Whenever possible, this diagnosis should be established by lymph node 
biopsy.  For subjects experiencing disease progression due to Richter's Syndrome while on study, supplemental data may be collected.
●Occurrence of cytopenia (neutrope nia, anemia or thrombocytopenia) 
attributable to CLL only if confirmed by a bone marrow assessment showing unequivocal progression.

5.3.3.3 Definition of Stable Disease
Patients who have not achieved a CR or a PR, or who have not exhibited PD, will be 
considered to have stable disease.
5.3.4 Safety Variables
The following safety evaluations will be performed during the study:  adverse event 
monitoring, vital signs, physical examination, ECG, and laboratory assessments.
5.3.5 Pharmacokinetic Variables
Values for the PK parameters of venetoclax, including the apparent clearance (CL/F), and 
the apparent volume of distribution (V/F), may be determined using a population PK approach.  Additional parameters may be calculated if useful in the interpretation of the data.
5.3.6 Pharmacogenetic Variables
DNA samples may be analyzed for genetic factors contributing to the subject's response to 
venetoclax in terms of pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety.  Such genetic factors may include, for example, drug metabolizing enzymes, drug transport proteins, CLL prognostic markers and Bcl-2 family member s.  Some genes currently insufficiently 
characterized or unknown may be understood to be important at the time of analysis.  These samples may be analyzed as part of a multicenter, multi-st udy project to identify 
genetic factors involved in the response to study drugs.  The samples may also be used for the development of diagnostic tests related to venetoclax (or drugs of this class).  The results of pharmacogenetic analyses may not be reported with the study summary.
5.3.7 Biomarker Variables
Several putative biomarkers of efficacy and response may be evaluated in this protocol 
with the goal of defining the relationship between various disease markers and disease 
status.  Biospecimens collected during the course of this study may be banked and used in the future to investigate new scientific questions  related to this study.  The samples may 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
104
also be used for diagnostic test development.  AbbVie (or a designated laboratory) will 
store the samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  The samples will be retained while research on venetoclax (or drugs of this class) continues but no longer than 20 years.
Examination of the serum components of subjects on this venetoclax clinical trial may 
reveal patterns of cell-free nucleic acids, proteins/peptides or metabolites that may be further evaluated in future clinical studies to determine any prognostic value and any correlation with clinical response.  Serum samples may also be analyzed for predictive or drug-responsive markers.  In the event that any serum samples are unused, remaining samples may be banked for use in diagnostic test development efforts.
DNA methylation regulates gene expression (inactivates certain genes and their normal 
role); aberrant methylation of specific genes is associated with cancer development and poor clinical outcome.  Genes with variable methylation status that are known to have prognostic implications may be assessed in the trial.  These analyses may examine putative stratification markers for correlation for efficacy.
Venetoclax inhibits the ability of cancer cells to evade cell death, or apoptosis, by 
blocking the activity of the an ti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.  Nonclinical studies have 
demonstrated a pattern of response to venetoclax based on the lev els of Bcl-2 family 
proteins.  High levels of Bcl-2 a nd low levels of Mcl-1 and Bcl-X
Lare generally 
predictive of response to this drug in vitro.  Therefore, the proteins levels of relevant BCL-2 family members may be determined in  tumor cells isolated from the bone marrow 
aspirate and examined for c orrelations with efficacy.
Genetic amplification, chromosomal loss and/or mutational/methylation status of various genes represent genetic lesions potentially  associated with s ubject outcome.  Nucleic 
acids, protein expression, and/or mutational/methylation analysis may be conducted on CLL cells isolated from blood, bone marrow and/or tumor tissue samples and/or DNA/RNA extracted from serum from subjects participating in this study.  Analysis of the nucleic acids can be used to identify and track the CLL cells for MRD.  The analysis 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
105
may include but is not limited to members of the BCL-2 family, p53, Notch-1 and other 
genes/proteins that may be informative to ve netoclax mechanism of action or CLL disease 
progression.  Additionally, comprehensive genomic sequencing of CLL cells isolated 
from the blood or bone marrow aspirate may also be performed.  FISH may be conducted on tissue from tumor samples and/or CLL cells from subjects participating in this study to assess amplifications and translocations in the Bcl-2 gene and other alteration in genes associated with CLL, which may prove to be informative.  The potential relationship 
between amplification/loss/mutation/methylatio n of these genes and the clinical outcome 
in these subjects may be examined as a subject stratification tool.  Biospecimens collected during the course of this study may be banked and used in the future to investigate new scientific questions related to this study.
5.3.8 Health Economic and Patient-Reported Outcome Measures
MDASI
The MDASI is a multi-symptom PRO measure for clinical and research use.  The 
M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory37contains 13 core symptom severity items (pain, 
fatigue, nausea, disturbed sleep, distess [emotional], shortness of breath, lack of appetite, drowsiness, dry mouth, sadness, vomiting, difficulty remembering, and numbness or tingling), 6 symptom interference items  (general activity,  mood, walking ab ility, normal 
work, relations with other people, and enjoyment of life), and 5 chronic lymphocytic leukemia specific items (abdominal pain, lymph node pain, night sweating, fevers/temperature fluctuation, and frequent infections).
Mean symptom, symptom interference, domain and total scores will be calculated for 
each observation as defined in the MDASI scoring manual and then summarized (mean, std. dev., median) at each assessment; in addition mean change in each of these values (final assessment versus baseline) will be calculated to identify any statistically significant differences versus baseline.

EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ CLL16
The EORTC QLQ-C30 consists of a Global Health Status/QoL scale, a Financial 
Difficulties scale, five Functional scales (Cognitive Functioning, Social Functioning, Physical Functioning, Emotional Functioning, and Role Functioning), and eight Symptom scales/items (Fatigue, Insomnia, Appetite Loss, Pain, Constipation, Diarrhea, Dyspnea, and Nausea and Vomiting).
Each of these domains will be calculated as per the EORTC scoring manual, and 
summarized (mean, std. dev., median) at each assessment; in addition mean change in each of these values (final assessment versus baseline) will be calculated to identify any statistically significant differences versus baseline.
The five EORTC QLQ CLL16 domains (Fatigue, Treatment Side Effects and Disease 
Symptoms, Infection, Social Activities, Fut ure Health Worries) will be summarized 
(mean, std. dev., median) at each assessment; in addition mean change in each of these values (final assessment versus baseline) will be calculated to identify any statistically significant differences versus baseline.

EQ-5D-5L and EQ-5D-VAS
The EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-5L) is a generic preference instrument that has been validated in numerous populations.  The EQ-5 D-5L has five dimensions:  mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. These dimensions are 
measured on a five level scale:  no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems.  The EQ-5D-5L also contains a visual analog scale (VAS) to assess the subject's overall health.

5.4 Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment
5.4.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subjects
Each subject has the right to withdraw from the study at any time.  In addition, the 
investigator will discontinue a subject from the study at any time if the investigator considers it necessary for any reason including:
●The subject's response to therapy is unsatisfactory, as evidenced by 
progression of disease while on study drug;
●The subject requires radiotherapy, cancer-related surgery as a result of tumor progression, or alternate anti-neoplastic agents during the study period;
●Noncompliance with the protocol.
Subjects with disease progression may continue to receive treatment when, in the opinion 
of the investigator, it is in the subject's best interest to stay on drug.  Disease progression will be captured in EDC per modified IWCLL NCI-WG criteria as described in Section 5.3.3.2 of the protocol.  The patient will be monitored per study procedures 
described in Section 5.3.1.1 or more often if the investigator considers it necessary.
Subjects with disease progression who continue to receive venetoclax will also be allowed to receive other agents approved to treat CLL in addition to venetoclax.  This will be added at the discretion of the investigator, and AbbVie or its partners will not reimburse for treatment agents or for the procedures require d to monitor subjects other than those 
required per protocol.
The investigator will inform AbbVie prior to discontinuing a subject from the study by 
contacting the Clinical Team Leader as identified in Section 6.2.  All subjects will be 
included for analysis of safety data.  Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
108
In the event that a subject withdraws or is di scontinued from the study, the reason(s) for 
the discontinuation from the study will be recorded.  Final visit procedures as listed in 
Table 4 will be performed as soon as possible after discontinuation from the study.
At the end of the subject's participation in the study, the calendars/diaries are to be returned to the site and appropriately filed with the subject's source documents for this study.
A Safety Follow-Up Visit should be performed for all subjects a pproximately 30 days 
following discontinuation of study drug and then as clinically appropriate for safety 
assessment.  The subject will be followed until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the adverse event is achieved.
A separate Safety Follow-Up Visit does not need to be performed for subjects who had a 
Final Visit conducted > 30 days after discontinuation of study drug and did not require additional adverse event follow-up.  If the subject refuses or is unable to attend the Safety Follow-Up Visit, this should be no ted in the subject's source documentation.
For subjects who discontinue venetoclax (e.g., due to toxicity or stem cell/bone marrow transplant), post-treatment follow-up visits will be performed every 3 months until discontinuation from the study.  Post-Treatment follow-up visits are not required for subjects who have discontinued due to disease progression or a subject's refusal of the Post-Treatment visits.  This will be for a period of up to 5 years after the last subject has enrolled on the study.
Survival information (i.e., the date and cause of death, post treatment cancer therapies, 
etc.) will be collected via telephone calls and/or clinical visits at 3 month intervals after the last study visit for a period of 5 years after the last subject has enrolled on the study for subjects who have not withdrawn consent.  Additionally, information regarding Richter's Transformation and second primary malignancies will also be collected during this period for subjects who have not withdrawn consent.

109
In the event that a positive result is obtained on a pregnancy test for a subject or a subject 
reports becoming pregnant during the study, the administration of study drug must be discontinued immediately.  The investigator must report a pregnancy within 1 working day of the site being aware to one of the AbbVie representatives listed in Section 6.1.6 or 
Section 6.2.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
AbbVie may terminate this study prematurely, eith er in its entirety or at any study site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended termination.  The investigator may also terminate the study at his/her site for reasonable cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination.  Advance notice is not required by either party if the study is stopped due to safety concerns.
If, in the judgment of the investigator and AbbVie, the continued exposure to the study 
drug represents a significant risk to subjects, the study will be stopped.  The following procedures for discontinuation will be followed:
●If the sponsor has decided to prematurely discontinue the study, the sponsor 
will promptly notify in writing the investig ator as well as regulatory authorities 
of the decision and give detailed reasons for the discontinuation.
●The investigator must promptly notify the IEC/IRB and give detailed reasons 
for the discontinuation.
●The investigator must promptly notify the enrolled subjects of the premature 
discontinuation and administer appropriate treatments such as replacement of the treatment regimen, if applicable, by other appropriate regimens.
5.5 Treatments
5.5.1 Treatments Administered
Each dose of venetoclax will be taken with approximately 240 mL of water within 
30 minutes after the completion of breakfast or the subject's first meal of the day.
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
110
If the subject vomits after taking venetoclax, no additional dose should be taken that day 
and the next dose should be taken at the usual time the next day.  Any dose of venetoclax can be given up to 8 hours after its usual time, in which case the following day's dose should be taken at the usual time.  If a dose of venetoclax is missed by more than 8 hours, the dose should not be taken that day, and s hould not be made up.  The next dose should 
be taken at the usual time the next day.
5.5.2 Identity of Investigational Product

5.5.2.1 Packaging and LabelingThe venetoclax tablets will be packaged in high density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic 
bottles or blister packs to accommodate the st udy design.  Each container will be labeled 
per local regulatory requirements.
Blister Packs will contain study drug for one week plus one extra day.  Subjects will be 
instructed to take the extra day's dose (noted with an "X" on the Blister Pack) only if directed by the investigator.
5.5.2.2 Storage and Disposition of Study Drug
The investigational products supplied in this study are for investigational use only, and are 
to be used only within this study.  All clinical supplies must be maintained under adequate security and stored under conditions specified on the label.
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
111
The tablets must be stored at 15° to 25°C (59° to 77°F).
5.5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
There is no randomization schedule for this study.  Subjects will be assigned a unique 
consecutive subject number at Screening.  In the main cohort, subject numbers will consist of 5 digits (XXX01), with the first t hree digits denoting site number and the last 
2 digits as the subject number, beginning with 01.  In the safety expansion cohort, subject numbers will also consist of 5 digits (XXX50), wi th the first three digits denoting site 
number and the last 2 digits as the subject number, beginning with 50.  All subjects will be enrolled using an IxRS.  Before the study is initiated, each site will be provided with the IxRS user instructions, which provides direction on how to use the IxRS via the Web or the telephone.  Since this is an open-label study, subjects will maintain the same subject number regardless of the number of re-screens and through the duration of the study.  The site, in conjunction with the sponsor, will be responsible for assignment of all 
unique subject numbers at Screening and dose assignments if the subject is not a screening failure.
5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Selection of the dose for this study is discussed in Section 5.6.4 .  Each dose of venetoclax 
will be taken with approximately 240 mL of water.  On days that pre-dose PK sampling is 
required, dosing will occur in the morning to facilitate PK sampling.  On all other dosing days subjects will be trained to self-admin ister venetoclax orally QD within 30 minutes 
after the completion of breakfast or the subject's first meal of the day.
5.5.5 Blinding
This is an open-label, single arm study.
5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
The investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will 
administer/dispense study drug only to subjects enrolled in the study in accordance with 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
112
the protocol.  The study  drug must not  be used for reasons other than that described in the 
protocol.
To document compliance with the treatment reg imen, subjects will be instructed to return 
all unused tablets and/or containers, even if empty and any other study related items as 
necessary, to the study coordinator at sc heduled study visits.  Compliance will be 
monitored and documented by the study coordinator on the appropriate form.  The study coordinator will question the subject regarding adherence to the dosing regimen, record the number of tablets and/or containers returned, the date returned and determine treatment compliance before dispensing new study drug to the subject.  Compliance below 80% will require counseling of the subject by study site personnel.
5.5.7 Drug Accountability
Documentation of the receipt of supplies will be supported by a signed and dated Proof of 
Receipt or similar shipping document in IxRS.  A current (running) and accurate 
inventory of study drug will be kept by the site and will include lot number, Proof of 
Receipt number(s), container numbers, blister pack numbers, and the date on which study drug is administered to the subject.
An overall accountability of study drug will be performed and verified by AbbVie or the 
designated monitor(s) throughout the study and at the study site closeout visit.  Upon completion or termination of the study, all original containers (containing partially used or unused study drug) will be returned to AbbVie according to instructions from AbbVie or the designated monitor(s).  If pre-arranged b etween AbbVie and the site, destruction of 
used and unused study drug containers will be performed at the site.  Empty containers 
will be destroyed at the site.  Labels must remain attached to the containers.
5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
There are currently no treatments approved and labeled specifically to meet the need of 
the 17p deletion population and currently available treatments for the broader CLL population, such as FCR and BR, are not adequate for this patient population.  Due to the 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
113
limited effectiveness of available therapies, treatment guidelines recommend enrollment 
in clinical trials as a preferred treatment option for patients with 17p deletion.  Those patients who achieve a response to initial therapy should be considered for an allogeneic transplant.  For relapsed/refractory patients not eligible for an allogeneic transplant, suggested regimens in cases where a clinical trial is not available include alemtuzumab; however, alemtuzumab has limited use due to its toxicity profile and its efficacy signals are more limited in subjects with bulky disease.
Untreated CLL patients who harbor the 17p deletion have generally a short first remission 
if they respond to conventional chemotherapy such as fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) and alemtuzumab, because 17p deletion is a prognostic marker for nonresponse to standard chemotherapy.  Thus, novel treatment strategies, which act independently of the p53 signaling pathway are needed.
Antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members are associated with tumor initiation, disease 
progression, and drug resistance, and thus are compelling targets for antitumor therapy.  Venetoclax is a first-in-class, orally bioavailable small molecule Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor that binds with high affinity to Bcl-2 and with lower affinity to other Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-X
Land Bcl-w.  The mechanism of action of venetoclax is independent 
of the TP53 pathway.  Briefly, venetoclax inhibits Bcl-2 allowing the release of BIM, which includes oligomerization of pro-apoptotic molecules such as BAK and BAX.  This triggers rapid apoptosis, bypassing the TP53 pathway.
Preliminary data from the ongoing venetoclax first-in-human study, Study M12-175, had 
indicated a strong efficacy signal in oncolog y subjects. In the CLL Arm A, 56 subjects 
have been dosed with 54 evaluable. Best response reported for 54 evaluable subjects with 
CLL/SLL was 7 (13%) s ubjects with complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete 
marrow recovery (CRi), 39 (72%) with partial remission (PR),4 (7%) with stable disease 
(SD), 0% with progressive disease (PD), and 4 (7%) subjects discontinued prior to Week 6. The response rate (CR + PR) was 85%.

Sixteen (28.6%) of 56 subjects with relapsed/refractory CLL had a 17p deletion, as 
evaluated by FISH. Subjects with the 17p delet ion remained on study for a median of 
159 days (range:  33 to 495 days).  Best response in all 16 CLL subjects with a 17p deletion was 1 (6%) subject with CR/CRi, 13 (81%) with PR, 1 with SD (6%), 0% with PD, and 1 (6%) discontinued prior to Week 6; the response rate was 88%.
Updated safety and efficacy data are described in detail in the Investigator Brochure.

5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups
There are no control groups in this study.
5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard pharmacokinetic, statistical, clinical, and laboratory procedures will be utilized 
in this study.
5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population
Subjects with relapsed or refractory CLL who harbor 17p deletion will be selected to 
participate in the main cohort of this study.  In addition, subjects in the main cohort of the 
study must have 17p deletion, assessed by central laboratory and determined by FISH using the Vysis CLL probe kit.  Subjects must have relapsed or be refractory after receiving at least one prior treatment regimen.  Subjects with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated CLL who harbor 17p deletion will be selected to participate in the safety expansion cohort of this study.  Subjects in the Safety Expansion Cohort must have 17p deletion, assessed by local laboratory or by central laborat ory.  Pre-clinical and 
clinical findings support the possibility of e fficacy in this pati ent population.  As CLL 
subjects with 17p deletion who relapse have very limited treatment options, it is appropriate to enroll such subjects in a clinical trial of an investigational agent.

5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
The dose of 400 mg was selected on the basis of preliminary data in relapsed/refractory 
CLL/SLL subjects from the ongoing venetoclax first-in-human Study M12-175.  
A time-to-response model and a logistic-re gression model were developed using data 
from Study M12-175 to understand the relationship between the response outcome and 
the final target venetoclax dose.  Both models found that a faster response was achieved with a higher final target dose.  Further analysis focused on comparing 400 mg and 600 mg as the final target dose showed a minimum difference on the overall response rate (i.e., percentage of subjects with partial response or better).  With doses below 400 mg QD, however, a longer (and clinically unfavorable) duration will be needed to achieve the same response rate.  Since there is no strong difference between 400 mg and 600 mg as the final dose, the 400 mg dose was selected as the minimum effective dose.  This 400 mg QD venetoclax dose has been deemed tolerable in Study M12-175.
To mitigate the risk for TLS, a step-wise lead-in period (up to 5 weeks) will be employed 
to escalate venetoclax dose to the treatment dose of 400 mg.
The maximum dose in this study is 400 m g, however currently the established maximum 
clinical dose of venetoclax is not to exceed 1200 mg/day for a duration not to exceed 
48 months based on genotoxicity studies.

6.1 Medical Complaints
The investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse 
events on a routine basis throughout the study.  The investigator will assess and record any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, severity, time course (end d ate, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the 
adverse event to study drug, and any action(s) taken.  For serious adverse events considered as having "no reasonable possibility" of being associated with study drug, the investigator will provide an "Other" cause of the event.  For adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity.  Adverse events, whether in response to a quer y, observed by site personnel, or reported 
spontaneously by the subject will be recorded.
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1.1 Definitions
6.1.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this  treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional ove rdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any 
worsening of a pre-existing condition or illne ss is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse 
events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
117
medical intervention, meets protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.1.8 regarding toxicity 
management) and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events. 
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery/procedure is b eing performed for a pre-existing condition and 
the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned prior to study entry.  However, if the 
pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpected ly during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
A treatment-emergent adverse event is defined as any adverse event reported by a subject 
with onset or worsening from the time that the first dose of venetoclax is administered 
until 30 days have elapsed following discontinuation of study drug administration.
6.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious 
adverse event.
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would have 
been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospitalization or 
Prolongation of 
HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any 
length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay.  This 
does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
118
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of d aily living of a study subject.  
Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influen za, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in d eath or hospitalization, but based
on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the 
outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-threatening, 
hospitalization, prolongation of  hospitalization, congenital 
anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  
Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or 
stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, bl ood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
Hospitalization of a subject to allow observation and management (e.g., for IV hydration) 
for the purpose of TLS prophylaxis will not be captured as a serious adverse event (SAE), 
unless there is an additional reason for hospitalization or an additional criterion for seriousness other than hospitalization (e.g., abnormal post-dose TLS laboratories that necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, etc.).
Certain adverse events are anticipated to occur in the study population (CLL) at some 
frequency independent of drug exposure.  Such events include known consequences of the 
underlying disease under investigation (e.g., symptoms, disease progression) and events unlikely to be related to the underlying disease under investigation but common in the 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
119
study population independent of drug therapy (e.g., cardiovascular events in an elderly 
population).
These events are listed in Appendix E .
These adverse events may occur alone or in various combinations and are considered 
expected for reporting purposes for this protocol.
An Independent Data Monitoring Co mmit tee will monitor the incidence of these expected 
events during the study.  An aggregate report of any clinically relevant imbalances that do 
not favor the test product will be submitted to health authorities.
Although exempted from expedited reporting to certain Health Authorities and ECs/IRBs 
as individual cases, if an event commonly associated with CLL or progression of CLL meets seriousness criteria, it must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event (as defined in Section 6.1.6 ).  For deaths related 
to disease progression (coded to malignant neoplasm progression), the date and cause of death will be recorded on the appropriate case report form, but the event will not be expedited as an individual case safety report (ICSR) to regulatory authorities.
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will rate the severity of each adverse event according to the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE Version 4.0).
42  If a reported adverse event increases in severity, the initial adverse event 
should be given final outcome date and a new adverse event must be reported to reflect the change in severity.  The dates on the AE's cannot overlap.  For all reported serious adverse events that increase in severity, th e supplemental eCRFs also need to be updated 
to reflect any changes due to the increase in severity.  For adverse events not captured by the Common Terminology Criteria, the following should be used:
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
120
Grade 1 The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by the subject 
(mild).
Grade 2 The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's usual activities (moderate).
Grade 3 The adverse event causes considerable interference with the 
subject's usual activities and may be incapacitating (moderate to 
severe).
Grade 4 The adverse event is life-threatening requiring urgent 
intervention (severe).
Grade 5 The adverse event resulted in death of the subject (severe).
6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
No Reasonable PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study  drug will be considered "not associated."  
In addition, when the investigator has not repor ted causality or deemed it not assessable, 
AbbVie will consider the event associated.  If an investigator's opinion of no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug is gi ven, an "Other" cause of event must be 
provided by the investigator for the serious adverse event.

6.1.4 Adverse Events Expected Due to Study Related Endpoints
6.1.4.1 Deaths
For this protocol, overall survival is an e fficacy endpoint.  Deaths that occur during the 
protocol specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 6.1.6 ) that are more likely 
related to disease progression will therefore be  an expected adverse event and will not be 
subject to expedited reporting.
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be reported.  The term "sudden death" should only be used for the occurrence of an abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without pre-existing heart disease, within 1 hour of the onset of acute symptoms or, in the case of an unwitnessed death, within 24 hours after the patient was last seen alive and stable.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, "unexplained death" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should not be replaced by the established cause of death. 
6.1.4.2 Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of Disease
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the 
underlying disease are also considered an expected outcome for this study and will not be subject to expedited reporting.
6.1.5 Adverse Event Collection Period
All adverse events (serious and nonser ious) reported from the time of study drug 
administration until 30 days following discontinuation of study drug administration will 
be collected, whether elicited or spontaneously reported by the subject.
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
122
Serious adverse events occurring after the study-specific informed consent is signed, but 
prior to the first dose of venetoclax, will be collected only if they are considered by the investigator to be causally related to the study-required procedures.
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 3 .
Figure 3. Adverse Event Collection
* Only if considered by the investigator to be causally related to study required procedures.
6.1.6 Adverse Event Reporting
In the event of a serious adverse event, whether related to study drug or not, the 
investigator will notify Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the serious adverse event by entering the serious adverse event by email.
In the event of a serious adverse event, whether related to study drug or not, the 
Investigator will notify Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event by enteri ng the serious adverse event data into the 
electronic data capture (E DC) system.  Serious adverse events that occur prior to the site 
having access to the RAVE
®system or if RAVE is not operable, should be documented 
on the SAE Non-CRF forms and emailed (preferred route) or faxed to Clinical Pharmacovigilance and Oncology Safety Management within 24 hours of site awareness.

Venetoclax (ABT-199)

124
The sponsor will be responsible for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(SUSAR) reporting for the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC.  The reference document used for SUSAR reporting in the EU countries will be the most current version of the Investigator's Brochure.
Serious adverse events that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated by local regulations, 
will be reported to both responsible Ethics Co mmit tees and Regulatory Agencies as 
required by local regulations.  During the conduct of the study, the investigator should promptly provide wr itten reports (e.g., ICH Expedited Reports or any additional reports 
required by local regulations) to the IEC/IRB of any changes that affect the conduct of the study and/or increase the risk to subjects.  Written documentation of the submission to the IEC/IRB should also be provided to AbbVie.
6.1.7 Pregnancy
Pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to an AbbVie representative (Section 6.1.6
or Section 6.2) within 1 working day of the site becoming aware of the pregnancy.  
Subjects who become pregnant during the study must be discontinued (Section 5.4.1 ).
All subjects should be informed that contraceptive measures should be taken throughout 
the study and for 30 days after discontinuing study drug.  Male subjects should be informed that contraceptive measures should be taken by their female partner.  Information regarding a pregnancy occurrence in  a study subject and the outcome of the 
pregnancy will be collected.  In the event of a pregnancy occurring in the partner of an enrolled subject, written informed consent for release of medical information from the partner must be obtained prior to the collection of any pregnancy-specific information and the pregnancy will be followed to outcome.
Pregnancy in a study subject is not considered an adverse event.  However, the medical 
outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is considered a serious adverse event and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event.

6.1.8 Toxicity Management
6.1.8.1 Prophylaxis and Management of Tumor Lysis Syndrome
There is a potential for tumor lysis syndrome in subjects, affected by hematologic 
malignancies especially in those with bulky disease, elevated pretreatment lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, elevated le ukocyte count, renal dysfunction, and 
dehydration.
In response to the events of TLS reported in the Phase 1 studies in subjects with diagnosis 
of relapsed or refractory CLL treated with venetoclax monotherapy or in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody, an extensive review of the safety data was performed across all CLL trials in January of 2013.  These clinical data suggest that subjects with higher 
tumor burden are at increased risk of TLS.  Reduced creatinine clearance could further increase the risk among subjects with highe r tumor burden.  Data analyses have resulted 
in development of three risk categories, listed below.  The risk category for an individual subject is determined upon study entry.
A detailed description of risk factors for dev eloping tumor lysis following treatment with 
venetoclax is available in the current Investigator's Brochure.The section below describes the management of subjects throughout dosing based on their 
risk factors for developing TLS identified upon study entry.
TLS Prophylaxis and Monitoring Checklist will be completed throughout the lead-in 
period to ensure proper TLS prophylaxis measures.
For tumor lysis syndrome prophylaxis, subjects have been classified in 3 risk categories 
based on the risk for developing medically concerning TLS with venetoclax administration.  The tumor burden assessed by the nodal disease and absolute lymphocyte count at screening has been used to define each category as described below:
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
126
Risk Categories for Developing TLS
TLS Risk Category Criteria
Low All measurable lymph nodes with the largest diameter < 5 cm 
by radiologic assessment AND ALC < 25 × 109/L
Medium Any measurable lymph node with the largest diameter ≥ 5 cm 
but < 10 cm by radiologic assessment OR ALC ≥ 25 × 109/L
High Any measurable lymph node with the largest diameter ≥ 10 cm 
by radiologic assessment 
ORALC ≥ 25 × 10
9/L AND any measurable lymph node with the 
largest diameter ≥ 5 cm but < 10 cm by radiologic assessment
First Dose of Venetoclax at 20 mg and at 50 mg
Tumor lysis syndrome prophylaxis must be initiated in all subjects irrespective of their 
TLS risk category prior to the first dose of venetoclax at 20 mg and at 50 mg.  Tumor 
lysis syndrome prophylaxis includes:
●An oral agent to reduce the uric acid level (e.g., allopurinol) to be initiated at 
least 72 hours prior to dosing.  Treatment may need to be continued for 
approximately 5 weeks based on the ongoing risk of TLS development.  Subjects allergic to allopurinol must use another uric acid reducer.
●Oral hydration consisting of fluid intake of 1.5 to 2 L per day starting at least 
48 hours prior to the start of treatment for all subjects prior to first dose and at 
all subsequent dose es calations and continued for at least 24 hours after dosing 
and all of the chemistries laboratory va lues remain within ULN.  Oral 
hydration is recommended beyond 24 hours post-dose for subjects who 
demonstrate any laboratory changes.  Or al hydration should be maintained, as 
tolerated, even during the days the subjects receive IV hydration.
●Serum chemistry and hematology laboratory samples (low and medium risk subjects) must be drawn anytime within 72 hours prior to first dose at 20 mg 
and at 50 mg, and electrolyte values should be reviewed and not demonstrate 
any clinically significant abnormalities prior to the first dose of venetoclax in 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
127
order to keep the treatment on schedule.  The investigator's decision to proceed 
with venetoclax treatment initiation may  be based on these laboratory values.
●For subjects demonstrating any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities in this baseline laboratory assessment, the first dose of venetoclax at 20 mg 
and at 50 mg must be delayed until resolution and management of the laboratory a bnormalities should be initiated, per the protocol Appendix D
(Recommendations for Initial Management of Electrolyte Abnormalities and Prevention of Tumor Lysis Syndrome [TLS]).  If needed, the subject should receive additional treatment prior to the initiation of dosing.
Additional TLS prophylaxis and monitoring procedures are tailored to the individual TLS 
risk category as follows:
Low Risk Category
Subjects in the Low Risk category can begin the venetoclax lead-in period in the 
outpatient setting if there is no indication to hospitalize.
●For subjects who are unable to maintain adequate oral hydration, IV hydration 
of 1.5 to 2 L is recommended in the outpatient setting on Day 1 of 20 mg and 
50 mg dose to assure this  full amount of hydration is achieved.  In subjects for 
whom volume overload is considered a significant risk, hospitalization should 
be considered.
●Chemistry and hematology laboratory tes ts are to be collected within 72 hours 
prior to the first dose of venetoclax at 20 mg and at 50 mg.  These laboratory 
values must be reviewed by the investigator.  The investigator's decision to proceed with veneto clax treatment initiation may be based on these laboratory 
values.
●Chemistry laboratory tests must be performed by local laboratory STAT at 0 hour (pre-dose, within 4 hours before venetoclax administration), 8, and 24* hours post-dose after the first dose of venetoclax at 20 mg and at 50 mg.  
These laboratory values must be reviewed in real t ime by the investigator.  
0 hour (pre-dose) laboratory values will be collected and used as baseline to 
assess potential electrolyte abnormali ties occurring post venetoclax 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
128
administration.  Results from 0 hour (pre-dose) laboratory values are not 
required to be available prior to initiating venetoclax treatment.  Subjects must 
remain at the hospital or clinic until the 8 hour laboratory values have been reviewed by the investigator.
●Day 2 dose should not be administered until the 24 hours post-dose chemistry 
laboratory values are reviewed by the investigator.
●If no significant findings suggestive of clinical or lab TLS occur within 
24 hours, the same dose will be continued until Day 7 in the outpatient setting.
●If any significant laboratory changes are observed within the first 24 hours after initiation of dosing, see Appendix D , (Recommendations for Initial 
Management of Electrolyte Abnormalities and Prevention of Tumor Lysis 
Syndrome [TLS]) for additional laboratory assessments and management 
guidelines.  If aggressive correction of electrolytes abnormalities is performed, 
the subsequent dose of venetoclax can only be given when electrolytes have 
been stable without any more  treatment for at least 24 hours.
○Additional laboratory assessments may be performed per investigator 
discretion.
●Hematology laboratory tests must be performed 0 hour (pre-dose, within 4 hours before venetoclax administration), and 24* hours post-dose after the 
first dose of venetoclax at 20 mg and at 50 mg.
* All 24 hours post-dose laboratory assessments may be taken within a 
2 hour window, if necessary.
Medium Risk Category
●Subjects in Medium Risk category who have creatinine clearance ≥ 80 mL/min 
will receive their initial doses of venetoclax at 20 and 50 mg as outpatients. 
●Subjects in the Medium Risk category who have creatinine clearance of 
< 80 mL/min and/or higher tumor burden (i.e., ALC > 100 × 10
9/L or multiple 
bulky nodes), may be handled as high ri sk subjects, per investigator discretion, 
for the first dose of venetoclax at 20 mg and 50 mg (Refer to section for high risk subjects below).
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
129
●Subjects in Medium Risk category (independently of their creatinine clearance 
and/or tumor burden) will receive IV hydration of 1.5 to 2 L in the outpatient 
setting on Day 1 of 20 mg and 50 mg dose.  In subjects for whom volume overload is considered a significant risk, hospitalization should be considered.
●Chemistry and hematology laboratory tests are to be collected within 72 hours prior to the first dose of venetoclax at 20 mg and at 50 mg.  These laboratory 
values must be reviewed by the investigator.  The investigator's decision to 
proceed with venetoclax treatment initiation may be based on these laboratory values.
●Chemistry laboratory tests must be performed by local laboratory STAT at 
0 hour (pre-dose, within 4 hours before venetoclax administration), 8, and 
24* hours after the first dose of venetoclax at 20 mg and at 50 mg.  These laboratory values must be reviewed in real time by the investigator.  0 hour 
(pre-dose) laboratory values will be collected and used as baseline to assess 
potential electrolyte abnorm alities occ urring post venetoclax administration.  
Results from 0 hour (pre-dose) laboratory values are not required to be 
available prior to initiating venetoclax treatment.  Subjects must remain at the 
hospital, or clinic, until the 8 hour laboratory values have been reviewed by the investigator.
●Day 2 dose should not be administered  until the 24 hours post-dose chemistry 
laboratory values are reviewed by the investigator.
●If no significant findings suggestive of clinical or lab TLS occur within 
24 hours, the same dose will be continued until Day 7 in the outpatient setting. 
●If any significant laboratory changes are observed within the first 24 hours after initiation of dosing, see Appendix D , (Recommendations for Initial 
Management of Electrolyte Abnormalities and Prevention of Tumor Lysis 
Syndrome [TLS]) for additional laboratory assessments and management 
guidelines.  If aggressive correction of  electrolytes abnormalities is performed, 
the subsequent dose of venetoclax can only be given when electrolytes have 
been stable without any more treatment for at least 24 hours.

starting at least 48 hours prior to each dose escalation and continued for at 
least 24 hours after the dose.  IV hydration is encouraged at subsequent dose escalations for subjects who are unable to maintain such oral hydration.  
IV hydration wi ll be in the outpatient setting on the day of dose escalation.  In 
subjects for whom volume overload is considered a significant risk, 
hospitalization should be considered.  Oral hydration should be maintained, as 
tolerated, even during the days the subjects receive IV hydration.
●Chemistry and Hematology laboratory tests for all subjects treated in the 
outpatient setting must be collected within 72 hours prior to the first dose of 
venetoclax of each dose escalation, and results must be reviewed by the investigator prior to each escalation. The investigator's decision to proceed 
with venetoclax treatment initiation may be based on these laboratory values.
●For subjects demonstrating any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities 
in this baseline laboratory assessment, the first dose of venetoclax at 100 mg, 200 mg and at 400 mg must be delayed until resolution and management of the 
laboratory abnormalities should be init iated, per the protocol Appendix D
(Recommendations for Initial Management of Electrolyte Abnormalities and

High Risk Category
Re-Assessment of Risk Category for High-Risk Subjects with Lymph Nodes < 10 cm
Subjects in the high-risk TLS category at screening due to an absolute lymphocyte count 
≥ 25 ∃109/L AND a measurable lymph node with the largest diameter ≥ 5 cm but less 
than 10 cm by radiologic assessment may have a re-evaluation of their TLS risk category based on their most recent ALC for dose escalations after 50 mg.  Based on those results, one of the following two options may be implemented:
1. Re-categori zation to Me dium Risk
If the subject's ALC decreases to < 25 × 10
9/L, the subject may be 
re-categorized as medium-risk for TLS and follow the management guidelines 
for the medium-risk TLS category for subsequent dose escalations of 
venetoclax during the Lead-In Period.
2. Re-categor ization to High Risk
If the subject's ALC remains ≥ 25 × 109/L, the subject will remain in the 
high-risk TLS category and continue to follow management guidelines for high-risk TLS subjects for subsequent dose escalations of venetoclax during the Lead-In Period.
Re-assessment of the subject's TLS risk category  can occur prior to each subsequent dose 
escalation.

Based on clinical observations with the 1st gener ation Bcl-2 inhibitor, navitoclax and in 
vitro colony-forming assays to assess Bcl-2-selective inhibitor effects on granulocyte 
precursors, it is possible that subjects treated with venetoclax might experience neutropenia.  Subjects with a history of ne utropenia, who have received multiple prior 
therapies and/or have significant bone marrow involvement, may be at particular high risk.  If determined to be clinically indicated by the treating physician in compliance with 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20

ASCO guidelines,32G-CSF may be administered during dosing of venetoclax.  The use of 
G-CSF support is strongly recommended for subjects with Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC 
< 500/μ L).  If the subject presents with febrile neutropenia or Grade 4 neutropenia for 
more than one week despite the use of optimal G-CSF support, venetoclax dosing should be interrupted until ANC recovery to > 500/μ L.  Venetoclax may then be re-initiated at a 
lower dose as defined in the following table.  Subjects not responding to G-CSF despite venetoclax interruption should undergo further evaluation to determine the etiology of the neutropenia.

6.1.8.3 Management of Lymphopenia
There is a potential for clinically significant lymphopenia in this study.  If clinically 
indicated, anti-infective prophylaxis should be implemented at the investigator's discretion, including appropriate prophylaxis for viral, fungal, bacterial or Pneumocystis infections.  Potential for drug-drug interactions should be considered.  Most anti-fungals are excluded and other commonly used agents  may be cautionary or prohibited due to 
drug- drug interactions.  Please refer to Table 1 , Table 2 and Appendix C for a description 
of excluded and cautionary medications.
6.1.8.4 Management of Decrease in Spermatogenesis
Based on findings in a preclinical study, there is a potential for decreased 
spermatogenesis.  Male subjects should consider sperm banking before treatment with venetoclax if they are considering preservation of fertility.

8.0 Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample 
Size
8.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
Efficacy analyses will be performed separately for each cohort (main and safety expansion).  Safety analyses will be performed separately for each cohort, and will be pooled for assessment of venetoclax.
8.1.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans –Main Cohort
Efficacy and safety analyses will be performed on all subjects who receive at least one 
dose of venetoclax in the main cohort, unless otherwise specified.
For the primary efficacy analyses, statist ical significance will be d etermined by a 
two-sided pvalue < 0.05 (one-sided < 0.025).
Detailed analysis descriptions for the main cohort will be provided in a statistical analysis 
plan.
8.1.1.1 Baseline Parameters
8.1.1.1.1 Baseline Characteristics
All baseline summary statistics w ill be based on characteristics prior to the initiation of 
study drug.  Unless otherwise stated, baseline for a given variable will be defined as the 
last value for that variable obtained prior to the first dose of study drug.
8.1.1.1.2 Demographics
Descriptive statistics will be provided for baseline demographic variables.  Age, height 
and weight will be summarized with means, medians, standard errors, standard deviations and ranges.  Frequencies and percentages will be provided for gender and race.

8.1.1.1.3 Medical Histories
Frequencies and percentages will be summarized for each medical history parameter.
8.1.1.2 Primary Efficacy
8.1.1.2.1 Primary Efficacy Analyses in Main Cohort
The primary efficacy endpoint will be overall response rate (ORR) – the proportion of 
subjects with an overall response (complete remission, plus complete remission with incomplete bone marrow recovery, plus nodular pa rtial remission, plus partial remission) 
per the NCI-CWG guidelines as assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC) in the first 70 subjects enrolled treated in the main cohort.
The ORR for venetoclax will be tested to reject the null hypothesis of 40%.  If the null 
hypothesis is rejected and the ORR is higher than 40%, then venetoclax has been shown to have an ORR significantly higher than 40%.
In addition, the ninety-five percent (95%) confidence interval for ORR based on binomial 
distribution will be constructed.
The assessment of ORR will be performed once 70 subjects in the main cohort have 
completed the scheduled 36-week disease assessment, have progressed prior to the 36-week disease assessment, discontinued study drug for any reason, or after all treated subjects have discontinued venetoclax, whichever is earlier.  Among these 70 subjects, those who have not achieved a CR, CRi, nPR or confirmed PR prior to the cutoff date will be considered to be non-responders.
8.1.1.2.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses in Main Cohort
Secondary efficacy endpoints will include CR rate, PR rate, duration of overall response, 
progression-free survival, event free survival, time to progression, time or response, time to 50% reduction in ALC, overall survival, and percent of subjects who move on to stem cell transplant.

CR rate will be defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a CR or CRi per the 
NCI-CWG criteria (determined by the IRC in the main cohort).  In addition, the 95% confidence interval based on the binomial distribution will be provided.  Subjects 
who do not achieve a CR or CRi will be considered to be non-responders in the calculation of CR rate.
PR rate per the IRC assessment will be defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved 
a nPR or PR per the NCI-CWG criteria (determined by the IRC in the main cohort).  In addition, the 95% confidence interval based on the binomial distribution will be provided.  Subjects who do not achieve a nPR or PR will be considered to be non-responders in the calculation of PR rate.
Duration of overall response will be defined as the number of days from the date of 
first response (CR, CRi, nPR, or PR) (determined by the IRC in the main cohort) to the earliest recurrence or PD per the IRC assessment.  If a subject is still re sponding, then the 
subject's data will be censored at the date of the subject's last available disease assessment.  For subjects who never experience response, the subject's data will not be included in the analysis.  Duration of overall response will be analyzed by Kaplan-Meier methodology.  Median duration of response will be calculated and the corresponding 95% confidence interval will be presented.
Duration of progression-free survival (PFS) w ill be defined as the number of days from 
the date of first dose to the date of earliest disease progression (determined by the IRC in 
the main cohort) or death.  All disease progression will be included regardless whether the event occurred while the subject was taking the study drug or had previously discontinued the study drug.  If the subject does not experience disease progression or death, then the data will be censored at the date of last disease assessment.  Data for subjects who receive non-protocol, CLL therapy prior to disease progression will be censored at the last disease 
assessment prior to receiving non -protocol therapy.  Data for subjects without any disease 
assessments performed after the baseline visit will be censored at the time of enrollment plus 1 day.  PFS will be analyzed by Kaplan-Meier methodology.  Median time PFS will be calculated and 95% confidence interval for median time PFS will be presented.

Event-free survival (EFS) is defined as the number of days from the date of first dose to 
the date of earliest disease progression, death, or start of a new anti-leukemic therapy.  If the specified event (disease progression, death, start of a new anti-leukemic treatment) does not occur, patients will be censored at the date of last disease assessment.  Data for subjects without any disease assessments performed after the baseline visit will be

Exact data cutoff date for all efficacy and safety analyses will be detailed in a statistical analysis plan (SAP) which will be signed off prior to the data cut-off date.  During this data collection period, active subjects will continue to receive venetoclax, as applicable.  When  data collection is complete and all data 
management quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) procedures are performed, the clinical database data will be extracted for documentation and statist ical analyses.
When all subjects treated into the main cohort have completed the scheduled 36-week disease assessment, have progressed prior to the 36-week disease assessment, or discontinued study drug for any reason, addi tional supplemental efficacy assessments 
based on the IRC review of response will be performed.  Any active subjects will continue to receive venetoclax until they discontinue or for up to 2 years from the date of the last 
subject enrolled in study.
Once the last enrolled subject discontinues/completes the cohort, the cohort will be 
considered complete, and all remaining data will be collected and entered into the clinical database.

database data will be extracted for documentati on and statistical analyses.  Any active 
subjects will continue to receive venetoclax until they discontinue or for up to 2 years from the date of the last subject enrolled in this cohort.
Once the last enrolled subject discontinues/completes the cohort, the cohort will be 
considered complete, and all remaining data will be collected and entered into the clinical database.  A final safety and efficacy assessment on the subjects treated in the safety expansion cohort will be performed once all subjects have completed/discontinued from the cohort.  No statistical testing procedures will be performed and only descriptive statistics and the 95% confidence interval will be presented.

8.1.4.4 Independent Data Monitoring Committee
Interim analysis results will be reviewed by the IDMC after approximately 20 subjects 
have completed approximately 2 – 3 weeks of the lead-in period in the safety expansion cohort.  
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
Approximately 100 subjects will be enrolled in th e main cohort to assess the safety and 
efficacy of venetoclax in subjects with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia (CLL) harboring the 17p deletion.  With this sample size, if a rare adverse event occurs at a rate of 2%, then the probability of observing at least 1 event in a trial with 100 subjects is 86%.
Assuming a peak enrollment rate of 0.11 subjects/site/month, it is anticipated that 
approximately 100 subjects will be enrolled during the 14 month enrollment phase.  The primary assessment of the efficacy of venetoclax will occur around Month 19 at which time 70 subjects should have had their 36-week disease assessment.  The final efficacy summary will occur around Month 38 (two years after last subject enrolled).
Overall response rates for CLL subjects with 17p deletion range from approximately 7% 
to 77% with the higher responses in alternati ve but also more toxic regimens such as 
alemtuzumab + steroids.
24  Conventional therapies such as FCR and BR, demonstrated 
ORRs of 35% and 7%, respectively.  Therefore, a therapy providing significant benefit in overall response rate over a standard rate of 40% would be considered clinically meaningful.
Performing the efficacy analyses at 70 subjects provides at least 90% power (at 2-sided

For the safety expansion cohort, an additional 50 subjects with relapsed/refractory or 
previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) harboring the 17p deletion will be enrolled to assess the modifications made to the initial dosing of venetoclax for the management of TLS.  With this sample size, if a TLS event occurs at a rate of 2%, then the probability of observing at least 1 event in this cohort of 50 subjects is 64%.
9.0 Ethics
9.1 Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requires that the clinical protocol, any protocol amendments, the Investigator's Brochure, the informed consent and all other forms of subject information related to the study (e.g., advertisements used to recruit subjects) and any other necessary documents be reviewed by an IEC/IRB.  The IEC/IRB will review the ethical, scientific and medical appropriateness of the study before it is conducted.  IEC/IRB approval of the protocol, informed consent and subject information and/or advertising, as relevant, will be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a study site.
Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/IRB approval prior to implementation 
of any changes made to the study design.  The investigator will be required to submit, maintain and archive study essential documents according to ICH GCP.
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
163
Any serious adverse events that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated by local 
regulations, will be reported to both responsible Ethics Committees and Regulatory Agencies, as required by local regulations.  During the conduct of the study, the investigator should promptly provide written reports (e.g., ICH Expedited Reports, and any additional reports required by local regulations) to the IEC/IRB of any changes that affect the conduct of the study and/or increase the risk to subjects.  Written documentation of the submission to the IEC/IRB should also be provided to AbbVie.
9.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH) guidelines, applicable regulations and guidelines governing clinical 
study conduct and the ethical principles th at have their origin in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.  Responsibilities of the clinical investigator are specified in Appendix A .
9.3 Subject Information and Consent
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the subject, and answer all questions regarding this study.  Prior to any study-related screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will be reviewed and signed and dated by the subject, the person who administered the informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements.  A copy of the informed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the subject's medical record.  An entry must also be made in the subject's dated source documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any study-related procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
Pharmacogenetic analysis and a portion of the pharmacodynamic analyses will only be 
performed if the subject has voluntarily signed and dated the informed consent, approved by an IRB/IEC, after the nature of the testing has been explained and the subject has had an opportunity to ask questions.  The informed consent must be signed before 
pharmacogenetic and/or pharmacodynamic testing is performed.  If the subject does not 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
164
consent to pharmacogenetic and/or the optional pharmacodynamic testing, it will not 
impact the subject's participation in the study.
10.0 Source Documents and Case Report Form 
Completion
10.1 Source Documents
Source documents are defined as original documents, data and records.  This may include hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory data/information, subjects' diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing and other records, recorded data from automated instruments, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, and/or x-rays.  Data collected during this study must be recorded on the appropriate source documents.
The investigator(s)/instituti on(s) will permit study-related monitoring, audits, IEC/IRB 
review, and regulatory inspection(s), providing direct access to source data documents.
10.2 Electronic Case Report Forms
Electronic case report forms (eCRF) must be completed for each subject enrolled in this 
study.  These forms will be used to tran smit information collected during the study to 
AbbVie and regulatory authorities, as applicable.  The eCRF data for this study are being collected with an electronic data capture (EDC) system called Rave
®provided by the 
technology vendor Medidata Solutions Inc orporated NY, USA (Medidata).  The EDC 
system and the study specific electronic case report forms will be in compliance with Title 21 CFR Part 11.  The documentation related to the validation of the EDC system is available through the vendor, Medidata, while the validation of the study-specific eCRFs will be conducted by AbbVie and will be maintained in the Trial Master File at AbbVie.
The investigator will document subject data in his/her own subject files.  These subject 
files will serve as source data for the study.  eCRF data required by this protocol will be recorded by investigative site personnel in the EDC system.  All data entered into the eCRF will be supported by source documentation.
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M13-982 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2012-004027-20
165
The investigator or an authorized member of the investigator's staff will make any 
necessary corrections to the eCRF.  All change information, including the date and person 
performing the corrections, will be available via an audit trail that is part of the EDC system.  For any correction, a reason for the alteration will be provided.  The eCRFs will 
be reviewed periodically for completeness, legibility and acceptability by AbbVie personnel (or their representatives).  AbbVie (or their representatives) will also be allowed access to all source documents pertinent to the st udy in order to verify eCRF entries.  The 
Principal Investigator will review the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy and provide his/her electronic signature and date to the eCRFs as evidence thereof.
Medidata will provide access to the EDC system for the duration of the trial through a 
password-protected method of internet access.  Such access will be removed from the investigative sites at the end of the site's pa rticipation in the study.  Data from the EDC 
system will be archived on appropriate data media (CD-ROM, etc.) and provided to the investigator at that time as a durable record of the site's eCRF data.  It will be possible for the investigator to make paper printouts from that media.
11.0 Data Quality Assurance
Prior to enrolling any subject in the study, a Si te Initiation Visit will be held with AbbVie 
personnel (and/or their representatives), the investigators, and the appropriate site personnel.  This meeting will in clude a detailed discussion and review of the protocol and 
essential documents, performance of study procedures, eCRF completion, and specimen 
collection methods.  The personnel at the study site will be trained on the study procedures, when applicable, by an AbbVie monitor or designee.
The AbbVie monitor or designee will monitor the study site throughout the study.  A 
source document review will be performed against entries on the eCRFs and a quality assurance check will be performed to ensure that the investigator is  complying with the 
protocol and regulations.  In addition, ongoing review of the data will be conducted by a physician or representative at AbbVie.

Appendix D. Recommendations for Initial Management of Electrolyte 
Abnormalities and Prevention of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)
Section 1:  First Dose of Venetoclax or Dose Escalation
!Within the first 24 hours after either the first dose or dose escalation, if any 
laboratory criteria below are met, the patient should be hospitalized for 
monitoring and the investigator notified.  No additional venetoclax doses 
should be administered until resolution.  A rapidly rising serum potassium is a 
medical emergency.
!Nephrology (or other acute dialysis service) should be contacted/consulted (per 
institutional standards to ensure emergency dialysis is available) on admission 
for any subject hospitalized prophylactica lly or in response to laboratory 
changes.
!IV fluids (e.g., D5 1/2 normal saline) should be initiated at a rate of at least 1 mL/kg/hr rounded to the nearest 10 mL (target 150 to 200 mL/hr; not 
< 50 mL/hr).  Modification of fluid rate should also be considered for 
individuals with specific medical needs.
!Monitor for symptoms or signs of TLS (e.g., fever, chills, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, hypotension, muscle aches, weakness, 
paresthesias, mental status changes, confusion and seizures).  If any clinical 
features are observed, recheck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and creatinine within 1 hour STAT.
!Vital signs should be taken at time of  all blood draws or any intervention.
!The management recommendations below focus on the minimum initial responses required.  If a diagnosis of TLS is established, ongoing intensive 
monitoring and multi-disciplinary management will be per institutional 
protocols.

In addition to the recommendations in the table below, for subjects receiving the first dose 
of venetoclax:
●For potassium increase ≥ 0.5 mmol/L from baseline, or any value 
> 5.0 mmol/L, recheck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and 
creatinine within 1 hour STAT and follow first guideline.
●For phosphorus increase of > 0.5 mg/dL AND > 4.5 mg/dL, administer phosphate binder and recheck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and creatinine within 1 hour STAT.
Abnormality Management Recommendations
Hyperkalemia (Including Rapidly Rising Potassium)
Potassium ≥ 0.5 mmol/L increase 
from prior value (even if potassium 
within normal limits [WNL])!Recheck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and creatinine in 1 hour STAT.  If further ≥ 0.2 mmol/L 
increase in potassium, but still < upper limit of normal (ULN), manage as per potassium ≥ ULN.  Otherwise 
recheck in 1 hour. 
!Resume per protocol testing if change in potassium is < 0.2 mmol/L, and potassium < ULN, and no other evidence of tumor lysis.
!At the discretion of the investigator, may recheck prior to hospitalization.  If stable or decreased, and still WNL, hospitalization is at the discretion of the investigator.  Potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and creatinine must be rechecked within 24 hours. 
Potassium > upper limit of normal !Perform STAT ECG and commence telemetry.
!Nephrology (or other acute dialysis service) notification 
with consideration of initiating dialysis.
!Administer Kayexalate 60 g (or Resonium A 60 g).
!Administer furosemide 20 mg IV × 1.
!Administer calcium gluconate 100 to 200 mg/kg IV 
slowly if there is ECG/telemetry evidence of 
life-threatening arrhythmias.
!Recheck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and creatinine in 1 hour STAT.
oIf potassium < ULN 1 hour later, repeat potassium, 
phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and creatinine 1, 2
and 4 hrs., if no other evidence of tumor lysis.

Option to Continue Venetoclax Treatment
Subjects may continue receiving study drug for up to 2 years following the date of the last 
subject enrolled provided they continue to tolerate the drug, have no evidence of disease progression, and do not meet any of the criteria  for subject discontinuation (Section 5.4.1).  
For subjects that continue to derive benefit after 2 years of treatment following the date of the last subject enrolled, AbbVie will work with the investigator to evaluate options for continuation of venetoclax.  In countries where venetoclax is not commercially available, the Study M13-982 will be extended to provide subjects with the opportunity to continue on venetoclax until alternative options become available.

b. All subjects must receive tumor lysis prophylaxis prior to and during treatment.  For details on tumor lysis prophylaxis and management, refer to Section 6.8.1, Prophylaxis 
and Management of Tumor Lysis Syndrome and Appendix D – Recommendations for Initial Management of Electrolyte Abnormalities and Prevention of Tumor Lysis 
Syndrome (TLS).
c. Assessments will be collected at 3 month intervals after the last study visit for a period of 5 years after the last subject has enrolled in the study.
d. Subjects must have 17p deletion as assessed by local or central laboratory to be considered for enrollment.  A result obtained prior to study Screening may be used for 
eligibility.  A confirmatory sample will be sent to central laboratory at Screening.  Refer to Section 5.3.1.5, Collection and Handling of Biomarker Variables, for more details.
e. A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening.  A symptom directed physical examination will be performed on Day 1 of Weeks 2 – 4 and the 30-day 
Safety Visit.  All other physical examinations will be targeted.  If during physical examination, signs or symptoms suggestive of Richter's Syndrome are observed, further 
assessments (e.g., lymph node biopsy, PET scan) should be considered to exclude or confirm the transformation.  Refer to Sectio n 5.3.1.1 Physical Examination, for more 
details.
f. For females of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test must be obtained and processed locally at the Week 1 Day 1, if it has been > 7 days since obtaining the serum 
pregnancy results at Screening.
g. Cholesterol and triglycerides are only required at Screening and Final Visit.
h. There is no 72 hour window for these samples.  Refer to Section 6.8.1, Prophylaxis and Management of Tumor Lysis Syndrome and Appendix D – Recommendations for 
Initial Management of Electrolyte Abnormalities and Prevention of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS).
i. Assessment of ejection fraction will be made at screening at the discretion of the investigator.  Subsequent evaluation of Le ft Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) will be 
made as clinically indicated for subjects who develop signs of cardiac compromise.
j. If a subject exhibits clinical signs of possible disease progression (i.e., increased or de novo enlargement of liver, spleen or lymph nodes on physical examination without an 
increase in lymphocytes meeting PD criteria), a CT scan and/or bone marrow biopsy must be performed within 2 weeks to confirm o r rule out PD as described in 
Section 5.3.3.2.
k. Imaging assessments are required for all subjects at Week 36 Day 1.  Assessment to be performed on Week 36 Day 1 only (not every 12 weeks).  The Week 36 scan may be 
performed within 4 weeks before or after the 36 week scheduled visit provided that it has been at least 8 weeks since the subje ct's last scan.
l. After a response is determined by clinical criteria, a CT scan will be performed no earlier than 8 weeks for confirmation of response.  For determination of CR/CRi, both the 
CT scan and bone marrow are required to be negative.  It is recommended that the CT scan is performed first, and if it does confi rm a CR/CRi, then a BM biopsy should be 
obtained as soon as possible.  
m. Post-treatment CT or MRI scans to be done only if collected by the site as part of standard of care. 
n. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy will be performed and assessed locally at Screening (within 35 days prior to the first dose  of study drug).  Bone marrow and aspirate for 
biomarker sample collection should be split from this sample.  Refer to Table 6.

o. For subjects who meet all criteria for CR/CRi with the exception of a node(s) that is enlarged around 1.5 – 2 cm may also have  a bone marrow performed.  If bone marrow 
was not performed at the time of the confirmatory CT, then it should be performed after the Week 36 Day 1 CT scan.
p. At baseline, all measurable disease must be documented at screening by laboratory testing, physical examination and CT scans ( or MRI if CT is medically contraindicated), 
and bone marrow examinations.
q. Specimens (bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood) for MRD analysis should be collected at the same time as the bone marro w aspirate and biopsy performed for tumor 
assessments to confirm the CR/CRi.  If MRD negativity is achieved in the bone marrow no further MRD analyses are required.  Oth erwise, MRD should be assessed at 
12-week intervals thereafter (in peripheral blood) until MRD negativity is achieved.  Once MRD negativity is achieved and confi rmed in peripheral blood (e.g., two MRD 
negative consecutive peripheral blood samples), a bone marrow aspirate specimen will again be collected for analysis of MRD lev els to confirm the peripheral blood 
negativity.  Subjects who meet all criteria for CR/CRi with the exception of a node(s) that is enlarged around 1.5 – 2 cm may al so have a bone marrow performed and MRD 
assessment.  If a bone marrow and MRD assessment was not performed at the time of the confirmatory CT scan, then they should be  performed after the Week 36 Day 1 CT 
scan.  If MRD negativity is achieved in the bone marrow no further MRD analyses are required.  Otherwise, MRD should be assesse d at 12-week intervals thereafter (in 
peripheral blood) until MRD negativity is achieved.  Once MRD negativity is achieved and confirmed in peripheral blood (e.g., tw o MRD negative consecutive peripheral 
blood samples), a bone marrow aspirate specimen will again be collected for analysis of MRD levels to confirm the peripheral bl ood negativity.
r. The Health Economic and Patient Reported Outcomes questionnaires should be administered and completed prior to any other stud y procedures being performed at these 
visits.  Refer to Section 5.3.8, Health Economic and Patient-Reported Outcome Measures, for further information.
s. For subjects in the United States only:  Subjects in the safety expansion cohort will be asked to complete a survey assessing the information they were provided for the Patient 
Information Card and the Tumor Lysis Syndrome Patient Information Brochure at Week 2 Day 1 or the next scheduled visit.  For su bjects participating in the main cohort, the 
survey will be given to the subject at the next scheduled study visit upon signing the Protocol Amendment 2 Informed Consent.  This survey is optional.

The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
No Reasonable PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not reported causality or deemed it not assessable, 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)

6.4 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAn adverse event where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
No Reasonable PossibilityAn adverse event where there is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not repor ted causality or deemed it not assessable, 
AbbVie will consider the event associated.

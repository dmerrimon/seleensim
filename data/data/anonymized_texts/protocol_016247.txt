Title:  
The impact of vaccination on severity of illness in COVID -19: A multicenter cohort study  
Background  and Rat ionale : 
With the FDA's emergency use authorization declaration  in December of 2020,  the Pfizer -
BioNtech  vaccine became the first of several vaccines to kick off the mass vaccination effort 
across the United States.1 Subsequently, Moderna as well as Johnson and Johnson both had 
their vaccines receive emergency use authorization.2 While the Pfizer and the Moderna 
vaccines both ut ilize novel mRNA technology, Johnson and Johnson's  vaccine uses a viral vector 
that has been used  previously in both the European approved Ebola vaccine and a trial vaccine 
for HIV. However, none of these vaccine types have previously been approved in the United 
States.3 While preliminary  data from safety and efficacy trials have shown positive results , 
actual -world  data on its effectiveness is still lacking. 4 Several small cohort studies and on e large 
trial from Isra el are currently our only insights into the actual rates of infection, hospitalization, 
and severe illness among vaccinated individuals.5–7  As COVID -19 variants , with the potential to 
reduce vaccine efficacy,  continue to emerge worldwide,  we are in desperate need of more data 
regarding the real-world  effectiveness of our current mass vaccination efforts.8 
Vaccination efforts in the State of Michigan have been ongoing sin ce December. Given that 
approximately 33.7% of the state’s population is either partially or fully vaccinated, it is unclear 
why the number of cases has risen so dramatically or if immunization efforts can help the 
situation.9 
Given the current situation i n the State of Michigan, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of COVID -
19 vaccination on rates of severe illness when breakthrough SARS -CoV-2 infection occurs in a 
region with high incidence of variant strain disease.  The research hypothesis is that fully 
vaccinated patients are at reduced risk for the most severe outcomes.  
Specific Aims:  
Aim 1:  To compare the rate of severe COVID -19 infection among unvaccinated, partially 
vaccinated, and fully vaccinated patients .  
For Aim 1, severe infection is defined as  composite ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and 
in-hospital mortality . 
Aim 2:  To compare rate of additional clinical outcomes of COVID -19 infection for hospitalized 
patients among unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated patients.  
For Aim 2, relevant clinical outcomes include: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ), 
new renal replacement therapy  (RRT) , high flow oxygen, low flow oxygen  (non -rebreather or 
nasal cannula) , noninvasive ventilation, and hospital length of stay.

Aim 3:  To compare proportions of ED presentations and hospitalizations among unvaccinated, 
partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated patients presenting to an emergency department.  
For Aim 3, the incidence of ED presentation of partially vaccinated and fully vaccinated 
populations will be adjusted for the proportion of the local community that is vaccinated based 
on State of Michigan data.  
Aim 4: To compare hospitalization rates among unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, and fully 
vaccinated patients presenting to an emergency department.  
For Aim 4, we will compa re the percentage of patients that are admitted from each cohort.  
Exploratory Aim 1 : To compare three vaccination types for Aim 1 and Aim 2.  
For Exploratory Aim 1, outcomes for Aims 1 and 2 will be assessed for fully vaccinated patients 
receiving Pfizer -BioNtech, Moderna, and Johnson and Johnson vaccinations .    
Exploratory Aim 2 : To compare predictors of hospitalization among unvaccinated, partially 
vaccinated, and fully vaccinated patients presenting to an emergency department.  
For Exploratory Aim 2 , demographic, epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory variables will be 
assessed to determine risk factors for hospital admission.   
Study Design and Eligibility:  
Study Design : 
We plan to perform a retrospective chart review of all patients who present ed to Beaumont 
health system emergency departments   between December  15, 2021 and April 30, 2021  and 
were diagnosed with COVID -19 ≤ 28 days of ED encounter  or prior to discharge.   All hospitalized 
patients will have a  designated follow -up date  of May 15, 2021 . For each individual we will 
collect  epidemiological, demographic, therapeutic, clinical, and outcomes data . 
Vaccination data from the state of Michigan will be extracted via the Michigan Care 
Improvement Registry (MC IR) and therefore capture patients who ha ve been vaccinated 
outside of the Beaumont Health system. This data include s vaccine type as well as date of 
administration.  
Demographic and epidemiological data includes: age, gender, race, and zip code  of residence  
Clinical data includes: existing medical  conditions  (Elixhauser comorbidity score ), vital signs 
(temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, pulse ox), home medications,  chief 
complaint from emergency provider note, duration of symptoms in days at the time of 
presentation from emergency provider note, chest x -ray or chest C T results, and laboratory 
values ( WBC, hg, ALT, Cr, lactated, dimer, procal citonin , CRP, LDH , troponin ). Vaccination status 
including vaccine brand (Pfizer, J&J, Moderna), vaccine administration date (s).

v. 5/12/21  
Therapeutic/Outcomes data includes: H ospital admission unit type (regular medical or surgical 
floor, progressive floor, intensive care unit), ICU length of stay, change in unit type during 
admission . Oxygen therapy (none, nasal canula,  non-rebreather, venturi mas k, trach collar,  non-
invasive ventilation, high flow nasal cannula, mechanical  ventilator), days on high flow, days on 
ventilator, specific inpatient medical therapies  (hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, remdesivir, 
lopinavir -ritonavir , bamlanivimab , tocilizumab, baricitinib, convalescent plasma, monoclonal 
antibodies, corticosteroids, vasopressors, anticoagulants ), ECMO, RRT, noninvasive ventilation , 
hospital length of stay, and disposition from hospital (home, rehabilitation unit, death).  
Study Def initions:  
Patients w ill be  categorized as either unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, or fully vaccinated. 
Unvaccinated individuals are defined as having positive laboratory  COVID -19 testing  with no 
record of immunization against COVID -19 or first -dose vacc ination after symptom onset . 
Partially vaccinated individuals are defined as having positive laboratory  COVID -19 testing  and 
symptom onset after a single do se of either mRNA (Pfizer, Moderna) vaccine , or < 14 days after 
the second dose of either mRNA vaccine (Pfizer, Moderna) or < 14 days after the administration 
of the single dose of viral vector vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) . Fully immunized individuals are 
defined as having  positive laboratory testing for C OVID -19 and symptom onset ≥ 14 days since 
administered of second dose of either mRNA vaccine, or ≥ 14 days since administration of viral 
vector vaccine (Johnson & Johnson).  (Appendix A – Figure represents categorization of study 
subjects)  
Confirmed COVID 19 infection is defined as laboratory confirmed positive result identified by 
rapid antigen testing or reverse -transcriptase -polymerase -chain -reaction (RT -PCR) by 
nasopharyngeal swab.  Patients are considered l ab positive if they had either PCR or ant igen 
testing available in our database. Patients  are also considered confirmed COVID 19  if they had 
clear reference in the medical chart to positive lab testing performed at an outpatient lab ≤ 28 
days of ED encounter.    
Eligibility:  
Inclusion Criteria  
All patients presenting to Beaumont health site’s emergency departments  between December 
15, 2020 and April 30th, 2021  who  meet our definition of  confirmed COVID -19 infection.  
Exclusion Criteria  
Patients are excluded if : 
--Test positive for COVID -19 >28 days prior to ED encounter.   
--Identified as COVID -19 by diagnosis or ICD code but ha ve no available lab data and no 
reference to a positive lab test in the  clinical notes.

v. 5/12/21  
--There is irregular vaccination data such as duplic ate entries or multiple vaccine brands within 
the MC IR registry .  
--Categorized to either vaccine group but no date of symptom onset is evident from the clinical 
record.  
Study Methods : 
We will review the electronic medical record to identify the study population of interest. See 
Appendix A for full Inclusion/Exclusion diagram. The query plan includes first identifying all ED 
encounters to a Beaumont Health ED  between 12/15/20 to 4/30/21 . From this group, patients 
with confirmed COVID -19 based on positive PCR or antigen lab value  ≤ 28 days from ED 
encounter date or prior to discharge will be included . A subset of patients with active COVID -19 
infection will not have lab results available  through the Beaumont medical chart. Many patients 
have outpatient or urgent care lab testing and only present to the ED when symptoms have 
worsened. To identify these cases, we will use  ICD10 code [ U07. 1 ] for  COVID -19 as well as 
other various diagnostic  codes indicating COVID infection. See Appendix B for full list of COVID -
19 codes. After identification of these patients, v ia manual chart review, cases that reference a 
firm outpatient lab diagnosis ≤ 28 days fr om initial ED encounter will also be included.  
For vaccinated patients, categorization into the correct group is critical. The three groups 
include: unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated. V accination data w ill be 
extracted from the MCIR registry for all patients . The preliminary partially vaccinated group 
includes patients who  received a single dose of mRNA vaccine prior to positive lab test or ED 
encounter. The preliminary fully vaccinated group includes patients who received ei ther two 
doses of an mRNA vaccine or a single dose of the viral vector vaccine  prior to positive lab test or 
ED encounter . These groups will be further refined by manual chart review to determine onset 
of COVID symptoms. Symptom onset date  will then be recorded and compared to date of 
vaccination to further define these cohorts. Patients in the fully vaccinated group who had <14 
days since symptom  onset from 2nd vaccine dose  will be recategorized into the partially 
vaccinated cohort. Patients in the  partially vaccinated group who had symptom onset prior to 
vaccine administration w ill be recategorized  into the unvaccinated group.

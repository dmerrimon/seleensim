and date, as applicable.  To reflect the current version.  
Section 1.1, Protocol Synopsis , 
Section 5.1, Inclusion Criteria, 
Section  5.2, Exclusion Criteria , and 
Table 2  Updated to clarify that culture -
confirmed protocol -defined ILI 
cases caused by any influenza A 
or B strains will be included in 
the endpoint regardless of 
antigenic match to strains 
selected for the seasonal 
vaccine.  
Added evaluation of humoral 
immunogenicity to secondary 
objectives.  To remove redundant 
language of protocol -defined 
ILI cases caused by 
antigenically matched strains  
in the vaccines  that are 
already summarized in  other 
objectives /endpoints . 
To allow for earlier timing of 
sample testing , as it was 
initially part of an exploratory 
analysis that was planned for  
a later time . 
Section 1.2, Schedule of Events, 
Section 4.1, Study Design, and 
Section 8.9.2, Assessments for 
Respiratory Viral Infections  Clarified that participants who 
experience protocol -defined ILI 
must have an NP swab collected 
for RT-PCR testing of influenza 
virus and other respiratory 
pathogens. In participants who Clarification based on study 
site feedback  per IRB -
notified/approved

experience ILI symptoms but 
have not yet fulfilled protocol -
defined ILI, Investigators may 
use their discretion to perform 
NP swab s when influenza is 
suspected.  
Section 6.5.2, Concomitant 
Medications and  Vaccines that 
May Lead to the Elimination of a 
Participant from Per -Protocol 
Analyses, and Section 9.4, 
Analysis Populations  Further information is added to 
clarify concomitant medications 
and/or vaccines that may lead to 
a participant being excluded 
from  the PP Set and analyses : 
− An authorized or 
licensed noninfluenza 
vaccine that is not 
adjuvanted administered 
within 14 days before or 
after the study 
intervention.  
− An authorized or 
licensed adjuvanted, 
noninfluenza vaccine 
administered within 28 
days after  the study 
intervention.  
− Any nonstudy influenza 
vaccine administered 
during the study period.  To describe details on usage 
of noninfluenza and influenza 
vaccines during the study that 
may result in exclusion from 
the PP Set.  
Section 8.10.2, Serious Advers e 
Events  Revised definition of serious 
adverse events as follows: 
Persistent or significant 
disability or incapacity  or 
substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life 
functions.  To address health authority 
feedback.  
Section 8.15 Biomarkers  Replaced the term, “additional” 
in front of the word 
“biomarkers” at the start of the 
paragraph.  
Deleted the word “exploratory” 
and replaced it with the words 
“future research.”  Clarifications.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
Protocol mRNA -1010 -P302 Amendment 1  mRNA -1010  
Confidential  Page 6 Section  # and Name  Description of Change  Brief Rationale  
Added the words “from 
consented participants” at the 
end of the first paragra ph. 
Shifted statement about 
“optional blood collections…” 
from the 1st paragraph to the 2nd 
paragraph and modified a 
portion of the statement starting 
with the following text, “…to 
research connections between 
vaccine responses and safet.”  
Added a statemen t at the end of 
the 2nd paragraph about NP 
swab collections.  
Section 9.2 Statistical Hypotheses  Changed “2 -sided” to “1 -sided” 
and “5%” to “2.5%”.  
Changed the spending function 
from “O’Brien -Fleming” to 
“Pocock.”  For noninferiority, the 1 -sided 
P value  is more applicable.  
The Pocock spending 
function provides a greater 
chance to achieve success at 
IA. 
Sections 9.2, Statistical 
Hypotheses, 9.3, Sample Size, 9.5, 
Statistical  Analyses,  9.5.1.1, 
Analysis of Primary Efficacy 
Endpoint, 9.6, Planned Analyses , 
and Table 8  The first IA was removed 
because of  the expected lower 
power.  
The alpha spending function 
was changed to the Lan -DeMets 
Pocock approximation function 
to preserve the overall Type I 
error rate.  
Statistical considerations were 
updated  because of  the revised 
IA schedule and change in the 
alpha -spending function.  
The above success boundaries 
for hypothesis testing are 
changed to be in terms of 1 -
sided P values .  Per prediction, the timing of 
two IAs will be close. Hence, 
the Spons or decided to 
combine them into one IA.  
The Pocock spending 
function provides a greater 
chance to achieve success at 
IA. 
For noninferiority, the 1 -sided 
P value  is more applicable.  
Section  9.3, Sample Size  Allow the timing of IA based on 
a specified data  cut-off date 
regardless of number of 
influenza cases accrued.  
Updated the power of the PP Set 
to 93%.  To accommodate DSMB 
review even if the target 
number of cases for IA is not 
reached considering the 
declining influenza incidence.  
ModernaTX, Inc.

Replaced “2 IAs” with “one IA” 
and deleted associated text 
about the percentages of the 
target total number of cases.  
Changed “2 -sided” to “1 -sided” 
and “5%” to “2.5%”.  
Changed the spending function 
from “O’Brien -Fleming” to 
“Pocock.”

revised . Randomized  
participants  who discontinued 
from the study prior to 14  days 
after administration of study 
vaccines will be excluded . 
The PP Set definition was 
revised  based on edits to the 
mITT Set.  
An Immunogenicity Subset and 
a PP Immunogenicity Subset 
was added.  The revised definition will 
include more participants  in 
the mITT Set . In addition, the 
influenza symptom reporting 
from 14  days post -
vaccination is not required.  
The additional subsets clarify 
which participants will be  
included in the 
immunogenicity analyses.  
Section 9.5.1.1, Analysis of 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  Added summary description of 
how missing data will be 
handled.  
Clarified that the randomization

Protocol Title:  A Phase 3, Randomized, Observer -blind, Active -controlled  Study to Evaluate 
the Safety and Efficacy of mRNA -1010 Candidate Seasonal Influenza Vaccine in Adults 
50 Years and Older  
Brief Title:  A Phase 3 Study t o Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of mRNA -1010 Candidate 
Seasonal Influenza Vaccine in Adults 50 Years and Older  
Regulatory Agency Identifier Number  (s): IND: 27460, EudraCT:  2022 -001638 -12 
Rationale: Seasonal influenza viruses are estimated by the World Health Organi zation 
(WHO) to cause 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and up to 650,000 deaths each year 
resulting in a severe challenge to public health (WHO  2018 ). Influenza epidemics occur each 
year and follow a seasonal circulation pa ttern with increased cases during the winter months in 
the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) ( Riedel et al 2019 ). Based on 
the observed circulation patterns and antigenic changes, an expert panel recommends  
influenza virus strains to be used for vaccine manufacturing twice a year (once for the NH and 
once for the SH).  Influenza A and influenza B viruses are the most relevant influenza viruses 
for human infection. Therefore, current vaccine recommendations in clude 1 influenza A H1N1 
strain, 1 influenza A H3N2 strain, and 2  influenza B strains (covering the B/Victoria and 
B/Yamagata lineages).  
Currently licensed seasonal influenza virus vaccines rarely exceed 60% overall effectiveness 
and are poorly effective d uring years when the circulating viruses do not match the strains 
selected for the vaccine antigens ( CDC 2020a ). Influenza vaccines based on messenger RNA 
(mRNA) -technology could provide several benefits compared to current vacc ines, including 
the ability to respond to strain changes more quickly, avoidance of mutations that may be 
acquired during vaccine production in eggs or cell culture, stronger immune responses as well 
as improved protection in older adults ( Rockman et al 2020 ).

Overall Study Design : 
This study will be a Phase 3, randomized, observer -blinded, active -controlled trial to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of mRNA -1010 in adults  50 years and older.  
Approximately  23,000 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of 
mRNA -1010 at  µg total mRNA or a single dose of the active comparator.  
Brief summary:  
The purpose of this study is to measure relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) of mRNA -1010 as 
compared to an active comparator to prevent the occurrence of the first episode of reverse 
transcriptase -polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) confirmed protocol -defined influ enza-like 
illness (ILI) caused by any influen za A or B virus strains.

Note: In accordance with FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during the COVID -19 Public Health Emergency ( FDA 2020 ), 
investigators may convert clinic visits to telemedicine visits with the approval of the Sponso r. 
1. Day 29 clinic visit is only required for participants in the immune  response  biomarker  subset.  
2. The Screening visit and Day 1 may be performed on the same day or a different day. Additionally, the Screening visit may be p erformed over multiple 
visits if within the 28 -day screening window.  
3. Verbal medical history is acceptable.  
4. A full physical examination, including height and weight, will be performed at the Screening visit; symptom -directed physical examinations may be 
performed at other clinic visits. In terim physical examinations will be performed at the discretion of the Investigator . Any clinically significant finding 
identified by a healthcare professional during clinic visits should be reported as an MAAE.  
5. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures, hear t rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature. The preferred route of temperature assessment is oral. On the day 
of vaccination, vital signs will be collected once before vaccination and once 30 minutes after vaccination. Vital signs may be collected at o ther clinic 
visits in conjunction with a symptom -directed physical examination.  
6. A point -of-care urine pregnancy test will be performed at the Screening visit and before the vaccine dose on Day 1, if Day 1 is not on t he same day as the 
Screening visit. At t he discretion of the Investigator , a pregnancy test either via blood or point -of-care urine can be performed at any time. The 
participant’s follicle -stimulating hormone level may be measured at the Screening visit, as necessary, and at the discretion of th e Investigator , to confirm 
postmenopausal status.  
7. In a subset of participants, samples will be collected for immunogenicity assessment and immune assessment s. Of the people who participate in the subset, 
an additional blood sample collection for transcript omics  will be optional . Samples on Day 1 must be collected prior to receipt of vaccination.  
8. Sample collection for future research , including genomics , is optional. Samples on Day 1 must be collected prior to receipt of vaccination.

10. Assessment of EFS will only be performed for participants aged 65 years and older .  
11. The NP swab specimen(s) for pathogens, including influenza virus and other respiratory pathogens (eg, SARS -CoV -2) will be collected any time from 
Day 1 to Day 361 (Month  12)/EoS if participants have protocol -defined ILI per the ILI Case Definitions in Section  8.10.5 . or if deemed necessary per 
Investigator ’s discretion when influenza is suspected . If participants experience ILI symptoms, they will be instructed to contact the clinic to determine if 
they need  an NP swab collected for testing . NP swab collection should occur  within 72 hours  of symptom onset . NP swabs should be collected prior to any 
antiviral therapy, if possible. NP swabs may be collected as part of a home visit in lieu of a clinic visit. In the event that NP swabs during ILI cannot be 
collected, any available influenza testing results performed outside of the study should be capture d in the eCRF.  
12. Only for those participants not in the immune response biomarker subset who otherwise would have a clinic visit this day.  
13. The eDiary entries will be recorded at approximately 30 minutes after injection while at the clinic with instruction pr ovided by the clinic staff. Study 
participants will continue to record in the eDiary for solicited ARs each day after they leave the clinic, preferably in the evening and at the same time each 
day, on the day of injection and the subsequent 6 days followin g injection. See Section 8.9.4  for additional details.  
14. The site staff  will review Symptom Reporting eDiar ies daily and if illness symptoms are noted they should follow up with participants to determine if the 
symptoms warrant the participant providing an NP swab.  Follow -up with the participant for symptoms review should be documented in eCRF . 
15. The Symptom Reporting eDiary will be activated for collectio n of ILI symptoms starting at Day 1 and lasting until Day 361 (Month 12)/EoS.  
16. Participants will be instructed to report via Symptom Reporting eDiary or telephone calls whether ILI symptoms have been expe rienced. If participants 
experience ILI symptoms, the y will be instructed to contact the clinic  as soon as possible to determine if an  NP swab needs to be collected . NP swabs  for 
testing should be collected within 72 hours  of symptom onset . NP swabs should be collected prior to any antiviral therapy, if poss ible. NP swabs may be 
collected as part of a home visit in lieu of a clinic visit.  
17. Telephone/electronic contacts are to remind participants of ILI eDiary reporting, not to capture AEs . 
18. For participants reporting symptoms of ILI  in the Symptom Reporting eDiary , the EQ -5D-5L responses will be collected using the eDiary on the day of the 
symptoms reporting (+1 day) and 5 days (+1 day) later.  
19. For participants reporting symptoms of ILI  in the Symptom Reporting eDiary , the WPAI over t he previous 7 days will be collected using the eDiary at 5 
days (+1 day) following the start of ILI symptoms reporting  in the Symptom Reporting eDiary . 
20. Trained study personnel or designee will call all participants to collect information relating to any MA AEs, AEs leading to study discontinuation, SAEs, 
AESIs, and information on concomitant medications associated with those events. All concomitant medications relevant to or for the treat ment of an SAE, 
AESI, or MAAE will be recorded from Day 1 through Day 3 61 (Month 12)/EoS.  
21. All concomitant medications and non -study vaccinations will be recorded through 28 days after study intervention (including receipt of any authorized or 
investigational COVID -19 vaccine).  Additionally,  certain concomitant medications wil l be recorded through Day 361/EoS (refer to Section  6.5.1).

2.1. Study Rationale  
Seasonal influenza viruses are estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) to cause 3 to 
5 million cases of severe illness and up to 650,000 deaths each year resulting in a severe 
challenge to public health ( WHO  2018 ). Influenza epidemics occur each year and follow a 
seasonal circulation pattern with incre ased cases during the winter months in the Northern 
Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) ( Riedel et al 2019 ). Since influenza viruses 
continuously change through a process termed antigenic drift, the circulating viruse s are actively 
monitored by a worldwide network coordinated by the WHO ( Monto 2018 ). Based on the 
observed circulation patterns and antigenic changes, an expert panel recommends influenza virus 
strains to be used for vaccine ma nufacturing twice a year (once for the NH and once for the SH). 
Influenza A and influenza B viruses are the most relevant influenza viruses for human infection. 
Therefore, current vaccine recommendations include 1 influenza A H1N1 strain, 1 influenza A 
H3N 2 strain, and 2  influenza B strains (covering the B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages).  
Currently licensed seasonal influenza virus vaccines rarely exceed 60% overall effectiveness and 
are poorly effective during years when the circulating viruses do not ma tch the strains selected 
for the vaccine antigens ( CDC 2020 a). Influenza vaccines based on messenger RNA 
(mRNA) -technology could provide several benefits compared to current vaccines, including the 
ability to respond to strain changes more quickly, avoidance of mutations that may be acquired 
during vaccine production in eggs or cell culture, stronger immune responses as well as 
improved protection in older adults ( Rockman et al 2020 ). 
2.2. Background and Overview  
The Sponsor has developed a proprietary vaccine platform based on a n mRNA delivery system. 
The platform is based on the principle and observations that cells in vivo can take up mRNA, 
translate it, and then express protein viral an tigen(s) on the cell surface. The delivered mRNA 
does not enter the cellular nucleus or interact with the genome, is nonreplicating, and is 
expressed transiently.  
The Sponsor is using its mRNA -based platform to develop a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) 
encapsulat ed mRNA -based seasonal vaccine against disease caused by influenza virus types A 
and B. The proposed development candidate, mRNA -1010, will be a quadrivalent vaccine 
containing mRNAs encoding for the hemagglutinins (HAs) of the 4 strains recommended by 
WHO  for cell - or recombinant -based vaccines. Equal amounts of mRNAs will be used for 
encoding the HA components for each of the 4 different strains. The mRNA -1010 development 
candidate is administered as a single dose and aims to elicit protection from all se asonal 
influenza viruses covered by the vaccine.  
The Sponsor has enrolled 880 participants in a Phase 1/2 trial with mRNA -1010  in the US and 
plans to enroll 6000 participants in a Phase 3 immunogenicity trial in the SH in Q2/Q3 2022. The 
Sponsor is conduct ing this Phase 3 trial with mRNA -1010 to establish safety and efficacy data to 
support the licensure for this vaccine.  
Details on the mechanism of action and a summary of nonclinical studies of mRNA -1010  can be 
found in Section  2.2.1 .

all applicable regulatory requirements.  
2.2.1.  Nonclinical Stud ies 
Using individually formulated HA e ncoding mRNAs (preclinical material), 2  mouse 
immunogenicity studies were performed. The HA sequences used for preclinical formulation 
were from wild type HAs.  
Both studies used a prime/boost regimen with a 3 -week interval. Immunized mice were bled on 
Day 21 (3 weeks after the prime dose) and Day 36 (2 weeks after the boost dose), and 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titers were determined with an enzyme -linked immunosorbent 
assay using recombinant HA proteins.  
The first study compared mice immunized with in dividual mRNAs or a combination of all 4 HA 
mRNAs at 2 different doses (2 µg or 0.4 µg of each mRNA), based on the following strains 
recommended for the 2020 to 2021 NH influenza season:

• B/Washington/02 /2019 (B/Victoria lineage)  
• B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)  
High IgG antibody titers were observed against all HAs following immunization with both 
individual mRNA constructs and mRNA combinations after a single dose. A dose response and 
booster eff ect were observed for most mRNA constructs (individual and combinations).  
The second mouse immunogenicity study aimed to confirm that the 2021 SH composition is 
similarly immunogenic with the 2020 to 2021 NH composition. The compositions differed only 
for the H1N1 strain; the SH composition included A/Wisconsin/588/2019(H1N1)pdm09 instead 
of the A/Hawaii/70/2019(H1N1)pdm09 strain.  
No difference in immunogenicity (HA IgG antibody titers) based on the strain/mRNA construct 
used for immunization (A/Hawaii/70/2 019 in the NH composition versus A/Wisconsin/588/2019 
in the SH composition) was observed, suggesting that the mRNA platform will support annual 
strain updates.  
Additional studies to assess protection of mice from challenge with mouse adapted H1N1 and 
H3N2  viruses after a single immunization and a study to assess immunogenicity and protection 
from H1N1 challenge after 2 immunizations in ferrets have been completed. Using non -good 
manufacturing practices ( GMP ) co-formulated material, mice and ferrets were im munized with 
mRNA -1010 of the SH 2021 composition (mRNA -1010 -SH21) followed by a viral challenge. 
Control animals were immunized with phosphate buffered saline or a commercially available 
MF59 -adjuvanted influenza vaccine (FLUAD®, 2020/21 NH composition).  
Ferrets were administered the vaccine via intramuscular ( IM) injection on a prime/boost schedule 
with a 3 -week interval ; antibody responses were measured at Day 21 and Day 42 followed by 
H1N1 challenge on Day 42. Mice received a single dose of vaccine via IM injection, antibody 
responses were measured at Day 21, and the animals were challenged that day with either an 
H1N1 or H3N2 virus.

Protocol mRNA -1010 -P302 Amendment 1  mRNA -1010  
Confidential  Page 26 In both animal models, serological analyses demonstrated that hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI) 
antibody titers were detec table against the 4 viral strains after the first immunization with 
mRNA -1010 and in the case of ferrets, titers were further boosted by the second immunization. 
In addition, the HAI antibody titers induced by mRNA -1010 were as robust as the titers induced  
by the adjuvanted influenza vaccine (FLUAD).  
Upon live virus challenge, ferrets that were vaccinated with mRNA -1010 had lower detectable 
viral loads compared to the placebo group across different tissues. Compared to FLUAD, 
mRNA -1010 performed equally wel l and reduced viral loads to lower levels in the nose, throat, 
and nasal turbinates. No virus was detected in the lung , 4 days after challenge.  
Upon H3N2 live virus challenge, mice that were vaccinated with mRNA -1010 lost less weight 
and showed fewer clini cal symptoms as compared to animals that received FLUAD or animals in 
the control group. Upon (H1N1)pdm09 -like virus challenge, animals that received mRNA -1010 
or FLUAD were fully protected against morbidity and showed no scorable clinical symptoms.  
In con clusion, vaccination with mRNA -1010 induces strong antibody responses in mice and 
ferrets and confers protective efficacy against live virus challenge.  
A detailed review of the nonclinical observation with mRNA -1010 vaccine is provided in the 
Investigator’ s Brochure (IB).  
2.2.2.  Clinical Stud ies 
The Sponsor’s Phase 1/2 mRNA -1010 -P101 trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) is currently ongoing to 
provide initial first -in-human safety and immunogenicity data on 3 dose levels of mRNA -1010 
encoding strains  ( µg,  µg, or  µg total mRNA) recommended by the WHO for the 
2021 SH. An amendment to mRNA -1010 -P101 includes a Phase 2 NH portion to the study to 
increase the size of the safety database for the  µg and  µg dose levels and to test an 
additio nal  µg dose level of mRNA -1010 as well as a licensed seasonal influenza vaccine as an 
active comparator. A Phase 2 extension portion to this trial is ongoing to study additional dose 
levels of mRNA -1010  µg and  µg) as well as  µg of mRNA -1010 and an active 
comparator.  
No significant safety concerns have been observed in the ongoing Phase 1/2 mRNA -1010 -P101 
study upon review of safety data up to Day 29 by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). In 
the trial , 45 participants in each group received  µg,  µg, or  µg doses of mRNA -1010. 
The -µg dose of mRNA -1010 showed a preferable reactogenicity profile. The local and 
systemic adverse reactions (ARs) were mostly mild to moderate in severity. There were no 
Grade  4 ARs or seriou s adverse events (SAEs) assessed by the Investigator  as related to the 
study intervention . There was a death due to stage 4 kidney cancer that was unrelated to the 
study intervention  and occurred after the Day 29 visit. Vaccination with mRNA -1010 elicited 
HAI antibodies in both younger and older adults against all strains at all dose levels. HAI titers 
elicited at the  µg dose level were comparable with the titers elicited at higher dose levels.  
The interim analysis (IA) from the Phase 2 NH part of mRNA -1010-P101 included data through 
Day 29 from 498 adults who received the study intervention . The number of participants in the 
4 groups were 151 (  µg mRNA -1010), 147 (  µg mRNA -1010), 147 , (  µg mRNA -1010) , 
and 53  (Afluria®). No significant safety conce rns were identified. The frequency and severity of 
the reports of solicited ARs in the mRNA -1010 groups increased in a dose -dependent manner

were higher in t he mRNA -1010 groups than in the Afluria group. Local and systemic solicited 
ARs were mostly mild to moderate in severity without any Grade 4 ARs, adverse events of 
special interest ( AESIs ), or SAE s assessed to be related to the study intervention . There we re no 
study discontinuations due to AEs, and no AEs that led to a study pause. There was 1 death  due 
to cardiac arrest in a 67-year-old male  participant with a relevant medical history of diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension, and obesity . The event occurred 15 days post study vaccination and  was 
assessed by the Investigator  to be unrelated to the study intervention . mRNA -1010 elicited high 
levels of HAI antibodies on Day 29 across all dose levels, substantially exceeding the 1:40 
threshold associated with a 50% reduction in risk of infection. Antibody responses induced by 
mRNA -1010 against the influenza A strains H1N1 and H3N2 were higher compared to Afluria 
and similar for the influenza B strains.  
A description of the immunogenicity  and safety of mRNA -1010  is provided in the IB. 
2.3. Benefit /Risk  Assessment  
2.3.1.  Known Potential Benefits  
The mRNA -1010 vaccine may be effective against seasonal influenza strains as defined by the 
WHO. Considering the safety and immunogenicity data for mRNA -1010 to date, the Sponsor 
considers the potential benefits of participation to exceed the risks.  
Participants will obtain medical advice about their general health status through the medical 
evaluations/assessments associated with this study (ie, physical examination, vital signs 
measurement , and nasopharyngeal [NP] swabs testing).  
Participants will be contributing to the process of developing a new potentially prophylactic 
measure in an area of unmet medical need.  
2.3.2.  Risk s from Study Participation and Their  Mitigation  
As with all injectable vaccines, immediate systemic allergic reactions to vaccination, ranging 
from mild allergic reactions (eg, urticaria) to systemic allergic reactions (eg, anaphylaxis) can 
occur. These reactions are very rare and are estimated to occur once per 450,000 vacci nations for 
vaccines that do not contain allergens such as gelatin or egg protein ( Zent et al 2002 ). 
Since the authorization of the mRNA -1273 vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19), 
the US Centers for Disease Control an d Prevention ( CDC ) estimate of the rate of anaphylaxis 
based on reporting in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System is approximately 2.5 
cases/million doses administered ( Shimabukuro  et al 2021 ). As a precautionary me asure, all 
participants in this study will remain under observation at the clinic for at least 30 minutes after 
vaccination.  
Vasovagal syncope (fainting) can occur before or after any vaccination  and is usually triggered 
by the pain or anxiety caused by th e injection  and is not related to the substance injected. 
Therefore, it is important that standard precautions and procedures be followed to avoid injury 
from fainting.

Confidential  Page 28 lipid formulation have commonly resulted in transient and self -limiting local inflammatory 
reactions. These typically included pain, erythema (redness), or swelli ng (hardness) at the 
injection site, which were mostly mild to moderate in severity and usually occurred within 24 
hours of injection.  
Laboratory abnormalities (including increases in liver function tests and serum lipase levels) 
following injection have b een observed in early phase clinical studies with similar mRNA -based 
vaccines. These abnormalities were without clinical symptoms or signs and returned toward 
baseline (Day 1) values over time. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown.  
IA safety results from the Phase 1/2 portion of mRNA -1010 -P101 (data extraction date 
07 Oct 2021) demonstrated sporadic abnormalities for chemistry and hematology tests in all 
groups at 7 days post vaccination, but no trends or safety concerns were identifie d. There were 
no Grade 4 laboratory test abnormalities recorded in the study up to Day 29.  
The most commonly reported  local solicited ARs after interim safety analysis in the mRNA -
1010 -P101 trial were pain at injection site , axillary swelling , or tendernes s. Injection site 
erythema or swelling was less frequently reported . The most common solicited systemic 
reactions were headache, fatigue, myalgia, and chills.  Fever , nausea  and arthralgia  were reported 
less frequently.  
There have been very rare reports of myocarditis and pericarditis occurring after vaccination 
with COVID -19 mRNA vaccines. The majority of the cases have been reported in young males 
shortly after the second dose of the vaccine. These are typically mild cases and individuals tend 
to recover w ithin a short time following standard treatment and rest. Investigators  and study 
participants should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis (Gargano 
et al, 2021 ). 
Enhanced influenza vaccines (eg, adjuvanted, high dose, or recombinant vaccines) are 
preferentially recommended and available to the elderly (~65 years of age and older) in some 
countries. These vaccines are more efficacious in preventing influenza illness compared to 
standard dose vaccin es (eg, the comparator Fluarix®). Moreover, the efficacy of mRNA -1010 is 
unknown and will be evaluated in this study. Therefore, elderly participants should be made 
aware of any available alternative option to receive an enhanced influenza vaccine during t he 
consenting process. Nonstudy influenza vaccines are not permitted in the study.  
2.3.3.  Overall Benefit/Risk Conclusion  
Considering the safety and immunogenicity data for mRNA -1010 to date, the Sponsor considers 
the potential benefits of participation to exceed  the risks.

4.1. General Design  
This study will be a Phase 3, randomized, observer -blinded, active -controlled  trial to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy in preventing seasonal influenza of mRNA -1010 in adults 50  years and older . 
The vaccine to be tested includes mRNAs encoding for the surface glycoproteins of the strains 
recommended by the WHO for 2022 -2023 NH cell - or recombinant -based vaccines:  
• A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1)pdm09 -like virus;  
• A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2) -like virus;  
• B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage) -like virus; and  
• B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage) -like virus.  
Immunizations are planned during the typical 2022/2023 NH vaccination campaign period. 
However, if the targeted number of reverse transcriptase -polymerase chain reacti on (RT-PCR )-
confirmed ILI cases observed are not reached, an extension of enrollment over multiple influenza 
seasons may be required . As a result, vaccines with other seasonal -specific compositions may be 
used and administered during the relevant typical v accination campaigns, as appropriate. 
Additionally, if the interim vaccine effectiveness analyses by public health authorities 
demonstrate noneffectiveness of licensed influenza vaccines, sample size re -estimation and 
continuation of enrollment into the ne xt season may be considered.  
Approximately  23,000 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of 
mRNA -1010  at  µg total mRNA or a single dose of the active comparator. Randomization will 
be stratified by age categories (≥  50 to <  65 years or ≥  65 years) and influenza vaccine status in 
the previous influenza season  (received or not received) at the time of sc reening. At least 50% of 
enrollees will be ≥  65 years old, including at least 10% who will be ≥  75 years old.

visit, or maybe on the same day as the Vaccination Visit on Day 1) and a Vaccination Visit 
(Day  1) as showed in the schedule of events (SoE, Table  1). 
For participants aged 65 years and older, frailty will be assessed by clinic staff at baseline using 
the Edmonton Frail Scale (EFS).  
Approximately 1000 participants will be asked to provide blood samples at baseline and on 
Day 29 (28  days post vaccination) for assessment of immune responses to the study intervention

participants. All participants will be asked to complete an electronic diary (eDiary) for solicited 
ARs from Day 1 to Day 7. All participants will be asked to provide an optional blood sample for 
future research use at Day 1.  
There will be  6 safety telephone call visits at Days 8 , 29 (expect for those participants who are 
not in the immune response biomarker subset  which requires a clinic visit on Day 29 ), 91, 181, 
271, and 361 (Month 12)/EoS as specified in the SoE. The study duration (including screening) 
is up to 13  months for each participant and the total study duration is approximately 27 months  
(if 2 influenza season s are required  to perform efficacy analyses ). 
Participants will be instructed to report whether ILI symptoms have be en experienced, via a 
Symptom Reporting eDiary, twice weekly from Day  1 to Day  181 and once weekly from 
Day 182 to Day 361 (Month  12)/EoS.  If participants experience ILI symptoms, they will be 
instructed to  enter the details in the eDiary and contact the c linic to determine if  an NP swab 
should be  collected for  RT-PCR  testing . NP swabs for testing should be collected within 72 
hours of symptom onset.  Sites should  also reach out to participants  if illness symptoms are noted 
upon review of the eDiary to assess whether the participant  is required to provide an NP swab . 
NP swab should be collected prior to any antiviral therapy if possible. NP swabs may be 
collected as part of a home visit in lieu of a clinic visit. In the event that NP swabs during ILI 
cannot be collected, any available influenza testing results performed outside of the study should 
be captured in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). 
Unscheduled clinic visits for ILI symptoms and viral respiratory panel testing  may be conducted.  
Participants who manifest protocol -defined ILI or for those participants who experience ILI 
symptoms but have not yet fulfilled protocol -defined I LI, and based on Investigator’s  discretion 
when influenza is suspecte d, will be evaluated by real -time RT -PCR testing of NP swab 
specimen(s) for influenza and other respiratory pathogens . NP swabs may be collected as part of 
a home visit in lieu of a clini c visit.  
All participants who report symptoms of ILI will receive eDiary prompts to complete patient -
reported outcome questionnaires for EuroQoL 5 Dimension 5 -Level ( EQ-5D-5L) and Work 
Productivity and Activity impairment Questionnaire : Influenza -like Illn ess (WPAI:ILI ). 
The Investigator  might ask a participant to return to the clinical site for an unscheduled visit 
under certain situations (eg, if an AE is reported ). Additional assessments, as necessary,  may be 
conducted at these visits to ensure the safety and well -being of participants during the study. 
Electronic case report forms should be completed for each unscheduled visit.  
All personnel involved in the conduct of the study will remain blinded to i ndividual treatment 
assignment until planned study unblinding, except for appropriately delegated unblinded 
pharmacists, vaccine administrators, and monitors. The participant , Investigator , and clinical 
staff responsible for study assessments/safety will not have access to the treatment assignment 
during the conduct of the study. The Investigator  may be unblind ed in the event of an emergency  
(refer to Section  6.3.7 ).

Confidential  Page 34 4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
This trial is designed as an observer -blind trial. Participants will receive a single dose of either 
mRNA -1010 vaccine or a licensed quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine (an active 
comparator) in order to assess safety and efficacy of the vaccine . 
In this observer -blind trial, participants, clinic staff involved in participant assessment, and 
Sponsor person nel (or its designees) will be blinded to participant vaccine allocation. A limited 
number of Sponsor and/or contract research organization (CRO) personnel will be unblinded to 
conduct safety data analyses for the DSMB safety data reviews (as described in the DSMB 
charter) and perform the primary analysis. Unblinded study personnel, who will not participate in 
any other aspect of the trial, will perform study intervention  accountability, dose preparation, and 
study intervention  administration.  
The NP swab s pecimen(s) for assessment of pathogens, including influenza virus and severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS -CoV -2), will be collected any time from Day 1 
through Day 361 (Month 12)/EoS if the participants have protocol -defined ILI (see 
Section 8.10.5 ) or if deemed necessary per Investigator’s  discretion  when influenza is suspected . 
If participants experience these signs or symptoms, they will be instructed to contact the clinic to  
determine if an NP swab is required to be collected  for testing. NP swabs may be collected as 
part of a home visit in lieu of a clinic visit. If NP swabs during ILI cannot be collected, any 
available influen za testing results performed outside of the study should be captured in the 
eCRF.  
4.3. Justification for Dose , Control Product, and Choice of Study 
Population  
The selection of the  µg dose level of mRNA -1010 is supported by the data from the Phase 1/2 
and the  Phase 2 NH interim analyses. First, the  µg dose level elicited strong HAI antibody 
responses. The geometric mean tit ers (GMTs ) exceeded the 1:40 titer threshold for the 2 
influenza A strains and 2 influenza B strains tested. This threshold was previous ly correlated 
with a 50% reduction in risk of influenza virus infection. This dose generated robust HAI 
responses for H1N1 and H3N2 strains with Day 29 GMTs that were higher than the licensed 
comparator. Second, the  µg dose level demonstrated an accepta ble reactogenicity and safety 
profile. The frequencies of solicited ARs were lower in the  µg dose level than those of the 
 µg and  µg dose levels while the immunogenicity was comparable. The reactogenicity 
and safety profile of the  µg dose level was not substantially different to that of the  µg dose 
level, whereas the immunogenicity was higher particularly for adults 50 years and older. In 
summary, the safety and immunogenicity profile observed from the mRNA -1010 -P101 study 
supports selec ting mRNA -1010 at a  µg dose level for this study . Further details are provided 
in the IB . 
Fluarix is selected as an active control because it is licensed for the prevention of influenza 
disease in the adult population in the countries that will take par t in this study. Enhanced 
quadrivalent influenza vaccines have not been considered for the ≥ 65 years old age group 
because they are not licensed or preferentially recommended in all participating countries.

treatment assignment.  
Dose preparation, administration, and accountability will be performed by designated unblinded 
site personnel who will not participate in any of the clinical study evaluations. The unblinded site 
personnel will prepare the dose out of view of the particip ant and the blinded site personnel . 
The laboratory personnel in charge of immunogenicity testing will be blinded to the treatment 
assignment of the samples tested throughout the course of the study.  
Except in the case of medical emergency , a participant ’s treatment should not be unblinded 
without the approval of the Sponsor. The treatment code should be broken only if the 
Investigator  in charge of the participant  feels that the case cannot be treated without knowing the 
identity of the study intervention . Instructions regarding emergency unblinding will be provided 
to the Investigator  and are discussed in  Section 6.3.7 . 
The Investigator , clinic sta ff, study participants, site monitors, and Sponsor personnel (or its 
designees) will be blinded to the study intervention  administered until the study database is 
locked and unblinded for the final analysis. At the interim  analys es (see Section  9.6.1 ), pre-
identified Sponsor team members and selected CRO team members will be unblinded to conduct 
the analyses . Study sites will remain blinde d. 
6.3. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability  
6.3.1.  Clinical Study  Material Preparation  
The study intervention  will be prepared for each participant based on their vaccination group 
assignment.  Details of the  study interve ntions are provided in Table  4. Specific  instructions for 
the preparation of mRNA -1010  and active comparator  are contained in the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.3.2.  Clinical Study  Material Admi nistration  
mRNA -1010 or the active comparator  will be administered as a single IM injection into the 
deltoid muscle in adult participants  on Day  1. The study intervention  should be administered 
preferably into the nondominant arm . The dose volume will be held constant at approximately 
 mL per injection.  
Participants will be monitored for  at least 30 minutes after administration of the study 
intervention . Assessments will include vital sign measurements and monitoring for local or 
systemic reactions as s hown in the SoE ( Table  1). 
The clinic will be appropriately staffed with individuals with basic cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation training/certification. Either onsite resuscitation equipment and personnel or 
appropriate protocols for the rapid transport of a participant to a resuscitation area or facility are 
required.  
Further instructions for the preparation and administration of mRNA -1010  and active comp arator  
are described in the Pharmacy Manual .

Confidential  Page 41 6.3.3.  Clinical Study  Material Packaging and Labeling  
The Sponsor will provide the Investigator  (via the clinic pharmacy) with adequate quantities of 
the study intervention . The study intervention  will have all required labeling per regulations and 
will be supplied to the pharmacy in an unblinded manner . 
All study interventions  used in this study will be prepared, packaged, and labeled in accordance 
with the standard operating procedures of the Spo nsor or those of its designee, Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) Title 21, GMP  guidelines, International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) 
GCP guidelines, guidelines for Quality System Regulations, and applicable regulations.  
6.3.4.  Clinical Study  Material Storage  
mRNA -1010 must be stored at the clinical site at 2°C to 8°C in a secure area with limited access 
and must be protected from moisture and light until it is prepared for administration. The 
refrigerator should have automated temperature recording and a 24-hour alert system in place 
that allows for rapid response in case of refrigerator malfunction. The refrigerator should be 
connected to a backup generator. In addition, for study intervention  accountability, site staff are 
required to keep a temperature log t o establish a record of compliance with these storage 
conditions. The clinic is responsible for reporting any study intervention  that was not 
temperature controlled during shipment or storage. Such study intervention  will be retained for 
inspection by the monitor and disposed of according to approved methods. mRNA -1010 will be 
stored at -25°C to -15°C at the depots and during shipments to the clinical sites.  
The active comparator should be stored in its original container and in accordance with the 
instruct ions in the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.3.5.  Clinical Study  Material Accountability  
The Investigator  is responsible for ensuring the study intervention  accountability staff maintain 
an accurate record of the shipment receipt, the inventory at the site, dispensing of study  
intervention , and the return to the Sponsor or alternative disposition of used/unused product(s) in 
a drug accountability log. Drug accountability will be noted by the site monitor during site visits 
and at the completion of the study. For further directi on, refer to the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.3.6.  Clinical Study  Material Handling and Disposal  
A site monitor will reconcile the clinical study material during study conduct and at the end of 
the study for compliance. Once fully reconciled at the site, the clinical study  material can be 
destroyed at the investigational site or a Sponsor -selected  third party, as appropriate.  
Clinical study material  may be destroyed at the clinic only if permitted by local regulations and 
authorized by the Sponsor. A Certificate of Destruction must be obtained and sent to the Sponsor 
or designee. For further direction, refer to the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.3.7.  Unblinding  
Except in the case of medical  emergency , a participant’s treatment assignment should not be 
unblinded without the approval of the Sponsor. If a participant becomes seriously ill or pregnant 
during the study, the blind will be broken only if knowledge of the treat ment assignment will 
affect that participant’s clinical management  (see Section 11.6 for country -specific amendment 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
Protocol mRNA -1010 -P302 Amendment 1  mRNA -1010  
Confidential  Page 42 affecting this paragraph) . In the event of a med ical emergency requiring identification of 
individual treatment assignment, the Investigator  must promptly contact the CRO clinical 
research associate  to explain the need for unblinding within 24  hours of opening the code. The 
Investigator  will be responsi ble for documenting the time, date, reason for unblinding, and the 
names of the personnel involved. The Investigator  (or designee) will have access to unblind 
participants within IRT. All unblinding will be tracked via an audit trail in IRT and documented 
in the final study report.  
6.4. Study Intervention Compliance  
All study interventions will be administered by qualified and trained study personnel to ensure 
that all doses administered comply with those planned. Study vaccine administration  will be 
recorded in the eCRF. Administration data will be reconciled with site accountability record s to 
determine compliance.  
6.5. Concomitant Therapy  
At each visit, the site personnel should question the participant  regarding  any medications taken 
and vaccinations received and record the information as specified in Section  6.5.1 .  
6.5.1.  Recording of Concomitant Medications and Concomitant Vaccinations 
The following concomitant medication s and vaccine s mus t be recorded in the eCRF:  
• All non -study vaccinations administered within the period starting 28 days before the  
study intervention and through Day 361/EoS . 
• All concomitant medications taken through 28 days after the study intervention . 
Antipyretics and analgesics taken prophylactically (ie, taken in the absence of any 
symptoms in anticipation of an injection reaction) will be recorded as such.  
• Any authorized or investigational COVID -19 vaccine at any time before the study 
intervention . 
• Any authorized influenza vaccine administered since August  2021 . 
• Syste mic steroids (≥  10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), immunosuppressants, 
immunoglobulins  and long -acting  biological therapies that affect immune responses (eg 
infliximab) , and/or blood products administered at any time during the study period after 
the study intervention . 
• Any concomitant medications relevant to or for the treatment of an SAE, AESI, or 
medically attended AE (MAAE) from Day 1 through Day  361 (Month  12)/EoS.  
• The participant will be asked to record in the eDiary if they have taken any antipyret ic or 
analgesic to treat or prevent fever or pain within 7  days after the study intervention , 
including the day of injection. Reported antipyretic or analgesic medications should be 
recorded in the source document by the clinic staff during the clinic visi ts after 
vaccination or via other participant interactions (eg, telephone calls).  
Concomitant medications (including vaccinations) will be coded using the WHO Drug Global.

are adequately recorded in the eCRF.  
6.5.2.  Conco mitant Medications and Vaccines that May Lead to the  Elimination of a 
Participant from Per-Protocol Analyses 
The use of the following concomitant medications and/or vaccines will not require withdrawal of 
the participant from the study but may determine a participant’s evaluability in the Per -protocol 
(PP) Set. Analysis sets are described in Sectio n 9.4. 
• Any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study 
intervention used during the study period.  
• Immunosuppressants administer ed chronically (ie, more than 14 days in total) during the 
study period. For gluco corticosteroids, this will mean that prednisone ≥  10 mg/day or the 
equivalent is not permitted.  Inhaled, nasal, intra -articular, and topical steroids are 
allowed . 
• An authoriz ed or licensed noninfluenza vaccine that is not adjuvanted administered 
within 14 days before or after the study intervention . 
• An authorized or licensed adjuvanted, noninfluenza vaccine administered within 28  days 
after the study intervention . 
• Any non-study influenza vaccine administered during the study period . 
• Immunoglobulins  and long -acting  biological therapies that affect immune responses (eg , 
infliximab ) and/or any blood products administered during the study period.  
6.6. Continuous Access to Study Intervention After the End of the Study

AND PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
7.1. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
Participants who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study will not be replaced.  From an 
analysis perspective, a “withdrawal” from the study refers to a situation wherein a participant 
does not return for the final visit foreseen in the protocol.  
Participants can withdraw consent and withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, 
without prejudice to further treatment the participant may need to receive. The Investigator  will 
request that the participant complete all study procedures pending at the time of withdrawal.  
If a participant desires to withdraw from the study because of an AE, the Investigator  will 
attempt to obtain agreement to follow -up with the participant until the event is considered 
resolved or stable and will then complete the  EoS section of the eCRF.  
All data collected until the date of withdrawal or last contact of the participant will be used for 
the analysis.  
Information relative to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF. The Investigator  will 
document whether the de cision to withdraw a participant from the study was made by the 
participant, or by the Investigator , as well as which of the following possible reasons was 
responsible for withdrawal:  
• AE (specify)  
• SAE (specify)  
• Solicited AR or reactogenicity event (specify ) 
• Death  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Physician decision (specify)  
• Pregnancy  
• Protocol violation  
• Study terminated by Sponsor  
• Withdrawal of consent by participant (specify)  
• Other (specify)  
Participants who are withdrawn from the study because of AEs (including SAEs or solicited 
ARs) must be clearly distinguished from participants who are withdrawn for other reasons. 
Investigator s will follow -up with participants who are withdrawn from the study as a result of an 
AE, SAE, or solicited AR until resolution or stabilization  of the event.  
If a participant withdraws from the study, they may request destruction of any samples taken and 
not tested, and the Investigator  must document this in the site study records . 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
Protocol mRNA -1010 -P302 Amendment 1  mRNA -1010  
Confidential  Page 45 If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent  (see Section 11.1.6 ). 
The Sponsor wil l continue to retain and use all research results that have already been collected 
for the study evaluation. All biological samples that have already been collected may be retained 
and analyzed at a later date (or as permitted by local regulations).  
7.2. Lost t o Follow up  
A participant  will be considered Lost to Follow -up (LTFU) if the participant  repeatedly fails to 
return for scheduled visits without stating an intention to withdraw consent and is unable to be 
contacted by the study site.  The following actions  must be taken if a participant fails to return to 
the clinic for a required study visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible , counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the ass igned visit 
schedule and  ascertain whether  the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the 
study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator  or designee must make 
an effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if 
necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local ly 
equivalent methods). These contact attempts (eg, dates of telephone calls and  registered 
letters) should be documented in the participant’s medical record.  
• Should the participant continue to be unreachable, the partic ipant will be considered to 
have withdrawn from the study.  
• A participant should not be considered LTFU until due diligence , as described above,  has 
been completed.

administered via a single IM injection into the deltoid muscle. A detailed description of the 
vaccine administration procedure is provid ed in Section  6.3.2 . 
The participants will be observed closely (via clinical assessment including measurement of vital 
signs) for at least 30 minut es following administration of the study intervention , with appropriate 
medical treatment readily available in case of anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reactions . 
8.8. Efficacy Assessments  
Assessment will be conducted to document RT -PCR -confirmed protocol -defined -ILI that begins 
at least 14 days post vaccination through Day 181 (Month  6)/end of influenza season  caused by 
any influenza A or B virus strains or by strains similar to or antigenic ally match ed to the strains 
selected for the seasonal vaccine . 
Participants who develop symptoms consistent with protocol -defined ILI will have NP swabs 
collected for testing and ILI symptoms assessed. The initial test on the NP swab will be a real -
time RT-PCR -based assay, to determine if either influenza A and/or B s trains, as well as other 
respiratory viruses such as SARS -CoV -2, are present in the clinical sample. For samples that test 
positive for influenza in the RT -PCR assay, additional assays such as  genetic sequencing of the 
virus genes and/or virus culture with  subsequent antigenicity testing  will be  performed to 
determine vaccine match  or simila rity.  
8.9. Safety Assessments  
Safety assessments will include monitoring and recording of the following for each participant in 
the study:  
• Solicited local and systemic ARs ( Section 8.10.3 ) that occur through the 7 days following 
the study intervention  (ie, the day of injection and 6 subsequent days). Solicited ARs will 
be recorded daily using eDiar y (Section 8.9.4 ). 
• Unsolicited AEs ( Section  8.10.1 ) observed or report ed through  the 28 days following the 
study intervention  (ie, the day of injection and 27 subsequent days).  Unsolicited AEs are 
defined in Section  8.10.1 .

Confidential  Page 48 • AEs leading to discontinuation from study participation from Day 1 through Day 361 
(Month 12)/ EoS or withdrawal from the study.  
• MAAEs from Day 1 through Day 361 (Month 12)/ EoS or withdrawal from the study.  
MAAEs are defined in Section  8.10.4 . 
• AESIs from Day 1 through Day 361 (Month 12)/ EoS or withdrawal from the study.  
AESIs are defined in Section  8.10.6 . 
• SAEs from Day 1 through Day 361 (Month 12)/ EoS or withdrawal from the study.  SAEs 
are defined in Section 8.10.2 . 
• Vital sign s measurement.  
• Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of study 
intervention and until the end of their participation in the study ( Section  8.9.5 ). All 
pregnancies must be followed to determine the outcome; however, pregnancy 
related -data received after the end of the study may not be collected in the clinical 
database.  
Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoE (Table  1). 
8.9.1.  Pregnancy Screen  and Testing  
A pregnancy test via point of care urine test will be performed for all female participants of 
childbearing potential at the Screening visit and before the vaccine dose on Day 1, if Day 1 is not 
on the same day as the Screening visit. At the discretion of the Investigator, a pregnancy test 
either via blood or point -of-care urine can be performed at any time. Additional pregnancy 
testing du ring the study may also be performed if required by local regulatory requirements. The 
participant’s FSH level may be measured at the Screening visit, as necessary, and at the 
discretion of the Investigator , to confirm postmenopausal status ( Section  11.2). 
Further details on reporting and follow -up of pregnancy are provided in Section  8.9.5 . 
8.9.2.  Assessments for Respiratory Viral Infections  
The NP swab specimen(s) for pathogens, including influenza virus , will be collected any time 
from Day 1 to Day 361 (Month 12)/EoS if participants have protocol -defined ILI 
(Section  8.10.5 ) or if deemed necessary per Investigator’s  discretion when influenza is 
suspected . If part icipants experience these signs or symptoms, they will be instructed to contact 
the clinic to determine if they need an  NP swab collected for testing . NP swab collection should 
occur within  72 hours of symptom  onset. Sites may follow up with  participants for symptom 
review if illness symptoms are noted upon review of the Symptom Reporting eDiary to a ssess 
whether the participant is required to provide an NP swab.  NP swab should be collected prior to 
any antiviral therapy, if possible. NP sw abs may be collected as part of a home visit in lieu of a 
clinic visit. In the event that NP swabs during ILI cannot be collected, any available influenza 
testing results performed outside of the study should be captured  in the eCRF . 
Participants who experience proto col-defined ILI ( Section  8.10.5 ) must have NP swab s collected 
for RT-PCR testing of influenza virus and other respiratory pathogens.  For participants who 
experience ILI symptoms but have not yet fulfilled protocol -defined ILI  definition , Investigators 
may use their discretion to perform NP swab s when influenza is suspected.  If Investigator 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
Protocol mRNA -1010 -P302 Amendment 1  mRNA -1010  
Confidential  Page 49 discretion is applied, participant should be followed -up for any  new symptoms following NP 
swab collection .  
Symptoms reporting for ILI will be conducted between Day 1 through Day 361 (Month 12)/EoS 
as described in Section  8.9.4 . 
All cases that meet the definition of RT -PCR -confirmed influenza infection  should be captured 
as MAAEs along with relevant concomitant medications, hospitalizations, outpatient medical 
care,  and details about severity, seriousness, and outcome.  
If an unscheduled visit for assessment of protocol -defined ILI occurs within the first 28 days post 
study injection, the event should be captured as an unsolicited AE on the Adverse Event eCRF 
page. If such an unscheduled visit occurs after Day 29, it should be captured as an AE  only if it 
meets MAAE definition  (additional medical evaluation, including examinations/testing not 
required per protocol, and/or treatment is provided during the visit) OR if the participant meets 
RT-PCR confirmed influenza infection (RT -PCR with positive result for influenza)  
(Section  8.10.5 ). 
8.9.3.  Safety Telep hone Calls  
A safety telephone call is a telephone call made to the participant by trained site personnel. This 
call will follow a script, which will facilitate the collection of relevant safety information. Safety 
telephone calls will follow a schedule for each partici pant, as shown in the SoE ( Table  1). The 
participant will be interviewed according to the script about occurrence of AEs, MAAEs, SAEs, 
AESIs, AEs lead ing to withdrawal from study participation, concomitant medications associated 
with those events, and any nonstudy vaccinations. All safety information collected from the 
telephone contact must be documented in source documents as described by the particip ant and 
not documented on the script used for the safety telephone contact. An unscheduled follow up 
safety call may be triggered if an eDiary record results in identification of a relevant safety event.  
8.9.4.  Use of Electronic Diaries  
At the time of consent, the participants must confirm they will be willing to complete an eDiary 
(for 7 -day reactogenicity). The local and system ic ARs that will be solicited by the eDiary are 
described in Table  5. 
Solicited local and systemic reactogenicity ARs will be collected on the day of study intervention  
and during the 7 days after study intervention  (ie, the day of dosing and 6 subsequent days). 
Details on the recording of local and systemic ARs are included in Section  8.10.3 . 
At the dosing visit , participants will record data into the eDiary starting approximately 
30 minutes after dosing under supervision of the site staff to ensure successful entry of 
assessments. The 30-minute observation period is an opportunity for site staff to train the 
participant on eDiary completion requirements. The site staff will perform any retraining as 
necessary  throughout the study . 
At the dosing visit, participants will be instructed on thermometer usage to measure body 
temperature, ruler usage to measure injectio n site erythema (redness) and swelling/induration 
(hardness), and self -assessment for localized axillary (underarm) swelling or tenderness 
ipsilateral (on the same  side as the injection arm [s]) during the 7 days after study injection. Daily 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
Protocol mRNA -1010 -P302 Amendment 1  mRNA -1010  
Confidential  Page 50 oral temperatur e measurement should be performed at approximately the same time each day 
using the thermometer provided by the site staff.  
The participant will be trained on how to complete the eDiary questions according to the SoE 
(Table  1) and also reminded to call the site immediately if they experience any  condition . If 
eDiary questions result in identification of relevant safety events according to the study perio d or 
symptoms of ILI, a follow -up call will be triggered. The results of the call should be recorded in 
the appropriate source documentation.  
If a participant does not respond to the eDiary questions according to the So E, site staff will 
follow -up with the  participant.  
8.9.5.  Recording and Follow -up of Pregnancy  
The effects of mRNA -1010 on the unborn child and on the newborn baby are not known. 
Because of this, it is important that study participants are not pregnant and do not become 
pregnant during the course o f the study. Female individuals who have a positive pregnancy test 
at the Screening visit should not be enrolled; participants who have a positive pregnancy test at 
Day 1 must not receive the study intervention and should be withdrawn from the study. Femal e 
participants who become pregnant at any time during the study after receiving the study 
intervention  should be asked to remain in the study and be followed -up for safety. Pregnancy 
testing is scheduled to occur at the Screening visit and Day 1 ( Table  1). Additional pregnancy 
testing during the study may also be performed if required by local regulatory requirements.  
Pregnancies  reported  in female part icipants will be collected after the start of study intervention  
and until Day 361 (Month 12)/EoS.  
• If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined  in this section.  
• Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.  
Pregnancies occurring in participants after  administration  of study intervention  must be reporte d 
to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the site learning of its occurrence. If the participant 
agrees to submit this information, the pregnancy must be followed to determine the outcome, 
including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of t he birth, and the presence or absence 
of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. This 
follow -up should occur even if intended duration of the safety follow -up for the study has ended. 
Pregnancy report forms wi ll be distributed to the study site  to be used for this purpose. The 
Investigator must immediately (within 24 hours of awareness) report to the Sponsor any 
pregnancy resulting in an abnormal outcome according to the procedures described for SAEs.  
8.9.6.  Recording  and Follow -up of an AE and/or SAE  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded in the eCRF and 
reported to the Sponsor.  
Solicited ARs will be collected from Day 1 through 7 days after the study intervention  (ie, the 
day of injection and 6 subsequent days). Other (unsolicited) AEs will be collected from Day 1 
through 28  days after the study intervention  (ie, the day of injection and 27 subsequent days).  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
Protocol mRNA -1010 -P302 Amendment 1  mRNA -1010  
Confidential  Page 51 MAAEs, SAEs, and AESIs will be collected from participants as specifie d in the SoE  (Table  1) 
from Day 1 until the end of their participation in the study.  
At every clinic visit or telephone contact, participants will be asked a standard question to elicit 
any medically related changes in their well -being (including surveillance for respiratory viral 
infection symptoms) according to the scripts provided. Participants will also be asked if they 
have been hospitalized, had a ny accidents, used any new medications, changed concomitant 
medication regimens (both prescription and over -the-counter medications), or had any non -study 
vaccinations.  
In addition to participant observations, physical examination findings and other docume nts 
relevant to participant safety classified as an AE will be documented on the AE page of the 
eCRF.  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs and SAEs will be treated as medically 
appropriate and followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the 
participant is LTFU (as defined in Section  7.2). 
8.9.7.  Reporting Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported during the 
study, regardless of their relationship to the study intervention  or their clinical significance. If 
there is a ny doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported.  
All unsolicited AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded on the AE page of the 
eCRF. Information to be collected includes, type of event, time of onset,  Investigator -specified 
assessment of severity (impact on activities of daily living) and relationship to study 
intervention , time of resolution of the event, seriousness, as well as any required treatment or 
evaluations, and outcome. The unsolicited AEs r esulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to 
concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must 
also be reported. All AEs will be followed until they are resolved or stable or judged by the 
Investigator to be not clinically significant. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) will be used to code all unsolicited AEs.  
Refer to Section  8.9.9  for reporting of m edical occurrences that begin before the start of study 
intervention  administration but after obtaining informed consent . 
8.9.8.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Any AE considered serious by the Investigator or that meets SAE criteria ( Section  8.10.2 ) must 
be reported to the Sponsor immediately (within 24 hours of becoming aware of the SAE). The 
Investigator will assess whether ther e is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention  
caused the SAE. The Sponsor will be responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities 
of any SAE as outlined in the 21 US CFR Parts 312 and 320. The Investigator is responsible for 
notif ying the institutional review board (IRB) or independent ethics committee (IEC) directly.  
If the eCRF is unavailable at the time of the SAE, the paper SAE/AESI Report Form distributed 
to the study sites should be completed and sent via email or fax  as prov ided on the form.   
Regulatory reporting requirements for SAEs are described in Section  8.9.11 . 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
Protocol mRNA -1010 -P302 Amendment 1  mRNA -1010  
Confidential  Page 52 The Investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE, including SAEs, and remain responsible for 
following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study i ntervention  or study 
procedures, or that caused the participant to discontinue the study.  
8.9.9.  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information  
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study intervention  administration but after 
obtaini ng informed consent will be recorded in the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions 
section of the eCRF and not in the AE section; however, if the condition worsens at any time 
after study intervention  administration, it will be recorded and reported as  an AE.  
Adverse events may be collected as follows:  
• Observing the participant . 
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the participant . 
• Questioning the participant in an unbiased and nonleading manner . 
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately and under no 
circumstance should this exceed 24 hours of becoming aware of the event, as indicated in 
Section  8.10.2 . The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 
hours of it being available.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after conclusion of the study 
participation (EoS). However, if an Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any 
time after a participant has been discharged from the study and considers the event to be 
reasonably related to the study intervention  or study participation, the Investigator must promptly 
notify the Sponsor.  
8.9.10.  Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
eDiary has specifically been designed for this study by the Sponsor  to collect solicited ARs . 
Refer to Section  8.9.4  for further details on the use of eDiary. Details on recording of solicited 
ARs in an eDiary  are included in Section  8.10.3 . 
The Investigator is responsible for the documentation of AEs regardless of vaccination group or 
suspected causal relationship to the study intervention . For all AEs, the Investigator must pursue 
and obtain information adequate to determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether the 
AE meets the criteria for classification as an SAE or AESI requiring immediate notification to 
the Sponsor or its designated representative.  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs . Open ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE 
occurrences.  
8.9.11.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
Prompt notification by the Investigator to the Sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal  
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
Protocol mRNA -1010 -P302 Amendment 1  mRNA -1010  
Confidential  Page 53 The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulat ory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to 
the regulatory authority, IRB/IEC, and Investigators.  
Safety reports m ust be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction s and will be 
forwarded to Investigators according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy.  
An Investigator who receives a safety report describing a n SAE or other specific safety  
information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will review and then file it along 
with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
8.9.12.  Blood Sampling Volumes  
The maximum amount of blood collected from eac h participant over the duration of the study, 
including any extra assessments that may be required , will not exceed blood limits  specified in 
the ICF. Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues 
with the samples. F urther details are provided in both the ICF and Laboratory Reference Manual.  
8.9.13.  Ancillary Supplies for Participant Use  
Clinics  will distribute Sponsor -provided oral thermometers and rulers for use by participants in 
assessing body temperature and injection site reactions for recording solicited ARs in the eDiar y. 
8.10. Safety Definitions  
8.10.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as any event not present before exposure to the 
study intervention  or any event already present that worsens in intensity or frequency after 
exposure.  
Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after the first dose of study intervention  even 
though they may have been present before the st art of the study.  
Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
• Procedures planned before study entry (eg, hospitalization for preplanned surgical 
procedure) . 
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy ) - the condition that leads 
to the p rocedure should be the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
Protocol mRNA -1010 -P302 Amendment 1  mRNA -1010  
Confidential  Page 54 An unsolicited AE is any AE reported by the participant that is not specified as a solicited AR 
(Section  8.10.3 ) in the protocol; or is specified as a solicited AR in the protocol , but starts 
outside the protocol -defined period for reporting solicited ARs (ie,  for the 7  days after each dose 
of the study intervention ).  
8.10.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
An AE (including a  solicited  AR) is considered a SAE if it results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• Results in Death  
• Is life -threatening   
An AE is considered life -threatening if, in the view of either the Investigator  or the 
Sponsor, its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does not 
include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death . 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
In general, inpatient hospitalization indicates the participant was admitted to the hospital 
or emergency ward for at least 1 overnight stay as an inpatient  for observation and/or 
treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient 
setting. Complications that occur during inpatient hospitalization will be recorded as an 
AE; however, if a complication/AE prolongs hospitalization or otherwise fulfills SA E 
criteria, the complication/AE will be recorded as a separate SAE.  
• Persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal  life functions  
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relat ively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life 
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption  (see Section 11.6 for country -
specific amendment affecting this paragraph) . 
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Medically important event   
An AE is medically important if, per the m edical judgment of the Inves tigator or the 
Sponsor, it is determined that  SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as 
important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death 
or hospitalization , but may jeopardize the participant or require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
Protocol mRNA -1010 -P302 Amendment 1  mRNA -1010  
Confidential  Page 55 8.10.3.  Solicited Adverse Reactions  
Solicited ARs are  a subset of AEs consisting of selected signs and symptoms  that participants are 
asked to record /report . In this study, the solicited ARs are reactogenicity events. The term 
“reactogenicity” refers to the occurrence of transient adverse effects associated with  vaccine 
administration . An eDiary will prompt  daily par ticipant reporting of solicited ARs using a 
structured checklist ( Section  8.9.4 ). Participants will record such occurrences in the eDiary on 
the day o f administration of study intervention  and on each of  the 6  days after dosing.  
Severity grading of reactogenicity events will be automatically assigned up on participant entry 
into the eDiary based on  the grading scales presented in Table  5, which are  modified from the 
Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventative 
Vaccine Clinical Trials ( DHHS 2007 ). All solicited ARs (local and systemic) will be considered 
causally related to dosing.  
If a participant report s a solicited AR with onset during the solicited period , but they  did not 
record the event in the eDiary, the n the event should be recorded by study staff on the 
Reactogenicity page of the eCRF.  
If the event starts during the solicited period, but continues beyond 7 days after dosing, the 
participants should notify the site to provide an end date and close out the event on the 
Reactogenicity page of the eCRF.  
If the participant reported an event that started after the solicited period (ie, after Day 7), it 
should be recorded as an AE on the AE page of the eCRF. Causality for these  event s will be 
determined per assessment by the Investigator . 
Any solicited AR that meets any of the following criteria must be entered into the participant’s 
source document and must also be recorded by the study site staff in the solicited AR section of 
the pa rticipant’s  eCRF:  
• Solicited AR that results in a visit to a healthcare practitioner (HCP) (MAAE).  
• Solicited AR leading to the participant withdrawing from the study or the participant 
being withdrawn from the study by the Investigator (AE leading to with drawal).  
• Solicited AR lasting beyond 7 days post injection.  
• Solicited AR that otherwise meets the definition of an SAE.

Confidential  Page 57 8.10.4.  Medically Attended Adverse Events  
An MAAE is an AE that leads to an unscheduled visit to a n HCP. This would include visits to a 
study clinic for unscheduled assessments (eg, rash assessment, abnormal laboratory follow -up) 
and visits to HCPs ex ternal to the study clinic (eg, emergency room, urgent care, primary care 
physician). Investigators will review unsolicited AEs for the occurrence of any MAAEs. 
Unsolicited AEs will be captured on the AE page of the eCRF . 
An unscheduled visit for assessmen t of protocol -defined ILI (symptoms assessment  and NP 
swab) is not considered an MAAE unless additional medical evaluation, including 
examination s/testing not required per protocol , and/or treatment is provided during  the visit , OR 
if the participant meets RT-PCR confirmed influenza infection (RT-PCR with positive result for 
influenza) (Section  8.10.5 ). 
8.10.5.  Influenza -like Illness  Case Definitions  
Protocol -defined ILI:  
A protocol -defined ILI is defined as body temperature ≥  37.5°C [ ≥ 99.5°F]) accompanied by at 
least 1  respiratory illness symptom (sore throat, cough, sputum production, wheezing , or 
difficulty breathing).   
CDC -define d ILI:  
A CDC -defined ILI is defined as body temperature ≥ 37.8°C (≥  100°F) accompanied by cough 
and/or sore throat.  
RT-PCR -confirmed Influenza Infection:  
An RT -PCR -confirmed influenza infection is defined as a positive influenza result on a 
respiratory sam ple by RT -PCR within 7 days of onset of protocol - or CDC -defined ILI 
performed at any setting during the study period.  
Culture -confirmed Influenza Infection:  
Culture -defined ILI is defined as a positive influenza result by viral culture following a positive 
influenza result by RT -PCR. Viral cultures will only be done on samples with a positive 
influenza result by RT -PCR.  
Similarity to Strains Selected for the Seasonal Vaccine:  
A laboratory -confirmed isolate is deemed similar to one of the vaccine com ponents if determined 
by antigenic testing of the cultured virus  using specific antisera  and/or by genetic sequencing of 
the HA segments  showing identity of key antigenic residues with vaccine  strain -like strains . 
Antigenic Matched to Strains Selected for the Seasonal Vaccine  
Culture -confirmed viruses are deemed to be antigenically similar to vaccine strains by antigenic 
testing of the cultured virus using specific antisera . 
8.10.6.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AESI is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scie ntific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by the 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
Protocol mRNA -1010 -P302 Amendment 1  mRNA -1010  
Confidential  Page 58 Investigator  to the Sponsor are required. Such events may require further investigation to 
characterize and understand t hem.  
AESI s for this protocol are described in Section  11.4. 
All AESIs will be collected through the entire study period and must be reported to the Sponsor 
or designee immediately and in all circumstances within 24 hours of becoming aware of the 
event via the electronic data capture system. If a site received a report of a new AESI from a 
participant or receives updated information on a previously rep orted AESI at a time after the 
eCRF has been taken offline, then the site should report this information on the paper SAE/ AESI 
Report Form  provided to the study site via email or fax as provided on the form  (Section  8.9.8 ). 
8.10.6.1.  Anaphylaxis  
All suspected  (ie, related to study intervention ) cases of anaphylaxis should be recorded as 
MAAEs and AESIs and reported as an SAE, based on the criteri a for a medically important 
event, unless the event meets other serious criteria. As an SAE, the event should be reported to 
the Sponsor or designee immediately and in all circumstances within 24 hours, per Section  8.9.8 . 
The Investigator  will submit any updated anaphylaxis case data to the Sponsor within 24 hours 
of it being available. For reporting purposes, a participant who displays signs or sympt oms 
consistent with anaphylaxis (as below) should be reported as a potential case of anaphylaxis. 
This is provided as general guidance for Investigator s and is based on the Brighton Collaboration 
case definition ( Rüggeberg et al 2007 ). 
Anaphylaxis is an acute hypersensitive reaction with multi -organ system involvement that can 
present as, or rapidly progress to, a severe life -threatening reaction. It may occur following 
exposure to allergens from a variety of sources.  
Anaphy laxis is a clinical syndrome characterized by the following:  
• Sudden onset AND  
• Rapid progression of signs and symptoms AND  
• Involves 2 or more organ systems, as follows:  
− Skin/mucosal:  urticaria (hives), generalized erythema, angioedema, generalized pruritus 
with skin rash, generalized prickle sensation, red and itchy eyes . 
− Cardiovascular:  measured hypotension, clinical diagnosis of uncompensated shock, loss 
of consciousness or decrease d level of consciousness, evidence of reduced peripheral 
circulation . 
− Respiratory:  bilateral wheeze (bronchospasm), difficulty breathing, stridor, upper 
airway swelling (lip, tongue, throat, uvula, or larynx), respiratory distress, persistent dry 
cough, ho arse voice, sensation of throat closure, sneezing, rhinorrhea . 
− Gastrointestinal:  diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting .

Confidential  Page 59 8.10.6.2.  Myocarditis/Pericarditis  
A case of suspected, probable, or confirmed myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis should 
be report ed as an AESI, even if it does not meet criteria per the CDC Working Case Definitions. 
The event should also be reported as an SAE if it meets seriousness criteria ( see Section  8.9.8 ). 
An independent Cardiac Event Adjudication Committee (CEAC) will review suspected cases of 
myocarditis, pericarditis, and myopericarditis to determine if they meet CDC criteria for 
“probable” or “confirmed” events ( Secti on 8.11.2 ). 
The CDC Working Case Definitions are provided in Section  11.5 as guidance.  
8.10.7.  Assessment of Intensity /Severity  
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least one of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE ( Section  8.9.8 ), NOT when it is rated as severe.  
The severity (or intensity) of an AR or AE refers to the extent to which it affects the participant’s 
daily activities. The Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers 
Enrolled in Preventative Vaccine Clinical Trials ( DHHS 2007 ) will be used to categorize local 
and systemic reactogenicity events ( solicited ARs ), clinical laboratory test results, and vital sign 
measurements observed during this study. Specific criteria for local and systemic reactogenicity 
events are presented in Section  8.10.3 .  
The determination of severity for all unsolicited AEs should be made by the Investigator  based 
upon medical judgment and the definitions of severity as follows:  
• Mild: These events do not in terfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate: These events cause some interference with the participant’s daily activities and 
require limited or no medical intervention.  
• Severe: These events prevent the participant’s daily activity and requ ire intensive 
therapeutic intervention.  
Study staff should elicit from the participant the impact of AEs on the participant’s activities of 
daily living to assess severity and document appropriately in the participant’s source 
documentation. An AE charact erized as intermittent requires documentation of onset and 
duration of each episode. An AE that fluctuates in severity during the course of the event is 
reported once in the eCRF at the highest severity observed . 
8.10.8.  Assessment of Causality  
The Investigator  will assess causality (ie, whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study 
intervention  caused the event) for all AEs and SAEs. The relationship will be characterized using 
the following classification:  
Not related:  There is not a reasonable possib ility of a relationship to the study intervention . 
Participant did not receive the study intervention  OR temporal sequence of the AE onset relative 
to administration of the study intervention  is not reasonable OR the AE is more likely explained 
by another cause than the study intervention .

Protocol mRNA -1010 -P302 Amendment 1  mRNA -1010  
Confidential  Page 60 Related:  There is a reasonable possibility of a relationship to the study intervention . There is 
evidence of exposure to the study intervention . The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative 
to the administration of the study intervention  is reasonable. The AE is more likely explained by 
the study intervention  than by another cause.  
8.11. Safety Oversight  
8.11.1.  Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
A DSMB will b e used throughout the conduct of this study. This committee will be composed of 
independent members with relevant therapeutic and/or biostatistical expertise to allow for the 
ongoing review of safety data from this study population. Safety data will be rev iewed according 
to intervals defined in the DSMB charter and will also occur as needed.  
8.11.2.  Independent Cardiac Event Adjudication Committee  
An independent Cardiac Event Adjudication Committee (CEAC) of medically qualified 
personnel, including cardiologists, will review suspected cases of myocarditis and pericarditis to 
determine if they meet CDC criteria of “probable” or “confirmed” events, and to assess severity 
(Gargano et al 2021 ). Any cases that the CEAC assesses as represent ing probable or confirmed 
cases of myocarditis or pericarditis will be referred to the Sponsor, who will then make a final 
decision on whether to suspend further enrollment and/or study dosing based on an assessment of 
the overall potential risk to study p articipants.  
The CEAC will operate under the rules of an approved charter that will be written and reviewed 
at the organizational meeting of the CEAC. Details regarding the CEAC composition, 
responsibilities, procedures, and frequency of data review will b e defined in its charter.  
8.12. Treatment of Overdose  
As the study intervention  is to be administered by a HCP , it is unlikely that an overdose will 
occur.  
However, in the event of an overdose, the Investigator  should:  
1. Contact the Medical Monitor immediately.  
2. Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities until the 
last safety follow -up visit.  
3. Report any signs or symptoms associated with the overdose as an AE and record details 
in the relevant AE/SAE sections in the eCRF.  
4. Document the  quantity of the excess dose in the eCRF.  
8.13. Pharmacokinetics  
Pharmacokinetic  parameters are not evaluated in this study . 
8.14. Pharmacodynamics   
Pharmacodynamic parameters are not evaluated in this study.

Confidential  Page 61 8.15. Biomarkers  
Additional b iomarkers may be evaluated as part of future research  objectives and development . 
Biomarker assessments may be evaluated as part of the study, which may include serum 
antibody level s, genomic and transcriptomic s studies  from consented participants.  
According to the ICF  (Section  11.1.6 ), serum from biomarker testing may be used for future 
research, which may be performed at the discretion of the Sponsor to further characterize the 
immune response to influenza vaccines, additional assay development, and the immune response 
across influenza viruses ( Section  11.1.10 ). Optional blood collections for DNA and mRNA 
sequencing may be performed to research connections between  vaccine responses and safety.  
NP swabs collected in the study may be used for assay development purposes .  
8.16. Patient -Reported Outcomes  and Medical Resource Utilization  
Exploratory objectives related to patient -reported outcomes (PROs) and medical resource 
utilization are listed in Section  3. 
Patient-reported outcomes and medical resource utilization associated with symptoms of ILI will 
be assessed at time points specified in the SoE ( Table  1). 
8.16.1.  Patient -reported Outcome Measures  
Patient -reported outcome measures will include the following questionnaires: EFS, EQ -5D-5L 
scale, and WPAI:ILI.  
8.16.1.1.  EFS 
At Day 1, t he EFS will be collected  by clinical staff for participants aged 65 years and older. 
This scale is a brief, valid, and reliable tool for assessment of frailty across 9 domains: cognition, 
general health status, functional independence, social support, medication use, nutrition, mood , 
continence, and functional performance.  
8.16.1.2.  EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ -5D-5L consists of both the EQ -5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale.  
For all participants, responses to the EQ -5D-5L will be collected using the eDiary at Day 1  
(baseline) , Day  91, D ay 181, Day 271, and Day 361  (Month 12)/EoS . For participants reporting 
symptoms of ILI , the EQ -5D-5L responses will be collected using the eDiary on the day of 
symptoms reporting  (+1 day), and 5 days (+1  day) later . 
8.16.1.3.  WPAI  
For participants reporting symptom s of ILI, the WPAI over the previous 7 days will be collected 
using the eDiary at 5 days (+1 day) following start of the symptoms. The participant will be 
prompted to report productivity or activity impairment related to their  ILI. The list of the ILI 
symptoms that are part of their reporting of symptoms are the specific health problem to be 
considered.

9.1. Blinding and Responsibility for Analyses  
This is an observer -blind study. The Investigator , clinic staff, study participants, site monitors, 
and Sponsor personnel (or its designees) will be blinded to the  study interventio n administered 
until the study database is locked and unblinded, with the following exceptions:  
• Unblinded personnel (of limited number) will be assigned to vaccine accountability 
procedures and will prepare the study intervention  for all participants. Thes e personnel 
will have no study functions other than the study intervention  management, 
documentation, accountability, preparation, and administration. They will not be involved 
in participant evaluations and will not reveal the identity of the study interv ention  to 
either the participant or the blinded clinic personnel involved in the conduct of the study 
unless this information is necessary in the case of an emergency.  
• Unblinded clinic personnel will administer the study intervention . They will not be 
involved in assessments of any study endpoints.  
• Unblinded site monitors, not involved in other aspects of monitoring, will be assigned as 
the study intervention  accountability monitors. They will have responsibilities to ensure 
that sites are following all pro per study intervention  accountability, preparation, and 
administration procedures.  
• An independent unblinded statistical and programming team will perform the preplanned 
interim analyses ( Section  9.5.4 ). Sponsor team members will be pre -specified to be 
unblinded to the interim analyses results and will not communicate the results to the 
blinded Investigator s, clinic staff, clinical monitors, or partici pants.  
• The DSMB may review data, as appropriate, to safeguard the interests of clinical trial 
participants and to help ensure the integrity of the study.  
The dosing assignment will be concealed by having the unblinded pharmacy personnel prepare 
the study i ntervention in a secure location that is not accessible or visible to other clinic staff. An 
opaque sleeve over the syringe used for injection will maintain the blind at the time of injection, 
as mRNA -1010 will look different from the active comparator. Only delegated unblinded clinic 
staff will conduct the injection procedure. Once the injection is completed, only the blinded 
clinic staff will perform further assessments and interact with the participants. Access to the 
randomization code will be strictl y controlled at the pharmacy.  
Procedures for breaking the blind in the case of a medical emergency are provided in 
Section  6.3.7 . 
9.2. Statistical Hypoth eses 
The primary efficacy objective of this study is to evaluate  relative vaccine efficacy  (rVE)  of 
mRNA -1010 as compared to an active comparator , to prevent the occurrence of  the first episode 
of RT-PCR confirmed protocol -defined ILI caused by any influen za A or B virus strains.  
The null hypothesis  to be tested  first is that the rVE of mRNA -1010 as compared to an active 
comparator  is inferior , using a 10% noninferiority margin (NIM), (ie, H01: rVE≤ -10%). The rVE 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
Protocol mRNA -1010 -P302 Amendment 1  mRNA -1010  
Confidential  Page 64 is defined as the percent of reduction in the hazards of the primary endpoint (mRNA -1010 vs. 
active comparator).  Equivalently, the null hypothesis is: H 01: hazard ratio (HR) ≥ 1.1  
A stratified Cox proportional hazard model will be used to assess the HR between mRNA -1010  
and the active comparator at a 1-sided 2.5% significance level , using the PP Set. 
The trial will be considered to meet the primary efficacy objective by demonstrat ing 
noninferiority (NI) of mRNA -1010 to the active comparator if the p-value  for rejecting HR ≥ 1.1 
is less than the nominal p-value  based on the Lan-DeMets Pocock  approximation spending 
function  at the IA or final analysis , on the PP Set. Cases will be counted starting 14 days after the 
vaccination.  
Once NI is demonstrated, the rVE will be further evaluated using the same endpoint  for 
superiority . The null hypothesis to be tested is H02: rVE ≤ 0%. Equivalently, the null hypothesis 
is: H 02: HR ≥ 1. 
Superiority of mRNA -1010 versus (vs.) the active comparator on the primary efficacy endpoint 
will be concluded  if the p-value  for rejecting HR ≥ 1 is less than the nominal p-value  based on  
the Lan-DeMets Pocock  approximation spending function , on the mITT Set.  
9.3. Sample Size  
The sample size is driven by the total number of cases to demonstrate  rVE (mRNA -1010 vs. 
active comparator) to prevent the first episode of RT-PCR confirmed protocol -defined ILI  
caused by any influenza A or B virus strains.  
Under the assumption of proportional hazards and with 1:1 randomization of mRNA -1010 and 
active comparator, a total of 365 cases on the PP Set will provide at least 93% power to establish 
a NI claim with a selected NIM =  10%, ie, rejecting the null hypothe sis H 01: rVE ≤ -10%, with 
one IA using the Lan-DeMets Pocock  boundary for efficacy and a log -rank test statistic with a n 
overall  1-sided Type I error rate of 2.5%. 
The n umber of c ases will be continuously monitored using external epidemiologic data (eg, 
CDC.gov). It is projected that by middle of February 2023, approximately 274 cases  (75% of the 
targeted cases)  will be observed in the PP Set. In the scenario that fewer cases are observed by 
middle of February, the IA will still be conducted around this t imeframe because of  the 
seasonality of influenza in the Northern Hemisphere, and the nominal alpha to be spent that the 
IA and final analysis  will be adjusted accordingly .  
The total number of cases pertains to the  PP Set accruing at least 14 days after study 
intervention .  
Approximately 23,000 participants will be randomized with the following assumptions:  
• The target  rVE of mRNA -1010 to the active comparator is 25% to prevent the first 
episode of RT-PCR confirmed protocol -defined ILI  caused by any influe nza A or B virus 
strains.  
• An attack rate of 2% in the active comparator for the primary endpoint.  
• One IA in the  middle of February 2023 with approximately 75% of total target cases 
expected  across 2 study intervention groups in the PP Set. 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
Protocol mRNA -1010 -P302 Amendment 1  mRNA -1010  
Confidential  Page 65 • A dropout rate ~  10% (not evaluable for  the PP Set). 
• Type I error rate will be adjusted using the Lan-DeMets Pocock  boundary.  
If the IA is conducted exactly at 75% of total target cases, the nominal 1-sided Type I error rate 
will be 2.07% at IA  and 1.2% at final analysis  for NI testing , respectively.  
Once NI is demonstrated, the rVE will be further evaluated for superiority of mRNA -1010 over 
the active comparator. The planned sample size ( 23,000 participants) is expected to generate 
approximately 386 cases  in the mITT Set and  will provide approximately 76% power to support 
the superiority claim with the following assumptions:  
• The target  rVE of mRNA -1010 to the active comparator is 25% to prevent the first 
episode of RT-PCR confirmed protocol -defined ILI  caused by any influenza A or B virus 
strains.  
• An attack rate of 2% in the active comparator for the primary endpoint.  
• An IA in the  middle of February 2023 with  approximately 290 cases expected (75% of 
total target cases) across 2 study intervention groups in the mITT Set (defined  in 
Section  9.4). 
• A dropout rate ~ 4% (not evaluable for the mITT  Set). 
• Type I error rate will be adjusted using the Lan-DeMets Pocock  boundary.  
The total number of cases pertains to the mITT Set accruing at least 14 days after the study 
intervention . If the IA is conducted exactly at 75% of total target cases, the nominal 1-sided 
Type I error rate will be 2.07% at IA and 1.2% at final analysis, respectively.  
The sample size and power calculations  are based on the log -rank tes t for a survival endpoint 
using the EAST software (version 6.5.2).

9.5. Statistical Analyses  
This section is a summary of the pla nned statistical analyses of the primary and secondary 
endpoints.  
The overall Type I error rate for the primary endpoint at the IAs and the final analysis is strictly 
controlled at 2.5% ( 1-sided) based on the Lan -DeMets Pocock  spending function (see 
Secti on 9.6 for details). The primary efficacy results that will be considered statistically 
significant after consideration of the strategy for controlling the Type I error is described in  
Section  9.5.1 . Statistical significance of the primary efficacy endpoint for the primary objective  
can be achieved at either  IA or at the final analysis.  
A sequ ential/hierarchical testing procedure will be used to control Type I error rate over the 
primary efficacy objective ( endpoint ) and secondary efficacy objectives ( endpoints ). Secondary 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
Protocol mRNA -1010 -P302 Amendment 1  mRNA -1010  
Confidential  Page 67 efficacy objectives ( endpoints ) will only be tested at the planned IA or final analysis, whichever 
is applicable, when the primary efficacy endpoint for the primary objective achieves statistical 
significance. In that case, refer Section  9.6.2  for the multiplicity adjustments among the efficacy 
objectives ( endpoints ). 
9.5.1.  Efficacy  Analyses  
Efficacy analyses will be performed using the FAS, mITT  Set, and PP Set, and participants will 
be included in the study intervention  group to which they are randomized.  
9.5.1.1.  Analysis of Prim ary Efficacy Endpoint  
To assess th e efficacy endpoint  for the primary objective , preventing the first occurrence of RT-
PCR confirmed protocol -defined ILI within the period of 14 days post  study interven tion through 
the end of the influenza season , Cox proportional hazards regression model will be used to 
estimate HR . The rVE, ie, 1-HR (mRNA -1010 vs. active comparator ) will be estimated  along 
with the 2-sided 95% CI and 1-sided p-value  for testing H01: rVE ≤ -10%. 
The rVE is defined as the percent reduction in the hazard of the primary endpoint (mRNA -1010 
vs. active comparator)  and will be estimated using 1 -HR estimand. A  stratified  Cox proportional 
hazard model with study intervention group as a fixed ef fect will be used based  on the PP Set to 
estimate the HR (mRNA -1010 vs. active comparator) . The stratification factors at randomization, 
ie, age group (≥ 50 to < 65 years or ≥ 65 years) and influenza vaccine status in the previous 
season (received or not received), will be applied as the strata variables. The Efron's method will 
be used to handl e ties . 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, partic ipants without RT-PCR confirmed  protocol -defined  ILI 
will be censored at the last study assessment date. Potential intercurrent events may include:  
1. Early discontinuation or death unrelated to influenza;  or 
2. Early ILI up to 14 days after study intervention . 
In the estimand of the primary analysis on the primary endpoint, a hypothetical  strategy will be 
used to address the intercurrent events in the primary analysis based on the PP Set. The details 
are presented in Section  11.3. 
Participants without RT -PCR confirmed protocol -defined ILI will be censored at Day  181 
(Month 6) or end of influenza season (whichever occurs later), or at the date o f early 
discontinuation or death unrelated to influenza, whichever is earlier. Participants with early RT -
PCR confirmed protocol -defined ILI up to 14 days after the study vaccination will be censored at 
the start date of the early RT -PCR confirmed protocol -defined ILI  (see Section 11.6 for country -
specific amendment affecting this paragraph . 
The trial will be considered to meet the primary efficacy objective if the p-value  for rejecting 
H01: rVE ≤ -10% is less than  the nominal p-value  based on  the Lan-DeMets Pocock boundaries , 
on the PP Set. The nominal  alpha at the I A and final analysis will be 2.07% at IA and 1.2% at 
final analysis . 
Analyses of the primary endpoint  will be also performed based on the mITT  Set using the same 
methods as described above.   
ModernaTX, Inc.  
Protocol mRNA -1010 -P302 Amendment 1  mRNA -1010  
Confidential  Page 68 To support the primary analysis,  rVE will also be estimated by 1 minus the ratio of incidence 
rates adjusting for person -time, and the 95% CI of  rVE will be computed using the exact method, 
conditional  upon the total number of cases adjusting for person -time.  
In addition, Kaplan Meier curve will be used to plot the estimated cumulative incidence rates 
over time by vaccine  group. Participants without a case for the primary endpoint identified will 
be censored at Day 181/M onth 6 or end of influenza season, whichever ends later . 
Once the noninferiority of mRNA -1010 vs. active comparator is  demonstrated  using the PP Set , 
superiority of mRNA -1010  vs. active comparator  will be evaluated using the same endpoint on 
the mITT Set, either at an IA or at the final analysis.  
9.5.1.2.  Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary efficacy endpoints that are defined in Section  3 will be analyzed in a similar way as 
for the primary efficacy endpoint.  More details can be found in the SAP.  
9.5.2.  Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses will be based on the Safety Set, except summa ries of solicited ARs, which 
will be based on the Solicited Safety Set. All safety analyses will be provided by vaccination 
group.  
9.5.2.1.  Adverse Events  
Safety and reactogenicity will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters, including 
solicited ARs (local and systemic events), unsolicited AEs, SAEs, MAAEs, AESIs, AEs leading 
to discontinuation, vital signs, and physical examination findings.  
Unsolicited AEs will be coded by system organ class and preferred term according to the 
MedDRA terminology. The Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent 
Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials ( DHHS 2007 ) will be used in this 
study.  
The number and percentage of participants with any solici ted local AR, solicited systemic AR, 
and any solicited AR during the 7 -day follow -up period after the study intervention  will be 
summarized. A 2 -sided 95% exact CI using the Clopper -Pearson method will also be provided 
for the percentage of participants wi th any solicited AR for each vaccination group.  
Number and percentage of participants with unsolicited AEs, SAEs, MAAEs, AESIs, severe

9.5.2.2.  Baseline Descriptive Statistics  
Demographic variables ( eg, age, sex, race, and ethnicity)  and baseline characteristics (eg, height, 
weight, and body mass index)  will be summarized by study intervention group in descriptive 
statistics (mean, standard deviation for continuous variable, and number and percentage for 
categorical variables).  
9.5.3.  Immunogenicity Analyses  
The primary analysis population for immunogenicity will be the PP Immunogenicity S ubset, 
unless specified otherwise.  
For each of the 4 strain s, the GMT of HAI titers with correspond ing 95% CI will be provided at 
each timepoint. The 95% CIs will be calculated based on the t-distribution of the log -transformed 
values then back -transformed to the original scale. The GMFR of HAI titers with corresponding 
95% CI at each postbaseline timep oint over baseline will be provided. Descriptive summary 
statistics including median, minimum, and maximum will also be provided.  
An analysis of covariance model will be carried out. The model will include the log -transformed 
HAI titers at Day  29 as the d ependent variable , vaccination group as the fixed variable, 
log-transformed baseline HAI titers as a fixed covariate, and adjusting for the stratification 
factors. The geometric least square mean (GLSM) and its corresponding 95% CI results in 
log-transformed scale estimated from the model will be back -transformed to obtain these 
estimates in the original scale as an estimate of the GMT. GMR, estimated by the ratio of GLSM 
and the corresponding 2 -sided 95% CI will be provided to assess the treatment  difference. The 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
Protocol mRNA -1010 -P302 Amendment 1  mRNA -1010  
Confidential  Page 70 corresponding 2 -sided 95% CI of GMR will be provided to assess the difference in immune 
response between the mRNA -1010 group compared with the active comparator group at Day  29.  
For each strain, seroconversion is defined as either a preva ccination HAI titer <  1:10 and a 
postvaccination titer ≥  1:40 or a prevaccination HAI titer ≥  1:10 and a minimum 4 -fold rise in 
postvaccination HAI antibody titer.  
The number and percentage of participants with seroconversion due to vaccination will be 
provided with 2 -sided 95% CI using the Clopper -Pearson method at Day  29. To compare the 
seroconversion rates between the vaccination groups, the Miettinen -Nurminen’s method will be 
used to calculate the 95% CI for the difference in seroconversion rates. The s eroconversion rate 
difference with the corresponding 95% CI at Day  29 will be provided  for each strain .  
For summarizations of GMTs, antibody titers reported as below the lower limit of 
quantification  (LLOQ) will be replaced by 0.5  × LLOQ. Values that are greater than the upper 
limit of quantification (ULOQ) will be converted to the ULOQ.  
In addition, t he number and percentage of participants with an HAI titer ≥  1:40 postinjection due 
to vaccination will be provided with 2 -sided 95% CI using the Clopper -Pearson method.  
The analyses will be repeated using the Immunogenicity S ubset as a sensitivity analysis.  
9.5.4.  Exploratory Analyses  
Exploratory endpoints evaluating the rVE will be assessed by similar analysis methods as used 
for the analysis of the prim ary efficacy endpoint.  
Analyses of the other exploratory endpoints will be described in the SAP.  
9.5.5.  Subgroup Analyses  
If sufficient case numbers of the primary and key secondary endpoints in a subgroup ( ie, age, 
race, etc.) are available, subgroup analysis m ay be performed.  
9.6. Planned  Analyses   
9.6.1.  Interim Analyses  
There is one  planned IA with data cut -off around the middle of  February 2023 regardless of 
number of influenza cases accrued  for the first null hypothesis to be tested to support  the primary 
objective . The intent  of the IA is for early detection of reliable evidence that  rVE of mRNA -1010 
is noninferior to the active comparator. The Lan-DeMets Pocock boundaries  are used for 
calculating efficacy bound aries and to preserve the ( 1-sided) 2.5% Type I error rate over the IA 
and the final analysis (when the target number of cases have been observed), relative to the 
hypothesis:  
H01: HR ≥ 1.1 (equivalently, rVE ≤ - 10%).  
If NI is demonstrated at an IA, the subsequent final analysis will be considered supportive  in 
nature  for the NI claim . The DSMB will review the IA results and make recommendations to the 
Sponsor in terms of study results reporting and unblinding based on the boundaries of early 
efficacy as described in this section.

±: actual nominal alpha may be adjusted based on the actual information fraction at individual IA(s). 
The study will be considered positive ( rVE has been demonstrate) if the p-value  for rejecting HR 
≥ 1.1 is less than 2.07% based on the Lan-DeMets Pocock alpha spending function , provided that 
the IA is conducted exactly at 75% information fraction . The final analysis will be performed 
when approximately 365 cases have been observed in the PP Set. In the case that the early study 
success is not achieve d, the study will be considered positive at the final analysis if the 1-sided p-
value  for rejecting HR ≤1.1 is less than 1.2%.  
If NI is demonstrated , superiority will be evaluated using  the same endpoint based on  the mITT 
Set, following the test sequence illustrated in Figure  1. Upon successful demonstration of the NI 
claim at the IA,  the second null hypothesis to support the superiority objective  of the primary 
efficacy endpoint , (ie, H02: HR ≥ 1 [equivalently, rVE ≤ 0% ]), will be tested  in the mITT Set. 
The superiority is successful  at the IA  if the  1-sided  P value  for rejecting HR ≥ 1 is less than 
2.07% using  the Lan-DeMets Pocock  alpha spending function.  Otherwise, the superiority test 
will be conducted again at the final analysis, given that the NI claim has been successfully 
demonstrated (either at the IA or final analysis).  The superiority test is successful at the final 
analysis if the 1 -sided P value  for rejecting HR ≥ 1 is less than 1.2% based on  the Lan-DeMets 
Pocock  alpha spending function.  
Approximately 290 cases and 3 86 cases are expected to be  observed  at the IA and t he final 
analysis, respectively,  in the mITT Set . 
9.6.2.  Multiplicity  
To control the overall Type I error for the study, a hierarchical testing strategy will be used to 
test the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints  (Figure  1). 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
Protocol mRNA -1010 -P302 Amendment 1  mRNA -1010  
Confidential  Page 72 Figure  1: Testing Sequence of the Primary and Secondary Endpoints  
 
 
Noninferiority of mRNA -1010 vs. the active comparator on the primary efficacy endpoin t will be 
declared if the p-value  for rejecting HR ≥ 1.1 is less than the nominal p-value  based on the Lan-
DeMets Pocock  approximation spending function , on the PP Set. The nominal  alpha levels ( 1-
sided) are 2.07% at IA and1.2% at the final analysis, respectively , if the IA is conducted when  
75% of total target cases are accumulated across the 2 groups . 
Once the NI criteria is met for the primary efficacy endpoint, superiority of mRNA -1010 relative 
to the active comparator will be tested on the mITT Set. The superiority of  rVE will be 
considered demonstrated if the p-value  for rejecting HR ≥ 1 is less than the nominal p-value  
based on the Lan-DeMets Pocock  approximation spending function, on the mITT  Set. For this 
superiority testing, the nominal 1-sided alpha level will be 2.07% at the planned IA and at 1.2% 

ModernaTX, Inc.  
Protocol mRNA -1010 -P302 Amendment 1  mRNA -1010  
Confidential  Page 73 at final analysis, respectively , if the IA is conducted when  75% of total target cases are 
accumulated across the 2 groups . 
If the above superiority is demonstrated, then the following secondary efficacy endpoints will be 
evaluated  for NI and superiority in the order outlined in  Figure  1 at the final analysis  using 1-
sided 2. 5% Type I error rate : 
• rVE of mRNA -1010 vaccine vs the active comparator against the first episode of RT -
PCR confirmed protocol -defined ILI caused by influenza A or B strains with similarity to 
the vaccine strains . 
• rVE of mRNA -1010 vaccine vs the active comparator against the first episode of RT -
PCR –confirmed protocol -defined ILI caused by influenza A or B antigenically matched 
influenza A or B strains.  
The testing sequence can only continue to the next level only if all tests at the higher level  
achieve statistical significance at the 1-sided 2.5 % alpha level. If a test at the higher level  fails to 
demonstrate statistical significance, then the testing sequence will stop , and all t esting  thereafter 
will not be conducted.  
Analyses of other remaining secondary efficacy endpoints are not controlled for  multiplicity.

11.1.2.  Study Monitoring   
Before an investigational site can enter a participant into the study, a representative of 
ModernaTX, Inc.  or its representatives will perform a remote or onsite visit with the 
investigational study clinic to: 
• Determine the adequacy of the  facilities.  
• Discuss with the Investigator (s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of ModernaTX, Inc.  or its representatives. 
This will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between ModernaTX, Inc. , 
designated CRO, and the Investigator.  
According to ICH GCP guideline, the Sponsor  of the study is responsible for ensuring the proper 
conduct of the study with regard to protocol adherence and validity of data recorded on the 
eCRFs. The stud y monitor’s duties are to aid the Investigator  and ModernaTX, Inc.  in the 
maintenance of complete, accurate, legible, well -organized, and easily retrievable data. The 
study monitor will advise the Investigator  of the regulatory necessity for study -related 
ModernaTX, Inc.

Confidential  Page 78 monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC  review, and inspection by providing direct access to the source 
data/documents. In addition, the study monitor will explain to and interpret for the Investigator  
all regulations app licable to the clinical evaluation of a  study intervention as documented in ICH 
guidelines.  
It is the study monitor’s responsibility to inspect the eCRFs and source documentation 
throughout the study to protect the rights of the participants; to verify adh erence to the protocol; 
to verify completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and to confirm adherence of study 
conduct to any local regulations. Details will be outlined in the clinical monitoring plan. During 
the study, a monitor from ModernaTX,  Inc. or a representative will have regular contacts with 
the investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the Investigator (s). 
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable.  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to t he protocol, that the data are being 
accurately recorded in the  eCRFs, and that study intervention  accountability checks are 
being performed.  
• Perform source data verification.  This includes a comparison of the data in the eCRFs 
with the participant’s medic al records at the hospital or practice, and other records 
relevant to the study.  This will require direct access to all original records for each 
participant (eg, clinical charts  or electronic medical record system ). 
• Record and report any protocol deviatio ns not previously sent . 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm any 
SAEs have been forwarded to  the SAE Hotline , and those SAEs that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB /IEC .

Samples may be used for purposes related to this research.  The Sponsor may store samples for 
the time frame specified in the ICF to achieve study objectives. In addition, identifiable samples 
can be destroyed at any time at the request of the participant.  
These samples could be used to address further scientific questions related to mRNA -1010 or 
anti respiratory virus immune respons e, to research the complications associated with influenza 
and other conditions for which individuals with influenza are at increased risk, and to improve 
treatment. During the study or during the retention period, in addition to the analysis outlined in 
the study endpoints, exploratory analysis may be conducted using other measures of adaptive 
immunity to seasonal influenza to include humoral and cellular immune assay methodologies on 
any remaining blood or serum samples, including samples from participant s who are screened 
but are not subsequently enrolled. A decision to perform such exploratory research may arise 
from new scientific findings related to the drug/vaccine class or disease, as well as reagent and 
assay availability .

Definitions: Woman of Childbearing Potential ( WOCBP)  
Women in the following categories are considered WOCBP (fertile):  
1. Following menarche  
2. From the time of menarche until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile 
(see below).  
• A postmenopausal state  is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause.  
o A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH)  level in the postmenopausal range may be 
used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception 
or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of 
amenorrhea, confirmation with more than one FSH measur ement is required.  
o Females  on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one 
of the nonestrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to 
continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.  
• Permanent sterilization  methods (for the purpose of this study) include:  
o Documented hysterectomy  
o Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
o Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
o Documented tubal ligation  
o For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than 
the above,  (eg, Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity, gonadal dysgenesis), 
Investigator  discretion should be applied to determining study entry.  
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• If fertility  is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle 
cannot be confirm ed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should 
be considered.  
Contraception Guidance:  
Adequate female contraception is defined as consistent and correct use of a regulatory 
agency -approved contraceptive method  in accordance with the product label  (see Section 
11.6 for country -specific amendment affecting this section) . For example:  
• Barrier method (such as condoms, diaphragm, or cervical ca p) 
• Intrauterine device  
• Prescription hormonal contraceptive taken or administered via oral (pill), transdermal 
(patch), subdermal, or IM route

study  
Note: periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  The above applies to females of 
child -bearing potential who are sexually active with male partners  and not to females with same  
sex partners or those who are not sexually active  as their usual lifestyle .

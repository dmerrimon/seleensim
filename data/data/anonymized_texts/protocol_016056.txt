1. Modification
Summary of the Modification Request
We have a simple modification: changing the verbal memory test that we are using as our screening tool. We
 proposed using the California Verbal Learning Test, Second Edition (CVLT-II). We want to change this to the Rey
 Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). Both are published validated memory instruments. (We have gone through
 the protocol and changed the CVLT-II to the RAVLT. This is the only change we made.)
Justification for the Modification
We believe the RAVLT will be more sensitive to memory deficits than the CVLT-II, as the normative data for the
 RAVLT is more appropriate for our sample (better matched for level of education).
This Modification Changes
 the Consent Document or
 Information that May Affect
 Subjects’ Willingness to Continue
 to Participate in the ResearchNo
Subjects Will Be Re-Consented or
 Provided with the New InformationNo
Explanation Why Re-Consenting or Providing Subjects with the New Information is Not Necessary
This is a very minor change, which does not affect the consent form or patient burden (time or effort).

Protocol Title
Phase Two Randomized Controlled Crossover Trial of Atomoxetine to Treat Memory Impairment due to Multiple
 Sclerosis
Principal Investigator James Sumowski
Primary Department Neurology
Application Initiated By James Sumowski
Lay Summary
Approximately half of persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) develop memory dysfunction, which makes it difficult to
 maintain gainful employment, manage a household, and lead a fully-engaged social life. There are currently no
 validated symptomatic treatments for memory deficits in persons with MS. We will perform a pilot fourteen-week
 double-blind cross-over phase-two randomized controlled trial (RCT) of atomoxetine (80mg qd) versus placebo to
 improve memory in MS patients with documented memory impairment. Atomoxetine is a non-stimulant selective
 norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor FDA-approved to treat cognitive-behavioral symptoms of attention deficit /
 hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; Strattera, Eli Lilly). Pre-clinical evidence suggests that atomoxetine may also improve
 memory by targeting brain mechanisms responsible for memory function (norepinephrine in the hippocampus).
 Twenty-four MS patients demonstrating objective memory impairment on neuropsychological screening tests will
 be randomly assigned to once-daily orally-administered atomoxetine or identically-encapsulated placebo for the
 first phase, followed by a two-week washout period, and then six weeks of the cross-over condition. The RCT
 will be performed at the Corinne Goldsmith Dickinson Center for MS at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount
 Sinai. Baseline and follow-up evaluations will assess change on Primary Outcomes (objective memory function on
 neuropsychological tests and patient-reported memory change) and Secondary Outcomes (additional objective
 and self-reported memory measures; objective and self-reported cognitive efficiency measures; fatigue and mood).
 We predict that atomoxetine will lead to significantly greater improvements in Primary and Secondary memory
 outcomes relative to placebo. Consistent with the ADHD literature, there may be additional effects of atomoxetine
 versus placebo on Secondary cognitive efficiency outcomes. Results of this trial will inform decisions / planning for a
 possible phase 3 trial, which may ultimately support the use of non-stimulant, once-daily atomoxetine as a memory
 treatment option for MS patients.

4. Summary - Background
Objectives
1. Investigate whether treatment with atomoxetine (versus placebo) improves (a) memory on objective cognitive tasks
 and (b) patient-reported memory in MS patients with documented memory impairment.
2. Investigate whether atomoxetine (versus placebo) also has beneficial effects on (a) cognitive efficiency on
 objective cognitive tasks, (b) patient-reported attention/organization, and (c) fatigue and mood.
Background
Memory Impairment in Multiple Sclerosis: Most persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) are diagnosed between ages
 20 and 40,[1] while they are striving to finish education, establish careers, and manage households. About half of
 MS patients will suffer memory decline,[2-4] which begins early in the disease[4,5] and negatively impacts quality
 of life (e.g., unemployment).[3,6] Despite the high prevalence and debilitating consequences of memory decline in
 MS patients, there are currently no validated symptomatic memory treatments.[7-9] We have reported preliminary
 support for levo-amphetamine (l-AMP) as an effective memory treatment in MS, with memory-impaired patients
 showing a 50% improvement on objective memory tasks relative to placebo,[10] with no effects on processing
 speed.[11] It is instructive that l-AMP, classified as a stimulant, improved memory rather than speed. Although both
 stimulants, l-AMP and dextro-amphetamine (d-AMP, prescribed for ADHD) have different mechanisms of action: d-
AMP works on dopaminergic targets in the frontal lobe (e.g., striatum) to increase attention, whereas l-AMP targets
 norepinephrine pathways, with a greater impact on hippocampal structure and memory in rodents.[12] Unfortunately,
 l-AMP is not FDA-approved for any indication, and there is no industry support to perform the necessary phase
 3 trials required for FDA approval. As such, l-AMP is not a viable option for treatment of MS memory impairment;
 however, the aforementioned preliminary data on l-AMP and memory provide critical guidance toward an even more
 promising non-stimulant option: atomoxetine.
Atomoxetine and Memory: Atomoxetine (Strattera, Eli Lilly) is a non-stimulant selective norepinephrine reuptake
 inhibitor FDA-approved for treatment of ADHD.[13] Neuropharmacologically, atomoxetine leads to increased
 norepinephrine in the cortex and hippocampus, without increases in dopamine within the striatum or nucleus
 accumbens,[14,15] which explains reduced risk of locomotor activation and addiction / abuse when using
 atomoxetine versus stimulant medication (e.g., methylphenidate, for review[16]). Clinical trials in ADHD have
 understandably focused on outcomes of inattention and hyperactivity; however, positive effects of atomoxetine on
 visual memory have also been reported,[17] consistent with (a) positive effects on memory in rodents,[18] (b) the
 importance of norepinephrine for memory generally,[19] and (c) human cerebral blood flow evidence showing that
 atomoxetine differentially increases mesial temporal blood flow relative to placebo and methylphenidate.[20] 
Atomoxetine as a Memory Treatment in MS: MS patients experience hippocampal atrophy beginning early in the
 disease,[21-23] histological studies document substantial hippocampal demyelination and synaptic loss,[24-26]
 and work from our group and others has linked MS memory deficits with hippocampal structure and function (e.g.,
[21,27-30]). Consistent with aforementioned roles of atomoxetine on hippocampal norepinephrine and memory,
 and preliminary effects of l-AMP on memory in MS[10]  (likely via norepinephrine[12]), there is adequate evidence
 to support a pilot clinical trial of norepinephrine reuptake inhibition with atomoxetine as a potential symptomatic
 treatment of memory impairment in MS. An important practical consideration supporting this proposal is that
 atomoxetine is already FDA-approved, so the path to clinical use for memory impairment in MS patients is more
 straightforward. Finally, there are important physiological, psychological, and regulatory barriers to stimulant
 medication use, which are circumvented by use of the non-stimulant atomoxetine.

Primary and Secondary Study Endpoints
PRIMARY ENDPOINTS:
1. Memory will be assessed as a mean normative z-score across verbal and spatial memory tasks: (a) Selective
 Reminding Test (SRT) Total Learning, (b) SRT Delayed Recall, (c) Brief Visuospatial Memory Test, Revised (BVMT-
R) Total Learning, (d) BVMT-R Delayed Recall. Memory will be measured at three points: Baseline (day prior to
 phase one [treatment or placebo]), Treatment Follow-Up (last day of atomoxetine), and Placebo Follow-up (last day
 of placebo). (These will be known as phase one and phase two follow-ups initially, as treatment or placebo will only
 be revealed after the study is complete.) Alternate forms of the tests will be used. 
2. Patient-Reported Memory Change: Patients will endorse global memory change over the past month as: much
 improved (3), improved (2), slightly improved (1), unchanged (0), slightly worse (-1), worse (-2), much worse (-3).
 This will occur twice: at the phase one and phase two follow-ups.
SECONDARY ENDPOINTS:
1. At the same three time points above (baseline, phase one follow-up, phase two follow-up), we will administer two
 additional memory tasks: 
(a) CANTAB Paired Associate Learning (PAL, Total Errors Adjusted); (b) NIH Toolbox Picture Sequence Memory
 Test (PSMT; raw score).
2. Patient-Reported Memory Change: The Perceived Deficits Questionnaire (PDQ) will be administrated at the same
 three time points. Retrospective Memory and Prospective Memory subscales will be derived at each time point.
3. At the same three time points, we will measure performance on four cognitive efficiency tasks assessing
 processing speed (Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Oral Version: Total Correct), sustained attention/continuous
 performance (CANTAB Rapid Visual Information Processing: RVP A'), reading comprehension speed (Woodcock
 Johnson Reading Fluency), and working memory (WAIS-IV Digit Span: total raw score). 
4. Patient Reported Outcomes of (a) cognitive efficiency assessed with Attention and Planning/Organization
 subscales of the PDQ; (b) fatigue assessed with the Fatigue Severity Scale; (c) mood assessed with the Beck
 Depression Inventory Fast Screen, and (d) suicidal ideation with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale.

How Participants Will Be Identified
Patients meeting inclusion criteria for age and MS diagnosis will be as asked by their treating physician, nurse
 practitioner, or neuropsychologist if they would be interested in hearing more about the study.  If the patient is
 interested in participating and reports subjective difficulty with memory, a member of the research team will either
 speak with them in person, or they will be asked if they want to be contacted by a member of the research team at
 another time, or they will be given contact information for a member of the research team.  If the patient is interested
 and would prefer to be contacted, the clinician will provide us with the name and best way to contact them. We also
 have a list of patients who have asked us to contact them if we have any enrolling research studies.  We will contact
 those patients at their preferred contact.  
Who Will Initially Approach
 Potential ParticipantsMember of Primary Care Team, Treating
 Physician
How Research Will Be Introduced to Participants
Patients will be asked by their physician, nurse practitioner, or neuropsychologist if they are interested in learning
 about a placebo-controlled RCT of a drug aiming to improve disease-related memory decline. Patients will be told
 that atomoxetine is a non-stimulant drug FDA-approved to treat ADHD, but that the use of atomoxetine to treat
 memory deficits is not an approved use of the drug. Patients will be told that it is a cross-over design, and that they
 will receive atomoxetine during one phase, and placebo during the other, but that he/she will not be blinded to phase.
 If they are interested, patients will be referred to the study personnel as noted above.
How Participants Will Be Screened
Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed with patients via telephone or in-person screening with study
 personnel.  Patients who report memory difficulties and meet demographic eligibility criteria will be invited to the
 MS Center for a brief twenty-minute in-person screening. After informed consent, the screening will include two
 memory screening tests (RAVLT, WMS-IV Visual Reproduction), a word-reading estimate of premorbid IQ (WTAR),
 a depression screening tool (BDI-FS), and an assessment of suicidal ideation with the past six months (Columbia
 Suicide Severity Rating Scale). Demographic (e.g., age) and medical (e.g., last relapse) will be reviewed with the
 patient and/or their medical record. All current medications will be recorded, and Co-I Ilana Katz Sand, M.D. will
 review for possible interactions with atomoxetine.

10. Procedures - Narrative
Description of the Study Design
This is a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled cross-over design whereby each of 24 enrolled MS patients
 (meeting inclusion criteria / screening) will complete the following:
1. Baseline Evaluation (neuropsychological, psychological, self-report, and motor assessment; about 1 hour).
2. Phase One Drug: Six weeks of treatment with atomoxetine or placebo (randomly assigned)
3. Phase One Evaluation: baseline evaluation repeated on the last day of phase one.
4. Two week washout period
5. Phase Two Drug: Six weeks of opposite condition as phase one (i.e., if atomoxetine in phase one, then placebo in
 phase two)
6. Phase Two Evaluation: baseline evaluation repeated on the last day of phase one.
Description of Procedures Being Performed
After informed consent, subjects will engage in a 30-minute screening consisting of memory tests (Rey Auditory
 Verbal Learning Test, Visual Reproduction of the Wechsler Memory Scale, Fourth Edition), word-reading test
 (Weschler Test of Adult Reading), depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory, Fast Screen), and assessment
 of suicidal ideation within the past twelve months (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale). 
Patients who meet all inclusion criteria will advance to the fourteen week crossover trial.
1. Baseline Evaluation: 
a. Memory Tests: Selective Reminding Test, Brief Visuospatial Memory Test, Revised, CANTAB Paired Associate
 Learning, NIH Toolbox Picture Sequence Memory Test (PSMT)
b. Cognitive Efficiency Tests: Symbol Digit Modalities Test, CANTAB Rapid Visual Information Processing, Woodcock
 Johnson Reading Fluency, WAIS-IV Digit Span
c. Questionnaires: Perceived Deficits Questionnaire (self-report of cognitive/memory deficits), Beck Depression
 Inventory, Fast Screen (mood), Fatigue Severity Scale (fatigue), Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (suicidal
 ideation)
d. Motor Tasks: 25-foot walk, Nine Hole Peg Test
2. Phase One Drug:
Patients will receive atomoxetine or identically encapsulated placebo from the research pharmacy. They will receive
 two containers: one containing seven 40mg capsules, and one containing enough 80mg capsules for the remaining
 five weeks. Subjects will be instructed to take the 40mg dose once per day (in the morning) for the first seven
 days, and then switch to the 80mg dose once per day (in the morning) for the remainder of Phase One. Subjects
 will be encouraged to set an alert in their smartphones to remind them to take the capsule at the same time each
 day. Subjects will also be provided with information about atomoxetine (Strattera) provided by the pharmaceutical
 company (Eli Lilly). Patients will be instructed not to take more than one capsule per day. If they miss a dose,
 they should keep it in the container. All remaining capsules will be returned to the investigator at the end of the six
 weeks (when the subject returns for the first follow-up). Patients will also be instructed to contact the study team
 immediately if they experience any side effects.
3. Phase One Evaluation: The baseline evaluation will be repeated on the last day of Phase One. Alternate forms
 will be used as appropriate. In addition, patients will be asked to guess which type of capsule they were tasking, and
 also complete an additional questionnaire: 
Patient-Reported Memory Change: Patients will endorse global memory change over the past month as: much
 improved (3), somewhat improved (2), mildly improved (1), unchanged (0), mildly worse (-1), somewhat worse (-2),
 much worse (-3). 
4. Two week washout period.
Patients will go two weeks without taking any study capsule.
5. Phase Two Drug
The same procedures as Phase One will be followed, except that patients will receive the opposite capsules as
 Phase One.
6. Phase Two Evaluation
The same procedures as the Phase One Evaluation will be repeated. 
Description of the Source Records that Will Be Used to Collect Data About Subjects 
Paper source records will include demographic information, general medical history, and MS medical history
 information; however, there will be no PHI on any source forms. All data will be collected using paper
 neuropsychological record forms and/or score sheets. CANTAB tasks are performed on an iPad; however, no PHI
 will be entered into the iPad. Instead, CANTAB scores will be transferred to paper score sheets. All data will be
 entered into a RedCap database, which will include no PHI.
Description of Data that Will Be Collected Including Long-Term Follow-Up
This is documented above.

18. Data - HIPAA
Obtaining HIPAA Authorization Yes
How PHI Will Be Protected from Improper Use or Disclosure
Study data will include no direct identifiers, and a unique number assigned to each patient. Study data will be kept in
 a locked filing cabinet in the PI's office, and kept separate from the subjects' signed consent forms (also in a locked
 cabinet). A list of subject-number pairings will also be in a locked filing cabinet, and only the PI and the study team
 will be assess to these cabinets. 
PHI Will Be Destroyed at the
 Earliest Opportunity Consistent
 with the ResearchYes
When and How PHI Will Be Destroyed 
PHI will be destroyed at the completion of the study by shredding documents with PHI, which are otherwise in locked
 filing cabinets.  The key linking the study data (in RedCap) to PHI (e.g., consent forms) will be destroyed at the end
 of the study, so that PHI (and patient identities) cannot be linked back to the study data. Only the de-identified study
 data will be needed for publication. Signed consent forms with HIPPA waivers (unlinked to data) will be kept for six
 years following completion of the study, and then destroyed via shredding.
PHI Will Be Shared No
  PI must attest to the following.
  * I assure that the protected health information (PHI) will not be disclosed to any other
 person or entity not listed on this form except where required by law or for the authorized
 oversight of this research project. If at any time I want to reuse this PHI for other purposes
 or disclose it to other individuals or entities I will seek approval from the IRB.

Duration Data Will Be Stored
Raw data will be stored for three years following completion of the study. Non-identifiable data in the form of a
 database (RedCap) will be kept indefinitely. 
Steps That Will Be Taken to Secure the Data During Storage, Use, and Transmission
Data will be stored in a locked filing cabinet located in a locked closet, within a locked office (PI: JF Sumowski).
 Each lock has a separate key. Only two persons have the key to the filing cabinet: JF Sumowski (PI) and the study
 research coordinators. Data files will be kept separate from identifiable data (PHI), with the exception of a password
 protected and encrypted Excel file linking subject names and subject numbers. This file will be located on a ISMMS
 network drive and only accessed from ISMMS computers. Only JF Sumowski and the coordinators will have the
 password. Raw data files may be retrieved by JF Sumowski or the research coordinator, and viewed on site in a
 private office space. Files will not be removed from Mount Sinai Hospital. Files will be immediately returned to their
 secure location within the filing cabinet. 
Power Analysis/Data Analysis Plan (Including Any Statistical Procedures)
JF Sumowski will lead statistical analyses, which will consist of dependent T-tests comparing differences in outcomes
 (e.g., memory composite score) between the drug and placebo phases of the cross-over trial.

20. Data - Safety Monitoring
More Than the Minimum Data
 Safety Monitoring Will Be DoneYes
Principal Monitor Ilana Katz Sand
Additional Monitors
Specific Items That Will Be Monitored for Safety
Suicidal ideation will be monitored with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Subjects who report suicidal
 ideation at any point in the study will be escorted to the psychiatric emergency department at Mount Sinai Hospital
 for further evaluation. 
Suicidal ideation and other adverse events reported by patients will be recorded. Co-I Ilana Katz Sand, M.D. will
 review all adverse events as they are reported, and judge severity. Dr. Katz Sand is not involved in data collection or
 processing, so she can be unblinded to identify whether adverse events occurred during atomoxetine or placebo. 
Frequency of Data Review
Suicidal ideation will be evaluated at baseline, first follow-up, and second follow-up for all subjects, and immediate
 action will be taken if suicidal ideation is present (as noted above).
Dr. Katz Sand will also be told immediately of any other serious adverse events, such as allergy to atomoxetine. She
 will have access to condition assignments in the case of adverse events.
Rules for Alteration of Study Design
After twelve subjects have been completed the trial, Dr. Katz Sand will evaluate whether serious adverse events are
 more likely during atomoxetine or placebo. If serious adverse events are 2:1 more likely during atomoxetine, the
 study will be halted. 
Selection Procedures to Minimize Toxicity
We are using the recommended dosage of atomoxetine based on prescribing information in the package insert. Also,
 we are excluding patients taking strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine), which minimizes
 risk of toxicity.
Grading System to Evaluate Adverse Events
Serious adverse events will include suicidal ideation and allergy to atomoxetine.
Other adverse events include constipation, upset stomach, difficulty sleeping, dry mouth, loss of appetite, irregular
 periods, decrease in sexual function, urinary hesitancy sweating, and dizziness.
Procedures to Assure Data Accuracy
All adverse events reported to the research team at any time in the study (including the three assessment phases)
 will be recorded for frequency and severity. Severity will be judged my our study physician, Ilana Katz Sand, M.D.
 These will be documented in a study RedCap database, and will be reported for each condition (atomoxetine,
 placebo) with the study results. Dr. Katz Sand will also be able to determine subject condition in the event of serious
 adverse events.
Suspension Reported to
Suspension would be reported the the IRB.
Anticipated Circumstances of Subject Withdrawal
Subjects would be withdrawn from the study if they experience any severe adverse events. Of course, subjects may
 choose to withdraw at any time without penalty.
Primary or Secondary Safety Endpoints
Primary safety outcome will be suicidal ideation.
Secondary safety endpoints include constipation, upset stomach, difficulty sleeping, dry mouth, loss of appetite,
 irregular periods, decrease in sexual function, urinary hesitancy sweating, dizziness, and allergy to atomoxetine.

Version 2.0, 08Jul19 Page 3 of 36 Protocol Summary
 
Study Design: This is a prospective, randomized, open-label study to evaluate 
effectiveness of applying financial and social incentives via a smartphone-based app in helping participants achieve adherence 
to therapy. Randomization will consist of an allocation ratio of 2:1 
(control:treatment)  
This study will be conducted on patients with obstructive sleep 
apnea (OSA) who have been prescribed ResMed flow generator 
for positive airway pressure (PAP). 
Participants will be randomized to one of two groups: control or 
intervention with Wellth app, “Restful”. The study comprises up to 2 
participant contacts by phone, and 3 data collection timepoints. The first contact involves consenting and enrolling the participant, 
providing instructions based on the arm they are randomized to, 
and collecting baseline data including questionnaires. Those 
randomized to the intervention group will have a second contact, 
which involves onboarding to Restful. A second administration of 
the questionnaires will occur at +90 days from baseline.  
Intervention: Restful by Wellth. The intervention is use of the Restful app, 
which provides a small daily financial reward for achieving therapy 
usage goals and social support. The app will also send a daily reminder to participants to use their therapy. There is no clinical 
treatment intervention, as all patients included in this trial will be 
receiving PAP therapy per standard of care. 
Objectives: Evaluate whether a digitally delivered monetary and social reward scheme can increase 90-day adherence and/or increase average 
minutes of therapy usage over time. Therapy usage will be 
monitored using cloud-based technology in which data from each PAP device is automatically transmitted to a secure, HIPAA-
compliant system (AirView). 
Enrollment: Up to 300 participants 
Clinical Site(s): 1 - 2 sites 
Patient Population: The intended population for the study are patients with a new diagnosis of OSA who have been prescribed a ResMed flow 
generator compatible with AirView. Participants will be recruited 
from the site’s database.   
Endpoint:
 Adherence to therapy (average hours per day) at 90-days 
Protocol #SLP-18-08-01 Project Dahlia Confidential
Version 2.0, 08Jul19 Page 4 of 36 Duration of study: Each participant is expected to participate in the study for at least 
90 days following enrollment. Enrollment completion is expected 
within 16 weeks of enrollment initiation. Participants’ usage data 
will also be collected at 180 days following enrollment.

1 INTRODUCTION  
 
Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a condition characterized by the partial or complete 
collapse of the upper airway during sleep. OSA comprises a continuous spectrum of severity ranging from simple snoring and upper airway resistance through mild to severe 
symptomatic obstructive hypopnea and apnea. The prevalence of sleep disordered 
breathing in the adult population is 24% males and 9% for females
1. The prevalence of 
symptomatic OSA in the adult population has been estimated to be 4% in males and 2% 
in females1. These patients demonstrate behavioral and neuropsychological 
consequences to varying degrees, including ex cessive daytime sleepiness, intellectual 
deterioration and depression2. More serious consequences include arterial systemic 
hypertension, arterial pulmonary hypertension and heart disease3.   
The treatment of choice for OSA is Positive Airway Pressure (PAP). PAP acts as a 
positive airway splint, delivering a fixed positiv e airway pressure to the upper airway via a 
tube and mask. Humidification is used during PAP therapy to improve comfort of the 
delivered air and alleviate nasal dryness/congestion.  
Although PAP therapy is the gold standard treatment for OSA, adherence to treatment is 
often poor. CMS guidelines define adherence as 4 or more hours per night of therapy use 
on 70% of nights during a consecutive 30-day window within the first 90 days of setup4. 
Anywhere from 30 to 85% of patients will be non-adherent according to this definition of 
adherence, which can be explained, in part, by factors such as socioeconomic status, 
age, gender, severity of presenting symptoms, health values/beliefs, and social support5. 
Importantly, patients who immediately adopt therapy, within the first 3 days, are 
significantly more likely to be adherent at 30 days6, and patients’ usage at 1 month is 
significantly predictive of adherence at 1 year7 . Without sustained, long-term therapy 
adherence, patients are at risk of negative health outcomes including but not limited to 
cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and depression. This study tests whether a 
combined financial plus social incentive can help users new become adherent to PAP 
therapy. 
Financial incentive schemes have demonstrat ed effectiveness in a wide range of behavior 
change efforts including physical activity8, smoking cessation9, glucose monitoring10, 
weight loss11, and medication adherence12. The primary mechanisms of action explaining 
the observed behavior change are loss aversion and timely reinforcement. Humans are 
strongly influenced by loss aversion, also k nown as the endowment effect, whereby the 
threat of losing something that has been endowed is a stronger motivator than the 
potential reward of gaining something not currently possessed. Timely reinforcement is 
also key, given that in order for learning to occur, the behavioral action and the 
subsequent reinforcement for doing said action must be closely coupled in time - otherwise it is difficult to associate the behavior with the reward.  
Additionally, there is an abundance of evidence t hat social support is a critical component 
to successful health behavior change
13; however, the specific test of social support 
Protocol #SLP-18-08-01 Project Dahlia  Confidential  
Version 2.0, 08Jul19  Page 7 of 36 
 provision in this project is novel. Social currency (e.g., pictures, video) will be delivered to 
the participant at intervals (e.g., after a participan t hits a streak of therapy use), as well as 
a weekly summary report of therapy use. Testing the social component is especially 
intriguing as this is a long-term cost-effective and scalable solution. 
 
2 OBJECTIVES  
 
Evaluate whether a digitally delivered monetary and social reward scheme can increase 
therapy usage and 90-day adherence. Adherence will be monitored using cloud-based 
technology in which data from each PAP device is  automatically transmitted to a secure, 
HIPAA-compliant system (AirView). 
 
3 METHODS AND MATERIALS 
3.1 POPULATION/PARTICIPANT SELECTION 
The intended population for the study are patients with a new diagnosis of OSA who have 
been prescribed a ResMed flow generator compatible with AirView. Participants will be 
recruited from the site’s database. 
Enrollment period for all participants is projected to be 16 weeks after IRB approval and 
enrollment commencement. 
3.2 STUDY DESIGN 
This is a prospective, randomized, two-arm, open-label study to evaluate effectiveness of applying financial and social incentives via a smartphone-based app in helping 
participants achieve adherence to therapy. Randomization will include an allocation ratio 
of 2:1 (control:treatment). 
Two ‘site to participant’ contacts are required during this study. These contacts can either 
occur at the clinical site or remotely (e.g., by telephone). During the initial contact, their 
interest in the study and eligibility will be c onfirmed, then they will be consented, asked to 
complete the Baseline Questionnaire, and their demographic information will be collected 
on case report forms (CRFs).  
Participants randomized to the intervention (Group B) will be provided with information 
and assistance in downloading Restful to thei r smartphone and registering with Wellth.  
At the final contact (90 days), the participant will be asked to complete an End of Study 
Questionnaire and the investigative staff will collect PAP therapy data for the trial period 
and record it on CRFs. Participants in Group B will have access to the Restful app 
discontinued. This completes the participant’s active participation in the study. 
Protocol #SLP-18-08-01 Project Dahlia  Confidential  
Version 2.0, 08Jul19  Page 8 of 36 
 Daily usage data from AirView will be collected  and transmitted electronically from usage 
initiation to 90 days, and then through 180 days. 
Study data will be captured on CRFs. See Appendix A  for the Baseline and End of 
Study Questionnaires.   See Appendix B  for Participant Instructions  related to the 
study procedures and the Restful app. 
3.3 NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS  
Up to 200 participants will be enrolled in the control arm and up to 100 participants will be 
enrolled in the treatment arm for a total of up to 300 participants enrolled in the study. 
3.4 INCLUSION CRITERIA  
All Participants enrolled into the study must meet the following criteria for entry:  
• Adult participants ( ≥18 years of age)  
• New diagnosis of OSA 
• Prescribed CPAP or APAP for treatment of OSA 
• Prescribed a ResMed flow generator compatible with AirView 
• Owns a smart phone and is willing to download an app on their phone 
• Willing and able to give informed consent 
• Can read and comprehend written and spoken English 
3.5 EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
The participant will be excluded from entry if any of the following criteria apply: 
• Have used PAP therapy in the past 
• Have been prescribed bi-level or adaptive servo-ventilation therapy 
• Are participating in another app-based research study 
• Cannot participate for the full duration of the study (at least 90 days) 
• Participants who have a medical history or concurrent illness that the investigator 
considers sufficiently serious to interfere with the conduct, completion, or results of 
this study, or constitutes an unacceptable risk to the participant for the duration of 
the study 
3.6 SAMPLE SIZE    
N= 300  
 
A minimum total sample size of 270 patients, with 2:1 randomization (180 in Control 
group, 90 in Test group) is required to yield an 80% probability of detecting a difference of 
0.8 hours in mean usage (160% of the minimally clinically significant difference) when the 
standard deviation is 2.5 and 2.0 in the Control and Test groups, respectively.  The 
required sample size was calculated in the Two Sample T-Tests Assuming Unequal 
Variances Procedure using NCSS Power Analysis Statistical Software, Version 16 (PASS 16
14) based on a one-sided, two sample t-test, using a significance level of 0.025.  
Protocol #SLP-18-08-01 Project Dahlia  Confidential  
Version 2.0, 08Jul19  Page 9 of 36 
 Assuming a potential 10% drop-out rate due to study withdrawal or lost-to-follow-up, the 
final sample size will be 300 patients (270/0.9), equating to 200 in the Control group and 
100 in the Test Group. The 2:1 randomization ratio was chosen because it is more cost-
effective to enroll subjects in the control group. 
3.7 STUDY ENDPOINTS 
Primary Endpoint :  mean PAP usage at 90 days colle cted from participants’ flow 
generators 
 
Secondary Endpoints :   
• Percentage of participants that meet the Medicare compliance standard (at least 4 
hours per day on at least 70% of the days in a consecutive 30-day period any time 
in the first 90 days of therapy) 
• Change in ESS and FOSQ-10 questionnaire scores 
• Baseline scores of perceived disease se verity, claustrophobia, coping skills, and 
health literacy as moderators of the intervention’s effectiveness 
3.8 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS 
Randomized Population :  all participants enrolled and randomized to treatment groups. 
 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population : all participants randomized to control or intervention 
group, regardless of the actual intervention received.  Evaluable Population :  all ITT subjects who complete the 90-day study period and 
complete the end-of-study questionnaire. 
3.9 DATA ANALYSIS 
Baseline demographic and psychosocial factors will be summarized for each randomized 
group for ITT and Evaluable Populations. For continuous variables, such as age and PAP 
usage, the mean, standard deviation, median, and range will be presented. For 
categorical variables, such as gender, the number and proportion of participants in each 
category will be presented.  Baseline demographics and psychosocial factors for the 
control and intervention groups will be compared with t-tests and Fisher’s exact tests, as 
appropriate.  
The primary analysis compares mean PAP usage at 90 days in the control and 
intervention groups using a two-way ANOVA on the ITT population.  Randomization group 
and myAir usage (Yes/No) will be included as factors in the model.  The interaction of the 
two factors will be considered, but will only be reta ined in the model if it is significant at the 
5% level.  Missing usage hours during a day will be imputed as 0 usage.  A secondary 
analysis of mean PAP usage will be conducted using the Evaluable Population.  A 
sensitivity analysis of the missing data assumption will be conducted by considering 
missing data as missing.  In this analysis, participants with no usage data will be assumed to have a mean usage of 0 hours; other participa nts’ mean usage will be calculated as the 
mean usage across nights for which there is data. 
 
Protocol #SLP-18-08-01 Project Dahlia  Confidential  
Version 2.0, 08Jul19  Page 10 of 36 
 A subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint will be generated for patients who are 
identified as strugglers.   A struggler is defined as a patient who uses their device for less 
than or equal to 3.5 hours/night during the first 3 days of usage.  Mean PAP usage at 90 
days will be compared in the control and inte rvention groups using a two-way ANOVA on 
the struggler population as described above.  Descriptive statistics will also be presented 
for mean PAP usage, comparing strugglers and non-strugglers in control and intervention 
groups. 
 
Adherence will be calculated for the ITT population from daily usage data using the 
Medicare definition for adherence (a patient is adherent if they use the device for more than 4 hours per night for 70% of the nights during the first 90 days of usage).  Percent 
adherence will be compared between control and intervention groups using a logistic 
regression model on the ITT population.  Randomization group, myAir usage, and the 
interaction of these two factors will be included in the model.  Missing usage hours during 
a day will be imputed as 0 usage.   
 
Mean change in ESS and FOSQ questionnaire scales will be compared between control 
and intervention groups using a mixed-effects linear model on the ITT population and a 
two-sample t-test on the Evaluable population. In the mixed-effects model, the response 
variable will be the mean questionnaire score and the model will include randomized 
group, visit, and a randomized group by visit interaction as fixed effects and subject as a 
random effect.  
 
Baseline perceived disease severity, claustrophobia, coping skills, and health literacy will 
be tested as moderators of the intervention’s effectiveness. Baseline scores will be 
regressed on the primary outcome (usage), and then in a mixed-effects model, the response variable will be usage and the model will include baseline score, randomized 
group, and a randomized group by baseline score interaction as fixed effects and subject 
as a random effect. 
 
An exploratory analysis will examine how engagement with the study is associated with 
PAP usage.  Engagement will be measured as app usage (number of touches).  A linear 
regression model with PAP usage as the dependent variable and engagement as the 
independent variable will be fit to all ITT subjects (engagement is zero for all control 
subjects). An exploratory analysis will also test whether the intervention has a direct or indirect effect on the following psychosocial factors: the pros and cons of change, self-
efficacy, and social support. Finally, an exploratory analysis will test whether nomination 
of, and the extent of engagement with, a social support person moderates the intervention 
effectiveness. 
 
4 STUDY SCHEDULE 
Informed consent will be obtained prior to the initiation of any protocol related activities.

Version 2.0, 08Jul19  Page 11 of 36 
 4.1 SCREENING FOR EL IGIBLE PARTICIPANTS: 
Patients who have been newly diagnosed with SDB and prescribed PAP for their 
treatment will be evaluated for eligibility, and if all entry criteria are met, they may be invited to participate in the study. This may be accomplished by phone or in person.  
  
4.2 INITIAL (ENROLLMENT) CONTACT 
1. Provide patient with access to informed consent document. 
2. When consent has been obtained, collect device information (device ECN, 
device settings, mask type), demographic, and  baseline data into the electronic 
data capture (EDC) system. 
3. Randomize participant in EDC. 
a. Participants randomized to the Control group (Group A) will complete a 
set of baseline questionnaires.  
b. Participants randomized to the Treatment group (Group B) will complete 
a set of baseline questionnaires and provided with instructions to download Restful to their smartphone. 
c. Monitor both groups’ PAP device usage per your standard of care. 
4.3 90-DAY STUDY CONTACT 
1. Both Group A and Group B will be asked to complete a set of end of study 
questionnaires. Restful will be ‘turned off’ for Group B participants.  
2. Continue to monitor participants’ PAP device usage per your standard of care. 3. Distribute compensation for study participation. 
4.4 REPORT OF DEVICE USAGE DATA 
1. A report of PAP usage data (including average hours used per day, leak, 
pressure, and AHI) will be generated by the ResMed Data Analytics group at 90 
days and 180 days and provided to the statistician for analysis. 
2. A user-level analytics report of myAir engagement (including participants who 
registered for myAir and number of times they engaged with the app during the 
study) will be generated by the ResMed Data Analytics group at 90 days and 
180 days and provided to the statistician for analysis. 
3. A user-level analytics report of Restful engagement (including participants who 
registered for Restful and number of times they engaged with the app during 
the study) will be generated by Wellth at 90 days and 180 days and provided to 
the statistician for analysis.

4.6 INFORMED CONSENT 
IRB approved informed consent (21 CFR Part 50) will be obtained by the Investigator or 
delegated investigative staff. The Investigator or delegated staff will be responsible for 
confirming that each patient understands the nature, purpose, and risks associated with 
participating in this study.  
 
The investigative site will have the option of remotely consenting patients. Patients will be 
securely emailed a patient-specific link to access and create a login with the EDC system 
(Medrio). This website will contain the info rmed consent form, HIPAA, instructions on how 
to have any questions answered, and a knowle dge assessment. The same login will also 
be used later in the study to complete participant questionnaires. 
 
Patients will be given sufficient time (either remo tely or in clinic) to consider the study’s 
implications, ask any questions, and get these questions answered before deciding 
whether to participate. If consented remotely, patients will be clearly provided with 
information on how to contact an appropriate investigative staff member for questions 
about the study. Patients will not be able to authorize consent until they have confirmed 
that they have no further questions about the st udy. A copy of the consent form will be 
emailed or given to each participant for their records so they are able to access the 
consent form at any time throughout the course of the study. 
 
Participant consent for this protocol will be obtained prior to the initiation of any study 
procedures.   
 
 
5 INTERVENTION 
5.1 WELLTH APP (RESTFUL) 
The intervention is the use of Restful, the Wellth self-management application. There is no 
clinical treatment intervention, as all participants will be receiving PAP therapy per 
standard of care. 
Restful is a smartphone-based patient engagement tool that utilizes concepts from 
behavioral economics to help patients im prove their adherence to therapy. The 
intervention includes: 
Financial incentive: 
The incentive is $75, and is distributed as follows: Participants unlock $5 after completing 
the app introduction/onboarding, and then $10 for successful nights on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 
13, and 21. Successful nights are nights where therapy is used for ≥4 hours. Once money 
is “unlocked,” the reward is always visible to the participant. However, participants only receive the financial reward if they unlock all $75 by the end of the program. In between 
Protocol #SLP-18-08-01 Project Dahlia  Confidential  
Version 2.0, 08Jul19  Page 14 of 36 
 “pay days,” participants receive positive reinforcement messages and visual cues but no 
financial reward is unlocked. 
Recognizing that participants are likely to st ruggle initially, and that there are 9 days in 
which participants can afford to have non-adherent nights (i.e., 30 – 21 = 9), the 
participants will be granted 9 hearts in the app. These hearts represent 9 the “misses” 
available to them, and they will lose a heart each non-adherent night. The program will 
deliver a tailored intervention message of s upport or encouragement after every 2 lost 
hearts (e.g., remind participants how close they were to a successful night). 
If the participant does not meet adherence in the first 5 weeks and/or they have lost 9 
hearts, then they will get a second chance. The intervention will "reboot." Participants will not be made aware of this opportunity at the outset. 
Social incentive: 
The social incentive will have two components: social currency and social support 
messages. Participants will have the opportunity to nominate a social support person 
during the Wellth onboarding process. This person will be contacted directly by Wellth via 
text message and provided with information that will explain their role in supporting the 
participant. The support person will be asked to provide social currency (described below) that they think will be meaningful to the participant, as well as some supportive messages. 
Over the course of the 90-day trial, Wellth will reach out to the support person to solicit 
additional currency and messages. If the support person is generally non-responsive, or if 
the participant does not nominate a social support person, then the participant will receive 
Wellth-designed content for the social currency and social support components.  
• Social currency: Pictures and/or videos that are meaningful to the participant. 
Delivered to the participant when they hit a therapy usage streak of 3 days in a row 
≥4 hours.  
• Social support messages: Encouraging messages that are meaningful to the 
participant. Delivered to the participant at seemingly random intervals throughout the 90 days (i.e., via a rules-based delivery algorithm).  
5.2 AIRVIEW 
AirView is the HIPAA compliant web-based system that is routinely used for telemonitoring. The PAP device contains built in wireless connectivity which transmits 
data via a mobile network to a secure data center. Data is transmitted at the completion of 
each period of use (e.g. after each night of use). Data can then be accessed, via a login 
code, by the respiratory/sleep team to asse ss items such as device efficacy (residual 
AHI), mask leak, and usage hours. 
AirView is compliant with HIPAA, EU 95/46/EC, and national privacy laws. Data are 
encrypted and all database accesses are logged and can be re-traced. 
Protocol #SLP-18-08-01 Project Dahlia  Confidential  
Version 2.0, 08Jul19  Page 15 of 36 
 5.3 MYAIR 
In addition to AirView, a patient-focused version of the data is available through the myAir 
app. The myAir app can be accessed via the participant’s smartphone or computer and 
allows the participant to monitor their own treatment data. myAir also provides tips to the 
participant on things like coping with therapy, managing mask leaks, and adjusting 
comfort settings. These tips are personalized based on each individual’s data. The myAir 
app is not mandatory in this trial, but participants’ usage of myAir will be documented in 
both Group A and Group B. 
5.4 CONTROL GROUP 
The control group will be monitored and managed per the site’s standard of care with the exception of completion of questionnaires at baseline and again at 90 days after 
enrollment.  
 
6 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING 
6.1 CONFIDENTIALITY 
Information about study participants will be kept confidential and managed according to 
the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
(HIPAA).  Those regulations require a si gned participant authorization informing the 
participant of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from participants in this 
study 
• Who will have access to that information and why 
• Who will use or disclose that information 
• The rights of a research participant to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI  
• All the institutes involved in the study to keep the medical information confidential 
and managed according to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) 
6.2 SOURCE DOCUMENTS 
Source data is all information, original records of clinical compliance records, 
observations, or other activities necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study.  Source data are contained in source  documents.  Examples of these original 
documents and data records include: participants’ records, clinical and office charts, 
laboratory notes, memoranda, participants’ diaries or evaluation checklists, recorded data 
from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being 
accurate and complete, participant files, and records.

For the purpose of this protocol, an adverse ev ent is any deviation from baseline health in 
a participant that can be attributed to the device, disease, or study procedures required by this protocol.  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any event that is fatal or immediately life-threatening 
AND that requires a participant to be hospitalized or hospitalization is unduly prolonged 
because of potential disability or danger to life or because an intervention has been 
necessitated.  This includes events that cause fetal distress, fetal death, congenital 
anomaly or malignancy or any permanently disabling event.  
For the purposes of this protocol, ‘serious’ is defined as any significant adverse 
experience, including those which may be either life-threatening or involve permanent or 
long term injuries, but excluding injuries that are non-life-threatening and that are temporary and reasonably reversible. 
As noted above, changes in a participant’s health should be documented in the 
participant’s record and an assessment should be made regarding association with the 
study device or procedure. If it is determined t hat the event can be attributed to the device 
or procedure required by the protocol, the investigator should obtain and document all the 
information required to document the event, including cause, treatment, and resolution. All 
adverse events must be followed until resolution or until a stable clinical endpoint is reached.  If the event can be attributed to the device or study procedure, all required 
treatments and outcomes of the adverse event must be recorded on the CRFs. 
 
Unanticipated adverse device effects are defined as any serious adverse effect on health 
or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, 
if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree 
of incidence in the investigational plan, or any other unanticipated serious problem 
associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of participants.  
 
Protocol #SLP-18-08-01 Project Dahlia  Confidential  
Version 2.0, 08Jul19  Page 17 of 36 
 Under the requirements of the FDA’s IDE Regulations, an investigator must submit to the 
manufacturer (or its designee) and to the reviewing Institutional Review Board any 
unanticipated adverse device effect occurring during the study as soon as possible, but in 
no event later than ten (10) working days after the investigator first learns of the effect. 
 
9 EXPECTED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECTS 
This study is considered to be of very low risk to the participant.   
10 NON SIGNIFICANT RISK DETERMINATION 
This study is considered non-significant risk (NSR) based on standard of care procedures 
being employed and a review of the Code of Federal Regulations for significant risk 
devices. As required by FDA, the IRB will review this study and determine if it concurs with the NSR designation.  
 
11 RISK MITIGATION 
This study is considered to be of very low risk to the patient due to the non-invasive nature 
of the procedures.

IV. HIPAA AND PHI 
Under a federal law called the Health In surance Portability and Accountability Act 
(“HIPAA”), some demographic, h ealth and/or health-related information that we collect 
as part of providing the Services may be considered “protected health information” or 
“PHI.” Specifically, when we receive ident ifiable information about you from or on behalf 
of your Healthcare Entities, th is information is considered PHI. 
 HIPAA provides specific protections for the pr ivacy and security of PHI and restricts how 
PHI is used and disclosed. Wellth may only use and disclose your PHI in the ways 
permitted by your Healthcare Entity(s). In addition, you may be asked to sign the Wellth 
authorization form (the “Wellt h Authorization”). Your de cision to sign the Wellth 
Authorization is entirely vol untary. If you choose to sign the Wellth Authorization, you 
agree that Wellth may use and di sclose your PHI in the same way it uses and discloses 
your Personal Information that is not PHI. These uses and disclosures are described in 
this Privacy Policy.   To the extent any provision in the Wellth Auth orization is inconsistent with this Privacy 
Policy or other provisions of the Agr eement, then the provis ion in the Wellth 
Authorization only controls with respect to your PHI. If you do not sign the Wellth 
Authorization, then your Personal  Information that is not PHI is governed by this Privacy 
Policy and your Personal Information that is  PHI is used and disclosed only as permitted 
by your Healthcare Entity(s).  
V. USE OF INFORMATION 
We use the information we collect to provide and improve our Platform and our 
Services.  For example, we use such informa tion to process your electronic signatures 
and account for electronic delivery of doc uments, and to optimize and improve our 
technologies and delivery of our Services.  We  use information that we collect about you

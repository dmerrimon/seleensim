It is estimated that one -third of the more than 7 million deaths from cancer worldwide is attributable 
to potentially modifiable risk factors, with 374,000 deaths preventable through diet modification 
alone (not including those attributable to obesity or physical inactivity) .1 Diet supplementation for 
the prevention of cancer is an attractive mechani sm to control cancer, since it is easy to implement 
to a broad population, even populations with reduced incomes and resources.  Grape extracts or 
active components isolated from grapes have received attention as chemopreventive agents 
based upon their ant i-proliferative, anti -inflammatory and anti -oxidant properties.2  
 
The muscadine grape ( Vitis rotundifolia ), found in the warm, humid climate of southeast United 
States, has a distinct phytochemical composition as comp ared to other grape varieties.  The 
muscadine grape contains a high concentration of anthocyanin 3,5 -diglucosides, ellagic acid, 
ellagic acid precursors, gallic a cid, flavan -3-ols and flavonols.3  Several preclinical studies with 
muscadine grape  products  have revealed  anti-tumor activity, including inhibition of tumor cell 
growth  and induction of apoptosis .4-7 Evidence from preclinical trials also suggests that muscadine 
grape products  may decrease systemic inflammation .8-11  Higher levels of inflammation may not 
only increase cancer recurrence risk,12 but also impair quality of life.  Higher levels of systemic 
inflammation are associated with increased fatigue13, reduced levels of physical activity, 
adiposity14,15 and lower levels of physical function16-18.  By reducing levels of circulating 
inflammatory markers such as CRP and IL -6, muscadine grape products  may improve cancer 
outcomes by decreasing symptom burden (particularly fatigue) . 
 
Despi te reports indicating potential anti -tumor activity ,4-6 there are limited clinical studies on the 
efficacy of muscadine grape products  in the prevention or treatment of cancer , representing an 
opportunity for novel investigations .  The current study proposes to build upon promising 
preclinical and clinical studies to assess the safety and tolerability of a proprietary muscadine 
grape extract (MGE) formulation , made from muscadine grape skins and seeds  and produ ced by 
Nature’s Pearl , in a Phase 1 clinical trial of patients with metastatic  solid tumors who have failed 
prior standard  therapies.  
 
1.1 Preclinical  Studies  
 
Literature overview : The anti -tumor properties of muscadine grapes have been 
demonstrated  in preclinical models.4-7 Porter et al examined the effects muscadine gra pe 
extract  on lung tumor formation in the fetus following transplacental exposure to a 
polycyclic hydrocarbon.  Results indicated that muscadine exposure through drinking 
water reduces both tumor proliferation and angiogenesis, leading to a decrease in tumo r 
burden and multiplicity in mouse models.19 Exposure to muscadine  grape extract  through 
drinking water  similarly  reduced breast tumor burden and multiplicity in c-neu mice .20  In a 
study by God et al , four varieties of muscadine grape were tested and showed significant 
inhibition of 2 -aminoanthracene mutagenesis, high antioxidant activity, and the ability to 
inhibit activities of metalloproteinases , implying that these muscadine products  could be 
good inhibitors of carcinogenesis.6 In colon carcinoma cells, muscadine exposure  induced 
cell death.4,5  In prostate cancer cell lines, treatment with muscadine  grapes  induce d both 
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.7 One mechanism by which muscadine grapes cause 
apoptosis is by downregulating the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI3K)/Akt survival 
pathway.7 The PI3K/Akt pathway is a key oncogenic signaling pathway that has been 
linked to tumorigenesis and resistance to anticancer therapies in a wide variety of tumor 
types.21  A study by Burton et al examined the effects of muscadine grape product  on bone 
turnover in prostate and breast cancer cell models overexpressing Snail transcription

Protocol version date 10/5/2018              Page 8 of 31 factor.22  They show that Snail regulation can be antagonized by muscadine exposure , 
leading to decreased cell invasion, migration and bone turnover , and thus  sugges ting that 
muscadine  grape s could be a promising bioactive treatment  for bone metastatic cancer . 
Overview of p reliminary data from the investigative team : Preliminary studies from the 
investigative team (Gallagher/Tallant) demonstrate that muscadine grape seeds and skins 
reduced the proliferation of both human breast and prostate cancer cell  lines. The 
reduction in breast cancer cell growth was associated with a decrease in activate d mitogen 
activated protein (MAP) kinase, a critical enzyme involved in cell proliferation.  In addition, 
muscadine grape liquid extract  reduced the tumor burden in a transgenic model of 
spontaneous breast cancer with a concomitant attenuation in prolifera tion, tumor blood 
vessel formation, and tumor -associated 
fibrosis. These data are described below and 
provide additional rationale to assess the 
efficacy of Nature’s Pearl proprietary 
muscadine grape extract ( MGE ) on cancer  
outcomes in clinical studies . 
Inhibition of Prostate Cancer Cell 
Proliferation by Muscadine Grape 
Components  
Actively growing human LnCaP or PC3 
prostate cancer cells were plated into 
individual wells of 24 well plates and treated 
for 7 days with increasing concentrations of 
extracts from either muscadine grape seeds 
or skins, to determine whether the extracts 
reduced prostate cancer cell proliferation.  As 
shown in Figure 1 , extracts from both grape 
seeds and skin reduced the proliferation of 
LnCaP or PC3 human prostate cancer cells.  
The responses were dependent upon the 
dose of extract that was used and similar 
responses were obtained with grape seed 
extract compared to grape skin extract.   
Inhibition of Breast Cancer Cell Proliferation 
by Muscadine Grape Components  
Actively growing human breast cancer cells —
ZR-75-1 ER+ breast cancer cells, MDA -MB-
231 or SKBR3 triple negative breast cancer 
cells--were plated into ind ividual wells of 24 
well plates and treated for 7 days with 
increasing concentrations of extracts from 
either muscadine grape seeds or skins, to 
determine whether the extracts reduced 
breast cancer cell proliferation. As shown in Figure 2 , extracts from both grape seeds and 
skin reduced the proliferation of ZR -75-1, MDA -MB-231 and SKBR3 human breast cancer 
cells. The responses were dependent upon the dose of extract that was used and similar 
responses were obtained with grape seed extract compared to grape skin extract.

Inhibition of MAP Kinase Activity by Muscadine Grape Components  
Human MDA -MB-231 or ZR -75-1 breast 
cancer cells were incubated with 50 µg/mL 
muscadine grape seed or grape skin extract 
for increasing periods of time. M AP kinase 
activity was quantified in cell extracts by 
Western blot hybridization using an antibody 
against phospho -ERK1/ERK2 from Cell 
Signaling. The decrease in phospho -ERK 
activi ty was calculated by densitometry using 
β-actin as a loading control. As shown in 
Figure 3 , the extracts from both muscadine 
grape seeds and grape skins caused a 
significant reduction in phospho -ERK, 
suggesting that the extracts signi ficantly 
reduced proli feration. There was no significant 
difference in the response to grape seed 
versus grape skin extracts . 
Because  treatment with muscadine grape 
seeds versus skins showed no significant difference in effect on cancer cell lines, the 
additional preclinical studies were performed with a muscadine grape liquid extract 
containing both seeds and skins.

Protocol version date 10/5/2018              Page 10 of 31 The effect of muscadine grape liquid extract 
(MGLE) was tested on f emale FVB -Tg(MMTV)  
NKAMul/J transgenic mice , in which the 
activated rat Erbb2 (c -neu) oncogene , under the 
direction of the mous e mammary tumor virus 
promoter expressed specifically in the mammary 
gland (c -neu mice), form mammary tumors (the 
equivalent of human breast cancer) by 6 - 8 
months of age.  Mice were treated with MG LE 
beginning at 3 weeks of age (at the time of 
weaning) a nd were sacrificed at 7½ months of 
age.  The dose of MG LE was approximately 1  
mg of phenolics for a 25 gram mouse (and is 
equivalent to approximately 10 tablespoons or 
148 mL of extract per day for a 70 kg man and 
an average concentration of 20,000 mg of 
phenolics/liter of MG LE).  The muscadine grape 
liquid extract w as added to the drinking water. 
Eighteen mice were treated for an average of 
220 days (beginning treatment at 21 days of age, at the time of weaning).  Ten (10) mice  
drank regular drinking water (c ontrol) and 8 mice drank water containing the MG LE.  
Although all of the mice developed tumors throughout their mammary tissue, there was a 
significant difference in the weight of the tumor mass, as shown in Figure 4 .   
Mamm ary tissue was fixed in 4% formalin, 
paraffin embedded and section ed into 5 
micron sections, for immunohistochemical 
analysis. Sections were incubated with an 
antibody to Ki67, as a measure of cell 
proliferation. As shown in Figure 5 , tumors 
from mice that drank MG LE had a 
significant decrease in the number of 
proliferating cells . These results indicate 
that muscadine grape liquid extract 
reduces cell proliferation, in agreement 
with reduction in cell number and MAP 
kinase activation observed in cultured 
breast cancer cells.   
Tumor sections from c -neu mice drinking 
regular water ( control) or MG LE were 
incubated with an antibody to the 
endothelial cell marker, CD34, and vessels were identified by a combination of 
morphology and positive CD34 immunoreactivity . As shown in Figure 6 , tumors from mice 
drinking MG LE had fewer blood vessels than mice drinking regular water, suggesting that 
the grape extract inhibits angiogenesis.   
Interstitial tumoral fibrosis was quantified in breast tumor tissue sections from c -neu mice 
and stained with picrosirius red, a nonspecific collagen stain. Collagen reaction product 
was markedly reduced by MG LE administration as compared to controls ( Figure 7 ).  
Treatment with the MG LE reduced interstitial fibrosis by more than 50%, indi cating that 
the extract reduces cancer -associated fibrosis in breast tumors.

1.2 Preclinical t oxicity studies with MGE  
 
The animal studies above were performed with muscadine grape liquid extract  from 
Nature’s Pearl (Advance, NC) , which was added directly to the rodent drinking water.  To 
study t he effects of muscadine grape extract in humans,  the muscadine grape liquid 
extract is dried , converted to powder  form, and encapsulated.  This proprietary product 
produced by Nature’s Pearl is the muscadine grape extract (MGE)  used in the preclinical 
toxicity studies below and in the phase 1 clinical study proposed.  However, b ecause 
rodents do not swallow capsules, the  MGE  powder is reconstituted and added to the 
drinking water  for the toxicity  studies  described below .    
 
The primary goal of the rodent to xicity tests on the Nature’s Pearl MGE was to identify the 
range of doses that cause d no life-threatening or adverse effect s, thereby providing critical 
information for conduct of a Phase I clinical trial to assess toxicity in humans with cancer 
and establ ishing an estimated clinical margin of safety. Toxicity tests on the proprietary 
MGE that will be used in clinical testing were performed in mice, to assess effects of the 
extract on the general health of the mice as well as their hearts, liver, lungs and kidneys.

Protocol version date 10/5/2018              Page 12 of 31 Male C57 black mice (8 weeks of age) were randomized into groups to  receive drinking 
water alone (c ontrol) or MGE in the drinking water at four escalating doses of MGE as 
determined by the m easurement of total phenolics. Daily observations of the mice included 
evaluations f or weight loss, diarrhea, dehydration, edema, abdominal enlargement or 
ascites, progressive dermatitis, rough hair coat or unkempt appearance due to lack of 
grooming, hunched posture indicative of pain, lethargy or persistent  decumbency due to 
loss of appetite, coughing, labored breathing, nasal discharge, jaundice, cyanosis, 
pallor/anemia, neurological signs indicated by inappropriate head carriage or shaking of 
the head, bleeding from any orifice, or any condition interferin g with daily activities. Prior 
to sacrifice, the mice were placed in metabolic cages for 24 hours, and food intake and 
fecal and urine output w ere measured to quantify markers of renal damage. During the 4th 
week of treatment, blood pressure was determined  by tail cuff plethysmography in 
conscious mice and cardiac function was assessed in mice anesthetized with isofluorane, 
using the non -invasive, small animal VEVO ultrasound imaging system in the M and B 
modes, to measure or calculated ejection fraction, f ractional shortening, stroke volume, 
heart rate and cardiac output were determined.  The mice were sacrificed after one month 
of treatment; tissues (heart, kidney, lung, liver, spleen and brain) were weighed, fixed in 
4% formalin, embedded in paraffin, sec tioned at 5 microns and stained with Hematoxylin 
& Eosin (H & E) for analysis by a veterinary pathologist to assess any gross structural 
abnormalities.  
 
Four concentrations of the MGE were tested.  The range of concentrations to be tested 
was based upon pr evious studies in the Gallagher/Tallant laboratory reported above . In 
those studies, a daily concentration of 1 mg of total phenolics/mouse/day was effective at 
reducing tumor multiplicity.  For the toxicity studies in mice, the four doses of the MGE 
teste d were 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg total phenolics/mouse/day, administered to the mice 
in their drinking water. Total phenolic content was determined usin g the Folin -Ciocalteau 
reagent with gallic acid as the standard.  Since an average mouse of this age wei ghs 
approximately 25 g or 0.025 kg, this corresponds to a dose range of 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg 
total phenolics/kg/day.  Based upon an average mass of 70 kg for a patient, this would 
correspond to 700, 1400, 2800, and 5600 mg phenolics/day. The proprietary Na ture’s 
Pearl muscadine grape extract capsule contains approximately 162 mg total 
phenolics/capsule, this would correspond to taking 5, 10, 21 and 42 capsules/day.   
 
Results  
During the 4 week administration of the MGE at the four doses, there were no obser vations 
of diarrhea, dehydration, edema, abdominal enlargement, loss of hair coat, reduced 
grooming, or decreased level of activity, appetite, drinking or breathing.  There were no 
indications of pallor , jaundice or cyanosis or any neurological signs of di scomfort . There 
was no bleeding or discharge. These results suggest that the mice were free from any 
pathology that affected their normal daily activities or health.  
 
The mice were weighed at the end of the treatment period, to determine the effect of the 
MGE on total body weight.  The weight of the mice at the end of the 4 -week treatment 
period was similar with the three lowest concentrati ons of the MGE compared to the 
control group.  Mice treated with the highest concentration of MGE had a small but 
significant decrease in total body weight (from 28.6 ± 1.2 grams to 25.0 ± 1.3 grams, which 
represents less than 15% of their total body weight).  However, there was no effect on food 
intake, fecal output or urine volume compared to the untreated mice, measured during the 
last week of treatment, suggesting little effect of the MGE on eating and drinking 
behaviors.

At the time of sacrifice, various organs (heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen and brain) were 
removed and weighed and the organ weights of mice treated  with each dose of MGE were 
compared to the untreated control group. A portion of each organ was fixed in formalin, 
sectioned and stained with H & E, for assessment by a veterinary pathologist.  In addition, 
the heart and kidney were assessed  by echocardiography and radioimmunoassay of 
urinary proteins, respectively, as a further measure of heart and renal function.  There was 
no difference in the weight or structure of the hearts of mice treated with increasing doses 
of MGE . Cardiac parameters  including ejection fraction, fractional shortening, cardiac 
outpu t, stroke volume and heart rate were all similar in mice treated with MGE compared 
to untreated Control mice . There was no difference in the weight or structure of the lungs 
of mice treated with MGE compare d to the untreated c ontrol mice.  The weight of the livers 
of mice treated with the two lowest MGE (0.25 and 0.5 mg phenolics/mouse/day) and the 
highest MGE (2.0 mg phenolics/mouse/day) concentrations were no different than the 
weight of the  livers of the untreated mice.  However, the weight of the livers of mice in the 
1.0 mg phenolics/mouse/day) were slightly increased compared to the control. Spleen 
weight of mice treated with MGE was not significantly different than untreated control mice  
and the spleens of mice were generally within normal limits with one mouse in the highest 
MGE treatment group having some  extra medullary  hematopoiesis. The weight of the 
brains of mice treated with MGE was not significantly different than untreated mice.  The 
brains were subdivided into four regions —cortex, cerebellum, hypothalamus and 
brainstem . All brain regions examined were within normal limits .  
 
Conclusions from toxicity studies and corresponding clinical doses:  
Little toxicity was observed at any of  the doses tested . Therefore , the level of phenolics 
used to treat the mice suggests that this level of phenolics and corresponding numbers of 
capsules w ill likely be tolerated by patients. However, based upon patient compliance, a 
recommended dose range f or patients would include 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10  capsules/day 
(corresponding to  approximately 5, 9, 14, 18 and 23  mg phenolics/kg/day) . 
 
1.3 Clinical Studies  
 
Muscadine grape skin extract has been evaluated in clinical trials to a limited extent i n the 
setting of cardiovascular disease23 and diabetes.24 In a randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled crossover trial, 50 adults with coronary disease or ≥1  cardiac risk factor 
received  muscadine grape seed supplementation  (1300 mg daily) and placebo for 4 we eks 
each, with a 4 -week washout , and  no adverse events were reported.23 Similarly, a 
randomized study of non -diabetic and type 2 diabetic participants using 150 mL of 
muscadine grape juice, muscadine grape wine, and dealcoh olized muscadine grape wine 
over a 28 -day period had no adverse events reported.24 
 
A muscadine grape product has also been examined in a phase 1 /2 trial of men with 
biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.25 The phase 1 portion of the study evaluated  
increasing doses of pulverized muscadine grape skin in a product called MPX (Muscadine 
Naturals Inc, Clemmons NC) in cohorts of two patients, with six patients at the highest 
dose of 4,000 mg  (n=14) .  Dose selection was based on  unpublished preclinical work in 
animal studies.  Four patients experienced adverse gastrointestinal symptoms possibly 
related  to the study agent , including grade 1 flatulence, grade 1 soft stools, and grade 1 
burping. No other related adverse events were reported and one patient reported 
improvement of chronic constipation. Six of the 14 patients came off study for disease 
progression (five metast atic, one rising PSA) after exposure for a median of 15 months.

Protocol version date 10/5/2018              Page 14 of 31 One patient came off study for myasthenia gravis that was unrelated to treatment. Seven 
patients remain ed on the study. The lack of dose -limiting toxicities led to the selection of 
4,000  mg/d as the highest dose for further study. Median within -patient PSA doubling time 
increased by 5.3 months (non -significant, P=0.17).  Based on the favorable safety profile  
and a possible lengthening of PSA doubling time , the phase 2 portion of this study was 
expanded to 125 patients randomized to pl acebo, 500 mg/d, or 4000 mg/d MPX  arms. 
Recruitment was completed in October 2014 with results pending.  
 
In summary, muscadine grape products have shown  anti-cancer activity in preclinical 
models and have demonstrate d a favorable safety profile in preclinical and clinical studies. 
This Phase 1 study using MGE represents an opportunity to translate promising preclinical 
data supporting the anti -cancer properties of a natural product into clinical trials.

would limit compliance with study requirements.  
 
3.2.7 Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of potential for 
teratogenic or abortifacient effects  with using MGE. Because there is an 
unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary 
to treatment of the mother with MGE, breastfeeding should be 
discontinued.  
 
3.2.8  Patients with primary brain tumors are excluded  due to lack of data on MGE 
crossing the  blood brain barrier.  Patients with metastatic brain tumors may 
be enrolled.  
 
3.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
 
Men and women of all races and ethnicities who meet the above -described 
eligibility criteria are eligible to participate in this study.  
 
The study consent form will also be provided in Spanish for Spanish -speaking 
participants.  We anticipate enrolling bet ween 2 and 30 participants on this study. 
Based on CCCWFU population estimates, we expect approximately 40% of 
participants to be women. Translating this to our maximum sample size estimate 
of 30, we plan to enroll at least 12 women  if we reach our maximum  accrual . We 
do not expect the percentage of Hispanic/Latino or racial minority cancer patients 
eligible for this study to be higher than the percentage of Hispanic or racial minority 
new cancer patients seen at CCCWFU (1.7% and 14.4%, respectively); there fore, 
we plan to enroll at least 4 racial minority and 1 Hispanic/Latino patient  if we reach 
our maximum accrual.  
 
Should we not meet or exceed these estimates, the PI will engage the Cancer 
Center Health Equity Advisory Group to discuss strategies to enhance recruitment 
in these target populations.

Protocol version date 10/5/2018              Page 19 of 31 6.2 Treatment  Administration  
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient  basis. Reported adverse events 
and potential risks are described in Section 8.0. No investigational or commercial 
agents or therapies other than those described below may be administered with 
the intent to t reat the patient's malignancy.  
 
Dose -Escalation Schedule  
Dose Level  Dose of MGE  
Level 1  1 pill po BID  
Level 2  2 pills po BID  
Level 3  3 pills po BID  
Level 4  4 pills po BID  
Level 5  5 pills po BID  
 
6.2.1 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as grade 3 gastrointestinal side 
effect s attributable to treatment or any grade 4 or 5 adverse event  
attributable  to treatment as per the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4.0 criteria.  Any adverse event attributable to 
treatment and resulting in permanent discontinuation of MGE will be 
considered a DLT. Toxicity will be assessed at 4 weeks . Any DLTs that 
occur 1 day (day 29) after the 4 week period will be evaluated and 
considered as pot entially attributable to the administration of MGE during 
the first 4 weeks.  The w ashout per iod for this drug is 24 hours. Dose 
escalation will proceed within each cohort a s follows:   
 
Number of Patients 
with DLT  at a Given 
Dose Level  Escalation Decision Rule  
0 out of 3  Enter 3 patients at the next dose level . 
> 2 Dose escalation will be stopped. This dose level will be 
declared the maximally administered dos e (highest dose 
administered). Three (3) additional patients will be entered  
at the next lowest dose level if only 3 patients were treated 
previously at that dose.  
1 out of 3  Enter at least 3 more patients at this dose level.  
 If 0 of these 3 patients experience s DLT, proceed to 
the next dose level.  
 If 1 or more of this group suffer DLT, then dose 
escalation is stopped, and this dose is declared th e 
maximally administered dose. Three (3) additional 
patients will be entered at the next lowest dose level if 
only 3 patients were treated previously at that do se. 
<1 out of 6 at highest 
dose level below the 
maximally 
administered dose  This is generally the recommended phase 2 dose  
(Maximum Tolerated Dose [MTD ]). At least 6 patients 
must be entered at the recommended phase 2 dose.

6.2.2  Dose modification in the event of toxicity  
In the event of dose -limiting toxicity,  the patient will be removed from the 
study and the  escalation decision rules defined above will be followed.   
There will be no dose -modifications on study. Either the patient or the 
treating physician can chose to discontinue MGE at any time. If necessary, 
MGE can be held for up to 7 days in the first month and for up to 21 days 
subsequently , as described in Section 6.5.1.  
 
6.3 Study procedures  
 
6.3.1  Recruitment  
 
6.3.1.1  Potentially eligible patients will be recruited from the Wake 
Forest Comprehensive Cancer Center  
6.3.1.2  The research nurse  (RN)  will be contacted to review eligibility 
and to consent eligible patients in person.  
6.3.1.3  The RN will obtain baseline surveys, clinical information and 
ensure research labs are drawn and processed per protocol.  Pill 
dairy will be provided at each visit.  
6.3.1.4  Study drug (30 -day supply) will be provided to participant by the 
RN. 
 
6.3.2  Follow -up Assessments  
 
6.3.2.1  Study coordinator will contact p articipants 2 weeks after each 
clinic visit until week 8 to assess medication adherence and 
ascertain any potential adverse events.  
6.3.2.2  The RN will review AE with the patient at each follow -up visit in 
clinic, perform pill count , obtain clinical information per protocol  
and administer surveys at 4 and 8 weeks per protocol.  RN will 
obtain study labs are each visit and provide 30 -day supply of 
MGE at prescribed dose level.  
 
6.4 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Gui delines  
 
Patients should receive full supportive care , including transfusions of blood and 
blood products, antibiotics, antiemetics, etc., as clinically indicated . Anti-
inflammatory or narcotic analgesics may be offered  as needed. Medications 
considered necessary for the patient's well -being may be given at the discretion of 
the managing physician , i.e., chronic treatments for concomitant medical 
conditions, as well as agents required for life -threatening medical problem s, etc. 
The reason(s) for treatment, dosage, and dates of treatment should be recorded 
on the flow sheets.  
 
Participants on warfarin should have their INR checked within 2 weeks of starting 
MGE to ensure there is no clinically significant interaction. Furt her blood work to 
monitor warfarin levels are at the discretion of the treating physician per usual care.

Protocol version date 10/5/2018              Page 21 of 31 6.5 Duration of Therapy  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue 
until one of the following criteria applie s: 
 
 Disease progression,  either by standard imaging or clinical parameters per the 
judgment of the treating physician,  
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
 Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
 Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or  
 General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the treating physician . 
 
6.5.1  Missed doses  
 
If a dose of MGE is missed, the patient will be instructed to take their next 
dose as scheduled. Missed doses should not be added to the next dose .  
 
 6.5.1.1  Missed doses during first 28 days  
 
If the patient is unable to take their dose of MGE for more than 7 
consecutive days  due to unforeseen circumstances unrelated  to 
drug toxicity, then t he subject will not be evaluable for the primary 
outcome and will be removed from the study. Participants who 
come off study prior to 28 days for reasons other than toxicity will 
be evaluated for DLT during the washout period (24 h ours, per 
section 6.2.1).  
 
 6.5.1.2  Missed doses after first 28 days  
 
If treatment must be held for any reason, it must be restarted within 
21 days  or the patient will be removed from the study.   
 
6.6 Duration of Follow Up  
 
Patients removed from the study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed 
until resolution or stab ilization of the adverse event.  Patients who are removed or 
withdraw from the study  for any reason other than  toxicity will be followed for vital 
status only  after the 24 hour w ashout period . Patients will be followed every 6 ± 2 
weeks until death for monitoring survival study endpoints.  
 
 
7.0 Measurement of Effect  
 
Although response is not the primary endpoint of this trial, patients with measurable disease will 
be assessed by the treating physician , based on the clinical radiologic report  and clinical status , 
per usual care .  For the purposes of this study, patients will be reevaluated  with imaging  8 weeks  
(± 7 days)  after study initiation and then every 12 weeks  (± 28 days)  while on MGE .

Protocol version date 10/5/2018              Page 22 of 31 7.1 Definitions  
   
Evaluable for toxicity  (primary outcome) : All patients will be evaluable for toxicity 
from the time of their first treatment with MGE.  Per section 6.5.1, patients who miss 
7 consecutive days of treatment in the first 28 days for reasons other than toxicity 
are not evaluable and will be removed from the study and replaced . 
 
Inevaluable for objective response : When no imaging/measurement is done at all 
at a particular time poin t, the patient is not evaluable (NE) at that time point.    
 
Measurable disease : Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of 
measurement is to be re corded) with a minimu m size of 10 mm by CT scan , 10 
mm caliper measurement by clinical exam , or 20 mm by chest X -ray. 
 
Non-measurable lesions : Non -measurable lesions include:  bony metastases,  
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory 
breast  disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses  or 
organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable by reproducible 
imaging techniques.  
 
Progression -Free Survival  is defined  as the duration of time from the start of 
treatment to the time of progression  or death.  Patients will be followed until disease 
progression and death.  
 
Overall Survival  is defined as the duration of time from the start of treatment to 
date of death.  
 
7.2 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up 
whenever possible . Measurements will be obtained from u sual care imaging and 
assessed by the PI(s) in confirmation with the physician of record.  
 
 CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment. MRI  and PET/CT are al so acceptable . 
 Lesions on a ches t X-ray may be considered measurable lesions if they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable.  
 Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
and ≥10 mm in diameter as assessed using calip ers. For the case of skin 
lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the 
size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 Tumor markers alone will not typically be used to define response. If markers 
are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to 
be considered in complete response.  
 Cytology and histology can be used in rare cases (e.g., for evaluation of 
residual masses to differentiate between Partial Response and Complete 
Response or evaluation of new or enlarging effusions to differentiate between 
Progressive Disease and Response/Stable Disease).

8.0 Adverse Events List and Reporting Requirements  
 
8.1 Adverse Event List for MGE  
 
Expected : Based on previous studies, only minimal AEs are expected, including 
flatulence, diarrhea, nausea, dyspepsia, and abdominal cramping.  
 
8.2 Adverse Event Characteristics  
 
 CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading 
scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Even ts (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. All appropriate 
treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A 
copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
 ‘Expectedness’ : AEs can be ‘Unexpect ed’ or ‘Expected’ (see Section 8 .1 
above) for expedited reporting purposes only.   
 Attribution  of the AE:  
- Definite : The AE is clearly  related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable : The AE is likely  related  to the study treatment.  
- Possible : The AE may be  related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely : The AE is doubtfully related  to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated : The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
 
8.3 STRC  SAE Reporting Requirements  
 
The Safety and Toxicity Reporting Committee (STRC) is responsible for reviewing SAEs 
for CCCWFU Institutional studies as outlined in Appendix C. STRC  currently requires that 
all unexpected 4 and  all grade  5 SAEs on these  trials be reported to them for review. All 
CCCWFU Clinical Research Management (CRM) s taff members assisting a P rincipal 
Investigator  in investigating, documenting and reporting an SAE qualifying for STRC  
reporting are responsible for informing a clinical member of the STRC as well as the entire 
committee via the email notification procedure of the occurrence of an SAE.  
 
8.4  WFUHS IRB AE Reporting Requirements  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others and adverse events shall 
be promptly reported to the IRB , according to institutional policy . Reporting to the IRB is 
required regardless of the funding source, study sponsor, or whether the event involves 
an investigational or markete d drug, biologic or device. Reportable events are not limited 
to physical injury, but include psychological, economic and social harm.  Reportable events 
may arise as a result of drugs, biological agents, devices, procedures or other 
interventions, or as a result of questionnaires, surveys, observations or other interactions 
with research subjects.  
 
All members of the research team are responsible for the appropriate reporting to the IRB 
and other applicable parties of unanticipated problems involving risk t o subjects or others. 
The Principal Investigator, however, is ultimately responsible for ensuring the prompt 
reporting of unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others to the IRB. The

12.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
 Phase 1 Study of Muscadine Grape Extract (MGE) in Advanced Malignancy  
Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University (CCCWFU)  
CCCWFU # 01815  
Protocol version date 10/5/2018              Page 26 of 31 12.1 Analysis of Primary Objective  
 
The primary objective of determining the safety and MTD of MGE will be completed  
by monitoring toxicities and using the dose escalation plan detailed above.   
 
To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MGE in patients with 
metastatic cancer , we will use  a standard 3+3 Phase 1 dose escalation statistical 
design. All MGE dose esc alations conducted will be escalated according to the 
dose e scalation scheme (see Section 6.2 ). The number of pat ients in each cohort 
will be 3.  If no patients in any cohort develop a dose -limiting toxicity (DLT), dose 
escalation will continue in cohorts of 3 patients  up to the maximum dose . However, 
if a DLT is observed in 1 of 3 patient s at any dose level, the cohort of that dose 
level will be e xpanded to a maximum of 6 patients . If 1 of the 6  patients  has a DLT , 
the dose escalation procedure will continue in 3 patients for each subsequent 
cohort. However, once a DLT is observed in a total of 2 patients at any dose level, 
dosing of MGE in patient s at that dose level will stop immediately, even though the 
total number of patients at the last cohort may be as few as 2.  Dose escalatio n is 
considered to be complete.  The dose level that induces a DLT in 2 or more patients 
is considered to be above MTD , and the dose level immediately below the dose 
level that induced a DLT in ≥2 patients is considered the MTD for MGE if ≤1 
participants of 6 patients at that level have a DLT.  
 
In the event that the MTD is not observed after the 5 dose levels listed in Section 
6.2 have been tested, the investigators will consider stopp ing additional dose 
escalation.  The decision will be based on the actual dose level tested, the extent 
of anti -tumor efficacy observed, and the type of toxicity observed, etc.  
 
12.2 Analysis of Secondary Objective  
 
12.2.1  To monitor toxicity at 4, 8, and every 4 weeks thereafter on MGE  
 
To analyze objective 2.1.1, we will summarize any expected toxicities, any 
laboratory based toxicities, and any grade 3 or higher gastrointestinal 
toxicities and any grade 4 or higher toxicities using frequency tables  overall 
and by week . 
 
12.2.2  To evaluate change in phenolic levels (total and component, blood and 
urine)  from baseline to 4 and 8 weeks  
 
To analyze object ive 2.2.2, we will fit a mixed model ANOVA mo del with 
phenolic level as the outcome and time (baseline, 4, and 8 weeks) as a 
fixed effect and subject as a random effect. We will use contrasts to 
estimate the changes from baseline to week 4 and week 8.  
 
12.2.3  To evaluate change in serum cytokines and  growth factors from baseline 
to 4 and 8 weeks on MGE  
 
To analyze object ive 2.2.3, we will fit a mixed model ANOVA model with 
the outcome of interest (cytokine or growth factor) as the outcome and time 
(baseline, 4, and 8 weeks) as a fixed effect and subje ct as a random effect.

CCCWFU # 01815  
Protocol version date 10/5/2018              Page 27 of 31 We will use contrasts to estimate the changes from baseline to week 4 and 
week 8.  
 
12.2.4  To observe the response rate of MGE in patients with metastatic cancer.  
 
To analyze objective 2. 2.4, we will characterize response at 8 weeks u sing 
frequency table.  We will also characterize the best response at the end of 
treatment with MGE using a frequency table.  
 
12.2.5  To assess overall and progression -free survival in patients with metastatic 
cancer receiving MGE.  
 
To analyze objective 2. 2.5, we will summarize o verall survival and 
progression -free survival using the Kaplan -Meier method.  We will calculate 
median survival rates and associated 95% confidence intervals. Patients 
will be censored at date of last contact.  
 
12.2.6  To assess globa l quality of life and fatigue in cancer patients taking MGE.  
 
Quality of Life and fatigue will be monitored every 4 weeks until the end of 
the study. To analyze objective 2. 2.6, we will fit a mixed model ANOVA 
model with phenolic level as the outcome and t ime (baseline, every 4 
weeks) as a fixed effect and subject as a random effect. We will use 
contrasts to estimate the changes from baseline to each follow -up time 
period.  
 
12.2.7  To assess adherence to MGE treatment.  
 
To analyze objective 2. 2.7, we will summarize the percent of pills taken at 
the end of every 4 week period i using the formula:  
 
𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡  𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑠  𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒𝑛 𝑖= (𝐷𝑜𝑠𝑒  𝐿𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑙  ×7 ×4)𝑖−𝑃𝑖𝑙𝑙 𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 𝑖
(𝐷𝑜𝑠𝑒  𝐿𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑙  ×7 ×4)𝑖. 
 
In the formula above, pill count will be calculated from counting the number 
of pills returned as well as by summarizing the patient’s pill diary. The 
percent of pills taken will be summarized by dose level using the mean and 
95% confidence interval.  
 
12.3 Power and Sample Size  
 
The study will enroll a minimum of 2 participants and a maximum of 30. 
 
 12.4 Estimated Accrual Rate  and Study Length  
 
We anticipate accruing at least 2 patient s per month on this protocol and thus 
expect that accrual for this Phase 1 trial will be completed in less than 16  months , 
and that the MTD can be determined within 1 month of the last accrual . Patients 
will be followed until death.

  CRITERIA FOR 
EVALUATION  Efficacy 
The efficacy of CERC- 002 will be determined by measuring survival status, the need 
for invasive ventilat ion, PaO2/FiO2, SOFA score, b ody temperature , and v iral load in 
nasopharyngeal aspirates . Apart from these tests, time to invasive ventilation, duration 
of ventilation support, duration of time in the ICU, duration of the time in the hospital, 
and duration of time requiring O2 by nasal canula  will also be determined. 
Safety 
The safety of CERC- 002 will be determined by the reporting of AEs , according to 
Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria (v 5.0) , findings 
on physical exam, and the results of ECGs and safety laboratory determinations.  
Pharmacokinetics  
The PK of CERC- 002 will be determined by obtaining plasma levels of CERC- 002 at 
various time points after administrati on. 
Pharmacodynamics  
The PD will be determined by measuring the levels of LIGHT and Inflammat ionMAP 
biomarker  patterns .  
Immunogenicity  
The immunogenicity of CERC -002 will be determined by measuring ADA levels.  
STATISTICAL 
METHODS  All efficacy and safety variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics.   
Descriptive statistics for continuous data will include number of subjects  (n), mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum.  Summaries of change from 
baseline variables will include only subjects  who have both a baseline value and 
corresponding value at the timepoint of interest. Descriptive statistics for categorical 
data will include frequency and percentage.   
The proportion o f subjects alive and free of respiratory failure with 90% confidence 
interval will be presented  by treatment group. In addition, the proportion of subjects 
alive and free of respiratory failure in the CERC -002 group will be compared to that in 
the placebo group using a Chi -square test or similar method .  
AE data will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). The overall incidence of subje cts having at least one AE will be 
summarized. The incidence of treatment- emergent adverse events  (TEAEs) will be 
summarized by treatment group, system organ class (SOC), and preferred term  (PT). 
Each subje ct will be counted only once per SOC and PT. For all continuous safety 
variables (eg, laboratory and vital sign measures), descriptive stat istics for all reported 
values and change from baseline values will be summarized by treatment group  and 
time point.  
SAMPLE SIZE 
DETERMINATION  A total of 82 subjects are planned to either  with CERC -002 or placebo . This sample 
size will provide greater th an 80% power to detect a difference of 0. 25 in the proportion 
of subjects alive and free of respiratory failure using a Chi -square test at a one -sided 
significance level of 0. 05. This calculation assumes that the pr oportion alive and free 
of respiratory failure will be 0. 60 in the placebo group  and 0.8 5 in the CERC -002 
group.   
STUDY AND 
TREATMENT DURATION CERC- 002 and placebo treatment will be administered on Day 1 in addition to standard 
of care . A safety follow- up contact  will be performed at Day 60 making the overall 
duration of the study period 60 days .

  6 INTRODUCTION 
6.1 Background and Rationale 
COVID-19 (2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV] disease) 
COVID-19 (2019 novel coronavirus disease) is an acute respiratory disease, caused by a novel 
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO ) 
Emergency Committee declared COVID-19 a global health emergency based on increasing number of cases in China and other countries. Cases are still growing rapidly and almost all 
countries are affected. As of April 2020, United States (US) has the highest number of COVID-19 
cases and deaths due to COVID-19 (Coronavirus 2019‐nCoV, CSSE). 
The initial clinical sign of COVID‐19 that allowed the case detection was pneumonia 
(Chan et al, 2020). Complications of COVID-19 pneumonia include acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS), arrhythmia, shock, acute kidney injury, acute cardiac injury, liver dysfunction, 
and secondary infection (Huang et al, 2020; Wang et al, 2020). The main cause of mortality in 
COVID-19 appears to be dysregulated hyperimmune response causing cytokine storm, acute lung injury and ARDS. Fifteen to 20% of COVID-19 patients experience severe respiratory illness, 
requiring hospitalization and oxygen therapy ( Huang et al, 2020). 
Currently, there are no treatments to prevent progression of COVID-19 pneumonia to ARDS in 
patients with COVID-19. 
Role of LIGHT, an immunoregulatory cytokine, in viral infection 
An important immunoregulatory cytokine, LIGHT (homologous to lymphotoxin, exhibits 
inducible expression and competes with herpes simplex virus [HSV] glycoprotein D for binding 
to herpes virus entry mediator [HVEM], a receptor expressed on T lymphocyte) is secreted in high 
levels during viral infection, which supports ARDS-related lung fibrosis and cytokine storm, but 
has not been studied in the patients with COVID-19 or other human coronavirus infections 
(Xu et al, 2019). Neutrophils and macrophages express high levels of LIGHT and tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF ) and are a major source of these inflammatory cytokines (Kwon et al, 1997).  
LIGHT (also known as tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 14) belongs to the TNF  
superfamily and is expressed by activated T cells, monocytes, macrophages and additional types 
of antigen presenting cells. LIGHT has a key role in the communication system which controls 
immune response. LIGHT activates two key receptors, HVEM and lymphotoxin β receptor 
(LTβR), both expressed on lung epithelial cells. Early in infection, LIGHT released from neutrophils and macrophages bind cellular receptors, which causes inflammatory cell infiltration, 
releasing high level of TNF. LIGHT also has a co-stimulatory role in T cell activation driving 
proinflammatory and tissue damaging effects (Ware, 2008; Ware, 2009). An additional receptor 
for LIGHT is a decoy receptor 3 (DcR3), which binds LIGHT and interferes with its activity by competing with receptor binding (Steinberg et al, 2009; Wroblewski et al, 2003). In hyper 
inflammation and cytokine storm conditions, DcR3 is likely to be overwhelmed, generating high 
DcR3-free (active) LIGHT. 
Rationale for CERC-002, an anti-LIGHT antibody, in COVID-19 
While a primary focus of treatment of COVID‐19 is the development of appropriate antiviral and 
vaccination approaches, currently no established therapy exists. Agents targeting cytokine storm 
include cytokine‐directed therapies, including interleukin (IL)‐1 and IL‐6 antagonists; however, 
Aevi Genomic Medicine, LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  12 Aug  2020 
CERC- 002-CVID -201 Version: 4.0 Page 21 of 51 
 
  there is no established single therapy for the treatment and/or prevention of acute lung injury 
associated with cytokine storm. The development of a safe and effective therapy for 
COVID-19-associated acute lung injury and ARDS could significantly reduce the mortality and 
post-infectious morbidity of this global pandemic and alleviate the severe strain placed on 
healthcare systems. 
LIGHT protein has been reported to be elevated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
of patients presenting severe pneumonia caused by viral infection. LIGHT levels correlate with 
disease severity; as disease progresses from minor to severe, LIGHT levels are elevated 
(Xu et al, 2019). In humans, LIGHT is functionally neutralized by DcR3, which tightly binds 
LIGHT and inhibits its interactions with HVEM and LTβR.   
CERC-002 (formerly AEVI-002, MDGN-002) is an anti-LIGHT, fully human, monoclonal 
antibody (MAb), which binds to LIGHT at the DcR3 binding site. It is anticipated that neutralizing 
LIGHT using CERC-002 may be beneficial in COVID-19 infected patients with impending 
respiratory failure. The present study will evaluate the effect of CERC-002 on prevention of ARDS 
in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and acute lung injury. 
6.2 Nonclinical Experience 
CERC-002 is a fully human immunoglobulin G subclass 4 (IgG4) MAb specific to human LIGHT. 
CERC-002 binds human and cynomolgus monkey LIGHT with high affinity; there was no 
apparent binding of CERC-002 to LIGHT from any other species tested. In vitro, LIGHT-mediated 
chemokine release is comparably inhibited by CERC-002 in a human or cynomolgus cell line. 
Based on these data, the monkey is considered to be the only relevant species for toxicological 
evaluation of CERC-002, and all toxicology studies are performed in cynomolgus monkeys. 
CERC-002 does not demonstrate any potential for off-target binding, cytokine release syndrome, 
or cytotoxicity. In a 2-month toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys using doses of 6, 30, and 
60 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) administered every 2 weeks, CERC-002 was well tolerated at all 
doses. Ventricular premature complexes were observed in 3 animals during electrocardiogram 
(ECG) evaluation; however, attribution to treatment is considered unlikely. The only test 
article-related microscopic finding was a minimal increase in incidence and severity of multifocal 
lymphocytic infiltration around small hypodermal vessels at the sites of SC administration and 
adjacent inguinal areas at 60 mg/kg per dose. As this finding is considered non-adverse, the no observed adverse effect level was the high dose of 60 mg/kg per dose. 
Toxicokinetic results showed that all dosed cynomolgus monkeys were exposed to CERC-002. 
CERC-002 was slowly absorbed with a time to maximum observed concentration (t
max) of 
approximately 24 to 144 hours. CERC-002 exposures increased in a less than dose-proportional manner, and CERC-002 exposure increased slightly during treatment. At the 60 mg/kg dose the 
maximum observed concentration (C
max) was 1,730 and 1,620 μg/mL, and the area under the curve 
(AUC) was 343,000 and 388,000 μg•h/mL for male and female cynomolgus monkeys, respectively. No significant gender effect was observed. 
Anti-CERC-002 antibodies were observed in drug-treated animals on Day 15 (6 of 10 at 6 mg/kg 
per dose; 3 of 10 at 30 mg/kg per dose; and 1 of 10 at 60 mg/kg per dose); and at Day 57 (3 of 4 
at 6 mg/kg per dose, 1 of 4 at 30 mg/kg per dose, and 0 of 4 at 60 mg/kg per dose). There was no 
clear impact of antidrug antibodies on CERC-002 toxicokinetics and exposure.

CERC- 002-CVID -201 Version: 4.0 Page 22 of 51 
 
  In vitro functional assays were conducted to examine the effect of CERC-002 on secretion of 
Regulated upon Activation, Normal T cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES) from cynomolgus 
monkey skin fibroblast cells stimulated with soluble recombinant cynomolgus LIGHT protein. 
CERC-002 inhibited cynomolgus LIGHT-induced secretion of RANTES from cynomolgus skin 
fibroblasts in a concentration-dependent manner with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 
5.67 nM.  
In the toxicokinetic study in cynomolgus monkeys, results indicated that a CERC-002:LIGHT 
molar ratio of 1:2 was sufficient to inhibit LIGHT activity. All animals in the toxicology study had 
serum LIGHT concentrations below the limit of detection (62.5 pg/mL) prior to the start and at the 
end of the dosing period. The lowest serum CERC-002 concentration recorded in the 6 mg/kg per 
dose group on Day 15 (prior to administration of the second CERC-002 dose) was 26 μg/mL, 
indicating that at least a 6.9×104:1 molar ratio of CERC-002:soluble LIGHT in blood was 
maintained throughout the study. The concentration of CERC-002 in tissue is expected to be 10% 
to 50% of that observed in blood (4); therefore, the molar ratio of CERC 002:soluble LIGHT in 
tissue is anticipated to be at least 6.9×103:1. Given the low basal expression of membrane-bound 
LIGHT, the considerable molar excess of CERC-002 would also be anticipated to saturate membrane-bound LIGHT.  
In secondary pharmacology studies, CERC-002 did not induce antibody dependent cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity, did not promote complement dependent cytotoxicity and did not significantly induce 
IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, interferon gamma (IFN-γ), IL-4, or TNFα relative to unstimulated PBMCs or 
whole blood. Air-dried CERC-002 did induce IL-8 in PBMCs, but not in whole blood, and to a 
lesser extent than did IgG4 or anti CD3 or phorbol myristate acetate plus ionomycin positive 
controls. Wet bound CERC-002 did not induce significant levels of IL-8. Plate-bound CERC-002 
did not significantly alter PBMC viability nor induce proliferation relative to unstimulated PBMCs 
at any of the concentrations tested. 
6.3 Clinical Experience 
One study (SAR252067-TDU11937) of CERC-002 in humans has been conducted. 
SAR252067-TDU11937 was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
of the tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ascending, single, SC doses of CERC-002 in 
healthy subjects. Subjects were healthy adult males and females 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive, 
who received a single SC doses of 40, 120, 300, 600, 900, or 1200 mg CERC-002 on Day 0 as 
determined by the dose escalation schedule. A total of 48 subjects, 8 subjects per dose group (6 active and 2 placebo), were enrolled.  
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), abnormal vital signs, ECG parameters and 
laboratory values were relatively infrequent in all dose groups and there were no apparent 
dose-dependent differences among the dose groups. There were no clinically important local 
tolerability issues in any dose group. There were no clinically significant immunogenicity findings. 
CERC-002 was absorbed with the median t
max ranging from 5.0 to 8.5 days and eliminated with 
the mean terminal half-life (t 1/2) ranging from 18.0 days to 27.0 days. 
CERC-002 exposure increased in a close-to-dose-proportional manner, with a 30-fold increase 
over the entire dose range of 40 to 1200 mg resulting in 25.7-, 28.2-, and 29.1-fold increases in 
geometric mean C max, area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to the 
last observed concentration (AUC 0-tau), and AUC, respectively.

CERC- 002-CVID -201 Version: 4.0 Page 23 of 51 
 
  A Phase 1b, dose escalating, open-label, signal-finding study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, 
and short-term efficacy of CERC-002 in adults with moderate to severe active Crohn's disease who 
previously failed treatment with an anti-TNFα agent, with and without loss of function mutations 
in DcR3 is currently ongoing.  
6.4 Summary of Potential Risks and Benefits 
The potential benefit of study participation is that subjects with COVID-19 pneumonia and acute 
lung injury may not progress to ARDS after receiving treatment with CERC-002. Subjects will 
also understand that they are contributing to the scientific knowledge that may lead to expansion of the treatment options for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and acute lung injury. No other 
benefits of participation are anticipated. 
The potential risks of study participation include those associated with exposure to CERC-002 and 
the risks of medical evaluation, including subcutaneous administration of study treatment. 
A summary of the pharmaceutical properties and known potential risks of CERC-002 is provided 
in the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). The investigator must become familiar 
with all sections of the CERC-002 IB before the start of the study.

8 STUDY DESIGN 
8.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, Phase 2 clinical trial in adults with documented 
COVID-19 pneumonia and acute lung injury. Subjects will receive either CERC-002 at a dose of 
16 mg/kg (maximum 1200 mg) SC or placebo at baseline (Day 1) in addition to standard of care.  
The standard of care is to be maintained throughout the study and may include off-label use of other drugs, devices, or interventions used to treat COVID-19. All subjects will be followed until 
the end of study (Day 60) for safety monitoring. The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed 
within 4 weeks after the dose is administered. CERC-002 or placebo treatment will be administered 
on Day 1 and the duration of the study period will be 60 days. 
Approximately 82 subjects are planned to be included and dosed with either CERC-002 or placebo 
in addition to their standard of care in this study.  Subjects must have a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection through an approved testing method and 
have been hospitalized due to a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia with acute lung injury defined as 
diffuse bilateral radiographic infiltrates with PaO2/FiO2 >100 and <300 and if available, have 
oxygen saturation at rest in ambient air <93%. Subject will not be eligible if they are intubated, are currently taking immunomodulating or 
anti-rejection drugs, has been administered an immunomodulating drug with 60 days of baseline, 
are in septic shock despite adequate volume resuscitation, have alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT )/aspartate aminotransferase ( AST) >5× upper limit of normal (ULN),  creatinine >2.5 mg/dl, 
Aevi Genomic Medicine, LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  12 Aug  2020 
CERC- 002-CVID -201 Version: 4.0 Page 25 of 51 
 
  neutrophils <500/ml3, or platelets <50,000/ml3. The use of corticosteroids as part of standard of 
care measures in severe COVID-19 patients is permitted when clinically indicated and discussed 
with the Medical Monitor. 
An external, independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review the study data at 
intervals defined in the DMC charter and will monitor the trial for safety signals.  
All subjects will undergo efficacy, PK, PD, and immunogenicity assessments. All subjects will be 
monitored for AEs and will undergo physical exams, ECG, and routine safety laboratory tests. The 
PK of CERC-002 will be based on plasma levels obtained at various time points after administration, and the PD will be based on LIGHT levels and InflammationMAP.  
8.2 Discussion of Study Design 
This study will determine the efficacy and safety of CERC-002 compared with placebo in addition 
to standard of care, administered SC in subjects with COVID-19 pneumonia and acute lung injury. 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of CERC-002 on prevention of ARDS 
in adults with COVID-19 pneumonia and acute lung injury. The efficacy of CERC-002 will be determined by measuring PaO2/FiO2; alive, respiratory failure days; alive ventilator-free days; ICU and hospital length of stay; return to room air or baseline oxygen requirement; SOFA score; 
body temperature; viral load in nasopharyngeal aspirates; time to invasive ventilation; and duration 
of ventilation support. These are routinely used and accepted methods to assess respiratory functions. The study will also assess 1-month mortality rate, apart from other parameters.  
8.3 Study Sites 
The study will take place at approximately 10 study sites in the US. 8.4 Selection of Study Population 
Approximately 82 adults diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and acute lung injury will be 
enrolled in the study.

• Specified unblinded pharmacist(s) from the hospital who will have access to the randomization code in order to prepare the investigational product.   
The unblinded pharmacist(s) and unblinded statistician will not otherwise participate in the study 
or data analysis prior to unblinding of the study. 
Treatment unblinding is discouraged if knowledge of the treatment assignment will not materially 
change the planned management of a medical emergency.  Unblinding is permitted in a medical 
emergency that requires immediate knowledge of the subject’s treatment assignment. Whenever 
possible unblinding should be discussed with the Sponsor Medical Monitor.  For emergency 
unblinding the Investigator will contact the unblinded pharmacist(s). If the Investigator is not able to discuss treatment unblinding in advance, then they should notify the Sponsor Medical Monitor 
as soon as possible about the unblinding incident without revealing the subject’s treatment assignment.  The Investigator or designee must record the date and reason for study discontinuation 
on the appropriate eCRF for that subject.  In all cases that are not emergencies, the Investigator should discuss the event with the Sponsor Medical Monitor prior to unblinding the subject’s 
treatment assignment.

  If the treatment assignment is unblinded for an individual subject, the Investigator will be notified 
of that subject’s treatment assignment without unblinding the treatment assignments for the 
remaining subjects in the study.  The Investigator will make this decision after consultation with 
the Sponsor Medical Monitor.   
9.7 Selection of Doses in the Study 
The dose of 16 mg/kg (maximum dose of 1200 mg) was selected in an effort to maximize the 
ability to achieve the blockade of LIGHT while ensuring patient safety.  In a robust toxicology 
program CERC-002 was dosed as high as 100 mg/kg in monkeys and was well tolerated while the 
NOAEL was determined to be 60 mg/kg.  In dosing in humans, CERC-002 was safe and well 
tolerated in single ascending doses up to 1200 mg in healthy volunteers.  There were no clinically 
meaningful treatment-emergent adverse events or changes in ECG parameters or laboratory 
values.  A safety review committee will be analyzing data from individual subjects and across all 
subjects treated in a daily fashion to assess any safety signals with dosing.   
9.8 Dose Adjustment Criteria 
No dose adjustments are allowed.  9.9 Drug Accountability 
The investigator must ensure that adequate records showing the receipt, dispensing, or other 
disposition of the investigational product including the date, lot identifier, dosage, volume 
administered to each subject, and identification of subjects (subject number and initials) who 
received the investigational product are maintained by an unblinded pharmacist. The investigator 
will not supply the investigational product to any person except those named as subinvestigators 
on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Form FDA 1572 and designated study personnel, 
and subjects in this study. The investigator will not dispense the investigational product from any 
study locations other than those listed on Form FDA 1572. If any of the investigational product is 
not dispensed, is lost, stolen, spilled, unusable, or received in a damaged container, this 
information must be documented and reported to Aevi Genomic Medicine, LLC and appropriate 
regulatory agencies, as required. 
Upon completion of the study, unused investigational product must be left in the original 
packaging for final disposition by the sponsor or per the site’s standard practice. Any partially used 
investigational product and all empty packaging (e.g., vials) must also be saved for final 
disposition by the sponsor, returned to the sponsor’s designee for destruction, or per the site’s 
standard practice. 
9.10 Handling and Disposal 
Investigational product reconciliation must be performed at the site by the unblinded pharmacist(s) 
using treatment log forms and documented on the site’s investigational product inventory. 
After reconciliation authorization by the sponsor, all used, partially used, and unused vials and all 
original packaging will be disposed of by the sponsor or per the site’s standard practice. This 
process will be provided to the site by the sponsor’s designee.

10.2.2.2.1 Specimen Handling Requirements 
The transmission of infectious agents may occur through contact with contaminated needles and 
blood or blood products. Consequently, appropriate blood and body fluid precautions should be 
employed by all study personnel involved in the collection of blood and handling of specimens in 
both the clinic and laboratory settings. Refer to current recommendations of the appropriate 
authorities. 
Aevi Genomic Medicine, LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  12 Aug  2020 
CERC- 002-CVID -201 Version: 4.0 Page 33 of 51 
In addition to appropriate handling of subject samples, specific regulations exist regarding the 
shipment of biologic/etiologic samples. Procedures and regulations for the packaging and shipping 
of infectious samples are outlined in the site and/or study laboratory manual. The investigator is 
responsible for ensuring that all study samples that are to be transported to another location are 
appropriately packed and shipped per the applicable regulations. 
10.2.2.2.2  Evaluation of Laboratory Values 
The normal ranges of values for the laboratory assessments in this study will be provided by the 
local laboratory of each hospital. They will be regarded as the reference ranges on which decisions 
will be made for the specific site. 
If a laboratory value is out of the reference range, it is not necessarily clinically relevant. The 
investigator must evaluate the out-of-range values and record his/her assessment of the clinical 
relevance in the subject’s source documentation. 
All laboratory values which, in the investigator’s opinion, show clinically relevant or pathological 
changes during or after termination of the treatment are to be discussed with the medical monitor, 
as necessary, and reported as AEs and followed, as described in Section 10.3.1. 
All measurements described in this section are recognized standard methods. 
10.2.2.3  Clinical Examinations 
10.2.2.3.1  Blood Pressure, Pulse Rate, Respiratory Rate, Temperature, Height, and Body 
Weight 
Blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, temperature, height, and body weight are considered 
standard of care and will be performed per the site’s practice. Additional blood pressure and pulse 
rate measurements may be performed, as determined by the investigator, to ensure appropriate 
monitoring of subject safety and accurate recording of vital sign measurements. Any changes from 
baseline which are deemed clinically significant by the investigator are to be recorded as an AE.  
10.2.2.3.2  Electrocardiogram 
A standard 12-lead ECG is considered standard of care and will be performed daily for those who 
are not being assessed by cardiac monitor. They will be performed per the site’s practice unless 
defined otherwise in Table 2. All ECG recordings will be identified with the subject 
number, subject 
initials, date, and time of the recording and a copy will be included with the 
subject’s source documentation. All ECGs will be performed using the equipment 
supplied by the investigational site.  
Electronic ECG tracings will be analyzed per the site’s practice. In addition, the investigator’s 
assessment of the ECG tracing as normal or abnormal must be documented, and if abnormal, 
his/her determination of whether the abnormality is clinically significant or not will be documented 
on the tracing.  All ECGs collected are to be entered into the eCRF.  
All ECG values which, in the investigator’s opinion, show clinically relevant or pathological 
changes during or after termination of the treatment are to be discussed with the Sponsor Medical 
Monitor and reported as AEs and followed, as described in Section 10.3.1 .

A complete physical examination is considered standard of care and will be performed per the 
site’s practice unless defined otherwise in Table 2. Any clinically significant physical 
examination findings are to be and reported as AEs and followed, as described in Section 10.3.1 . 
10.2.2.4  Adverse Events 
The definitions and management of and special considerations for AEs are provided in 
Section 10.4.1. 
The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria 
and definition of an AE or SAE described previously. Any clinically relevant observations made 
during the period of hospitalization will also be considered AEs. 
10.2.3  Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity Analyses 
Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected on Day 2 at 24 hours (±2 hours) post dose and at 
any time on Days 8, 14 and 28. Blood samples for ADA analysis will be collected at any time on 
Days 8, 14 and 28. Additionally, a sample will be collected when an immunologically related 
adverse event is reported.  Samples will be processed to plasma (see the Laboratory Manual). Time 
of PK samples will be recorded in the eCRF. A total of 1.0 mL plasma per PK and ADA sample 
will be collected from each subject to measure plasma concentrations of CERC-002 and ADAs. 
Pharmacokinetic and ADA samples will be processed according to the methods and directions set 
forward in the Laboratory Manual(s) and guidance(s). Pharmacokinetic and ADA plasma sample 
analysis will be performed by laboratory defined in the Laboratory Manual(s) and guidance(s), 
according to their standard operating procedures (SOPs) using a validated enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Assay and analysis details will be described in the method 
validation and bioanalytical information. 
10.2.4  Pharmacodynamics 
Blood samples will be collected for exploratory analyses. Exploratory analyses may include but 
are not limited to LIGHT levels and InflammationMAP as specified in Table 1. 
Exploratory biomarker analyses will be performed at the laboratories specified in the 
Laboratory Manual(s) and guidance(s). 
10.3 Definition of Adverse Events, Period of Observation, Recording of Adverse Events 
10.3.1  Adverse Event Collection 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
the product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a new, 
clinically important abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated 
with the product, whether related to the product. An AE will be considered treatment-emergent if 
it occurs after the first dose of investigational product and within 30 days of a subject’s last dose 
of investigational product.  
All
 AEs are collected from the time of the informed consent is signed until the end of study 
(Day 60). This includes events occurring regardless of whether investigational product is 
administered. Where possible, a diagnosis rather than a list of symptoms should be recorded. If a 
diagnosis has not been made, then each symptom should be listed individually. All AEs should be 
Aevi Genomic Medicine, LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  12 Aug  2020 
CERC- 002-CVID -201 Version: 4.0 Page 35 of 51 
 
  captured on the appropriate AE pages in the eCRF and in source documents. In addition, to 
untoward AEs, unexpected benefits outside the investigational product indication should also be 
captured in the source documents and AE eCRF.  
All AEs must be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returned to his/her baseline status or 
all variable have returned to normal), regardless of whether the subject is still participating in the 
study. Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization achieved (the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event), or the event is otherwise explained. 
When appropriate, medical tests and examinations are performed so that resolution of an event(s) 
can be documented.  
10.3.2 Severity of Adverse Events 
The severity of AEs must be recorded during the course of the event including the start and stop 
dates for each change in severity. An event that changes in severity should be captured as a new 
event. Worsening of a pre-treatment events, after initiation of investigational product must be 
recorded as new AEs. For example, if the subject experiences mild, intermittent headaches prior 
to dosing with investigational product; however, the headache intensity increases to moderate after the first dose of investigational product, a new AE of moderate intermittent headaches is to be recorded in the source documents and eCRF.   
The medical assessment of clinical severity of an AE will be determined using the definitions 
outlined in Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0 (Published 
November 27, 2017 by the US Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of 
Health, National Cancer Institute): 
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; or clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
or intervention not indicated  
Grade 2 Moderate; or minimal, local or non-invasive intervention indicated; or limiting age-
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) 
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; or hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; or disabling; or limiting 
self-care ADL  
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; or urgent intervention indicated 
Grade 5 Death related to AE 
Please refer to the above-referenced CTCAE document for full description of CTCAE terms and 
instrumental and self-care ADLs. It is important to distinguish between severe AEs and SAEs. 
Severity is a classification of intensity whereas an SAE is an AE that meets serious criteria, as 
described in Section 10.3.4.3. 
10.3.3 Relationship Categorization 
A physician investigator must make the assessment of relationship to investigational product for 
each AE. The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product. If there 
is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not related”. 
Aevi Genomic Medicine, LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  12 Aug  2020 
CERC- 002-CVID -201 Version: 4.0 Page 36 of 51 
Otherwise, the AE should be categorized per the guidelines below. The causality assessment must 
be documented in the source document and the eCRF (Table 5 ).  
Table 5: Assessment of Relationship to Investigational Product  
Relationship  Description  
Not Related  Exposure to investigational product  has not occurred.  
OR 
The administration of investigational product  and the occurrence of the AE are not 
reasonably related in time  
OR  
The AE is considered likely to be related to an etiology other than the use of the investigational product , that is, there are no facts/eviden ce or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship to the investigational product .  
Possibly Related  The administration of the investigational product  and the occurrence of the AE are 
reasonably related in time.  
AND  
The AE could not be explained equally well by factors or causes other than exposure to 
investigational product  
Probably Related The administration of investigational product  and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably 
related in time.  
AND  
The AE is more likely explained by exposure to investigational product  than by other factors 
or causes.  
AE = adverse event. 
10.3.3.1 Outcome at the Time of Last Observation 
The outcome at the time of last observation will be classified as: 
•Recovered/resolved
•Recovered/resolved with sequelae
•Recovering/resolving
•Not recovered/not resolved
•Fatal*
•Unknown
*See Section 10.3.5.
10.3.4 Serious Adverse Events
10.3.4.1 Investigational Product Safety Information
The IB is the reference document for safety information pertaining to this study. The IB is provided 
separately. 10.3.4.2 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
Initial and follow-up SAE reports must be completed by the investigator or designee and sent to 
the CRO within 24 hours of the first awareness of an SAE.  The investigator or designee must 
complete, sign and date the appropriate SAE form and verify the accuracy of the information against corresponding source documents. This information is to be sent to the CRO 
Pharmacovigilance Department by e-mail or fax at one of the methods noted below. For questions 
Aevi Genomic Medicine, LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  12 Aug  2020 
CERC- 002-CVID -201 Version: 4.0 Page 38 of 51 
 
  10.3.4.5 Serious Adverse Event Onset and Resolution Dates 
The onset date of the SAE is defined as the date the event meets serious criteria. The resolution 
date is the date the event no longer meets serious criteria, the date symptoms resolve, or the event 
is considered chronic. In the case of hospitalization, the hospital admission and discharge dates are 
considered respectively, the onset and resolution date of the SAE.  
Any signs or symptoms experienced by the subject after signing the informed consent form and 
assent form (if applicable), or leading up to the onset date of the SAE or following the resolution 
date of the SAE must be recorded as an AE.  
10.3.5 Fatal Outcome 
Fatal should only be selected as an outcome when the AE results in death. If more than 1 AE is 
possibly related to the subject’s death, the outcome of death should be indicated for each such AE.  
Any AE that results in the subject’s death must have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of 
death recorded as the resolution date. AEs resulting in death must be reported within 24 hours as 
a SAE, if not already reported as such. In the event of a subject’s death, data should be collected 
on whether the death occurred after the withdrawal of care and, if so, the reason for the withdrawal of care.  
For other AEs,  ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s death, the 
outcome should be considered not resolved, without a resolution date recorded.  10.4 Special Considerations 
10.4.1 Adverse Events of Special Interest 
There are no events from research to date which qualify as AEs of special interest. Adverse drug 
reactions observed in a CERC-002 pre-clinical study as well as reactions with other biologic agents 
include:   
CERC-002 pre-clinical observation: 
• Injection site reactions 
Observations for other biologic agents:  
• Potential for increased infection (including opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis) 
• Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) 
• Immunogenicity 
• Malignancy 
• Impaired immunization 
Any new infection that occurs on study, regardless of the infecting agent (i.e. viral or non-viral), 
should be captured. Additionally, the site of infection and source of culture (bronchoalveolar 
lavage, tracheal aspirate, sputum, blood, urine etc.) should be captured.  
Please refer to the IB for further details on possible risks and adverse drug reactions.  
10.4.2 Pregnancy 
All females of childbearing potential who participate in the study should be counseled on the need 
to practice adequate birth control and on the importance of avoiding pregnancy during study 
Aevi Genomic Medicine, LLC  CONFIDENTIAL  12 Aug  2020 
CERC- 002-CVID -201 Version: 4.0 Page 39 of 51 
participation. Females should be instructed to contact the investigator or study staff immediately 
if pregnancy occurs or is suspected. 
Pregnancy testing will be conducted on females of childbearing potential at baseline. A female 
who is found to be pregnant at baseline will be excluded from the study and considered to be a 
screening failure. A female who is found to be pregnant after the dosing is required to be 
discontinued from the study and the end of study visit assessments performed as soon as possible 
after learning of the pregnancy.   
The investigator must report the pregnancy of any female (study participant or female partner of 
male study participant) who becomes pregnant during investigational product treatment or within 
60 days of being randomized and receiving the investigational product. The pregnancy must be 
reported within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy to the CRO using the Pregnancy Data 
Collection Form via the same fax and email address as for SAE reporting. The investigator should 
contact the designated individual(s) who receive SAE notification and record information related 
to the pregnancy on an Exposure in Utero form/other designated form provided by the sponsor or 
its designee. 
The investigator is also responsible for following the pregnancy until delivery or termination. 
These findings must be reported on the Pregnancy Data Collection Form and forwarded to the 
designated individual(s). The event meets the SAE criterion only if it results in a spontaneous 
abortion or a congenital anomaly. 
10.4.3  Anaphylaxis 
Any AE that represents an anaphylactic reaction should be classified using the definitions provide 
in Sampson et al, 2006 and shown in Table 6 . 
Table 6: Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis  
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled:  
1.Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg,
generalized hives, pruritus or  flushing, swollen lips -tongue- uvula)
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING
a. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia)
b. Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope,
incontinence)  
2.Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that patient (minutes to
several hours):
a. Involvement of the skin -mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen lips -tongue -uvula)
b. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF , hypoxemia)
c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)
3.Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours):
a. Infants and children: low systolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% decrease in systolic BP*
b. Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that person’s baseline
Abbreviations: Peak expiratory flow ; BP = blood pressure 
*Low systolic blood pressure for children is defined as less than 70 mm Hg from 1 month to 1 year, less tha n
(70  mm   Hg  +  [2 x  age]) from 1 to 10 years,  and less than 90 mm Hg from 11 to 17 years.

  10.4.4 Reporting to Regulatory Agency, Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee 
(EC) and Site 
The sponsor or its designee is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities and if applicable, US central institutional review board (IRB) of related, unexpected SAEs. 
In addition, the sponsor and the CRO are responsible for notifying active sites of all related, 
unexpected SAEs occurring during all interventional studies across the development program.  
The investigator is responsible for notifying the local IRB, local ethics committee (EC), or the 
relevant local regulatory authority of all SAEs that occur at his/her site, as required.  
11 SAFETY REVIEW COMMITTEE 
A safety review committee will be analyzing data from individual subjects and across all subjects 
treated in a daily fashion to assess any safety signals with dosing.  This will allow close monitoring 
of safety changes in real time
. 
12 DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE 
An external, independent DMC comprising physicians, scientists and a biostatistician will revie w 
the study data at intervals defined in the DMC charter and will monitor the trial for safety signals.  
Safety monitoring will be performed continuously throughout the study in accordance with this 
protocol. The DMC’s role is to protect the interests of the subjects in the study and those still to 
be entered in the study by reviewing cumulative data. The DMC’s meeting schedule may be 
adjusted based on recommendations made by the DMC, the amount of incremental safety data, 
and other practical considerations. The data provided to the DMC may not be monitored and will 
not be considered “clean” until the database is locked at the completion of the study. 
Data Monitoring Committee recommendation will be documented in meeting minutes which will 
include, at a minimum: 
• List of meeting participants 
• Summary of data considered during the meeting 
• Summary of the DMC recommendation(s)  
The sponsor is responsible for the decision to continue, modify or terminate the study. A copy of 
the DMC meeting recommendation and sponsor decision will be sent to the study sites. 
13 STATISTICS 
13.1 Sample Size Determination 
A total of 82 subjects are planned to be randomized to one of two treatment groups (CERC-002 or 
placebo in addition to standard of care) in a 1:1 ratio. This sample size will provide greater than 
80% power to detect a difference of 0.25 in the proportion of subjects alive and free of respiratory 
failure using a Chi-square exact test at a one-sided significance level of 0.05. This calculation 
assumes that the proportion alive and free of respiratory failure will be 0.60 in the placebo group 
and 0.85 in the CERC-002 group.

  subject’s rights and responsibilities. A copy of the informed consent and assent documentation 
(if applicable [such as a complete set of subject information sheets and fully executed signature 
pages]) must be given to the subject. This document may require translation into local language. 
Signed consent/assent forms must remain in each subject’s study file and must be available for 
verification at any time.  
The principal investigator provides the sponsor with a copy of the consent and assent (as 
applicable) form which was reviewed by the IRB/EC and which received favorable 
opinion/approval. A copy of the IRB/EC’s written favorable opinion/approval of these documents 
must be provided to the sponsor, prior to the start of the study unless it is agreed to and documented 
(abiding by regulatory guidelines and national requirements) prior to the study start that another 
party (such as the sponsor or coordinating principal investigator) is responsible for this action. If 
the IRB/EC requires modification of the sample subject information and consent document 
provided by the sponsor, the documentation supporting this requirement must be provided to the sponsor.  
16.3 Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committees 
A properly constituted, valid IRB/EC according to local laws and regulations must review and 
approve the protocol, the investigator’s informed consent and assent (as applicable) document, and 
related subject information and any other study materials requiring review (such as recruitment 
information) before the start of the study. 
Until written approval by the IRB has been received by the investigator, no subject may undergo 
any study procedure solely for determining eligibility for this study. Investigational product will 
not be released until the sponsor or its designee has received written IRB/EC approval. 
Prior to implementing changes in the study, the sponsor and the IRB/EC must approve and provide 
documentation of favorable opinion/approval of any revisions to informed consent documents and amendments to the protocol unless there is a subject safety issue.  
Depending on location (outside European Union [EU] or inside EU) the IRB/EC will be apprised 
of the progress of the study and of any changes made to the protocol at least yearly. This may be 
done by the investigator (outside EU and in some cases, inside EU) or the sponsor (in some cases inside EU). These updates include information on any serious or significant AEs.  
Upon study completion, the investigator will provide the IRB/EC with final report/summary as 
required.  
16.4 Financial Disclosure 
The investigator is required to disclose any financial arrangement during the study and for 1 year 
after where the outcome of the study could be influenced by the value of the compensation for 
conducting the study, or other payments the investigator received from the sponsor. The following 
information is collected: any significant payments from sponsor or subsidiaries such as grant to 
fund ongoing research, compensation in the form of equipment, retainer for ongoing consulting or 
honoraria; any proprietary interest in investigational product; any significant equity interest in the sponsor or subsidiaries as defined in 21 CFR 54 (b) (1998).

Name of Sponsor: Esperion Therapeutics, Inc.  
Title of Study:  
A Randomized, Double-Blind, Parallel Group Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Bempedoic 
Acid 180 mg  + Ezetimibe 10 mg  Fixed -Dose Combination Compared to Bempedoic Acid, Ezetimibe, and 
Placebo Alone in Patients Treated with Maximally Tolerated Statin Therapy  
Study Number:  1002FDC-053  
Phase of Development:  3  
Clinical Sites:  Approximately 125 sites located in North America  
Primary Objective:  
The co -primary objectives are to assess low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL -C) lowering efficacy in 
patients receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy and treated for 12  weeks with bempedoic acid ( BA) 
180 mg  + ezetimibe ( EZE) 10 mg  fixed-dose combination ( FDC ) versus each of the following:  
• Placebo  
• BA 180 mg    
• EZE 10 mg 
Secondary Objectives: 
• To assess the efficacy of BA  180 mg  + EZE 10 mg FDC versus placebo alone, BA alone, and 
EZE alone on h igh-sensitivity C -reactive protein (hs-CRP ), high -density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(HDL -C), non- HDL -C, total cholesterol ( TC), triglycerides ( TG), and apolipoprotein B (apoB) 
after 12  weeks of treatment ; 
• To characterize the safety and tolerability of BA 180 mg  + EZE 10 mg FDC versus placebo 
alone, BA alone, and EZE alone through  12 weeks of treatment . 
Exploratory Objectives:  
• To assess the efficacy BA 180 mg  + EZE 10 mg FDC versus placebo alone, BA alone, and EZE 
alone on percent age of patients attaining  LDL -C <70  mg/dL after 12 weeks of treatment ; 
• To characterize the plasma trough concentrations of BA and/or EZE when administered as BA 
180 mg  + EZE 10  mg FDC , BA alone, and EZE alone . 
Study Design:   
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter study of BA  + EZE versus its 
individual components and placebo. Screening (S1) will occur within approximately 2 weeks prior to randomization.  Patients who are deemed not eligible for randomization at any point during screening will 
be notified by clinical site perso nnel regarding their eligibility status and considered screen failures.  
Approximately 350 eligible patients will be randomized 2:2:2:1 on Day 1/Week  0 (T1) to receive either 
BA 180 mg  + EZE 10 mg FDC  (N = 100), BA 180 mg  (n = 100 ), EZE 10 mg  (n = 100) or placebo 
(n = 50) for 12 weeks.  Randomized patients will return for clinic visits at Week  4 (T2), Week  8 (T3), and 
Week 12 (T4).   Patients who withdraw from investigational medicinal product (IMP) treatment will be 
asked to continue to be followed for safety and efficacy using the protocol- specified visit schedule and 
procedures.

Confidential Page 3 of 116 Eligible patients will have 1) documented atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD),  and/or  
2) heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and/or 3)  multiple cardiovascular risk factors an d 
will require additional LDL -C lowering therapy despite receiving maximally tolerated statin background 
therapy.  Maximally tolerated statin therapy may include statin regimens other than daily dosing or no 
statin at all (if not tolerated) ; please note that simvastatin ≥40 mg/day is prohibited.  A patient’s currently 
used and maximally tolerated statin therapy will be determined by the investigator based on their medical judgment and local standard of care.  Available sources,  including the patient’s self -reported history of 
lipid-modifying therapy will also be considered.   
Patients will be stratified based on baseline/current statin intensity (high intensity statin versus other) and 
disease characteristics (ASCVD and/or HeFH versus multiple cardiovascular [ CV] risk factors).  High 
intensity statin includes atorvastatin 40 -80 mg/day and rosuvastatin 20-40 mg/day, all others will be 
categorized as ‘other’ for randomization and stratification purposes.  Definition of ASCVD and/or HeFH 
or multiple CV risk factors are provided in inclusion criteria.  Enrollment will be monitored and a cap 
may be placed, if necessary, to ensure appropriate distribution into either of the statin intensity categories. 
 
For details  of study assessments, see the Appendix  1, Schedule of Events.  
Number of Patients (Planned):  Approximately 3 50 adult male and female patients.  
Duration of Study:  Total study duration will be approximately 14 weeks ( 2 weeks [up to 16 days] of 
screening and 12 weeks of treatment) .

Statistical Methods:  
Sample Size  
The sample size of 100  patients per active treatment group and 50  placebo patients (2:2:2:1) in this study 
(350 patients total) is selected to provide adequate power for each of the co -primary endpoint as well as 
the co -primary endpoint family as a whole.  
Testing Procedures 
The co -primary endpoint family will be tested first, and each co -primary endpoint will be tested at alpha 
level of 0.05.  The testing will stop if any of the co -primary endpoints does not achieve statistical 
significance. The secondary endpoint s will only be tested when ALL of the co- primary endpoints are 
significant.  A hierarchical testing procedure will be implemented within each comparison group on 
selected secondary endpoints.  
Each of the secondary endpoint within a comparison group will be tested only if previous endpoint is 
significant at the alpha level assigned for that comparison group, i.e., via a step-down procedure.  
A schematic representation for the statistical testing of the treatment comparisons and the co -primary and 
secondary efficacy endpoints is provided below.

Analysis Populations 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS), used for all of the efficacy analyses, is defined as all randomized patients. 
The FAS is also known as the intention -to-treat (ITT) set of patients.  Patients in th e FAS will be included 
in their randomized treatment group, regardless of their actual treatment.  
The Safety Population (SP), used for all of the safety summaries, is defined as all randomized patients who received at least 1  dose of blinded study medication (IMP).  
The PK analysis set (PKS), used for all of the PK -related summaries, is defined as all patients in the SP 
who have at least 1 PK assessment unless major protocol deviations are identified to have affected the PK 
data or if key dosing or sampling information is missing.   
Disposition and Baseline Characteristics  
Disposition, including reason for withdrawal from the IMP and study, will be summarized by treatment 
group.  Demographic information and patient baseline characteristics including, but not limited to, 
gender, race, age, and baseline vital signs will also be summarized by treatment group.  
Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change from baseline to Week  12 in LDL -C.  Baseline is 
defined as the mean of the LD L-C values from Week  -2 (Visit  S1and predose Day  1/Week  0 (Visit  T1).  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with treatment group and randomization stratification as factors and baseline LDL- C as a covariate.   
Missing values for primary endpoint will be imputed using multiple imputation method, taking account 
for the adherence to the treatment.  For patients with missing data and no longer receiving treatment at 
Week 12, their LDL- C will be imputed as their baseline value, for those with missing data but still 
receiving treatment, their LDL -C value will be imputed using a regression model based imputation 
including treatment, stratification factor, baseline LDL- C as auxiliary variables .

For the selected secondary endpoints (percent change from baseline to Week 12 in non- HDL -C, apoB, 
TC, and hsCRP ), the data will be analyzed in the similar fashion as for the primary endpoints and then the 
step-down procedure as det ailed above will be applied to the analysis results for each treatment 
comparison of interest (BA 180 mg  + EZE 10  mg FDC versus placebo; BA 180  mg + EZE 10  mg FDC  
versus BA 180 mg ; BA 180 mg + EZE 10  mg FDC versus EZE 10  mg).  Other secondary endpoints based 
on HDL -C and TG will be analyzed separately outside of the step-down procedure.  For HDL -C, non-
HDL -C, TG, and TC, baseline is defined as the mean of the values from Week  -2 (Visit  S1) and predose 
Day 1/Week  0 (Visit  T1), while baseline for apoB and hs -CRP is the predose Day  1/Week  0 value.  
Safety Analyses 
The summarization of AEs will include only TEAEs, any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or 
disease occurred or worsened in severity since the first dose of the IMP until 30  days after study 
completion  whether or not related to the product.  An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
that occurs at any dose that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability, or results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  TEAEs and SAEs will 
be summarized by system organ class (SOC), severity, and relationship to study drug for each treatment 
group.   
Clinical safety laboratories, including  hematology, blood chemistry, HbA 1C, glucose, and urinalysis; PE 
findings; vital signs; ECG readings; and weight will be summarized by the value and by change from baseline in the value (where appropriate) at each post  baseline time point.

Bempedoic acid (BA) 180  mg + ezetimibe (EZE) 10 -mg fixed -dose combination (FDC) is being 
developed to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL- C). 
Bempedoic acid  (BA; ETC -1002) is an oral, first -in class, small molecule that is currently being 
invest igated in Phase 3 clinical trials as a single agent in patients with primary hyperlipidemia 
who require additional LDL -C lowering.  Bempedoic acid inhibits adenosine triphosphate- citrate 
lyase (ACL), an enzyme upstream of 3 -hydroxy -3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG -CoA) 
reductase in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.  Bempedoic acid , like statins , up-regulate s 
LDL-C receptors .  However, unlike statins, BA  does not inhibit cholesterol synthesis in muscle 
tissue, therefore it is anticipated that negative muscle -related adverse effects associated with 
statin use may be avoided by use of BA .   
Ezetimibe ( EZE; Zetia®) 10 mg  was approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for use to lower LDL -C, total cholesterol (TC), non- high-density 
lipoprotein-cholesterol (non- HDL -C), and apolipoprotein B (ApoB).  Ezetimibe was approved as 
monotherapy and in combination with statins in patients with primary hyperlipidemia, and in 
combination with fenofibrate in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia.  Ezetimibe has been approved as a FDC with more than 1 statin, and is currently marketed as an FDC of EZE  and 
simvastatin (Vytorin
®). 
It is recommended that patients at high risk for future CVD events receive maximally tolerated statin therapy ( Stone 2013; Catap ano 2016) .  Despite receiving maximally tolerated statin 
therapy , many patients require additional therapy to further reduce LDL-C to an acceptable level.  
This Phase 3 study in patients treated with maximally tolerated statin background therapy is being conducted to characterize the magnitude of additional LDL-C lowering with an FDC of 
BA and EZE and to define the contribution to LDL- C lowering of each individual component. 
4.1. Cardiovascular Disease  and LDL -C-Lowering Drugs   
Despite aggressive interventional and pharmacologic therapies, cardiovascular disease ( CVD) is 
the number 1 cause of death globally ( WHO 2015 ).  The Global Burden of Disease study 
estimated that 29.6% of all deaths worldwide (approximately 15.6 million deaths ) were caused 
by CVD in 2010, more than all communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional disorders 
combined, and double the number of deaths caused by cancers ( Nichols 2014) .  In the US , based 
on 2011 death rate data, more than 2150 Americans die from CVD daily, an average of 1 death every 40  seconds ( Mozaffarian 2015) .  Of great concern, approximately 155,000 Americans 
dying from CVD are less than 65  years of age  (Mozaffarian 2015 ).  In Europe , CVD remains the 
most common cause of deaths , resulting in almost 2 times as many deaths as cancer  (Townsend 
2015) . 
Elevated LDL-C is a major modifiable risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis and 
CVD ( Sharrett 2001) .  Evidence supporting LDL-C as a therapeutic target and surrogate for 
cardiovascular (CV) outcomes comes from interventional studies with LDL -C-lowering 
therapies, epidemiological studies, and genetic variants (both gain of function and loss of 
function).  Large randomized clinical studies aimed at lowering LDL-C show a consistent, 
log-linear relationship between LDL-C reduction and CV risk reduction, independent of the

Confidential Page 23 of 116 mechanism for LDL-C lowering ( Kathiresan 2008; Baigent 2010; Robinson 2005; Stamler  1986, 
Silverman 2016) .  A published patient- level meta -analysis including 26 statin trials and more 
than 160,000 participants, showed a consistent relationship between LDL-C reduction and CV  
outcomes ( Baigent 2010) .  This analysis showed that a 1 mmol/L (~39 mg/dL) reduction in 
LDL-C was associated with a 22%  reduction in the 5-year incidence of major coronary events, 
revascularizations, and ischemic strokes.  More recently, a meta-analysis in 312,175 patients 
from 49  trials assessed the relationship between LDL -C reduction and CV outcomes when 
LDL-C reduction was due to statin therapy versus established nonstatin interventions that work 
primarily by upregulation of the LDL receptor such as diet, bile acid sequestrants, ileal bypass, 
and EZE  (Silverman  2016) .  This meta -analysis reported that the r elationship between LDL-C 
reduction and CV outcomes was similar regardless of whether LDL-C reduction was derived 
from statin therapy or nonstatin interventions that upregulate the LDL receptor ( Silverman 
2016).  Thus, LDL-C lowering via upregulation the LDL receptor is largely accepted as a valid 
surrogate endpoint of CV  risk reduction by clinicians and regulatory authorities ( Stone 2013) .  
Statins are central to the LDL-C-lowering strategy and are supported by a large body of data demonstrating robust effectiveness in lowering LDL -C and reducing the risk of CVD 
(Waters  2006, Grundy 2004) .  However, there is increas ing awareness of the limitations and 
risks of statin use.  Many individuals at risk for CVD fail to achieve LDL-C goals  (Martin 2013, 
Virani  2011) .  In 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandated safety -labeling  
changes limiting the use of high dose (80 mg) simvastatin due to safety concerns of muscle 
injury or myopathy ( Egan 2011) .  Although myopathy events are ra re, a more widespread 
problem is various muscle side effects such as pain and weakness, particularly at high doses, leading to poor tolerability and lack of persistence on statin therapy ( Cohen 2012) .  
Other than statins, only a few drugs  are approved to lower LDL-C.  Although LDL-C lowering is 
robust with proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type  9 (PCSK9 ) inhibitors, use of these drugs 
is limited by mode of administration and other accessibility issues.  The oral drug EZE, an 
intestinal cholesterol absorption inhibitor, lowers LDL-C by 18% in patients with primary 
hyperlipidemia  (Knopp 2003) .  Other oral LDL-C- lowering therapies include colesevelam , a bile 
acid sequestrant that lowers LDL-C by up to 18% but is limited by gastrointestinal side effects  
(Insull 2001) , while extended -release niacin in doses up to 2 g lower s LDL -C by up to 17% 
(Goldberg 1998) .  Finally, fenofibrate, an  activator o f peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor 
alpha, lowers LDL-C 
by approximately 20% in patients with hypercholesterolemia  (Knopp 
1987) , but may substantially increase LDL-C in patients with hypertriglyceridemia . 
An increasing body of evidence suggests that the absolute amount of LDL -C lowering is 
proportional to CVD risk reduction in s tatin and nonstatin therapies that lower LDL-C via 
upregulation of LDL receptors.  Bempedoic acid  and EZE  are oral therapies that work by 
divergent mechanisms to lower LDL-C via up- regulation of LDL receptors.   The magnitude of 
LDL-C lowering that can be achieved by concurrent administration of these oral therapies on a 
background of maximally tolerated statin therapy is unknown.

4.2.1. Mechanism of Action  
Bempedoic acid is a first -in-class small molecule that decreases cholesterol synthesis in the liver .  
Bempedoic acid is a prodrug that requires coenzyme A (CoA) activation by very long- chain 
acyl-CoA synthe tase 1 (ACSVL1) to ETC -1002-CoA.  ETC -1002-CoA inhibits ACL, an enzyme 
upstream of HMG-CoA reductase in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.  Like statins, BA 
decreases liver cholesterol synthesis , which results in increased LDL receptor activity and LDL 
particle clearance from the blood.  
Both ETC -1002-CoA (via ACL inhibition) and statins (via HMG-CoA reductase inhibition) 
inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver, but an important differentiating feature is that unlike 
statins, BA  is inactive in skeletal muscle.  This is consistent with the absence of ACSVL1 ( the 
synthetase required to activate BA  to ETC -1002-CoA and inhibit ACL) expression in muscle 
tissue .  Evidence suggests that muscle- related adverse effects associated with statin use is a result 
of HMG -CoA reductase inhibition directly in skeletal muscle leading to a reduction of several 
downstream biological intermediates within the cholesterol synthesis pathway important for 
muscle cell function .  Since BA  is not activated to  ETC -1002-CoA and does not inhibit 
cholesterol synthesis in muscle tissue, it is anticipated that negative muscle -related adverse 
effects associated with statin use may be avoided by use of  BA.  The long- term safety of BA and 
its metabolites regarding human skeletal muscle is not yet established.

4.4. Risk Benefit Summary  
To date, the nonclinical and clinical data indicate that BA  180 mg  has a favorable risk -benefit 
profile.  The ability of BA to achieve clinically meaningful LDL-C lowering while 
demonstrating a favorable tolerability profile in a variety of patient populations supports 
continued development of BA  in Phase 3 studies.  
Several Phase 2 clinical studies have assessed the safety an d efficacy of BA as add -on to statin s 
or in combination with EZE .  These studies showed significant LDL-C lowering and a favorable 
safety profile .  
Please refer to the most recent IB for more detailed  information regarding previous human 
experience.

6.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase  3, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter study of BA  + EZE 
versus its individual components and placebo.  Screening (S 1) will occur approximately within 
2 week s prior to randomization.  Patients who are deemed not eligible for randomization at any 
point during screening will be notified by clinical site personnel regarding their eligibility status 
and considered screen failures.  Approximately 350  eligible patients will be randomized 2:2:2:1 
on Day 1/Week  0 (T1) to receive either BA 180 mg  + EZE 10 mg  FDC (N  = 100), BA  180 mg  
(n = 100), EZE  10 mg  (n = 100), or placebo (n = 50 ) for 12 weeks.  Randomized patients will 
return  for clinic visits at Week  4 (T2), Week  8 (T3) and Week 12 (T4). Patients who withdraw 
from investigational medicinal product ( IMP) treatment will be asked to continue to be followed 
for safety and efficacy using the protocol-specified visit schedule and procedures. 
Eligible patients will have documented atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD) , 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) , and/or multiple cardiovascular risk factors 
and require additional LDL-C- lowering therapy despite receivin g maximally tolerated statin 
background therapy.  Maximally tolerated statin therapy may include statin regimens other than 
daily dosing or no statin at all (if not tolerated) ; however, doses of  simvastatin ≥40  mg/day are 
prohibited.  A patient’s currently used and maximally tolerated statin therapy will be determined 
by the investigator based on their medical judgment and local standard of care.  Available 
sources, including the patient’s self-reported history of lipid- modifying therapy  will also be 
considered .   
Patients will be stratified based on baseline/ current statin intensity (high intensity statin versus 
other) and disease characteristics (ASCVD and/or HeFH versus  multiple CV risk factors) .  High 
intensity statin includes atorvastatin 40 -80 mg/day and rosuvastatin 20-40 mg/day, all others will 
be categorized as ‘other’ for randomization and stratification purposes.  Definition of ASCVD 
and/or HeFH or multiple CV risk factors are provided in inclusion criteria.  Enrollment will be 
monitored a nd a cap may be placed, if necessary, to ensure appropriate distribution into either of 
the statin intensity categories . 
6.2. Study Hypothesis  
The clinical  hypothesis for this study is that BA  180 mg  + EZE  10 mg  FDC will significantly 
reduce LDL-C versus placebo, BA, and EZE in patients receiving maximum statin background 
therapy treated daily for 12 weeks .  Additionally, it is hypothesized that both BA and EZE 
significantly contribute to the LDL- C lowering efficacy of the FDC.  
6.3. Estimated Study Duration  
Total study duration will be approximately 14 weeks  (2 weeks screening [up to 16 days] and 
12 weeks treatment).

8.1. Administration of Investigational Medicinal Product  
During the T reatment Period, patients will be randomized to receive IMP of either  BA 180 mg  + 
EZE 10 mg  FDC , BA 180 mg , EZE  10 mg , or placebo once daily.  Each daily allotment of IMP 
is comprised of 2 tablet s and 1 capsule provided in a blister package.  Patients will be instructed 
to ingest IMP orally once daily with or without food at a similar time every day .  On clinic visit 
days, patients will be instructed to delay ingestion of IMP until all study procedures have been 
completed.  
If the patient forgets to take IMP on nonclinic visit days, it may be taken up to 12 hours later the 
same day.  After that time, the patient should not take IMP that day and should resume ingestion 
of IMP the following day .  Details describing the reasons for missed doses should be 
documented in the patient’s medical records and electronic case report form  (eCRF ).  Extra IMP 
is provided and can be used, if needed, prior to the next visit or to replace an allotment of IMP that cannot be used because it is lost or damaged. 
Other details regarding IMP, including description, supply and control, accountability, handling, 
and disposal are provided in Section  9.  
8.2. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Patients will be questioned about their concomitant medication use at each clinic visit.  All 
concomitant medication taken chronically or intermittently during the study must be recorded with indication, total daily dose, and start and stop dates of administration. 
The Prior/Concomitant case report form (CRF) will be used to record medications, herbal 
remedies, vitamins, other nutritional supplements, and over- the-counter medications taken within 
6 weeks prior to screening and during the study , with the exception of statins (particularly those 
that were not tolerated due to an adverse effect), which will be recorded if taken at any point in the past . 
8.2.1. Required Medications  
Patients will be required to be on maximally tolerated statin therapy with dose stable for at least 
4 weeks prior to screening (Visit S1). Maximally tolerated statin includes statin regimens other 
than daily dosing, including no to very low doses.  A patient’s currently used and maximally 
tolerated statin therapy will be determined by the investigator based on their medical judgment 
and local standard of care.  Available sources, including the patient’s self-reported history of 
lipid-modifying therapy  will also be considered .  Statins may include:

Patients in this study  may be using a wide range of concomitant medications, according to local 
standard of care for their medical conditions.  Permitted medications must be stable for at least 
2 weeks prior to Visit S1 (Week  -2) with the exception of the medications described below.  
The following p ermitted medications  that may impact plasma lipid levels are allowed provided 
that they are stable at least  5 weeks prior to screening (Visit  S1) unless otherwise noted: 
• Hormone replacement;  
• Thyroid replacement;  
• Obesity medication (6  months prior to screening); 
• Omega 3 fatty acids ; 
• Diabetes medications .  
8.3. Treatment Assignment, Randomization, and Blinding  
During the T reatment Period, patients will receive double-blind IMP.  At Day  1 (Visit T1), 
patients will be randomized to receive either  BA 180 mg  + EZE  10 mg  FDC , BA  180 mg , EZE 
10 mg  or placebo.  The randomization will be stratified by baseline statin intensity (high  
intensity vs. other) and disease characteristics (ASCVD and/or H eFH v s. multiple CV risk 
factors ).  Only atorvastatin 40-80 mg/day and rosuvastatin 20-40 mg/day  are considered high 
intensity statin and all others will be considered as ‘other’ for randomization purpose.  The criteria for determining these 2 stratification factors are further detailed in Section  7.1).   The  
investigator or designee will utilize Interactive W eb Response S ystem (IWRS ) during the visit to 
randomiz e the patient and obtain the appropriate IMP container via medication identific ation 
numbers (MED ID).  A patient is considered to be randomized when the corresponding 
randomization box is checked within the eCRF. 
Randomization will be determined by a c omputer-generated random code and will correspond to 
a treatment group according t o patient’s sequential entrance into the study. The randomization 
schedule for blinding of treatment assignment will be generated by the contract research 
organization ( CRO ), provided to IWRS, and released only after the study is complete and the 
database is locked .  
During the Treatment Period, Sponsor, site personnel, CRO, and patient will all  be unaware of  
patient’s treatment assignment; an independent bio- analytical lab will be aware of treatment 
assignment only to support PK  sample analysis .   
Blinding of treatment must be maintained for all patients unless, in the opinion of the 
investigator, the safety of the patient may be at risk.  Only under the rarest of circumstances should the investigator consider breaking the blind and only when medical/suppor tive care 
cannot be provided without determining if the patient is receiving active drug treatment.  In the event that the blind needs to be broken prior to completion of the study, the investigator should contact the appropriate Medical Monitor by telephone.   If the blind must be broken prior to

Confidential Page 40 of 116 consultation with the Medical Monitor, contact must be made within 24 hours of breaking the 
blind.  
At the initiation of the study, the clinical site will be instructed on procedures for breaking the 
blind via the IWRS.  In all cases of breaking the blind, the investigator must document in the 
patient’s medical record the date, time, and reason for breaking the blind, and the names of 
personnel involved. 
Post-randomization values for individual laboratory measures f or LDL-C , non- HDL -C, TC, 
ApoB, hs- CRP, TG and HDL -C that may inadvertent ly suggest treatment assignment will not be 
available to personnel from the clinical site, the patient, the Sponsor, or the CRO.   While 
knowledge of these values does not truly ‘unblind,’ the collection of these lab assessments by the 
investigator, all collaborating physicians, or the patients locally (outside the study visits) is strongly discouraged. Investigators should not perform testing of these analytes at the local lab 
during the conduct of the study.

Confidential Page 42 of 116 The MED ID number (an identifier on the IMP packaging) will be obtained via IWRS and used 
to select double- blind IMP from available clinical supplies at the clinical site.  
IMP will be dispensed by the investigator or other qualified site personnel only to appropriate 
patients who have provided written informed consent. 
9.3. Packaging and Labeling  
Double-blind IMP will be packaged in blister pack s.  Each blister pack will contain a 9 -day 
supply and 4 blister pack s will be provided in the drug kit.  
The IMP label s will include protocol number, MED ID number, patient  identification number, 
lot number, site number and investigator name in addition to standard language regarding 
warnings and regulations, administration and storage of the product.  
9.4. Investigat ional Medicinal Product Adherence  
At each clinic visit during the Treatment Period, designated clinical site staff will assess patient 
IMP intake adherence by counting the number of tablets that are returned as unused and by querying the patient with regards to daily intake.  If the patient has not taken multiple doses as instructe d, the patient will be  queried for a reason, findings will be documented, and the patient 
will be counseled on the importance of carefully following all dosing instructions.  Factors contributing to poor adherence will be determined and, if possible, remedied.  Patients demonstrating poor adherence during the Treatment Period will continue to be counseled on the 
importance of carefully following all dosing instructions, but will not be removed from the study. 
9.5. Investigational Medicinal Product  Accountability 
Patients will be instructed to return all packaging and unused IMP at every visit for assessment 
of adherence and drug accountability.  
Accurate records of the receipt of all IMP shipped by the Sponsor (or designee)  and the 
disposition of that IMP must be maintained .  
IMP records or logs must comply with applicable regulations, local law, and guidelines, and 
should include: 
• Amount received/placed in storage area; 
• Amount currently in storage area; 
• MED ID number for all IMP ; 
• Dates and initials of person(s) responsible for IMP inventory (including 
entry/movement/disposition); 
• Date and amount of IMP  dispensed to each patient, including unique patient 
identifiers ; 
• Date that  IMP was returned by patient, assessment of adherence, and relevant 
documentation of discrepancies ;

The Principal Investigator will ensure that all IMP is stored in a secured area, under 
recommended storage conditions  
in accordance with  applicable 
regulatory requirements for investigational drugs.  Access to IMP will be limited to those clinical 
site personnel authorized by the investigator.  Upon completion or termination of the study , all 
IMP and used and unused IMP packaging must be returned to the Sponsor (or designee ) for 
eventual destruction unless otherwise authorized by the Sponsor.  All IMP returns must be 
accompanied by the appropriate documentation.

10.1. Informed Consent  
The patient must be adequately informed of the nature and risks of the study and understand the 
Informed Consent Document ( ICD).  It is the investigator’s responsibility that n o study- related 
procedure will be performed until the patient has been completely informed of the study, has 
freely consented to take part in the study, and has signed and dated an ICD approved by the 
Sponsor (or designee) and the Institutional Review Boar d (IRB).  The written ICD should be 
prepared in the local language(s) of the potential patient population.  
10.2. Interactive Web Response System and eCRFs  
Data will be captured on eCRFs , and IWRS is contacted via eCRFs .  Instructions for these 
systems and addit ional contact time points for IWRS will be provided separately. 
10.3. Patient Identification Numbers 
A unique patient identification number will be assigned to each patient to identify each patient throughout the study.  Patient identification numbers will be assigned sequentially by IWRS and is comprised  of protocol, site, and patient-specific numbers. 
10.4. Rescreening  
Patients who are screen ing failures due to stability requirements for a condition or concurrent 
medication or other reason may be considered for rescreening after consultation with the Sponsor (or designee).  If rescreened, t hese patients must also be re- consented  and screening procedures 
must be repeated .  If a patient is a screen failure, or if a patient discontinues from the study, their 
patient ID number will not be assigned to another patient.  
10.5. Procedures and Schedule of Assessments  
The study is comprised of two  distinct periods: screening  and double- blind treatment.  
The schedule of study events  is pro vided in Appendix 1.  H owever, a patient can be seen at any 
time for reasons of safety .  
10.5.1. Screening Week -2 (Visit S1; Day  -16 to Day -5) 
The screening period will begin with a screening visit that will occur within approximately 2 weeks prior to randomization.  Visit S1 will allow the i nvestigator to assess the patient’s 
preliminary eligibility . After the patient provides written informed consent (see Section  10.1), 
the patient will undergo the following assessments and procedures: 
• Assess AEs and  serious adverse events ( SAEs ) (starting from signing the informed 
consent document); 
• Demographics; 
• Clinically relevant  medical history ;

Confidential Page 45 of 116 • Prior and concomitant medication review; 
• Review of all inclusion/exclusion criteria that can be assessed at this time ; 
• Height (cm), and weight (kg) ; 
• Vital signs; 
• Central clinical laboratory evaluations:  
− TSH;  
− Hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis; 
− Serology (including HBsAg, hepatitis  C virus [HCV] antibody); 
− Basic fasting lipids (TC, calculated LDL-C, HDL -C, non- HDL -C, and TG); 
− Serum pregnancy test (in female patients  of childbearing potential) or FSH ( only 
in postmenopausal women <55 years of age) ; 
− HbA 1C; 
• Contact IWRS to register the patient. 
Patients who meet all enrollment criteria that can be assessed following review of the Visit S1  
central clinical laboratory results (available several days after Visit S1) will be instructed to 
return for Visit  T1 and to maintain consistent diet and exercise patterns throughout the study.  
Patients who fail to meet an y entry criterion that can be assessed at Visit  S1 are considered to be 
screen failures and are not required to return for additional visits (although a patient can be seen at any time for safety reasons ). 
Note:   An unscheduled visit may be completed no more than 10 days after the screening visit 
if patient fails to meet entry criteria for LDL-C, TG , DBP, SBP, eGFR, ALT, A ST, serology 
and/or CK entry criterion  at the discretion of the investigator if warranted .  For those patients 
who have a repeat measurement, the repeat value will be used to determine eligibility.  
10.5.2. Treatment Week 0 (Visit  T1; Day  1) 
Prior to scheduling Visit T1, s creening results will be reviewed to determine  whether the patient 
continues to meet eligibility criteria .  At Visit T1 , a physical exam , ECG  and urine pregnancy 
test will also be completed prior to randomization.  Patients not meeting all entry criteria at any 
point prior to randomization will be screen  failures . 
If the patient has met all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria , the patient may be 
randomized into the double-blind T reatment P eriod .  
At randomization, patients will be stratified based on baseline /current  statin intensity ( High vs. 
Other) and disease characteristics (ASCVD and/or HeFH v s. multiple CV risk factors).  High 
intensity statin includes atorvastatin 40 -80 mg/day and rosuvastatin 20-40 mg/day, all others will 
be categorized as ‘other’ for randomization and stratification purposes.  Definition of ASCVD 
and/or HeFH or multiple CV risk factors are provided in inclusion criteria.

Confidential Page 48 of 116 10.6. Discontinuations  
10.6.1. Patients Inadvertently Enrolled  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria for enrollment must be followed exactly and completely.  If 
a patient who does not meet enrollment criteria is inadvertently enrolled, the Medical Monitor 
should be contacted within 24 hours of identification.  If it is determined after discussion with 
the Medical Monitor that, in considering patient safety, it is appropriate to continue IMP 
(documentation of this is necessary), the patient will continue on IMP and be monitored for all 
visits and testing (including laboratory measures) for the duration of the study.  If after 
discussion with the Medical Monitor it is determined that the patient should not continue IMP, 
IMP will be discontinued, but the patient will remain in the study to be evaluated for 
concomitant medications, and efficacy and safety endpoints until the end of the study visit. 
Patients inadverte ntly enrolled under the following criteria should be discontinued from IMP (but 
remain in the study):  
• Female patients who are pregnant or are breastfeeding or who do not agree to use at 
least 1  reliable methods of birth control during the study (unless the y have agreed to 
follow the definition of true abstinence); 
• Any clinically significant medical condition that according to the investigator could 
interfere with participation in the study ; 
• Unable or unwilling to comply with protocol requirements, or deemed by the 
investigator to be unfit for the study ; 
• Have a history of drug, alcohol, or substance abuse within the past 6 months, as assessed by the investigator . 
If a patient stops IMP for any of the above exclusion criteria following discussion with the 
Medi cal Monitor, then investigators should notify the Sponsor (or designee).  The reason for the 
patient’s inadvertent enrollment should be documented in the patient’s record. 
10.6.2. Temporary Discontinuation of Investigational Medicinal Product 
There may be situatio ns in which IMP is temporarily discontinued at the discretion of the 
investigator.  IMP should be restarted as soon as possible based on investigator judgment.  The 
number of days the IMP was not taken, and the reason for temporary discontinuation, should be 
documented in the patient’s medical record.  There is no limit to the amount of time patient can be off IMP prior to restarting. 
Investigators should contact the Medical Monitor if IMP is temporarily discontinued and this 
should occur prior to IMP discontinuation if possible. 
10.6.3. Permanent Discontinuation of Investigational Medicinal Product  
There may be situation s where it may be necessary for a patient to permanently discontinue IMP.  
Investigators should contact the Medical Monitor prior to permanent IMP discontinuation to 
discuss the situation.  If IMP is permanently discontinued, the patient will remain in the

Confidential Page 49 of 116 study to be evaluated for concomitant medications, efficacy and safety endpoints until the 
final study visit.   If the patient is unwilling or unable to return for follow-up visits in person, 
alternatives such as telephone contact visits per the Schedule of Events, or telephone follow up at 
the end of the study should be used to collect as much data as possible.  The follow-up frequency 
will be documented in the eCRF. 
The reason for permanent discontinuation of IMP should be documented in the eCRF.  If the 
discontinuation of IMP is due to an AE, the event should be documented in the eCRF.  Some 
possible reasons that may lead to permanent early IMP discontinuation include: 
• In the opinion of the investigator, any AE or a significant change in a laboratory value 
that warrants permanent discontinuation of IMP therapy.  Investigators are advised to 
call the Medical Monitor prior to making such a decision; 
• Illness, condition, or procedural complication (including AEs) affecting the patient’s 
ability to participate or requiring prohibited medication.   Investigators are advised to 
call the Medical Monitor prior to making such a decision; 
• Female patients who beco me pregnant or are breastfeeding or who do not agree to use 
at least 1  reliable methods of birth control during the study (unless they have agreed 
to follow the definition of true abstinence) will be permanently discontinued from 
IMP; 
• The patient requests to stop IMP permanently; 
• The patient study blind is broken; 
• Enrollment in any other clinical trial involving an investigational product or enrollment in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or 
medically compatible with this study.  If after discussion with the study Medical 
Monitor it is determined that the patient should not continue IMP, IMP will be 
discontinued; 
• Patient moves away and it is impossible to come to this or any other trial site for visits as required by protocol. 
10.6.4. Patient Discontinuation from the Study  
Patient discontinuation prior to the patient’s completion of the study is expected to be 
uncommon, occurring only if the patient explicitly withdraws consent. At the time of 
discontinuing from the study, the Medical Monitor should be contacted, and, if possible, an early 
discontinuation visit should be conducted, per the Study Schedule. The patient will be permanently discontinued both from the IMP and from the study at that time. During the study 
closeout pe riod, survival (vital) status will be collected within legal and ethical boundaries for all 
patients randomized who withdrew their participation from the study. 
10.6.5. Patients Lost to Follow- Up 
A patient would be considered potentially lost to follow-up if he or she repeatedly fails to return 
for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.  Site personnel are expected

Confidential Page 50 of 116 to make diligent attempts to contact patients who fail to return for a scheduled visit or were 
otherwise unable to be followed up by the site.  Investigators are advised to call the Medical 
Monitor prior to concluding patient is lost to follow-up.  Vital status will be collected within 
legal and ethical boundaries during the study closeout period.  If vital status is determined,  the 
patient will not be considered lost to follow-up. 
10.6.6. Discontinuation of Study Sites or the Study  
The Sponsor may suspend enrollment or discontinue a site at any time. A written statement will 
be provided to the investigator, the IRB or IEC, and regulatory authorities, if required.  
Possible reasons for site discontinuation include, but are not limited to: 
• Unsatisfactory enrollment with respect to quantity or quality ; 
• Inaccurate or incomplete data collection on a chronic basis ; 
• Falsification of records ; 
• Failure to adhere to the protocol; 
• Lack of study oversight by the Principal Investigator and/or designee. 
If any serious or nonserious AEs have occurred at such a clinical site, all documentation relating 
to the event(s) must be obtained. 
The Sponsor will retain responsibility for discontinuation of the study. The study will be 
discontinued if necessary for medical, safety, regulatory or other reasons consistent with 
applicable laws, regulations, and Good Clinical Practice (GCP).

11.1. Assessments of Lipids and hs-CRP 
Central clinical laboratory samples will be collected and analyzed for th e parameters detailed in 
Table 3.  LDL-C will be calculated or measured directly if TG are >400  mg/dL  or LDL-C is 
<50 mg/dL .  
Blood draws for lipids ( not safety ) must meet  the criteri on below.  If this criteri on has not been 
met, these blood samples will NOT be collected.  If this criteri on can be met by rescheduling 
clinic visit to occur within 3  days, these blood samples will be collected at the rescheduled 
clinic visit only.  
• Blood samples will be drawn after a minimum 10 -hour fast (water  and concomitant 
medications are allowed)  
Patients are to be in a seated position during the blood collection. Collection schedule and 
instructions are provided in the C entral C linical Laboratory Manual.  A description of the sample 
collection, storage, and shipping as well as monitoring and management of abnormal laboratories 
are described in Section  12.1.6. 
When vital signs and labor atory samples are to be collected at the same time point, vital sign 
measurements will precede laboratory sample collection.

12.1. Safety Parameters  
At all clinic visits, investigators will review  all safety information including  vital signs,  AEs , 
SAEs, and concomitant medications and will ensure that the collected data are recorded into the 
appropriate eCRF .  Additionally, c entral clinical laboratory samples will be collected and sent 
for analysis and the investigator will review the results to ensure continued patient safety while 
participating in the study.   
12.1.1. Demographi c/Medical History  
Demographic data and a complete medical history will be obtained from the patient.  For medical 
history, conditions that are relevant and/or clinically significant should be captured with at least a 
start date (month and year) and whether the condition is ongoing or resolved.  All surgeries 
regardless of date should be reported.  
12.1.2. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include DBP and SBP as well as heart rate.  
Vitals will be collec ted prior to blood collection.  Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate wi ll be 
measured using a calibrated, fully automated machine with a cuff that is appropriate to the size 
of the upper arm.  If a fully automated machine is not available, BP  may be measured manually.  
The same method (either automated or manual) and the same arm (right or left) must  be used 
throughout the study.  The patient should be in a seated position with feet touching the floor.  Patients should be seated quietly for at least 5  minutes in a chair with their backs supported, their 
feet flat on the ground, and their arms bared and supported at heart level.   
12.1.3. Weight and Height   
Body w eight will be measured on a calibrated scale in the morning while fasted and after 
voiding.  
Height will be measured using standard clinic procedures.  
Body mass index (B MI) will be calculated systematically using the formula:  
BMI (kg/m
2) = weight in kg/(height in meters)2 
12.1.4. Physical Examination 
Physical examinations  will include an assessment of the following:  
• General appearance; 
• Skin; 
• Eyes, ears, nose, and throat; 
• Head and neck ; 
• Extremities ;

• Neurologic examination  including documentation of the presence of abnormalities in 
mental status and motor and sensory function; 
• Any additional assessments necessary to establish baseline status or evaluate 
symptoms or adverse experiences. 
Documentation of the PE findings will be included in the source documentation at the clinical site.  Significant findings prior to the start of IMP will be recorded on the Medical 
History/Current Medical Conditions page of the eCRF.  Only changes from baseline physical 
examination findings that meet the definition of an AE  will be recorded  on the AE  page of the 
eCRF.  
12.1.5. Electrocardiogram  
ECG collection will be preceded by a 10 -minute rest time during which the patient will remain in  
the supine position. At each time point, ECGs will be collected prior to blood collection. ECGs 
will be assessed  using machine readings and physician review.  
12.1.5.1. Monitoring and Management of Abnormal Electrocardiograms 
If a clinically significant ECG abnormality not present at baseline (screening) is determined by  
the Investigator to be related to study drug, the abnormality will be discussed with the Sponsor personnel or the authorized Medical Monitor, and followed and evaluated with additional tests (if 
necessary) until the underlying cause is determined or the event is brought to an acceptable resolution. Additional c linical and laboratory information will be collected and carefully  
documented in order to better characterize the ECG abnormality and rule out alternative causes.  ECG findings determined to be a clinically significant change from baseline should be report ed 
as an AE regardless of causality.  
Unscheduled ECG assessments will be completed at the discretion of the Investigator.

Samples will be processed by the Central Laboratory .  
12.1.6.3. Collection and Assessme nt of Plasma Trough IMP 
Plasma  trough IMP will be measured at Weeks 4, 8, and 12.  A single 6-mL whole blood sample 
will be collected and processed by the site according to instructions provided in the manual 
provided by the Central Laboratory.  At the time of sample collection, the date and time of blood 
draw and the last 2  doses of study medication will also be collected.  Samples will be shipped to 
the central clinical laboratory and subsequently forwarded to a bio- analytical lab for 
measurement and analysis.   
Plasma trough IMP concentrations will be measured and analyzed using validated methods and 
will include BA (ETC -1002 and its active metabolite ESP15228) and EZE (glucuronidated EZE 
and unconjugated EZE). 
12.1.6.4. General Monitoring and Management of Abno rmal Clinical Labs  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review the results of all laboratory tests as they become  
available and to sign and date the report to document their review.  For each laboratory test  
outside of the laboratory normal range, th e Investigator needs to ascertain if this is a clinically  
significant change from baseline for the individual patient, with baseline defined as the last value 
or observation before the first dose of study drug.  The Investigator may repeat the laboratory 
test or request additional tests to verify the results of the original laboratory test.  
If a laboratory value is determined to be an abnormal and clinically significant change from  
baseline for the patient, the Investigator should determine if it qualifies as an AE, and if yes, an appropriate eCRF will be completed.

Confidential Page 56 of 116 An abnormal laboratory value that is not already associated with an AE is to be recorded as an  
AE only if any one of the following criteria is met: 
• an action on the study drug is made as a result of the abnormality; 
• intervention for management of the abnormality is required; 
• at the discretion of the investigator should the abnormality be deemed clinically 
significant. 
All clinically significant laboratory abnormalities occurring during the study that were not  
present at baseline should be followed and evaluated with additional tests if necessary, until diagnosis of the underlying cause or resolution.  Specific monitoring and management guidelines 
for laboratories of special interest are outlined in the sections below. 
12.1.6.4.1. Monitoring and Management of Elevated Liver Function Tests 
If at any time after randomization a patient experiences a new  ALT and/or AST >3 × ULN, the 
patient will undergo repeat confirmatory liver function test (LFT) assessment as so on as is 
reasonably possible, preferably within 3 to 7 days of the laboratory result becoming available.  
Repeat LFT assessment will include:  1) measurement of ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total 
and direct bilirubin, prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), eosinophil 
count, CK; 2) history of concomitant medication use; 3) history of exposure to environmental chemical agents, including ethanol; and 4) query for related symptoms.  Although samples will 
be collected, some repeat LFT parameters may not be measured until elevation is confirmed.  
• If repeat LFT assessment confirms ALT  and/or AST  >3 × ULN  but ≤ 5 × ULN , 
consideration should be given to administering no further doses of IMP.  At the 
investigator’s discretion, IMP may be interrupted and the patient rechallenged with 
IMP after LFTs have returned to baseline levels .  
• If repeat LFT assessment confirms ALT and/or AST >5  × ULN  and no alternative 
reason for elevation is identified , patient should discontinue IMP.  At the 
investigator’s discretion, IMP may be interrupted and the patient rechallenged with 
IMP after LFTs have returned to baseline levels.  
• If repeat LFT assessment confirms ALT and/or AST >3  × ULN in addition to any of 
the following and no alternative reason for elevation is identified, patient should 
discontinued IMP  and be given no further IMP treatment: 
− TB >2 × ULN ; 
− INR >1.5 × ULN  (unless the patient is on stable dose of anticoagulation 
medication) ; 
− Appearance or worsening of right upper abdominal discomfort, anorexia, fatigue, 
nausea, vomiting, fever, rash, or eosinophilia.

Confidential Page 57 of 116 12.1.6.4.2. Monitoring and Management of Elevated Creatine Kinase 
If at any time after randomization a patient experiences a marked CK elevation >5 × ULN, the 
patient will undergo repeat confirmatory assessment as soon as is reasonably possible, preferably within 3  to 7 days of the laboratory result becoming available.  If initial CK elevation is >10  × 
ULN , patients will be instructed to discontinue IMP immediately (instead of continuing IMP 
until repeat lab value is assessed).  It is very important that repeat confirmatory assessment occur 
as soon as possible (within a day of stopping IMP).  
Repeat CK asses sment w ill include query for the nature, duration and intensity of any muscle 
symptoms; review possible predisposing factors, such as unaccustomed exercise, heavy alcohol 
intake, viral illness (consider performing serology), concomitant medications, and/or other 
conditions which can cause myopathy; physical examination for muscle tenderness, weakness, 
and rash; measure serum creatinine, dipstick urinalysis ± microscopy if indicated; and basic metabolic panel .  
• If the repeat CK assessment confirms an unexplained (ie, not associated with recent trauma or physically strenuous activity) CK abnormality >5 × ULN, if asymptomatic 
the patient should receive further assessment and investigation into the cause, assess 
whether there is renal injury and measure CK approximately weekly or more frequently if clinically indicated until resolution.  If CK levels continue to rise; IMP 
should be discontinued.   
• If the repeat CK assessment confirms an unexplained ( i.e., not associated with recent 
trauma or physically strenuous activity) CK abnormality as listed below, the patient 
should discontinue IMP:  
− >5 × ULN that is associated with symptoms of muscle pain, muscle weakness, or dark urine; or  
− >10 × ULN, even in the absence of symptoms.  
• At the investigator’s discretion, IMP may be interrupted and the patient rechallenged with IMP after CK has returned to the baseline level.  
12.1.6.4.3. Monitoring and Management of Elevated TG  
Patients may continue to use stable doses of TG- lowering medications (except fibrates) during 
the study.  Post-randomization, TG results will be masked to investigators in order to maintain the blind; however, a threshold has been set to notify investigators and provide an opportunity to 
adjust the patient’s standard of care regimen. If the TG level exceeds 10 00 mg/dL (11.3 mmol/L) 
while on treatment, the investigator will receive notification from the central laboratory that the 
patient has met or exceeded the protocol defined threshold criteria for TG.  
• Any patient with initial report of TG >1000 mg/dL (11.3 mmol/L), will be counseled 
on healthy dietary guidelines, and reminded to take IMP and other background 
medications as directed and fast for at least 10  hours prior to repeat TG assessment.  
• Patient will return to clinic within 1 week  for a repeat, fasting TG assessment  to 
confirm the TG value meets the threshold criteria .

Confidential Page 58 of 116 • Any pa tient with a confirmed TG >1000 mg/dL (11.3 mmol/L) will have TG 
lowering medications (except fibrates) adjusted or added if possible to lower TG.  
Changes in medication s will be do cumented on the case report form .  These 
medications will not be provided by the sponsor.  
12.1.6.4.4. Monitoring and Management of Potential Hypoglycemia and Metabolic Acidosis 
Patients will be educated by the Investigator or designee on the signs and symptoms of 
hypoglycemia .  If such signs and symptoms are experienced, patients will be advised to report 
them to the study site  (see Section  13.3 for additiona l details) .  
Clinical laboratories will be assessed by the Investigator or designee to determine any signs of anion gap metabolic acidosis.  If laboratories are consistent with metabolic acidosis, immediate 
follow up with the patient for further medical evaluation of the acidosis will occur  (see 
Section  13.3 for additional details) .  This event should be captured  as an AE .  
12.1.6.5. Total Blood Volume of Central Clinical Laboratory Samples 
The total number of venipunctures and total volume of whole blood collected during the study 
will be limited to that ne eded for safety , efficacy , and PK assessment .  Total whole blood volume 
collected over the study duration is not to exceed approxima tely 250 mL for  each patient.

13.1. Adverse Events  
13.1.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a  
pharmaceutical product, including control, and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with treatment.  
An AE can be:  
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered r elated to the medicinal product; 
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease;  
• Any deterioration in nonprotocol-required measurements of laboratory value or other clinical test ( e.g., ECG or x- ray) that resul ts in symptoms, a change in treatment, or 
discontinuation from study drug; 
• TEAEs are defined as AEs that begin or worsen aft er the first dose of study drug; 
• Adverse drug reaction (ADR; see Section  13.1.2). 
13.1.2. Adverse Drug Reaction  
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be 
considered an ADR. “Responses” to a medicinal product means that a causal rel ationship 
between a medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility (i.e. , the relationship 
cannot be ruled out). 
An unexpected ADR is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not 
consistent with the applicable product information ( e.g., IB for an unapproved investigational 
product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product). 
13.1.3. Reporting for Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring during the course of the study (starting from signing informed consent to 
study completion or discontinuation) will be collected on the AE eCRF.  Patients should be 
instructed to report any AE that they experience to the Investigator through 30 days following  
study completion or discontinuation.  Beginning with Visit S1 (Week -2), Investigators should 
make an  assessment for AEs at each visit and record the event on the appropriate AE eCRF.  
Any SAE  that occurs from the time of signing informed consent through 30 days following study 
completion  should be reported to the Sponsor per Section  13.2.4. 
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms s hould be identified by the Investigator and recorded on the eCRF.  However, if an  
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or 
syndrome by the Investigator, it should be recorded as a separate AE on the eCRF.  Additionally,

Confidential Page 60 of 116 the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth 
extraction, transfusion) should be recorded as an AE, not the procedure.  Any medical condition 
already present at screening or baseline should not be reported as an AE  unless the medical 
condition or signs or symptoms present at baseline changes in severity or seriousness at any time during the study. In this case, it should be reported as an AE. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination ( e.g., ECG) findings that are 
detected during the study or are present at baseline and significantly worsen during the study 
should be reported as AEs.  The Investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific  
judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is 
clinically significant.  Significant abnormal laboratory values occurring during the clinical study  
will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically  
significant. Any abnormal test that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE. 
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity, seriousness, and causal relationship to the 
investigational drug. For each AE, the following information will be recorded:  
• Description of the event ( e.g., headache);  
• Date of onset;  
• Date of resolution (or that the event is continuing); 
• Action  taken as a result of the event;  
• Seriousness of the event; 
• Severity of the event;  
• Outcome of the event ; 
• Investigator’s assessment of relationship to study drug. 
A cluster of signs and symptoms that results from a single cause should be reported as a single 
AE ( e.g., fever, elevated WBC, cough, abnormal chest X- ray, etc, can all be reported as  
“pneumonia”). 
The Investigator  will carefully evaluate the comments of the patient and the response to  
treatment in order that he/she may judge the true nature and severity of the AE.  The question of 
the relationship of AEs to study drug administration should be determined by the Investigator or study physician after thorough consideration of all facts that are available.  
Additional information will be collected regarding muscle -related AEs that may include, but may  
not necessarily be limited to, a muscle -related questionnaire, with questions regarding type of 
muscle -related symptoms, location of the muscle- related AE, and potential cause of the muscle-
related AE.

Confidential Page 61 of 116 13.1.4. Severity  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to assess the intensity (severity) of an AE.   The severity of 
the AE will b e characterized as mild, moderate, or severe according to the following definitions:  
• Mild:  Events are usually transient and do not interfere with the patient’s daily 
activities; 
• Moderate:   Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the patient 
and may interfere with daily activities; 
• Severe:  Events interrupt the patient’s usual daily activity, are incapacitating with 
inability to do usual activities, or significantly affect clinical status and warrant 
intervention and/or close follow-up. 
Note:  A severe AE need not be serious and an SAE need not, by definition, be severe. 
13.1.5. Relationship  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to assess the relationship between the study drug and the 
AE. The degree of “relatedness” of the AE to the study drug may be described using the 
following scale:  
• Not Related:  No temporal association and other etiologies are likely the cause.  
• Unlikely:  While cannot be definitively ruled as not related to IMP, a causal 
association is remote, and other etiologies are mo re likely to be the cause.   For 
reporting and summarization, events assessed as “Unlikely” to be related to IMP will be considered as “Not Related” to IMP for regulatory reporting purposes.  
• Possible:  Temporal association, but other etiologies are likely the cause.  However, involvement of the study drug cannot be excluded.  
• Probable:  Temporal association, other etiologies are possible but unlikely.  The event 
may respond if the study drug is discontinued.  
• Definite:  Established temporal association with administration of the study drug with no other more probable cause.  Typically, the event should resolve when the study drug is discontinued and recur on re- challenge.  
13.1.6. Monitoring and Follow- up of Adverse Events  
Patients having AEs will be monitored with relevant clinical assessments and laboratory tests, as  
determined by the Investigator. All follow -up results are to be reported to the Sponsor personnel 
or the authorized Medical Monitor.  Any actio ns taken and follow up results must be recorded 
either on the appropriate page of the eCRF or in appropriate follow-up written correspondence, 
as well as in the patient’s source documentation.  Follow-up laboratory results should be filed 
with the patient’ s source documentation. 
For all AEs that require the patient to be discontinued from the study, relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory tests must be repeated at appropriate intervals until final resolution, 
stabilization of the event(s), or until the patient is lost to follow -up or dies.

Confidential Page 62 of 116 Patients with AEs that are ongoing at study completion or study withdrawal must be followed  
until resolution or for 30 days after the last study visit, whichever comes first.  
13.1.7. Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events  
TEAE are  defined as AEs that begin or worsen after the first dose of study drug until 30 days 
after study completion  or as defined in the study- specific statistical analysis plan .  
13.2. Serious Adverse Events  
13.2.1. Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following  
outcomes:  
• Results in death ; 
• Is life threatening ; 
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization ; 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  or substantial disruption of 
the ability to conduct normal life functions; 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect ; 
• An important medical event. 
NOTE:  Hospitalization is defined as a formal inpatient admission. This will not include  
admissions under “23-hour Observational Status”, an Emergency Room visit without hospital 
admission or an Urgent Care visit and therefore, such events will not be recorded as an SAE 
under this criterion. Admission to the hospital for social or situational reasons ( e.g., no place to 
stay, live too far away to come for hospital visits) will not be considered inpatient 
hospitalizations.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require  
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they  
may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.   Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room, blood dyscrasias, 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse. 
13.2.2. Events not Qualifying as Serious Adverse Events 
The following is not considered an SAE and therefore does not need to be reported as such:  
• Overdose of either Esperion study drug or concomitant medication unless the event 
meets SAE criteria ( e.g., hospitalization).  However, the event should still be captured 
as a nonserious AE on the appropriate eCRF page

Confidential Page 63 of 116 13.2.3. Clinical Laboratory Assessments as Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to assess the clinical significance of all abnormal values  
as defined by the list of reference ranges from the central (or local where appropriate) laboratory.   
In some cases, significant changes in lab values within the normal range will require similar  
judgment. For criteria of reporting abnormal lab values as AE, see  Section  12.1.6.4. 
13.2.4. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, occurring from the time of informed consent 
until 30 days following study completion , must be reported by the Principal Investigator or  
designee to the authorized Medical and Safety Services within 24 hours of the Principal Investigator or the clinical site becoming aware of the occurrence.  For most patients this will be  
30 days following their Week 12 (Visi t T4) visit.  All SAEs that the Investigator considers 
related  to study drug that occur after the 30-day follow-up of the study period must be reported 
to the Sponsor. 
To report the SAE, complete the SAE information in the clinical electronic data capture (EDC) 
database within 24 hours of becoming aware of the occurrence.  Additional information, such as 
diagnostic test results or hospital discharge summary can be sent via email (drugsafety@esperion.com) or via fax (+1 -734-887-3988). 
The Investigator is req uired to submit SAE reports to the IRB/IEC in accordance with local 
requirements.  All Investigators involved in studies using the same investigational product will receive any safety alert notifications for onward submission to their local IRB as required.  All  
reports sent to Investigators will be blinded. 
All SAEs should be recorded on the eCRF and source documents. Criteria for documenting the 
relationship to study drug and severity will be the same as those previously described. 
The Investigator must continue to follow the patient until the SAE has subsided or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment), or the patient dies.  
Within 24 hours of receipt of follow-up information, the Investigator must update the SAE form  
and submit any supporting documentation ( e.g., patient discharge summary or autopsy reports) to 
the safety contact information provided on the SAE report form. 
13.2.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Authorities  
The Sponsor (and/or designee) is responsible for submitting expedited reports of suspected and 
unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARS) to the appropriate regulatory authorities. All Investigators participating in ongoing clinical studies with the study drug will be notified by the 
Sponsor (or designee) of SUSARs. SUSARS must be communicated as soon as possible to the 
appropriate IRB/IEC by the investigator, as applicable and/or reported in accordance with local laws and regulations. Investigators should provide written documentation of IRB/IEC 
notification for each report to the Sponsor. 
SAEs that are anticipated to occur in this patient population will be collected and reported by the 
Investigator as described in Section  13.2.4.  However, these events will not be submitted to the

Confidential Page 64 of 116 regulatory authorities as expedited reports unless they meet SUSAR criteria.  These events that  
are considered to be exempt from expedited reporting include the following clinical endpoints:  
• CV death ; 
• Nonfatal MI ; 
• Nonfatal stroke; 
• Unstable angina requiring hospitalization ; 
• Coronary revascularization ; 
• Heart failure requiring hospitalization ; 
• Noncoronary arterial revascularization . 
13.2.6. Reporting of Patient Death 
The death of any patient during the study, or within the 30-day follow-up period after they have 
completed the study (regardless of the cause), must be reported as detailed in Section  13.2.4.   
13.2.7. Reports of Pregnancy   
If a female patient becomes pregnan t during the study or within 30 days after the last dose of  
study drug, the investigator is to stop dosing with study drug(s) imm ediately.  A pregnancy is not

using the paper Pregnancy Report Form within the same timelines as an SAE.  A pregnancy 
should be followed through to outcome, whenever possible.  Once the outcome of the pregnancy is known, the paper Pregnancy Outcome Report Form should be completed and reported to the 
Sponsor.  Adverse events or SAEs that occur during pregnancy will be assessed and processed 
according to the AE or SAE processes using the appropriate AE CRF.  Patients who become pregnant will discontinue IMP immediately and complete the End of Study evaluations.  
13.3. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) include metabolic acidosis (cli nical laboratories),  
hepatic, muscular (AE and CK evaluation), new onset diabetes/hyperglycemia, renal,  
cardiovascular, and neurocognitive/neurologic events.  Specific monitoring guidelines are 
provided in the case of AEs uncovered through laboratory evaluations.

14.1. General Considerations  
The statistical analyses described in this section will be performed as further outlined in the  
statistical analysis plan  (SAP).  The SAP will supers ede the protocol if there are any differences 
between the 2  documents in the plans or descriptions for data analysis.  The SAP will be 
included as an appendix in the clinical study report for this protocol. 
In general, summary statistics for continuous variables will include the number of patients , mean, 
median, standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE), first and third quartiles, minimum, and 
maximum.  For categorical variables, the frequency and percentage will be given.  
14.2. Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size of 100 patients pe r active treatment group and 50 patients in the placebo arm 
(2:2:2:1) of this study (350 patients  total) was  selected to provide adequate power for each of the 
co-primary endpoint as well as the co -primary endpoint family  as a whole.  
14.3. Analysis Populations  
The full analysis set (FAS), used for all of the efficacy analyses, is defined as all randomized 
patients.  Patients in FAS will be analyzed in the t reatment group they are randomized to 
regardless of the treatment received.  
The Safety Population (SP), used for all of the safety summaries, is defined as all randomized patients who received at least 1  dose of blinded IMP.  Patients in the SP will be included in the 
treatment group that they actually received, regardless of their randomized treatment.  
The PK analysis set (PKS), used for all of the PK- related summaries, is defined as all patients in 
the SP who have at least 1 PK assessment unless major pr otocol deviations are identified to have 
affected the PK data or if key dosing or sampling information is missing. 
14.4. Disposition, Demographics, and Baseline Characteristics  
Disposition, including reason for withdrawal from the IMP and study, will be summariz ed by 
treatment group.  Demographic information and patient baseline characteristics including, but not limited to, gender, race, age, and baseline vital signs will also be summarized by treatment 
group.

Confidential Page 67 of 116 14.5. Co-Primary Endpoint Analysis 
The co -primary efficacy  endpoints consist of three comparisons of the percent change from 
baseline to Week  12 in LDL-C: FDC vs. placebo, FDC vs. EZE ; and FDC vs. BA . 
Each of the comparisons will be carried out using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model 
including treatment gr oup and stratification factors as factors and baseline LDL -C as covariate.  
Baseline LDL -C is defined as the mean of the values from Week  -2 (Visit S1) and pre-dose 
Day 1/Week  0 (Visit T1).   
Missing values for primary endpoint will be imputed using multiple imputation (MI) method 
(MI) , taking account for the adherence to the treatment.  For patients  with missing data and no 
longer receive treatment  at W eek 12, their LDL- C will be imputed as th eir baseline value;  for 
those with missing data but still receiving treatment, their LDL -C value will be imputed using a 
regression based model including treatment, stratification factor s, baseline LDL -C as auxiliary 
variables .  Approximately 200 datasets will be imputed.  The imputed datasets will be analyzed 
using the ANCOVA model described above and the results from the analysis of each imputed dataset will be combined using Rubin’s method.  The final results will include the least squares 
mean (LSM), SE , 95% confidence interval (CI) and associated p- values for each treatment 
group, as well as for each treatment group comparison of interests.   
The details of the ANCOVA model and multiple imputations  will be further described in the 
SAP.  
Each of the compa rison s within the co -primary endpoint family will be conducted at a 
significan ce level of 0.05. If and only if all three testing achieve statistical significance, the study 
is claimed to meet its primary objective and the hypothesis testing will continue to secondary 
endpoints, otherwise all statistical comparisons for secondary endpoints are considered 
descriptive only. 
14.6. Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses  
Secondary efficacy endpoints, which include the percent change from baseline to Week 12 in 
additional lipid and cardiometabolic biomarkers, will be analyzed in a similar manner as the 
primary efficacy endpoint.   
Baseline for non- HDL -C, HDL -C, TC, and TG is defined as the mean of the values from 
Week  -2 (Visit S1) and predose Day 1/Week  0 (Visit  T1), while baseline for ApoB and hs- CRP 
is defined as the predose Day 1/Week  0 (Visit T1) value.   
As described in Section  14.5, if co -primary endpoint family achieves statistical significance, a 
list of selected secondary endpoints will be tested in sequential order within each comparison 
group. The alpha allocation among the three comparison groups is: alpha = 0.02 for FDC vs. 
EZE or FDC vs. BA; alpha = 0.01 for FDC vs. Pbo

All other secondary endpoints not included in the step-down procedure will be tested at 
significant level of 0.05 without multiplicity adjustme nt. 
14.7. Exploratory Endpoints  
The proportion of pat ients achiev ing an  LDL- C <70  mg/dL after 12 -week treatment will be 
summarized for each treatment group and the comparison between FDC vs. EZE ; FDC vs. BA , 
and FDC vs. placebo will be based on Chi-sq test or Fi sher’s exact test.  No missing data 
imputation will be applied to this analysis.  
Descriptive summary for p lasma trough concentrations of BA and/or EZE will be provided at 
Weeks  4, 8, and 12 by treatment group.  
Further details will be provided in the SAP. 
14.8. Safety Endpoints  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for summary of TEAEs and other safety assessments.  
TEAEs , SAEs , related AEs , and AESIs will be summarized by system organ class ( SOC ), 
severity, and relationship to study drug for each treatment group.  Fatal AE , AEs leading to 
discontinuation of IMP or study, will each be summarized by treatment group.  Clinical safety laboratories, including hematology, blood chemistry, coagulation, HbA
1C, 
glucose, and urinalysis; PE findings; vital signs; ECG readings; and weight will be summarized  
by the value and by change/percent change from baseline (where appropriate) at each protocol 
scheduled time point.

protocol specifications ( e.g., laboratory reports, clinic notes, study drug disposition log, 
pharmacy  records, patient sign -in sheets, patient completed questionnaires, telephone logs, 
X-rays, and ECGs).  All draft, preliminary, and pre/final iterations of a final report are also 
considered to be source documents ( e.g., faxed and hard copy of laboratory reports, faxed and 
hard copy of initial results, and final report).  
The Investigator agrees to allow direct access to all essential clinical study documents for the  
purpose of monitoring and/or auditing by the Sponsor or its authorized representatives and inspection by the appropriate regulatory authorities. 
Data ref lecting the patient’s participation with the study drug under investigation are to be  
reported to the Sponsor.  The data are to be recorded on the eCRFs and/or other media provided 
or approved by the Sponsor. 
A completed eCRF must be submitted for each patient who receives study drug, regardless of 
duration.  All supportive documentation submitted with the eCRF, such as laboratory or hospital records, should be clearly identified with the study and patient number.  Any personal 
information, including patient name, should be removed or rendered illegible to preserve 
individual confidentiality.  The eCRF should not be used as a source document unless otherwise specified by the Sponsor. 
Neither the Sponsor nor a service provider contracted to analyze data and c omplete the study  
report is permitted to interpret a blank answer; therefore, all fields should be completed.  All  
requested information must be entered on the eCRFs.  If an item is not available or is not 
applicable, this fact should be indicated as not available (N/A) or not done (N/D); do not leave a 
field blank. 
Each set of completed eCRFs for each patient must be signed and dated by the Investigator 
acknowledging  review and that the data are accurate and complete.  The completed database is to 
be returned to  the Sponsor as soon as practical after completion by the mechanism prescribed for 
the protocol.  
It is essential that all dates appearing on the Sponsor’s patient data collection forms for  
laboratory tests, cultures, etc, be the dates on which the specimens were obtained or the 
procedures performed.  The eCRFs will be electronically signed by the Investigator and dated as  
verification of the accuracy of the recorded data.  All data collection forms should be completed within a timely manner according  to the CRF completion guidelines.

NOTE: For patients who withdraw from IMP treatment, they will continue to have visits according to the protocol 
schedule. Safety  assessments should include clinical safety and basic lipid laboratories (except for apoB and 
hs-CRP), adverse events, PE, vital signs, and ECGs. For patients who withdraw from IMP treatment, but refuse to 
come to the clinic for assessments, assessments will take place by phone. The telephone contacts will occur 
according the protocol schedule with information regarding current health status  and to collect information on AEs 
(e.g., recent procedures, hospitalizations, and if the patient has died, the cause of death).

Investigational Product Name: ETC -1002 
Conventions used in this Summary of Changes Document  
1. The text immediately preceding and following a change to the protocol is included for 
each change in order to provide the reviewer with a reference point to identify the change in the protocol. 
2. All locations (ie, section numbers and/or header text) refer to the current protocol version, which incorporates the items specified in this Summary of Changes document. 
3. The original text is from the preceding protocol version. 
4. In the “New Text”, all substantive text added to the protocol is italicized.  
5. In the “New Text”, text deleted from the protocol is indicated in strikethrough font. 
Summary and Justification of Changes 
The protocol was amended for the following: 
• Made administrative changes throughout protocol where required to correct 
inconsistencies, add clarification, or correct errors.  
• Added instructions for collection, processing , and analysis of plasma trough 
bempedoic acid and ezetimibe concentrations.  This new assessment was added to 
generate additional data describing these plasma trough IMP co ncentrations in a large 
clinical study.

Fixed -Dose Combination Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol 1002FDC-053 Amendment 1, 18 October 2017 
 
Confidential Page 95 of 116 • Added instruction to delay ingestion of IMP on clinic visit days until all study 
procedures have been completed.  This instruction was added to enable accurate 
analysis of plasma trough IMP concentrations.  
• Modified description of drug kit to indicate that 4, not 3, blister packs would be provided in each kit.  Four blister packs are needed to supply sufficient drug for 
4-week intervals between treatment visits.  
• Modified instruction for acceptable contraception to functional, not started, on Day 1 to ensure adequate coverage while IMP is being administered.  
• Added instruction to record prior use of statin at any point in the past, not just within 
6 weeks prior to screening.  Extended  statin history will provide additional details 
regarding statins that may have been stopped in the past due to intolerable adverse 
effects.   
• Added comment to exclusion criterion that if test for hepatitis  C antibody is positive, 
but optional reflexive test for hepatitis  C RNA is negative, patient can be enrolled. 
• Removed erroneous statements that DMC and CEC would review data from this 
study on an ongoing basis. 
• Added instruction to inclusion criteria that multiple risk factors of blood pressure, age and HDL-C should be assessed at Week - 2 (Visit S1). 
• Added clarification  that ezetimibe is prohibited unless it is study supplied.  
• Removed reference to randomization number since no specific number is generated. 
• Added a definition for the PK analysis population.

12.1.6.3. Collection and Assessment of Plasma Trough IMP 
Plasma trough IMP will be measured at Weeks 4, 8, and 12.  A single 6-mL whole blood 
sample will be collected and processed by the site according to instructions provided in the 
manual provided by the Central Laboratory.  At the time of sample collection, the date and time of blood draw and the last 2 doses of study medication will also be collected.  Samples will 
be shipped to the central clinical laboratory and subsequently forwarded to a bio-analytical lab 
for measurement and analysis.   
Plasma trough IMP conce ntrations will be measured and analyzed using validated methods 
and will include BA (ETC -1002 and its active metabolite ESP15228) and EZE 
(glucuronidated EZE and unconjugated EZE).

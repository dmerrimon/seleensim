Name of Investigational Product:  
Staccato Alprazolam (STAP -001) 
Name of Active Ingredient:  
alprazolam (8 -Chloro-1- methyl -6-phenyl-4H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazepine) 
Title of Study:  
A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Inpatient, Dose- Ranging Efficacy Study of Staccato 
Alprazolam (STAP -001) in Subjects with Epilepsy with a Predictable Seizure Pattern 
Study center(s): Approximately 50 Study Sites with access to Clinical Research Unit (CRU) or 
Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) in the US, Canada, Australia and Jamaica  
Studied period (years):  
Estimated date first subject screened: March 2018 
Estimated date last subject completed: August 2019  Phase of development: 2b 
Objectives:  
The primary objectives are:  
• To assess the efficacy of STAP -001 in treating a seizure episode 
• To assess the clinical feasibility and safety of the inhalation of STAP -001 in subjects during a 
seizure episode 
• To assess the sedation associated with administration of  STAP -001 
Methodology: 
This is a multi -center, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, dose- ranging study to investigate the 
efficacy and clinical usability of STAP -001 in adult (18 years of age and older) subjects with epilepsy 
with a predictable seizure pattern. These subjects have an established diagnosis of focal or 
generalized epilepsy with a documented history of predictable seizure episodes as outlined in inclusion criterion #3. This is an in- patient study. The subjects will be admitted to a Clinical Research 
Unit (CRU) or Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) for study participation. The duration of the stay in the in -patient unit will be 2-8 days. One seizure event per subject will be treated with study 
medication. A treatable seizure event includes a predictable seizure episode, such that a change in the persistence of the seizure episode can be detected. The duration and timing of the seizure event and occurrence of subsequent seizures will be assessed by the Staff Caregiver(s)
1 through clinical 
observation and confirmed with video electroencephalogram (EEG).  
 
 
1 Staff member(s) assigned and trained to observe the subject throughout the entire Treatment Phase and facilitate 
the study drug administration as appropriate. Staff Caregivers will be accountable for the study medication and each 
handoff will be recorded.

The study consists of two parts: Part 1 Open -Label Feasibility; Part 2 - Double -Blind. Each part is 
divided into four phases: Screening; Qualification prior to entering the in- patient unit; Treatment in 
the in -patient unit; and Post -Treatment Safety Follow -Up. Subjects will provide appropriately- 
obtained informed consent or will have a legally authorized representative (LAR) sign the informed 
consent on his or her behalf prior to completing any study- related procedures.  
The Screening Visit will involve the  items identified in the Schedule of Events, including Informed 
Consent and distribution of the seizure diary. As part of the screening process the seizure events of 
the subjects must be confirmed as acceptable for continuation in the study by the Epilepsy Study 
Consortium Review Board.  Eligible subjects will enter a Qualification phase during which the subject must have at least 4 or more predictable seizure episodes in a 28 -day Qualification Period 
with no more than one week without a predictable episode. The Qualification Period may be extended beyond 28 days up to 56 total days to provide flexibility for scheduling of the Qualification Visit and 
Treatment Visit. The 28 days of the seizure diary activity immediately prior to the Qualification Visit 
will be assessed for qualification. At the end of the Qualification Period the Medical Monitor will 
review the seizure diary to confirm acceptable seizure frequency and subject’s advancement into the Treatment Phase. Subjects meeting the qualification criteria will enter the CRU/EMU within 7 days 
from the end of the Qualification Period. 
Part 1 Open -Label Feasibility  
The first subjects enrolled in the study will participate in an open- label feasibility evaluation. 
Enrollment in this phase will end when there are data from at least eight individual subjects with a 
treated single seizure episode in a CRU/EMU. The subject s will be enrolled in 3- 8 sites, up to three 
subjects per site. Eligible and qualified subjects will receive a single dose of 1 mg STAP -001 at the 
onset of their predictable seizure episode. The subjects will undergo all study procedures and 
evaluations as outlined in this protocol. The feasibility data (with special emphasis on the drug 
administration and clinical assessment procedures) from these eight subjects will be analyzed and 
reviewed by the Sponsor and study team before starting the double -blind pa rt of the study. If deemed 
necessary  based  on the feasibility  data,  the study protocol will  be amended  (for example,  to change  the 
drug administration procedure or to redefine the time frame for primary endpoint assessment), before 
starting the double- blind part of the  study. 
Part 2: Double -Blind  
After  admission to the in-patient unit, eligible  and qualified  subjects will be randomly assigned  (1:1:1) 
to one of two  doses of STAP -001 (1 mg or 2 mg)  or Staccato  placebo. Randomization will be stratified 
by the use of inducing vs non-inducing AEDs  and for use of chronic  daily  benzodiazepines (yes or no). 
For each subject, a single seizure episode will be treated and assessed. Study medication will be self - 
administered (when feasible) or administered by a Staff Caregiver when a predictable seizure episode 
starts. Assessment of the seizure activity is based on clinical observation by the Staff Caregiver using 
a stopwatch. In addition, a video  EEG  will record  the occurrence,  start time,  and duration of the seizure 
event. Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will be collected 10, 30 and 60 minutes, and 2 and 6 hours after 
the administration of the study drug. If possible, subjects will signal when they experience a seizure 
event.  Subject  will  be  under  video  EEG surveillance  throughout  the Treatment  Phase. The  Staff  
Caregiver  will signal  the event  for the video EEG  recording, start the stop watch  at the time of drug

administration, and mark the occurrence of the seizure event on a seizure diary. If the seizure episode 
does not stop within 5 minutes of the st udy drug administration, rescue medication other than 
alprazolam may be administered at the discretion of the principal investigator per the protocol of the 
research unit. The study exit procedures will be conducted 24 to 32 hours after the administration of 
study medication or when the subject discontinues from the study. 
After discharge from the in- patient unit there will be a safety -follow-up phone contact 14 days (±2 
days) after the subject received the study medication.  
Number of subjects (planned):  
Assuming a 10% drop-out/protocol violation rate, approximately 115 subjects will be randomized in 
the double-blind part of the study to provide approximately 35 evaluable subjects per treatment arm. 
Approximately 30% of the overall study population randomi zed in the study may be subjects being 
treated with chronic daily benzodiazepines as part of their epilepsy management. Approximately 9 subjects will be enrolled in the open -label feasibility part to provide 8 evaluable subjects.  
Approximately 50 trial sit es will be recruited to conduct the study. The data base will be locked after 
the last subject included in the double -blind treatment period completes the study.

Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration: 
STAP -001 is a hand-held, single-dose, single-use drug-device combination product using the Staccato 
delivery system. Oral inhalation through the product initiates the controlled rapid heating of a thin 
film of excipient-free alprazolam to form a thermally generated, highly pure drug vapor. The vapor 
condenses into aerosol particles with a particle size distribution appropriate for efficient delivery to the deep lung. The rapid absorption of the drug provides peak plasma levels in the systemic circulation within minutes after administration. 
Each product is packaged inside a sealed foil pouch. Removal of a pull-tab from the product renders it 
ready for use, as indicated by illumination of a green light. Successful dosing is signaled by the 
extinguishing of the green light. 
Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration: 
Matching Staccato Placebo (exactly same inhalation device without coated alprazolam film)  
Duration of treatment:  
Subjects will receive a single dose of study medication.  
Duration of study participation: 
Subjects will participate in the study for up to 12 weeks, including Screening and Follow-Up. The 
Screening/Qualification Phase will last no more than 63 days. After that the subjects will participate 
in the Treatment Phase in the in -patient unit for approximately 2- 8 days. Finally, there’s a safety 
follow- up phone contact 14 days (±2 days) after the subject received the study treatment.  
Criteria for evaluation:  
Efficacy:  
The following will be assessed for every seizure episode and the 12-hour period following study 
medication administration: 
Primary endpoint: 
Proportion of responders in each treatment group achieving seizure activity cessation within 2 
minutes after the administration of the study drug and no recurrence of seizure activity within 2 
hours. 
Secondary endpoints: 
Seizure episode severity assessed by subject and/or Staff Caregiver 
Use of rescue medication  
Secondary generalization (evolution to a complex partial seizure and/or a generalized tonic-clonic 
seizure)  
Exploratory endpoints: 
Number of seizures during the 4, 6, and 12 hour time periods after study drug administration 
Time to next seizure event with start time >2 minutes after study drug administration

Pharmacokinetics:  
Blood samples will be collected for plasma alprazolam concentration measurement pre- dose and at 
10, 30, and 60 minutes, and 2 and 6 hours after the dosing of the study drug. 
 
Safety:  
Safety and tolerability of STAP -001 will be assessed by evaluating advers e events, vital signs, clinical 
laboratory and physical exams. 
Sedation will also be assessed using a patient VAS.  
Statistical methods:  
Sample Size:  
There are no studies in the literature to provide reliable estimates of active treatment or placebo 
response rates. A total of 115 subjects will be enrolled in the double-blind part of the study to provide approximately 35 evaluable subjects per treatment arm [105 patients with approximately 30% of the 
overall study population randomized in the study being subjects with chronic daily benzodiazepines 
as part of their epilepsy management]. Power calculations assume a 2 -sided test and significance level 
of 0.05 with 90% power and are based on the assumption that the proportion of responders with 
STAP-001 is 57% (best active) whereas the assumed placebo responder rate is 20%.  
 
Efficacy Analyses:  
The efficacy population will include all subjects who have a seizure event and receive study drug 
during the double- blind Treatment Period. Data will be summarized by active treatment by dose level 
versus placebo -treated subjects (i.e., by treatment group). Continuous measures will be summarized 
descriptively (mean, stand ard deviation, median, minimum value, and maximum value) and 
categorical measures will be presented as number and percentage.  
All statistical tests will be 2 -sided with a significance value of 0.05. There will be no adjustments for 
multiple comparisons. 
The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted following completion of the double-blind Treatment 
Period for the last subject. Additional details for statistical methods will be provided in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan.  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses:  
The PK population will include all patients who receive study drug and have at least one 
pharmacokinetic sample drawn and analyzed. Plasma concentrations will be summarized by 
descriptive statistics as appropriate and will be listed by patient.  
Safety Anal yses:  
The safety population will include all subjects who receive study drug in the Treatment phase from 
both Part 1 and Part 2. Adverse events will be coded by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Concomitant medications will be 
summarized by World Health Organization Drug Dictionary Anatomical-Therapeutic- Chemical 
(WHODrug -ATC) classification and preferred term. Adverse events (AEs), vital sign measurements, 
physical examination findings, electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory information, and concomitant 
medications will be tabulated and summarized by treatment and dose level. Separate tabulations will be produced for all treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs), TEAEs (by relationship to study drug), serious 
AEs (SAEs), discontinuations due to AEs or TEAEs, and AEs ≥ Grade 3 severity. By-subject listings 
will be provided for any deaths, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment.

4. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
4.1. Background  Information  
Staccato Alprazolam (STAP -001) is a single- use, hand-held, drug-device combination product 
that provides rapid systemic delivery by inhalation of a thermally generated aerosol of 
alprazolam. STAP -001 represents a new dosage form for alprazolam. 
 
STAP -001 is based on the proprietary Staccato delivery system developed by Alexza 
Pharmaceuticals, the product manufacturer (Section 4.2.2). STAP-001 is delivered orally to the deep lung for systemic delivery. The pharmacokinetics of STAP -001 is therefore similar to IV 
injec tions. The Staccato delivery system is user -friendly. Device actuation, aerosol formation, 
and delivery of the aerosolized drug to the deep lung are all accomplished with a single, normal breath by the subject. Achievement of peak plasma levels within minutes via a simple, user - 
friendly delivery system makes STAP -001 ideal for the acute treatment of seizures.  
 
Epilepsy is a brain disorder characterized by predisposition to experience recurrent seizures. It can occur as a result of a neurological injury, a structural brain lesion, as a part of many systemic medical diseases or may be genetic in origin. When seizures are not well controlled patients might have a need for acute treatment in addition to their maintenance anti- epileptic drug (AED) 
or might exper ience seizures emergencies.  
 
Alprazolam was selected as the drug to incorporate with Staccato for these acute seizures for several reasons. Benzodiazepines are the drug class of choice in treating seizure emergencies. Like the other benzodiazepines, alpra zolam is an allosteric modulator at multiple GABA -A 
receptor subtypes, which is important since antiseizure properties are believed to be mediated by actions on different GABA-A subtypes. Second, alprazolam is potent and efficacious in various animal models of antiseizure activity ( De Sarro et al, 1996; Herink 1997; Jenck et al, 1992; Ueki 
et al, 1981) and in one comparator study was more potent than either clonazepam or diazepam in reducing audiogenic seizures ( De Sarro et al, 1996 ). Alprazolam’s well-documented anxiolytic 
action could also be of benefit in calming the individual. 
 
There are many advantages of STAP -001 for the acute treatment of seizures compared to 
existing therapy or products in development. Alprazolam is a potent , well -characterized and 
well-tolerated benzodiazepine, has rapid onset with a Tmax of 2 minutes, and the Staccato 
system delivers drugs non -invasively to the deep lung producing reliable IV- like 
pharmacokinetics. The breath -activated device delivers the d rug while the subject simply takes a 
single inspiration through the mouthpiece without any other coordination needed. This drug delivery allows for self -administration and high reliability of delivery, producing rapid drug 
delivery and fast onset of action. 
STAP -001 was assessed in the Intermittent Photic Stimulation (IPS) model in subjects with 
photosensitive epilepsy as a proof of concept study (Protocol AMDC 002-202) for its potential as 
an AED. The positive results generated in this study provided the basis and rationale for this current protocol in studying STAP- 001in subjects experiencing a seizure episode. The clinical 
development program for STAP-001 will focus on subtypes of subjects diagnosed with focal or generalized seizure disorder in which acut e treatment with a benzodiazepine for a rapid anti- 
seizure activity could be beneficial. STAP -001 has been shown to produce a rapid rise in 
alprazolam plasma levels (< 2min) and effects on EEG in subjects with photosensitive epilepsy

indication under an open IND in the Division of Psychiatry Products and some of the studies 
conducted under that IND are not directly applicable to the STAP-001 epilepsy program and therefore will not be discussed below. 
Relevant to this protocol, a Phase 1 clinical study in healthy volunteers evaluating 
pharmacokinetics and safety of STAP -001 following single doses of 0.125 mg to 2 mg (Study 
002-101) and a Phase 2A trial to assess the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of a single 
inhaled dose of STAP-001 on the IPS model in photosensitive epilepsy subjects (Study 002-202) 
have been conducted. 
In healthy volunteers (Study 002-101), the overall percentage of subjects who experienced at 
least one AE during treatment was 68%. The overall percent of subjects  experiencing adverse 
events was higher (range 50 - 100%) in the STAP-001 groups than in the placebo group (10%). Within the STAP -001 group, the incidence appeared to be dose dependent with adverse events 
reported in 100% subjects after the highest dose (2 mg). The most frequently reported AEs were dizziness, dysgeusia, fatigue, and somnolence. In general, the adverse events observed following STAP -001 administration were those expected based on the pharmacological activity of the 
compound and were similar to AEs reported after oral delivery of comparable alprazolam doses.  
 
STAP -001 was assessed in the IPS model as a proof of concept study (Protocol AMDC 002-202) 
to evaluate it as a potential AED. The study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
cross over, placebo-controlled study in 5 subjects with a known stable photoparoxysmal response 
on EEG. STAP -001 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg were compared to single doses of Staccato Placebo. 
The subjects received placebo on 2 study days, and active medication on 3 study days. During the study days, several procedures and IPS assessments were performed at 8 pre- determined 
times over the course of the day (1 assessment pre-dose and 7 assessments post-dose). After the screening visit, subjects returned 5 additional time s and received Staccato Placebo (2 times) and 
STAP -001 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg in random order. Visits were at least 7 days apart.  
 
All 5 of the subjects in the study were white female adult volunteers. The subjects ranged in age from 23 to 39 years (mean, 27.2 years) and had a mean weight and body mass index (BMI) of 70.4 kg and 25.4kg/m2, respectively. 
 
A total of 4 subjects (80.0%) experienced at least 1 treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) 
during the study. The number of subjects experiencing AEs was similar between each of the treatments, with STAP -001 2 mg (n=4) and STAP-001 1 mg (n=3) having the most subjects 
reporting AEs. All of the AEs reported were mild or moderate in intensity. Nervous system disorders were reported by the highest number of subjects (n=4). There were no reports of dyspnea, wheezing or bronchospasm in any of the subjects. 
 
STAP -001 was effective in reducing the Standardized Photosensitivity Range (SPR) at the 
earliest measured time point (2 min) and the effect was sustained through the 4 -hour time point 
for the 0.5 mg dose and the 6 hour time point for the 1 and 2 mg dose. A dose effect was apparent from 0.5 to 1 mg, however there was no apparent difference between the 1 and 2 mg dose on SPR. 
 
There was a rapid and marked effect of treatment with STAP -001 relative to Staccato Placebo 
treatment on the pharmacodynamics measures  of sedation and sleepiness. The magnitude of 
effect was greater for the 2 mg doses and less for the 0.5 mg dose at all time points. In addition, the duration of the sedation/sleepiness appears to vary by dose with the 0.5 mg dose resulting in

the shortest duration (approximately 4 hrs) and the 2 mg dose resulting in the longest duration (6 
hrs or greater) relative to baseline. The 1 mg dose generally fell between the low and high dose 
for both magnitude and duration of sedation/sleepiness effec ts.

7. OVERALL STUDY  DESIGN 
 
This is a multi- center, dose- ranging study to investigate the efficacy, safety, and clinical usability 
of STAP -001. Subjects (18 years of age and older) who have an established diagnosis of focal or 
gener alized epilepsy with a documented history of predictable seizure episodes will be enrolled. 
This is an in -patient study.  Eligible and qualified subjects will be admitted to a CRU or EMU 
for study participation. The duration of the stay in the in- patient u nit during the Treatment phase 
will be 2 -8 days. One seizure event per subject will be treated with study medication. A treatable 
seizure event includes a predictable seizure episode, such that a change in the persistence of the 
seizure episode can be detected. The duration and timing of the seizure event and occurrence of 
subsequent seizures will be assessed by the study Staff Caregiver(s)1 through clinical observation 
and confirmed with video EEG.  
The study consists of two parts: Part 1- Open -Label Feasibility; Part 2 - Double-Blind. Each Part 
is divided into four phases: Screening; Qualification prior to entering the in -patient unit; 
Treatment in the in -patient unit; and Post- Treatment Safety Follo w-Up. Subjects or the subject’s 
LAR will provide appropriately-obtained informed consent prior to completing any study- related 
procedures. 
The Screening visit will involve the items identified in the Schedule of Events (Appendix 1A), 
including Informed Consent and distribution of the seizure subject diary. As part of the screening process the seizure events of the subjects must be confirmed as acceptable for continuation in the study by the Epilepsy Study Consortium Review Board. Eligible subjects will enter a Qualification phase during which the subject must have at least 4 or more seizure 
episodes in a 28-day Qualification Period, with no more than one week without a predictable 
seizure episode. The Qualification Period may be extended beyond 28 days up to 56 total days to provide flexibility for scheduling of the Qualification Visit and Treatment Visit. The 28 days of the seizure diary activity immediately prior to the Qualification Visit will be assessed for qualification. At the end of the Qualification  Period the Medical Monitor will review the seizure 
diary to confirm acceptable seizure frequency and subject’s advancement into the Treatment Phase. Subjects meeting the qualification criteria will enter the CRU/EMU within 7 days from the end of the Quali fication  Period. 
 
 
Part 1: Open -Label Feasibility  
The first subjects enrolled in the study will participate in an open -label feasibility evaluation. 
Enrollment in this phase will end when there are data from at least eight individual subjects with 
a treated single seizure episode in a CRU/EMU. The subject s will be enrolled in 3 -8 sites, up to 
 
 
1 Staff member(s) assigned and trained to observe the subject throughout the Treatment Phase and facilitate the 
study drug administration as appropriate. Staff Caregivers will be accountable for the study medicatio n and each 
handoff will be recorded.

three subjects per site. Eligible subjects will receive a single, dose of 1 mg STAP-001 at the 
onset of their predictable seizure episode. The subjects will undergo all study procedures and evaluations as outlined in this protocol. The feasibility data (with special emphasis on the drug administration and clinical assessment procedures) from these eight subjects will be analyzed 
and reviewed by the Sponsor before starting the double-blind part of the study. If deemed 
necessary based on the feasibility data,  the study protocol will be amended (for example, to 
change the drug administration procedure or to redefine the time frame for primary endpoint assessment), before starting the double-blind part of the study. 
Part 2: Double- Blind  
After admission to the in -patient unit eligible and qualified subjects will be stratified by the use 
of inducing vs non-inducing AED and for the use of chronic daily benzodiazepines (yes or no) 
and randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of two doses of STAP-001 (1 mg or 2 mg) or Staccat o 
placebo. A blood sample for PK analysis (pre-dose) will be obtained. For each subject, a single 
seizure episode will be treated and assessed. Study medication will be self -administered (when 
feasible) or administered by a Staff Caregiver when a predictable seizure episode starts.  
Assessment of the seizure activity is based on clinical observation by the Staff Caregiver using a 
stop watch. In addition, a video EEG will record the occurrence, start time, and duration, of the 
seizure event. PK samples will be collected 10, 30 and 60 minutes, and 2 and 6 hours after the 
administration of the study drug. If possible, subjects will signal when they experience a seizure event. Subject will be under video EEG surveillance throughout the Treatment Phase. The Staff Caregiver will signal the event for the video EEG recording, starts the stop watch at the time of 
drug administration, and mark the occurrence of the seizure event on a seizure diary. If the 
seizure episode does not stop within 5 minutes of the study drug administration, rescue medication other than alprazolam may be administered at the discretion of the principal investigator per the protocol of the research unit. The study exit procedures will be conducted 24 
to 32 hours after the administration of study medication or when the subject discontinues from 
the study. 
After discharge from the in -patient unit there will be a safety -follow-up phone contact 14 ±2 
days after the subject received the study medication.  
 
7.1. Number of Subjects and  Sites  
Assuming a 10% drop-out/protocol violation rate, approximately 115 subjects will be 
randomized in the double-blind part of the study to provide approximately 35 evaluable subjects per treatment arm. Enrollment may be stopped after 105 evaluable subjects ha ve completed the 
double-blind phase of the study. Approximately 30% of the overall study population randomized 
in the study may be subjects being treated with chronic daily benzodiazepines as part of their 
epilepsy management. Approximately nine subjects w ill be enrolled in the open label feasibility 
part to provide at least eight evaluable subjects. Approximately 50 trial sites will be recruited to conduct the study.

7.2. Method of Treatment Assignment and Blinding (Double Blind  Phase)  
After admission to the in -patient unit subjects will be randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of 2 
doses of STAP-001 (1 mg or 2 mg) or Staccato placebo. Randomization will be stratified by the 
use of inducing vs non-inducing AEDs, and by use of daily benzodiazepines (yes or no) to ensure even distribution of treatment assignments in the two cohorts. 
All study participants will be blinded to study drug assignment. The device and packaging of 
STAP -001and placebo will be identical in appearance. 
 
7.3. Rationale for Stud y Design  
Part 1 is open-label and designed to assess feasibility of the study. Part 2 is double blind and 
randomized and is designed to assess treatment efficacy and safety. Double-blind, randomized, placebo -controlled studies are considered optimal for obtaining unbiased estimates of the 
efficacy and safety of investigational products. The single dose administration of STAP-001 during a seizure episode is sufficient to evaluate the safety and potential of the product as an acute treatment of an epileptic episode. 
A large proportion of subjects with epilepsy with a predictable seizure pattern are taking chronic 
daily benzodiazepine medication. It has been speculated that the efficacy of STAP -001 may be 
reduced in these subjects because of potential cross -tolerance b etween benzodiazepines. 
However, it is deemed important to evaluate the efficacy of STAP-001 in this population. It is also important to evaluate the tolerability and safety of STAP -001 in subjects on chronic 
benzodiazepine treatment in a controlled environment. Therefore, approximately 30% of the overall study population randomized in the study may be subjects being treated with chronic daily benzodiazepines as part of their epilepsy management. The subjects will be stratified by concomitant chronic daily benzodiazepine use to ensure even distribution of benzodiazepine use across treatment arms.  
 
 
7.3.1. Rationale for Dose Selection  
 
To date, STAP-001 has been studied in approximately 140 subjects, including healthy 
volunteers, subjects with panic disorder, individuals with a history of sedative abuse, subjects with photosensitive epilepsy, and in subjects with epilepsy with predictable seizure patterns. In all cases, the drug was generally well tolerated with dosing up to 2 mg. Sedation is a common side effect of alprazolam and also provides a pharmacodynamic marker of CNS activity. In all studies to date, the sedation observed has been temporally associated with peak plasma levels, which typically occur within a few minutes of dosing, and sedation tended to be more 
pronounced with the 2 mg dose. In Study 002-202 (see summary in Section 4.4.2), the effects on 
IPS were observed for the 0.5 mg, 1 mg and 2 mg doses. The IPS effect seemed similar for the 1 mg and 2 mg doses but there did appear to be a slightly greater extent and a longer duration of sedation at the 2 mg dose. Therefore, the 0.5 mg and 1 mg doses were initially chosen for this study.  
The analysis of the first five patients in the open label feasibility part of this study (ENGAGE-E- 001) has shown a 60% responder rate with the 1 mg dose. In addition, the plasma alprazolam

concentrations of the first subjects that were dosed have been low. A further analysis of the PK 
data from previous studies has shown that the 2 mg dose consistently provides a higher exposure to alprazolam during the first 2 minutes after administration , whereas the 0.5 mg or 1 mg doses 
provide more flat concentrations of alprazolam. Based on these analyses it is likely that 0.5 mg of Staccato alprazolam will not be an efficacious dose. Staccato alprazolam has been generally well tolerated with dosing up  to 2 mg. Therefore, the two doses of Staccato alprazolam for the 
double-blind part of the study will be amended from 0.5 mg and 1 mg to 1 mg and 2 mg.

35 
Page 755 of 8417  V 7.0  CONFIDENTIAL   
 • Do not follow guidelines specified in the protocol (i.e., is noncompliant with protocol 
procedures) 
 
In addition, subjects may be withdrawn for any medically appropriate reason or significant protocol violation, in the opinion of the Investigator. 
Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study will not be replaced. 
 
8.3.1. Subject Withdrawal  Procedures  
A subject who prematurely discontinues study participation should have all assessments 
performed per the Exit Procedures if possible. 
If a subject terminates early from the study, the Investigator will record the reason(s) for ea rly 
termination on the relevant electronic case report form (eCRF). The specific reason for the 
withdrawal should be carefully documented on the eCRF. 
Adverse events resulting in subject early termination will be followed to the satisfactory 
resolution and determination of outcome, as ascertained by the Investigator (and/or Sponsor, or its designee); See Section 12.1.2: Adverse Events. The data will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  
 
 
8.4. Emergency Unblinding of Treatment  Assignment  
In the case of a medical requirement to break the blind to determine appropriate treatment for an 
adverse event, unblinding of a subject’s treatment assignment can be achieved through the study- specific Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). If possible, the Investigator should discuss the circumstances with the Medical Monitor prior to accessing unblinding information. In the event of a blind break, the Medical Monitor will be notified through the electronic data capture system. The subject for whom the blind is broken should be subsequently withdrawn from the study. The details regarding the process of breaking the blind are outlined in the Pharmacy Manual.

9. STUDY SCHEDULE AND PROCEDURES  
Subjects enrolled in this study will undergo only those procedures described in this protocol. No 
study-related procedures can be performed prior to receiving informed consent from the subject or the subject’s LAR. See the Schedule of Events and Schedule of Events – Procedures in CRU/EMU (Appendix 1A and Appendix 1B) for a summary of the study procedures. 
 
9.1. Part 1: Open Label  Feasibility 
9.1.1.  Screening  Visit  
At the Screening Visit, it will be confirmed that the subject meets all inclusion and exclusion 
criteria and the procedures described in the Schedule of Events (Appendix 1A) will be 
performed, including: a full neurological and physical examination; vital signs assessment; 
medical history; blood draw for routine labs; 12 lead ECG; and urine drug and alcohol sc reen. A 
urine pregnancy test will be performed on females of childbearing potential. 
After screening, the doses of the background AEDs should be kept stable if possible. If dose 
changes are deemed necessary, continued study participation of the subject should be discussed 
with the Medical Monitor.  
 
9.1.2. Qualification  Phase  
Subjects meeting all the requirements during the Screening visit will be given a Seizure Diary 
and asked to record their seizure episodes over the next 4 weeks. In order for the subject to remain eligible and qualify for the study, they will have to have a t least 4 predictable seizure 
episodes, within the 28-day Qualification Period. The Qualification Period may be extended beyond 28 days up to 56 total days to provide flexibility for scheduling of the Qualification Visit and Treatment Visit. The 28 days of the seizure diary activity immediately prior to the Qualification Visit will be assessed for qualification. There will be a visit at the end of the 
Qualification Period, during which the subject will turn in their seizure diary. At the end of the 
Qualification Period, the Medical Monitor will review the Seizure Diary to confirm acceptable seizure frequency and subject’s advancement into the Treatment Phase. Subjects meeting the qualification criteria will enter the CRU/EMU within 7 days from the end of the  Qualification 
Period. 
 
9.1.3. Treatment Phase  
The first subjects enrolled in the study will participate in an open -label feasibility evaluation and 
enrollment in this phase will end when there are data from eight individual subjects having 
seizure events in the CRU/EMU. Subjects meeting eligibility and qualification criteria will be 
admitted to the CRU/EMU, be assessed for continued eligibility according to the procedures in the Schedule of Events – Procedures in CRU/EMU (Appendix 1B), and be hooked up with EEG recording electrodes which will remain in place for the duration of the study. It is required that a 
Staff Caregiver be present to provide 1:1 coverage with the subject while in the CRU/EMU to 
watch for signs of a seizure episode. After the EEG electrode ho ok-up is complete, each subject

Page 757 of 8417  V 7.0  CONFIDENTIAL   
  
will be assigned a single 1 mg STAP -001 device that will be removed from the pouch and 
dispensed to the Staff Caregiver until drug administration. At the onset of the predictable seizure 
episode, the Staff Caregiver will activate the device and give to the subject if the subject is capable of self -administration or will assist in helping the subject to administer the drug. The 
Staff Caregiver will signal the onset of the seizure event on the video EEG, start the stopwatch and mark the occurrence of the seizure event on a seizure diary. At 2 minutes after study drug administration, the Staff Caregiver will record whether the seizure event has ceased or is still ongoing. The Staff Caregiver will observe the subject for the next 2 hours and record seizure 
activ ity on a seizure diary during this time period. After this the Staff Caregiver will continue 
observation throughout the 24 hours following drug administration. If over the course of 7 days 
there is no treatable seizure episode, the subject will be dismisse d, after completing Exit 
Procedures. Note that the procedures in the Schedule of Events for the treatment day are only conducted on the day there is a treatable seizure event and drug has been administered. 
The feasibility data (with special emphasis on the drug administration and clinical assessment 
procedures) from these eight subjects will be analyzed and reviewed by the Sponsor and study team before continuing to enroll subjects in the double-blind part of the study. If necessary, the study protocol will be amended (for example, to change the drug administration procedure or to redefine the time frame for primary endpoint assessment) before starting the double-blind part of 
the study. 
When multiple procedures are scheduled at the same time point, the VAS assessment should be 
performed first, immediately followed by the PK draw.  
All Staccato doses will be administered as one puff from a single inhalation device by the subject with or without the assistance of the study Staff Caregiver. The exact time of a dministration and 
correct intake of the medication will be noted and recorded in the CRF. 
Subjects should have minimal postural changes for the first 1.5 hours after administration of 
study drug. 
 
 
9.2. Part 2:  Double -Blind  
9.2.1. Screening  Visit  
At the Screening Visit, it will be confirmed that the subject meets all inclusion and exclusion 
criteria and the procedures described in the Schedule of Events (Appendix 1A) will be 
performed, including: a full neurological and physical examination; vital signs assessment; medical history; blood draw for routine labs; 12 lead ECG; and urine drug and alcohol screen. A urine pregnancy test will be performed on females of childbearing potential. Device training 
including study drug administration procedures will be conducted. Training may include subject 
use of a practice ‘dummy’ device that does not contain any active drug.

After screening, the doses of the background AEDs should be kept stable if possible. If the dose 
changes are deemed necessary, continued study participation of the subject should be discussed with the Medical Monitor.  
 
9.2.2. Qualification  Phase  
Subjects meeting all the requirements during the Screening visit will be given a Seizure Diary 
and asked to record their seizure episodes over the next 4 weeks. In order for the subject to 
remain eligible and qualify for the study, they will have to have a t least 4 predictable seizure 
episodes, within the 28-day Qualification Period. The Qualification Period may be extended beyond 28 days up to 56 total days to provide flexibility for scheduling of the Qualification Visit 
and Treatment Visit. The 28 days of seizure diary activity immediately prior to the Qualification 
Visit will be assessed for qualification. There will be a visit at the end of the Qualification Period, during which the subject will turn in their seizure diary. At the end of the Qualification Period the Medical Monitor will review the Seizure Diary to confirm acceptable seizure frequency and subject’s advancement into the Treatment Phase. Subjects meeting the 
qualification criteria will enter to the CRU/EMU within 7 days from end of the Qualification 
Period. 
 
9.2.3. Treatment Phase  
 
Subjects meeting eligibility criteria will be admitted to the CRU/EMU and be assessed for continued eligibility according to the procedures for CRU/EMU entry in the Schedule of Events 
– Procedures in CRU/EMU (Appendix 1B). Device training including study drug administration 
procedures will be conducted. Training may include subject use of a practice ‘dummy’ device that does not contain any active drug. Eligible subjects will be stratified for use of inducing vs. non-inducing AEDs and for the use of chronic daily benzodiazepines, and randomly assigned to 
a treatment arm and be hooked up with EEG recording electrodes which will remain in place for 
the duration of the study. It is required that a Staff Caregiver be present to provide 1:1 coverage 
with the subject while in the CRU/EMU to watch for signs of a seizure episode. After randomization and EEG electrode hook-up is complete, the study medication, assigned to the 
subject, will be remov ed from the pouch and dispensed to the Staff Caregiver until drug 
administration. At the onset of the predictable seizure event, the Staff Caregiver will activate the 
device and give to the subject if the subject is capable of self -administration or will a ssist in 
helping the subject to administer the drug. The Staff Caregiver will signal the onset of the seizure 
event on the video EEG, start the stopwatch and mark the occurrence of the seizure event on a 
seizure diary. At 2 minutes after study drug administration, the Staff Caregiver will record whether the seizure event has ceased or is still ongoing. The Staff Caregiver will observe the subject for the next 2 hours and record seizure activity on a seizure diary during this time period. 
After this the Staf f Caregiver will continue observation throughout the 24 hours following 
blinded study medication administration. During the seizure episode period, study procedures 
will be conducted according to the schedule in the Schedule of Events – Procedures  in

11. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  DESCRIPTIONS  
The schedule of assessments and procedures is presented in the Schedule of Events (Appendix 
1A and 1B) and should be referenced for details regarding the collection of each assessment at each visit.  
 
11.1. Demographic Characteristics and Medical History  
Demograp hic characteristics (i.e., gender, race and ethnic origin, date of birth, and calculated 
body mass index) will be collected at the Screening Visit, and detailed on the eCRF.  
Thorough medical history, including EEG and brain imaging (MRI/CT) findings within the last 5 
years, history of seizures, seizure pattern, frequency and characteristics during the last 12 months. Current medications, and co- morbidities will be collected at the Screening Visit and 
reviewed and updated at entry into the CRU/EMU for the Treatment Phase. Epilepsy history and seizure documentation are collated and submitted to the Epilepsy Study Consortium Review Board for review. 
11.2. Vital Signs, Weight, and  Height  
Vital signs will be measured after the subject has been in a supine or semi -supine position for at 
least 5 minutes and will include blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and oral temperature 
as defined in the Schedule of Events. 
Weight will be me asured per institution standard of care. Subjects should wear light clothing and 
remove his/her shoes before weight is measured. Height will be measured per institution 
standard of care, after the subject has removed his/her shoes. Height will only be meas ured at the 
Screening Visit. Weight and vital signs will be measured at each study visit according to the Schedule of Events. Weight and height will be used to calculate the subject’s body mass index at Screening. Weight and height will be converted as needed to kilograms and centimeters, respectively, prior to statistical analyses.  
11.3. Physical and Neurological Examination  
A complete physical examination will include an examination of all major organ systems, and 
will be performed as indicated in the Schedule of Events (Appendix 1A and Appendix 1B). A complete neurological examination will be performed as indicated in the Schedule of Events (Appendix 1A and Appendix 1B). 
 
11.4. 12-Lead  Electrocardiogram  
 
Twelve- lead ECGs will be performed after the subject has rested in a supine or semi -supine 
position for at least 5 minutes. Individual parameters including heart rate, PR, QT, QTcF, QRS, 
and RR intervals will be collected. Repeat ECGs (if deemed necessary)  should be performed at 
least 5 minutes apart. The Investigator should indicate review of the electrocardiogram reports throughout the study by signing and dating each report.

11.5. Seizure  Assessment  
11.5.1. Staff Caregiver Seizure Episode Recording  
It is required that a Staff Caregiver be present to provide 1:1 coverage with the subject while in 
the CRU/EMU. At the onset of the predictable seizure episode, the Staff Caregiver will activate the device and give to the subject if the subject is capable of self -administration or will assist in 
helping the subject to administer the drug. The Staff Caregiver will signal the onset of the seizure episode on the video EEG, start a stopwatch and record the onset of the seizure episode. At 2 minutes after study drug administration, the Staff Caregiver will record whether the seizure episode has ceased or is still ongoing. The Staff Caregiver will observe the subject for the next 2 hours and record seizure activity on a seizure diary during this time period. After this the Staff Caregiver will continue observation throughout the 24 hours following drug administration. 
 
11.5.2. Video Electroencephalogram  (EEG)  
A 19 -21-channel recording system will be used with a bipolar derivation. The display montage 
will include T4 -T6-O2-O1-T5-T3 and T4- P4-Pz-P3-T3, apart from 2x4 (8) frontal to occipital 
leads.  
Subjects will be fitted with EEG electrodes according to the international 10 -20 system upon 
reporting to the CRU/EMU. The EEG electrodes will remain in place for the duration of the stay 
in the CRU/EMU.  
EEG data will be sent to a central reader and evaluated in a blinded fashion.  
 
11.5.3. Seizure Episode Severity  Assessment  
At the 6 hour time point after dose administration the subject will assess the seizure episode just 
experienced in relation to previous seizures experienced by the subject using the assessment tool 
found in the Appendix 3. 
 
11.6. Pharmacokinetic  Sampling  
Blood samples will be collected into evacuated K2 EDTA tubes, e.g., Vacutainer®, from each subject according to the times specified in the Schedule of Events – Procedures in CRU/EMU (Appendix 1B). An indwelling catheter inserted into the forearm, or direct venipuncture may be used during the blood sampling procedure. 
The total volume of blood drawn from each subject during this study will be approximately 100 
mL, which includes approximately 24 mL for pharmacokinetic analysis and approximately 70 
mL for sta ndard pre- study and post study clinical laboratory tests.  
Specific sample collection, preparation and shipping instructions will be provided to the study site. Samples will be assayed using validated methods. Instructions for harvesting and preparing 
plasm a samples prior to freezing and additional procedures for blood sample collection will be 
provided in separate study laboratory manual. 
 
11.7. Sedation Assessment - Visual Analog Scale  (VAS)  
The visual analog scale is a distinct 100 millimeter line anchored on the left end at full degree of 
impairment and on the right end at no degree of impairment, where indication of the degree of impairment perceived at the time of assessment is captured by marking the appropriate position

on the line between the anchor points. The measured distance of the mark from the left anchor 
will be recorded in millimeters  
As specified in the Schedule of Events – Procedures in CRU/EMU (Appendix 1B), sedation will 
be measured using a 100- mm linear visu al analogue scale (VAS). The subject will be given 2 
scales, 1 anchored by “Sedated” and “Alert, the other by “Sleepy and “Awake” and asked to “Place a vertical mark on the line indicating your feelings RIGHT NOW”. The location of the mark will be measured  at a later time and the results will be recorded in mm from the left on the 
appropriate eCRF.  
An example of the subject VAS is provided in Appendix 2. The paper scales will be provided to 
the sites and only originals can be used for subject assessment. Photocopies cannot be provided for subject assessment.  
 
 
11.8. Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
Blood and urine samples will be collected according to standard medical guidelines and processed at a clinical laboratory. Sample collections, handling and shipping instructions are provided in the clinical laboratory document. Study- related clinical laboratory as sessments are 
presented below in  Table 2
: Clinical Laboratory  Assessments  
Clinical laboratory samples should be collected according to the Schedule of Events -Procedures 
in CRU/EMU (Appendix 1B). 
The results of clinical laboratory tests conducted at the S creening Visit (and prior to dosing) 
must be assessed by the Investigator to determine each subject’s eligibility for participation in 
the study. Laboratory values that are out of range at screening may be repeated at the 
investigator’s discretion. The Investigator should indicate review of the laboratory reports throughout the study by signing and dating each report. 
Following study drug administration, all clinical laboratory results that fall outside the reference 
range will be interpreted by the Investi gator as Abnormal, not clinically significant, or 
Abnormal, clinically significant. Laboratory results deemed Abnormal, clinically significant 
should be fully investigated and repeated for verification. Additional tests and evaluations 
required to establis h the significance or etiology of a clinically significant abnormal result or to 
monitor the course of an adverse event should be obtained when clinically indicated. All 
clinically significant out-of-range laboratory values will be followed until they return to normal or stabilize; the investigator will treat the subject as medically required at appropriate intervals until this occurs. 
Any significant laboratory abnormalities that are either serious or unexpected will be promptly 
reported to the Sponsor. Any additional relevant laboratory results obtained by the Investigator during the course of this study will be reported to the Sponsor or designee. 
Laboratory values will be reported as an adverse event following the guidelines in section 12.1.1.

12. ADVERSE  EVENTS  
12.1.1. Definition of Adverse Event  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject 
during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject’s health , including laboratory 
test values, regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a pre-existing condition) should be considered an adverse event. A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the adverse event page of the eCRF rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome. A worsening of the condition under study will not be reported as an adverse event. 
All subjects will be monitored for adverse events during the study. Assessments may include 
monitoring of the following parameters:  the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory, physical examination findings, or findings from other tests and/or procedures.  
An adverse event reported after informed consent and occurring before the first dose of study 
drug in the CRU/EMU, will be considered a pretreatment adverse event and will be captured on the eCRF. Adverse events will be considered treatment- emergent if th e onset is after the 
first dose of study drug.  
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an adverse event or a component of an 
adverse event if the abnormality:  
• results in discontinuation from the study;  
• is judged by the Investigator to be of significant clinical importance requiring treatment, modification/interruption of investigational product dose, or any other therapeutic intervention 
Regardless of severity grade, only laboratory abnormalities that fu lfill a seriousness  criterion 
need to be documented as a serious adverse event.  
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the adverse event eCRF. If the abnormality was not a part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory abnormality should be 
recorded as the adverse event. If possible, the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as 
a medical term and not simply as an abnormal laboratory result (e.g., record thrombocytopenia rather than decreased  platelets).  
12.1.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events  
A qualified Investigator will evaluate all adverse events as to seriousness, severity/intensity, relationship to study drug, duration, action taken, and outcome. 
 
12.1.2.1. Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is an adverse event, as per Title 21 CFR 312.32 and ICH E2A.II.B that fulfills the following criteria:  
Staccato Alprazolam (STAP -001) 
Protocol ENGAGE -E-001 01 February  2019  
Engage Therapeutics,  Inc. 
48 V 7.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 768 of 8417   
 • Is fatal (results in  death);  
• Is life -threatening (Note: the term "life -threatening" refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event that could hypothetically have caused death had it been more severe);  
• Requires inpat ient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
(hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay);  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the subject's abi lity to conduct normal life  functions); 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  or 
• Constitutes an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes 
listed  above. 
Impor tant medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death, hospitalization, or disability, but may jeopardize the 
subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other out comes listed 
above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization.  
Events not considered to be s erious adverse events are hospitalizations for:  
• A procedure for protocol/disease-related investigations (e.g., sampling for 
laboratory, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic tests). However, 
hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication of such procedures 
remains a reportable serious adverse event.  
• Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization for technical, practical, or social 
reasons, in absence of an adverse event.  
• A procedure that is planned (i.e., planned prior to the starting of treatment on 
study); must be documented in the source document and the eCRF. 
Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication remains a reportable serious adverse event.  
• An elective treatment of or an elective procedure for a pre -existing  medical 
condition that does not worsen. 
• Emergency outpatient treatment or observation that does not result in admission, unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria  above. 
If an adverse event is considered serious, the adverse event eCRF must be completed.  
For each s erious adverse event, the Investigator will provide information on severity, start 
and stop dates, relationship to investigational product, action taken regarding investigational product, and outcome.

Queries pertaining to serious adverse events will be handled through the electronic data 
capture system or other appropriate means. Urgent queries (e.g., missing causality assessment) may be handled by telephone.  
 
12.1.2.2. Severity/Intensity  
For both adverse events and serious adverse events, the Investigator must assess the 
severity/intensity of the event. 
The National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
Version 4.0 should be used to grade the severity/intensity of all events. Th ese criteria will be 
provided in the Site Operations Manual.  If a CTCAE criterion does not exist, the 
Investigator should grade the severity according to the following criteria:  
• Grade 1 (mild): does not interfere with the subject’s usual function 
• Grade 2 (moderate): interferes to some extent with subject's usual  function 
• Grade 3 (severe): interferes significantly with subject's usual  function 
• Grade 4 (life -threatening): results in a threat to life or in an incapacitating 
disability  
• Grade 5 (death): results  in death  
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This criterion is not the same as “serious” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. 
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining regulatory obligations. 
 
12.1.2.3. Relationship  to Study  Drug  
Relationship should be assessed and provided for every adverse event/serious adverse event 
based on currently available information. Relationship is to be reassessed and provided as additional information becomes available. Adverse events wi ll be classified by the 
Investigator as follows: 
Definitely Related : There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other 
possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal 
laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to drug administration and cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. The event would be considered as definitely related to the study drug upon results of a positive re- challenge 
procedure.

Page 768 of 8417   
  
Probably Related : There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, the 
influence of other factors that may have contributed to the event (e.g., the subject’s clini cal 
condition, other concurrent disease, concomitant medications or events) is unlikely. 
Possibly Related: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred 
within a reasonable time after administration of the study drug). However, the influence of 
other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the subject’s clinical condition, other 
concurrent disease, concomitant medications or events). 
Unlikely Related : A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose 
temporal relationship to drug administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the 
event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication) and in which other drugs or concurrent or underlying disease provide plausible explanations (e.g., the subject’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
Not related : The adverse event is completely independent of study drug administration, 
and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by the clinician.  
12.1.2.4. Duration 
For all adverse events whether or not considered serious, the Investigator will provide a 
record of the start and stop dates of the event. Every effort should be made to resolve all adverse events with continued follow-up with the subject until appropriate resolution can be achieved. If an event is unresolved at the end of the study it will be recorded as ongoing. 
 
12.1.2.5. Action  Taken  
The Investigator will record the action taken with investigational product as a result of an adverse event or serious adverse event  on the eCRF, as applicable (e.g., discontinuation, or 
interruption of investigational product, as appropriate) and record if concomitant and/or additional treatments were given for the event.  
 
12.1.2.6. Outcome  
The Investigator will record the outcome of adverse events on the eCRF, as applicable (e.g., recovered, recovered with sequelae, not recovered, or death (due to the adverse event).  
 
12.1.3. Follow- Up 
Adverse events assessed as not related to study drug, including clinically significant laboratory tests, electrocardio grams, or physical examination findings, must be followed until 
the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained, or the final study visit occurs, whichever comes first. 
Adverse events assessed as related to study drug and ser ious adverse events will be followed 
for as long as necessary to adequately evaluate the subject’s safety, or until the event stabilizes, is otherwise explained, death occurs, or the subject is lost to follow up. If resolved, a resolution date should be provided. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring

that follow -up includes any supplemental investigations indicated to elucidate the nature 
and/or causality of the adverse event. This may include additional clinical laboratory testing 
or investigations, examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals as is practical.  
 
12.1.4. Pregnancy  
The Sponsor must be informed within 24 hours upon learning that a subject, or male subject’s partner, has become pregnant any time after the first dose of study drug until 30 days after the last dose of study drug. The Pregnancy Notification eCRF should be used to report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or its designee. Subject pregnancies (or pregnancy of a male subject’s partner) must be followed until termination of pregnancy or the birth of the 
child. The Pregnancy Outcome eCRF should be used to report information regarding the 
status of the infant. 
If a female partner of a male subject taking investigational product becomes pregnant, the 
male subject taking the investigational product should notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female partner should be advised to call her healthcare provider immediately. 
 
12.1.5. Recording Adverse  Events  
All adverse events (regardless of seriousness or relationship to study drug) including those from the time informed consent is obtained through to the final study visit are to be recorded in the eCRF. Each individual adverse event is to be listed as a separate entry. The Investigator will provide information about dates of onset and resolution, seriousness, severity, action(s) taken, outcome, and relationship to the study drug. All adverse events should be documented in the subject’s source documents. 
 
12.1.6. Reporting Adverse Events  
The Investigator must report to Sponsor or its designee all adverse events that occur during 
the study from the time written informed consent is given until the final study visit or early termination, regardless of their relationship to the study drug. Serious adverse events and pregnancies will be reported from the time written informed consent is given through 30 days 
beyond the last dose of study drug. 
12.1.6.1. Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
The Investigator is required to notify the Sponsor, and the Sponsor’s designated Drug Safety Unit within 24 hours after becoming aware of the occurrence of a serious adverse event. All 
serious adverse events will be reported through completion of the adver se event eCRF. The 
Investigator will be responsible for reporting serious adverse events to the IRB.

13. STATISTICAL  METHODS 
13.1. Sample Size  Rationale  
There are no studies in the literature to provide reliable estimates of active treatment or 
placebo response rates for this study. Assuming a 10% drop-out/protocol violation rate, 
approximately 115 subjects will be enrolled in the double-blind part of the study to provide 
approximately 35 evaluable subjects per treatment arm. Enrollment may be stopped after 105 evaluable subjects have completed the study. 
Approximately 30% of the overall study population randomized in the study may be subjects 
being treated with chronic daily benzodiazepines as part of their epilepsy management. Since the effect of concomitant chronic daily benzodiazepines use on study treatment is unknown, a 50% response rate for chronic benzodiazepines users on active treatment arms is assumed. 
For subjects who are not chronic benzodiazepines users, a response rate of 60% for active 
treatment arms is assumed. With up to 30% of study population being chronic benzodiazepines users and these response assumptions, a 57% response for the active treatment arm is targeted.  
Power calculations assume a 2 -sided test and significance level of 0.05 with 90% power and 
are based on the assumption that the proportion of responders with STAP-001 is 57% (best 
active treatment arm) whereas the assumed placebo responder rate is 20%.  
 
13.2. Endpoints  
13.2.1. Efficacy  
Primary efficacy endpoint:  
The proportion of responders in each treatment group achieving seizure activity c essation 
within 2 minutes after the administration of the study drug and no recurrence of seizure activity within 2 hours. 
 
Secondary endpoints: 
• Seizure episode severity assessed by subject and/or Staff  Caregiver  
• Use of rescue  medication  
• Secondary generalization (evolution to a complex partial seizure and/or a generalized 
tonic-clonic seizure)  
Exploratory endpoints: 
• Number of seizures during the 4, 6 and 12 hour time periods after study drug 
administration  
• Time to next seizure event with start time >2 minutes after study drug  administration

Additional exploratory statistical analyses to further assess for treatment effect will be 
outlined in the Statistical Analysis Plan finalized prior to database lock for the Primary Efficacy Analysis.  
 
13.2.2. Pharmacokinetic  
Blood samples will be collected for plasma alprazolam concentration measurement pre -dose 
and then at 10, 30, and 60 minutes, and 2 and 6 hours after the dosing of the study drug. 
 
13.2.3. Safety  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by evaluating adverse events, vital signs, concomitant medications, clinical laboratory, and electrocardiogram results, as well as physical examinations. Sedation will also be assessed using a subject VAS. 
 
13.3. Analysis  Populations 
13.3.1. Treatment Period  
The Efficacy Population (ITT population) will include all subjects who have a seizure event 
and receive study drug during the Treatment Period. Modified Intent to Treat (mITT) population will consist of all subjects who have a seizure event, receive study drug, and have 
had at least one evaluation after study drug administration. mITT will be used for primary efficacy analysis.  
The PK Population will include all subjects who receive study drug and have at least one pharmacokinetic data point during the Treatment Period. Subjects who receive placebo will be excluded from the PK Population. 
The Safety Population will include all subjects who receive study drug during the Treatment 
Period from both Part 1 Open- label Feasibility an d Part 2 Double-blind. 
The Per Protocol Population will include all subjects in the Efficacy Population who were dosed according to protocol and have no major protocol deviations. 
13.4. Analyses 
For the Treatment Period, data will be summarized by active treatme nt by dose level versus 
placebo -treated subjects (i.e., by treatment group). All data for analysis will be listed by 
subject.  
Continuous measures will be summarized descriptively (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum value, and maximum value) and categorical measures will be presented as number and percentage.  
Additional details for statistical methods will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
 
13.4.1. Disposition and Baseline Characteristics  
Disposition will be summarized by randomized treatment group. The number and percentage 
of subjects, who are randomized, treated, prematurely discontinued, and complete the study will b e summarized.

55 V 7.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 775 of 8417   
  
Baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group.  
The number of subjects in each cohort’s treatment group will be summarized for each 
investigative site for the Treatment Period. Medical history will be coded using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. Concomitant medications will be summarized by World Health Organization Drug Dictionary Anatomical -Therapeutic- 
Chemical (WHODRUG_ATC) classification and preferred term.  
13.4.2. Efficacy  
All statistical tests will be 2 -sided with a significance level of 0.05. Testing will be 
performe d only for the Treatment Period. 
Data will be summarized by active treatment by dose level versus placebo -treated subjects 
(i.e., by treatment group). Continuous measures will be summarized descriptively (mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum value, and maximum value) and categorical measures will be presented as number and percentage. 
The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted following completion of the Treatment 
Period for the last subject and data base lock. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of responders in each treatment group 
achieving seizure activity cessation within 2 minutes after the administration of the study drug and no recurrence of seizure activity within 2 hours. The primary endpoint will be analyzed with a chi -squared test. The overall treatment comparison, as well as pairwise 
comparisons between each dose level and placebo will be performed. The estimates of the treatment difference versus placebo and their 95% confidence inte rval will be presented.  
There will be no adjustment for multiple treatment group comparisons in this dose- ranging 
Phase 2b study. The dose-response relationship will be explored with a regression analysis. 
The handling of missing data will be summarized in  the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
Secondary and Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints Secondary and exploratory endpoints will be summarized by treatment group and if 
applicable, by assessment time point. Exploratory statistical testing may be performed if warranted. The Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test for row mean score difference will be 
used to test the treatment difference in the seizure episode severity. The Kruskal -Wallis test 
will be used to compare seizure frequencies. The time- to-next-seizure data will b e 
summarized and displayed with Kaplan- Meier plots. No multiplicity adjustment will be 
implemented for exploratory tests.  
 
13.4.3. Pharmacokinetics  
The collection status of PK samples will be listed for each visit with scheduled pharmacokinetic sampling. Plasma co ncentrations of study drug and the active metabolites 
may be summarized separately, as appropriate. PK parameters including maximum 
concentration (C
max), time to maximum (T max), area under the concentration curve from 0 to 
the last measurable value (AUC last) will be estimated for each subject using

noncompartmental methods. Since the time point range is 0 to 6 hours and the alprazolam 
half-life is 11 hours, we do not plan to estimate half- life or AUC inf. 
 
13.4.4. Safety  
All safety summaries will be descriptive with no statistical hypothesis testing and based  on 
the Safety Population. Subjects will be summarized according to the study drug received 
(i.e., as treated), should it differ from the randomized treatment arm. All safety endpoints will be listed in by -subject data listings.  
Adverse events will be coded using MedDRA and summarized by system organ class and 
preferred term. Clinically significant deteriorations in physical examination findings will be reported and summarized as adverse events.  
Laboratory values will be converted to the project-defined unit of measurement, as applicable, before analysis. Abnormal, clinically significant laboratory values will be reported and summarized as adverse events.  
Adverse Events  
An adverse event reported after informed consent and occurring before the first dose of study drug in the CRU/EMU will be considered a pre- treatment adverse event. Treatment - 
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be defined as any adverse event that occurs after administration of study drug. The number and percentage of subjects who report TEA Es will 
be summarized by system organ class and preferred term.  
Treatment emergent adverse events will also be summarized by intensity as well as 
relationship to study drug. 
Subjects who report the same preferred term on multiple occasions will be counted once for 
the preferred term: under the highest severity when summarized by severity and under the closest relationship to study drug when summarized by relationship. If a subject reports multiple preferred terms for a system organ class, the subject will b e counted only once for 
that system organ class.  
Proportions for adverse events that are gender-specific (e.g., dysmenorrhea) will be based on 
the number of subjects from that gender. 
The number and percentage of subjects who experience TEAEs will be summarized by 
treatment group for the following: 
• By system organ class and preferred  term 
• By severity/intensity, system organ class, and preferred  term 
• By relationship to study drug, system organ class, and preferred term 
• Serious adverse events by system organ class and preferred  term 
• Serious adverse events by relationship to study drug, system organ class, and 
preferred  term  
• Adverse events resulting in discontinuation of study drug by system organ class 
and preferred  term

 • Adverse events that result in study drug dose interruption by system organ class 
and preferred  term  
By subject listings will be provided for any deaths, serious adverse events, and adverse 
events leading to discontinuation of treatment. 
 
Sedation Assessment  
Sedation as measured by the dichotomous using a 100- mm linear VAS will be summarized 
by time point.  
Clinical Laboratory 
Clinical laboratory variables will be presented in 2 ways. First, change from Baseline to each 
scheduled assessment will be summarized descriptively. Baseline will be defined as the laboratory value obtained before the first dose of study drug on Day 1; if Day 1 values are unavailable, then values obtained at the Screening Visit will be used. 
Second, treatment -emergent  potentially clinically significant (PCS) laboratory values will be 
identified. Potentially clinically significant values are defined as those that meet Grade 3 or 
Grade 4 toxicity criteria from the CTCAE criteria. Treatment- emergent PCS laboratory 
values are those in which the baseline value is not PCS and the post- baseline value is PCS. 
The number and percentage of subjects with treatment- emergent PCS laboratory values will 
be summarized by treatment group for each clinical laboratory variable.  
Vital Sign s 
The mean change from baseline to each scheduled assessment will be summarized 
descriptively by treatment group for each vital sign variable specified in this protocol. 
Baseline will be defined as the last vital sign value obtained before the first dose o f study 
drug on Day 1; if Day 1 values are unavailable, then values obtained at the Screening Visit 
will be used. 
Electrocardiogram  
The change from baseline in electrocardiogram intervals (PR, QT, QTcF, QRS, and RR) to 
each scheduled assessment will be summarized descriptively by treatment group.

documentation of this study are designed to ensure that the Sponsor, its authorized representative, and Investigator abide by GCP, as described in ICH Guideline E6 and in accordance with the general ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study will receive approval from the IRB/EC prior to commencement. The Investigator will conduct all aspects of this study in accordance with applicable national, state, and local laws 
of the pertinent regulatory authorities.  
 
14.2. Sponsor’s Responsibilities  
The Sponsor or its designee is responsible for the following: 
• Selecting qualified  Investigators 
• Providing Investigators with the information they need to properly conduct an 
investigation  
• Ensuring proper monitoring of the investigation  
• Ensuring that the applicable regulatory authorities, and all participating 
Investigators are properly informed of significant new information regarding 
adverse events or risks associated with the medication being  studied 
Before an investigational site can enter a subject into the study, a representative of the 
Sponsor will visit the investigational study site to: 
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the Investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard 
to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of the Sponsor or its representatives. 
This will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between the Sponsor and the Investigator. 
During the study, a monitor from Engage Therapeutics, Inc. or its representative will have regular contacts with the investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the Investigator(s)  
• Confirm that facilities remain  acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that investigational product 
accountability checks are being  performed

 • Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the case 
report forms with the subject’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other 
records relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original recor ds for 
each subject (e.g., clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations. 
• Confirm adverse events and serious adverse events have been properly documented 
on eCRFs and confirm any serious adverse events have been forwarded to the Sponsor and those serious adverse events that met criteria for reporting have been forwarded to the IRB/EC and other applicable country and/or local regulatory authorities.  
The monitor will be available between visits if the Investigator(s) or other staff needs information or advice. 
As the Sponsor, Engage Therapeutics, Inc. has delegated some responsibilities to a designee, 
or Contract Research Organization.  
 
14.3. Investigator’s Responsibilities  
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH Guideline for GCP and in the local 
regulations. Each Investigator participating in this study is required to maintain complete and accurate study documentation in compliance with current GCP standards and all applicable local regulations related to the conduct of a clinical study.  
The Principal Investigator will ensure that all persons assisting with the study are adequately 
informed about the protocol, any amendments to the protocol, the study drug, and their 
study- related duties and functions. The Principal Investigator will maintain a list of sub - 
Investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom he or she has delegated significant study -related duties. Individuals ineligible from conducting or working on 
clinical studies, including those ineligible as a result of deb arment under the Generic Drug 
Enforcement Act of 1992, will not be allowed to conduct or work on studies sponsored by Engage Therapeutics, Inc. The Investigator is required to immediately disclose to the Sponsor in writing, if any person involved in the conduct of the study is debarred pursuant to a hearing by the FDA under this anti -fraud law, or if any proceeding for debarment is 
pending, or is (to the best of the Investigator’s knowledge) threatened.  
The Investigator is responsible for keeping a record of all subjects who sign an informed 
consent document and are screened for entry into the study. Subjects who fail screening 
must have the reason(s) recorded in the subject’s source documents. 
The Invest igator should inform the IRB/EC of any event likely to affect the safety of subjects 
or the continued conduct of the study. Additionally, all updates to the Investigator’s 
Brochure will be sent to the IRB/EC. A progress report will be sent to the IRB/EC and the protocol will be reviewed annually (e.g., re-approved) or more frequently, as required by the IRB/EC or local  regulations. 
The Investigator will maintain a copy of all correspondence with the IRB/EC, including 
copies of approved documents. The Invest igator will also maintain a copy of the IRB/EC

membership list with occupation and qualification (or a statement confirming compliance 
with GCP requirements for committee composition).  
The Investigator will notify the IRB/EC of the conclusion of the clinical study within 1 month of completion or termination of the study. The final report sent to the IRB/EC will also be sent to the Sponsor along with the completed electronic case report forms (eCRFs) and all necessary regulatory documents, thereby fulfilling the Investigator’s regulatory 
responsibility. 
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to subject records 
(e.g., medical records, office charts, hospital charts, and study- related charts) for source data 
verification. The Investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of eCRFs and 
queries.  
14.4. Protocol  Amendments  
Any permanent change to the protocol, whether it is an overall change or a change for 
specific study center(s ), must be handled as a protocol amendment. All amendments to the 
protocol will be written by the Sponsor. The Investigator will not make any changes to this protocol without prior written consent from the Sponsor and subsequent approval by the IRB/EC. Exc ept for administrative amendments, Investigators must await IRB/EC approval 
of protocol amendments before implementing the change(s). The Sponsor will ensure submission of any protocol amendments to the appropriate regulatory agencies. 
Administrative amendments are defined as having no effect on the safety of the research 
subjects, scope of the investigation, or quality of the study. However, a protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to subjects should be imple mented 
immediately, and the IRB/EC notified within 5 days.  
When, in the judgment of the chairman of the local IRB/EC, the Investigators, and/or the Sponsor, the amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design and/or increases the potential risk to the subject, the currently approved written ICF will require similar modification. In such cases, repeat informed consent will be obtained from subjects enrolled in the study before continued participation under the new amendment. 
14.5. Audits and  Inspec tions  
The Sponsor’s Quality Assurance Unit (or representative) may conduct audits at the study site(s). Audits will include, but are not limited to: drug supply, presence of required documents, the informed consent process, laboratory specimen processing, and comparison of eCRFs with source documents. The Investigator agrees to cooperate with audits conducted at a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner.  
Regulatory authorities worldwide may also audit the Investigator during or after the study. 
The Inves tigator should contact the Sponsor immediately if this occurs, and must fully 
cooperate with the audits conducted at a reasonable time in a reasonable manner.

The Investigator is required to make all study documentation promptly available for 
inspection, review or audit at the study site upon request by Sponsor, its representatives, or any appropriate regulatory agencies.  
 
14.6. Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
All aspects of the study will be carefully monitored by the Sponsor or its authorized representative for compliance with applicable government regulations with respect to current GCP and standard operating procedures. 
A quality control and quality assurance plan addressing aspects of the study that may impact 
data integrity or the protection of human subjects may be instituted for this study. All audit 
findings will be summarized and placed on file with appropriate documentation of response/resolution.

15. DATA HANDLING AND RECORDKEEPING  
15.1. Confidentiality  
All information disclosed or provided by the Sponsor (or designee), or generated or produced 
during the study including, but not limited to, the protocol, the eCRFs, the Investigator’s 
Brochure, and the results obtained during the course of the study, are confidential. The 
Investigator or any person under his/her authority agrees to keep confidential and not to disclose the information to any third party without the prior written approval of the Sponsor. 
Submission of this protocol and any other necessary documentation to the IRB is expressly 
permitted, IRB/EC members having the same obligation of confidentiality. Authorized regulatory officials and sponsor personnel (or designee) will be allowed full access to inspect and copy the records. The copied and inspected records will remain at the site and will not be transmitted or removed from the site. Study drug, subject bodily fluids, and/or other materials collected shall be used solely in accordance with this protocol, unless otherwise 
agreed  to in writing by the Sponsor and responsible ethics committee(s) or regulatory 
authorities.  
Subjects’ names may, however, be made known to a regulatory agency or other authorized 
officials in the event of inspections. Documents containing the full name or other personally identifiable information of the subject are to remain at the site. This information will not be transferred to the Sponsor nor be contained in regulatory filings. 
15.2. Subject Data  Protection  
Prior to any testing under this protocol, including screening tests and assessments, candidates must also provide all authorizations required by local law (e.g., protected health information authorization). 
Subjects will be identified only by unique subject numbers in eCRFs and other datasets 
generated for this study. The subject will not be identified by name in the eCRF, in any study samples or study reports. All data generated in this study is for research purposes only. The Sponsor, its partner(s) and designee(s), and various government health agencies may inspect the records of this study. Every effort will be made to keep the subject’s personal medical data confidential. 
The Sponsor will protect individual subject information to the fullest extent possible during 
this study. At no time will a subject become identified in any publication or presentation. However, the subject may have to become identified in the event of a regulatory authority audit or inspection in order to verify the accuracy of the data. Access to subject information is at the discretion of the Sponsor and cannot occur prior to database lock or other specified events as determined solely by the discretion of the Sponsor. 
15.3. Data  Collection  
All data obtained for analysis in the clinical study described in this protocol will use an electronic data capture system. Data reported in the eCRFs should be consistent with and  
Staccato Alprazolam (STAP -001) 
Protocol ENGAGE -E-001 01 February  2019

Page 783 of 8417   
  
substantiated by the subject’s medical record and original source documents. Any 
discrepancies must be explained.  
Prior to the start of the study, the Principal Investigator will complete a Delegation of 
Authority form (Site Signature and Delegation Log), showing the signatures and handwritten initials of all individuals and the delegation of responsibilities, such as identifying those individuals who are authorized to make or change entries on eCRFs. 
 
15.4. Case Report Form  Completion  
Data within the eCRF will be monitored by a Clinical Research Associate according to the Monitoring Plan. Queries will be generated based on discrepancies found while monitoring. Site personnel will review and respond to these queries appropriately. Additionally, the Sponsor’s designee and the Sponsor may periodically perform aggregate data reviews, which could result in queries being generated for site personnel resolution. The completed eCRF for each subject must be signed and dated by the Principal Investigator to signify that the Principal Investigator has reviewed the eCRF and certifies it to be complete and  accurate.  
 
15.5. Database Management, Data Clarification, and Quality 
Assurance  
The Sponsor’s designee (i.e., a designated Contract Research Organization) will be 
responsible for data management. Data Management will develop a Data Management Plan 
(DMP) document, and provide it to the Sponsor for approval. The DMP document will 
define all activities in the data collection and cleaning process. The detailed DMP will be based on the protocol, work scope, contract, analysis plans, data- flows, eCRFs, data cleaning 
procedures, other supporting documents, and data management standards and pr actices.  
The programmed data validations will be run to check for database completeness and 
consistency, and queries will be generated upon data entry or via review by a Clinical Data 
Manager after entry. The sites will respond to the data queries in a timely manner.  
Quality control procedures will be conducted prior to database lock according to the 
designated Contract Research Organization standard operating procedures. 
When the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked. An y 
changes to the database after that time will only be made by joint written agreement between 
the Sponsor, Statistician, Data Manager, and Quality Assurance Auditor according to designated standard operating procedures of the Contract Research Organizatio n. 
 
15.6. Inspection of  Records  
According to the ICH guidelines for GCP, the Sponsor or designee must verify data entered 
in the eCRF entries against the source documents. The objective of source document 
verification is to comply with GCP and international regu latory requirements and to reduce 
the risks of fraud. Source document verification means ensuring that source documents are an accurate and confirmable reflection of the subject’s evaluations during participation in the study and that all relevant information recorded in the source document is accurately entered

into the eCRF. All source documents should be correctly labeled and filed and associated 
with a single, verifiable subject.  
All data required for this study should be captured in source notes. No data obtained by the 
Investigator or other study personnel should be captured directly in the eCRF. All source documents pertaining to this study will be maintained by the Investigator and made available for inspection by authorized persons. If electronic progress notes and other electronic source documents are not compliant with applicable regulatory guidance, they are not considered a valid source for this study. All subject progress notes must be dated and signed at the time of the visit. The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study for refusal of the Investigator 
to supply original source documentation for this clinical study. 
The Investigator will note in a source independent from the eCRF the following information: 
• Information to confirm that the subject exists (e.g., initials, date of birth, and sex);  
• Confirmation that the subject satisfies the inclusion/exclusion  criteria;  
• Confirmation that the subject is taking part in the clinical study;  
• Confirmation of the informed consent process; 
• Visit dates and documentation of protocol assessments and procedure s; 
• Information concerning all adverse events;  
• Details of concomitant and investigational medications.  
Source document verification is not a substitute for clinical study monitoring, the purpose of 
which is to ensure that the protocol has been followed cor rectly, the eCRF has been fully and 
accurately completed, source document verification has been carried out, and the study timelines and enrollment goals and requirements have been met.  
 
15.7. Retention of  Records  
For investigational drug studies, clinical Investigators must retain study records for a period of 2 years following the date a marketing application is approved for the drug for the 
indication for which it is being investigated; or, if no application is to be filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until two years after the investigation is discontinued and FDA is notified. 
The Investigator must maintain all study documentation as confidential, and take measures to 
prevent accident al or premature destruction of these documents. 
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor prior to destroying any study essential documents. 
If the Investigator can no longer ensure archiving, he/she shall inform the Sponsor. The 
relevant records shall be t ransferred to a mutually agreed upon designee.

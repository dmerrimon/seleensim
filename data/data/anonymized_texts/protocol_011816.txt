 1. STUDY  SUMMARY  
 
Protocol  Title  A randomized,  double -blind,  placebo -controlled  study  of ALPN -101 in 
systemic lupus erythematosus  
Protocol  Number  AIS-A03 
Investigational  Phase  2 
Investigational  Product  ALPN -101 Injection  
Study  Sites  Approximately  75 international  sites 
Sample  Size At least 130 subjects  
Study  Duration  Each  subject  will participate  for up to 34 weeks,  including  a Screening 
period of up to 6 weeks, a 24 -week Treatment period, and a 4 -week 
Follow -up period.  
Study  Population  Adults  18 to 70 years  of age, inclusive,  with active  systemic  lupus 
erythematosus (SLE)  
Study  Design  This is a Phase 2, multinational, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled,  parallel  group  study  to evaluate  the safety,  tolerability, 
efficacy,  immunogenicity,  pharmacokinetics  (PK),  
 of ALPN -101 in adults with moderate to severe active SLE.  
After signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF), subjects will be evaluated 
during  a Screening  period  of up to 42 days.  Screening  laboratory  evaluations 
will be performed; assess ment of disease activity will be performed by the 
Investigator and reviewed by the Sponsor or designee to confirm eligibility.  
Subjects will return to the clinic on Day 1 and undergo Baseline procedures, 
including assessment and confirmation of disease act ivity by the 
Investigator. Subjects who continue to meet eligibility criteria will be 
randomized  1:1 to receive  blinded  study  drug once  every  2 weeks  (Q2W)  for 
a total of 12 doses of:  
(1) 3 mg/kg  ALPN -101 or 
(2) Placebo  
Baseline medications that are used for the treatment of SLE (i.e., 
hydroxychloroquine/hydroxychloroquine -like drugs, corticosteroids, 
immunosuppressants)  must  be maintained  at stable  doses  through  the 
Day 169 assessments, except for incidences of toxicity, for a  
protocol -permitted short -term increase (burst and taper) of corticosteroid 
dose in response to increased disease activity, or discretionary reduction in 
corticosteroids  (taper)  after Day 85 in the context  of improvement  in disease 
activity.  
Assessments  of safety,  efficacy,  PK, anti-drug antibodies  (ADA),  and 
 will be performed throughout the study. Refer to the 
Schedule of Procedures and Assessments ( Table 1 ). 
Cumulative  safety  data will be reviewed  at intervals  by the Data  Monitoring 
Committee (DMC), which will provide recommendations regarding study 
conduct, if indicated.

characterize the PK of ALPN -101 in SLE subjects.  
Immunogenicity 
Endpoints and 
Assessments  The presence and titer of ADA against ALPN -101 will be assessed at 
Baseline (prior to study drug administration on Day 1) and at intervals 
throughout the study. Samples confirmed positive for ADA may be explored 
for neutralizing capacity. The relationship between ADA and PK will be 
analyzed;  relationship  between  ADA  and clinical  outcomes  may be explored.  
Statistical 
Considerations  Randomization : Subjects will be randomized 1:1; randomization will be 
stratified  by background immunosuppressive  therapy  and geographic  region. 
Subjects  who are randomized  but do  not receive  study  drug may be replaced.

 Sample Size : A sample size of app roximately 130 (~65 subjects/arm) will 
provide  approximately  83–88% power  (chi square  two-sided  test, alpha  0.05) 
to detect an absolute increase of 25% compared to placebo in the proportion 
of responders (e.g., as assessed by SRI -4 at Day 169) in the activ e treatment 
group, assuming a placebo response rate of 20 –40%.  
Statistical  Methods:  
All safety data will be summarized descriptively by treatment group and 
analyzed  based  on the safety  population.  Categorical  safety  endpoints  will be 
summarized using incidence  rates. The  mean change  from baseline, standard 
deviation, minimum, and maximum will be used to summarize continuous 
safety endpoints. No statistical inference is planned for the analysis of safety 
endpoints.  
All efficacy endpo ints will be summarized and analyzed for the modified 
Intent -to-Treat population. For categorical endpoints, the number and 
proportion  of subjects  in each category  will be presented  by treatment  group. 
Proportions of subjects achieving response will be com pared using a 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted for randomization stratification 
factors. An estimate of the difference in proportions and corresponding 95% 
confidence interval. P -value will be presented for efficacy endpoints of 
primary interest. For continuous endpoints, the mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, and maximum will be presented by treatment group. For 
continuous endpoints with multiple post -Baseline visits, the treatment effect 
will be assessed through Mixed -effect Model Repeated Me asures (MMRM) 
based on observed data. Difference in least -squares means will be derived 
using an analysis of covariance model controlling for stratification factors 
and baseline scores. For each treatment comparison, an estimate of the 
difference in least -squares means, and corresponding 95% confidence 
interval will be presented.

2. BACKGROUND  
2.1. Systemic  Lupus  Erythematosus  
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that affects 0.01% to 0.2% of people 
worldwide, and is characterized by failures of immune self -tolerance, with the generation of pathogenic 
subsets  of lymphocytes  and autoantibodies  that disrupt  the function  of cells and homeostatic  systems  and 
mediate tissue injury in multiple organs. Etiology remains incompletely defined; there is evidence that 
genetic, epigenetic, environmental, immunologic, and hormonal factors may contribute to disease 
suscep tibility and severity ( 1-5). 
Clinically,  lupus  is characterized  by periods  of remission  and relapse  of constitutional  and organ -specific 
signs and symptoms that are highly variable across populations and can change over time in individual 
patients. The mos t common clinical features include fever, debilitating fatigue, joint inflammation, skin 
and mucosal lesions, serositis, hematologic disorders including anemia, leukopenia or  
thrombocytopenia, and lupus nephritis. The latter is the most common life - and or gan-threatening 
manifestation of SLE, estimated to impact 40% to 70% of patients, with progression to renal failure in 
10% to 20% ( 6, 7). Less common but serious SLE manifestations include neuropsychiatric, 
demyelinating and neurovascular disease, and anti phospholipid antibody syndrome with venous 
thrombosis, arterial occlusion and/or fetal loss. Most other organ systems can also be involved ( 8-17). 
Therapeutic management is tailored to the severity of disease and organ systems involved. Practice 
guidelines  and consensus statements have been developed for treatment of SLE, lupus nephritis, and 
other organ -specific manifestations, and are revised at regular intervals to incorporate emerging data 
(18-20). Current standard of care (SOC) includes antimalarial ag ents for treatment of skin disease to 
reduce  risk of flare in all patients,  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs)  for management  of 
headache and musculoskeletal pain, and corticosteroids for rapid reduction of inflammation and 
management of fatigue . Oral immunosuppressive agents (e.g., methotrexate, azathioprine, 
mycophenolate and others) are used to reduce dependence on corticosteroids and to address more  
persistent  manifestations. Belimumab,  an inhibitor  of B cell growth  factors, has  been approved for  use in 
refractory  SLE and B cell depletion  with rituximab  is indicated  for immune  thrombocytopenia,  including 
that arising in SLE, with benefit reported in other manifestations. High dose corticosteroids and 
cytotoxic agents (e.g., cyclophosph amide) are used for serious manifestations refractory to other agents. 
Initial treatment for clinically significant lupus nephritis comprises corticosteroids together with 
cyclophosphamide, azathioprine or mycophenolate. For lupus nephritis refractory to i nitial therapy, 
selective inhibition of the T cell -mediated immune response through the addition of calcineurin 
inhibitors has demonstrated benefit ( 21). 
Despite  earlier  diagnosis  and improved  treatment  regimens,  more  than 60% of patients  with access  to 
current  best standards  of medical  care develop  clinically -detectable  organ  damage  within  2 to 7 years  
(22). A recent meta -analysis involving over 27,000 patients with SLE reported a 3 -fold increase in the 
risk of death compared with the general population, primarily due to cardiovascular disease ( 23). 
Toxicity associated with corticosteroids and immunosuppres sion contributes substantially to the burden 
of disease: corticosteroid use is associated with loss of bone integrity and development of metabolic 
syndrome, contributing to cardiovascular disease; broad spectrum immunosuppressants increase the risk 
of serious infection  and neoplasm,  and use of calcineurin  inhibitors  is limited  by nephrotoxicity.  There  is 
a continuing need to develop pharmacologic interventions that more specifically target pathogenic 
pathways, with the goal of improving efficacy while limit ing toxicity.

2.2. CD28  and ICOS  Inflammatory  Pathways  in Murine  and Human  Lupus  
Both  the cluster  of differentiation  (CD)  28-B7 and inducible  T cell co-stimulator  (ICOS)  ligand  
(ICOS -L) co-stimulatory pathways have  been implicated in the  pathogenesis of  both murine  and human 
lupus.  Numerous  studies  demonstrated  that therapeutic  inhibition  of CD28,  CD80,  and/or  CD86  reduces 
disease activity in animal models of lupus ( 24-37). In humans, polymorphisms in CD28 may confer 
susceptibility to at l east some subsets of SLE ( 38); circulating levels of CD28, CD80, and/or CD86 are 
associated with disease  activity and/or  severity ( 39-41); and in SLE, T  cells may exhibit an exaggerated 
response to CD28 signaling ( 38). However, therapeutic intervention on the CD28 -B7 pathway with 
abatacept (Cytotoxic T -Lymphocyte -Associated Antigen 4 -immunoglobulin [Ig]) or antibodies against 
CD28 have shown promising, but not statistically significant, efficacy in human SLE or lupus nephritis 
(42-44), suggesting that addit ional pathogenic pathways compensate during CD28 -B7 inhibition.  
Indeed,  CD28 -low or -negative  T cells,  which  presumably  function  independently  of CD28  
co-stimulation,  are observed  in SLE,  often  correlating  with disease  activity  and/or  severity  (45-50). 
The ICOS/ICOS -L costimulatory  system  is a candidate  for a pathway  that may account  for bypass  of, or 
resistance to, CD28 -B7 inhibition. ICOS is highly homologous to CD28, but in contrast to CD28 the 
expression of ICOS is rapidly increased during T cell activa tion. It may therefore provide 
complementary and/or compensatory costimulatory signals in activated and/or effector T cells, which 
may otherwise be less dependent on CD28 signaling ( 51). Similar to CD28 -B7, numerous preclinical 
studies have demonstrated th at therapeutic inhibition of and/or deficiency in ICOS or ICOS -L reduces 
disease activity in animal models of lupus ( 28, 49, 52-59). Polymorphisms in ICOS may also confer 
susceptibility to at least some subsets of SLE ( 60); and there is similarly a correla tion between 
expression of ICOS or ICOS -L and disease activity and/or severity, especially in association with 
follicular  helper  T cells which  characteristically  express ICOS  (30, 44, 61-68), and in association  with a 
subset of T peripheral helper cells that is expanded in active lupus nephritis and expresses ICOS and  
PD-1 (69). However, also similar to CD28 pathway inhibition, blockade of the ICOS/ICOS -L pathway 
alone  appears  also to be insufficient  for the treatment  of SLE,  at least as suggested  by early  studies  with 
prezalumab (AMG -557), an anti -ICOS -L monoclonal antibody ( 61, 70). 
Combined  inhibition  of both CD28  and ICOS  pathways  may therefore  be required  to achieve  clinically 
meaningful outcomes in SLE. In precli nical studies, combined blockade is associated with superior 
inhibition of T and B cell activation, as well as reduced disease in multiple animal models of systemic 
autoimmunity including models with features of lupus, arthritis, and Sjögren’s syndrome ( 71, 72) 
(Alpine Immune Sciences, data on file). Novel therapeutics that concomitantly antagonize both the 
CD28 and ICOS pathways may prove  beneficial in SLE  by addressing two dominant, non -overlapping 
T cell costimulatory pathways, and may be superior to exi sting therapeutics.  
2.3. Investigational  Agent  
ALPN -101 (acazicolcept; ICOS -L vIgD -Fc) is an Fc fusion protein of a human ICOS -L variant Ig 
domain (vIgD™) designed to inhibit simultaneously the CD28 and ICOS inflammation pathways.  It is 
currently  being  evaluated  for the treatment  of alloimmune,  autoimmune  and/or  inflammatory  conditions 
that may be dependent on CD28 and/or ICOS pathways.  
This is the first study to evaluate ALPN -101 in subjects with active SLE. A previous first -in-human 
(FIH) study evaluat ed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),  of 
single and repeat doses ALPN -101 in healthy volunteers ( 76). In this FIH study, ALPN -101 was 
generally  well-tolerated  with no evidence  of cytokine  release,  clinically  signific ant immunogenicity,  or 
severe adverse events (AEs) following subcutaneous (SC) doses up to 3 mg/kg or single intravenous  
(IV) doses  up to 10  mg/kg  or up to  4 weekly  IV doses  of up to  1 mg/kg.  An open  label  study of

ALPN -101 in subjects with steroid -resistant or steroid -refractory acute graft -versus -host disease 
(GVHD)  (AIS -A02, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  enrolled  a single  subject  prior  to discontinuation  of the study  due to 
a change in corporate strategy.  As reported in a case stu dy, the patient received ALPN -101 for  
treatment of severe (Grade 3) disease of the lower gastrointestinal tract. An IV infusion at 0.3 mg/kg  
was well-tolerated  and sustained  high level  target  saturation  of circulating  T cells for at least 7 days (77). 
Stool volume declined within 2 days, permitting steroid taper, and by study Day 8 acute GVHD had 
resolved to Grade 0. The course suggested that GVHD responded quickly to a single low dose of  
ALPN -101. 
2.4. Nonclinical  Data  
ALPN -101 demonstrates  high affinity  binding  to human  and cynomolgus  monkey  CD28  and ICOS,  with 
lower affinity binding to rodent orthologs. Nonclinical studies demonstrate potent inhibition of T cell 
activation and suppression of disease activity in mouse models of GVHD, inflammatory  
arthriti s, sialadenitis  (Sjögren’s  syndrome),  SLE,  and other  models  of autoimmune  and inflammatory 
diseases.  
Rats and cynomolgus monkeys were utilized for nonclinical safety assessment of ALPN -101. The 
program includes a 1 -month SC and IV repeat dose toxicology st udy in rats and cynomolgus monkey, a 
3-month SC and IV repeat dose study in cynomolgus monkey, and a 6 -month IV repeat dose study in 
cynomolgus  monkeys.  ALPN -101 was well tolerated;  the no-observed -adverse -effect  level  (NOAEL)  in 
the 1 -month toxicology stu dies for both rat and cynomolgus monkey was the highest dose evaluated in 
each species  via SC and IV administration:  200 mg/kg/week  in rats and 150 mg/kg/week  in cynomolgus 
monkeys. The NOAEL for ALPN -101 in both the 3 -month and 6 -month toxicology studies in 
cynomolgus monkey was the  highest dose  evaluated via  SC and/or IV  administration: 150 mg/kg/week.  
2.5. Clinical  Studies  
Results  of clinical  studies  are summarized  below;  please  refer  to the Investigator’s  Brochure  (IB) for 
detailed and updated information.  
AIS-A01: An FIH study (Study AIS -A01, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) was conducted to assess the safety, 
tolerability,  PK, and PD of single  and repeated  doses  of ALPN -101 (N=66)  or placebo  (N=30)  in adult 
healthy volunteers. Overall, ALPN -101 was safe and well tolerated at single ascending IV (0.001 – 
10.0-mg/kg)  or SC (1.0 mg/kg or  3.0 mg/kg)  doses, as well as at multiple  IV doses either  once  weekly 
(0.3 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg weekly) or once every 2 weeks (Q2W) (1.0 mg/kg fortnightly) for 4 weeks.  
There were no severe (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] Grade 3 or greater) 
AEs, no treatment -related serious adverse events (SAEs), and no treatment -related trends in laboratory 
safety  parameters.  The proportions  of subjects  reporting  AEs of infection,  headache,  and aphthous  ulcers 
were higher among subjects randomized to ALPN -101 compared to placebo; most were mild (Grade 1), 
and all resolved without sequelae. There were no infusion -related reactions (IRRs), no treatment -related 
hypersensitivity reactions, and no significant changes from baseline in circulating cytokines.  
Refer  to the IB for details  regarding  PK  results  from  the study  which  are also reported  by Yang 
et al ( 76). 
AIS-A02:  Study  AIS-A02 (NCT  04227938)  was intended  to be a single  ascending  dose study  to assess 
the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ALPN -101 in adults with steroid -resistant or -refractory acute 
GVHD. Due to a change in sponsor strategy, the study was terminated after enrollment of the first 
subject (0.3 mg/kg dose cohort). The enrolled subject had 6th -line steroid -refractory gastrointestinal 
tract acute GVHD. ALPN -101 was administered on study Day 1. No serious or Grade ≥ 3 AEs  

PROTOCOL  AIS-A03 ALPN -101

attributable to ALPN -101 were recorded after dosing. Disease activity in the gastrointestinal tr act resolved 
from Grade 3 to Grade 0 (no clinical activity) by Study Day 8. The subject experienced critical 
thrombocytopenia, intracranial hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, and sepsis on Study Day 11 with fatal 
outcome,  attributed  to pre-existing  thrombot ic microangiopathy  attributed  to tacrolimus  (77). There  were 
no serious or Grade ≥ 3 AEs attributable to ALPN -101; AEs did not prompt early termination of the 
trial. 
2.6. Trial  Rationale  
As outlined in §2.2 and §2.3, the results of preclinical and nonclinical d ata are consistent with the 
hypothesis that by inhibiting immune  activation through CD28 and ICOS, ALPN -101 may attenuate  the 
signs, symptoms, and clinical sequelae associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as 
active  SLE.  As summarized  in §2.4 and §2.5, ALPN -101 has thus far shown  a favorable  safety  profile  at 
doses that achieve and maintain high level target saturation. The data to date support evaluation of 
ALPN -101 in patients with SLE.  
2.7. Benefit -Risk  Statement  
There  has been no prior  clinical  experience  with ALPN -101 in SLE,  so its risk (safety)  and efficacy 
profile in SLE have not been determined. Participants in this study may gain benefit if ALPN -101 
results in improved clinical outcomes (e.g., improvements in disease activity, qual ity of life).  
In healthy  volunteers,  the most  common  AEs in subjects  who received  ALPN -101 included  headache, 
upper respiratory tract infections, and aphthous ulcers. Subjects reporting these AEs should be 
monitored and treated when indicated in accordance with local practice.  
ALPN -101 did not cause cytokine release, and no infusion reactions were observ ed in healthy 
volunteers. Nonetheless, as with any biologic therapeutic administered by IV infusion, all subjects 
should  be monitored  during  and immediately  after dosing  and treated  if indicated  according  to local 
standard practices and guidance provided i n §8.1.1 . 
Based  on its mechanism  of action,  ALPN -101 should  be considered  potentially  immunosuppressive  and 
therefore may potentially reduce immunosurveillance and increase infection risk; all subjects should be 
monitored for infections and treated as indi cated. With respect to the coronavirus (COVID -19) 
pandemic, there has been no experience with ALPN -101 in patients or healthy volunteers who are 
known to have been exposed to SARS -CoV -2 or to have contracted COVID -19; therefore, it is not 
known  whether  subjects receiving  ALPN -101 may be at an increased  risk for COVID -19 infection  or to 
experience serious illness if infected. Management of these AEs will be made on a case -by-case basis 
with consideration of benefit/risk.  
ALPN -101 may attenuate immune respons es to —and production of potentially protective antibodies 
following —immunizations,  including  vaccines  for SARS -CoV -2. Therefore,  prior  to study  participation, 
subjects should be up to date on all age -appropriate vaccinations, including COVID -19, per local and 
professional guidelines for immunocompromised individuals (e.g., Centers for Disease Control [CDC], 
local professional society guidelines). Live vaccines should not be administered while receiving  
ALPN -101. Refer  also to §8.3. 
Given  the significant  continued  morbidity  and mortality  seen in patients  with SLE despite  treatment  with 
current SOC therapies, evaluation of ALPN -101 in this population  is appropriate.

4. TRIAL  DESIGN  
4.1. Overview  of Study  Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -arm study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, efficacy, immunogenicity, PK,  of ALPN -101 in adult subjects with chronic, 
moderate to severe active SLE. Approximately 75 international sites will participate in this study. A  
total of approximately  130 subjects  will be randomized  1:1 to receive  a weight -based  dose of ALPN -101 
or placebo Q2W for a total of 12 doses:  
 ALPN -101 at 3 mg/kg  (n≈65)  
 Placebo  (n≈65)  
Randomization  will be stratified  based  on SLE treatment  at Baseline  and geographic  region  (see §10.2 ). 
Subjects  will be followed  for 4 weeks  from  the End of Treatment (EoT)  visit (i.e., 6 weeks  after the last 
dose of study drug), from the end of Day 155 through Day 197. Assessments of AEs and disease 
activity, and collection of blood and urine for safety laboratory values, biomarkers of disease activity, 
PK, ADA, , will be performed throu ghout the study. Refer to the Schedule of 
Procedures and Assessments ( Table 1 ). 
Dense  PK samples  will be collected  in subjects  that agree  to participate;  subjects  in this subset  will stay 
in the clinic for 4 hours following administration of the first dose  of study drug, and will return to the 
clinic  1, 3, and 7 days following  the first study  drug administration  for collection  of additional  samples.  
Medications that are used for treatment of SLE at baseline (i.e., hydroxychloroquine/ 
hydroxychloroquine -like drugs, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants) should be maintained at stable 
doses through the Day 169 assessments, except for incidences of toxicity or for a protocol -defined 
short -term increase  (burst  and taper)  of corticosteroid  dose in response  to increased  disease  activity  or 
reduction  in corticosteroids  (taper)  to reduce  toxicity  in the context  of improvement  in disease  activity 
are detailed in §8.2. 
Randomization  will be stratified  by geographic  region  and will be stratified  based  on SLE treatmen t at 
Baseline (see §10.2 ). 
4.2. Estimated  Duration  of Participation  
Each  subject  will participate  for up to 34 weeks,  including  a Screening  period  of up to 6 weeks,  a 
24-week Treatment period, and a 4 -week Follow -up period.  
4.3. Stopping  and Discontinuation  Criteria  
4.3.1.  Study  Stopping  Criteria  
The Sponsor  may choose to  discontinue  the study  at any time for any reason.  
If any event(s) occur that, in the opinion of the Medical Monitor(s) or the  Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC), may contraindicate further administration of ALPN -101, enrollment of additional subjects, as 
well as administration  of study  drug,  may be suspended.  Such  events  may include,  but are not limited  to: 
 SAEs  assessed  as related to study  drug 
 Grade  3 or 4 AEs  assessed  as related  to study drug 
The DMC  and Sponsor  will conduct  a prompt  review  of cumulative  safety  data and the circumstances  of 
the event(s)  in question  to determine  whether  randomization  and dosing  should  be resumed,  whether  the 

PROTOCOL  AIS-A03 ALPN -101 
Alpine  Immune  Sciences  Inc. 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  16 of 73 
07 NOV  2022   
  
dose should be modified, whether the protocol should be modified, or whether the study should be 
discontinued  permanently.  Where  applicable,  the regulatory  authorities  and Institutional  Review  Boards 
(IRBs)/Independent Ethics Com mittees (IECs) will be notified of any actions taken with the study.  
In the event  of unanticipated  suspension  of dosing,  subjects  will continue  regularly  scheduled  visits  until 
a decision is reached by the  Sponsor. If  the study is stopped, subjects who have  received study drug will 
continue to be followed for assessment of safety and other outcomes for at least 8 weeks following the 
last dose of study drug.  
4.3.2.  Individual  Subject  Stopping  Criteria 
Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Individual  subjects  must  pause  or discontinue  treatment  with study  drug in the following  settings:  
 Development or worsening of lupus manifestations requiring introduction of certain 
prohibited  medications  or prohibited  dosages  of background  drugs,  when  continuation  of the 
study drug would place the subject at risk, as determined by the Investigator or Medical 
Monitor; see §8.2.2 . 
 Clinically  significant  abnormal  laboratory  results  or AEs which  rule out continuation  of the 
study drug, as determined by the Investigator or the Medical Monitor.  
 Infection  with SARS -CoV -2 during  the Treatment  Period;  the Medical  Monitor  must  approve 
the resumption of study drug dosing for any subject with confirmed (viral test positive) or 
suspected COVID -19 infection.  
 Grade ≥ 3 infection (e.g., pneumonia, sepsis) which cannot be sufficiently controlled within 
an adequate timeframe by anti -infective treatment or would put the subject at risk for 
continued  participation  in the trial, as determi ned by the Investigator  or the Medical  Monitor.  
 Inclusion or exclusion criteria violation that was noted after the subject started study drug, 
AND  the Investigator  and/or  Medical  Monitor  determine  that continuation  of the study  drug 
would place the subject at risk.  
 Development of an electrocardiogram (ECG) change considered clinically significant and 
with reasonable  possibility  of relationship  to study  drug;  or a confirmed  absolute  QT interval 
corrected for heart rate using Fride ricia’s correction formula (QTcF) value > 500 msec or 
confirmed increase of ≥ 60 msec from Baseline (i.e., if a subject’s QTcF increases from 
Baseline ≥ 60 msec, the Investigator will evaluate, confirm the value, and treatment should 
be stopped).  
 Developme nt of active  or latent  tuberculosis  (TB)  at any time during  the study;  a subject  with 
active or latent TB must pause dosing with blinded study drug; dosing can only be resumed 
following initiation of appropriate treatment and with the approval of the Medic al Monitor.  
 Pregnancy  while  on study drug.  
 Malignancy,  except  for localized  non-melanoma  skin cancer  or carcinoma  in situ of the 
cervix; if localized cancer is surgically excised with clear margins, dosing may resume 
following consultation with the Medical Monitor.  
 Significant  non-compliance  with study  procedures to  a degree  that would  put the subject  at 
risk for continued  participation  in the trial as determined  by the Investigator  or the Medical 
Monitor.  
PROTOCOL  AIS-A03 ALPN -101 
Alpine  Immune  Sciences  Inc. 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  17 of 73 
07 NOV  2022   
  
 Development  of active  neuropsychiatric  SLE (excluding  lupus  headache)  sufficiently  severe 
to interfere with ability of the subject to provide ongoing informed consent.  
 Investigator  decision:  Investigator  believes  it is in the best interest  of the subject  to 
discontinue treatment with study drug.  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment with study drug should have all procedures outlined in 
the EoT visit,  as well as an unscheduled  ECG,  performed  as soon  as possible,  and not later than the next 
scheduled visit.  
To minimize missing data for efficacy and safety assessments, subjects who prematurely discontinue 
treatment, and who do not withdraw consent, should otherwise continue with their regular study visit 
schedule  without  receiving  study  drug.  In subjects  who are unable  to continue  their regularly  scheduled 
visits,  a follow -up phone  call should  occur approximately  8 weeks  (corresponding  to 5X half-life) after 
the last dose of study drug to determine the status of any ongoing AEs/SAEs  or the occurrence of any 
new AEs/SAEs.  
Discontinuation  from  the Study  (Early  Termination)  
In addition  to the criteria  for discontinuing  study  drug summarized  above,  individual  subjects  may be 
discontinued from the study prematurely (i.e., prior to Day 197 ) for any of the following reasons:  
 Subject  decision  / withdrawal  of consent;  subjects  can request  to be discontinued  from 
participation in the study at any time for any reason  
 Investigator  decision:  Investigator  believes  it is in the best interest  of the subject  to be 
withdrawn from the study  
For subjects who withdraw from the study prematurely (i.e., prior to Day 197), the End of Study (EoS) 
evaluations  should  be completed  if possible,  preferably  within  2 weeks  of study  drug discontinuation.  In 
addition, a follow -up phone call should occur approximately 8 weeks (corresponding to 5X half -life) 
after the last dose of study drug to determine the status of any ongoing AEs/SAEs or the occurrence of 
any new AEs/SAEs.  
4.4. Rationale  for Study  Design,  Dose  Regimen,  and Population  
4.4.1.  Choice  of Study  Population  
The study  population  will comprise  adults  with at least 6 months  history  of SLE,  who have moderate  to 
severe active disease on stable SOC, but who do not require immediate aggressive therapy to prevent 
organ system da mage. Subjects are required to have activity in the musculoskeletal system, and/or 
mucocutaneous system, and/or renal system and/or have pleuritis or pericarditis at Screening and 
Baseline. This population will allow assessment of the safety of ALPN -101 in  the context of active 
inflammatory disease, and on a background of treatments commonly used for SLE. Assessment in 
subjects with this level of activity and involvement of relatively assessable organ systems at baseline 
may allow changes to be detected thr ough use of general and/or organ -specific assessment tools.  
A central verification system will be  used to confirm that the  level of  disease  activity at Screening is 
consistent  with inclusion/exclusion  criteria,  thereby  reducing  the impact  of variability  in Investigator 
assessment of disease activity and use of assessment tools.  
4.4.2.  Justification  of Study  Design  
The study  will be randomized,  placebo -controlled,  and blinded  to minimize  bias in reporting  of safety 
events, partially -subjective disease activity meas ures, and patient -reported outcomes.  
PROTOCOL  AIS-A03 ALPN -101 
Alpine  Immune  Sciences  Inc. 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  18 of 73 
07 NOV  2022   
  
Randomization  will be stratified  by use of concomitant  oral immunosuppressive  therapy;  stratification 
will reduce  the risk that the safety  assessment  of ALPN -101 may be confounded  by imbalance  in SOC 
agents that carry their own risks of AEs.  
Randomization  also will be stratified  by geographic  region.  
4.4.3.  Justification  of Dose  
The dosing regimen for this study is 3 mg/kg IV administration Q2W for 12 total doses. This regimen 
was selected  to provide  sufficient  drug exposure  to achieve  and sustain  high target  saturation  (≥ 90%)  on 
peripheral T cells and to be within appropriate safety margins of the NOAEL in Good Laboratory 
Practice (GLP) toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys.  
Specifically,  the geometri c mean  and lower  limit of 95% confidence  interval  of the serum  concentration 
of ALPN -101 at 3 mg/kg Q2W are predicted to maintain target saturation greater than 90% for at least 
24 weeks.  The projected steady  state exposures  at 3 mg/kg  are 47-fold (maximum  concentration  [Cmax]) 
and 31 -fold (area under the concentration -time curve [AUC]) lower relative to exposures at NOAEL 
(150 mg/kg/week) in the 13 -week and 6 -month GLP toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys.  
4.4.4.  Justification  of Endpoints  
This is the first c linical investigation to evaluate ALPN -101 in patients with active SLE, and the first 
clinical investigation of  dosing over  a duration of  greater  than 4 weeks. Therefore, the  primary objective 
is safety  and tolerability  which  will be assessed  by the type,  frequency,  severity,  and seriousness  of AEs, 
including clinically significant changes in symptoms, physical exam findings, vital signs, laboratory 
tests (hematology, serum chemistries, coagulation and urinalysis), and ECGs, and will be evaluated by 
compari son to placebo. Additional assessments and/or documentation will be collected for SAEs and 
may be collected for adverse events of interest (AEIs) related to mechanism of action (i.e., infections), 
mode of administration (e.g., infusion reactions), or obser vations in completed and ongoing trials (e.g., 
aphthous ulcers).  
A secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of ALPN -101 based on change in disease activity 
compared to placebo. The measurement of disease activity in SLE involves an assessment of 
characteristic signs and symptoms across multiple organ systems, along with the results of laboratory 
parameters. Multiple tools for assessment of global disease activity have been developed. The present 
study employs the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI -2K) and 
SLEDAI -2K 30-Day (SLEDAI -2K 30), British  Isles Lupus  Assessment  Group  index  (BILAG)  2004,  the 
Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PtGA), and a Physician’s Global Assessment of SLE 
Disease Activity (PhGA). The data from these tools can be used alone or combined as responder indices 
to measure efficacy.  
To gain a broad understanding of the potential impact of the novel mechanisms of ALPN -101 on SLE 
activity, change from baseline over time and comparison to placebo in results of several other 
assessments will be explored. These include assessments that may be more sensitive to change i n 
selected organ systems (Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index [CLASI] for 
mucocutaneous  disease;  
); proteinuria and renal function  for nephritis); combined responder indices (e.g.,  
SLE Responder Index [SRI] -4, -5, -6, -7, BILAG -based responder indices, others); prevention of 
increases in disease activity (e.g., proportion with, and time to new BILAG A or new or worsening 
BILAG B scor e; requirement for increased or new treatment); changes in laboratory parameters 
associated with SLE activity (e.g., C3, C4, CH50, high -sensitivity C -reactive protein (hsCRP), level of 
antibodies to double -stranded DNA [dsDNA]); and/or changes in  potentially  

PROTOCOL  AIS-A03 ALPN -101 
Alpine  Immune  Sciences  Inc. 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  19 of 73 
07 NOV  2022   
  
associated  with SLE disease  activity.  Detailed  description  of assessment  tools  is provided  in the 
Procedures Manual.  
Corticosteroids are associated with significant morbidity but are often highly effective and are often 
used to quickly  control  disease  flares  or when  other  therapeutic  measures  are inadequate.  Within  defined 
limits, the present study permits short term use (burst and taper) for increased activity during the study 
and provides guidelines for taper from baseline dose if disease activity improves (see §8.2.2 ). Dose and 
indication for change in dose of cor ticosteroids will be captured as concomitant medications. Change 
from baseline, number  of bursts, and total corticosteroid use  will be  explored as a  potential indication of 
efficacy.  
Patient -reported outcomes provide information that expand upon, and may d iffer from, information 
derived from disease activity assessments, in that they incorporate important subjective experience, 
including  fatigue  and quality  of life, and integrate  potential  negative  impact  of therapeutic  interventions. 
Therefore, the PtGA, S hort Form -36 (SF -36) health survey version 2, and the Functional Assessment of 
Chronic Illness Therapy –Fatigue (FACIT -F) (13 -item) will be assessed at intervals,  
of change from baseline and across treatment groups will be performed . 
Pharmacokinetic parameters, the impact of ADA, and the relationships between exposure and target 
saturation  that were  defined  in healthy  volunteers  may not be fully applicable  in SLE patients,  due to 
potential effects of SLE -related immune dysregulation,  ongoing inflammation, proteinuria, and 
background medication. Serum levels of ALPN -101, target saturation by ALPN -101 on circulating  
T cells,  and ADA  will be assessed  throughout  the study.  The impact  of exposure,  target  saturation,  and 
ADA on clinical outcomes may be explored.

6. CLINICAL  TRIAL  PROCESSES  AND  PROCEDURES  
The schedule of study visits, procedures, and assessments is provided in Table 1 . All visit windows are 
noted  and should  be calculated  from  randomization  (Day  1). Unscheduled  evaluations  may be performed 
at any time at the discretion of the Investigator as needed to assess subject’s clinical status; in the event 
of increased disease activity requiring a change in treatment, subjects should return to clinic as soon as 
possible to facilitate detail ed documentation of disease flare.  
All per-protocol  clinical  laboratory  disease -related  and safety  assessments  should  be performed  by the 
central laboratory. Planned time -sensitive laboratory evaluations may be duplicated at the site. A 
Laboratory  Manual  will provide  specifics  regarding  procedures  for the collection,  processing,  storage, 
and shipment of samples.  
A Procedures  Manual  will provide  details  regarding  processes  for subject  screening,  data collection,  skin 
photography, oral mucocutaneous lesion photography, ECG requirements, eligibility verification, 
randomization, follow -up, and other study -related activities. The Procedures Manual will also include 
information regarding training, conduct, and reportin g for efficacy assessments and quality of life 
measures.  
6.1. Screening  (Day  -42 to -1) 
All screening  procedures must  be performed within  42 days of Baseline  (Day  1 prior  to randomization). 
The screening  evaluations  may be carried  out over more  than one visit;  however,  all assessments  should 
be completed and documented as soon as possible —and no later than 14 days prior to planned 
randomization —to ensure that verification of disease activity can be completed within the screening 
window. Screening laboratory asse ssments that are out -of-range may be repeated once.  
Subjects  must  undergo  the following  screening  assessments  and evaluations:  
 Obtain  written  informed  consent  inclusive  of appropriate  privacy  authorization  prior  to 
undergoing any study -specific interventions.  
 Obtain  Medical  History,  including  complete  EULAR/ACR  SLE disease  history  and 
diagnosis form (refer to Procedures Manual).

6.6. Unscheduled  Visits  
6.6.1.  Early  Termination  
If a subject withdraws consent for study participation prior to Day 197, the EoS evaluations should be 
completed  if possible,  preferably  within  2 weeks  of study  drug discontinuation.  In addition,  a follow -up 
phone  call should  occur  8 weeks  after the last dose of study  drug to determine  the status  of any ongoing 
AEs/SAEs or the occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs.  
As noted in §4.3, subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment with study drug (i.e., due to subject 
choice, Investigator decision, an AE or other contraindication for ongoing receipt of study drug, etc.), 
and who do not withdraw consent, should have all procedures outl ined in the EoT visit as well as an 
unscheduled ECG, as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks. Afterwards, subjects should resume 
following the regular visit schedule as outlined in Table 1 , and adhere to all study procedures except for 
study  drug dosing.  As the subject  has discontinued  study  drug,  all concomitant  medication  restrictions  as 
outlined in §8.2.2 no longer apply. If at any point subsequently a subject no longer wants to provide 
assessments (withdrawal of  consent)  following discontinuation  of study drug and completion of  the EoT 
assessments, an EoS visit is not required.

6.6.2.  Unscheduled  Visits  for Increased  SLE  Activity  
Subjects requiring an unscheduled visit due to an increase in their SLE activity should have all safety 
assessm ents completed, SLEDAI -2K (assessed based on presentation without reference to the previous 
30 days), the PhGA, and the clinical biomarkers of SLE. BILAG will not be performed at an 
unscheduled  visit for increased  SLE activity;  increased  activity  should  be captured  at the next scheduled 
BILAG assessment, if applicable. See Procedures Manual.  
6.6.3.  Other  Unscheduled  Visits  
At any other  unscheduled  visits,  the full set of safety  assessments  should  be completed.  
6.7. Description  of Study  Procedures  
Medical  and Disease  History,  Demographics  
Includes medical, surgical, and disease histories. Disease history includes date of diagnosis, prior 
treatment and responses, and remarkable toxicities. Demographic information includes sex, age, and 
self-reported  race/ethnicity.  Ongoin g medical  conditions  will be documented,  together  with medications 
and therapeutic procedures that are expected to continue during the study. At Screening, a detailed 
history of prior SLE activity will be obtained.  
Physical  Examination  
Complete  physical  examination  will be performed  at intervals  designated  in the schedule  of assessments, 
and will include examination of head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, joints, muscle 
and soft tissues, neurologic system, skin and lymph nodes.  
Physic al examination  that is adequate  to assess  SLE disease  activity  by BILAG  and SLEDAI -2K 30 will 
be performed at each visit at which those assessment tools are employed, as designated in the schedule 
of assessments and detailed in the Procedures Manual.  
Physi cal examination  directed  based  on the review  of system  and/or  AEs will be performed  at planned 
and unplanned visits as indicated.  
Vital  Signs  
Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate) will be obtained with the 
subject  at the times  indicated  in the summary  of assessments.  Unless  otherwise  specified,  all vital signs 
should be measured after the subject has been resting, preferably for at least 5 minutes, and prior to 
invasive procedures such as drawing blood.  
Weight  
Body wei ght (kilograms) will be obtained with the patient’s shoes and jacket or coat removed. Total 
dose of blinded study drug administered will be based on the weight at Baseline (Day 1) unless weight 
has changed  from  baseline  by more  than 10%.  In that case,  total dose of blinded  study  drug administered 
will be based on the most current weight.  
Electrocardiogram  
All ECGs  should  be obtained  in accordance  with the central  ECG  instructions  in the Procedures  Manual. 
Subjects are to be resting, preferably in the supine position for approximately 5 minutes before each 
ECG.

TB Screening  
The imaging and diagnostic tests for TB screening should be interpreted in the context of the subject's 
epidemiol ogy, history,  exam  findings,  etc., and it is the responsibility  of the Investigator  to determine  if 
a subject has previous, active, or latent TB.  
At Screening, a chest x -ray will be performed for all subjects to rule out the presence of TB; however, 
the ch est x-ray will not be required if a subject had a previously normal imaging result (chest x -ray or 
computed  tomography)  within  3 months  of screening,  provided  all source  documentation  is available  at 
the site and provided nothing has changed in the subject ’s medical history to warrant a repeat test.  
All subjects will be tested for TB infection by QuantiFERON -TB Gold test at Screening. However, if a 
subject  had a negative  QuantiFERON -TB Gold  (or interferon -gamma  release  assay  equivalent  test, such 
as T-SPOT  TB test) or negative  purified  protein  derivative  (PPD)  test within  3 months  of screening,  and 
source documentation is available, the test does not need to be repeated, provided nothing has changed 
in the subject’s medical history to warrant a repeat test.  
Note:  If the QuantiFERON -TB Gold  test is indeterminate,  the site should  repeat  the test. If  the second 
QuantiFERON -TB Gold test is indeterminate, then a  PPD test should be  administered and interpreted 
per local guidance. If either the second QuantiFERON -TB Gold test or PPD test is negative, then the 
subject is considered negative for TB.  
Laboratory  Evaluations  
Laboratory evaluations will include infectious disease, hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, 
urinalysis, and pregnancy tests. Tests to evalua te and characterize disease activity of SLE will also be 
performed, as will PK and PD. All per -protocol laboratory samples should be collected and sent to the 
central lab using the kits provided, as described in the Laboratory Manual. At Screening, a local  
laboratory can be used with permission from the Sponsor. Variables to be tested and reported are 
summarized in APPENDIX 2 . If time -sensitive laboratory results are needed (e.g., in the context of an 
AE or increase  in SLE activity),  every  attempt  should  be made  to send duplicate  samples  for analysis  at 
the central laboratory.  
Physicians  Characterization  of SLE  and Assessment  of Disease  Activity  
Detailed  descriptions  of the assessment  tools,  including  information  on how they should  be administered 
and record ed, are provided in the Procedures Manual. These include SDI, BILAG -2004, SLEDAI -2K 
(SLEDAI -2K and SLEDAI -2K 30 versions), PhGA, CLASI,  and photography of skin 
lesions (photography when lesions are present and imaging is appropriate).  
Prior  to initiation of the study, all assessors must be trained and certified on the assessment tools 
(e.g., SLEDAI -2K 30, BILAG -2004, SDI, CLASI, and others as per the Procedures Manual) unless 
certification  within  the past 2 years  is documented.  Whenever  possible,  all SLE activity  assessments 
should be performed by the same assessor.  
Photography  of Oral  Mucocutaneous  Lesions  Reported  as AEIs  
Oral mucocutaneous  lesions  reported  as AEIs  should  be documented  photographically  at presentation 
and in the event o f significant change (see §9.8.2 and the Procedures Manual for more information).  
Patient  Reported  Outcomes  
Detailed description of  the patient reported outcomes’  tools, including information on how  they should 
be administered  and recorded,  are provided  in the Procedures  Manual.  These  include  SF-36, PtGA,  and 
FACIT -F (13 -item). Patient’s assessments should be completed before the physician’s assessments.

 8. CLINICAL  MANAGEMENT  GUIDELINES  AND  REQUIREMENTS  
8.1. Clinical  Management  of Adverse  Events  of Interest  
8.1.1.  Infusion -Related  Reactions  
Guidelines  for assessing,  grading,  and reporting  IRRs  are provided  in §9.8 and §9.8.1 . 
No infusion reactions were observed following single or repeated IV infusions of ALPN -101 in a 
previous study in healthy volunteers. The incidence and nature of ALPN -101-related IRRs, if any, 
remain uncharacterized. Based on experience with other immunomod ulatory compounds, including 
approved CD28 pathway inhibitors, IRRs may include hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) 
and/or cytokine release syndromes. IRRs typically present with dizziness, headache, circulatory 
(hypo - or hypertension),  respirat ory (cough,  wheezing,  dyspnea),  mucocutaneous  (flushing,  urticaria, 
pruritis, rash), and abdominal (nausea, vomiting, cramps, diarrhea) symptoms. Symptoms typically 
begin during or within 24 hours of drug administration.  
If any subject experiences  an infusion  reaction,  including  anaphylaxis  or cytokine  release  syndrome:  
 Monitoring  frequency  and duration  will be increased,  and will continue  until episode  is 
resolved.
 Supportive care will be initiated per institutional guidelines. This may include, but i s not 
limited to, slowing and/or interruption of the current infusion; administration of 
antihistamines  such as diphenhydramine  or loratadine;  administration  of antipyretics  such as 
acetaminophen or paracetamol; administration of corticosteroids; IV fluid support such as 
normal saline; vasopressors; anti -rigor medication such as meperidine. 
 Using the kits provided by the central laboratory, blood will be collected for assessment of 
serum  levels  of mast  cell tryptase  and quantitative  IgE; blood  should  be collected  as soon  as 
possible after  initiation of the  event, and repeated at 60 minutes and following resolution or 
discharge from care for the event. In addition, a serum sample for exploratory analysis of 
chemokines and cytokines should be collected. 
In the event  that an IRR occurs  when  the subject  is not in the clinic,  all subjects  should  undergo  an 
unscheduled visit as soon as possible (< 24 hr).

 Table  3 Guidelines  for Management  of IRRs  
 
AE Grade  ALPN -101 Dose  Modification  Toxicity  Management  
Any  Manage  per institutional  standards  at the discretion  of 
Investigator.  
Monitor subjects for signs and symptoms of IRR (e.g., fever 
and/or shaking chills, flushing and/or itching, alterations in 
heart  rate and blood  pressure,  dyspnea  or chest  discomfort,  or 
skin rashes) and anaphylaxis (e.g., acute onset of generalized 
urticaria,  angioedema,  wheezing,  hypotension,  or tachycardia).  
1 The infusion  rate may be decreased  by 
50% or temporarily interrupted until 
resolution of the event.  Acetaminophen,  antihistamines,  meperidine,  etc. may be 
administered per institutional standards  
Consider premedication, such as with antihistamines, 
acetaminophen,  NSAIDs,  or meperidine  per institutional 
standard prior to subsequent doses  
Steroids  should  not be used for routine  premedication  of 
Grade ≤ 2 infusion reactions  2 The infusion rate may be decreased 
50% or temporarily  interrupted  until 
resolution of the event.  
Subsequent  infusions,  if applicable, 
may be given at 50% of the initial 
infusion rate  
3 Consult  with Medical  Monitor  or

8.1.2.  Oral  Mucocutaneous  Lesions  
Aphthous ulcers were observed in 5 of 66 (7.5%) of healthy volunteers randomized to ALPN -101 in the 
previous  study  in healthy  volunteers.  All events  were  mild or moderate  and were  self-limited  or resolved 
with topical therapy (i.e., lidocaine; corticosteroids).  
Oral mucocutaneous lesions (including aphthous ulcers) not attributed to SLE are considered AEIs for 
assessmen t in the present  study;  any oral mucocutaneous  lesions  attributed  to underlying  SLE should  be 
reported in the appropriate disease index and not as AEs. Guidelines for reporting oral mucocutaneous 
lesions are provided in §9.8 and §9.8.2 . 
The differential  diagnosis  of new or worsening  oral mucocutaneous  lesions  that may occur  during  this 
study includes, but is not limited to: new or worsening SLE activity; infections (e.g., coxsackie A, 
herpes simplex, herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus, Epstein -Barr, HIV, TB; other bacterial or fungal 
infections); trauma (e.g., dental appliances); drug reactions (e.g., methotrexate -related mucositis, 
others); other autoimmune or inflammatory diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease; Behcet’s; 
others). If new oral mucocutaneou s lesions are observed during this study, efforts should be made to 
definitively determine cause, to the extent possible.  
Evaluation  should  include:  
 Culture  to assess  for infection,  if indicated
PROTOCOL  AIS-A03 ALPN -101 
Alpine  Immune  Sciences  Inc. 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  43 of 73 
07 NOV  2022   
  Consider  specialist  evaluation  by ear, nose and throat  or oral medicine  if diagnosis  is not 
clear; biopsy may be indicated in severe or refractory cases 
 For lesions  reported  as AEIs:  photographic  documentation  of lesions  at presentation  and in 
the event of significant change 
Therapy  should  be guided  by diagnosis,  severity,  and response  to initial  therapy.  Options  may include:  
 Oral and/or  topical  analgesics,  if indicated  for discomfort 
 Topical  corticosteroids,  if indicated  for control  of inflammation 
 Treatment  of underlying  condition
8.1.3.  Infections  Grade  ≥ 3 
In general, study drug administration should be withheld in the event of any infection that the 
Investigator  judges  to be clinically  significant. If  the infection  resolves,  study  drug may be restarted at 
the next scheduled  dose,  with approval  of the Medic al Monitor.  For this study,  infections  of Grade  ≥ 3 
are considered AEIs (see §9.8.3 ). Reporting requirements for AEIs are described in §9.8.  
8.2. Allowed  Medications  or Treatments  
8.2.1.  Non-SLE  Concomitant  Medications  
Use of non -SLE concomitant medications (including prescription and over -the-counter medications, 
herbal supplements/teas and vitamins, analgesics, non -prescription NSAIDs and other agents for 
treatment of AEs or supportive care that are not specifically pr ohibited) is permitted when deemed 
necessary  by the Investigator  or subject’s  care provider;  subjects  who are using  NSAIDs  infrequently  or 
“as needed” should make every attempt to withhold dosing on study visit days until SLE assessments 
have been complete d. 
For all non-SLE concomitant  medications  used at baseline,  or that are used intermittently  and expected 
to be used during the study (e.g., NSAIDs for menstrual discomfort; rescue inhalers for asthma), name 
and indication should be recorded in the medical  history.  
For all non-SLE medications  initiated  during  the study,  date of initiation,  dose,  date of change  in dose or 
discontinuation, and indication should be recorded. The associated AE should be documented.  
8.2.2.  Concomitant  Medications  for SLE 
From the signing of informed consent through completion of all assessments though the EoS visit, 
subject  should  receive  stable  doses  of medications  used as SOC  for SLE (including  oral corticosteroids, 
hydroxychloroquine/hydroxychloroquine -like drugs and pe rmitted immunosuppressants, as listed in 
Inclusion Criterion 7 ), except in circumstances summarized below:  
 Reduction  in dose or discontinuation  due to toxicity (§8.2.2.1) 
 Changes  to control  increased  disease  activity  or flare/  significant  worsening  of disease 
(§8.2.2.3)
8.2.2.1.  Reduction  in SLE  Medication  Dose  Due to Toxicity  
Standard of care medications for SLE may be reduced or temporarily discontinued if indicated for 
management  of immediate  safety  concerns;  the event  leading  to reduction  or discontinuation  should  be 
documented  as an AE,  and the relationship  to SOC  should  be recorded  (e.g., mucosal  ulcers  secondary 
to methotrexate; poor diabetic control secondary to corticosteroids; nausea and vomiting secondary to 
mycophenolate; others).

 8.2.2.2.  Discre tionary  Reduction  in Corticosteroid  Dose  Due Decreased  SLE  Disease  Activity 
After Day 85  
Corticosteroids may not be reduced due to decreased disease activity until after all assessments have 
been completed  through  Study  Day 85 (End  of Week  12). Thereafter,  corticosteroids  may be tapered  if 
all of the following are true (note that taper is permitted, but is NOT required):  
 In the Investigator’s  judgement,  it is in the subject’s  best interest  to taper corticosteroids.  
 If there  has been  an increase  in disease activity  during  the Treatment  Period  that required a 
burst and taper of corticosteroids to control increased SLE disease activity (§8.2.2.3), the 
corticosteroids  have  been  tapered  back to the dose at Baseline  or the dose prior  to initiation 
of the burst, and must have remained stable for at least 4 weeks.  
 The SLEDAI -2K 30 score  must  have improved  (be reduced)  by at least 4 points  from  the 
score recorded at the Baseline Visit.  
 The taper  must  be anticipated  to be completed  by Day 141 (end of Week  20); corticosteroid 
dose should be planned to remain stable from Day 141 (end of Week 20) through Day 169 
(EoT).  
General  guidelines  for tapering  corticosteroids:  
 If the current  dose is ≥ 15 mg/day  prednisone  equivalent,  taper  by not more  than 5 mg over 
the following 28 days.  
 If the current  dose is 7. 5 to < 15 mg/day  prednisone  equivalent,  taper  by no more  than 
2.5 mg prednisone  equivalent  over the following  28 days.  
 If the current  dose is > 0 to < 7.5 mg/day,  taper  by not  more  than1  mg over the following 
28 days.  
8.2.2.3.  Treating  Increases  in SLE  Activity  
The decision to treat increased SLE disease activity is based on the judgement of the Investigator. 
Increased  disease  activity  should  not be recorded  as an AE; however,  information  regarding  the organ 
system involved and the severity of disease activity leading to treatment should be captured in the 
disease assessments tools (e.g., BILAG 2004, SLEDAI -2K 30, PhGA) and also recorded as the 
indication for treatment with the concomitant medication. Increase in corticosteroids is treated 
separately from increase in, or addition of, other agents, as detailed below.  
Burst  and Taper  of Corticosteroids  
Prior to initiation of a burst of corticosteroids, all assessments should be completed that pertain to the 
visit at which  the increased  disease  was recognized,  if possible.  If the increased  disease  was recognized 
between scheduled visits, then the subject should return to the clinic and all assessments listed for an 
unscheduled visit due to increased SLE activity (see §6.6.2 ) should be performed.  
From  Day 1 through  Day 141, subjects  with increased  diseas e activity  that require  a temporary  increase 
from the baseline oral corticosteroid dose may initiate either of the following:  
 Oral corticosteroids administered up to a maximum dose of 40 mg prednisone/day (or 
equivalent)  and tapered  to the Day 1 dose by the end of the 14th day after initiation  at the 
latest, or  
 Intramuscular  methylprednisolone  up to a maximum  of 160 mg administered  at a single 
timepoint  
PROTOCOL  AIS-A03 ALPN -101 
Alpine  Immune  Sciences  Inc. 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  45 of 73 
07 NOV  2022   
 The following  additional  guidelines  apply:  
 A course  of oral or intramuscular  corticosteroids  cannot  be initiated  more  frequently  than 
every 28 days  
If a subject requires initiation of a burst of corticosteroids after Day 141, or at a higher dose, or more 
frequently,  or for longer  than permitted,  the subject  should  remain  in the study  for evaluation  of safety 
and outcomes. Blinded study drug may be continued if not contraindicated in the judgement of the 
Investigator following discussion with, and agreement by, the Medical Monitor.  
Increase  or Addition  of Hydroxychloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine -like Drugs  and/or 
Immunosuppressants for Increased SLE Activity  
If during  the Treatment  period  (Day  1 to 169) the SOC  medications  used at Baseline,  together  with the 
permitted bursts and taper of corticosteroids, are c onsidered to not be adequate for the treatment of 
increased disease activity, a subject may receive medications deemed necessary by the Investigator or 
treating physician. In that case, all of the following should be done:  
 Blinded  study  drug will be discon tinued  
 The subject  should remain  in the  study  for assessment  of outcomes,  including safety  
 The Investigator should consult the Medical Monitor AND the updated IB to discuss any 
additional  safety  assessments  to be performed  in addition  to those  included  in the protocol  
8.3. Prohibited  Medications  or Treatments  
The inclusion  criteria  list medications  that are permitted  for SOC  treatment  of SLE in the present  study. 
For each permitted  medication,  the dose and duration  over which  it must  be stable  prior  to Screening  or 
Baseline is provided.  
No new medication  for treatment  of SLE can be started  during  the study,  and no SOC  treatment  can be 
increased or decreased, excepted as detailed in §8.2. 
Subjects  should  not receive  live vaccines  during  the study;  all vaccinations  (live,  killed,  or conjugated) 
must be approved by the Medical Monitor prior to administration.  
Medications  that are specifically  excluded  are listed  in the exclusion  criteria  (§5.2). These  agents  must 
have been discontinued prior to Screening or Baseline. The length of time that must have passed 
following the last dose of each agent is provided in ( §5.2). 
Other  medications  not listed,  but with significant  immunosuppressive  or immunomodulatory  activity, 
should be reviewed and approved by the Medical Monitor prior to initiation.

 9. ADVERSE  EVENT  REPORTING  
The following  sections  describe  the minimum  requirements  for assessing  and reporting  AEs,  including 
SAEs and serious, unexpected, suspected adverse reactions for  subjects participating in trial AIS -A03.  
9.1. Adverse  Event  Definition  
An AE  is any untoward medical occurrence  associated with the  use of a drug in a  patient or  clinical trial 
participant,  whether or not considered drug -related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease 
temporally  associated  with the use of a drug,  whether  or not considered  related  to the drug (i.e., does not 
imply any judgment about causality).  
In the context of a clinical trial, AEs include exacerbation of a pre -existing illness or symptom, an 
increase  in frequency  or intensity  of a pre-existing  episodic  event  or condition,  or a condition  detected  or 
diagnosed after investigational product administration even though it may have been present prior to the 
start of the study.  
Events  that do not meet  the definition  of an AE include:  
 Medical  or surgical  procedures  (e.g.,  endoscopy,  appendectomy);  the condition  that leads  to 
the procedure should be reported as an AE if applicable;  
 Situations  where  an untoward  medical  occurrence  did not occur  (e.g.,  social  and/or 
observational and/or convenience admission to a hospital);  
 Anticipated  day-to-day fluctuations  of pre-existing  disease(s)  or condition(s)  present  or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
Abnormal  laboratory  values  or test results  constitute  AEs if they are clinically  significant  and/or  induce 
clinical signs or symptoms, or if they require intervention or therapy. Wherever possible, the clinical 
rather than laboratory term should be reported (e.g., “anemia” rather than “low hemoglobin”).  
Signs,  symptoms,  or the clinical  sequelae  of a suspected  overdose  of either  study  drug or a concomitant 
medication should also be reported as AEs (overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE).  
For this study,  signs  and symptoms  of SLE  activity  are not to be reported  as AEs,  but should  be 
captured in activity assessment tools. However, if SLE symptoms meet SAE criteria (see §9.3), 
expedited reporting requirements apply as per §9.4. 
9.2. Adverse  Event  Reporting  and Follow -up 
Any medical  condition  with an onset  or diagnosis  before  the first administration  of study  drug,  but after 
signing the informed consent form (ICF), will be noted as part of the subject’s baseline medical 
conditions. Signs and symptoms of SLE activity should not be reported as AEs, but should be 
documented in the relevant activity assessments.  
Information regarding all AEs will be collected from the time of first dose of study drug until the EoS 
visit, or for at least 8 weeks following the last infusion of study drug if the subject discontinues early. 
Adverse events that are thought to be related to the study drug and continue beyond this collection 
period will be followed until resolution or until stabilized. Adverse e vents that begin after the defined 
collection  period,  but that the Investigator  considers  to be related  to study  drug,  may be reported  at any 
time.  
Adverse  event  severity  will be graded  using  CTCAE,  version  5.0. When  CTCAE  criteria  cannot  be used, 
the AE s hould be graded as follows:  
PROTOCOL  AIS-A03 ALPN -101 
Alpine  Immune  Sciences  Inc. 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  47 of 73 
07 NOV  2022   
  Grade  1 (Mild):  Mild  transient  (< 48 hr) or mild discomfort  not requiring  medical 
intervention or therapy.  
 Grade  2 (Moderate):  Mild  to moderate  limitation  in activity;  some  assistance  may be needed; 
no or minimal medical intervention or therapy required.  
 Grade  3 (Severe):  Marked  limitation  in activity;  some  assistance  usually  required;  medical 
intervention or therapy required; hospitalizations possible.  
 Grade 4 (Life -threatening): Extreme limi tation in activity; significant assistance required; 
significant  medical  intervention  or therapy  required;  hospitalization  or hospice  care probable.  
 Grade  5 (Fatal):  Results  in death  
In general, the use of a unifying diagnosis as the AE term is preferred to the listing of individual 
symptoms. Grouping of symptoms into a diagnosis should only be done if each component sign and/or 
symptom  is a medically  confirmed  component  of a diagnosis  as evidenced  by standard  medical  practice. 
If any aspect of a sign or symptom does not fit into a classic pattern of the diagnosis, the individual 
symptom should be reported as a separate AE.  
9.3. Serious  Adverse  Event  Definition  
An SAE  is any AE that, in the view  of either  the Investigator  or the Sponsor,  results  in any of the 
following outcomes:  
 Death  
 A life-threatening  AE 
 Inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of an existing  hospitalization  
 A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct 
normal life functions, or  
 A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
Important  medical  events  that may not result  in death,  be life-threatening,  or require  hospitalization  may 
be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject 
and may require  medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  above.  Examples 
of such medical events include allergic bronchos pasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions.  
The term "life -threatening”  refers to an event in which the  subject was at risk of  death at the  time of the 
event;  it does not refer to an event  which  hypothetically  might  have caused  death  if it were  more  severe. 
CTCAE Grade 4 events are not automatically defined as life threatening for SAE determination. For 
example, a Grade 4 increase in ALT may or may not be deemed as life threatening by the Investigator 
and/or Sponsor.  
For hospitalizations  and surgical  procedures,  the illness  leading  to the surgical  or diagnostic  procedure 
should be recorded as the SAE, not the procedure itself. The procedure should be captured in the 
narrative as part of the therapeutic action taken in response to the illness.  
Additiona lly, hospitalization itself is not an AE but is an outcome of the event. Thus, hospitalization in 
the absence  of an AE is not regarded  as an SAE.  The following  are examples  of hospitalization  that may 
not be considered SAEs:  
 A visit to the emergency  room  or other  hospital  department  < 24 hours,  that does not result  in 
admission  
PROTOCOL  AIS-A03 ALPN -101 
Alpine  Immune  Sciences  Inc. 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  48 of 73 
07 NOV  2022   
  Protocol -specified  admission  (e.g.,  for procedure  required  by study  protocol)  
 Diagnostic  admission  (e.g.,  for a work -up of an existing  condition  such as persistent 
pretreatment lab abnormality)  
 Administrative  admission  (e.g.,  for annual  physical)  
 Social  admission  (e.g.,  placement  for lack of place to sleep)  
 Elective  admission  (e.g.,  for elective  surgery)  
 Admission  to a palliative  unit or  hospice  facility  
9.4. Emergency  Unblinding  
This study  is blinded;  neither  subjects  nor investigators  or site staff will be aware  of subjects’  treatment 
assignments.  However,  in the event  of a medical emergency  when  knowledge  of the treatment  received 
is needed for medical management of an SAE, the investigator may unblind an individual subject’s 
treatment allocation. When possible, prior to unblinding, the investigator should attempt discuss the 
reason for wanting to unblind with the Medical M onitor. Instructions for emergency unblinding are 
contained in the Procedures Manual (IRT/Suvoda, Site Safety Reporting Instructions).  
9.5. Serious  Adverse  Event  Reporting  and Follow  Up 
SAEs will be collected from the time of the first dose of study drug until the EoS visit, or for at least  
8 weeks  following  the infusion  of study  drug if the subject  discontinues  early.  SAEs  that are related  to 
the investigational product and continue beyond the normal collection period will be followed until 
resolution or until stabilized. SAEs that begin after the defined collection period, but that the 
Investigator considers to be related to study drug, may be reported at any time.  
All SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of clinical site personnel 
becoming  aware  of the event.  Refer  to the study  Procedures  Manual  for SAE  reporting  requirements  and 
details.  
9.6. Suspected  Adverse  Reaction  Definition  
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
investigational  product  caused  the AE. "Reasonable  possibility"  means  there  is evidence  to suggest  a 
causal relationship between the drug and the AE. The following criteria may be used as a guide for 
assessing causality:  
 Yes/Related  
There  is evidence  exists  to suggest  a causal  relationship  between  the drug and the AE, such 
as: 
 An event  that is uncommon  and known  to be strongly  associated  with drug exposure 
(e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome)  
 An event  that is not commonly  associated  with drug exposure,  but is otherwise 
uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture)  
 No/Unrelated  
Another cause of the AE is more plausible (e.g., due to underlying disease or occurs 
commonly  in the study  population),  or a temporal  sequence  cannot  be established  with the 
onset of the AE and administration of the study treatment, or a causal relationship is 
considered biologically implausible.

 9.7. Adverse  Event  Expectedness  
An AE or suspected  adverse  reaction  is considered  “unexpected”  if it is not listed  in the ALPN -101 IB. 
The Sponsor  or Medical  Monitor  is responsible  for determining  the expectedness  of all reported  SAEs, 
including serious suspected adverse reactions.  
9.8. Adverse  Events  of Interest  
The occurrence  of an  AEI whether serious  or nonserious,  must  be immediately  reported  to AIS within  
≤ 24 hours  of site awareness  by entering  the information  into the electronic  data capture  (EDC)  system, 
then completing an AEI narrative form and sending it to the following email address:  
 safety@alpineimmunesciences.com  
The AEI reporting  period will  begin  at the time of first dose of study  drug and continues  until the final 
study day (i.e., EoS visit, or end of follow -up for subjects prematurely withdrawn).  
Recommendations  regarding  the medical  management  of AEIs  can be found  in §8.1. 
AEIs are listed below:  
 IRRs  (see §9.8.1 ) 
 Oral mucocutaneous  lesions  (including  aphthous  ulcers)  not attributed  to SLE (see §9.8.2 ) 
 Infections  Grade  ≥3 (see §9.8.3 ) 
9.8.1.  Infusion -related  Reactions  
Terminology  and Grading  of IRRs  
The term “IRR” should generally be used and the severity assessed per CTCAE v5.0. More specific 
terms  should  only be used when  the mechanism  and/or  diagnosis  can be definitively  determined.  For 
instance,  “anaphylaxis”  should  only be used for events  fitting  the criteria  in Table  4, while  “cytokine 
release syndrome” should be used for fitting the description in Table 5 and determined to be in 
association with the release of cytokines.  
An allergic reaction which occurs in relationship to study drug administrat ion should be reported as an 
IRR.  Each  sign or symptom  of the reaction  should  be recorded  as an individual  AE. If multiple  signs  or 
symptoms occur with a given infusion -related event, each sign or symptom should be recorded 
separately with its level of severity.

Anaphylaxis  is highly  likely  when  any one of the three  following  criteria  are fulfilled:  
1. Acute  onset  of an illness  (minutes  to several  hours)  with involvement  of the skin,  mucosal  tissue,  or both (e.g., 
generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips -tongue -uvula) and at least one of the following:  
  Respiratory  compromise  (e.g.,  dyspnea,  wheeze -bronchospasm,  stridor,  reduced  PEF,  hypoxemia)  
  Reduced  BP or associated  symptoms  of end-organ  dysfunction  (e.g.,  hypotonia  [collapse],  syncope,  incontinence)  
2. Two or more  of the following  that occur  rapidly  after exposure  to a likely  allergen  for that patient  (minutes  to several 
hours):  
  Involvement  of the skin-mucosal  tissue  (e.g.,  generalized  hives,  itch-flush,  swollen  lips-tongue -uvula)  
  Respiratory  compromise  (e.g.,  dyspnea,  wheeze -bronchospasm,  stridor,  reduced  PEF,  hypoxemia)  
  Reduced  BP or associated  symptoms  (e.g.,  hypotonia  [collapse],  syncope,  incontinence)  
  Persistent  gastrointestinal  symptoms  (e.g.,  crampy  abdominal  pain,  vomiting)  
3. Reduced  BP after exposure  to known  allergen  for that patient  (minutes  to several  hours):  
  Infants  and children:  low systolic  BP (age specific)  or greater  than 30% decrease  in systolic  BP* 
  Adults:  systolic  BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater  than 30% decrease  from  that person’s  baseline

lesions) should not be reported as AEs , but should be recorded in SLED AI-2K 30 (mucosal ulcers) 
and/or  BILAG  2004  (mucosal  ulceration –mild,  or mucosal  ulceration –severe,  as appropriate  consistent 
with glossary definitions) and/or CLASI (mucosal lesions). Treatment should be recorded as 
concomitant medications, listing SLE ac tivity as the indication for treatment.  
Any oral mucocutaneous lesions not attributed to SLE should be reported as AEIs and graded 
according  to CTCAE  (see §9.2). Whenever  possible,  the specific  cause  or type (e.g.,  thrush)  should  be 
reported. Aphthous ulceration, if not assessed as related to SLE, may be reported as “aphthous ulcer,” 
“aphthous stomatitis” or other similar verbatim term as considered appropriate by the Investigator.  
However,  in such cases  when  no specific  term exist s in CTCAE,  the AE should  be graded  according  to 
“mucositis oral” or “pharyngeal mucositis,” as appropriate to the anatomical location of the lesion(s). 
Table 6 provides terms and for grading for some oral mucocutaneous lesions per CTCAE.  
Note: For lesions  reported as AEIs, photographic documentation should be collected at 
presentation  and in the event  of significant  change  (as detailed  in the Procedures  Manual).

 10. STATISTICAL  AND  DATA  ANALYSIS  METHODS  
10.1. Overview  of Statistical  Methods  
Detailed methodology and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study will be documented in a 
statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be finalized prior to unblinding the study database. A general 
overview of the planned methodology is prov ided below. Any deviation from the planned analysis will 
be detailed  in the SAP. In  all cases,  analyses  defined  in the SAP take precedence  over descriptions in  the 
Protocol. All post -hoc analyses will be detailed in the final clinical study report.  
10.2. Sample  Size 
The primary  purpose  of this phase  2 study  is to access  the safety  of ALPN -101 in subjects  with moderate 
to severe SLE. As such, the anticipated sample size of approximately 130 subjects randomized 1:1 to 
receive ALPN -101 or placebo was not derived to support formal hypothesis testing of efficacy  
endpoints.  
To estimate the power to detect potential differences in efficacy endpoints of primary interest, placebo 
response rates of 40% for SRI -4 and 20% for BILAG were assumed. A sample size of 65 subjects p er 
treatment arm will provide 82% and 87% power to detect a difference of at least 25% between the 
ALPN -101 arm and the placebo  arm at Day 169 in SRI-4 and BILAG  response,  respectively,  based  on a 
chi-square test with a two -sided significance level of 0.05  and no adjustments for multiple testing.  
10.3. Method  of Assignment  to Treatment  
Randomization  will be stratified  by geographical  region  and by use of concomitant  oral 
immunosuppressive therapy at enrollment in two groups:  
 Concomitant use of at least one of the permitted immunosuppressants (e.g., methotrexate, 
leflunomide, azathioprine, 6 -mercaptopurine, mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid), and/or 
corticosteroids  at doses  > 5 mg prednisone  or equivalent  daily  with or without  hydroxychloroquine/ 
hydroxychloroquine -like drugs ; vs  
 No use of permitted immunosuppressant and/or corticosteroids at doses > 5 mg prednisone or 
equivalent  daily;  with or without  use of lower  doses  of corticosteroids  and/or  hydroxychloroquine/ 
hydroxychloroquine -like drugs  
10.4. Analysis  Populations  
 Modified  Intent -To-Treat  (mITT)  Population:  all randomized  subjects  who received  any amount 
of study drug and completed at least one post -baseline disease assessment. mITT subjects will be 
analyzed according to the treatment arm into which they were randomized regardless of the actual 
treatment received. The mITT is the analysis population  for the primary efficacy analysis.  
 Safety Population: all randomized subjects, classified according to the actual treatment received, 
who received  any amount  of study  drug and have  at least one post-baseline  safety  evaluation.  This is 
the primary analysis  population for the safety analysis.  
 PK Population:  all subjects  who received  ≥ 1 dose of ALPN -101 and have ≥ 1 post-dose PK 
concentration reported.  
Other  analysis  populations  may be defined  in the SAP.

 10.5. Planned  Analyses  
10.5.1.  Disposition  of the Study  Subjects  
The disposition of the randomized subjects will be described by treatment group of the number of 
subjects  randomized,  the number  of subjects  treated,  the number  of subjects  in each analysis  set, and the 
number of subjects permanently discont inued (from the study along with the primary reasons for 
discontinuation).  
10.5.2.  Demographic  and Baseline  Characteristics  
Demographic  and baseline  disease  characteristics  will be summarized  and compared  by treatment  group.  
Medical history will be summarized by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
System Organ Class and Preferred Term, according to treatment group. Prior medications will be 
categorized  using  the Anatomical  Therapeutic  Chemical  (ATC)  codes  in the World  Health  Organization 
Drug (WHODRUG) dictionary and summarized according to treatment group.  
10.5.3.  Investigational  Product  and Concomitant  Therapies  
Exposure to investigational product will be calculated for each subject and summarized. The total 
amount  of investigational  product  given  will be calculated  for each  subject  and will be compared  to the 
amount  expected  to be given  for each subject.  Treatment  compliance  will be calculated  for each subject 
and summarized using descriptive statistics.  
Concomitant  therapies  will be classified  according  to the ATC  codes  in the WHODRUG  dictionary. 
Corticosteroid  usage  will be standardized  to equivalent  prednisone  doses.  The incidence  rate of each 
coded concomitant medication will be tabulated by treatment group. The table will be sorted by the 
incidence use of the entire sample.  
10.5.4.  Efficacy  Analyses  
In all cases, analyses  defined  in the SAP take precedence  over descriptions in  the Protocol.  
To address the secondary study objective of assessing evidence of efficacy, the efficacy endpoints of 
primary interest include the proportion of subjects achieving SRI -4 response at Day 169 and the 
proportion  of subjects  achieving  BILAG -based  Composite  Lupus  Assessment  (BICLA)  response  at Day 
169. 
All efficacy  measures  will be summarized  and analyzed  for the mITT  population.  
For categorical endpoints, the number and proportion of subjects in each at each visit will be pres ented 
by treatment group. Proportions will be compared using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted for 
randomization  stratification  factors.  An estimate  of the difference  in proportions  and corresponding  95% 
confidence interval will be presented. P -values may be presented for the efficacy endpoints of primary 
interest.  
For continuous  endpoints,  the mean,  standard  deviation,  median,  minimum,  and maximum  at each visit. 
For continuous endpoints with multiple post-Baseline visits, the treatment effect will be assessed 
through Mixed -effect Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) based on observed data.  
10.5.5.  Safety  Analyses  
All safety data will be summarized descriptively by treatment group and analyzed based on the safety 
population.  The safety  endpoints  include  the incidence  of treatment -emergent  AEs,  SAEs,  AEIs,  and the 
incidence  of clinically  significant  abnormalities  in laboratory  analytes,  ECG  parameters,  and vital signs.  
PROTOCOL  AIS-A03 ALPN -101 
Alpine  Immune  Sciences  Inc. 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  56 of 73 
07 NOV  2022   
 All AEs will be coded using MedDRA a nd will be assessed for severity, relationship to investigational 
product, and seriousness. Incidence will be presented by System Organ Class and Preferred Term. The 
mean  change  from  baseline  in the continuous  safety  measures  including  vital signs  and laboratory  values 
will be summarized by treatment arm and visits.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics, including number of subjects, 
mean,  median,  standard  deviation,  minimum  and maximum.  Categorical  endpoints  will be summa rized 
using frequency distributions and corresponding percentages.  
10.5.6.  Pharmacokinetic  Analyses  
In all cases,  analyses  defined  in the SAP take precedence  over descriptions  in the Protocol.  
Data from the PK population will be used in the analysis of PK endpoints. The PK data obtained in 
dense PK subset subjects will be analyzed using non -compartmental analysis (NCA). The PK 
parameters including C max, AUC, and trough concentration (C trough) will be determined based on the 
available data. Descriptive statistics (n, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and 
maximum) will be calculated for the PK parameters. The PK data may be analyzed using a population 
approach  via nonlinear  mixed effect  modeling.  Estimated  PK parameters  and population  PK parameters, 
if available, may be examined for relationship with patient factors such as age, weight, sex, disease 
characteristics, safety, efficacy,  
The incidence,  timing,  and titer of ADA  to study  drug will be summarized  using  descriptive  statistics  by 
treatment groups. Samples confirmed positive for ADA may be explored for neutralizing capacity. The 
possible effects of ADA on PK, efficacy and safety may be explored.  
10.6. Interim  Analysis  
An administrative interim analysis may be performed when approximately 50% of subjects have 
comple ted assessments  through  Week  24. Details  regarding  interim  analysis  will be included  in the SAP.

 APPENDIX 1  GUIDANCE  ON CHILDBEARING  POTENTIAL  AND  HIGHLY 
EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION  
Contraceptive  Guidance  
Investigators  shall counsel  WOCBP  and fertile  male  participants  who are sexually  active  with WOCBP 
on the importance of pregnancy prevention and the implications of an unexpected pregnancy.  
Investigators  shall advise  these  participants  on the use of highly  effective  methods  of contraception  for 
WOCBP and will check for adherence during study visits.  
Guidance  for WOCBP  Participants  
WOCBP  must  use a highly  effective  method  of contraception  consistently  and correctly  during  the study 
and for at least 3 months after the last dose of investigation al product.  
Highly  effective  methods  of contraception  have a failure  rate of < 1% per year when  used consistently 
and correctly.  
The following  methods  of contraception  are considered  highly  effective:  
 Combined  hormonal  (estrogen  + progestin)  contraception  (oral,  intravaginal,  transdermal) 
associated with inhibition of ovulation.  
 Progestogen - or progestin -only hormonal  contraception  (oral,  injectable,  implantable) 
associated with inhibition of ovulation.  
 Intrauterine  device.  
 Intrauterine  hormone -releasing  system.  
 Bilateral  tubal  occlusion.  
 Vasectomized  partner.  
 Sexual abstinence: defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire 
period  of risk associated with  the study  treatments  (i.e., during  the study  and for at least 3 
months after th e last dose of investigational product). The reliability of sexual abstinence 
needs  to be evaluated  in relation  to the duration  of the clinical  study  and the preferred  and 
usual lifestyle of the participant.  
Guidance  for Male  Participants  with WOCBP  Partners  
Male  participants  with a pregnant  or non-pregnant  WOCBP  partner  must  use a condom  during  the study 
and for at least 3 months after the last dose of investigational product. In addition, non -pregnant 
WOCBP partners of fertile male participants must  use a highly effective method of contraception as 
defined above for WOCBP participants.  
Woman  of Childbearing  Potential  
A woman  is considered  a WOCBP,  i.e., fertile,  following  menarche  and until becoming  postmenopausal 
unless permanently sterile.  
 Permanent  sterilization  methods  include  the following:  hysterectomy,  bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.  
 Postmenopausal  is defined  as no menses  for 12 months  without  an alternative  medical  cause. 
A high follicle stimulating hormone level in the postmenopausal range will be used to 
confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormone

 replacement  therapy.  However,  in the absences  of 12 months  of amenorrhea,  a single  follicle 
stimulating hormone (FSH) measurement is insufficient.  
Fertile  Man  
A man is considered fertile  after puberty  unless  permanently  sterile  by bilateral  orchidectomy.

 APPENDIX  2 CLINICAL  LABORATORY  ASSESSMENTS  
All per-protocol  laboratory  assessments  will be performed  by the central  lab as scheduled  in Table  1. At 
Screening, a local laboratory can be used with permission from the Sponsor. Screening laboratory 
assessments that are out -of-range may be repeated once. In vestigators must document their review of 
each laboratory safety report. NOTE: the Investigator is responsible for performing urine 
pregnancy testing using the provided kits as noted in Table 1 .

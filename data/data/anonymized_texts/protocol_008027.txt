Protocol Synopsis 
Title:  A Double Blind, Randomized, Placebo Controlled, Multicenter Study to Evaluate Safety, 
Tolerability, and Efficacy on LDL-C of Evolocumab (AMG 145)  in Subjects with HIV and with 
Hyperlipidemia and/or Mixed Dyslipidemia 
Study Phase :  3b 
Indication :  Hypercholesterolemia and/or mixed dyslipidemia  
Primary Objective:  To evaluate the effect of 24 weeks of subcutaneous (SC) evolocumab 
administered every month (QM) compared with placebo QM on percent change from baseline in 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -positive 
subjects with hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia. 
Secondary Objectives:   
• To assess the effects of 24 weeks of SC evolocumab QM compared with placebo QM on 
change from baseline in LDL-C, and percent change from baseline in non- high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (non -HDL-C), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), total cholesterol  (TC), 
lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], triglycerides, HDL-C, and very low -density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(VLDL-C), in HIV-positive subjects with hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia  
• To assess the effects of 24 weeks of SC evolocumab QM compared with placebo QM on 
percent of subjects attaining LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol /L) in HIV-positive subjects with 
hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia  
• To assess the effects of 24 weeks of SC evolocumab QM compared with placebo QM on 
percent of subjects attaining a 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline in HIV-positive subjects 
with hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia 
Safety Objective:  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SC evolocumab QM compared with 
placebo QM in HIV-positive subjects with hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia  
Hypotheses :  Subcutaneous evolocumab QM will be well tolerated and will result in greater 
reduction of LDL-C, defined as percent change from baseline at week 24 compared with placebo 
QM in HIV-positive subjects with hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia.  
Primary Endpoint :  Percent change from baseline in LDL-C at week 24  
Secondary Endpoints : 
For week  24 the following secondary endpoints will be characterized:  
• Tier 1  
− Change from baseline in LDL-C 
− Percent change from baseline in non -HDL-C 
− Percent change from baseline in ApoB  
− Percent change from baseline in TC 
− Achievement of target LDL -C < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L)  
− LDL-C response (50% reduction of LDL -C from baseline)  
• Tier 2  
− Percent change from baseline in Lp(a)  
− Percent change from baseline in triglycerides  
− Percent change from baseline in HDL-C 
− Percent change from baseline in VLDL -C 
Safety Endpoint(s):  
• Subject incidence of treatment emergent adverse events  
• Safety laboratory values and vital signs at each scheduled assessment  
• Incidence of anti -evolocumab antibody (binding and neutralizing) formation

Study Design :  This is a phase 3b, multicenter, double- blind, randomized, placebo- controlled 
study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of evolocumab in HIV-positive subject s with 
hyperlipidemia and/or  mixed dyslipidemia. 
Sample Size :  Approximately 450 subjects will be enrolled in the study, with approximately 
300 subjects in the evolocumab group. 
Summary of Subject Eligibility Criteria :   The study will enroll adult subjects (≥  18 years of age) 
with known HIV infection,  who have received stable HIV therapy for ≥  6 months prior to 
randomization and that is not expected to change during the  duration of study 
participation . Subjects must be on stable doses of lipid-lowering therapy for ≥ 4 weeks and 
not expected to change during the duration of the study . Subjects should be on maximally 
tolerated dose of statins. For some subjects, “maximally  tolerated” may indicate no statin 
at all due to statin intolerance or contraindication to statin therapy. A statin -intole rant 
subject must meet the criteria described in Section  4.1.1 , criterion 106 . Subjects w ithout 
known clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) must have  fasting LDL -C 
of ≥ 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) or non- HDL-C of ≥ 130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L) as determined by 
the central laboratory at screening. Subjects with known clinical ASCVD must have fasting 
LDL- C of ≥  70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) or non- HDL-C of ≥  100 mg/dL (2.6  mmol/L) as 
determined by the central laboratory. Clinical ASCVD is defined as a history of myocardial infarction, stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral arterial disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin. Subjects must also have fasting triglycerides ≤ 600 mg/dL (6.8 mmol/L). 
For a full list of eligibility criteria, please refer to Section  4.1 through  Section  4.1.2.   
Investigational Product :  Evolocumab or matching placebo administered by automated 
mini- doser (AMD ) or prefilled autoinjector  (AI)/Pen.  
Amgen Investigational Product Dosage and Administration:   
The Amgen investigational medicinal product (IMP) is evolocumab and placebo. The Amgen 
investigational product (IP) is the IMP plus the device (AMD [called an “on -body infuser 
prefilled cartridge” in the United States or AI/ pen). In this document, IMP will be referred to as 
IP.  
Double-b lind Treatment Period: 
Evolocumab 420 mg or matching placebo wil l be administered QM  at day  1 and weeks  4, 8, 12, 
16, and 20 as an SC injection. The IP ma y be delivered by AMD or by  3 injections with AI/ pen. 
Observed, in -clinic dosing should occur at day 1 and week  20.  
Open -label Period: 
Subjects who receive a dose of IP at w eek 20 will continue in an open- label period  where all 
subjects will be treated with evolocumab 420 mg QM at weeks 24, 28, 32, 36, 40,  44, and 48. 
Dosing at week  24 is expected to be in- clinic while the remaining doses will  be at  an appropriate 
non-clinic setting (eg, at the subject’s home ). Subjects who do not wish to self-inject  in a 
non-clinic setting (eg, at the subject’s home ) may return to clinic for injection.  
Procedures:  
After subjects complete the informed consent form, s creening should be completed and the 
subject randomized or screen failed after 4 weeks (±  1 week) of signing the informed consent . 
Subjects will undergo SC placebo injection with the device anticipated to be used during study 
(AMD or AI/pen ) during screening. Subjects who tolerate the placebo injection, complete all 
screening procedures, and successfully meet all eligibility criteria at the end of screening will 
enter the double -blind treatment  period.  
Subjects will be randomized via interactive voice response system/interactive web response 
system (IVRS/IWRS) and will return to the study site for day 1 procedures while continuing their background HIV and lipid -lowering  (if applicable) treatment . Baseline evaluations will be 
performed on day 1 of treatment before subjects receive the first dose of  IP. Laboratory tests will 
be conducted at day  1 and week 12. Vital signs, safety data reporting, urine pregnancy testing

(as appli cable), and concomitant therapy will be recorded at each visit . At the end of the 
double- blind treatment period at week 24 , laborator y tests will be conducted, and vital signs, 
safety data reporting, urine pregnancy testing (as applicable) concomitant therapy, physical 
examination, and body weight/waist circumference will be recorded.  
Following the double -blind t reatment period, subjects who received a dose of IP at w eek 20 will 
continue to a 24-week  open -label period in which  all subjects will be treated with QM evolocumab 
at weeks 24,  28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48. Laboratory tests will be conducted at week 36 and 
week  52 . Vital signs, safety data reporting, urine pregnancy testing (as applicable),  and 
concomitant therapy will be recorded at  week 36. At  end of study  week 52, vital signs, safety data 
reporting, urine pregnancy testing (as applicable), concomitant therapy, physical exam ination , 
body weight , and waist circumference will be recorded . 
The overall study design is described by a study schema at the end of this synopsis section. For  
a full list of study procedures, including the timing of each procedure, please refer to Section  7 
and the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 3 ).  
Statistical Considerations :  The primary analysis will be performed when all randomized 
subjects in double- blind treatment period have either completed all the scheduled study visits in 
the double- blind treatment period or have early terminated from the study.  The superiority of 
evolocumab to placebo will be assessed for all efficacy endpoints on the full analysis set (FAS), 
which includes all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of IP  in the double- blind 
treatment period. To assess the primary endpoint of the mean percent change from baseline in 
LDL-C at week 24, a repeated measures linear effects model will be used on the FAS to compare 
the efficacy of evolocumab with placebo. The repeated measures model will include terms for 
treatment group, stratification factors, scheduled visit and the interaction of treatment with scheduled visit. Missing values will not be imputed for primary analysis.
 To evaluate the 
robustness of the analysis results, sensitivity analyses will be performed as follows :  the primary 
analysis  will be repeated using the computer analysis set ( CAS); non-parametric analyses will be 
performed; a sensitivity analysis under the assumption that subjects who discontinued IP with 
missing endpoint data have a mean zero percent change from baseline will be conducted. The 
statistical model an d testing of the tier 1 secondary efficacy endpoints will be similar  to the 
primary analysis of primary endpoint . Analysis of the tier 2 secondary efficacy endpoints will use 
the same analysis model as the tier 1 endpoints . Safety endpoints will be summari zed 
descriptively by treatment group.

2. BACKGROUND AND RAT I
ONALE  
2.1 Disease 
Approximately 35 million individuals are living with HIV worldwide, with 1.3 million in the 
United States ( Kohli and Giugliano 2013). In countries with access to highly active 
antiretroviral therapy, the prognosis of HIV infection has changed with mortality from 
CONFIDENTIAL    

Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20130286  
Date:  30 January 2017 Page 15 of 73 
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related causes declining while non-AIDS 
related causes, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), have risen. HIV -infected 
patients have an increased risk of CVD as evidenced by increased rate of myocardial 
infarction (MI) after accounting for age and other comorbidities ( Triant et al , 2007).  
In the Veterans Aging Cohort Study Virtual Cohort, HIV-positive veterans had an almost 
50% greater risk of incident MI compared with uninfected veterans after statistical adjustment for Framingham risk, comorbidities, and substance abuse 
(Freiberg et al, 2013). A study by the Boston healthcare system showed a 20% higher 
risk of ischemic stroke in HIV positive versus matched HIV negative controls, adjusted 
for demographics and stroke risk factors . This study also linked a higher viral load to 
increased stroke risk ( Chow et al , 2012). In addition, a worse outcome after MI has been 
reported among HIV-positive patients when compared to the general population 
(Carballo et al , 2015). 
By the year 2015, it is estimated that over half of HIV -infected individuals will be aged 
50 years and older, and CVD will therefore become even more important in this patient 
population. 
The etiology of CVD in HIV -infected patients is multifactorial. HIV infected patients have 
higher rates of significant comorbidities including dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, 
and smoking compared with non-HIV infected patients (Triant et al , 2007;  
Boccara et al, 2013). HIV-infected patients also have higher levels of inflammatory 
mark ers including interleukin-6 (IL-6), high sensitivity C -reactive protein (hsCRP), 
D-Dimer, and soluble
 cell differentiation antigen s CD14 ( Kuller et al , 2008;  
Neuhaus  et al, 2010).  
The Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy (SMART ) Study showed a 
higher rate of CVD events in patients who discontinued antiretroviral treatment 
compared with patients on continuous therapy, with a hazard ratio of 1.57 
(El-Sadr et al, 2006). In groups experiencing treatment interruption, the levels of the 
inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and the coagulation marker D -dimer were significantly 
elevated. Markers of inflammation were also related with the changes in HIV-RNA levels 
in other treatment interruption studies ( Calmy et al, 2009). In addition, these 2 markers 
showed a statistically signification correlation with death. Elevations of IL-6 have also been statistically associated with the development of CVD ( Kuller et al , 2008).

Date:  30 January 2017 Page 16 of 73 
In addition to the increased risk of CVD attributed directly to HIV infection, HIV 
therapy  itself, particularly protease inhibitors (PI), are also linked to increased CVD 
risk. HIV therapy has been shown to promote adipocyte dysfunction which leads 
to a lipodystrophy syndrome ( Carr 2000; Grinspoon 2005; Capeau 2007; 
Boccara et al, 2010; Caron-Debarle et al , 2010). The lipodystrophy syndrome is 
manifested as increased visceral fat, elevated triglycerides, and low HDL-C . Increased 
rates of insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus, in addition to lipodystrophy, have also 
been reported in HIV -infected patients. (Carr et al , 1999; Periard et al , 1999; 
Grinspoon 2005). These factors demonstrate the etiology and pathophysiology of 
increased CVD risk seen in HIV -infected patients is multifactorial and includes HIV 
infection itself, therapy for HIV including PI therapy, inflammation, and traditional cardiac risk factors including dyslipidemia.  
In an observational cohort study of HIV-infected patients, statin therapy contributed to the reduction of all -cause mortality ( Rasmussen et al , 2013). Randomized, controlled 
trial data demonstrating statin reduction in cardiovascular  mortality in HIV subjects is not 
available although a trial using pitavastatin is now ongoing. In the HIV population, those 
patients treated with statins appear to be relatively resistant to statin effects as 
evidenced by lower than expected decreases in TC and LDL-C ( Johns et al , 2007; 
Silverberg et al , 2009). 
2.2 Amgen Investigational Product Background 
Recycling of the hepatic cell surface LDLR plays a critical role in regulating serum LDL -C 
levels. PCSK9 binds to the LDLR and downregulates hepatic cell surface LDLR, which, 
in turn, leads to increased levels of circulating LDL-C . Humans with PCSK9 
loss-of-function mutations  have cholesterol levels lower than normal and reduced 
incidence of coronary heart disease ( Abifadel et al , 2009). Evolocum ab (formerly 
referred to as AMG  145) is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G2, developed at 
Amgen Inc., that specifically binds to PCSK9 , preventing its interaction with the LDLR . 
The inhibition of PCSK9 by evolocumab leads to increased LDLR expression and 
subsequent decreased circulating concentrations of LDL-C. 
Refer to the Evolocumab Investigator ’s Brochure for more information on evolocumab. 
2.3 Rationale 
It has been shown that HIV -infected patients are at higher risk of CVD and have 
limitations with statin therapy including possible statin resistance, and elevations of 
PCSK9 are seen in chronic inflammatory states including HIV infection. Treatment with 
CONFIDENTIAL    
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20130286  
Date:  30 January 2017 Page 17 of 73 
an anti -PCSK9 monoclonal antibody is therefore a plausible target for LDL -C reduction 
in HIV-infected individuals. 
It is anticipated that evolocumab may be used in HIV -infected individuals who cannot 
achieve optimal LDL -C despite the use of maximally tolerated statin therapy or who are 
intolerant to statin or for whom statin is contraindicated. Therefore, understanding the 
safety and efficacy of evolocumab in patients with HIV is important. 
For further details on evolocumab efficacy  and safety results refer to the Evolocumab 
Investigator’s Brochure. 
2.4 Clinical Hypotheses 
Subcutaneous  evolocumab QM will be well tolerated and will result in greater reduction 
of LDL-C, defined as percent change from baseline at week 24, compared with placebo 
QM in HIV-positive subjects with hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia. 
3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design 
This is a  phase 3b, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study with 
an open-label  extension  period designed to assess the efficacy and safety of 
evolocumab in HIV -positive subjects with hyperlipidemia and/or  mixed dyslipidemia. 
Treatment with baselin e HIV and lipid-lowering (if applicable) medications being taken at 
randomization will continue throughout the clinical study . The study consists of 
3 periods: 
• Screening (to ensure tolerance of SC injections, includes a placebo injection)  
• Double-blind treatment period 
• Open-label  extension period 
Subjects will undergo screening procedures, including laboratory assessments and a 
screening placebo injection, before being randomized 2:1 into the following treatment 
groups  for the double-blind treatment period: 
• SC evolocumab 420 mg QM  
• SC placebo QM  
The overall sample size will be approximately 450 subjects , with approximately 
300 subjects in the evolocumab group. Randomization will be stratified by entry statin 
treatment (yes/no) and by hepatitis C status (yes/no). The size of the subgroup not on 
statin therapy is expected to be approximately 10% and no more than 20%  of the 
CONFIDENTIAL    
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20130286  
Date:  30 January 2017 Page 18 of 73 
subjects. This enrollment projection is expected to be reflective of clinical 
practice.  
The double- blind period will be 24 weeks , after which subjects who received a dose of 
investigational product ( IP) at week 20 will continue in an open-label  period during which 
all subjects  will be treated with QM evolocumab . The open-label period will continue  up 
through the end of study (EOS) visit at w eek 52.  
SC evolocumab and placebo will be administered QM at the study site or appropriate 
non-investigator site settings (eg, at the subject’s home) by automated mini -doser (AMD ; 
referred to in the United States as an “on-body infuser prefilled cartridge” ) or by  
spring-based prefilled autoinjector/pen (AI/pen). 
3.2 Number of Sites 
Approximately 75 sites globally will participate in this study.  Sites that do not enroll 
subjects within 3 months of site initiation may be closed.  
3.3 Number of Subjects 
Approximately 450 subjects will be enrolled, with approximately 300 subjects in the 
evolocumab group. 
3.4 Replacement  of Subjects 
Subjects who are withdrawn or removed from treatment or the study will not be replaced. 3.5 Estimated Study Duration 
3.5.1 Study Duration for Subjects 
Including the screening, study treatment (double-blind treatment and open-label ), and 
follow -up, the maximal total duration of study participation for a subject will be 56 weeks . 
After signing the informed consent, subjects should be randomized after 4 weeks 
(± 1 week) of screening.  
3.5.2 End of Study  
The primary c ompletion is defined as the date when the l ast subject has completed 
assessments for week 24 . 
The end of trial is defined as  the time when the last subject has completed the 
assessments for week 52. 
4. SUBJECT ELIGIBILITY  
Investigators will be expected to maintain a screening log of all potential study 
candidates that includes limited information about the potential candidate (eg, date of

210 Female subject of childbearing potential not willing to use acceptable method(s) 
of effective birth control duri ng treatment with IP  and for an additional 15 weeks 
after the end of treatment with IP. Female subjects of non-childbearing potential 
are not required to use contraception during the study and include those who have had a hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or 
who are postmenopausal .  
 
Postmenopausal is defined as 12 months of spontaneous and continuous 
amenorrhea in a female ≥ 55 years old; or age < 55 years but no spontaneous 
menses for at least 2 years; or age < 55 years and spontaneous menses within 
the past 1 year, but currently amenorrheic (eg, spontaneous or secondary to hysterectomy) and with postmenopausal gonadotropin levels (luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone levels > 40 IU/L) or postmenopausal 
estradiol levels (< 5 ng/dL) or according to the definition of "postmenopausal 
range" for the laboratory involved  
 Acceptable methods of effective birth control include: 
− true sexual abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, postovulation methods ], declaration of abstinence for the 
duration of a trial, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception]),  
− surgical contraceptive methods (vasectomy or bilateral tubal 
ligation/occlusion),  
− use of hormonal birth control methods (oral, intravaginal, transdermal, injectable, or implantable),

barrier methods must include spermicide (males must use a condom; females 
must choose either a d iaphragm OR c ervical cap OR c ontraceptive sponge). 
If spermicide is not available in the country or region, the 2-barrier method 
without spermicide is acceptable.  
Note:  Additional medications given during treatment with evolocumab may alter 
the contraceptive requirements. These additional medications may require an increase in the number of contraceptive methods, the change in type of 
contraceptive methods and/or length of time that contraception is to be utilized or 
length of time breastfeeding is to be avoided. The investigator is to discuss these contraceptive changes with the study  subject.

217 History or evidence of any other clinically significant disorder, condition or disease (with the exception of those outlined above) that, in the opinion of the investigator or Amgen physician, if consulted, would pose a risk to subject safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures, or completion 
5. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
Before subjects begin participation in any study -specific activities/procedures, Amgen 
requires a copy of the site’s written institutional review board /independent ethics 
committee (IRB/IEC ) approval of the protocol, informed consent form (ICF) , and all other 
subject information and/or recruitment material, if applicable (see Section 11.2). All 
subjects must personally sign and date the ICF  before commencement of study specific 
activities/procedures.  
A subject is considered enrolled upon randomization. The investigator is to document 
this decision and date, in the subject’s medical record and in the enrollment case report 
form ( CRF). 
Each subject who enter s into the screening period for the study ( defined as the point at 
which the subject signs the ICF ) receive s a unique subject identification number before 
any study -related activities /procedures are performed. The subject identification number 
will be assigned via IVRS/I WRS. This number will be used to identify the subject 
throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study documentation related to that 
subject. 
Subjects who are unable to complete or meet eligibility on initial screening will be 
permitted to re-screen, except for subjects who do not meet inclusion criterion 107 
(see Section  7.2.2). 
CONFIDENTIAL    
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20130286  
Date:  30 January 2017 Page 23 of 73 
The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical 
study; it must not be changed after initial assignment, including if a subject is rescreened. This number will not necessarily be the same as the randomization number 
assigned for the study. 
5.1 Randomization/Treatment Assignment 
Subjects who tolerate the placebo injection, complete all screening procedures, and 
successfully meet all eligibility criteria at the end of screening will be randomized via IVRS/IWRS  and will return to the study site for day 1 procedures while continuing their 
background HIV and lipid-lowering treatment (if applicable).  
Subjects will be randomized in 2 :1 ratio to 2 treatment groups (evolocumab and placebo, 
respectively ) in a double -blind manner . The randomization will be stratified by entry 
statin treatment and hepatitis C status.  
Subjects can only be randomized 1 time for this study . The randomization date (study 
day 1) is to be documented in the subject’s medical record and on the enrollment CRF. 
Randomization numbers will be provided to the site through an  IVRS/IWRS.  
5.2 Site Personnel Access to Individual Treatment Assignments 
A subject’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the 
treatment is essential for the further management of the subject on this study . Unblinding 
at the study site for any other reason will be considered a protocol deviation.  
Refer to the Investigational Product Instruction Manual (IPIM) for a description regarding 
how responsible pharmacists and investigators will access treatment information via the 
IVRS/IWR S, in the event that there is a need to break the blind.  
The investigator is strongly encouraged to contact the Amgen Clinical Study Manager before unblinding any subject’s treatment assignment, but must do so within 1 working 
day after the event. 
6. TREATMENT PROCEDURES  
6.1 Classification of Product(s) and/or Medical Device(s)  
The Amgen IP used in this study is  evolocumab and matching placebo. In several

The investigational medical device is the AMD, or  the spring based prefilled AI/pen. 
Note:  Ancillary device(s) (ie, any medical device[s] not under study) are described in 
Section 6.6. 
The IPIM, a document external to this protocol, contains detailed information regarding 
the storage, preparation, destruction, and administration of evolocumab and placebo. 
6.2 Investigational Product 
Evolocumab and matching placebo will be manufactured and packaged by Amgen Inc. and distributed using Amgen clinical study drug distribution procedures . 
Evolocumab 420 mg and placebo SC will be supplied as  an AMD or AI/pen: 
• An AMD as a single use, disposable, on-body electro-mechanical injection device 
that is co-packaged with a prefilled Crystal Zenith cartridge containing 3.5 mL 
deliverable volume of 120 mg/mL evolocumab or  an identical volume of placebo. 
• An AI/pen as a single use, disposable, handheld mechanical (spring-based) for fixed 
dose, SC injection of 140 mg evolocumab in 1.0 mL deliverable volume or an 
identical volume of placebo. 
Placebo will be presented in identical containers and stored/packaged the same as 
evolocumab. 
6.2.1 Dosage, Administration, and Schedule 
6.2.1.1 Screening 
During screening, subjects will undergo SC placebo injection with the device to be us ed 
during the study (AMD or AI/pen). Subjects must tolerate the placebo injection prior to 
randomization. 
6.2.1.2 Double-blind Treatment Period 
The IP (420 mg evolocumab or matching placebo via AMD , or AI/pen) will be 
administered QM on day  1, week 4, week 8, week 12, week  16, and week  20.  
SC evolocumab and placebo will be administered at the study site or in an appropriate 
non-clinic setting (eg, at the subject’s home). Observed, in-clinic dosing should occur at 
day 1 and w eek 20. Subjects who do not wish to self-inject at home may return to the 
clinic for injection. See Table 3  for the schedule of in-clinic visits. 
The IP will be administered SC in accordance with instructions in the IPIM and the 
Information for Use (IFU). The subject (or designee, if not a qualified healthcare 
profess ional) must have demonstrated competency, as per site judgment, at 
administration of SC injections before self-administration is permitted:  the first

Date:  30 January 2017 Page 25 of 73 
self-administered dose by the subject (or designee, if not a healthcare professional) 
must be administered at the site under the supervision of a healthcare provider . If IP is to 
be administered during the study visit, administration must occur after all other 
procedures have been completed. 
When IP is mandated to be administered at the study site, the date and time of 
administration, the body location of the injection, and whether the injection was administered fully, partially, or not at all, in addition to the reason for a partial/lack of 
injection, are to be provided. When IP can be administered at an appropriate non-clinic 
setting (eg, at the subject’s home), at a minimum, the dates the devices were dispensed 
and returned, the number of devices dispensed and returned, and number of devices administered fully, partially, or not at all, in addition to the reason for a partial/lack of injection, must be provided. 
When IP is mandated to be administered at the study site, the date and completion time 
of administration, the body location of the injection, and whether the injection was administered fully, or partially, or not at all administered, in addition to the reason for a partial/lack of injection, are to be recorded on each subject’s CRF provided. When IP 
can be administered at an appropriate non-clinic setting (eg, at the subject’s  home), a 
non-investigator  site location, at a minimum, the dates  that the devices were dispensed 
and the used devices were returned, the number of devices dispensed and returned, 
and number of devices administered fully, partially, or not at all, in addition to the reason for a partial/lack of injection, must be provided whether each device was returned fully or 
partially used are to be recorded on each subject’s CRF. 
Overdose with this product has not been reported. 6.2.1.3 Open-l abel Period 
Subjects who receive a dose of IP at week  20 will continue in an open-label period. 
During the open-label period, all subjects will be treated with 420 mg evolocumab via 
AMD, or AI/ pen. Dosing at week  24 is expected to be in-clinic while dosing for week s 28, 
32, 36, 40, 44, and 48 is expected to be in an appropriate non -clinic setting (eg, at the 
subject’s home , even on weeks with in-clinic visits); however, s ubjects who do not 
wish to self-inject at home may return to the clinic for injection.

6.2.2 Dosage Adjustments, Delays, Rules for Withholding or Restar ting, 
Permanent Discontinuation  
No dose adjustments are allowed in this study . If, in the opinion of the investigator, a 
subject is unable to tolerate a specific dose of IP, that subject will discontinue IP but will 
continue to return for all other study procedures and measurements until the EOS  visit. 
If a dose of evolocumab is missed, administration should occur as soon as possible if 
there are > 7 days until the next scheduled dose . If there are less than 7 days before the 
next scheduled dose, the missed dose should be omitted and the next dose should be 
administered according to the original schedule.  
6.3 Hepatotoxicity Stopping and Rechallenge Rules 
Subjects with abnormal hepatic laboratory values ( ie, alkaline  phosphatase [ALP], AST, 
ALT, total bilirubin [TBL]) and/or international normalized ratio (INR)  and/or 
signs/symptoms of hepatitis (as described below) may meet the criteria for withholding 
or permanent discontinuation of Amgen IP or other protocol -required therapies  as 
specified in the Guidance for Industry Drug-Induced Liver Injury  (DILI): Pr emarketing 
Clinical Evaluation ( July 2009). 
6.3.1 Criteria for Withh olding and/or Permanent Discontinuation of Amgen 
Investigational Product and Other Protocol-required Therapies Due 
to Potential Hepatotoxicity  
The following stopping and/or withholding rules (Table 1 ) apply to subjects for 
whom another cause of their changes in liver biomarkers (TBL, INR and 
transaminases) has not been identified.  
Important alternative causes for elevated AST/ALT and/or TBL values include, but 
are not limited to:  
• Hepatobiliary tract disease 
• Viral hepatitis (eg, Hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, Eps tein-Barr v irus, cytomegalovirus, 
herpes simplex virus, varicella, toxoplasmosis, and Parvo virus ) 
• Right-sided heart failure, hypotension or any cause of hypoxia to the liver 
causing ischemi a  
• Exposure to hepatotoxic agents/drugs or  hepatotoxins , including herbal and 
dietary supplements, plants , and mushrooms   
• Heritable disorders causing impaired glucuronidation (eg , Gilbert’s s yndrome, 
Crigler-Najjar syndrome) and drugs that inhibit bilirubin glucuronidation (eg, indinavir, atazanavir)

7.2 General Study Procedures  
The procedures performed at each study visit are outlined Table 3 . Details regarding 
each type of procedure are provided in subsequent subsections.  
Before each study visit where fasting lipid samples are obtained, subjects must be 
fasting overnight. If the subject is not fasting for the screening or the day 1 visit, no visit 
procedures are to be performed, and the visit should be rescheduled within the applicable protocol windows. If subject is not fasting after day 1, all procedures except fasting labs and IP administration, if applicable, will be performed and another visit 
should be scheduled, within the visit window if possible, for sampling for fasting labs and 
IP administration.  
For each study visit when IP is administered at the site, administration must be after 
completion of blood draw procedures, if applicable. 
Subjects will be encouraged to complete all planned visits regardless of their adherence 
to IP administration.  
Refer to the applicable supplemental central laboratory, IVRS/IWRS, IPIM, and study manuals for detailed collection and handling pr ocedures.  
7.2.1 Screening Enrollment and Randomization 
Subjects who are considered for entry into the study and have the risk and benefits of participating in the study explained will enter screening by signing and dating the ICF  for 
this study . Informed consent must be obtained before completing any other screening 
procedure. 
After the subject sign s the written informed consent, the site will screen the subject in 
order to assess eligibility for participation. Screening should be completed and the 
subject randomized or screen failed after 4 weeks (±  1 week) of signing the informed 
consent. 
Subjects will undergo SC placebo injection with device anticipated to be used during 
study (AMD or AI/pen) during screening.  
Subjects who tolerate the screening placebo injection, complete all screening 
procedures successfully , and meet all eligibility criteria at the end of screening will be 
randomized via IVRS/IWRS and will return to the study site for day 1 procedures while 
continuing their background HIV and lipid-lowering (if applicable) treatment. Subjects 
CONFIDENTIAL    
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20130286  
Date:  30 January 2017 Page 36 of 73 
should be randomized before or on the date of the day 1 visit, and initiate their first dose 
of IP within 5 days of randomization. 
7.2.2 Rescreening 
Subjects who do not meet inclusion criterion 107 are considered screen failures and 
cannot be rescreened for this study. Suitable subjects who are ineligible at the initial 
screening for other reasons and have not been randomized can be reconsented and 
rescreened at a later time, unless they withdraw from screening, provided the study is still enrollin g subjects.  
For subjects who are rescreened, data from the first screening period will not be used for 
the analysis . Rescreened subjects who are reconsented will repeat all screening 
procedures. Rescreened subjects will maintain the or iginally assigned subject 
identification number. 
7.2.3 Double-b lind Treatment Period 
Visits will occur per the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3 ) during the double-blind 
period from day  1 (week 1, baseline) through week 24. Visits during the treatment period 
must be completed within ±  3 days of the target visit date. For visits with IP 
administration at the study site, administration should be the last procedure to be 
performed during each visit.  
If a subject withdraws from the study early, all efforts should be made to complete and 
report the observations as thoroughly as possible up to the date of withdrawal . If 
possible, the procedures of the week 24 visit should be completed at the time of 
withdrawal. 
7.2.4 Open-l abel Period 
Subjects who receive a dose of IP at week  20 will continue in an open-label period. They 
will receive their first dose of open-label IP at the week 24 visit. Visits will then 
occur per the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3 ) at weeks  36 and 52. Visits during the 
open-label period must be completed within ±  7 days of the target visit date.  
7.2.5 End of Study / Safety Follow -up 
At week 52 or 30 days after the last administration of IP, whichever is later, a safety 
follow -up is scheduled to occur . This safety follow -up can be an in-person visit to the 
study center or another contact with the subject. If the end-of -study visit is < 30 days 
after the last dose of IP, the subject will be contacted (eg, by phone) at 
30 (± 7) days after last IP for safety follow -up.

7.3 Description of Study Procedures 
The sections below provide a description of the individual study procedures. 
7.3.1 Informed Consent 
All subjects must sign and personally date the IRB/IEC approved informed consent 
before any study specific procedures are performed. 
7.3.2 Demographics 
Demographic data collection including sex, age, race, and ethnicity will be collected in 
order to study their possible association with subject safety and treatment effectiveness . 
Additionally demographic  data will be used to study the impact on biomarkers variability 
of the protocol -required therapies.  
7.3.3 Medical History  
The investigator or designee will collect a complete medical history covering the period within 120 days prior to randomization. Additional ly, a targeted cardiovascular and HIV 
history not limited to 120 days prior to randomization will be collected. Targeted cardiovascular history including, but not limited to, cardiovascular risk factors, history of 
CVD, revascularization procedures, family  history, and potential familial 
hypercholesterolemia diagnostic criteria will be collected. Targeted HIV history including, 
but not limited to, duration, HIV complications, and occurrence of opportunistic infections 
or AIDS-defining illness from diagnosis  will be collected.  
7.3.4 Vital Signs 
The following measurements must be performed:  blood pressure and heart rate. The 
subject must be in a seated position in a rested and calm state for at least 5 minutes 
before blood pressure assessments are conducted. The appropriate size cuff should be 
used. The same arm and same position should be used throughout the study and 
documented on the vital sign CRF. 
During screening, blood pressure measurements can be repeated if the previous reading 
was outside of the eligibility range. The repeat blood pressure measurement  should be 
taken at least 2 minutes after  the previous one. 
7.3.5 Safety Data Reporting  
Adverse events, serious adverse events, disease -related events, and adverse device 
effects observed by the investigator or reported by the subject will be collected at all 
study visits from randomization through EOS  as detailed in Section 9. Adverse events 
CONFIDENTIAL    
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20130286  
Date:  30 January 2017 Page 38 of 73 
possibly related to study procedures, adverse device effects and serious adverse 
events are collected during screening. 
7.3.6 Prior Therapies, Substance Use History, and Concomitant 
Medications 
Prior ge neral and targeted therapies (eg, statins and HIV therapy) taken within 120 days 
prior to randomization should be collected with the following information:  therapy name, 
indication, dose, unit, frequency, route, start date, and stop date. 
If a targeted therapy is begun, discontinued, or changed during study, in addition to 
updates for the above information, the reason for adjusting medication (adverse event, worsening of underlying condition, noncompliance etc.) should be recorded. 
Concomitant therapies are to be collected from the signing of the informed consent 
through the EOS, and should include the therapy name, indication, dose, unit, 
frequency, route, start date, and stop date. Concomitant medications include over-the-counter products and vitamins administered while the subject is on study. 
7.3.7 Physical Examination 
A physical examination will be conducted as per standard of care. Physical exami nation 
findings should be recorded on the appropriate CRF (eg, height, weight, BMI, etc.) 
7.3.8 Body  Weight, Waist Circumference, and Height 
Body weight in kilograms and height in centimeters should be measured without shoes. For measurement of waist circumference, subjects should wear minimal clothing to 
ensure that the measuring tape is correctly positioned. Subjects should stand erect with 
the abdomen relaxed, arms at the sides, feet together and with their weight equally 
divided over both legs . To perform the waist measurement, the lowest rib margin is first 
located and marked with a pen. The iliac crest is then palpated in the midaxillary line. It 
is recommended to apply an elastic tape horizontally midway between the lowest rib margin and the iliac crest, and tie firmly so that it stays in position around the abdomen about the level of the umbilicus . The elastic tape thus defines the level of the waist 
circumference, which can then be measured by positioning the measuring tape over the 
elastic tape. Subjects are asked to breathe normally, and to breathe out gently at the 
time of the measurement to prevent them from contracting their muscles or from holding 
their breath. Measurements should be performed using the same procedure throughout 
the study . The reading is taken to the nearest centimeter or half an inch and entered in 
the source document.

All laboratory samples will be sent to the central laboratory, except for samples for 
urine pregnancy tests, which will be conducted by the local laboratory . 
Concentration values are provided in mmol/L for investigator convenience. Conventional concentrations (mg/mL) will be used for the protocol, including for eligibility 
determination. The estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) will be calculated by the 
central laboratory and provided to the site for eligibility determination. 
The central laboratory will provide a study manual that outlines handling, labeling, and 
shipping procedures for all samples.  
All blood samples will be obtained by venipuncture before IP administration. The date and time of sample collection will be recorded in the source documents at the site. Specific analytes for serum chemistry, urinalysis, hematology, and other labs to be conducted on blood and urine samples are shown in Table 4 . Although not specifically 
listed, additional components, abnormal, and/or atypical cells will also be reported if 
present.

7.4.1 Blinding of Laboratory Test Results 
In order to protect the blinding of the double-blind treatment period, the following labs will 
be blinded postscreening until unblinding of the clinical database and not reported to sites except as noted below: 
• Blinded to the Amgen study team and site staff:  lipid panel, ApoA1, A
 poB, Lp(a), 
and 
• Blinded to the s
ite staff:  insulin,  
. Analyses
 
of  may not be completed until EOS  so 
results are not expected to be available during the trial.

Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20130286  
Date:  30 January 2017 Page 41 of 73 
In addition, i nvestigators should not perform non-protocol testing of these analytes 
during a subject’s study participation and until at least 12 weeks after the  first dose of 
unblinded evolocumab at week 24 (ie, week 36 vis it).  
The following central laboratory results during open-label period will be reported to the 
sites for the week 36 through week 52 visits:  lipid  panel, ApoA1, ApoB, Lp(a).  
7.4.2 Pregnancy Test s 
All females, except those who are confirmed surgically sterile or at least 2 years 
postmenopausal  or 1 year postmenopausal if ≥ 55 years old, must have a negative 
serum pregnancy test at screening, prior to administering the first dose of 
evolocumab/placebo. The central laboratory will provide the screening pregnancy tests.  
Urine pregnancy tests will be performed on day 1 and on  weeks 12, 20, 24, and 36 
before IP administration and at EOS.  
Additional on-treatment pregnancy testing may be performed at the investigator’s 
discretion or as required by local laws and regulations.  
7.5 Antibody Testing Procedures 
Blood sample(s) for antibody testing are to be collected at the time points shown in Table 3  for the measurement of anti -evolocumab binding antibodies . Samples testing 
positive for binding antibodies will also be tested for neutralizing antibodies and may be further characterized for quantity/titer, isotype, affinity and presence of immune complexes. Additional blood samples may be obtained to rule out anti -evolocumab 
antibodies during the study.  
7.6 Biomarker Development  
Biomarkers are objectively measured and evaluated indicators of normal biologic processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention. Biomarker development can be useful in developing markers to identify 
disease subtypes, guide therapy, and/or predict disease severity . Amgen may attempt to 
develop test(s) designed to identify subjects most likely to respond positively or negatively to evolocumab. 
Blood samples are to be collected for  biomarker development at d ay 1, week 12, 
week  24, and week 52. Refer to the laboratory manual for detailed collection and 
handling procedures for all biomarker development samples.

Biomarkers related to, but not limited to,  
 
 
 may be 
studied. 
7.7 Pharm
acogenetic Studies
 
No additional blood will be collected for the pharmacogenetic  analyses. If the subject 
consents to the optional  pharmacogenetic portion of this study, deoxyribonucleic acid 
(DNA) analyses may be performed. These optional pharmacogenetic analyses focus on 
inherited genetic variations to evaluate their possible correlation to the disease and/or 
responsiveness to the therapies used in this study . The goals of the optional studies 
include the use of genetic markers to help in the investigation of cardiovascular disease, 
hyperlipidemia and other metabolic disorders and/or to identify subjects who may have positive or negative response to evolocumab. 
7.8 Sample Storage and Destruction  
Any blood sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 3 ) can be 
analyzed for any of the tests outlined in the protocol and for any tests necessary to 
minimize risks to study subjects . This includes testing to ensure analytical methods 
produce reliable and valid data throughout the course of the study . This can also include, 
but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample reanalysis, and 
analyses for method transfer and comparability.  
All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for 
analysis or storage. Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is assigned to 
the samples for the study . Results are stored in a secure database to ensure 
confidential ity. 
If informed consent is provided by the subject, Amgen can do additional testing on 
remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) to investigate and better understand the  
underlying inflammatory conditions , the dose response and/or prediction of respons e to 
evolocumab , and characterize aspects of the molecule (eg, mechanism of action/target, 
metabolites). Results from this analysis are to be documented and maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part of this study . Sampl es can be retained for up to 
20 years.  
CONFIDENTIAL

Since the evaluations are not expected to benefit the subject directly or to alter the 
treatment course, the results of pharmacogenetic , biomarker development, or other 
exploratory studies  are not placed in the subject’s medical record and are not to be 
made available to the subject, members of the family, the personal physician, or other third parties , except as specified in the informed consent.  
The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by contacting the investigator. Following the request from the subject, the i nvestigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining blood samples and any other components from the cells can be located and destroyed. 
Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are completed. 
However, information collected from samples prior to the request for destruction, will be retained by Amgen.  
The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the request of the subject through the i nvestigator , at the end of the storage period, or as 
appropriate (eg, the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type no 
longer justifies keeping the sample) . If a commercial product is developed from this 
research project, the sponsor owns the commercial product. The subject has no 
commercial rights to such product and has no commercial rights to the data, information, 
discoveries, or derivative materials gained or produced from the sample. See 
Section 11.3 for subject confidentiality.  
8. WITHDRAWAL FROM TREATMENT, PROCEDURES, AND STUDY  
8.1 Subject s’ Decision to Withdraw  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason 
without prejudice to their  future medical care by the physician or at the institution.  
Subjects (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving IP 
and/or other protocol -required therapies or procedures at any time during the study  but 
continue participation in the study . If this occurs, the investigator is to discuss with the 
subject the appropriate processes for discontinuation from IP or other protocol -required 
therapies and must discuss with the subject the options for continuation of the S chedule 
of Assess ments  (Table 3 ) and collection of data, including endpoints and adverse 
events. T he investigator  must document the change to the Schedule of Assessments  
(Table 3 ) and the level of follow -up that is agreed to by the subject ( eg, in person, by 
CONFIDENTIAL

Date:  30 January 2017 Page 44 of 73 
telephone/mail, through family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other 
physicians, from review of the medical records ).  
Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive 
further protocol -required therapies or procedures , and the subject does not wish to or is 
unable to continue further study participation. Subject data up to withdrawal of consent 
will be included in the analysis of the study , and where permitted, publicly available data 
can be included after withdrawal of consent. The investigator is to discuss with the 
subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study.  
8.2 Investigator or Sponsor Decision to Withdraw  or Terminate 
Subjects’ Participation Prior to Study Completion 
The investigator and/or sponsor can decide to withdraw a subject(s) from IP and/or other 
protocol-required therapies, protocol procedures , or the study as a whole at any time 
prior to study completion.  
Subjects may be eligible for continued treatment with Amgen IP and/or other 
protocol -required therapies by a separate protocol or as provided for by the local 
country’s regulatory mechanism, based on parameters consistent with Section 12.1.  
8.3 Reasons for Removal From Treatment or Study  
8.3.1 Reasons for Removal From Treatment 
Reasons  for removal from protocol -required IP  or procedural assessments include any 
of the following: 
• subject request  
• subject request to end IP administration 
• safety concern (eg, due to an adverse event, pregnancy in a female subject)   
• death 
• lost to follow -up  
• administrative decision by Amgen (other than subject request, safety concern, or lost 
to follow -up) 
• decision by the primary investigator/physician  
8.3.2 Reasons for Removal From Study  
Reasons for removal of a subject from the study  are: 
• decision by Amgen  
• withdrawal of consent from study  
• death

9. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING  
9.1 Definition of Safety Events 
9.1.1 Disease-r elated Events 
Disease-related events are events (serious or non-serious) anticipated to occur in the 
study population due to the underlying disease. In this study, subjects are at risk for or 
are known to have cardiovascular disease. Therefore, disease-related events potentially 
include manifestations and complications of atherosclerotic vascular disease such as coronary artery disease, angina, MI , ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, carotid 
artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and testing suggesting progression of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Such events do not meet the definition of an adverse 
event unless assessed to be more severe than expected for the subject’s condition.  
Disease-related events and/or disease related outcomes that do not qualify as adverse events or serious adverse events:  
• An event which is part of the normal course of disease under study (eg, disease 
progression i n oncology or hospitalization due to disease progression) is to be 
reported as a disease-related event.  
• Death due to the disease under study is to be recorded on the Event CRF.  
A disease-related event that would qualify as an adverse event or serious adverse 
event is an event based on the underlying disease that is worse than expected as 
assessed by the investigator for the subject’s condition or an event for which the investigator believes there is a causal relationship between the investigational 
product(s)/study treatment/protocol required therapies and disease worsening. This must be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event. 
9.1.2 Adverse Events 
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial 
subject. The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment. 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any adverse events observed by the 
investigator or reported by the subject are recorded in the subject’s medical record.  
The definition of adverse events includes  worsening of a pre-existing medical condition. 
Worsening indicates that the pre-existing medical condition or underlying disease 
(eg, diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or 
duration more  than would be expected, and/or has an association with a significantly 
worse outcome than expected. A pre -existing condition that has not worsened more than 
anticipated (ie, more than usual fluctuation of disease) during the study or involves an 
CONFIDENTIAL    
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20130286  
Date:  30 January 2017 Page 46 of 73 
intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study , is 
not considered an adverse event.  
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event. In the event a subject, or subject’s 
legally acceptable representative requests to withdraw from protocol -required therapies  
or the study due to an adverse event, refer to Section 8.1 for additional instructions on 
the procedures recommended for safe withdrawal from protocol -required therapies or 
the study .  
The criteria for grade 4 in the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events  (CTCAE) grading scale differs from the regulatory criteria for serious adverse 
events. It is left to the Investigator’s judgment to report these grade 4 abnormalities as 
serious adverse events. 
9.1.2.1 Worsening of HIV Disease 
HIV worsening will be captured as an adverse event. Because evolocumab is not 
expected to have any interaction with antiretroviral therapy or viral load or 
consequences of HIV infection, no specific actions with respect to study participation (including investigational product) are expected of the investigator. Should a subject’s viral load change or HIV infection worsen, the investigator is 
expected to manage HIV infection or any other concomitant illnesses per his or 
her clinical judgment. Background lipid-lowering therapy is expected to be stable. However, in the case of HIV worsening, because of potential drug– drug interaction 
between statins and antiretroviral therapy, changing background lipid-lowering 
therapy is left to the judgment of the investigator. 
9.1.3 Adverse Device Effects 
An adverse device effect is any adverse event related to the use of a medical device. 
Adverse device effects include adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use, adverse events resulting from any malfunction of the device, or adverse events resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the device.

Protocol Number:  20130286  
Date:  30 January 2017 Page 47 of 73 
9.1.4 Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of the 
following serious criteria (unless it meets the definition of a disease-related event 
provided in Section 9.1.1): 
• fatal 
• life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)  
• requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other medically important serious event  
A disease-related event is to be reported as a serious adverse event if: 
• the subject’s pre-existing condition becomes worse than what the investigator would 
consider typical for a patient with the same underlying condition, or  
•  if the investigator believes a causal relationship exists between the 
IMP/protocol -required therapies  and the event,  
• and the event meets at least 1 of the serious criteria above. 
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization, ” if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay) .  
If an i nvestigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the 
criterion of “other medically important serious event.” Examples of such events could 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, DILI (see Appendix  A for 
drug-induced liver injury reporting criteria), or events that necessitate an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention. 
9.2 Safety Event Reporting Procedures  
9.2.1 Reporting Procedures for Disease-r elated Events 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all disease-related events observed by 
the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after randomization through 
EOS /safety follow -up visit, or 30 days after the last administration of IP, whichever is 
later,  are reported on the Event CRF as disease related.  
Disease-related events assessed by the investigator to be more severe than expected and/or related to the investigational medicinal product(s)/study treatment/protocol-required therapies and determined to be serious must be recorded on the event CRF as serious adverse events. Additionally, the 
CONFIDENTIAL    
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20130286  
Date:  30 January 2017 Page 48 of 73 
investigator is required to report a fatal disease-related event on the Event CRF as 
a disease-related event . 
9.2.2 Adverse Events 
9.2.2.1 Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events That Do Not Meet Serious 
Criteria  
Adverse events possibly  related to study procedures, adverse device effects and 
serious adverse events are reported from signing of the ICF. All other adverse 
events are reported from the time of randomization. The investigator is responsible 
for ensuring that all adverse events observed by the i nvestigator or reported by the 
subject that occur from signing of the ICF or from the time of  randomization through 
the EOS /safety follow -up, or 30 days after the last administration of IP, whichever is 
later, are reported using the event CRF.  Only adverse events possibly related to study 
procedures are to be collected during screening. 
The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  
• Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms), 
• Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved), 
• Severity,  
• Assessment of relatedness to IP, the AMD (or A I/pen), or other protocol -required 
therapies, and 
• Action taken. 
The adverse event grading scale used will be the CTCAE . The grading scale used in this 
study is described in Appendix  A. 
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to the IP, the 
AMD (or AI/pen), or other protocol -required therapies . This relationship is indicated by a 
“yes” or “no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event 
may have been caused by the IP, the AMD (or A I/pen), or other protocol -required 
therapies ?” Relatedness means that there are facts or reasons to support a 
relationship between investigational product and the event. 
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to any 
study -mandated activity (eg, administration of IP , protocol -required therapies, device[s] 
and/or procedure [including any screening procedure(s)]) . This relationship is indicated 
by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the 
event may have been caused by a study activity (eg, administration of investigational 
product, protocol -requir ed therapies, device[s]), and/or procedure?”  Relatedness 
CONFIDENTIAL    
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20130286  
Date:  30 January 2017 Page 49 of 73 
means that there are facts or reasons to support a relationship between 
investigational product and the event. 
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values . In general, abnormal laboratory 
findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be 
recorded as adverse events . However, laboratory value changes that require treatment 
or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events . Where applicable, 
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse event. 
The investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or 
reversibility. 
9.2.2.2 Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by 
the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after signing of informed consent 
through EOS/safety follow -up visit, or 30 days after the last administration of IP, 
whichever is later  are recorded in the subject’s medical record and are submitted to 
Amgen. All serious adverse events must be submitted to Amgen within 24 hours 
following the investigator’s knowledge of the event via the Event CRF.  
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to 
any study -mandated activity or procedure. This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have 
been caused by a study activity/procedure?”  
The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events until stabilization 
or reversibility.  
New information relating to a previously reported serious adverse event must be 
submitted to Amgen. All new information for serious adverse events must be sent to 
Amgen within 24 hours following knowledge of the new information. The investigator 
may be asked to provide additional follow -up information, which may include a discharge 
summar ies, medical records,  or extracts from the medical record. Information provided 
about the serious adverse event must be consistent with that recorded on the Event 
CRF.  
CONFIDENTIAL    
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20130286  
Date:  30 January 2017 Page 50 of 73 
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapies because of a 
serious adverse event, this information must be submitted to Amgen.  
To comply with worldwide reporting regulations for serious adverse events, the treatment 
assignment of subjects who develop serious, unexpected, and related adverse events 
may be unblinded by Amgen before submission to regulatory authorities. Investigators will receive notification of related serious adverse events reports sent to regulatory authorities in accordance with local requirements.  
Amgen will report serious adverse events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions as required to regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and IRBs/IECs in compliance with all reporting requirements according to local regulations and GCP .  
The investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB/IEC of serious adverse events occurring at the site and other adverse event reports received from Amgen, in accordance with 
local procedures and statutes.  
If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site staff to report the 
serious adverse event, the information is to be reported to Amgen via an electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event. See Appendix  B for a sample of the Serious Adverse Event 
Worksheet /electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form . For EDC 
studies where the first notification of a Serious Adverse Event is reported to Amgen via 
the Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form, the data must be entered into the EDC system when the system is again available. 
In addition to the attributes listed in Section 9.2.2.1, the investigator must also complete 
the serious adverse event section of the Event CRF. 
9.2.2.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events After the Protocol-required 
Reporting Period 
There is no requirement to monitor study subjects for serious adverse events following 
the protocol -required reporting period or after EOS. However, these serious adverse 
events can be reported to Amgen. In some countries (eg, European Union [EU] member 
states), investigators are required to report serious adverse events that they become 
aware of after EOS . If serious adverse events are reported, the investigator is to report 
them to Amgen within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event. 
CONFIDENTIAL    
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20130286

Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol -required reporting period will be 
captured within the safety database as clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited 
reporting.  
9.2.2.4 Serious Adverse Events That are not to be Reported in an Expedited 
Manner  
Hospitalizations due to chronic  HIV complications are anticipated to possibly occur in the 
enrolled subject population.  
The Amgen Safety Analysis team and medical team will review accumulating events on 
a regular basis.  
9.3 Pregnancy and Lactation Reporting 
If a pregnancy occurs in a female subject, or a male subject  fathers a child,  while the 
subject is taking evolocumab/placebo, report the pregnancy to Amgen Global Patient 
Safety as specified below. 
In addition to reporting any pregnancies occurring during the study, investigators should 
monitor for pregnancies that occur after the last dose of protocol -required therapies 
through 15 weeks after the end of treatment with evolocumab/placebo. 
The pregnancy should be reported to Amgen Global Patient Safety  within 24 hours of 
the investigator’s  knowledge of the event of a pregnancy . Report a pregnancy on the 
Pregnancy Notification Worksheet ( Appendix  C). Amgen Global Patient Safety will 
follow -up with the investigator regarding additional information that may be requested.  
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study, the investigator should attempt to obtain information regarding the birth outcome and health of the infant. 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets a criterion for immediate classification as a 
serious adverse event (eg, female subject experiences a spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or neonatal death or there is a fetal or neonatal congenital anomaly), the investigator will report the event as a serious adverse event. 
If a lactation case occurs while the female subject is taking protocol -required therapies 
report the lactation case to Amgen Global Patient Safety  as specified below.  
In addition to reporting a lactation case during the study, investigators should report  
lactation cases that occur after the last dose of protocol -required therapies through 
15 weeks after the end of treatment with evolocumab/placebo. 
CONFIDENTIAL

the investigator’s knowledge of event. Report a lactation case on the Lactation 
Notification Worksheet (Appendix  C). Amgen Global Patient Safety will follow-up with the 
investigator regarding additional information that may be requested.  
If a male subject's female partner becomes pregnant, the investigator should 
discuss obtaining information regarding the birth outcome and health of the infant from the pregnant partner.

10.1.2.2 Open-l abel Period 
The long-term analysis set (LAS) will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
open-label IP in the open-label  period. This analysis set will be used in all analyses for 
the open-label period. 
10.1.3 Covariates and Subgroups 
 Baseline covariates include, but are not 
limited to: 
• Stratification  factors in Double-blind Treatment Period: 
− Statin use at baseline (yes/no)  
− Hepatitis C status (yes/no) 
• Age :  <65 year, ≥  65 years  
• Sex 
• Race  
• Study baseline LDL -C:  <median/≥median 
• Family history of premature coronary heart disease (yes/no) 
•  
10.2 Sample Size Considerations 
The planned sample size for the comparison between evolocumab 420 mg QM and 
placebo at a ratio of 2:1 in the double -blind treatment period is 450 total subjects.  
The primary analysis will require the 2-sided tests of the primary endpoint to be 
significant at a level of 0.05. The planned sample size should provide adequate power 
to determine the superiority of evolocumab 420 mg QM rel ative to placebo as 
measured by the primary endpoint. From  the integrated efficacy analysis  of completed 
phase 3 studies , the treatment effect of evolocumab 420 mg QM compared to placebo 
and the corresponding 95% confidence interval at week 12 was -61.98% [-69.51%, 
-60.45%], with treatment effect ranges between -55.1%  and -62.33% from 
Studies  20110114, 20110115, and 20110117. The assumed treatment effect between 
the primary endpoint in evolocumab 420 mg QM is 40%, with a common standard 
deviation (SD) of 20%. This SD assumption is based on evolocumab phase 3 results. 
This sample size will provide approximately 99% power for the primary endpoint in 
testing the superiority of evolocumab dose regimen over placebo, assuming a dropout rate of 10%.  
In addition, 300 subjects in evolocumab 420 mg QM group  wil
 l provide approximately 
95% probability of detecti
ng adverse events that occur at a rate of 1%.

10.3 Access to Individual Subject Treatment Assignments by Amgen or 
Designees 
Blinded individuals will not have access to unblinded information until the study is 
formally unblinded. Unblinding and potentially unblinding information should not be 
distributed to the study team, investigators or subjects prior to the study being formally 
unblinded (eg, the formal unblinding may occur at the final analysis rather than during 
the primary analysis) except as specified (eg, Sect ion 5.2 and Section 9.2.2.2).  
10.4 Planned Analyses  
10.4.1 Primary  Analys is 
To evaluate efficacy and safety of 24 weeks of evolocumab 420 mg QM compared with 
placebo, the primary analysis will be performed when all randomized subjects in the 
double-blind treatment period have either completed all  the scheduled study visits in the 
double-blind treatment period or have early terminated from the study. At that time, the 
database related to the primary analyses of the study will be cleaned, processed and a 
snapshot will be taken; the study will also be unblinded.  
10.4.2 Final Analysis  
The final analysis will be conducted when all subjects in the open-label  period have 
either completed all the scheduled study visits in the open-label  period or have early 
terminated from the study. At that time, the database will be cleaned, processed and a snapshot will be taken. The final analysis will be done to evaluate long-term safety and efficacy of evolocumab 420 mg QM.  
10.5 Planned Methods of Analysis  
10.5.1 General Considerations 
Based on the snapshot for the primary analysis, efficacy and safety analyses will be 
performed on FAS for the double-blind treatment period unless otherwise specified, and 
data will be summarized by randomized treatment group. Based on the snapshot for the final analysis, long-term efficacy and safety analyses will be performed on LAS and the analyses will be descriptive. 
Subject disposition, demographics, baseline characteristics , and exposure to IP will be 
summarized by treatment group. Summary statistics for continuous variables will include 
the number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation or standard error, minimum, 
and maximum. For categorical variables, the frequency and percentage will be given. Methods of handling missing data for efficacy endpoints will be described below. Missing 
data will not be imputed for safety endpoints.

10.5.1.1 Multiplicity Adjustment Method  
Methods of adjusting for multiplicity due to multiple endpoints (primary and secondary 
efficacy endpoints) in order to preserve the familywise error rate at 0.05 are described in Figure 1 . 
Figure 1 .  Multiplicity Adjustment Methods  
 
The following method will  be used to preserve the family -wise error rate for the primary 
and secondary endpoints: 
1. If the treatment effect from the primary analysis of the primary endpoint is 
significant at a significance level of 0.05, statistical testing of the tier 1 secondary efficacy endpoints will follow the Hochberg procedure at a significance level of 
0.005 (Hochberg, 1988) 
2. If all tier 1 secondary efficacy endpoints are significant, the tier 2 secondary 
efficacy endpoints will be tested using the Hochberg procedure at a significance 
level of 0.05.  
3. If not all tier 1 secondary efficacy endpoints are significant, the tier 2 secondary 
efficacy endpoints will be tested using the Hochberg procedure at a significance 
level of 0.045 (Wiens, 2003). 
Unless specified otherwise, all other hypothesis testing will be 2-sided with a significance 
level of 0.05.

10.5.2 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
To assess the primary endpoint of the mean percent change from baseline in LDL -C at 
week 24, a repeated measures linear effects model will be used on the FAS to compare 
the efficacy of evolocumab with placebo. The repeated measures model will include 
terms for treatment group, stratification factors, scheduled visit and the interaction of 
treatment with scheduled visit. Missing values will not be imputed for primary analysis.  
10.5.2.1 Sensitivity Analysis  
To evaluate the robustness of the analysis results, sensitivity analyses will be performed 
as follows: 
• The primary analysis will be repeated using the CAS  
• Non-parametric analyses will be performed  
• A sensitivity analysis under the assumption that subjects who discontinued IP with 
missing endpoint data have a mean zero percent change from baseline will be conducted.
 
Subgroup Analysis  
If applicable, subgroup analyses on the primary endpoint will be conducted using the 
stratification factors or baseline covariates.  
10.5.3 Secondary Efficacy  Endpoint s 
The statistical model and testing of the tier 1 secondary efficacy endpoints will be similar  
to the primary analysis of primary endpoints. The secondary endpoint of LDL -C 
response (50% reduction of LDL -C from baseline and achievement of target 
LDL-C < 70 mg/d Las defined in secondary endpoint section) will be analyzed using the 
Cochran-Mantel Haenszel test adjusted by the stratification factors.  
Analysis of the tier 2 secondary efficacy endpoints will use the same analysis model as 
the tier 1 endpoints.  
Multiplicity adjustment procedures are defined in Section 10.5.1.1.  
10.5.4 Safety Endpoints 
The current Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version at the time of the data 
lock wi ll be used to code all adverse events to a system organ class and a preferred 
term.  
Subject incidence of all treatment-emergent adverse events will be tabulated by system 
organ class and preferred term. Tables of fatal adverse events, serious adverse even ts, 
adverse events leading to withdrawal from IP, device-related adverse events, and

significant treatment-emergent adverse events will also be provided. Subject-level data 
may be provided instead of tables if the subject incidence is low. 
Subject incidence of all disease-related events  and fatal disease-related events  will be 
tabulated by system organ class and preferred term.

11. REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS  
11.1 Informed Consent 
An initial sample ICF is provided for the investigator to prepare the informed consent 
document to be used at his or her site. Updates to the template are to be communicated 
formally in writing from the Clinical  Study Manager to the investigator. The written 
informed consent document is to be prepared in the language(s) of the potential subject 
population. Amgen will require a copy of the site’s IRB/IEC informed consent. 
Before a subject’s participation in the clinical study, the investigator is responsible for 
obtaining written informed consent from the subject after adequate explanation of the 
aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study and before any 
protocol -specific scree ning procedures or any IP  is administered.  
The investigator is also responsible for asking the subject if the subject has a primary 
care physician and if the subject agrees to have his/her primary care physician informed 
of the subject’s participation in the clinical study . If the subject agrees to such 
notification, the investigator is to inform the subject’s primary care physician of the 
subject’s participation in the clinical study . If the subject does not have a primary care 
physician and the i nvestigator will be acting in that capacity, the investigator is to 
document such in the subject’s medical record.  
The acquisition of informed consent and the subject’s agreement or refusal of his/her 
notification of the primary care physician is to be documented in the subject’s medical 
records, and the ICF  is to be signed and personally dated by the subject and by the 
person who conducted the informed consent discussion. The original signed ICF is to be 
retained in accordance with institutional policy, and a copy of the signed consent form is

IRB/IEC  must be informed of all amendments and give approval . The investigator must 
send a copy of the approval letter from the IRB/IEC to Amgen. 
Amgen reserves the right to terminate the study at any time. Both Amgen and the 
investigator  reserve the right to terminate the i nvestigator ’s participation in the study 
according to the study contract. The investigator is to notify the IRB/IEC  in writing of the 
study’s completion or early termination and send a copy of the notification to Amgen.  
Subjects may be eligible for continued treatment with Amgen IP  by an extension protocol 
or as provided for by the local country’s regulatory mechanism . However, Amgen 
reserves the unilateral right, at its sole discretion, to determine whether to supply Amgen 
IP and by what mechanism, after termination of the study and before the product(s) 
is/are available commercially.  
12.2 Study Documentation and Archive 
The investigator is to maintain a list of appropriately qualified persons to whom he/she 
has delegated study duties . All persons authorized to make entries and/or corrections on 
CRFs will be included on the Amgen Delegation of Authority Form.  
Source documents are original documents, data, and records from which the subject’s CRF data are obtained. These include but are not limited to hospital records, clinical and 
office charts, laboratory and pharmacy records, diaries, microfiches, radiographs, and 
correspondence.

In this study, the IVRS/IWR S system captures the following data points and these are 
considered source data:   
The investigator and study staff are responsible for maintaining a comprehensive and 
centralized filing system of all study -related (essential) documentation, suitable for 
inspection at any time by representatives from Amgen and/or applicable regulatory 
authorities.  
Elements to include:  
• Subject files containing completed CRFs , ICF s, and subject identification list  
• Study files containing the protocol with all amendments, I nvestigator’s Brochure, 
copies of prestudy documentation, and all correspondence to and from the IRB/IEC  
and Amgen  
• Investigational  product- related correspondence including Proof of Receipts , IP 
Accountability Record(s), Return of IP  for Destruction Form(s), Final IP  
Reconciliation Statement, as applicable.  
In addition, all original source documents supporting entries in the CRFs must be 
maintained and be readily available. 
Retention of study documents will be governed by the Clinical Trial Agreement. 
12.3 Study Monitoring and Data Collection 
The Amgen representative(s) and regulatory authority inspectors are responsible for 
contacting and visiting the investigator for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, 
upon request, inspecting the various records of the clinical study (eg, CRFs and other 
pertinent data) provided that subject confidentiality is respected. 
The Amgen Clinical M onitor is responsible for verifying the CRFs at regular intervals 
throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and 
consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research. The Clinic al Monitor is to have access to subject medical records and other 
study -related records needed to verify the entries on the CRFs. 
The investigator agrees to cooperate with the Clinical M onitor to ensure that any 
problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in completing CRFs, are resolved. 
In accordance with ICH GCP and the sponsor’s audit plans, this study may be selected 
for audit by representatives from Amgen’s Global Compliance Auditing function (or 
designees). Inspection of site facilities (eg, pharmacy, protocol -required therapy storage

areas, laboratories) and review of study-related records will occur to evaluate the study 
conduct and compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements. 
Data capture for this study is planned to be electronic:  
• All source documentation supporting entries into the CRFs must be maintained and 
readily available. 
• Updates to CRFs will be automatically documented through the software’s “audit trail”. 
• To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data 
management review is performed on subject data received at Amgen. During this 
review, subject data are checked for consistency, omissions, and any apparent 
discrepancies. In addition, the data are reviewed for adherence to the protocol and 
GCP . To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data management review 
process, data queries are created in the EDC system database for site resolution 
and subsequently closed by the EDC system or b y an Amgen reviewer.  
• The investigator signs only the Investigator Verification Form for this electronic data 
capture study or the investigator applies an electronic signature in the EDC system if the study is set up to accept an electronic signature. This signature indicates that 
investigator inspected or reviewed the data on the CRF, the data queries, and 
agrees with the content.  
Amgen (or designee) will perform self-evident corrections to obvious data errors in the 
clinical trial database, as documented in the Study Specific Self Evident Corrections 
Plan. Examples of obvious data errors that may be corrected by Amgen (or designee) 
include deletion of obvious duplicate data (eg, same results sent twice with the same date with different visit- week 4 and early termination) and clarifying “other, specify” if 
data are provided (eg, race, physical examination) . Each investigative site will be 
provided a list of the types of corrections applied to study data at the initiation of the trial and at study closeout.  
12.4 I nvestigator  Responsibilities for Data Collection 
The investigator is responsible for comply ing with the requirements for all assessments 
and data collection (including subjects not receiving protocol -required therapies) as 
stipulated in the protocol for each subject in the study. For subjects who withdraw prior 
to completion of all protocol -required visits and are unabl e or unwilling to continue the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table 3 ), the investigator can search publ ically available 
records [where permitted] to ascertain survival status . This ensures that the data set(s) 
produced as an outcome of the study is/are as comprehensive as possible.

12.5 Language 
All written information and other material to be used by subjects and investigative staff 
must use vocabulary and language that are clearly understood.  
12.6 Publication Policy  
Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis of the Uniform Requirement for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals 
(International Committee of Medical Journal Editors), which states:  
• Authorship credit should be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception and 
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the 
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; (3) final approval of the 
version to be published. Authors  should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3. 
• When a large, multi center group has conducted the work, the group should identify 
the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript. These individuals 
should fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above. 
• Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research 
group, alone, does not justify authorship. 
• All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who 
qualify should be listed.  
• Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public 
responsibility for appropriate portions of the content. 
All publications (eg, manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) 
based on this study must be submitted to Amgen for review . The Clinical Trial 
Agreement among the institution, investigator, and Amgen will detail the procedures for, 
and timing of, Amgen’s review of publications.

Drug -induced Liver Injury Reporting & Additional Assessments  
Reporting 
To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of DILI, cases of concurrent AST or ALT 
and TBL according to the criteria specified in  Section 6.3 require the following: 
• The event is to be reported to Amgen as a serious adverse event within 24 hours  of 
discovery or notification of the event (ie, before additional etiologic investigations 
have been concluded)  
• The appropriate CRF (eg, Event CRF) that captures information necessary to 
facilitate the evaluation of treatment-emergent liver abnormalities is to be completed 
and sent to the Amgen.  
Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Section 9.2.2.2. 
Additional Clinical Assessments and Observation 
All subjects in whom IP or protocol -required therapies is/are withheld (either permanently 
or conditionally) due to potential DILI as specified in Sections  6.3.1 and 6.3.2 or are to 
undergo a period of “close observation” until abnormalities return to normal or to the 
subject’s baseline levels . Assessments that are to  be performed during this period 
include: 
• AST, ALT, ALP, and bilirubin (total and direct) is to be repeated within 24 hours   
• In cases of TBL > 2x ULN, retesting of liver tests, and bilirubin (total and direct) is to 
be performed every 24 hours until laboratory abnormalities improve

Amendment 1 
Protocol Title:  A Double Blind, Randomized, Placebo Controlled, Multicenter 
Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy on LDL-C of Evolocumab 
(AMG 145) in Subjects With HIV and With Hyperlipidemia and/or Mixed 
Dyslipidemia 
 
Amgen Protocol Number  EVO 20130286 
BEIJERINCK: evolocumaB Effect on LDL-C lower Ing in subJE cts with human 
immunodeficiency viR us and INcreased Cardiovascular risK 
 
Amendment Date: 30 January  2017 
Rationale: 
Regulatory agencies had expressed concerns that HIV -positive subjects without clinical 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) with LDL ≥ 70 mg/dL but ≤ 100 mg/dL 
would be eligible to this study . The protocol was amended to address the regulators’ 
concerns. Per this amendment, s ubjects with clinical ASCVD  disease with LDL 
≥ 70 mg/dL are eligible for this study . For subjects without clinical ASCVD, LDL must be 
≥ 100 mg/dL. 
Additionally, regulators suggested that a subpopulation of subjects not on statin 
background therapy be included in this study . They also inquired about a prespecified 
size for that subpopulation that would allow for generalizability of the study results . 
Feasibility analysis  suggest that such a population is very small in clinical practice . For 
this study, per amendment, we will aim to enroll a subpopulation of subjects needing 
lipid-lowering therapy but not on statin therapy, congruent with the reality of clinical 
practice. We anticipate this subpopulation not on statin therapy  to be about 10% . In the 
protocol, a size for this subpopulati on is not prespecified, but text was added regarding 
stratification of randomization by statin treatment to include the expected percentage of 
subjects  on statin treatment. The European Medicines Agency  did not mandate a cap or 
subgroup size.  
This amendment also clarifies the definition of statin intolerance in inclusion 
criterion 106. 
Sections of the protocol concerning temporary withholding and permanent discontinuation of investigational product in response to hepatotoxicity, pregnancy and

lactation reporting, and disease-related event reporting were updated to reflect current 
Amgen guidelines . The electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency form 
(Appendix  B) was replaced with the current version of the form.  
Further, to address how HIV worsening will be classified, a section was added to clarify 
that HIV worsening will be recorded as an adverse event. In the case of HIV worsening, 
because of potential drug– drug interaction between statins and antiretroviral therapy, 
changing background lipid-lowering therapy is left to the judgment of the investigator. 
In addition to these changes , the pregnancy test s chedule was revised to address 
regulatory agency concerns, and details  were provided to clarify when serum and urine 
pregnancy tests will be performed.  
Minor administrative and typographical changes were made throughout the protocol .

change during the duration of study participation, and who have fasting LDL-C of 
≥ 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) or non-HDL -C ≥ 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) and fasting 
triglycerides ≤  600 mg/dL (6.8 mmol/L) . Subjects who are receiving lipid-lowering

For some subjects, “maximally tolerated” may indicate no statin at all due to statin intolerance or contraindication to statin therapy . A statin-intolerant subject must meet the criteria described in 
Section 4.1.1, criterion 106. Statin intolerance or contraindication must be 
documented. Subjects without known clinical atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) must 
have fasting LDL-C of ≥  100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) or non-HDL -C of ≥  130 mg/dL 
(3.4 mmol/L) as determined by the central laboratory at screening. Subjects with 
known clinical ASCVD must have fasting LDL-C of ≥  70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) or 
non-HDL -C of ≥  100mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) as determined by the central laboratory .

With: 
A disease-related event that would qualify as an adverse event or serious adverse 
event is an event based on the underlying disease that is worse than expected as 
assessed by the investigator for the subject’s condition or an event for which the 
investigator believes there is a causal relationship between the investigational 
product(s)/study treatment/protocol required therapies and disease worsening. This must be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event. 
Section:  9.1.2 Adverse Events  
Add:  
Section 9.1.2.1, Worsening of HIV Disease 
HIV worsening will be captured as an adverse event . Because evolocumab is not 
expected to have any interaction with antiretroviral therapy or viral load or 
consequences of HIV infection, no specific actions with respect to study 
participation (including investigational product) are expected of the investigator . 
Should a subject’s viral load change or HIV infection worsen, the investigator is 
expected to manage HIV infection or any other concomitant illnesses per his or her clinical judgment . Background lipid-lowering therapy is expected to be stable. 
However, in the case of HIV worsening, because of potential dr ug–drug interaction 
between statins and antiretroviral therapy, changing background lipid-lowering therapy is left to the judgment of the investigator.

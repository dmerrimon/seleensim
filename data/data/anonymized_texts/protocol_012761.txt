BACKGROUND AND STUDY RATIONALE  
Introduction  
This study will be one of the first randomized controlled trials to assess whether weight loss 
induced through diet and physical activity can change  neural responses to high - and low -calorie 
food images . In addition, it will evaluate  whether weight loss  can improve neural function when 
performing the N -back task, a measure of working memory . Findings will address notable gaps in 
the literature by testing whether a scalable weight loss intervention can help protect and improve 
neurocognitive functioning and brain health in individuals with obesity. This study will also provide 
important inform ation about the effects of weight loss on neuroplasticity in brain regions crucial 
for memory and cognitive functioning, which will help to inform future interventions aimed at 
promoting brain health.  
 
This document is a clinical research protocol and the described study will be conducted in 
compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice standards, associated federal regulations, 
and all applicable University research requirements. This study will be conducted in full 
accordance with all applicable University of Pennsylvania Research Policies and Procedures and 
all applicable Federal and state laws and regulations including 45 CFR 46 , and Good Clinical 
Practice . All episodes of noncompliance will be documented.  
1.1 Background and Relevant Literature  
Obesity, characterized by a body mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m2, is caused by overconsumption of 
calories relative to energy expenditure.1 The modern obesogenic environment, filled with cues to 
consume highly -palatable and energy -dense foods, is  a major driver of overweight and obesity.2 
Obesity greatly increases the burden of chronic illnesses including Alzheimer’s disease and 
dementia.3-8 Even before the onset of these conditions, elevated body mass is linked with worse 
neurocognitive functioning such as poor inhibitory control, attention, and memory.9 The purpose 
of this proposal is to evaluate the potential benefits of weight loss on two neural processes that 
have been shown to be impaired among people with obesity: food cue responsiveness and 
memory.  
 
People with obesity have altered neural responses to environmental food cues, including when 
seeing pictures of food.10 The majority of studies have shown that people with obesity, relative to 
those without, have greater responsiveness to high -calorie food images in regions of the brain 
associated with reward (e.g., striatum,  amygdala, insula, orbitofrontal cortex), attent ion 
(anterior  cingulate cortex), and  motor processes  (precentral gyrus, cerebellum).10,11 Elevated 
reward -region responses to high -calorie food images and cues are associated with higher food 
cravings, more snack consumption, and future weight gain.10,12 -16 This increase in neural 
responsiveness has been hypothesized to be due to learning processes, as well as changes in 
energy -balance hormones, such as ghrelin, leptin, insulin, amylin, and peptide YY, which can 
modulate the brain networks associated with foo d reward and control.17-19  
 
Another area of research has shown that individuals with obesity, relative to those of normal 
weight, have reduced performance on behavioral measures of memory,20 as well as worse brain 
health in neural structures and functions associated with memory.21 For example, relative to 
participants with normal weight, those with obesity have lower performance on measures of 
working memory (i.e., the ability to store and manage information on a transient basis) as 
assessed by tasks in which participants are asked  to recall sequences of numbers.20 Compared 
to participants with normal weight, those with obesity have decreased global brain volume, and 
decreased volumes in the temporal lobe, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and

hippocampus.21,22 Reduced hippocampal volume among people with obesity is evident as early 
as childhood.23 Relative to participants with normal weight, those with obesity have lower neural 
activation of the parietal cortex (an area associated with memory retrieval) during working memory 
tasks.24 These brain structures and functions are crucial for memory, as well as general executive 
functioning and self -regulatory processes necessary to achieve long -term goals.25,26  
 
Weight loss through diet, physical activity, and behavior modification is recommended for 
individuals with obesity. Benefits of weight loss include improvements in glycemia, triglycerides, 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, inflammation,  and health -related quality of 
life.27-29 After weight loss, individuals report improvements in appetite including decreased 
hunger,30,31 food cravings,32,33 and preoccupation with food, and increased fullness.34 In addition, 
there is evidence that low -fat diets can help to decrease cravings for high -fat foods and to shift 
preferences to low -carbohydrate/high -protein foods.35 However, the effects of weight loss on 
neural processes related to food cue reactivity and memory are not clear.  
 
Acute caloric restriction appears to increase neural responses to food cues, especially high -
calorie foods. Food, especially high -calorie and energy -dense food, is more attractive and 
palatable when people are hungry.36 Compared to satiated conditions, acute caloric deprivation  
(typically fasting 8 -24 hours) increases activation in neural regions that have been implicated in 
attention (anterior cingulate cortex), reward valuation (amygdala), memory (hippocampus), and 
homeostatic feeding (hypothalamus) in response to pictures of palatable foods versus non -food 
control images.37,38 Further, acute caloric deprivation selectively increases responsiveness in 
brain reward systems (i.e., the ventral striatum, amygdala, anterior insula, and medial and lateral 
orbitofrontal cortex) to highly palatable foods relative to low -calorie food ima ges.39-41  
 
In contrast to acute caloric deprivation, moderate caloric restriction (i.e., a diet of 800 -1500 
kcals/day) for 3 weeks to several months alters neural responsiveness to food, but in the opposite 
direction of acute restriction. Longer -term moderate caloric restriction, with weight loss of 
approximately 3.5 -10% of initial weight, has been associated with decreased food -cue reactivity 
to high -calorie foods in brain regions regulating energy balance  (e.g., hypothalamus)42, some 
regions of the dopaminergic reward system (e.g. orbitofrontal cortex42,43, anterior cingulate 
cortex42, amygdala42, caudate44,45), and regions that execute appetitive behavior (e.g. precentral 
gyrus).42,46 A small pilot trial also demonstrated that weight loss increased responsiveness to low -
calorie foods (e.g., apple, grilled chicken, salmon; mean of 2.1 kcals/gram) in reward regions of 
the brain (dorsal and ventral striatum).47  
 
Another body of research indicates that weight loss improves attention, executive functioning, and 
memory.48 A recent meta -analysis of six studies demonstrated that weight loss induced through 
dietary changes, caloric restriction, and physical activity, significantly improved behavioral indices 
of memory compared to control groups.48 Yet, few studies have assessed whether behavioral 
findings of memory changes with weight loss correspond with improved brain structure and 
function. Relative to control conditions, aerobic exercise increased left hippocampal volume,49 
possibly through prevention of decreased neurogenesis and improved angiogenesis. In rodents, 
switching from a high -fat diet to a low -fat diet helped to reverse impairments in memory.50 Few 
studies have assessed the effects of lifestyle interventions consisting of dietary, physical activity, 
and behavioral modification on memory -related neural changes. Of the studies that have been 
conducted, compared to control groups, lifestyle intervent ions demonstrated improvements in 
hippocampal function,51-53 as well as increased hippocampal volumes.51,52 However, many of 
these studies are limited by pre -posttest designs and small sample sizes. Little is known about

the impact of weight loss induced through lifestyle modification interventions (that include dietary 
and physical activity changes) on memory -related neural processes.  
 
Thus, current evidence suggests that weight loss programs that encourage moderate caloric 
restriction and increased physical activity may improve neural responses to food cues. 
Further more , decreased neural reward responsiveness to high -calorie food cues and increased 
responsiveness to low -calorie food cues may underlie improvements seen in self -reported and 
behavioral measures of appetite. Behavioral weight loss studies also suggest that w eight loss 
induced through diet, physical activity, and lifestyle ch anges can improve brain structures and 
function associated with memory. However, this literature is limited by small sample sizes and the 
lack of randomized trials that have directly assessed these questions. The present study is 
significant because it wil l help to improve our understanding of neuronal correlates of weight loss 
interventions. A better understanding of brain mechanisms underlying weight loss can improve 
the efficacy of obesity prevention and treatment interventions.  
2 Study Objectives  
The purpose of the present study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the 
effects of a commercially available weight loss program (WW ; formerly Weight Watchers ) on 
neural response to food cues and memory tasks, as well as on structural brain morphology. 
Participants with obesity will be randomized to either 16 weeks of a group -based WW program 
(n=30) or a wait -list control (WLC; n=30). Both groups will have stru ctural and blood oxygen level -
dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonan ce imaging (fMRI) scans at baseline and after the 
end of the  intervention. Participants will complete the following fMRI tasks: 1) structural scan s; 2) 
food cue task to measure reactivity to high and low -calorie food images;10 and 3) N -back task to 
measure working memory (i.e., the ability to temporarily hold information available for 
processing).54 In addition, participants will complete self -report and behavioral measures of eating 
behaviors, appetite , physical activity, mood, quality of life, attention  and memory  at baseline, and 
week s 8 and 16 (and at the end of the intervention).  
2.1 Primary Objective s 
Aim 1: To compare differences between the WW and WLC groups at the end of the intervention  
in changes in BOLD fMRI response to food cues.  
Hypothesis 1: We hypothesize that compared to the WLC, the WW group will have significantly 
greater declines in BOLD response to high -calorie foods in the reward regions of the brain (insula, 
orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, nucleus accumbens) and signif icantly greater 
increases in BOLD response to low -calorie foods in these reward regions.   
 
Aim 2a: To compare differences between the WW and WLC groups at the end of the intervention  
in changes in self -reported and behavioral measures of appetite, and Aim 2b : to test whether 
changes in self -reported and behavioral measures of appetite are associated with changes in 
neural responsivity to high and low -calorie foods in each study arm.  
Hypothesis 2a: We hypothesize that at the end of the intervention  the WW group, compared to 
the WLC group, will have significantly greater declines in self -reported reward -based eating, food 
cravings, hunger , and preference for high -calorie foods, and significantly greater increases in 
fullness after meals and preference for low -calorie food . Hypothesis 2b: We hypothesize that in 
the WW group, greater declines in BOLD responses to high -calorie foods will be associated with 
decreased (self -reported) wanting,  liking, preference and craving of these foods, and that greater 
increases in BOLD response to low -calorie foods will be associated with increased wanting, liking, 
preference, and craving of low -calorie foods.

Aim 3: To evaluate whether WW, compared to WLC, increases hippocampal volume from 
baseline to the end of the intervention .  
Hypothesis 3: We hypothesize that compared to the WLC,  WW will be associated with a 
significantly greater increase in the size of the hippocampus.  
 
Aim 4:  To compare differences between the WW and WLC groups at the end of the intervention  
in changes in BOLD fMRI response to the N -back task.54  
Hypothesis 4:  We hypothesize that during the working memory task, the WW group, relative to 
the WLC group, will have significantly greater increases in BOLD activation in the hippocampus, 
dorsolateral and midventrolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, a nd premotor cortex.  
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
Aim 5a: To compare differences between the WW and WLC groups at the end of the intervention  
in changes in N -back behavioral performance, and Aim 5b:  to assess the associations between 
pre- to post -treatment behavioral changes in memory, and pre - to post -treatment neural changes 
on the N -back task within each study arm.  
Hypothesis 5a: We hypothesize that at the end of the intervention , the WW group, relative to the 
WLC group will have significantly shorter reaction times and improved accuracy on the N -back 
task (indicating significantly greater improvements in working memory). Hypothesis 5b: We 
hypothesize that in the WW group, greater improvements in BOLD response in the hippocampus, 
dorsolateral and midventrolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and premotor cortex 
during the N -back task will be associate d with greater improvements in N -back reaction time and 
accuracy.  
3 Study Endpoints  
3.1.1  Primary Study Endpoints  
The primary endpoints are baseline to end of intervention  changes in BOLD fMRI response to 
food images and to the N-back task  as well as baseline to end of intervention  changes in 
hippocampal volume  and appetite ( i.e., reward -based eating, food cravings, hunger, preference 
for high - and low -calorie food, and fullness).  
3.1.2  Secondary Study Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints include baseline to end of intervention  changes in N-back t ask behavioral 
performance ; association between changes in changes in memory and baseline to week 16 
changes in N -back task performance; and baseline to end of intervention  changes in weight, blood 
pressure, waist circumference, eating behavior, perceived nutrition environment, quality of life , 
self-regulation, physical activity, stress, inhibitory control, and resilience .  
4 Study Design  
4.1 General Design  
The proposed investigation is an open -label, RCT to assess changes in neural responses to food 
images and memory tasks in 60 participants with obesity who are randomized to a 16 -week 
behavioral weight loss program (WW ; n=30 ) versus a WLC group  (n=30) . Participants will be 
assessed at baseline and 16 weeks  and at the end of the intervention , with the baseline and end 
of intervention assessments  including structural and functional neuroimaging with BOLD fMRI. An 
additional assessment will occur at week 8 and include self-report  measures only. Neither 
subjects nor investigators will be masked to treatment assignment.

COVID -19 Changes. Due to the mandatory restrictions in research related to COVID -19, we 
have transitioned our in -person groups to group -based, remotely delivered sessions  via Blue 
Jeans. We are also not able to conduct fMRI scans on participants and have extended weekly 
treatment for those people who are currently in the intervention arm (currently our first cohort of 
10 participants). Extending treatment will help partici pants in the intervention arm continue to lose 
weight, which is an important mechanism  we believe will be related to the fMRI results. The 
treatment will continue as it has, with remotely -delivered, group -based, behavioral weight loss 
sessions. Those on the wait -list have also had an extended time on the wait -list until we are able 
to conduct in -person, group treatment in accordance with University Guidance . We will administer 
the questionnaires at week 16 as in the original protocol. However, we will re -administer these 
questionnaires at the end of the intervention, once we are able to conduct fMRI scans on 
participants.

Disorders will describe the study, explain that the research is completely voluntary, and conduct 
a brief screening of candidates who express an interest in proceeding (e.g., BMI and MRI 
eligibility). We request a waiver of written documentation of consent for the telephone and 
questionnaire screen.  
 
Those who appear to meet eligibility criteria and remain interested in the trial will be scheduled 
for an in -person interview . The Weight and Lifestyle Inventory (WALI),25 an inventory that 
assesses general eating and lifestyle behaviors, and the Beck Depression Inventory -II (BDI -II),26 
will be forwarded to eligible subjects via REDCap following the phone screen and completed by 
them prior to their screening/informed consent visit. (All patients and subjects at our Center 
complete the WALI and BDI to facili tate their initial interview.)  
6.2.2  Screening visit  
Following the initial telephone screening assessment, eligible participants will attend a 2 -hour 
intake visit at the Center for Weight and Eating Disorders at the University of Pennsylvania. The 
in-person interview will be conducted by study staff, who will obtain informed consent and 
evaluate subjects’ behavioral eligibility (i.e., willingness and appropriateness to participate). This 
will include our assessment of the applicant’s mood (as me asured by interview and the BDI26) 
and suicidality (including history of suicidal ideation and behavior, as assessed at screening by 
interview and the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale55). Subjects who remain interested and 
pass this portion of the assessment will be asked about their medical history to determine medical 
eligibility. The following procedures will be completed at the screening visit:  
• Informed consent  
• Behavioral evaluations  
• Review of Weight and Lifestyle Inventory25 
• Height and weight to assess BMI  
• MRI-eligibility checklist  
• Routine medical history  
• Review of medications  
• Psychiatric exam using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale55 and Beck 
Depression Inventory -II26 
• Waist circumference  
• Blood pressure and heart rate  
• Urine pregnancy test  (if unsure about pregnancy status ) 
• Practice session of the N-back task  to minimize the learning effects of the experiment  
• Questionnaires (emailed via REDCap or printed)

After participants complete the screening procedures, provide their informed consent to 
participate, and are enrolled into the study, they will complete two study assessment visits that 
include fMRIs (one at baseline and one after 16 -weeks) as well as a mid -point assessment at 
week 8 (that does not include an fMRI).  
6.3 FMRI Assessments.  
Prior to randomization, participants will complete a baseline fMRI assessment that will occur up 
to 4 weeks before the intervention begins. They will complete another fMRI assessment between 
2 weeks before the end of the intervention (or up to 1 week after the study intervention is 
completed). The timeframe for the follow -up assessment was selected so participants in the WW 
group will be actively engaged in weight loss efforts at the time of the second scanning. 
Partic ipants will be compensated $100 for eac h fMRI assessment visit.  
 
Planning for the Assessment Visit . Study assessment visits will be scheduled for the morning  
and last approximately 3 hours (60 minutes in the fMRI scanner and 120 minutes to complete 
questionnaires , behavioral tasks, and physical measurements). The visit s will be held at the 
Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Participants will be asked to fast (including no caffeine 
or alcohol) for at least 8 hours prior to the appointment to increase the stimulus salience41 and 
create a more homogeneous hunger state across participants. Participants will be asked to 
remove all jewelry and metal objects at the visit. Participants who require vision correction will be 
instructed to wear contact lenses or will be provided with MRsafe glasses in their prescription 
strength.  
 
Imaging Procedures  
Pre-scan preparation. Visits on imaging days will begin in the morning at the Hospital of the 
University of Pennsylvania. Upon arriving, participants will be greeted by research staff who will 
review  the MRI -eligibility checklist to ensure no changes have occurred that would render MRI 
unsafe or uncomfortable. The MRI technician will review this checklist. All participants will be 
asked about pregnancy status. For those who are unsure, a urine pregnan cy will be completed 
prior to the scan. Those who attest to being pregnant or test positive will be withdrawn. 
Participants will be asked to wear clothing without metal or to change into a hospital gown and be 
weighed, without shoes, on a calibrated electronic scale . They will then complete a self -report 
measure of current mood (i.e., the Profile of Mood States73), Food Cravings Questionnaire - State 
(FCQ -S), and Eating Behaviors Questionnaire,  and visual analog scales for stress, hunger, food 
cravings, and fatigue level. They also will be required to demonstrate understanding of the task 
and use of the response device prior to entering the scanner.  
 
Imaging equipment.  We will use a clinically approved 3.0 Tesla Siemens Prisma scanner 
equipped with 64 -channel head coil. BOLD fMRI sequences include automatic higher order 
shimming and both prospective and retrospective motion correction. Gradient performance allows 
4 mm i sotropic voxels at TR=2 sec and 3 mm isotropic voxels at TR=3 sec (3T). The system uses 
a transmit/receive head coil.  
 
The research scanner is equipped with stimulus delivery and monitoring systems for fMRI 
research. This includes Sanyo SXGA 4200 lumens projectors with Sanyo Long Throw zoom lens

for rear -view/rear projection onto Mylar screens. Video signals are carried into the magnet room 
using a Lightwave FiberLynx optical -fiber VGA connection. Both the projector and the FiberLynx 
units are housed in custom RF shield boxes with filtered power r eceptacles. Images are viewed 
through mirrors mounted on the head coils . Responses will be monitored using a color -coded 
keypad made of non -ferromagnetic components (FORP Current Design Inc., Philadelphia, PA) 
installed at the 3T system. The MRI scan has been designed to last 55 minutes. To ensure 
completion of all scans, each procedure will be timed and every effort will be made to keep as 
close to the designated schedule as possible. In respect of time and data quality, if necessary, 
scans will be skipped  or re-run at the discretion of the research team.   
 
Protocol for structural MRI (5 minutes).  A magnetization -prepared, rapid acquisition gradient 
echo (MPRAGE) image will be acquired for anatomic overlays of functional data and spatial 
normalization using the following parameters: TI/TR/TE= 900/2200 /4.67ms, flip= 8°, 
matrix=256x192, FOV=240x180mm, slices=160, slice thickness=1mm.  
 
Protocol for BOLD fMRI (~10 minutes).  Resting and Task fMRI data will be acquired using a 
whole -brain, single -shot, multi -slice, gradient -echo EPI sequence .  
 
FMRI Tasks. We will use two tasks to assess the impact of WW on neural activity to food -cues 
and to memory . Our tasks have been selected to target relevant cognitive and neural models of 
weight loss . The timing of the stimulus presentation will be synchronized with trigger pulses from 
the magnet in order to ensure precise temporal integration of stimulus presentation and fMRI data 
acquisition. These tasks will be presented in a fixed order with the N-back occurring first and food 
cue task  occurring second.  
 
BOLD fMRI Task (N -back; ~15 minutes).  The N -back task is one of the most extensively used 
measures of working memory and requires the storage and updating of information. During the 
task, participants will be presented with a sequence of images  one-by-one.54 For each stimulus, they 
will need to indicate if the current stimulus is the same as the one presented  in a previous set. We 
will use four different difficulty levels for this study, one in which participants are asked to recall a 
stimulus that occurred 0, 1, 2, and 3  back (i.e., 0-, 1-, 2- and 3 -back). For example, during the 2 -back 
task, the response would be “yes” if the stimulus currently presented matches the stimulus presented 
two earlier. A 0 -back task will be used as a control condition, in which pa rticipants are asked to simply 
respond yes to the stimuli they are being shown. Increasing memory load is determined by the 
increase in the number of items the participant has to keep in mind. A slower reaction time and less 
accuracy are indicative of worse working memory. The stimuli and blocks are presented in a 
pseudorandom order . 
 
BOLD fMRI task (Food images; 15 minutes).  The food images task will be composed of five 
blocks of high -calorie foods (e.g., bacon, ice cream, cake, burger, French fries, pizza), five blocks 
of low -calorie foods (e.g., apples, broccoli, banana, salmon, lentils), and five blocks of neutral 
images (e .g., office supplies).  Participants will passively view the images and be asked to imagine 
how much they want the object right now. Pictures have been matched for complexity, brightness, 
and color composition. Stimuli a re digital photographs of food items depicted in the ready -to-eat 
state (e.g., all packaging is removed) on identical backgrounds that are validated and are 
available in publicly available databases.74,75 Each block will be 30 seconds in duration and 
presented in pseudorandom order. Each block will contain five photographs of food (5 seconds) 
separated by 1 -second inter -stimulus interval (fixation point). Food blocks will be followed by a 
30-second rest pe riod. Following the fMRI, participants will be asked to rate the liking and 
desirability of the food images (e.g., “How much do you like this food?”), using visual analog 
scales.

Task Assessments  and Questionnaires.  After the fMRI is completed, participants will complete 
questionnaires to assess response to the fMRI tasks and manipulations and treatment outcomes. 
To assess the response to the tasks using the food images, participants will be asked about their 
liking a nd wanting and palatability of the presented foods on visual analog  scale s. Participants 
will complete physical measurements and additional questions, if they have not been completed 
before their screening visit.  
6.4 Cognitive Assessments  
After participants complete the questionnaires, they will be asked to complete two cognitive 
assessments. We will also use the Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire , a computerized 
procedure to assess liking, wanting, and relative preferences for high versus low -fat foods and 
sweet versus savory foods.76 The Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire assesses  different 
components of food preference and food reward. Participants are presented with an array of 
pictures of individual food items common in the diet  that are high or low in fat but similar in 
familiarity, protein content, sweet or non -sweet taste and palatability. The task takes 
approximately 10 minutes to complete. Cognitive function will be assessed with the NIH Toolbox 
Cognitive Function Battery which include s 7 tests covering different  cognitive abilities including 
attention and executive functioning, episodic memory, working memory, language, and 
processing speed.77 The cognitive assessments will be administered in a private room at both 
fMRI scans as well as a week 8 visit. 
Week 8 Assessment.   
We will also conduct a mid -point assessment. During this visit we will obtain participants’ weight, 
cognitive  assessments, and questionnaires as listed on Tabl e 1 and Table 2 . Given the 
restrictions with COVID, we will only use self -report weight and self -report questionnaires at the 
week 8 visit.  
6.5 Wait-List Post -Treatment Visit ( Wait -list Group Only)  
After individuals in the WL C group complete their second fMRI assessment, they will be offered 
the WW  treatment. The WL C group will be asked to complete questionnaires as well as their 
height, weight, and behavioral  measures at their end of intervention  visit. 
6.6 Randomization Visit  
 
Participants who meet all eligibility criteria assessed at the screening visit will be scheduled for a  
baseline fMRI assessment . The visit will occur  within  approximately  4 weeks of beginning 
treatment . They will be instructed to complete the self -reported outcomes either online (using a 
link e -mailed to them) or using paper -and-pencil questionnaires (for those who prefer this method) 
approximately 10 days before their fMRI scan. Their questionnaires will be reviewed for 
completeness at the fMRI visit, with any omissions or errors corrected.  The randomization visit 
will include a weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, and heart rate, and completion of 
additional baseline assessments (as described in Table 2). Participants will then be randomly 
assigned to the two groups in equal numbers (i.e., 1:1 ratio). This will be accomplished using a 
computer -generated algorithm operated by faculty at the Center for Weight and Eating Disorders 
at the University o f Pennsylvania (e.g., Dr. Jena Tronieri). Assignment will be made from randomly 
varied block sizes ( 2 or 4 ). This is an open -labelled randomized trial. Due to COVID -19, we have 
combined the randomization visit with the baseline fMRI visit.  After they compl ete their fMRI visit, 
they will be randomized  to a treatment group.

7 Study Intervention  
 
WW Group Lifestyle Modification Program . The WW intervention will consist of weekly, group 
weight loss workshops (formerly meetings)  for 16 or more weeks. Each workshop  will be 
approximately 1 hour  and include 8 to 12 participants . Participants will have access to both in -
person  or web -based , group meetings as well as digital tools (e.g., self -monitoring of intake, 
activity, and weight). The meetings will be led by a trained coach  and a  guide.  All group sessions 
will be conducted at the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Weight and Eating Disorders, 
following the WW program.  Due to the coronavirus pandemic, all non -essential visits at the 
University of Pennsylvania will be canceled  starting  March 16, 2020 . As a result, each group 
workshop  after Week 8 will be moved to a virtual video chat platform, BlueJeans. Participants 
have the option of calling in through video or audio. All participants will be sent standardized 
scales and will self -report their weight. Blood pressure will not be measured until the participants’ 
next in -person visit.  The program uses a SmartPoints® System that encourages consumption of 
fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and less sugar and unhealthy fats.  Participants will have their 
weight , blood pressure, and heart rate  measured at each session. Changes in medications and 
adverse events will be reported privately to research staff at clinic meetings.  
 
Wait-list control  (WLC)  group. Participants in the WLC group will be asked to stay weight stable  
and not to make changes in their eating and physical activity behaviors  and not to seek treatment 
for weight or eating during the wait ing period . They will be contacted between week 6-8 via phone 
by a research assistant to keep participants engaged , enhance retention  and schedule their week 
8 assessment visit . We will use a structured script  and ask participants about any additional 
treatments they may have sought during the study . All WLC participants will be offered the WW 
intervention (as described above) after they complete the second fMRI assessment at the end of 
treatment.  
7.1 Unscheduled Visits  
Participants who miss a session  will be contacted by their coach, guide,  or study staff following 
the absence . An in-person or phone  make up visit  will be offered.  
7.2 Subject Withdrawal  
 
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time without impact to their care  at the University of 
Pennsylvania healthcare s ystem . They may also be discontinued from the study at the discretion 
of the Investigator for lack of adherence to intervention or study procedures or visit schedules, 
AEs, or due to subject pregnancy or intention of becoming pregnant.  The Investigator may also 
withdraw subjects who violate the study plan, or to protect the subject for reasons of safety or for 
administrative reasons.  It will be documented whether or not each subject completes the clinical 
study.  
 
Lost to follow -up: In the case of subjects who do not return to the Center for study procedures 
and cannot be contacted, study personnel will make vigorous and repeated attempts (minimum 
of 3) to contact the subject. If all attempts to contact the subject fail, that subjec t will be considered 
to be lost to follow -up and discontinued from the study.

7.3 Safety Evaluations  
Safety evaluations include adverse events (AEs)  and assessments of blood pressure and heart 
rate. At weeks 8 and 16 , we will check for possible complications of weight loss , and will also 
encourage participants to inform the study team sooner if applicable . At weeks 8 and 16, s tudy 
subjects will be asked whether there has been any change in their health or medications. In the 
event of adverse mental health events, participants will be referred to the study’s psychologist or 
psychiatrist for further evaluation, if required. For all non -study -related medical events, 
participants will be referred to their own primary care provider.  
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
8.1.1  Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as 
adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be  adverse events 
if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance  
8.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE 
that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospital stay  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly 
of major clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above .  All adverse events that do not meet any 
of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious adverse events .  
8.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
At each contact with subjects, study personnel will be responsive to reports of adverse events 
with specific questioning, and, as appropriate, by examination. The investigator will report all 
adverse events including serious adverse events (SAE) and suspec ted unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (SUSARs) (as defined below) to the Penn IRB. Information on all adverse 
events will be recorded immediately in the source document and reported immediately, and also 
in the appropriate adverse event module of the ca se report form (CRF). Information on study 
name, subject identification, event (i.e., diagnosis), and reporter identification (e.g., name) will be 
collected and recorded in the source document (as detailed below). All serious adverse events 
will be reporte d to the IRB within 24 hours.  
Neurocognitive Benefits of WW    
Version: 4.0 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.

All events meeting the definition of an adverse event will be collected and reported from the first 
trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent and until the end of the post -
treatment follow -up period. Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study 
period will be followed up until either resolved or stable.  Any serious adverse event that occurs 
after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study interventi on or study 
participation  will be recorded and reported immediately.  
8.3 Relationship of AE to Study  
• Probable: Good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship  
• Possible: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed  
• Unlikely: The event etiology is most likely not related to the study procedures  
The PI will evaluate all unexpected events and adverse reactions.  
8.4 Outcome Categories and Definitions:  
• Recovered: Fully recovered or by medical or surgical treatment the condition has returned 
to the level observed at the first trial related activity after the subject signed the informed 
consent  
• Recovering: The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover from the event. 
This term should only be used when the subject has completed the trial  
• Recovered with sequelae: As a result of the AE, the subject suffered persistent and     
significant disability/incapacity (e.g. became blind, deaf, paralysed). Any AE recovered with 
sequelae should be rated as an SAE  
• Not recovered  
• Fatal  
• Unknown  
9 Reporting of Adverse Events, Adverse Device Effects and Unanticipated Problems  
All events meeting the definition of an adverse event will be collected and reported from the first 
trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent and until the end of the post -
treatment follow -up period as stated in the protocol.   
At a minimum the following information will be reported:  
• Study identifier  
• Subject number  
• A description of the event  
• Date of onset  • Current status  
• Whether study intervention was discontinued  
• The reason why the event is classified as 
serious  
• Investigator assessment of the association 
between the event and study intervention  
 
Additionally all other events (unanticipated problems, adverse reactions, unanticipated adverse 
device effects and subject complaints  will be recorded and reported with respect to institutional 
and federal policies as described in the Penn Manual . 
 
9.1.1  Follow -up report  
If an SAE has not resolved at the time of the initial report and new information arises that changes 
the investigator’s assessment of the event, a follow -up report including all relevant new or 
reassessed information (e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) should be submitted to 
Neurocognitive Benefits of WW    
Version: 4.0 
 
CONFIDENTIAL

 4 
the IRB. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all SAE are followed until either resolved 
or stable.  
9.1.2  Investigator reporting: notifying the study sponsor  
Study-related unanticipated problem posing risk to subjects or others, and any type of serious 
adverse event, will be reported to the study sponsor within 24 hours of the event.  To report such 
events, a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) form will be completed by  the investigator and sent to the 
study sponsor within 24 hours.  The investigator will keep a copy of this SAE form on file at the 
study site. Within the following 48 hours, the investigator will provide further information on the 
serious adverse event or  the unanticipated problem in the form of a written narrative.  This should 
include a copy of the completed Serious Adverse Event form, and any other diagnostic information 
that will assist the understanding of the event.  Significant new information on on going serious 
adverse events should be provided promptly to the study sponsor.  
10 Study Administration, Data Handling and Record Keeping  
10.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those 
regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject  of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
All electronic PHI will be maintained by using an institutionally secured and managed network 
drive, institutionally secured and managed devices, and institutionally approved third -party 
computing environments.  Should PHI need to be transferred, it will b e done so through the use 
of a Penn -approved encrypted portable drive or a Penn -approved secure encrypted file transfer 
solution.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization. For subjects who have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts will 
be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the 
end of their scheduled study period.  
 
Where possible, data will be entered directly into our password protected database, REDCap. 
All data pertaining to the study will be saved on the Center for Weight and Eating Disorders’ 
password -protected server.  Paper copies of informed consent, question naires, interviews, lab 
results, and any correspondence will be kept in the case record in locked offices.   
11 Privacy  
Steps will be taken to protect subject privacy. I nformed consent and study procedures will be 
conducted in a private room, and the collection of sensitive information will be limited to the 
minimum necessary to achieve the aims of the project.

The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by the EC/IRB, the 
sponsor, government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups 
of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulator y documents, data collection 
instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of 
applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by 
government regulatory authorities and applicable University compliance and quality assurance 
offices.  
13 Ethical Considerations  
 
The principal investigator (PI) will initiate and enroll subjects only after receiving IRB approval of 
the protocol and the informed consent documents. All recruiting materials used in the study will 
have IRB approval. Progress reports regarding the study will be submitted to the IRB in 
accordance with institutional and regulatory guidelines.  
 
The study will be performed in compliance with the FDA Code of Federal Regulations for Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP). These procedures ensure the protection of the rights and the integrity of 
the subjects, adequate and correct conduct of all study procedure s, adequate data collection, 
adequate documentation, and adequate data verification.  
 
Before being enrolled, subjects will be provided informed consent. The nature, scope, and 
possible consequences of the study will have been explained in a form understandable to them. 
A copy of the consent document will be given to the subject. The PI will  retain the original signed 
consent document.   
 
Subject confidentiality will be maintained throughout the study according to applicable guidelines, 
regulations and IRB requirements. All study clinical data and reports of results will de -identify 
individual subjects. Subjects will be identified by initia ls, date of birth, gender and subject number 
only for use in data collection. Published data will provide subject numbers only if needed for 
clarity of presentation (e.g., in individual event listings).  
 
The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study will be 
conducted in accordance with the ICH GCP guidelines. The investigators will comply with all 
applicable regulatory and legal requirements, ICH GCP guidelines, and the Declaration of Helsinki 
in obtaining and documenting the informed consent.  
13.1 Risks  
 
The risks to participants in this trial have been carefully considered and minimized to the extent 
possible. The known risk of the WW program and completing the study assessments are minimal. 
Every effort has been made to provide a study in which the safety of research participants is 
protected.  
 
Risks of Assessments, Behavioral Weight Loss Treatment , and Wait-list 
Some of the questions in the interview that assess history of psychological conditions may be of 
a personal nature. All such questions will be asked by trained study staff . Appropriate referrals 
will be given as necessary.

Participants in the WLC  group will be contacted at week 8 via phone by a research assistant to 
keep participants engaged and enhance study retention. All wait-list participants will be provided 
with the 16 -week intervention after they complete the end -of-study testing at week 16. Though 
we considered other designs, a wait-list control comparison was selected as it was deemed 
ethical, while also permitting a non -intervention comparison and maximizing power to detect 
differences between groups.  
 
Weight loss  
Risk of Gallstones : Rapid weight loss may increase the risk of gallstones.  Symptoms of gallstones 
include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills.  The risk of gallbladder disease will 
be reduced by limiting weight loss to no more than 3 pounds per week for 4 c onsecutive weeks.  
 
Risks of MRI  
Flying objects : The known risks associated with this study are minimal. Implanted medical devices 
and metallic foreign fragments inside a participant’s body may pose a risk if the participant were 
to enter the MRI magnet room. The greatest risk is a magnetic object flying through the air toward 
the magnet and hitting someone. To reduce this risk, we require that all people involved with the 
study remove all metal from their clothing and all metal objects from their pockets. No metal 
objects are allowed to be brought into the magnet room at any time. In addition, once participants 
are in the magnet, the door to the room will be closed so that no one inadvertently walks into the 
magnet room.  
Magnetic fields health risks:  There is no known health risk associated with exposure to magnetic 
fields during an MRI.  
Discomfort.  Some people become uncomfortable or claustrophobic (fearing the enclosed space) 
while inside the scanner. Fatigue, anxiety and discomfort are potential adverse effects associated 
with the fMRI study. There are minimal risks from the loud noise associated with the MRI scanner 
and from the discomfort of lying on a hard surface. We will attempt to minimize these risks by 
familiarizing participants with the personnel and setting, and by closely monitoring them during 
the study. In our experience, pa rticipants who are well informed of the purpose of the study and 
who are accompanied throughout the procedures by a responsible member of the research team 
tolerate the testing well and without complications. Tests are administered by trained and 
supervise d personnel and participants are debriefed after each session. Exposure to radiation 
with magnetic resonance measurements is far less than that resulting from a single X -ray. 
Thousands of patients have been safely studied at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania 
using magnetic resonance techniques. However, some individuals become uncomfortable or 
claustrophobic while inside the magnet. Participants who are uncertain whether they can tolerate 
the scanning environment can complete a “mock” scan on s imilar equipment prior to the research 
scans.  If participants become uncomfortable during completion of study procedures, they may 
withdraw immediately from the study.  
 
Incidental findings : This MRI is not a clinical scan. It is possible that during the course of the 
research study, the research staff may notice an unexpected finding(s). In the event of abnormal 
findings  are identified by study MRI personnel (e.g., technologists, physicists, image processing 
scientists), the PI (Dr. Chao), will inform Dr. John Detre. Dr. Detre has agreed to be included in 
this study to address safety issues and incidental findings for this stu dy. The participant will be 
contacted and Center Staff will arrange for the images to be sent to participants and/or their 
physician. These possible finding(s) may or may not be significant and may lead to anxiety about

a person’s condition and to further work -up by a physician.   
 
Pregnancy:  Although there are no known risks related to MRI on pregnant women or a fetus, there 
is a possibility of yet undiscovered pregnancy related risks. Since there is no possible benefit from 
participating in this protocol for a pregnant woman, we will exclude  pregnant women. At fMRI 
scans, participants will be asked to attest to pregnancy status. Participants who are unsure or 
who believe that they may be pregnant will be given a urine pregnancy test.  
 
Computer tasks. There are no known risks associated with the computer tasks the participant will 
be asked to perform during the study. Participants could become tired when performing them.  
 
During MRI scans, participants have occasionally reported tingling or twitching sensations in their 
arms or legs. Further, because of the strong magnetic field, participants with pacemakers, certain 
metallic implants, or metal in the eye cannot participate  in this study. These exclusions will be 
reviewed carefully with the research technician prior to scanning. Although there are no known 
risks of MRI on pregnant women or the fetus, there is a possibility of yet undiscovered pregnancy 
related risks.  
 
Loss of Confidentiality Risk  
Because information about participant’s identity will be collected and stored for research 
purposes, there is a chance that the information could be viewed by others not associated with 
the research team and therefore, there is a potential for loss of conf identiality. The study team will 
work to uphold the privacy of the participants in several ways. Communications made among 
study staff regarding participants will use ID numbers only and never include names or other 
personal information. All participant da ta and recordings will be kept in locked files. In all data 
sets, we will use ID numbers only. A separate dataset linking names with ID numbers will be 
accessible only by the primary study investigators.  
 
If unforeseen risks are seen, they will be reported to the Office of Research Integrity and 
Compliance.  
13.2 Benefits  
All participants who enroll in this study will receive the WW program including access to the in -
person workshops  and digital tools. B ased on results of previous studie s, we expect participants 
to lose a n average of approximately  5% of their initial weight during the 16 -week treatment 
program  and have improvements in their eating behaviors and physical activity.  Weight losses of 
this size may be associated with improvements in medical conditions made worse by excess 
weight including pre -diabetes (high blood sugar), high blood pressure, and high triglyceride levels. 
Participants will undergo assessment and monitoring of several health factors including weight 
and blood pressure. These results will be made available to participants .  Despite all of these 
potential benefits, there is no guarantee that participants  will lose weight or get any medical 
benefits from this study.  This study may also benefit society at large by providing information 
about the effectiveness of a behavioral weight loss program  on brain changes related to food cue 
responsiveness and memory.  
13.3 Risk Benefit Assessment  
The benefits of this research to the subjects studied, and to society at large, far surpass the risks. 
We believe that this study poses minimal risk to participants, while providing potential benefit to 
women with obesity. The treatments and procedures use d in this study have been shown to be 
relatively safe. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated the safety of MRI scans and efficacy 
of WW for obesity . Research staff will monitor subjects closely during their participation. We

 8 
anticipate that after  the WW  treatment participants will have improvements in their eating, physical 
activity, and weight . Results of this study hold promise of significantly improving the management 
of obesity and its associated complications.  
13.4 Informed Consent Process / HIPAA Authorization  
 
Following the screening telephone call, trained clinical assessors will meet in person with all 
potential participants to describe the study, its requirements, and its likely risks and benefits. 
Participants will be provided a written copy of the Consent F orm/HIPAA Authorization at this 
meeting and will be given an opportunity to read it and have all of their questions answered. 
Persons who wish to participate in the study will be asked to give their written consent at the time 
of consent discussion and wil l then continue with the screening visit. Participants will also be 
permitted to discuss the consent form and procedures and return the signed form and continue 
with the screening at a later date (within 2 weeks ), if they prefer. Participants will be told that they 
can contact the Principal Investigator at any time if they have questions about the study. The 
study team member who reviews the consent document will emphasize that participation in the 
study is volun tary and that medical care will not be influe nced by the participants decision to 
participate or not. The consent process will take place in a private office or exam room to help 
protect subject privacy. Subject comprehension of the nature of the study will be assessed using 
interactive conservation methods (e.g., asking the potential subject to paraphrase different points 
of discussion, asking open -ended questions, encouraging questions).  
13.4.1  Waiver of Written Documentation of Consent  
 
We are requesting a waiver of the requirement to obtain a signed consent form for the phone 
screening. The only record linking the subject and the research would be the consent document 
and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach  of confidentiality. Each 
subject will be asked whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the 
research, and the subject's wishes will govern.  
14 Study Finances  
14.1 Conflict of Interest  
All University of Pennsylvania Investigators will follow the University of Pennsylvania Policy on 
Conflicts of Interest Related to Research .  
14.2 Subject Stipends or Payments  
 
Participants will be compensated $100 for each fMRI scan, $10 to help with travel costs to each 
of the 16 study intervention visits, and $25 for the week 8 study visit.  The total compensation if 
all study visit s are completed is $385. No extra compensation will be provided for changes due 
to COVID -19.

Title of Study: A 52 -Week Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Parallel- Group Efficacy and Safety Study of 
Reslizumab  110 mg Fixed, Subcutaneous Dosing in Patients with Uncontrolled Asthma and Elevated Blood 
Eosinophils  
Sponsor:  Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Inc   
IND Number:  101,399   EudraCT Number:  2015- 000865- 29 
Name of Active Ingredient : Reslizumab  
Name of Investigational Product:  Reslizumab  for subcutaneous injection, 1 10 mg/mL  
Phase of Clinical Development:  3 
Number of Investigational Centers Planned: ~275  
Countries Planned: ~30   
Planned Study Period:  Q3 2015 to Q3 2017  
Number of Patients Planned: Approximately 225 patients per treatment group  for a total of 4 50 patients.  
Study Population: Asthma patients 12 years of age and older  (Patients 12 to <18  years of age are excluded from 
participating in South Korea an d Argentina, and patients 66 years of age and older are excluded from participating in 
South Korea.)  
Primary Objective: The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of reslizumab (110  mg) 
administered subcutaneously every 4  weeks on clinical asthma exacerbations (CAEs) in adults and adolescents with 
asthma and elevated blood eosinophils who are inadequately controlled on standard- of-care asthma therapy.  
Secondary Objectives:  Secondary efficacy objectives are to evaluate the effects of reslizumab compared with 
placebo on a range of clinical markers of asthma control including pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in 
1 second [FEV 1]). 
Other Objectives : Other objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics  (PK) , 
pharmacodynamics , and immunogenicity of reslizumab.  
Study Endpoints:   
Primary Efficacy Endpoint :  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the frequency of CAEs per patient during the 52 -week treatment period.  
For this study, a CAE is defined as a clinically judged deterioration in asthma control as determined by the investigator and as evidenced by new or worsening asthma signs or symptoms based on the patient history, asthma control diary, physical examination, and/or ambulatory or clinic visit assessment of lung f unction and  
that results in a medical intervention, including at least 1 of the following:  
• use of systemic corticosteroids (oral or injection) or at least a doubling  from a stable maintenance oral 
corticosteroid dose for at least 3  days 
• asthma -specific hos pital admission  
• asthma -specific emergency department visit  
Additional medication and/or medical intervention that would satisfy the CAE definition occurring within 7 days of the last day of a prior CAE event will be considered as part of the same event for  analysis purposes.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint s:  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows:  
• change in pre -bronchodilator FEV 1 from baseline/the day of randomization (DoR) at  week 52  
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 C38072- AS-30025 
 9  • change in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire for patients 12  years and older (AQLQ  +12) score 
from baseline/DoR at  week 52  
• change in 6- item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ -6) score from baseline/DoR at  week  52 
• change in total asthma symptom scores (day and night) from baseline at week 52  
• percentage of asthma control days from baseline/DoR to week 52 
• change in St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) score  from baseline/DoR at  week 32 
• time to first CAE  during the 52 -week treatment period  
• frequency of exacerbations requiring hospitalization or emergency department visits per patient during 
the 52 -week treatment period  
• frequency of moderate exacerbations defined as exacerbations requiring additional asthma controller 
medication that was not a systemic corticosteroid and that did not result in an asthma -specific 
hospi talization or emergency department visit during the 52 -week treatment period  
Tar
get Biomarker Endpoints : The target biomarker endpoints are the blood eosinophil counts at 
baseline/DoR; weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 32, 52 or early withdrawal; and the follow -up visit  (approximately 
week  64).  
Immunogenicity Endpoints: Samples for immunogenicity assessment for development of anti -drug antibodies 
will be obtained before  the administration of study drug at DoR; weeks 4, 16, 32, 52 or early withdrawal; and 
the follow -up visit  (approximat ely week  64). An additional sample will be obtained at the late follow -up visit 
(approximately week 76).  
Pharmacokinetic Endpoints: The PK endpoints are the serum reslizumab concentrations at baseline/DoR; 
weeks 1 ( patients in US study centers only), 2, a nd prior to study drug administration at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 
32, 48, 52 or early withdrawal; and the follow -up visit  (approximately week  64). An additional PK sample will 
be taken at long term follow -up (approximately week 76) at the same time for anti-drug antibody ( ADA) sample 
collection . (These data may be presented in a clinical study report addendum.)  

 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 C38072- AS-30025 
 10  Sa
fety Endpoints  
The safety endpoints for this study are as follows:  
• adverse events throughout the study  
• vital signs (pulse, respiratory rate, and blood pressure) throughout the study  
• concomitant medication usage throughout the study  
• physical ex amination findings throughout the study  
• clinical laboratory evaluations at screening, baseline/DoR, and periodically throughout the study  
• electrocardiogram ( ECG ) evaluation at screening and week 24, 36, and 52 or early withdrawal  
General Design and Methodo logy:  This is a 52 -week, Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of reslizumab, at a fixed dose of 110 mg, administered 
subcutaneously every 4 weeks in patients aged 12 years  and older  with asthma and elevated blood eosinophils, who 
are inadequately controlled on at least a medium  total daily  ICS dose and a second  asthma controller. Evidence of 
inadequate asthma control will include a history of at least 2  exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids (oral 
or injection) in the previous 12  months , a suboptimal screening ACQ score ( ≥1.5), and persistent symptoms during 
run-in on the patient’s usual asthma controller regimen.  The study’s d uration is a pproximately 69 weeks, including 
up to a 2-week (±3 days) screening period , a minimum  3-week run -in period, a 52-week treatment period . If the 
patient enrolls in an available open -label, long -term safety study, then adults (age 18 years and older) may wait to 
complete the early and late follow -up visits until the end of the open- label study; however, adolescents (ages 12 to 
<18 years) should complete the early follow -up visit at 12 weeks as part of this current study before starting an 
open -label study.  
At the start of run -in, patients will begin daily self -monitoring at home using an  asthma control diary and PEF meter, 
while taking their usual asthma medications, in order to establish their baseline level of asthma control based on the 
frequenc y of symptoms, use of reliever SABA , nighttime awakenings due to asthma, and ambulatory lung function 
measurement. Improvement in asthma control during the treatment period will primarily be assessed by a reduction in the rate of clinically significant asthma exacerbations with reslizumab versus placebo dur ing the 52 -week 
treatment period. Pulmonary function; AQLQ  +12, ACQ , and SGRQ scores;  asthma symptoms ; use of reliever 
SABA; nighttime awakenings due to asthma ; safety measures ; PK; immunogenicity ; and health care utilization 
events will be assessed period ically ; final assessments will be made at the end of treatment  visit (week  52) or at 
early withdrawal. Patients who withdraw from the study before completing the 52 -week evaluation period will have 
visit-17 (week  52 or early withdrawal ) procedures and assessments performed at their fi nal visit. Patients will return 
12 weeks  after the end of treatment  visit for follow -up hematology, PK,  immunogenicity, and safety assessments . If 
a patient elects to withdraw (or is discontinued from treatment by the Investigator), every attempt will be made to continue the assessments subsequent to their withdrawal from the study  drug.  
Method of Blinding and Randomization: This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled study. Patients 
who meet all inclusion criteria a nd none of the exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to receive reslizumab 
110 mg subcutaneously or matching placebo (approximately 225 patients per treatment group ) in a 1:1  ratio.  
Randomization will be stratified by age (12 to <18 and ≥ 18 years) , and blood eosinophil  levels at screening (300 /μL 
to <400/μL  and ≥400 /μL).
 Patients will be randomly assigned to the treatment groups by means of a 
computer -generated randomization list using interactive response technology after confirmation of all eligibility 
criteria. The sponsor’s clinical personnel involved in the study will be blinded to the study drug identity until the 
database is locked for analysis and the treatment assignment is revealed, with the exception of the bioanalytical group, who will not  be blinded to facilitate PK and ADA sample analysis . Eosinophils and monocytes will be 
redacted from the post -baseline differential cell count reports to avoid the  possib ility of  unblind ing patients . Both 
reslizumab and placebo will be provided as clear s olutions essentially free of particulate matter.  
Study Drug Dose, Mode of Administration, and Administration Rate:  Reslizumab for subcutaneous injection 
will be provided as a sterile solution containing 110  mg (1.0 mL) reslizumab per syringe, formulated at  110 mg/mL 
in  sodium acetate, with  sucrose,  polysorbate 80, pH  5.5 buffer. Reslizumab will be administered 
subcutaneously in a dose of 110 mg (1.0 mL) every 4  weeks . 
Investigational Product: Reslizumab  

 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 C38072- AS-30025 
 11  Reference Therapy:  
Placebo: Diluent so lution administered subcutaneously 
Comparison Drug: None  
Duration of Patient Participation: Approximately 69 weeks, including up to a 2-week (±3 days) screening period, 
minimum 3-week run -in period, 52- week treatment period, and 12- week  follow -up visit . An additional, late follow -
up for immunogenicity testing will be performed 28 weeks (±2 weeks) after the last dose of study drug.  
Criteria for Inclusion: Patients may be included in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria:  
a. Written informed  consent is obtained. A patient 12 through <18 years of age must provide assent, and 
their parent(s) or legal guardian(s) must provide consent.  
b. The patient is male or female, 12  years of age and older , with a diag nosis of asthma. (Patients 
12 to <18 years of age are excluded from participating in S outh Korea and Argentina, and  patients 
66 years of age and older are excluded from participating in South Korea.)  
c. The patient has had at least 2 documented asthma exacerbation s requiring the use of systemic (oral,  
intramuscular, or intravenous) corticosteroids within 12  months of signing the Informed Assent 
Form/Informed Consent Form.  
d. The patient has an ACQ -6 score of at least 1.5 at screening (visit 1).  
e. The patient has a blood eosinophil level of at least 3 00/µL during the screening period (ie, before  
visit 2). (A maximum of 30% of the patients [60 patients per treatment group] with blood eosinophil 
levels of 300/μL to <400/μL will be enrolled. When this 30% threshold has been reached , only patients 
with blood eosinophil levels of ≥400/μL will then be enrolled.)  
f. The patient has an FEV 1 reversibility of at least 12% after administration of i nhaled SABA according 
to standard American Thoracic Society (ATS) or European Respiratory Society (ERS) protocol.  
Documented historical reversibility within 12 months of signing the Informed Assent Form/Informed 
Consent Form is acceptable.   
g. The patient has  required at least a medium total daily inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS) dose based on 
Global Initiative for Asthma  2016 clinical comparability  table (Protocol Appendix A)  for at least 3 
months.  For ICS/LABA combination preparations, the mid -strength approved maintenance dose in the 
local country will meet this ICS criterion.  
h. The patient has required an additional asthma controller medication  (eg, long- acting beta -2-agonist 
[LABA], long-acting muscarinic antagonist [LAMA], leukotriene receptor antagonist [LTRA] , or 
theophylline preparations), besides inhaled corticosteroids , for at least 3 months or a documented 
failure in the past 12  months of an additional asthma controller medication for at least 3 successive 
months.  
i. Females of childbearing potential (not surgically sterile by hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, 
bilateral oophorectomy, or 2  years postmenopausal) must have exclusively same -sex partners or use 
medically acceptable methods of birth control and must agree to continue use of this method for the 
duration of the study and for 5 months after the last study drug dose. Acceptable methods of birth 
control include intrauterine device, systemic hormonal contraceptive (oral, implanted, transdermal, or 
injected), barrier method with spermicide, abs tinence,  bilateral fallopian tube occlusion , and partner 
vasectomy . Contraception is further clarified in an administrative letter in Protocol Section  17.4.1. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 C38072- AS-30025 
 12  j. The patient must be willing and able to comply with study restrictions, perform requisite procedures 
and remain at the clinic for the required duration during the study period, and be willing to return to the 
clinic for the follow -up evaluation as specified in this protocol.  
k. The patient must maintain their usual asthma controller regimen without change throughout the 
screening and run -in periods. A patient who experiences an asthma exacerbation during this time that 
requires additional medication, beyond increased SABA use, will be considered to have failed 
screening/run- in and cannot undergo randomization. A  patient may be rescreened for this reason 1  time 
only. The duration between the date of Screen Failure and the re- screening must be >30  days.  
l. In order to be randomized, a patient must demonstrate the following:  
− inadequate asthma control at baseline/DoR as  evidenced by:  
○ daytime asthma symptom score >0 on >2 of the previous 7 days based on the asthma 
control diary received at run -in OR  
○ need for reliever SABA use on >2 of the previous 7 days OR  
○ ≥1 nighttime awakening due to asthma over the previous 7 days OR  
○ pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 <80% predicted at baseline/DoR  
○  AND  
− completion of at least 4 d ays of d iary entries or equivalent during the last 7 days of run -in. 
A patient may be rescreened for this reason 1 time only.  
Please refer to Protocol Section  3.16.1 and Section  3.16.2  for further guidance on rescreening if the 
above inclusion criteria are not met initially . The eosinophil count and reversibility test may each be 
repeated once during the Screening period , and subjects may also be rescreened for either of these 
reasons. The duration between the date of Screen Failure and the re -screening must be >30  days.  
Criteria for Exclusion: Patients will be excluded from participating in this study if they meet any of the following 
criteria:  
a. The patient has any clinically significant, uncontrolled medical condition (treated or untreated) that 
would interfere with the study schedule or procedures, interpretation of efficacy results, or compromise the patient’s safety.  
b. The patient has another confounding underlying lung disorder (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease , interstitial lung disease , bronchiectasis , eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [EGPA, 
also known as Churg -Strauss syndrome], or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis [ABPA]).   
c. The patient has  a known hypereosinophilic syndrome.  
d. The patient has a diagnosis of malignancy within 5  years of the screening visit, except for treated and 
cured non -melanoma skin cancers.  
e. The patient is a pregnant or lactating woman, or intends to become pregnant durin g the study  or within

 14  Safety Measures a nd Time Points: The following safety measures will be implemented throughout the study 
and evaluated at the following time points:  
• inquiries about adverse events  at every visit including screening, run -in, and follow -up 
• clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry at screening; baseline/ DoR; and weeks 16, 32, and 52 or 
early withdrawal and hematology at screening; baseline/ DoR; weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 32, 52 or early 
withdrawal; and follow -up (approximately week  64) (a sample for CPK measurement only, will als o 
be collected on weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 20).  
• vital signs (respiratory rate, blood pressure, and pulse) at screening, run -in; baseline/ DoR; and weeks 
2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, and 52 or early withdrawal  
• ECGs at screening and weeks  24, 36, and 52 or early withdrawal  
• physical examinations, including body weight measurements. These will include both full physical 
examinations including height and weight (at screening and week 52 or early withdrawal ) and brief 
physical examinations  (at baseline/DoR and weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48).  
• inquiries about concomitant medication usage  at every visit including screening, run- in, and follow -up 
Pharmacokinetics/Biomarkers/  Immunogenicity and Other Ancillary Studies Mea sures and Time Points:   
Pharmacokinetics : Pharmacokinetic samples at baseline/ DoR; weeks 1 (patients in US study centers only ), 2, 
prior to study drug administration at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 32, 48, and 52 or early withdrawal ; and follow -up 
(approximatel y week  64). An additional PK sample will be taken at long term follow -up (approximately 
week  76) at the same time for ADA sample collection . 
Target biomarkers : Blood eosinophils will b e determined from blood samples  at specified time  points . 
Immunogenicity : Serum anti -reslizumab antibodies will be determined from blood samples collected from 
each patient at  baseline/ DoR; prior to study drug administration at weeks 4, 16, 32, and 52 or early withdrawal ; 
and follow -up (approximately week  64). An additional sa mple will be collected at  late follow -up 
(approximately week 76). 
Allowed and Disallowed Medications Before and During the Study: The following medications will not be allowed during this study:  any immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents (excluding s ystemic 
corticosteroids prescribed for asthma and maintenance allergen immunotherapy), all biologic therapies,  and all 
nonbiologic investigational drugs.  
Statistical Considerations:   
Sample Size Rationale:   
Power calculations were based on the below assump tions:  
• Negative binomial  (NB)  distribution for the number of exacerbations with a mean of 2.9  exacerbations 
per patient  per year for the placebo group  
• Dispersion parameter of 1.2  
• Treatment effect of 45% between the reslizumab group and the placebo group 
• Alpha level of 0.05  
Based on the assumptions above, 225 patients per arm ( 450 total) will provide >99 % power to detect significant 
treatment effect of reslizumab over placebo in the reduction of exacerbation rate. The sample size was increased beyond the min imal sample size required to provide 90% power in order to
 allow sufficient number of patients to 
assess safety and immunogenicity  and to ensure adequate enrollment in the adolescent subset. The current sample 
size also provide higher power for other efficacy endpoints.  
Analysis of Primary Endpoint: The primary analysis of frequency of CAEs will use the NB regression model. The primary NB model will include the treatment group, randomization stratification factors, and number of 
exacerbations in the previous year as model factors and an offset variable. The offset variable will be calculated as 
the logarithm of follow -up duration minus the summed duration of exacerbations. The ratio of CAE rate between the 
treatment groups and its 95% confidence interval (CI ) will be estimated from the NB model.  
Data from all randomized patients will be used in the primary analyses regardless of whether they early withdrew from treatment or completed the treatment phase.  
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints: Analysis of pulmonary function tests, AQLQ +12, ACQ -6, total asthma

 15  treatment and visit interaction, baseline value, and stratification factors as fixed effects and patient as  a random 
effect. Analysis of percentage of asthma control days will use an analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) model with 
treatment group and stratification factors.  
Additional covariates or factors may be added to the statistical model.  These will be detailed in the s tatistical 
analysis plan. 
The Kaplan -Meier (KM) method will be used to estimate and compare the distributions of time to first CAEs  
between treatment groups. Differences will be compared using a log rank test adjusting f or the stratification factor s. 
The frequency of exacerbations requiring hospitalization or emergency department visits and the frequency of 
moderate exacerbations will be examined separately.  The analysis will use similar methodology to that described for 
the primary analysis.  
Multip le Comparisons and Multiplicity:  A fixed sequence multiple testing procedure will be implemented to test 
the primary and secondary variables while controlling the overall Type I error rate at 0.05. If the resulting two -sided 
p-value from the primary compar ison is ≤ 0.05, then the next comparison of interest (first secondary variable) will be 
interpreted inferentially at 0.05. This process continues through the secondary variables until either all comparisons of interest are interpreted inferentially, or until the po int at which the resulting two -sided p- value for a comparison 
of interest is > 0.05. At the point where p>0.05, no further comparisons will be interpreted inferentially.  
No multiplicity adjustments will be made for other efficacy and exploratory efficacy an alyses.
 
Analysis of Other Endpoints:  All efficacy variables will be summarized by treatment group. For continuous 
variables, the summary statistics will include n, mean, SD, standard error (SE), median, minimum, and maximum. 
For categorical variables, coun ts and percentages will be provided. Categories for missing data will be presented if 
necessary.  
 
 Reslizumab concentration data will be summarized by treatment group, and blood 
eosinophil count data will be listed by treatment group. An attempt will be made to correlate serum concentrations of reslizumab with measures of efficacy and/or safety. Anti -reslizumab antibody information  will be described for 
subjects who test positive .
  
The baseline for diary variables will be the average of the run -in values over the 7 days preceding baseline/DoR. 
The baseline for clinic visit variables will be the last observed value before  the first dose of study drug. The baseline 
for eosinophils levels analysis will be screening value.  
Safety Analyses: Safety and PK data will be summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group.

Clinical Study Protocol with Amend ment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 27  1. BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
1.1. Introduction  
Asthma is a common, chronic lung disorder character ized by inflammation and narrowing of the 
airways. Symptoms of asthma include cough, breathlessness, and wheezing. The most recent 
estimate s suggest that as many as  334 million people in the world have asthma ( Global A sthma 
Network 2014).   
Asthma is a heterogeneous syndrome with distinct phenotypes and variable severity. Certain 
patients are prone to experiencing asthma exacerbations  defined as an acute or sub -acute 
worsening in symptoms and lung function from the patient’s usual status ( Global Initiative for 
Asthma [GINA] 2014) in patients who are unable to achieve control despite chroni c use of 
inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and other asthma medications . These patients are considered at 
high risk because of the morbidity and potential mortality associated with  exacerbations. During 
acute asthma exacerbations, patients often require additional therapy, such as a course of 
systemic corticosteroids , which have substantial adverse effects ( Walsh LJ et  al 2001, Wardlaw 
et al 2000).  
Interleukin- 5 (IL -5) is the prototypic maturation and survival factor for eosinophilic 
granulocytes, which has been strongly implicated in asthma pathogenesis ( Wardlaw et al 2000 ). 
Eosinophils are major effector cells involved in initiation and propagation of diverse 
inflammatory responses. A high blood eosinophil count is a risk factor for increased future 
asthma exacerbations and excessive sh ort-acting beta- agonist (SABA) use after adjustment of 
potential confounders in adults with persistent asthma, which suggests a higher disease burden in 
patients with asthma and high blood eosinophil counts ( Tran et al 2014, Zeiger et al 2014 ).  
Therapies directed against IL -5 or its receptor (mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab) 
work by reducing eosinophil counts in the circulation and in the airway and have recently met a clinical proof of concept (reduction in asthma exacerbations, improved Asthma Control 
Questionnaire [ACQ] scores, or improved lung function) in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in 
primarily adult populations with asthma and elevated sputum or blood eosinophils ( Castro et al 
2011, Haldar et al 2009 , Molfino et al 2012, Nair et al 2009 , Ortega et al 2014 , Pavord et al 
2012).  
Reslizumab is a humani zed anti -human IL-5 monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin 
G (IgG) 4/κ isotype being developed for the treatment of uncontrolled asthma in patients with 
elevated blood eosinophils. Confirmatory Phase 3 safety and efficacy studies for administration 
of reslizumab by the intravenous (iv) route have concluded the clinical portion; preliminary results are notable for a significant reduction in clinical asthma exacerbations (CAEs) as well as improved lung function. 
1.2. Name and Description of Investigational Product  
Reslizumab (CEP  38072) is a humanized anti-human IL-5 mAb of the IgG4/κ isotype.

 28  1.3. Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies 
1.3.1. Nonclinical Studies   
A correlation between IL -5–induced eosinophilia and pulmonary hyper- reactivity was suggested 
by studies in IL-5 gene knockout mice ( Foster et al 1996). When sensitized and challenged with 
allergen, mice lacking the IL -5 gene failed to develop airway eosinophilia, lung damage, or 
increased lung responsiveness. Otherwise, IL-5 gene knockout mice developed normally and had 
normal antibody and cytotoxic T- cell responses.  
In vivo, reslizumab showed biological activity in several species, including mouse, guinea pig, rabbit, and monkey. Reslizumab inhibited eosinophilia in lungs or skin and reduced airway 
hyper -responsiveness after antigenic challenge in sensitized animals. Inhibition of pulmonary 
eosinophilia was observed for up to 8 weeks post-dose in mice and for up to 6 months in 
monkeys. Reslizumab’s effects on eosinophilia in mice were additive with the effects of prednisolone. 
In single -dose iv toxicity studies with reslizumab, no adverse ef fects were observed at the 
maximum doses administered (500 mg/kg in mice and rats; 1 00 mg/kg in monkeys). In 
repeat -dose studies, reslizumab was well tolerated by mice and monkeys given 2 iv doses of 1, 5, 
or 25 mg/kg reslizumab 14 days apart; the no-obser ved-effect level was 5 mg/kg in male mice 
and at least 25 mg/kg in female mice and monkeys. The 6-month studies in mice and monkeys 
with once-monthly dosing showed no toxicity and a no- observed -effect level  of at least 
25 mg/kg. The no- observed -effect level for evidence of reslizumab -related binding to nervous 
system tissues of monkeys was also at least 25 mg/kg. Reslizumab was not genotoxic and did not affect reproductive parameters. In safety pharmacology studies, reslizumab had no effect on 
parameters related to organ function.  
Nonclinical studies in male cynomolgus monkeys, mice, and rats were performed to assess the 
absolute bioavailability of reslizumab following single and multiple sc doses. It was found that 
absolute bioavailability following sc adm inistration of reslizumab was high (>75%) in all 
species. Subcutaneous administration of reslizumab in these studies was well tolerated. Mild, 
focal, intramuscular macrophage infiltrates were found at the injection site in 1 monkey dosed 
with sc reslizumab . In addition, an acute sc irritation study in rats found that sc administration of 
reslizumab produced minimal to mild gross local tissue irritation. Following sc administration in 
nonclinical studies, approximately 20% to 50% of animals tested positive for anti- reslizumab 
antibodies. The antibody response correlated with decreased serum concentrations in some, but 
not all, of these animals.   
Further details may be found in the current Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.3.2. Clinical Studies  
1.3.2.1. Clinical Pharmacology Studies 
The pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) , immunogenicity, and safety of iv 
reslizumab over the dose range of 0.03 mg/kg through 3  mg/kg have been characterized in 
14 studies in patients and in healthy subjects.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amend ment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 29  Systemic exposure to reslizumab in creases in a dose-proportiona l manner over the range of 
0.03 to 3.0 mg/kg in patients with asthma and from 1.0 to 3.0 mg/kg in patients with nasal 
polyps. Serum concentration declines from peak in a biphasic manner with a mean elimination half-life ranging  from 23 to 30 days. The volume of distribution for reslizumab is low 
(approximately  4 to 6 L), suggesting minimal distribution of reslizumab into extravascular 
tissues.  Following a single 220 mg sc dose of reslizumab in adults, the bioavailability of 
reslizumab is approximately 67%, similar to other mAbs . Peak serum reslizumab concentrations 
are typically observed approximately 7  days after sc administration (range 12 hours to 20 day s). 
As expected, the terminal PK  profile following sc administration is qualitatively similar to that 
observed following iv administration and exhibits a biphasic decline from peak with a long terminal elimination half -life (approximately 26  days).   
Further details may be found in the current Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.3.2.2. Clinical Sa fety and Efficacy Studies  
The P hase 3 BREATH program in adult and adolescent asthma evaluated t he safety and efficacy 
of reslizumab  administered intravenously every 4 weeks at 3 mg/kg  (16-week 
Studies C38072/3081 and C38072/3084, 52- week  Studies C38072/3082 and C38072/3083, and 
open-label safety extension Study C38072/3085) and 0.3 mg/kg (Study 3081 only). A significant 
reduction in the annual rate of asthma exacerbations, and significant improvements in lung 
function, asthma related quality of life, and patient reported measures of asthma control (ACQ and ASUI) were observed for patients with eosinophilic asthma  defined by a screening blood 
eosinophil count of ≥400/µL  (Studies 3081, 3082, and 3083). In asthma patients without elevated 
blood eosinophils (Study 3084), reslizumab produced non-significant improvements in lung function and other measures of efficacy . In contrast  in patients with blood eosinophil levels 
≥400/µL, reslizumab produced significant improvements in lung function and other measures of 
efficacy .  
A total of 2195 healthy volunteers and patients with moderate to severe asthma, eosinophilic 
esophagitis, eosinophilic gastritis, hypereosinophilic syndrome, or nasal polyposis had received 
at least 1 dose of reslizumab in 14 clinical studies.  
The safety of reslizumab was evaluated in adults and in children in clinical studies summarized 
in the current Investigator’s Brochure. S ingle or multiple doses  of iv reslizumab from 0.03 
through 3.0 mg/kg were well tolerated with a common adverse ev ent prof ile similar to placebo.  
The majority of adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity, and most adverse 
events were assessed as unrelated to study drug, as determined by the investigator. Overall, the 
nature and occurrence of the reported stud y drug -related adverse events did not raise any specific 
safety concerns.  
The following summary relates to integrated adverse events data of the 5 asthma placebo -controlled completed studies ( ie, Studies Res -5-0010, 3081, 3082, 3083, and 3084) that 
include the 3 mg/kg iv  dose and every 4 weeks dosing regimen  (up to 52 weeks ). Serious adverse 
event  and death cases from the open -label Study 3085 are also included in the relevant sections.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amend ment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 30  Common Adverse Events  
The most common preferred term s (reported in >5% of patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg 
group) were asthma (232 [23%] and 289 [40%] patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg and placebo 
groups, respectively), nasopharyngitis (103 [10%] and 103 [14%] patients, respectively), upper 
respiratory tract infection  (96 [9%] and 69 [10%] patients, respectively), headache (78  [8%] and 
62 [9%]  patients, respectively), and sinusitis (57 [6%] and 51 [7%]  patients, respectively). There 
were no adverse events in the reslizumab -treated group with an incidence higher than the placebo 
group by at least 1%.  
Serious Adverse Events  
The incidence of serious adverse events was similar in the reslizumab  3.0 mg/kg treatment group 
(6%) compared with  the placebo treatment group (9%). The serious adverse event reported with 
the highest incidence was asthma (preferred terms of asthma, asthma crisis, and status 
asthmaticus), reported by 24 (3%) patients in the placebo group and 24 (2%) patients  in the 
reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group.  
Deaths  
There were 4 deaths in the clinical development plan: one death occurred in a placebo -treated 
patient and 3 deaths occurred in the ongoing open-label study (Study C38072/3085). None of the deaths were considered related to reslizumab.  
Laboratory F indings  
No clinically meaningful changes in clinical laborato ry values, vital signs measurements, 
electrocardiogram (ECG), or physical examination findings were noted in the completed studies with the exception of a decrease in eosinophil counts in the reslizumab groups, which was dose 
related and is expected in vi ew of the mechanism of action of reslizumab. Small decreases in the 
mean values of total white blood cell counts were  also observed in some studies and have been 
assessed as reflecting the decrease in the eosinophil component of differential cell counts . The 
mean values of eosinophil and white blood cell counts returned to baseline values at the end of 
study follow-up visit (4 months after the last dose of reslizumab). 
Adverse Drug Reactions  
Anaphylaxis related to reslizumab infusion has been reported and is considered an adverse drug reaction (ADR ). All cases of anaphylaxis early in the drug development occurred in the 
eosinophilic esophagitis studies and were deemed by the investigator as related to known food 
allergies , and not to reslizumab. T hree infusion- related reactions, reported as anaphylaxis,  
occurred during or shortly after reslizumab infusion in the BREATH studies and were 
characterized variously by skin or mucosal involvement, dyspnea, wheezing, gastrointestinal 
symptoms , and chills. The 3 events were treated at the study site, and patients were withdrawn  
from the study. 
Myalgia (without evidence for muscle injury) was reported at a slightly higher rate in the 
reslizumab 3.0-mg/kg group (1%) than in the placebo group (0.5%) and is considered an ADR of 
reslizumab.

Clinical Study Protocol with Amend ment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 31  Additional Safety Considerations  
Malignancy  
As of February 2015, there were 27 treatment- emergent adverse events reported by 2 4 patients 
related to malignancy for the entire clinical program, including placebo- treated patients . 
Malignancies in reslizumab -treated patients were of diver se tissues ( colon, anal, 
melanoma,  prostate,  breast, lung, plasmacytoma, lymphoma, lung metastasis of a previous 
resected colon cancer, ovarian adenocarcinoma, borderline ovarian tumor, and non- melanoma 
skin ca ncer cases).  
In the asthma  placebo -controlled studies utilizing the 3.0- mg/kg dose , incidence of overall 
malignancies was 6 patients (0.58%; 1 patient had both prostate cancer and skin squamous cell 
carcinoma) in the reslizumab 3.0- mg/kg treatment group a nd 2 patients (0.27%) in the placebo 
group. All malignancies in reslizumab -treated patients were diagnosed within less than 6  months 
from first reslizumab dosing, except for the skin squamous cell carcinoma.  
In the combined placebo-controlled studies and long-term, open- label, safety extension 
Study C38072/3085, malignancies were reported in 21 patients. These included 5 cases of 
non-melanoma skin cancer. Most malignancies were diagnosed within less than 6 months after 
starting reslizumab treatment, and in  5 cases, there was a previous medical history of 
malignancy.  
A thorough analysis of malignancy cases did not suggest a causal relationship between 
reslizumab and cancer risk . 
Infections 
The immune response to parasitic infections may involve eosinophils; therefore, the clinical 
course of existing or new parasitic infections could potentially be complicated by a mechanism 
of action that lowers blood and tissue eosinophils. The iv reslizumab clinical protocols contained an exclusion criterion for patients with active or suspected helminth infestation/infection. The 
asthma Phase 3 studies were conducted in geographic regions in which helminth infections are 
prevalent, including South and Central America, Africa, and Asia. There were no helminth infections rep orted, and no difference was documented between the treatment groups in regards 
to adverse events that could be associated with gastrointestinal helminth infections.   
The overall rate of infection adverse events was lower for reslizumab versus placebo -treated 
patients, with the types of infection events reported consistent with what would be expected in a 
primarily adult patient population with an underlying condition of asthma. No potential 
opportunistic infections were reported. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amend ment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 32  Pregnancy 
The safety of reslizumab in pregnant women or developing fetus has not been studied, but 
nonclinical and clinical studies raised no specific concerns. As of December 2015, there have 
been  10 pregnancies during the entire clinical development of reslizumab, 2 of which occurred 
during the screening period of the study and 8 in patients receiving  reslizumab. All patients were 
withdrawn from the study. Two pregnancies were terminated by  an elective abortion with no 
complications, and 5 led to the birth of full- term infants with no malformations and no obstetric 
or perinatal complications. One male newborn had a neonatal jaundice that was reported as an unrelated adverse event  and was assessed as a physiological jaundice. One  pregnancy case was 
lost to follow -up, and the outcome is unknown. 
Immunogenicity 
Anti-drug antibody (ADA) responses were observed in 3.3% to 11.8% of patients in the 
completed Phase 3 studies in patients with asthma (iv administration every 4 weeks, 
>1000 patients evaluated for ADA). In general, the ADA resp onses were low in titer and often 
transient and were not associated with an effect on reslizumab concentration, eosinophil count, 
or specific clinical manifestations (including hypersensitivity reactions).  
Further details may be found in the current Inves tigator’s Brochure. 
1.4. Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Patients  
Information regarding risks and benefits of reslizumab to human patients may be found in the 
current Investigator’s Brochure . 
1.4.1. Risks of Reslizumab  
Most clinical safety data for reslizumab are based on the experience w ith iv administration of the 
drug. As described in Section  1.3.2, iv reslizumab has been generally well  tolerated over the 
range of doses evaluated (ie, from 0.03 through 3 m g/kg).  Systemic severe reactions (including 
anaphylaxis ) and myalgia are considered as ADRs  of iv reslizumab .  
There are li mited safety data regarding sc administration of reslizumab. In Study C38072/1107 
(Study 1107), 45 healthy volunteers received a single 220- mg sc injection of reslizumab. All 
adverse event s were mild -moderate in severity. There were no deaths, serious adverse events , 
treatment -related adverse events , or withdrawals due to a dverse events  reported in this study . 
1.4.2. Benefits of Reslizumab  
As described in Section  1.3.2, results from clinical studies indicate improved asthma control and 
FEV 1, and a medically meani ngful decreased rate of CAEs  with reslizumab.  
1.4.3. Overall Risk and Benefit Assessment for This  Study  
Improvement in lung function has been confirmed  in 3 Phase 3 clinical trials  with the iv  dosage 
form . In addition to improved lung function, 2 Phase 3 clinical trials demonstrated a significant 
reduction in CAEs  over 52 weeks in patients with modera te to severe asthma and elevated blood 
eosinophils. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amend ment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 33  In completed  studies, reslizumab was generally well-tolerated over the dosage range 0.03 to 
3.0 mg/kg. The majority of adverse events in reslizumab -treated patients were mild to moderate 
in severity , considered to be unrelated to study drug treatment, as determined by the investigator, 
and ( as expected ) associated with underlying asthma disease. There were no significant 
diffe rences in the adverse event profile between patient s treated with reslizumab and patients 
treated with placebo with the exception of the following ADRs: “systemic severe reactions 
(including anaphylaxis)” and “myalgia.” Three anaphylaxis reactions related to reslizumab 
infusions were reported during the BREATH asthma program ; none of t he patient s were positive 
for ADA. All cases resolved with standard treatment, and treatment with reslizumab  was 
permanently discontinued. Myalgia (without evidence for muscle injury) was reported at a 
slightly higher rate in the reslizumab 3.0- mg/kg group  (1%) than in the placebo group (0.5%). 
The protocol includes measures to closely monitor and promptly address these ADRs to mitigate 
any potential harm to patients. 
Consideration of the accumulated data on the clinical effects of reslizumab in patients with 
asthma suggests that patients with elevated blood eosinophils benefit the most from anti-human IL-5 therapy. The safety profile accumulated throughout the clinical development of reslizumab 
suggests that reslizumab would have a favorable benefit -risk pr ofile in treating patients with 
asthma and elevated blood eosinophils whose symptoms remain  inadequately controlled on 
standard of care asthma therapy . 
1.5. Selection of Drugs and Dosages  
A detailed description of study drug administration is presented in Sect ion 5.1. 
1.5.1. Justification for Dosage of Active Drug 
The platform of evidence that supports the range of the reslizumab dose response is based on observed effects on lung function and other clinical endpoints in pati ents with eosinophilic 
asthma (Studies P00290 [0.3 and 1 mg/kg doses], Res-5-0010 [3-mg/kg dose], and 3081 
[0.3- and 3-mg/kg doses]), on eosinophil depletion in the blood in healthy subjects (Study 1102 [0.3-, 1-, 2-, and 3-mg/kg doses]) and in the blood a nd affected tissue in patients with asthma 
(Studies I96-350, 3081 and P00290), and eosinophilic esophagitis (Study Res-5-0002 [1 -, 2-, and 
3-mg/kg doses]). Please refer to the Investigator ’s Brochure for summary and comprehensive 
presentation of these data. Briefly, treatment with reslizumab 0.3 mg/kg produced substantially 
smaller and less durable reductions in the number of blood or tissue eosinophils (ie, sputum) than 
doses ≥1 mg/kg. In contrast, the magnitude of reductions in blood or tissue eosinophils at doses ≥1 mg /kg (ie, 1, 2, or 3 mg/kg) were slight. Improvements for patients in the reslizumab 
0.3 mg/kg treatment group for FEV
1 were 0.129 L at week 16 (p=0.0481), but other efficacy 
endpoint results were more variable (eg, no treatment effect on FVC and FEF 25%-75% was 
observed for patients in the reslizumab 0.3 mg/kg treatment group). Therefore, doses of 
≥1 mg/kg are anticipated to be clinically effect ive in most patients.  Based on these clinical and 
eosinophil pharmacodynamic data, Teva has chosen reslizu mab 110 mg administered every 
4 weeks as the fixed dose to study in the sc program. This approximates a 1 mg/kg iv dose for the average patient (ie, 7 0 kg) when adjusted to account for sc  bioavailability (ie, 67%, as 
determined by Study 1107). Modeling and simulation demonstrate that steady -state trough serum 
concentrations of reslizumab following administration of the proposed 110 mg sc dosing regimen are expected to fall within the range of exposures that produced meaningful effects on both blood 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amend ment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 34  eosinophils and FEV 1 in patients with eosinophilic asthma. Therefore, a fixed dose of 110 mg sc 
every 4 weeks is anticipated to provide sufficient  efficacy.  
1.5.2. Justification for Use of Placebo 
A placebo control design is scientifically appropriate because placebo will be compared against 
reslizumab added on to an established treatment regimen. Patients will not be taken off their 
standard of care asthma therapy fo r this study.  
1.6. Compliance Statement  
This study will be conducted in full accordance with the International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Consolidated Guideline (E6) and any 
applicable national and local laws and regulations (eg, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations 
[21CFR] Parts 11, 50, 54, 56, 312, and 314, European Union Directive 2001/20/EC on the approximation of the laws, regulations, and administrative provisions of the Member States 
relating to the implementation of GC P in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for 
human use). Any episode of noncompliance will be documented. 
The investigator is responsible for performing the study in accordance with this protocol and the 
applicable GCP guidelines referenced above for collecting, recording, and reporting the data 
accurately and properly. Agreement of the investigator to conduct and administer this study in accordance with the protocol will be documented in separate study agreements with the sponsor 
and other forms as required by national authorities in the country where each investigational 
center is located.  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring the privacy, health, and welfare of the patients during 
and after the study and must ensure that trained p ersonnel are immediately available in the event 
of a medical emergency. The investigator and the applicable study staff must be familiar with the 
background and requirements of the study and with the properties of the study drug(s) as described in the Investigator’s Brochure or prescribing information.  
The principal investigator at each investigational center has the overall responsibility for the 
conduct and administration of the study at that center and for contacts with study management, 
with the Indepe ndent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (IEC/IRB), and with local 
authorities.  
1.7. Population To Be Studied  and Justification  
The study will enroll male and female patients, 12 years of age  and older , with asthma and 
elevated blood eosinophils who are inadequately controlled on at least a medium total daily ICS 
dose and a second asthma controller . (Patients 12  to <18 years of age are excluded from 
participating in South Korea and Argentina, and patients 66 years of age and older are excluded 
from part icipating in South Korea.) Adolescents are included in this study because they follow 
the same treatment recommendations as adults according to widely cited asthma guidelines (GINA 2014, ERP -3 2007). E levated b lood eosinophils have been associated with poor asthma 
control and increased risk of exacerbation  (Tran et al 2014, Zeiger et al 2014 ).

 39  3. STUDY DESIGN 
3.1. General Design and Study Schema  
This is a 52-week, Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of reslizumab, at a fixed dose of 110 mg , administered sc every 
4 weeks in patients aged 12 years and older with asthma and elevated blood eosinophils, who are 
inadequately controlled on at least a medium total daily ICS dose and a second asthma controller.  
Evidence of inadequate asthma control will include a history of at least 2 exacerbations requiri ng 
systemic corticosteroids  (oral or injection) in the previous 12 months, a suboptimal screening 
ACQ-6 score ( ≥1.5), and persistent symptoms during run-in on the patient’s usual asthma 
controller regimen. At least one of the historical exacerbations must have been previously 
documented in the medical or pharmacy record; additional exacerbations may have be en 
docum ented in either t he medical or pharmacy record, or may be documented by the study site at 
the time of screening history. For all exacerbations , which fulfill inclusion criterion ‘c’, the 
approximate dates of systemic corticosteroid therapy and the name of the systemic corticosteroid 
taken should be recorded in source documents. The study consists of a screening period of up to 2 weeks to satisfy essential screening inclusion criteria (ie, confirmation of asthma with elevated 
blood eosinophils), a minimum 3- week run -in period on usual care to establish the patient’s 
baseline level of control and a 52 -week do uble- blind treatment period . If the patient enrolls in an 
available open -label, long-term safety study, then adults (age 18 years and older) may wait to 
complete the early and late follow -up visits until the end of the open- label study; however, 
adolescents (ages 12 to <18 years) should complete the early follow-up visit at 12 weeks as part 
of this current study before starting an open- label study.  
Patients  will begin screening up to approximately 5 weeks (±1 week) before DoR . During the 
screening period, a signed and dated informed consent form (and an assent form for children ages 12 through <18  years of age in accordance with local standards) will be obtained before a 
diagnosis of asthma is confirmed on the basis of patient history and by demonstration of airway reversibility. The patients will also be asked about their asthma medication compliance and to demonstrate their inhaler use technique. If the inh aler use technique is not optimal, patients will 
be taught the appropriate inhaler use technique during the screening period and should be 
reassessed before  run-in. The patient will also have a complete blood count determined. If the 
patient’s eosinophil count is 300 eosinophils/μL or greater, and if the patient’s medication 
compliance and inhaler use technique are optimal, the patient will be eligible to continue in the 
study. Patient medical history, 12- lead ECG, physical examination, hematology and chemistry 
tests, urinalysis, vital signs measurements, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin serum pregnancy 
test (for all females of childbearing potential), and concomitant medication history will also be assessed at screening.  
To be eligible to enroll in the study, a pat ient will have an ACQ -6 score of at least 1.5, airway 
FEV
1 reversibility of at least 12% to beta -agonist administration, blood eosinophil count of at 
least 3 00/μL, and a current fluticasone propionate dosage of at least a medium total daily ICS 
dose with a second asthma controller and will have met all the inclusion and none of the 
exclusion criteria  at screening . The goal is to recruit a maximum of 30% of the  patients 
(60 patients per treatment group) with eosinophil levels of 300/μL to <400/μL.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amend ment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 40  Patients who meet screening eligibility requirements will return to the research facility 3 weeks 
before  baseline/DoR  to confirm eligibility and begin the run -in period. At the start of run-in, 
patients will begin daily self-monitoring at home using an asthma control diary and PEF meter, 
while taking their usual asthma medications, in order to establish their baseline level of asthma control based on the frequency of symptoms, use of reliever SABA , nighttime awakenings due to 
asthma, and ambulatory lung function measurement. Improvement in asthma control during the 
treatment period will primarily be assessed by a reduction in the rate of clinically significant 
asthma exacerbations with reslizumab versus placebo over the 52- week treatment period . 
Pulmonary function; AQLQ +12, AC Q, and SGRQ scores; asthma symptoms; use of reliever 
SABA ; nighttime awakenings due to asthm a; safety  measures ; PK; immunogenicity; and health 
care utilization events will be assessed periodically; final assessments will be made at the EOT  
visit (week  52) or at early withdrawal. Patients who withdraw from the study before completing 
the 52-week evaluation period will have visit- 17 (week  52 or early withdrawal) procedures and 
assessments performed at their final visit. Patients will return 12 weeks  after the EOT visit for 
follow-up hematology, PK, immunogenicity, and safety assessments. An additional, late 
follow- up for immunogenicity testing will be p erformed 28 weeks (±2 weeks) after the last dose 
of study drug (ie, approximately week 76). 
The assessments and procedures performed during each study visit are detailed in Table 2 and 
Section  3.16. If a patient elects to withdraw (or is discontinued from treatment by the 
Investigator), every attempt will be made to continue the assessments subsequent to their withdrawal from the study (see Section  4.4).  
A total of 450 patients are planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio ( approximately 2 25 patients 
within each treatment group) to receive reslizumab 110 mg  or matching placebo every 4  weeks 
for 52  weeks .
 
The study schema is presented  in Figure  1.

 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amend ment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 42  Area  Rationale 
Primary analysis (measure, variable, time point, 
statistical test)  Reduction in the rate of asthma exacerbations is 
important to patients, health care professionals, and 
payers and constitutes the essen tial claim  
Inclusion of ancillary studies: pharmacokinetics, 
target biomarker/ pharmacodynamics, 
pharmacogenomics, and immunogenicity • Pharmacokinetics and target blood 
eosinophil pharmacodynamics are 
important for correlating with  efficacy 
results, and wil l provide a basis for future 
pediatric dosing. 
• 
 
 
. 
• Immunogenicity assessments are essential 
to understanding the safety and efficacy of 
reslizumab.

3.3. Primary and Secondary Efficacy Measures and Time Points  
A description of the efficacy measures is provided in Section  6. 
3.3.1. Primary Efficacy Measure and Time Point s 
The primary efficacy measure for this study is CAEs , which will be evaluated  at the time points 
indicated i n Table 2. If a patient experiences worsening of his or her asthma symptoms, the 
patient is to call the study center within 48 hours (if possible) to be evaluated for his or her 
asthma symptoms. A diary alert, based  on a sustained fall in peak flow from baseline, will also 
help support the patient’s subjective experience. Procedures and assessments to be performed if 
an unscheduled visit occurs are described in Section  3.16.1. Refer to Section  6.1 for additional 
details regarding the definition of CAE.  
3.3.2. Secondary Efficacy Measures and Time Points  
The secondary efficacy measures for this study include the following . These measures wi ll be 
evaluated at the time points indicated in Table 2. 
• pre-bronchodilator spirometry 
• AQLQ  +12 
• ACQ-6 
• asthma symptoms based on the daily asthma control diary 

 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amend ment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 43  • asthma control days 
• SGRQ 
3.4. Safety Measures and Time Points  
The following safety  measures  will be implemented  throughout the study and evaluated at the 
time points indicated in Table 2. 
• inquiries about adverse events  
• clinical laboratory (serum chemistry  and hematology) tests  
• vital signs ( respiratory  rate, blood pressure, and pulse)  
• ECG s  
• physical examinations, including body weight measurements . These will include both 
full physical examinations including height and weight and b rief physical 
examinations .  
• inquiries about concomitant medication usage 
A description of the safety measures is provided in Section  7. 

 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amend ment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 44  3.6. Pharmacokinetic Measures and Time Points  
Serum reslizumab concentration will be determined from serum samples collected from 
drug- treated  patient s at the time points indicated in Table 2. 
3.7. Target Biomarker Measures and Time Points  
Blood eosinophils will be determined from blood samples collected at the time points indicated 
in Tabl e 2. 
3.8. Immunogenicity Measures and Time Points  
Anti-reslizumab antibody responses will be determined from serum  samples collected from 
drug- treated  patient s at the time points indicated in Table 2. 
3.9. Randomization and Blinding  
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled study. Patients who meet all inclusion 
criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to receive reslizumab 
110 mg sc or matching placebo (approximately 225  patients per  treatment group) in a 1:1 ratio . 
Patients and investigators will remain blinded to treatment assignment during the study . 
Randomization will be stratified by age (12 to <18 and ≥ 18 years ), and blood eosinophil levels at 
screening (300 /μL to <400/μL  and ≥400/μL ). This system is used to ensure a balance across 
treatment groups . The goal is to recruit a maximum of 30% of the patients (60  patients per 
treatment group) with eosinophil levels of 300/μL to < 400/μL.  
The randomization list and treatment will be ass igned to the relevant treatment groups through a 
qualified contract research organization ( CRO ), eg, via Interactive Voice Response System 
(IVRS)/ Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). The generation of the medication list and management of the IRT syste m will be done by a qualified CRO  under the oversight of Teva’s 
Clinical Supply Chain. 
The sponsor’s clinical personnel involved in the study will also be blinded to the study drug 
identity after the run -in period until the database is locked for analysis and the treatment 
assignment is revealed , with the exception of the bioanalytical group who will not be blinded to 
facilitate PK and ADA sample analysis . Eosinophils and monocytes will be redacted from the 
post- baseline differential cell count reports to  avoid the possibility of unblinding patients.  
Each patient will receive either one 1.0-mL sc injection containing 110 mg of reslizumab or one 
1.0-mL sc injection containing sterile placebo solution on each dosing day. Both reslizumab and 
placebo will be pr ovided as clear solutions essentially free of particulate matter.  
3.10. Maintenance of Randomization and Blinding  
3.10.1. Randomization  
Patient randomization codes will be maintained in a restricted access area within Teva Global Biometrics or in a secure manner  with the vendor contracted to create the list.  At the time of 
analysis, when treatment codes are needed, the Teva statistician assigned to the study will make a request to unblind and will receive the unblinded codes. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amend ment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 45  3.10.2. Blinding/Unblinding  
In order to complete the data analysis for PK, it may be necessary to assay samples before 
database lock. If so, the individuals responsible for sample analysis will know which patients 
received study drug and which patients received placebo. The randomization codes will be provided to personnel responsible for bioanalysis according to a process that will be predefined 
in the unblinding plan form (GBP_RD_703_FRM_02) according to Teva Standard Operating 
Procedure ( SOP) GBP_RD_703. The form will be signed at the study initiation sta ge by the 
responsible Teva statistician, CRO  statistician , and randomization code generator. After 
authorization has been obtained to release the codes, the randomization code generator at the CRO  will provide the codes directly to the bioanalysis team; th e statisticians (at Teva and the 
CRO ) will not be unblinded. Personnel responsible for bioanalysis will not have access to 
clinical safety and efficacy data and will provide concentration data to any other personnel who may require it in a manner that will not identify individual patients (ie, a dummy patient identifier will be linked to an individual patient’s concentration data). 
For information about personnel who may be aware of treatment assignments, see Section  3.9. 
These individuals will not be involved in conduct of any study procedures or assessment of any 
adverse events , safety , or efficacy data. 
In case of a serious adverse event or  pregnancy, in which knowledge of the study drug 
assignment is needed to make treatment decisions, the investigator may unblind the patient’s  
drug assignment as deemed necessary, mainly in emergency situations. Individual treatment 
codes, indicating the treatment randomization for each randomized patient, will be available to  
the investigator(s) and/or pharmacist(s) at the study center via the IRT, both via telephone and 
internet. If possible, the sponsor should be notified of the event before  breaking of the code. If 
this is not possible, the sponsor should be notified immediately afterwards, and the patient’s drug code assignment should not be revealed. Breaking of the treatment code can always be performed by  the site without prior approval by the sponsor. 
When a blind is broken, the patient will be withdrawn from the study, and the event will be recorded onto the case report form (CRF). The circumstances leading to the breaking of the code should be fully documented in the investigator’s study files and in the patient’s source 
documentation. Treatment assignment should not be recorded in any study documents or source 
document. 
In blinded studies, for adverse events that are defined as: Suspected, Unexpected, Serious, 
Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) (ie, reasonable possibility; see Section  7.1.4), Global Patient Safety  
and Pharmacovigilance may independently request that the treatment code be revealed (on a 
case- by-case basis) to comply with regulatory requirements.  The report will be provided in an 
unblinded manner for regulatory submission. If this occurs, blinding will be maintained for other personnel (eg, the investigator)  and the patient will not be withdrawn from the study. 
3.10.3. Data Monitoring Committee 
Not applicable.  
3.11. Drugs Used in the Study  
A description of administration procedures is gi ven in Section  5.1.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amend ment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 46  Additional details may also be found in the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure for 
reslizumab .  
3.11.1. Investigational Product  
Reslizumab for sc injection will be provided as a sterile solution containing 110 mg (1 .0 mL) 
reslizumab per syringe, formulated at 110 mg/mL in  sodium acetate, with  sucrose, 
 polysorbate 80, pH 5.5 buffer. The needle shields of the prefilled syringes contain natural 
rubber latex.  
Reslizumab will be  administered subcutaneously at a dose of 110 mg  (1.0 mL) every 4 weeks. A 
more detailed description of administration procedures is given in Section  5.1. 
3.11.2. Placebo  
Placebo will be provided as a sterile solution of  sodium acetate, with  sucrose, 
 polysorbate 80, pH 5.5 buffer, presented as 1 mL per syringe. The needle shields of the 
prefilled syringes contain natural rubber latex. 
Placebo will be administered subcutaneously as a 1.0-mL injection. A mor e detailed description 
of administration procedures is given in Section  5.1. 
3.12. Drug Supply and Accountability  
3.12.1. Drug Storage and Security  
Reslizumab and matching placebo must be stored in a refrigerator at controlled  temperature (2°C 
to 8°C) and should not be frozen and should be protected from light. Reslizumab and placebo 
supplies must be kept in a secure area (eg, locked refrigerator). The site should have a process for monitoring the storage temperature of unused study drug. 
3.12.2. Drug Accountability  
Each study drug shipment will include a packing slip listing the contents of the shipment, a 
temperature monitoring device, and any applicable forms. 
Each investigator is responsible for ensuring that deliveries of study drug and other study 
materials from Teva are correctly received and recorded, handled and stored safely and properly in accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) or local regulations and used in accordance with this protocol.  
A record of study drug accountability (ie, study drug and other materials received, used, retained, 
returned, or destroyed) must be prepared and signed by the principal investigator or designee, 
with an account given for any discrepancies. Empty, partially used, and unused st udy drug will 
be disposed of or returned to the sponsor’s designee. 
3.13. Duration of Patient Participation  and Justification  
This study will consist of up to a 2-week (±3 days) screening period, minimum 3- week run -in 
period and a  52-week double- blind treatment period. Patients are expected to participate in this 
study for approximately 69 weeks. An additional, late follow- up for immunogenicity testing will 
be performed 28 weeks after the last dose of study drug. If the patient enrolls in an available 

 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amend ment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 47  open- label,  long-term safety study, then adults (age 18 years and older) may wait to complete the 
early and late follow -up visits until the end of the open- label study; however, adolescents (ages 
12 to <18  years) should complete the early follow-up visit at 12 weeks as part of this current 
study before starting an open- label study.  See Se ction  12.4 for the definition of the end of the 
study.  
3.14. Stopping Rules and Discontinuation Criteria  
Other than pregnancy, there are no forma l rules for study drug discontinuation in this study. 
During the conduct of the study, adverse events will be reviewed by the sponsor (see 
Section  7.1.5) as they are reported from the investigational center  to id entify safety concerns . 
The study may be termina ted by the sponsor at any time for reasons including, but not limited to 
a safety concern .  
A patient may discontinue participation in the study at any time for any reason (eg, lack of 
efficacy, consent withdrawn, and adverse event) . The investigator and/or sponsor can withdraw a 
patient from the study for reasons including, but not limited to, a change in the medical condition 
or an adverse event that alters the patient’s benefit/risk  (eg, pregnancy, a related severe 
hypersensitivity , or related severe myalgia/muscle event),  a protocol violation or deviation as 
defined in Section  11.1.2 , or noncompliance. 
3.15. Source Data Recorded on the Case Report Form  
All patient data must have supportive original source documentation in the medical records, or 
equivalent, before they are transcribed onto the CRF. Data may not be recorded directly onto the 
CRF and considered as source data unless the sponsor provides written instructions specifying which data are permitted to be recorded directly onto the CRF.  
If data are processed from other institutions (eg, clinical laboratory, central image center, 
electronic diary [eDiary] data), the results will be sent to the investigational center , where they 
will be retained but not entered into the CRF unless otherwise noted in the protocol. These data 
may also be sent electronically to the sponsor (or organization performing data management) for 
direct entry into the clinical database (see Section  13.1). All data from other institutions will be 
available to the investigator . 
The CRFs are filed in the sponsor’s central file.  
3.16. Study Procedures  
Study procedures and assessments with their timing are summarized in  Table 2. Detailed by -visit 
information is provided in the sections following the table. Detailed descriptions of each 
assessment are provided in Section  6 (effica cy assessments) , Section 7 (safety assessments) , and 
Section  8 (PK and other assessments).

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 51  V = visit; DoR = day of randomization; PK = pharmacokinetic; EOT = end of treatment; EOS = end of study; TERM = termination; wk, W = week; d  = day; ACQ  = Asthma 
Control Questionnaire; ACQ -6 = 6 -item Asthma Control Questionnaire; CBC = complete blood count; CPK = creatine phosphokinase; CRF = case report form; 
ECG = electrocardiogram; eDiary = electronic diary; PEF  = peak  expiratory flow; IP  = investigational product; HCU = health care utilizations;  AQLQ +12 = Asthma Quality of 
Life Questionnaire for patients 12  years and older;  SGRQ = St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire; 
 ADA = anti -drug antibody; HIV  = human immunodeficiency virus; FEV 1 = forced expiratory volume in 1 second.  
a The screening visit (visit 1) will take place approximately 5 weeks (±1 week) before the baseline/DoR visit. It is understood  that not all procedures can be completed on the same 
day. In particular, the patient may need to return to satisfy the medication hold for screening pre -bronchodilator FEV1 (see note “k” for timing).  
b A minimum of  3 weeks run-in (extension allowed up to 4 weeks) on stable doses of the patient’s usual asthma medication is required to establish a base line level of control 
before randomization.  
c Diary contr ol inclusion must be met at baseline/DoR in order for the patient to be randomized. If the control criteria are not met, the patient should not be randomized and should 
be discontinued at that time; the run -in may only be extended up to 4 weeks.  
d Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin serum pregnancy tests will be performed at screening (female patients who are not 2 years postmenopausal or surgically sterile only). Urine 
pregnancy tests will be performed at baseline/DoR, before study drug injection at each administration visit and at week 52, or early withdrawal, and at fo llow-up V18. Pregnancy 
tests are not required for female patients who are 2 years postmenopausal or surgically sterile.  
e The blood eosinophil count must meet the ≥300/μL inclusion criterion during the screening period. Given the known variability  in this measure, the eosinophil count may be 
repeated once during screening (total of 2 attempts), at the discretion of the Inves tigator, in order to fulfill this inclusion criterion.  
f CPK is collected with serum chemistry tests at scheduled visits. If a potentially clinically significant CPK level (≥3.1 × UL N) is reporte d, initiate the CPK/myalgia CRF and 
clinical monitoring as outlined in Protocol Section 7.1.7.2.  
g CPK measurement only. CPK will be collected with PK sample.  
h Physical examination, vital signs, and ECG should be obtained before spirometry procedures and IP administration.  
i Patients aged 21 years and over will have their height and weight assessed at screening only. Patients aged 12 to 21 years will have height and weight assessed at screening, wee k 
24, and EOT.  
j A failed reversibility test may be repeated once, wit hin the 2 -week (±3 days) screening period. Reversibility testing will be confirmed before entering the run -in period. 
Documented historical reversibility within 12 months of signing the Informed Assent Form/Informed Consent Form is acceptable as per inclus ion criterion f.  
k Pre- bronchodilator spirometry assessments should only be performed after withholding short -acting bronchodilators (ie, inhaled short -acting beta-adrenergic agonists and/or 
short-acting anticholinergics) for at least 6 hours and long -acting bronchodilators (ie, inhaled long -acting beta-adrenergic agonists and long acting anticholinergic agents) for at 
least 12 or 24 hours, according to their labeled dose schedule. Spirometry should be performed prior to IP administration, if applicable.  
l The ACQ will be completed by the patient at the clinic. ACQ should be completed through question 6. NOTE: The screening V1 AC Q-6 score  must be ≥1.5 in order to continue 
in this study. A screening visit ACQ score <1.5 may not be repeated and the patient should be screen -failed at that time.  
m If a patient experiences worsening o f his or her asthma symptoms, the patient is to call the study center within 48 hours (if possible) to be evaluated for his or her asthma 
symptoms. A diary alert, based on a sustained fall in peak flow from baseline, will also help support the patient’s su bjective experience. Procedures and assessments to be 
performed if an unscheduled visit occurs are described in Protocol Section 3.16.5.  
n Patients at sites in the United States will return for a  PK assessment at approximately 1 week, which corresponds approximately to maximum plasma drug concentration (Cmax) 
for subcutaneous reslizumab.  
Note: All blood sampling (including hematology and chemistry) will be drawn before administration of IP unless otherwise indicated.  
o Blood for ADA assessment will be collected at baseline/DoR, and other scheduled time points, and upon observation of any seve re hypersensitivity reaction (eg, anaphylaxis).  
Blood for ADA assessment will be collected before dosing, if both occur on the same day. An additional, late follow -up for immunogenicity testing will be performed 28 weeks 
(±2 weeks) after the last dose of study drug (~week 76).  
p Adverse event inquiry will occur before and after study drug administration at V3 to V16. Follow -up any prior messages from the post -injection eDiary symptom inquiry, as 
necessary. For systemic or severe hypersensitivi ty reactions possibly related to the study drug, initiate the anaphylaxis CRF. When such reactions are observed after study drug 
administration in the clinic, vital signs must be monitored using the unscheduled vital signs CRF. At the time of myalgia/mus cular adverse events, CPK should be collected 
(initiate myalgia CRF).  

 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 52  3.16.1. Procedures for Screening and Start of Run -In Period  (Visit s 1 and 2 ) 
A signed and dated informed consent form will be obtained from all patients 18 years of age or 
older before screening procedures commence  (see Section  12.1). For patients 12 through 
<18 years of age, a signed and dated informed consent form will be obtained from each 
parent/legal guardian, and a signed and dated assent form will be obtained from each patient before screening procedures commence, according to local IEC/IRB  requirements. Evaluations 
obtained as part of routine medical care and performed during the screening period may be used 
in place of the study- specific evaluati ons. In addition, disease- specific assessments performed 
before  informed consent may be used for the study . Patients 18  years of age or older and 
parents/legal guardians  for patients 12 through <18 years of age  will acknowledge and agree to 
the possible use of this information for the study by giving informed consent. 
After informed consent is obtained, patients who are screened will be assigned an 8- digit 
permanent identification number such that all patients from each investigational center  are given 
consecutive identification numbers in successive order of inclusion. The first 2 digits of the 
screening number will be the number assigned to the country where the investigational center  is 
located, the next 3  digits will be the designated investigator center  number, and the last 3 digits 
will be assigned at the investigator center (eg, if the number assigned to the country is 01, the 
3
rd patient screened at center  5 would be given the number of 01005003). 
Patients who do not initially meet the eosinophil or s pirometry/reversibility criteria during the 
Screening period may have these tests repeated once, prior to excluding the subject from further 
study participation.  A patient who is screened but not randomized ( eg, because entry criteria 
were not met or enro llment did not occur within the specified time ), may be considered in the 
future for screening again , once more, if, eg,  there is a change in the patient’s medical 
background or a modification of study entry criteria. The duration between the date of Screen 
Failure and re-screening must be >30  days.  
The screening visit (visit 1) will take place approximately 5  weeks (±1 week)  before the 
baseline/DoR visit. The following procedures will be performed at visit 1: 
• Obtain written informed consent before any othe r study -related procedures are 
performed . 
• Review medical history . 
• Review medication history . 
• Review inclusion/exclusion criteria . 
• Perform serum pregnancy testing (female patients who are not 2 years postmenopausal or surgically sterile). 
• Perform clinical laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, urinalysis). Only those patients with an eosinophil count of 300 eosinophils/µL or greater at screening will be eligible to continue in the study . Eosinophil testing may be repeated once during the 
2-week (±3 days) screening period. 
• Perform full physical examination . 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 53  • Perform vital signs measurements (includes systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
pulse, body temperature, and respiratory rate). 
• Measure height and weight. 
• Perform ECG . 
• Complete asthma -specific tests . 
− Perform reversibility testing  if long-acting and short- acting inhaled 
bronchodilators were held for the specified time; if not, the patient should be brought back on another day to complete. Reversibility testing may be repeated once within the 2- week (±3 da ys) screening period. Airway reversibility will be 
demonstrated by measuring the change in FEV
1 before and after inhalation of 
SABA ; reversibility testing should only be attempted after withholding 
short-acting bronchodilators (ie, inhaled short- acting bet a-adrenergic agonists 
and/or short-acting anticholinergics) for at least 6 hours and long- acting 
bronchodilators (ie, inhaled long- acting beta -adrenergic agonists and long- acting 
anticholinergic agents) for at least 12 or 24 hours, according to their label ed dose 
schedule. SABAs , such as salbutamol or albuterol, administered via a metered 
dose inhaler should be used for reversibility testing. Four separate doses (eg, albuterol 360 μg or salbutamol 100 μg ex -valve) should be given by metered dose 
inhaler, as tolerated. Post-bronchodilator spirometry should be completed a minimum of 15  minutes after dosing of SABA . If a patient’s FEV
1 improves at 
least 12% between the 2 tests, then th ey will be deemed as having airway 
reversibility and will continue the screening process.  
− Complete the ACQ-6. 
− Assess asthma exacerbations and related health care utilizations.  
• Collect blood for human immunodef iciency virus (HIV) antigen/antibody , hepatitis B 
surface antigen , and hepatitis C antibody testing . 
• Perform adverse event inquiry. 
• Perform concomitant medication inquiry. 
The start of run -in period visit (visit 2) will take place 3 weeks before the baseline /DoR  visit. 
The following procedures will be performed at visit 2: 
• Review inclusion/exclusion criteria . 
• Perform vital signs measurements (includes systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, body temperature, and respiratory rate). 
• Provide PEF meter to patient. 
• Provide asthma control diary to pati ent. 
• Assess asthma exacerbations and related health care utilizations.  
• Perform concomitant medication inquiry. 
• Perform adverse event inquiry 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 54  For a minimum of 3 weeks after visit 2, patients will continue on their usual asthma medications 
and complete daily  self-monitoring of symptoms using an asthma control diary and PEF meter. 
Level of asthma control will be established based on the frequency of symptoms, use of a SABA, 
nighttime awakenings due to asthma, and ambulatory lung function. 
3.16.2. Procedures Before Study Drug Treatment (Baseline/Day of Randomization 
[Week 0 , Visit 3 ]) 
Patients who  continue to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria at visit 2 will continue to visit 3, 
when baseline/DoR  evaluations will be conducted. 
The following procedures will be perfor med at visit 3 before  reslizumab or placebo 
administration : 
• Review inclusion/exclusion criteria . 
• Perform urine pregnancy testing (female patients who are not 2 years postmenopausal 
or surgically sterile only) . 
• Perform clinical laboratory tests (chemistry  and hematology) . 
• Perform brief physical examination . 
• Perform vital signs measurements (includes systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
pulse, body temperature, and respiratory rate). 
• Perform concomitant medication inquiry. 
• Perform adverse event inquiry. 
• Com plete asthma -specific tests.  
− If patient has withheld inhaled long acting and short-acting bronchodilators for 
the requisite time period, perform pre-bronchodilator spirometry, including FEV 1, 
FVC, and FEF 25%-75%, and post-bronchodilator spirometry, includi ng FEV 1. If 
inhaled bronchodilators were used during the specified withhold window, lung function testing should be delayed until the withhold time is met if feasible, or the visit should be rescheduled. 
− Collect and review daily asthma control diary, and reinforce diary and PEF 
compliance. Patients must meet asthma control inclusion criteria.  
− Complete the ACQ-6. 
− Complete the AQLQ  +12. 
− Complete the SGRQ . 
− Assess asthma exacerbations and related health care utilization s. 
• Collect blood for serum reslizumab concentration determination (PK assessment) 
from all patients . 

 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 55  • Collect blood sample for immunogenicity (ADA) assessment . 
• Collect blood for Phadia top allergy test and total serum IgE ( Vidal et al 2005). 
• . 
A patient who is not randomly assigned to treatment on the basis of results of baseline/DoR  
assessments (eg, because entry criteria were not met or enrollment did not occur within the 
specified time) may be considered for screening again if there is a change in the patient’s 
medical background, a modification of study entry criteria, or other relevant change. A patient who does not complete at least 4 days of diary entries or equivalent during the last 7 days of run-in may also be considered for screening again. A patient may be rescreened for these reason s 1 
time only . The duration between the date of Screen Failure and the re-screening must be 
>30 days. Patients may be screened again if t hey did not meet spirometry/reversibility criteria 
initially , and they may also be screened again if they did not meet the eosinophil criterion during 
the initial Screening . 
Patients who continue to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assigned a permanent unique randomization number and a treatment number generated by  IRT. These two newly 
assigned numbers will be entered into the CRF, and study drug will be dispensed. The following procedures/assessments will be performed during and after administration of study drug: 
• Patients will be observed for 1 hour after study injection/ baseline/DoR assessments  
• Evaluation of injection site for reaction at approximately 1 hour after dosing using the injection site CRF. Clinically significant injection site re actions should be recorded as 
an adverse event.  
• If, during post-study drug observation, the patient develops clinical symptoms, vital 
signs should be collected. The patient should be assessed for 
anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions as detailed in Sectio n 7.1.7. 
Remind the patients that they will receive a post- injection symptom inquiry via the eDiary.  
3.16.3. Procedures During Study Drug Treatment  
3.16.3.1. Double -Blind Treatment Period  
Study drug will be administered at approximately the same time in the morning on the days indicated in Table 2. (Note: Patients must be observed for a minimum of 1 hour after study drug administration.)  
3.16.3.1.1. Week 1 (Pharmacokinetic Visit)  
Patients at sites in the US  will return to the research facility approximately 1 week after 
administration of the first dose of study drug. A blood sample will be collected for serum reslizumab concentration determination  and measurement of CPK  at this visit.  Adverse events, 
concomitant medications, and asthma exacerbations and related health care utilizations  will also 
be assessed.  

 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 56  3.16.3.1.2. Other On -Treatment Visits  (Visits  4 through 17 [EOT] ) 
During the double-blind treatment period, patients will return to the study center  at week 2 and 
week 4 and then  once every 4  weeks (±7 days) thereafter (relative to baseline/DoR ) for 
administration of study drug and assessments until 4 weeks after the final administration of study 
drug (week 52 or early withdrawal). 
The following procedures/assess ments will be performed before  administration of study drug at 
each of these visits, unless otherwise indicated:  
• Perform urine pregnancy testing (female patients who are not 2 years postmenopausal 
or surgically sterile only)  (excluding week 2 [visit 4]). 
• Perform h ematology tests (weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 32, and 52 or early withdrawal only). 
• Perform s erum chemistry tests (weeks 16, 32, and 52 or early withdrawal only)  (a

− If patient has withheld inhaled long acting and short-acting bronchodilators for 
the requisite time period, perform pre-bronchodilator spirometry, including FEV 1, 
FVC, and FEF 25%-75% (weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 32, and 52 or ear ly withdrawal only). 
− Perform p ost-bronchodilator spirometry, including FEV 1 (weeks 16, 32, and 52 or 
early withdrawal only). If inhaled bronchodilators were used within the specified 
withhold window, lung function testing should be delayed until the withhold time 
is met if feasible, or the visit should be rescheduled. If neither option is feasible for the patient, the test may proceed and the deviation recorded. 
− Collect PEF meter (week 52 or early withdrawal only) . 
− Collect and review daily asthma control diary, and reinforce diary and PEF 
compliance (excluding week 2) .

• Evaluation of injection site for reaction at approximately 1 hour after dosing using the 
injection site CRF. Clinically significant in jection site reactions should be recorded as 
an adverse event . 
• If, during post-study drug observation, the patient develops clinical symptoms, vital 
signs should be collected. The patient should be assessed for anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions as det ailed in Section  7.1.7. 
Remind the patients that they will receiv e a post -injection symptom inquiry via the eDiary .  
3.16.4. Procedures After Study Drug Treatment  
Patients who participate in the study in compliance with the protocol for at least 52 weeks of 
double-blind treatment will be considered to have completed the treatment period . Patients who 
complete the follow -up visit ( week 64 ) will be considered as having completed the study. An 
exception to this may be adult patients who enroll in an available open- label , long- term safety 
study and complete the early and late follow-up visits as part of that study. These adult patients 
may be considered as having completed the current study at the time of the 52- week visit (en d of 
treatment period). See Section  12.4 for the definition of the end of the study. 
For patients who complete the treatment period , final evaluations will be performed at the end- of 
treatment /week 52  visit and the follow-up visit.  
Patients who discontinue treatment prematurely must be encouraged to continue to attend the regular scheduled visits, and complete the prescribed safety and efficacy evaluations  through the 
end-of-treatment /early withdrawal  visit and t he follow -up visit, if at all possible  (see 
Section  4.4). 
Patients who both discontinue treatment and also withdrawal from the study should have final 
evaluations performed on the last day the patient receives th e study drug, or as soon as possible 
thereafter.  The patient should also return for the follow-up visit an d procedures if at all possible 
(see Section  4.4).  

 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 58  Procedures for patients who withdraw prematurely from the study are described in Section  4.4. 
Following termination of the study , patients should be treated according to the standard of care, 
and as guided by the P rincipal Investigator. 
Patients with ongoing adverse events or clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results (as 
interpreted by the investigator) will be monitored as described in Section  7.1.2.  
The following procedures/assessments will be performed at the follow-up visit ( EOT + 12 weeks  
±14 days , end of study visit ): 
• Perform hematology tests . 
• Assess asthma exacerbations and related health care utilizations.  
• Collect blood for serum reslizumab concentration determination (PK assessment) from all patients . 
• Collect blood sample for immunogenicity (ADA) assessment. 
• Perform adverse event inquiry.

• Perform u rine pregnancy test . 
3.16.5. Unscheduled Visits  
An unscheduled visit may be performed at any time during the study at the patient’s request or as deemed necessary by the investigator. The date and reason for the unscheduled visit , as well as 
any other data obtained (eg, adverse events, concomitant medications and treatments, and results from procedures or tests), will be recorded  on the CRF and noted within the patient’s source 
notes. 
Procedures performed during unscheduled visits include the following :  
• Perform vital signs measurements (includes systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
pulse, body temperature, and respiratory rate). 
• Perform adverse event inquiry. 
• Perform concomitant medication inquiry. 
• Perform s tudy compliance review . 
Other procedures may be performed at the discretion of the investigator. As outlined in 
Section  4.4, subjects who discontinue s tudy treatment will have all visit 17 procedures performed 
at an unscheduled visit. This visit should be scheduled as soon as possible after the time of 
treatment discontinuation.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 59  4. SELECTION AND WITHDR AWAL OF PATIENTS 
Prospective waiver s (exceptions) from study eligibility criteria to allow patients to enter a study 
are not granted by Teva (see Section  11.1.2). 
4.1. Patient Inclusion Criteria  
Patients may be included in this study only if they meet all of the following criteria:  
a. Written informed consent is obtained. A patient 12 through <18 years of age must 
provide assent, and their  parent(s) or legal guardian(s) must provide consent. 
b. The patient is male  or female,  12 years of age  and older, with a diagnosis of asthma . 
(Patients 12 to <18 years of age are excluded from participating in South Korea and 
Argentina, and patients 66 years of age and older are excluded from participating in 
South Korea.)  
c. The patient has had at least 2 documented asthma exacerbation s requiring the use of 
systemic (oral, intramuscular, or iv) corticosteroids within 12  months of signing the 
Informed Assent Form/Informed Consent Form. 
d. The patient has an ACQ -6 score of at least 1.5 at screening  (visit 1) . 
e. The patient has a blood eosinophil level of at least 300/ µL during the screening  
period (ie, before  visit 2) . (A maximum of 30% of the patients [60 patients per 
treatment group] with blood eosinophil levels of 300/μL to <400/μL will be enrolled. 
When this 30% threshold has been reached, only patients with blood eosinophil levels 
of ≥400/μL will then be enrolled.) 
f. The patient has an FEV 1 reversibility of at least 12% after administration of inhaled 
SABA according to standard American Thoracic Society (ATS) or European Respiratory Society (ERS) protocol. Documented his torical reversibility within 
12 months of signing the Informed Assent Form/Informed Consent Form is acceptable.   
g. The patient has  required at least a medium total daily ICS dose based on GINA 2016 
clinical comparability  table  (Appendix A ) for at least 3 months. For ICS/LABA 
combination preparations, the mid-strength approved maintenance dose in the local country will meet this ICS criterion.  
h. The patient has required an additional asthma controller medication (eg, long- acting 
beta-2-agonist [LABA], long- acting muscarinic antagonist [LAMA], leukotriene 
receptor antagonist [LTRA], or theophylline preparations), besides ICS, for at least 
3 months or a documented failure in the past 12 months of an additional asthma controller medication for at least 3 successive months.  
i. Females of childbearing potential (not surgically sterile by hysterectomy, b ilateral 
salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or 2 years postmenopausal) must have an 
exclusively same- sex partner or use a medically acceptable method of contraception, 
and must agree to continue use of this method for the duration of the study and for 5 
months after last study drug dose. Acceptable methods of contraception include 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 60  intrauterine device (IUD), steroidal contraceptive (oral, implanted, transdermal, or 
injected), barrier method with spermicide, abstinence , bilateral fallopian tube 
occlusion, and partner vasectomy . Contraception is further clarified in an 
administrative letter in Section  17.5.1. 
j. The patient must be willing and able to comply with study restrictions, perform 
requisite procedures and to remain at the clinic for the required duration during the study period, and willing to return to the clinic for the follow-up evaluation as specified in this protocol.  
k. The patient must maintain their  usual asthma controller regimen without change 
throughout the screening and run-in periods. A patient who experiences an asthma 
exacerbation during this time that requires additional medication, beyond increased 
SABA use, will be considered to have failed screening/run-in and cannot undergo randomization. A patient may be rescreened for this reason 1 time only . The duration 
between the date of Screen Failure and the re-screening must be >30 days.  
l. In order to be randomized, a patient must demonstrate the following:  
− inadequate asthma control at baseline/DoR as evidenced by  1 of the 4 criteria  
below: 
○ daytime asthma symptom score >0 on >2 of the previous 7 days based on the 
asthma control diary received at run-in OR  
○ need for reliever SABA use on >2 of the previous 7 days OR 
○ ≥1 nighttime awakening due to asthma ove r the previous 7 days OR 
○ pre-bronchodilator FEV
1 <80% predicted at baseline/DoR  
AND  
− completion of at least 4 d ays of d iary entries or equivalent during the last 7 days 
of run -in. A patient may be rescreened for this reason 1 time only. 
4.2. Patient Exclusion Cr iteria  
Patients will be excluded from participating in this study if they meet any of the following criteria:  
a. The patient has any clinically significant, uncontrolled medical condition (treated or 
untreated) that would interfere with the study schedule or procedures, interpretation 
of efficacy results, or compromise the patient’s safety.  
b. The patient has another confounding underlying lung disorder (eg, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease , bronchiectasis
 eosinophilic 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis [EGPA, also known as Churg-Strauss syndrome], or 
allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis [ABPA] ).  
c. The patient has a known hypereosinophilic syndrome. 
d. The patient has a diagnosis of malignancy within 5 years of the screening visit, ex cept 
for treated and cured non- melanoma skin cancers.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 61  e. The patient is a pregnant or lactating woman , or intends to become pregnant during 
the study or within 5 months after the last dose of study drug. Any woman becoming 
pregnant during the study will be withdrawn from the study. 
f. The patient required treatment for an asthma exacerbation within 4 weeks of screening or during the screening/run -in period. 
g. The patient is a current smoker (ie, has smoked within the last 6 months before  
screen ing) or has a smoking history ≥ 10 pack years. 
h. The patient is currently using any systemic immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory biologic (eg, anti-immunoglobulin E mAb or other mAb or soluble receptors) or other monoclonal antibody [eg, mepolizumab] or soluble 
receptors) or non-biologic (eg, methotrexate or cyclosporine), except maintenance 
oral corticosteroids for the treatment of asthma (up to  and including 10 mg of 
prednisone daily or equivalent). Note: Previous use of such agents that occurred 
>5 half -lives from the initia l screening visit may be allowed, if approved by the 
medical monitor.  
i. The patient participated in a clinical trial within 30  days or 5 half- lives of the 
investigational drug before screening, whichever is longer.  
j. The patient was previously exposed to benralizumab within 12 months of screening. 
k. The patient was previously exposed to reslizumab.  
l. The patient has a history of an immunodeficiency disorder including HIV.  
m. The patient has current or suspected drug and alcohol abuse. 
n. The patient has an active helmi nthic parasitic infection or was tre ated for one within 
6 months of screening.  
o. The patient has a history of allergic reaction or hypersensitivity to any component of 
the study drug. 
p. The patient has a history of latex allergy.  (The current prefilled syringe device has a 
natural rubber component to the needle shield.)  
4.3. Justification for Key Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria select for an asthma phenotype that remains uncontrolled on 
standard of care asthma medications that  may  benefit from a targeted therapy such as reslizumab , 
while also ensuring that enrolled patients are of sufficient overall health to safely participate in 
this study and not assume unnecessary risk. 
4.4. Criteria and Procedures for Discontinuation of Study T reatment 
and/or Study Withdrawal  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (in accordance with the applicable country’s 
acceptance), patients may voluntarily discontinue study treatment ( ie, refuse study treatment but 
continue with study participation ) or completely withdraw from the study ( ie, with no further 
study participation or contact) at any time. The investigator also has the right to discontinue a 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 62  patient from study treatment and/or withdraw a patient from the study in the event of intercurrent 
illness, adverse ev ents, pregnancy (see Section  7.2), or other reasons concerning the health or 
well-being  of the patient, or in the event of lack of cooperation.  
If a patient withdraws consent, every attempt will be made to determine the reason. If the reason for withdrawal is adverse event or a potentially clinically significant abnormal laboratory test 
result, monitoring will be continued until the event has resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a health care professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to 
the study drug or study procedure is made. The specific event or test result must be recorded on 
the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF. 
4.4.1. Disconti nuation of Study Treatment  
If premature discontinuation of study treatment occurs for any reason, the patient should 
continue attending remaining study visits while off study treatment. The patient should not be 
considered withdrawn from the study due to interruption or discontinuation of study treatment. For this study, it is very important to continue collecting data from all patients whether or not they complete treatment.  
If premature discontinuation of study treatment occurs, the patient should return to the clinic as soon as possible for a study treatment discontinuation visit. All evaluations should be performed 
as an unscheduled visit and include all the assessments specified in the protocol for the early 
withdrawal visit (see  Table 2). The investigator must determine the reason for and the date of 
discontinuation of study treatment and record this information in both the source documentation 
and the Study Drug Treatment Completion CRF. The patient’s continued participation in the 
study must be discussed by the investigator and site staff with the patient; the investigator and site staff must also request the patient to continue attending study visits according to the study 
visit schedule with all assessments co mpleted up to week 52 (visit 17). The CAE event status and 
safety assessments at week 52 (visit 17) are the priority assessments for patients that prematurely 
discontinue study treatment. At a minimum, the investigator should make every effort to obtain 
information regarding serious adverse events, CAE events, and survival status at w eek 52. A 
safety follow -up visit (visit 18) should be conducted 12 weeks after visit 17.  
4.4.2. Complete Withdrawal f rom Study  
If a patient decides to completely withdraw from the stu dy (ie, refuses any further study 
participation or contact), all study participation for that patient will cease and all data to be 
collected at subsequent visits will be considered missing. If a patient decides to completely withdraw from the study, the p atient should return to the clinic as soon as possible to complete 
the early withdrawal visit (see Table 2).  A complete final evaluation at the time of the patient’s 
withdrawal should be made, including an explanati on of why the patient is withdrawing from the 
study. The reason for and date of withdraw al from the study must be recorded in the source 
documentation and the Double- Blind Treatment Period Completion CRF.  
For patients who are lost to follow-up (ie, patient s whose status is unclear because they fail to 
appear for study visits without stating an intention to withdraw), the investigator should make 
appropriate efforts to re -establish contact with patient; attempts to contact the patient should be 
documented in the source documents. If contact has not been re-established, efforts should still 
be made to locate the patient and obtain information regarding serious adverse events, CAE

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 63  events, and survival status at the end of the 52-week treatment period. A patient should only be 
designated as lost to follow- up if the site is unable to establish contact with the patient after 
3 documented attempts via 2 different methods (phone, text, e- mail, certified letter, etc).

 64  5. TREATMENT OF PATIENTS 
5.1. Drugs Administered  During the Study  
After successfully meeting entry criteria, eligible patients will be randomly assigned to study 
drug (110 mg of reslizumab or placebo) with stratification based on blood eosinophil count 
(300/μL  to <400/μL  or ≥400/μL ) and age (12 to <18 years or ≥ 18 years) at baseline/DoR , using 
IRT, which utilizes computerized central randomization. Study drug will be administered by 
qualified study personnel as a sc injection every 4  weeks for a total of 13  doses.  Patients within 
each treatment group (placebo and  110 mg) will be randomly allocated to a particular sequence 
of injection sites: 
a. upper arm (A)→abdomen (B)→thigh (C)  
b. abdomen (B)→thigh (C)→upper arm (A)  
c. thigh (C)→upper arm (A)→abdomen (B)  
Study drug will be administered as a single  sc injection containing either placebo (1.0 mL) or 
110 mg of reslizumab ( 1.0 mL ).  
The pre- filled syring e has a staked 27G ½” needle.  Subcutaneous injections can be given at a 90° 
angle or at a 45° angle. The injection can be given at a 90° angle if 2 inches of skin can be 
grasped between the thumb and first finger. If only 1 inch of skin can be grasped, the injection 
should be done at a 45° angle. Product should be removed from the refrigerator and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes before administration.  
Study drug will be administered by qualified study personnel who will ensur e that the study drug 
is administered in accordance with the protocol.  The needle shields of the prefilled syringes 
contain natural rubber latex, which may cause allergic reactions; see exclusion criterion (p) . 
Additional information regarding study drug can be found in the Pharmacy Manual.  
A more detailed description of the reslizumab drug product is provided in Section  3.11. Study 
drug exposure will be measured and compliance to study drug administration will be monitored. 
5.2. Restrictions 
Medications prohibited before and/or during the study are described in S ection  5.3. Restrictions 
in regard to sexual activity and required laboratory values are provided in the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria . 
5.3. Prior and Concomitant Therapy or Medication  
Any prior or concomitant therapy, medication, or procedure a patient has had 4 weeks  before 
study drug administration and up to the end of the study period, including follow-up, will be recorded on the CRF. Generic or trade name, indication, and dosage will be recorded. The sponsor will encode all therapy and medication according to the World Health Organization drug dictionary (WHO  Drug).   
Of note, prior asthma medications such as ICS, leukotriene pathway modifiers, long acting 
bronchodilators, and mast cell stabilizers may be taken concomitantly and should not be altered 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 65  during the study unless patient safety is at risk. Any changes in background maintenance therapy 
must be discussed with the medical monitor.  
The following medications will not be allowed during this study: 
• any immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents (biological and 
non-biological), including, but not limited to methotrexate, cyclosporine, and interferon (excluding sys temic corticosteroids prescribed for asthma and maintenance 
allergen immunotherapy)  
• all biologic therapies, including, but not limited to omalizumab (Xolair
®), 
mepolizumab, benralizumab, lebrikizumab, and anti-tumor necrosis factor monoclonal antibodies 
• all nonbiologic investigational drugs 
At each clinic visit after the screening visit, the investigator will ask patients whether they have 
taken any medications (other than study drug), including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, 
or herbal or nutritional supplements, since the previous visit. Indication, dosage, and start and 
end dates should be entered on the appropriate CRF.  
5.4. Procedures for Monitoring Patient Compliance  
The investigator will be responsible for monitoring patient compliance. If the investigator or the sponsor determines that the patient is not in compliance with the study protocol, the investigator and the sponsor should determine whether the patient should be withdrawn. The IEC/IRB should 
be notified. 
5.5. Total Blood Volume  
The estimated t otal blood volume withdrawn over the entire study (including screening) is 
approximately 120 mL  per patient . To further reduce the volume of blood withdrawn, pediatric 
tubes will be used when possible. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 66  6. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
6.1. Primary Efficacy Measure and Justification   
For this study, a CAE is defined as a clinically judged deterioration in asthma control as 
determined by the investigator and as evidenced by new or worsening asthma signs or symptoms 
based on the patient history, asthma control diary, physical examination, and/or ambulatory or 
clinic visit assessment of lung function AND that results in a medical intervention, including at least 1 of the following: 
• use of systemic corticosteroids (oral or injection) or at least a doubling  from a stable 
mainte nance oral corticosteroid dose for at least 3 days
1 
• asthma specific hospital admission  
• asthma specific emergency department visit  
Additional medication and/or medical intervention that would satisfy the CAE definition occurring within 7 days of the last da y of a prior CAE event will be considered as part of the 
same event for analysis purposes.  
The CAE  start and stop dates will be collected in order to determine the exacerbation duration. 
The start date of a CAE will be  the start date of the initial medical intervention (eg, use of 
systemic corticosteroids [oral or injection] or at least a doubling from a stable maintenance oral 
corticosteroid dose for at least 3 days, asthma specific hospital admission, or asthma specific 
emergency department visit, whichever comes first). The stop date is the last day of systemic corticosteroids or the last day of an asthma -specific hospitalization or emergency department 
visit, whichever is later.  For patients who are on a stable maintenance oral corticosteroid  dose 
and receive at least a doubling of that dose for 3 days, the stop date is when they return to their baseline dose.  For patients receiving a new use of oral corticosteroids or at least a doubling from 
their stable maintenance oral corticosteroid  dose for at least  3 days that did not return to baseline, 
a CAE stop date will be the day that they have been on a stable dose for at least 10 days. 
6.2. Spirometry  
Pre-bronchodilator FEV 1, FVC, and FEF 25%-75% and post-bronchodilator FEV 1 will be measured 
using spirometry. The FEV1 is the volume of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in 
the first second, measured in liters. The  FVC is the volume of air that can be forcibly blown out 
after full inspiration, measured in liters. The FEF 25%-75% is the forced expiratory flow at 25% to 
75% forced vital capacity. For post-bronchodilatory spirometry, SABAs , such as salbutamol or 
albuterol, administered via a metered dose inhaler should be used. Four separate doses (eg, albuterol 360 μg or salbutamol 100 μg ex -valve) should be given by metered dose inhaler, as 
tolerated. Post-bronchodilator spirometry should be completed a minimum of 15 minutes after 
dosing of SABA . Spirometry will be done according to American Thoracic Society/European 
                                                 
1 A single depot corticosteroid injection would fulfill this criterion.

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 67  Respiratory Society  2005 procedural guidelines. The National Health and Nutrition Survey 
(NHANES) III reference equations will be used.  
6.3. PEF Monitoring  
AM (morning) ambulatory and PM (evening) ambulatory PEF will be measured. PEF will be 
measured using a PEF meter. PEF is the maximum speed of exhalation. AM (morning) 
ambulatory and PM (evening) ambulatory PEF will be measured by the patient and recorded in 
the asthma control diary. 
6.4. Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire  for Patients 12 years and 
Older  
The AQLQ +12 is a modified version of the standardized AQLQ, which was developed to measure functional impairments experienced by adults ≥17 years of age. The AQLQ +12 is valid 
for patients aged 12 to 70 years and includes 32 questions in 4 domains (symptoms, activity 
limitation, emotional function, and environmental stimuli) ( Juniper et al 1992, Wyrwich et al 
2011). Patients are asked to recall their experience s during the previous 2 weeks and score each 
of the questions on a 7- point scale where 7 = no impairment and 1 = severe impairment 
(Appendix B ).  
6.5. Asthma Control Questionnaire  
The ACQ is a validated asthma assessm ent tool that has been widely used ( Juniper et al 1999). 
Six questions are self -assessments  (completed by the patient) . Each item on the ACQ has a 
possible score ranging from 0 to 6, and the total score is the mean of all responses ( Appendix C ). 
6.6. Asthma Symptom Assessment  
The asthma symptom score will be determined from the information recorded in the asthma control diary. A Likert -style scale will be used to quantify symptomatology. This scale has been 
used previously to assess changes in asthma symptoms in response to novel asthma treatments (Shapiro et al 2000). Every morning and evening, patients will indicate how much they are 
bothered by their asthm a symptoms , as shown in Appendix G . 
6.7. Asthma Control Days 
An asthma control day is defined as a day on which the patient used ≤ 2 puffs of inhaled SABA, 
had no nighttime  awakenings, and experienced no asthma exacerbations as defined in the 
protocol ( Baumgartner et al 2003, Schulpher and Buxton 1993).  
6.8. St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire  
The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) is a 50- item health status survey specific for 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other respiratory diseases ( Appendix F ; Barr et al 
2000).

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 68  6.10. Asthma Rescue Medication  Use 
The number of times asthma rescue medication (number of inhalations/puffs) is used will be 
assessed by reviewing the asthma control diary. Note: SABA therapy used for exercise 
pretreatment should not be recorded. 
6.11. Nighttime Awakenings  
Patients will record nighttime awakenings due to asthma as indicated in the asthma control diary.  

 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 69  7. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY   
In this st udy, safety will be assessed by qualified study personnel by evaluating the following:  
• adverse events throughout the study 
• vital signs (pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure) assessments throughout the study 
• concomitant medication usage throughout the study 
• physical examination findings throughout the study 
• laboratory evaluations at screening, the baseline visit/DoR , and periodically 
throughout the study 
• ECG at screening and week 24, 36, and 52 
7.1. Adverse Events  
7.1.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient a dministered a pharmaceutical 
product, regardless of whether it has a causal relationship with this treatment.  
In this study, any adverse event occurring after the clinical study patient has signed the i nformed 
consent form should be recorded and reported as an adverse event.  
An adverse event can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, or 
laboratory parameter that develops or worsens in severity during the course of this stu dy, or 
significant worsening of the disease under study or of any concurrent disease, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Asthma exacerbation is an efficacy variable for this study and should be captured on the asthma exacerbation CRF; accordingly, asthma exacerbations 
should not be recorded as adverse events  unless assessed as more severe than the patient's usual 
disease course. In this case, the investigator should determine if the adverse event is nonserious 
or serious based on seriousne ss criteria, as defined in Section  7.1.5. A new condition or the 
worsening of a pre -existing condition will be considered an adverse event. Stable chronic 
conditions (such as arthritis) that are present before study entry and do not worsen during this  
study will not be considered adverse events.  
Accordingly, an adverse event can include any of the following: 
• intercurrent illnesses  
• physical injuries  
• events possibly related to concomitant medication  
• significant wor sening (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of the disease under 
study or other pre- existing conditions   
• drug interactions 
• laboratory or diagnostic test abnormalities that result in the withdrawal of the patient 
from the study, are associated with cl inical signs and symptoms or a serious adverse 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 70  event, or require medical treatment or further diagnostic work-up, or are considered 
by the investigator to be clinically signif icant  (Note: Abnormal laboratory test results 
at the screening visit that preclude a patient from entering the study or receiving study 
treatment are not considered adverse events.)  
7.1.2. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
For adverse event recording, the study period is defined for each patient as that time period from 
signature of the informed consent form through the end of the follow-up period. For this study, the follow-up period is defined as 12 weeks  after the EOT visit.  Adverse events will be collected 
at each visit, including the follow -up visit, via adverse event inquiry.  
All adverse events that occur during the defined study period must be recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF, regardless of the severity or seriousness of the 
event or judged relationship to the study drug . For  serious adverse events , the Serious Adverse 
Event Form must also be completed and the serious adverse event must be reported immediately (see Section  7.1.5.3.1). The investigator does not need to actively monitor patient s for adverse 
events once the study has ended. Serious adverse events that occur to a patient after the end of study should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them, following the procedures described in Section  7.1.5.3.1.  
At each contact with the patient, the investigator or designee must question the patient about 
adverse events by asking an open -ended question such as, “Have you had any unusual symptoms 
or medical problems since the last visit?  If yes, please describe.” In addition, the eDiary will be  
programmed to query the patient about symptoms potentially consistent with hypersensitivity occurring during the 24 hour period following study drug injection. All reported or observed signs and symptoms will be recorded individually, except when considered manifestations of a 
medical condition or disease state . A precise diagnosis will be recorded whenever possible. 
When such a diagnosis is made, all related signs, symptoms, and any test findings wil l be 
recorded collectively as a single diagnosis on the CRF and, if it is a serious adverse event, also 
on the Serious Adverse Event Form. 
The clinical course of each adverse event will be monitored at suitable intervals until resolved , 
stabilized , returne d to baseline, or until the patient is referred for continued care to another health 
care professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug or study 
procedure is made.  
The onset and end dates, duration (in case of adverse event duration of less than 24 hours), action 
taken regarding study drug, treatment administered, and outcome for each adverse event must be 
recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF.  The approximate time of 
onset for each adverse event that start s within 24 hours of study drug administration will be also 
recorded . The relationship of each adverse event to study drug treatment and study procedures, 
and the severity and seriousness of each adverse event, as judged by the investigator, must be recorded as described below.  
7.1.3. Severity of an Adverse Event  
The severity of each adverse event must be recorded as 1 of the choices on the following scale:  
Mild:  No limitation of usual activities  
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 71  Moderate:  Some limitation of usual activities  
Severe:  Inability to carry out usual activities  
7.1.4. Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Study Drug  
The relationship of an adverse event to the study drug is characterized as follows:  
Term  Definition  Clarification 
No reasonable 
possibility  
(not related)  
 This category applies to adverse events that , after careful 
consideration, are clearly due to extraneous causes (disease, 
environment, etc .) or to adverse 
events  that, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are 
evaluated, are judged to be unrelated to the study drug.  The relationship of an adverse event may be considered “no reasonable possibility” if it is clearly due to extraneous causes or if at least 2 of the following apply:  
• It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration o f the study drug. 
• It could readily have been produced by the patient’s clinical state, environmental, or toxic factors, or other 
modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
• It does not follow a known pattern of response to the 
study drug.  
• It does not re appear or worsen when the study drug is 
re-administered .  
Reasonable possibility  
(related)  
 This category applies to adverse events for which, after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, a connection with the study drug  administrat ion cannot 
be ruled out with certainty . The relationship of an adverse event may be considered “reasonable possibility” if at least 2 of the following apply:  
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug.  
• It cannot be reas onably explained by the known 
characteristics of the patient’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors or other modes of 
therapy administered to the patient.  
• It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose. There are important exception s when an 
adverse event does not disappear upon 
discontinuation of the study drug, yet 
a drug 
relationship clearly exists.  
• It follows a known pattern of response to the study 
drug. 
7.1.5. Serious Adverse Events  
7.1.5.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes or actions: 
• death  
• a life -threatening adverse event (ie, the patient was at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred); does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death  
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 72  • inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, which means that 
hospital inpatient admission and/or prolongation of hospital stay were required for treatment of an  adverse event, or that they occurred as a consequence of the event. 
Hospitalizations scheduled before study entry will not be considered serious adverse events, unless there was worsening of the preexisting condition during the patient’s participation in this study. Note: Hospitalizations due to asthma exacerbation will be 
reported as serious adverse events if the presentation or outcome is more severe than 
the patient’s known course of asthma 
• persistent or significant disability or incapacity (refers to a  substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitaliz ation; or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Note: Any suspected transmission of 
an infectious agent via a medicinal product is considered an important medical event 
An adverse event that does not meet any of the criteria for seriousness lis ted above will be 
regarded as a nonserious adverse event.  
7.1.5.2. Expectedness  
A serious adverse event that is not included in the a dverse reaction section  of the relevant 
reference safety information by its specificity, severity, outcome, or frequency is consider ed an 
unexpected adverse event. The reference safety information for this study is the Investigator’s Brochure.  All serious adverse event s will be evaluated for expectedness by the sponsor. 
7.1.5.3. Reporting a Serious Adverse Event  
7.1.5.3.1. Investigator Responsibility 
To satisfy regulatory requirements, a ll serious adverse events (as described in Section  7.1.5.1, 
including the protocol-defined follow-up period, described in Section  7.1.2), regardless of judged 
relationship to treatment with the study drug, must be reported to the sponsor by the investigator. The event must be reported within 24 hours of when the investigator learns about it. Completing 
the serious adverse event form and reporting the event must not be delayed, even if not all the 
information is available.  The investigator does not need to actively monitor patient s for adverse 
events once this study  has ended. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient after the end of 
the study  should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them . 
The serious adverse event form should be sent to the local safety officer ( LSO ) or other 
designated personnel (a CRO in a country without a s ponsor LSO)  (contact information is in the 
Clinical Study Personnel Contact Information section); the LSO will forward the report to the sponsor’s Global Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Department . 
The following information should be provided to record the event accurately and compl etely:  
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 73  • study number 
• investigator and investigational center  identification  
• patient number 
• onset date and detailed description of adverse event 
• investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to the study drug 
(no reasonable possibility, reasonable possibility) 
Additional information may include the following:  
• age and sex of patient 
• date of first dose of study drug 
• date and amount of last administered dose of study drug 
• action taken  
• outcome, if known 
• severity  
• explanation of assessment of r elatedness  
• concomitant therapy (including doses, routes, and regimens) and treatment of the 
event  
• pertinent laboratory or other diagnostic test data  
• medical history  
• results of dechallenge/rechallenge, if known 
• for an adverse event resulting in death:  
− cause of death (whether or not the death was related to study drug as determined 
by the investigator) 
− autopsy findings (if available) 
Each report of a serious adverse event will be reviewed and evaluated by the investigator and the 
sponsor to assess the nature of the event and the relationship of the event to the study drug, study 
procedures, and to underlying disease. The sponsor will also evaluate the expectedness of all serious adverse events.  
Additional information (follow-up) about any serious adverse eve nt unavailable at the initial 
reporting should be forwarded by the investigational center  within 24 hours of when it becomes 
known to the same address as the initial report .  
For all countries, the sponsor’s Global Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Depart ment will 
distribute the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) form/XML file to the LSO/CRO for local submission to the regulatory authorities , IEC/IRBs , and 
investigators, according to regulations. T he investigator is responsible for ensuring that the 
IEC/ IRB is also informed of the event, in accordance with local regulations. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 74  The blinding will be maintained for the people who are involved directly in the study. Therefore, 
in case of a SUSAR, only the LSO /CRO  will receive from  PhV the unblinded report for 
regulatory submission; the others will receive a blinded report.  
Note: Although pregnancy is not a serious adverse event, the process for reporting a pregnancy is 
the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event , but using the pregnancy form  (see 
Section  7.2).  
If possible, a blood sample for measurement of serum reslizumab concentrations will be obtained from patients experiencing a serious adverse event, an adverse event lead ing to withdrawal, an 
observation of any severe hypersensitivity reaction (eg, anaphylaxis), or an exacerbation of 
asthma symptoms.  
7.1.5.3.2. Sponsor Responsibility  
If a serious unexpected adverse event is believed to be related to the study drug or study procedures , the sponsor will take appropriate steps to notify all investigators participating in 
sponsored clinical studies of reslizumab  and the appropriate regulatory authorities (and IEC/IRB, 
if appropriate).  
In addition to notifying the investigators and regula tory authorities  (and IEC/IRB, if appropriate) , 
other measures may be required, including the following:  
• altering existing research by modifying the protocol 
• discontinuing or suspending the study 
• altering the process of informed consent by modifying the existing consent form and 
informing current study participants of new findings 
• modifying listings of expected toxicities to include adverse events newly identified as 
related to reslizumab  
7.1.6. Protocol -Defined Adverse Events for Expedited Reporting  to Teva  
For the purposes of this protocol, the following are considered protocol- defined adverse events 
for expedited reporting to Teva: anaphylaxis, newly-diagnosed malignancy, opportunistic infection, and parasitic helminth infection. Protocol- defined adverse events  for expedited 
reporting can be either serious or nonserious according to the criteria outlined in Section  7.1.5.1. 
The process for reporting a protocol-defined adverse event for expedited reporting is the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event (see Section  7.1.5.3).  A list of potential opportunistic 
infections is found in Appendix I . 
7.1.7. Specific Adverse Event Case Repo rt Form  Capturing  
7.1.7.1. Anaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity Reactions Case Report Form  
Information about all suspected anaphylaxis events will be recorded on the Suspected Anaphylaxis/H ypersensitivity Reactions CRF, which is based on the 2006 Joint NIAID/FAAN 
Second Symposium on Anaphylaxis ( Sampson et al, 2006; Appendix H ). The 
Anaphylaxis /Hypersensitivity Reactions  CRF should be initiated in real time (along with vital 
sign assessment) for events oc curring after study drug administration in the clinic or as soon as 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 75  possible for suspect events outside the clinic. The process for reporting a protocol-defined 
adverse event  is the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event (see Section  7.1.5.3). 
These events can be either serious or nonserious, according to the criteria outlined in 
Section  7.1.5.1.  
7.1.7.2. Creat ine Phosphokinase /Muscular Adverse Events Case Report Form  
Potentially clinically significant creat ine phosphokinase (CPK) elevations (with or without 
associated symptoms) or myalgia/muscle symptoms will be recorded as an adverse event and 
documented using the potentially clinically significant CPK/myalgia case report form . A 
potentially clinically significant CPK is defined as ≥3.1×  upper limit of normal (ULN)  (Grade 3 
based on the Food and Drug Administration [ FDA ] “Guidance for Industry Toxicity Grading 
Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolle d in Preventative Vaccine Clinical 
Trials”).  
If a potentially clinically significant CPK level (≥3.1 ×  ULN)  occurs, the patient should attend an 
unscheduled visit for a physical exam ination  and additional testing if indicated per investigator 
judgement. CP K levels will be re -tested at a minimum of every 7 to 10 days until the elevation is 
resolved, or if agreed with the medical monitor that no further testing is indicated. For ≥10 ×  
ULN elevations in CPK, repeat CPK level, urinalysis (including microscopy), serum electrolytes, 
BUN, and creatinine will be performed as soon as possible after receipt of the CPK result. 
Further testing of CPK levels should be undertaken as frequently as needed to manage patient care per investigator judgment, but should be at a minimum of every 7 to 10 days as above. Need 
for repeat urinalysis, serum electrolytes, BUN , and creatinine testing should be determined by 
the investigator. In addition, need for treatment (eg, administration of iv fluids and  urine 
alkalinization) should be considered by the investigator.  
In cases deemed by the investigator to be treatment -related elevations in CPK ≥10 ×  ULN ( eg, 
potentially rhabdomyolysis), study drug discontinuation should occur at least until CPK 
normalization or longer based on invest igator clinical assessment.    
7.1.8. Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event  
Any patient who experiences an adverse event may be withdrawn from the study or from study treatment at any time at the discretion of the investigator. If a patient is withdrawn wholly or in part because of an adverse event, both the adverse events page and termination page of the CRF will be completed at that time.   
The patient will be monitored at the discretion of the investigator (eg, until the event has resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a health care professional, or 
until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug or study procedure is made). The 
investigator must inform the medical monitor  as soon as possible of all patients who are being 
considered for withdrawal due to adverse events. Additional reports must be provided when 
requested.  
If a patient is withdrawn from the study or study drug for multiple reasons that include adverse events, the termination page of the CRF should indicate that the withdrawal was related to an 
adverse event. An exception to this requirement will be the occurrence of an adverse event which 
in the opinion of the investigator is not severe enough to warrant discontinuation but which requires the use of a prohibited medication, thereby requiring discontinuation of the patient. In 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 76  such a case, the reason for discontinuation would be the need to take a prohibited medication, not 
the adverse event.  
A subject should only be designated as lost to follow- up if the site is unable to establish contact 
with the subject after 3 documented attempts via 2 different methods (phone, text, e- mail, 
certified letter, etc).  
7.1.9. Overdose of Study Drug  
Any dose of study drug (whether the investigational product, reference therapy, or a placebo), whether taken intentionally or unintentionally, in excess of that prescribed must be immediately 
reported to the sponsor. When the identification of the study drug must be known, the 
investigator must follow the procedures outlined in Section  3.10.  
Medication errors will be captured as protocol violations or deviations depending on the error. 
7.1.10. Protocol Deviations Because of an Adverse Event  
If a patient experiences an adverse event or medical emergency, departures from the protocol 
may be allowed on a case- by-case basis . After stabilization and/or treatmen t has been 
administered to ensure patient safety, the investigator or other physician in attendance must 
contact the medical monitor  as soon as possible to discuss the situation . The investigator, in 
consultation with the sponsor, will decide whether the patient should continue to participate in 
the study. 
7.2. Pregnancy  
All pregnancies that occur during the study, or within 5 months after last investigational pr oduct 
(IP) injectio n, are to be reported immediately to the medical monitor , and the investigator must 
provide the Teva Global Pharmacovigilance Department  with the pregnancy form. The process 
for reporting a pregnancy is the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event (see  
Section  7.1.5.3).  
Any patient becoming pregnant during the study will be withdrawn. All patients who become 
pregnant after first IP administration  and within 5 months after last IP injection  will be 
monitored to the completion or termination of the pregnancy. If the pregnancy continues to term, 
the outcome (health of the infant up to 8 weeks of age),  including spontaneous or voluntary 
termination, details of birth, and presence or absenc e of any birth defect, congenital 
abnormalities, or maternal and newborn complications, will be reported to the sponsor. Any complication of pregnancy will be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event, as appropriate. 
If the pregnancy does not continue to term, 1 of the following actions will be taken: 
• For a spontaneous abortion, report as a serious adverse event.  
• For an elective abortion due to developmental anomalies, report as a serious adverse 
event.  
• For an elective abortion not  due to developmental anomalies, report on the pregnancy 
form.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 77  The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary 
termination, details of birth, and presence or absence of any birth defect, congenital 
abnormalities or maternal and newborn complications. Pregnancy follow-up reports, like pregnancy reports, should be forwarded to Pharmacovigilance for data- entry to the global safety 
database and are also recorded on a specific CRF provided by Local Clinical Management.  
The pregna ncies reporting procedure should be the same as the serious adverse event  reporting 
procedure. 
7.3. Clinical Laboratory Tests  
A laboratory test result that has significantly worsened (according to investigator's medical judgment) from the baseline/DoR  result will be recorded on the source documentation and 
should be repeated. An adverse investigational event includes a laboratory or diagnostic test 
abnormality (once confirmed by repeat testing) that results in the withdrawal of the patient from 
the study, the te mporary or permanent cessation of treatment with study drug, or medical 
treatment or further diagnostic work-up. And adverse clinical laboratory should be monitored as 
described in Section  7.1.2. See Section  7.1.1 for a description of laboratory results that will be 
reported as adverse events.  
In addition, potentially clinically signif icant values will be predefined by the sponsor for selected 
laboratory parameters and w ill be detailed in the statistical analysis plan.  
Clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry , hematology , serology, and urinalysis ) will be 
performed before IP administration at  the time points  detailed in  Table 2. Clinical laboratory  
tests will be performed using the central laboratory . Specific laboratory tests to be performed are 
listed below .  
7.3.1. Serum Chemistry

 79  − bacteria  
− red blood cells 
− white blood cells 
− casts 
− crystals  
7.3.4. Other Clinical Laboratory Tests  
At screening, patients will be tested  for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, and 
HIV.  
7.3.4.1. Human Chorionic Gonadotropin Tests  
Human chorionic gonadotropin serum  tests will be performed for all females of childbearing 
potential at screening (visit  1). Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at baseline/DoR, before 
study drug injection at each administration visit and at week 52, or early withdrawal, an d at 
follow-up V18. A ny patient  who becomes pregnant during the study will be withdrawn. 
Procedures for reporting the pregnancy are provided in Section  7.2.  
7.4. Vital Signs 
Vital signs will be measured at time points specified in  Table 2, and before  other assessments 
(eg, blood draw and pulmonary function testing) and study drug administration. Vital signs 
include the following: 
• pulse 
• blood pressure 
• body temperature 
• respirator y rate  
Before pulse and blood pressure are measured, the patient must be in a supine or 
semi -erect/seated position and resting for at least 5 minutes. The same position and arm should 
be used each time vital signs are measured for a given patient. For any abnormal vital sign finding, the measurement should be repeated as soon as possible. Any vital sign value that is judged by the investigator as a clinically significant change (worsening) from a baseline value 
will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto 
the CRF, and monitored as described in Section  7.1.2. 
In addition, potentially clinically significant values will be predefined by the sponsor for selected vital p arameters and will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan.  
7.5. Electrocardiography  
A 12 -lead ECG will be conducted at screening (visit 1), week 24 (visit 10), week 36 (visit 13), 
and EOT or early withdrawal . ECG s should be obtained before other assessments (eg , blood 
draw and pulmonary function testing) and study drug admini stration.  Standard ECGs parameters 
will be recorded using a centralized process,  and the ECG will be interpreted locally by the 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 80  Principal Investigator (or qualified physician) as normal or abnormal. If the ECG is read as 
abnormal the P rincipal Investigator  will indicate whether or not the abnormality is clinically 
significant (yes or no) and write in the detailed interpretation/diagnosis. C linically significant 
abnormal ECG findings at  baseline/DoR and screening should be recorded as part of the medical 
history. Any ECG finding that is judged by the investigator as a clinically significant change 
compared with a baseline /DoR  value will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the source 
documentation and transcribed onto the CRF, and monitored as described in Section  7.1.2. 
In addition, potentially clinically significant values will be predefined by the sponsor for selected ECG parameters an d will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan.  
7.6. Physical Examinations  
Physical examinations, including height and weight, will be performed at specified time points as 
outlined in Table 2. The “full” physical examination should include the following organ systems: 
General appearance; Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose, and Throat (HEENT) ; Chest and Lung; Heart; 
Abdomen; Musculoskeletal; Skin; Lymph Nodes; and Neurological. The “brief” physical 
examination should include at minimum the following organ systems: General appearance; 
HEENT; Chest and Lung; Heart; and Skin. Any physical examination finding that is judged by the investigator as a clinically significant change (worsening) compared with a baseline/DoR 
value will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the CRF, and monitored as described in 
Section  7.1.2.  
7.7. Concomitant Therapy or Medication  
Concomitant therapy or medication usage will be monitored throughout the study. De tails of 
prohibited medications are found in Section  5.3.  
7.8. Methods and Timing of Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety 
Data 
All adverse events will be reviewed on a periodic basis by the clinical project physician/medical 
monitor according to the safety monitoring plan (eg, scheduled safety reviews for study drug) as 
interim/preliminary safety databases become available.  Safety data will additionally be evaluated 
periodically and ad hoc (if necessary) in the Product Safety Group. 
Methods and timing of assessing safety data are discussed in Section  3.16. Procedures for 
recording safety data are discussed in Section  13.1 and methods of analyses are discussed in 
Section  9.7.

 81  8. ASSESSMENT OF PHARMACOKINETICS, BIOMARKERS, AND 
IMMUNOGENICITY 
8.1. Pharmacokinetic Variables  
Serum reslizumab concentration will be measured at the time points indic ated in Table 2.  
8.1.1. Specimen Sampling and Handling  
Blood samples (3 mL) will be collected via venipuncture or indwelling catheter at the time points 
detailed in  Table 2 for ser um concentration measurements of reslizumab .  
Samples will be collected into labeled serum separator tubes and inverted slowly at least 5 times to thoroughly mix the blood with the clotting activation agent. Labels for samples should include 
study number, patient number, period, and nominal collection time. Blood samples will be left 
standing upright at room temperature (20°C to 25°C) to clot for approximately 30-60 minutes. Samples should then be centrifuged at a minimum of 1500 g for approximately 10 minu tes at 
4°C (if available, or ambient if 4°C centrifuge is not available) until clot and serum are well separated. Samples may be centrifuged at ambient temperature at 1500 g  for 10 minutes as long 
as measures  are be taken as appropriate to prevent samples from heating significantly during 
centrifugation. Separated serum will be transferred in approximately equal portions into 2 opaque, labeled, cryotubes (Aliquot A and B), immediately frozen in an upright position at a temperature within the range of –60ºC to –90ºC, and stored under these conditions until shipped 
to the bioanalytical facility. Storage at -15 to -25°C is acceptable for a period of up to 60 days if 
a ≤-65°C freezer is not available. The listed temperatures must be maintained. Labels for samples 
should include study number, patient number, period, nominal collection time, set (A  or B), and 
indication that they are PK  samples . 
The dates and exact times of study drug administration and of each PK  sample will be recorded 
on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF. 
8.1.2. Shipment and Analysis of Samples  
Serum samples for all  patients will be shipped from the investigation al center  to the central 
laboratory, where they will be stored until shipped to the sponsor or its designee  for analysis . The 
central laboratory will be notified before the shipment of the samples and will be sent the 
shipping information when the samples are shipped.  
Set A samples will be transported with a temperature data logger and frozen with sufficient dry 
ice, by next -day courier to the central laborato ry.  
Set B samples will either be sent to the same laboratory as that for set A on a later day by 
next-day courier, or be retained at the investigational center  until the study is completed (unless 
shipment to another facility is requested by the sponsor).  Samples from reslizumab -treated patient s will be analyzed using an appropriate validated 
method. Samples from placebo -treated patients will not be analyzed. Timing of the initiation of 
sample analysis will be determined by the Teva Global Bioassays and Technology representative 
responsible for the bioanalysis. The bioanalytical team will not be blind ed for this analysis.

 82  8.2. Biomarker  Variables  
8.2.1. Blood Eosinophil Counts 
Biomarker measures will include blood eosinophils and  
measured at the time points indicated in Table 2. Details of blood sampling and 
preparation are described in the Laboratory Manual provided in the study file documents. 
8.2.2.  
 
 
8.3. Immunogenicity  
Blood samples (5 mL) for assessment of ADA response will be taken before dosing at the time 
points indicated in Table 2. Unscheduled blood samples for anti- reslizumab antibody assessment 
will also be obtained from all patients (inside and outside of the Unite d States) experiencing a 
serious adverse event, an adverse event leading to withdrawal, an observation of any severe 
hypersensitivity reaction (eg, anaphylaxis), or an exacerbation of asthma symptoms.  
Samples will be collected into labeled serum separator  tubes and inverted slowly at least 5 times 
to thoroughly mix the blood with the clotting activation agent. Labels for samples should include 
study number, patient number, period, and nominal collection time. Blood samples will be left 
standing upright at room temperature (20°C to 25°C) to clot for approximately 30-60 minutes. 
Samples should then be centrifuged at a minimum of 1500 g for approximately 10 minutes at 4°C until clot and serum are well separated. Samples may be centrifuged at ambient temperature 
at 1500 g for 10 minutes as long as measures are taken as appropriate to prevent samples from 
heating significantly during centrifugation.  
Separated serum will be transferred, in approximately equal portions, into two labeled cryovial 
tubes (primary aliquot A and back- up aliquot B) and stored in an ultralow freezer at ≤ -65°C until 
shipped to a central or bioanalytical laboratory with temperature monitoring. Sample labels 
should include patient number, study number, collection date, and indication that it is an ADA 
sample aliquot (A or B). Storage at -15 to -20°C is acceptable for a period of up to 1 month if a 
≤-65°C freezer is not available. The listed temperatures must be maintained. The actual times 
and dates of sampling will be recorded on the CRF. 
8.3.1. Shipment and Analysis of Samples  
Serum samples for immunogenicity assessment for all patients will be shipped from the 
investigational center to the  central laboratory, where they will be stored until shipped to the 
sponsor or its designee for analysis. Samp les will be stored in an upright position at ≤ –65ºC until 
assayed. The central laboratory will be notified before the shipment of the samples and will be sent the shipping information when the samples are shipped. Set A samples will be transported with a temperature data logger and frozen with suffic ient dry ice by next -day courier to the 
central laboratory.  

 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 83  Set B samples will either be sent to the same laboratory as that for set A on a later day by 
next-day courier, or be retained at the investigational center until the study is completed (unless 
shipment to another facility is requested by the sponsor).  
Samples from reslizumab -treated patients will be analyzed using appropriate validated methods. 
Timing of the initiation of sample analysis will be determined by the Teva Pharmaceuticals 
bioanalytica l department representative responsible for the bioanalysis. The bioanalytical team 
will not be blinded for this analysis. 
Additional details regarding the collection, handling, and shipment of samples for measurement 
of anti-drug antibodies are provided in the investigator laboratory manual and its associated specimen collection summary.

 84  9. STATISTICS  
This section describes the statistical analysis as foreseen at the time of planning the study. 
Changes, additions, and further details about the analyses will be described in the statistical 
analysis plan. After finalization of the statistical analysis plan, any additional analyses or changes to analyses that may be required will be fully disclosed in the clinical study report.  
9.1. Sample Size and Power Consideration s 
The primary efficacy variable for  this study is the frequency  of CAEs per patient during the 
52-week treatment period . The study will be considered positive if the primary efficacy measure 
indicates a statistically significant treatment effect of reslizu mab versus placebo at the respective 
predefined significance level.  
Power calculations were based on the below assumptions: 
• Negative binomial (NB) distribution for the number of exacerbations with a mean of 
2.9 exacerbations per patient per year for the pl acebo group  
• Dispersion parameter of 1.2  
• Treatment effect of 45% between the reslizumab group and the placebo group  
• Alpha level of 0.05 
Based on the assumptions above, 225 patients per arm (45 0 total) will provide >90 % power to 
detect significant treatme nt effect of reslizumab over placebo in the reduction of exacerbation 
rate. The sample size was increased beyond the sample size required to provide 90% power in 
order to  allow sufficient number of patients to assess safety and immunogenicity and to ensure 
adequate enrollment in the adolescent subset. The current sample size also provides higher power for other efficacy endpoints. 
Patients  with blood eosinophil levels of 300/μL to <400/ µL will be limited to no more than 30% 
of patients (60  patients per treatment group). 
9.2. Analysis Sets 
9.2.1. Intent -to-Treat Analysis Set 
The intent- to-treat (ITT) analysis set will include all randomized patients  and will be used as the 
default p opulation for primary efficacy analysis. In this population, treatment will be assigned 
based on the treatment to which patients were randomized, regardless of which treatment they 
actually received.  
9.2.2. Safety Analysis Set 
The safety analysis set will include all patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug. In this population, treatment will be assigned based upon the treatment patients actually receive, regardless of the treatment to which they were randomized.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 85  9.2.3. Additional Analysis Sets  
9.2.3.1. Per-Protocol Analysis Set 
The Per -Protocol (PP) Analysis Set is a subset of the ITT Analysis Set including only Patients 
without major protocol violations.  
Additional analysis sets may be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan.   
9.3. Data Handling Conventions  
The primary analysis will include multiple imputations  for miss ing data as detailed in 
Section  9.5.6.1.  
The methodology and algorithm to be used for imputations will be detailed in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan.  For all oth er variables, only the observed data from the patients will be used in the 
statistical analyses, ie, there is no plan to estimate missing data.   
9.4. Study Population  
The ITT analysis set (see Section  9.2.1) will be u sed for all study population summaries unless 
otherwise noted. Summaries will be presented by treatment gr oup and for all patients. 
9.4.1. Patient Disposition  
Data from patients screened, patients screened but not randomized, patients randomized to 
treatment in the study, patients randomized but not treated, patients in the safety analysis set, 
patients in the per-protocol analysis set, patients who completed treatment period (week 52), and patients who complete the study ( see Section  3.16.4 for definition of study completion), patients 
that did not complete treatment but were followed up until end of study will be summarized. Data from patients who withdraw from the study will also be summarized by reason for withdrawal using descriptive statistics , and the number of patients who discontinue treatment but 
continue to attend study visits will be tabulated . 
9.4.2. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Patient demographic and baseline characteristics, including medical history,  prior medications, 
and ECG findings, will be examined to assess the comparability of the treatment groups and will 
be summarized using descriptive statistics. For continuous variables, descriptive statistics 
(number [n], mean, standard deviation (SD), standard error, median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided. For categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will be provided. Categories for missing data will be presented if necessary.  
9.5. Efficacy Analysis  
9.5.1. Primary Endpoint  
The primary efficacy v ariable for this study is the frequency of CAE s per patient during the 
52-week treatment period . 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 86  9.5.2. Secondary Endpoint s 
Secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows:  
• change in p re-bronchodilator FEV 1 from baseline/DoR at  week 52  
• change in AQLQ +12 score from baseline/DoR at  week 52  
• change in ACQ-6 score from baseline/DoR at  week 52 
• change in total asthma symptom scores (day and night) from baseline  at week  52 
• percentage of asthma control days from baseline/DoR to week 52 
• change in SGRQ score from baseline/DoR at week 32 
• time to first CAE  during the 52- week treatment period  
• frequency of exacerbations requiring hospitalization or emergency department visits 
per patient during the 52- week treatment period  
• frequency of moderate exacerbations defined as exacerbations  requiring additional 
asthma controller medication that was not a systemic corticosteroid and did not result 
in an asthma-specific hospitalization or emergency department visit during the 
52-week treatment period  
The order of the secondary endpoints above is the order of hierarchy to be used for controlling type I error as described in Section  9.6. 

 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 87  9.5.5. T
arget Biomarker Endpoints  
The target biomarker endpoints are the blood eosinophil counts at  baseline/DoR; weeks 2, 4, 8, 
12, 16, 32, 52 or early withdrawal; and the follow-up visit (approximately week 64 ). 
9.5.6. Planned Method of Analysis 
The ITT analysis set (see Section  9.2.1) will be used for all efficacy analyses. Summari es will be 
presented by treatment group . The per -protocol analysis set will be used as sensitivity analysis 
for the primary analysis.  
The baseline for diary variables will be the average of the run -in values over the 7 days 
preceding baseline/DoR. The bas eline for clinic visit variables will be the last observed value 
before  the first dose of study drug. The baseline for eosinophils levels analysis will be screening 
value.  
9.5.6.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary analysis of frequency of CAEs will use the NB regression model. The primary NB 
model will include the treatment group, randomization stratification factors, and number of 
exacerbations in the previous year as model factors and an offset variable. The offset variable 
will be calculated as the logarithm of follow-up duration minus the summed duration of exacerbations. The ratio of CAE rate between the treatment groups and its 95% confidence interval (CI) will be estimated from the NB model.  
CAE s that occur between the completion of the 1st dose of study drug and 2 weeks after the end 
of treatment/early withdrawal visit will be counted towards the CAEs for analysis.  
The primary analysis will incorporate data from all randomized patients. The analysis will include the frequency of all exacerbations observed  in 52 weeks, for patients completed the 
52 weeks treatment period and for patients withdrew from treatment earlier than 52 weeks. For 
early withdr awal patients that the sponsor will fail to retrieve data after  withdrawal despite all 

 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 88  attempts to contact th e patient, a multiple imputation will be performed for the frequency of 
exacerbation after  withdrawal. The multiple imputations will utilize the post- withdrawal data 
observed for patients who withdrew early and for which the sponsor succeeded to retrieve t he 
data. The methodology and algorithm to be used for imputations will be detailed in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan.  
Sensitivity analyses  will include: 
• Analysis including the frequency of all exacerbations observed  until treatment 
completion or until withd rawal from treatment, excluding exacerbations observed 
after withdrawing from treatment.  
• Repeating the primary analysis using an offset variable in t he NB model calculated as 
the logarithm of total follow -up duration (not excluding the summed duration of 
exacerbations).  
• Repeating the primary analysis on the Per -protocol analysis set.  
• “Tipping point” multiple imputation analysis to assess deviations from missing at 
random (MAR). The details regarding this analysis will be provided in the SAP. 
Additional sens itivity analyses will be detailed in statistical analysis plan.  
In addition, to the analysis described above, subgroup analyses will be performed for: 
1. Age categories . Patients at ages 12 to  <18 and patients ≥ 18 will be analyzed separately.  
2.  
 
3. Eosinophil levels at baseline categories. Patients with blood eosinophil levels at baseline of 300/μL  to <400/μL  and ≥400/μL  will be analyzed separately . 
Additional subgroup analyses may be performed. These will be described and detailed in the statistical analysis plan.  
9.5.6.2. Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
All efficacy variables will be summarized by treatment group. For continuous vari ables, the 
summary statistics will include n, mean, SD,  standard error ( SE), median, minimum, and 
maximum.   
Analysis of pulmonary function tests, AQLQ +12, ACQ-6, total asthma symptom scores , and 
SGRQ use will use the mixed model repeated measures  model with treatment group, visit, 
treatment and visit interaction, baseline value, and stratification factors as fixed effects and patient as a random effect.  
Analysis of percentage of asthma control days will use an analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) model 
with treat ment group and stratification factors.  
The Kaplan -Meier (KM) method will be used to estimate and compare the distributions of time 
to first CAE  between treatment groups. Differences will be compared using a log rank test 
adjusting for the stratification fa ctors.  

 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 89  The frequency of exacerbations requiring hospitalization or emergency department visits and the 
frequency of moderate exacerbations will be examined separately. The analysis will use similar 
methodology to that described for the primary analysis.  
Additional covariates or factors may be added to the statistical models. These will be detailed in 
the statistical a nalysis plan. 
9.6. Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity  
A fixed sequence multiple testing procedure will be implemented to test the primary and 
secondary variables while controlling the overall Type I error rate at 0.05. If the resulting 
two-sided p- value from the primary comparison is ≤0.05, then the next comparison of interest 
(first secondary variable) will be interpreted inferentially at 0.05. This process continues through 
the secondary variables until either all comparisons  of interest are interpreted inferentially, or 
until the point at which the resulting two -sided p-value for a comparison of interest is >0.05. At 
the point where p>0.05, no further comparisons will be interpreted inferentially. The hierarchy of 
endpoints i s as defined in Section  9.5.2. 
No multiplicity adjustments will be made for other efficacy and exploratory efficacy analyses.  
9.7. Safety Endpoints and Analysis  
Safety analyses will be performed on the safety analysis  set. 
9.7.1. Safety Endpoints  
Safety measures and time points are provided in Section  3.4. The overall safety of reslizumab 
treatment will be assessed throughout the study by evaluating adverse events and the following additional safety variables:  
• adverse events throughout the study 
• vital signs (pulse, respiratory rate, and blood pressure) throughout the study 
• concomitant medica tion usage throughout the study 
• physical examinatio n findings throughout the study 
• clinical la boratory evaluations at screening, baseline/DoR , and pe riodically 
throughout the study 
• ECG at screening and week 24, 36, and 52 or early withdrawal 

 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 90  9.7.2. Safety Analysis 
All adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). Each patient will be counted only once in each preferred term or system organ class 
category for the analyses of safety. Summaries will be presented for all adverse events that started after first study dosing (overall and by severity), adverse event s determined by the 
investigator to be related to study treatment (ie, reasonable possibility; see Section  7.1.4) 
(defined as related or with missing relationship) (overall and by severity), serious adverse events, adverse events causing discontinuation from study treatment, adverse events with onset during 
the follow-up period (ie, after the cessation of study treatment), and adverse events that begin 
within 24 hours after injection. Summaries will be presented by treatment group and for all patients. In addition, summaries of adverse events will be presented separately for patients with 
ADA positive status and patients with ADA negative status. Patient listings of adverse events, 
serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to discontinuation will be presented. 
Changes in laboratory, ECG, and vital signs measurement data will be summarized descriptively . 
All values will be compared with prespecified boundaries to identify incidence of abnormalities 
and potentially clinically signif icant  changes or values  as well as shift analysis , and such values 
will be listed  and summarized . 
The use of concomitant medications coded with WHO D rug will be summarized by therapeutic 
class using descriptive statistics . Concomita nt medications will include all medications taken 
while the patient is treated with study drug.  
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD , median, minimum, and maximum) 
will be provided for actual values and changes from baseline/DoR  to each time point . For 
categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will be provided.  
If any patient dies during the study, a listing of deaths will be provided and all relevant 
information will be discussed in the patient narrative included in the clinical study report.   
9.7.3. Immunogenicity Endpoints  
Samples for immunogenicity assessment for development of anti-drug antibodies will be 
obtained before the administration of study drug at DoR; prior to study drug administration at 
weeks  4, 16, 32, 52 or e arly withdrawal; and the follow -up visit (approximately week 64 ). 
Additional samples will be collected at the late  follow -up visit (approximately week 76). These 
data may be presented in a clinical study report addendum . 
9.8. Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Reslizumab  concentration data will be summarized by treatment group and time point. An 
attempt will be made to correlate serum concentrations of reslizumab with measures of safety 
and/or efficacy. The data will be pooled with data from other studies and analyzed usi ng 
population PK and PK/PD analysis and reported in a separate report. An additional, a PK sample 
will be collected 28 weeks (±2  weeks) after the last dose of study drug (~week  76) for validation 
of the ADA assessment.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 91  9.9. Biomarker Analysis  
Biomarker results  will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Analyses correlating efficacy 
variables and biomarkers will be explored as appropriate  
9.10. Immunogenicity Analysis  
Anti-reslizumab antibody information will be described for subjects who test positive. Samples  
from placebo -treated patients will not be analyzed unless the patient elects  to enroll into an 
available open -label safety  study where the patient will receive reslizumab treatment. In this case 
the pre-dose (baseline) sample from the rolled-over placebo patient will be analyzed and reported 
along with post- treatment samples collected in the open- label safety study.  Summaries will be 
provided if appropriate.  
9.11. Planned Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis is planned for this study. 
9.12. Reporting Deviations from the Statistical Plan  
Deviations from the statistical plan, along with the reasons for the deviations, will be described 
in protocol amendments, the statistical analysis plan, the clinical study report, or any combination of these, as appropriate, and in ac cordance with applicable local and regional 
requirements and regulations. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 92  10. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENT S 
The medical experts, study monitors, auditors, IEC/IRB, and health authority inspectors (or their 
agents) will be given direct access to source data and documentation (eg, medical charts/records, 
laboratory test results, printouts, videotapes) for source data verification, provided that patient confidentiality is maintained in accordance with local requirements.  
The investigator must maintain the  original records (ie, source documents) of each patient’s data 
at all times . Examples of source documents are hospital records, office visit records, examining 
physician’s finding or notes, consultant’s written opinion or notes, laboratory reports, drug 
inventory, study drug label records, diary data, protocol-required worksheets, and CRFs that are 
used as the source (see Section  3.15).  
The investigator will maintain a confidential patient identification list tha t allows the 
unambiguous identification of each patient. All study -related documents must be kept until 
notification by the sponsor. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 93  11. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
11.1. Protocol Amendments and Protocol Deviations and Violations  
11.1.1. Protocol Amendments  
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written 
approval or favorable opinion of a written amendment by the IEC/IRB and local competent 
authorities as applicable , except when necessary to address immediate safety concerns to the 
patients or when the change involves only nonsubstantial logistics or administration. Each 
investigator and the sponsor will sign the protocol amendment.  
11.1.2. Protocol Violations 
A protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or procedures 
defined in the protocol. 
Important protocol deviations, referred to as protocol violations, are a subset of protocol 
deviations that may significantly impact the completeness, accuracy, and/or reliability of the 
study data o r that may significantly affect a patient's rights, safety, or well -being. Protocol 
violations include enrolling patients in violation of key eligibility criteria designed to ensure a 
specific patient  population; failing to collect data necessary to interpret primary endpoints; 
noncompliance to study drug administration; use of prohibited medications; or any other 
deviations that may have an impact on the processes put in place for the care and safety of the patients or compromise the scientific value of th e trial.  
Protocol violations will be identified and recorded by investigational center personnel on the CRF . All protocol violations will be reported to the responsible IEC/IRB, as required. 
When a protocol violation is reported, the sponsor will determine whether to discontinue the patient from the study or permit the patient to continue in the study, with a documented decision 
from the Sponsor’s medical representative. The decision will be based on ensuring the safety of the patient and preserving the integrity of the study .  
Deviations from the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the protocol are not  prospectively granted by 
the sponsor. If investigational center  personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol 
eligibility criteria was entered into a study, they must immediately inform the sponsor. If such patient has already completed the study or has withdrawn early, no action will be taken, but the incident will be recorded.  If such patient is still participating in the study, a determination will b e 
made by the sponsor and the investigator as to whether it is in the best interest of the patient to continue in the study. 
11.2. Information to Study Personnel  
The investigator is responsible for giving information about the study to all staff members 
involved in the study or in any element of patient management, both before starting the study and 
during the course of the study (eg, when new staff become involved). The investigator must assure that all study staff members are qualified by education, experience,  and training to 
perform their specific responsibilities. These study staff members must be listed on the 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 94  investigational center authorization form, which includes a clear description of each staff 
member’s responsibilities. This list must be updated throu ghout the study, as necessary. 
The study monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to all study staff, including the investigator , and for ensuring they comply with the protocol. Additional information will be 
made available during the study when new staff become involved in the study and as otherwise agreed upon with either the investigator or the study monitor. 
11.3. Study Monitoring  
To ensure compliance with GCP guidelines, the study monitor or representative is responsible 
for ensuring that patients have signed the informed consent form and the study is conducted 
according to applicable SOPs, the protocol, and other written instructions and regulatory guidelines. 
The study monitor is the primary association between the sponsor and the investigator . The main 
responsibilities of the study monitor (s) are to visit the investigator  before, during, and after the 
study to ensure adherence to the protocol, that all data are correctly and completely recorded and 
reported, and that informed consent is obtained and recorded for all patients before they 
participate in the study and when changes to the consent form are warranted, in accordance with IEC/IRB  approvals. 
The study monitor (s) will contact the investigator and visit the investigational center  at regular 
intervals throughout the study. The study monitor will be permitted to check and verify the various records (CRFs and other pertinent source data records, including specific electronic 
source documentation [see Section  3.15]) relating to the study to verify adherence to the protocol 
and to ensure the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data being recorded . If 
electronic CRFs are used for the study, the study monitor will indicate verification by electron ically applyin g source document verification flags to the CRF and will ensure that all 
required electronic signatures are being implemented accordingly.  
As part of the supervision of study progress, other sponsor personnel may, on request, accompany the st udy monitor on visits to the investigational center . The investigator  and 
assisting staff must agree to cooperate with the study monitor to resolve any problems, errors, or 
possible misunderstandings concerning the findings detected in the course of these monitoring visits and/or provided in follow-up written communication. 
11.4. Clinical Product Complaints  
A clinical product complaint is defined as a problem or potential problem with the physical quality or characteristics of clinical drug supplies and/or clinic al device supplies used in a 
clinical research study sponsored by Teva.  Examples of a product complaint include but are not 
limited to the following:  
• suspected contamination 
• questionable stability (eg, color change, flaking, crumbling, etc.) 
• defective com ponents 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 95  • missing or extra units (eg, primary container is received at the site with more or less 
than the designated number of units inside) 
• incorrect packaging or incorrect or missing labeling/labels  
• unexpected or unanticipated taste or odor or both 
• device not working correctly or appears defective in some manner 
Each investigational center will be responsible for reporting a possible clinical product complaint 
by completing the Product Complaint Form provided by Teva and emailing it to 
 within 48 hours of becoming aware of the issue. 
For complaints involving a device or other retrievable item, it is required that the device (or item) be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. For complaints 
involving a drug product, all relevant  sample s (eg, the remainder of the patient’s drug supply) 
should be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible.  
11.4.1. Product Complaint Information Needed from the Investigational Center  
In the event that the Product Complaint Form cannot be completed, the investigator will obtain 
the following information, as available: 
• investigational center  number and principal investigator name 
• name, phone number, and address of the source of the complaint  
• clinical protocol number 
• patient identifier (patient study number) and corresponding visit numbers, if 
applicable  
• product name and strength for open- label studies  
• patient number, bottle, and kit numbers (if applicable) for double-blind or open- label 
studies 
• product available for return Y es/No 
• product was taken or used according to protocol Y es/No 
• description or nature of complaint 
• associated serious adverse event  Yes/No 
• clinical supplies unblinded (for blinded studies) Y es/No 
• date and name of person receivin g the complaint  
Note: Reporting a complaint must not be delayed because not all the required information can be immediately obtained. Known information must be immediately reported. The sponsor will collaborate with the investigator to obtain any outstanding information. 
11.4.2. Handling the Study Drug at the Investigational Center  
The investigator is responsible for retaining the product in question in a location separate from 
the investigator’s clinical study supplies.  The sponsor may request that the investigator return the 

 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 96  product for further evaluation and/or analysis. If this is necessary, the clinical study monitor or 
designee will provide the information needed for returning the study drug. 
If it is determined that the investigational center must return all of the study drug, the sponsor 
will provide the information needed to handle the return. 
The integrity of the randomization code and corresponding blinded clinical supplies will be 
maintained whenever possible. A serious adverse event or the potential for a product quality problem existing beyond the scope of the complaint may be a reason to unblind the clinical supplies for an affected patient. 
11.4.3. Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Associated with a Product Complaint  
If there is an adverse event or ser ious adverse event, the protocol should be followed. 
11.4.4. Documenting a Product Complaint  
The investigator will record a description of the product complaint in the source documentation 
as well as any actions taken to resolve the complaint and to preserve the safety of the patient . 
Once the complaint has been investigated by the sponsor and the investigator, if necessary, an 
event  closure letter may be sent to the investigational center where the complaint originated or to 
all investigational centers using the p roduct. 
11.5. Audit and Inspection 
The sponsor may audit the investigational center to evaluate study conduct and compliance with protocols, SOPs , GCPs, and applicable regulatory requirements. The sponsor’s Global Clinical 
Quality Assurance department, independe nt of the Global Clinical Development department, is 
responsible for determining the need for (and timing of) an investigational center audit. 
The investigator must accept that regulatory authorities and sponsor representatives may conduct 
inspections to verify compliance with GCP guidelines.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 97  12. ETHICS 
Details of compliance with regulatory guidances and applicable laws are provided in Section  1.6. 
12.1. Informed Consent /Assent  
For patients 18 years of age or older, the investigator, or a qualified person designated by the 
investigator, should fully inform the patient of all pertinent aspects of the study, including the 
written information approved by the IEC/IRB . All written and/or oral information about the 
study will be p rovided in a language as nontechnical as practical and understood by the patient. 
The patient should be given ample time and opportunity to inquire about details of the study and to decide whether or not to participate in the study. The above should be det ailed in the source 
documentation. 
Written informed consent will be obtained from each patient before any study- specific 
procedures or assessments are done and after the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and 
potential hazards are explained, according to  the IEC/IRB requirements. The patient’s 
willingness to participate in the study will be documented in a consent form, which will be signed and personally dated by the patient  and by the person who conducted the informed 
consent discussion. The investigato r will keep the original consent forms, and copies will be 
given to the patients . It will also be explained to the patients that the  patient  is free to refuse entry 
into the study and free to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to future treatment.  
For patients 12 through <18 years of age, t he investigator, or a qualified person designated by the 
investigator, should fully inform the patient and parent or other legally acceptable representative of all pertinent aspects of the study, including the written information approved by the IEC/IRB. 
All written and/or oral information about the study will be provided in a language as 
nontechnical as practical and understood by the parent or legally acceptable representative, and the patient as far as is practical.  The patient and parent/legal representative should be given 
ample time and opportunity to inquire about details of the study and to decide whether or not to participate in the study. The above should be detailed in the source documentation. 
A personally signed and dated informed consent form will be obtained from each parent/legal 
representative and a signed and dated assent form will be obtained from each patient (if the 
patient is able) before any study -specific procedures or assessments are done and after the aims, 
methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards are explained; according to local IEC/IRB 
requirements.  The forms will also be signed and dated by the person who conducted the 
informed consent discussion. The investigator will keep the original consent and assent  forms, 
and copies will be given to the patients. It will also be explained to the patients  (and parent/legal 
representative)  that they are free to refuse entry into the study and free to withdraw from the 
study at any time without prejudice to future treatment.  
12.2. Health Authorities and Independent Ethics Committees/Institutional 
Review Boards  
Before this study starts, the protocol will be submitted to the national/local health authorities and 
to each IEC/IRB for review . As required, the study will not start at a given investigational center 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 98  before the IEC/IRB and health au thority (where applicable) for the center give written approval 
or a favorable opinion. 
12.3. Confidentiality Regarding Study Patients  
The investigator must ensure that the privacy of the patients, including their identity and all 
personal medical information, will be maintained at all times. In CRFs and other documents or 
image material submitted to the sponsor, patients will be identified not by their names , but by an 
identification code ( ie, identification number).  
Personal medical information may be reviewed for the purpose of patient safety and/or verifying data in the source and transcribed onto the CRF. This review may be conducted by the study 
monitor, properly authorized persons on behalf of the sponsor, the quality assurance unit, and/or regulatory authorities . Personal medical information will always be treated as confidential.  
12.4. Declaration of the End of the Clinical Study  
Last Subject Last Visit (LSL V) treatment period is defined as end of treatment (week 52 ). LSLV 
late follow up for immunogenicity testing only, will be performed 28 weeks (±2 weeks) after the last dose of study drug (approximately week 76). This will be considered the end of the trial for the purposes of end of trial notification. 
For clinical investigational centers located in the EU, a declaration of the end of the clinical 
study will be made according to the procedures outlined in Directive 2001/20/ED, Article 10(c); for other count ries, local regulations will be followed.  
12.5. Registration of the Clinical Study  
In compliance with local regulations and in accordance with Teva standard procedures, this 
clinical study may be registered on clinical trials registry websites.

 99  13. DATA HANDLING, DA TA QUALITY CONTROL, AND RECORD 
KEEPING 
13.1. Data Collection  
Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically designed for this study. The data collected 
on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management system (CDMS) that meets the 
technical req uirements described in 21CFR Part 11. The CDMS will be fully validated to ensure 
that it meets the scientific, regulatory, and logistical requirements of the study before it is used to 
capture data from this study. Before using the CDMS, all users will rec eive training on the 
system and study-specific training. After they are trained, users will be provided with individual system access rights.  
Data will be collected at the investigational center  by appropriately designated and trained 
personnel, and CRFs must be completed for each patient who provided informed consent. Patient identity should not be discernible from the data provided on the CRF. Data will be verified using the data source by the study monitor, and reviewed for consistency by Data Management using 
both automated logical checks and manual review. All data collected will be approved by the 
investigator at the investigational center . This approval acknowledges the investigator’s review 
and acceptance of the data as being complete and accurate.  
If data are processed from other sources (eg, central laboratory, bioanalytical laboratory, central 
image center, eD iary data , ePRO Tablet ), the results will be sent to the investigational center , 
where they will be retained but not entered into the CRF, unless otherwise specified in the 
protocol. These data may also be sent electronically to the sponsor (or organization performing 
data management) for direct entry into the clinical database. Laboratory test results will not be 
entered into the CRF unless otherwise noted in the protocol. All data from other sources will be available to the investigator s. 
For patients who enter a study but do not meet entry  criteria, at a minimum, data for screen 
failure reason, demography, and adverse events from the time of  informed consent will be 
entered into the CRF.  
13.2. Data Quality C ontrol  
Data Management is responsible for the accuracy, quality, completeness, and internal consistency of the data from this study. Data handling, including data quality control, will comply with international regulatory guidelines, including ICH GCP guidelines. Data 
management and control processes specific to this study, along with all steps and actions taken 
regarding data management and data quality contr ol, will be described in a data management 
plan. 
Case report forms received will be processed and reviewed for completeness, consistency, and 
the presence of mandatory values . Applicable terms will be coded according to the coding 
conventions for this study . Logical checks will be implemented to ensure data quality and 
accuracy . Any necessary changes will be made in the clinical database, and data review and 
validation procedures will be repeated as needed . Data from external sources will be compared 
with the information available in the CDM S. Discrepancies found will be queried. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 100  Data corrections in the CDMS will be made using the CDMS update function. The system 
requires a reason for each change and keeps a complete audit trail of the data values, dates and 
times of modifications, and author ized electronic approvals of the changes.  
At the conclusion of the study, the CDMS and all other study data will be locked to further 
additions or corrections. Locking the study data represents the acknowledgement that all data 
have been captured and confi rmed as accurate.  
13.3. Archiving of Case Report Forms and Source Documents  
13.3.1. Sponsor Responsibilities  
The sponsor will have final responsibility for the processing and quality control of the data. Data management oversight will be carried out as described in the sponsor’s SOPs for clinical studies. 
Day to day data management tasks for this study are delegated to a contract organization, and 
these functions may be carried out as described in the SOPs for clinical studies at that 
organization. These SOPs will be reviewed by the sponsor before the start of data management 
activities . The original CRFs will be archived by the sponsor. Center -specific CRFs will be 
provided to the respective investigational center s for archiving.  
13.3.2. Investigator Responsibilities  
The investigator must maintain all written and electronic records, accounts, notes, reports and data related to the study and any additional records required to be maintained under country, state/province, or other local laws, including, but not limited to, the following :  
• full case histories  
• signed informed consent forms 
• patient identification lists  
• case report forms for each patient on a per- visit basis  
• data results from other sources (eg, central laboratory, bioanalytical laboratory, 
central image center, eD iary data)  
• safety reports  
• financial disclosure reports/forms 
• reports of receipt, use, and disposition of the study drug 
• copies of all correspondence with sponsor, the IRB/IEC, and any regulatory authority 
The investigator will retain all records related to the  study until the CRO or sponsor sends 
written notification that records may be destroyed. If, after 10 years from study completion, or 
earlier in the case of the investigative center closing or going out of business, the investigator reasonably determines that study record retention has become unduly burdensome, and sponsor 
has not provided written notification of destruction, then the investigator may submit a written 
request to sponsor at least 60 days before any planned disposition of study records. Upon receipt 
of such request, the sponsor may make arrangements for appropriate archival or disposition, 
 Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study C38072- AS-30025 
 101  including requiring that the investigator deliver such records to the sponsor. The investigator 
shall notify the sponsor of any accidental loss or destruction of study records.

New Text  Infect ions 
The immune response to parasitic 
infections may involve eosinophils; 
therefore, the clinical course of existing or new parasitic infections could potentially be complicated by a mechanism of action that lowers blood and tissue eosinophils. The iv resl izumab clinical protocols 
contained an exclusion criterion for patients with active or suspected helminth infestation/infection. The asthma Phase 3 studies were conducted in geographic regions in which helminth infections are prevalent, including South and  Central 
America, Africa, and Asia. There were no helminth infections reported, and no difference was documented between the treatment groups in regards to adverse events that could be associated with gastrointestinal helminth infections.  
The overall rate of infection adverse events 
was lower for reslizumab versus placebo treated patients, with the types of infection events reported consistent with what would be expected in a primarily adult patient 
population with an underlying condition of 
asthma. No pot ential opportunistic 
infections were reported.  Additional safety consideration for 
infections added for 
clarity.

were 2427 treatment -emergent adverse 
events reported by 2124 patients related to  
malignancy for the entire clinical program. The malignancies,Malignancies  in the 
reslizumab -treated patients were of diverse 
tissue origin (1 tissues (  colon, 1 anal, 3 
melanoma,  2 prostate,  3 breast, 2 lung,  
1 plasmacytoma, 1 lymphoma,  1 lung 
metastasis of a previous resected colon cancer, and 5 ovarian adenocarcinoma, 
borderline ovarian tumor, 
and non-melanoma skin cancer cases  
reported as nonserious events). ).  
In the placebo -controlled asthma  studies  
utilizing the 3.0 -mg/kg dose , the incidence 
of the overall malignancies was 6 (0.58%) 
patients ( 0.58%; 1 patient had  both prostate 
cancer and skin squamous cell carcinoma) in the reslizumab 3.0 -mg/kg treatment group 
and 2  patients (0.27%) in the placebo group; 
all. All malignancies in the reslizumab -
treated patients were diagnosed within less 
than 6 months from first reslizumab dosing 
with the exception of , except for the skin 
squamous cell carcinoma.  
In the combined placebo -controlled studies 
and the long- term, open -label, safety

As of February 2015, there were 24 
treatment -emergent adverse events 
reported by 21 patients related to

incidence of over all malignancies was 
6 patients (0.58%; 1 patient had both 
prostate cancer and skin squamous cell 
carcinoma) in the reslizumab 
3.0-mg/kg treatment group and 
2 patients (0.27%) in the placebo

less than 6 months from first 
reslizumab dosing, except for the skin 
squamous cell carcinoma.  
In the combined placebo -controlled 
studies and long -term, open -label,

non-melanoma skin cancer. Most 
malignancies were diagnosed within 
less than 6 months after starting 
reslizumab treatment, and in 5 cases, 
there was a previous medical history of

Section 1.4.1: Risks of Reslizumab  
Most clinical safety data for reslizumab 
are based on the experience with iv 
administration of the drug.  As described in 
Section  1.3.2,  iv reslizumab iv has been 
generally well tolerated over the range of 
doses evaluated (ie, from 0.03 through 3 mg/kg). Systemic severe reacti ons 
(including  Aanaphylaxis ) and myalgia are 
considered as adverse drug reactions of iv reslizumab.  
There are limited safety data regarding sc 
administration of reslizumab.  Most clinical safety data for reslizumab are based on the experience with iv

(including anaphylaxis) and myalgia are considered as adverse drug reactions of iv resliz umab.  
There are limited safety data regarding 
sc administration of reslizumab.  This section was updated with information found in 
the current Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
Section 1.4.3.  Overall Risk and Benefit Assessment for This Study:  
The majority of adv erse events in 
reslizumab -treated patients was were mild to 
moderate in severity, and considered to be 
unrelated to study drug treatment, as determined by the investigator, and ( as 
expected ), associated with underlying asthma 
disease. There were no significant differences 
in the AEadverse event  profile between 
patients  treated with reslizumab and patients 
treated with placebo with the exception of 
the following ADRs: “systemic severe 
reactions (including anaphylaxis)” and 
“myalgia”. Three 3 anaphylaxis react ions 
related to reslizumab infusions  that were 
reported during the BREATH asthma program; Nnone of the patients were positive 
for ADA. All cases resolved with standard treatment , and treatment with reslizumab was 
permanently discontinued. This is an 
expect ed ADR and is listed in the IB . 
Myalgia (without evidence for muscle 
injury) was reported at a slightly higher 
rate in the reslizumab 3.0 -mg/kg group 
(1%) than in the placebo group (0.5%). 
The protocol includes measures to closely 
monitor and promptly addr ess these 
ADRs, to mitigate any potential harm to 
patients.  
Overall, the nature and occurrence of the 
reported study drug related adverse events 
did not raise any specific safety concerns. For 
the full ADR list, please refer to the IB.  The majority of adverse events in reslizumab -treated patients were mild 
to moderate in severity, were considered to be unrelated to study drug treatment, as determined by the investigator, and as expected, were associated with underlying asthma

ANAPHYLAXIS  
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled: 
a. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-
tongue- uvula) AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING  
− Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak expiratory flow ( PEF), hypoxemia) 
− Reduced blood pressure ( BP) or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction 
(eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
b. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours):  
− Involvement of the skin- mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula) 
− Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia) 
− Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
− Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)  
c. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): 
− Infants and children: low systolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% decrease 
in systolic BP  
− Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that person’s baseline

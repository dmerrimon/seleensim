RATIONALE  Observational cohorts have found that those who self -report frequent red and 
processed meat intake have higher risk of several diet -related chronic diseases 
such as cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes and cancer compared to those with low or no intake  of these foods. These findings are valuable, but self -
reported diet without biological markers does not advance science towards 
understanding biological mechanisms. Some cohort studies have reported links 
between red and processed meat consumption and health related biomarkers 
such as lipids or food preparation- generated biomarkers such as polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heterocyclic amines (HAs). However, many of 
these studies examined the associations of red and processed meat with blood or 
urine biomarkers in cross -sectional analyses, leaving the possibility for residual 
confounding and an inability to draw causal inference. Further, often only one pathway or one compound was measured in these studies, limiting insight into 
multiple pathways affected by red and processed meat consumption. And no 
studies have tested red and processed meat on systems -wide biomarkers using 
the metabolome and microbiome.  
STUDY DESIGN  This controlled feeding trial will enroll 20 heathy adult females and males. 
Participants will consume two diets, in random order: 1) Diet A is based on the 
Healthy Eating Index -2015 (HEI -2015) and includes no red or processed meat; 2) 
Diet B is based on the Healthy Eating Index -2015 and includes red and 
processed meat (HEI -2015- M) as some of the  protein sources. Both diet periods 
last 21 days and an approximately  21-day washout period occurs between diets.  
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  The study has the following primary specific aim : 
1. Identify the extent and nature of shifts in the metabolome when 
consuming a standard HEI -2015 diet compared to a HEI -2015- M diet.  
SECONDARY 
OBJECTIVES The study has the following secondary aim:  
1. Identify and characterize modulation of the gut microbial community when 
consuming a standard HEI -2015 diet c ompared to a HEI -2015- M diet.

 DURATION OF 
SUBJECT 
PARTICIPATION AND 
DURATION OF STUDY  Subjec ts will participate in the  study for 11 weeks . 
The total duration of the study is expected to be 1.5  years  
PRIMARY ENPOINT S 
 Primary Aim 1:  Compare intervention effect of each feeding period on shifts in 
the metabolome as detected in blood and urine samples relative to baseline for 
each participant.  
 
SECONDARY 
ENDPOINTS  Secondary Aim:   Compare intervention effect of each feeding period on shifts in 
the gut microbial community as detected by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and 
digital droplet PCR relative to baseline for each participant.  
STATISTICS  
Primary Analysis Plan  Statistical analysis for primary Aim 1  (metabolome) . Aim 1 identifies 
metabolomic markers that differ between HEI -2015 and HEI -2015- M. Metabolites 
from NMR and LC/MS -MS platforms will be combined to allow greater coverage 
of the metabolome.  Metabolite levels are normalized by dividing by the batch’s 
median value followed by removing metabolites with >25% CVs in the embedded 
blinded duplicates as well as those with >20% missing values (expected at 5- 10% 
of total). Next , we use unsupervised pr incipal components analysis (PCA) to 
visually examine the data patterns and variability. We then apply supervised orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS -DA) to identify 
candidate biomarkers that may differ by diet arm. VIP (variable i mportance in 
projection) scores >2 will be retained. For each identified metabolite, separate 
linear mixed models are fit to examine fold- changes in end of diet period 
metabolite levels by HEI -2015 and HEI -2015- M, adjusting for baseline. In the 
cross- over design each participant is their own control, minimizing noise in intra -
individual variation in endogenous metabolites. The cross -over design also 
minimizes confounding by age, BMI, and diet order, but models are run with and without these adjustments. The  Benjamini -Hochberg approach controls for false 
discovery rate (FDR) <0.10.  
Rationale for Number 
of Subjects  We have set a sample size of 20 and each participant will complete both arms   
for this pilot study , which  will provide preliminary data to support  an R01.  The 
sample size is based on the number of participants needed to observe an 
intervention effect while staying within the fixed budget of an R21.

 1. BACKGROUND  
Scientific premise and importance of the problem. The significance of this application is that mechanistic 
evidence by which red and processed meat affects overall systemic human metabolism is lacking. In 2019, a 
series of systematic reviews and meta analy ses published by an ad hoc  group21 concluded that, contrary to 
US2 and global10, 11 dietary guidance, red and processed meat could be consumed with no harm to human 
health.16-19, 21 In contrast, evidence from well -conducted observational cohorts finds that red and processed 
meat consumption is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes , certain cancers 
and total mortality.7, 26- 30 The authors of the 2019 reports based some of their conclusions on the fact that US 
dietary guidelines rely primarily on observational cohort data instead of randomized controlled trials, a study 
design they viewed as ‘weak’.21 Further, the authors cited a lack of robust data connecting red and processed 
meat consumption to biological mechanisms linked to health outcomes. The observational data juxtaposed 
with the ad hoc  group’s recommendations that red and processed meat may be consumed with no ill effects, 
indicate that knowledge and evidence gaps remain.31 These gaps need to be filled to inform diet -related health 
promotion and disease prevention recommendations. This application does not dim inish observational findings 
of red and processed meat and disease outcomes; rather the intent is to add to the body of evidence as the totality of evidence is needed to generate robust population dietary guidance.  
The problem of understanding the biologi cal mechanisms by which red and processed meat affect human 
health will be explored in this project in a randomized cross -over feeding trial testing a Healthy Eating Index -
2015 (HEI -2015) diet with no  red and processed meat compared to a HEI -2015 diet with  red and processed 
meat (HEI -2015- M). A controlled feeding trial is a study design optimally suited for investigating mechanisms 
linking food intake with metabolic response due to the ability to carefully control food intake.32, 33 Two types of 
mechanistic biomarkers are outcomes for this study, both reflecting systems -wide readouts: (1) metabolomics; 
and (2) gut microbiota. The 2020- 2030 NIH Strategic Plan for Nutrition Research34 calls for research into food 
effects o n both the metabolome and the microbiome, making this project a timely fit.34, 35  
Biological e ffects of red and processed meat intake. Red meat is mammalian, “red pigmented flesh or 
organ meats including beef, pork, venison and game meats”.36 Processed meats are “any meats that have 
undergone salting, curing, fermentation and other methods of preservation and may include red meat, poultry 
and fish”.36 Red and processed meat are often grouped together as a single exposure in many investigations29, 
37, 38 and thus will be examined together in this study. A key question is: do red and processed meat generate a 
different metabolic and gut microbial community response than fish, poultry or plant -based proteins (e.g., nuts, 
beans)? Red meat has important nutrients including essential amino acids, iron, zinc and vitamin B 12.39 Both 
red and processed meat are also high in nutrients that should be consumed in moderation such as saturated 
fat and sodium.1, 38 Other red and processed meat -derived non -nutrient compounds linked to health risks 
include advanced glycation- end products,40, 41 nitrosamines42-44 and potential endocrine disruptors derived from 
livestock feed or from that used in processed meat preservat ion and packaging.45, 46 Red meat cooking 
methods may also induce the formation of compounds linked to poor health including heterocyclic amines 
(HAs)47, 48 such as amino -1-methyl -6-phenylimidazo[4,5 -b]pyridine (PhiP) 24, 49 and polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs).3, 48 The evidence for HAs and PAHs supported the International Agency for Research 
on Cancer (IARC) declarations that red and processed meats are Group 2A and Group 1 carcinogens, 
respectively.15 The presence of these cooking -derived compounds are not observed with fresh poultry and fish, 
but are seen in all types of processed meat, including that derived from poultry and fish.15  
Prior interventions and controlled feeding studies testing red and processed meat . Recent interventions, 
including controlled feeding studies, demonstrated that red meat can be a component of a healthy diet with 
neutral effects or slight improvements in blood lipids, glucose tolerance and cardiometabolic risk factors.50-52 
These studies were rigorous and well -conducted, but were focused on spe cific health -related biomarkers, not 
whole -body mechanisms, leaving a gap in identifying systems -wide mechanisms. Other feeding studies 
identified blood and urine- based metabolomics and microbiome features that differed between lean seafood 
and non- seafood diets, but did not specifically test red and processed meat.53, 54 In still another, there was a 
rapid microbiome change in response to 5 -day controlled diets where both a plant -based diet and an animal 
foods -based diet were administered.55 The plant -based diet induced bacterial diversity for key genera overall56, 
57 as well as increases in bacterial genes involved in plant polysaccharide decomposition, such as butyrate 
kinase ( buk). In the animal foods -based diet bacteria involved in proteolysis and nitrogen metabolism 
increased, and overall bacterial diversity decreased.55 These results support the premise that diet change and 
specific food components induce rapid shifts in gut microbiota.55 However, still lacking are controlled trials 
explicitly testing red and processed meat while all other aspects of diet are held constant.  
 
EAT-WELL Study Protocol_V 3  6 
 Rationale for metabolome and microbiome as endpoints.  The 2020- 2030 NIH Strategic Plan for Nutrition 
Research34 calls for mechanistic studies on the relationship between foods and both the m icrobiome and the 
metabolome to allow a systems approach to nutrition research, a strategy recognized as valuable by the NIH 
and nutrition research community.32, 33 Both the metabolome and microbiome are sensitive to short -term 
changes in diet, as shown by us and others.53-55, 58- 62 Further, both outcomes are needed for a full complement 
of systems- wide nutritional effects. Evidence suggests that dietary patterns,63-68 individual f oods, nutrients or 
food groups62, 69 -76 may display a unique metabolome or microbiome signature, including for meat and fish 
consumption.75 However, many of these analyses were cross -sectional, associating baseline diet with baseline 
biospecimens, leaving the potential for confounding and the inability to draw causal inference. Further rationale 
for the microbiome endpoint is evidence that meat may expand certain bacterial groups in the colon and 
evidence that specific microbial metabolites are generated from the hydrolysis of meat -derived aromatic and 
sulfur containing amino acids.55, 77 Moreover, red meat derived heme induces genotoxic microbial  H2S and 
nitrite production using narG , the first step in genotoxic reactions leading to DNA adducts.77 Finally, poor diet 
quality (lower HEI scores) in an observational study was linked to enrichment of  two microbial species, 
Enterobacter  and Escherichia -Shigella , that reduce nitrate to nitrite using nitrate reductase ( narG ),78, 79 findings 
relevant for Aim 2 as we will do 16S rRNA sequencing and identify microbial functional genes, including narG . 
 This study has the following primary specific aim:  
1. Identify the extent and nature of shifts in the metabolome when consuming a standard HEI -2015 diet 
compared to a HEI -2015 -M diet.  
Hypothesis 1: Daily intake of red and processed meat will induce shifts in the metabolome detected 
in blood and urine samples using various metabolomics platforms.  
This study has the following secondary aim 
2. Identify and characterize modulation of the gut microbial community when consuming a standard HEI -2015 
diet compared to a HEI -2015- M diet.  
Hypothesis 2: Daily intake of red and processed meat will shift the gut microbiome such that the two diet arms wi ll show differences in the gut microbial community structure using16S rRNA gene 
sequencing and digital droplet PCR for assessing microbial functional genes.  
2. STUDY DESIGN  
Overview.  This is a randomized cross -over feeding trial to test whether  red and processed meat consumption , 
in the context of a controlled diet based on HEI -2015,  will cause shifts in the metabolome and the microbiome 
compared to a controlled HEI -2015 diet with no red or processed meat. Twenty healthy adults will  complete 
two feeding periods, in random order of 21 days each with an approximately  21-day washout between feeding 
periods ( Figure 1 ). Study meals are prepared at the Fred  
Figure 1. Study design  
 
Hutch Human Nutrition Laboratory (HNL). Participants attend seven  clinic visits at the Fred Hutch Prevention 
Center Clinic : an orientation visit at which consent and randomization will occur; three visits  to complete fasting 
blood draws and to deliver 24 -hour urine and stool specimens collected at home; one visit to initiate feeding 
period 2 and two mid- point visits to check for weight stability . The collected biospecimens are used for study 
outcomes.

report consumption. Participants will be asked to maintain their usual level of physical activity but not start new 
exercise routines while on study. Any over the counter medications used while on study wi ll be recorded.  
 
4. STUDY PROCEDURES  
4.1 Recruitment  
Study staff will recruit participants by traditional media (print,), social media, community organi zations and local 
colleges/universities. Additionally, the Fred Hutch Recruitment and Retention Core may assist with recruitment 
of minority participants. We aim to have minority enrollment that reflects the Seattle population (2019 Seattle 
census estimates are 35.5% minority). . Initial recruitment and eligibility activities take place via an online 
screening questionnaire in response to media and flyer postings. If an individual is determined to be eligible or 
possibly eligible via the online screener, s taff will confirm interest and eligibility by phone or email , schedule the  
orientation visit  and provide directions to the Fred Hutch Prevention Center Clinic . 
4.2 Orientation /Consent  Visit  
Study staff review the “study at a glance” document, the  study consent and provide individuals an opportunity 
ask questions.  Participants will be shown the study menus and asked whether they are  willing and able to 
consume the majority of study foods. If needed, some substitut ions may be possible (for example, substitute 
an orange for grapefruit); however, some substitutions may not be possible. Individuals who are unwilling or 
unable to eat the majority of study foods will be asked to not  enroll in the study. Individuals will be asked to 
provide written informed consent for study activities.  After participants sign the consent,  study staff  will 
measure height  and weight and participants  will complete the “L ifestyle Questionnaire”  on demographic 
characteristics, usual dietary supplement use, medical history and usual physical activity. Information provided 
in this questionnaire will be used to estimate  energy requirements for study diet planning. Participants will be 
given a four -day food record and instructions and asked to complete at home in preparation for  Clinic Visit 1. 
Participants will be  given a stool collection and  a 24-hour urine collection kit  as well as detailed instructions for 
collecting these specimens  at home in preparation for Clinic Visit 1 . Study staff  will schedule Clinic Visit 1 and 
review instruction s to prepare for Clinic Visit 1.  Participants will be randomized (using a computerized program ) 
to diet order (Diet A then  Diet B  or Diet B then Diet A ). 
 
EAT-WELL Study Protocol_V 3  8 
 4.3 Clinic Visit 1 (Feeding Period 1, Day 1)  
At clinic visit 1, s tudy staff will receive and process u rine and stool specimens  collected by participants  at 
home. Staff will also receive the completed food record. Clinic staff will next measure weight and waist  
circumference  and draw fasting blood . After the blood draw, participants will eat their first study meal of feeding 
period 1.  Study s taff will review instructions for the next three weeks ( Feeding Period 1) , meal pick-up/delivery, 
proper food storage and reheating, schedule Clinic Visits 2 -4 and the check -in visits , provide a study calendar 
and answer any  participant questions. Clinic visit 1 concludes with the participant being provided the first three 
days of study meals and daily meal check -off forms.  
4.4  Feeding Period 1 ( Feeding Period 1, Days 1 – 21)   
A 3- to 4-day supply of study meals will be pick ed by the participant on site at Fred Hutc h.. Participants will be 
asked to visit the clinic 2 times per week during each Feeding Period.  Each study  meal is accompanied by a 
check -off list for participants to indicate foods consumed and amount (if any) remaining.  Participants are asked 
to consume onl y study provided foods but may use and report their own coffee  and tea, (record type, 
amount ;sweetener  and cream/milk will be provided by the study ). Halfway through feeding period 1, 
participants will attend  the Check- in Visit  1 when they pick up their  next supply of study meals.  At this visit, 
participants will be weighed and any new medication/supplements will be reported .  Participants experiencing 
hunger or weight change  of ≥±3%  of clinic visit 1 weight  will be  placed on the next higher or lower kcal level as 
appropriate. A stool collection kit and 24 -hour urine collection kit will be provided for use on the penultimate 
day of F eeding Period 1.  Participants will complete urine and stool collections at home in pr eparation for Clinic  
Visit 2.   
4.5 Clinic Visit 2 (Feeding Period 1, Day 22  
Participants return to the clinic on day 22  of Feeding Period 1  for the second fasting blood draw and measure 
weight. Study  staff also receive and process u rine and stool specimens  that were collected  at-home on the 
penultimate day of Feeding Period 1 . Study s taff review instructions for the  washout period (approximately the  
next three weeks and answer any participant questions.  Staff will provide  participants with $25.00 as 
compensation.  
4.6 Clinic Visit 3 (Feeding Period 2, Day 1)  
After concluding an approximately three -week washout period, participants return to the clinic on D ay 1 of 
Feeding Period 2 for repeat anthr opometric measurements (weight and waist circumference).  To conserve 
resources, blood, urine and stool are not collected again at this visit; end of study diet samples are adjusted for 
baseline samples as we have done in other feeding studies.59, 62  Using the study calendar, study s taff review  
instructions for the next three weeks ( Feeding Period 2) , meal pick-up/delivery, proper food storage and 
reheating and answer any  participant questions. Clinic visit 3 concludes with participants  being provided the 
first three days of F eeding Period 2 meals and corresponding daily meal check -off forms.  
4.7 Feeding Period 2  (Feeding Period 2, Days 1 – 221)   
Similar to Feeding Period 1, a  3- to 4-day supply of study meals and daily meal check -off lists will be picked 
up.). Halfway through Feeding Period 2, participants will attend check -in Visit  2 when they pick up their  next 
supply of study meals.  At this visit, participants will be wei ghed and any new medications/supplements  will be 
reported. Participants experiencing hunger or weight changes  of ≥±3%  from Clinic Visit 3  are placed on the 
next higher or lower kcal level as appropriate. A stool collection kit and 24- hour urine collection kit will be 
provided for use on the penultimate day  of Feeding Period 2 .  Participants will complete urine and stool 
collections at home in preparation for Clinic Visit 4.  
4.8 Clinic Visit 4 and End of Study Visit (Feeding Period 2, Day 22 ) 
Participants return for a final time to the clinic on  Day 22  of Feeding Period 2 for the end- of-study  fasting blood 
draw and repeat anthr opometr ic measurements (weight and waist circumference). Study  staff will receive and 
process the  urine and stool specimens , which the participant s completed at -home in preparation for Clinic Visit 
4.  Staff answers all participant questions  and provides the End- of-Study Thank -you Letter and $75 .00 as 
compensation.

 4.9 Ongoing Study Procedures 
Blood, urine and stool samples are processed at clinic visits using standard procedures and are stored at -
80°C until analysis. Throughout the study, participants maintain usual physical activity, but are asked to refrain 
from starting new act ivities that may alter total energy expenditure and energy intake needs. Participants are 
advised to continue to take prescription medications (if needed) but should check with study staff if new prescription or over -the-counter medications are used  as thi s can affect the metabolome. Similarly, participants 
may continue usual dietary supplements (if any) but should not start new supplements. Participants may 
consume alcohol but must provide their own alcohol and will report type and amounts. Study staff will be  
available by phone,  or email throughout the study should questions arise and to assist with retention.   
4.10 Consents 
All informed consent procedures and documentation is done in compliance with Fred Hutchinson Institutional 
Review Office Policy.  
 
Consent  for screening . Individuals who visit the Online screening questionnaire will be explicitly asked to 
provide consent (via checkbox) to complete the screening questionnaire.  
 
Study  Informed Consent . At the Orientation visit , the informed consent dis cussion will occur and participants  
will be asked to sign the Fred Hutch Study Informed Consent and each participant will be provided a copy of 
the consent .    
4.11 Design of Feeding Study Meals  
Feeding study menus are developed by the Fred Hutch Human Nutrition Lab (HNL) staff  using Pronutra® 
(Viocare Technologies, Inc., Princeton, NJ), which is a metabolic diet management system specifically designed for conducting feeding studies. Two seven- day, eucaloric repeating menu cycles  are created: (1) 
HEI-2015 with no red and processed meat and (2) HEI -2015- M with red and processed meat as some of the  
protein sources. The USDA defines red meat as “any red pigmented meat and includes beef, lamb, pork, veal 
and game meats”.
36 This study  will primarily utilize beef and pork due to budgetary  and logistic  restraints  to 
obtain veal and game meats . A variety of types and cuts of red meat will be  used (e.g., round, chuck, top 
sirloin) and cooking methods  will include broiling, braising and roasting. No meats will be  cooked by open 
flame or undergo charring. The USDA defines processed meat as “any meat that has undergone 
transformation through salting, curing, fermentation, or ot her processes to enhance flavor or improve 
preservation”.36 A variety of processed meat will be  used for HEI -2015- M. The HEI-2015 -M menus  will include 
at least one daily serving of red or processed meat; other protein sources (eggs, poultry, fish, legumes ,) may 
be used if needed to meet the daily protein goals. The HEI -2015 menus  will include no red or processed meat 
and protein sources will include eggs, poultry, fish and beans/legumes. Th e seven- day cycle menu  will repeat 
three times over each 21 -day feeding period. Diets will be  created at 7 different kcal levels, 1800 kcal to 3000 
kcal per day, in 200 kcal increments. Each day is matched within diet group for energy and for the cup and ounce equivalents for each food group, and food groups in each meal are identical across arms excluding the 
protein foods. Individual energy requirements for participants are estimated using the Mifflin equation.
92 
Participants reporting hunger or weight changes are placed on the next higher or lower kcal level as 
appropriate. Weight should remain stable ( + 3% of clinic visit 1 and clinic visit 3 weights ) throughout the study.  
All foods consumed by participants throughout the study will be  prepared by HNL staff who have extensive 
experience with metabolic studies . All food items are individually weighed or portioned out for each participant 
and clearly labeled by meal. Study foods are precooked and frozen and are picked up  by participants on site 
at Fred Hutch.  Safe food handling, storage and reheating instructions are included.   
4.12 Compliance .  
Compliance to the intervention will be evaluated by  daily meal check -off forms , the mid-feeding period check -in 
with the study dietitian .   
5. DATA COLLECTION  
This study involves a total of seven  participant visits . Visits will occur  as follows :  1) Orientation Visit (pre -
study). 2) Clinic Visit 1 (B aselin e; Day 1 of F eeding Period 1) , 3) Midpoint Visit 1 ( ~Day 1 0 of Feeding Period 
 
EAT-WELL Study Protocol_V 3  10 
 1), 4) Clinic Visit 2 ( Day 2 2, the day after the end  of Feeding Period 1) , 5) Clinic Visit 3  (Day 1 of Feeding 
Period 2), 6) Midpoint Visit 2 ( ~Day 1 0 of Feeding Period 2), and 7) Clinic Visit 4  (end of study; Day 22 the day 
after the end  of Feeding Period 2) .  At the O rientation Visit, the study Lifestyle  Questionnaire will be completed.  
At all clinic visits, participants will undergo assessments of anthropometrics,  and on clinic visits 1, 2 and 4 they  
will bring stool and urine samples  collected at home and will provide fasting blood.   
   
Twelve -hour fasting blood.  Fasting blood samples will be collected on Day 1 of the first Feeding period, and on 
Day 22 of the first feeding period and Day 2 2 of the second feeding period.  Vacutainers will be labeled with 
participants’ study ID and date, processed per standard protocol  and stored at - 80ºC.   
 
Stool sample:  Stool samples will be collected by participants at home p rior to Clinic Visits the beginning (Clinic 
Visit 1)  and end of Feeding Period 1 (Clinic Visit 2) and the end of Feeding Period 2 ( end of study, Clinic Visit 
4). 
 
Urine sample:  24-hour urine samples will be collected by participants at home prior to Clinic Visits at the 
beginning (Clinic Visit 1)  and end of Feeding Period 1 (Clinic Visit 2) and the end of Feeding Period 2 (end of 
study, Clinic Visit 4 ). 
 
Questionnaires :  
 
Lifestyle Q uestionnaire.   Date of birth, self -identified r ace/ethnicity, gender identi ty, education, smoking, 
alcohol use, recreational drug use,  over-the-counter  and prescription drug use, dietary supplement use, 
physical activity levels  and general health history w ill be collected at the V isit 1 (self-administered 
questionnaire).  
 
Daily meal check -off forms .  All participants will complete study provided meal check -off forms  to record 
and quantify daily meals consumed each day during both feeding periods.   
5.1 Outcomes  
5.1.1  Metabolome  
Fasting blood, 24-hour urine, and fecal  samples collected at baseline and after each diet period for each 
participant.  Shifts in the metabolome will be characterized by conducting metabolomics assays on the blood 
urine, and fecal  samples and comparing the readouts between the HEI -2015 and HEI -2015- M diets.  
5.1.2  Microbiome 
Stool DNA will be extracted from the fecal  samples collected at baseline and after each diet period for each 
participant . Modulation of the gut microbial community will be characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of 
the extracted genomic DNA and comparing the readouts between the HEI-2015 and HEI -2015- M diets.  
In addition, digital droplet PCR assays will be conducted to measure changes in the genes for butyrate kinase 
(buk) and nitrate reductase (narG) , and archival samples will be collected to conduct microbial growth 
experiments .   
5.1.3  Anthropometrics  
Height and waist circumference will be measured at the orientation visit  only, and weight will be measured at  
the beginning, midpoint and end of each feeding period for each participant.    
6. PARTICIPANT RISKS  AND BENEFITS  
6.1 Potential Risks  
1. Participants may experience a little discomfort or have a temporary bruise from having blood drawn.  
Occasionally a participant may feel lightheaded or feel faint when having blood drawn since blood is 
drawn after a 12 hour fast . The amount of blood drawn for this study does not  exceed 50 ml  total over the 
11 week study and does not occur more than twice weekly.   
 
EAT-WELL Study Protocol_V 3  11 
 2. Some participants may feel that coming to study visits and consuming only study -provided foods for two 
3-week periods is burdensome.  
3. Some partic ipants may find it inconvenient or uncomfortable to collect their urine and stool.  
 
6.2 Protection Against Risks  
In the event that this research activity results in an injury, medical treatment will be available, including first aid, 
emergency treatment and f ollow up care, as needed.  All procedures involving blood collection and 
anthropometry will be done at the Fred Hutch Prevention Center Clinic.  Participants will collect urine and stool 
samples at home. Food is carefully and safely prepared under highly c ontrolled conditions. Trained staff will be 
available to assist should a medical emergency occur.  An MD licensed in Washington State is the Prevention Center Director. Participants will be informed in the written consent form that payment for any such treatment 
must be provided by the individual and/or the individual’s insurance company.    
1. Participants may experience a little discomfort, bruising, fainting or phlebitis from having blood drawn.  We 
will minimize these risks by making sure that all blood draws are conducted by well -trained nurses , medical 
assistants,  or phlebotomists at the Fred Hutch Prevention Center.  Participants will be asked before the 
blood draw if they have experienced problems with blood draws in the past, and they will be offered an opportunity to lie down during the procedure if they wish. After the blood draw is complete, participants will 
remain seated, applying pressure to the site of venipuncture. If a participant feels faint, they will be 
instructed to lie down until the feeling goes away. We provide a small snack and fluids after the blood draw. 
In our experience, blood draws performed in this manner are well tolerated, and any side effects are 
minimal.  
2. We will make every effort to schedule participants to come to the Fred Hutch at times that are convenient for them ; most participants f ind that morning appointments work well for the fasting blood draws .  During the 
approximately 3-week “washout” period, participants will be allowed to eat whatever foods they like.   
3. Participants will be provided all necessary supplies as well as instructi ons to help in the collection of stool 
and urine specimens. In addition, they will be provided with opaque bags to discretely carry specimens to 
their study visit. Study staff will be available by telephone should the participant have any questions or 
complications when collection these specimens.  
 
6.3 Benefits  
The data generated from this proposed clinical trial will provide essential information for participants regarding 
the effects of red and processed meat  in the context of an overall healthy dietary pattern  on the metabolome 
and microbiome of healthy adults.   
 
The research we propose here is important because if a specific nutritional intervention can be shown to 
improve measures of the metabolome and the microbiome, then it will provide compelling prelim inary  data to 
then launch a larger clinical trial which could, potentially, have far reaching implications for thousands healthy 
adult members of the general population. Thus, with minimal risk to study participants, we will generate data that will be beneficial to general dietary guidance  related to health promotion and disease prevention –  
including cancer prevention.   
 
Overall, using this rigorous study design (randomized cross -over feeding trial), we have attempted to minimize 
any potential risks to study participants, whilst maximizing the amount of important scientific data that can be 
generated and ultimately shared with the scientific community and the general public.  
6.4 
Compensation 
Participants will be paid $100 total, $25 at the end of the first feeding period and $75 at the end of the second 
feeding period to help compensate for time and travel.  All food will be provided for the two feeding periods.  
6.5 Alternatives  
Alternatives to participating in this research study include not participating.

 7. DATA ANALYSIS PLAN 
This trial  identifies (1) the extent and nature of metabolomic shifts and (2)  as a secondary aim,  modulation of 
the gut microbiome when consuming a standard HEI -2015 diet compared to a HEI -2015 -M diet.  We expect 
that daily intake of red and processed meat will induce shifts in the metabolome detected in blood and urine 
samples, and secondarily  in the  gut microbiome detected in extracted fecal DNA.  Under the NIH R21 
mechanism, it is considered a preliminary trial.  
 
Statistical Analysis for the Primary Aim .  Aim 1 identifies metabolomic markers that differ between HEI -2015 
and HEI -2015 -M. Metabolites fr om NMR and LC/MS -MS platforms will be used to allow greater coverage of 
the metabolome and as shown feasible by Dr. Raftery97 and others.98 Metabolite levels are normalized by 
dividing by the batch’s median value followed by removing metabolites with >25% CVs in the embedded 
blinded duplicates as well as those with >20% missing values (expected at 5- 10% of total). Next , we will use 
unsupervised principal components analysis (PCA) to visually examine the data patterns and variability. We 
then apply supervised orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS -DA) to identify candidate 
biomarkers that may differ by diet arm. VIP (variable importance in projection) scores >2 will be retained. For each identified metabolite, separat e linear mixed models will be  fit to examine fold- changes in end of diet 
period metabolite levels by HEI -2015 and HEI -2015- M, adjusting for baseline. In the cross -over design each 
participant is their own control, minimizing noise in intra -individual variation in endogenous metabolites. The 
cross- over design also minimizes confounding by age, BMI, and diet order, but models are run with and 
without these adjustments. The Benjamini -Hochberg approach controls for false discovery rate (FDR) <0.10.
99  
Statistical Analysis for the Secondary Aim .  To account for different sequencing depths, we will initially apply 
the centered -log ratio (CLR) transformation to each sample after replacing any zero counts by 1 or a small 
imputed value.104 We will first gauge the overall strength of microbial signal by applying a microbiome- wide 
kernel -association test fusing a GLMM -MiRKAT105 with respect to the weighted UniFrac distance.106, 107 
Analyses will account for the crossover study design using linear mixed models with outcome of either genera, 
alpha diversity, or genes for butyrate kinase (buk ) or nitrate reductase ( narG ), adjusting for baseline. As with 
Aim 1,  we will conduct analyses with and without adjustment for age, BMI, diet order and other covariates. We 
will use Benjamini -Hochberg approach to account for FDR <0.10.99 Based on our studies62 and that of others58 
we expect to have 80% power to detect β coefficients in the linear mixed models in the range of 0.3-  04 for 
differences between diets at p<0.05. Primary analysis focuses on three genera associated with butyrate 
production and three genera associated with nitrate reduction. All genera will be examined in exploratory 
analysis.108  
7.1 Sample Size  for the Primary A im  
The sample size is based on the primary aim. For this  pilot trial with a fixed sample size of  20 participants , we 
estimate that we expect to have 80% power to detect fold changes between diets of + 0.20 for blood and urine 
metabolites . Power calculations used MetSizeR .110 Tests are  2-sided α=5% .   
8. DATA SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
Oversight for this study will be provided by the Principal Investigator, Dr. Marian Neuhouser with delegation of 
responsibilities to designated Co -Investigators and study personnel. Dr. Neuhouser  will ensue all entry criteria 
are met prior to the initiation of the protocol, and all study procedures and reporting of adverse events are 
performed according to the IRB -approved protocol. Study participants are healthy adult volunteers , in whom 
the study intervention is non- therapeutic.   
8.1 Adverse Event Reporting 
All adverse events related to the study procedures will be fully documented on the appropriate case report 
form(s) and entered in a study database. For each adverse event, the investigator will pr ovide the onset, 
duration, intensity, treatment required, and outcome, including documentation of need for premature termination of any study procedures.  Anticipated adverse events for this study are expected to be very minimal 
since the diet activities have been safely used in many previous intervention studies without incident. Despite 
the low risk for adverse events, all study staff and investigators will carefully monitor and document any 
adverse events , which could include the following: bruising or fainting during the blood draws , and possible risk 
 
EAT-WELL Study Protocol_V 3  13 
 of food borne illness  if the participant does not follow the instructions provided for safe food handling, storage, 
and re -heating of the study foods  
 
Serious Adverse Events will be reported within to the Principal Investigator within 24 hours . Adverse event 
reporting to the IRO will occur within the required period of time depending on the nature and severity of the event . 
8.2 Plan for safety review  
The PI s will perform a cumulative review of all adverse events and premature terminations review every 6 
months after study initiation.  
8.3 Plan for annual reporting 
A summary of the investigation including all adverse events and how they were handled, enrollment, drop -outs 
and reason for discontinuation and any protocol modifications will be provided to the IRB on an annual basis.  
Annual Reports will contain:  
a. The number of adverse events and an explanation of how each event was handled  
b. The number of complaints and how each complaint was handled  
c. The number of subject withdrawals and an explanation of why the subject withdrew or was withdrawn  
d. The number of protocol deviations and how each was handled  
8.4 Monitoring for data integrity and safety  
Monitoring for data integrity and safety will be t he responsibility of the investigators . Investigators will include 
the following in routine monitoring review: A) Validity and integrity of data: Data are checked for missing, 
unusual, or impossible values  when they are entered into the study’s computer database. B) Enrollment rate 
relative to expectation: Early lags in recruitment will be rectified with increased recruitment efforts so that recruitment will be completed on time. The investigators will monitor this closely to ensure full enrollment of 
appropriate participants. C) Retention of par ticipants and adherence to protocol: The investigators will monitor 
retention and adherence to study protocol. Adherence to the intervention will be monitored via  daily meal 
check -off forms and by monitoring amounts of study foods consumed/not consumed.

Enrolled Subject Any subject who signs an informed consent form for 
participation in the study .
Interventional Clinical T rial A research trial that prospectivel y assigns, whether 
randomly  or not, human participants or groups of humans to 
one or more health -related interventions to evaluate the 
effects on health outcomes, and/or a research trial in which 
diagnostic or monitoring procedures bey ond standard of care 
are conducted and generate outcomes for use in analy sis of
data.
Investigational Product (IP) Is defined as a preventative (vaccine), a therapeutic (drug or 
biologic), device, diagnostic, or palliative used as a test or 
control product in a clinical trial, including a product with a 
marketing authorization when used or assembled 
(formulated or packaged) in a way  different from the 
authorized form, or when used for an unauthorized

A serious deterioration in the health of the subject 
that either resulted in:
a.a life -threatening illness or injury .
Note: Life -threatening means that the 
individual was at immediate risk of death fr om 
the event as it occurr ed, ie, it does not include 
an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death had it occurr ed in a mor e sever e 
form.
b.any potentially  sight -threatening event or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a 
body  function.
c.in-patient hospitalization or prolonged
hospitalization.
Note: Planned hospitalization for a pr e-
existing condition, without serious 
deterioration in health, is not consider ed a 
serious adverse event. In general, 
hospitalization signifies that the individual 
remained at the hospital or emer genc y war d 
for observation and/or tr eatment (usually 
involving an overnight stay) that would not 
have been appr opriate in the physician's office 
or an out -patient setting. Complications that 
occur during hospitalization ar e adverse 
events. If a complication pr olongs 
hospitalization or fulfills any other serious 
criteria, the event is serious. W hen in doubt as 
to whether “ hospitalization ” occurr ed, the 
event should be consider ed serious.
d.a medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
a) or b). 
e.any indirect harm as a consequence of 
incorrect diagnostic test results when used 
within manufacturer ’s instructions for use.

Use Error Act or omission of an act that results in a dif ferent medical 
device response than inten ded by  manufacturer or expected 
by user. Note: This definition includes slips, lapses, and

7INVESTIGA TIONAL  PLAN
7.1 Study Design
This will be a prospective, randomized,  controlled, double -
masked, parallel -group, daily wear clinical study .
This clinical study will engage approximately  16clinic sites to enroll approximately  
160 subjects with approximately  10 - 15 subjects per site. 
Subjects will be expected to attend 4
office visits: Screening/Baseline/Dispense, We ek 1 
Follow -
up, M onth 1 Follow - up, and Month 3 Follow up/Exit. The total expected duration of 
participation for each subject is approximately  3-4 months with approximately  3 months of 
exposure to study  lenses in this daily  wear study . Subjects will be randomized to wear either 
thetest contact lenses in both eyes or the control Biofinity contact lenses in both 
eyes.
Following randomization, study  lenses will be dispensed to the subject.  
 
Subjects will wear the lenses while awake in a daily wear modality . CLEAR CARE will be 
used for dail y cleaning and disinfection.

12ANAL YSIS PLAN
Data from a subset of subjects in the CL Y935 -C010 study  will be com bined with data from 
this study . This combined set will serve as the basis for all planned analy ses for the primary  
and secondary  effectiveness objectives. Subjects in CL Y935 -C010 will be included in the 
combined set only  if they satisfy  the following crit erion:
BCV A of 20/20 or better in each ey e at the Screening/Baseline/Dispense Visit
 
 
 
 
 
 
.
12.1 Subject Evaluability
Final subject evaluability must be determined prior to breaking the code for masked treatment 
(lens) assignment and locking the database,  
12.2 Analysis Sets
12.2.1 Safety Analysis Set
Safety  anal yses will be conducted using the safet y anal ysis set on a treatment -emergent basis.
As such, the safety  anal ysis set will include all subjects/eyes exposed to any stud y lenses
evaluated in this study , 
For treatment- emergent safety analy ses, subjects/ey es will be categorized 
under the actual study  lenses exposed.
12.2.2 Full Analysis Set

lenses evaluated in this study , , and who have at least one 
post-baseline ( post-Dispense) CL CDV A.

met any  of the critical deviation or evaluability  criteria identified in the DEP .
12.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
Demographic information, recent lens -wearing experience (including wear modality  and 
wear success), and habitual lens information will be presented b y lens group and overall.
Counts and percentages will be presented for categorical variables such as sex, age group, 
race, an ethnicity . Number of observations, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum will 
bepresented for continuous variables such as age.
12.4 Effectiveness Analyses
This study  defines 1 primary , 1 secondary ,  
 
 
 
 
 
 
12.4.1 Analysis of Primary Effectiveness Endpoint(s)
The primary  effectiveness objective is to demonstrate noninferiorit y of 
 compared to 
Biofinity  in mean CL CDV A at Week 1 Follow-up.
The primary  endpoint is the mean CL CDV A at Week 1 Follow- up. The corresponding 
assessment is collected with study  lenses, in Snellen, for each ey e. Conversion will be made 
to the logMAR scale. 
12.4.1.1 Statistical Hypotheses
The null and alternative hy potheses are formulated in terms of the predefined margin of 0.10 
(in logMAR scale) for noninferiority :
H0: μ(T)− μ(C)≥ 0.10
Ha: μ(T)− μ(C)< 0.10

where μ(T)andμ(C)denote the Week 1 Follow -up mean CLCDV A for and Biofinity  
contact lenses, respectively , on the logMAR scale .
12.4.1.2 Analysis Methods
A mixed ef fects repeated measures model will be utilized to t est these hypotheses. The model 
will include terms for lens, visit (Dispense, W eek 1 Follow -up, Month 1 Follow -up, and 
Month 3 Follow -up), and lens -by-visit interaction as fixed ef
fects,  
 Within-subject correlation due to eye will 
also be accounted for in the model. Lens dif ference ( minus Biofinity) and the 
corresponding two- sided 95% CI  will be computed for 1 -Week Follow -up. Noninferiorit y in 
CLCDVA will be declared if the upper confidence limit is less than 0.10.
12.4.2 Analysis of Secondary Effectiveness Endpoints
The secondary  effectiveness o bjective is to demonstrate noninferiorit y of 
 compared 
to Biofinity  in the percentage of subjects achieving distance V A 20/20 or better ,in each ey e, 
at Week 1 Follow -up.
The corresponding endpoint is the percentage (proportion) of subjects with CL CDVA of 
20/20 or better , measured monocularly , in both OD and OS at Week 1 Follow -up.
12.4.2.1 Statistical Hypotheses
The null and alternative hy potheses are formulated in terms of the predefined margin of 0.10 
(10%) for noninferiorit y.
H0: P(T)– P (C)≤ -0.10
Ha: P(T)– P (C)> -0.10
where P (T)and P (C)denote the proportion of subjects attaining at least 20/20 in CL CDV A at
Week1 Follow -up in each ey e (OD and OS) for and Biofinity  contact lenses, 
respectivel y.
12.4.2.2 Analysis Methods
A binary  variable will be defined for each subject to indicate whether the CLCDV A at Week 1 
Follow -up is no worse than 20/20 in both OD and OS, and the corresponding proportion will 
be computed for each lens using the number of subjects as the denominator .

Device Deficiencies
There are no safet y hypotheses planned in this study . The focus of the safet y anal ysis will be 
a comprehensive descriptive assessment of occurrence of AE as well as the other listed 
parameters.

accounted for in the reporting. Safety  anal yses will be conducted using the safet y analysis set 
on a treatment -emergent basis. Descriptive summaries (counts and percentages) for ocular 
and nonocular AEs will be presented by  Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities 
Preferred T erms. AEs leading to study  discontinuation, significant non- serious AEs, and 
SAEs will be identified. Individual subject listings will be provided, a s necessary .

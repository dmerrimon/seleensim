  - 4 -  1.0 INTRODUCTION - BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE   
Dysphagia is a common complication after ACDF.1  PSTS is also a natural sequela of 
ACDF and can lead to airway compromise among other complications .2  Previous studies 
have demonstrated that administration of intravenous methylprednisolone (1mg/kg) after 
anterior cervical spine surgery reduced the incidence of pharyngolaryngeal lesions as 
identified by na sofibroscopic examination .3  Lee et al. prospectively evaluated 50 patients 
and determined that local application of steroids in the retropharyngeal area following 
ACDF reduced PSTS and odynophagia as measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 
and the Nec k Disability Index (NDI) compared to a control group .4  Furthermore, there 
were no adverse events/reactions from local application of steroid on a gel foam sponge 
in the setting of anterior spinal surgery.  There are no studies in the current literature th at 
investigate the incidence of dysphagia with application of local steroids after ACDF, nor 
are there any studies that stratify the efficacy of local steroids compared to intravenous 
steroids.  There is also no current spine literature that directly compar es the efficacy of 
intravenous steroids versus local steroids in the incidence of dysphagia  or dysphonia.  
Our study will be the first in the literature to assess the efficacy of local steroids in 
reducing the incidence of dysphagia after anterior cervical  spine surgery, and  as a result, 
may improve patient outcomes after  ACDF.  
 
Dysphagia and dysphonia are common complications after anterior cervical spine 
surgery .1 Despite  their clinical importance, studies on the treatment and/or prevention of 
these compl ications are limited due to the lack of valid and reliable outcome measures. 
The majority of research is found in the otolaryngology literature and has focused on 
disease pathophysiology, diagnosis, and therapy.   
 
The Bazaz score has been used in the spin e literature to evaluate dysphagia after anterior 
cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) .5 This is a subjective questionnaire that has not 
been validated in the literature.  Additionally, n ew patient -centered outcome measures, 
the Eating Assessment Tool (EA T-10) and Voice Handicap Index (VHI -10) have  recently  
been developed, and in addition to the Bazaz score, have been shown to have excellent 
validity and reliability in the ENT patient population.6 These instruments can be used to 
document the initial dysph agia or dysphonia severity and monitor the treatment response 
in people with a wide array of swallowing and voice disorders.   
 
2.0 OBJECTIVES  
 To determine if the use of steroids decreases the incidence of dysphasia after 
anterior cervical discectomy and f usion (ACDF) .   
 If steroids are useful, determine which method of steroid administration is most 
efficacious (IV versus local application).   
 We hypothesize that local application of steroids in ACDF surgery will lead to a 
decreased incidence of dysphagia,  in the postoperative period as compared to 
intravenous steroids or a control group . 
 To evaluate the  incidence of dysphonia, as measured by the Voice Handicap 
Index (VHI -10), as well as other validated outcome measures (NDI, VAS, EQ -
5D).

  - 5 -  3.0 SELECTION O F SUBJECTS  
 3.1 INCLUSION  CRITERIA : 
 All p atients undergoing ACDF (single or multi -level) for the treatment of  
cervical  radiculopathy or myelopathy with Drs. Hsu, Patel, and Savage.  
 All subject s must have given signed, informed consent prior to registration  on 
study.  
  
 3.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
 Patients undergoing revision surgery, any operations fo r trauma, infection, 
tumor  
 Patients  with general metabolic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, 
chronic heart and renal diseases.   
 
4.0 SUBJEC T REGISTRATIO N  
The subjects will be recruit ed by the PI, co-investigator s, or authorized study staff  at the 
orthopaedic surgery clinic or prior to their ACDF surgery in the pre -operative hold area 
in. The study will be reviewed with the subjects and they will be conse nted by the PI, co -
investigator, or other authorized study staff.  
 
Each collaborating site will be involved in subject recruitment, consent, and all data 
collection for any patients that are enrolled in the study at each respective site.  
 
5.0 STUDY DESIGN  & METHODS  
We inte nd to prospectively evaluate 85 patients as part of a single blind, randomized 
controlled study.   Subjects would be randomized to group I (control group , no steroid ), 
group II ( 10 mg of intraoperative intravenous decadron  with gel foam  sponge placed on 
cervical plate ), or group III (40mg of triamcinolone on gel foam  sponge  dabbed on the 
anterior cervical plate ).  Subjects will be blinded to the treatment arm.  Randomization 
will take place on the day of surgery.  85 envelopes will be  sealed, 25 of which will 
contain a document specifying “control”, “iv steroids”, or “steroid sponge”.  The 75 
envelopes will then be shuffled to create a random assortment.  The circulating nurse in 
the OR will at random choose one envelop prior to the st art of the operative procedure.  
This will in turn specify the treatment group for each patient.  
 
There is no standard of care regarding the use of IV or local steroids in the setting of 
ACDF.  Currently, the use of either IV or local steroids is at the di scretion of the 
attending surgeon.  To my knowledge, there are several spine surgeons at our institution 
that current ly use no steroid, and other s who use a combination of IV and/or local 
steroids.       
The primary outcome measure is the incidence of dysph agia as measured by Eating 
Assessment Tool (EAT -10) and the Bazaz score.  The patients will prospectively fill out 
these surveys preoperatively, post -operative day 1, week 2, week 6, month 3 , month 6, 
and 1 year  as a measure of dysphagia.    The standard o f care is to see patients in the 
office at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months , 6 months, and 1 year  after surgery, and therefore, 
no extra visits will be necessary for this study.   X-rays will be taken at 6 weeks, 3 
 
Version Date: 12/14/2015  
  - 6 -  months, and 12 months post -op, which is the curr ent standard of care.  No additional x -
rays will be obtained.   
 
A secondary outcome measure will be the incidence of dysphonia, as measured by the 
Voice Handicap Index (VHI -10), as well as other validated outcome measures (NDI, 
VAS, EQ -5D).  The questionn aires will take approximately 20 minutes  to complete and 
will be administered in the hospital , during the post -operative clinic visits with the 
surgeon , or over the phone . The surgeons will also listen to the patient’s voice at these 
different time points and comment on dysphonia as being absent, mild, moderate, or 
severe.  
 
Additionally, a chart review will be performed from 11/01/2013  to 12/30/2016  from  NMH 
Medical records (PRIMES, Cerner PowerChart) and NMFF Medical Records (EpicCare, 
IDX/GE Cen tricity)  to obtain the following data: Complications such as infection, post -
operative hematoma, airway compromise, and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy . All data 
collected from chart review will be de -identified and noted on the Data Collection  Form . 
Each subject will be assigned a study number and all data will be linked to that number 
using the Coded Identifier List. The PI will identify which charts will be reviewed. The 
chart review will be performed by the PI, co -investigators, or authorized study 
coordinator.  
 
There are potential physical risks from being in this study.  The use of steroids may have 
an adverse effect on wound healing and/or transiently elevate blood sugar.  There have 
been no documented wound complications from using either IV or loca l steroids in the 
setting of ACDF.  Furthermore, we  purposely excluded patients with a history of diabetes 
or other endocrine disorder in an attempt to minimize this potenti al side -effect or 
complication.  Another  possible risk related with participation in  this study is the loss of 
privacy. To reduce these risks, all of the information collected will be de -identified and 
stored in a password protected file on a password protected computer. Additionally, some 
of the questions asked in the surveys may be upse tting, or the subject may feel 
uncomfortable answering them. If the subject does not wish to answer a question, they 
may skip it and go to the next question.  
 
6.0 STATISTICAL PLAN  
We will  use T score or ANOVA to compare EAT -10 scores , VHI scores, and EQ-5D, and 
Chi square for subjectiv e findings .  The P value will be set at 0.05 . 
 
A power analysis was performed to determine the sample size needed.  Based on 
previous studies evaluating the EAT -10 in normal patients and those with dysphasia the 
analysis concl uded: w ith total sample size 85 (Group I: 25, Group II: 25, Group III: 25) 
and estimated standard deviation of EAT -10 as 12.7, power = 0.92  
 
Drs. Savage, Patel, and Hsu, perform approximately 6 ACDFs a month. This would allow 
us to collect our proposed sample size in approximately 12-14 months.

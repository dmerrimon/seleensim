 4 2. INTRODUCTION  
Patients with CD19+ B cell malignancies  such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 
indolent and mantle cell lymphoma, and diffuse large cell lymphoma that progress after first and 
second line conventional chemotherapy have a poor long-term  prognosis, especially if they are 
not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplant due to the lack of a donor, or if stem cell 
transpla nt is contraindicated. This protocol will evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of 
adoptively transferring autologous T cells that are genetically modified with a self -inactivating 
(SIN) lentiviral vector to express a CD19-specific chimeric antigen re ceptor (CAR) to patients 
with advanced CD19+ B-lineage malignancies.  
 
3. BACKGROUND  
3A. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)    
 CLL is the most prevalent adult leukemia and patients may have an indolent or 
aggressive clinical course.  Tumor cells nearly universally express the CD19 antigen and variable to low density of CD20.  Asymptomatic patients without a large disease burden at diagnosis are 
usually observed until their disease progresses and requires  therapy.  Patients with high risk 
features including non-mutated immunoglobulin genes, expression of ZAP-70, CD38, and/or adverse genetic changes  (11q23 or 17p-) detected by cytogenetics or FISH often progress more 
rapidly to symptomatic disease and require treatment to control disease burden and reduce symptoms 
1.   
 For patients requiring antitumor therapy, the recent addition of monoclonal antibody therapy to combination chemotherapy has become standard of care .  For medically fit patients 
less than 65 years of age, the CLL8 trial b y the German CLL group demonstrated higher 
complete remission ( CR) rates, longer progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival ( OS) 
for patients randomized to fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab ( FCR ) chemotherapy 
compared to FC chemotherapy al one 
2.  In this trial, lower levels of minimal residual disease 
(MRD) as detect ed by flow cytometry 2 months after the completion of therapy were correlated 
with improved PFS and OS 3. Other approaches include combinations of fludarabine and 
rituximab or bendamustine and rituximab and are often used in older patients or those with comorbid medical co nditions.  
 Unfortunately, current treatments for CLL are not curative and patients remain at a 
continuous risk of relapse.  The prognosis for patients relapsing after first line therapy is vari able 
but largely dependent on the duration and depth of first remission  and on the interim 
development of adverse genetic risk features such as 17p deletion .  For patients with long 
remissions (> 2 years), the initial treatment can often be repeated.  However, the response rate, depth and duration of remission are usually shorter  with subsequent therapy. Patients with short 
remissions after initial aggressive chemoimmunotherapy or who have developed fludarabine refractory disease (less than partial response ( PR) to therapy or relapse within 6-12 months ) have 
a poor prognosis with median OS of < 2 years and are candidates for aggressive treatments , 
including allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ).   
 Patients beyond first or second relapse are in need of novel experimental treatments.  
Curre nt approaches include the use of new agents targeting the B cell Ig receptor signaling 
pathway including PI3kinase-delta with GS -1101 (CAL-101) and the Brutons Tyrosine kinase 
(BTK) inhibitor, ibrutinib (PCI 32765) 
4, 5.  Allogeneic HCT using HLA matched related or 
unrelated donors following non-myeloablative conditioning may provide a curative option, however there is significant risk of non relapse mortality of approximately 25% at 1 year due to 
 5 GVHD and/or infections 6.  The recent demonstration that adoptive T cell therapy  with 
autologous T cells engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor specific for CD19 in duced 
complete and sustained remissions in 2 of  3 patients  with refractory CLL provides an additional 
treatment option for these patients  7, 8.   
 
3B.  Indolent Lymphoma and Mantle Cell Lymphoma   
 The indolent lymphomas represent a wide group of tumors predominately comprising 
follicular, small lymphocytic, marginal cell and lymphoplasmacytic histologies  that often have a 
long natural history characterized by continuous relaps es.   Patients with asymptomatic disease at  
presentation  and with low tumor bulk are usually observed and not treated until the development 
of symptoms or significant disease progression.  Several recent studies presented in abstract form have demonstrated  that single agent rituximab,  given for short or extended schedules has a high 
response rate and delay s the time to requiring next therapy 
9, 10.   However, these studies have not 
yet shown an impact on OS and this practice is not standard.  For medically fit patients requiring therapy, combination chemo -immunotherapy is emerging as the standard of care.  Multiple 
studies have demonstrated that the addition of rituximab to combination or single agent chemotherapy (CHOP, CVP or Bendamustine) results in longer PFS and in some trials prolonged OS 
11-13.  Following initial therapy, many patients are treated for up to 2-years with maintenance 
rituximab using a variety of schedules.  The PRIMA study in patients with follicular non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL ) demonstrated a decrease in the risk of progression at 2 years by 
50% by this strategy, although there was no difference in OS 
14.   
 As in CLL, patients  with indolent lymphoma who relapse following initial therapy may 
be treated again with the same or similar regimen.  Patients with early relapse, or those who progress on rituximab maintenance are considered rituximab refractory.  There is no standard of 
care for the treatment of patients with relapsed indolent NHL, and the usual approaches include 
the use of agents singly or in combination that had not been given as initial therapy ( such as 
bendamus tine and rituximab in patients failing R -CVP or R-CHOP) , or more aggressive salvage 
therapies  and autologous HCT.  Unfortunately, these treatments are generally not curative.   
 P atients  with recurrent or progressive indolent lymphoma may be candidates for 
allogeneic HCT , which can result in long- term disease f ree survival 
15.  However, as in CLL, the 
treatment is dependent on the identification of an appropriate donor and is associated with significant risks of acute and chronic GVHD and infections.  For transplant eligible patients, the decision to proceed to transplantation is often a matter of personal choice of risk-vs-benefit.  
Patients without donors, those who are not transplant candidates , and those who elect not to 
undergo allogeneic HCT are in need of novel therapies.   
  Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)  represents a chronic relapsing NHL with a more 
aggressive clinical course.  Current standard of care includes induction chemo-immun otherapy 
with regimens such as R -CHOP or HyperCVAD/Mtx/Ara-C 
16.  Patients with responsive disease 
are considered for high-dose therapy and autologous HCT as consolidation in first remission.  A study by the German low-grade lymphoma group demonstrated improved PFS and OS with autologous HCT in first remission com pared with interferon maintenance therapy  
17, 18.  Data 
from the MD Anderson Cancer C enter suggest that patients receiving full course HyperCVAD 
may have similar outcomes without autologous HCT 16. Even with the use of autologous HCT, 
patients appear to remain at risk of relapse with no evidence of a plateau on the PFS curve.  Patients who relapse following autologous HCT, or those unable to receive autologous HCT 
 6 have a poor outcome and are considered for experimental approaches and for allogeneic HCT.  
Surprisingly, allogeneic HCT appears to provide powerful graft-versus-tumor effect against 
MCL and several studies have demonstrated high CR rates  and a low rate of relapse 19. This 
suggests MCL is susceptible to T cell recognition however  as discussed above, the considerable 
risk of morbidity and mortality from GVHD and infection makes proceeding to an allogeneic HCT  a difficult decision  for many patients .  Patients unable to find a donor or unwilling to accept 
the risk of allogeneic HCT are usually treated with single agent or combination  chemotherapy  
with palliative intent.   
 
3C. Diffuse Large Cell and Other Aggressive B Cell Lymphomas  
 The most common histolog ic type of lymphoma is diffuse large B cell (DLBCL), 
representing approximately 30% of the annual incidence of NHL.  In contrast to the indolent NHL’s , these lymphomas require immediate treatment with curative intent. The addition of anti -
CD20 antibody therapy with rituximab to standard CHOP chemotherapy has improved the outcome for patients with DLBC L 
20.  The goal of trea tment is to obtain a CR  as demonstrated 
by a negative positron emission tomography (PET) scan .  Current standards for patients with 
limited stage disease include a short course of R -CHOP followed by involved field irradiation or 
full course R-CHOP.   Patients with advanced stage disease usually receive 6 -8 cycles of R-
CHOP or 6 cycles of dose adjusted EPOCH-R.  Patients who fail to achieve a PET negative CR or those who relapse following CR are treated with salvage therapy with plans for high-dose chemother apy and autologous HCT for those who respond to the salvage regimen .   High dose 
therapy with regimens such as BEAM or CY/TBI/VP-16 or BuMelTT can cure 20-50% of chemotherapy responsive patients and is considered the standard of care for patients responding to salvage chemotherapy who are medically fit for transplant. Unfortunately, patients who relapse early after primary therapy with a regimen containing rituximab, have a worse prognos is 
even with salvage high -dose therapy and autologous HCT 
21. 
 Patients who are unable to undergo autologous HCT or those who relapse following 
autologous HCT have a poor prognosis with a median survival of 6 to 12 months.  Allogeneic 
HCT may be considered in patients who have appropriate donors and chemotherapy sensitive disease that  can be rendered into CR or near CR prior to the transplant 
22.  Evidence for a graft-
versus-lymphoma effect for DLBCL is more limited,  perhaps because class I MHC is absent on a 
high proportion of DLBCL 23, and long-term survival is  achieved  in only 30-40% of patients who 
have minimal disease at the time of allogeneic HCT.  Thus, patients with relapsed aggressive lymphoma who have previously had an autologous HCT or those medically unable to receive autologous HCT have a poor prognosis and are in need of novel treatments.    
 
3D.  Adoptive T cell therapy for human malignancy  
The potential for T cells to eradicate human malignancies is illustrated by the graft -
versus-leukemia effect of allogeneic T cells administered as part of a stem cell transplan t 24, 25; 
and in melanoma patients who receive in vitro expanded, autologous T cells derived from the 
tumor infiltrate and administered after lymphodepleting chemotherap y 26. These approaches  have 
antitumor efficacy, but have been associated with some toxicity related to recognition of normal cells that express the antigen(s) targeted by the infused T cells. Patients that receive allogeneic HCT or donor lymphocyte infusions often develop graft-versus-host disease as a consequence of 
donor T cell recognition of epithelial cells that express minor H antigens  
27, and melanoma 
patients treated with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) may develop vitiligo  due to 
recognition of normal melanocytes 26.  Despite these complications, T cell therapy has cured a 
 7 subset of patients with advanced malignancy that was resistant to conventional chemo therapy 
and/or radiotherapy 26, 27. 
 
3E.  Transfer of tumor targeting receptors into T cells to confer tumor -specificity  
An obstacle for applying T cell therapy more broadly is the difficulty isolating tumor 
reactive T cells from patients with cancer. An approach to overcome th e low frequency of tumor-
reactive T cells in patients is to redirect the specificity of T cells by expressing a transgene that 
encodes a receptor specific for a tumor -associated antigen  (TAA) . Vector systems to deliver 
transgenes into primary human T cells have been developed and clinical trials in which autologous T cells are modified to express a tumor -reactive T cell receptor (TCR) have been 
initiated with transient clinical  responses 
28, 29. However, redirecting T cells to recognize tumor 
antigens through TCR gene transfer is inherently constrained because of the requirement for major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) restricted peptide presentation by tumor cells, and 
because many tumors  including DLBCL express low levels of MHC molecules to avoid T cell 
recognition 
23.  
An alternative method for targeting T cells to tumor cells is to express an artificial 
chimeric non -MHC restricted  antigen  receptor (CAR) that recognizes a tumor cell surface 
molecule 30, 31. A CAR is typically comprised of a fusion gene that encodes a monoclonal 
antibody-derived single chain variable fragment (scFv), consisting of heavy (V H) and light (V L) 
chains joined by a flexible linker, and then fused through a transmembrane domain to a 
cytoplasmic signaling moiety consisting of CD3 ζ alone, or CD3ζ  combined with activation 
domains from costimulatory molecules such as CD28, 4-1BB or OX40 31, 32. CARs with 
specificity for tumor cell -surface epitopes are “universal” in that they bind antigen in an HLA 
independent fashion, and one receptor construct can be used to treat all patients with tumors that 
express the molecule targeted by the CAR.  T cells obtained from the blood of cancer patients can 
be modified with CARs to generate a nti-tumor effector cells (CAR -T cells) for adoptive therapy  
that can recognize tumor cells that have downregulated HLA molecules , thereby avoiding the 
need to isolate rare HLA -restricted tumor -reactive T cells . CARs have been constructed for many 
tumor-associated cell surface molecules including CD19, CD20, EGFR, Her2neu, GD2, PSMA, mesothelin, CAIX and ROR1 
31-36. In vitro studies have demonstrated that both CD4+ and CD8+ 
T cell effector functions can be triggered via CARs, and studies in animal models and in small numbers of patients have demonstrated the capacity of adoptively transferred CAR- T cells to 
eradicate established tumo rs 
7, 8, 37, 38. 
 
3F.  Rationale for targeting CD19 on B cell malignancies with CAR-T cells   
Efforts to target B cell malignancies with CAR -T cells have focused predominantly on 
introducing receptors that recognize surface molecules such as CD19 and CD20 that are restricted in their expression to the B cell lineage. CD20 is present on B cell lymphomas and CLL, and has been targeted effectively with rituximab 
39, 40. However, rituximab is now routinely 
administered to most patients with B cell malignancies and the presence of antibody bound to CD20 can block target recognition by T cells engineered to express a CD20 -specific CAR. CD19 
is a type I transmembrane protein that associates with CD21, TAPA -1, and Leu13 to form a 
signal transduction complex that participates in regulating B cell proliferation  
41. CD19 is 
expressed on all human B cells beginning from the initial lineage commitment until terminal different iation into plasma cells, and is expressed homogeneously on  B cell CLL, indolent and 
mantle cell lymphoma, and  DLBCL. Importantly, CD19 is not expressed on any normal tissue 
 8 apart from B lymphocytes, therefore depletion of normal B cells is  the only anticipated on -target 
toxicity to normal cells of CD19 CAR-T cells 7, 8. 
 
3G.  Clinical experience with the adoptive transfer of T cells genetically modified t o express a 
CAR  
 The initial human trials of CAR -modified T cells employed first generation constructs 
that linked the scFv t o the CD3ζ  or FcR gamma epsilon chain as the only intracellular signaling 
domain. T cells engineered with first generation CARs specific for CAIX were administered to 
patients with renal cell cancer, and caused elevations in liver enzymes possibly due to expression of CAIX on bile duct epithelium 
42.  T cells specific for CD171 (L1CAM) were administered to 
patients  with neuroblastoma without toxicity  43. However, in each of these studies, T cell 
persistence was poor and sustained antitumor effects were not observed.  
Patients with advanced B -cell malignancies have also been treated with first generation 
CARs that were specific for CD20 or CD19. These patients experienced little or no toxicity, but the CAR-T cells persisted poorly and sustained antitumor efficacy was not observed  
28, 44. The 
suboptimal results in these initial trials may reflec t several factors including  the absence of 
signaling domains to provide costimulation necessary for sustained T cell proliferation and survival in first generation CARs; the methods used to engineer and expand T cells for adoptive transfer that required long term culture and favored infusing terminally differentiated effector cells; and the variability in phenotype of the starting population, which can  influence the 
capacity of T cells to persist and function long term in vivo  
44-48.  
To overcome the limitations identified in the initial trials  and e nhance potency , 
costimulatory endodomains were added to CD3 ζ to enhance signaling through the CAR 7, 8, 49-51, 
and improved methods for selecting and transducing T cells of defined phenotype have been developed that do not require long- term culture 
7, 8.The antitumor efficacy of T cells engineered 
to express a CD19-specific CAR and derivatives that include CD28 and/or 4 -1BB signaling 
domains in series with CD3 ζ have been studied in vitro and in pre-clinical in vivo models, and 
receptors that provide costimulation have been superior to those that do not 49, 52 (Hudecek M, 
Riddell SR, unpublished data). Moreover, potent and sustained antitumor activity has been observed in a small number of patients with CLL and NHL treated with autologous CD19 CAR-T cells that include either a 4 -1BB or CD28 signaling domain in the CAR design 
7, 8, 51, 53. In 
these studies, lymphodepleting chemotherapy was administered to enhance T cell persistence, and in some cases , IL-2 was administered after the T cell infusion , although the most impressive 
antitumor responses were observed in patients that did not receive IL-2 
7. The major toxicities of 
CAR -T cells include cytokine release and tumor lysis syndromes that occurred approximately 2 
weeks after infusion of CD19 CAR-T cells, and persistent depletion of normal CD19+ B cells, 
necessitating intravenous immunoglobulin treatment.  There was no o bvious correlation between 
efficacy, toxicity, T cell persistence and the  T cell dose administered to patients  in these initial 
trials  7, 8, 51, 53. The inconsistency in the behavior of the therapeutic products may be because 
polyclonal T cells from the patient were transduced to express the CAR, and the resulting cell products administered to each patient varied greatly in phenotypic composition (CD4, CD8) and subset derivation.  
3H.  Lymphodepleting chemotherapy improves persistence of transferre d T cells  
Clinical trials of T cell therapy for melanoma at the National Cancer Institute 
demonstrated that administering lymphodepleting chemotherapy such as fludarabine and 
 9 Cytoxan, or fludarabine, cytoxan and total body irradiation, prior to the transfe r of 1010-1011 
polyclonal melanoma-specific T cells improved the survival of a subset of the transferred T cells 
and therapeutic effica cy 26, 54, 55.  The size of the T cell pool is subject to homeostatic regulation, 
and the induction of lymphopenia results in less competition for cytokines such as IL-15 and IL-7 that promote lymphocyte proliferation and survival, and leads to the proliferation of residual T cells including those that are adoptively transferred . Lymphodepleting chemotherapy may also 
eliminate CD4
+ CD25+ regulatory T cells, and activate antigen  presenting cells that may promote 
the function of transferred T cells. Studies in murine models subsequently confirmed the human data that lymphodepletion improves the persistence and  antit umor efficacy of transferred T
E cells  
56.  
 
3I.  Heterogeneity of T cell products in clinical adoptive transfer studies 
 Clinical trials of genetically modified T cells have typically  utilized peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells derived from the blood as the starting population for transduction. The T cel l 
pool is characterized by marked heterogeneity in the phenotype and function of cells, and this is further altered by age and prior chemotherapy. T cells can be broadly divided into CD45RA
+ 
antigen inexperienced naïve T cells (T N) that express CD62L+ and CCR7+ to enable their transit 
through lymph nodes where they survey for foreign antigens; and CD45RO+ memory T cells that 
have clonally expanded in response to prior antigen encounter, and can be subdivided into CD62L
+ central memory (T CM) and effector memory (T EM) subsets 57.  A subset of memory T 
cells that is intermediate between that naïve and memory cells has  also been described, and 
suggested to represent a “memory stem cell” based on the ability to self -renew, and give rise to 
effector (T E), and T CM and T EM subsets 58. As a consequence of heterogeneity in the distribution 
of T cell subsets in  the blood of different individuals, particularly cancer patients who may have 
had markedly different exposures with prior chemotherapy, the composition of T cell products obtained after gene transfer is often dramatically different, and the consequences of this variability for interpreting, cell persistence, and the toxicity and efficacy  of infused T cell 
products are not known.    
3J.  Rationale for deriving CAR-T cell products from defined T cell subsets  
It is possible to generate genetically modified T cells from a defined starting population 
of T cells that are enriched from PBMC based on the expression of distinct cell surface markers that define their lineage and differentiation. Studies in animal models including immunodeficient mice that were  administered human CD8
+ T cells s howed that cells from defined subsets have 
markedly different capacity to survive and function in vivo 45, 59. For example, effector CD8+ T 
cells derived from purified T CM have been shown to persist long term in vivo, migrate to memory 
cell niches in the bone marrow and lymph nodes, and establish functional populations of T CM and 
TEM [45] . Studies from our group have also d emonstrated that human CD4+ T cells modified with 
a CAR enhance the proliferation of CD8+ CAR -T cells  derived from T CM in response to tumor 
cells (Hudecek M, Riddell SR, unpublished data). These results suggest that preparing CAR T 
cells from purified CD8+ TCM and CD4+ T cells and combining these subsets to achieve a defined 
product composition may provide a more reproducible  safety profile of transferred T cells and 
improve therapeutic efficacy.  
    
 10 3K.   Development of a self -inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector encoding a CD19 -specific 
CAR  
We have constructed a CD19-specific CAR consisting of an scFv derived from the 
murine IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) FMC63. The scFV is fused to the human IgG4 hinge 
region and the human 4-1BB costimulatory domain in tandem with CD3 ζ (Figure 1). The 
construct also encodes a truncated 
epidermal growth factor receptor (tEGFR) downstream of a T2A sequence to provide coordinate expression of tEGFR, which can       serve 
both as a marker for cell selection and 
for tracking transduced T cells in vivo 
60. We have compared the activity of 
different CD19 CARs in vitro and in vivo 
using murine xenograft models, and found that the CD19 CAR containing 4-1BB as a co-stimulatory domain exerts superior antitumor activity compared with a CD19 CAR that contains an IgG4 hinge and CH2-CH3 spacer with CD28 as the costimulatory domain. This data is consistent with uncontrolled results of other groups in which a small number of patients have been treated with CD19 CAR-T cells containing CD28 or 4-1BB costimulatory domains 
7, 8, 50, 51, 
53. Based on the practical and theoretical advantages of lentiviral vectors, a SIN lentiviral vector  
([ZRX-014-LV provided by ZetaRx Biosciences, Inc), Seattle]  that encodes the CD19 -4-1BB-
CD3ζ-tEGFR CAR under transcriptional control of the elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1α ) 
promoter was produced under GMP conditions, and the virus supernatant subjected to quality control analysis for clinical applications.  Exposu re of primary human T cells to CD19-4-1BB-
CD3ζ-tEGFR SIN lentiviral vector results in efficient transduction and expression of the CAR 
and tEGFR, and confers recognition of CD19
+ target cells including primary CLL, and mantle 
cell and large cell lymphoma cell lines.  
 
3L.  Safety considerations for adoptive therapy with genetically modified T cells  
 There are several potential toxicities of adoptive therapy with CD19 CAR -T cells.  The 
first potential toxicity is particular to targeting  cells that express th e CD19 molecule, as re-
directed T cells  will recognize and eliminate non-malignant CD19+ B-cells, potentially resulting 
in a long-term B -cell immunodeficiency  7, 8, 50, 51, 53. Prolonged suppression of normal B cells in 
patients receiving rituximab therapy is common and does not appear to result in significant complications, providing immunoglobul in levels are maintained by IVIG  therapy  
61. Thus, in 
patients with advanced B cell malignancies that have failed conventional chemotherapy  and 
already have a B -cell deficiency from rituximab therapy, B-cell lymphopenia may be an 
acceptable side effect of T cell therapy if it is accompanied by a significant antitumor effect.  
 A second potential toxicity relates to the possibility of transformation of the adoptively 
transferred gene-modified T cells as a consequence of insertional mutagenesis. The development of T cell leukemia has been reported in a subset of patients on two gene therapy trials for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency sy ndrome (SCID), in which bone marrow derived 
CD34 cells were transduced with a retroviral vector encoding the common cytokine receptor gamma chain 
62-66. Currently, five cases of T cell leukemia res ulting from retroviral insertional 
mutagenesis have been described after successful correction of X -linked SCID. Four of the cases 
were associated with activation of the LMO2 oncogene 62-66. Animal studies have shown that  
Figure 1. Schematic design of the CD19 CAR with a  
short (hinge only) extracellular spacer domain.  

 11 mature T cells are resistant to transformation after retroviral integration  67, and leukemia has 
never been observed  in clinical trials involving gene transfer into mature T cells, despite more 
than 10 years of follow-up in some studies. Our study differs from the X-linked SCID trial in 
several important aspects: (a) we will use a lentiviral vector and not a retrovirus to genetically modify cells, which reduces the risk of integrating into a transcriptionally active site; (b) the target of the genetic modification will be a mature T cell and not hematopoietic progenitor cells; and (c) the genetically modified CD19 -specific T cells do not constitutively express a functional 
growth factor receptor as was the case with transduced cells in the X -linked SCID trial.  
 A third potential toxicity is that CD19 CAR -T cells might cause cytokine release after 
engagement of target cells or induce rapid tumor cell death resulting in a tumor lysis syndrome. Both cytokine release and tumor lysis syndromes have been observed in small clinical trials of 
CD19 CAR-T cell therapy in patients with high tumor burdens , but there has not been a clear 
correlation with T cell dose, with tumor burden or with the costimulatory domain in the CAR 
7, 
51. We anticipate that toxicity from cytokine release may be more predictable with T cell 
products of a defined composition. In this trial we will use a dose escalation of CAR-T cells that consist of a 1:1 mix of CD8
+ TCM and CD4+ T cells in cohorts of patients  to determine if a T cell 
dose can be defined that provides acceptable toxicity, long-term persistence, and reproducible depletion of CD19
+ B cells. To minimize the risk of tumor lysis syndrome, we plan to  administer 
standard chemotherapy prior to the T cell infusion to reduce tumor burden and induce lymphopenia to improve T cell persistence.   
3M.  Overview of the Study  
 This is a Phase 1/2, open -label, nonrandomized study t hat will  evaluate the safety and 
potential antitumor activity of adoptively transferring autologous CD19 CAR-T cells transduced with a lentiviral vector to express a CD19 -specific CAR  to patients with advanced CD19
+ B cell 
malignancies. To provide for greater reproducibility of T cell products and to facilitate safety and efficacy evaluation, we will enrich CD8
+ TCM and CD4+ T cells  separately  from the leukapheresis 
product or blood of each patient, transduce and expand each cell subset with the CD19 CAR lentivirus  independently, and pool T cells in a 1:1 ratio to achieve the specified cell dose for each 
cohort of patients. The trial will consist of two stages  – an initial dose escalation/de- escalation 
stage to  define a cell dose that has acceptable toxicity, and then an analysis of the safety of that 
cell dose in expanded cohorts of up to 45 patients each with ALL and NHL and up to 15 patients 
with CLL.   
 
3N.      Modification to extend Stage 1 of the trial :   
 
1. Analysis of disease specific cohorts for determination of optimal dose for ALL, NHL 
and CLL.   
Experience from the initial 16 patients treated on the dose escalation and de-
escalation Stage 1 of the trial revealed differences in toxicity based on disease histology and tumor burden. P atients with ALL and high tumor burden have had toxicity attributed 
to CD19 CAR -T cell therapy that has required dose de-escalation per protocol guidelines. 
Two patients with high tumor burden ALL (≥  15% bone marrow involvement) had dose 
limiting toxicity (one transient CNS toxicity and one patient death from cytokine storm ) 
at dose level 3.  In contrast, none of the 5 (2 at dose level 1 and 3 at dose level 2) patients 
 12 treated with low tumor burden ALL (< 15% bone marrow involvem ent at pre treatment 
evaluation) had dose limiting toxicity. After discussions with the FDA we propose to 
extend the Stage 1 portion of the trial by evaluating ALL patients in separate high tumor burden or low tumor burden cohorts to determine the optimal and safe dosing for the stage 2  portion of the trial for patients with ALL. 
 In contrast to the experience in ALL, none of the 9 patients with NHL/CLL treated at any of the dose levels ( 2 at dos e level 1, 4 at dose level 2 , and 3 at dose level 3)  experienced a 
dose limiting toxicity  regardless of their tumor burden (marrow or nodal disease); 
therefore, we will not  separate NHL/CLL patients into disease burden cohorts, but will 
evaluate NHL and CLL patients in  separate disease-specific stage 1 cohorts.   
 Stage 1 will be extended to further examine dosing in disease specific cohorts outlined in 3N.1.a and the results used to identify a cell dose for Stage 2 evaluation to determine 
safety and efficacy in larger disease/ patient specific cohorts , as described  in 3N.2.a.  
Each of the Stage 1 cohorts will follow  the dose escalation and de- escalation rules based 
on dose limiting toxicities as defined in 14C.1.b .  
 
a. Stage 1 cohorts:   
 
A) ALL -High tumor burden defined as ≥  15% ALL in bone marrow at staging prior 
to treatment.  Treatment will start at Dose level 1 and then escalate or de-escalate in a 3 x 3 design as described in Section 14C.1.b .  This cohort could consist of 3-18 
patients.   
 B) ALL: Low tumor burden  defined as < 15% ALL in bone marrow at staging prior 
to treatment.  Treatment will start at Dose level 2 and then escalate or de-escalate in a 
3 x 3 design as described in Section 14C.1.b .  This cohort could consist of up to 3-12 
patients; however, we have seen no dose- limiting  toxicity in ALL patients with low 
tumor burde n and do not anticipate that enrollment on this cohort will be prolonged  
before proceeding to stage 2.   C) NHL : Patients will be initially treated at Dose level 2 and  then escalate or de-
escalate in a 3 x 3 design as described in Section 14C.1.b .  This cohort could consist 
of up to 3-12 patients; however, we have seen no dose-limiting  toxicity in  the 9  NHL 
patients  previously treated, and do not anticipate that enrollment on this cohort will be 
prolonged before proceeding to stage 2.  D) CLL : We have limited experience with the treatment of patients with CLL. Based 
on the differences observed in ALL and NHL, we propose to formally examine dosing in a cohort of patients with CLL to determine the optimal dose for Stage 2. Treatment will start at Dose l evel 2 and then escalate or de-escalate in a 3 x 3 design 
as described in Section 14C.1.b .  This cohort could consist of up to 3-12 patients; 
however, we have seen no dose-limiting  toxicity in patients with low grade NHL and 
with concurrent DLBCL/SLL and do not anticipate that enrollment on this cohort will be prolonged. 
 13  2. Modification of Stage 2 cohorts:  
  
At the completion of the Stage 1 dose finding in disease specific cohorts, the identified 
dose/s will be used for treatment of patients in the specific Stage 2 cohorts.  Stage 2 for a 
given cohort/disease may begin immediately on identification of the optimal dose from the Stage 1 cohorts.  
a. Stage 2 cohorts:   
 
A) ALL patients with low (< 20% marrow disease) or high ( ≥ 20% marrow disease or 
bulky extramedullar disease) are eligible, n= 45. 
 B) Non Hodgkin Lymphoma.  All histologies expressing CD19 are eligible including Diffuse Large B cell, Follicular, Marginal cell, Mantle cell or other histologies , n=45. 
 C) CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma, n=15  
 
3O.  Modification to Refine D ose in NHL and CLL (following Cy/Flu lymphodepletion) 
 
1.  DL3 was selected for Stage 2 for patients with NHL based on no DLT in 3 patients treated in Stage 1.  However, poor CAR-T cell persistence and expansion were observed in part due to the development of immune responses to the CAR modified T cells.  The use of Cy/Flu for lymphodepletion improved CAR-T cell expansion and persistence and clinical response rate, but was unexpectedly associated with greater toxicity at DL3 in NHL patients.  While protocol sto pping rules (see section 14C2) were not met, there were 
2 treatment related deaths occurring on day 13 and day 23 after treatment.  In discussions with the DSMB and FDA we elected to dose de-escalate to DL1 in patients with NHL and to treat 3 patients with re- escalation to DL2 if  no DLT observed.  Either D L1 or DL2 
will then be used for the remainder of the Stage 2 cohort.  Until a dose level is cleared, these patients will be treated at no less than  2 week interval s.  All patients will count 
toward safety and efficacy as before and there is  no change to  overall study numbers.  
 2.   Five patients with CLL have been treated (4 DL2, 1 DL3) in Stage 1.  However we observed a DLT at dose level 3 in a patient with Cy/Flu conditioning so we  will also 
return to dose escalate patients with CLL from DL1  prior to starting Stage 2 for this 
cohort.    
3P.  Planned Dose Dense Cohort Expansion for NHL: 
DL2 was found to be well tolerated and selected following dose refinement as discussed in section 3O with the use of Cy/Flu lymphodepletion and will be used for the completion of Stage 2 in NHL.  We observed that patients with prolonged T cell persistence and expansion had better clinical responses and outcome suggesting that enhancing the area under the curve with an early second infusion may further improve outcome. We have 
experience with second CAR -T cell infusions following Cy/Flu lymphodepletion to date 
in 4 patients with residual NHL at the same or next higher dose level, as outlined in section 9B.    These infusions were given around or after day 28 with minimal toxicity 
 14 and no severe CRS or neurotoxicity suggesting that earlier treatment with a second 
infusion of CAR-T cells at the same or higher dose may boost levels and clinical activity  
with minimal increased toxicity .  Three of these four patients had evidence of additional 
anti-tumor activity.  Upon completion of Stage 2 for NHL we propose to evaluate an earlier sequential dosing strategy aimed to increase the peak levels and persistence of t he 
CAR -T cells.  Patients will receive a planned  second infusion at DL2 
(2x106 EGFR+ 
cells/kg ) of CAR-T cells between day 10 -21 following the first infusion without  
additional lymphodepletion and after initial toxicity including CRS and neurotoxicity has abated. Up to 20 patients will be treated.  
 
3Q.  Dose Revision for Low- Tumor Burden ALL for the remainder of Stage 2: 
Following treatment of 17 patients with low -tumor burden ALL (<20% bone marrow 
involvement) the protocol is being modified after discussions with the FDA to treat these patients at a lower initial CAR -T cell dose, Dose Level 1 (2 x 10
5/kg).  This was in 
response to the death of a patient due to severe neurotoxicity and CRS.  Following this modification, all  subsequent ALL patients (all tumo r burdens) will receive D ose L evel 
one (2 x 10
5 EGFRt+ cells/kg).   
 
3R. Dose Revision for Low-Tumor Burden ALL for expanded Stage 2: After the 
administration of the lower dose described in section 3Q, 3 of 5 patients (60%) with ≤10% marrow blasts who received Cy/Flu lymphodepletion and DL1 (2 x 10
5 EGFRt+ 
cells/kg) failed to achieve CR. In contrast 6 of 6 patients (100%) with ≤10% marrow blasts who received Cy/Flu lymphodepletion and DL2 (2 x 10
6 EGFRt+ cells/kg) prior to 
the dose reduction in section 3Q achieved CR without excessive toxicity attributed to CAR -T cell infusion. We propose an increase in CAR -T cell dose for patients with ≤5%  
marrow blasts, such that they receive CAR -T cells at DL2 (2 x 10
6 EGFRt+ cells/kg).   
 3S. Cohort expansion for CLL patients with concurrent Ibrutinib: In Stage 2 for patients with 
CLL we observed a high rate of clearance of CLL cells from the blood and  the bone 
marrow, but a slower clearance or failure to clear tumor in bulky LN (ASH CLL reference) .  This often resulted in less than complete remissions.  In our study to date, the 
majority of patients have been previously treated with ibrutinib , but stopped the drug 
prior to T cell collection and were  off of the drug during therapy.  Discontinuation of 
ibrutinib is often associated with significant disease progression  and the rapid 
reoccurrence of bulky lymphadenopathy, while treatment with ibrutinib often rapidly shrinks lymph nodes by mobilizing CLL cells from the LN and spleen into the blood
70.  
In addition, recent data  suggest that the quality of T cells collected from patients who are 
on ibrutinib may be better for the manufactur ing of CAR -T cells and for the function of 
the CAR-T cells when used to treat CLL patients71. Further, ibrutinib may have 
additional activity by reducing the severity of cytokine release syndrome (either by direct action on the T cells or by inhibition of the flar e or inflam mation  that can occur upon 
discontinuation of ibrutinib).  Lastly, multiple ongoing clinical trials support the ability to 
administer ibrutinib safely concurrently with chemotherapy including fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab
72.  All o f these observations support the continuation of 
ibrutinib for CLL patients considering treatment with CD19 specific CAR -T cells  rather 
than stopping it prior to CAR-T cell therapy.   
 15  
We propose a pilot study of 20 CLL patients total who will be treated w ith concurrent 
ibrutinib  throughout T cell collection and then for up to 3 months following CAR-T cell 
infusion.  This group will consist of two cohorts of patients - cohort 1 (n=5-15) : those 
who are continuing on ibrutinib, but with significant residual disease, and  cohort 2 (n=5 -
15): those who have previously failed ibrutinib in the past and who are now on subsequent treatments.  Both cohorts will be treated with ibrutinib  (continue or restart) 
for at least 2 weeks prior to leukapheresis and will continue on ibrutinib for up to 3 months after  the proceeding CAR -T cell infusion.  Ibrutinib dosing will be per the FDA 
label for patients with CLL. Patients who required dose reduction of ibrutinib for toxicity will continue or resume at the reduced dose of ibrutinib that was tolerated.  We will continue with the current Stage 2 CAR -T cell dosing for CLL  at DL2 (2 x 10
6 EFGRt+ 
cells/kg).  We will evaluate toxicity and response rates and compare them to our earlier 
experience.  This data will be used for the development of a multicenter CLL trial.  
 
3T. Special Consideration for Patients Previously Leukapheresed  but NOT Treated.   
Over the conduct of this clinical trial,  several patients with a variety of CD19 positive B 
cell malignancies were eligible for  and underwent leukapheresis and had CAR- T cell 
products manufactured and cryopreserved, but were unable or not eligible to receive  
their CAR T cell treatment during the conduct of the Stage 1 or Stage 2 portions of the 
study.  The major reason for this was that they were unexpectedly found to be in complete remission at the time of planned treatment and had CAR -T cell treatment 
deferred or were having a good response to other therapy. Ten  of these patients are still 
alive and may become eligible for  treatment upon relapse or disease progression.  As part 
of our ongoing commitment to these patients who had cells collected for this study, we propose to include treatment of these patients as additional numbers to the Stage 2 cohorts of each disease if t hey become eligible for therapy during the remaining conduct 
of this trial (m aximum of 12 months) from the treatment of the last patient.

Research Center (FHCRC) for consideration of treatment options for their disease. The protocol will be discussed thoroughly with the patient and other family members if appropriate, and all known and potential risks to the patient will be described. The procedure and alternative forms of therapy will be presented as objectively as possible, and the risks and hazards of the procedure explained to the patient. Consent from the patient will be obtained using forms approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the FHCRC. A summary of the clinic visit detailing what was covered will be dictated for the medical record.  
  7. PROTOCOL REGISTR ATION  
 Eligible subjects will be identified and registered into the system by the Clinical 
Coordinators Office (CCO) (Intake Office) and assigned a UPN (Unique Patient Number). The CCO will register the subject on to the protocol through the Data Management Office.  
 18 Patients are initially screened and undergo an apheresis procedure. Enrollment to the 
therapy portion of the study occurs at the conclusion of the pre T cell work up when data is 
reviewed for all inclusion and exclusion criteria by the Immunotherapy attending physician and the patient signs Consent A.  
 
8. STUDY AGENT  
 
8A. CD19 CAR-T cells  
1. The methods employed to derive CD19 CAR-T cells  from the patient’s CD8+ and 
CD4+ T cells enriched from PBMC, and release tests of the cell products prior to infusion are 
outlined in the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC ) section of the Investigational 
New Drug (IND) application to the FDA . Modifications to the CMC section during the course 
of the study must be submitted for FDA review. 
 2. The autologous T cell product will be prepared and administered to the patient by 
intravenous infusion. Patients will be pretreated with lymphodepleting chemotherapy and receive 
the T cell infusions 36-96 hours after completing chemotherapy (Section 9.B).  
 3. A schematic of the modified treatment plan including expanded stage 1 and 2 cohorts 
is shown in Figure 2. 
      
9. PLAN 
OF 
TREATMENT   
9A. CLL patients will be treated with ibrutinib (continue or restart) for at least 2 weeks prior to leukapheresis and will continue on ibrutinib for up to 3 months after CAR-T cell infusion.  Ibrutinib dosing will be per the FDA label for patients with CLL , except as 
noted above where patients with prior dose reductions for toxicity, will continue or  
CLL with concurrent ibrutinib: (n = 20) 
 

 19 resume the tolerated dose.  Otherwise, patients will receive treatment at 420 mg daily (3 
tablets), unless toxicity requires dose reductions or discontinuation of therapy as outlined 
in section 10.F 
 
9.B. L eukapheresis  or blood-draw to obtain T cells  for CD19 CAR-T cell manufacturing  
1. A leukapheres is will be performed on each patient by the SCCA Apheresis Unit using 
standard operating procedures for obtaining peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Should a technical issue arise during the procedure or in the processing of the product, or insufficient CD19 CAR-T cells be manufactured for the prescribed CD19 
CAR -T cell dose, a second procedure may be performed.  
 Patients ineligible for a vein to vein apheresis may elect to have a percutaneous central venous access  catheter inserted to support this collection.  
 
Patients ineligible for leukapheresis and who have a hematocrit of >38 and a total 
non-malignant (normal) lymphocyte count of >2000 may undergo phlebotomy of 400 ml of blood to obtain PBMCs necessary to establish the T cell cultures.  
 
2. The leukapheresis or phlebotomy product will be delivered to the Cell Processing Facility (CPF) at the FHCRC or the Cell Therapy Laboratory (CTL) at the SCCA. Cell selection may be performed in the FHCRC CPF or SCCA CTL. PBMC not required for cell selections may be archived for research.  If lymphocyte subset counts are considered adequate, the product will be divided into two aliquots. One aliquot will be enriched for CD8
+ TCM cells and the second aliquot 
will be enriched  for CD4+ T cells using clinical grade reagents and SOPs developed at 
the FHCRC/SCCA. Subsequent processing, after selection of CD4+ and CD8+ TCM 
cells and cryopreservation (if required), is performed in the FHCRC CPF. If processing of CD8
+ TCM and CD4+ cells is not considered suitable due to 
lymphopenia, low CD8+ TCM and CD4+ cell counts or other reasons, we may use 
other strategies to select and manufacture CD19 CAR-T cells that are approved for use in this protocol by the FDA. 
 
3. Quality control and release testing will be performed on the CD19 CAR-T cell product prior to its release for patient infusion .  
 
9C. Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy  
1. Prior to the first infusion of CD19 CAR-T cells, the patients will receive 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy that is appropriate for their underlying disease as 
determined by the referring physician in consultation with the protocol Principal Investigator (PI ). The objectives of administering  chemotherapy are to reduce the 
tumor burden prior to infusion of CD19 CAR-T cells and to provide lymphodepletion to facilitate T cell survival.   
 
2. Refer to Appendix A  for suggested chemotherapy regimens based on disease cohort.  
For Stage 2, unless the clinical situation dictates changes, the preferred regimen will be with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide.  
 20 9D.  Clinical and/or Laboratory Exclusion Criteria for T Cell I nfusions 
1. CD19 CAR-T cells should be administered  between 36 and 96 hours after the 
completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy providing the patient does not have 
one or more of the following exclusion criteria: 
• Pulmonary – Patients requiring mechanical ventilation  
• Cardiovascular – Patients requiring pressor support  
• Renal function – Patients with rapidly deteriorating renal failure ; unless due to 
malignancy.  
• Hepatic function – Patients with an elevated total bilirubin of >3.9 or 
transaminases of >  5x the upper limit  of normal values unless due to malignancy  
• Neurologic – Patients with encephalopathy or new focal neurologic deficits  unless 
due to malignancy  
• Uncontrolled, active and serious infection. 
• Treatment with other investigational agent(s) within 30 days of T cell infusion. 
 
2. The criteria listed in Section 9C.1 must be met for each T cell infusion in patients who are eligible to receive more than one T cell infusion.  
 
3. Patients with one or more exclusion criteria in Section 9C.1 above may be eligible to 
receive a T cell infusion with or without chemotherapy at a later time if they 
subsequently resolve the clinical and/or laboratory abnormalities. 
 
9E. Infusions of CD19 CAR-T cells   
 
1. Stage 1: Identification of a cell dose for evaluation in expanded cohorts:  In Stage 1, 
cohorts of three or more patients will receive a single intravenous infusion of CD19 
CAR -T cells at one of three escalating dose levels beginning with dose level 1. Dose 
escalation or de-escalation is determined by the incidence of toxicity in each cohort, as described in Section 14C.1. 
 
Dose level 0:   up to 2x104 EGFR+ cells/kg  
Dose level 1 :  up to 2x105 EGFR+ cells/kg  (Starting dose level)  
Dose level 2 :  up to 2x106 EGFR+ cells/kg  
Dose level 3 :  up to 2x107 EGFR+ cells/kg  
 
The weight used for cell dose determination is the current weight in kg as documented on the 
clinical anthropometry report . 
 
Treatment of patients in the dose -escalation /de-escalation  cohorts will be staggered 
with a minimum of a 14-day interval following infusion between each patient within 
each disease  cohort.  
 
2. Stage 2. Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of a single dose of CD19 CAR-T cells in 
an expanded cohort  stratified by disease histology:   
After the toxicity  data has been obtained from each dose escalation cohort  in Stage 1 , 
we will  examine the laboratory data on T cell persistence, antitumor activity, and B 
cell depletion , and if appropriate, proceed with an expanded cohort of up to 45 patients 
 21 with ALL, 45 patients with NHL and 35 patients with CLL treated at the highest dose 
level established to be safe. See section 3O for dose re-escalation in Stage 2.  The 
objective of Stage 2  is to derive data on safety  of a single dose of CD19 CAR-T cells 
of a defined composition and an estimate of antitumor activity  in patients with 1) ALL  
(both high and low tumor burden treated at the corresponding doses re-defined  in stage 2, 2) NHL , and 3) CLL
 with and without concurrent ibrutinib therapy. 
 
3.   Cell administration.  Individual aliquots of CD4+ and CD8+ CD19 CAR-T cells will be 
prepared for each T cell infusion according to protocols established in the GMP Cell Processing Facility and formulated to provide a single cell product at the specified cell dose. The specified T cell dose refers to CAR
+ T cells determined by the expression of 
the truncated EGFR transduction marker, which is expressed coordinately with the CAR in the vector. Each T cell infusion should be administered intravenously over approximately 20 – 30 minutes at  the specified T cell dose.  
 
4.   Products that cannot be formulated to meet target cell dose specification.   The intent 
for each infusion is to provide a cell product that contains approximately 50% (+/- 15%) of CD19 CAR-modified CD4
+ T cells and CD8+ T cell s (i.e. CAR-modified T 
cells in 1:1 CD4+/CD8+ ratio) . If a T cell product cannot be formulated to meet this  
target cell dose specification because of low transduction efficiency, suboptimal growth of one of the subsets, or failure of either the CD4
+ or CD8+ T cell product to 
meet release criteria, the  cell product should be infused at or as close as possible to  the 
specified phenotype allocation and total T cell dose.  In the Stage 1 dose escalation 
component, such patients will not be considered evaluable for safety analysis in the assigned dose cohort and a replacement subject will be added to the cohort . In Stage 2, 
such patients will be included in analysis of each patient/tumor histologic cohort.  
 
5.   Retreatment of patients on the study . Patients enrolled in either stage of the study may 
be eligible to receive another  CD19 CAR-T cell infusion with or without additional 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy at the same  (for those that received the highest cell 
dose) or up to the next highest dose level if  adequate CD19 CAR-T cells can be 
produced and the following criteria are met : 
i) There is evidence of persistent/relapsed  disease at any time after the previous T cell 
infusion.  ii) There w ere no toxicities attributed to the prior infusion/s  that were dose-limiting or 
required dose de-escalation ( Section 14.C.1).  
iii) The patient is ≥ 21 days from the previous T cell infusion .  
iv) T here are no clinical and/or laboratory exclusion criteria (Section 9C.1). 
6.   Planned Dose Dense Cohort Expansion for NHL.  P atients enrolled in this cohort will 
be accrued following the completion of stage 2 for NHL.  An additional cohort of up to 20 patients will receive a planned second CD19 CAR -T cell infusion without 
additional lymphodepleting chemotherapy at the same dose level if adequate CD19 CAR -T cells can be produced and the following criteria are met:  
a. There were no toxicities attributed to t he first infusion that were dose-limiting 
or required dose de-escalation (Section 14.C.1) 
b. The patient is 10 -21 days from the first CAR-T cell infusion.  
 22 c. There are no clinical and/or laboratory exclusion criteria (Section 9C.1).  
d. Afebrile for greater than 24 hours 
e. Non-hematologic events thought to be probably or definitely RELATED to 
the first CAR-T cell infusion have resolved to less than or equal to  grade 2 
with the exception of related neurotoxicity which must be resolved to less than 
or equal to grade 1.  
 
7.   Patient monitoring during T cell infusions. All patients will be monitored  during each 
T cell infusion  with  vital signs and O 2 saturation being monitored and recorded at the 
following approximate time points: before, 15 mins after starting , at the end of  the 
infusion and approximately hourly for 2 hours after. 
 
 10. MANAGEMENT OF TOXICITIES AND COMPLICATIONS  
Acute infusional toxicity may occur during or shortly after T cell infusion. In addition, cytokine release syndrome, tumor lysis syndrome, and neurologic toxicity have been reported specifically after CD19 CAR-T cells. Management of these complications is addressed in 10A-10 E.  A table 
of proposed grading criteria for cytokine release syndrome is given in Appendix G.  
10A. Management of acute toxicity associated with T cell infusion  
The results of our prior studies of adoptive immunotherapy for CMV, HIV, lymphoma, 
and melanoma suggest that serious acute infusional toxicities resulting simply from infusing the numbers of T cells proposed in this study are unlikely to occur.  However, t ransient 
constitutional symptoms have been observed  with T cell infusions.   
 
Examples of potential symptoms and signs  due to T cell infusions and their initial management 
are listed below:
 
 1.  Fever, chills, and temperature elevations >38.3°C may be manag ed with 
acetaminophen 650 mg p.o. q 4-6 hrs.  All subjects who develop fever or chills should have a blood culture drawn. 
 2.  Headache may be managed with acetaminophen.  
 3.  Nausea, vomiting may be managed with diphenhydramine 25-50 mg IV or other 
antiem etics (excluding corticosteroids) . 
 4.  Hypotension should be managed initially by fluid administration.  
 5.  Hypoxemia should be managed initially with supplemental oxygen.  
 
If the following signs appear during T cell infusion, the infusion should be paused and the patient assessed. If after , assessment by the PI/designee the patient’s condition is stable then the infusion 
may be resumed .   
   Systolic BP < 80 mmHg AND > 30 mm Hg fall from baseline  
Heart rate > 140/min AND increase from baseline > 40/min (confirmed by palpation or EKG) 
   Respiratory rate > 35/min AND increase from baseline of > 10/min   
   Arterial O
2 saturation < 88%  on air AND fall from baseline > 5%  
 
 23 If a T cell infusion is terminated due to acute toxicity, the residual T cells should be returned to 
the Turtle Lab for analysis. Investigation of possible causes of observed signs should proceed and, if necessary, additional medical treatment will be instituted . 
 Patients requiring discontinuation of T cell infusion may be eligible for re- treatment if the cause 
is deemed not related to the T cell infusion.   
10B. Management of cytokine release syndrome 
If patients become febrile or develop symptoms of cytokine release, we may measure 
cytokine levels , serum ferritin, C-reactive protein and markers of tumor lysis syndrome (e.g. 
chemistry, uric acid, LDH) , and evaluate persistence and phenotype of the transgene-expressing 
cells, as clinically indicated . 
 
Any patient who develops clinical evidence of symptoms related to cytokine release will have a 
work-up to exclude infection or other causes. Initial treatment should consist of supportive measures as dictated by the clinical and laboratory findings, and may include fluid replacement,  
medications to support blood pressure, antipyretics, oxygen supplementation, and broad-spectrum antibiotics if infection cannot be excluded as a potential etiology for the signs and symptoms. Patients with G rade > 3 CRS (severe CRS; sCRS) and or Grade 2 CRS with 
progressive symptoms and signs should be treated with tocilizumab (4 -8 mg/kg IV) and 
corticosteroids (dexamethasone 10 mg IV every 12 hours). Higher doses of steroids may be given after discussion with the Principal Investigator or designee and repeated doses of tocilizumab may be given if necessary. See Appendix G for cytokine release syndrome grading and Appendix H for recommended management guidelines .     
 
10C. Management of tumor lysis syndrome 
1. All patients will be considered at risk for tumor lysis and should receive allopurinol 
prophylaxis before chemotherapy begins , unless contraindicated . Allopurinol should be 
continued for as long as the medical team determines appropriate after the T cell infusion. They 
may receive additional hydration and urine alkalinization  for the first 2 weeks after the T cell 
infusion.  
 2. If tumor lysis syndrome develops, as defined by the Cairo Bishop criteria 
68, the 
Attending Physician will direct patient management with guidance from the study staff  69.  
Conservative therapy, including allopurinol, urinary alkalinization, and IV fluid hydration may be instituted immediately for suspected tumor lysis syndrome. Hyperkalemia may be treated with potassium binding resins, diuresis, or insulin/dextrose therapy. Hyperphosphatemia may be treated with phosphate binding resins. In severe cases, rasburicase (in non-G6PD -deficient 
individua ls) or renal dialysis may be necessary.
  
  
10D. Management of neurotoxicity 
1. Neurotoxicity, manifest as delirium, seizures and/or focal neurologic deficits , has been 
reported after CD19 CAR-T cell therapy.  Patients with high tumor burden ALL (> 20% blasts) 
should receive prophylactic treatment with Keppr a 500 mg bid (or similar regimen) starting  at 
least 1 day prior to T cell infusion. Keppra can be discontinued when clinically appropriate. 
Neurotoxicity that is attributed to the T cell infusion/s sh ould be treated with corticosteroids (e.g. 
 24 dexamethasone 10 mg IV q 4-12 hours).  T ocilizumab may also be given , preferably after 
discussion with the Principal Investigator or designee. See Appendix H for recommended 
management guidelines . 
 
10E. Management of other toxicities  
1. If a new onset CTCAE v4.0 grade ≥ 3 toxicity is observed following any T cell 
infusion, the patients will receive investigation and medical treatment appropriate for the physiological abnormalities.  
 2. Grade ≥  3 toxicity that is attributed to the T cell infusion /s, and is unresponsive to 
supportive measures or persists for > 7 days may be treated with corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone 10 mg IV q 4-12 hours) or tocilizumab after discussion with the Principal Investigator or designee. 
 
3. Uncontrolled proliferation of CD19 CAR-T cells has not been observed in clinical 
trials to date. However, in the unlikely event uncontrolled proliferation of CD19 CAR-T cells occurred in a study subject, initial therapy may involve treatment with corticosteroids (e.g. methylprednisolone 1 g IV). Anti-lymphocyte globulin or cytotoxic drugs would also be considered in serious cases.  If we observe an increase in CAR positive cells to greater than 10% 
of T cells at more than 3 months after last infusion we will analyze for clonal expansion by deep sequencing of the TCR beta gene (Adaptive Biotechnology). 
 
10.F. Management of ibrutinib dosing   
 Patients with CLL who are enrolled in the expanded CLL cohort will receive oral 
ibrutinib at 420 mg daily (3 tablets ).  Ongoing dose reductions of 140mg  may be considered as 
needed for patients who are  intolerant of side effects. As ibrutinib can be associated with increased risk of bleeding, it should be held during severe thrombocytopeni a (platelet count 
unable to be sustained > 20,000 by transfusion), and then restarted upon platelet recovery.

If a deficiency of B cells persists at 1 year, we may continue to monitor B cell recovery every 6 months.  
 
4. Immunoglobulin levels 
a. Patients receiving CAR T cells are at risk for chronic B cell depletion and may have IgG deficiencies. Recommendations will be made for mon itoring of IgG 
levels and administering intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as clinically indicated.   
 
5. Evaluation of persistence and phenotype of CD19 CAR-T Cells  
a. Blood samples (approximately 30 ml, heparin/green top tubes) should be obtained 
on approximately days 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 60, 90, 180, and 365 after the T cell infusion for analysis of the persistence of transferred T cells. Additional samples may be collected at other times than those indicated if required for evaluation of persistence of CAR-T cells . Persistence monitoring may be discontinued  beyond 
day 28 in patients who do not have detectable transgene-expressing T cells  on two 
consecutive occasions . Samples should be sent to the Turtle Lab at the FHCRC

the same procedure for research studies . Please discuss the planned procedure with 
the PI.
 
  
 30 9.  Evaluation of tumor response  
a. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.  
i. Because the timing of disease response to CD19 CAR-T cells has been variable in reported studies a bone marrow  aspirate and biopsy should be 
performed if clinically appropriate between 14 days and 3 months after 
each T cell infusion , and should be performed before the patient receives 
additional conventional anti- tumor therapy . Evaluation should include 
pathology analysis, flow cytometry, karyotyping, FISH studies and other molecular studies,  according to disease-specific guidelines .  
ii. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy may also be performed at 
approximately 6 and at approximately 12 months after the first T cell 
infusion, as clinically indicated.  
 
b. Imaging studies i. A CT scan (preferably diagnostic quality) and, if possible, a PET scan of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis  should be obtained between 3 weeks 
and 3 months after each  T cell infusion , and should be performed before 
the patient receives additional conventional anti -tumor therapy. Patients 
with B -ALL do not require CT /PET imaging , unless it is clinically 
indicated.   
ii. PET/CT scanning  may also be performed at 6 and 12 months after the first 
T cell infusion, as clinically indicated.  
iii. CT/PET imaging will be read using Cheson 07 criteria for response assessment .
   
 
c. Serum chemistry panel and LDH should be performed concurrently with restaging by biopsy or imaging, as clinically indicated.  
 
d. Peripheral blood flow cytometry should be performed concurrently with restaging by biopsy or imaging, as clinically indicated.

response.  
 f.    Evaluation of tumor response may be discontinued in patients who proceed to 
other systemic non-CAR -T cell therapies.  
 
 10.  Long Term Follow-Up  (Appendix F ) 
Enrolled patients who receive CD19 CAR-T cells will be asked to participate in long -
term follow-up (LTFU) according to the guidelines set forth by the FDA’s Biologic Response Modifiers Advisory Committee that apply to gene transfer studies. Current recommendations from the FDA suggest a minimum of 15 years of follow-up. In addition, unexpected late medical problems including information on hospitalizations and medications may be collected through the Oncology Clinic at SCCA. 
Recommendations will be made for an autopsy to be co nducted i f the research 
participant dies . 
 
 31 12. PROTOCOL ENROLLMENT 
12A.  Projected Target Accrual  
 
In stage 2, 2 cohorts of 45 patients each with ALL and NHL and 1 cohort of 35 patients with CLL will be enrolled. For the planned multiple dose cohort, 20 additional patients will be treated.

The medical record containing information regarding treatment of the patient will be 
maintained as a confidential document, within the guidelines of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the University of Washington Medical Center, and the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. The investigators will ensure that data collected conform to all established guidelines for coding collection, key entry and verification. Each patient is assigned a unique patient 
number to assure patient confidentiality.  Patients wil l not be referred to by name or by any other 
personal identifier in any publication or external presentation.   The Clinical Statistics 
Departments at FHCRC maintain a patient database to allow storage and retrieval of patient data collected from a wide variety of sources. The licensed medical records departments, affiliated with the institution where the patient receives medical care, maintains all original inpatient and outpatient chart documents. The primary research records are kept in access controlled office 
spaces or password protected computer based applications. Information gathered from this study regarding patient outcomes and adverse events may  be made available to the Federal Drug 
Administration , NIH and Juno Therapeutics. All precautions to maintain confidentiality of 
medical records will be taken.  
 
 32 14.    EVALUATION AND STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
14A.  Type of study 
This is a phase 1/2  study t o assess the safety  and antitumor activity  of adoptive T cell 
therapy with autologous CD4+ T cells and CD8+ TCM cells transduced to express a CD19-
specific CAR  for patients with advanced CD19+ B cell malignancies.  
14B. Definition of endpoints  
1. Safety assessment (relevant data being obtained)  
   a.  General Toxicity Assessment  
• History and physical exam before and at intervals after T cell 
infusions. 
• Pulse oximetry before and during the infusion 
• Chemistry battery before and at intervals after the T cell infusion  
• Toxicity grading according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 
• Serum cytokine levels  
• B cell reconstitution  
• Replication competent lentivirus  
• Adverse event reporting 
 
2.  Efficacy Assessment  
a. Evaluation of the duration of persistence of adoptively transferred CD19 CAR-T cells  
b. Evaluation of the migration of adoptively transferred CD19 CAR-T cells  
c. Evaluation of antitumor activity of adoptively transferred CD19 CAR-T cell s 
by evaluating the objective response rate of complete remission and partial remission, and determining progression free survival, and overall s urvival. 
 
14C.   Endpoint Evaluation  
1.  Safety Assessment  – Stage 1  
In Stage 1 of the study, patients will be treated in cohorts of three or more patients at one of four dose levels of CD19 CAR-T cells starting at dose level 1 ( Section 9D.1) to 
determine a single cell dose to evaluate in an expanded cohort of patients in Stage 2.  
 
  a. Dose limiting toxicities
 
1. Death  within 8 weeks of the study cell infusion thought to be definitely  or 
probably related to CAR T cell therapy. 
 
2. Other dose limiting toxicities will be defined as follows :  
 
  i. Grade ≥  3 non-hematologic toxicity in any major organ system that is 
probably or definitely attributed to T cell infusion AND is unresponsive (does not improve to < grade 3 toxicity) to treatment with dexamethasone 10 mg q 12 hours IV for ≥ 7 days  (or an equivalent corticosteroid dose) or 
tocilizumab 8 mg/kg IV for ≥ 3 dose s OR  of greater than  28 days duration. 
Hematologic toxicity is an expected complication of chemotherapy, and other than B cell depletion, has not been observed in prior trials of CAR T cell therapy, and therefore will not be considered for altering T cell dose. 
 33    
  ii. CTCAE grades 3-5 allergic reactions related to the study cell infusion.   
     iii. CTCAE grades 2 -5 autoimmune reactions, other than expected B cell 
depletion. 
 
3. Patients receiving CD19 CAR -T cells may develop serious toxicity due to T 
cell activation, proliferation and cytokine secretion after encounter with tumor antigen. Cytokine release syndrome, macrophage activation syndrome and neurotoxicity may occur and require intensive care support, and will not 
be considered DLTs unless they meet criteria as outlined in 14.C.1.a.2.i. 
 
b. Dose escalation or de- escalation  
If toxicity defined above (Section 14C.1.a.) develops in 0 of 3 patients at any cohort-specified dose level, as described in 9D.1, the next 3 patients may  receive the next 
higher dose of T cells. If such toxicity develops in 2 of 3 patients at any dose level, the next 3 patients will be treated at one dose level lower. If such toxicity develops in 1 of 3 patien ts, up to an additional 3 patients will be treated at the same dose level. If such 
toxicity occurs in 1 of 6 patients at a given dose level, subsequent patients may be treated at the next higher dose.  
 
If toxicity developed in 2 of 3 patients at the lowes t dose level (dose level 0), the PI 
and DSMB would review the data to determine if evaluation of even lower doses of T cells was appropriate.  
 
The highest dose of T cells that is estimated to result in toxicity in < 1/3 patients  
within each Stage 1 cohort will be the dose selected for Stage 2 evaluation where patients will be stratified into one of 3 cohorts based on the histology of their disease.   
c. Dose de-escalation for the second CAR-T cell infusion for the “Planned Dose Dense 
Cohort Expansion for NHL” Eligible patients will be treated with a second infusion at DL2. Up to twenty patients will be treated in this expanded cohort.  If there ever exists sufficient evidence to suggest that the true toxicity rate after the second infusion exceeds 30%, where 
toxicity is as defined in Section 14C.1.a, consideration will be given to reducing the dose (DL1) and enrollment of patients will continue at this reduced dose.  We would analyze the basis for the toxicity (cytokine production, in vivo cell proliferation, tumor lysis) to  determine if treating additional patients at this lower T cell dose was 
appropriate.  
 
Sufficient evidence for this rule will be defined as any observed outcome whose lower 80% confidence limit exceeds 30%. Operationally, any of the following ratios of toxicities to patients treated would trigger such a rule: 2/2, 3/3 -5, 4/6-8, 5/9-10, 6/11-
13, 7/14-16, 8/17-19, 9/20. If the true probability of toxicity is 0.20, then the probability of this achieving this trigger  after 20  patients is approximately 0.12.  If the 
true toxicity rate is 0.50, then the probability after 20 patients is approximately 0.94.  
 34  
If all patients in this  cohort are treated without this stopping rule being met, then we 
will consider the true toxicity rate associated with this treatment to be consistent with 
an acceptable level (i.e. ≤ 30%) in this cohort and we may proceed to a larger trial that would formally analyze the antitumor effect of CAR -modified T cells as well as 
continue to assess the safety of this approach . 
 Additionally, we will assess the AUC (between day 0-28) of T cell persistence in this cohort, as the goal of the 2
nd infusion is to increase this relative to what we have seen 
before.  The benchmark that we will  use for assessment of this improvement is a mean 
of 715,000 copies/ug  based on results observed in 11 patients treated with Flu/Cy and 
given DL2 CAR-T cells.   All 20 patients treated will be included in this assessment, 
regardless of the dose of the 2nd infusion.  If the true AUC is 0.58 standard-deviation 
units aw ay from the benchmark of 715,000, then 20 patients will provide 80% power 
to detect a statistically significantly increased AUC (at the one-sided significance level of .05).  
 2.  Safety Assessment – Stage 2  
Stopping and Suspension Rules  
1. If during the Stage 2 evaluation there ever exists sufficient evidence to suggest 
that the true toxicity rate exceeds 30%  in any of the cohorts , where toxicity is 
as defined in Section 14C.1.a, enrollment of patients  in that disease cohort  will 
be suspended for safety reasons, pending a detailed review by the PI, study monitor and statistician. We would analyze the basis for the toxicity (cytokine production, in vivo cell proliferation, tumor lysis) to determine if treating additional patients  in that cohort a t a lower T cell dose was appropriate.  
 
Sufficient evidence for this stopping rule will be defined as any observed 
outcome whose lower 80% confidence limit exceeds 30%. Operationally, any of the following ratios of toxicities to patients treated would trigger such a rule: 2/2, 3/3-5, 4/6-8, 5/9-10, 6/11-13, 7/14-16, 8/17-19, 9/20-22, 10/23-25, 11/26-28, 12/29-31, 13/32-34, 14/35-37, 15/38-40, 16/41-43, 17/44-45.. If the true probability of toxicity is 0.20, then the probability of stopping after 25 patients is approximately 0.12.  If the true toxicity rate is 0.50, then the probability of stopping after 25 patients is approximately 0. 94.  
 If all patients in a particular cohort are treated without this stopping rule being met, then we will consider  the true toxicity rate associated with this treatment 
to be consistent with an acceptable level (i.e. ≤ 30%) in this cohort and we may 
proceed to a larger trial that would formally analyze the antitumor effect of CAR -modified T cells as well as continue to assess the safety of this approach . 
 
2.  Study pause for treatment related mortality: If in the combined Stage 1 and 
Stage 2 portions of the study there is evidence of CAR -T cell  related mortality 
whose lower limit of one-sided 90% confidence limit exceeds 10% the study 
 35 will be paused and evaluated by the DSMB and with the FDA.  Operationally, 
any of the following ratios of CAR -T cell  related mortality  to total patients 
treated would trigger such a rule: 18/130, 20/140, 21/150, 22/160, 23/170, 24/180, 25/190 and 27/200.  This will be looked at after every 10
th patient is 
treated .   
 
3. Suspending enrollment for lack of efficacy: If in the Stage 2 component of the 
study, none of the first 10 patients in any disease cohort exhibit an antitumor response, the PI and DSMB would review the data and make a determination whether the cohort should be discontinued or if a modification of dose and or 
treatment regimen considered.    
 
4. The occurrence of a malignancy attributed to lentiviral modified T cells or 
detection of replication competent lentivirus (RCL) in either stage would result in termination of the protocol. 
 
3.  Assessment of e fficacy of transferred T cells  
Data should be collected for persistence, migration and efficacy of transferred T cells and descriptive statistics  will be used to summarize the changes from 
baseline where possible. For those patients with measurable disease at the time T cell therapy commences, res ponses will be evaluated using standard response 
criteria based on CT or PET imaging and histologic analysis of bone marrow or other tissue samples .   
 15.   GUIDELINES FOR REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS AND DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING PLAN. 
 
15A.  General issues and IRB reporting requirements  
1. Definitions associated with reportable events and reporting requirements can be 
found on the FHCRCs Institutional Review Office (IRO) extranet website (Table 1).  2. The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40
) 
will be used for grading and analysis of adverse events. All  grade 3 or greater adverse 
events will be collected  during and for 48 hrs post leukapheresis and again from the day 
of lymphodepletion through day 28 after each T cell infusion . 
 The collection of adverse events will stop at the time of commencement of new systemic anti-tumor therapy. 
 
To ensure that investigative treatment -related conditions are distinguished from disease-
related conditions, attribution of causality will be establ ished in grading adverse events. 
For each event, the Principal Investigator or designee, in conjunction with the physician or research nurse who examined and evaluated the research participant, will assign the attribution.  Data managers who are removed from the clinical assessment of the research participant should not perform this.  Attribution of adverse events attributed to the infused genetically modified T cells should be determined using the following criteria:  
 
 36 Definite - the adverse event is clearly related to the infused T cells  
Probable - the adverse event is likely related to the infused T cells  
Possible - the adverse event may be related to the infused T cells  
Unlikely - the adverse event is doubtfully related to the infused T cells  
Unrelated - the adverse event is clearly not related to the infused T cells  
 
3. The FHCRC IRB will be notified of reportable events by the FHCRC Principal 
Investigator (PI) or study nurse according to current reporting obligations as found on the 
FHCRC Instit utional Review Office extranet website.  
4. The review and reporting of AEs will be in accordance with the Cellular 
Immunotherapy AE reporting for separate FH sponsor and Investigator SOP. 5. Reporting of unanticipated adverse effects to the FDA will be the respo nsibility of 
the sponsor. 6. The FHCRC PI and Research Nurse and study personnel should meet regularly  
(in person or via teleconference) to review all reported events.

15B.  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
1. Definition of Risk Level This phase I/II trial involves genetic modification of somatic cells an d requires an IND. 
At the FHCRC, this type of trial has independent monitoring twice each year thro ugh the 
Clinical Trials Support Office at the FHCRC, and has a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (Section 16B.3).   2. Monitoring and Personnel Responsible for Monitoring 
 37 a) The Principal Investigator (P.I.) is responsible for every aspect of the design, 
conduct and final analysis of the protocol.  Regulations defining the responsibil ities for 
assessment and reporting of adverse events (AE), serious AE and unexpected AE are 
defined by the Code of Federal Regulations:  21 CFR 312.32 and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0 published by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), a division of the NCI/NIH. 
b) This clinical study will rely upon the monitoring of the trial by the P.I. in 
conjunction with a Study Physician(s), Physician Assistant(s) (PA) or Nurse Practitioner(s), Research Nurse(s), Research Coordinator(s), statistician, and an independent Study Monitor assigned by the FHCRC Clinical Research Support Office (CRS).
   
c) Continuous monitoring of the data and safety of this study should be performed 
by the Protocol Management Team (PMT), which consists of the Principal Investigators, Research Nurse, and study staff.  
 d) A Case Report Form (CRF) should be completed for every patient that was 
registered for participation in the study.
 
• Forms should be completed as information becomes available on a visit-by-visit or course -by-course basis.  
• The Principal Investigator or a Co -Investigator will sign and date 
the indicated places of the CRF.  This signature will indicate that thorough inspection of the data therein has been made, and will certify the contents of the form. 
e) The PMT should meet at least monthly to review the clinical status of events 
and follow up information for each patient. The PMT will be responsible for implementation of the stopping rules for safety if necessary . 
 
   3. Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
   The study will be monitored by the Immunotherapy Integrated Research Center 
(IIRC) DSMB.  The DSMB  will be responsible for safeguarding the interests of trial 
participants and assessing the safety and efficacy of the interven tions during the trial.  
This responsibility will be exercised by providing recommendations about stopping or continuing the trial.  To contribute to enhancing the integrity of the trial, the DSMB may also formulate recommendations relating to the selection, recruitment and retention of participants and their management; adherence to protocol-specified regimens; and the procedures for data management and quality control.   The DSMB will be advisory to the study Sponsor and the PI, who will be responsible for prompt review of the DSMB recommendations to guide decisions regarding continuation or termination of the trial and whether amendments to the protocol or changes in study conduct are required.  The external DSMB is an independent, multidisciplinary group consisting of 
clinical experts and a statistician who collectively have experience in leukemia, lymphoma, hematology, biostatistics, and the conduct and monitoring of clinical trials. The DSMB will meet approximately every 6 months to review data. The current 
members are listed in the IIRC DSMB charter.

 42 18. APPENDICES  
 
APPENDIX A - Suggested Cytoreduction/Lymphodepletion Chemotherapy Regimens 
 
The following is a general guide to accepted chemotherapy regimens to be used immediately prior to adoptive T cell therapy.  The selection of appropriate chemotherapy regimen  to provide 
tumor cytoreduc tion and lymphodepl etion is based on the tumor histology and on the types of 
prior treatment that the patient has undergone and should be discussed with the study PI’s.  Chemotherapy regimens that employ prolonged administration of corticosteroids that would continue after the T cell infusion cannot be used for prior to T cell infusion. Patients should be scheduled for T cell infusions starting 36-96 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy.  Patients 
should not receive Alemtuzumab or other T cell depleting antibodies in the 6 months prior to T cell therapy.   
 The preferred regimen for Stage 2 of the trial is the combination of Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide for all diagnoses unless the patients’ clinical situation dictates otherwise.  Suggested regimens include Cyclophosphamide up to 60 mg/kg day 1, followed by fludarabine 25 mg/m
2 daily x 3 days. 
 Alternative regimens would include Cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m
2 day 1-3 and Fludarabine 30 
mg/m2 day 1-3.   
 Depending on the patients ’ clinical situation a number of additional regimes could be used after 
discussion with the study PI.  Possible regimens may include the following as a general guide.  
1) CLL 
a. High dose cyclophosphamide (2-4 grams/m
2) with MESNA  with or without anti-
CD20 antibodies such as rituximab or ofatumumab 
b. OFAR  
c. Bendamustine alone or  with rituximab or ofatumumab 
d. Fludarabine with rituximab or ofatumumab +/ - cyclophosphamide 
2) Indolent NHL and Mantle Cell NHL  
a. One or two cycles of aggressive salvage regimen such as ICE, DHAP, ESHAP alone or in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody.   
b. High dose cyclophosphamide (2-4 grams/m
2) with mesna alone or in combination 
with an anti -CD20 antibody. 
c. High dose etoposide alon e or in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody. 
3) Aggressive NHL  
a.   One or two cycles of aggressive salvage regimen such as ICE, DHAP, ESHAP 
alone or in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody.   
b.   High dose cyclophosphamide (2-4 grams/m2) with mesna  alone or in combination   
with an anti -CD20 antibody. 
c.   High dose etoposide alone or in combination with an anti -CD20 antibody. 
4) ALL  
a. High dose cyclophosphamide (2-4 grams/m2) with MESNA  
b. Any aggressive ALL regimen.  
  
 43 APPENDIX B  - Karnofsky Performance Scale  
 
The Karnofsky Performance Scale Index allows patients to be classified as to their functional impairment. This can be used to compare effectiveness of different therapies and to assess the prognosis in individual patients. The lower the Karnofsky score, the worse the survival for most serious illnesses.

1. History to include hematologic, cytogenetic flow cytometric and histologic findings at diagnosis and time of enrollment as we ll as prior therapies and response to therapy.  
2. If positive, complete antigen quantitation by PCR.  
3. Should be performed concurrently with restaging by biopsy or imaging, as clinically indicated.  
4. Required for any patient with a history of CNS disease or signs and symptoms of CNS or epidural disease , unless a negative lumbar puncture was performed within 30 days prior to 
scheduled T cell infusion.  
5. Bone marrow aspirates/biopsies should be sent for pathology analysis as clinically indicated and according to the protocol. A 5 -10 ml aliquot of the bone marrow aspirate in sodium heparin 
should be sent to the Turtle Lab for research.  
6. Diagnostic CT/PET  scan to include neck chest, abdomen and pelvis, as clinically indicated by disease and status  and according to the protocol. Staging evaluations may be ceased if the 
patient proceeds to other anti-tumor therapy.  
7. PB for flow cytometry in patients with possibility of circulating tumor cells in the blood. 
8. In addition to these times, blood samples should be sent to the Turtle Lab if there is a suspicion of cytokine storm or macrophage activation syndrome. Discuss with PI or designee.  
9. In addition to these times, blood samples should be sent to the Turtle Lab if there is a significant clinical event. Discuss with PI or designee.  
10. PB B cell immunophenotyping studies may be omitted after day 28 in patients who proceed to other systemic therapies, with a recommendation to be made to the treating physician to 
follow IgG levels and replace if necessary.  
11. Blood for archival purposes is optional and may be collected as follows: day 0-21 and 21- 90, blood 60 mL  
12. The volume of all research samples is approximate and may vary based on patient condition and clinical situation.   
13. Samples may be collected if clinically indicated based on PI request.  
14. Preganancy test only needs to be repeated if  than 21 days from  enrollment  
15. Chimerism tesing only for post allogeneic HCT patients  
  
T cell infusion time points represent guidelines for performance of required ev aluations. Due to numerous factors influencing scheduling (pt and provider availability, testing 
services limitations etc), variation in evaluation performance dates is anticipated and acceptable to the protocol (e.g., wit hin +/ - 7 days of time points < day 30; +/ - 90 days  for 
time points > day 30 ).

 50 APPENDIX E – Response criteria for CLL and NHL  
 
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 
 
Complete remission  (CR) :  Normal imaging studies (X-ray, CT, MRI) (nodes, liver, 
and spleen), peripheral blood by flow cytometry has no clonal lymphocytes, bone marrow by flow cytometry has no clonal lymphocytes, bone marrow by morphology has no nodules (or if present, nodules are free from CLL cells by immunohistochemistry), and the duration is at least 2 months.  
 CR with minimal residual  disease  (CR- MRD) :  CR by above criteria except 
peripheral blood or bone marrow by flow cytometry with  >0 - <1 CLL cells/1000  
leukocytes (0.1%)  Partial remission  (PR) :  Absolute lymphocyte count in peripheral blood at least 
50% decreased and physical exa m/Imaging studies (nodes, liver, and/or spleen) at least 
50% decreased.  Duration is  at least 2 months. 
 Progressive disease (PD) :  at least one of: Physical exam/imaging studies (nodes, liver, 
and/or spleen) >50% increase or new, circulating lymphocytes by morphology and/or 
flow cytometry >50%increase, and lymph node biopsy with Richter’s transformation  Stable disease  (SD) :  Did not meet any of the above criteria for complete or partial 
remission or progression.   
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) 
 Complete response  (CR) : Disappearance of all clinically detectable disease.  
 Partial response (PR) : >50% reduction of the sum of the products of the perpendicular 
diameters of marker lesions, no progression of any existing lesions, and no new lesions.  
 Stable disease  (SD) : Stabilization of all existing lesions with no new lesions (i.e. a <25% 
increase or <50% decrease in disease parameters defined above throughout the treatment  
period).  Progressive disease (PD) : >25% increase in the sum of the products of the perpendicular 
diameters of marker lesions, or the appearance of new lesions. 
 
 
Acute lymphoblast  leukemia  (ALL ) 
 Remission status will be determined by restaging of bone marrow and other involved sites by morphology, flow cytometry and molecular studies as appropriate.
  
 51 APPENDIX F - Long Term Follow-Up  
 
Study participants should be asked to participate in long term follow -up, as directed by 
the FDA Guidance for Industry – Gene Therapy Clinical Trials: Observing Subjects for Delayed Adver se Events. 
(
http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformati
on/Guidances/ CellularandGeneTherapy/ucm072957.htm#5 ). 
 Long term follow-up should commence one year after the final T cell infusion. The planned recommendations for follow-up are as follows:   Years 1 - 15: 
 
1. Recommendation that patients undergo at least annual histo ry and physical 
examination with their primary physician:  
• Adverse event screening guidance for the primary physician in the form of a gene therapy LTFU -directed screening survey may  be available.  
• A request for the study team to be notified of all new malignancies and 
unexpected illnesses.  
• The primary physician may  be provided with a blood draw courier kit to enable 
samples to be returned to the Turtle Lab for archival purposes, and for analysis 
for transgene and vector persistence, and RCL, as dictated by studies of transferred T cell persistence.  
 
2. Annuall y participants will complete  the “Immunotherapy Long Term Follow -up 
questionnaire ” to screen for adverse events. 
 
3. Offer the opportunity to return to FHCRC for an annual LTFU clinic visit. 
 
4. Compliance with 21 CFR 312.32 in adverse event reporting. 
 
5. Research studies 
5.i.  30 ml of blood in sodium heparin for evaluation for transgene vector 
sequence by PCR of PBMC every 6 months for years 1 to 5 and every year for years 6-15 until the transgene becomes undetectable.  
5.ii. If > 1% of cells express the transgene or if clonality is suggested, vector 
integration sites or TCRB sequence utilization may be analyzed in PBMC , CAR-T cells or other tissue. If clonality is suggested, repeat 
testing may  be performed 3 months later. Persistent monoclonality, clonal 
expansion or vector integration near a known oncogenic locus should precipitate careful attention to the possibility of malignancy. However, the need for additional intervention should be guided by the clinical circumstances and not solely by the presence of these factors.  
5.iii. 10 ml of blood in sodium heparin for annual testing of PBMC for RCL 
by VSVG QPCR. If there is no evidence of transgene persistence, RCL assays may  be suspended after one year and samples may  be archived.  
 52 APPENDIX G – Grading Criteria for CRS

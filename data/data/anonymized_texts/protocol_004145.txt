Study TV48125-CNS-30050
Title of Study: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double -Blind,Placebo-Controlled, Parallel -Group Study Comparing 
the Efficacy and Safety of 2 Dose Regimens of Subcutaneous A dministration of TEV-48125 Versus Placebo for the 
Preventive Treatment of Episodic Migraine
Sponsor: Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D , Inc.
IND Number: 106,533EudraCT Nu mber:2015-004598-34
Name of Active Ingredient : Humanized anti-calcitonin gene- related peptide ( CGRP) monoclonal antibody
Name of Investigational Product :TEV-48125
Phase of Clinical Development: 3
Number of Investigational Centers Planned: Approximately 140
Countries Planned: Approximately 15
Planned Study Period: 1Q/2016(first patient in) to 3Q/2017 (last patient last visit)
Number of Patients Planned: A total of 768 patients (256 patients per treatment group) are planned to be enrolled
in this study to have 675 completers (225 completers per treatment group ); a12% drop -out rateis anticipated . 
Patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to the follow ing treatment groups:
monthly subcutaneous ( sc)administration of TEV-48125 at 225 mg
sc administration of TEV-48125 at675mg followed by monthly scplacebo
monthly scadministration of placebo
(Note: For this study, monthly dosing refers to dosing approximately every 4weeks[28 days] .)
Study Population: The study population will be composed of female and male patients, aged18to 70years,
inclusive, withahistory of migraine (as defined by International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rdrevision 
[ICHD-3] criteria [ Classification Committee of the IHS,2013])for at least 12 months prior to screening and 
episodic migraine (EM) prospectively document ed viaareview of headache data recorded daily in an electronic 
daily headache diary deviceduring a 28 -day run-in period.
Becauseheadache consortium guidelines recommend preventive the rapies for patients with EM occurring on 4 or 
more days per month due to the frequency of headaches and high degree of disability, patients using no more than 
1preventive medication at the time of study enrollment will be allow ed to remain on the medicati on if the 
medication has at least moderate evidence of efficacy for migraine (Silberstein et al 2012 ). Patients on concomitant 
preventive medications must be on a stable dose for at lea st 2months of consecutive use prior to study entry (ie, 
before the run -in period), wi thout anticipated changesduring the study. A list of preventive medications is presented 
in Appendix A.The total number of patients receiving concomita nt preventive medication during the study will not 
exceed 30% of the total sample size of the study. This subset w ill be randomized independently.

General Design and Methodology: This is a 16-week, multicenter, randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled, 
parallel-groupstudy tocompare the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 2dose regimens of scTEV-48125 and
placebo. 
monthly scadministration of TEV -48125 at 225 mg
sc administration of 675mg of TEV -48125at visit 2followed by monthlyscplacebo 
monthly scadministration of placebo 
Randomization will be performed using electronic interactive response technology (IRT) . Patients will be stratified 
based on gender , country, andbaselinepreventive migraine medication use (yes, no)to ensure balance for the 
covariates (treatment group, preventive medication use, count ry, and gender).
Blinded treatment will be administered sconce monthly ( approximately every 4 weeks) for a total of 3doses. First
treatment administration will occur at visit 2(day 0),and additional doses will be administered at v isits3and 4. 
Final study assessments will be performed atvisit5 (end-of-treatment [EOT]visit), approximately 4weeksafter 
administration of the 3rdand final dose of study drug . Upon completion of the final study assessments, patients may 
enter a long-term safety and efficacy study (Study TV48125 -CNS-30051),consisting of a 12 -month double -blind 
treatment period and a 6.5 -month follow -up period. In the long -term safety extension study, patients receiving active 
study drug in the current study will continue receiving the sam e treatment (ie, monthly sc TEV -48125 at 225 mg or 
quarterly sc TEV -48125 at 675 mg), and patients receiving placebo in the current study will be randomized in a 1:1 
ratio to receive monthly sc TEV -48125 at 225 mg or quarterl y sc TEV -48125 at 675 mg during the long -term safety 
and efficacy study. Patients who do not enroll in the long-term safety and efficacy study for any reason will be 
offered to enter the long -term safety extension for the purpose of evaluating ADA approxim ately 7.5 months
(225days[the approximate equivalent of 5 half -lives])after receiving the last dose of study drug in this study .
Method of Blinding and Randomization: The sponsor, investigators, study staff(except for staff involved in 
bioanalytical analyses) ,and patients will be blinded to treatment assignment. A computer-generated master

14randomization list will be provided to drug packaging facilities. Packaging vendor(s) w ill package active and 
placebo into single- visit kits according to Good Manufac turing Practice procedures. Kits will be identical in 
appearance and contain 1prefilled syringewith active drug or placebo . Adequate kit supply for upcoming study 
visits will be managed by IRTand kept (refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C ) on site.
This is a randomized study with stratification based on gender, country, and baseline preventive medication use (yes, 
no).Each patientwill undergo randomization in a 1:1:1 ratiowithin the stratum to which he or she belongs to 
receive1of the 2TEV-48125 dose regimens or placebo, as assigned by the IRT . The IRT will manage initial drug 
supply, maintenance of adequate study drug supplies on site, and study randomization centrally. At the time of each 
study visit, the I RTwill be queried ,and site personnel will retriev eand administer a 1.5 -mL volume from each
syringe contained in the appropriately numbered kit(s).
The total number of patients receiving concomitant preventive medication during the study will not exceed 30% of 
the total sample size of the study.
Study Dr ug Dose, Mode of Administration, and Administration Rate: Prefilled syringes (active or placebo) w ill 
be contained in uniquely numbered kits and stored (refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C ) on site. Active syringes will contain 
150 mg/mL of TEV -48125, and placebo s yringes will contain the same vehicle and excipients as those for active 
injections. Each kit will contain 1 prefilled syringe.
Study drug will be administered by qualified study personnel as sc injections approximately every 4 weeks ( 28 days)
for a total of 3 doses, as follows:
Patients randomized to receive TEV-48125 at 225 mg will receive 225 mg of TEV -48125 as 1 active 
injection (225 mg/1.5 mL) and tw o 1.5-mL placebo injections at visit 2 and 225 mg of TEV -48125 as 
1active injection (225 mg/1.5 mL) at visits 3 and 4.
Patients randomized to receive TEV -48125 675 mg/placebo w ill receive 675 mg of TEV- 48125 as 
3active injections (225 mg/1.5 mL) at visit 2 and placebo as single 1.5 -mL injection at visits 3 and 4.
Patients randomized to receive placebo w illreceive three 1.5 -mL placebo injections at visit 2 and 
single 1.5 -mL placebo injection at visits 3 and 4.
The recommended sc injection sites follow the National Institutes of Health Patient Education Guidelines of 
June2012, which are available in Appendix Candat http://www.cc.nih.gov/ccc/patient_education/pepubs/subq.pdf. 
The suggested sites of injection are back of upper arms, lower abdomen/belly/waistline, and front of thighs. Each of 
the injections at visit 2 should be given in a different location (eg, not in precisely the same place), and study staff 
member(s) responsible for administration of injections should inspect previous injection sites to ensure that they are 
free of bruising and tenderness and tha t proper rotation of sites is performed.
The total number of sc injections and their locations will be recorded for each dosing visit (visits 2, 3, and 4). A 
1.5-mL volume from each syringe in each visit’s kit (s)must be injected sc for dosing to be consid ered complete.

Allowed and Disallowed Medications Before and During the Study:
Prior Medications and Therapeutic F ailures of Migraine Preventives : Details regarding excluded prior migraine 
preventive treatments and therapeutic failures of migraine preventives are described in the ex clusion criteria.
Concomitant (Current) Therapy: Up to 30% of p atients will be allow ed to remain on stable doses of no more than 
1preventive migraine medication for the duration of the study provided the medication has at least moderate 
evidence of efficacy  as defined by guidelines (Silberstein et al 2012 ) and presented in Appendix A. Patients on 
preventive medication must be on a stable dose for at least 2 months of consecutive use prior to study entry . 
Alternatively , patients must have discontinued the preventive medication at least 5 half -lives prior to screening.
Patients will be allowed to use acute medications to treat acute migraine attacks as needed .
All concomitan t medications taken during the study must be recorded w ith indication, daily dose, and start and stop 
dates of administration. All patients will be questioned about concomitant medication at each clinic visit.
Statistical Considerations:
Sample Size Ration ale:A sample size of 675 randomized (ie, 225 evaluable patients completing the study per 
treatment group) is needed for 90% pow er to show a 1. 6 difference in migraine days (assuming a common standard 
deviation [SD] of 5.2 days) at an alpha level of 0.05. Assuming a 12% discontinuation rate, 25 6patients per 
treatment group will be randomized .
Efficacy Analysis :Forthe purpose of this study, a migraine day is endorsed when at least 1of the following 
situations occur:
a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonst rating at least 2consecutive hours of a headache meeting 
criteria for migraine with or without aura
a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating at least 2consecutive hours of a headache meeting 
criteria for probable migraine, a migraine subtype where on ly 1migraine criterion is missing
a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating a headache of any duration that was treated with 
migraine-specific medications (triptans and ergot compounds)
Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS-30050
20Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint :The primary efficacy endpoi nt,themean change from baseline (28 -day 
run-in period) in the monthly average numberofmigraine days during the 12-weekperiod after the 1stdose of study 
drug, will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance method. The model will include treatment, g ender, country, 
and baseline preventive medication use as fixed effects, and baseline number of migraine days and years since onset 
of migraines as covariates. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals will be constructed for the least squares mean
differences between each TEV -48125 group and the placebo group.
Analysis of Secondary and Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints : The same analysis used for the primary efficacy 
endpoint will be performed for t he continuous secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints. For the proportion of 
responders ,defined as 50% or more reduction from baseline in the monthly average number of migraine days , 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test w ill be used.
Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity : A fixed-sequence (hierarchical) testing procedu re will be implemented to 
control the type 1 error rate at 0.05. The sequence of comparisons will be described in detail in the statistical 
analysis plan .
Safety and Tolerability Analyses: All adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for R egulatory 
Activities. Each patient will be counted only once in each preferred term or system organ class category for the 
analyses of safety. Summaries w ill be presented for all adverse events (overall and by severity), adverse events 
determined by the in vestigator to be related to studydrug (defined as related or w ith missing relationship) (overall 
and by severity), serious adverse events, and adverse events cau sing withdraw al from the study. Patient listings of 
serious adverse events and adverse events leading to withdraw al will be presented.
Local tolerability findings will be listed and summarized descriptively.
Changes in laboratory and vital signs measurement data will be summarized descriptively. All values will be 
compared with prespecified boundaries to identify potentially clinically significant changes or values, and such 
values will be listed.
The use of concomitant medications will be summarized by therapeutic class using descriptive statistics. 
Concomitant medications will include all medicati ons taken while the patient is treated with study drug.
Safety data will be summarized descriptively overall and by treatment group. For continuous variables, descriptive 
statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided for actual va lues and changes from 
baseline to each time point. For categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will be provided. Descriptive 
summaries of serious adverse events, patient withdrawals due to adverse events, and potentially clinically significan t 
abnormal values (clinical laboratory or vital signs) based on predefined criteria w ill also be provided.
If any patient dies during the study, a listing of deaths will be provided ,and all relevant information will be 
discussed in the patient narrative i ncluded in the clinical study report.
Pharmacokinetic Analysis: Pharmacokinetic plasma concentration results (TEV -48125) will be tabulated 
descriptively at each planned sampling time point bytreatment group.
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis : The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship w ill be 
estimated by compartmental techniques. The pharmacokinetic parameters will be based on TEV -48125 
measurements. The pharmacodynamic will be the efficacy responses. 
The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship will be estimated using the most appropriate model after 
comparing different candidate models for their quality of fit. Covariates that may affect the 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship will be tested for inclusion in the model. This ana lysis will be 
reported separately.

331. BACKGROUND I NFORMATION
1.1. Introduction
Migraine is a prevalent condition characterized by attacks of headache and associated s ymptoms 
(such as nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia). The 2 most common forms of migraine, 
migraine without aura and migraine with aura, occur on less than 15 days per month and are 
referred to as episodic forms of migraine (ie, EM) ( Lipton et al 2007 ). However, approximately
3% of individuals with EM evolve, in an y given year, to a significantly more disabling condition 
called CM (Bigal et al 2008 , Lipton et al 2007 ,Scher et al 2003 ). Individuals with CM present 
with headaches of an y severity on 15 or more days per month and have full- blown migraine on at 
least 8 day s per month (Classification Committee of the International Headache Societ y [IHS],
2013).A sizable proportion of individuals with CM experience sdaily headaches and, ther efore, 
facesconsiderable disability  (Bigal and Lipton 2008).
The pathoph ysiology of migraine involves central and peripheral events. Activation of structures 
in the brainstem are involved in the modulation of sensory activity, which is impaired during 
migraine attacks. Chronic dysfunction in these structures predisposes migraineurs not only  to 
migraine attacks, but to increased headache frequency  (Goadsby and Hargreaves 2008 ). 
Furthermore, the activation of these structures is also associated with inflammation and protein 
extravasation at the level of the meningeal blood vessels, muscles and other structures innervated 
by the trigeminal nerve. This combination of peripheral insults (inflammation and plasma protein 
extravasation) with impairment of the inhibitory  pain mechanisms at the level of brainstem is 
paramount to frequent migraines ( Goadsby et al 2002).
Calcitonin gene -related peptide (CGRP) is a well- studied neuropeptide found at the centers of 
the migraine processes, both centrall y and peripherally ( Eftekhari and Edvinsson 2010 ). Its role 
in migraine pathophy siology was suggested more than 20 years ago ( Edvinsson and Goadsby  
1990,Goadsby et al 1990). Jugular levels of CGRP are increased during migraine attacks, and 
intravenous ( iv)CGRP administration induces migraine -like headache in most individuals with 
migraine ( Ashina et al 2000, Hansen et al 2010 ). Calcitonin gene -related peptide is therefore 
involved in the pathophysiol ogy of migraine at all levels, peripherally  (vasodilation, 
inflammation and protein extravasation), at the trigeminal ganglion, and inside the brain ( Ho et al 
2010). Inhibition of CGRP has demonstrated efficacy  in the tre atment of EM ( Hewitt et al 2011 ,
Ho et al 2008 , Olesen et al 2004 ).
The goals of migraine treatment are to relieve pain, restore function, redu ce headache frequency , 
and to prevent progression of EM to CM. Pharmacological interventions for the treatment of 
migraine include acute (symptomatic) treatments and daily  preventive medications. The latter is 
indicated for patients with CM and may  be appropriate patients with EM who have significant 
disability with migraine attacks (>3 days per month with headache -related disability ), 
contraindications to triptans or other vasoactive medications, significant adverse effects from 
triptans, and patients with severe or prolonged attacks ( Lipton and Silberstein 2015 ). Currentl y 
available drug therapies for preventive treatment of migraine include antiepileptic drugs, 
beta-blockers, triptans, antidepressants, angioten sin receptor blockers, angiotensin -converting 
enzyme inhibitors, serotonergic agents, calcium channel blockers, nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory  drugs, opioids, and direct vascular smooth muscle relaxants. Although there 
Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS-30050
34are more than 40 medications within t hese classes of drugs that are used with vary ing response 
rates to prevent migraine, only 5 marketed drugs are approved b y the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) in the United States (US) for the preventive treatment of migraine; 4 of 
them are approved for the prophy laxis of migraine: propranolol, timolol maleate, divalproex 
sodium, and topiramate. The clinical trials (Brandes et al 2004 , Klapper 1997 , Mathew et al 
1995, Nadelmann et al 1986 , Silberstein et al 2004 ) that supported registration of these drugs for 
this indication were conducted before the establish ment of CM as a single entity  and generall y 
included patients with headaches on less than 15 day s per month. Only 1medication, 
onabotulinumtoxinA, is approved for proph ylaxis of CM (Lipton and Silberstein 2015).
TEV-48125 (also known as PF -04427429, RN307, or LBR- 101) is a fully  humanized 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) 2a/kappa monoclonal antibody  derived from a murine precursor. 
TEV-48125 is a potent, selective CGRP binder and blocks both CGRP isoforms (α -and 
β-CGRP) from binding to the CGRP receptor. TEV- 48125 is specific for CGRP and does not 
bind to the closely  related family  members am ylin, calcitonin, or adrenomedullin peptides. Two 
mutations were introduced into the constant region of the TEV -48125 heavy chain to limit 
antibody effector functions. This loss of function prevents TEV- 48125 from stimulating 
antibody-dependent cell mediated cy totoxicity  and triggering complement -mediated ly sis; these 
activities can lead to unwanted consequences such as cell ly sis, opsonization, and cy tokine 
release and inflammation ( Armour et al 1999, Zeller et al 2008 ).
The pharmacokinetics and tolerability  of TEV-48125 (iv doses ranging from 0.2 to 2000 mg and 
subcutaneous [sc] doses of 225 mg and 900 mg) has been well-characterized in the Phase 1 
development program (see Section 1.3.2.1). Furthermore, the safet y and effectiveness of 
TEV-48125 has been demonstrated in a randomized double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 2 
study of 2 sc dosing regimens of TEV -48125 (monthly  TEV-48125 at 900 mg or TEV -48125 at 
675 mg followed b y monthly  TEV-48125 at 225 mg) in patients with CM and a randomized, 
double-blind, placebo -controlled Phase 2 study  of 2 sc dosing regimens of TEV -48125 (monthly  
TEV-48125 at 675 or 225 mg) in patients with EM (see Section 1.3.2.2). The acceptable 
tolerability , long terminal elimination half -life (t½, approximately  45 days) and ability  to 
administer sc make TEV -48125 an attractive therapeutic candidate for the preventive treatment 
of CM and EM.
1.2. Name and Description of Investigational Product
TEV-48125 (formerl y LBR-101, PF-04427429, or RN307) is a full y humanized IgG2a /kappa 
monoclonal antibody  derived from a murine precursor. TEV -48125 is being developed for 
administration by the sc route. A more detailed description of the product is given in Section 3.9.
1.3. Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies
1.3.1. Nonclinical Studies
In vivo pharmacology  studies of TEV -48125 in animal models indicate that TEV -48125 
prevented an increase in blood flow in rat paw skin and the middle meningeal artery  after 
electrical stimulatio n and produced a dose -dependent inhibition of the capsaicin -induced skin 
flare response in cy nomolgus monkey .
Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS-30050
35Safety pharmacology  parameters of TEV- 48125 were assessed in the pivotal toxicology  studies 
in Sprague Dawley  rats and cy nomolgus monkey s and a se parate cardiovascular safet y 
pharmacology  study in male cy nomolgus monkey s. There were no treatment -related changes in 
electrocardiograms (ECGs) and heart rates in the 1 -and 3-month toxicity  studies, and a single iv
dose of TEV -48125 at 100 mg/kg did not result in changes in cardiovascular parameters or bod y 
temperature in monkey s. Additionally , no target organ toxicity  was identified. I n these 
referenced studies, the no -observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) ranged from 100 to 
300mg/kg dos ed either iv or sc. In a 3-month monkey  study, perivascular inflammation of the 
ciliary artery was observed in a few animals at doses ≥100mg/kg. The inflammation was 
suspected to be the result of immune complex formation/deposition from the monkey s’ 
immunogenic response to the drug (TEV -48125). In the pivotal 6-month chronic toxicity  study in 
monkeys following once -weekly sc dosing at dosage levels of up to 300 mg/kg/week, achieving 
high exposure throughout the study , no microscopic findings were noted in any  of the organ s, 
including the ciliaryvessels of the ey es, and the NOAEL of the chronic toxicity  study was 
determined to be the highest dose tested, 300 mg/kg/week. Thus, it is believed that in view of the 
low frequency  (ie, observed in very  few animals) and minimal se verity, the finding (perivascular 
inflammation) that was only  recorded in the 3- month toxicity  study, and had been resolved 
during the recovery  period, is an incidental finding.
The pharmacokinetics of TEV -48125 in animals (rats and monkey s) is typical of a humanized 
IgG2 molecule, with low mean plasma clearance, low volume of distribution at stead y state, and 
a long t ½. Exposure as defined by  the maximum observed plasma drug concentration (C max) and 
the area under the plasma concentration- time curve increa sed linearly  across doses following 
single and repeated once -weekly dosing. No gender differences in exposure were observed in 
rats or monkey s.
Additionally , pivotal reproductive and developmental toxicity  studies in rabbits and rats with 
TEV-48125 were co nductedand completed. Preliminary  data suggest that weekl y dosing with 
TEV-48125 was well tolerated and did not induce any  obvious maternal toxicity  at any dose 
level. No apparent evidence of embry o-fetaltoxicity was noted in an y dose group.
Overall, no toxicological concerns were identified following up to 6 months of dosing to the 
experimental animals.
Further details may be found in the current Investigator’s Brochure .
1.3.2. Clinical Studies
To date, TEV -48125 has been studied in 6 Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers and 
2Phase2b studies in migraine patients. In total, 484 subjects (118 health y volunteers and 
366 migraine patients) received at least 1 dose of TEV- 48125 via iv or sc administration.
A brief summary  of clinical pharmacology  and clinical safe ty and efficacy  studies of TEV -48125 
follows. Further details may be found in the current Investigator’s Brochure.
1.3.2.1. Clinical Pharmacology Studies
A total of 11 8subjects received at least 1 dose of TEV-48125 across 6 completed Phase 1 studies 
atdoses rangi ng from 0.2 through 2000 mg. Studies included 2 single- dose-escalation 
pharmacokinetic and pharma codynamic studies in healthy men (Studies B0141001 and 
Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS-30050
36B0141002); a 2 -cohort, placebo -controlled, cross -over study  to examine the acute effects 
administration of TEV-48125 on capsaicin flare response in healthy  men (Study  B0141006); a 
parallel-group, repeat -dose study  of TEV-48125 in healthy men and women (Study  B0141007); 
a single-dose study  evaluating the safet y, tolerability ,and pharmacokinetics of doses up to 
2000mg administered to healthy  women (Study  LBR-101-008); and a single -dose study  
comparing the safet y, tolerability, absolute bioavailability , and pharmacokinetics if sc and iv 
TEV-48125 in health y men and women (Study LBR-101-011).
Based on noncompar tmental anal ysis, TEV-48125 exposure increases with dose in an 
approximately  dose-proportional manner from 225 to 900 mg following sc administration and 
over the dose range from 100 to 2000 mg following iv infusion. The Cmaxoccurred near the end 
oftheivinfusion (median time to C max[tmax] of 1 to 5 hours after the start of the infusion), and 
Cmaxwas prolonged as indicated b y the delay ed tmax(median t max96 to 108 hours postdose) after 
sc administration. The mean t ½following sc administration was simi lar to that observed after iv 
administration for each dose level. Thet½ranged from approximately  642 to 770 hours 
(approximately  27 to 32 days)at the 225 -mg dose level , and the t ½ranged from approximately  
1140 to 1200 hours (approximately  48 to 50 days)at the 900 -mg dose level. Absolute 
bioavailability  of the sc dose was approximately  55%.
TEV-48125 was well tolerated with favorable safety  profile.The treatment -emergent adverse 
events reported in the Phase 1 studies were predominantly  mild to moderate in severity. A 
specific “pattern of adverse events” that could be associated with a dose or a dose range of 
TEV-48125 has not been identified, nor has a maximally  tolerated dose been identified. The 
most common treatment- emergent adverse events reported w ere headache, nasophary ngitis, 
gastroenteritis, and back pain. There were no deaths. One serious adverse event reported as 
“thoracic aortic aneury sm aggravated ”in an individual receiving a single iv 300 -mg TEV-48125 
dose resolved.
TEV-48125 does not appea r to be associated with any  clinically  relevant patterns of change in 
vital signs (s ystolic and diastolic blood pressure, temperature and heart rate) or cardiac 
conduction and repolarization (P -R interval, QT interval corrected for heart rate using Bazett’ s 
and Fridericia’s formulas) measured b y frequent 12 -lead ECGs. No changes in liver function 
tests (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [AL T], total bilirubin, and 
alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) or differences between TEV-48125 and plac ebo in hematological 
parameters, tests assessing renal function, electroly tes, or urinal ysis has been observed in any of 
the Phase 1 studies.
1.3.2.2. Clinical Safety and Efficacy Studies
The safety, tolerability , and efficacy  of TEV-48125 was evaluated in migraine patients in 
2Phase 2b studies. The first study  was a multicenter, randomized, double- blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel -group study  comparing the efficacy , safety, tolerability , and 
pharmacokinetics of 2 doses of TEV -48125 with placebo in 264 patients w ith CM 
(StudyLBR-101-021). Following a 28- day run-in period, participants were randomized and 
treated sc once monthl y for 3 months. One active group received a 1stdose of 675 mg followed 
by 225 mg on the subsequent 2 months. The other active group receiv ed 900 mg per month. The 
mean change in headache hours relative to baseline for each TEV- 48125 dose arm was 
significantl y different from the placebo arm at 3 months (primary  endpoint), and the study  was 
Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS-30050
37also positive at 2 and 1 months. Both doses were also superior to placebo for the secondary  
endpoint (decrease in the number of day s with moderate or severe headache at 3 months). At the 
doses tested, TEV -48125 was well tolerated, and no serious treatment- related adverse events 
were reported. Most adverse ev ents were mild to moderate. No safet y signals were observed in 
the clinical laboratory  tests, vital signs, phy sical examination, or ECGs.
The second stud y was a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
parallel-group stud y comparing the e fficacy, safety, tolerability , and pharmacokinetics of 2 doses 
of TEV-48125 with placebo in 297 patients with EM (Study  LBR-101-022). Following a 28- day 
run-in period, participants were randomized and treated sc once monthly  for 3months. Two 
active doses were tested, 225 mg given monthly  for 3 months and 675 mg given monthly  for 
3months. The mean change in number of migraine day s at month 3 relative to baseline for both 
TEV-48125 dose arms was significantly  different from placebo at 3 (primary  endpoint), 2, and 
1months. Secondary  and exploratory  endpoints were also positive for the duration of the study . 
Both doses were well tolerated, and no serious treatment- related adverse events were reported. 
Most adverse events were mild to moderate and the lowest d ose had a numericall y lower number 
of adverse events relatively  to placebo. No safet y signals were observed in the clinical laboratory 
tests, vital signs, phy sical examination, or ECGs.
1.4. Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Patients 
1.4.1. Known and Po tential Risks and Benefits of TEV -48125 
Information regarding risks and benefits of TEV- 48125 to human patients may  be found in the 
current Investigator’s Brochure .
1.4.1.1. Risks of TEV-48125
Identified risks (adverse drug reactions) of TEV -48125 include injection site erythema, 
administration site pain, injection site pain, injection site pruritus, injection site dermatitis, 
infusion-related reaction, and drug h ypersensitivity . None of the identified risks are considered 
important risks.
Potential risks for TEV -48125 are perivascular inflammation; development of antidrug 
antibodies (ADAs); liver enzy me elevations; and cardiovascular c onsequences of CGRP 
inhibition, including effects on blood pressure, heart rate, or other cardiovascular parameters.
As described in Section 1.3.2.2, sc TEV-48125 has generall y been well tolerated over the ranges 
of doses evaluated (single doses of 0.02 to 2000 mg in health y volunteers, multiple doses of 
30to 300 mg in health y volunteers, an d multiple doses of 225 to 900 mg in migraine patients). 
The most common treatment -emergent adverse events were mild to moderate transient general 
administration site disorders/reactions. Other commonly  reported treatment- emergent adverse 
events were heada che, back pain, and upper respiratory  tract infection.
1.4.1.2. Benefits of TEV -48125
As described in Section 1.3.2.2, results from Phase 2 clinical studies have demonstrated 
statistically  significant reductions in mean h eadache hours after 1, 2, and 3 months of 
TEV-48125 treatment in patients with CM and statistically  significant reductions in monthly

38migraine days after 1, 2, and 3 months of TEV -48125 treatment in patients with EM. Results for 
several secondary /explorato ry endpoints also showed TEV -48125 to be superior to placebo.
1.4.2. Overall Risk and Benefit Assessment for This Study
Based on the current safety  profile and the demonstrated efficacy  ofthe sc TEV -48125 dosage 
form, the overall risk and benefit assessment for this study  is favorable.
1.5. Selection of Drugs and Dosages
A detailed description of study  drug administration is presented in Section 5.1.
1.5.1. Justification for Dosage of Active Drug
The TEV-48125 doses and dosing regi mens to be evaluated in this double -blind study  were 
selected on the basis of animal pharmacod ynamic and pharmacokinetic data, 
6pharmacokinetic/safet y studies in healthy  volunteers, 2 safety/efficacy study in patients with 
migraine, and population pharmac okinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacody namic modeling and 
simulations.
The pharmacod ynamics of TEV -48125 were examined in animal models by  characterization of 
the ability  of TEV-48125toblock CGRP functions in vivo (see Section1.3.1). Specificall y,
neurogenic vasodilation by  capsaicin application on the skin was used to induce a 
CGRP-mediated increase in vasodilatation or skin blood flow in cy nomolgus monkey s. In this 
study,TEV-48125 (dosed as a single iv bolus at 1, 10, or 100 mg/kg) produced a dose -dependent 
inhibition of the capsaicin -induced skin flare response. The magnitude and duration of the 
inhibition produced by  TEV-48125 were dose -dependent, with the 10 and 100 mg/kg doses 
showing inhibition out to 56 days postdose. Based on body  surface area conversion, these doses 
are equivalent to single doses of approximately  225and 2000 mg, respectively , in patients with 
migraine. Therefore, the 225- mgdose was considered to be a reasonable and pragmatic choice 
for the lowest dose with potential for effectiveness .
Based on data from the pharmacokinetic and pharmacody namic studies in animal models and the 
pharmacokinetics, safet y, and tolerability  of TEV-48125 from Phase 1 studies in healthy  
volunteers, 2 dose regi mens were selected for sc administration in the Phase 2b study in patients 
with EMfor a treatment period of 3 months. The 2 active arms were 225 and 675 mg 
administered monthly . The results of the Phase 2b study  demonstrated that both dose regimens 
are effective, safe, and well tolerated b y EM patients .The mean change in number of migraine 
days relative to baseline for both TEV -48125 dose arms were significantl y different from the 
placebo arm at 3 months (primary  endpoint), and the study  was also striking ly positive at 
2months and 1 month. Although a maximum tolerated dose was not reached in the Phase 2b 
study, and doses up to 2000 mg were observed to be safe in health y volunteers, it is considered 
best practice to select the lowest effective dose known for administration. Therefore, the lowest 
dose from the Phase 2b study , 225 mg TEV- 48125 administered monthly , was preserved for the 
Phase 3 study  in patients with EM. A 2ndactive treatment group will receive TEV -48125 at 
675mg quarterly to examine the po tential for loss of efficacy  within a 3- month treatment period 
following a single sc administration. I n a simulation ,a low dose of 225 mg once in 3 months was 
evaluated and found to be with limited effic acy. Thus,the next supported higher dose of 675 mg 
was selected for this regimen.

391.5.2. Justification for Use of Placebo
A placebo -controlled design is appropriate given the purpose and objectives of this clinical 
study. Inclusion of a placebo control group is consistent with Classification Committee of the 
IHSguidelines for controlled trials of drugs in migraine, 3rdedition (Tfelt-Hansen et al 2012 ).
1.6. Compliance Statement
This study  will be conducted in full accordance with the I nternational Conference on 
Harmonisati on (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Consolidated Guideline (E6) and any 
applicable national and local laws and regulations (eg, Title21 Code of Federal Regulations 
[21CFR] Parts 11, 50, 54, 56, 312, and 314, European Union [EU] Directive 2001/20/EC on t he 
approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States 
relating to the implementation of GCP in the conduct of clinical studies on medicinal products 
for human use). Any episode of noncompliance will be documented.
Theinvestigator is responsible for performing the study  in accordance with this protocol and the 
applicable GCP guidelines referenced above for collecting, recording, and reporting the data 
accurately and properl y. Agreement of the investigator to conduct an d administer this study  in 
accordance with the protocol will be documented in separate stud y agreements with the sponsor 
and other forms as required by  national authorities in the country  where each investigational 
center is located.
The investigator is re sponsible for ensuring the privacy , health, and welfare of the patients during 
and after the study  and must ensure that trained personnel are immediately  available in the event 
of a medical emergency . The investigator and the applicable study  staff must be familiar with the 
background to, and requirements of, the stud y and with the properties of the study drug(s) as 
described in the Investigator’s Brochure or prescribing information.
The principal investigator at each investigational centerhas the overall responsibility  for the 
conduct and administration of the study  at that center and for contacts with study  management, 
with the I ndependent Ethics Committee (I EC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB), and with local 
authorities.
1.7. Population to be Studied and Justification
The study  population will be composed of f emale and male patients , aged18 to 70years,
inclusive, with a history of migraine (as defined by  International Classification of Headache 
Disorders, 3rdrevision [ICHD -3] criteria [ Classification Committee of the IHS,2013])for at least 
12 months prior to screening and EM prospectively  documented viaareview of headache data 
recorded dail y during a 28- day run-in period in an electronic headache diary device.
Because headach e consortium guidelines recommend preventive therapies for patients with EM 
occurring on 4 or more day s per month due to the frequency  of headaches and high degree of 
disability,patients using no more than 1 preventive medication at the time of study  enrollment 
will be allowed to remain on the medication if the medication has at least moderate evidence of 
efficacy for migraine ( Silberstein et al 2012 ). Patients must be on a stable dose and regimen of 
the preventi ve medication for at least 2 months prior to study  entry (ie, before the run -in period), 
and they cannot change the dose and regimen during the study . The total number of patients 
Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS-30050
40receiving concomitant preventive medication during the stud y will not exceed 30% of the total 
sample size of the study .
Episodic migraine is a highly prevalent condition and a significant cause of disability , especially  
in patients with high frequency  EM. Furthermore, 3% to 6% of patients with EM evolve in any  
given year to CM, which is significantl y more disabling ( Scher et al 2003 ). Risk factors for 
evolution from EM to CM include high headache frequency  and the use of specific classes of 
acute medication, including barbiturates and opiates ( Bigal et al 2008 ).
Aside from limiting migraine -associated disability, it is expected that effective preventive 
migraine medications should decrease the likelihood that a patient with EM will evolve to CM. 
However, ava ilable preventive medications have variable response rates and are associated 
adverse effects. In addition, only 4 are approved for preventive treatment of EM ( Lipton and 
Silberstein 2015 , Shamiliyan et al 2013 ).
1.8. Location and Timing of Study 
This study  is planned to be conducted in approximately  15 countries , including North and South 
America, the European Union, and Asia Pacific, at approximately  140centers. It is expected to 
start in in 1Q 2016 and hav e a duration of approximately  21months. Additional centers will be 
added, if needed. Expected duration of the stud y may also be extended dependent on enrollment 
speed and other factors.

483. STUDY D ESIGN
3.1. General De sign and Study Schema
This is a 16- week, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group 
study to compare the safety , tolerabilit y, and efficacy of 2 dose regimens of sc TEV-48125 and 
placebo in adults with EM. The study  consists of a screening visit, a 28 -day run-in period, and a 
12-week (84-day) treatment period, including a final evaluation at week 12 (end-of- treatment 
[EOT] visit, approximately  4 weeks [28 day s] after the final dose of study  drug).
The study  population will be composed of female and male patients, aged 18 to 70 y ears, 
inclusive, with a history  of migraine (as defined by  ICHD-3 criteria [ Classification Committee of 
theIHS,2013])for at least 12 months prior to screening and EM prospe ctively documented via a 
review of headache data recorded dail y during a 28- day run-in period in an electronic headache 
diary device.
Patients using no more than 1 preventive medication at the time of study  enrollment will be 
allowed to remain on the medic ation if the medication has at least moderate evidence of efficacy  
for migraine ( Silberstein et al 2012 ). Patients shouldnot beusing concomitant preventive 
migraine medication s(presented in Appendix B)at the time of the screening visit, and will not 
be allowed to initiate these medications after study start. A small subgroup of patients 
(approximately  30%) will be allowed to use concomitant migraine preventive medica tions 
(presented in Appendix A), andno changes in these medications will be allowed until the last
study assessments are complete . Patients will be allowed to use acute medications to treat acute 
migraine attack sas needed .
After completing the informed consent process (screening visit [visit 1]), patients will be 
screened for eligibility . Eligible patients will enter a 28- day run-in period. Headache information 
will be captured daily  throughout study  participati on using the electronic headache diary device. 
After completing the run -in period, patients will be asked to return to the study  center on day  0 
(visit2). Patients who have confirmed EM with headache of an y type on 6 to 14 day s and 
migraine on at least 4 days and meet all other eligibility  criteria (including electronic headache 
diary compliance criteria during the 28 -day run-in period)will be r andomly assigned in a 
1:1:1ratio to 1 of 3treatment groups:
monthly sc administration of TEV -48125 at 225 mg
sc administration of 675 mg of TEV -48125at visit 2followed by  monthly sc placebo
monthly sc administration of placebo
(Note: For this stud y, monthly dosing refers to dosing approximately every4 weeks[28 days].)
Randomization will be performed using elec tronic interactive response technology  (IRT). 
Patients will be stratified based on gender, country, and baseline preventive m igraine medication 
use (yes,no) to ensure balance for the covariates (treatment gr oup, preventive migraine
medication use, country, and gender). The total number of patients receiving concomitant 
preventive medication during the stud y will not exceed 30% of the total sample size of the study .

49Blinded treatment will be administered sc once monthly  (ie, approximately  every 4 weeks) fora 
total of 3 doses. First treatment administration will occur at visit 2 (day  0), and additional doses 
will be administered at visits 3 and4. Final study  assessments will be performed at visit 5 (EOT 
visit), approximately  4 weeksafter administration of the 3rdand final dose of study  drug.
Headache information will be captured daily  during the entire study  using an electronic headache 
diary device. Assessments of migraine -related disability  and change in quality  of life (using the 
MIDASquestionnaire , PHQ-2/PHQ-9, MSQOL questionnaire ,EQ-5D-5Lquestionnaire, and 
PGICscale, and WPAI questionnaire ); safety evaluations; blood draws for pharmacokinetic, 
immunogenicit y, and biomarker anal ysis; and urine sampling for biomarker anal ysiswill be 
performed throug hout the study  according to the schedule of assessments ( Table1).In addition, 
patients who consent to pharmacogenomic assessment will provide a blood sample for testing.
Upon completion of the final study  assessme nts patients who complete all scheduled visits may 
be eligible to enter a long-term safety  and efficacy  study (Study TV48125- CNS-30051), 
consisting of a 12 -month double -blind treatment period and a 6.5 -month follow -up period. 
Patients receiving active stud y drug in the current study will continue receiving the same 
treatment (ie, monthly  sc TEV-48125 at 225 mg or quarterl y sc TEV-48125 at 675 mg), and 
patients receiving placebo in the current stud y will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
monthly sc TEV-48125 at 225 mg or quarterl y sc TEV- 48125 at 675 mg during the long -term 
safety and efficacy stud y. This long -term safet y and efficacy stud y is beyond the scope of this 
protocol. A separate protocol will be issued. Patients who withdraw from the study  before 
completing the 12 -week evaluation period will have EOT visit (visit 5) procedures and 
assessments performed on the last day  they receive the study  drug or as soon as possible 
thereafter. Those patients who do not enter the long-term safety  and efficacy study for any reason 
will be offered to enter the long term safet y extension for the purpose of evaluating ADA 
approximately  7.5months (225days [theapproximate equivalent of 5 half- lives]) after 
administration of the last (3rd)dose of study  drugin this study.
The assessments and procedures performed during each stud y visit are detailed in Table1and 
Section3.14. The study  schema is presented in Figure 1.
The end of the stud y is defined as the date the last patient attends the EOT/earl y withdrawal visit 
(visit5).
A total of 7 68patients are planned to be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio (256 patients pertreatment 
group) to receive 3 monthly  sc doses of TEV-48125 at 225mg, 1 monthly  sc dose of TEV -48125 
at 675mg followed b y 2 monthlysc doses of matching placebo, or 3 monthly  scdoses of 
matching placebo.

Note: Baseline refers to the 28 -day run-in period for headache variables and visit 2 (day 0) for all other variables.
3.2. Justification for Study Design
A randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group design is appropriate g iven the 
objectives of this study . Furthermore, this design is consistent with the recommendations of the 
Classification Committee of the IHSfor controlled trials of pr eventivedrugs in migraine ( Tfelt-
Hansen et al 2012).
The dose planned for administration at visit 2 (1stdose) for patients randomized to receive 
TEV-48125 at 675 mg followed by  monthly sc placebo requires administration of 3 × 1.5- mL 
injections. In order to blind the treatment arms based on both dose-volume and number of 
injections, each patient will receive three 1.5-mL sc injections at visit 2: three 1.5- mL sc 
injections of active drug, one 1.5 -mLsc injection of active drug and two 1.5 -mL injections of 
placebo, or three 1.5 -mL injections of pl acebo. Each patient will receive a single 1.5- mL sc 
injection of active drug (225 mg) or placebo at visits 3 and 4 according to their randomized 
treatment.

513.3. Primary and Secondary Efficacy Measures and Time Points
A description of the efficacy  measures is pr ovided in Section 6.
3.3.1. Primary Efficacy Measure and Time Point s
The primary  efficacy endpoint for this study will be derived from headache data (ie,occurrence 
of headache, duration of headache, maximum severity  ofheadache, and acute migraine -specific 
medication use ) collected daily  using an electronic headache diary  device. 
Eligible patients will receive training onthe use of the electronic headache diary  device and will 
be informed of compliance requirements at screening. Patients will complete electronic headache 
diary entries with questions about the previous day beginning on day -27(the day after the 
screening visit) through the EOT/early  withdrawal visit. The electronic headache diary  device 
will allow entr y of headache information for up to 48 hours after a given day.
3.3.2. Secondary Efficacy Measure and Time Points
The secondary efficacy endpoints will be derived from headache data (ie, occurrence of 
headache, duration of headache, maximum severity  of headache, and acute migraine -specific 
medication use ) collected daily  using an electronic headache diary  device. In addition, 
migraine-related disability  will be assessed using the MIDAS questionnaire, completed at time 
points specified in Table1.

Time Points
A description of the pharmacokinetic, biomarker, and immunogenicit y measures is provided in 
Section8.
3.5.1. Pharmacokinetic Measures and Time Points
Blood samples for pharmacokinetic s analysisof TEV-48125 will be collected from all patients at 
time points specified in Table1for thepurpose of pharmacokinetic/pharmacody namic 
relationship assessment. The pharmacod ynamic parameters will be the efficacy  responses.
The actual date and time of each blood sample , as well as the date and time of the last study  drug 
dose prior to the sample, will be recorded in the case report form (CRF).
TEV-48125 plasma concentration will be measured using a validated assay .
3.5.2. Immunogenicity Measures and Time Points
Blood samples for immunogenicity  analysis will be collected at time points specified in Table1.

Table1, and a blood sample will be collected from patients who consent to pharmacogenomic 
analysisat visit 2or any  visit thereafter.
3.6. Exploratory/Other Efficacy Measures and Time Points
The following exploratory  efficacy measures will be assessed at time points specified in Table 1:
exploratory  efficacy endpoints derived from headache data (ie, occurrence of 
headache, duration of headache, maximum severity  of headache, and acute 
migraine-specific medication use ), which arecollected dail y using an elec tronic 
headache diary  device
PHQ-2/PHQ-9 (Note: Patients will first respond to the PHQ -2. They will respond to 
questions 3 through 9 [unique questions] of the PHQ- 9 only if the PHQ -2 is positive.)
MSQOL questionnaire
EQ-5D-5Lquestionnaire
PGIC scalecompleted
WPAI questionnaire
3.7. Randomization and Blinding
The sponsor, investigators, study  staff (except for staff involved in bioanaly tical analyses), and 
patients will be blinded to treatment assignment. A computer -generated master randomization 
list will be p rovided to drug packaging facilities. Packaging vendor(s) will package active drug
and placebo into single -visit kits according to Good Manufacturing Practice procedures. Kits will 
be identical in appearance and contain 1prefilled sy ringewith active drug or placebo. Adequate 
Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS-30050
53kit supply  for upcoming study  visits will be managed b y IRTand kept (refrigerated at 2°C to 
8°C) on site.
This is a randomized study  with stratification based on gender, country , and baseline pre ventive 
medication use (y es, no). E achpatient will undergo randomization in a 1:1:1 ratio within the 
stratum to which he or she belongs to receive 1 of the 2TEV-48125 dose regimens or placebo, as 
assigned b y the IRT. The I RT will manage initial drug suppl y, maintenance of adequate stud y 
drugsupplies on site, and study  randomization centrally. At the time of each study  visit, the I RT 
will be queried, and site personnel will retrieve and administer a 1.5 -mL volume from each 
syringe contained in the appropriatel y numbered kit(s).
3.8. Maintenance of Randomization and Blinding
3.8.1. Randomization
Patient randomization codes will be maintained in a secure location within Teva Global 
Biometrics or in a secure location with the vendor contracted to create the list. At the time of 
analysis, when treatment codes are needed, the Teva statistician assigned to the study  will make 
a request to unblind and will receive the unblinded codes.
3.8.2. Blinding/Unblinding
Pharmacokinetic data may be assessed during the study . Personnel responsible for bioanal ysis 
will be provided with the randomization code in order to facilitate the analysis. However, the 
personnel responsible for bioanaly sis will not have access to clinical safet y and efficacy  data and 
will provide concentration data to other personnel in a manner that will not i dentify individual 
patients (ie, a dumm y patient identifier will be linked to an individual patient’s concentration 
data).
For information about personnel who may  be aware of treatment assignments, see Section 3.7. 
These individuals will not be involved in conduct of any  study procedures or assessment of any  
adverse events.
In case of a serious adverse event or pregnancy , or in cases when knowledge of the study  drug 
assignment is needed to make treatment decisions , the investigator may  unblind the patient’s 
drug assignment as deemed necessary , mainly in emergency situations. Individual treatment 
codes, indicating the treatment randomization for each randomized patient, will be available to 
the investigator(s) and/o r pharmacist(s) at the study  center via the IRT, both via telephone and 
internet. If possible, the sponsor should be notified of the event prior to breaking of the code. If 
this is not possible, the sponsor should be notified immediately  afterwards, and the patient’s drug 
code assignment should not be revealed. Breaking of the treatment code can always be 
performed b y the site without prior approval b y the sponsor.
When a blind is broken, the patient will be withdrawn from the stud y, and the event will be 
recorded onto the CRF. The circumstances leading to the breaking of the code should be fully  
documented in the investigator’s study files and in the patient’s source documentation. 
Treatment assignment should not be recorded in any  study documents or source document.
In blinded studies, for adverse events that are defined as: s uspectedunexpected serious adverse 
reaction(SUSAR) (ie, reasonable possibility ; see Section 7.1.4), Global Patient Safety  and 
Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS-30050
54Pharmacovigi lance may  independentl y request that the treatment code be revealed (on a 
case-by-case basis) to comply  with regulatory  requirements. The report will be provided in an 
unblinded manner for regulatory submission. If this occurs, blinding will be maintained for the 
investigator and for other personnel involved in the conduct, anal ysis, and reporting of the data .
3.8.3. Data Monitoring Committee
This is not applicable .
3.9. Drugs Used in the Study
A description of administration procedures is given in Section 5.1.Additional details may also be 
found in the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure for TEV -48125.
3.9.1. Investigational Product
TEV-48125 will be provided as a sterile, unpreserved, colorless to slightl y yellow, aqueo us 
solution for injection, supplied in a 2.25 -mL prefilled sy ringe for single -use administration, 
containing 150 mg/mL in 16±2.5 mM L -histidine, 0.2 -mg/mL pol ysorbate80, 84-mg/mL 
sucrose, and 0.136 -mg/mL eth ylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).
TEV-48125 w ill be administered sc at a dose of 225 mgat visit 2 ( for patients randomized to 
bothTEV-48125 dosing regimen s), and TEV -48125 will be administered sc at a dose of 225 mg 
at visits 3 and 4 ( for patients randomized to the monthly  TEV-48125 at 225 mg dosing regimen). 
Each dose will be separated by  approximately  28 days. A more detailed description of 
administration procedures is given in Section 5.1.
3.9.2. Placebo
Placebo will be provided as a sterile solution of 16±2.5mM L-histidine, 0.2 -mg/mL 
polysorbate80, 84-mg/mL sucrose ,and 0.136 -mg/mL EDTA, presented as 2.25 mL per syringe.
Placebo will be administered sc at visits 2, 3, and 4 ( for patients randomized to the placebo 
treatment group) or visits 3 and 4 ( for patients randomized to the TEV -48125 
675mg/placebo/placebo dosing regimen ). A more detailed description of administration 
procedures is given in Section 5.1.
3.10. Drug Supply and Accountability
3.10.1. Drug Storage and Security
The study drug (TEV -48125 and placebo) must be stored refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 
46°F), protected from light; the site should have a process for monitoring the drug storage 
temperature. TEV -48125 and placebo supplies must be kept in a secure area ( eg, locked 
refrigerator). 
3.10.2. Drug Accountability
Each stud y drug shipment will include a packing slip listing the contents of the shipment, drug 
return instructions, and any  applicable forms.
Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS-30050
55Each investigator is responsible for ensuring that deliveries of s tudy drug and other study  
materials from Teva are correctly  received, recorded, handled, stored, accounted for, and used in 
accordance with this protocol. I n addition, each investigator is responsible for ensuring that study  
drug and other materials from T eva are correctl y, safely, and properl y disposed of in accordance 
with local regulations.
A record of stud y drug accountability (ie, study drug and other materials received, used, retained, 
returned, or destro yed) must be prepared and signed by  the princip al investigator or designee, 
with an account given for any discrepancies.
3.11. Duration of Patient Participation and Justification
This study  will consist of a screening visit, a 28-day run-in period,and a 12-week (84-day) 
double-blind treatment period. Patien ts are expected to participate in this study  for approximately  
16 weeks. Patients completing this study  may enroll in the double-blind, long -term safety  and 
efficacystudy (StudyTV48125-CNS-30051). Those patients who do not enter the long-term 
safety and efficacystudy for any reason will be offered to enter the long -term safet y extension 
for the purpose of evaluating ADA approximately 7.5 months (225days) after administration of 
the last (3rd) dose of study  drugin this study . Thus, patient participation for these patients will 
last approximately  10.5months.
See Section 12.4for the definition of the end of the study .
The durations of the run -in and double- blind treatment periods align with Classification 
Committee of the IHS guidelines for controlled trials for the preventive treatment of migraine 
(Tfelt-Hansen et al 2012 ).
Patients who do not enroll in the long -term safet y and efficacy  study for any reason but who 
enter the long -term safety  extension for the purpose of evaluating ADA will return 
approximately  7.5 months (225 day s, the approximate equivalent of 5 half- lives) after the last 
dose of study  drug. This is consistent with the 2009 FDA Guidance for Industry  on Assay  
Development for Immunogenicity  Testing of Therapeutic Proteins; a complete washout of the 
drugfrom the circulating blood is expected after approximately  7.5months (≥5 half-lives), 
allowing a more precise evaluation of ADA.
3.12. Stopping Rules and Dis continuation Criteria
There are no formal rules for early  termination of this study . During the conduct of the study , 
serious adverse events will be reviewed (see Section7.1.5) as they are reported from the 
investigational center to identify  safety concerns. The study  may be termina ted by the sponsor at 
any time.
A patient may  discontinue participation in the study at an y time for an y reason (eg, lack of 
efficacy, consent withdrawn, and adverse event). The invest igator and/or sponsor can withdraw a 
patient from the study  at any time for any  reason (eg, protocol violation or deviation as defined 
in Section11.1.2, noncompliance, or adverse event). In addition, patients wi th abnormal hepatic 
laboratory  values (eg, ALT, AST, ALP, gamma -glutamyl transpeptidase [GGT], total bilirubin, 
or international normalized ratio [I NR]) may  meet criteria for discontinuation from the study  
drug as summarized in AppendixE.
Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS-30050
563.13. Source Data Recorded on the Case Report Form
All patient data must have supportive original source documentation in the medical records, or 
equivalent, before they are transcribed onto the CRF . Data may  not be recorded directl y onto the 
CRF and considered as source data unless the sponsor provides written instructions specify ing 
which data are permitted to be recorded directly  onto the CRF .
Sourcedata, including test results and/or assessments (eg, clinical laboratory , central E CG 
evaluation center, and electronic headache diary  data) collected by  other institutions outside of 
the study center, are sent to the investigational center where they  are retained ,but not entered 
into the CRF unless otherwise noted in the protocol. Thes e data may  also be sent electronically  
to the sponsor (or organization performing data management) for direct entry  into the clinical 
database (see Section 13.1). All data from other institutions will be available to the investigator .
The CRFs are filed in the sponsor’s central file.
3.14. Study Procedures
Study procedures and assessments with their timing are summarized in Table1. Detailed b y-visit 
information is provided in th e sections following the table. Detailed descriptions of each 
assessment are provided in Section 6(efficacy assessments) , Section 6.2(safety assessments) , 
and Section 8(pharmacokinetic and other assessments).

603.14.1. Procedures f or Screening (Visit 1[Day –28])
A signed and dated informed consent form will be obtained before screening procedures 
commence (see Section 12.1). Evaluations obtained as part of routine medical care and 
performed during the screening period may  be used in place of the protocol -specific evaluations. 
In addition, disease -specific assessments performed within a specified time frame before 
informed consent may  be used for the study . Patients will acknowledge and agree to the possible 
use of this information for the study  by giving informed consent.
After informed consent is obtained, patients who are screened will be assigned an 8 -digit 
identification number such that all patients from each country  are given consecuti ve 
identification numbers in successive order of inclusion. The first 2 digits of the screening number 
will be the number assigned to the country  where the investigational center is located, the next 
3digits will be the investigational center number , and the last 3 digits will be the patient number 
assigned at the investigator center (eg, the 3rdpatient screened in the US[country 01] at 
center101 would be assigned the number of 01101003 ).The screening number is the permanent 
number assigned to the pati ent for the duration of study .
After confirmation of study  eligibility , patients will be screen failed or randomized into 
StudyTV48125- CNS-30049 (ie, patients with CM) or the current study  (ie, patients with EM).
For randomized patients, an enrollment num ber will be assigned consisting of the8- digit 
screening number and the last 2 digits of the assigned protocol (ie, 49 for St udy TV48125- CNS-
30049 or 50 for the current study ; in the example above, the enrollment number would be 
01101003 -50 for this study ).
A patient who is screened and does not meet study  entry criteria will not be considered for 
screening again .
The screening visit (visit 1) will take place approximately  28 daysbefore the baseline visit . The 
following procedures will be performed at visit 1:
Obtain written informed consent before an y other study -related procedures are 
performed.
Record demographic characteristic including race.
Review inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Review medical and ps ychiatric history .
Review medication history .
Perform vital signs measurements (includes s ystolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
pulse, body  temperature, and respiratory  rate).
Perform triplicate 12 -lead ECGs.
Perform a physical examination , including h eight and weight .Body mass index will 
be calculated from the screening height and weight.
Perform clinical laboratory  tests (serumchemistry, hematology , coagulation, and 
urinalysis).

has any other condition, which, in the opinion of the investigator, makes the 
patient inappropriate for inclusion in the study
t.The patient is a study  center or sponsor employ ee who is directly  involved in the 
study or the relative of such an emplo yee
4.3. Justification for Key Inclusion and Exclusion C riteria
The inclusion and exclusion criteria select for patients who meet ICHD-3revisioncriteria for 
EM(Classification Committee of the IH S,2013).Because headache consortium guidelines 
recommend preventive therapies for patients with EMoccurring on 4 or more day s per month 
due to the frequency  of headaches and the high degree of disabilit y,Inclusion Criterion eallows 
for the use of 1 concomitant preventive medication for migrain e.
4.4. Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (in accordance with the applicable country ’s 
acceptance), each patient is free to withdraw from the study  at any time. Theinvestigator also 
has the right to withdraw a pa tient from the study in the event of intercurrent illness, adverse 
events, pregnancy  (see Section7.2), or other reasons concerning the health or well- being of the 
patient, or in the event of lack of cooperation .In addition, a patient may  be withdrawn from the 
studyas described in Section s3.8,3.12, 3.14.4, 5.4, and 7.1.7.
Should a patient decide to withdraw after administration of study  drug, or should the investigator 
decide to withdraw the patient, all efforts will be made to complete and report all observations up 
to the time of withdrawal . A complete final evaluation at the time of the patient’s withdrawal 
should be made and an explanation given as to why the patient is withdrawing or being 
withdrawn from the study .
The reason for and date of withdrawal from study  drug treatment and the re ason for and date of 
withdrawal from the study  must be recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto 
the CRF. If a patient withdraws consent, every attempt will be made to determine the reason . If
the reason for withdrawal is an adverse event or a potentially  clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory  test result, monitoring will be continued at the discretion of the investigator (eg, until 
the event has resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a health care 
professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the stud y drug or study procedure is 
made). The specific event or test result must be recorded on the source documentation and 
transcribed onto the CRF .
All protocol- specified procedures/assessments should be performed at the EOT/early withdrawal 
visit (see Table 1). Patients who withdraw from the study  will be offered to enter the long -term 
Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine

70safety extension for the purpose of evaluating ADA approximately  7.5 months (225 days[the 
approximate equivalent of 5 half -lives])after their last dose of study  drug in this study .A patient 
should only  be designated as lost to follow up if the site is unable to establish contac t with the 
patient after 3 documented attempts via 2 different methods (phone, text, e -mail, certified letter, 
etc).

715. TREATMENT OF PATIENTS
5.1. Drugs Administered During the Study
Following the baseline assessments, eligible patients will be randomly  assigned w ith 
stratification based on gender, country , and baseline use of preventive migraine med ication 
(yes,no) to receive monthly  TEV-48125 at 225 mg, TEV-48125 at 675 mg followed by  monthly 
placebo, or monthl y placebo.
Study drug will be administered by  qualified study personnel as sc injection sapproximately  
every 28 days for a total of 3 doses ,as follows:
Patients randomized to receive monthly  TEV-48125 at 225 mg will receive 225 mg of 
TEV-48125 as 1 active injection (225 mg/1.5 mL) and two 1.5- mL placebo in jections 
at visit 2 and 225 mg of TEV- 48125 as 1 active injection (225 mg/1.5 mL) at visits 3 
and 4. 
Patients randomized to receive TEV -48125 at 675mg/placebo/placebo will receive 
675mg of TEV -48125 as 3 active injections (225 mg/1.5 mL) at visit 2 and placebo 
as a single1.5-mL injection at visits 3 and 4.
Patients randomized to receive placebo will receive three 1.5 -mL placebo injections 
at visit 2 and a single 1.5 -mL placebo injection at visits 3 and 4.
The 4-week (28 -day)period will be determined relative to the planned dosing day  provided the 
patient returns to the study  center within the tolerance window (±3 days). If the patient returns to 
the study center more than 3days late, then the 4- weekperiod will be determined from the actual 
dosing day  rather than the planned dosing day .
Individual, uniquel y numbered visit kits containing 1 prefilled s yringewithastaked 
27 G½”needlewill be provided.
At the time of each stud y visit, the IRTwill be queried, and site personnel will retrieve and 
administer 1.5 mL  from each syringe contained in the appropriately  numbered kit (s).
Recommended sc injection sites follow the National I nstitutes ofHealthPatient Education 
Guidelines of June 2012, which are available in Appendix Cof this document and in this 
website: http://www.cc.nih.gov/ccc/patient_education/pepubs/subq.pdf .The suggested sites of 
injection are back of upper arms, lower abdomen/belly/waistline, and front of thighs. Each of the 
injections at visit 2 should be given in a different location (eg, not in precisely the same place), 
and study  staff member(s) responsible for administration of injections should inspect previous 
injection sites to ensure that they are free of bruising and tenderness and that proper rotation of 
sites is performed.
Study drug should be removed from the refrigerator and allowed to equilibrate at room 
temperature for 15 to 30 minutes before stud y drug administration.
A 1.5-mL volume from each s yringe in each visit’s kit (s)must beinjected sc for dosing to be 
considered complete. The total number of sc injections and their locations will be recorded for 
each dosing visit (visits 2, 3, and 4).

In addition, male patients may  not donate sperm for the duration of the study  and for 7.5 months 
after discontinuation of study  drug.
5.3. Prior and Concomitant Therapy or Medication
Any prior or concomitant therap y, medication, or procedure that a patient has had within 6 
months before stud y drug administration and up to the end of the stud y period will be recorded 
on the CRF. Generic or trade name, indication, and dosage will be recorded. In addition, 
migraine p reventive medication that a patient took within 2 years before study drug 
administration will be recorded on the CRF. The sponsor will encode all therap y and medication 
according to the World Health Organization drug dictionary .
5.3.1. Prior Medications and Thera peutic Failures of Migraine Preventives :
Details regarding excluded prior medications, including migraine preventive treatments ,and 
therapeutic failures of migraine preventives are described in the exclusion criteria (Section4.2).
5.3.2. Concomitant Therap iesand Medications
Up to 30% of patients will be allowed to remain on stable doses of no more than 1 preventive 
migraine medication for the duration of the stud y provided the medication has at least moderate 
evidence of efficacy  as defined b y guidelines ( Silberstein et al 2012 ) and presented in 
Appendix A.Patients on preventive medication must be on a stable dose for at least 2 mont hs of 
consecutive use prior to study  entry. Alternativel y, patients must have discontinued the 
preventive medication at least 5 half-lives prior to screening. Preventive migraine medications 
disallowed for at least 70% of patients for the duration of the s tudy are presented in Appendix B.
Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine

All concomitant medications taken during the study, including over -the-counter medic ations, 
vitamins, or herbal or nutritional supplements, must be recorded with indication, daily  dose, and 
start and stop dates of administration. All patients will be questioned about concomitant 
medication use at each visit.
5.4. Procedures for Monitoring Pati ent Compliance
The investigator will be responsible for monitoring patient compliance. If the investigator or the 
sponsor determines that the patient is not in compliance with the study  protocol, the investigator 
and the sponsor should determine whether th e patient should be withdrawn. The IEC/I RB should 
be notified.

746. ASSESSMENT OF  EFFICAC Y
6.1. Primary Efficacy Measure and Justification
The primary  efficacy endpoint (and secondary  and exploratory  efficacy endpoints as well) will 
be derived from headache variables collecte d daily using an electronic headache diary  device. 
Eligible patients will receive comprehensive training from site personnel onthe use of the 
electronic headache diary device. Site personnel will also instruct patients on the requirement for 
timely and daily completion of the electronic diary .
On each day , the patient will be asked to record diary  data for the previous 24- hour period. 
Patients may  be asked about their performance at work, at school, and when doing household 
chores (ie, functional assessmen ts). Patients who report headache on the previous day  will 
answer questions about the headache (ie, the number of hours with headache, presence of 
associated s ymptoms, and use of acute migraine medications). Additional details regarding the 
questions patie nts will answer can be found in the electronic headache diary training manual.
If a patient fails to complete the diary  for the preceding day , the patient will be prompted to enter 
the missed day ’s information the next time he/she accesses the electronic d iary provided no more 
than 48hours have elapsed since completion of that day . If more than 48 hours have elapsed 
since completion of a diary  day, the patient will not be allowed to enter diary  information for that 
day, and it will be considered a missed d ay.
Rating of headache severity  and duration of headache for each day  will be completed in the 
electronic diary . Overall headache duration will be recorded numericall y, in hours, as well as 
number of hours with headache of at least moderate severity.
If headache is reported, then h eadache severit y will be subjectively rated by the patient as 
follows:
mild headache
moderate headache
severe headache
Patients will also record whether photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting are present, 
and they will record any migraine medications (name of drug, number of tablets/capsules, and 
the dose in milligrams per tablet/capsule) taken on each day .
6.2. Migraine Disability Assessment
The MIDAS questionnaire is a 5-item instrument developed to assess headache- related disability
based on lost day s of activity  in 3 domains (work, household work, and nonwork) over the 
previous 3 months. The total of the scores of the first 5 questions is used for grading of disab ility, 
with scores of 0 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 20, and ≥21 interpreted as disability  grades 1 (little or no 
disability), 2 (mild disability ), 3 (moderate disability ), and 4(severe disability ), respectivel y. It 
has been shown to be reliable and valid for mig raine, with substantially  higher scores in migraine 
cases than non -migraine cases ( Stewart et al 1999a ,Stewart et al 1999 b).

75Patients will complete the MIDAS questionnaire at baseline (visit 2) and the EOT visit (visit 5).
6.3. Two-Item Patient Health Questionnaire/9 -Item Patient Health 
Questionnaire
The PHQ is a 9-item questionnaire with each item corresponding to 1 criterion of the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual for Mental Diso rders 4thedition diagnostic criteria for major depressive 
disorder. Each of the items is scored on a scale of 0 (“not at all”) , 1 (“several day s”), 2 (“more 
than half the day s”), and 3 (“nearly every day”) based on the frequency  of symptoms during the 
past 2 weeks ( Spitzer et al 1999 ). The PHQ -2 was developed from the PHQ- 9 to rapidly screen 
for depression and consists of the first 2 questions from the PHQ-9 . The PHQ -2 and the PHQ -9 
are validated measures for detecti ng and monitoring depression, anxiety , and somatization 
(Kroenke et al 2010 ).
Patients will complete the PHQ -2 at baseline (visit 2) and the EOT visit (vis it 5). If the PHQ -2 is 
positive (ie, a score of ≥3),patientswill complete questions 3 through 9 ( unique questions )ofthe 
PHQ-9.
6.4. Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire
The MSQOL , version 2.1 is a 14-item questionnaire that assesses the impact of migraine and 
migraine treatment on a patient’s quality  of life during the previous 4 weeks, which has been 
shown to be a reliable and valid tool for use in CM and EM ( Bagley et al 2012
). The MSQOL 
measures the degree to which performance of normal activities is limited by  migraine (Role 
Function-Restrictive domain comprising 7 items), the degree to which performance of normal 
activities is prevented b y migraine (Role Function-P reventive domain comprising 4items), and 
the emotional effects of migraine (Emotional Function domaincomprising 3 items). Scores range 
from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health- related quality  of life.
Patients will complete the MSQOL  at baseline (visit 2), visits 3 and 4, and the EOT visit 
(visit5).
6.5. EuroQol-5 Dimension Questionnaire
The EQ-5D-5Lis a standardized questionnaire that assesses overall state of health. The 
EQ-5D-5Lconsistsof 2 parts. In Part 1, patients rate their health state in 5 domains: mobility , 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood, using a scale of 1 to 5where 1=no 
problems, 2= slightproblems, 3= moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme 
problems. In Part 2, patients rate their health state on a 100 mm visual analog scale; a rating of 0 
represents the worst imaginable health state, and a r ating of 100 represents the best imaginable 
health state.
Patients will complete the EQ-5D- 5Lat baseline (visit 2) and the EOT visit (visit 5) .
6.6. Patient Global Impression of Change Scale
The PGIC scale is a validated generic tool for assessment of overall change in the severit y of 
illness following treatment. Patients will rate how they  describe the change (if any ) that their 
migraine/headaches have had in their general quality  of life and health status since beginning the 
treatment in this study on a 7-point scale where 1= no change (or condition has got worse) ;
Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 StudyTV48125- CNS-30050
762=almost the same, hardly an y change at all ; 3=a little better, but no noticeable change;
4=somewhat better, but the change has not made any  real difference ;5=moderatel y better, and a 
slight but not iceable change ;6=better, and a definite improvement that has made a real and 
worthwhile difference ;and 7=a great deal better, and a considerable improvement that has made 
all the difference .
Patients will complete the PGI Cscalebefore study  drug adminis tration at visits 3 and 4 and at 
the EOT visit (visit 5).
6.7. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire
The generic version of the WPAI  questionnaire measures the overall effect of health on 
productivity  at work and daily  activities. The specifichealth problems version of the WPAI  
questionnaire allows investigators to attribute productivity  and activity  impairment issues to 
specific health conditions. After the employment status of a respondent is identified, 
3open-ended questions are asked conc erning (1) hours absent from work due to health problems 
(or specific condition), (2) hours absent from work due to other reasons, and (3) hours actually  
worked. Two additional questions are included that ask about the impact of health on 
productivity , 1 concerning productivity  at work and the other concerning daily  activities outside 
of work. The response format of each item of the WPAI  questionnaire consists of an 11- point 
scale ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 10 (complete impairment) ( Reilly et al 1993). 
Patients will complete the WPAI  questionnaire at baseline (visit 2) and at the EOT visit (visit 5).

777. ASSESSMENT OF  SAFETY
In this stud y, safety will be assessed b y qualified study  personnel by  evaluating the followin g: 
reported adverse events ,clinical laboratory  test results, vital signs measurements, 12-lead ECG 
findings, ph ysical examination findings (including bod y weight measurements), eC-SSRS scores,
local injection site assessments, and concomitant medication u sage.
7.1. Adverse Events
7.1.1. Definition of an Adverse Event
An adverse event is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient a dministered a pharmaceutical 
product, regardless of whether it has a causal relationship with this treatment.
In this stud y, any adverse e vent occurring after the clinical study  patient has signed the informed 
consent form should be recorded and reported as an adverse event.
An adverse event can, therefore, be an y unfavorable and unintended ph ysical sign, s ymptom, or 
laboratory  parameter tha t develops or worsens in severit y during the course of thisstudyora
significant worsening of the disease under study  or of any  concurrent disease, whether or not 
considered related to the study  drug. A new condition or the worsening of a pre -existing 
condition will be considered an adverse event . Stable chronic conditions (such as arthritis) that 
are present before stud y entry and do not worsen during this studywill not be considered adverse 
events.
Accordingl y, an adverse event can include an y of the following:
intercurrent illnesses
physical injuries
events possibly  related to concomitant medication
significant worsening (change in nature, severit y, or frequency) of the disease under 
study or other pre- existing conditions (Note: A condition recorded as pre-existing that 
is intermittently  symptomatic [eg, headache] and that occurs during thisstudyshould 
be recorded as an adverse event.)
drug interactions
events occurring during diagnostic procedures of this study or during anyfollow-up 
periodof thisstudy
laboratory  or diagnostic test abnormalities that result in the withdrawal of the patient 
from the study , are associated with clinical signs and sy mptoms or a serious adverse 
event, require medical treatment or further diagnostic work- up, or are consi dered by 
the investigator to be clinically significant(Note: Abnormal laboratory  test results at 
the screening visit that preclude a patient from entering the study  or receiving study  
drugare not considered adverse events.)
all events of possible drug- induced liver injury  with hyperbilirubinemia (defined as 
AST or ALT ≥3 times the ULN, plus either total bilirubin ≥2 times the ULN or INR
Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 StudyTV48125- CNS-30050
78>1.5) or Hy ’s Law events require immediate study treatment cessation and reporting 
as a serious adverse event. Refer to Appendix Efor guidance regarding monitoring 
patients with elevated liver function tests.
Migraine exacerbations, including acute headache, requiring headache medications will be 
collected as part of the efficacy assessment in this study . Migraine exacerbations (including acute 
headache) should be recorded as an adverse event only if the presentation and/or outcome is 
more severe than would ty pically be expected from the normal course of the disease in a 
particular patient or if they  are severe enough to require hospitalization of the patient, in which 
case they are recorded as serious adverse events.
7.1.2. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events
For adverse event recording, the stud y period is defined for each patient as the time period from 
signature of the informed consent form through completion of visit 5orthe early withdrawal 
visit for patients who withdra w from the study  for any reason. Adverse events will be collected 
at each visit via adverse event inquiry .
All adverse events that occur during the defined study  period must be recorded on the source 
documentation and transcribed onto the CRF, regardless of the severit y of the event or judged 
relationship to the study  drug. Forserious adverse events, the serious adverse event form must be 
completed , and the serious adverse event must be reported immediatel y (see Section7.1.5.3.1).
The investigator does not need to activel y monitor patient s for adverse events once the stu dy has 
ended. Serious adverse events occurring after the defined study  period should be reported to the 
sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them, following the procedures describ ed in 
Section7.1.5.3.1.
At each contact with the patient, the investigator or designee must question the patient about 
adverse events b y asking an open- ended question such as, “Have y ou had any  unusual sy mptoms 
or medical problems since the last visit? If yes, please describe.” A ll reported or observed signs 
and symptoms will be recorded individually , except when considered manifestations of a 
medical condition or disease state. A precise diagnosis will be recorded whenever possible. 
When such a diagnosis is made, all related sign s, symptoms, and any  test findings will be 
recorded collectively  as a single diagnosis on the CRF and, if it is a serious adverse event, also 
on the serious adverse event form .
The clinical course of each adverse event will be monitored at suitable interva ls until it resolves, 
stabilizes, or returns to baseline; until the patient is referred for continued care to a another health 
care professional; or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the stud y drug or study  
procedure is made.
The onset and end dates, duration (in case of adverse event duration of less than 24 hours), action 
taken regarding study  drug, treatment administered, and outcome for each adverse event must be 
recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF.
The relation ship of each adverse event to study  drug and study  procedures, and the severity  and 
seriousness of each adverse event, as judged by the investigator, must be recorded, as described 
below.
Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 StudyTV48125- CNS-30050
797.1.3. Severity of an Adverse Event
The severit y of each adverse event must be recorded as 1 of the choices on the following scale:
Mild: No limitation of usual activities
Moderate: Some limitation of usual activities
Severe: Inability to carry out usual activities
7.1.4. Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Study Drug
The relatio nship of an adverse event to the study drug is characterized as follows:
Term Definition Clarification
No reasonable 
possibility
(not related)This category applies to adverse 
events that, after careful 
consideration, are clearly due to 
extraneous causes (disease, 
environment, etc) or to adverse 
eventsthat, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are 
evaluated, are judged to be unrelated 
to the study drug.The relationship of an adverse event may be considered 
“no reasonable possibility” if it is clearly due to 
extraneous causes or if at least 2 of the following apply:
It does not follow  a reasonable temporal sequence 
from the administration of the study drug .
It could readily have been produced by the patient’s 
clinical state, environmental, or toxic factors or other 
modes of therapy administered to the patient.
It does not follow  a known pattern of response to the 
study drug . 
It does not reappear or w orsen when the study drug is 
re-administered. 
Reasonable 
possibility
(related)This category applies to adverse 
events for which, after careful 
medical consideration at the time 
they are evaluated, a connection with 
the study drug administration cannot 
be ruled out w ith certainty .The relationship of an adverse event may be considered 
“reasonable possibility” if at least 2 of the following 
apply:
It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study drug.
It cannot be reasonably explained by the known 
characteristics of the patient’s clinical state, 
environmental, or toxicfactors or other modes of 
therapy administered to the patient.
It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in 
dose. There are important exceptions when an 
adverse event does not disappear upon 
discontinuation of the study drug, yet a drug 
relationship clearly exists.
It follows a known pattern of response to the study 
drug.

Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 StudyTV48125- CNS-30050
807.1.5. Serious Adverse Events
7.1.5.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring at an y dose that results in any  of the 
following outcomes or actions:
death
a life-threatening adverse event (ie, the patient wasat immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurs); does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death
inpatient hospitalization or prolo ngation of existing hospitalization, which means that 
hospital inpatient admission and/or prolongation of hospital stay  wererequired for 
treatment of an adverse event, or that they  occurredas a consequence of the event. 
Hospitalizations scheduled prior to study  entry will not be considered serious adverse 
events, unless there wasworsening of the pre -existing condition during the patient’s 
participation in this study
persistent or significant disability  or incapacity  (refers to a substantial disruption of
one’s ability  to conduct normal life functions)
a congenital anomaly /birth defect
an important medical event that may  not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient and may  require medical intervention
to prevent oneof the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency  or drug abuse. Note: Any  suspected transmission of 
an infectious agent via a medicinal product is considered an important medical event .
An adverse event that does not meet an y of the criteria for seriousness listed above will be 
regarded as a nonserious adverse event.
7.1.5.2. Expectedness
A serious adverse event that is not included in the Adverse Reaction section of the relevant 
reference safet y information by its specificit y, severity, outcome, or frequency is considered an 
unexpected adverse event. The reference safety information for this study is the I nvestigator’s 
Brochure.
The sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department will determine the expectedness for all serious 
adverse events.
For the purpose of SUSAR reporting, the version of the referen ce safety information document at 
the moment of the occurrence of the SUSAR applies.
Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 StudyTV48125- CNS-30050
817.1.5.3. Reporting a Serious Adverse Event
7.1.5.3.1. Investigator Responsibility
To satisfy  regulatory  requirements, a ll serious adverse events (as described in Section7.1.5.1) 
that occur during the definedstudy period, regardless of judged relationship to treatment with the 
study drug, must be reported to the sponsor by  the investigator. The event must be reported
within 24 hours of when the investigator learns about it. Completing the serious adverse event 
form and reporting the event must not be delay ed, even if not all the information is available.
The investigator does not need to activel y monitor patient s for adverse events once this study has
ended. Serious adverse events occurring in a patient after the defined stud y periodshould be 
reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them .
The serious adverse event form should be sent to the local safet y officer(LSO)or other 
designated personnel (a contract research organization [ CRO]in acountry without a sponsor 
LSO; contactinformation is in the Clinical Study  Personnel Contact Information section) ; the 
LSO will forward the report to the sponsor’s Global Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance 
Department .
The following information should be provided to record the event accurately  and completel y:
study number
investigator and investigational center identification
patient number
onset date and detailed description of adverse event
investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to the study  drug 
(no reasonable possibility , reasonable possibility )
Additional information may  include the following:
age and sex of patient
date of 1stdose of stud y drug
date and amount of last administered dose of study  drug
action taken
outcome, if known
severity
explanation of assessment of relatedness
concomitant therap y (including doses, routes, and regimens) and treatment of the 
event
pertinent laboratory  or other diagnostic test data
medical history
results of dechallenge/rechallenge, if known
Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 StudyTV48125- CNS-30050
82for an adverse event resulting in death:
cause of de ath (whether or not the death is related to study  drug)
autopsy findings (if available)
Each report of a serious adverse event will be reviewed and evaluated by  the investigator and the 
sponsor to assess the nature of the event and the relationship of the event to the study  drug, study  
procedures, and underl ying disease .
Additional information (follow -up) about an y serious adverse event unavailab le at the initial 
reporting should be forwarded b y the investigational center within 24 hours of when it becomes 
known to the same address as the initial report.
For all countries, the sponsor’s Global Patient Safety  & Pharmacovigilance Department will 
distribute the Council for I nternational Organizations of Medical Sciences form/extensible 
markup language fileto the LSO and/or CRO for local submission to the regulatory  authorities, 
IEC/IRBs, and investigators, according to regulations. The investigator i s responsible for 
ensuring that the IRB/ IEC is also informed of the event, in accordance with local regulations.
Blinding will be maintained for the people who are involved directly  in the study . Therefore, in 
case of a SUSAR, only  the LSO or CRO personnel involved with safet y regulatory submissions 
will receive the unblinded report for regulatory submission; the others will receive a blinded 
report.
Note: Although pregnancy is not a serious adverse event, the process for reporting a pregnancy  is 
the same a s that for reporting a serious adverse event , but using the pregnancy form(see 
Section7.2).
7.1.5.3.2. Sponsor Responsibility
If a serious unexpected adverse event is believed to be related to the stud y drug or study  
procedures, the sponsor will take appropriate steps to notify  all investigators participating in 
sponsored clinical studies of TEV -48125and the appropriate regulatory  authorities (and 
IEC/IRB, if appropriate) .
In addition to notify ing the investigators and re gulatory authorities (and IEC/IRB, if appropriate) , 
other measures may  be required, including the following:
altering existing research by  modifying the protocol
discontinuing or suspending the stud y
altering the process of informed consent b y modifying t he existing consent form and 
informing current stud y participants of new findings
modifying listings of expected toxicities to include adverse events newl y identified as 
related to TEV -48125
7.1.6. Protocol-Defined Adverse Events of Special Interest
The following are considered protocol -defined adverse events to be sent to the sponsor’s Global 
Patient Safety  andPharmacovigilance Department for evaluation: ophthalmic adverse events of 
at least moderate severit y, events of possible drug -induced liver injury  (AST or ALT ≥3 × the 
Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 StudyTV48125- CNS-30050
83ULN,totalbilirubin ≥2 × the ULN or INR >1.5), Hy ’s Law events , or events of suspected 
anaphylaxis andseverehypersensitivity  reactions. Severe hypersensitivity  reactions will be 
monitored using the diagnostic criteria for anaph ylaxis as ou tlined by the 2006 Joint National 
Institute of Allergy  and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphy laxis Network Second 
Symposium on Anaphy laxis(Sampson et al, 2006 [also seeAppendix F]). In the event of 
suspected anaph ylaxis, vital signs, including ox ygen saturation and respiration rate, will be 
measured. Other assessments will be performed at the discretion of the investigator.
The process for reporting a protocol- defined adverse event is the same as that for reporting a 
serious adverse event (see Section7.1.5.3).Protocol-defined adverse events for reporting to 
Pharmacovigilance Department can be either serious or nonserious according to the criteria 
outlined in Section7.1.5.
7.1.7. Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event
Any patient who experiences an adverse event may  be withdrawn from the study  or from study  
drug at an y time, at the discreti on of the investigator. If a patient is withdrawn because of an 
adverse event, both the adverse events page and termination page of the CRF will be completed 
at that time.
The patient will be monitored at the discretion of the investigator (eg, until the e vent has 
resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a health care professional, or 
until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study  drug or study  procedure is made). The 
investigator must inform the clinical project ph ysician/clinical leader as soon as possible of all 
patients who are being considered for withdrawal due to adverse events. Additional reports must 
be provided when requested.
If a patient is withdrawn from the study  or study drug for multiple reasons that inclu de adverse 
events, the termination page of the CRF should indicate that the withdrawal is related to an 
adverse event. An exception to this requirement will be the occurrence of an adverse event that, 
in the opinion of the investigator, is not severe enough to warrant discontinuation but requires the 
use of a prohibited medication, thereb y requiring discontinuation of the patient. I n such a case, 
the reason for discontinuation would be the need to take a prohibited medication, not the adverse 
event.
7.1.8. Overdose of Study Drug
Any dose of study  drug (whether the investigational productor placebo), whether taken 
intentionally  or unintentionally , in excess of that prescribed must be immediately  reported to the 
sponsor. When the identification of the stud y drug mus t be known, the investigator must follow 
the procedures outlined in Section3.8.
7.1.9. Protocol Deviations Because of an Adverse Event
If a patient experiences an adverse event or medical emergency, departures from the protocol 
may be allowed on a case -by-case basis . After stabilization and/or treatmen t hasbeen 
administered to ensure patient safet y, the investigator or other ph ysician in attendance must 
contact the individual identified in the Clinical Study  Personnel Contact Information section of 
this protocol as soon as possible to discuss the situation. The investigator, in consultation with 
the sponsor, will decide whether the patient should continue to participate in the study .
Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 StudyTV48125- CNS-30050
847.2. Pregnancy
All pregnancies of women p articipating in the study that occur during the study , or within
7.5months afterthe last administration of TEV -48125, are to be reported immediately  to the 
individual identified in the Clinical Study  Personnel Contact I nformation section of this protocol , 
and the investigator must provide the LSO and/or CROwith the pregnancy  form.The process for 
reporting a pregnancy is the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event (see 
Section7.1.5.3).
Any female pat ient becoming pregnant during the study  will discontinue the study  drug. All 
patients who become pregnant will be monitored for the outcome of the pregnancy  (including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination) . If the pregnancy  continues to term, the outcome ( health 
of the infant up to 8 weeks of age), including details of birth and presence or absence of any  birth 
defect, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and newborn complications, will be reported to the 
sponsor. Any  complication of pregnancy  during the study  and any complication of pregnancy  
that the investigator becomes aware of after termination from the study  will be reported as an 
adverse event or serious adverse event, as appropriate.
If the pregnancy  does not continue to term, 1 of the following act ions will be taken:
For a spontaneous abortion, report as a serious adverse event.
For an elective abortion due to developmental anomalies, report as a serious adverse 
event.
For an elective abortion notdue to developmental anomalies, report on the pregna ncy 
form; do not report as an adverse event.
For pregnancies of partners of men participating in the study , the Teva Pharmacovigilance 
Department will determine the procedure to appropriately  follow up after notification as 
described above. All partners wh o become pregnant and provide appropriate consent to the Teva 
Pharmacovigilance Department will be monitored to the completion or termination of the 
pregnancy .
7.3. Clinical Laboratory Tests
All clinical laboratory  test results outside of the reference range will be interpreted b y the 
investigator as belonging to 1 of the following categories:
abnormal but not a clinically significant worsening from baseline
abnormal and a clinically significant worsening from baseline
A laboratory  test result that has significa ntly worsened (according to medical judgment) from the 
baseline result will be recorded on the source documentation, transcribed onto the CRF as an 
adverse event, and monitored as described in Section7.1.2.An adverse event includes a 
laboratory  or diagnostic test abnormality  (once confirmed by  repeat testing) that results in the 
withdrawal of the patient from the study , the temporary  or permanent cessation of treatment with 
study drug, or medical treatment or fu rther diagnostic work -up.
In addition, potentially  clinically  significant values will be predefined b y the sponsor for selected 
laboratory  parameters and will be detailed in the statistical analy sis plan.

7.3.5. Other Clinical Laboratory Tests
7.3.5.1. Human Chorionic Gonadotrop in Tests
Serum β-HCG tests will be performed for womenof childbearing potential at screening (visit 1), 
and urine β -HCG tests will be performed for women of childbearing potential at visits 2 
through5. Any patient who becomes pregnant during the stud y will be withdrawn. Procedures 
for reporting the pregnancy  are provided in Section7.2. 
7.3.5.2. Follicle-Stimulating Horm one Tests
Postmenopausal women will have an FSH test at screening (visit 1).
7.4. Vital Signs
Vital signs (pulse, s ystolic and diastolic blood pressure, body  temperature, and respiratory  rate) 
will be measured before other assessments (eg, blood draws and admin istration of 
questionnaires) at the time points detailed in Table1.
Before pulse and blood pressure are measured, the patient must be in a supine or 
semi-erect/seated position and resting for at least 5 minutes. Th e same position and arm should 
be used each time vital signs are measured for a given patient. Forany abnormal vital sign 
finding, the measurement should be repeated as soon as possible. Any  vital sign value that is 
judged by the investigator as a clinica lly significant change (worsening) from a baseline value 
will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto 
the CRF, and monitored as described in Section7.1.2.
In addition, potentially  clinically  significant values may  be predefined by  the sponsor for 
selected vital signs (see Section9.7.2)and, if so, will be documented in the statistical analy sis 
plan or other relevant doc uments (eg, medical monitoring plan).
7.5. Electrocardiography
Twelve-lead ECG swill be conducted before other assessments (eg, blood draws and 
administration of questionnaires) at the time points detailed in Table1.The ECGs should be 
performed after the patient has been supine for at least 5 minutes. The ECG swill be performed 
in triplicate.
Aqualified ph ysician at a central diagnostic center will be responsible for interpreting the ECG. 
ECGs should be performed and t ransmitted according to the central ECG reading instructions 
provided in the ECG user manual. ECG equipment will be provided to all clinical sites .

Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 StudyTV48125- CNS-30050
88Although the ECG interpretation will be performed centrall y, the clinical evaluation remains 
under the Investigator’s responsibility .
The ECG will be evaluated by the Investigator at the time of recording (signed and dated), and 
the printout should be kept in the source documentation file. When potentially  clinically 
significant findings are detected b y the Investigator, a cardiologist should be consulted for a 
definitive interpretation. All communications and diagnoses should be filed in the source 
documentation file. The Investigator ’s interpretation will be recorded in the CRF regardless of 
the central reading interpretation. Any  abnormal findings assessed b y the Investigator as 
clinically significant should be recorded in the relevant CRF modules (eg, adverse event, medical 
history).
Objective alerts are predefined as described in the central ECG reading manua l. In these cases, 
the site and the sponsor will be informed immediately .
Any unscheduled ECGs must also be submitted for central ECG reading.
Any ECG finding that is judged by  the investigator as a potentiall y clinically significant change 
(worsening) com pared with a baseline value will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the 
source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF, and monitored as described in 
Section7.1.2.
7.6. Physical Examinations
Physical exam inations, including height (to be obtained at the screening visit only ) and weight 
will be performed at the time points detailed in Table1.
A complete ph ysical examination will include the following organ s ystems: general appearance; 
head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; chest and lung s; heart; abdomen; musculoskeletal; skin; ly mph 
nodes; and neurological. Any physical examination finding that is judged by  the investigator as a 
potentially  clinically significant chang e (worsening) compared with a baseline value will be 
considered an adverse event, recorded on the CRF, and monitored as described in Section7.1.2.
7.7. Electronic Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale
The eC-SSRS will be used to assess the patient’s suicidal ideation (severity  and intensity ) and 
behavior ( Posner et al 2011). The eC-SSRS Baseline/Screening version will be completed b y the 
patientat visit 2, and the eC- SSRS Since L ast Visit version will be completed by the patient at 
all other time points, as described in Table1. Any positive findings on the eC-SSRS Since L ast 
Visit version requires evaluation by  a physician or doctoral -level psychologist.
7.8. Concomitant Therapy or Medication
Concomitant therap y or medication usage will be monitored throughout the study. Details of 
prohibited medications are found in Section5.3. 
7.9. Immunogenicity
Blood samples for serum ADA assessment will be collected at visits 2, 3, and the EOT/earl y 
withdrawal visit. Only  the samples from TEV- 48125-treated patients will be anal yzed for ADA. 
Blood samples for ADA assessment will also be collected upon observation of an y severe

89hypersensitivity  reaction (eg, anaph ylaxis). See Appendix Ffor the clinical criteria for 
diagnosing anaph ylaxis. Bioanalytical personnel should be made aware of any  anaphylaxis 
occurrence as soon as possible in case an anti- TEV-48125 immunoglobulin E assay  is required.
7.10. Injection Site Assessments
Injection site assessments will be performed immediatel y and 1 hour after administration of each 
dose of study  drug (Table1). The injection site(s) will be assessed for erythema, induration, 
ecchymosis, and pain, and severit y will be graded according to the following criteria:
Injection-site erythema, injection -site induration, and injection-site ecchymosis will 
be graded according to measurements: absent, 5 mm to ≤50 mm (mild), >50 to 
≤100mm (moderate), and >100 mm (severe). Induration must be assessed by  careful 
superficial palpation avoiding pressuring or squeezing the injection site.
Injection-site pain will be measured as summarized in Table3.
Table3:Severity of Pain Scale for Injection Site Assessments
Grade Assessments
0 No pain
1 Mild
2 Moderate
3 Severe
4 Worst possible
If a patient has severe injection site induration, erythema, and/or ecchy mosis and/or grade 3 
(severe) or grade 4 (worst possible) injection site pain at 1 hour after completion of study  drug 
administration, the patient will be reassessed at 3 hours after stud y drug administration and 
hourly thereafter until the reaction/pain is of moderate or less severity .
Appropriate treatment may  be provided if necessary , in which case it must be recorded as 
concomitant medication.
Injection site reactions will also be recorde d as adverse events as described in Section7.1.
7.11. Methods and Timing of Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety 
Data
All adverse events will be reviewed on a periodic basis by  the clinical project phy sician/medical 
monitor according to the safet y monitoring plan (eg, scheduled safet y reviews for TEV -48125)
as interim/preliminary  safety databases become available. Safety data will additionally  be 
evaluated periodicall y and ad hoc (if necessary) in the Product Saf ety Group.
Methods and timing of assessing safet y data are discussed in Section 3.14.Procedures for 
recording safet y data are discussed in Section 13.1and methods of analyses are discussed in

IMMUNOGENICITY
8.1. Pharmacok inetic Variables
Sampling for pharmacokinetics will be sparse. Thus, t he TEV-48125 pharmacokinetic samp les 
will be anal yzed using a population pharmacokinetic approach and will be reported separatel y to 
the clinical study  report.
Samples from patients who receive active stud y drug will be anal yzed for TEV -48125 using a 
validated method. Samples from patients who receive placebo will not be anal yzed.
8.1.1. Specimen Sampling and Handling
Blood samples (4 mL) will be collected via venipuncture or indwelling catheter at the time points 
detailed in Table1for plasma concentrati on measurements of TEV -48125.
The dates and times of study  drug administration and the date and time of each pharmacokinetic 
sample will be recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF.
For plasma collection, samples will be collected into dipotassium EDTAcollection tubes, 
inverted slowly  6to8times tomix the contents, and placed on water/ice (~4°C). Blood samples 
will be centrifuged (1500g, ~10 minutes, 2°C to 6°C) between 5 minutes and 1 hour after 
sampling. If a refrigerated cent rifuge is not available, samples should be chilled before 
centrifugation. Other measures should be taken as appropriate to prevent samples from heating 
significantl y during centrifugation. Separated plasma will be transferred in approximately equal 
portions into 2labeled, 2-mL polypropylene tubes (sets AandB).
Labels for samples should include study  number, patient number, period, nominal collection 
time, set (A or B), and indication that they are pharmacokinetic samples. Samples will be stored 
at a temperature within the range of -70°C ±20°C in an upright position until they  are shipped to 
the central laboratory .
8.1.2. Shipment and Analysis of Samples
Plasma samples for all patients will be shipped frozen on dry  ice from the investigational center 
to the centr al laboratory , where they  will be stored until shipment to the sponsor or its designee
for analysis.
SetA samples will be transported (frozen) with a temperature data logger, by 
next-day courier, to the central laboratory .
SetB samples will either be sen t to the same laboratory  as that for set A on a 
subsequent day , by next-day courier, or be retained at the investigational center until 
the study is completed and the clinical study  report has been issued (unless shipment 
to another facility  is requested b y the sponsor).
Samples will be analy zed using a validated method. Timing of the initiation of sample anal ysis 
will be determined b y the Teva Pharmaceuticals bioanal ytical representative responsible for the 
bioanalysis. Refer to the laboratory  manual for a dditional details.

method. Samples from patients who receive placebo will not be analy zed.
Blood samples (5 mL) will be collected via venipuncture or indwelling catheter at the time points 
detailed in Table1for immunogenicit y testing.
For serum collection, samples will be collected into Vacutainer tubes containing no 
anticoagulant, and allowed to set at room temperature less than 30 minutes to allow for serum 
separation to occur. Samples will then be centrifuged (1500g, approximately  10minutes, 2°C to 
6°C). If a refrigerated centrifuge is not available, samples should be chilled before centrifugation. 
Other measures should be taken as appropriate to prevent samples from heating significantl y

8.3. Assessment of Exploratory Biofluid Biomarkers
Biomarkers are defined as biological substances that monitor phy siological effects, assess drug 
activity, and predict clinical outcome, safet y, and response to therap y.
Calcitonin gene -related peptide -containing nerve fibers are prevale nt in bone tissue and have 
been hypothesized to be important in the regulation of bone metabolism, response to bone injury ,
and the perception of bone pain. In vitro, CGRP is anabolic to osteoblasts and can inhibit 
maturation to osteoclasts. Preclinical st udies suggest CGRP antagonism may have benefit in 
osteoarthritis ( Benschop et al 2014) and bone -related pain. In the current study , exploratory  
Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 StudyTV48125- CNS-30050
92analysis may be conducte d on blood (serum, plasma, and RNA) and urine b iomarkers, 
extracellular matrix turnover, bone formation, and bone resor ption.
In preclinical models, CGRP can promote angiogenesis in ischemia, capsaicin -induced s ynovitis, 
and neovascularization of tumors. Exploratory  analysis will be conducted on 
endothelial/angiogenic markers to determine if TEV -48125 alters angiogenic markers .
Calcitonin gene -related peptide is known to act directly  on macrophage and dendritic cells by  
inhibiting them from producing inflammatory  cytokines and presenting antigens to T c ells. It has 
been hypothesized that CGRP may act as a regulator of the innate immune response. Exploratory 
analysis will be conducted on inflammatory  endpoints in blood to examine effects of TEV -48125 
in patients with migraine .
Based on the known biology  of CGRP’s mechanism of action, biomarker assessm ent will 
potentially  includemarkers of bone remodeling, inflamma tion, and angiogenesis. M ultiplex 
immunoassay  panels will be applied to measure changes in urine, serum, plasma, and RNA
biomarkers.
The planned biomarker analy sis will be detailed in a separate document, which may  be updated 
at a later stage before the anal ysis to allow updating with new scientific information .
8.3.1. Pharmacogen omicAssessment
A blood sample (6 mL) will be collected from each patient who signs the separate informed 
consent form for pharmacogenomic assessment during this study . Pharmacogen omicassessment 
potentially  includes the association anal ysis of both known and unknown DNA and RNA genetic 
variations. In the current study , known CGR P and migraine
-associated genes will be examined to 
determine the irassociation with clinical treatment responses to study  drug and their potential to 
be markers predictive of migraine severit y and progression (eg, efficacy , pharmacokinetics, 
tolerability ,and safety features or disease susceptibility  and severity  features). The current list of 
genes with poly morphisms associated with either CGRP target engagement or migraine 
mechanism of action includes CALCA, CALCB, CAL CRL, CRCP, RAMP, PRDM16, AJAP1, 
TSPAN2, MEF2D, TRPM8, TGFBR2, PHACTR1, FHL5, C7orf10, MMP16, ASTN2, L RP1, 
APOA1BP, TBC1D7, F UT9, STAT6, ATP 5B, and MTHFR (Anttila et al 2013 ). The final list of 
genes that may  be investigated may  be edited ata later timebefore the anal ysis to allow updating 
with new scientific information. Genetic analy sis could also include sequencing of the whole 
genome and/ or RNA transcripts ,if required.
Pharmacogen omicassessment will be performed based on study  results. Samples wi ll be used for 
investigations related to headache, indications where CGRP pathway s are implicated, and 
indications that may  be associated with the risk of headache or those that are common 
comorbidities associated with headache and/or response to study  drug or related investigational 
drugs.
8.3.2. Specimen Sampling and Handling
Blood samples ( a total of 18.5mL; 6 mL each for plasma andserum and 6.5 mL forRNA 
[PAXgene]) will be collected via venipuncture or indwelling catheter at the time points detailed 
inTable1forserum,plasma, and RNA biomarker measures. Urine will be collected in parallel 
with blood collection. I n addition, a 6 -mL whole blood sample will be collected at baseline for 
Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 StudyTV48125- CNS-30050
93DNA. Details for processing and handling of each ty pe of biomarker sample will be outlined in 
the laboratorymanual.
All blood and urine tubes will be labeled with the patient coded number. Following DNA 
extraction from pharmacogenomic sample, the sample will be labeled with a new code 
(ie,double coding), so that genetic data will not be recorded having a patient number.
Samples will be stored for a period of up to 15 yearsfrom the last patient last visit in the main 
study and then destroy ed.
8.3.3. Shipment and Analysis of Samples
Biomarker samples for serum, plasma, RNA, and urine will be stored at –70°C and sent to the 
central laboratory  on dry ice ,per instructions in the laboratory  manual. Sample labels should 
include study  number, patient randomization number, visit code, collection date and time, and 
indication that they  are biomarker samples. Shipments should be made as specified in laboratory  
manual. An electronic file containing sample demographics will be e -mailed to the respective 
biomarker laboratory  and the sponsor’s biomarker repr esentative for each shipment.
Following DNA extractions of whole blood, the samples will be stored at –70°C and labeled 
with a new code (ie, double coding) ,so that genomic data will not be recorded with a patient 
number. Data will be kept confidential and stored separately .
The biomarker sample analy ses will be performed if and when required. Since new techniques 
continue to be developed, the method and laboratory  that will be recommended for the future 
biomarker anal ysis cannot be anticipated.

9.7.2. Safety Analysis
All adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities. Each 
patient will be counted only  once in each preferred term or s ystem organ class category forthe 
analyses of safet y. Summaries will be presented for all adverse events (overall and by severit y), 
adverse events determined by  the investigator to be related to study  treatment (ie, reasonable 
possibility ; see Section 7.1.4) (defined as related or with missing relationship) (overall and b y 
severity), serious adverse events, and adverse events causing withdrawal from the study . Patient 
listings of serious adverse events and adverse events leading to withdrawal will be presented.
Injection site ery thema, induration, ecch ymosis, and pain will be assessed as described in 
Section7.9, and findings will be listed and summarized.
Changes in laboratory  and vital signs measur ement data will be summarized descriptively. All 
values will be compared with prespecified boundaries to identify  potentially  clinically significant 
changes or values, and such values will be listed.
The use of concomitant medications will be summarized by therapeutic class using descriptive 
statistics. Concomitant medications will include all medications taken while the patient is treated 
with study  drug.
Safety data will be summarized descriptivel y overall and by  treatment group . Forcontinuous 
variables, descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD , median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided 
for actual values and changes from baseline to each time point . Forcategorical variables, patient 
counts and percentages will be provided . Descriptive summaries of seriou s adverse events, 
patient withdrawals due to adverse events, and potentially  clinically significant abnormal values 
(clinical laboratory  or vital signs) based on predefined criteria will also be provided.
If any patient dies during the study, a listing of deaths will be provided and all relevant 
information will be discussed in the patient narrative include d in the clinical study  report.

10110. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOUR CE DATA/DOCUMENTS
The medical experts, study  monitors, auditors, IEC/I RB, and health authority  inspectors (or their 
agents) will be given direct access to source data and documentation (eg, medical charts/records, 
laboratory test results, printouts, and videotapes) for source data verification, provided that 
patient confidentiality is maintained in accordance with local requirements.
The investigator must maintain the original records (ie, source documents) of each patien t’s data 
at all times. Examples of source documents are hospital records, office visit records, examining 
physician’s finding or notes, consultant’s written opinion or notes, laboratory  reports, drug 
inventory , study drug label records, diary  data, protocol- required worksheets, and CRFs that are 
used as the source (see Section 3.13).
The investigator will maintain a confidential patient identification list that allows the 
unambiguous identification of each patient . All study -related documents must be kept until 
notification by  the sponsor.

10211. QUALITY  CONTROL  AND QUALITY  ASSURANCE
11.1. Protocol Amendments and Protocol Deviations and Violations
11.1.1. Protocol Amendments
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written 
approval or favorable opinion of a written amendment by  the IEC/IRB and national and local 
competent authorities ,as applicable , except when necessary  to address immediate safety  
concerns to the patients, or when the cha nge involves only  nonsubstantial logistics or 
administration. The principal investigator at each investigational center, the coordinating 
investigator (if applicable), and the sponsor will sign the protocol amendment.
11.1.2. Protocol Violations
Any deviation from the protocol that affects, to a significant degree, (a) the safet y, physical, or 
mental integrit y of the subjects of the study and/or (b) the scientific value of the study will be 
considered a protocol violation. Protocol violations may  include nonadherence on the part of the 
patient, the investigator, or the sponsor to protocol- specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
primary objective variable criteria, or GCP guidelines; noncompliance to study  drug 
administration; and use of prohibited medications. Protocol violations will be identified and 
recorded b y investigational center personnel inthe CRF. All protocol violations will be reported 
to the responsible IEC/I RB, as required.
When a protocol violation is reported, the sponsor will determine whether to discontinue the 
patient from the study  or permit the patient to continue in the study , with documented approval 
from the medical expert. The decision will be based on ensuring the safety of the patient and 
preserving the integrity  of the study .
Changes in the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the protocol are notprospectivel y granted by 
the sponsor. If investigational center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol 
inclusion and exclusion criteria was entered in a study , they must immedi ately inform the 
sponsor of the protocol violation. I f such patient has already  completed the study  or has 
withdrawn early, no action will be takenbut the violation will be recorded .
11.2. Information to Study Personnel
The investigator is responsible for givin g information about the study  to all staff members 
involved in the study  or in any  element of patient management, both before starting the study  and 
during the course of the study  (eg, when new staff members become involved). The investigator 
must assure t hat all study staff members are qualified by  education, experience, and training to 
perform their specific responsibilities. These study  staff members must be listed on the 
investigational center authorization form, which includes a clear description of ea ch staff 
member’s responsibilities. This list must be updated throughout the study , as necessary .
The study  monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to all study  staff, including the 
investigator, and for ensuring that they  comply with the protoc ol. Additional information will be 
Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 StudyTV48125- CNS-30050
103made available during the study  when new staff members become involved in the study  and as 
otherwise agreed upon with either the investigator or the study  monitor.
11.3. Study Monitoring
To ensure compliance with GCP guidelines , the study  monitor or representative is responsible 
for ensuring that patients have signed the informed consent form and the study  is conducted 
according to applicable standard operating procedures (SOPs), the protocol, and other written 
instructions and regulatory  guidelines.
The study  monitor is the primary  association between the sponsor and the investigator. The main 
responsibilities of the study  monitor(s) are to visit the investigator before, during, and after the 
study to ensure adherence to the pro tocol, that all data are correctl y and completely  recorded and 
reported, and that informed consent is obtained and recorded for all patients before they  
participate in the study and when changes to the consent form are warranted, in accordance with 
IEC/IRBapprovals.
The study  monitor(s) will contact the investigator and visit the investigational center at regular 
intervals throughout the study . The stud y monitor will be permitted to check and verify the 
various records (CRFs and other pertinent source datarecords, including specific electronic 
source documentation [see Section 3.13]) relating to the study  to verify adherence to the protocol 
and to ensure the completeness, consistency , and accuracy  of the data bei ng recorded. If 
electronic CRFs are used for the study , the study  monitor will indicate verification by  
electronically  applying source document verification flags to the CRF and will ensure that all 
required electronic signatures are being implemented acco rdingly.
As part of the supervision of study  progress, other sponsor personnel may , on request, 
accompan y the study  monitor on visits to the investigational center. The investigator and 
assisting staff must agree to cooperate with the study  monitor to reso lve any problems, errors, or 
possible misunderstandings concerning the findings detected in the course of these monitoring 
visits and/or provided in follow- up written communication.
11.4. Clinical Product Complaints
A clinical product complaint is defined as a p roblem or potential problem with the phy sical 
quality or characteristics of clinical drug supplies and/or clinical device supplies used in a 
clinical research stud y sponsored b y Teva. Examples of a product complaint include, but are not 
limited to, the fol lowing:
suspected contamination
questionable stability  (eg, color change, flaking, crumbling, etc)
defective components
missing or extra units (eg, primary  container is received at the site with more or less 
than the designated number of units inside)
incorrect packaging or incorrect or missing labeling/labels
unexpected or unanticipated taste or odor (or both)
Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 StudyTV48125- CNS-30050
104device not working correctly  or appears defective in some manner
Each investigational center will be responsible for reporting a possible clinical p roduct complaint 
by completing the Product Complaint Form provided by  Teva and emailing it to 
within 48 hours of becoming aware of the issue.
For complaints involving a device or other retrievable item, it is requir ed that the device (or 
item) be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. For complaints 
involving a drug product, all relevant samples (eg, the remainder of the patient’s drug supply ) 
should be sent back to the sponsor for inve stigative testing whenever possible.
11.4.1. Product Complaint Information Needed from the Investigational Center
In the event that the Product Complaint Form cannot be completed, the investigator will obtain 
the following information, as available:
investigationa l center number and principal investigator name
name, phone number, and address of the source of the complaint 
clinical protocol number
patient identifier (patient study  number) and correspondi ng visit numbers, if 
applicable
patient number, bottle, and kit numbers (if applicable)
product available for return (y es, no)
product was taken or used according to protocol (y es, no)
description or nature of complaint
associated serious adverse event (y es, no)
clinical supplies unblinded (y es, no)
date and name of person receiving the complaint
Note: Reporting a complaint must not be delay ed because not all the required information can be 
immediately  obtained. Known information must be immediately  reported. The sponsor will 
collaborate with the investigator to obtai n any outstanding information.
11.4.2. Handling the Study Drug at the Investigational Center
The investigator is responsible for retaining the product in question in a location separate from 
the investigator’s clinical study  supplies. The sponsor may  request that the investigator return the 
product for further evaluation and/or anal ysis. If this is necessary , the clinical study  monitor or 
designee will provide the information needed for returning the stud y drug.
If it is determined that the investigational center m ust return all of the study  drug, the sponsor 
will provide the information needed to handle the return.
The integrity  of the randomization code and corresponding blinded clinical supplies will be 
maintained whenever possible. A serious adverse event or the potential for a product quality  

Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 StudyTV48125- CNS-30050
105problem existing bey ond the scope of the complaint may  be a reason to unblind the clinical 
supplies for an affected patient.
11.4.3. Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Associated with a Product Complaint
If there is an advers e event or serious adverse event, the protocol should be followed.
11.4.4. Documenting a Product Complaint
The investigator will record a description of the product complaint in the source documentation 
as well as an y actions taken to resolve the complaint and to preserve the safety of the patient. 
Once the complaint has been investigated b y the sponsor and the investigator, if necessary , an 
event closure letter may  be sent to the investigational center where the complaint originated or to 
all investigational cente rs using the product.
11.5. Audit and Inspection
The sponsor may  audit the investigational center to evaluate study  conduct and compliance with 
protocols, SOPs, GCPs, and applicable regulatory  requirements. The sponsor’s Global Clinical 
Quality Assurance departm ent, independent of the Global Clinical Development department, is 
responsible for determining the need for (and timing of) an investigational center audit.
The investigator must accept that regulatory  authorities, and sponsor representatives may  
conduct inspections to verify  compliance with GCP guidelines.

10612. ETHICS
Details of compliance with regulatory  guidances and applicable laws are provided in Section 1.6.
12.1. Informed Consent
The investigator, or a qualified perso n designated by  the investigator, should fully  inform the 
patient of all pertinent aspects of the stud y, including the written information approved b y the 
IEC/IRB. All written and/or oral information about the study  will be provided in a language as 
nontechnical as practical and understood b y the patient. The patient should be given ample time 
and opportunity to inquire about details of the study  and to decide whether or not to participate in 
the study. The above should be detailed in the source documentati on.
Written informed consent will be obtained from each patient before any  study-specific 
procedures or assessments are done and after the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and 
potential hazards are explained, according to the IEC/I RB requirements. The patient’s 
willingness to participate in the study  will be documented in a consent form, which will be 
signed and personally  dated by the patient and by  the person who conducted the informed 
consent discussion. The investigator will keep the original consen t forms, and copies will be 
given to the patients. I t will also be explained to the patients that the patient is free to refuse entry  
into the study  and free to withdraw from the study  at any time without prejudice to future 
treatment.
Patients will be ask ed to sign a separate informed consent form if they  agree to provide blood 
samples for pharmacogenomic assessment.
12.2. Health Authorities and Independent Ethics Committees/Institutional 
Review Boards
Before this study  starts, the protocol will be submitted to the national/local health authorities and 
to each IEC/IRB for review. As required, the study will not start at a given investigational center 
before the IEC/I RB and health authority  (where applicable) for the center togive written 
approval or a favorable opinion.
12.3. Confidentiality Regarding Study Patients
The investigator must ensure that the privacy  of the patients, including their identity  and all 
personal medical information, will be maintained at all times. I n CRFs and other documents or 
image material s ubmitted to the sponsor, patients will be identified not by  their names, but by  an 
identification code (ie, identification number).
Personal medical information may  be reviewed for the purpose of patient safet y and/or verifying 
data in the source and trans cribed onto the CRF. This review may  be conducted by  the study  
monitor, properly  authorized persons on behalf of the sponsor, the quality  assurance unit, and/or 
regulatory  authorities. Personal medical information will always be treated as confidential.

10813. DATA HANDLING , DATA QUALITY CONTROL, AND RECORD 
KEEPING
13.1. Data Collection
Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically  designed for this study . The data collected 
on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management s ystem (CDMS) that meets the 
technical requirements described in 21CFR Part 11. The CDMS will be fully  validated to ensure 
that it meets the scientific, regulatory, and logistical requirements of the s tudy before it is used to 
capture data from this study . Before using the CDMS, all users will receive training on the 
system and study -specific training. After they  are trained, users will be provided with individual 
system access rights.
Data will be collected at the investigational center by  appropriatel y designated and trained 
personnel, and CRFs must be completed for each patient who provided informed consent. Patient 
identity should not be discernible from the data provided on the CRF. Data will be ver ified using 
the data source b y the study  monitor, and reviewed for consistency  by Data Management using 
both automated logical checks and manual review. All data collected will be approved b y the 
investigator at the investigational center. This approval ac knowledges the investigator’s review 
and acceptance of the data as being complete and accurate.
If data are processed from other sources (eg, central laboratory, bioanal ytical laboratory , central 
image center, electronic diary  data, or ePRO Tablet), the re sults will be sent to the investigational 
center, where they  will be retained but not entered into the CRF, unless otherwise specified in the 
protocol. These data may also be sent electronically to the sponsor (or organization performing 
data management) f or direct entry  into the clinical database. Laboratory  test results will not be 
entered into the CRF, unless otherwise noted in the protocol. All data from other sources will be 
available to the investigators.
For patients who enter a study  but do not meet entry criteria, at a minimum, data for screen 
failure reason, demography , and adverse events from the time of informed consent will be 
entered into the CRF. 
13.2. Data Quality C ontrol 
Data Management is responsible for the accuracy , quality, completeness, and internal 
consistency  of the data from this study . Data handling, including data quality  control(QC), will 
comply with international regulatory  guidelines, including ICH GCP guidelines. Data 
management and control processes specific to this study , along with all steps and actions taken 
regarding data management and data QC, will be described in a data management plan.
Case report form sreceived will be processed and reviewed for completeness, consistency , and 
the presence of mandatory  values. Applicable te rms will be coded according to the coding 
conventions for this study. Logical checks will be implemented to ensure data quality  and 
accuracy. Any necessary  changes will be made in the clinical database, and data review and 
validation procedures will be rep eated as needed. Data from external sources will be compared 
with the information available in the CDMS. Discrepancies found will be queried.
Placebo-Controlled Study –Episodic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 StudyTV48125- CNS-30050
109Data corrections in the CDMS will be made using the CDMS update function. The sy stem 
requires a reason for each ch ange and keeps a complete audit trail of the data values, dates and 
times of modifications, and authorized electronic approvals of the changes.
At the conclusion of the study, the CDMS and all other study  data will be locked to further 
additions or correct ions.Locking the stud y data represents the acknowledgement that all data 
have been captured and confirmed as accurate.
13.3. Archiving of Case Report Forms and Source Documents
13.3.1. Sponsor Responsibilities
The sponsor will have final responsibility  for the processi ng and QC of the data. Data 
management oversight will be carried out as described in the sponsor’s SOPs for clinical studies.
Day-to-day data management tasks for this study  are delegated to a CRO, and these functions 
may be carried out as described in the SOPs for clinical studies at that organization. These SOPs 
will be reviewed b y the sponsor before the start of data management activities. The original 
CRFs will be archived b y the sponsor. Center -specific CRFs will be provided to the respective 
investigational centers for archiving.
13.3.2. Investigator Responsibilities
The investigator must maintain all written and electronic records, accounts, not es, reports, and 
data related to the study  and any additional records required to be maintained under country , 
state/province, or other local laws, including, but not limited to, the following :

Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 StudyTV48125- CNS-30050
110The investigator will retain all records related to the study  until the CRO or sponsor sends 
written notification that records may  be destroy ed. If, after 10 years from study  completion, or 
earlier (in the case of the investigative center clo sing or going out of business), the investigator 
reasonabl y determines that study  record retention has become undul y burdensome, and sponsor 
has not provided written notification of destruction, then the investigator may  submit a written 
request to sponsor at least sixty  60 days before any  planned disposition of study  records. Upon 
receipt of such request, the sponsor may  make arrangements for appropriate archival or 
disposition, including requiring that the investigator deliver such records to the sponsor. The 
investigator shall notify  the sponsor of any  accidental loss or destruction of study  records.

11617. SUMMARY OF CHANGES T O PROTOCOL TV48125 -CNS-30049
17.1. Amendm ent 01Dated 30 March 2016
The primary  reasons for this amendment are as follows:
To incorporate required revisions based on health authority  input from the European 
Medicines Agency , FDA, and Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency .
To provide clarify ing language for the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
To clarify  allowed and disallowed preventive medications
To revise protocol -defined adverse events of special interest, and to add clinical 
criteria for diagnosing anaphy laxis
To update and/or clarify  versions of certain exploratory endpoints, including the 
EQ-5D (now -5L) and PGI C, respectively .
This revision is considered to be substantial by  the sponsor ’s Authorized Representative. Other 
nonsubstantial revisions have been made to the protocol (and pro tocol synopsis, as appropriate). 
These changes are unlikely  to affect to a significant degree the safet y or rights (ph ysical or 
mental integrit y) of the patients in the clinical study or the scientific value of the clinical stud y.

1BACKGROUND INFORMATION
1.1Introduction (Other sections affected by this change: Section 16)
However, approximately 3% to 6%of individuals 
with EM evolve, in any given year, to a significantly 
more disabling condition called chronic migraine 
(CM) (Bigal et al 2008, Lipton et al 2007, Scher et 
al 2003). Individuals with CM present with 
headaches of any severity on 15 or more days per 
month and have full -blown migraine on at least 8 
days per month ( Classification Committe e of the 
IHS, 2013). A sizable proportion of individuals with 
CM experience sdaily headaches and, therefore, faces
considerable disability (Bigal and Lipton 2008).
[…]
Calcitonin gene -related peptide (CGRP) is a well -
studied neuropeptide found at the cente rs of the 
migraine processes, both centrally and peripherally 
(Eftekhari and Edvinsson 2010, Olesen 2011).However, approximately 3% of individuals with EM 
evolve, in any given year, to a significantly more 
disabling condition called chronic migraine (CM) 
(Bigal et al 2008, Lipton et al 2007, Scher et al 
2003). Individuals with CM present with headaches 
of any severity on 15 or more days per month and 
have full-blown migraine on at least 8 days per 
month (Classification Committee of the IHS, 2013). 
A sizable proportion of individuals with CM 
experiences daily headaches and, therefore, faces 
considerable disability (Bigal and Lipton 2008).

response rates to prevent migraine, only 5 marketed 
drugs are approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) in the United States (US) 
for the preventive treatme nt of migraine; 4 of 
them are approved for the prophylaxis of 
migraine: propranolol, timolol maleate, 
divalproex sodium, and topiramate. The clinical 
trials (Brandes et al 2004, Klapper 1997, Mathew 
et al 1995, Nadelmann et al 1986, Silberstein et al 
2004)that supported registration of these drugs 
for this indication were conducted before the 
establishment of CM as a single entity and 
generally included patients with headaches on less 
than 15 days per month. 4 (propranolol [Inderal®, 
Akrimax Pharmaceutical s], timolol [Blocadren®, 
Merck & Co, Inc.], divalproex sodium [Depakote®, 
AbbVie, Inc.], and topiramate [Topamax®, Jannsen]) 
are approved by the United States Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for the prevention or 
prophylaxis of EM and only 1 (onabotulin umtoxinA 
[Botox®, Allergan, Inc.]) is approved for the 
prevention of CM Only 1medication, 
onabotulinumtoxinA, is approved for prophylaxis 
of CM (Lipton and Silberstein 2015). Notably, 
despite evidence suggesting that inhibition of CGRP 
is effective as a p reventive migraine treatment, no 
available treatment directly targets CGRP.these classes of drugs that are used with varying

The inflammation was considered suspected to be the 
result of immune complex formation/deposition from 
the monkeys’ immunogenic response to the drug 
(TEV-48125) and was not c onsidered to be clinically 
relevant. In thepivotal 6-month chronic toxicity 
study in monkeys following once- weekly sc dosing at 
dosage levels of up to 300 mg/kg/week, achieving 
high exposure throughout the study, no 
microscopic findings were noted in any 
of the organs, 
including the cil iary vessels of the eyes , and the 
NOAEL of the chronic toxicity study was 
determined to be the highest dose tested, 300 
mg/kg/week. Thus, it is believed that in view of the 
low frequency (ie, observed in very few animals) 
and minimal severity, the finding (perivascular 
inflammation) that was only recorded in the 3 -
month toxicity study, and had been resolved 
during the recovery period, is an incidental 
finding.
The pharmacokinetics of TEV -48125 in animals 
(rats and monkeys) i s typical of a humanized IgG2 
molecule, with low mean plasma clearance, low 
volume of distribution at steady state, and a long 
t½. Exposure as defined by the maximum observed 
plasma drug concentration (C max) and the area 
under the plasma concentration -timecurve 
increased linearly across doses following single 
and repeated once -weekly dosing. No gender 
differences in exposure were observed in rats or 
monkeys.
Additionally, pivotal reproductive and developmental 
toxicity studies in animals rabbits and rats with 
TEV-48125 were conducted. The in life portion wasmonkey.

provided with the randomi zation code in order to 
facilitate the analysis. However, the personnel 
responsible for bioanalysis and pharmacokinetic data 
analysiswill not have access to clinical safety and 
efficacy data and will provide concentration data to 
other personnel in a mann er that will not identify 
individual patients (ie, a dummy patient identifier

Protocol violations will be identified and recorded by 
investigational center personnel oninthe CRF. All 
protocol violations will be reported to the responsible 
IEC/IRB, as requir ed.
When a protocol violation is reported, the sponsor will 
determine whether to discontinue the patient from the 
study or permit the patient to continue in the study, 
with documented approval from the medical 
representative expert. The decision will be bas ed on 
ensuring the safety of the patient and preserving the 
integrity of the study.

162APPENDIX E.GUIDANCE ON SAFETY M ONITORING
Guidance on Monitoring Patients with Elevated Liver Function Tests
Liver enzy mes (ALT, AST, GGT, and ALP) as well as totaland direct bilirubin will be measured 
(and indirect bilirubin will be calculated) at each study  visit.
In any case of elevated ALT or AST to a level exceeding ≥2× the ULN (including patients whose 
baseline ALT or AST levels are ≥2× and ≤3× the ULN, who may  be enrolled in the study ), a 
thorough medical history and phy sical examination with a focus on liver d isease should be 
undertaken.1In addition, the patient should be instructed to refrain from alcoholic beverages.
In case of s ymptoms compatible with drug -induced liver injury  during the study , patients will be 
instructed to return to the study  center for a n unscheduled visit or to go to the emergency  room to 
measure liver enzy mes as soon as possible. Solitary  elevations of total or direct bilirubin , not 
accompanied b y elevations of ALT or AST should be managed according to the discretion of the 
treating ph ysician.
Elevation of Either ALT or AST to ≥3× ULN
Confirmation is required prior to study  drug discontinuation in cases of elevation of either ALT 
or AST ≥3× ULN (Note: In cases of elevation of AL T or AST ≥8× the ULN, no confirmation is 
required prior to study  drug discontinuation, but the assessments below should be performed). 
The following procedures should be followed:
The day in which the abnormal value is received from the laboratory  will be 
considered as day  0.
The investigator should repeat the test for confirmation purposes (this may  be 
performed in a local laboratory  along with complete blood count [CBC] and 
differential to assess for eosinophilia. I n general, in case a blood sample is sent to a 
local laboratory , the following assessments [and refe rence ranges] are mandatory : 
ALT [serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase], AST [serum glutamic oxaloacetic 
transaminase], AL P, total anddirect bilirubin , CBC [with differential for eosinophil 
count, separate tube], and INR [separate tube; not to be sent in a confirmatory  test]). 
The investigator should also question the patient regarding s ymptoms.
The abnormalit y will be regarded as confirmed in each of the following scenarios:
the baseline value was within the normal range and AL T or AST is still ≥3× the ULN
the baseline value was above the ULN and ALT or AST is ≥2× the baseline value
                                                
1Thorough medical history with a focus on liver disease: personal or family his tory of liver disease; personal history 
of a systemic disease with potential liver involvement; exposure to alcoho l, medications (prescription or 
over-the-counter), herbal preparations, dietary supplements, recreational drugs, special diets ,orenvironmental 
chemical agents; potential exposure to infectious agents (eg, travel to developing countries, history of potential 
exposure to blood or blood products, high -risk sexual relations) ;and any ad ditional information deemed relevant 
by the investigator. Physical examination, including signs of chronic liver disease .

Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS-30050
163Additional Tests/Evaluations:
Upon confirmation of the abnormality  as noted above, the followin g additional evaluations 
should be performed and results should be recorded in the CRF:
serology for hepatitis A (antibody  and immunoglobulin M [IgM] and IgG), B (core 
antibody total, core IgM, and surface antigen), and C viruses (central laboratory )
serology for autoimmune hepatitis: anti -nuclear antibodies (titer), anti- smooth muscle 
antibodies, and anti- liver kidney  microsomal antibodies (central laboratory ); further 
testing may  be required in case of a positive result for hepatitis B or C
ultrasound examination of the liver and biliary  tract at the investigator’s discretion
other diagnostic tests/consultations as deemed necessary  by the investigator 
(eg,serology for hepatitis E virus in case of travel to endemic geography )
observation and follow -up (to be performed after the abnormalit y was confirmed as 
above)
ALT or AST ≥3× (>3.5× the ULN if the Baseline Value Is >2.5× the ULN) but Less Than 5× 
the ULN
In addition to the above procedures required for any  elevation to levels >3× the ULN:
Alanine aminotransferase, AST, GGT, ALP, total and direct bilirubin, CBC an d 
differential (to assess for eosinophilia), and INR should be monitored on day s 5 
(±2days), 8 (±2 day s), 14(±3days), and 28 (±3 day s). On at least 1 of these day s, the 
test should be performed centrall y. (The INR should be sent to a local laboratory 
only.)
In cases where a local laboratory  is used, the results should be recorded in the CRF, 
accompanied b y the reference range of the relevant measurements.
Should the abnormality  (≥3× the ULN in case baseline was within the normal range 
or ≥2×the ULN in case the baseline value was above ULN but still <5× the ULN) 
persist further, the patient will be followed according to the investigator’s discretion, 
but a blood sample for ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, and total and direct bilirubin should 
be sent to the central laboratory  at least once a month.
ALT or AST ≥5× but Less Than 8× the ULN
In addition to the above procedures required for any  elevation to levels >3× the ULN:
Alanine aminotransferase, AST, GGT, ALP, total and direct bilirubin, CBC and 
differential count (to assess for eosinophilia), and INR should be monitored twice a 
week.
At least for every  other measurement, the tests should be sent to the central 
laboratory . The rest of the tests may  be sent to a local laboratory . The INR should 
always be sent to a local laboratory .

164ALT or AST ≥8× the ULN
In addition to the above procedures required for any  elevation to levels >3× the ULN:
The study  drug should be discontinued immediately , and the early  withdrawal visit 
should be performed.
For follow -up guidance, please see below secti on “Follow -Up of Liver Enzy mes 
After Stopping Rules Are Met.”
Stopping Rules
In the following circumstances, the stud y drug will be discontinued immediately:
any increase in ALT or AST to ≥3× the ULN, combined with I NR >1.5× the ULN or 
total bilirubin >2× the ULN
any increase in ALT or AST to ≥3× the ULN, which is accompanied b y symptoms 
clearly associated with impaired liver function (eg, vomiting, nausea, fever, rash, 
eosinophilia) and not deemed related to other diseases (eg, vomiting or nausea 
triggered bymigraine)
any increase in ALT or AST to levels ≥5 but <8× the ULN, which is persistent for 
≥2weeks of repeated measurements
any increase in ALT or AST to levels ≥8× the ULN
in any case where monitoring of liver enzy mes cannot be performed according to the 
protocol guidance
Follow-Up of Liver Enzymes After Stopping Rules Are Met
A patient who meets the above criteria for discontinuation of the study  drug should be 
invited to the site to return the study  drug. Earl y withdrawal visit activities should be 
performed as soon as possible.
Liver enzy mes should be monitored until normalization or stabilization of the 
abnormality , according to the discretion of the investigator.
In any case, following the earl y withdrawal visit, the minimal follow -up period will 
be 30 day s and will include measurement of liver enzy mes at least once weekly  (may 
be performed in local laboratory , with at least 1 test being sent to the central 
laboratory ).
Every effort should be made to complete the additional tests/evaluations, as de scribed 
above.

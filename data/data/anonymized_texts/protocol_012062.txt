 Is the rationale for the study clearly stated and is the rationale scientifically 6 
sound?  7 
 8 
The emerging evidence of the relationship between working memory (WM) and naming 9 
offers a unique opportunity to investigate the effects of upregulation of WM systems and the 10 
effect on naming in nonfluent aphasia. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tD CS) is a 11 
non-invasive neuromodulation tool that presents a low current that induces bi -directional 12 
polarity -dependent changes in the cortex to facilitate focal, prolonged shifts in cortical 13 
excitability at or around the time stimulation is provided 1, 2. Anodal tDCS (a -tDCS), in which 14 
the positively charged electrode is placed over the targeted cortical region, has been shown 15 
to increase cortical excitability (upregulation), similar to long -term potentiation (LTP)1-5. 16 
Combining a -tDCS with behavioral -based approaches has been suggested to enhance the 17 
learning process and increase the likelihood of retention6.  Although the re is no specific 18 
neurophysiologic evidence to identify suppression of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) 19 
in pa rticipants with aphasia, it has been implicated in naming deficits due to its role in 20 
working memory. tDCS has been applied to the DLPFC to t arget working memory7-10, to 21 
date,  there have been no investigations using a-tDCS to the DLPFC to  influence naming 22 
skills in non-fluent aphasia. The overarching goal of this study is to explore the relationship 23 
between WM and naming by investigating the effects of a -tDCS to left DLPFC on naming 24 
accuracy and naming reaction times (RTs) in non -fluent aphasia. The primary purpose of this 25 
study is to 1) establish feasibility and safety of applying a -tDCS to the left DLPFC in patients 26 
with Broca’s aphasia combined with behavioral naming treatment.   27 
 Are the aims and corresponding hypothesis clearly stated?  28 
 29 
Aim 1:  Determine  feasibility and safety of ap plying a -tDCS to the left DLPFC in Broca’s aphasia. 30 
Two conditions: 1) a-tDCS (2mA for 20 minutes) will be applied over the left DLPFC followed 31 
immediately by behavioral naming therapy  and 2) sham tDCS followed immediately by 32 
behavioral naming therapy will be presented to participants with non -fluent aphasia .  Hypothesis 33 
1: no adverse events will be reported during or following this treatment  and all participants will 34 
complete the study .   35 
 36 
Aim 2: Identify effectiveness of a -tDCS to the left DLPFC combined with behavioral naming 37 
treatment in Broca’s aphasia and e stablish a sample  size for future investigations of this nature. 38 
A small sample size will be used in this study to investigate effectiveness  of the use of a -tDCS 39 
to the left DLPFC with behavioral therapy to target naming in non -fluent aphasia. Hypothesis 2:  40 
Improvements in working memory, naming reaction time and naming accuracy will be observed 41 
after the real a -tDCS condition but  not after the sham a -tDCS condition.  42 
 43 
 44 
3 
  Is the primary outcome (and secondary outcomes, as appropriate) clearly 1 
defined?  2 
Primary outcomes include: naming accuracy on treated and control items, naming RTs  on 3 
treated and control i tems,  performance on WM tasks , and motor speech tasks .    4 
 Are there adequate preliminary data in the literature (or from the investigator) to 5 
justify the proposed research? Has an adequate literature review been done to 6 
support this study?  7 
 8 
WM systems are short -term, temporary stores that are activated when active manipulation of 9 
items is necessary20.   It could be argued that all linguistic tasks invoke WM systems since the 10 
execution of any linguistic task requires the ability to maintain acti vation of a representation until 11 
the targeted linguistic process is complete.  Indeed, the close relationship between language 12 
and WM is represented in many WM models11-13.  Over the past few decades, there has been 13 
increasing recognition that aphasia is fre quently accompanied by deficits in WM systems.  14 
Furthermore, such deficits adversely impact linguistic performance in aphasia.  Accordingly, 15 
treatment protocols are being developed on the premise that treatments aimed at improving WM 16 
systems will improve l inguistic function in aphasia14, 15.  While a variety of WM treatment 17 
protocols have been designed to improve linguistic processes such as oral reading, repetition, 18 
or comprehension abilities in aphasia, there  are no such studies in the area of naming.  Yet, one 19 
particular WM component, subvocal rehearsal processes11, 16, may play a crucial role in naming 20 
abilities in aphasia.  Subvocal rehearsal processes are activated when verbal memory traces  21 
must be refreshed.  Such processes become vital in cue -based protocols17-21 where the 22 
individual is asked to self -generate cues needed to increase lexical acc ess to the object name. 23 
Within this context, it may be that subvocal rehearsal systems might be crucial during picture 24 
naming processes as it functions to preserve and refresh information, facilitating convergence of 25 
activation onto targeted representation s. This becomes a useful compensatory strategy when 26 
there are lexical access and retrieval failures. However, the ability to engage in subvocal 27 
rehearsal processes are likely deficient in individuals with aphasia14 15, which impacts not only 28 
immediate treatment effects, but also long -term treatment effects since cue self -generation as a 29 
compensatory strategy would be  limited.   30 
The application of a -tDCS to the language regions in combination with behavioral -based 31 
approaches has resulted in improved language outcomes in individuals with aphasia 22-26. In 32 
addition, a -tDCS applied to the left DLPFC  has resulted in improved performance on WM tasks 33 
in healthy individuals 27, individuals with Parkinson’s Disease 7 and stroke 28. a-tDCS is ideally 34 
suited to upregulate the left DLPFC and may potentially activate subvocal rehearsal processes 35 
needed in order to improve self -generation of cues during naming. However, there have been 36 
no investigations to date using neuromodulation techniques to the DLPFC to target naming 37 
skills in ap hasia.  38 
 39 
 Is the question or hypothesis being tested providing important knowledge to the 40 
field?  41 
 42 
The findings from the proposed study will lay the foundation for a larger clinical trial which will 43 
in turn have a significant impact on individuals with aphasia given that naming deficits are a 44 
common symptom in this population. As the presence of naming deficits has a negative 45 
relationship to emotional well -being and functional communication 29-33, treatme nt that 46 
improves naming deficits will positively influence quality of life in many of these individuals.  47 
The approach taken to remediate naming deficits in aphasia is to treat impaired WM systems 48 
4 
 on the premise t hat certain cognitive processes underlie li nguistic functions in aphasia.  This 1 
approach represents a departure from most behavioral -based naming treatment approach es, 2 
but reflects a growing recognition that WM systems in individuals with aphasia impact 3 
linguistic performance 14, 34.  The addition of a -tDCS as a neuromodulation tool to increase 4 
cortical excitability (upregulate) the working memory center to target naming is a novel 5 
approach  in aphasia .  These findings, , will provide valuable information regarding the role 6 
WM plays in naming and the potential benefit of using neuromodulation to the DLPFC to 7 
influence naming in aphasia.    8 
 9 
 Is the design of the study appropriate for the questions that are posed?  10 
 11 
Treatment Design:   12 
A single subject cross -over design with a 4 week wash out period will be used. Two treatment 13 
conditions will be presented.  The sham (SHAM) condition will consist of presentation of sham 14 
tDCS for 20 minutes followed by behavioral naming treatment. The rea l treatment condition 15 
(REAL) will consist of 20 minutes of a -tDCS to the left DLPFC followed by behavioral naming 16 
treatment. The length of behavioral naming treatment will depend on how long each participant 17 
takes to go through the treatment stimul i twice.  A SHAM -REAL sequence will be used across all 18 
participants . Although order effects may be introduced using the same sequence across 19 
participants, the small number of participants makes it difficult to interpret any data that comes 20 
from using a counterbalan ced presentation of treatment.    21 
Treatment will be provid ed over five consecutive days. A minimum of a one -month washout 22 
period will be provided between the two conditions ( Figure 1).  Prior to initiating the REAL 23 
treatment  condition, the naming RTs obtain ed on the second word list during the pre-treatment 24 
testing period (pri or to the initiation of the SHAM  condition) will be compared to the nam ing RTs 25 
obtained after the  washout pe riod.  RTs will be analyzed to e nsure that no lasting treatment 26 
effects remai n after the  SHAM  condition.  If performance on naming RTs is +/- 1 standard 27 
deviation from the individual’s benchmark mean, the REAL treatment condition will begin. If 28 
performance on naming RTs is > +/ - 1 standard deviation from the individual’s benchmark 29 
mean, REAL treatment will be postponed until the mean RTs fall within +/ - 1 standard deviation 30 
of the benchmark. Periodic checks will be conducted weekly  to identify wh en to begin REAL 31 
condition .  Once there are  minimal differences between naming RTs o n the second word list, 32 
the REAL  treatment will be initiated.   33 
 34 
Outcome measures :   35 
Two different word lists will be generated;  a different list will be used for each treatment 36 
condition to control for exposure and learning effect.Pretreatment testing  outcome measures  will 37 
be recorded  for 5 consecutive days  for each outcome measure including: 1) naming accu racy 2) 38 
naming RTs  on both word lists 3) performance on motor speech tasks and 4) performance on 39 
working memory tasks. Stability of baseline performance, defined as no more than 20% 40 
difference between scores, will be obtained in five consecutive sessions.  In addition, outcome 41 
measures  will be  obtained immediately after each treatment session . Five maintenance 42 
outcome measures  will also be obtained  upon completion of treatment. These sessions will take 43 
place at  the Clinical Translational Science Institute  (CTSI ) on Delaware Street on the Univer sity 44 
of MN campus . An adverse events questionnarie will also be given after each treatment session 45 
as a mechanism of participants reporting any discomfort.    46

tDCS Protocol.    6 
Treatment sessions will take place at the University of MN Clinical Translational Science 7 
Institute .   Each participant will be seated comfortably in a chair. A swim cap will be placed on 8 
the participant’s head to identify cranial landmarks for accurate electrode placement. The area 9 
referred to as F3 by the International 10/20 system for electroencephalogram electrode 10 
placement35 has been established as the optimal locatio n for targeting the left DLPFC8, 9, 28, 36. 11 
The F3 region will be located by marking the vertex (the  midpoint between left and right tragus 12 
and midpoint between nasion and inion), measuring the head circumference. When these 13 
measurements are entered into the Beam F3 Locator Software37, additional values are provided 14 
to reliably identify the location of F3. Once F3 has been established, two saline soaked surface 15 
sponge electrodes (352cm) will be prepare d and placed. For optimal anodal stimulation to the 16 
DLPFC, the anode will be placed over F3 and the cathode will be placed over the right 17 
supraorbital region7-9, 27. A current of 2mA will be delivered for 20 minutes 7 by a multichannel 18 
transcranial current stimulator (Starstim, Neuroelectrics Corporation; Cambridge, MA). a -tDCS 19 
will be applied before and during behavioral treatment in the design specified below.  20

Stimuli.  Eighty black -and-white line drawings will be obtained from on -line clip art websites.  27 
Picture names will be normed using five to ten English -speaking volunteers who will be asked to 28 
provide the names of the pictures.  Cues words will be paired wi th the pictures if the words 29 
represent an associative or thematic relationship.  Therefore, the words will be chosen that 30 
represent a concrete attribute (e.g., the picture, SHARK, is paired with the cue word teeth ), 31 
location (e.g., the picture, SHARK, is p aired with the cue word ocean ), and either function or 32 
category (e.g., the picture, SHARK, is paired with the cue word, fish).  The selection criteria for 33 
choosing these particular attributes is based on a classification criteria of thematic relations 38.  34 
Moreover, there is empirical evidence that that associative relations would prove beneficial in a 35 
naming treatment paradigm 39.  Commonly used phrases (e.g., great white shark ) or compound 36 
words (e.g., bluefin shark ), synonyms or antonyms  will be excluded .  These cue words will be 37 
obtained  from a semantic features normative database 40, which provides not only semantic 38 Pretreatment

 features informa tion but categorical information as well.   Two lists of 20 -items will be created, 1 
which will be presented to each participant in order to avoid presenting the same list across the 2 
conditions.  Pictures used in both lists will be balanced in terms of visua l complexity and 3 
familiarity ratings.  Words used in all conditions will be balanced in terms of lexical frequency 4 
and word length.  Familiarity ratings will be obtained from a normative database40.  Visual 5 
complexity ratings will be also obtained from a group of 20 individuals using the instruc tions and 6 
rating scales as reported in Snodgrass and Vanderwart’s41 article.  The CELEX database 42, will 7 
be consulted to determi ne lexical frequency of the words (cues) used in the study.  An additional 8 
40 pictures will be selected for a control (untreated) list that will be used only during baseline 9 
and post -treatment testing.  Performance on treated and untreated lists will be co mpared to 10 
determine treatment effects and possible generalization effects.   11 
 12 
Naming Treatment Procedures.   All participants will be provided the same protocol, which will 13 
highlight the process of rehearsing the cues associated with the picture name.  Treatment 14 
sessions will last until each participant has gone through the treated items twice.  To insure 15 
control during the protocol, a graduate student trained in the protocol will administer the 16 
treatment steps.  She will be blinded to the objectives of the study and conditions that are being 17 
administered. Treatment sessions will be video recorded for reliability purposes. To insure that 18 
she is not aware of when tDCS is being administered, a screen will be in place between the 19 
tDCS machine and the treatme nt table.  The protocol is provided in Table  1.   20 
 21 
Table 1 .  Naming Treatment Protocol.  22 
Steps Involved in Naming Treatment Protocol  
Picture Presentation  Participant will be asked to name the picture.  If she/he is 
unable to provide the name within 10 seco nds, the name 
will be provided.   
Cue Presentation  Cues that accompany the picture will be presented. He/she 
will be asked to rea d each cue word as it is presented.  If 
he/she is unable to read the word spontaneously  within 10 
seconds , he/she will be asked to repeat each word after the 
clinician.  
Cue Rehearsal  Both picture and cues are taken away.  Participant is asked 
to rehearse the cue words silently for 10 seconds.  
Cue Self -Generation  Participant will be asked to generate all three cues.  For 
each instance that the participant is unable to provide a cue  
within 10 seconds , the cues will be provided.  Once the 
cues have been provided, the participant will then be asked 
to provide the picture name.  
Picture + Cue Presentation  If the participant is  unable to provide the name, the cues 
will be read, or if he/she is unable to read spontaneously, 
he/she will be asked to repeat after the clinician.  If she/he 
is still unable to provide the picture name after the cue 
review, it will be provided.  
Picture  + Cue Review  Once the cues and picture are laid out on the table, the 
clinician will  read each cue and name the picture. The 
participant will be encouraged to read/repeat with the 
clinician.

 Have the validity and reliability of measures been established or are there 2 
methods proposed for establishing validity and reliability?  3 
 4 
Approximately 20% of each of the participant’s behavioral treatment sessions will be 5 
observed by the co-investigator in order to obtain procedural integrity.  Steps of th e treatment 6 
protocol will be scored using a binary (+/ -) coding system.  Point -by-point agreement will be 7 
obtained.  Reliability in scoring naming error types will also be obtained using a table that 8 
lists the most common aphasic naming errors, definitions  and examples of each error type.  9 
Point -by-point agreement will be obtained.  10 
 11 
 Is the proposed subject population appropriate?  12 
Participants will be recruited via emails sent to Twin Cities metro area hospital and 13 
aphasia/stroke support groups.  Potential participants will then be screened for eligibility for 14 
the study.  15 
Screening. Potential p articipants will be seen for 2 -3 sessions to undergo comprehensive 16 
cognitive -linguistic assessment to determine eligibility for the study. This assessment will 17 
take pla ce within the participant’s home to provide a comfortable, natural environment for the 18 
potential participant.  Behavioral assessment measures will include  the Western Aphasia 19 
Battery ( WAB ) 43 which will be used to obtain overall language function via the  WAB Aphasia 20 
Quotient (WAB AQ), the Boston Naming Test (BNT) in order to obtain naming function, 44, 21 
Apraxia Battery for Adults (ABA -2) 45 in order to determine apraxia of speech severity,  and 22 
working memory tasks to determine subvocal rehearsal processes and phonological short - 23 
term store abilities.  24 
These participants must meet the following inclusionar y criteria : 25 
 a diagnosis of moderate -moderately severe non -fluent apha sia based on 26 
performance on the WAB   (see above screening proce dures).  27 
 a diagnosis of moderate -moderately severe non -fluent aphasia based on 28 
performance on the BNT (see above screening procedures).  29 
 a diagnosis of mild -moderate apraxia of speech (AoS)  based on performance on the 30 
ABA-2 (see above screening procedures).  31 
 completion of high school or GED  32 
 normal or corrected -to-normal vision  33 
 adequate hearing acuity for 1:1 conversational exchanges  34 
 use of Engl ish as primary language  35 
 a vascular lesion in the dominant left hemisphere , not in the region of the DLPFC  36 
verified by an MRI scan within six months of the start of the study.  37 
These participants must also meet the following exclusionary criteria:  38 
 39 
 no previ ous history of neurological - or psychiatric -based illnesses or disease, 40 
language or learning disabilities, or alcohol/substance abuse  41 
 no history of seizures  42 
 no metal implants in the head (except dental fillings)  43 
 no lesion in the left DLPFC confirmed by MRI  44 
8 
  no current pregnancy  1 
 2 
Individuals who meet the inclusionary/ex clusionary criteria and who are still interested in 3 
participating will then be consented to participate in the research study . After four 4 
participants have been identified as eligible and consented for the study, recruitment will 5 
stop.  6 
 Are statistical considerations, including sample size and justification, estimated 7 
accrual and duration, and statistical analysis clearly describe d and adequate to 8 
meet the study objectives?  9 
 10 
Descriptive statistics such as naming percent accuracy, range of naming percent accuracy, 11 
number of cues generated independently, and rates of naming errors, will be collected. Although 12 
normally distributed dat a is not expected in this small sample size and in this population of 13 
participants, a Shapiro -Wilk test of normal distribution will be conducted to report the 14 
distribution. Single subject analysis techniques will be used such as visual inspection, graphica l 15 
analysis and confidence interval comparison.  16 
 17 
Aim 1 . To address the feasibility and safety aim, t he number and type of adverse events for 18 
each patient will be recorded and presented . In addition, t he number of participants who  failed 19 
to complete  the stu dy will be recorded and factors recorded. To the extent possible, the 20 
participants will be asked to continue to participate in the assessments to allow a consideration 21 
of intent to treat analysis.   22 
 23 
Aim 2 . Means and 95% confidence intervals will be plotted and used for comparison of naming 24 
RTs, working memory performance and motor speech performance  across treatment conditions 25 
for each subject (Deng, et al. 2013).   Naming accuracy performance will be analyz ed using  d 26 
statistics  for lexical  data to determine magnitude of treatment  effect  46, 47. The effect size will be 27 
interpreted using benchmarks proposed by Beeson and Robey (2006) for lexical retrieval 28 
treatments:  small ES = 4.0, medium ES = 7.0, large ES = 10.146.  Naming RT mean and 29 
confidence intervals will be analyzed for changes within and across treatment conditions using 30 
visual inspection.   31 
 32 
 Are all the proposed tests or measurements requested necessary to answer the 33 
scientific question?  34 
Yes.  T he proposed measures will allow investigators to report the  feasibility  and safety  of 35 
the use of a -tDCS The measures will also allow investigators to identify individual treatment 36 
effects of a-tDCS to left DPFC combined with behavioral naming therapy on naming in non- 37 
fluent aphasia and through visual inspection and graphical analysis, compare effects to sham  38 
treatment. Naming RT and accuracy are sensitive  measure s of the participant’s retr ieval and 39 
learning of treated items. Motor speech performance  will allow us to track changes in motor 40 
planning and sequencing abilities, which can influence naming RT and na ming accuracy. 41 
And, performance on working memory tasks will allow for investigation of the influence of 42 
WM on naming and to provide additional evidence that a -tDCS to the left DLPFC may 43 
influence WM in individual participants.   44 
 45 
 Are the investigators well qualified to conduct this study?  46

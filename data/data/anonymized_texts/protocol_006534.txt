John Eaton, PI   CONFIDENTIAL  1 Introduction  
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study.  This study will be carried out in accordance with the applicable United States  government regulations and Mayo Clinic  research 
policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background 
 
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic, fibro- inflammatory, cholestatic liver disease 
affecting  approximately 25,000 adolescents and adults in the United States and a major 
indication for liver transplantation (LT) .
1-3  PSC leads to end -stage cirrhosis, represents a 
foremost risk factor for CCA, and carries a median LT -free survival of only 12 years.4-7  The 
etiopathogenesis of PSC is unknown, and despite trials of n early 20 different 
immunosuppressants and other agents, safe and effective pharmacotherapy has yet to be established .
2  Unlike in other cholestatic liver diseases (e.g. primary biliary cirrhosis), treatment 
with ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA) has not been clearly shown to have a beneficial effect in 
PSC.  In addition, high doses of UDCA have been associated with sig nificantly greater adverse 
outcomes.  Although operative treatment with liver transplantation (LT) is effective for PSC, it is available in limited specialty centers and only an option in select patients; even in suitable LT candidates, however, PSC and CC A can recur post -LT.
8-10  Therefore, given the morbidity and 
mortality of PSC and the challenges associated with operative treatment, safe and effective pharmacotherapy is critically needed.  Furthermore, the negative results of previous clinical trials highlight the need to consider targeting alternative pathophysiologic pathways.  
 Curcumin, the principal curcuminoid of the rhizome turmeric  (Curcuma longa) , is a naturally 
occurring compound with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, among other potentially 
therapeutic effects .
11-16  In a recent study of the mdr2 knockout murine model of PSC, it was 
shown that as little as 4 weeks of oral curc umin treatment resulted in a significant decrease in 
serum liver enzymes as well as histologic disease, including sclerosing cholangitis, ductular proliferation, and fibrosis, all of which are pathologic hallmarks of PSC.
17, 18  Furthermore, 
curcumin has been shown to decrease cholangiocyte  (i.e. biliary epithelial cell) reactivity as well 
as hepatic myofibroblast activation  (i.e. pro -fibrogenic function), both of which are key 
phenomena in the pathogenesis of PSC.17, 18  Therefore, there is promising animal model and 
cultured human cell line evidence that curcumin may represent a safe, effective, and low -cost 
therapy for patients with PSC.  
1.2 Investigational Agent 
 Curcumin is an orange-red powder that is a mixture of 3 compounds— curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemothyxcurcumin.    Forty  to eighty- five percent of an oral dose of curcumin passes through the gastrointestinal tract 
unchanged.  T he bioavailability of curcumi n is greatest in the colon.  Hexahydrocurcuminol i s 
the major biotransformed metabolite of curcumin.  The major biliary metabolites are tetrahydrocurcumin and hexahydrocurcumin.   
Curcumin pilot study   1/3/2018, V ersion 7

John Eaton, PI   CONFIDENTIAL   
Curcumin has been shown in a growing number of in vitro  and in vivo  studies to demonstrate 
biological activity with a variety of potentially medicinal applications, e.g. anti-inflammatory , 
anti-oxidant, and chemopreventive (i.e. anti- cancer) .11-16  In clinical studies, it is generally 
administered orally in capsule form, 2-3 times per day.  
1.3 Preclinical Data  
 
Emerging insights into the etiopathogenesis of and potential therapeuti c approaches for PSC 
have been facilitated  by the growing use of relevant animal models, particularly the mdr2 
knockout mouse.
19, 20  Indeed, recent experimental evidence from this model has demonstrated 
that as little as 4 weeks of treatment with the naturally -occurring compound curcumin results in a 
significant reduction of serum liver enzymes as well as histologic disease, including sclerosing cholangitis, ductular proliferation, and fibrosis (i.e. pathologic hallm arks of PSC).
17  In addition 
to the promising mdr2 knockout mouse model data, curcumin has been shown in vitro  to 
decrease insult -induced human cholangiocyte reactivity (a characteristic feature in PSC 
cholangiocytes),2, 17, 21 attenuate human myofibroblast activation (manifested classically in PSC 
as peri -ductal “onionskin” fibrosis ),17, 22 and suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis of 
human CCA cells (which could serve a vital chemopreventive role in PSC patients).2, 23, 24  
Curcumin may also confer therapeutic benefits in PSC patients through other mechanisms, including its antimicrobial activity,
16, 25 as microbiota have been implicated in the pathogenesis 
of PSC, and indeed 70% of patients with PSC have inflammatory bowel disease, a disorder associated with enteric microbial dysbiosis.
2, 26-28 
1.4 Clinical Data to Date 
 Curcumin has demonstrat ed high tolerability , safety, and efficacy  in multiple studies including 
randomized controlled trials involving healthy individuals as well as patients with a variety of hepatic and non-hepatic inflammatory, degenerative, malignant, neuropsychiatric, and other illnesses .
11-15, 29-35  Collectively, these studies have demonstrated anti -inflammatory, 
hepatoprotective, anti -fibrotic, immunomodulatory, and anti- carcinogenic activities of curcumin.  
No significant toxicity has been reported following either acute or chronic administration of turmeric extracts at standard doses.  In a mi nority of patients, mild side -effects as nausea, 
diarrhea, headache, somnolence, and contact dermatitis (with topical use) have been reported.
11-
15, 29, 30 
 
1.5 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits 
In this pilot study, patients will receive 1500 mg of highly bioavailable BCM-95 curcumin®, which is supplied in one 750 mg CuraMed® softgel (EuroPharma, Inc.), to be taken orally twice a day for 12 weeks.  Each softgel contains 500 mg of pure, highly bioavailable curcuminoids.  This dose and route is based on recent published clinical trials, wherein curcumin  has been found 
to be well -tolerat ed, safe, and efficacious in inflammatory and other disorders.
12, 31-33, 35   
Although previous studies have studied twice and three times a day regimens, we have chosen to 
Curcumin pilot study   1/3/2018, V ersion 7  
  
Page 8 of 22 
John Eaton, PI   CONFIDENTIAL  pursue the former given convenience and ease of adherence for patients and lack of inferiority 
data with this dosing re gimen.  
 As described above, serious adverse effects have not been reported with even high doses (e.g. 10x higher than those used herein) of curcumin.
14, 29   Mild adverse effects have been reported, 
however these have been uncommon and resolved with curcumin dose reduction or discontinuation.
11-15, 29, 30, 36   These effects have included: yellow stool, diarrhea, headache, rash, 
increase in ALK or lactate dehydrogenase. ) 
  
2 Study Objectives  
Primary Objective: to determine the change in serum Alkaline Phosphatase following 12 weeks of curcumin treatment as a biomarker of therapeutic efficacy .   
 Secondary Objective: to determine: 1) change in serum AST, total bilirubin, albumin, C -reactive 
protein, and Mayo PSC risk score following 12 weeks of curcumin treatment compared to baseline values  as markers of biochemical improvement; 2) change in s elf-reported  health status, 
fatigue severity, and pruritus (as assessed by standardized questionnaires) following 12 weeks of treatment comp ared to baseline values  as markers of symptomatic improvement, and 3) the 
adverse events occurring during 12 weeks of curcumin treatment  in patients with PSC . 
 
3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
 We propose to conduct an open- label pilot study to preliminarily assess the efficacy and safety of 
oral curcumin in adult patients with PSC.  Fifteen  patients with PSC will receive one 750 mg 
CuraMed® softgel (EuroPharma, Inc.) by mouth twice a day for 12 weeks.  Of note, each 750 mg C uraMed® softgel supplies 500 mg of highly bioavailable BCM -95 curcumin.  A positive 
study, based on significant improvement in serum liver biochemistries, will establish the basis for further evaluation of curcumin in a larger, longer- term clinical trial.   
 Table 1 in section 6 summarizes the patient evaluation and study procedures.  Briefly, prior to study entry, a complete history will be obtained and physical examination performed.  Serum Alkaline  Phosphatase , AST, total bilirubin, albumin, C -reactive protein, complete blood count, 
and creatinine will be measured.  A blood pregnancy test will be performed on female patients  of 
child bearing potential .  Standardized questionnaires regarding health status (SF -36 Health 
Survey and Chronic Liver Disease Que stionnaires), fatigue (Fisk Fatigue Impact Scale) and 
pruritus (5 -D Pruritus scale) will be completed by participants at baseline and at 12 weeks.  
Phone calls will be made to participants weekly during the study, at completion of the study (i.e. at 12 weeks of therapy)  and/or early termination, and at two weeks after completion of the study 
to monitor for any adverse events or effects of the study drug .  Study staff will specifically 
inquire about local and systemic adverse effects including gastrointestin al upset, nausea, 
diarrhea , signs of anemia (e.g., weakness, fatigue) , and rash; during weekly phone or in person

development of any possible symptoms related to ther apy. 
 
3.2 Primary Study Endpoints  
 
The primary study endpoint in this study will be treatment success, as determined by  the 
proportion of PSC patients who experience clinically significant improvement in Alkaline Phosphatase, as defined by: 1) a ≥40% reduction  in serum Alkaline Phosphatase (as compared to 
baseline value)
37 or  2) a decreas e in serum Alkaline Phosphatase to less than 1.5 times the upper 
limit of normal following 12 weeks of curcumin treatment.38   
 Notably, serum A lkaline Phosphatase  values have been repeatedly  associated with disease 
response and prognosis,
39-41 thus this readi ly measured biochemical test is an  important endpoint 
and biomarker in studies of patients with PSC.  
 
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
 
Secondary efficacy endpoints will include  change in : 1) serum AST, total bilirubin, albumin, C -
reactive protein, and Mayo PSC risk score42 following 12 weeks of curcumin treatment compared 
to baseline values  as markers of biochemical improvement and  2) change in s elf-reported  health 
status, fatigue severity, and pruritus (as assessed by standardized questionnaires) following 12 weeks of treatment compared to baseline values  as markers of symptomatic improvement.  
 
3.4 Primary Safety Endpoints 
 
We will monitor for adverse events occurring during 12 weeks of curcumin treatment as part of this study.  In addition, occurrence of any of the following will be considered a treatment failure:  
• Deterioration of liver biochemistries (doubling of bilirubin and/or increase in AST, ALT, 
and alkaline phosphatase levels ≥ 3x upper limit o f normal or baseline levels without 
mechanical obstruction) 
• Voluntary drug/study discontinuation for any reason (e.g. worsening of fatigue or pruritus 
or development of diarrhea, headache, nausea, or rash) 
• Death 
• Liver transplantation

John Eaton, PI   CONFIDENTIAL  Patients with a diagnosis of PSC will be recruited by the study staff in  the Division of 
Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Mayo Clinic ) and enrolled in the study if satisfying the 
above inclusion and exclusion criteria.  A total of 15 patients will be enrolled.  
 
4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects 
 
Study participants  may decide to withdraw from the study at any time; in such case, they will be 
asked to notify the study team so that they may be advised as to whether any  additional tests may 
be needed  to be performed  for their  safety.   Study investigators may withdraw participants from 
the study at any  time if it is co nsidered in a patient’s  best interest  or if a patient does  not follow 
the study protocol.  Additional details are provided below. 
 
4.4.1 When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
 
Participants will be withdrawn from the study if they experience a CTCAE 4.0 criteria grad e 3 or 
higher adverse event , are unable to adhere to the study protocol, inadvertently become pregnant 
during the study (in which case they will be referred to their primary physician  for obstetric 
care), or experience treatment failure as described in section 3.4 above.    Participants may voluntary withdraw from the study for any reason.  Patients who withdraw from the study (or decline participation) will not be penalized in any way.  Specifically, they  do not 
have to be in this study to receive or continue to receive medical care from Mayo Clinic.    
4.4.2 Data Collection and Follow- up for Withdrawn Subjects  
 
Patients who withdraw from (or complete) the study will be followed for a minimum of 2 weeks (to ensure safety) as part of the study in addition to longitudinal routine clinical care.  
 
5 Study Drug  
5.1 Description  
 The study drug will be administered in the form of a capsule (softgel).

7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
 
Approximately 5% of patients with PSC and chronically (>6 months) elevated ALK will 
spontaneously experience either a clinically significant reduction in serum ALK to less ≤ 1.5 
times the upper limit of normal38 or a reductio n of > 40% of the baseline ALK value .37  In this 
open- label pilot study, our  prim ary objective is to determine the proportion of patients who 
experience curcumin treatment success, as defined by either of these two ALK endpoints.  Notably ; these patients are hereinafter consider ed historical controls.
39  Therefore, if treatment 
success is achieved in at least 30% of curcumin treated patients, i.e. a rate that is at least 25% more than the conservative estimate in historical controls, likely based on pre -clinical data, and 
clinically promising, this would encourage further study of curcumin in larger, randomized 
clinical trials in patients with PSC.   
  
By enrolling 15 patients with PSC in our study, an exact binomial test with a nominal two -sided 
significance level of α=0.05 will have approximately 90% power to detect a 25% difference in 
clinically significant ALK improvement between the null hypothesis of 5% (historical control) and the alternative hypothesis of  30%.  In addition, if 6 of 20 PSC patients (30%) experience 
treatment success, the 95% exact binomial confidence interval (CI) would be 11.9% to 54.3%, suggesting that the sample size has adequate precision to not include the null hypothesis (5%) in the C I. 
 
7.2 Statistical Methods  
 
Univariate descriptive statistics and frequency distributions will be calculated, as appropriate , for 
all variables.  Baseline values for demographic, clinical, and outcome variables (primary and secondary) will be tabulated.  These analyses will help identify potential confounding variables to be used as covariates in advanced statistical (e.g. multivariate) analyses.  Bonferroni correction will be used to adjust p-values in the case of multiple comparisons.  
7.3 Subject Population(s) for Analysis  
 
Curcumin pilot study   1/3/2018, V ersion 7  
  
Page 17 of 22 
John Eaton, PI   CONFIDENTIAL  The study participants whose data will be subjected to data analysis include:  
• All-treated population:  Any s ubject entered into the study that received at least one dose 
of study drug. 
• All-completed population:  Only subjects who completed all study related procedures and 
follow-up will be included  
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Adverse e vents and study discontinuat ion 
 
Patients will be discontinued from the study if they: 1) request withdrawal from the study, 2) develop worsening of underlying liver function defined as doubling of serum total bilirubin and/or increase in ALK or AST to ≥ 3x the upper limit of normal or baseline levels  without 
mechanical biliary obstruction, 3) have side effects to study drug (e.g. diarrhea) that are not 
controlled by over the counter medication (e.g. loperamide), or 4) experience an adverse event based on CTCAE 4.0 criteria of grade 3 or higher that is not related to underlying disease.  
 When an adverse event has been identified, the study team will take appropriated action necessary to protect the study participant and then complete the Study Adverse Event Worksheet and log.  The inve stigators will evaluate the event and determine the necessary follow -up and 
reporting required (see next section).  
 
8.1.1 Investigator reporting  
 
The investigator s will personally supervise the study.  An adverse event is defined as any 
unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, or disease temporarily associated with use of the study medication, whether or not related to the medication.  Worsening of the pre -existing 
clinical condition will be considered an adverse event and, possibly, treatment failure.    T he investigators will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug: 
 
1. Probably related:  Adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to study drug or recurs on 
re-challenge and another etiolo gy is unlikely or significantly less likely.  
2. Possibly related:  Adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to the study drug and an 
alternative etiology is equally or less likely compared to the potential relationship to study drug. 
3. Probably not related:  Adverse event has little or no temporal relationship to the study drug 
and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
4. Not related:  Adverse event is due to an underlying or concurrent illness or effect of another 
drug and is not related to the study drug (e.g., has no temporal relationship to study drug or has a much more likely alternative etiology).  
  Adverse events will be classified according to severity into: mild (transient and easily 
tolerated by the participant), moderate (causes t he participant discomfort and interrupts the 
Curcumin pilot study   1/3/2018, V ersion 7  
  
Page 18 of 22 
John Eaton, PI   CONFIDENTIAL  participant’s usual activities), or severe (causes considerable interference with the participant’s 
usual activities and may be incapacitating or life -threatening).  A serious adverse event is defined 
as any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life- threatening, requires or prolongs 
hospitalization, causes persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or, in the opinion of the investigators, represents other significant hazards or potentially serious harm to research participants.  
 
 The investigators will be responsible for communicating adverse events to the Mayo 
Institutional Review Board (IRB), the Data and Safety Monitoring Board, Co-investigators, and 
the Food and Drug Administration.  The following information will be recorded in the study database and provided as indicated: 
 
• Medical record number:  
• Disease/histology (if applicable):  
• The date the adverse event occurred:  
• Description of the adverse event:  
• Relationship of the adverse event to the research (drug, procedure, or intervention):  
• If the adverse event was expected:  
• The severity of the adverse event: (use a table to define severity scale 1 -5) 
• If any intervention was necessary:  
• Resolution: (was th e incident resolved spontaneously, or after discontinuing treatment) 
• Date of Resolution:  
 
8.1.2 Investigator reporting: Notifying the FDA 
 The investigators will report to the FDA all unexpected, serious suspected adverse reactions according to the required IND  Safety Reporting timelines, formats and requirements . 
 Unexpected fatal or life threatening suspected adverse reactions where there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the study drug/placebo and the adverse event, will be 
reported as a serious suspected adverse reaction.  This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A, no later than 7 calendar days after the investigator’s initial receipt of the information about the event.  Other unexpected serious suspected adverse reactions where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug/placebo and the adverse event, will be reported as a serious suspected adverse reaction.  This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A, no later than 15 calendar days after the i nvestigator’s initial receipt of the information about the event.  
 Any clinically important increase in the rate of serious suspected adverse reactions over those listed in the protocol or product insert will be reported as a serious suspected adverse reaction.  This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A no later than 15 calendar days after the investigator’s initial receipt of the information about the event.

Page 19 of 22 
John Eaton, PI   CONFIDENTIAL  Findings from other studies in human or animals that suggest a significant risk in humans 
exposed to the drug will be reported.  This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A, no later than 15 calendar days after the investigators initial receipt of the information about the event.  
 
8.2 Stopping Rules  
 
The study will be stopped if two or mor e participants develop an adverse event based on 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4.0 criteria of grade 3 or higher OR if one patient develops an adverse event based on CTCAE 4.0 criteria of grade 4 or higher that is not related to th e participant’s underlying disease.  
 
8.3 Medical Monitoring  
 
It is the responsibility of the principle investigators to oversee the safety of the study at their  site.  
This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse 
events as noted above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety-monitoring plan (see section 10  “Study Monitoring, Auditing , and Inspecting” ).  Medical 
monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events.  
9 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
9.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Confidentiality of patient information will be protected by using a study number to identify participants.  Data collection forms will be kept in locked files designated for this study within an office, and computerized data will be password- secured.
 
 
9.2 Records Retention  
 
The investigators will maintain records and essential documents related to the conduct of the study.  These will include subject case histories and regulatory documents.  The investigators will retain the specified records and reports for ; 
1. Up to 2 years after the marketing application is approved for the drug ; or, if a marketing 
application is not submitted or approved for the drug, until 2 years after shipment and 
delivery of the drug for investigational use is discontinued and the FDA has been so notified  or

10.1 Study Monitoring Plan 
 
The investigator will allocate adequate time for such monitoring activities.  The Investigator will also ensure that the monitor or other compliance or quality assurance reviewer is given access to all the study -related documents and study related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, 
etc.), and has adequate space to conduct the monitoring visit.  This study will be monitored on a routine basis during the conduct of the trial.  The Mayo Clinic Office of Research Regulatory Support will be allowed to provide clinical monitoring for the trial as a service for the sponsor -investigator.  Clinical trial monitoring requires review of the 
study data generated throughout the duration of the study to ensure the validity and integrity of the data along with the protection of human research subjects.  This will assist sponsor-investigators in complying with Foo d and Drug Administration regulations. 
 
10.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by the IRB, the 
sponsor, and government regulatory agencies, of a ll study related documents (e.g. source 
documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator 
will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study- related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, 
diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by government regulatory authorities and applicable compliance offices.  
11 Ethical Considerations

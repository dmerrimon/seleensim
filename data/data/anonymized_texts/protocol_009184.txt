A Phase 2a, Open -Label, Multicenter, Activity and Safety Study of KX2-391 Ointment 1% in Subjects 
with Actinic Keratosis on the Face or Scalp  
Investigators 
, MD, Lead Principal Investigator  
Sites 
Approximately 8 to 16 sites in the United States 
Study Period and Phase of Development 
First subject in to last subject out, approximately  24 months 
Phase 2a  
Objectives 
Primary Objective: 
• To evaluate the activity of KX2- 391 Ointment 1% administered topically to the face or scalp in 
subjects with actinic keratosis (AK) by determining complete response rate, defined as 100% 
clearance at Day 57 
Secondary Objectives:  
• To assess the activity of KX2-391 Ointment 1% during Days 1-57 
• To assess the safety and tolerability of KX2- 391 Ointment 1% in subjects with AK on the face or 
scalp 
• To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of KX2- 391 Ointment 1% in subjects with AK on the face or 
scalp 
• To assess dose regimens by contrasting 5-day treatment with 3- day treatment in terms of the activity 
and safety of KX2-391 Ointment 1% in subjects with AK on the face or scalp 
Exploratory Objective s: 
• To determine recurrence rates up to 12 months post- Day 57 for subjects who show response at 
Day 57 
• To determine sustained response rates at 12 months post- Day 57 for subjects who show response at 
Day 57 
Study Design 
This study will be an open -label, multicenter, activity, safety, tolerability, and PK study of KX2 -391 
Ointment 1% administered topically to the face or scalp of subjects with actinic keratosis  in 2 sequential 
cohorts :  a 5-day dosing regimen (Cohort 1) and a 3-day dosing regimen (Cohort 2). 
The study consists of Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up Periods. 
In Cohort 1, eligible subjects will receive 5 consecutiv e days of topical treatment, to be applied at the PPD

 study site, with 50 mg of KX2-391 Ointment 1% each day.  Blood samples for PK analysis will be 
collected on Day  1 and Day 5.  Subjects will return for Follow-up visits until Day 57.  Thereafter, only 
Day 57 complete responders will continue Recurrence Follow -up Visits every 3 months for an additional 
12 months after Day 57.  Activity (lesion counts) and safety evaluations will be performed. 
The Sponsor will review accumulating data.  If the 5-day regimen (Cohort 1) has sufficient activity and 
safety to warrant evaluating a 3-day regimen, enrollment of Cohort 2 will start after there are 60 evaluable 
subjects  or up to 80 subjects are enrolled (whichever comes first) in Cohort 1.  For the most part, protocol 
procedures for Cohort 1 w ill be duplicated for Cohort 2, except PK samples will be collected on Days 1 
and 3, and subjects will not return for Visits 5 and 6. 
The same study sites for  the most part of Cohort 1 will be used for Cohort 2.  The Sponsor study team 
will monitor the enrollment status closely and ensure th at any individual site does not enroll too many 
subjects.  
Number of Subjects 
In each cohort, approximately 80 subjects will be enrolled to provide approximately 60 subjects in the 
Evaluable  Set, defined as subjects who complete all planned treatments and most evaluations, including 
the Day 57 Follow -up visit.  Therefore, a total of 160 subjects in 2 cohorts may be enrolled, but the 
sample size of Cohort 2 may be adjusted, depending on the results of Cohort 1.  
Inclusion Criteria 
Eligible subjects must have/be:  
1. Males and females ≥18 years old

Study Treatment 
50 mg of KX2-391 Ointment 1% will be applied topically once daily for 5 consecutive days (Cohort 1) or 
3 consecutive days (Cohort 2) to the 25 cm2 treatment area (2 mg/cm2; 0.5 mg KX2-391 total). 
Duration of Participation and Treatment 
• Planned enrollment period for each cohort:  approximately 3 months (90 days) 
• Planned subject participation is approximately 64 weeks:  
o Screening Period:  up to 28 days 
o Treatment Period:  For Cohort 1, 5 consecutive treatment days (Days 1-5); for Cohort 2, 
3 consecutive treatment days (Days 1-3) 
o Follow-up Period:  Visits at Days 8, 15, 29, and 57 
o Recurrence Follow- up Period:  only for complete responders at Day 57, visits every 3 months for 
12 months after Day 57 (ie, at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-Day 57). 
Length of stay:  On Day 1 (Visit 2 , Cohorts 1 and 2) and Day 5 (Visit 6, Cohort 1) or Day 3 (Visit 4, 
Cohort 2) , subjects may stay for approximately 5 hours at the investigational center until after the last PK 
blood sample is collected.  
Concomitant Drug/Therapy 
Use of any non -study drug treatment for AK lesions on the treatment area is prohibited until Day 57 .  Any 
lesion in the treatment area that is treated during the Recurrence Follow-up Period will be considered as a 
recurrence.  
Assessments 
Activity Assessments  
The Investigator will perform a count of AK lesions for all subjects a t Visits 1 and 2, Visits 7 through 10, and 
for Day 57 complete responders, also at Visits 11 through 14. 
Safety Assessments  
Safety will be assessed by recording all adverse even ts (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), laboratory 
evaluation of hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis values, measurement of weight and vital signs, 
evaluation of ECGs, and the performance of physical examinations.  
Subjects will be queried for spontaneously reported AE s at each study visit, before assessment of local 
skin react ions (LSRs).  AEs will be reported separately from LSRs. 
Subject -reported LSRs will not be reported as adverse events.  
Other Assessments  
The LSR assessment is the Investigator’s (or trained designee ’s) assessment of the following signs on the 
treatment area:  erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration.  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 KX01-AK-002 
 
 
Kinex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
FINAL v3.0_26 Sep 2016  Page 6  
CONFIDENTIAL 
 These signs will be assessed using a grading scale ranging from 0 (not present)  
to 4 (worst).   In addition to LSRs, hypo- and hyper- pigmentation and sc arring on the treatment area will 
be assessed as being present or absent.  Application site reactions not classified as LSRs (eg, pruritus, 
pain, infection) will be reported as adverse events.   All application site reactions and LSRs will be 
followed to re solution, or if resolution is unl ikely, to stabilization.  LSRs will be reported separately from 
AEs.  
Standardized photography will be performed at Screening (Visit 1), Day 1 (Visit 2), Day 8 (Visit 7), 
Day 57 (Visit 10), and during the Recurrence Follow-up (at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post- Day 57).  Before 
study medication application on Day 1, the Investigator or a qualified staff member must obtain 
standardized photography of each subject’s treatment area before application of study medication.  
Pharmacokin etic Assessments 
PK samples will be collected at the following timepoints  for Cohort 1: 
• Day 1:  predose, 0.5 (±5 minutes), 1 and 4 hours (±10 minutes) postdose  
• Day 5:  predose, 0.5 (±5 minutes), 1 and 4 hours (±10 minutes) postdose 
PK samples will be collected at the following timepoints for Cohort 2: 
• Day 1:  predose, 0.5 (±5 minutes), 1 and 4 hours (±10 minutes) postdose  
• Day 3:  predose, 0.5 (±5 minutes), 1 and 4 hours (±10 minutes) postdose  
Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, and Other Biomarker Assessments 
Not applicable  
Bioanalytical Methods 
Plasma concentrations of study drug will be measured using a validated liquid chromatography/tandem 
mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) assay. 
Statistical Methods 
Study Endpoints  
Primary Endpoint  
x Activity will be evaluated by reduction in lesion count.  Complete response rate will be defined as 
the proportion of subjects achieving 100% complete clearance of all treated AK lesions on the face 
or scalp at Day 57.   
Secondary Endpoints  
• Activity:   Reduction in lesion counts during Days 1-57 
• Safety:  Evaluation of AEs and clinical laboratory data ; the results of other safety assessments (vital 
signs, physical examinations, ECGs) will also be evaluated. 
• Pharmacokinetic:  Determination of C max and where applicable, AUC t, C min, and accumulation  
ratio R 
Exploratory Endpoint s 
• Recurrence rate will be defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved 100% complete clearance 
at Day 57 (Visit 10) with any identified AK lesions on the treatment area at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months 
post-Day 57. 
• Sustained response rate will be defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved 100% complete

 clearance at Day 57 (Visit 10) without any identified AK lesions on the treatment area at 12 months 
post-Day 57.  
Analysis Sets  
• Per-Protocol Set:  the group of protocol-eligible subjects who receive 5 days (Cohort 1) or 3 days 
(Cohort 2) of study treatment and complete at least one scheduled post-treatment evaluation. 
• Evaluable Set:  the group of subjects who receive 5 days (Cohort 1) or 3 days (Cohort 2) of treatment 
and complete most evaluations including the Day 57 Follow-up Visit. 
• Safety Analysis/Full Analysis Set:  the group of subjects who receive at least one dose of study 
treatment. 
• PK Analysis Set: the group of subjects who receive study treatment and complete at least one 
scheduled post-treatment PK evaluation. 
Activity Analyses  
AK lesion counts will be summarized  by cohort at Day 1 (pretreatment) and at each subsequent timepoint 
for subjects in the Full Analysis Set  and the Per-Protocol Set. 
A 95% confidence interval (CI) for the complete clearance (response rate) at Day 57 will be estimated by 
cohort in the Evaluable Set. 
Recurrence rates for all subjects who achieved co mplete clearance at Day 57 will be estimated by 
timepoint and cohort in the Evaluable Set. 
A 95% CI for the sustained response rate at 12 months post -Day 57 will be estimated by cohort in the 
Evaluable Set.  
Both cohorts will be analyzed with the same statis tical methods.  Since this is not a dose regimen 
randomized study, any contrast between the 2 cohorts will mainly be noninferential and consist of 
listings, graphs, and descriptive statistics.  
Safety Analyses  
All subjects who receive at least one dose of KX2-391 Ointment 1% will be included in the s afety 
analyses.  Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as either those AEs with an onset after dosing or 
those pre -existing AEs that worsen after dosing.  For AEs, verbatim terms on the case report 
form/electronic case report form (CRF/eCRF) will be m apped to preferred terms (PTs) and system organ 
classes (SOCs) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; v 16. 0 or higher).  
Subject incidence of AEs will be displayed by SOC.   The incidence of AEs will be summarized by 
cohort.  Adverse events will also be summarized by severity, relationship to study drug , and cohort.  
Subject incidence of SAEs will also be displayed  by cohort .  Laboratory parameters will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics at baseline and at each subseque nt timepoint by cohort .  Changes from baseline 
will also be summarized  by cohort.  In addition, shift tables (ie, low-normal- high at baseline versus low-
normal -high at follow-up in a 3-by- 3 contingency table) will be provided to assess changes in laboratory 
values from baseline to follow -up in each cohort. 
Local skin reactions, pigmentation, and scarring as reported by the Investigator, will be displayed and 
summarized by visit and cohort for all subjects. 
Similar to the activity analyses, any contrast between the 2 cohorts will mainly be noninferential in the 
safety analyses .

Kinex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
FINAL v3.0_26 Sep 2016  Page 8  
CONFIDENTIAL 
 Plasma concentrations for KX2-391 will be analyz ed to determine applicable PK parameters. 
Individual timepoints will be tabulated and displayed graphically and listed for all subjects.  Summary PK 
parameters will be analyzed as applicable.  
Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, and Other Biomarker Analyses  
Not applicable  
Interim Analysis 
A formal interim analysis is not planned. Since this is an open- label study, after each group of 
approximately 20 subjects, ongoing analyses will be performed with tabulation of activity, LSRs, and 
advers e events. The decision to open Cohort 2 will be documented. 
Statistical Methods  
Statistical analyses will be reported using summary ta bles, graphs, and data listings. Continuous variables 
will be summarized using the mean, standard de viation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum.  
Categorical variables will be summarized by counts and by percentage of subjects in corresponding 
categories.  All raw data obtained from the CRF/eCRF, as well as any derived data will be included in 
data listings.  
Sample Size Rationale 
For either cohort, a  sample size of 60 sub jects is sufficient to detect a 100% complete clearance rate at 
Day 57 greater than 20% with 80% power, based on a two -sided (alpha=0.05) binomial test, assuming a 
response rate of 35%, and less than a 25% dropout rate.  This corresponds to a two -sided 95% CI with a 
half-width of less than 15% (ie, lower boundary of the CI above 20%).  The sample size of Cohort 2 may 
be adjusted, depending on the results of Cohort 1.

 5 ETHICS 
5.1 Institutional Review Boards/Independent Ethics Committees 
The protocol, any protocol amendments, infor med consent form (ICF), and appropriate 
related documents must be reviewed and approve d before subjects are screened for entry by 
an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Indepe ndent Ethics Committee (IEC) constituted and 
functioning in accordance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E6 (Good 
Clinical Practice [GCP ]1), Section 3, and any local regulations (eg, Federal Regulations, Title 
21 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Part 56 ).  Documentation of IRB/IEC compliance 
with the ICH E6 and any local regulations rega rding constitution and review conduct will be 
provided to the Sponsor. 
A signed letter of study approval from the IRB/IEC chairman must be sent to the Principal 
Investigator (PI) with a copy to the Sponsor be fore study start and the release of any study 
drug to the site by the Sponsor or its designee (ICH E6, Section 4.4).  If the IRB/IEC decides 
to suspend or terminate the study, the Investig ator will immediately send the notice of study 
suspension or termination by the IRB/IEC to the Sponsor. 
Study progress is to be reported to IRB/IECs annually (or as required) by the Investigator or 
Sponsor, depending on local regulatory obligations.  If the Investigator is required to report 
to the IRB/IEC, he/she will forward a copy to the Sponsor at the time of each periodic report.  
The Investigator(s) or the Sponsor will subm it, depending on local regulations, periodic 
reports and inform the IRB/IEC of any reportable adverse events (AEs) per ICH guidelines and local IRB/IEC standards of practice.  Upon co mpletion of the study, the Investigator will 
provide the IRB/IEC with a brief report of the outcome of the study, if required. 
5.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study 
This study will be conducted in accordance with standard operating procedures (SOPs) of the 
Sponsor (or designee), which are designed to en sure adherence to GCP guidelines as required 
by the following:

7 INTRODUCTION 
7.1 Indication 
In this study, the activity, safety, and pharm acokinetics (PK) of KX2-391 Ointment 1% will 
be evaluated in adult subjects with a clinical diagnosis of stable, clinically typical actinic 
keratosis (AK) on the face or scalp.

 7.1.1 Mechanism of Action 
KX2-391 (also referred to as KX01) is a synt hetic and highly selective inhibitor of Src 
tyrosine kinase signaling and tubulin polymer ization. KX2-391 ointment is being developed 
as a topical treatment for actinic keratosis.  KX 2-391 is also being developed as an oral agent 
for oncology indications.  In defining its pharmacological activity in tumor cells, both in vitro and in vivo, KX2-391 has been s hown to have potent activity against a wide range of solid 
tumors as well as leukemia cell lines, including  cell lines that are resistant to commonly used 
cancer drugs.  Clinically, the safety, tolerabi lity and pharmacokinetics of KX2-391 have been 
studied in approximately 120 patients in both so lid and liquid tumors using either once or 
twice daily dosing.  The best overall response in  these early studies has been ‘stable disease’ 
in 25-30% of patients. 
KX2-391 promotes the induction of p53, G2/M arrest of proliferating cell populations and 
subsequent apoptosis via the stimulation of Ca spase-3 and PARP cleavage. Data from pre-
clinical dermatology studies coupled with an  understanding of the mechanism of action of 
KX2-391 suggests that this compound will have clinical activity in dermatology indications 
such as actinic keratosis.  Potent inhibition of the growth of primary human keratinocytes and 
several melanoma cell lines in vitro (50% growth inhibition [GI
50 values] ≤50 nM), suggests 
that KX2-391 has the potential to inhibit the proliferative expansion and promote apoptosis 
of abnormally proliferating cells in the epidermal and dermal layers upon topical application. 
KX2-391 has also been observed to inhibit T cell migration and endothelial tubule formation 
in vitro, suggesting additional potential therapeutic benefits for conditions where pathology is supported by lymphocyte infiltration, inflammation, and/or angiogenesis. 
Information regarding KX2-391 nonclinical studies is provided in the Investigato r’s 
Brochure. 
7.1.2 Clinical Experience with 
KX2-391  
KX2-391 Ointment 1% has been administered  to humans in ongoing study KX01-AK-01-
US.  Based on preliminary PK data from this study in AK lesions on the forearm, the systemic exposure to KX2-391 following topi cal administration is limited, and is 
considerably lower than observed in previous  clinical studies of oral KX2-391.  Patients 
should be monitored for the occurrence of appl ication site reactions and systemic toxicity. 
KX2-391 has been administered orally to a pproximately 120 patients with malignancy. 
The Kinex studies of oral KX2-391 are as follows: 
KX2-391 was evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial, Study No. KX01-01- 07, entitled “A 
Combined Rising Single-Dose (RSD) and Rising Multiple-Dose (RMD) Phase I Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacoki netics of KX2-391 in Patients with Advanced 
Malignancies That Are Refractory to Conventional Therapies”.  
KX2-391 has been evaluated in Study No. KX01-002- 09, entitled “A Phase II, Open -Label, 
Single-Arm Study Evaluating the Safety, Ef ficacy and Pharmacokinetics of KX2-391 in 
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 KX01-AK-002

CONFIDENTIAL 
 Patients with Bone-Metastatic, Castration-Res istant Prostate Cancer Who Have Not Received 
Prior Chemotherapy.”  
KX2-391 was evaluated in Study No, KX01-03- 11, “A Phase 1b Rising Multi ple-Dose 
Clinical Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerabili ty and Activity of Oral Monotherapy with 
KX2-391 in Elderly Subjects with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Who Are Refractory to or Have Declined Standard Induction Therapy”.  
7.2 Study Rationale 
Actinic keratoses represent the initial intra-epidermal manifestation of abnormal keratinocyte 
proliferation having the potential to progress to squamous cell carcinom a (SCC).  Squamous 
cell carcinoma is the second leading cause of skin cancer deaths in the US, with up to 65% of 
SCC arising from pre-existing actinic keratoses.2,3  The risk of progression has been 
determined to be between  0.025% and 16% per year,2,4 and the calculated lifetime risk of 
malignant transformation for a patient with AKs followed up for 10 years is between 6.1% and 10.2%.
5  The rationale behind treating every AK is  based on the difficulty in predicting 
which single AK will progress to squamous cell carcinoma.6,7  Suchniak et al8 reported 36% 
of lesions previously diagnosed clinically as AKs being in fact SCC, with 14% being in situ SCC.  Ehrig et al
9 showed that 4% of AKs clinically diagnosed by board-certified 
dermatologists were in fact SCC and 5% were  considered occult early stage of cutaneous 
malignancy.  Spontaneous regression has been  reported in up to 25.9% of AKs over a 
12-month period, although 15% later reappeared.10,11,12  The goals of treatment are to 
completely eliminate AKs, minimizing their risk of progression to invasive SCC, reducing 
the potential to metastasize and cause death, while obtaining the best cosmetically acceptable 
outcomes.  Current approved/marketed trea tment has shown up to approximately 60% 
efficacy, with a recurrence rate of approximately 35%.

9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This study will be an open-label, multicenter, activity, safety, tolerability, and PK study of 
KX2-391 Ointment 1% administered topically to  the face or scalp of subjects with actinic 
keratosis in 2 sequential c ohorts:  a 5-day dosing regimen (Cohort 1) and a 3-day dosing 
regimen (Cohort 2). 
The study consists of Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up Periods. 
Cohort 1:  
Eligible subjects will receive 5 consecutive days  of topical treatment, to be applied at the 
study site, with 50 mg of KX2-391 Ointment 1% each day.  Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected on Day 1 and Day 5.  Subjects will return for Follow-up visits until Day 57.  
Thereafter, only Day 57 complete responders w ill continue Recurrence Follow-up Visits 
every 3 months for an additional 12 months afte r Day 57.  Activity (lesion counts) and safety 
evaluations will be performed. 
Cohort 2: 
Eligible subjects will receive 3 consecutive days  of topical treatment, to be applied at the 
study site, with 50 mg of KX2-391 Ointment 1% each day.  Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected on Day 1 and Day 3.  Subjects will return for Follow-up visits until Day 57.  
Thereafter, only Day 57 complete responders w ill continue Recurrence Follow-up Visits 
every 3 months for an additional 12 months afte r Day 57.  Activity (lesion counts) and safety 
evaluations will be performed. 
For both cohorts, subjects may stay for approx imately 5 hours at the investigational center 
until after the last PK blood sample is coll ected on Days 1 and 5 (Cohort 1) or Days 1 and 3 
(Cohort 2). 
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 KX01-AK-002 
 
 
Kinex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
FINAL v3.0_26 Sep 2016  Page 23  
CONFIDENTIAL 
 The Sponsor will review accumulating data.  If the 5-day regime n (Cohort 1) has sufficient 
activity and safety to warrant evaluating a 3- day regimen, enrollment of Cohort 2 will start 
after there are 60 evaluable subjects or up to 80 s ubjects are enrolled (whichever comes first) 
in Cohort 1.  For the most part, protocol proc edures for Cohort 1 will be duplicated for 
Cohort 2, except PK samples will be collected on  Days 1 and 3, and subjects will not return 
for Visits 5 and 6. 
The same study sites for the most part of Cohort 1 will be used for Cohort 2.  The Sponsor 
study team will monitor the enrollment status cl osely and ensure that any individual site does 
not enroll too many subjects. 
In each cohort, approximately 80 subjects w ill be enrolled to provide approximately 
60 subjects in the Evaluable Set, defined as subjects who complete all planned treatments and most evaluations, including the Day 57 Follow-up visit.  Therefore, a total of 160 subjects in 
2 cohorts may be enrolled, but the sample size  of Cohort 2 may be adjusted, depending on 
the results of Cohort 1. 
9.1.1 Screening Period 
The Screening Period may last up to 28 days for each cohort. 
Subject eligibility will be established during the Screening Period.  Subjects will be screened 
within 28 days of the first dose of study drug.  All screening assessments/evaluations, as presented in Table 1 and Table 2 will be performed after the subject provides informed 
consent and eligibility criteria are met. 
Treatment Area Identification 
At Screening (Visit 1), the Investigator will se lect a continuous treatment area affected with 
AK on the face or scalp for each subject that: 
x measures 25 cm
2 
x contains 4 to 8 AK lesions that are clinically typical  
The location and approximate shape of the treatm ent area will be re corded on an acetate 
transparency sheet. 
At Visit 1, the Investigator and an investigational center staff member will identify the 
treatment area by:  
x Examining the face or scalp and locating e ach AK with a dot of removable marker. 
x Using an 8 x 11 acetate transparency sheet with 1x1 cm squares.   
x Mapping at least 2 anatomical landmarks on the acetate sheet.  Example of landmarks 
could be bony prominences, scars, moles, seborrheic keratosis, and veins. 
x Indicating the location of AK lesions with  permanent marker dots on the acetate 
transparency sheet.

 x Outlining the treatment area on the transparency sheet with the permanent marker. 
x Removing marker dots on the face/scalp with  alcohol swabs or water (after taking the 
screening photo). 
9.1.2 Treatment Period 
The inclusion/exclusion criteria will be review ed again prior to treatment on Day 1, to 
re-confirm subjects’ eligibility to participate in the study . 
Subjects in Cohort 1 will be treated for 5 cons ecutive days (Days 1-5 [Visits 2-6]) during the 
Treatment Period.  Visits 2 through 6 should be scheduled to occur at approximately the 
same time each day. 
Subjects in Cohort 2 will be treated for 3 cons ecutive days (Days 1-3 [Visits 2-4]) during the 
Treatment Period.  Subjects will not return on Day 4 (Visit 5) or Day 5 (Visit 6).  Visits 2 
through 4 should be scheduled to occur at approximately the same time each day.  
At Visit 2 (Day 1), prior to study drug application, the Investigator and any appropriate 
investigational staff member(s) (Investigator-tra ined designee) will confirm the location of 
the treatment area using the Visit 1 acetate sheet.  The Investigator should re-mark the 
treatment area borders as needed so the study evaluations may be effectively completed. 
Once the treatment area has been re-ident ified at Visit 2, photographs will be taken 
(Section 9.5.1.5.8) .  50 mg of KX2-391 Ointment 1% will be applied topically once daily for 
5 consecutive days (Cohort 1) or 3 consecutive days (Cohort 2) to the 25 cm2 treatment area 
(2 mg/cm2; 0.5 mg KX2-391 total).  See Section 9.4.2.4 for a detailed description of study 
medication application. 
Pharmacokinetic blood sampling, activity, safety assessments, and local skin reaction (LSR) 
assessments (see Section 9.5 for details) will be performed ( Table 1 and Table 2 ).  
Pigmentation and scarring in the treatment area al so will be assessed by the Investigator (or a 
trained designee). 
Standardized photography will be performed at  designated visits throughout the study 
(Table 1 and Table 2 ). 
9.1.3 Follow-up Period 
After the Treatment Period for both cohorts, th ere will be Follow-up Visits at Days 8, 15, 29, 
and 57 to assess safety, activity, LSRs, pigmentation, and scarring. 
For subjects who do not have complete response at Day 57, Day 57 is their Final Visit. 
9.1.4 Recurrence Follow-up Period 
For both cohorts, only for subjects who show complete response at Day 57, there will be 
additional visits every 3 months up to 12 mont hs post-Day 57 (ie, at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months 
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 KX01-AK-002 
 
 
Kinex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

CONFIDENTIAL 
 post-Day 57) to assess recurrence of AK lesions .  These subjects will continue to undergo 
scheduled activity and safety assessments ( Table 1 and Table 2 ). 
For subjects who have complete response at Day 57 and no recurrence, 12 months 
post-Day 57 is the Final Visit.  Those subjects wh o have AK recurrence in the treatment area 
will have their Final Visit at the visit when the AK recurrence is identified.

 Storage Conditions 
Study drug will be stored in accordance w ith labeled storage conditions. Temperature 
monitoring is required at the storage location to ensure that the study drug is maintained 
within an established temperature range.  The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the temperature is monitored throughout the tota l duration of the trial and that records are 
maintained; the temperature should be monitored continuously by using either an in house 
validated data acquisition system, a mechanical recording device, such as a calibrated chart 
recorder, or by manual means, such that minimu m and maximum thermometric values over a 
specific time period can be recorded and retrieved as required. 
 Administration of Investigational Products 
The study medication is for external topical us e on the treatment area.  An investigational 
center staff member will perform the study medic ation applications.  Th e staff member must 
wash her/his hands before and after each study medication application. 
50 mg of KX2-391 Ointment 1% will be applied topically to a 25 cm2 treatment area.  This 
amount contains a total of 0.5 mg KX2-391 free  base.  KX2-391 Ointment 1% will be 
applied once daily for 5 consecutive days (Cohort 1) or 3 consecutive days (Cohort 2) (see 
Table 3 ). 
The staff member will weigh the appropriate amount of study medication into a weighing 
boat (or equivalent) using a calibrated scale.  The amount of study medication applied will be 
calculated by determining the difference of the weight of the weighing boat with study 
medication before and after application.  The amount of study medication weighed will be as 
close to the intended dose as possible. 
A study staff member will perform and document a scale accuracy check at least every day 
before weighing study medication. 
KX2-391 Ointment 1% will be applied to the subject’s treatment area using a fingertip 
protected with a powder-free finger cot or examin ation glove.  The study medication will be 
gently and evenly rubbed over the treatment area, including its borders, until no visible 
accumulation is evident. The time when the study medication application is completed 
(Application Completion Time) will be recorded.

 The study medication should remain on the treat ment area. Subjects must avoid touching or 
wetting the treatment area for at least 12 hours  from time of last application and are not 
allowed to apply any topical products to the treatment area (see Section 9.4.7.3 ).  Instructions 
will be sent home with the subject clarifying on how to care for the treatment area. 
9.4.3 Method of Assigning S ubjects to Treatment Groups 
This is an open-label study with 2 sequential cohorts.  Each site will enroll subjects for 
Cohort 1 (5-day regimen) first, and will not a ssign any subjects to Cohort 2 (3-day regimen) 
until being notified.  The Sponsor will review accumulating data on Cohort 1 to decide if, 
when, and where to start Cohort 2.  In addi tion, the Sponsor study team will monitor the 
enrollment status closely and ensure that any individual site does not enroll too many subjects. 
9.4.4 Selection of Doses in the Study 
The dose of 50 mg of KX2-391 Ointment 1% applied to a 25 cm
2 area on the face or scalp 
for 5 or 3 consecutive days is based on a previ ous study using the same dose regimen for the 
treatment of AK on the forearm (study KX01-AK- 01-US).  Preliminary data show that this 
regimen had an acceptable LSR and safety profile, with efficacy outcomes considered to warrant further investigation. 
9.4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject 
Section 9.4.2.4 provides detailed instructions for admini stering KX2-391 Ointment 1% in 
this study.  Study medication should be applied at about the same time each day. 
9.4.6 Blinding 
The study will not be blinded. 
9.4.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
 Prior Therapy 
All medications (prescription and nonprescription including vitamins and dietary 
supplements), treatments, and therapies includi ng radiotherapy taken 28 days before Day 1 
through the final study visit must be recorde d in the case report form/electronic case report 
form (CRF/eCRF).  A complete AK treatment hist ory will be recorded on the AK Treatment 
History CRF/eCRF (see Section 9.5.1.2.1 ).

 Activity Assessments 
9.5.1.3.1 A CTINIC KERATOSIS LESION COUNT  
The Investigator will perform a count of AK lesions (lesion count) for all subjects at Visits 1 
and 2, Visits 7 through 10, and for Day 57 complete responders, also at Visits 11 through 14. 
The AK lesion count is the Investigator ’s assessment of the number of AK lesions in the 
treatment area.  A subject must have 4 to 8 AK lesions in the treatment area to be eligible to 
continue in the study at Visit 1. 
For this assessment, an AK lesion is consider ed to be on the treatment area, and should be 
counted if it is completely inside the treatment  area or is touching any of the borders of the 
treatment area.  These lesions will be treated during the study medication application process. 
The Investigator must NOT refer to any other ev aluation to assist with the AK lesion count.  
This is not a comparison with the AK lesion count at any other timepoint.

 Subjects will be queried for spontaneously  reported AEs at each study visit, before 
assessment of local skin reactions.  AEs will be reported separately from LSRs. 
Subject-reported LSRs will not be reported as adverse events.  Treatments administered for 
LSRs will be recorded on the Concomitant Medications CRF. 
9.5.1.5.1 A DVERSE EVENTS AND OTHER EVENTS OF INTEREST  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered an investigational product.  An  AE does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the medicinal product.  For this study, the study drug is KX2-391 Ointment 1%. 
Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as: 
x either those AEs with an onset after dosing or  
x those pre-existing conditions that worsen after dosing 
The criteria for identifying AEs are: 
• any unfavorable and unintended sign (incl uding an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated wi th the use of an investigational product, 
whether or not considered related to the investigational product 
• any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease  
• any deterioration in nonprotocol-required mea surements of a laboratory value or other 
clinical test (eg, ECG or x-ray) that result s in symptoms, a change in treatment, or 
discontinuation from study drug 
• recurrence of an intermittent medical conditi on (eg, headache) not present at baseline 
All AEs, regardless of relationship to study drug  or procedure, should be collected beginning 
from the time the subject signs the study IC F through the final contact in the Follow-up 
Period on Day 57.   For subjects participating in the Recurrence Follow-up Period, only AEs 
at the treatment area will be collected. 
Subjects with study drug-related AEs will be followed until resolution, resolved with 
sequelae, or under medical care.  All SAEs must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is 
unlikely, to stabilization. 
All AEs observed during the study will be reported on the CRF/eCRF. 
Laboratory Adverse Events 
A treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory test re sult should be considered as a treatment-
emergent AE (TEAE) if the identified labor atory abnormality leads to any type of 
intervention whether prescribed in the protocol or not. 
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 KX01-AK-002 
 
 
Kinex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
FINAL v3.0_26 Sep 2016  Page 38  
CONFIDENTIAL 
 An abnormal laboratory result should be considered by the Investigator to be an AE if it: 
x results in the withdrawal of study drug 
x results in withholding of study drug pending some investigational outcome 
x results in the initiation of an inte rvention, based on medical evaluation (eg, 
potassium supplement for hypokalemia) 
x results in any out of range laboratory value that in the Investigator ’s judgment 
fulfills the definitions of an AE with regard to the subject ’s medical profile  
x increases in severity compared with baseline 
Abnormal laboratory values should not be listed as  separate AEs if they are considered to be 
part of the clinical syndrome that is being reported  as an AE.  It is the responsibility of the 
Investigator to review all laboratory findings in  all subjects and determine if they constitute 
an AE.  Medical and scientific judgment should be  exercised in deciding whether an isolated 
laboratory abnormality should be classified  as an AE.  Any laboratory abnormality 
considered to constitute an AE should be reported on the Adverse Event CRF/eCRF. 
For significant treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities meeting criteria as SAEs, the 
study site must submit an SAE report to the Sponsor or designee using the SAE reporting procedures described in Section 9.5.3.1 .  However, if a significant treatment-emergent 
laboratory abnormality is accompanied by, and is  part of the syndrome of, a serious clinical 
event or diagnosis, it is the clinical event/d iagnosis that should be reported as the SAE and 
not the significant treatment-emergent laboratory abnormality. 
ECG changes and associated clinical symptoms determined to be clinically significant by the 
Investigator will be reported as AEs.  An ECG abnormality in a subject with symptoms may 
meet the criteria for an AE as described in this protocol.  In these instances, the AE 
corresponding to the symptomatic ECG abnormality will be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF/eCRF. 
For symptomatic ECG abnormalities meeting criteria as SAEs, the study site must submit an 
SAE report, including the ECG report to the Sponsor, or designee, using the SAE reporting procedures ( Section 9.5.3.1 ). 
Assessing Severity of Adverse Events 
Every effort must be made by the Investigator to categorize each AE according to its severity 
and its relationship to the study treatment.  
Adverse events will be graded for severity as follows: 
Mild An event that is easily tolerated by  the patient, causing minimal discomfort 
and not interfering with everyday activities 
Moderate An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with everyday 
activities 
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 KX01-AK-002 
 
 
Kinex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
FINAL v3.0_26 Sep 2016  Page 39  
CONFIDENTIAL 
 Severe An event that prevents normal everyday activities  
Investigators will assess severity for all AEs (f or both increasing and decreasing severity).  
The criteria for assessing severity are different from those used for seriousness (see Section 9.5.1.5.2 ). 
Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment 
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study treatment are: 
x temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study treatment 
x the course of the event, especially the effe ct of discontinuation of study treatment or 
reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable 
x whether the event is known to be associated  with the study treatment or with other 
similar treatments 
x the presence of risk factors in the study s ubject known to increase the occurrence of 
the event 
x the presence of nonstudy treatment-related factors that are known to be associated 
with the occurrence of the event 
Classification of Causality 
The relationship of each AE to the study drug will be recorded on the CRF/eCRF using the 
following criteria: 
Definitely Related:   A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to drug administ ration, and which cannot be explained by 
concurrent or underlying disease or other drugs or conditions 
Probably Related:   A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, unl ikely to be attributed to concurrent or 
underlying disease or other drugs or conditions  
Possibly Related:   A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, but wh ich could also be explained by concurrent 
or underlying disease or other drugs or conditions 
Unlikely Related:   A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to drug administration which makes  a causal relationship improbable, and in 
which other drugs, conditions or concurrent  or underlying disease provide plausible 
explanations 
9.5.1.5.2  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AND OTHER EVENTS OF INTEREST  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• results in death 
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 KX01-AK-002 
 
 
Kinex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
FINAL v3.0_26 Sep 2016  Page 40  
CONFIDENTIAL 
 • is life-threatening (ie, the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or 
was allowed to continue, might have caused death) 
• requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in th e child of a subject who was exposed to the 
study drug) 
Other important medical events that may not be  immediately life-threatening or result in 
death or hospitalization but, when based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to pre vent one of the outcomes in the definition of 
SAE listed above should also be considered SAEs.  Medical and scientific judgment should 
be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situations. 
In addition to the above, other events of inte rest, which include pregnancy and overdose, are 
to be captured using the SAE procedures described in Section 9.5.3.1 , but are to be 
considered as SAEs only if they met one of the above criteria.  All events of these types are 
to be reported on the Adverse Events CRF/eCRF whether or not they meet the criteria for SAEs. 
The following hospitalization is not considered to be an SAE because there is no “AE” (ie, 
there is no untoward medical occurrence) associated with the hospitalization: 
• hospitalization planned before informed cons ent (where the condition requiring the 
hospitalization has not changed pos t study drug administration) 
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely, to stabilization. 
9.5.1.5.3 L ABORATORY MEASUREMENTS  
Blood will be collected for clinical laboratory te sts at Screening (Visit 1), Day 8 (Visit 7), 
and Day 57 (Visit 10) ( Table 1 and Table 2 ).  Collection of blood and urine (including 
samples for pregnancy testing, where applicable)  will be conducted at the clinic site.  
Approximately 20 mL of blood will be collec ted for clinical laboratory testing, including 
pregnancy testing, when required.  Except for those diagnosed as having diabetes, subjects must be fasted for laboratory assessments.  Fasting status must be documented for all 
laboratory samples. 
Microscopic urinalysis will be conducted only when clinically indicated based on dipstick 
results (laboratory protocol) or as determined by the Investigator.  When conducted, microscopic urinalysis results will be recorded on the CRF/eCRF. 
The clinical laboratory tests to be measured during the study are provided in  Table 5 .

 Pigmentation and Scarring 
Hypo- and hyper- pigmentation and scarring on th e treatment area will be assessed by the 
Investigator (or a trained designee) as being present or absent.   
Pigmentation and scarring will be assessed at every post-Screening clinic visit through 
Day 57 (Visit 10) ( Table 1 and Table 2 ).  Pigment-related changes or scarring should be 
followed until resolution or deemed stabilized by the Investigator. 
Standardized Photography 
Standardized photography will be performed at Screening (Visit 1), Day 1 (Visit 2), Day 8 
(Visit 7), Day 57 (Visit 10), and during the Recurrence Follow-up (at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-Day 57).  Before study medication application on Day 1, the Investigator or a qualified staff member must obtain standardized photograph y of each subject’s treatment area before 
application of study medication. 
Care must be taken to ensure the same ligh ting, background, subject positioning relative to 
the camera and camera settings are used for  each photograph.  Equipment, supplies and 
detailed instructions for obtaining and managin g the photographs will be provided to the 
investigational center prior to the initiation of subject enrollment. 
The photographs are to document the appearance of the subjects’ treatment area and to assist 
with the identification and confirmation of the location of the treatment area throughout the 
study ( Section 9.1.1 ). 
Equipment, supplies and detailed instructions for obtaining and managing the photographs 
will be provided to the investigational center  prior to the initiation of subject enrollment.  
9.5.2 Appropriateness of Measurements 
All clinical assessments are standard measurements commonly used in dermatology studies 
as well as in the routine clinical care of patients with actinic keratosis. 
9.5.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events, Pregnancy, and Other Events of 
Interest 
 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs, regardless of their relationship to study treatment, must be reported on a 
completed SAE form by electronic transmission  as soon as possible but no later than 
1 business day from the date the Investi gator becomes aware of the event.  SAE 
reporting requirements will be provi ded in the Investigator File.  
All SAEs, regardless of causality assessment, must be collected through the last subject 
contact and followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely, to stabilization.  SAEs reported to the site from the time of the last subject contact up to 30 days after the last 
contact, will be collected (ie, Day 57 plus 30 days).  During the Recurrence Follow-up 
Period, all AEs, including SAEs in the treatment area will be collected until the last subject

CONFIDENTIAL 
 contact.  These SAEs will be discussed in the clinical study report.  Any SAE event judged 
by the Investigator to be related to the study treatment should be reported to the Sponsor 
regardless of the length of time that has passed since study completion. 
Deaths and life-threatening events should be  reported immediately by telephone.  The 
initial report must be submitted within 1 bu siness day by electronically transmitting the 
completed SAE form. 
The detailed contact information for reporting of SA Es will be provided in the Investigator 
File. 
It is very important that the SAE report form be  filled out as completely as possible at the 
time of the initial report. This includes the Investigator ’s assessment of causality.  All 
supporting documents should be sent de-identified and should contain the assigned subject 
number.  Only supporting documents directly related to the event should be sent. 
Any follow-up information received on SAEs should be forwarded as soon as possible.  If the 
follow-up information changes the Investigator ’s assessment of causality, this should also be 
noted on the follow-up SAE form. 
Preliminary SAE reports should be followed as  soon as possible by detailed descriptions 
including copies of hospital case reports, autopsy reports, and other documents requested by the Sponsor. 
 Reporting of Pregnancy 
Any pregnancy, whether occurring in a subject or in the female partner of a male subject, for 
which the estimated date of conception was either before the last visit or within 30 days of 
last study treatment must be reported. 
If an adverse outcome of a pregnancy is suspected to be related to study drug exposure, this 
should be reported regardless of the length of ti me that has passed since the exposure to study 
treatment. 
A congenital anomaly, death during perinatal period, an induced abortion, or a spontaneous 
abortion are considered to be an SAE and shoul d be reported in the same timeframe and in 
the same format as all other SAEs (see Section 9.5.3.1 ). 
Pregnancies must be reported by electronic tr ansmission as soon as po ssible but no later than 
1 business day from the date the Investigator becomes aware of the pregnancy.  The contact 
information for the reporting of pregnancies is  provided in the Investigator File.  The 
Pregnancy Report Form must be used for reporting.  All pregnancies must be followed to outcome.  The outcome of the pregnancy must be reported as soon as possible but no later 
than 1 business day from the date the Investigator becomes aware of the outcome. 
A subject who becomes pregnant during the Tr eatment Period must be discontinued from 
treatment but continue to participate  in the study per the protocol.

 Reporting of Other Events of Interest 
9.5.3.3.1 R EPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH STUDY DRUG OVERDOSE , 
MISUSE , ABUSE , OR MEDICATION ERROR  
Study drug overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional use of the drug in an amount 
higher than the dose being studied. 
Any study drug overdose should be noted on the Study Medication CRF/eCRF. All AEs associated with overdose, or medicati on error should be captured on the Adverse 
Event CRF/eCRF and also reported using the procedures detailed in Section 9.5.3.1 even if 
the AEs do not meet serious criteria.  If th e AE associated with an overdose or medication 
error does not meet serious criteria, it must still be reported using the SAE form and in an 
expedited manner, but should be noted as nons erious on the SAE form and the Adverse 
Event CRF/eCRF. 
 Expedited Reporting 
The Sponsor (or its designee) must inform In vestigators and regulatory authorities of 
reportable events, in compliance with appli cable regulatory requirements, on an expedited 
basis (ie, within specific timeframes).  For th is reason, it is imperative that sites provide 
complete SAE information in the manner described above. 
In determining what SAEs meet criteria for ex pedited reporting, the current version of the 
Investigator ’s Brochure will be used  for reference safety information. 
 Breaking the Blind 
Not applicable 
 Regulatory Reporting of Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be reported by the Spons or or a third party acting on behalf of the 
Sponsor to regulatory authorities in compliance with local law and established guidance.  The format of these reports will be dictated by the local and regional requirements. 
9.5.4 Completion/Discontinuation of Subjects 
A subject may elect to discontinue from the study at any time for any reason.  See 
Section 9.3.3 for reasons why Investigators may discontinue subjects from the study.  
Investigators must document the actual reason(s ) why they decided to discontinue subjects, 
or why subjects withdrew consent, as appli cable.  Study disposition information will be 
collected on the Disposition CRF/eCRF. 
Subjects who withdraw from study treatment (w ith the exception of death or withdrawal of 
consent) will be encouraged to complete th e Early Termination assessments at the time of 
withdrawal as indicated in  Table 1 and Table 2 .  A subject who has ceased to return for visits

for failure to return, the status of treatment comp liance, the presence or absence of AEs, and 
clinical courses of signs and symptoms.  This i nformation will be recorded in the CRF/eCRF.  
9.5.5 Abuse or Diversion of Study Drug 
Not applicable 
9.5.6 Confirmation of Medical Care by another Physician 
The Investigator will instruct subjects to infor m site personnel when they are planning to 
receive medical care by another physician.  At eac h visit, the Investigator will ask the subject 
whether he/she has received medical care by  another physician since the last visit or is 
planning to do so in the future.  When the subj ect is going to receive medical care by another 
physician, the Investigator, with the consent of the subject, will inform the other physician 
that the subject is participating in the clinical study. 
9.6 Data Quality Assurance 
This study will be organized, performed, a nd reported in compliance with the protocol, 
SOPs, working practice documents, and applicable  regulations and guidelines.  Site audits 
may be made periodically by the Sponsor’s or the CRO’s qualif ied compliance auditing 
team, which is an independent function from the study team responsible for conduct of the study. 
9.6.1 Data Collection 
Data required by the protocol will be doc umented in the subject source documentation, 
collected on the CRF/eCRFs and entered into a validated data management system that is 
compliant with all regulatory requirements.  A CRF/eCRF or a select CRF/eCRF page may be used as a source document.  CRF/eCRFs used as source documents will be listed in the Data Management Plan.  As defined by ICH E6 guidelines (Section 1.11), the CRF is a 
printed, optical, or electronic document design ed to record all of the protocol-required 
information to be reported to the Sponsor on each study subject.  In this study, the CRF may 
refer to either a paper (CRF) or electronic data collection form (eCRF), or both. 
Data collected on the CRF/eCRF must be comple ted following the instructions described in 
the CRF/eCRF Completion Guidelines, which will be based on the Data Management Plan.  The Investigator has ultimate responsibility for  the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safety, and laboratory data entered on the CRF/eCRF.  The PI must sign the CRF/eCRF to 
attest to its accuracy, authenticity, and completeness. 
Completed, original CRFs/eCRFs are the sole property of the Sponsor and should not be 
made available in any form to third parties without written permission from the Sponsor, 
except for authorized representatives of the Sponsor or appropriate regulatory authorities.

CONFIDENTIAL 
 Responsible site personnel will enter the information required by the protocol onto the 
CRF/eCRFs in accordance with the CRF/eCRF Completion Guidelines that are provided.  A 
CRA will visit each site as documented in the monitoring plan to re view the CRF/eCRFs for 
completeness and accuracy against the source documents. They will identify any discrepancies and ensure that appropriate site personnel address the discrepancies. 
The original CRFs/eCRFs will be maintained at the site in a central document repository. If 
used, a copy of the CRF will be forwarded to the Sponsor. 
At the end of the study an electronic copy of the database along with appropriate system 
version will be archived. 
Uniform procedures will be discussed at the Investigator meetings or at site initiation and/or 
will be documented in the CRF/eCRF Completion Guidelines. 
9.6.2 Clinical Data Management 
All data, both CRF/eCRF and external data, will be  loaded into a clinical system as specified 
in the Data Management Plan. 
Quality control and data validation procedures w ill be applied to ensure the validity and 
accuracy of the clinical data. 
All software applications used in the collec tion of data will be properly validated following 
standard computer system validation that is compliant with all regulatory requirements. 
9.7 Statistical Methods 
All statistical analyses will be performed by  the Sponsor or designee after the study is 
completed and the database is locked.  Statistica l analyses will be performed using Phoenix 
WinNonlin and SAS software or other vali dated statistical software as required. 
Statistical analyses will be reported using summary tables, graphs, and data listings. 
Continuous variables will be summarized us ing the mean, standard deviation (SD), median, 
minimum, and maximum.  Categorical variable s will be summarized by counts and by 
percentage of subjects in corresponding categories.  All raw data obtained from the CRF/eCRF, as well as any derived data  will be included in data listings. 
For all analyses, study Day 1 will be defined as the date of the first dose of study drug.

The primary endpoint is activity. 
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 KX01-AK-002
 
Kinex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
FINAL v3.0_26 Sep 2016  Page 49  
CONFIDENTIAL 
 Activity will be evaluated by reduction in lesion count.  Complete response rate will be 
defined as the proportion of subjects achieving 100% complete clearance of all treated AK 
lesions on the face or scalp at Day 57.  
9.7.1.1.2 S ECONDARY ENDPOINTS  
Activity 
Reduction in lesion counts at each visit during Days 1-57 will be assessed as the secondary 
endpoint for activity. 
Safety 
Safety will be evaluated primarily by assess ment of AEs and clinical laboratory data.  The 
results of other safety assessments (vital si gns, PEs, ECGs) will also be evaluated. 
Pharmacokinetic  
Secondary endpoints include the following PK  parameters derived by noncompartmental 
analysis using the plasma concentration-time data of KX2-391:  C max, and where applicable, 
AUC t, Cmin, and accumulation ratio R. 
9.7.1.1.3 E XPLORATORY ENDPOINTS  
Exploratory endpoints include recurren ce and sustained response rates. 
Recurrence rate will be defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved 100% complete 
clearance at Day 57 (Visit 10) with any identifi ed AK lesions on the treatment area at 3, 6, 9, 
and 12 months post-Day 57. 
Sustained response rate will be defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved 100% 
complete clearance at Day 57 (Visit 10) without any identified AK lesions on the treatment 
area at 12 months post-Day 57. 
 Definitions of Analysis Sets 
The Per-Protocol Set is the group of protocol-eligible subjects who receive 5 days (Cohort 1) 
or 3 days (Cohort 2) of study treatment and comp lete at least one scheduled post-treatment 
evaluation.  
The Evaluable Set is the group of subjects who receive 5 days (Cohort 1) or 3 days 
(Cohort 2) of treatment and complete most evaluati ons including the Day 57 Follow-up Visit. 
The Safety Analysis/Full Analysis Set is the group of subjects who receive at least one dose 
of study treatment. 
The PK Analysis Set is the group of subjects who receive study treatment and complete at 
least one scheduled post-treatment PK evaluation.

 Subject Disposition 
All subjects will be tabulated by cohort as to study discontinuation and the reasons for 
discontinuation as described in Section 9.3.3 . 
 Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic and baseline charac teristics will be summarized  by cohort.  For continuous 
demographic variables, results will be summariz ed by cohort as well, and presented as N, 
mean, SD, median, and minimum and maximum valu es.  For categorical (nominal or ordinal) 
variables, the number and percentage of subjects will be used in each cohort.  No statistical 
testing will be performed. 
 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
All Investigator terms for medications recorded in the CRF/eCRF will be coded to an 11-digit code using the World Health Orga nization Drug Dictionary drug codes. 
Prior medications will be defined as medicati ons that stopped before the first dose of study 
drug. 
Concomitant medications will be defined as med ications that (1) started before the first dose 
of study drug and were continuing at the time of  the first dose of study drug, or (2) started on 
or after the date of the first dose of study drug.  Prior and concomitant medications will be 
further coded to the appropriate Anatomical-T herapeutic-Chemical (A TC) code indicating 
therapeutic classification.  A listing of prior and concomitant medications by drug and drug 
class will be included in the clinical study report for this protocol. 
All medications will be presented by cohort in subject data listings. 
 Activity Analyses 
AK lesion counts will be summarized by co hort at Day 1 (pretreatment) and at each 
subsequent timepoint for subjects in the Full  Analysis Set and the Per-Protocol Set. 
A 95% confidence interval (CI) for the complete  clearance (response rate) at Day 57 will be 
estimated by cohort in the Evaluable Set. 
Recurrence rates for all subjects who achieved  complete clearance at Day 57 will be 
estimated by timepoint and cohort in the Evaluable Set. 
A 95% CI for the sustained response rate at 12 months post-Day 57 will be estimated by 
cohort in the Evaluable Set. 
Both cohorts will be analyzed with the same statistical methods.  Since this is not a dose 
regimen randomized study, any contrast between  the 2 cohorts will mainly be noninferential 
and consist of listings, graphs, and descriptive statistics.

leading to discontinuation from study drug will be provided. 
9.7.1.8.3 L ABORATORY VALUES  
Laboratory parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics at baseline and at each 
subsequent timepoint by cohort.  Changes from baseline will also be  summarized by cohort. 
In addition, shift tables (ie, low-normal-high at baseline versus low-normal-high at follow-up 
in a 3-by-3 contingency table) will be provided to assess changes in laboratory values from 
baseline to follow-up in each cohort. 
9.7.1.8.4 V ITAL SIGNS 
Vital sign values will be evaluated by cohort on an individual basis by subject.  Abnormal 
vital sign values will be identified as thos e outside (above or below) the reference range. 
9.7.1.8.5 E LECTROCARDIOGRAMS  
ECG data will be tabulated by cohort for each individual subject. 
9.7.1.8.6 P HYSICAL EXAMINATIONS

 9.7.2 Determination of Sample Size 
For either cohort, a sample size of 60 subjects is sufficient to detect a 100% complete 
clearance rate at Day 57 greater than 20% with 80% power, based on a two-sided (alpha=0.05) binomial test, assuming a res ponse rate of 35%, and less than a 25% dropout 
rate.  This corresponds to a two-sided 95% CI with a half-width of less than 15% (ie, lower boundary of the CI above 20%). 
The sample size of Cohort 2 may be adjusted, depending on the results of Cohort 1. 
9.7.3 Interim Analysis 
A formal interim analysis is not planned. Since this is an open-label study, after each group 
of approximately 20 subjects, ongoing analyses wi ll be performed with tabulation of activity, 
LSRs, and adverse events.  The decision to open Cohort 2 will be documented. 
9.7.4 Other Statistical/Analytical Issues 
Not applicable 
9.7.5 Procedure for Revising the Statistical Analysis Plan 
If the prespecified plans need to be revised af ter the study starts, the Sponsor will determine 
how the revision impacts the study and how the revision should be implemented.  The details 
of the revision will be documented and described in the clinical study report.

Phase 2a
Objectives
Primary Objective :
•To evaluate the activity of KX2- 391 Ointment 1% administered topically to the face or scalp in 
subjects with actinic keratosis (AK) by determining complete response rate, defined as 100% 
clearance at Day 57
Secondary Objectives: 
•To assess the activity of KX2-391 Ointment 1% during Days 1-57
•To assess the safety and tolerability of KX2- 391 Ointment 1% in subjects with AK on the face or 
scalp
•To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of KX2- 391 Ointment 1% in subjects with AK on the face or 
scalp
•To assess dose regimens by contrasting 5-day treatment with 3- day treatment in terms of the activity 
and safety of KX2-391 Ointment 1% in subjects with AK on the face or scalp
Exploratory Objective s:
•To determine recurrence rates up to 12 months post-Day 57 for subjects who show response at 
Day 57
•To determine sustained response rates at 12 months post- Day 57 for subjects who show response at 
Day 57
Study Design
This study will be an open -label, multicenter, activity, safety, tolerability, and PK study of KX2 -391
Ointmen t 1% administered topically to the face or scalp of subjects with actinic keratosis in 2 sequential 
cohorts :  a 5-day dosing regimen (Cohort 1) and a 3-day dosing regimen (Cohort 2).
The study consists of Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up Periods.
In Cohort 1, eligible subjects will receive 5 consecut ive days of topical treatment, to be applied at the PPD

 study site, with 50 mg of KX2-391 Ointment 1% each day.  Blood samples for PK analysis will be 
collected on Day  1 and Day 5.  Subjects will return for Follow-up visits until Day 57.  Thereafter, only 
Day 57 complete responders will continue Recurrence Follow -up Visits every 3 months for an additional 
12 months after Day 57.  Activity (lesion counts) and safety evaluations will be performed. 
The Sponsor will review accumulating data.  If the 5-day regimen (Cohort 1) has sufficient activity and 
safety to warrant evaluating a 3-day regimen, enrollment of Cohort 2 will start after there are 60 evaluable 
subjects  or up to 80 subjects are enrolled (w hichever comes first) in Cohort 1.  For the most part, protocol 
procedures for Cohort 1 w ill be duplicated for Cohort 2, except PK samples will be collected on Days 1 
and 3, and subjects will not return for Visits 5 and 6. 
The same study sites for the most part of Cohort 1 will be used for Cohort 2.  The Sponsor study team 
will monitor the enrollment status closely and ensure th at any individual site does not enroll too many 
subjects.  
Number of Subjects 
In each cohort, approximately 80 subjects will be enrolled to provide approximately 60 subjects in the 
Evaluable  Set, defined as subjects who complete all planned treatments and most evaluations, including 
the Day 57 Follow -up visit.  Therefore, a total of 160 subjects in 2 cohorts may be enrolled, but the 
sample size of Co hort 2 may be adjusted, depending on the results of Cohort 1. 
Inclusion Criteria 
Eligible subjects must have/be:  
1. Males and females ≥18 years old  
2. Clinical diagnosis of stable, clinically typical actinic keratosis 
3. A treatment area on the face or scalp that:

x contains 4 to 8 AK lesions 
4. Females must be postmenopausal (>50 years of age with at least 18 months of amenorrhea), 
surgically sterile (by hysterecto my, bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation) or otherwise incapable 
of pregnancy for at least 1 year; or, if of childbearing potential, must be using highly effective 
contraception for at least 90 da ys prior to treatment with KX2- 391 Ointment 1% and must agree to 
continue to use highly effective contraception fo r at least 90 days following their last dose of 
KX2-391 Ointment 1%.  Highly effective contraception includes oral hormonal contraceptives, 
hormonal contraceptive implant or patch, or intrau terine device.  Abstinence and double barrier 
methods do not qualify as highly ef fective methods of contraception. 
5. Males who have not had a vasectomy must agree to use barrier contraception from Screening through 
90 days after their last dose of KX2-391 Ointment 1%. 
6. All subjects must agree not to donate sperm or eggs or attempt conception from Screening through 
90 days following their last dose of KX2-391 Ointment 1%. 
7. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and a 
negative urine pregnancy test on Day 1 prior to administration of study treatment. 
8. Subjects who in the judgment of the Investigator, are in good general health based on: 
x medical history 
x no physical examination (PE) findings that the Principal Investigator (PI) determines would 
interfere with interpretation of study results

Study Treatment
50mg of KX2-391 Ointment 1% will be applied topically once daily for 5 consecutive days (Cohort 1) or 
3 consecutive days (Cohort 2) to the 25 cm2treatment area (2 mg/cm2; 0.5 mg KX2-391 total).
Duration of Participation and Treatment
•Planned enrollment period for each cohort:  approximately 3 months (90 days)
•Planned subject participation is approximately 64 weeks: 
oScreening Period:  up to 28 days
oTreatment Period:  For Cohort 1, 5 consecutive treatment days (Days 1-5); for Cohort 2, 
3 consecutive treatment days (Days 1-3)
oFollow-up Period:  Visits at Days 8, 15, 29, and 57
oRecurrence Follow- up Period:  only for complete responders at Day 57, visits every 3 months for 
12 months after Day 57 (ie, at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-Day 57).
Length of stay:  On Day 1 (Visit 2 , Cohorts 1 and 2) and Day 5 (Visit 6, Cohort 1) or Day 3 (Visit 4, 
Cohort 2) , subjects may stay for approximately 5 hours at the investigational center until after the last PK 
blood s ample is collected.
Concomitant Drug/Therapy
Use of any non -study drug treatment for AK lesions on the treatment area is prohibited until Day 57 .  Any 
lesion in the treatment area that is treated during the Recurrence Follow-up Period will be considered as a 
recurrence.
Assessments
Activity Assessments
The Investigator will perform a count of AK lesions for all subjects at Visits 1 and 2, Visits 7 through 10, and 
for Day 57 complete responders, also at Visits 11 through 14.
Safety Assessments
Safety will be assessed by recording all adverse even ts (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), laboratory 
evaluation of hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis values, measurement of weight and vital signs, 
evaluation of ECGs, and the performance of physical examinati ons.
Subjects will be queried for spontaneously reported AE s at each study visit, before assessment of local 
skin reactions (LSRs).  AEs will be reported separately from LSRs.
Subject -reported LSRs will not be reported as adverse events. 
Other Assessments
The LSR assessment is the Investigator’s (or trained designee ’s) assessment of the following signs on the 
treatment area:  erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration.  
These signs will be assessed using a grading scale ranging from 0 (not present) 
to 4 (worst). In addition to LSRs, hypo- and hyper- pigm entation and scarring on the treatment area will

CONFIDENTIAL 
 be assessed as being present or absent.  Application site reactions not classified as LSRs (eg, pruritus, 
pain, infection) will be reported as adverse events.   All application site reactions and LSRs will be 
followed to resolution, or if resolu tion is unlikely, to stabilization.   LSRs will be reported separately from 
AEs.  
Standardized photography will be performed at Screening (Visit 1), Day 1 (Visit 2), Day 8 (Visit 7), 
Day 57 (Visit 10), and during the Recurrence Follow-up (at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post- Day 57).  Before 
study medication application on Day 1, the Investigator or a qualified staff member must obtain 
standardized photography of each subject’s treatment area before application of study medication.  
Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
PK samples will be collected at the following timepoints  for Cohort 1: 
• Day 1:  predose, 0.5 (±5 minutes), 1 and 4 hours (±10 minutes) postdose  
• Day 5:  predose, 0.5 (±5 minutes), 1 and 4 hours (±10 minutes) postdose 
PK samples will be collected at the following timepoints for Cohort 2:  
• Day 1:  predose, 0.5 (±5 minutes), 1 and 4 hours (±10 minutes) postdose  
• Day 3:  predose, 0.5 (±5 minutes),  1 and 4 hours (±10 minutes) postdose  
Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, and Other Biomarker Assessments  
Not applicable  
Bioanalytical Methods 
Plasma concentrations of study drug will be measured using a validated liquid chromatography/tandem 
mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) assay. 
Statistical Methods 
Study Endpoints  
Primary Endpoint  
x Activity will be evaluated by reduction in lesion count.  Complete response rate will be defined as 
the proportion of subjects achieving 100% complete clearance o f all treated AK lesions on the face 
or scalp at Day 57.   
Secondary Endpoints  
• Activity:   Reduction in lesion counts during Days 1-57 
• Safety:  Evaluation of AEs and clinical laboratory data ; the results of other safety assessments (vital 
signs, physical examinations, EC Gs) will also be evaluated. 
• Pharmacokinetic:  Determination of C max and where applicable, AUC t, C min, and accumulation  
ratio R 
Exploratory Endpoint s 
• Recurrence rate will be defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved 100% complete cle arance 
at Day 57 (Visit 10) with any identified AK lesions on the treatment area at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months 
post-Day 57. 
• Sustained response rate will be defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved 100% complete 
clearance at Day 57 (Visit 10) without any identified AK lesions on the treatment area at 12 months 
post-Day 57.

CONFIDENTIAL 
 Analysis Sets 
• Per-Protocol Set:  the group of protocol-eligible subjects who receive 5 days (Cohort 1) or 3 days 
(Cohort 2) of study treatment and complete at least one scheduled post-treatment evaluation. 
• Evaluable Set:  the group of subjects who receive 5 days (Cohort 1) or 3 days (Cohort 2) of treatment 
and complete most evaluations including the Day 57 Follow-up Visit. 
• Safety Analysis/Full Analysis Set:  the group of subjects who receive at least one dose of study 
treatment. 
• PK Analysis Set: the group of subjects who receive study treatment and complete at least one 
scheduled post-treatment PK evaluation. 
Activity Analyses  
AK lesion counts will be summarized  by cohort at Day 1 (pre treatment) and at each subsequent timepoint 
for subjects in the Full Analysis Set  and the Per-Protocol Set. 
A 95% confidence interval (CI) for the complete clearance (response rate) at Day 57 will be estimated by 
cohort in the Evaluable Set. 
Recurrence rat es for all subjects who achieved complete clearance at Day 57 will be estimated by 
timepoint and cohort in the Evaluable Set. 
A 95% CI for the sustained response rate at 12 months post -Day 57 will be estimated by cohort in the 
Evaluable Set.  
Both cohorts will be analyzed with the same statis tical methods.  Since this is not a dose regimen 
randomized study, any contrast between the 2 cohorts will mainly be noninferential and consist of 
listings, graphs, and descriptive statistics.  
Safety Analyses  
All subject s who receive at least one dose of KX2-391 Ointment 1% will be included in the safety 
analyses.  Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as either those AEs with an onset after dosing or 
those pre -existing AEs that worsen after dosing.  For AEs, verbatim terms on the case report 
form/electronic case report form ( CRF/eCRF) will be mapped to preferred terms (PTs) and system organ 
classes (SOCs) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; v 16. 0 or higher).  
Subject incidence of AEs will  be displayed by SOC.  The incidence of AEs will be summarized by 
cohort.  Adverse events will also be summarized by severity, relationship to study drug , and cohort.  
Subject incidence of SAEs will also be displayed  by cohort.  Laboratory parameters will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics at baseline and at each subsequent timepoint  by cohort .  Changes from baseline 
will also be summarized  by cohort.  In addition, shift tables (ie, low-normal- high at baseline versus low-
normal -high at follow-up in a 3-by- 3 contingency table) will be provided to assess changes in laboratory 
values from baseline to follow -up in each cohort. 
Local skin reactions, pigmentation, and scarring as reported by the Investigator, will be displayed and 
summarized by visit and cohort for all subjects. 
Similar to the activity analyses, any contrast between the 2 cohorts will mainly be noninferential in the 
safety analyses . 
Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharma cogenomic, and Other Biomarker Analyses  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Plasma concentrations for KX2-391 will be analyzed to determine applicable PK parameters. 
Individual timepoints will be tabulated and displayed graphically and listed for all subjects.  Summary PK 
parameters will be analyzed as applicable.

Not applicable  
Interim Analysis 
A formal interim analysis is not planned. Since this is an open- label study, after each group of 
approximately 20 subjects, ongoing analyses will be performed with tabulation of activity, LSRs, and advers
e events. The decision to open Cohort 2 will be documented. 
Statistical Methods  
Statistical analyses will be reported using summary ta bles, graphs, and data listings. Continuous variables 
will be summarized using the mean, standard  deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum.  
Categorical variables will be summarized by counts and by percentage of subjects in corresponding 
categories.  All raw data obtained from the CRF/eCRF, as well as any derived data will be included in 
data lis tings.  
Sample Size Rationale 
For either cohort, a  sample size of 60 subjects is sufficient to detect a 100% complete clearance rate at 
Day 57 greater than 20% with 80% power, based on a two -sided (alpha=0.05) binomial test, assuming a 
response rate of 35% , and less than a 25% dropout rate.  This corresponds to a two- sided 95% CI with a 
half-width of less than 15% (ie, lower boundary of the CI above 20%).  The sample size of Cohort 2 may 
be adjusted, depending on the results of Cohort 1.

7 INTRODUCTION 
7.1 Indication 
In this study, the activity, safety, and pharm acokinetics (PK) of KX2-391 Ointment 1% will 
be evaluated in adult subjects with a clinical diagnosis of stable, clinically typical actinic 
keratosis (AK) on the face or scalp.

CONFIDENTIAL 
 7.1.1 Mechanism of Action 
KX2-391 (also referred to as KX01) is a synt hetic and highly selective inhibitor of Src 
tyrosine kinase signaling and tubulin polymer ization. KX2-391 ointment is being developed 
as a topical treatment for actinic keratosis.  KX 2-391 is also being developed as an oral agent 
for oncology indications.  In defining its pharmacological activity in tumor cells, both in vitro and in vivo, KX2-391 has been show n to have potent activity against a wide range of solid 
tumors as well as leukemia cell lines, including  cell lines that are resistant to commonly used 
cancer drugs.  Clinically, the safety, tolerabi lity and pharmacokinetics of KX2-391 have been 
studied in approximately 120 patients in both so lid and liquid tumors using either once or 
twice daily dosing.  The best overall response in  these early studies has been ‘stable disease’  
in 25-30% of patients. 
KX2-391 promotes the induction of p53, G2/M arrest of proliferating cell populations and 
subsequent apoptosis via the stimulation of Ca spase-3 and PARP cleavage. Data from pre-
clinical dermatology studies coupled with an  understanding of the mechanism of action of 
KX2-391 suggests that this compound will have clinical activity in dermatology indications 
such as actinic keratosis.  Potent inhibition of the growth of primary human keratinocytes and 
several melanoma cell lines in vitro (50% growth inhibition [GI
50 values] ≤50 nM), suggests 
that KX2-391 has the potential to inhibit the proliferative expansion and promote apoptosis 
of abnormally proliferating cells in the epidermal and dermal layers upon topical application. 
KX2-391 has also been observed to inhibit T cell migration and endothelial tubule formation 
in vitro, suggesting additional potential therapeutic benefits for conditions where pathology is supported by lymphocyte infiltration, inflammation, and/or angiogenesis. 
Information regarding KX2-391 noncli nical studies is provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure. 
7.1.2 Clinical Experience with 
KX2-391  
KX2-391 Ointment 1% has been administered  to humans in ongoing study KX01-AK-01-
US.  Based on preliminary PK data from this study in AK lesions on the forearm, the systemic exposure to KX2-391 following topi cal administration is limited, and is 
considerably lower than observed in previous  clinical studies of oral KX2-391.  Patients 
should be monitored for the occurrence of appl ication site reactions and systemic toxicity. 
KX2-391 has been administered orally to a pproximately 120 patients with malignancy. 
The Kinex studies of oral KX2-391 are as follows: 
KX2-391 was evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial, Study No. KX01-01- 07, entitled “A 
Combined Rising Single-Dose (RSD) and Rising Multiple-Dose (RMD) Phase I Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacoki netics of KX2-391 in Patients with Advanced 
Malignancies That Are Refractory to Conventional Therapies”.  
KX2-391 has been evaluated in Study No. KX01-002-09, ent itled “A Phase II, Open -Label, 
Single-Arm Study Evaluating the Safety, Ef ficacy and Pharmacokinetics of KX2-391 in

KX2-391 was evaluated in Study No, KX01-03- 11, “A Phase 1b Rising Multiple -Dose 
Clinical Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability  and Activity of Oral Monotherapy with KX2-
391 in Elderly Subjects with Acute Myeloi d Leukemia (AML) Who Are Refractory to or 
Have Declined Standard Induction Therapy”.
7.2 Study Rationale 
Actinic keratoses represent the initial intra- epidermal manifestation of abnormal keratinocyte 
proliferation having the potential to progress to  squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).  Squamous 
cell carcinoma is the second leading cause of skin cancer deaths in the US, with up to 65% of 
SCC arising from pre-existing actinic keratoses.2,3 The risk of progression has been 
determined to be between 0.025% and 16% per year,2,4and the calculated lifetime risk of 
malignant transformation for a patient with AK s followed up for 10 years is between 6.1% 
and 10.2%.5The rationale behind treating every AK is  based on the difficulty in predicting 
which single AK will progress to squamous cell carcinoma.6,7 Suchniak et al8reported 36% 
of lesions previously diagnosed clinically as AKs being in fact SCC, with 14% being in situ 
SCC.  Ehrig et al9showed that 4% of AKs clinically diagnosed by board-certified 
dermatologists were in fact SCC and 5% were  considered occult early stage of cutaneous 
malignancy.  Spontaneous regression has been  reported in up to 25.9% of AKs over a 
12-month period, although 15% later reappeared.10,11,12The goals of treatment are to 
completely eliminate AKs, minimizing their risk of progression to invasive SCC, reducing 
the potential to metastasize and cause death, while obtaining the best cosmetically acceptable 
outcomes.  Current approved/marketed trea tment has shown up to approximately 60% 
efficacy, with a recurrence rate of approximately 35%.

9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This study will be an open-label, multicenter, activity, safety, tolerability, and PK study of 
KX2-391 Ointment 1% administered topically to  the face or scalp of subjects with actinic 
keratosis in 2 sequential c ohorts:  a 5-day dosing regimen (Cohort 1) and a 3-day dosing 
regimen (Cohort 2). 
The study consists of Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up Periods. 
Cohort 1:  
Eligible subjects will receive 5 consecutive days  of topical treatment, to be applied at the 
study site, with 50 mg of KX2-391 Ointment 1% each day.  Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected on Day 1 and Day 5.  Subjects will return for Follow-up visits until Day 57.  
Thereafter, only Day 57 complete responders w ill continue Recurrence Follow-up Visits 
every 3 months for an additional 12 months afte r Day 57.  Activity (lesion counts) and safety 
evaluations will be performed. 
Cohort 2: 
Eligible subjects will receive 3 consecutive days  of topical treatment, to be applied at the 
study site, with 50 mg of KX2-391 Ointment 1% each day.  Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected on Day 1 and Day 3.  Subjects will return for Follow-up visits until Day 57.  
Thereafter, only Day 57 complete responders w ill continue Recurrence Follow-up Visits 
every 3 months for an additional 12 months afte r Day 57.  Activity (lesion counts) and safety 
evaluations will be performed. 
For both cohorts, subjects may stay for approx imately 5 hours at the investigational center 
until after the last PK blood sample is coll ected on Days 1 and 5 (Cohort 1) or Days 1 and 3 
(Cohort 2).

CONFIDENTIALThe Sponsor will review accumulating data.  If the 5-day regimen (Cohort 1) has sufficient 
activity and safety to warrant evaluating a 3- day regimen, enrollment of Cohort 2 will start 
after there are 60 evaluable subjects or up to 80 s ubjects are enrolled (whichever comes first) 
in Cohort 1.  For the most part, protocol proc edures for Cohort 1 will be duplicated for 
Cohort 2, except PK samples will be collected on  Days 1 and 3, and subjects will not return 
for Visits 5 and 6. 
The same study sites for the most part of Cohort 1 will be used for Cohort 2.  The Sponsor 
study team will monitor the enrollment status cl osely and ensure that any individual site does 
not enroll too many subjects. 
In each cohort, approximately 80 subjects w ill be enrolled to provide approximately 
60 subjects in the Evaluable Set, defined as subjects who complete all planned treatments and most evaluations, including the Day 57 Follow-up visit.  Therefore, a total of 160 subjects in 
2 cohorts may be enrolled, but the sample size of Cohort 2 may be adjusted, depending on 
the results of Cohort 1. 
9.1.1 Screening Period 
The Screening Period may last up to 28 days for each cohort. 
Subject eligibility will be established during the Screening Period.  Subjects will be screened 
within 28 days of the first dose of study drug.  All screening assessments/evaluations, as 
presented in Table 1 and Table 2 will be performed after the subject provides informed 
consent and eligibility criteria are met. 
Treatment Area Identification 
At Screening (Visit 1), the Investigator will se lect a continuous treatment area affected with 
AK on the face or scalp for each subject that: 
xmeasures 25 cm
2 
xcontains 4 to 8 AK lesions that are clinically typical  
The location and approximate shape of the treatm ent area will be re corded on an acetate 
transparency sheet.
At Visit 1, the Investigator and an investigational center staff member will identify the 
treatment area by:  
xExamining the face or scalp and locating each AK with a dot of removable marker. 
xUsing an 8 x 11 acetate transparency sheet with 1x1 cm squares.   
xMapping at least 2 anatomical landmarks on the acetate sheet.  Example of landmarks 
could be bony prominences, scars, moles, seborrheic keratosis, and veins. 
xIndicating the location of AK lesions with  permanent marker dots on the acetate 
transparency sheet.

9.1.2 Treatment Period 
The inclusion/exclusion criteria will be review ed again prior to treatment on Day 1, to 
re-confirm subjects’ eligibility to participate in the study . 
Subjects in Cohort 1 will be treated for 5 cons ecutive days (Days 1-5 [Visits 2-6]) during the 
Treatment Period. Visits 2 through 6 should be  scheduled to occur at approximately the 
same time each day. 
Subjects in Cohort 2 will be treated for 3 cons ecutive days (Days 1-3 [Visits 2-4]) during the 
Treatment Period.  Subjects will not return on Day 4 (Visit 5) or Day 5 (Visit 6).  Visits 2 
through 4 should be scheduled to occur at approximately the same time each day.  
At Visit 2 (Day 1), prior to study drug application, the Investigator and any appropriate 
investigational staff member(s) (Investigator-tra ined designee) will confirm the location of 
the treatment area using the Visit 1 acetate sheet.  The Investigator should re-mark the 
treatment area borders as needed so the study evaluations may be effectively completed. 
Once the treatment area has been re-ident ified at Visit 2, photographs will be taken 
(Section 9.5.1.5.8 ).  50 mg of KX2-391 Ointment 1% will be applied topically once daily for 
5 consecutive days (Cohort 1) or 3 cons ecutive days (Cohort 2) to the 25 cm2treatment area 
(2 mg/cm2; 0.5 mg KX2-391 total).  See Section 9.4.2.4 for a detailed description of study 
medication application. 
Pharmacokinetic blood sampling, activity, safety assessments, and local skin reaction (LSR) 
assessments (see Section 9.5 for details) will be performed ( Table 1 and Table 2 ).  
Pigmentation and scarring in the treatment area al so will be assessed by the Investigator (or a 
trained designee).
Standardized photography will be performed at  designated visits throughout the study 
(Table 1 andTable 2 ). 
9.1.3 Follow-up Period 
After the Treatment Period for both cohorts, th ere will be Follow-up Visits at Days 8, 15, 29, 
and 57 to assess safety, activity, LSRs, pigmentation, and scarring. 
For subjects who do not have complete response at Day 57, Day 57 is their Final Visit.

CONFIDENTIAL9.1.4 Recurrence Follow-up Period 
For both cohorts, only for subjects who show complete response at Day 57, there will be 
additional visits every 3 months up to 12 mont hs post-Day 57 (ie, at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months 
post-Day 57) to assess recurrence of AK lesions . These subjects will continue to undergo 
scheduled activity and safety assessments ( Table 1 andTable 2 ).
For subjects who have complete response at Day 57 and no recurrence, 12 months 
post-Day 57 is the Final Visit.  Those subjects wh o have AK recurrence in the treatment area 
will have their Final Visit at the visit when the AK recurrence is identified.

CONFIDENTIAL
Storage Conditions
Study drug will be stored in accordance w ith labeled storage conditions. Temperature 
monitoring is required at the storage location to ensure that the study drug is maintained within an established temperature range.  The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the temperature is monitored throughout the tota l duration of the trial and that records are 
maintained; the temperature should be monitored continuously by using either an in house 
validated data acquisition system, a mechanical recording device, such as a calibrated chart 
recorder, or by manual means, such that minimu m and maximum thermometric values over a 
specific time period can be recorded and retrieved as required. 
Administration of Investigational Products
The study medication is for external topical us e on the treatment area.  An investigational 
center staff member will perform the study medic ation applications.  Th e staff member must 
wash her/his hands before and after each study medication application. 
50 mg of KX2-391 Ointment 1% will be applied topically to a 25 cm2 treatment area.  This 
amount contains a total of 0.5 mg KX2-391 free  base.  KX2-391 Ointment 1% will be 
applied once daily for 5 consecutive days (Cohort 1) or 3 consecutive days (Cohort 2) (see 
Table 3 ).
The staff member will weigh the appropriate amount of study medication into a weighing 
boat (or equivalent) using a calibrated scale.  The amount of study medication applied will be 
calculated by determining the difference of the weight of the weighing boat with study 
medication before and after application. The am ount of study medication weighed will be as 
close to the intended dose as possible. 
A study staff member will perform and document a scale accuracy check at least every day 
before weighing study medication. 
The stud y medication will be applied to the subj ect’s treatment area using a fingertip 
protected with a powder-free finger cot or exam ination glove. The study medication will be 
gently and evenly rubbed over the treatment area until no visible accumulation is evident. The time when the study medication applicat ion is completed (Application Completion 
Time) will be recorded. 
The study medication should remain on the treat ment area. Subjects must avoid touching or 
wetting the treatment area for at least 12 hours  from time of last application and are not 
allowed to apply any topical products to the treatment area (see Section 9.4.7.3 ).  Instructions 
will be sent home with the subject clarifying on how to care for the treatment area. 
9.4.3 Method of Assigning S ubjects to Treatment Groups 
This is an open-label study with 2 sequential cohorts.  Each site will enroll subjects for 
Cohort 1 (5-day regimen) first, and will not assign any subjects to Cohort 2 (3-day regimen) 
until being notified.  The Sponsor will review accumulating data on Cohort 1 to decide if,

CONFIDENTIALwhen, and where to start Cohort 2.  In addi tion, the Sponsor study team will monitor the 
enrollment status closely and ensure that any individual site does not enroll too many 
subjects. 
9.4.4 Selection of Doses in the Study 
The dose of 50 mg of KX2-391 applied to a 25 cm2 area on the face or scalp for 5 or 
3 consecutive days is based on a previous study using the same dose regimen for the treatment of AK on the forearm (study KX01-A K-01-US). Preliminary data show that this 
regimen had an acceptable LSR and safety profile, with efficacy outcomes considered to warrant further investigation.
9.4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject 
Section 9.4.2.4 provides detailed instructions for admini stering KX2-391 Ointment 1% in 
this study.  Study medication should be applied at about the same time each day. 
9.4.6 Blinding 
The study will not be blinded. 
9.4.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
Prior Therapy
All medications (prescription and nonprescr iption including vitamins and dietary 
supplements), treatments, and therapies includi ng radiotherapy taken 28 days before Day 1 
through the final study visit must be recorde d in the case report form/electronic case report 
form (CRF/eCRF).  A complete AK treatment hist ory will be recorded on the AK Treatment 
History CRF/eCRF (see Section 9.5.1.2.1 ).
Concomitant Medication/Therapy
Concomitant medication/therapies are any new or existing therapy received by the subject 
after signing the ICF until discharge from the study. 
Any medication (including nonprescription medications) or therapy administered to the 
subject during the course of the study (startin g at the date of informed consent) will be 
recorded on the Concomitant Medication CRF/eCRF. 
Use of sunblock or any topical products in the trea tment area allowed by the Investigator will 
be recorded in the Concomitant Medication CRF/eCRF. 
The Investigator will record any AE on the Adverse Events CRF/eCRF for which the 
concomitant medication/therapy was administered. 
Subjects will refrain from receipt of any ther apy in accordance with the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria

During the Recurrence Follow-up Period, lesion-di rected treatment such as cryotherapy or 
biopsy, and topical treatment is allowed for trea tment of AK lesions emerging in any part of 
the body.  Any lesion in the treatment area th at is treated during the Recurrence Follow-up 
Period will be considered as a recurrence. 
Subjects are prohibited from applying any t opical products, including but not limited to, 
lotions, creams, and ointments to the treatmen t area up until the end of Visit 10 (Day 57), 
except when those medications are prescribed by the Investigator for the management of local skin reactions.  All other routinely used  topical products can be used on the treatment 
area from Day 57 onward, at the discretion of the Investigator. 
All subjects should be reminded to avoid direct  sun or UV exposure to the treatment area 
throughout the study.  From Day 15 onward, if a subject is unable to a void direct sun or UV 
exposure to the treatment area, the Investigator may allow the use of sunblock only. 
Subjects have unrestricted use of nonmedi cated topical products on areas outside of the 
treatment area during the study.  After Day 57, all routinely used topical products can be 
used. 
Any subjects who start systemic therapies for th e treatment of AK will be withdrawn from 
the study. 
Any subjects who start topical therapies for AK on the treatment area will be withdrawn from 
the study.

9.5.1.3.1 A CTINIC KERATOSIS LESION COUNT
The Investigator will perform a count of AK lesions (lesion count) for all subjects at Visits 1
and 2, Visits 7 through 10, and for Day 57 complete responders, also at Visits 11 through 14.
The AK lesion count is the Investigator ’s assessment of the number of AK lesions  in the 
treatment area.  A subject must have 4 to 8 AK lesions in the treatment area to be eligible to 
continue in the study at Visit 1. 
For this assessment, an AK lesion is consider ed to be on the treatment area, and should be 
counted if it is completely inside the treatme nt area or is touching any of the borders of the 
treatment area.  These lesions will be treated during the study medication application process. 
The Investigator must NOT refer to any other ev aluation to assist with the AK lesion count.  
This is not a comparison with the AK lesion count at any other timepoint.

Safety Assessments
Safety assessments will include recording all AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs).
Safety assessments also include laboratory evaluation of hematology, biochemistry, and 
urinalyses; periodic measurement of weight, vita l signs, ECGs, and performance of PEs, as 
detailed in the sections below and shown in Table 1 andTable 2 . 
Subjects will be queried for spontaneously  reported AEs at each study visit, before 
assessment of local skin reactions.  AEs will be reported separately from LSRs. 
Subject-reported LSRs will not be reported as  adverse events. Treatments administered for 
LSRs will be recorded on the Concomitant Medications CRF. 
9.5.1.5.1 A DVERSE EVENTS AND OTHER EVENTS OF INTEREST
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in  a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered an investigational product.  An AE does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the medicinal product.  For this study, the study drug is KX2-391 Ointment 1%.
Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as: 
xeither those AEs with an onset after dosing or  
xthose pre-existing conditions that worsen after dosing 
The criteria for identifying AEs are: 
•any unfavorable and unintended sign (incl uding an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated wi th the use of an investigational product, 
whether or not considered related to the investigational product 
•any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease  
•any deterioration in nonprotocol-required mea surements of a laboratory value or other 
clinical test (eg, ECG or x-ray) that results in symptoms, a change in treatment, or 
discontinuation from study drug

CONFIDENTIAL•recurrence of an intermittent medical conditi on (eg, headache) not present at baseline 
All AEs, regardless of relationship to study drug  or procedure, should be collected beginning 
from the time the subject signs the study IC F through the final contact in the Follow-up 
Period on Day 57. For subjects participating in  the Recurrence Follow-up Period, only AEs 
at the treatment area will be collected. 
Subjects with study drug-related AEs will be followed until resolution, resolved with 
sequelae, or under medical care.  All SAEs must be  followed to resolution or, if resolution is 
unlikely, to stabilization. 
All AEs observed during the study will be reported on the CRF/eCRF. 
Laboratory Adverse Events 
A treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory test re sult should be considered as a treatment-
emergent AE (TEAE) if the identified labor atory abnormality leads to any type of 
intervention whether prescribed in the protocol or not. 
An abnormal laboratory result should be considered by the Investigator to be an AE if it: 
xresults in the withdrawal of study drug 
xresults in withholding of study drug pending some investigational outcome 
xresults in the initiation of an inte rvention, based on medical evaluation (eg, 
potassium supplement for hypokalemia) 
xresults in any out of range laboratory value that in the Investigator ’s judgment 
fulfills the definitions of an AE with regard to the subject ’s medical profile
xincreases in severity compared with baseline 
Abnormal laboratory values should not be listed as  separate AEs if they are considered to be 
part of the clinical syndrome that is being report ed as an AE.  It is the responsibility of the 
Investigator to review all laboratory findings in  all subjects and determine if they constitute 
an AE.  Medical and scientific judgment should be  exercised in deciding whether an isolated 
laboratory abnormality should be classified  as an AE.  Any laboratory abnormality 
considered to constitute an AE should be reported on the Adverse Event CRF/eCRF. 
ECG changes and associated clinical symptoms determined to be clinically significant by the 
Investigator will be reported as AEs.  An ECG abnormality in a subject with symptoms may meet the criteria for an AE as described in this protocol.  In these instances, the AE 
corresponding to the symptomatic ECG abnormality will be recorded on the Adverse Events 
CRF/eCRF. 
For symptomatic ECG abnormalities meeting criteria as SAEs, the study site must submit an 
SAE report, including the ECG report to the Sponsor, or designee, using the SAE reporting procedures ( Section 9.5.3.1 ).

CONFIDENTIALAssessing Severity of Adverse Events 
Every effort must be made by the Investigator to categorize each AE according to its severity 
and its relationship to the study treatment.
Adverse events will be graded for severity as follows: 
Mild An event that is easily tolerated by  the patient, causing minimal discomfort 
and not interfering with everyday activities 
Moderate An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with everyday 
activities 
Severe An event that prevents normal everyday activities
Investigators will assess severity for all AEs (f or both increasing and decreasing severity).  
The criteria for assessing severity are different from those used for seriousness (see Section 9.5.1.5.2 ).
Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment 
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study treatment are: 
xtemporal relationship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study treatment 
xthe course of the event, especially the effe ct of discontinuation of study treatment or 
reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable 
xwhether the event is known to be associated  with the study treatment or with other 
similar treatments 
xthe presence of risk factors in the study s ubject known to increase the occurrence of 
the event 
xthe presence of nonstudy treatment-related factors that are known to be associated 
with the occurrence of the event 
Classification of Causality 
The relationship of each AE to the study drug will be recorded on the CRF/eCRF using the 
following criteria: 
Definitely Related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to drug administ ration, and which cannot be explained by 
concurrent or underlying disease or other drugs or conditions 
Probably Related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, unl ikely to be attributed to concurrent or 
underlying disease or other drugs or conditions

explanations 
9.5.1.5.2 S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AND OTHER EVENTS OF INTEREST
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
•results in death 
•is life-threatening (ie, the s ubject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred; this does not include an event that,  had it occurred in a more severe form or 
was allowed to continue, might have caused death) 
•requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
•results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in th e child of a subject who was exposed to the 
study drug) 
Other important medical events that may not be  immediately life-threatening or result in 
death or hospitalization but, when based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject or may require intervention to pre vent one of the outcomes in the definition of 
SAE listed above should also be considered SAEs.  Medical and scientific judgment should 
be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situations. 
In addition to the above, other events of in terest, which include pregnancy, overdose, and 
significant treatment-emergent laboratory abnormality (See Section 9.5.1.5.1 ), are to be 
captured using the SAE procedures but are to be considered as SAEs only if they met one of the above criteria. All events of these types are to be reported on the CRF/eCRF whether or not they meet the criteria for SAEs. 
The following hospitalization is not considered to be an SAE because there is no “AE” (ie, 
there is no untoward medical occurrence) associated with the hospitalization: 
•hospitalization planned before informed cons ent (where the condition requiring the 
hospitalization has not changed post study drug administration) 
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely, to stabilization.

Interest 
 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs, regardless of their relationship to study treatment, must be reported on a 
completed SAE form by electronic transmission  as soon as possible but no later than 
1 business day from the date the Investi gator becomes aware of the event.  SAE 
reporting requirements will be provi ded in the Investigator File.  
All SAEs, regardless of causality assessment, must be collected through the last subject 
contact and followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely, to stabilization.  SAEs reported to the site from the time of the last subject contact up to 30 days after the last 
contact, will be collected (ie, Day 57 plus 30 days).  During the Recurrence Follow-up 
Period, all AEs, including SAEs in the treatment area will be collected until the last subject 
contact.  These SAEs will be discussed in the clinical study report.  Any SAE event judged by the Investigator to be related to the study treatment should be reported to the Sponsor regardless of the length of time that has passed since study completion. 
Deaths and life-threatening events should be reported immediately by telephone.  The 
initial report must be submitted within 1 bu siness day by electronically transmitting the 
completed SAE form. 
The detailed contact information for reporting of SA Es will be provided in the Investigator 
File. 
It is very important that the SAE report form be  filled out as completely as possible at the 
time of the initial report. This includes the Investigator ’s assessment of causality.  All 
supporting documents should be sent de-identified and should contain the assigned subject number.  Only supporting documents directly related to the event should be sent. 
Any follow-up information received on SAEs should be forwarded as soon as possible.  If the 
follow-up information changes the Investigator ’s assessment of causality, this should also be 
noted on the follow-up SAE form. 
Preliminary SAE reports should be followed as soon as possible by detailed descriptions 
including copies of hospital case reports, autopsy reports, and other documents requested by the Sponsor. 
 Reporting of Pregnancy and Exposure to Study Drug through Breastfeeding 
Any pregnancy for which the estimated date of c onception was either before the last visit or 
within 30 days of last study treatment must be reported. 
If an adverse outcome of a pregnancy is suspected to be related to study drug exposure, this 
should be reported regardless of the length of ti me that has passed since the exposure to study 
treatment.

abortion are considered to be an SAE and should  be reported in the same timeframe and in 
the same format as all other SAEs (see Section 9.5.3.1 ).
Pregnancies must be reported by electronic tr ansmission as soon as pos sible but no later than 
1 business day from the date the Investigator becomes aware of the pregnancy.  The contact 
information for the reporting of pregnancies is  provided in the Investigator File.  The 
Pregnancy Report Form must be used for repor ting.  All pregnancies must be followed to 
outcome.  The outcome of the pregnancy must be reported as soon as possible but no later 
than 1 business day from the date the Investigator becomes aware of the outcome.

study. 
Reporting of Other Events of Interest
9.5.3.3.1 R EPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH STUDY DRUG OVERDOSE ,
MISUSE ,ABUSE , OR MEDICATION ERROR
Study drug overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional use of the drug in an amount 
higher than the dose being studied. 
Any study drug overdose should be noted on the Study Medication CRF/eCRF. All AEs associated with overdose, or medicati on error should be captured on the Adverse 
Event CRF/eCRF and also reported using the procedures detailed in Section 9.5.3.1 even if 
the AEs do not meet serious criteria.  If th e AE associated with an overdose or medication 
error does not meet serious criteria, it must still be reported using the SAE form and in an 
expedited manner but should be noted as nonserious on the SAE form and the Adverse Event CRF/eCRF. 
Expedited Reporting
The Sponsor (or its designee) must inform In vestigators and regulatory authorities of 
reportable events, in compliance with appli cable regulatory requirements, on an expedited 
basis (ie, within specific timeframes).  For th is reason, it is imperative that sites provide 
complete SAE information in the manner described above. 
In determining what SAEs meet criteria for ex pedited reporting, the current version of the 
Investigator ’s Brochure will b e used for reference safety information.

9.7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
 Study Endpoints 
9.7.1.1.1 P RIMARY ENDPOINTS  
The primary endpoint is activity. 
Activity will be evaluated by reduction in lesion count.  Complete response rate will be 
defined as the proportion of subjects achieving 100% complete clearance of all treated AK 
lesions on the face or scalp at Day 57.  
9.7.1.1.2 S ECONDARY ENDPOINTS  
Activity 
Reduction in lesion counts at each visit during Days 1-57 will be assessed as the secondary 
endpoint for activity. 
Safety 
Safety will be evaluated primarily by assess ment of AEs and clinical laboratory data.  The 
results of other safety assessments (vital si gns, PEs, ECGs) will also be evaluated. 
Pharmacokinetic  
Secondary endpoints include the following PK  parameters derived by noncompartmental 
analysis using the plasma concentration-time data of KX2-391:  C max, and where applicable, 
AUC t, Cmin, and accumulation ratio R. 
9.7.1.1.3 E XPLORATORY ENDPOINTS  
Exploratory endpoints include recurren ce and sustained response rates. 
Recurrence rate will be defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved 100% complete 
clearance at Day 57 (Visit 10) with any identified AK lesions on the treatment area at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-Day 57. 
Sustained response rate will be defined as  the proportion of subjects who achieved 100% 
complete clearance at Day 57 (Visit 10) without any identified AK lesions on the treatment 
area at 12 months post-Day 57.

least one scheduled post-treatment PK evaluation. 
Subject Disposition
All subjects will be tabulated by cohort as to study discontinuation and the reasons for 
discontinuation as described in Section 9.3.3.
Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics
Demographic and baseline charac teristics will be summarized  by cohort.  For continuous 
demographic variables, results will be summariz ed by cohort as well, and presented as N, 
mean, SD, median, and minimum and maximum valu es.  For categorical (nominal or ordinal) 
variables, the number and percentage of subjects will be used in each cohort.  No statistical 
testing will be performed. 
Prior and Concomitant Therapy
All Investigator terms for medications recorde d in the CRF/eCRF will be coded to an 
11-digit code using the World Health Orga nization Drug Dictionary drug codes. 
Prior medications will be defined as medicati ons that stopped before the first dose of study 
drug. 
Concomitant medications will be defined as med ications that (1) started before the first dose 
of study drug and were continuing at the time of  the first dose of study drug, or (2) started on 
or after the date of the first dose of study drug.  Prior and concomitant medications will be 
further coded to the appropriate Anatomical-T herapeutic-Chemical (A TC) code indicating 
therapeutic classification.  A listing of prior and concomitant medications by drug and drug 
class will be included in the clinical study report for this protocol. 
All medications will be presented by cohort in subject data listings.

 Activity Analyses 
AK lesion counts will be summarized by co hort at Day 1 (pretreatment) and at each 
subsequent timepoint for subjects in the Full  Analysis Set and the Per-Protocol Set. 
A 95% confidence interval (CI) for the complete  clearance (response rate) at Day 57 will be 
estimated by cohort in the Evaluable Set. 
Recurrence rates for all subjects who achieved  complete clearance at Day 57 will be 
estimated by timepoint and c ohort in the Evaluable Set. 
A 95% CI for the sustained response rate at 12 months post-Day 57 will be estimated by 
cohort in the Evaluable Set. 
Both cohorts will be analyzed with the same statistical methods.  Since this is not a dose 
regimen randomized study, any contrast betwee n the 2 cohorts will mainly be noninferential 
and consist of listings, graphs, and descriptive statistics.

 9.7.1.8.1 E XTENT OF EXPOSURE  
The actual number of doses for each subject will be summarized by cohort. 
9.7.1.8.2 A DVERSE EVENTS  
For AEs, verbatim terms on the CRFs/eCRFs wi ll be mapped to preferred terms (PTs) and 
system organ classes (SOCs) using the Medi cal Dictionary for Re gulatory Activities 
(MedDRA; version 16.0 or higher).  Subject incidence of AEs will be displayed by SOC.  The incidence of AEs will be summarized by cohort.
  Adverse events will also be 
summarized by severity, relationship to study drug, and cohort.  Subject incidence of SAEs 
will also be displayed by cohort. 
Only those AEs that were treatment-emergent  will be included in summary tables.  
Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as: 
x either those AEs with an onset after dosing or  
x those pre-existing AEs that worsen after dosing 
All AEs, treatment emergent or otherwise, will be presented in subject data listings. 
The number (percentage) of subjects with TEAEs leading to death will be summarized by 
MedDRA SOC, PT, and cohort.  A subject data listing of all AEs leading to death will be provided. 
The number (percentage) of subjects with TEAEs leading to discontinuation from study drug 
will be summarized by MedDRA SOC, PT, and cohort.  A subject data listing of all AEs 
leading to discontinuation from study drug will be provided. 
9.7.1.8.3 L ABORATORY VALUES  
Laboratory parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics at baseline and at each 
subsequent timepoint by cohort.  Changes from baseline will also be  summarized by cohort. 
In addition, shift tables (ie, low-normal-high at baseline versus low-normal-high at follow-up 
in a 3-by-3 contingency table) will be provided to assess changes in laboratory values from 
baseline to follow-up in each cohort. 
9.7.1.8.4 V ITAL SIGNS 
Vital sign values will be evaluated by cohort on an individual basis by subject.  Abnormal 
vital sign values will be identified as thos e outside (above or below) the reference range. 
9.7.1.8.5 E LECTROCARDIOGRAMS  
ECG data will be tabulated by cohort for each individual subject.

Physical examination findings will be listed by cohort for each subject. 
9.7.1.8.7 P REGNANCY TESTS  
Results of pregnancy tests will be listed by cohort for all subjects, as applicable. 
9.7.1.8.8 O THER ANALYSES  
Local Skin Reactions 
Local skin reactions as reported by the Invest igator will be displayed and summarized by 
visit and cohort for all subjects. 
Pigmentation and Scarring 
Pigmentation and scarring as reported by the In vestigator will be displayed and summarized 
by visit and cohort for all subjects. 
9.7.2 Determination of Sample Size 
For either cohort, a sample size of 60 subjects is sufficient to detect a 100% complete 
clearance rate at Day 57 greater than 20% with 80% power, based on a two-sided (alpha=0.05) binomial test, assuming a res ponse rate of 35%, and less than a 25% dropout 
rate.  This corresponds to a two-sided 95% CI with a half-width of less than 15% (ie, lower boundary of the CI above 20%). 
The sample size of Cohort 2 may be adjusted, depending on the results of Cohort 1. 
9.7.3 Interim Analysis 
 A formal interim analysis is not planned. Since this is an open-label study, after each group 
of approximately 20 subjects, ongoing analyses wi ll be performed with tabulation of activity, 
LSRs, and adverse events.  The decision to open Cohort 2 will be documented. 
9.7.4 Other Statistical/Analytical Issues 
Not applicable 
9.7.5 Procedure for Revising the Statistical Analysis Plan 
If the prespecified plans need to be revised af ter the study starts, the Sponsor will determine 
how the revision impacts the study and how the revision should be implemented.  The details 
of the revision will be documented and described in the clinical study report.

CONFIDENTIAL 
 • Planned subject participation is approximately 64 weeks:  
o Screening Period:  up to 28 days 
o Treatment Period:  5 consecutive treatment days (Days 1-5) 
o Follow-up Period:  Visits at Days 8, 15, 29, and 57 
o Recurrence Follow-up Period:  only for complete responders at Day 57, visits every 3 months for 
12 months after Day 57 (ie, at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-Day 57). 
Length of stay:  On Day 1 (Visit 2) and Day 5 (Visit 6), subjects will stay for approximately 5 hours at the 
investigational center until after the last PK blood sample is colle cted. 
Concomitant Drug/Therapy 
Use of any non -study drug treatment for AK lesions on the face or scalp is prohibited during the study.  
During the Recurrence Follow -up Period, isolated lesion treatment such as cryotherapy or biopsy is 
allowed for treatment of AK lesions emerging in the selected treatment area.  Any treated lesion will be 
considered as a recurrence.  
Assessments 
Activity Assessments  
The Investigator will perform a count of AK lesions for all subjects at Visits 1 and 2, Visits 7 through 10, and 
for Day 57 complete responders, also at Visits 11 through 14. 
Safety Assessments  
Safety will be assessed by recording all adverse even ts (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), laboratory 
evaluation of hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis  values, measurement of weight and vital signs, 
evaluation of ECGs, and the performance of physical examinations.  
Subjects will be queried for spontaneously reported AE s at each study visit, before assessment of local 
skin reactions (LSRs).  AEs will be re ported separately from LSRs. 
Subject -reported LSRs will not be reported as adverse events.  
Other Assessments  
The LSR assessment is the Investigator’s (or trained designee ’s) assessment of the following signs on the 
treatment area:  erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration.  These signs will be assessed using a grading scale ranging from 0 (not present)  
to 4 (worst).
  In addition to LSRs, hypo- and hyper- pi gmentation and scarring on the treatment area  will 
be assessed as being present or absent.  Application site reactions not classified as LSRs (eg, pruritus, 
pain, infection) will be reported as adverse events.   All application site reactions and LSRs will be 
followed to resolution, or if resolution i s unlikely, to stabilization.  LSRs will be reported separately from 
AEs.  
Standardized photography will be performed at Screening (Visit 1), Day 1 (Visit 2), Day 8 (Visit 7), 
Day 57 (Visit 10), and during the Recurrence Follow-up (at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post- Day 57).  Before 
study medication application on Day 1, the Investigator or a qualified staff member must obtain 
standardized photography of each subject’s treatment area before application of study medication.  
Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
PK samples will be collected at the following timepoints: 
• Day 1:  predose, 0.5 (±5 minutes), 1 and 4 hours (±10 minutes) postdose  
• Day 5:  predose, 0.5 (±5 minutes), 1 and 4 hours (±10 minutes) postdose

Bioanalytical Methods 
Plasma concentrations of study drug will be measured using a validated liquid chromatography/tandem 
mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) assay. 
Statistical Methods 
Study Endpoints  
Primary Endpoint  
x Activity will be evaluated by reduction in lesion count.  Complete response rate will be defined as 
the proportion of subjects achieving 100% complete clearance of all treated AK lesions on the face 
or scalp at Day 57.  Sustained response will be defined a s the proportion of subjects achieving 100% 
(complete) clearance at Day 57 without any identified AK lesions on the treatment area at 12 months 
post-Day 57. 
Secondary Endpoints  
• Activity:   Reduction in lesion counts during Days 1-57 
• Safety:  Evaluation of AEs and clinical laboratory data ; the results of other safety assessments (vital 
signs, physical examinations, ECGs) will also be evaluated. 
• Pharmacokinetic:  Determination of C max,  and where applicable, AUC t, C min, and accumulation  
ratio R 
Exploratory Endpoint 
• Recurrence rate will be defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved 100% complete clearance 
at Day 57 (Visit 10) with any identified AK lesions on the face or scalp at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months 
post-Day 57. 
Analysis Sets  
• Per-Protocol Set:  the group of protocol- eligible subjects who receive 5 days of study treatment and 
complete at least one scheduled post-treatment evaluation. 
• Evaluable Set:  the group of subjects who receive 5 days of treatment and complete most evaluations 
including the Day 57 Follow-up Visit. 
• Safety Analysis/Full Analysis Set:  the group of subjects who receive at least one dose of study 
treatment. 
• PK Analysis Set: the group of subjects who receive study treatment and complete at least one 
scheduled post-treatment PK evaluation. 
Activity Analyses  
AK lesion counts will be summarized at Day 1 (pre treatment) and at each subsequent timepoint for 
subjects in the Full Analysis Set  and the Per-Protocol Set. 
A 95% confidence interval (CI) for th e complete clearance (response rate) at  Day 57 and 12 months 
post-Day 57 will be estimated in the Evaluable Set. 
Recurrence rates for all subjects who achieved complete clearance at Day 57 will be summarized by 
timepoint in the Evaluable Set.

 Safety Analyses 
All subjects who receive at least one dose of KX2-391 Ointment 1% will be included in the safety 
analyses.  Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as either those AEs with an onset after dosing or 
those pre -existing AEs that worsen after dosing.  For AEs, verbatim terms on the case report 
form/electronic case report form ( CRF/eCRF) will be mapped to preferred terms (PTs) and system organ 
classes (SOCs) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; v 16. 0 or higher).  
Subject incidence of AEs will be displayed by SOC.  Adverse events will also be summarized by severity 
and relationship to study drug.  Subject incidence of SAEs will also be displayed.  Laboratory parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics at ba seline and at each subsequent timepoint.  Changes 
from baseline will also be summarized.  In addition, shift tables (ie, low
-normal- high at baseline versus 
low-normal-high at follow-up in a 3-by- 3 contingency table) will be provided to assess changes in 
labora tory values from baseline to follow-up. 
Local skin reactions, pigmentation, and scarring as reported by the Investigator, will be displayed and 
summarized by visit for all subjects.  
Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, and Other Biomarker Ana lyses 
Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Plasma concentrations for KX2 -391 will be analyzed to determine applicable PK parameters. 
Individual timepoints will be tabulated and displayed graphically and listed for all subjects.  Summary PK 
parameters will be analyzed as applicable. 
Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, and Other Biomarker Analyses  
Not applicable  
Interim Analysis 
Since this is an open -label study, after each group of approximately 20 subjects completes Day 57 
assessments, activity data will be tabulated.  
Statistical Methods  
Statistical analyses will be reported using summary ta bles, graphs, and data listings. Continuous variables 
will be summarized using the mean, standard de viation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum.  
Categorical variables will be summarized by counts and by percentage of subjects in corresponding 
categories.  All raw data obtained from the CRF/eCRF, as well as any derived data will be included in data listings.
 
Sample Size Rationale 
A sample size of 60 subjects is sufficient to detect a 100% complete clearance rate at Day 57 greater than 
20% with 80% power, based on a two -sided (alpha=0.05) binomial test, assuming a response rate of 35%, 
and less than a 25% dropout rate.  This corresponds to a two -sided 95% CI with a half-width of less th an 
15% (ie, lower boundary of the CI above 20%).

related documents must be reviewed and approve d before subjects are screened for entry by 
an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Indepe ndent Ethics Committee (IEC) constituted and 
functioning in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E6 (Good 
Clinical Practice [GCP]1), Section 3, and any local regulations (eg, Federal Regulations, Title 
21 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Part 56).  Documentation of IRB/IEC compliance 
with the ICH E6 and any local regulations rega rding constitution and review conduct will be 
provided to the Sponsor. 
A signed letter of study approval from the IRB/IEC chairman must be sent to the Principal 
Investigator (PI) with a copy to the Sponsor be fore study start and the release of any study 
drug to the site by the Sponsor or its designee (ICH E6, Section 4.4).  If the IRB/IEC decides 
to suspend or terminate the study, the Investig ator will immediately send the notice of study 
suspension or termination by the IRB/IEC to the Sponsor. 
Study progress is to be reported to IRB/IECs annually (or as required) by the Investigator or 
Sponsor, depending on local regulatory obligations.  If the Investigator is required to report 
to the IRB/IEC, he/she will forward a copy to the Sponsor at the time of each periodic report.  
The Investigator(s) or the Sponsor will subm it, depending on local regulations, periodic 
reports and inform the IRB/IEC of any reportable adverse events (AEs) per ICH guidelines and local IRB/IEC standards of practice.  Upon co mpletion of the study, the Investigator will 
provide the IRB/IEC with a brief report of the outcome of the study, if required. 
5.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study 
This study will be conducted in accordance with standard operating procedures (SOPs) of the 
Sponsor (or designee), which are designed to en sure adherence to GCP guidelines as required

each subject the nature of the study, its pu rpose, the procedures i nvolved, the expected 
duration, the potential risks and benefits involved, any potential discomfort, potential alternative procedure(s) or course( s) of treatment available to the subject, and the extent of 
maintaining confidentiality of the subject’s reco rds.  Each subject must be informed that 
participation in the study is voluntary, that he/s he may withdraw from the study at any time, 
and that withdrawal of consent will not affe ct his/her subsequent medical treatment or 
relationship with the treating physician. 
This informed consent should be given by means  of a standard written statement, written in 
nontechnical language.  The subject should understand the statement before signing and 
dating it, and will be given a copy of the signed  document.  If a subject is unable to read, an 
impartial witness should be present during the entire informed consent discussion.  After the 
ICF and any other written information to be provide d to subjects is read and explained to the 
subject, and after the subject provides verbal consent to the subject’s participation in the 
study and has signed and personally dated th e ICF, the witness should sign and personally 
date the consent form.  The subject will be asked to sign an ICF at the Screening visit and all 
authorizations required by local law (eg, Protected Health Information in North America) before any study-specific procedures are performed.  No subject can enter the study before his/her informed consent has been obtained. 
An unsigned copy of an IRB/IEC-approved ICF must be prepared in accordance with 
ICH E6, Section 4, and all applicable local regulations.  The original, signed ICF for each subject will be verified by the Sponsor and ke pt on file according to local procedures at the 
site.

7 INTRODUCTION 
7.1 Indication 
In this study, the activity, safety, and pharm acokinetics (PK) of KX2-391 Ointment 1% will 
be evaluated in adult subjects with a clinical diagnosis of stable, clinically typical actinic 
keratosis (AK) on the face or scalp.

 7.1.1 Mechanism of Action 
KX2-391 (also referred to as KX01) is a synt hetic and highly selective inhibitor of Src 
tyrosine kinase signaling and tubulin polymer ization. KX2-391 ointment is being developed 
as a topical treatment for actinic keratosis.  KX 2-391 is also being developed as an oral agent 
for oncology indications.  In defining its pharmacological activity in tumor cells, both in vitro and in vivo, KX2-391 has been show n to have potent activity against a wide range of solid 
tumors as well as leukemia cell lines, including  cell lines that are resistant to commonly used 
cancer drugs.  Clinically, the safety, tolerabi lity and pharmacokinetics of KX2-391 have been 
studied in approximately 120 patients in both so lid and liquid tumors using either once or 
twice daily do sing.  The best overall response in these early studies has been ‘stable disease’ 
in 25-30% of patients.   
KX2-391 promotes the induction of p53, G2/M arrest of proliferating cell populations and 
subsequent apoptosis via the stimulation of Ca spase-3 and PARP cleavage. Data from pre-
clinical dermatology studies coupled with an  understanding of the mechanism of action of 
KX2-391 suggests that this compound will have clinical activity in dermatology indications 
such as actinic keratosis.  Potent inhibition of the growth of primary human keratinocytes and 
several melanoma cell lines in vitro (50% growth inhibition [GI
50 values] ≤50 nM), suggests 
that KX2-391 has the potential to inhibit the proliferative expansion and promote apoptosis 
of abnormally proliferating cells in the epidermal and dermal layers upon topical application. 
KX2-391 has also been observed to inhibit T cell migration and endothelial tubule formation 
in vitro, suggesting additional potential therapeutic benefits for conditions where pathology is supported by lymphocyte infiltration, inflammation, and/or angiogenesis. 
Information regarding KX2- 391 nonclinical studies is provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure. 
7.1.2 Clinical Experience with 
KX2-391  
KX2-391 Ointment 1% has been administered  to humans in ongoing study KX01-AK-01-
US.  Based on preliminary PK data from this study in AK lesions on the forearm, the systemic exposure to KX2-391 following topi cal administration is limited, and is 
considerably lower than observed in previous clinical studies of oral KX2-391.  Patients 
should be monitored for the occurrence of appl ication site reactions and systemic toxicity. 
KX2-391 has been administered orally to a pproximately 120 patients with malignancy. 
The Kinex studies of oral KX2-391 are as follows: 
KX2-391 was evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial, Study No. KX01-01- 07, entitled “A 
Combined Rising Single-Dose (RSD) and Rising Multiple-Dose (RMD) Phase I Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacoki netics of KX2-391 in Patients with Advanced 
Malig nancies That Are Refractory to Conventional Therapies”.  
KX2-391 has been evaluated in Study No. KX01-002- 09, entitled “A Phase II, Open -Label, 
Single-Arm Study Evaluating the Safety, Ef ficacy and Pharmacokinetics of KX2-391 in

KX2-391 was evaluated in Study No, KX01-03- 11, “A Phase 1b Rising Multiple -Dose 
Clinical Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability  and Activity of Oral Monotherapy with KX2-

7.2 Study Rationale 
Actinic keratoses represent the initial intra- epidermal manifestation of abnormal keratinocyte 
proliferation having the potential to progress to  squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).  Squamous 
cell carcinoma is the second leading cause of skin cancer deaths in the US, with up to 65% of 
SCC arising from pre-existing actinic keratoses.2,3  The risk of progression has been 
determined to be between  0.025% and 16% per year,2,4 and the calculated lifetime risk of 
malignant transformation for a patient with AK s followed up for 10 years is between 6.1% 
and 10.2%.5  The rationale behind treating every AK is  based on the difficulty in predicting 
which single AK will progress to squamous cell carcinoma.6,7  Suchniak et al8 reported 36% 
of lesions previously diagnosed clinically as AKs being in fact SCC, with 14% being in situ SCC.  Ehrig et al
9 showed that 4% of AKs clinically diagnosed by board-certified 
dermatologists were in fact SCC and 5% were  considered occult early stage of cutaneous 
malignancy.  Spontaneous regression has been  reported in up to 25.9% of AKs over a 
12-month period, although 15% later reappeared.10,11,12  The goals of treatment are to 
completely eliminate AKs, minimizing their risk of progression to invasive SCC, reducing 
the potential to metastasize and cause death, whil e obtaining the best cosmetically acceptable 
outcomes.  Current approved/marketed trea tment has shown up to approximately 60% 
efficacy, with a recurrence rate of approximately 35%.

9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This study will be an open-label, multicenter, activity, safety, tolerability, and PK study of 
KX2-391 Ointment 1% administered topically to  the face or scalp of subjects with actinic 
keratosis. 
The study consists of Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up Periods. 
Eligible subjects will receive 5 consecutive days  of topical treatment, to be applied at the 
study site, with 50 mg of KX2-391 Ointment 1% each day.  Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected on Day 1 and Day 5.  Subjects will return for Follow-up visits until Day 57.  
Thereafter, only Day 57 complete responders w ill continue Recurrence Follow-up Visits 
every 3 months for an additional 12 months afte r Day 57.  Activity (lesion counts) and safety 
evaluations will be performed. 
On Day 1 (Visit 2) and Day 5 (Visit 6), subject s will stay for approximately 5 hours at the 
investigational center until after th e last PK blood sample is collected. 
9.1.1 Screening Period 
The Screening Period may last up to 28 days. 
Subject eligibility will be established during the Screening Period.  Subjects will be screened 
within 28 days of the first dose of study drug.  All screening assessments/evaluations, as 
presented in Table 1 will be performed after the s ubject provides informed consent and 
eligibility criteria are met. 
Approximately 80 subjects will  be enrolled to provide approx imately 60 subjects in the 
Evaluable Set, defined as subjects who comple te 5 days of treatment and the Day 57 Follow-
up visit. 
Treatment Area Identification 
At Screening (Visit 1), the Investigator will se lect a continuous treatment area affected with 
AK on the face or scalp for each subject that: 
x measures 25 cm
2 
x contains 4 to 8 AK lesions that are clinically typical  
Clinical Study Protocol KX01-AK-002 
 
 
Kinex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
FINAL v1.0_23 Jan 2016  Page 20  
CONFIDENTIAL 
 The location and approximate shape of the treatm ent area will be recorded on the appropriate 
body chart. 
At Visit 1, the Investigator and an investigational center staff member will identify the 
treatment area by:  
x Examining the face or scalp and locating each AK with a dot of removable surgical 
skin marker. 
x Using an 8 x 11 acetate transparency sheet with 1x1 cm squares.  The acetate will 
have 20 squares across and 26 squares vertically. 
x Mapping at least 2 anatomical landmarks on the acetate sheet.  Example of landmarks 
could be bony prominences, scars, moles, seborrheic keratosis, and veins. 
x Indicating location of AK lesions with permanent marker dots on transparency acetate 
sheet. 
x Removing surgical skin mar ker dots with alcohol swabs. 
x Outlining the treatment area on the face or scalp with a fine-tipped indelible marker. 
9.1.2 Treatment Period 
The inclusion/exclusion criteria will be review ed again prior to treatment on Day 1, to 
re-confirm subjects’ eligibility to participate in the study . 
Subjects will be treated for 5 consecutive da ys (Days 1-5 [Visits 2-6]) during the Treatment 
Period.  Visits 2 through 6 should be scheduled to occur at approximately the same time each 
day. 
At Visit 2 (Day 1), prior to study drug application, the Investigator and any appropriate 
investigational staff member(s) (Investigator-tra ined designee) will confirm the location of 
the treatment area using the Visit 1 acetate sh eet and the body charts.  The Investigator 
should re-mark the treatment area borders as needed so the study evaluations may be 
effectively completed. 
Once the treatment area has been re-ident ified at Visit 2, photographs will be taken 
(Section 9.5.1.5.8 ).  50 mg of KX2-391 Ointment 1% will  be applied topically once daily to 
the 25 cm2 treatment area (2 mg/cm2; 0.5 mg KX2-391 total).  KX2-391 Ointment 1% will be 
applied for 5 consecutive days (see Section 9.4.2.4 for a detailed description of study 
medication application). 
Pharmacokinetic blood sampling, activity, safety assessments, and local skin reaction (LSR) 
assessments (see Section 9.5 for details) will be performed ( Table 1 ).  Pigmentation and 
scarring in the treatment area also will be assessed by the Investigator (or a trained designee). 
Standardized photography will be performed at  designated visits throughout the study 
(Table 1 ).

 9.1.3 Follow-up Period 
After the Treatment Period, there will be Follow-up Visits at Days 8, 15, 29, and 57 to assess 
safety, activity, LSRs, pigmentation, and scarring. 
9.1.4 Recurrence Follow-up Period 
Only for subjects who show complete response at Day 57, there will be additional visits 
every 3 months up to 12 months post-Day 57 (ie, at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-Day 57) to 
assess recurrence of AK lesions.  These subjects will continue to undergo scheduled activity 
and safety assessments ( Table 1 ).

 Administration of Investigational Products 
The study medication is for external topical us e on the treatment area.  An investigational 
center staff member will perform the study medic ation applications.  Th e staff member must 
wash her/his hands before and after each study medication application. 
50 mg of KX2-391 Ointment 1% will be applied topically to a 25 cm2 treatment area.  This 
amount contains a total of 0.5 mg KX2-391 free  base.  KX2-391 Ointment 1% will be 
applied once daily for 5 consecutive days (see  Table 2 ). 
The staff member will weigh the appropriate amount of study medication into a weighing 
boat (or equivalent) using a calibrated scale.  The amount of study medication applied will be 
calculated by determining the difference of the weight of the weighing boat with study 
medication before and after application.  The amount of study medication weighed will be as 
close to the intended dose as possible. 
A study staff member will perform and document a scale accuracy check at least every day 
before weighing study medication. 
The study medication will be applied to the subject’s treatment area using a fingertip 
protected with a powder-free finger cot or exam ination glove.  The study medication will be 
gently and evenly rubbed over the treatment ar ea until no visible accumulation is evident. 
The time when the study medication applicat ion is completed (Application Completion 
Time) will be recorded. 
The study medication should remain on the treat ment area. Subjects must avoid touching or 
wetting the treatment area and are not allowed to apply any topical products to the treatment 
area (see Section 9.4.7.3 ) up until the end of Visit 7 (Day 8).  Showers may be taken in the 
morning on Days 1 through 5 in preparation for the study visit, approximately 24 hours after 
study drug application.  Instructions will be se nt home with the subject clarifying on how to 
care for the treatment area on Days 1 through 8. 
9.4.3 Method of Assigning S ubjects to Treatment Groups 
This is a study with one treatment group.  All subjects will be assigned the same treatment. 
9.4.4 Selection of Doses in the Study 
The dose of 50 mg of KX2-391 applied to a 25 cm2 area on the face or scalp for 
5 consecutive days is based on a previous study using the same dose regimen for the 
treatment of AK on the forearm (study KX01-A K-01-US).  Preliminary data show that this 
regimen had an acceptable LSR and safety profile, with efficacy outcomes considered to warrant further investigation.

The study will not be blinded. 
9.4.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
 Prior Therapy 
All medications (prescription and nonprescription including vitamins and dietary 
supplements), treatments, and therapies includi ng radiotherapy taken 28 days before Day 1 
through the final study visit must be recorde d in the case report form/electronic case report 
form (CRF/eCRF).  A complete AK treatment hist ory will be recorded on the AK Treatment 
History CRF/eCRF (see Section 9.5.1.2.1 ). 
 Concomitant Medication/Therapy 
Concomitant medication/therapies are any new or existing therapy received by the subject 
after signing the ICF until discharge from the study. 
Any medication (including nonprescription medications) or therapy administered to the 
subject during the course of the study (startin g at the date of informed consent) will be 
recorded on the Concomitant Medication CRF/eCRF.  The Investigator will record any AE 
on the Adverse Events CRF/eCRF for which the concomitant medication/therapy was 
administered.  
Subjects will refrain from receipt of any th erapy in accordance with the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria.  Subjects should refrain from changing the use of any concomitant therapies during the study. 
 Prohibited Medication/Therapy 
Use of any non-study drug treatment for AK le sions on the face or scalp is prohibited during 
the study.  During the Recurrence Follow-u p Period, isolated lesion treatment such as 
cryotherapy or biopsy is allowed for treatmen t of AK lesions emerging in the selected 
treatment area.  Any treated lesion will be considered as a recurrence. 
Subjects are prohibited from applying any t opical products, including but not limited to, 
lotions, creams, and ointments (Note: routine clea nsers are allowed) to the treatment area up 
until the end of Visit 7 (Day 8), except when  those medications are prescribed by the

9.5 Study Assessments 
9.5.1 Assessments 
All assessments and timing of the assessmen ts should be performed according to the 
Schedule of Procedures and Assessments ( Table 1 ). 
 Demography 
Subject demographic information will be coll ected at the Screening Visit.  Demographic 
information includes date of birth (or age), sex, race/ethnicity. 
 Baseline Assessments 
9.5.1.2.1 M EDICAL /SURGICAL AND ACTINIC KERATOSIS HISTORY  
Medical and surgical history and current medi cal conditions will be recorded at Screening 
(Visit 1).  All pertinent medical history must be noted in the CRF/eCRF.  A complete AK 
medical history will also be recorded. 
Medical history will include:  
x A complete medical and surgical history;  childhood diseases and common colds are 
not required unless it is ongoing at Screening 
x A complete AK history from the time of initial diagnosis 
x A complete AK treatment history including  all commercial and investigational 
products, including medical therapies and su rgical modalities, and other prescribed 
and nonprescription therapies dating back to the initial diagnosis.  
9.5.1.2.2 F ITZPATRICK SKIN-TYPE CLASSIFICATION  
The Fitzpatrick Skin-Type is a skin classification system ( Appendix 1 ) which measures 
2 components (genetic disposition and reaction to  sun exposure).  Skin-types range from very 
fair (Type I) to very dark (Type VI). 
Subjects’ skin will be typed using this classificat ion system at Screening (Visit 1).

 9.5.1.2.3 P RIOR MEDICATIONS  
Prior medications taken within 28 days before Day 1, including nonprescription remedies, 
vitamins, etc, will be recorded at Screening (Visit 1). 
 Activity Assessments 
9.5.1.3.1 A CTINIC KERATOSIS LESION COUNT  
The Investigator will perform a count of AK lesions (lesion count) for all subjects at Visits 1 
and 2, Visits 7 through 10, and for Day 57 complete responders, also at Visits 11 through 14. 
The AK lesion count is the Investigator ’s assessment of the number of AK lesions in the 
treatment area.  A subject must have 4 to 8 AK lesions in the treatment area to be eligible to 
continue in the study at Visit 1. 
For this assessment, an AK lesion is consider ed to be on the treatment area, and should be 
counted if it is completely inside the treatme nt area or is touching any of the borders of the 
treatment area.  These lesions will be treated during the study medication application process. 
The Investigator must NOT refer to any other ev aluation to assist with the AK lesion count.  
This is not a comparison with the AK lesion count at any other timepoint.

Not applicable 
 Safety Assessments 
Safety assessments will include recording all AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs). 
Safety assessments also include laboratory evaluation of hematology, biochemistry, and 
urinalyses; periodic measurement of weight, vita l signs, ECGs, and performance of PEs, as 
detailed in the sections below and shown in  Table 1 . 
Subjects will be queried for spontaneously  reported AEs at each study visit, before 
assessment of local skin reactions.  AEs will be reported separately from LSRs. 
Subject-reported LSRs will not be reported as adverse events.  Treatments administered for 
LSRs will be recorded on the Concomitant Medications CRF. 
9.5.1.5.1 A DVERSE EVENTS AND OTHER EVENTS OF INTEREST  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered an investigational product.  An AE does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the medicinal product.  For this study, the study drug is KX2-391 Ointment 1%. 
Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as: 
x either those AEs with an onset after dosing or  
x those pre-existing conditions that worsen after dosing 
The criteria for identifying AEs are: 
• any unfavorable and unintended sign (incl uding an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated wi th the use of an investigational product, 
whether or not considered related to the investigational product 
• any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease  
Clinical Study Protocol KX01-AK-002 
 
 
Kinex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
FINAL v1.0_23 Jan 2016  Page 33  
CONFIDENTIAL 
 • any deterioration in nonprotocol-required mea surements of a laboratory value or other 
clinical test (eg, ECG or x-ray) that result s in symptoms, a change in treatment, or 
discontinuation from study drug 
• recurrence of an intermittent medical conditi on (eg, headache) not present at baseline 
All AEs, regardless of relationship to study drug  or procedure, should be collected beginning 
from the time the subject signs the study IC F through the final contact in the Follow-up 
Period.   For subjects participating in the Recurren ce Follow-up Period, only AEs at the 
treatment area will be collecte d.  Subjects who fail screening primarily due to AE(s) must 
have the AE(s) leading to screen failure reported on the Screening Disposition CRF/eCRF. 
Subjects with onset of an AE  or deterioration of a pre-exist ing condition will be followed 
until resolution, resolved with sequelae, or under  medical care.  All SAEs must be followed 
to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely, to stabilization. 
All AEs observed during the study will be reported on the CRF/eCRF. 
Laboratory Adverse Events 
A treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory test re sult should be considered as a treatment-
emergent AE (TEAE) if the identified labor atory abnormality leads to any type of 
intervention whether prescribed in the protocol or not. 
An abnormal laboratory result should be considered by the Investigator to be an AE if it: 
x results in the withdrawal of study drug 
x results in withholding of study drug pending some investigational outcome 
x results in the initiation of an inte rvention, based on medical evaluation (eg, 
potassium supplement for hypokalemia) 
x results in any out of range laboratory value that in the Investigator ’s judgment 
fulfills the definitions of an AE with regard to the subject ’s medical profile  
x increases in severity compared with baseline 
Abnormal laboratory values should not be listed as  separate AEs if they are considered to be 
part of the clinical syndrome that is being reported  as an AE.  It is the responsibility of the 
Investigator to review all laboratory findings in  all subjects and determine if they constitute 
an AE.  Medical and scientific judgment should be  exercised in deciding whether an isolated 
laboratory abnormality should be classified  as an AE.  Any laboratory abnormality 
considered to constitute an AE should be reported on the Adverse Event CRF/eCRF. 
ECG changes and associated clinical symptoms determined to be clinically significant by the 
Investigator will be reported as AEs.  An ECG abnormality in a subject with symptoms may meet the criteria for an AE as described in this protocol.  In these instances, the AE 
corresponding to the symptomatic ECG abnormality will be recorded on the Adverse Events 
CRF/eCRF. 
Clinical Study Protocol KX01-AK-002 
 
 
Kinex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
FINAL v1.0_23 Jan 2016  Page 34  
CONFIDENTIAL 
 For symptomatic ECG abnormalities meeting criteria as SAEs, the study site must submit an 
SAE report, including the ECG report to the Sponsor, or designee, using the SAE reporting 
procedures ( Section 9.5.3.1 ). 
Assessing Severity of Adverse Events 
Every effort must be made by the Investigator to categorize each AE according to its severity 
and its relationship to the study treatment.  
Adverse events will be graded for severity as follows: 
Mild An event that is easily tolerated by  the patient, causing minimal discomfort 
and not interfering with everyday activities 
Moderate An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with everyday 
activities 
Severe An event that prevents normal everyday activities  
Investigators will assess severity for all AEs (f or both increasing and decreasing severity).  
The criteria for assessing severity are different from those used for seriousness (see Section 9.5.1.5.2 ). 
Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment 
Items to be considered when assessing the re lationship of an AE to the study treatment are: 
x temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study treatment 
x the course of the event, especially the effe ct of discontinuation of study treatment or 
reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable 
x whether the event is known to be associated  with the study treatment or with other 
similar treatments 
x the presence of risk factors in the study s ubject known to increase the occurrence of 
the event 
x the presence of nonstudy treatment-related factors that are known to be associated 
with the occurrence of the event 
Classification of Causality 
The relationship of each AE to the study drug will be recorded on the CRF/eCRF using the 
following criteria: 
Definitely Related:   A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to drug administ ration, and which cannot be explained by 
concurrent or underlying disease or other drugs or conditions 
Clinical Study Protocol KX01-AK-002 
 
 
Kinex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
FINAL v1.0_23 Jan 2016  Page 35  
CONFIDENTIAL 
 Probably Related:   A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, unl ikely to be attributed to concurrent or 
underlying disease or other drugs or conditions  
Possibly Related:   A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, but which could also be explained by concurrent 
or underlying disease or other drugs or conditions 
Unlikely Related:   A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to drug administration which makes  a causal relationship improbable, and in 
which other drugs, conditions or concurrent  or underlying disease provide plausible 
explanations 
9.5.1.5.2  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AND OTHER EVENTS OF INTEREST  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• results in death 
• is life-threatening (ie, the s ubject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or 
was allowed to continue, might have caused death) 
• requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in th e child of a subject who was exposed to the 
study drug) 
Other important medical events that may not be  immediately life-threatening or result in 
death or hospitalization but, when based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to pre vent one of the outcomes in the definition of 
SAE listed above should also be considered SAEs.  Medical and scientific judgment should 
be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situations. 
In addition to the above, other events of in terest, which include pregnancy, overdose, and 
significant treatment-emergent laboratory abnormality (See Section 9.5.1.5.1 ), are to be 
captured using the SAE procedures but are to be considered as SAEs only if they met one of the above criteria. All events of these types are to be reported on the CRF/eCRF whether or not they meet the criteria for SAEs. 
The following hospitalization is not considered to be an SAE because there is no “AE” (ie, 
there is no untoward medical occurrence) associated with the hospitalization: 
• hospitalization planned before informed cons ent (where the condition requiring the 
hospitalization has not changed pos t study drug administration)

 All SAEs, regardless of causality assessment, must be collected through the last subject 
contact and followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely, to stabilization.  SAEs 
reported to the site from the time of the last subject contact up to 30 days after the last 
contact, will be collected (ie, Day 57 plus 30 days).  These SAEs will be discussed in the 
clinical study report.  Any SAE event judged by the Investigator to be related to the study treatment should be reported to the Sponsor re gardless of the length of time that has passed 
since study completion. 
Deaths and life-threatening events should be  reported immediately by telephone.  The 
immediate report should be followed up within 1 business day by electronically 
transmitting the completed SAE form. 
The detailed contact information for reporting of SAEs is provided in the Safety 
Management Plan, located in the Investigator File. 
It is very important that the SAE report form be  filled out as completely as possible at the 
time of the initial report. This includes the Investigator ’s assessment of causality.  All 
supporting documents should be sent de-identified and should contain the assigned subject number. Send only supporting documents directly related to the event. 
Any follow-up information received on SAEs should be forwarded within 1 business day of 
its receipt.  If the follow-up information changes the Investigator ’s assessment of causality, 
this should also be noted on the follow-up SAE form. 
Preliminary SAE reports should be followed as soon as possible by detailed descriptions 
including copies of hospital case reports, autops y reports, and other documents requested by 
the Sponsor. 
 Reporting of Pregnancy and Exposure to Study Drug through Breastfeeding 
Any pregnancy for which the estimated date of c onception was either before the last visit or 
within 30 days of last study treatment must be reported. 
If an adverse outcome of a pregnancy is suspected to be related to study drug exposure, this 
should be reported regardless of the length of ti me that has passed since the exposure to study 
treatment. 
A congenital anomaly, death during perinatal period, an induced abortion, or a spontaneous 
abortion are considered to be an SAE and should  be reported in the same timeframe and in 
the same format as all other SAEs (see Section 9.5.3.1 ). 
Pregnancies must be reported by electronic tr ansmission as soon as pos sible but no later than 
1 business day from the date the Investigator becomes aware of the pregnancy.  The contact 
information for the reporting of pregnancies is  provided in the Investigator File.  The 
Pregnancy Report Form must be used for repor ting.  All pregnancies must be followed to 
outcome.  The outcome of the pregnancy must be reported as soon as possible but no later 
than 1 business day from the date the Investigator becomes aware of the outcome.

 Reporting of Other Events of Interest 
9.5.3.3.1 R EPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH STUDY DRUG OVERDOSE , 
MISUSE , ABUSE , OR MEDICATION ERROR  
Study drug overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional use of the drug in an amount 
higher than the dose being studied. 
Any study drug overdose should be noted on the Study Medication CRF/eCRF. All AEs associated with overdose, or medicati on error should be captured on the Adverse 
Event CRF/eCRF and also reported using the procedures detailed in Section 9.5.3.1 even if 
the AEs do not meet serious criteria.  If th e AE associated with an overdose or medication 
error does not meet serious criteria, it must still be reported using the SAE form and in an 
expedited manner but should be noted as nonserious on the SAE form and the Adverse Event CRF/eCRF. 
 Expedited Reporting 
The Sponsor (or its designee) must inform In vestigators and regulatory authorities of 
reportable events, in compliance with appli cable regulatory requirements, on an expedited 
basis (ie, within specific timeframes).  For th is reason, it is imperative that sites provide 
complete SAE information in the manner described above. 
In determining what SAEs meet criteria for ex pedited reporting, the current version of the 
Investigator ’s Br ochure will be used for reference safety information.

9.5.4 Completion/Discontinuation of Subjects 
A subject may elect to discontinue from the study at any time for any reason.  See 
Section 9.3.3 for reasons why Investigators may discontinue subjects from the study.  
Investigators must document the actual reason(s ) why they decided to discontinue subjects, 
or why subjects withdrew consent, as appli cable.  Study disposition information will be

collected on the CRF/eCRFs and entered into a validated data management system that is 
compliant with all regulatory requirements.  A CRF/eCRF or a select CRF/eCRF page may be used as a source document.  CRF/eCRFs used as source documents will be listed in the Data Management Plan.  As defined by ICH E6 guidelines (Section 1.11), the CRF is a 
printed, optical, or electronic document design ed to record all of the protocol-required 
information to be reported to the Sponsor on each study subject.  In this study, the CRF may 
refer to either a paper (CRF) or electronic data collection form (eCRF), or both. 
Data collected on the CRF/eCRF must be comple ted following the instructions described in 
the CRF/eCRF Completion Guidelines, which will be based on the Data Management Plan.  The Investigator has ultimate responsibility for  the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safety, and laboratory data entered on the CRF/eCRF.  The PI must sign the CRF/eCRF to attest to its accuracy, authenticity, and completeness.

 Completed, original CRFs/eCRFs are the sole property of the Sponsor and should not be 
made available in any form to third parties without written permission from the Sponsor, 
except for authorized representatives of the Sponsor or appropriate regulatory authorities. 
Responsible site personnel will enter the information required by the protocol onto the 
CRF/eCRFs in accordance with the CRF/eCRF Completion Guidelines that are provided.  A CRA will visit each site as documented in the monitoring plan to re view the CRF/eCRFs for 
completeness and accuracy against the source documents. They will identify any discrepancies and ensure that appropriate site personnel address the discrepancies. 
The original CRFs/eCRFs will be maintained at the site in a central document repository. If 
used, a copy of the CRF will be forwarded to the Sponsor. 
At the end of the study an electronic copy of the database along with appropriate system 
version will be archived. 
Uniform procedures will be discussed at the Investigator meetings or at site initiation and/or 
will be documented in the CRF/eCRF Completion Guidelines.

defined as the proportion of subjects achieving 100% complete clearance of all treated AK 
lesions on the face or scalp at Day 57.  Sustained response will be defined as the proportion of subjects achieving 100% (complete) cleara nce at Day 57 without any identified AK 
lesions on the treatment area at 12 months post-Day 57.
  
9.7.1.1.2 S ECONDARY ENDPOINTS  
Activity 
Reduction in lesion counts at each visit during Days 1-57 will be assessed as the secondary 
endpoint for activity. 
Safety 
Safety will be evaluated primarily by assess ment of AEs and clinical laboratory data.  The 
results of other safety assessments (vital si gns, PEs, ECGs) will also be evaluated. 
Pharmacokinetic  
Secondary endpoints include the following PK  parameters derived by noncompartmental 
analysis using the plasma concentration-time data of KX2-391:  C max, and where applicable, 
AUC t, Cmin, and accumulation ratio R. 
9.7.1.1.3 E XPLORATORY ENDPOINTS  
The exploratory endpoint in the study is recurrence rate. 
Recurrence rate will be defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved 100% complete 
clearance at Day 57 (Visit 10) with any identified AK lesions on the face or scalp at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-Day 57. 
 Definitions of Analysis Sets 
The Per-Protocol Set is the group of protocol-eligible subjects who receive 5 days of study 
treatment and complete at least one scheduled post-treatment evaluation.  
The Evaluable Set is the group of subjects who receive 5 days of treatment and complete 
most evaluations including the Day 57 Follow-up Visit.

 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
All Investigator terms for medications recorded in the CRF/eCRF will be coded to an 
11-digit code using the World Health Orga nization Drug Dictionary drug codes. 
Prior medications will be defined as medicati ons that stopped before the first dose of study 
drug. 
Concomitant medications will be defined as med ications that (1) started before the first dose 
of study drug and were continuing at the time of the first dose of study drug, or (2) started on 
or after the date of the first dose of study drug.  Prior and concomitant medications will be 
further coded to the appropriate Anatomical-T herapeutic-Chemical (A TC) code indicating 
therapeutic classification.  A listing of prior and concomitant medications by drug and drug 
class will be included in the clinical study report for this protocol. 
All medications will be presented in subject data listings. 
 Activity Analyses 
AK lesion counts will be summarized at Da y 1 (pretreatment) and at each subsequent 
timepoint for subjects in the Full Analysis Set and the Per-Protocol Set. 
A 95% confidence interval (CI) for the comp lete clearance (response rate) at Day 57 and 
12 months post-Day 57 will be estimated in the Evaluable Set.

9.7.2 Determination of Sample Size 
A sample size of 60 subjects is sufficient to de tect a 100% complete clearance rate at Day 57 
greater than 20% with 80% power, based on a two-sided (alpha=0.05) binomial test, assuming a response rate of 35%, and less than  a 25% dropout rate.  This corresponds to a 
two-sided 95% CI with a half-width of less th an 15% (ie, lower boundary of the CI above 
20%).

Title of Study: A Double -Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 2 Study to Explore the Efficacy and Safet y of 
Elobixibat in Adults with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) or Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis 
(NASH)  
Principal Investigator:   
Study Centers:  Up to 15 sites will be initiated for this study in the United States (US)  
Publica tion(s): Not applicable  
Planned Study Period: Q2 2019 to Q2 2020  Development Phase: Phase 2  
Objectives:  
Primary Objective  
The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of repeated once -daily doses of 5 mg elobixibat on 
serum levels of low -density lip oprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) in patients with NAFLD or NASH.  
Secondary Objectives  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of elobixibat in patients with N AFLD or NASH  
• To evaluate the effect of elobixibat on liver steatosis as measured by magnetic resonance i maging 
(MRI) for (i) liver fat fraction (using proton density fat fraction [PDFF]) and (ii) total liver fat (using whole liver fat volume)  
• To evaluate t he effect of elobixibat on liver function using alanine aminotransferase (ALT)  
• To evaluate the effect of  elobixibat on lipids and total bile acids ( BA) in patients with NAFLD or 
NASH 
Methodology:  
This is a double -blind, randomized, placebo- controlled, Phase 2 study to explore the efficacy and safety 
of elobixibat (oral dose of 5 mg) once daily fo r 16 weeks in patients with NAFLD or NASH. The study 
includes a 6 -week Screening period, followed by a 16-week Treatment period,  and a Follow -Up visit 
2 weeks after the last dose of study drug.  
After completing the Screening perio d, eligible patients will be randomized on Day  1 (Visit  2) in a 1:1 
fashion to either 5  mg/day elobixibat or matching placebo. There  will be a total of 7 scheduled visits 
during the study. Additional unscheduled visits may be required for patients who need direct site 
assistance (e.g., due to adverse event [AE] monitoring, in order to fulfill screening requirements, and/or 
for safety m aintenance).  Patients who screen fail may be rescreened if approved by Sponsor ’s Medical 
Monitor . 
Number of Patients: Approximately 46 patients diagnosed with NAFLD/NASH and in accordance with 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized.   
Inclusion Criteria:  
Patients must meet all of the following criteria to be included in th e study:  
1. Be willing to participate i n the study and provide written informed consent  
2. Be a man or woman ≥18 years of age  
3. Have a current biopsy -confirmed NASH within 6 months of screening or a suspected diagnosis 
of NAFLD/NASH based on the criteria outlined below:

Analysis Populations:  
• The in tent-to-treat (ITT) population will include all patients who are randomized in the study 
and receive at least 1  dose of study drug. The ITT population will be used for all efficacy 
analyses based on the treatment randomized unless otherwise specified  
• The p er protocol (PP) population will include all ITT patients who finish Visit 7/End of 
Treatment (EOT) with valid LDL-C measurements and do not have any major protocol 
deviations. Allocation of patients to the PP analysis set will be performed before unblindi ng of 
the study  
• The safety population will include all patients who are randomized and receive at least 1 dose 
of study drug and will be used for all safety analyses based on the treatment received  
• Summary statistics (number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) at all visits and change or percent change from Baseline will be provided  for 
efficacy and safety continuous variables. Count and frequency will be used to tabulate categorical variables  
• Demographics, disposition, and study populations will be summarized descriptively  
 
Efficacy: 
• The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from Baseline in serum LDL -C at Week 16. 
Baseline is defined as the last non -missing LDL-C value prior to the first dose of study drug  
• An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to analyze the primary efficacy endpoint. 
The model will include treatment arm and baseline LDL-C scores  
• Least square (LS) mean (SE), LS mean difference (SE), 95% confidence intervals, and 
P-values bet ween elobixibat 5 mg and placebo will be provided. The model assumptions will 
be checked before the analysis. If there are concerns on model assumptions, i.e., normality and homogeneity of variances, a non -parametri c ANCOVA based on the rank scores can be used as 
a sensitivity analysis  
• Exploratory comparisons between elobixibat 5 mg and placebo will be performed for the following secondary efficacy endpoints:  
o Absolute change from Baseline to Week 16 in liver fat fra ction (%) as measured by 
MRI-PDFF  
o Absolut e change from Baseline to Week 16 in total liver fat (mL) as measured by MRI  
• The analysis methods for the other secondary endpoints and exploratory endpoints will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan for the  study. 
 
Safety: 
• The safety endpoints for  this study include clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, AEs, 
ECGs, physical examinations, and concomitant medications  
• AEs will be coded using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Act ivities 
(MedRA). TEAEs will be defined as  AEs that are new or worsening after the first dose of study 
drug. A general summary of patients with TEAEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) /adverse 
event of special interest (AESI)  will be tabulated with numbers a nd percentages of patients and 
repeated f or severity and relationship to study drug per treatment group. The number of AEs 
leading to withdrawal and SAEs leading to death will also be summarized. The incidence of 
TEAEs will be summarized by body system and  treatment group

5.1 Investigational Medicinal Product  
Elobixibat is a potent inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT ; also known as the 
apical sodium bile acid transporter [ASBT ]). The IBAT, expressed mainly in the distal 
ileum, is a key element in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids becaus e it facilitates 
the very ef ficient process of bile acid reabsorption. Elobixibat is orally administered and 
acts locally in the gut where it binds reversibly to the IBAT to decrease the reuptake of 
bile acids to the liver. Elobixibat has minimal systemic exposure at expected therapeutic 
dose ranges.  
5.2 Background 
5.2.1 Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Nonalcoholic 
Steatohepatitis (NASH)  
Recent data suggest that bile acids may play an important role in NASH pathogenesis 
(Ferslew 2015; Aranha 2008; Puri 2018). Bile acids are signaling molecules involved in 
lipid, glucose , and energy homeostasis, which are metabolic pathways linked to 
NAFLD/NASH and comorbidities suc h as metabolic syndrome, obesity , and diabetes. 
Bile acids as well as free cholesterol, which is the precursor from which bile acids are synthesized, can act as lipotoxic agents that drive inflammation and fibrosis. Studies have shown that both serum and l iver bile acids are increased in patients with NASH, and 
recent data have suggested that the presence and severity of NASH is associated with specific changes in circulating bile acids ( Puri 2018). Thus, targeting of bile acid 
pathways has therapeutic potential in  patients with  NASH.  
The enterohepatic circulation of bile acids plays a crucial role in whole body sterol balance. Bile acids are secreted to the intestine via the bile duct and then reabsorbed, mainly by a specific bile acid transporter located i n the ileum (IBAT or ASBT) a nd 
delivered back to the liver, completing the enterohepatic circulation ( Prawitt 2011 ).  
Bile acid reabsorption from the intestine is a very efficient process where 95% of the secreted bile acids  are reabsorbed and IBAT appears to be the major regulator of the bile 
acid pool in animals and humans. IBAT inhibitors reduce the reabsorption of bile acids 
from the ileum and prevent their return to the liver. The liver compensates for the decrease in bi le acid level s by upregulati ng cholesterol 7α -hydroxylase, the rate- limiting

Module 5: Clinical Study Reports  
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol  
 
Confidential  Version 3.0/ 10 September  2019  Page 19 of 70 enzyme for bile acid synthesis. This results in lower hepatic cholesterol levels and an 
increased number of low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptors in the liver leading to 
reduced plasma low-density lipoprot ein cholesterol ( LDL-C; [ Bertolotti 2003; 
Naoumova  1999]). Bile acids also positively regulate glucagon- like peptide -1 (GLP -1) 
levels via activation of TGR5 ( Prawitt  2011; Schaap  2014). GLP -1 is an insulinotropic 
hormone but has many other roles , e.g., slowing gastric emptying and increasing satiety 
signals le ading to weight loss ( Andersen 2018).  
Inhibition of bile acid absorption locally in the intestine has the potential to positively influence NASH, cardiovascular  disease,  and metabolic disease by targeting multiple 
mechanisms , as follows : lowering of LDL -C by increased bile acid synthesis ; improving 
metabolic status and weight loss by increasing GLP -1 levels ; and reducing hepatic cell 
damage by lowering toxic bile acid and free cholesterol in the liver.  
5.2.2 Summary of Nonclinical  Studies in NASH  
One nonclinical study with elobixibat in a NASH model  has been completed. The study 
evaluated the effects of elobixibat in leptin -deficient ob/ob mice treated with a diet high 
in trans  fats, fructose , and cholesterol. Although elobixibat did not reduce liver NAFLD 
activity score or fibrosis stage, there were indicators of relevant effects, including 
reduction in liver  alpha -smooth muscle actin  (α-SMA ), which is a marker of stellate cell 
activation and thereby an indirect marker for fibrosis  formation. Administration of 10 and 
30 mg/kg/day elobixibat decreased liver steatosis as quantified by lipid fractional area in 
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) -stained liver sections in a dose- dependent fashion. This 
was further evident in animals treated with 30  mg/kg elobixibat that showed reduced liver 
triglycerides and liver total cholesterol as determined by biochemical analyses. Analysis of liver gene express ion by next generation RNA sequencing revealed pronounced and 
dose-dependent effects of elobixibat. It affected the expression of genes in key pathways 
associated with NASH pathology.  
Additional nonclinical studies with elobixibat are summarized in the Inv estigator ’s 
Brochure  (M1.14.4.1). 
5.3 Rationale 
Bile acids act as signaling molecules in l ipid, glucose , and energy homeostasis. Studies 
have shown that both serum and liver bile acids are increased in patients with NASH 
Elobix AB  A3309 – 141078 
Module 5: Clinical Study Reports  
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol  
 
Confidential  Version 3.0/ 10 September  2019  Page 20 of 70 (Ferslew  2015), and recent data have suggested that the presence and severity of NASH 
is asso ciated with specific changes in circulating bile acids ( Puri 2018; Sanyal  2018). 
Inhibition of bile acid absor ption from the intestine has the potential to improve the 
pathophysiology in NASH, inc luding the related cardiovascular and metabolic disease 
due to impingement on multiple key metabolic feedback mechanisms , as follows : 
lowering of LDL -C by increased bile acid synthesis, and improving insulin sensitivity by 
increasing GLP -1 levels. A reduct ion of cardiovascular risk is particularly desirable for 
any pharmacological NASH  treatment, because cardiovascular complications contribute 
to a significant amount of mo rtality in patients with NAFLD/NASH, with their annual 
risk being 2- fold increased ( Mahfood  Haddad  2017; Younossi  2018). IBAT inhibition 
reduces the levels of bile acid that circulate to the liver, and triggers increased hepatic 
bile acid synthesis from cholesterol. Thus, besides having a positive impact on 
cardiovascular health, IBAT inhibition might also reduce hepatic cell damage by lowering free cholesterol and changing the composition of toxic bile acids in the liver.  
5.4 Risk/Benefit  
Elobixibat is orall y administered and acts locally in the gut where it binds reversibly to 
the IBAT to decrease the reuptake of bile acids into the liver, thereby increasing the concentration of bile acids  in the colon. Due to its mechanism of action, most adverse 
events  (AEs) are gastrointestinal ( GI) tract disorders, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, 
abdominal distention, flatulence , and nausea ; the incidence of these has increased with 
increasing dose le vels. Diarrhea has been the most prominent dose -limiting side effect. 
No clinically significant findings in laboratory measures or electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) 
have been reported. Based on postmarketing case reporting, ischemic colitis will be 
monitored as an  adverse event of special interest for elobixibat.  
There is no establi shed benefit for subjects participating in this Phase 2 study. Based 
upon these data, the risk/benefit for subjects participating in this trial is acceptable.  
This study will be conducte d in compliance with the protocol and with the International 
Council on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on GCP.

Confidential  Version  3.0 /10 September  2019  Page 37 of 70 Any withdrawal, and reasons for withdrawal, must be fully documented in the electronic 
case report form (eCRF) and source documents and the patient followed by the investigator/investi gative staff. Even after the stu dy is completed at the Follow -Up visit, 
the investigator/investigative staff will, regardless of reason for withdrawal, record any patient data they receive concerning serious adverse events ( SAEs ), and all drug- related 
non-serious AEs, and report these in  the eCRF. Withdrawn patients will not be replaced.  
Patients will be withdrawn in the following circumstances:  
• A patient’s desire for withdrawal for any reason  
• Lost to follow -up (every effort must be made to contact the patient; a certified 
letter must be sent)  
• An AE that, in the opinion of the Investigator , necessitates withdrawal  
• Death  
• A patient’s substantial noncompliance (study drug compliance) or protocol violation  
• An Investigator’s opinion that continuing the patient in the study is not 
appropriate. The Investigator may withdraw a patient at any time if it is 
considered to be in the patient’s best interest  
A patient who withdraws from treatment prematurely will have EOT (Visit  6) 
assessments at the time of withdrawal and  a Follow -Up assessment (Visit  7) 
approximately 2 weeks following the last dose of study drug, and the patient will be recorded as withdrawn.

8.1 Identity of Study Drug  
Elobixibat and placebo will be supplied as tablets for oral administration during the 
Treatment phase of the study. White tablets con taining elobixibat or placebo will be 
provided.   
The elobixibat and placebo tablets will be identical in appearance. Tablet filling weight will also be identic al for elobixibat and placebo. Bottles containing 34 tablets will be 
given to the patient at each visit. Refer to the study reference manual.  
8.2 Administration of Study Drug  
Patients will be dosed with elobixibat at a dose of 5  mg or placebo once daily for 
16 weeks. Study drug will be dispensed to the patient at Visits  2-5 together with 
instructions on how to store and take the drug. Study drug compliance will be evaluated 
at each study visit.   
Elobixibat should be taken in the morning, prior to the first mea l. On clinic visit days 
when laboratory assessments are conducted, study drug should be taken af ter the visit and 
after laboratory samples are taken.   
8.3 Study Treatment Packaging and Labeling  
8.3.1 Packaging and Labeling 
The tablets will be packed in high -density polyethylene bottles, with child -proof 
polypropylene caps. Packaging and labeling will be prepa red to comply with applicable 
regulatory requirements.  
8.3.2 Storage 
Treatment bottles containing elobixibat tablets should be stored and dispensed in accordance with  regulations in their original containers. The storage facility at the 
investigative site should  be locked and the storage temperature should be between 15°C 
and 25°C.  
Caregivers should be informed of appropriate storag e conditions (i.e., room temperature,  
between 15°C and 25°C).

Confidential  Version  3.0 /10 September  2019  Page 40 of 70 Any deviations from the recommended storage conditions should be immedi ately 
reported to the Sponsor  and the study drug should not be used until authorization has 
been given by the Sponsor . 
8.3.3 Blinding and Randomization of Study Drug  
A double -blind design is employed so that both the investigators and the patients will be 
unawar e of the treatment assignment during the study.  
After written informed consent is obtained from an eligible patient, a 6-digit patient 
number will be assigned.  The first 3  digits will be the site number followed by a 3-digit 
patient sequence number. This number will be created and allocated by the site when the 
patient first enters at Screening. The randomization codes will be computer -generated by 
a statistician independent from the project team. The randomization will be done in 
blocks to ensure approximate balance between dose schemes (1:1). Randomization codes will be assigned sequentially as patients become eligible for randomization.  
Patients who are eligible for randomization will be assigned a unique 4- digit 
randomization number by the Interactive Web Response System  (IWRS ). This 
randomization number identifies which treatment will be allocated to the patient. Patients who withdraw from the study a fter randomization visit are not to be replaced and their 
randomization number will no t be reused.   
To ensure blinding, the study drug and the matching placebo have the same shape and size. Labels on the treatment bottles will not identify the treatment t o which a patient has 
been randomized. Traceability of the treatment is ensured by the bottle number.  
The 5 -digit bottle number will identify the study -drug bottle and will be detailed on the 
study- drug label. Dispensing of the study drug will be coordinated by IWRS.  
The system will assign a study -drug number corresponding to the randomiza tion arm. 
The randomization number will be used in the background only to ensure that there is no  
unblinding and will not be displayed to end- users in the IWRS.  
8.4 Procedur e for Breaking the Randomization Code  
Should a situation arise where unblinding is urgently required, i.e., only where knowledge of the study drug is required to adequately manage a life -threatening situation, 
Elobix AB  A3309 – 141078 
Module 5: Clinical Study Reports  
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol  
 
Confidential  Version  3.0 /10 September  2019  Page 41 of 70 the Investigator at that study site may perfor m immediate unblinding through IWRS. The 
responsibility to break the treatment code in  emergency situations resides solely with the 
Investigator . The Investigator should make every effort to discuss the rationale (status 
and outcome) for emergency unblindi ng with the Sponsor ’s Medical Monitor as soon as 
possible to review the individual patient details.  
The study -site Investigator and appropriate project team members will be authorized to 
access the emergency unblinding functionality within the IWRS. Once t he randomization 
code is broken for a patient, he/she must be withdrawn from the study and all assessments 
and procedures for Visit  6/EOT should be performed. Once a randomization code has 
been broken, the Investigator must inform the project team and Spon sor’s Medical 
Monitor  in writing within 24  hours. In case of technical issues accessing the system 
online, please see the IWRS site user manual for contact telephone numbers for the help 
desk 24/7 system support.  
8.5 Patient Compliance  
Patients will return all  unused study drug at  Visits  3 through 6. The study -site staff will 
count all returned drug, assess compliance, and record details in the eCRF.  
Any noncompliance will be documented and explained in the source documents.  
Treatment compliance = 100 × ( [numbe r of study drug dispe nsed—number of study drug 
returned ]/number of study drug that should be taken)  
Treatment compliance between 80% and 120% is acceptable.  
8.6 Study Drug Accountability  
Records shall be maintained of the delivery of study treatment(s) to the study site(s), of 
the inventory at the study site(s), of each use of the study treatment(s) for each patient 
and the return or destruction of used and unused study treatment(s). Local destruction of 
used/unused study treatment(s) will follow institution standard operating proc edures 
(SOPs) and will require Sponsor  pre-approval. 
These records shall include dates, quantities, batch numbers, expiry dates, and the unique code numbers assigned to the study drug and to the study patients.

that the patients were provided the quantities specified in the protocol and that all study 
drug received from the Sponsor  or its designee is reconciled.  
8.7 Concomitant Therapy and Prohibited Med ications 
The Investig ator will note all ongoing medication and any medication recently stopped 
(within 3  months prior to Visit  2) in the eCRF. At Visits  2 through 6, all changes in 
medication (stopping or starting new medication or changes in dose) will be recorded in 
the eCRF .   
All medications taken by a patient within 3  months prior to the first intake of study drug 
are regarded as prior medication.  
All medications taken by a patient on or after the first intake of study drug, and which continue to be ta ken during the study,  are regarded as concomitant medication.

The timing and frequency of safety assessments are described in Section  7.1.3 and in 
Table  1. 
The primary safety analysis will include the occurrence of treatment  emergent adverse 
events (TEAE) and TEAEs categorized by causality, severity, and seriousness 
assessments made by the  Investigator by comparing study drug exposure to placebo.  
Trends in safety will also be evaluated for the following assessments:  
• AEs, inclu ding discontinuations due to AEs  
• Physical examinations  
• Concomitant medications  
• Vital signs  
• 12-lead ECG  
• Laboratory te st results (including clinical chemistry, hematology/coagulation, and 
urinalysis)  
10.1 Adverse Events  
10.1.1  Definitions and Investigator Assessments 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in an enrolled patient regardless of causal relationship with stu dy drug. An AE can therefore be any clinically significant 
unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease that occurs once a patient  is 
enrolled (ICF is signed) in the study until the patient is discharged from the study, whether or not related to th e study drug.  
10.1.1.1 Clinical Significance  
Clinical significance is defined as any abnormal finding that results in further clinical investigatio n(s), treatment(s), or the diagnosis of a new condition. Patient  reported events 
and protocol mandated  laboratory va lues, vital signs, and physical examination findings 
can be considered clinically significant (i.e., an AE) if there is a deterioration as compared to Baseline . Examples of clinically significant worsening from Baseline could

Module 5: Clinical Study Reports  
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol  
 
Confidential  Version  3.0 /10 September  2019  Page 46 of 70 include, but is not limited to , events causing withdrawal from the study and events 
requiring medical intervention outside of the study causing apparent clinical 
manifes tations or judged to be relevant by the Investigator .   
10.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
Serious criteria are applied by the investigator to each AE as specifically defined below. These criteria are used to determine whether an AE is serious or non -serious. The 
assessment is made independently of severity assessment ( Section  10.1.1.3). For 
example, the development of a severe rash that occurs aft er signing of the ICF  may not 
meet serious criteria as defined below and therefore would be considered a severe, non-serious AE.  
Any AE that meets any 1 of the following 6 criteria is considered to be an SAE:  
• The outcome of the AE is death  
• The AE is immediately life-threatening . Life -threatening means that the patient 
is, in the opinion of the Investigator , at immediate risk of death from the reaction 
as it occurred. This does not i nclude an AE that, if more severe, might have 
caused death  
• The AE results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . Disability means 
a substantial disruption of a person ’s ability to conduct normal life functions  
• The AE requires or prolongs hospi talization   
• The AE results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• The AE is an important medical event . Important medical events may meet 
serious criteria should the Investigator assess that they may significantly 
jeopardize the patient, represent a significant hazard, or require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of potential 
SAEs based on th ese criteri a include, but are not limited to, allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room o r at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions even if they do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency and drug abuse.

An adverse event of special interest  (AESI)  should be recorded as an AE in the eCRF as 
outlined in Section 10.1.2 and reported using the SAE /AESI  Report Form outlined in 
Section 10.1.3.  
For this study, any occurrence of ischemic colit is should be reported as an AESI.  
10.1.1.4 Severity Assessment  
Severity assessments are based on the intensity of the event in relation to expectation. 
The Investigator will assess the intensity of AEs based on the following definitions:  
• Mild (awareness of sign or  symptom, but easily tolerated)  
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activi ties) 
Severity is a measure of intensity where seriousness is defined by the criter ia outlined in 
Section  10.1.1.2 . An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. 
For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not meet serious criteria, and therefore would be assessed as a severe AE but not an SAE.  
10.1.1.5 Causality Assessment  
The Investigator determines the causality of all AEs to the study drug using medical 
judgment and considering all relevant factors such as (but not l imited to) the underlying 
study indication, coexisting disease, concomitant medication, relevant history, pattern of 
the AE, temporal relationship to the study drug, and de -challenge or re -challenge. The 
causality assessment of the AE/SAE is to be made as follows : 
Related to Study D rug (Possibly, Probably, or Definitely Related ) 
Based on medical judgment, there is at least a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the event; one or more of the following criteria apply:  
• The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug

Confidential  Version  3.0 /10 September  2019  Page 48 of 70 • The event could not be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the 
patient ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy 
administered to the patient  
• The even t follows a known pattern o f response to study drug 
• The event disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug. (It should be noted that in some situations an AE will not disappear or decrease in intensity upon discontinuation of  study drug despite other c lear 
indications of relatedness)  
• The event reappears or worsens when the study drug is re- administered  
Unrelated to Study Drug (Unlikely or Unrelated ) 
Based on medical judgment there is no reasonable possibility that the study dr ug caused 
the event; one or more of the following criteria apply:  
• The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug 
• The event could be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient ’s clinical sta te, concurrent illness, environment or toxic factors, or other 
modes of therapy administered to the patient  
• The event does not follow a known pattern of response to study drug  
• The event does not disappear or decrease on cessation or reduction in dose of th e 
study drug, and it does  not reappear or worsen when the study drug is 
re-administered  
10.1.2  Recording of Adverse Events  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to assess whether each untoward event is a clinically 
significant worsening from Baseline , thereby c onsidered an AE. For all AEs, the severity, 
seriousness, and causality to study drug for each AE as outlined in Section  10.1.1 will be 
assessed and recorded i n the eCRF.  
All serious and non -seriou s AEs are collected once the patient has signed the ICF and 
until the post -treatment follow -up (Visit  7) or 14 days after the last dose of study drug.

Module 5: Clinical Study Reports  
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol  
 
Confidential  Version  3.0 /10 September  2019  Page 49 of 70 Any AEs or SAEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last  AE assessment are followed up 
by the Investigator until resolution or stabilization up to the database lock and recorded in 
the eCRF. The Sponsor  retains the right to request additional information for any patient 
with ongoing AE(s) or SAE(s) at the end of the study.  
TEAEs are defined as any AE that occurs after first dose of study drug. All AEs that 
occur in the Screening period , i.e., after enrollment and prior to randomization, will be 
collected on the eCRF as non -TEAEs.  
If there is a clinically significant deteriorat ion of a laboratory value/vital sign or other 
routine study assessment that is associated with a diagnosis,  the clinical diagnosis will be 
reported as an AE and the associated signs and symptoms will be considered additional 
information unless the sign or symptom is more severe than expected given the diagnosis. 
For example, if an Investigator diagnoses a study  patient with hepatitis during the study 
period, hepatitis would be considered the AE and the concomitant signs and symptoms of abdominal pain, vomit ing, and elevated ALT and AST would not be reported separately 
unless, in the opinion of the Investigator , one of these signs or symptoms is more severe 
than expected and therefore a separate AE assessment is indicated.  
10.1.3  Recording and Reporting of Serious A dverse Events  and Adverse 
Events of Special Interest  
Every SAE /AESI  (regardless of severity and causality) that occurs once the patient has 
signed the ICF and through 14 days after the final dose of study drug, should immediately 
and not later than within 24 hours of knowledge of the event, be reported by the 
Investigator or delegate using  the SAE /AESI  repor t form.  
Report of a SAE /AESI  must include at least the following information:  
• Patient identification information (study number, site number, and dat e of birth 
[as per local country requirements for data protection])  
• The last study drug administration date  
• The diagnosis of the event with the description (or a brief description of signs/symptoms/clinical course if the diagnosis is not available) and the  date of 
onset

Follow -up reports including all new information obtained of the subsequent course of the 
SAE/
AESI  must be prepared and the information collected in the SAE /AESI  report form 
submitted to the CRA, and  
 by e-ma
il within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.  
The phar
macovigilance manager (PVM)  or the CRA  may contact the Investigator to 
obtain further information on a reported SA E/AESI . The investigator/investigative staff 
must respond to any request for follow -up information or answers to questions regarding 
the SAE /AESI  within the same timelines as for initial reports.  
The PVM reports the occurrence of the SAE /AESI  and follow -up to the Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor for medical assessment of the case.  
Should an outcome  of death occur within the study period or within 14 days after the last 
administration of study drug, an SAE /AESI report  form should be completed including 
the main and  contributory causes of death.  
All SAE /AESI  repo rts must be e -mailed to the following e -mail address within 24 hours :

When close monitoring of a patient is not possible while the patient is on study drug, interrupt the study drug and closely monitor the patie nt. 
10.2.3  Demographics/Medical and Surgical History  
Demographic information per country regulations (age, full date of birth, gender, race, 
and ethnicity), along with medical and surgical history, will be obtained and recorded in the eCRF at Visit  1. 
Medical and  surgical history will be entered in the eCRF at Visit  1. This includes date of 
diagnosis of NASH/NAFLD  including liver biopsy results for biopsy -confirmed NASH 
patients within 6 months of screening, ongoing medication, any surgery performed, and any other diagnos es.   
10.2.4  Physical Examination  
A physician or suitabl y trained qualified assistant will perform a complete physical 
examination at Screening , at Visit  2, and at Visit  6. Height ( Screening only), weight, 
waist circumference, and waist -to-hip ratio will also be collected. BMI will be calculated 
based on height  and weight.  
A complete physical examination will include assessment of general appearance, eyes, ears, nose, throat, head/neck/thyroid, lymph nodes, cardiovascular, lungs/chest, abdomen, genito urinary, extremities, skin, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and o ther.

Elobixibat is minimally absorbed and has a very low systemic availability. It is not 
known whether elobixibat can be removed from the systemic circulation by dialysis. There  are no known antidotes for elobixibat overdoses. If an overdose occurs, the patient 
should be carefully monitored and treated with supportive therapy.  
10.2.8  Pregnancy  
If a pregnancy is discovered in a female patient enrolled in the study, the patient will be immediately discontinued from the study drug, if applicable, and  will attend the same 
visits as a prematurely withdrawn patient. If the pregnancy is discovered after completion of the treatment period, the patient will continue in the study per protocol. If a pregnancy 
occurs in a male patient’s partner at any time dur ing the study, the pregnancy should also 
be reported and followed.  
If the patient has been dosed wit h the study drug, the pregnancy must be recorded on the 
appropriate form and submitted to the PVM (Section 10.1.3) within 24 hours of learning 
of the p regnancy.  
The pregnancy should be followed to determine outcome, including spontaneous termination, details of birth and presence of any birth defects, congenital anomalies or newborn or maternal complication. While pr egnancy itself is not considered to be  an AE 
or SAE, any pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported as an AE or SAE.  A spontaneous abortion (occurring at <22 
weeks gestational age) or still birth (occurring at >22 weeks gestational age) is always 
considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such.  
Any post -study pregnancy related SAE considered reasonably related to the study 
intervention by the investigator will be reported as described in Section  10.1.3. While the 
investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.

The study team shall implement and maintain quality control and quality assurance 
procedures with written SOPs to ensure that the study is conducted , and data are 
generated, documented, and reported in compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP , and 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
This study sh all be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of 
Helsinki (October  1996) and all revisions thereof, and in accordance with US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) regulations (Code of Federal Regulations, Sections  312.50 
and 312.56) a nd with ICH GCP (CPMP  135/95). 
The Investigator may not deviate from the protocol without a formal protocol amendment 
having been established and approved by an appropriate competent authority and IRB, except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards t o the patient or when the 
change(s) involve(s) only logistical or administrative aspects of the stu dy. Any deviations 
may result in the patient having to be withdrawn from the study and render that patient non-evaluable.  
13.2 Study Monitoring  
Before study initi ation, at a site initiation visit or at an Investigator’s meeting, a  Sponsor  
representative or designee will review the protocol and eCRF with the Investigators and 
the investigative staff. During the study, the clinical monitor ( the CRA) will visit the si te 
regularly to check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy of entries on the eCRFs, th e adherence to the protocol and to GCP, the progress of enrollment, and to 
ensure that study drug is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications.  
The investigator must ensure that eCRFs are completed within a timely period of pat ient 
visits, as per individual site agreements, and must allow the CRA and the Sponsor  
representative or designee periodic access to patient records and all study- related 
materials, including relevant hospital or clinical records, to confirm their consiste ncy 
with the eCRF entries. No information in these records about the identity of the patients will leave the study center. The Sponsor  monitoring standards r equire full verification for 
the presence of the signed ICF, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria,

CRA will review source data compared with the eCRFs and will verify source data according to the study -specific monitoring plan. The design of the study, the freque ncy of 
patient visits, and the site enrollment rate will determine the frequency of monitoring visits. Upon study completion, the CRA will visit the site to conduct a study termination 
visit, which will include collection of any outstanding documentation.  
It is recommended that the Investigator /investigative staff log into the eCRF system every 
working day or at minimum twice weekly in order to provide a prompt response to queries. The Investigator /investigative staff should respond to queries and make any 
relevant changes to the study data within 3 working days.

14.1 Institutional Review Board  
Prior to the start of the study, the Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the protocol 
and consent form have been reviewed and approved by a relevant IRB. The IRB shall be 
appropriately constituted and perform its functions in accordance with FDA , ICH, GCP , 
and local requirements as applicable.  
The IRB shall ap prove all protocol amendments (except for logistical or administrative 
changes), written informed consent documents and document updates, patient recruitment procedures (e.g., advertisements), written information to be provided to the patients and caregivers, the Investigator’s Brochure, available safety information, information about 
payment and compensation available to patients, the Investigator’ s curriculum vitae 
and/or other evidence of qualifications and any other documents requested by the IRB and regulatory authority (competent authority) as applicable.  
14.2 Written Informed Consents  
The Investigator (physician) or investigative staff, in accordance with local regulations, 
will explain to each patient  (or legally authorized representative) the nature of the study, 
its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, alternative treatment, the potential risks and benefits involved, and any dis comfort that may occur. Each patient 
will be informed that participation in the study is voluntary and that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/h er 
subsequent medical treatment or relationship w ith the treating physician.  
If written consent is not possible, oral consent can be obtained if witnessed and followed by a signed statement from one or more persons not involved in the study, indicating why  
the patient was unable to sign the form. No patient can enter the study before his/her informed consent has been obtained, as required by country regulations.  
The ICF is part of the protocol and must be submitted by the Investigator/investigative 
staff wi th the protocol for IRB approval. The Sponsor will supply an ICF which complies 
with regulatory requirements and country laws and is considered appropriate for the study. Any changes to the ICF suggested by the Investigator must be agreed to by the 
Sponsor  before submission to the IRB and a copy of the approved version must be 
provided to the clinical monitor after IRB approval.

Title of Study: A Double -Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 2 Study to Explore the Efficacy and Safety of 
Elobixibat in Adults with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) or Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis 
(NASH)  
Principal Investigator:   
Study Centers:  Up to 15 sites will be initiated for this study in the United States (US)  
Publication(s): Not applicable  
Planned Study Period: Q2 2019 to Q2 2020  Development Phase: Phase 2  
Objectives:  
Primary Objective  
The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of repeated once -daily doses of 5 mg elobixibat on 
serum levels of low -density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) in patients with NAFLD or NASH.  
Secondary Objectives  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of elobixibat in patients with N AFLD or NASH  
• To evaluate the effect of elobixibat on liver steatosis as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for (i) liver fat fraction (using proton density fat fraction [PDFF]) and (ii) total liver fat (using whole liver fat volume)  
• To evaluate t he effect of elobixibat on liver function using alanine aminotransferase (ALT)  
• To evaluate the effect of elobixibat on lipids and serum bile acids (s -BA) in patients with NAFLD 
or NASH 
Methodology:  
This is a double -blind, randomized, placebo- controlled, Phase 2 study to explore the efficacy and safety 
of elobixibat (oral dose of 5 mg) once daily for 16 weeks in patients with NAFLD or NASH. The study 
includes a 6 -week Screening period, followed by a 16-week Treatment period, and a Follow -Up visit 
2 weeks a fter the last dose of study drug. Continued collection of efficacy data for patients who 
discontinue treatment will be made for as long as possible  per the schedule of assessments .  
After completing the Screening period, eligible patients will be randomize d on Day 1 (Visit  2) in a 1:1 
fashion to either 5  mg/day elobixibat or matching placebo. There will be a total of 7 scheduled visits 
during the study. Additional unscheduled visits may be required for patients who need direct site assistance (e.g., due to adverse event [AE] monitoring, in order to fulfill screening requirements, and/or 
for safety maintenance).   
Number of Patients: Approximately 46 patients diagnosed with NAFLD/NASH and in accordance with 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized .   
Inclusion Criteria:  
Patients must meet all of the following criteria to be included in the study: 
1. Be willing to participate in the study and provide written informed consent  
2. Be a man or woman ≥18 years of age  
3. Have a current biopsy -confirmed NASH withi n 6 months of screening or a suspected diagnosis 
of NAFLD/NASH based on the criteria outlined below:

Analysis Populations:  
• The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will include all patients who are randomized in the study 
and receive at least 1  dose of study drug. The ITT population will be used for all efficacy 
analyses based on the treatment randomized unless otherwise specified  
• The per protocol (PP) population will include all ITT patients who finish Visit 7/End of 
Treatment (EOT) with valid LDL-C measurements and do not have any major protocol 
deviations. Allocation of patients to the PP analysis set will be performed before unblinding of the study  
• The safety population will include all patients who are randomized and receive at least 1 dose of study drug and will be used for all safety analyses based on the treatment received  
• Summary statistics (number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) at all visits and change or percent change from Baseline will be provided  for 
efficacy and safety continuous variables. Count and frequency will be used to tabulate categorical variables  
• Demographics, disposition, and study populations will be summarized descriptively  
 
Efficacy: 
• The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from Baseline in serum LDL -C at Week 16. 
Baseline is defined as the last non -missing LDL-C value prior to the first dose of study drug  
• To address the potential missing data from patients who are lost to follow -up after treatment 
discontinuation, multiple imputation method will be used. Data from patients who discontinue 
the study drug but stay in the study with scheduled assessments collected will be used to impute missing values for patients lost to follow -up. T his imputation will be done within each 
treatment group. Interim missing data will be handled as missing at random (predictable from observed data from subjects in the same treatment group) 
• After the imputation is performed, an analysis of covariance (ANCO VA) will be used to 
analyze the primary efficacy endpoint. The model will include treatment arm and Baseline LDL-C scores  
• Least square (LS) mean (SE), LS mean difference (SE), 95% confidence intervals, and P-values between elobixibat 5 mg and placebo will be provided. The model assumptions will 
be checked before the analysis. If there are concerns on model assumptions, i.e., normality and homogeneity of variances, a non -parametric ANCOVA based on the rank scores can be used as 
a sensitivity analysis  
• Explora tory comparisons between elobixibat 5 mg and placebo will be performed for the 
following secondary efficacy endpoints:  
o Absolute change from Baseline to Week 16 in liver fat fraction (%) as measured by MRI-PDFF  
o Absolute change from Baseline to Week 16 in t otal liver fat (mL) as measured by MRI  
• The analysis methods for the other secondary endpoints and exploratory endpoints will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan for the study.  
 
Safety: 
• The safety endpoints for this study include clinical laborator y assessments, vital signs, AEs, 
ECGs, physical examinations, and concomitant medications  
• AEs will be coded using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedRA). TEAEs will be defined as AEs that are new or worsening after t he first dose of study 
drug. A general summary of patients with TEAEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) /adverse

5.1 Investigational Medicinal Product  
Elobixibat is a potent inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT ; also known as the 
apical sodium bile acid transporter [ASBT ]). The IBAT, expressed mainly in the distal 
ileum, is a key element in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids because it facilitates 
the very efficient process of bile acid reabsorption. Elobixibat is orally administered and 
acts locally in the gut where it binds reversibly to the IBAT to decrease the reuptake of bile acids to the liver. Elobixibat has minimal systemic exposure at expected therapeutic dose ranges.  
5.2 Background 
5.2.1 Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Nonalcoholic 
Steatohepatitis (NASH)  
Recent data suggest that bile acids may pla y an important role in NASH pathogenesis 
(Ferslew 2015; Aranha 2008; Puri 2018). Bile acids are signaling molecules involved in 
lipid, glucose , and energy homeostasis, which are metabolic pathways linked to 
NAFLD/NASH and comorbidities such as metabolic syndrome, obesity , and diabetes. 
Bile acids as well as free cholesterol, which is the precursor from which bile acids are 
synthesized, can act as  lipotoxic agents that drive inflammation and fibrosis. Studies have 
shown that both serum and liver bile acids are increased in patients with NASH, and 
recent data have suggested that the presence and severity of NASH is associated with specific changes i n circulating bile acids ( Puri 2018). Thus, targeting of bile acid 
pathways has therapeutic potential in  patients with  NASH.  
The enterohepatic circulation of bile acids plays a crucial role in whole body sterol balance. Bile acids are secreted to the intestine via the bile duct and then reabsorbed, mainly by a specific bile acid transporter located in the ileum (IBAT or ASBT) and delivered back to the liver, completing the enterohepatic circulation ( Prawitt 2011 ).  
Bile acid reabsorption from the intestine is a very efficient process where 95% of the 
secreted bile acids are reabsorbed and IBAT appears to be the major regulator of the bile acid pool in animals and humans. IBAT inhibitors reduce the reabsorption of bile acids 
from the ileum and prevent their return to the liver. The liver compensates for the 
decrease in bile acid level s by upregulating cholesterol 7α- hydroxylase, the rate- limiting

Module 5: Clinical Study Reports

Confidential  Version 2.0 /22 Mar 2019  Page 19 of 70 enzyme for bile acid synthesis. This results in lower hepatic cholesterol levels an d an 
increased number of low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptors in the liver leading to 
reduced plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL -C; [ Bertolotti 2003; 
Naoumova  1999]) . Bile acids also positively regulate glucagon- like peptide -1 (GLP -1) 
levels via activation of TGR5 ( Prawitt  2011; Schaap  2014). GLP -1 is an insulinotropic 
hormone but has many other roles , e.g., slowing gastric emptying and increasing satiety 
signals leading to weight loss ( Andersen 2018).  
Inhibition of bile acid absorption locally in the intestine has the potential to positively 
influence NASH, cardiovascul ar disease,  and metabolic disease by targeting multiple 
mechanisms , as follows : lowering of LDL -C by increased bile acid synthesis ; improving 
metabolic status and weight loss by increasing GLP -1 levels ; and reducing hepatic cell 
damage by lowering toxic bi le acid and free cholesterol in the liver.  
5.2.2 Summary of Nonclinical Studies in NASH  
One nonclinical study with elobixibat in a NASH model has been completed. The study evaluated the effects of elobixibat in leptin -deficient ob/ob mice treated with a diet high 
in trans  fats, fructose , and cholesterol. Although elobixibat did not reduce liver NAFLD 
activity score or fibrosis stage, there were indicators of relevant effects, including 
reduction in liver  alpha -smooth muscle actin  (α-S MA), which is a marker of stellate cell 
activation and thereby an indirect marker for fibrosis formation. Administration of 10 and 30 mg/kg/day elobixibat decreased liver steatosis as quantified by lipid fractional area in 
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) -stained liver sections in a dose- dependent fashion. This 
was further evident in animals treated with 30  mg/kg elobixibat that showed reduced liver 
triglycerides and liver total cholesterol as determined by biochemical analyses. Analysis of liver gene expression  by next generation RNA sequencing revealed pronounced and 
dose-dependent effects of elobixibat. It affected the expression of genes in key pathways 
associated with NASH pathology.  
Additional nonclinical studies with elobixibat are summarized in the Invest igator ’s 
Brochure  (M1.14.4.1). 
5.3 Rationale 
Bile acids act as signaling molecules in lipid, glucose , and energy homeostasis. Studies 
have shown that both serum and liver bile acids are increased in patients with NASH 
Elobix AB  A3309 – 141078 
Module 5: Clinical Study Reports  
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol  
 
Confidential  Version 2.0 /22 Mar 2019  Page 20 of 70 (Ferslew  2015), and recent data have suggested that the presence and severity of NASH 
is associated with specific changes in circulating bile acids ( Puri 2018; Sanyal  2018). 
Inhibition of bile acid absorpti on from the intestine has the potential to improve the 
pathophysiology in NASH, including the related cardiovascular and metabolic disease 
due to impingement on multiple key metabolic feedback mechanisms , as follows : 
lowering of LDL -C by increased bile aci d synthesis, and improving insulin sensitivity by 
increasing GLP -1 levels. A reduction of cardiovascular risk is particularly desirable for 
any pharmacological NASH  treatment, because cardiovascular complications contribute 
to a significant amount of morta lity in patients with NAFLD/NASH, with their annual 
risk being 2- fold increased ( Mahfood  Haddad  2017; Younossi  2018). IBAT inhibition 
reduces the levels of bile acid that circulate to the liver, and triggers increased hepatic bile acid synthesis from cholesterol. Thus, besides having a positive impact on cardiovascular health, IBAT inhibition might also reduce hepatic cell damage by lowering free cholesterol and changing the composition  of toxic bile acids in the liver.  
5.4 Risk/Benefit  
Elobixibat is orally administered and acts locally in the gut where it binds reversibly to the IBAT to decrease the reuptake of bile acids into the liver, thereby increasing the concentration of bile acids in  the colon. Due to its mechanism of action, most adverse 
events  (AEs)  are gastrointestinal ( GI) tract disorders, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, 
abdominal distention, flatulence , and nausea ; the incidence of these has increased with 
increasing dose levels. Diarrhea has been the most prominent dose -limiting side effect. 
No clinically significant findings in laboratory measures or electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) 
have been reported. Based on postmarketing case reporting, ischemic colitis will be 
monitored as an adverse event of special interest for elobixibat.  
There is no established benefit for subjects participating in this Phase 2 study. Based 
upon these data, the risk/benefit for subjects participa ting in this trial is acceptable.  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and with the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on GCP.

7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
7.1.1 Description  
This is a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, Phase 2 study to explore the 
efficacy and safety of elobixibat (oral dose of 5  mg) once daily for 16 weeks in patients 
with NAFLD or NASH. The study includes a 6- week Screening Period, followed by a 
16-week Treatment Period, and a Follow -Up Visit 2 weeks after the l ast dose of study 
drug. Continued collection of efficacy data for patients who discontinue treatment will be 
made for as long as possible  as per the schedule of assessments  (Table  1).  
After completing the Screening Period, eligible patients will be randomized on Day  1 
(Visit  2) in a 1:1 fashion to either 5 mg/day elobixibat or matching placebo. Visit 
windows applicable to each visit are presented in the schedule of assessments ( Table  1). 
There will be up to 7 clinic visits during the study , as follows:  
• Visit 1: Screening period (Week -6 through Day -1) 
• Visit 2: Day 1/ Randomization visit  
• Visit 3: Week 4  
• Visit 4: Week 8  
• Visit 5: Week 12 
• Visit 6: Week 16/End of Treatment (EOT). Any patient that discontinues treatment prematurely should complete this visit at the time of discontinuation  
• Visit 7: Follow -Up period . The Follow -Up visit will occur 2 weeks after the last 
dose of study drug whether the patient completes the study or discontinues prematurely 
Additional unscheduled visits may be required for patients who need direct site assistance (due to AE monitoring , in order to fulfill screening requirements, and/or for safety 
maintenance).

Confidential  Version 2.0 /22 Mar 2019  Page 37 of 70 7.2.3 Withdrawal of Patients  
Patients will be informed that they have the right to withdraw from the study at any time, 
without prejudice to their medical care, and that they are not obliged to state their reasons.  
Any withdrawal, and reasons for withdrawal, must be fully documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF) and source documents and the patient followed by the investigator/investigative staff. Even after the study is completed at the Follow -Up visit, 
the investigator/investiga tive staff will, regardless of reason for withdrawal, record any 
patient data they receive concerning serious adverse events ( SAEs ), and all drug- related 
non-serious AEs, and report these in the eCRF. Withdrawn patients will not be replaced.  
Patients will be withdrawn in the following circumstances:  
• A patient’s desire for withdrawal for any reason  
• Lost to follow -up (every effort must be made to contact the patient; a certified 
letter must be sent)  
• An AE that, in the opinion of the Investigator , necessitates  withdrawal  
• Death  
• A patient’s substantial noncompliance (study drug compliance) or protocol violation  
• An Investigator’s opinion that continuing the patient in the study is not 
appropriate. The Investigator may withdraw a patient at any time if it is 
consid ered to be in the patient’s best interest  
A patient who withdraws from treatment prematurely will have EOT (Visit  6) 
assessments at the time of withdrawal and a Follow -Up assessment (Visit  7) 
approximately 2 weeks following the last dose of study drug, and the patient will be recorded as withdrawn.  
7.2.4 Study Termination by Sponsor  
This study may be terminated at any time by the Sponsor  if serious side effects should 
occur, if the Investigator does not adhere to the protocol , or if, in the Sponsor 's judgment,

Confidential  Version 2.0 /22 Mar 2019  Page 38 of 70 there are no further benefits to be achieved from the study. In this event, the Sponsor  or 
its designee will inform the study investigators, institutions, and all regulator y authorities.  
The Sponsor may temporarily or permanently discontinue the study at an investigative 
site at any time for safety, ethical, compliance, or other reasons. If this is necessary, the 
Sponsor  will endeavor to provide advance notification to the s ite. If a site or the study is 
suspended or discontinued, the Investigator /investigative staff will be responsible for 
promptly informing the IRB. If required by local regulations, the Sponsor or its designee 
will be responsible for informing the IRB and t he regulatory authority of study or site 
discontinuation. In such an event, all study data and unused study drug must be returned to the Sponsor or its designee.

Confidential  Version 2.0 /22 Mar 2019  Page 39 of 70 8. TREATMENT OF PATIENTS 
8.1 Identity of Study Drug  
Elobixibat and placebo will be supplied as tablet s for oral administration during the 
Treatment phase of the study. White tablets containing elobixibat or placebo will be 
provided.   
The elobixibat and placebo tablets will be identical in appearance. Tablet filling weight 
will also be identical for elobixibat and placebo. Bottles containing 34 tablets will be 
given to the patient at each visit. Refer to the study reference manual.  
8.2 Administration of Study Drug  
Patients will be dosed with elobixibat at a dose of 5  mg or placebo once daily for 
16 weeks. Study drug will be dispensed to the patient at Visits  2-5 together with 
instructions on how to store and take the drug. Study drug compliance will be evaluated at each study visit.   
Elobixibat should be taken in the morning, prior to the first meal. On cl inic visit days 
when laboratory assessments are conducted, study drug should be taken after the visit and after laboratory samples are taken.   
8.3 Study Treatment Packaging and Labeling  
8.3.1 Packaging and Labeling 
The tablets will be packed in high -density polyethylene bottles, with child -proof 
polypropylene caps. Packaging and labeling will be prepared to comply with applicable regulatory requirements.  
8.3.2 Storage 
Treatment bottles containing elobixibat tablets should be stored and dispensed in accordance with regulations in their original containers. The storage facility at the investigative site should be locked and the storage temperature should be between 15°C and 25°C.  
Caregivers should be informed of appropriate storag e conditions (i.e., room temperature, 
between  15°C and 25°C).

Confidential  Version 2.0 /22 Mar 2019  Page 40 of 70 Any deviations from the recommended storage conditions should be immediately 
reported to the Sponsor  and the study drug should not be used until authorization has 
been given by the Sponsor . 
8.3.3 Blinding and Randomization of Study Drug  
A double -blind design is employed so that both the investigators and the patients will be 
unaware of the treatment assignment during the study.  
After written informed consent is obtained from an eligible patient, a 6-digit patient 
number will be assigned. The fir st 3 digits will be the site number followed by a 3-digit 
patient sequence number. This number will be created and allocated by the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS), when the patient first enters the system at Screening. The randomization codes will be computer -generated by a statistician independent from the 
project team. The randomization will be done in blocks to ensure approximate balance between dose schemes (1:1). Randomization codes will be assigned sequentially as patients become eligible for randomization.  
Patients who are eligible for randomization will be assigned a unique 4 -digit 
randomization number by IWRS. This randomization number identifies which treatment will be allocated to the patient. Patients who withdraw from the study after ran domization 
visit are not to be replaced and their randomization number will not be reused.   
To ensure blinding, the study drug and the matching placebo have the same shape and size. Labels on the treatment bottles will not identify the treatment to which a patient has 
been randomized. Traceability of the treatment is ensured by the bottle number.  
The 5 -digit bottle number will identify the study -drug bottle and will be detailed on the 
study- drug label. Dispensing of the study drug will be coordinated by IW RS.  
The system will assign a study -drug number corresponding to the randomization arm. 
The randomization number will be used in the background only to ensure that there is no  
unblinding and will not be displayed to end- users in the IWRS.  
8.4 Procedure for Breaking the Randomization Code  
Should a situation arise where unblinding is urgently required, i.e., only where knowledge of the study drug is required to adequately manage a life -threatening situation, 
Elobix AB  A3309 – 141078 
Module 5: Clinical Study Reports  
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol

responsibility to break the treatment code in emergency situations resides solely with the 
Investigator . The Investigator should make every effort to discuss the rationale (status 
and outcome) for emergency unblinding wit h the Sponsor ’s Medical Monitor as soon as 
possible to review the individual patient details.  
The study -site Investigator and appropriate project team members will be authorized to 
access the emergency unblinding functionality within the IWRS. Once the ran domization 
code is broken for a patient, he/she must be withdrawn from the study and all assessments and procedures for Visit  6/EOT should be performed. Once a randomization code has 
been broken, the Investigator must inform the project team and Sponsor ’s Medical 
Monitor in writing within 24 hours. In case of technical issues accessing the system 
online, please see the IWRS site user manual for contact telephone numbers for the help 
desk 24/7 system support.  
8.5 Patient Compliance  
Patients will return all unuse d study drug at Visits  3 through 6. The study -site staff will 
count all returned drug, assess compliance, and record details in the eCRF.  
Any noncompliance will be documented and explained in the source documents.  
Treatment compliance = 100 × ( [number of study drug dispensed— number of study drug 
returned ]/number of study drug that should be taken)  
Treatment compliance between 80% and 120% is acceptable.  
8.6 Study Drug Accountability  
Records shall be maintained of the delivery of study treatment(s) to the study site(s), of the inventory at the study site(s), of each use of the study treatment(s) for each patient and the return or destruction of used and unused study treatment(s). Local  destruction of 
used/unused study treatment(s) will follow institution standard operating procedures 
(SOPs) and will require Sponsor  pre-approval. 
These records shall include dates, quantities, batch numbers, expiry dates, and the unique code numbers assig ned to the study drug and to the study patients.

The timing and frequency of safety assessments are described in Section  7.1.3 and in 
Table  1. 
The primary safety analysis will include the occurrence of treatment -emergent adverse 
events (TEAE) and TEAEs categorized by causality, severity, and seriousness 
assessments made by the Investigator by comparing study drug exposure to placebo.  
Trends in safety will also be ev aluated for the following assessments:  
• AEs, including discontinuations due to AEs  
• Physical examinations  
• Concomitant medications  
• Vital signs  
• 12-lead ECG  
• Laboratory test results (including clinical chemistry, hematology/coagulation, and 
urinalysis)  
10.1 Adverse E vents  
10.1.1  Definitions and Investigator Assessments 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in an enrolled patient regardless of causal relationship with study drug. An AE can therefore be any clinically significant unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease that occurs once a patient is 
enrolled (ICF is signed) in the study until the patient is discharged from the study, whether or not related to the study drug.  
10.1.1.1 Clinical Significance  
Clinical significance is defined as any abnormal finding  that results in further clinical 
investigation(s), treatment(s), or the diagnosis of a new condition. Patient -reported events 
and protocol -mandated laboratory values, vital signs, and physical examination findings 
can be considered clinically significant (i.e., an AE) if there is a deterioration as compared to Baseline . Examples of clinically significant worsening from Baseline could

Module 5: Clinical Study Reports  
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol  
 
Confidential  Version 2.0 /22 Mar 2019  Page 46 of 70 include, but is not limited to, events causing withdrawal from the study and events 
requiring medical intervention outside o f the study causing apparent clinical 
manifestations or judged to be relevant by the Investigator .   
10.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
Serious criteria are applied by the investigator to each AE as specifically defined below. These criteria are used to determine whet her an AE is serious or non- serious. The 
assessment is made independently of severity assessment ( Section  10.1.1.3). For 
example, th e development of a severe rash that occurs after signing of the ICF  may not 
meet serious criteria as defined below and therefore would be considered a severe, non-serious AE.  
Any AE that meets any 1 of the following 6 criteria is considered to be an SAE:  
• The outcome of the AE is death  
• The AE is immediately life-threatening . Life -threatening means that the patient 
is, in the opinion of the Investigator , at immediate risk of death from the reaction 
as it occurred. This does not include an AE that, if more severe, might have 
caused death  
• The AE results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . Disability means 
a substantial disruption of a person ’s ability to conduct normal life functions  
• The AE requires or prolongs hospitalization   
• The AE results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• The AE is an important medical event . Important medical events may meet 
serious criteria should the Investigator assess that they may significantly 
jeopardize the patient, represent a significant hazard, or require medi cal/surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of potential SAEs based on th ese criteri a include, but are not limited to, allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions even if they do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency and drug abuse.

M5.3.5.1 – Protocol  
 
Confidential  Version 2.0 /22 Mar 2019  Page 47 of 70 10.1.1.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An adverse event of special interest  (AESI)  should be recorded as an AE in the eCRF as 
outlined in Section 10.1.2 and reported using the SAE /AESI  Report Form outlined in 
Section 10.1.3.  
For this study, any occurrence of ischemic colitis  should be reported as an AESI.  
10.1.1.4 Severity Assessment  
Severity assessments are based on the intensity of the event in relation to expectation. 
The Investigator will assess the intensity of AEs based on the following definitions:  
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)  
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
Severity is a measure of intensity where seriousness is defined by the criteria outlined in Section  10.1.1.2 . An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. 
For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not meet serious criteria, and therefore would be assessed as a severe AE but n ot an SAE.  
10.1.1.5 Causality Assessment  
The Investigator determines the causality of all AEs to the study drug using medical 
judgment and considering all relevant factors such as (but not limited to) the underlying study indication, coexisting disease, concomitant  medication, relevant history, pattern of 
the AE, temporal relationship to the study drug, and de -challenge or re -challenge. The 
causality assessment of the AE/SAE is to be made as follows : 
Related to Study Drug (Possibly, Probably, or Definitely Related ) 
Based on medical judgment, there is at least a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the event; one or more of the following criteria apply:  
• The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug 
Elobix AB  A3309 – 141078 
Module 5: Clinical Study Reports  
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol  
 
Confidential  Version 2.0 /22 Mar 2019  Page 48 of 70 • The event could not be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the 
patient ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy 
administered to the patient  
• The event follows a known pattern of response to study drug 
• The event disappears or  decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the study 
drug. (It should be noted that in some situations an AE will not disappear or 
decrease in intensity upon discontinuation of study drug despite other clear indications of relatedness)  
• The event reapp ears or worsens when the study drug is re -administered  
Unrelated to Study Drug (Unlikely or Unrelated ) 
Based on medical judgment there is no reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the event; one or more of the following criteria apply:  
• The event  does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
study drug 
• The event could be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient ’s clinical state, concurrent illness, environment or toxic factors, or other 
modes of the rapy administered to the patient  
• The event does not follow a known pattern of response to study drug  
• The event does not disappear or decrease on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug, and it does not reappear or worsen when the study drug is re-administered  
10.1.2  Recording of Adverse Events  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to assess whether each untoward event is a clinically 
significant worsening from Baseline , thereby considered an AE. For all AEs, the severity, 
seriousness, and causality to s tudy drug for each AE as outlined in Section  10.1.1 will be 
assessed and recorded in the eCRF.  
Elobix AB  A3309 – 141078 
Module 5: Clinical Study Reports  
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol  
 
Confidential  Version 2.0 /22 Mar 2019  Page 49 of 70 All serious and non -serious AEs are collected once the caregiver/patient has signed the 
ICF and until the post -treatment follow -up (Visit  7) or 14 days after the last dose of study 
drug. 
Any AEs or SAEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last AE assessment are followed up 
by the Investigator  until resolution or stabilization up to the database lock and recorded in 
the eCRF. The Sponsor  retains the right to request additional information for any patient 
with ongoing AE(s) or SAE(s) at the end of the study.  
TEAEs are defined as any AE that occurs after randomization (Day  1). All AEs that 
occur in the Screening period , i.e., after enrollment and prior to randomization, will be 
collected on the eCRF as non -TEAEs.  
If there is a clinically significant deterioration of a laboratory value/vital sign or other routine study assessment that is associated with a diagnosis, the clinical diagnosis will be reported as an AE and the associated signs and symptoms will be consid ered additional 
information unless the sign or symptom is more severe than expected given the diagnosis. For example, if an Investigator diagnoses a study patient with hepatitis during the study 
period, hepatitis would be considered the AE and the concomit ant signs and symptoms of 
abdominal pain, vomiting, and elevated ALT and AST would not be reported separately unless, in the opinion of the Investigator , one of these signs or symptoms is more severe 
than expected and therefore a separate AE assessment is indicated.  
10.1.3  Recording and Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  and Adverse 
Events of Special Interest  
Every SAE /AESI  (regardless of severity and causality) that occurs once the patient has 
signed the ICF and through 14 days after the final dose of study drug, should immediately 
and not later than within 24  hours of knowledge of the event, be reported by the 
Investigator or delegate in the SAE /AESI  report form.  
Report of a SAE /AESI  must include at least the following information:  
• Patient identification inform ation (study number, site number, and date of birth 
[as per local country requirements for data protection])  
• The last study drug administration date  
Elobix AB  A3309 – 141078 
Module 5: Clinical Study Reports

Confidential  Version 2.0 /22 Mar 2019  Page 50 of 70 • The diagnosis of the event with the description (or a brief description of 
signs/symptoms/clinical course if the diagnosis is not available) and the date of onset  
• The action used to treat the event (i.e., treatment medications, temporary discontinuation)  
• The reason(s) for considering the event serious  
• The relationship of the event to the study drug or to the st udy procedure (i.e., the 
Investigator ’s assessment of causality)  
• A brief narrative of the SAE /AESI  
Follow -up reports including all new information obtained of the subsequent course of the 
SAE/AESI  must be prepared and the information collected in the SAE /AESI report form 
submitted to the CRA,  
 by e-mail within 24  hours of knowledge of the event.  
The pharmacovigilance manager (PVM)  of the CRA  may contact the Investigator to 
obtain f urther information on a reported SAE /AESI . The investigator/investigative staff 
must respond to any request for follow -up information or answers to questions regarding 
the SAE /AESI  within the same timelines as for initial reports.  
The PVM reports the occurrence of the SAE /AESI  and follow -up to the Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor for medical assessment of the case.  
Should an outcome of death occur within the study period or within 14 days after the last 
administration of study drug, an SAE /AESI report  form should be completed including 
the main and contributory causes of death.  
All SAE /AESI  reports must be e -mailed to the following e -mail address within 24 hours : 
 
If email is unavailable, SAEs /AESIs  may be transmitted via fax to the following number:

10.2.2.1 Liver Monitoring 
Strategies to monitor markers of liver disease throughout the study are outlined below 
where the ULN will be based on central laboratory reference values for age and gender. Patients will be monitored as described below for drug -induced liver injury from 
randomization to 2 weeks following the last administration of study drug . 
Elevated ALT  
• ALT >5 × ULN or >3 × Baseline (if ALT elevated at Baseline ): repeat AST, 
ALT, total bilirubin, a lkaline phosphatase (ALP), and INR within 72 hours and 
closely monitor the patient. If liver enzyme elevation is confirmed, interrupt the study drug. The study drug can be restarted only if a competing etiology is identified or liver tests return to Baseline. 
Elevated AST  
• AST >5 × ULN or 3 × baseline (if AST elevated at baseline): repeat AST, ALT, total bilirubin, ALP, and INR within 72 hours and closely monitor the patient. If liver enzyme elevation confirmed, interrupt the study drug. The study drug can be 
restarted only if a competing etiology is identified or liver tests return to Baseline . 
Elevated Total Bilirubin  
• Total bilirubin >2 × ULN or >1.5 × Baseline (if total bilirubin elevated at 
Baseline ), regardless of ALT or AST levels: repeat AST, ALT, tot al bilirubin, 
ALP, and INR within 72 hours and closely monitor the patient. If liver enzyme elevation confirmed, interrupt the study drug. The study drug can be restarted only if a competing etiology is identified or liver tests return to Baseline . 
Other Clinical Symptoms  
• Clinical signs of hepatitis or indicators of immunological reaction (e.g., nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, loss of appetite, dark urine, jaundice, rash, eosinophilia >5% or symptoms/signs of hepatic decompensation): discontinue the

and closely monitor. Other causes of hepatitis should be excluded.  
When close monitoring of a patient is not possible while the patient is on study drug, interrupt the study drug and close ly monitor the patient.  
10.2.3  Demographics/Medical and Surgical History  
Demographic information per country regulations (age, full date of birth, gender, race, and ethnicity), along with medical and surgical history, will be obtained and recorded in the eCRF at Visit  1. 
Medical and surgical history will be entered in the eCRF at Visit  1. This includes date of 
diagnosis of NASH/NAFLD , ongoing medication, any surgery performed, and any other 
diagnos es.   
10.2.4  Physical Examination  
A physician or suitably trained qualifie d assistant will perform a complete physical 
examination at Screening , at Visit  2, and at Visit  6. Height ( Screening only), weight, 
waist circumference, and waist -to-hip ratio will also be collected. BMI will be calculated 
based on height and weight.  
A com plete physical examination will include assessment of general appearance, eyes, 
ears, nose, throat, head/neck/thyroid, lymph nodes, cardiovascular, lungs/chest, abdomen, genitourinary, extremities, skin, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and other.  
10.2.5  Vital Signs  
Evaluation of vital signs will be performed at all visits. This includes blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), pulse, respiratory rate, and oral temperature.  
10.2.6  12-Lead ECG  
A 12 -lead ECG will be performed at the Screening visit and the EOT visits.

10.2.8  Pregnancy  
If a pregnancy is discovered in a female patient enrolled in the study, the patient will be 
immediately discontinued from the study drug, if applicable, and will attend the s ame 
visits as a prematurely withdrawn patient. If the pregnancy is discovered after completion of the treatment period, the patient will continue in the study per protocol. If a pregnancy 
occurs in a male patient’s partner at any time during the study, the pregnancy should also 
be reported and followed.  
If the patient has been dosed with the study drug, the pregnancy must be recorded on the 
appropriate form and submitted to the PVM (Section 10.1.3) within 24 hours of learning 
of the pregnancy.  
The pregnancy should be followed to determine outcome, including spontaneous termination, details of birth and presence of any birth defects, congenital anomalies or newborn or maternal complication. While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical 
reasons will be reported as an AE or SAE.  A spontaneous abortion (occurring at <22 
weeks gestational age) or still birth (occurring at >22 weeks gestational age) is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such.  
Any post -study pregnancy related SAE considered reasonably related to the study 
intervention by the investigator will be reported as described in Section 10.1.3. While the 
investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.

11.2.2.1 General Principles  
Summary s tatistics (number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum) at all visits and change or percent change from Baseline will be provided for 
efficacy and safety continuous variables. Count and frequency will be used to tabulate 
categorical variables.  
11.2.2.1.1  Efficacy  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from Baseline in serum LDL -C at Week  16. 
Baseline is defined as the last non -missing LDL -C value prior to the first dose of study 
drug.  
Exploratory comparisons between elobixibat 5  mg and placebo will be performed for the 
following secondary efficacy endpoints:   
• Absolute change from Baseline to Week  16 in liver fat fraction (%) as measured 
by MRI -PDFF 
• Absolute change from Baseline to Week  16 in total liver fat (mL) as measured by 
MRI  
The analysis methods for the other secondary and exploratory endpoints will be detailed 
in the statistical analysis plan  (SAP).  
11.2.2.1.2  Safety  
The safety endpoints for this study include clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, AEs, ECGs, physical examination s, and concomitant medications.  
AEs will be coded using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities  (MedRA) . TEAEs will be defined as AEs that are new or worsening after the 
first dose of study drug. A general summary of patients  with TEAEs and serious adverse 
events (SAEs) will be tabulated with numbers and percentages of patients and repeated for severity and relationship to study drug per treatment group. The number of AEs 
leading to withdrawal and SAEs leading to death will al so be summarized. The incidence 
of TEAEs will be summarized by body system and treatment group.

Confidential  Version 2.0 /22 Mar 2019  Page 59 of 70 The safety laboratory data will be summarized by visit and by treatment group, along 
with changes from Baseline . Values outside of the reference range will be f lagged and 
laboratory abnormalities of special interest will be summarized.  
11.2.2.2 Missing Data  
Continued collection of efficacy data for patients who discontinue treatment will be made for as long  as possible  as per the schedule of assessments  (Table  1). Missing data 
handling for the primary efficacy endpoint is specified under Section  11.2.2.6. Details on 
missing data handling for secondary and exploratory endpoints will be specified in the SAP.  
11.2.2.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive summaries of demographics and other baseline characteristics (including 
medical and surgical history) will be presented by treatment group and overall using the ITT population.  
Prior medication will be summarized by treatment group and overall using the ITT population. 
11.2.2.4 Subject Disposition  
The follow ing will be summarized  descriptively (by treatment group and overall where 
applicable):  
• Patients enrolled (who signed the informed consent)  
• Patients randomized  
• Patients treated  
• Patients completing the study  
• Patients withdrawing early (including withdrawal reason)  
11.2.2.5 Evaluation of Primary Efficacy Endpoints  
To address the potential missing data from patients who are lost to follow -up after 
treatment discontinuation, multiple imputation method will be used. Data from patients 
who discontinue the study drug but s tay in the study with scheduled assessments

Confidential  Version 2.0 /22 Mar 2019  Page 60 of 70 collected will be used to impute missing values for patients lost to follow -up. This 
imputation will be done within each treatment group. Interim missing data will be 
handled as missing at random (predictable from observed data from subjects in the same treatment group).  
After the imputation is performed, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to analyze the primary efficacy endpoint. The model will include treatment arm and Baseline LDL- C scores.  
Least  square (LS) mean (SE), LS mean difference (SE), 95% confidence intervals, and 
P-values between elobixibat 5 mg and placebo will be provided. The model assumptions 
will be checked before the analysis. If there are concerns on model assumptions, i.e., norma lity and homogeneity of variances, a non- parametric ANCOVA based on the rank 
scores can be used as a sensitivity analysis.  
Sensitivity analyses may be performed and will be detailed in the SAP.  
11.2.2.6 Evaluation of Secondary and Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for secondary and exploratory endpoints listed in 
Sections  9.1.2 and 9.1.3, respectively,  unless otherwise specified.  
11.2.2.7 Evaluation of Safety Endpoints  
Safety data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and summaries by treatment group of SAEs, AEs, vital signs,  clinical safety laboratory tests (hematology, coagulation, 
clinical chemistry , and urinalysis), and concomitant medication. Analyses will be 
performed using the safety analysis set.

13.1 Conduct of the Study  
The study team shall implement and maintain quality control and quality assurance 
procedures with written SOPs to ensure that the study is conducted , and data are 
generated, documented, and reported in compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP , and 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
This study shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki (October  1996) and all revisions thereof, and in accordance with US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) regulations (Code of Federal Regulations, Sections  312.50 
and 312.56) and with ICH GCP (CPMP  135/95). 
The Investigator may not deviate from the protocol without a formal protocol amendment 
having been e stablished and approved by an appropriate competent authority and IRB, 
except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the patient or when the change(s) involve(s) only logistical or administrative aspects of the study. Any deviations may result in  the patient having to be withdrawn from the study and render that patient 
non-evaluable.  
13.2 Study Monitoring  
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an Investigator’s meeting, a  Sponsor  
representative or designee will review the protocol an d eCRF with the Investigators and 
the investigative staff. During the study, the clinical monitor ( the CRA) will visit the site 
regularly to check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy of entries on the eCRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to GCP, the progress of enrollment, and to 
ensure that study drug is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications.  
The investigator must ensure that eCRFs are completed within a timely period of patient visits, as per individual s ite agreements, and must allow the CRA and the Sponsor  
representative or designee periodic access to patient records and all study -related 
materials, including relevant hospital or clinical records, to confirm their consistency with the eCRF entries. No in formation in these records about the identity of the patients 
will leave the study center. The Sponsor  monitoring standards require full verification for 
the presence of the signed ICF, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria,

CRA will review source data compared with the eCRFs and will verify source data 
according to the study -specific monitoring plan. The design of the study, the frequency of 
patient visits, and the s ite enrollment rate will determine the frequency of monitoring 
visits. Upon study completion, the CRA will visit the site to conduct a study termination visit, which will include collection of any outstanding documentation.  
It is recommended that the Inves tigator /investigative staff log into the eCRF system every 
working day or at minimum twice weekly in order to provide a prompt response to queries. The Investigator /investigative staff should respond to queries and make any 
relevant changes to the study da ta within 3 working days.

Prior to the start of the study, the Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the protocol 
and consent form have been reviewed and approved by a relevant IRB. The IRB shall be 
appropriately c onstituted and perform its functions in accordance with FDA , ICH, GCP , 
and local requirements as applicable.  
The IRB shall approve all protocol amendments (except for logistical or administrative changes), written informed consent documents and document updates, patient recruitment procedures (e.g., advertisements), written information to be provided to the patie nts and 
caregivers, the Investigator’s Brochure, available safety information, information about 
payment and compensation available to patients, the Investigator’ s curriculum vitae 
and/or other evidence of qualifications and any other documents requested b y the IRB 
and regulatory authority (competent authority) as applicable.  
14.2 Written Informed Consents  
The Investigator (physician) or investigative staff, in accordance with local regulations, 
will explain to each patient  (or legally authorized representative)  the nature of the study, 
its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, alternative treatment, the potential risks and benefits involved, and any discomfort that may occur. Each patient will be informed that participation in the study is vol untary and that he/she may withdraw 
from the study at any time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the treating physician.  
If written consent is not possible, oral consent can be obtained  if witnessed and followed 
by a signed statement from one or more persons not involved in the study, indicating why the patient was unable to sign the form. No patient can enter the study before his/her informed consent has been obtained, as required by co untry regulations.  
The ICF is part of the protocol and must be submitted by the Investigator/investigative 
staff with the protocol for IRB approval. The Sponsor will supply an ICF which complies 
with regulatory requirements and country laws and is considered appropriate for the study. Any changes to the ICF suggested by the Investigator must be agreed to by the 
Sponsor  before submission to the IRB and a copy of the approved version must be 
provided to the clinical monitor after IRB approval.

Elobixibat in Adults with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) or Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis 
(NASH)  
Principal Investigator:   
Study Centers:  Up to 15 sites will be initiated for this study in the United States (US)  
Publication(s): Not applicable  
Planned Study Period: Q2 2019 to Q2 2020  Development Phase: Phase 2  
Objectives:  
Primary Objective  
The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of repeated once- daily doses of 5 mg elobixibat on serum 
levels of low -density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) in patients with NAFLD or NASH.  
Secondary Objectives  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of elobixibat in patients with N AFLD or NASH  
• To evaluate the effect of elobixibat on liver steatosis as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for (i) liver fat fraction (using proton density fat fraction [PDFF]) and (ii) total liver fat (using whole liver fat volume)  
• To evaluate the effect of elobixibat on liver function using alanine aminotransferase (ALT)  
• To evaluate the effect of elobixibat on lipids and serum bile acids (s -BA) in patients with NAFLD or 
NASH  
Methodology:  
This is a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, Phase 2 study to explore the efficacy and safety of 
elobixibat (oral dose of 5 mg) once daily for 16 weeks in patients with NAFLD or NASH. The study includes a 6 -week Screening period, followed by a 16- week Treatment period, and a Follo w-Up visit 
2 
weeks after the last dose of study drug. Continued collection of efficacy data for patients who discontinue 
treatment will be made for as long as possible  per the schedule of assessments .  
After completing the Screening period, eligible patien ts will be randomized on Day  1 (Visit  2) in a 1:1 
fashion to either 5  mg/day elobixibat or matching placebo. There will be a total of 7 scheduled visits during 
the study. Additional unscheduled visits may be required for patients who need direct site assis tance (e.g., 
due to adverse event [AE] monitoring, in order to fulfill screening requirements, and/or for safety maintenance).   
Number of Patients: Approximately 46 patients diagnosed with NAFLD/NASH and in accordance with 
the inclusion/exclusion criteri a will be randomized.   
Inclusion Criteria:  
Patients must meet all of the following criteria to be included in the study:  
1. Be willing to participate in the study and provide written informed consent  
2. Be a man or woman ≥18 years of age  
3. Have a current biopsy -confirmed NASH within 6 months of screening or a suspected diagnosis of 
NAFLD/NASH based on the criteria outlined below:

Statistical Methods  
Analysis Populations:  
• The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will include all patients who are randomized in the study and 
receive at least 1  dose of study drug. The ITT population will be used for all efficacy analyses 
based on the treatment randomized unless otherwise specified  
• The per protocol (PP) population will include all ITT patients who finish Visit 7/End of Treatment 
(EOT) with valid LDL -C measurements and do not have any major protocol deviations. 
Allocation of patients to the PP analysis set will be performed before unblinding of the study  
• The safety population will include all patients who are randomized and receive at least 1 dose of 
study drug and will be used for all safety analyses based on the treatment received  
• Summary statistics (number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum) at all visits and change or percent change from Baseline will be provided  for efficacy 
and safety continuous variables. Count and frequency will be used to tabulate categorical variables  
• Demographics, disposition, and study populations will be summarized descriptively  
 
Efficacy : 
• The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from Baseline in serum LDL -C at Week 16. Baseline 
is defined as the last non -missing LDL -C value prior to the first dose of study drug  
• To address the potential missing data from patients who are lost to follow -up after treatment 
discontinuation, multiple imputation method will be used. Data from patients who discontinue the 
study drug but stay in the study with scheduled assessments collected will be used to impute missing values for patients lost to follow -up. T his imputation will be done within each treatment 
group. Interim missing data will be handled as missing at random (predictable from observed data from subjects in the same treatment group)  
• After the imputation is performed, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to analyze the primary efficacy endpoint. The model will include treatment arm and Baseline LDL -C scores  
• Least square (LS) mean (SE), LS mean difference (SE), 95% confidence intervals, and P- values 
between elobixibat 5 mg and placebo will be provided. The model assumptions will be checked 
before the analysis. If there are concerns on model assumptions, i.e., normality and homogeneity 
of variances, a non -parametric ANCOVA based on the rank scores can be used as a sensitivity 
analysis  
• Explora tory comparisons between elobixibat 5 mg and placebo will be performed for the 
following secondary efficacy endpoints:  
o Absolute change from Baseline to Week 16 in liver fat fraction (%) as measured by MRI -PDFF  
o Absolute change from Baseline to Week 16 in total liver fat (mL) as measured by MRI  
• The analysis methods for the other secondary endpoints and exploratory endpoints will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan for the study.  
 
Safety : 
• The safety endpoints for this study include clinical laborator y assessments, vital signs, AEs, 
ECGs, physical examinations, and concomitant medications  
• AEs will be coded using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedRA). TEAEs will be defined as AEs that are new or worsening after t he first dose of study 
drug. A general summary of patients with TEAEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be

tabulated with numbers and percentages of patients and repeated for severity and relationship to 
study drug per treatment group. The number of A Es leading to withdrawal and SAEs leading to 
death will also be summarized. The incidence of TEAEs will be summarized by body system and 
treatment group  
• The safety laboratory data will be summarized by visit and by treatment group, along with changes from Baseline. Values outside of the reference range will be flagged and laboratory abnormalities 
of special interest will be summarized  
 
Sample Size Determination : 
Due to the exploratory nature of this study, no formal power calculations were used to determine the 
sample size. The number of subjects (46 patients in total, 23 patients per treatment group) was chosen 
based on clinical experience with other similar proof -of-concept studies.

5.1 Investigational Medicinal Product 
Elobixibat is a potent inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT ; also known as the 
apical sodium bile acid transporter [ ASBT ]). The IBAT, expressed mainly in the distal 
ileum, is a key element in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids because it facilitates 
the very efficient process of bile acid reabsorption. Elobixibat is orally administered and acts locally in the gut where it binds reversibly to the IBAT to decrease the reuptake of bile acids to the liver. Elobixibat has minimal systemic exposure at expected therapeutic dose ranges.  
5.2 Background 
5.2.1 Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Nonalcoholic 
Steatohepatitis (NASH)  
Recent data suggest that bile acids may play an important role in NASH pathogenesis 
(Ferslew 2015; Aranha 2008; Puri 2018). Bile acids are signaling molecules involved in 
lipid, glucose, and energy homeostasis, which are metabolic pathways linked to NAFLD/NASH and comorbidities such as metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes. 
Bile acids as well as free cholesterol, which is the precursor from which bile acids are synthesized, can act as lipotoxic agents that drive inflammation and fibrosis. Studies have shown that both serum and liver bile acids are increased in patients with NASH, and 
recent data have suggested that the presence and severity of NASH is associated with 
specific changes in circulating bile acids ( Puri 2018). Thus, targeting of bile acid 
pathways has therapeutic potential in patients with  NASH.  
The enterohepatic circulation of bile acids plays a crucial role in whole body sterol 
balance. Bile acids are secreted to the intestine via the bile duct and then reabsorbed, mainly by a specific bile acid transporter located in the ileum (IBAT or ASBT) and delivered back to the liver, completing the enterohepatic circulation ( Prawitt 2011).  
Bile acid reabsorption from the intestine is a very efficient process where 95% of the secreted bile acids are reabsorbed and IBAT appears to be the major regulator of the bile 
acid pool in animals and human s. IBAT inhibitors reduce the reabsorption of bile acids 
from the ileum and prevent their return to the liver. The liver compensates for the

enzyme for bile acid synthesis. This results in lower hepatic cholesterol levels and an 
increased number of low-density lipoprotein ( LDL) receptors in the liver leading to 
reduced plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL -C; [Bertolotti 2003; 
Naoumova 1999]) . Bile acids also positively regulate glucagon -like peptide -1 (GLP -1) 
levels via activation of TGR5 ( Prawitt 2011; Schaap  2014). GLP -1 is an insulinotropic 
hormone but has many other roles, e.g., slowing gastric emptying and increasing satiety signals leading to weight loss ( Andersen  2018).  
Inhibition of bil e acid absorption locally in the intestine has the potential to positively 
influence NASH, cardiovascular  disease,  and metabolic disease by targeting multiple 
mechanisms , as follows : lowering of LDL -C by increased bile acid synthesis ; improving 
metabolic s tatus and weight loss by increasing GLP- 1 levels ; and reducing hepatic cell 
damage by lowering toxic bile acid and free cholesterol in the liver.  
5.2.2 Summary of Nonclinical Studies in NASH  
One nonclinical study with elobixibat in a NASH model has been completed. The study evaluated the effects of elobixibat in leptin -deficient ob/ob mice treated with a diet high 
in trans fats, fructose , and cholesterol. Although elobixibat did not reduce liver NAFLD 
activity score or fibrosis stage, there were indicators of relevant effects, including reduction in liver alpha- smooth muscle actin  (α-SMA ), which is a marker of stellate cell 
activation and thereby an indirect marker for fibrosis formation. Administration of 10 and 30 mg/kg/day elobixibat decreased liver steatosis as quantified by lipid fractional area in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained liver sections in a dose-dependent fashion. This was further evident in animals treated with 30 mg/kg elobixibat that showed reduced liver triglycerides and liver total cholestero l as determined by biochemical analyses. Analysis 
of liver gene expression by next generation RNA sequencing revealed pronounced and dose- dependent effects of elobixibat. It affected the expression of genes in key pathways 
associated with NASH pathology. 
Additional nonclinical studies with elobixibat are summarized in the Investigator ’s 
Brochure  (M1.14.4.1 ).

Confidential  Version 1.0 (Original)/25 Feb 2019  Page 20 of 71 5.3 Rationale 
Bile acids act as signaling molecules in lipid, glucose , and energy homeostasis. Studies 
have shown that both serum and liver bile acids are increased in patients with NASH 
(Ferslew  2015), and recent data have suggested that the presence and severity of NASH 
is associated with specific changes in circulating bile acids ( Puri 2018; Sanyal  2018). 
Inhibition of bile acid absorption from the intestine has the potential to improve the 
pathophysiology in NASH, including the related cardiovascular and metabolic disease due to impingement on multiple key metabolic feedback mechanisms , as follows : 
lowering of LDL -C by increased bile acid synthesis, and improving insulin sensitivity by 
increasing GLP -1 levels. A reduction of cardiovascular risk is particularly desirable for 
any pharmacological NASH  treatment, because cardiovascular complications contribute 
to a significant amount of mortality in patients with NAFLD/NASH, with their annual 
risk being 2-fold increased ( Mahfood Haddad  2017; Younossi 2018). IBAT inhibition 
reduces the levels of bile acid that circulate to the liver, and triggers increased hepatic bile acid synthesis from cholesterol. Thus, besides having a positive impact on cardiovascular he alth, IBAT inhibition might also reduce hepatic cell damage by 
lowering free cholesterol and changing the composition of toxic bile acids in the liver. 
5.4 Risk/Benefit  
Elobixibat is orally administered and acts locally in the gut where it binds reversibly to 
the IBAT to decrease the reuptake of bile acids into the liver, thereby increasing the concentration of bile acids in the colon. Due to its mechanism of action, most adverse events  (AEs) are gastrointestinal ( GI) tract disorders, such as abdominal pain, di arrhea, 
abdominal distention, flatulence, and nausea; the incidence of these has increased with increasing dose levels. Diarrhea has been the most prominent dose- limiting side effect. 
No clinically significant findings in laboratory measures or electrocard iograms ( ECGs ) 
have been reported.  
There is no established benefit for subjects participating in this P hase 2 study. Based 
upon these data, the risk/benefit for subjects participating in this trial is acceptable.  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and with the International 
Council on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on GCP.

7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
7.1.1 Description  
This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, P hase 2 study to explore the 
efficacy and safety of elobixibat (oral dose of 5 mg) once daily for 16 weeks in patients 
with NAFLD or NASH. The study includes a 6 -week Screening Period, followed by a 
16-week Treatment Period, and a Follow-Up Visit 2 weeks after the last dose of study 
drug. Continued collection of efficacy data for patients who discontinue treatment will be made for as long as possible as per the schedule of assessments  (Table 1 ).  
After completing the Screening Period, eligible patients will be randomized on Day  1 
(Visit 2) in a 1:1 fashion to either 5 mg/day elobixibat or matching placebo. Visit windows applicable to each visit are presented in the schedule of assessments  (Table 1). 
There will be up to 7 clinic visits during the study , as follows: 
• Visit 1: Screening period (Week -6 through Day -1) 
• Visit 2: Day 1/Randomization visit 
• Visit 3: Week 4  
• Visit 4: Week 8  
• Visit 5: Week 12  
• Visit 6: Week 16/End of Treatment (EOT). Any patient that discontinues treatment prematurely should complete this visit at the time of discontinuation  
• Visit 7: Follow -Up period . The Follow-Up visit will occur 2 weeks after the last 
dose of study drug whether the patient completes the study or discontinues prematurely  
Additional unscheduled visits may be required for patients who need direct site assistance (due to AE monitoring, in order to fulfill screening requirements, and/or for safety 
maintenance).

Confidential  Version 1.0 (Original)/25 Feb 2019  Page 37 of 71 7.2.3 Withdrawal of Patients 
Patients will be informed that they have  the right to withdraw from the study at any time, 
without prejudice to their medical care, and that they are not obliged to state their 
reasons.  
Any withdrawal, and reasons for withdrawal, must be fully documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF)  and source documents and the patient followed by the 
investigator/investigative staff. Even after the study is completed at the Follow -Up visit, 
the investigator/investigative staff will, regardless of reason for withdrawal, record any patient data they r eceive concerning serious adverse events ( SAEs ), and all drug- related 
non-serious AEs, and report these in the eCRF. Withdrawn patients will not be replaced. 
Patients will be withdrawn in the following circumstances:  
• A patient’s desire for withdrawal for a ny reason  
• Lost to follow- up (every effort must be made to contact the patient; a certified 
letter must be sent)  
• An AE that, in the opinion of the Investigator , necessitates withdrawal  
• Death  
• A patient’s substantial noncompliance (study drug compliance) or protocol 
violation  
• An Investigator’s opinion that continuing the patient in the study is not 
appropriate. The Investigator may withdraw a patient at any time if it is considered to be in the patient’s best interest 
A patient who withdraws from treatment prematurely will have EOT (Visit 6) 
assessments at the time of withdrawal and a Follow- Up assessment (Visit  7) 
approximately 2 weeks following the last dose of study drug, and the patient will be recorded as withdrawn.  
7.2.4 Study Termination by Sponsor  
This study may be terminated at any time by the Sponsor if serious side effects should 
occur, if the Investigator does not adhere to the protocol, or if, in the Sponsor's judgment,

its designee will inform the study investigators, institutions, and all regulatory authorities.  
The Sponsor may temporarily or permanently discontinue the study at an investigative site at any time for safety, ethical, compliance, or other reasons. If this is necessary, the 
Sponsor will endeavor to provide advance notification to the site. If a site or the study is suspended or discontinued, the Investigator /investigative staff will be responsible for 
promptly informing the IRB. If required by local regulations, the Sponsor or its designee will be responsible for informing the IRB and the regulatory authority of study or site discontinuation. In such an event, all study data and unused study drug must be returned to the Sponsor or its designe e.

8.1 Identity of Study Drug  
Elobixibat and placebo will be supplied as tablets for oral administration during the 
Treatment phase of the study. White tablets containing elobixibat or placebo will be 
provided.   
The elobixibat and placebo tablets will be identical in appearance. Tablet filling weight 
will also be identical for elobixibat and placebo. Bottles containing 34 tablets will be given to the patient at each visit. Refer to the study reference  manual.  
8.2 Administration of Study Drug  
Patients will be dosed with elobixibat at a dose of 5  mg or placebo once daily for 
16 weeks. Study drug will be dispensed to the patient at Visits  2-5 together with 
instructions on how to store and take the drug. Study drug compliance will be evaluated at each study visit.   
Elobixibat should be taken in the morning, prior to the first meal. On clinic visit days when laboratory assessments are conducted, study drug should be taken after the visit and after laboratory samples are taken.   
8.3 Study Treatment Packaging and Labeling  
8.3.1 Packaging and Labeling 
The tablets will be packed in high -density polyethylene bottles, with child-proof 
polypropylene caps. Packaging and labeling will be prepared to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. 
8.3.2 Storage 
Treatment bottles containing elobixibat tablets should be stored and dispensed in 
accordance with regulations in their original containers. The storage facility at the investigative site should be locked and the storage temperature should be between 15°C and 25°C. 
Caregivers should be informed of appropriate storag e conditions (i.e., room temperature, 
between 15°C and 25°C).

Confidential  Version 1.0 (Original)/25 Feb 2019  Page 40 of 71 Any deviations from the recommended storage conditions should be immediately 
reported to the Sponsor and the study drug should not be used until authorization has been given by the Sponsor. 
8.3.3 Blinding and Randomization of Study Drug  
A double- blind design is employed so that both the investigators and the patients will be 
unaware of the treatment assignment during the study.  
After written  informed consent is obtained from an eligible patient, a 6-digit patient 
number will be assigned. The first 3  digits will be the site number followed by a 3 -digit 
patient seq uence number. This number will be created and allocated by the Interactive 
Web Response System (IWRS), when the patient first enters the system at Screening. The 
randomization codes will be computer- generated by a statistician independent from the 
project team. The randomization will be done in blocks to ensure approximate balance betw een dose schemes (1:1). Randomization codes will be assigned sequentially as 
patients become eligible for randomization. 
Patients who are eligible for randomization will be assigned a unique 4- digit 
randomization number by IWRS. This randomization number i dentifies which treatment 
will be allocated to the patient. Patients who withdraw from the study after randomization 
visit are not to be replaced and their randomization number will not be reused.   
To ensure blinding, the study drug and the matching place bo have the same shape and 
size. Labels on the treatment bottles will not identify the treatment to which a patient has 
been randomized. Traceability of the treatment is ensured by the bottle number. 
The 5 -digit bottle number will identify the study- drug b ottle and will be detailed on the 
study-drug label. Dispensing of the study drug will be coordinated by IWRS.  
The system will assign a study -drug number corresponding to the randomization arm. 
The randomization number will be used in the background only t o ensure that there is no  
unblinding and will not be displayed to end-users in the IWRS.  
8.4 Procedure for Breaking the Randomization Code 
Should a situation arise where unblinding is urgently required, i.e., only where 
knowledge of the study drug is required to adequately manage a life-threatening situation, 
Elobix AB  A3309 – 1 41078 
Module 5 : Clinical Study Reports  
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol  
 
Confidential  Version 1.0 (Original)/25 Feb 2019  Page 41 of 71 the Investigator at that study site may perform immediate unblinding through IWRS. T he 
responsibility to break the treatment code in emergency situations resides solely with the 
Investigator. The Investigator should make every effort to discuss the rationale (status 
and outcome) for emergency unblinding with the Sponsor ’s Medical Monitor as soon as 
possible to review the individual patient details.  
The study- site Investigator and appropriate project team members will be authorized to 
access the emergency unblinding functionality within the IWRS. Once the randomization code is broken for a patient, he/she must be withdrawn from the study and all assessments and procedures for Visit 6/EOT should be performed. Once a randomization code has been broken, the Investigator must inform the project team and Sponsor ’s Medical 
Monitor in writing within 24 hours. In case of technical issues accessing the system online, please see the IWRS site user manual for contact telephone numbers for the help desk 24/7 system support. 
8.5 Patient Compliance  
Patients will return all unused study drug at Visits  3 through 6. The study- site staff will 
count all returned drug, assess compliance, and record details in the eCRF. 
Any noncompliance will be documented and explained in the source documents. Treatment compliance = 100 × ([number of study drug dispensed—number of study drug 
returned ]/number of study drug that should be taken) 
Treatment compliance between 80% and 120% is  acceptable.  
8.6 Study Drug Accountability  
Records shall be maintained of the delivery of study treatment(s) to the study site(s), of 
the inventory at the study site(s), of each use of the study treatment(s) for each patient and the return or destruction of used and unused study treatment(s). Local destruction of used/unused study treatment(s) will follow institution standard operating procedures 
(SOPs) and will require Sponsor pre -approval. 
These records shall include dates, quantities, batch numbers, expiry dates, and the unique code numbers assigned to the study drug and to the study patients.

8.7 Concomitant Therapy and Prohibited Medications  
The Investigator will not e all ongoing medication and any medication recently stopped 
(within 3  months prior to Visit 2) in the eCRF. At Visits  2 through 6, all changes in 
medication (stopping or starting new medication or changes in dose) will be recorded in the eCRF.   
All medications taken by a patient within 3  months prior to the first intake of study drug 
are regarded as prior medication.  
All medications taken by a patient on or after the first intake of study drug, and which continue to be taken during the study, are regarded as concomitant medication.

The timing and frequency of safety assessments are described in Section  7.1.3 and in 
Table 1. 
The primary safety analysis will include the occurrence of treatment -emergent adverse 
events (TEAE) and TEAEs categorized by causality, severity, and seriousness 
assessments made by the Investigator by comparing study drug exposure to placebo. 
Trends in safety will also be ev aluated for the following assessments: 
• AEs, including discontinuations due to AEs 
• Physical examinations  
• Concomitant medications  
• Vital signs  
• 12-lead ECG  
• Laboratory test results (including clinical chemistry, hematology/coagulation, and 
urinalysis) 
10.1 Adverse Events  
10.1.1 Definitions and Investigator Assessments  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in an enrolled patient regardless of causal relationship with study drug. An AE can therefore be any clinically significant unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease that occurs once a patient is enrolled (ICF is signed) in the study until the patient is discharged from the study, whether or not related to the study drug. 
10.1.1.1 Clinical Significance  
Clinical significance is defined as any abnormal finding  that results in further clinical 
investigation(s), treatment(s), or the diagnosis of a new condition. Patient-reported events 
and protocol-mandated laboratory values, vital signs, and physical examination findings can be considered clinically significant (i.e., an AE) if there is a deterioration as compared to Baseline. Examples of clinically significant worsening from Baseline could 
Elobix AB  A3309 – 1 41078 
Module 5 : Clinical Study Reports  
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol  
 
Confidential  Version 1.0 (Original)/25 Feb 2019  Page 46 of 71 include, but is not limited to, events causing withdrawal from the study and events 
requiring medical intervention outside o f the study causing apparent clinical 
manifestations or judged to be relevant by the Investigator.   
10.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
Serious criteria are applied by the investigator to each AE as specifically defined below. These criteria are used to determine whet her an AE is serious or non-serious. The 
assessment is made independently of severity assessment (Section  10.1.1.3). For 
example, th e development of a severe rash that occurs after signing of the ICF  may not 
meet serious criteria as defined below and therefore would be considered a severe, non-serious AE. 
Any AE that meets any 1 of the following 6 criteria is considered to be an SAE:  
• The outcome of the AE is death  
• The AE is immediately life-threatening . Life -threatening means that the patient 
is, in the opinion of the Investigator , at immediate risk of death from the reaction 
as it occurred. This does not include an AE that, if more severe, might have 
caused death  
• The AE results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . Disability means 
a substantial disruption of a person’ s ability to conduct normal life functions  
• The AE requires or prolongs hospitalization   
• The AE results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• The AE is an important medical event . Important medical events may meet 
serious criteria should the Investigator assess that they may significantly jeopardize the patient, represent a significant hazard, or require medi cal/surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of potential SAEs based on these criteri a include, but are not limited to, allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions even if they do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency and drug abuse.

M5.3.5.1 – Protocol  
 
Confidential  Version 1.0 (Original)/25 Feb 2019  Page 47 of 71 10.1.1.3 Severity Assessment  
Severity assessments are based on the intensity of the event in relation to expectation. 
The Investigator will assess the intensity of AEs based on the following definitions:  
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
Severity is a measure of intensity where seriousness is defined by the criteria outlined in Section  10.1.1.2. An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. 
For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not meet serious criteria, and therefore would be assessed as a severe AE but not an SAE.  
10.1.1.4 Causality Assessment  
The Investigator determines the causality of all AEs to the study drug using medical 
judgment and considering all relevant factors such as (but not limited to) the underlying study indication, coexisting disease, concomitant medication, relevant history, pattern of the AE, temporal relationship to the study drug, and de- challenge or re- challenge. The 
causality assessment of the AE/SAE is to be made as follows : 
Related to Study Drug (Possibly, Probably, or Definitely Related ) 
Based on medical judgment, there is at least a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the event; one or more of the following criteria apply: 
• The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug 
• The event could not be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy 
administered to the patient 
• The event follows a known pattern of response to study drug 
• The event disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug. (It should be noted that in some situations an AE will not disappear or

Module 5 : Clinical Study Reports  
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol  
 
Confidential  Version 1.0 (Original)/25 Feb 2019  Page 48 of 71 decrease in intensity upon discontinuation of study drug despite other clear 
indications of relatedness)  
• The event reappears or worsens when the study drug is re- administered  
Unrelated to Study Drug (Unlikely or Unrelated ) 
Based on medical judgment there is no reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the event; one or more of the following criteria apply: 
• The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug 
• The event could be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient ’s clinical state, concurrent illness, environment or toxic factors, or other 
modes of therapy administered to the patient 
• The event does not follow a known pattern of response to study drug 
• The event does not disappear or decrease on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug, and it does not reappear or worsen when the study drug is re-administered  
10.1.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to assess whether each untoward event is a clinically 
significant worsening from Baseline, thereby considered an AE. For all AEs, the severity, 
seriousness, and causality to study drug for each AE as outlined in Section  10.1.1 will be 
assessed and recorded in the eCRF.  
All serious and non- serious AEs are collected once the caregiver/patient has signed the 
ICF and until the post- treatment follow -up (Visit 7) or 14 days after the last dose of study 
drug. 
Any AEs or SAEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last AE assessment are followed up 
by the Investigator until resolution or stabilization up to the database lock and recorded in 
the eCRF. The Sponsor retains the right to request additional information for any patient 
with ongoing AE(s) or SAE(s) at the end of the study.

Module 5 : Clinical Study Reports  
M5.3.5.1 – Protocol  
 
Confidential  Version 1.0 (Original)/25 Feb 2019  Page 49 of 71 TEAEs are defined as any AE that occurs after randomization (Day  1). All AEs that 
occur in the Screening period, i.e., after enrollment and prior to randomization, will be 
collected on the eCRF as non -TEAEs.  
If there is a clinically significant deterioration of a laboratory value/vital sign or other 
routine study assessment that is associated with a diagnosis, the clinical diagnosis will be reported as an AE and the associated signs and symptoms will be considered additional information unless the sign or symptom is more severe than expected given the diagnosis. For example, if an Investigator diagnoses a study patient with hepatitis during the study 
period, hepatitis would be considered the AE and the concomitant signs and symptoms of abdominal pain, vomiting, and elevated ALT and AST would not be reported separately unless, in the opinion of the Investigator, one of these signs or symptoms is more severe than expected and therefore a separate AE assessment is indicated.  
10.1.3 Recording and Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Every SAE (regardless of severity and causality) that occurs once the patient has signed the ICF and through 14 days after the final dose of study drug, should immediately and not later than within 24 hours of knowledge of the event, be reported by the Investigator or delegate in the SAE report form.  
Report of a SAE must include at least the following information: 
• Patient identification information (study number, site number, and date of birth 
[as per local country requirements for data protection]) 
• The last study drug administration date  
• The diagnosis of the event with the description (or a brief description of signs/symptoms/clinical course if the diagnosis is not available) and the date of onset 
• The action used to treat the event (i.e., trea tment medications, temporary 
discontinuation) 
• The reason(s) for considering the event serious 
• The relationship of the event to the study drug or to the study procedure (i.e., the Investigator’ s assessment of causality)

Follow-up reports including all new information obtained of the subsequent course of the 
SAE must be prepared and the information collected in the SAE report form submitted to the CRA,  
 by e-mail within 24  hours of knowledge of the event. 
The pharmacovigilance manager (PVM)  of the CRA may contact the Investigator to 
obtain further information on a reported SAE. The investigator/investigative staff must respond to any request for follow-up information or answers to questions regarding the SAE within the same timelines as for initial reports.  
The PVM reports the occurrence of the SAE and follow-up to the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor for medical assessment of the case.  
Should an outcome of death occur within the study period or within 14 days after the last administration of study drug, an SAE form should be completed including the main and contributory causes of death. 
All SAE reports must be e -mailed to the following e -mail address within 24 hou rs: 
 
If email is unavailable, SAEs may be transmitted via fax to the following number: 
 
10.1.4 Reporting of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) is an SAE that occurs in a 
patient, the nature or severity of which is not expected per the applicable product information (e.g., the Investigator’s Brochure for an unauthorized investigational product or summary of product characteristics for an authorized product).  
Reporting and tracking of SUSARs will be in accordance with all applicable competent

10.2.2.1 Liver Monitoring  
Strategies to monitor markers of liver disease throughout the study are outlined below 
where the ULN will be based on central laboratory reference values for age and gender. Patients will be monitored as described below for drug-induced liver injury from randomization to 2 weeks following the last administration of study drug. 
Elevated ALT  
• ALT >5 × ULN or >3 × Baseline (if ALT elevated at Baseline): repeat AST, 
ALT, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and INR within 72 hours and closely monitor the patient. If liver enzyme elevation is confirmed, interrupt the study drug. The study drug can be restarted only if a competing etiology is identified or liver tests return to Baseline. 
Elevated AST  
• AST >5 × ULN or 3 × baseline (if AST elevated at baseline): repeat AST, ALT, total bilirubin, ALP, and INR within 72 hours and closely monitor the patient. If liver enzyme elevation confirmed, interrupt the study drug. The study drug can be 
restarted only if a competing etiology is identified or liver tests return to Baseline . 
Elevated Total Bilirubin  
• Total bilirubin >2 × ULN or >1.5 × Baseline (if total bilirubin elevated at 
Baseline ), regardless of ALT or AST levels: repeat AST, ALT, total bilirubin, 
ALP, and INR within 72 hours and closely monitor the patient. If liver enzyme elevation confirmed, interrupt the study drug. The study drug can be restarted only if a competing etiology is identified or liver tests return to Baseline. 
Other Clinical Symptoms  
• Clinical signs of hepatitis or indicators of immunological reaction (e.g., nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, loss of appetite, dark urine, jaundice, rash, eosinophilia >5% or symptoms/signs of hepatic decompensation): discontinue the

and closely monitor. Other causes of hepatitis should be excluded.  
When close monitoring of a patient is not possible while the patient is on study drug, interrupt the study drug and closely monitor the patient. 
10.2.3 Demographics/Medical and Surgical History  
Demographic information per country regulations (age, full date of birth, gender, race, 
and ethnicity), along with medical and surgical history, will be obtained and recorded in the eCRF at Visit 1. 
Medical and surgical history will be entered in the eCRF at Visit 1. This includes date of 
diagnosis of NASH/NAFLD, ongoing medication, any surgery performed, and any other diagnoses.   
10.2.4 Physical Examination 
A physician or suitably trained qualified assistant will perform a complete physical 
examination at Screening , at Visit 2, and at Visit 6. Height ( Screening only), weight, 
waist circumference, and waist -to-hip ra tio will also be collected. BMI will be calculated 
based on height and weight.

11.2.2.1 General Principles  
Summary statistics (number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum) at all visits and change or percent change from Baseline will be provided for 
efficacy and safety continuous variables. Count and frequency will be used to tabulate categorical variables.  
11.2.2.1.1 Efficacy  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from Baseline in serum LDL- C at Week  16. 
Baseline is defined as the last non-missing LDL -C value prior to the first dose of study 
drug.  
Exploratory comparisons between elobixibat 5 mg and placebo will be performed for the 
following secondary efficacy endpoints:   
• Absolute change from Baseline to Week  16 in liver fat fraction ( %) as measured 
by MRI -PDFF  
• Absolute change from Baseline to Week  16 in total liver fat (mL) as measured by 
MRI  
The analysis methods for the other secondary and exploratory endpoints will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan  (SAP).  
11.2.2.1.2 Safety  
The safety  endpoints for this study include clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, 
AEs, ECGs, physical examination s, and concomitant medications. 
AEs will be coded using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities  (MedRA) . TEAEs wil l be defined as AEs that are new or worsening after the 
first dose of study drug. A general summary of patients with TEAEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be tabulated with numbers and percentages of patients and repeated for severity and relationship to study drug per treatment group. The number of AEs leading to withdrawal and SAEs leading to death will also be summarized. The incidence of TEAEs will be summarized by body system and treatment group.

with changes from Baseline. Values outside of the reference range will be flagged and laboratory abnormalities of special interest will be summarized.  
11.2.2.2 Missing Data 
Continued collection of efficacy data for patients who discontinue treatment will be made for as long  as possible as per the schedule of assessments  (Table 1). Missing data 
handling for the primary efficacy endpoint is specified under Section 11.2.2.6. Details on missing data handling for secondary and exploratory endpoints will be specified in the SAP.  
11.2.2.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive summaries of demographics and other baseline characteristics (including 
medical and surgical history) will be presented by treatment group and overall using the ITT population.  
Prior medication will be summarized by treatment group and overall using the ITT 
population. 
11.2.2.4 Subject Disposition

imputation will be done within each treatment group. Interim missing data will be 
handled as missing at random (predictable from observed data from subjects in the same treatment group).  
After the imputation is performed, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to analyze the primary efficacy endpoint. The model will include treatment arm and Baseline LDL- C scores.  
Least square (LS) mean (SE), LS mean difference (SE), 95% confidence intervals, and 
P-values between elobixibat 5  mg and placebo will be provided. The model assumptions 
will be checked before the analysis. If there are concerns on model assumptions, i.e., normality and homogeneity of variances, a non- parametric ANCOVA based on the rank 
scores can be used as a sensitivity analysis.  
Sensitivity analyses may be performed and will be detailed in the SAP.  
11.2.2.6 Evaluation of Secondary and Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for secondary a nd exploratory endpoints listed in 
Sections  9.1.2 and 9.1.3, respectively,  unless otherwise specified.

13.1 Conduct of the Study  
The study team shall implement and maintain quality control and quality assurance 
procedures with written SOPs to ensure that the study is conducted, and data are 
generated, documented, and reported in compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements.  
This study shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki (October 1996) and all revisions thereof, and in accordance with US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) regulations (Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 312.50 and 312.56) and with ICH GCP (CPMP 135/95). 
The Investigator may not deviate from the protocol without a formal protocol amendment 
having been established and approved by an appropriate competent authority and IRB, 
except  when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the patient or when the 
change(s) involve(s) only logistical or administrative aspects of the study. Any deviations may result in the patient having to be withdrawn from the study and render that patient non-evaluable.  
13.2 Study Monitoring  
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an Investigator’s meeting, a  Sponsor 
representative or designee will review the protocol and eCRF with the Investigators and 
the investigative staff. During the study, the clinical monitor ( the CRA) will visit the site 
regularly to check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy of entries on the eCRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to GCP, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study drug is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications.  
The investigator must ensure that eCRFs are completed within a timely period of patient visits, as per individual site agreements, and must allow the CRA and the Sponsor representative or designee periodic access to patient records and all study -related 
materials, including relevant hospital or clinical records, to confirm their consistency with the eCRF entries. No information in these records about the identity of the patients will leave the study center. The Sponsor monitoring standards require full verification for

documentation of SAEs, and recording of primary efficacy and safety variables. The CRA will review s ource data compared with the eCRFs and will verify source data 
according to the study-specific monitoring plan. The design of the study, the frequency of patient visits, and the site enrollment rate will determine the frequency of monitoring visits. Upon s tudy completion, the CRA will visit the site to conduct a study termination 
visit, which will include collection of any outstanding documentation. 
It is recommended that the Investigator /investigative staff log into the eCRF system every 
working day or at minimum twice weekly in order to provide a prompt response to 
queries. The Investigator/investigative staff should respond to queries and make any relevant changes to the study data within 3 working days.

Prior to the start of the study, the Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the protocol 
and consent form have been reviewed and approved by a relevant IRB. The IRB shall be appropriately constituted and perform its functions in accordance with FDA, ICH, GCP , 
and local requirements as applicable.  
The IRB shall approve all protocol amendments (except for logistical or administrative changes), written informed consent documents and document updates, patient recruitment procedures (e.g., advertisements), written information to be provided to the patients and caregivers, the Investigator’s Brochure, available safety information, information about 
payment and compensation available to patients, the Investigator’ s curriculum vitae 
and/or other evidence of qualifications and any other documents requested by the IRB and regulatory authority (competent authority) as applicable.  
14.2 Written Informed Consents  
The Investigator (physician) or investigative staff, in accordance with local regulations, 
will explain to ea ch patient  (or legally authorized representative) the nature of the study, 
its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, alternative treatment, the potential risks and benefits involved, and any discomfort that may occur. Each patient will b e informed that participation in the study is voluntary and that he/she may withdraw 
from the study at any time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the treating physician.  
If written consent is not possible, oral consent can be obtained if witnessed and followed by a signed statement from one or more persons not involved in the study, indicating why the patient was unable to sign the form. No patient can enter the study before his/her informed consent has been obtained, as required by country regulations. 
The ICF is part of the protocol and must be submitted by the Investigator /investigative 
staff with the protocol for IRB approval. The Sponsor will supply an ICF which complies with regulat ory requirements and country laws and is considered appropriate for the 
study. Any changes to the ICF suggested by the Investigator must be agreed to by the

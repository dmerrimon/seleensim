HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 5 of 184 1 Ethical considerations  
Multiple candidate HIV vaccines will need to be studied simultaneously in 
different populations around the world before a successful HIV preventive 
vaccine is found. It is critical that universally accepted ethical guidelines are 
followed at  all sites involved in the conduct of these clinical trials. The HIV 
Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) has addressed ethical concerns in the following 
ways:  
• HVTN trials are designed and conducted to enhance the knowledge base 
necessary to find a preventive vac cine, using methods that are scientifically 
rigorous and valid, and in accordance with International Council for 
Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human 
Use (ICH)  and/or Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.  
• HVTN scientists  and operational staff incorporate the philosophies underlying 
major codes [1-3], declarations, and other guidance documents relevant to 
human subjects rese arch into the design and conduct of HIV vaccine clinical 
trials.  
• HVTN scientists and operational staff are committed to substantive 
community input —into the planning, conduct, and follow -up of its research —
to help ensure that locally appropriate cultural a nd linguistic needs of study 
populations are met. Community Advisory Boards (CAB) are required by 
DAIDS and supported at all HVTN research sites to ensure community input, 
in accordance with Good Participatory Practices (GPP) and all local and 
national gui delines.  
• HVTN clinical trial staff counsel study participants routinely on how to 
reduce HIV risk. Participants who become HIV  infected during the trial are 
provided counseling on notifying their partners and about HIV infection 
according to local guidelines. Staff members will also counsel them about 
reducing their risk of transmitting HIV to others.  
• Participants who become HIV -infected during the trial are referred to medical 
practitioners to manage their HIV infection and to identify potential cl inical 
trials they may want to join.  If a program  for antiretroviral therapy  (ART) 
provision is not available at a site and ART is needed, a privately established 
fund will be used to pay for access to treatment to the fullest extent possible.  
• The HVTN pro vides training so that all participating sites similarly ensure fair 
participant selection, protect the privacy of research participants, and obtain 
meaningful informed consent. During the study, participants will have their 
wellbeing monitored, and to the  fullest extent possible, their privacy 
protected. Participants may withdraw from the study at any time.  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 6 of 184 • Prior to implementation, HVTN trials are rigorously reviewed by scientists 
who are not involved in the conduct of the trials under consideration.  
• HVTN  trials are reviewed by local and national regulatory bodies and are 
conducted in compliance with all applicable national and local regulations.  
• The HVTN designs its research to minimize risk and maximize benefit to both 
study participants and their local communities. For example, HVTN protocols 
provide enhancement of participants’ knowledge of HIV and HIV prevention, 
as well as counseling, guidance, and assistance with any social impacts that 
may result from research participation. HVTN protocols also incl ude careful 
medical review of each research participant’s health conditions and reactions 
to study products while in the study.  
• HVTN research aims to benefit local communities by directly addressing the 
health and HIV prevention needs of those communities  and by strengthening 
the capacity of the communities through training, support, shared knowledge, 
and equipment. Researchers involved in HVTN trials are able to conduct other 
critical research in their local research settings.  
• The HVTN recognizes the impo rtance of institutional review and values the 
role of in country Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) , Ethics Committees 
(ECs ), and other Regulatory Entities (REs)  as custodians responsible for 
ensuring the ethical conduct of research in each setting.  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 7 of 184 2 IRB/EC  review considerations  
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other US federal regulations 
require IRBs/ECs to ensure that certain requirements are satisfied on initial and 
continuing review of research (Title 45, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part  
46.111(a) 1 -7; 21 CFR 56.111(a) 1 -7). The following section highlights how this 
protocol addresses each of these research requirements. Each HVTN Investigator 
welcomes IRB/EC questions or concerns regarding these research requirements.  
This trial is also being conducted in Africa, with funding from the US NIH  among 
others . Due to this, the trial is subject to both US and local regulations and 
guidelines on the protection of human research subjects and ethical research 
conduct. These research regulations an d guidelines are based on ethical principles 
of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Where there is a conflict in 
regulations or guidelines, the regulation or guideline providing the maximum 
protection of human research subjects will be followed.  
In compliance with international and local (as appropriate) ICH and/or GCP  
guidelines, each research location  has a locally based Principal Investigator (PI) 
who is qualified to conduct (and supervise the conduct of) the research . The 
investigators take r esponsibility for the conduct of the study and the control of the 
study products, including obtaining all appropriate regulatory and ethical reviews 
of the research.  
2.1 Minimized risks to participants  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 1 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 1: Risks to sub jects are 
minimized.  
This protocol minimizes risks to participants by (a) correctly and promptly 
informing participants about risks so that they can join in partnership with the 
researcher in recognizing and reporting harms; (b) respecting local/national b lood 
draw limits; (c) performing direct observation of participants postvaccination and 
collecting information regarding side effects for several days postvaccination; (d) 
having staff properly trained in administering study procedures that may cause 
physi cal harm or psychological distress, such as blood draws, vaccinations, HIV 
testing and counseling and HIV risk reduction counseling; (e) providing HIV risk 
reduction counseling and checking on contraception use (for persons assigned 
female sex at birth ); and (f) providing safety monitoring.  
2.2 Reasonable risk/benefit balance  
45 CFR 46.111(a) 2 and 21 CFR 56 .111(a) 2: Risks to subjects are 
reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 8 of 184 the importance of the knowledge that may reasonabl y be expected to 
result.  
In all public health research, the risk -benefit ratio may be difficult to assess 
because the benefits to a healthy participant are not as apparent as they would be 
in treatment protocols, where a study participant may be ill and ma y have 
exhausted all conventional treatment options. However, this protocol is designed 
to minimize the risks to participants while maximizing the potential value of the 
knowledge it is designed to generate.  
2.3 Equitable participant  selection  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 3 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 3: Subject selection is 
equitable  
This protocol has specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for investigators to 
follow in admitting participants into the protocol. Participants are selected 
because of these criteria and not b ecause of positions of vulnerability or privilege. 
Investigators are required to maintain screening and enrollment logs to document 
volunteers who screened into and out of the protocol and for what reasons.  
2.4 Appropriate informed consent  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 4 & 5 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 4 & 5: Informed 
consent is sought from each prospective subject or the subject’s 
legally authorized representative as required by 45 CFR 46.116 and 
21 CFR Part 50; informed consent is appropriately documented as 
required by 45 CFR  46.117 and 21 CFR 50.27  
The protocol specifies that informed consent must be obtained before any study 
procedures are initiated and assessed throughout the trial ( Section  9.1). Each site 
is provided training in informed consent by the HVTN as part of its entering the 
HVTN. The HVTN requires a signed consent document for documentation, in 
addition to chart notes or a consent checklist.  
2.5 Adequate safet y monitoring  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 6 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 6: There is adequate 
provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of 
subjects.  
This protocol has extensive safety monitoring in place ( Section  11). Safety is 
monitored daily by HVTN Core and routinely by the HVTN 120  Protocol Safety 
Review Team (PSRT). In addition, the HVTN Safety Monitoring Board (SMB) 
periodically reviews study data.  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 9 of 184 2.6 Protect privacy/confidentiality  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 7 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 7: There are adequate 
provisions to protect the privacy of s ubjects and maintain the 
confidentiality of data.  
Privacy refers to an individual’s right to be free from unauthorized or 
unreasonable intrusion into his/her private life and the right to control access to 
individually identifiable information about him/he r. The term “privacy” concerns 
research participants or potential research participants as individuals whereas the 
term “confidentiality” is used to refer to the treatment of information about those 
individuals. This protocol respects the privacy of partic ipants by informing them 
about who will have access to their personal information and study data (see 
Appendix A ). The privacy of participants is pr otected by assigning unique 
identifiers in place of the participant’s name on study data and specimens. In the 
United States, research participants in HVTN protocols are protected by a 
Certificate of Confidentiality from the US NIH, which can prevent discl osure of 
study participation even when that information is requested by subpoena. 
Participants are told of the use and limits of the certificate in the study consent 
form. In addition, each staff member at each study site in this protocol signs a 
Confident iality Agreement on Confidentiality and Use of Data and Specimens 
with the HVTN. In some cases, a comparable confidentiality agreement process 
may be acceptable.  Each study site participating in the protocol is required to have 
a standard operating procedu re on how the staff members will protect the 
confidentiality of study participants.

4.1 Building on RV144  
Following the RV144 study in Thailand that demonstrated modest (31%) 
protective efficacy for an HIV vaccine regimen comprising ALVAC -HIV 
(vCP1521) and clade B/E gp120 Env protein (AIDSVAX® B/E)  formulated with 
Alum adjuvant  [4], a large number of consultations with independent groups of 
scientists collected through the NIH, MHRP, and the Global Vaccine Enterprise 
were  held providing input into the next steps for the field. Several consensus 
concepts emerged: (1) the need to evaluate the RV144 pox -protein prime -boost 
approach in a higher incidence population in a region of the world most affected 
by the HIV epidemic ( ie, Southern Africa); (2) the consequent need to 
manufacture vaccines that more closely match those clades/subtypes that circulate 
in the proposed trial population (clade C); (3) at least one of  the vaccine concepts 
to be tested should be analogous to the AL VAC/gp120 regimen used in RV144; 
and (4) the program to be developed should build upon the “correlates” analysis 
done after RV144 [5] to confirm the correlates identified in RV144 and to 
continue to define additional correlates of risk (CoR) for HIV vaccines. These 
recommendations led to the fo rmation of the Pox Protein Public Private 
Partnership (P5), a group of vaccine developers, funders, and implementers, 
which was created to build on the RV144 results with the goal of improving the 
pox-protein regimen and enhancing the level and/or duration  of protection seen in 
the RV144 study, with the hope of producing an effective prophylactic HIV 
vaccine with the potential to have a major public health impact.  
The P5 partnership is committed to evaluating multiple vaccine regimens  and will 
address this  goal by assessing  regimens containing combinations of next -
generation vaccine products as well as different adjuvant systems to identify those 
exhibiting potent yet diverse immunological profiles, thus providing the greatest 
potential to confirm previous and identify new CoR in an efficacy trial.  
4.1.1  The RV144 trial  
The RV144 trial was conducted by the US Military HIV Research Program and 
the Thailand Ministry of Health in a community -based s ample of more than 
16,000 HIV -1–uninfected participants in Thailand , and results were published in 
2009 [4]. This community -based study enrolled individuals aged 18 to 30 years 
with varying degrees of HIV risk. The clinical trial evaluated the heterologous 
prime -boost combination of canarypox prime ALVAC -HIV (vCP1521), 
expressing clade E Env and clade B Gag and parts of P ol, followed by the 
AIDSVAX clades B/E gp120 protein boost. These products were based on viruses 
commonly circulating in Thailand at the time. This vaccine regimen demonstrated 
31.2%  efficacy when compared with placebo ( number of infections n = 51 vs. n = 
74, respectively; p = 0.04) at 3.5 years [4]. Although evaluation of vaccine 
efficacy at 12 months post vaccination was not included in the pre -specified 
analy sis, substantially greater reduction in acquisition was observed 1 year post 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 15 of 184 vaccination (estimated 60.5%, 95% CI 22 -80) with the vaccine effect waning over 
time to cumulative 31% through 3.5 years [6]  
4.1.2  Correlates of risk (CoR) in RV144  
To better understand how the RV144 vaccine regimen reduced the risk of HIV 
infection, a large consortium of independen t laboratories worked together 
systematically to ensure maximal information could be derived from samples 
obtained from participants who were vaccinated and became infected compared 
with those vaccinated but uninfected at the end of the trial. A case contr ol study 
was performed on 41 infected vaccine recipients, 205 uninfected vaccine 
recipients (5:1) and 40 placebo recipients (20 infected and 20 uninfected) within 
the RV144 clinical trial to identify CoR [5]. Among the 6 primary immunological 
variables selected for the correlate s analysis (5 different antibody [Ab] responses 
and CD4+ T -cell cytokine production) that were measured at 2 weeks after the 
final vaccination visit ( ie, at or near peak immunogenicity), 2 immune CoR of 
HIV acquisition were identified among vaccine recipie nts in the RV144 case 
control study. The first was the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) Ab that 
bound to a scaffolded gp70 V1V2 recombinant protein; this variable correlated 
inversely with infection rate ( ie, higher V1V2 Ab→lower infection rate). The 
second was plasma Env -specific binding IgA, which correlated directly with 
infection rate ( ie, higher  immunoglobulin A [IgA] Ab to Env→ higher  infection 
rate). The other 4 primary variables correlated inversely with infection rate only 
when the level of IgA bi nding was low. Notably, neither low levels of V1V2 Ab 
nor high levels of Env -specific IgA were associated with higher rates of infection 
than those found in the placebo group [5]. 
Recently, several studies have further enhanced our understanding of the efficacy 
seen in RV144. Rol land and colleagues demonstrated a sieve effect in the vaccine 
recipients,  specifically that the vaccine induced better protection against viruses 
that matched the vaccine sequence at position 169 in the V2 loop of Env [7]. 
These data further substantiate the importance of antibodies directed against this 
region in protecting against infection [5]. Yates and colleagues noted that Env 
V1V2-specific IgG3 was the immunoglobulin subclass showing the strongest 
correlation with prevention of HIV acquisition in RV144 [8]. Chung and 
colleagues demonstrated that the Ig G3 subclass was much better at engaging Fc -
mediated effector responses when compared to the other subclasses, thereby 
providing a possible mechanism explaining the association of Env V1V2 IgG3 
with a lower rate of HIV acquisition [9]. In sum, these CoR studies point to the 
importance of Ab responses, directed against a specific region of Env, in 
mediating the differing rates of HIV acquisition observed in RV144. They lay the 
groundwork for directing immune analyses planned for future HIV vaccine 
clinical trials.  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 16 of 184 4.2 The Global Burden of HIV  
According to the UNAIDS 2016 Fact Sheet , there were a n estimated 36.7 million 
people living with HIV in 2015  globally. There were 2. 1 million new HIV 
infections globally and 1.1 million AIDS deaths in 2015 [10]. Therefore, despite 
the well -recognized benefits from scaling -up Antiretroviral Therapy ( ART ) and 
certain HIV prevention strategies, the global burden of HIV remains enormous.  
4.2.1  HIV in sub -Saharan Africa  
While universal access to AR T is a global ideal, in many regions of sub -Saharan 
Africa limited access undermines the prevention potential of widespread ART. 
Moreover, the costs and health care burden of delivering ever -increasing amounts 
of treatment in resource constrained settings pose significant challenges. In 
addition, while studies conducted over the past few years have confirmed the 
promise of antiretroviral chemoprophylaxis, it is well recognized that one way to 
eradicate a global viral epidemic is to design, mass produce, and  then 
systematically immunize the target population with an effective prophylactic 
vaccine. Although the results of the RV144 trial are modest, these provide the 
first indications that a prophylactic vaccine can reduce HIV acquisition risk.  
Eastern and So uthern Africa bears the preponderant burden of the HIV epidemic. 
With only 6.4% of the world’s population, this region harbors half of the world’s 
people living with HIV/AIDS and 46% of the world’s new infections occurred 
here in 2015. The vast majority of  newly acquired infections in this region occur 
during unprotected heterosexual intercourse and subsequent transmission to 
newborns and breastfed babies. Approximately 910,000 new HIV infections 
occurred in Eastern and Southern Africa in 2015  [10]. These statistics give strong 
support to recent statements from top scientists and opinion leaders who have 
voiced the persistent unmet need for a preventive HIV vaccine  [11]. 
4.2.2  HIV in the United States  
Approximately 1.1 million people are living with HIV in the United States. 
Access to potent and safe ART has transformed a life -threatening disease into a 
manageable chronic condition for many of these individuals. Life expectancy has 
risen steadily, to th e point where individuals, diagnosed early in infection and at a 
high CD4 count, may have a similar life -expectancy to the general population. 
Better tolerated treatment is now often provided as early as possible to reduce the 
contribution of HIV on non -AIDS related morbidity, and to prevent onward 
transmission.  
However, despite these advances in HIV care, HIV morbidity remains high and 
prevention efforts for the highest risk groups have had only partial success. There 
were an estimated 37,600 new infectio ns in 2014, 45% of these in African 
Americans, and 24% in Hispanics/Latinos. 70% of new infections were estimated 
to be among men who have sex with men. It is unlikely that early treatment 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 17 of 184 strategies and the availability of pre -exposure prophylaxis alone w ill be able to 
stop this epidemic, and that therefore an effective vaccine will be essential.  
4.3 Rationale for HVTN 120  
The P5 partnership is investigating  new vaccine products and vaccination 
strategies in populations from th e US and Sub -Saharan Africa. This will ensure 
the study of correlates of risk and protection is representative of the global HIV 
epidemic, resulting in the greatest impact on populations at risk in the US and 
globally.  
Based in large part on the success se en in the RV144 trial, the HVTN is 
conducting HIV vaccine studies in South Africa using a vaccine regimen that is 
similar to that tested in RV144. Two trials, designated HVTN 100 and HVTN 
702, are evaluating ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438) prime at months 0 and 1 foll owed 
with three boosts of ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438) + Bivalent Subtype C gp120/ MF59  
at months 3, 6, and 12 . Based on HVTN 100 interim safety and immunogenicity 
from two weeks after the second boost a decision has been made to advance the 
same vaccine regimen int o a pivotal efficacy trial. This pivotal trial, HVTN 702, 
open ed to enrollment on 21 -October -2016  in the Republic of South Africa.  
The ALVAC -HIV vector backbone in these  trials is the same as  was tested in 
RV144 but encode s a subtype C envelope , in lieu of  the subtype E envelope,  to 
better match the HIV subtype most prevalent in Southern Africa.  
HVTN 120  will compare the HVTN100/HVTN702  regimen (without a boost at 
Month 12) with two corresponding regimens containing the AS0 1B adjuvant, one 
at the same protein dose (100 m cg), and the other at a lower protein dose (20 
mcg). As such, HVTN 120  will generate supporting safety and immunological 
data regarding protein dose and adjuvant type in conte xt of the HVTN 702  
regimen . Systematic evaluations of well -characterized adjuvant/immunogen 
formulations, such as proposed in HVTN 120 , will aid in developing an HIV 
vaccine that can elicit and drive effective and durable f unctional immune 
responses against HIV.  With that, results can help guide the way forward in the 
development of an efficacious preventative HIV vaccine regimen. Once the 
optimal dose and adjuvant have been determined, further trials, in a sequential 
manner , can be used to improve upon the current regimen.  
4.3.1  Rationale for MF59 and AS01 B adjuvantation   
A unique and scientifically compelling aspect of this trial design is the use of 
different adjuvants with the HIV envelope (Env) glycoproteins in the boosts. 
Adjuvants are known to enhance the potency, quality, and longevity of antigen -
specific immune responses [13], and the availability of novel commercial 
adjuvants that are potent and safe has been heralded as an important contribution 
that may advance HIV vaccines [14,15] .  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 18 of 184 The MF59 adjuvant,  an oil -in-water emulsion,  is licensed for several flu vaccines 
in multiple countries, and in pre -clinical models [16] has demonstrated 
recruitment of antigen presenting ce lls and up -regulation of cytokines, 
chemokines, and receptors. The adjuvant has improved antibody affinity 
maturation [17], improving both epitope breadth and binding affinity, and elicits a 
balanced Th1 and Th2 response. It also increases T -cell proliferation by enhanced 
surface expression of MHC class II and co -stimulatory  molecules [18]. 
Remarkably durable memory responses (T -cell and binding and neutralizing Ab 
responses) were induced by a DNA -prime/gp120 and MF59 boost regimen in 
HVTN 049 and HVTN 088.  
The Adjuvant System AS01 is a liposome -based class of adjuvant s which 
contains 2 immu nostimulants, 3 -O-desacyl -4’-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) 
and QS -21 [19]. MPL is a non -toxic derivative of the lipopolysaccharide from 
Salmonella minnesota  and is a TLR4 agonist  [20]. It can stimulate NF -ĸB 
transcriptional activity and subsequent cytokine production [20]. MPL directly 
activates APCs such as dendritic cells (DCs) to produce cytokines and elevated 
levels of costimulatory molecules  [21-23]. QS-21 is a natural saponin molecule 
extracted from the bark of the South American tree Quillaja saponaria Molina  
[24] (reviewed in  [19,25] ). The early evaluations of QS -21 as an adjuvant 
demonstrated that it could promote high Ag -specific Ab responses and CD8 + T-
cell responses in mice [26,27]  and high Ag -specific Ab responses in humans  [28]. 
However, specific receptors and signaling pathways induced by saponin -based 
adjuvants have yet to be clearly defined, most likely through the activation of the 
inflammasome as observed with QuilA  [29]. AS01 has been selected in a number 
of human vaccine candidates because of its association with enhanced and durable 
immune responses, both humoral and cellular [19,30 -38] and recently with 
protection  against malaria in African children [30,31] . The ability of AS01 to 
improve adaptive immune responses was shown in mice to be linked to a transient 
stimulation of the innate immune system characterized by the induction of a 
specific pattern of cytokines and  innate i mmune cell recruitment that occurred 
rapidly and transiently at the muscle injection site and draining lymph node 
postinjection, consistent with the rapid drainage of the vaccine components to the 
draining lymph node, and also linked to the generation of a  high number and 
heterogeneous dendritic cell  population in the draining lymph node that was 
efficient at priming T cells  [39]. 
GSK PRO HIV -002 evaluated the gp120 W6.1D 20 mcg / NefTat 20 mcg 
candidate HIV vaccine (clade B) formulated with 1 of 3 different Adjuvant 
Systems (AS02 A, AS02 V and AS01 B) each in 60 healthy HIV -seronegative adults. 
The vaccine candidates were adminis tered at month  0, month  1, month  3 and 
month  6. All vaccine formulations induced strong HIV -specific CD4+ T -cell 
responses characterized by high lymphoproliferative capacity and IL -2 production 
that were still detectable 18 months after the last immunizati on, with significantly 
stronger responses seen in the AS01 B group (Figure 4-1 A and B). Broad coverage 
of CD4+ T -cell responses was demonstrated against gp120, and to a lesser extent 
Nef, derived from the most common circulating clades (B, C and circulating 
recombinant form [CRF] -01) ( Figure 4-1 C showing AS01 B responses).

Figure 4-1 CD4+ T cell responses  following vaccination with the gp120/NefTat vaccine  
candidate  formulated with 1 of 3 differ ent Adjuvant Systems (AS02 A, AS02 V and AS01 B) in 
study PRO HIV -002 
Strong antibody responses against gp120, Nef and Tat were observed in all 3 
groups. Responses were detected already after the second vaccine dose and 
peaked 2 weeks after the third  or fourt h vaccine dose .  
The demonstration of superior CD4+ T -cell induction by AS01 B has guided 
selection of this Adjuvant System for further HIV vaccine evaluation  [38]. CD4+ 
T-cell response rate and magnitude are widely applied, validated measures of HIV 
vaccine induced immunoge nicity. CD4+ T -cell magnitude is also frequently 
correlated with the polyfunctionality score proposed by Lin et al, which has been 
identified as a correlate of risk in RV144  [40]. 
Retrospective testing of stored specimens from the GSK PRO HIV -002 clinical 
study that evaluat ed gp120W6.1D/NefTa t in different Adjuvant Systems was 
performed in Dr. Georgia Tomaras ’ lab, which had contributed to  the correlate 
analysis of the RV144 trial.  Samples collected at various timepoint s from 30 
subjects vaccinated with gp120W6.1D  (20 mcg)  /NefTat/ AS01 B were tested.  The 
analysis of the isotype -specific responses showed, after  the vaccination all 
subjects had detectable IgG1 responses, and had detectabl e IgA against gp120 
vaccine protein  [41].  
In all cases, IgG1 was found to have the highest serum concentration among the 
IgG subclasses (mean concentration of serum a ntibody to gp120 was 5 µ g/ml). 
IgG2 vaccine -induced antibodies were detected in a minority (8/30, 27%) of 

HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / Septembe r 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 20 of 184 participants . When IgG3 and IgG4 vaccine -induced antibodies were detected, 
they were found in concentrations less than IgG2 vaccine -induced antibodies .  
The V1V2 specificity was also assessed and t he results showed that after vaccine 
dose 3, 100% of the subjects had total anti-V1V2 concentrations comparable to 
the high levels seen in RV144 and that this response was persistent, with  total IgG  
anti-V1V2 detected  in 87% of the subjects 18 months after the administration of 
the last vaccine dose (4 -dose schedule) (see Figure 4-2) [42].

the administration of the  booster dose , all participants were still seropositive for 
anti-F4 antib odies  and high levels of CD4+ T -cell responses were still detected. 
The F4/  AS01 B booster induced strong F4 -specific CD4 + T-cell responses, with 
similar frequencies and polyfunctional phenotypes as following primary 
vaccination, and high anti -F4 antibody c oncentrations, reaching higher levels than 
those following  primary vaccination (see Figure 4-4) [33]. 
 
Figure 4-4 CD4+ T cell and antibody responses following primary and booster doses of the 
F4 / AS01 B vaccine candidate in studies PRO HIV -005 and ECR -004. 
4.3.2  Rationale for 2 protein doses with AS01 B (20 mcg vs. 100 mcg)  
There are only limited data available evaluating differences in immune responses 
with varying doses of Env proteins in the context of a common adjuvant and co -
administration with a common ALVAC -HIV. Study RV135 evaluated the 
immune responses to a regimen identical to the one used in RV144 but utilizing 
two different doses of Env proteins (either 200 m cg or 600 m cg total [100 or 300 
each of MN and A244 proteins]), both adjuvanted with Alum and given in 
combination with ALVAC -HIV (vCP1521)  as a boost . 
In RV135 , humoral immune response assessments included E nv binding and 
neutralizing antibody titers. Study participants receiving 200 m cg of AIDSVAX 
B/E had lower  anti-MN and anti -A244 antibody response  rates  (95% and 86%, 
respectively) at peak immunogenicity (2 weeks after the fourth  immunization) 
compared to participants receiving 600 m cg of AIDSVAX B/E (100% and 96%, 
respectively). Geometric mean titers (GMT) of antibodies to MN and A244 were 
also lower overall for participants in the lower dose group (3744 and 596, 
respectively) compared to the higher dose g roup (7730 and 1691, respectively). 
Similarly, neutralization titers indicated a dose -dependent humoral response to 
AIDSVAX B/E, with 47% of lower dose recipients and 71% of higher dose 
recipients showing neutralizing antibodies to either of two CRF01_AE t argets 
(NP03/H9 or CM244/A3R5).   

HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 22 of 184 There are no studies evaluating differences in immune responses with varying 
doses of Env proteins in the context of ALVAC prime -boost and protein 
adjuvantation with MF59, AS01 or AS02  (oil-in-water emulsion of a combinatio n 
of MPL and QS -21). However, there are trials evaluating different doses of AS01 
adjuvanted protein s without viral vectors.  
Clinical trials assessing gp120 with a GSK Adjuvant System provide evidence 
that an Env protein with AS01 B can elicit strong humora l and cellular responses. 
Currently, it is unclear whether too high a protein d ose in the presence of the 
AS01 B adjuvant leads to suboptimal vaccine responses . 
HVTN 041 evaluated a combination vaccine (NefTat and gp120 W6.1D) 
formulated with AS02 A administe red at 0, 1 and 3 months with varying doses (5, 
20 and 100 mcg in 20 subjects each) of the gp120 vaccine component (the NefTat 
antigen dose was constant at 20mcg). The vaccine was safe and well tolerated at 
all dose amounts and Nef -, Tat-, and gp120 -specif ic binding antibodies were 
induced in all individuals that received the respective antigen, lasting up to 9 
months after the final immunization ( Figure 4-5).  
 
Figure 4-5 Kinetic of binding IgG antibodies induced by the NefTat/gp120/AS02 A vaccine 
candidate in study HVTN 041  
Antibodies able to neutralize the T -cell laboratory -adapted strain of HIV -
1gp120 W6.1D were de tected in the majority of vaccinees, but did not neutralize 
primary isolates. Envelope specific ADCC was detected in most of the individuals 
receiving gp120. Robust and persistent HIV -specific lymphoproliferative 
responses were detected against all subunit s proteins in the majority of 
immunized participants. Most immune responses were similar across all doses, 
except for a significant dampening effect on the CD4+ T -cell responses occurring 
at the highest gp120 dose (100 mcg) measured by lymphoproliferative and ICS 
assays [36] (see Figure 4-6).

Figure 4-6 gp120 -specifi c CD4+ T cell responses (IFN - and/or IL -2) induced by the

GSK PRO HIV -005 evaluated an HIV vaccine candidate consisting of a 
recombinant fusion protein (F4) containing 4 HIV -1 clade B antigens (Gag p24, 
Pol-RT, Nef, and Gag p17) adjuvanted with AS01 B in 3 different doses: 10, 30, 
and 90 mcg. Each dose of the AS01 B-adjuvanted vaccine candidate was 
administered twice in a group of 50 subjects, following a month  0 and month  1 
schedule. Three control gro ups of 10 subjects received a dose of 10, 30 or 90 mcg 
without AS01 B. The 10 mcg AS01 B-dose elicited a statistically significantly 
higher CD4+ T -cell response  as compared to the other doses (p < 0.0001 at 2 
weeks post second vaccination), while anti -F4 IgG  responses were elicited in 
100% of vaccinees with no significant difference in GMC titers amongst the 
groups [43].  
Combined together, data from HVTN 041 and GSK PRO HIV -005 have been 
used to generate the  hypothesis that a higher dose of gp120 may dampen resulting 
CD4+ T -cell responses. However, as stated above, there are no data evaluating 
differences in immune responses with varying doses of Env proteins in the 
context of ALVAC prime and a boost of ALVAC  co-administered with protein 
adjuvanted with MF59 or AS01. HVTN 120 will provide the direct comparison of 
different doses of gp120 adjuvanted with AS01B in the context of ALVAC prime -
boost and another study (HVTN 108) will provide this direct comparison i n the 
context of DNA prime -boost, DNA co -administration, and gp120 alone.  
4.4 Study product descriptions  
4.4.1  ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438)  
ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438) is a preparation of live, attenuated recombinant 
canarypox -derived virus expressing products from the HIV -1 env gp120 (clade 

HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018

sequences and cultured in primary chicken embryo fibroblasts ( CEFs ). 
4.4.1.1  Constructs  
The original strain of canarypox virus (Rentschler strain) was attenuated by serial 
passages on CEFs. The attenuated virus was plaque isolated and designated as 
ALVAC. Details of the manufacturing process are provided in the ALVAC -HIV 
(vCP2438) Investigator’s Brochure ( IB). 
The inserted HIV -1 gene sequences are:  
The region of the env gene encodin g the extracellular Env gp120 moiety of the 
96ZM651 strain of HIV -1 linked to the sequence encoding the HIV -1 TM anchor 
sequence of gp41  (28 amino acids) from HIV -1 strain LAI. The env gene 
sequence is under the control of the vaccinia virus H6 promoter.  
The gag gene encoding the entire Gag protein and a portion of the pol sequences 
of the LAI strain of HIV -1 sufficient to encode the protease function. The 
gag/protease gene sequences are under the control of the same vaccinia virus I3L 
promoter.

4.4.1.3  Manufacturing  
ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438) Bulk Drug Substance  is manufactured by IDT 
Biologika GmbH, Am Pharmapark, Dessau -Rosslau, Germany, under contract to 
Sanofi Pasteur. ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438) Drug  Product is manufactured at the 
Sanofi Pasteur SA, facility located in Marcy l’Etoile, France. The diluent used for 
reconstitution is manufactured at the Sanofi Pasteur Inc. facility located in 
Swiftwater, Pennsylvania (USA).  
ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438) is produce d by inoculating the virus seed  into cultured 
primary CEFs derived from eggs produced by specific pathogen free (SPF) flocks . 
The manufacturing process for ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438) is similar to the 
manufacturing process for ALVAC -HIV (vCP1521) used in RV144.  
4.4.2  Bivalent Subtype C gp120  
4.4.2.1  Constructs  
Bivalent Subtype C gp120 , manufactured by GSK  Vaccines at Rentschler 
Biotechnologie (Laupheim, Germany), consists of 2 separate subtype C 
recombinant monomeric proteins, TV1.C gp120 and 1086.C gp120. These 
recombinant gp1 20s represent the HIV Env surface glycoprotein containing the 
receptor -binding  domain. Each gp120 is modified from its wild type full -length 
form (gp160) by replacement of the native signal sequence and deletion of the 
entire gp41 C -terminal portion of the  glycoprotein containing the TM and 
cytoplasmic domains.

HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 26 of 184 4.4.2.2  Manufacturing and formulation  
Each protein is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells under conditions 
favorable for secretion of monomeric protein. Following fermentation, each 
protein is ex tensively purified as described in the following paragraph.  
Following clone selection, a fed batch cell culture at 500  L or 1000  L scale is 
employed for cell propagation. Once the cells reach optimum cell density, the 
culture is harvested and purified usin g standard methods. Harvest clarification 
was performed using a series of depth filters followed by bioburden reduction 
using a sterilizing -grade filter . The harvest was collected in single use disposable 
bags and purified including further enrichment for monomer. Additional 
process ing utilizes multiple filtration  steps and a series of chromatography steps  
that remove process related impurities.  
Both TV1.C and 1086.C bulk drug substances are stored frozen at -61°C or 
colder . The formulations are similar for both drug substances, containing Env 
antigen, sodium citrate, and sodium chloride, pH 6.5-7.0. Each of the HIV gp120  
proteins as final products are tested for pH, appearance, identity, strength 
(concentration), purity, po tency, as well as safety and content uniformity 
following US Pharmacopoeia  methods where applicable . 
The qualitative composition per dose of each subtype C gp120 vaccine protein is 
provided in Table 4-3.

4.5 Trial design rationale  
HVTN 120  has 3 active groups and 1 placebo group . The study  will compare 
ALVAC priming at month s 0 and 1 followed by ALVAC  + Protein boosting at 
month s 3 and 6. Group 1 will evaluate a protein dose of 100 mcg, adjuvanted with 
MF59, which represents the regimen applied in HVTN 100 and HVTN 702. 
Group 2 will evaluate the same protein dose, with the AS01 B adjuvant.  Group 3 
will evaluate the proteins at a lower dose of 20 mcg, adjuvanted with AS01 B. This 
approach can help to determine the protein dose and the adjuvant  that can elicit 
the most promising immune responses in the context of the ALVAC + protein  
regimen, and as such can pave the way to potentially improve u pon this already 
promising vaccine regimen.  The placebo group is primarily included to provide 
controls for immunological endpoints.  
4.5.1  Dose rationale  
4.5.1.1  ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438) dose  
ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438):  Viral titer ≥ 1 × 106 CCID 50 and <  1 × 108 CCID 50 
(nominal dos e of 107 CCID 50) lyophilized vaccine to be reconstituted  for IM 
injection.  
This study will utilize the same ALVAC -HIV dose that was used for the RV144 
study. The ALVAC -HIV (vCP1521) dose targeted for study RV144 was > 106 
CCID 50. The actual ALVAC -HIV titers from the 12 vaccine lots used in the 
RV144 study ranged from 107.06 CCID 50 to 107.41 CCID 50. 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 29 of 184 Titers of the ALVAC -HIV (vCP205) construct used in studies ranged from 105.6 
CCID 50 to 106.85 CCID 50. A dose response analysis was conducted with samples 
collected on days 98 and 182 in the AIDS Vaccine Evaluation Group ( AVEG ) 
022, 022A, 027, 032, 033, 034 and 034A studies. In summary, these data indicate 
that while there is not a positive dose -response relationship between ALVAC -
HIV and cytotoxic T lymphocyt e (CTL ) responses, use of the lower titer is not 
optimal for induction of nAb responses. Therefore, many clinical studies in 
humans have targeted an ALVAC dose >  106 CCID 50. 
HVTN 039 is the only study that has compared the safety and immunogenicity of 
ALVA C-HIV (vCP1452) given at the standard dose (107.25 CCID 50) to a dose 5.6 
times higher (108 CCID 50), and placebo  [44]. The high -dose ALVAC -HIV 
(vCP14 52) resulted in unacceptable levels of reactogenicity, without evidence of  
improved  immunogenicity. Although extrapolation of these findings to other 
ALVAC -HIV vaccines requires caution, the study suggested that an ALVAC -HIV 
dose < 108 CCID 50 is desirable.   
4.5.1.2  Bivalent Subtype C gp120/ MF59 dose  
For the Bivalent Subtype C gp120/ MF59  vaccine component,  100 mcg each of 
the 2 gp120 subtype C proteins (TV1 gp120 and 1086 gp120) will be mixed with 
the oil -in-water emulsion MF59  (9.75 mg squalene ) by the Pharmacist a t each 
CRS prior to  IM administration.  
The 200 mcg total dose was selected based on previous clinical experience with 
similar proteins. Limited dose range studies performed with Novartis (formerly 
Chiron) subtype B SF2 gp120 and subtype E gp120 protein can didates indicated 
that 50 mcg and 100 mcg, totaling 150 mcg, doses with MF59  adjuvant were 
immunogenic and well tolerated [45]. Bivalent Sub type C gp120/ MF59  vaccine 
has been administered to humans  in HVTN 100 and interim data are summarized 
in 4.7.2 . For a detailed overview on previous human experience  with MF59 and 
similar protein vaccines, see Section  4.7.6 . 
4.5.1.3  Bivalent Subtype C gp120/ AS01 B dose  
For the Bivalent Subtype C gp120/ AS01 B vaccine component,  100 mcg or 20 mcg 
each of the 2 gp120 subtype C proteins (TV1 gp120 and 1086 gp120) will be 
mixed with the adjuvant  by the Pharmacist at each CRS prior to  IM 
administration.  This dose comparison is supported by previous data obtained by 
GSK showing that protein doses that are too high may lead to suboptimal vaccine 
responses. This specific combination of Bivalent Subtype C gp120/AS01 B at both 
doses will also be evaluated in combination with an HIV clade C DNA vaccine in 
another trial, HVTN 108 . As of 09 December 2017, HVTN 108 has enrolled 246 
participants. The study is still blinded, but approximately 78% of participants will 
receive Bivalent Subtype C gp120/AS01 B. So far, th ere have been no related 
serious adverse events. 13 adverse events have been deemed related to study 
product, 11 mild and 2 moderate. There have been 2 cases of grade 3 fever, and 3 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 30 of 184 cases of grade 4 fever, and 12 cases of other grade 3 systemic reactions, all self -
limiting, as well as 5 cases of grade 3 erythema/induration, all self -limiting.  
4.5.2  Schedule  
The vaccination schedule of the regimens in this study is based upon the 
schedule s used in RV144, HVTN 100, and HVTN 702 .  
4.5.3  Rationale for the adaptive and mucosal sampling timepoints  
Examining the effects that the two adjuvants have on a variety of immune 
responses relative to each other is an important goal of this study. Adjuvants may 
influence antigen delivery, presentation, and immune responses and the 
constitution of the microbiome may influence immune responses in the context of 
either adjuvant.  
Systemic adaptive immune responses will be measured in samples collected at 
day 0 prior to vaccination, month 3.5 (2 weeks following the third vaccination), 
month 6.25 (1 week following the fourth vaccination), and month 6.5 (2 weeks 
following the fourth vaccination). These samples will provide both baseline and 
postvaccine information.  
Mucosal samples collected at day 0 provide the baseline values prior to 
vaccination while those collected at month  6.5 (2 weeks following the final 
vaccination), provide data on peak vaccine -induced systemic and mucosal 
adaptive immune responses.  
Finally, collection at month  12 will provide the opportunity to assess the 
durabilit y of systemic and mucosal immune responses 6 months after the last 
vaccination.  
4.5.4  Choice of placebo  
Sodium Chloride for Injection, 0.9%  will be administered as a placebo for 
ALVAC -HIV.  
Sodium Chloride for Injection, 0.9% will also serve  as a placebo for the  Bivalent 
Subtype C gp120/ MF59  and Bivalent Subtype C gp120/ AS01 B vaccine s. These 
placebos are  necessary  to maintain blinding  as Protein/AS01 B and Protein/MF59 
consist of different injection volumes . 
4.6 Summary of preclinical safety studies  
4.6.1  ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438)  
The toxicity studies described in Sections 4.6.1.1  and 4.6.1.2  were originally 
designed to match a different clinical trial protocol that included additional 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 31 of 184 vaccine regimens with the DNA -HIV-PT123 study product. However, the vaccine 
regimens relevant to HVTN 120 were also evaluated, therefore, the resulting data 
summaries from these studies have been included.  
4.6.1.1  Intramuscular local tolerability and systemic toxicity study in New Zealand 
White R abbit s (Study AB20670)  
The objective of the study was to determine the local tolerability and systemic 
toxicity of  ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438)/ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438) with gp120+MF59 
vaccines and DNA -HIV-PT123 with gp120+MF59 vaccines administered by the 
intramuscular route to New Zealand White Rabbits 7 or six times, respectively, at 
two-week intervals, followed by a two -week recovery peri od.  
There were no deaths during the study. No treatment -related clinical signs were 
reported during the study and treatment was locally well tolerated. Body 
temperature was slightly increased mostly after the first injection but returned to 
normal with 48  hours. There were no effects of treatment on body weight or food 
consumption. No treatment -related ophthalmological findings were observed at 
the end of the treatment period.  
When compared to the control group, a transient increase in C -reactive protein,  
globulin, fibrinogen or neutrophil count was observed after one or more of the 
immunizations. These effects correlated with the inflammatory findings observed 
histopathologically at the injection sites. There were no other treatment -related 
differences fr om the controls amongst the biochemistry or haematological 
parameters.  
At necropsy, at the end of treatment, the only histologic changes due to the test 
items were in the injection sites and iliolumbar and sacral lymph nodes.  In the 
sites injected with ALV AC or gp120s+MF59 , the changes comprised 
inflammatory cell inf iltrates, necrosis, fibrosis, h emorrhage, acellular material and 
mineralization . These findings were often only minimal or slight. In the lymph 
nodes that  drained the injected sites, there was m inimal or slight increased 
lymphoid follicle development, increased paracortex and granulocyte infiltrate.  
There was evidence of partial resolution of the described changes at both injection 
site and lymph nodes, based on necropsy observations after the re covery period.   
In conclusion, under the defined study conditions, seven  intramuscular 
administrations of ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438) vaccine associated with 
gp120s/MF59 (last 4 injections) to the New Zealand White Rabbit at two -week 
intervals  were clinically and locally well tolerated.  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 32 of 184 4.6.1.2  DNA -HIV-PT123 + ALVAC/Bivalent Subtype C gp120 with MF59C.1 or 
AS01 B and ALVAC/Bivalent Subtype C gp120 with AS01 B – Intramuscular 
local tolerability and systemic toxicity (repeated dose, total of 7 doses) 
study in the New Zealand W hite rabbit (Study No. AB20850)  
A GLP local tolerance and toxicity study in rabbits was conducted to evaluate the 
potential toxicity of vaccine regimens consisting of the combination of DNA -
HIV-PT123, ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438) , and Bivalent Subtype C gp120 with MF59 
or AS01 B. 
The test formulations were administered every other week (i.e., days 1, 15, 29, 43, 
57, 71 and 85) during the study via intramuscular injection into the quadriceps 
muscle for all groups.  
Animals were subjected to a full macroscopic examinat ion at necropsy 
(5/group/sex) on day 87 and on day 99 following a two week no -treatment 
recovery period.  
Parameters evaluated during the study period included mortality, clinical and 
cage-side observations, dermal injection site observations, body weights , body 
temperatures, food consumption, ophthalmology, clinical pathology, 
immunogenicity, macroscopic pathology, absolute and relative organ weights, and 
histopathology.  
All animals survived to their scheduled necropsies. Treatment with DNA -HIV-
PT123 + AL VAC/Bivalent Subtype C gp120 administered with MF59C.1 or 
AS01 B adjuvant, as well as ALVAC/Bivalent Subtype C gp120 administered with 
AS01 B adjuvant was well tolerated and there were no effects on systemic clinical 
observations or local reactions, body wei ght, food consumption, and 
ophthalmological evaluations.  
Limited and transient increases in body temperature were noted in some animals 
mainly following ALVAC administration. Reversible treatment -related clinical 
pathology changes indicative of inflammator y reaction consisted of increased 
neutrophil counts, slightly elevated fibrinogen concentration, increased CRP and 
globulin concentrations. Consistent with these changes, and the immune response 
to vaccination, findings were observed histopathologically at  the injection sites 
and in the spleen and draining iliolumbar lymph nodes.  
At the injection sites, histopathological changes consisted of hemorrhage, 
inflammatory changes (mixed inflammatory cell infiltration) and myofiber 
degeneration in the muscular ti ssue in almost all treated rabbits, which accounted 
for the dark appearance of the injection sites noted in some treated rabbits. 
Additional test item -related histopathological changes, such as granulomatous 
changes and presence of foreign material in the injected muscle, were at a low 
incidence. In the draining iliolumbar lymph nodes, there was a test item -related 
increase in development of the lymphoid follicles and paracortical/medullary 
region. In the spleen, there was a test item -related increase in de velopment of 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 33 of 184 lymphoid follicles, which accounted for the increased spleen weight. These 
findings were partially reversible on day 99, two weeks after the last 
administration. There were no relevant differences in the incidence and severity of 
the test item -related changes between the left and right quadriceps muscles and 
between the corresponding draining lymph nodes and between the treatment 
regimens.  
Results of immunogenicity testing confirmed that all sera analyzed from animals 
receiving the DNA vaccine s with gp120/MF59C.1 or gp120/AS01 B and the 
ALVAC vaccine with gp120/AS01 B contained specific antibodies to each 1086.C 
and TV1.C gp120 protein.  
In conclusion, three intramuscular administrations of DNA -HIV PT123 vaccine 
with gp120s/MF59C.1 (group 2) or w ith gp120s/AS01 B (group 4) or of ALVAC 
vaccine alone (group 3) at two -week intervals followed by four intramuscular 
administrations of ALVAC associated with gp120s/MF59C.1 (group 2) or with 
gp120s/AS01 B (groups 3 and 4), at two -week intervals, to the NZW R abbit were 
clinically and locally well tolerated with only slight and partially reversible 
microscopic inflammatory findings at the injection sites . Changes in draining 
lymph node and spleen that correlated with inflammation and/or the immune 
response to v accination. There were no treatment  related effects on body weight 
or food consumption. Limited and transient increases in body temperature were 
noted in some animals mainly following ALVAC administration. Clinical 
pathology findings were limited to signs of inflammation, such as increased 
neutrophil counts, CRP, globulin levels, and fibrinogen.  
The sera of all treated animals contained specific antibodies to each protein 
(1086.C and TV1.C gp120) with no obvious differences between groups.  
4.6.1.3  Other supportive  nonclinical safety studies  
In addition to the nonclinical safety study summarized above, the nonclinical 
safety data from a variety of ALVAC constructs further inform the safety profile 
of ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438). These studies include the following:  
▪ Platform  biodistribution study of ALVAC -HIV in rats ; 
▪ ALVAC viral replication in different cell lines ; 
▪ Virulence of the ALVAC vector versus Vaccinia strains ; 
▪ Single dose toxicity studies by intravenous route with various ALVAC 
recombinants in mice and rats ; 
▪ Repeate d dose toxicity studies using several routes of administration 
(including IM) with various ALVAC recombinants in cynomolgus and 
rhesus monkeys ; 
▪ Local tolerance and sensitization studies with various ALVAC 
recombinants in rabbits ; and   
▪ Hypersensitivity study with ALVAC -HIV (vCP125) in guinea pigs . 
HVTN 120  Version  3.0 / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 34 of 184 The results of these studies show a satisfactory nonclinical safety profile and 
support the administration of the ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438) construct to humans. 
For additional information, see the ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438)  IB. 
4.6.2  Toxicity studies of HIV Env vaccines  
The nonclinical safety of 4 doses of the gp120 proteins included in HVTN 120  
when co -administered with ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438) as a boost after 3 doses of 
ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438) given alo ne (prime), was evaluated in study AB20670 
in New Zealand White Rabbits, as mentioned in section 4.6.1.1 . Overall, the 
immunizations were clinically and locally wel l tolerated.  
The nonclinical safety of 6 doses of the gp120 proteins included in HVTN 120  
when co -administered with DNA -HIV-PT123 , was also evaluated in study 
AB2067 0 in New Zealand White Rabbits. There were no deaths durin g the study. 
No treatment -related clinical signs were reported during the study and treatment 
was locally well tolerated. There was no obvious effect on body temperature. A 
lower body weight gain was noted in males only over the study period. However, 
this was not related with lower food consumption. No treatment -related 
ophthalmological findings were observed at the end of the treatment period. When 
compared to the control group, a slight transient increase in C RP concentration 
was noted mainly after the f irst administration. These effects correlated with the 
inflammatory findings observed histopathologically at the injection sites. An 
increase in creatine kinase was noted after the first administration only. At 
necropsy, at the end of treatment, the only h istologic changes due to the test items 
were in the injection sites and iliolumbar lymph nodes. In the sites injected with 
DNA -HIV-PT123 or gp120s+MF59 , changes comprised fibrosis, h emorrhage, 
acellular material and inflammatory cell infiltrate usually min imal or slight, but 
occasionally more severe. In the lymph nodes that  drained the injected sites, there 
was minimal to moderate increased paracortex and increased lymphoid follicle 
development and minimal granulocyte infiltration . There was evidence of par tial 
resolution of the described changes at both injection site and lymph nodes, based 
on necropsy observations after the recovery period.  In conclusion, under the 
defined study conditions, 6 intramuscular administrations of DNA -HIV-PT123 
vaccine associate d with gp120  proteins adjuvanted with MF59 to New Zealand 
White Rabbit s at two -week intervals  were clinically and locally well tolerated.  
Nonclinical in vivo  Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology studies were 
conducted with early candidate subtype B an d E gp120 Env protein vaccine 
candidates that were subsequently advanced to phase 1 -2 clinical trials. More 
recently, similar subtype B gp140 and subtype C gp140 vaccine candidates with 
MF59  have been tested in nonclinical safety studies. The subtype C gp1 40 
previously tested was from the same strain (HIV -1 TV1) as 1 of the components 
(TV1 gp120) in the proposed Bivalent Subtype C gp120/ MF59  vaccine, and 
hence is very similar in sequence. Overall, toxicology studies revealed that both 
the subtype B gp140 an d subtype C gp140 vaccines with MF59  were well 
tolerated and testing revealed no adverse local or systemic effects.  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 35 of 184 Data from the following nonclinical studies are included in the IB:  
• Subchronic IM toxicity study of Biocine® HIV Thai E gp120/SF 2 gp120 
vaccine in rabbits  
• Repeat dose toxicity of IM HIV DNA/PLG prime followed by IM subtype B 
gp140/ MF59  in rabbits  
• Repeat dose toxicity of intranasal (IN) subtype B gp140 with an LTK63 
adjuvant followed by IM subtype B gp140 with MF59 in rabbits  
• Repeat dose toxicity of IM SAAVI DNA -C2 followed by IM SAAVI MVA -C 
with subtype C gp140/ MF59  in rabbits  
4.6.3  Toxicity studies of MF59   
The nonclinical safety of MF59 co -administered with the gp120 proteins included 
in HVTN 120  in the context of ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438) or DNA -HIV-PT123 
was evaluated in study AB20670 as described in sections 4.6.1.1  and 4.6.1.2  and 
4.6.2 . Overall, the immunizations were clinically and locally well tolerated in 
New Z ealand White Rabbits.  
MF59  is not associated with any potential for systemic toxicity and it has a low 
order of local reactogenicity. In repeat -dose rabbit studies, clinical pathology 
findings of increased fibrinogen and minor inflammatory and degenerativ e 
changes at the injection site are consistent with the effects of IM injections of an 
immunological adjuvant. These findings are readily reversible within days to 1 - 2 
weeks. In repeat -dose toxicology studies in dogs, there were no effects on 
cardiovascu lar or central nervous system (safety pharmacology) parameters. 
MF59  is not genotoxic (Ames test) or clastogenic (mouse micronucleus), is not a 
dermal sensitizer (Guinea pig), and was not teratogenic (rat and rabbit) or a 
developmental toxicant (rat)  [46].  
4.6.4  Toxicity studies of AS01 B 
Toxicology studies performed with AS01 B included:  
• Repeated dose studies (Rabbit, Rat)  
• Local tolerance studies (Rabbit)  
• Safety/pharmacology studies (Rat, Dog)  
• Genotoxicity (micronucleus) studies (Rat)  
The pre -clinical toxicity studies indicated that no treatment -related systemic 
toxicity was associated with single or repeated IM injection of AS01 B, alone or in 
combination with antigens. In addition, no adverse treatment -related effects on 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 36 of 184 male mating performance, fertility, early embryo nic development, pre - and 
postnatal survival, growth or development of the offspring up to day 25 of age 
were associated with repeated IM injection of AS01 B, alone or in combination 
with antigens. AS01 B was considered safe with regard to cardio -respiratory  side 
effects in two different animal species. Moreover, single or repeated IM injection 
of AS01 B did not adversely affect RBC production in the bone marrow. The only 
treatment -related effects of vaccine administration were mild local injection site 
reacti ons. Hematology parameters such as increased WBC and neutrophil counts, 
both related to the local inflammation reaction, were transiently affected.  
Details of these studies and more information are included in the Bivalent 
Subtype C gp120/AS01 B IB. 
4.6.5  Dose -range Immunogenicity study of Bivalent Clade C gp120  (TV1 .C 
and 1086)  / AS01 B in mice  
The objective of this experiment was to assess the dose response relationship of 
bivalent  Clade C gp120  (TV1 .C and 1086) antigens in CB6F1 mice when 
formulated in comb ination with AS01 B, in terms of antigen -specific cellular and 
humoral  responses. Animals were  immunized intramuscularly on day 0, 14 , and 
28 with 10 mcg, 2 mcg, 0.4 mcg, or 0.08 mcg of bivalent (TV1 .C and 1086) 
gp120 antigens formulated with 50 mcL of AS01 B. The induced  T cell and 
antibody responses were characterized at  7 and  14 days post third  dose, 
respectively.  
The Bivalent Subtype C gp120 /AS01 B vaccine formulation elicited 1086C and 
TV1.C-specific  CD4+ T cell  response s for all tested doses. No statistical ly 
significant  differences were  observed between doses,  however, a trend for higher 
1086C -specific CD4+ T cell  responses was observed with lower dose s of 1086 -
TV1.C / AS01 B (Figure 4-7-Panel A). This was not  observed when measuring the 
TV1.C-specific CD4+ T cell responses  (Figure 4-7-Panel B). The  vaccine -
induced CD8+ T cell responses at 7 days after third immunization were low to  
undetectable for both , TV1 and 1086 responses. The Bivalent Subtype C  gp120  
antigens adjuvanted in AS01 B induced dose -dependent high level s of 1086C and 
TV1.C-specific  antibody responses at 14 days p ost second and third  immunization 
(Figure 4-7-Panel C). Moreover, for all  antigen doses tested, similar levels of  
1086C and TV1 .C specific total immunoglobulin (Ig) re sponses were  observed,  
suggesting that there is no negative impact on the humoral responses when 
combining  1086C and TV1 .C antigens in AS01 B. Anti -V1V2 total Ig responses 
were also detected in  all the groups ( Figure 4-7-Panel D).

4.6.6  Evaluation of the need for using an adjuvant system to induce potent 
bivalent Subtype C gp120 (1086.C & TV1.C) -specif ic binding 
antibodies and cellular responses in CB6F1 mice (20150024)  
To assess the need for an adjuvant system to elicit potent binding antibody and 
CD4+ T cell responses, the immunogenicity of the bivalent 1086.C & TV1.C 
gp120 antigens was characterized following immunization of CB6F1 mice 
(hybrid of C57Bl/6 and BALB/C mice) with 2 μg of each gp120 antigens, without 
adjuvant or formulated with 50 μg Al(OH)3 or 50 μL AS01 B (containing 5 μg 
MPL and 5 μg QS -21 Stimulon® in a liposome -based formulation). Animals 
received IM injections at days 0, 14 and 28, and the T cell and antibody responses 
were characterized at 14 days post -second and third dose. The non -adjuvanted 
bivalent 1086.C & TV1.C gp120 antigens elicited detec table but low levels of 
binding antibodies with geometric mean titers (GMT) of 1973 and 1145, 
respectively, at 14 days post -third dose ( Figure 4-8, A and B). Al(OH)3 
formulation significantly increased the binding antibody titers up to 8807 (anti -
1086.C GMT) and 4698 (anti -TV1.C GMT) and the AS01 B-based formulation 
elicited the highest binding antibody responses reaching anti -1086.C and anti -
TV1.C binding antibody tite rs of 32936 and 31860 respectively (GMTs) ( Figure 
4-8, A and B). Post -third immunization, cross -reactive anti -V1V2 binding 
antibody responses (gp70 - V1V2 scaffold Subt ype B/Case A2) were detected with 
the strongest titers measured when the bivalent Subtype C gp120 antigens were 
formulated with AS01 B, although some animals remained negative ( Figure 4-8, 
C). 
Very low to undetectable 1086.C - and TV1.C -specific CD4+ T cell responses 
were measured at 14 days post -third immunization with the bivalent Subtype C 
gp120 antigens alone or formulated with Al(OH)3. In contrast, the bivalent 
Subtype C gp120/AS01 B formulation elicited robust 1086.C - and TV1.C -specific 
CD4+ T cell responses (medians of 1% and 0.75% respectively) 14 days post -
third dose ( Figure 4-9). All together these data show that the bivalent Subtype C 
gp120 antigens (1086.C & TV1.C, 2 μg each) formulated with AS01 B elicit potent 
1086.C & TV1.C gp120 -specific antibody and CD4+ T cell responses in CB6F1 
mice, with higher intensities as compared to Al(OH)3 or non -adjuvanted 
formulations, supporting the use of AS01 B for further clinical development.

adjuvant systems to formulate the bivalent Su btype C gp120 
antigens in CB6 F1 mice: Acute and persistent responses (20150168)  
The immunogenicity of the bivalent 1086.C & TV1.C gp120 Tox lots was 
characterized following immunization of CB6F1 mice (hybrid of C57Bl/6 and 
BALB/C mice) with a dose range o f gp120 antigens (0.4 μg, 2 μg or 10 μg each), 
formulated with either 50 μL MF59 or 50 μL AS01 B. As a benchmark, mice were 
immunized with 2 μg of the consolidation lots of the bivalent Subtype C gp120 
formulated with 50 μL AS01 B. Animals received IM inject ions at days 0, 14 and 
28, and the T cell and antibody responses were monitored at 7 days or 14 days 
post-third dose respectively. The bivalent Subtype C gp120 formulated in AS01 B 
elicited potent 1086.C - and TV1.C -specific CD4+ T cell responses according t o 
an inverse dose -range, suggesting that a high amount of antigen may trigger 
regulatory mechanisms leading to a decreased intensity of the induced -CD4+ T 
cell responses (Figure 4-10, A and B). In contrast, very low to undetectable 
gp120 -specific CD4+ T cell responses were measured following immunizations 
with the bivalent Subtype C gp120 formulated in MF59. At 2.5 months post 
immunization, bivalent Subtype C gp120s -specific CD4+ T cells were still 
detectable (frequencies of ~0.5%) in animals immunized with the AS01 B-based 
formulations (Figure 11, A and B).  
The bivalent Subtype C gp120 antigens formulated in AS01 B or MF59 induced 
dose dependent high levels of anti -1086. C and TV1.C antibody responses at 14 
days post third immunization ( Figure 4-10, C and D). The intensities of both anti -
1086.C and TV1.C antibody responses were statis tically significantly higher after 
immunization with the AS01 B-based formulations as compared to MF59 -based 

HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 41 of 184 formulations at all gp120 doses tested. Interestingly, very good persistence was 
observed for the anti -1086.C and TV1.C binding antibody responses a t 2 months 
post-last immunization, with both adjuvant systems tested (MF59 and AS01 B) and 
these responses were still statistically significantly higher for the AS01 B 
formulations as compared to the MF59 formulations ( Figure 4-11). All together,  
these data show that the bivalent Subtype C gp120 antigens (1086.C & TV1.C) 
formulated with AS01 B elicit potent 1086.C & TV1.C gp120 -specific antibody 
and CD4+ T cell responses with higher intensities than MF59 -based formulations 
in CB6F1mice.

4.7 Clinical studies  
4.7.1  Clinical studies with ALVAC -HIV 
The proposed ALVAC -HIV vaccine candidate specific for Southern Africa is 
ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438). The vaccine is very similar  to ALVAC -HIV (vCP1521) 
(the ALVAC -HIV used in the RV144 trial) since it contains the same gag, pro 
and gp41  env TM components. However, it has been adapted to include 96 ZM651  
gp120  env insert (subtype C) (rather than the TH023 gp120 env insert [subtype E] 
used for the RV144 study regimen in Thailand).  
ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438) is currently being investigated in the ongoing trial 
HVTN 100.  
4.7.2  HVTN 100  
HVTN 100 enrolled 252 participants (210 received vaccine and 42 placebo) 
between February and May 2015. All month  12 injections were complete d by 2  
June 2016 .  

HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 43 of 184 4.7.2.1  Interim summary of blinded safety and tolerability data  
Blinded safety data reported as of July 7, 2016  are summarized here.  A total of 
1198 ALVAC or placebo injections were given to participants in the left deltoid 
and 703 Bivalent Subt ype C gp120/MF59 or placebo injection s were given to 
participants in the right deltoid.  
The vaccine regimen is very well tolerated thus far with the vast majority 
experiencing no or mild local reactogenicity symptoms.  Mild pain and/or 
tenderness were  reported by 58% of participants for injections in the left deltoid 
and by 48% for injections in the right deltoid.  Moderate pain and/or tenderness 
were  reported by 18% of participants for injections in the left deltoid and by 11% 
for injections in the right de ltoid. Severe pain and/or tenderness was reported 
from a left deltoid injection by 1 participant (at injection timepoint #1) and for a 
right deltoid injection by 2 participants (1 at injection timepoint #3 and 1 at 
injection timepoint #5).  
For the left de ltoid, grade 1 (mild) erythema and/or induration injection site 
reactions  were reported by 6% of participants and grade 2 (moderate) reactions by 
5% of participants. For the right deltoid, grade 1 erythema and/or induration 
injection site reactions were re ported by 4% of participants and grade 2 reactions 
by 2% of participants. Three participants have reported erythema and/or 
induration reactions meeting grade 3 criteria ( severe ) based on size ( ≥ 10cm 
diameter or ≥ 100cm2 surface area) with no complications (such as ulceration, 
secondary infection, phlebitis, sterile abscess or drainage). One person reported a 
grade 3  right deltoid erythema reaction (>  100 cm 2) occurring on day 2 of the 
fourth  injection timepoint , which re solved within 4 days. Th is participant also 
self-reported severe induration on day 3, which resolved within 1 day. The 
participant returned to clinic on day 4 for examination, and clinic staff observed 
severe erythema alone without induration or swelling. Antibiotics, analgesics , and 
antihistamines were prescribed and the participant was discontinued from further 
vaccinations but continued i n follow -up. Another person reported grade 3 
induration and erythema in the right deltoid on day 3 after the fifth vaccination 
timepoint, resolving by day 5. Antibiotics , anti-inflammatory and analgesic 
medications were prescribed and were taken for 3 days. Another person reported 
severe erythema and  induration reactions in the left deltoid occurring on day 0 
after the fifth vaccination timepoint and resolving by day 3. Antihistamine, oral 
steroid and analgesic/anti -inflammatory medications were taken. In all 3 
participants, the needle used for injection was <  1.5 inches long, consistent with 
weight -based guidance for need le length choice provided to sites in the SSPs 
[47,48] .  
Systemic reactions have been reported in 6 9% of participants thus far, with the 
vast majority of those reactions being mild in intensity . Malaise and/or fatigue, 
headache, myalgia and arthralgia appear to be the most common reactions, 
occurring in 42%, 41%, 37% and 30% of participants, respectively thus far. Other 
systemic reactogenicity symptoms have included nausea (1 5%), chills ( 10%), 
fever (8%), and vomiting ( 4%). Maximum severity of systemic symptoms of 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 44 of 184 moderate intensity has been reported in a total of 1 9% of participants; 7% 
reported systemic symptoms of moderate intensity after the first injection, 3% 
after the second , 5% after the third, 2% after the fourth  and 5% after the fifth. 
Severe systemic reaction s, have occurred in 2% of participants (4 participants): 2 
participants with severe arthralgia occurring after the first injection , 1 person with 
severe malaise and/or fatigue and 1 w ith severe headache, each after the fifth 
injection . 
4.7.2.2  Interim summary of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse E vents 
(SAEs)  
As of July 7,  2016, 468 adverse events (AEs) have occurred in 1 80 participants  
(71.4% of participants), of which 288 AEs (61.5%) were mild, 163 were 
moderate, (34.8%), 13 (2.8%) were classified as severe, 3 (0.6%) were classified 
as potentially life -threatening, and 1 (0.2%) was fatal  (see details in the next 
paragraph) . AEs were re ported by participants most frequently in the Systems 
Organ Class (SOC) Infections and infestations (107 participants [42.4% of 
enrolled participants]), followed by the SOC Investigations (55 participants 
[21.8%]). Fifteen AEs occurring in 11 participants have been assessed by the site 
investigator as being related to study product ; 12 were mild, 3 were moderate and 
none were severe . These include injection site pruritus in 3 individuals (mild in 2, 
moderate in 1), lymphadenopathy in 2 individuals  (both mil d), abdominal pain  
(moderate) , generalized pruritus (moderate), and mild events of diarrhea,  injection 
site nodule,  gastritis, dizziness, headache, neutrophil count decreased, and oral 
paresthesia  in 1 individual each .  
Seven  SAEs have occurred in 5 participants during the trial, all unrelated to study 
product. One participant experienced 3 separate SAE events resulting from 3 
separate assault attacks: severe soft tissue injurie s due to assault, potentially life -
threatening subdural hematoma , and then  multiple injuries to the head and chest 
that were fatal. SAEs  in other participants were  gastrointestinal infection, bi-polar 
mood  disorder , acute rheumatic fever, and transient ischemic attack . 
4.7.2.3  Discontinued vaccinations and early  terminations  
As of July 14, 2016, 17 participants have terminated the study prematurely and 16 
participants have discontinued vaccinations. Clinical events leading to early 
terminations and discontinuation of vaccinations (DOV) occurred in 5 
participants: death from multiple inju ries (unrelated to study product); severe 
local reactogenicity (DOV); hypertension (DOV for AE unrelated to study 
product); mild vomiting occurring on the day of first vaccination only (participant 
declined further study participation); psychiatric diagnos is (DOV and early 
termination for investigator discretion). Six other participants have terminated the 
study due to HIV infection. Reasons for DOV or early termination in other 
participants included participant refusal, unable to contact, unable to schedul e 
within visit windows, unable to adhere to study schedule, relocation, desiring to 
fall pregnant, desiring to donate eggs, unwilling to use contraception, and

4.7.2.4  Summary of Interim Immunogenicity data from HVTN 100  
The immunological criteria guiding  the decision whether to advance development 
of the ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438), Bivalent Subtype C gp120/MF59 regimen  into 
efficacy testing  in adults in South Africa  (HVTN  702) are described in Table 4-7. 
Immunogenicity data from samples collected from HVTN 100 participants at the 
month 6.5 timepoint (2 weeks post month  6 vaccination) were  compared to data 
from a new, randomly selected subset of stored samples from RV144 vaccine 
recipients who were HIV -1 uninfected upon completion of follow -up (the RV144 
“comparator arm”). Samples from the RV144 comparator arm and HVTN 1 00 
participants were  analyzed contemporaneously using qualified assays in the same 
laboratories (along with placebo samples for blinding).  
All four immunogenicity Go criteria were met.

well as the two Clade C strains in the bivalent gp 120 protein boost  (Figure 4-12). 
Antibody magnitude values measured by geometric mean titers were 3.6 -8.8 fold 
greater than IgG binding antibody to va ccine -matched responses to Env antigens 
included in RV144 ( Table 4-8). Hence,  criteria 1 and 2 were met.

CD4 responses (criterion 3)  
The CD4+ T cell response rate to vaccine -matched Env sequences in ALVAC 
(vCP2438), ( Env peptide pool 96ZM651) in HVTN 100 participants was 58%. 
This was compared to the CD4+ T cell response rate to vaccine -matched Env 
sequences in ALVAC (vCP1521),  (Env peptide pool 92TH023) in RV144 
participants of 41%. The response rate difference ( HVTN 100-RV144) was 16% 
(95% CI: 6, 16%; p-value  0.0019). This exceeded the LL response rate difference 
of -30% and therefore met criterion #3.

of IgG antibodies to the Clade C V1V2 loop in at least one vaccine antigen must 
be at a  lower limit threshold of >  56% (which equates to a response rate of 63%)

Extensive previous experience with other ALVAC -HIV vaccines inform s the 
expected safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity profile of the new vaccine (see 
Table 4-10). In all, more than 10,000 people  have received ALVAC -HIV vaccines 
in clinical trials. The majority of these trials have been performed with ALVAC -
HIV (vCP205), (vCP1452), or (vCP1521). These vaccines differ in the  HIV gene 
inserts that have been  introduced into the ALVAC vector.

ALVAC -HIV (vCP205) is an ALVAC vector vaccine with genetic inserts of the 
HIV-1 gag gene (expressing the Gag p55 -polyprotein of the HIV -1 LAI strain 
[clade B]), a fragment of the pol gene (that expresses the p15 Protease of the HIV -
1 LAI strain), and a portion of the env gene (expressing the gp120 Env 
glycoprotein of the HIV -1 MN strain [clade B], and the anchoring TM region of 
gp41 of the HIV -1 LAI strain). The HIV genes are inserted in the C3 locus.  
ALVAC -HIV (vCP1452) vaccine is an ALVAC vector vaccine  expressing the 
products of the HIV -1 env (Env gp160 protein of the HIV -1 MN Strain [ clade B]) 
and gag (HIV -1 LAI strain [clade B]) genes, the protease portion of the pol gene 
on a synthetic polynucleotide encompassing the known human CTL epitopes from 
the nef (BRU Strain) and the pol (LAI strain) gene products. The C3 locus was 
used for the insertion of the HIV -1 env and gag gene sequences and the C5 locus 
was used for the insertion of the sequences encoding the HIV -1 Nef and Pol CTL 
epitopes.  
ALVAC -HIV (vCP1521) vaccine was generate d by co -insertion of genes 
encoding HIV -1 gene products into the ALVAC genome in the C6 locus. The 
inserted HIV -1 gene sequences are: the region of the env gene encoding the

4.7.4  Clinical safety experience with related ALVAC -HIV vaccines  
4.7.4.1  Summary of safety, reactogenicity, and tolerability from related human 
experience  
The tolerability and safety of ALVAC -HIV (vCP1521) were evaluated initially in 
2 phase 1 -2 studies in Tha iland [49,50] . The most relevant data, however, com e 
from the RV144  efficacy study performed in Thailand [4,51] , during which more 
than 8000 human subjects received the vaccine and ALVAC -HIV (vCP1521) was 
found to be safe and well tolerated. Vaccine recipients experienced local and/or 
systemic reactions  significantly more frequently than placebo recipients; the 
frequencies of local reactions such as pain and tenderness were higher than those 
of systemic reactions such as headache, fatigue, arthralgia and myalgia; fever was 
rarely reported; ALVAC -HIV (vCP 1521) was associated with a higher frequency 
of local reactions compared to the protein subunit used in the study (AIDSVAX 
B/E); the frequency of both local and systemic reactions gradually declined with 
subsequent vaccine administrations; most local and s ystemic reactogenicity 
symptoms were mild to moderate, resolving rapidly and spontaneously in the vast 
majority of cases; and the frequencies of adverse events ( AEs) and Serious 
Adverse Events ( SAEs ) were not different between vaccine and placebo groups. 
Overall, results with ALVAC -HIV (vCP1521) are consistent with other ALVAC -
HIV constructs, supporting the conclusion that the safety, reactogenicity and 
tolerability profile of ALVAC -HIV is determined in greater measure by the vector 
than by the HIV genetic material inserted into it.  
Prior to the RV144 study, De Bruyn et al [52] characterized the tolerability and 
safety profile of ALVAC -HIV (vCP205) and ALVAC -HIV (vCP1452) (along 
with other ALVAC -vector  vaccines ) based on data from more than 1,000 clinical 
trial subjects. The authors concluded that:  
▪  ALVAC -HIV vaccines were safe and well tolerated, with a reactogenicity 
profile comparable to that of existing vaccines licensed for use in adults; and  
▪ Reactogenicity was similar for different ALVAC -HIV constructs, suggesting 
that reactogenicity is determined in greater measure by the vector than by the 
additional genetic material inserted into the vector.  
Of interest as well was the observation that rea ctogenicity seemed to differ 
according to certain demographic variables: Black, non -Hispanic participants 
reported significantly less reactogenicity than did White, non -Hispanic 
participants; and males reported less pain than females.

4.7.4.2  Summary of pregnancy occurrence and outcomes  
In study RV144 , over a period of 3.5 years of follow -up, among women  a total of 
967 (30.6%) vaccine (vCP1521) and 955 (30.1%) placebo recipients reported a 
pregnancy  during the study , with 139 vaccine and  116 placebo recipients 
reporting  more than  1 pregnancy. Birth was reported for 1843 infants, 14 of them 
representing 7 twin pairs. Of these, 277 births (137 vaccine and 140 placebo 
recipients; 1 twin pair per treatme nt) occurred within 450 days of study entry. For 
these infants, birth weight, gestational age and Apgar scores were similar between 
the vaccine and placebo groups. Three congenital abnormalities (1 vaccine and 2 
placebo recipients) were reported among thes e 277 births, the vaccine group 
abnormality being a respiratory distress syndrome with patent ductus arteriosus . 
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes were experienced in 165 out of 3 ,165 (5.2%) 
female vaccine recipients and 139 out of 3 ,169 (4.4%) female placebo re cipients 
(p = 0.13), and in 17.1% and 14.6% (p = 0.13) of vaccine and placebo 
pregnancies, respectively [51]. 
A total of 15 of the 245 female subjects became pregnant during the AVEG 
studies. Twelve subjects received ALVAC -HIV (vCP205) and 3 received 
placebo. Of these 15 subjects aged 19 to 37 years, 9 subjects had live births, 3 
subjects had elective abortions, 1 subject had a spontaneous abort ion, and the 
outcome of 2 pregnancies remains unknown. Of the 9 live births, 3 were by 
caesarean section. Overall, no complications during pregnancy or congenital 
abnormalities at the time of birth were reported.  
In study HVTN 203 [53] there were 2 participants with miscarriages among the 
total of 80 female study participants who received ALVAC -HIV (vCP1452). 
These events were classified as unrelated to the study product by the 
investigators.  
4.7.4.3  Summary of safety and tolerability data in African studies that have used 
ALVAC -HIV 
To date, 3 studies have been conducted and completed in Africa with ALVAC -
HIV: HIVNET 007 , HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 027 , and HVTN 
097.  
HIVNET 007 [54] was a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled clinical 
trial conducted in Kampala, Uganda. In this study, 40 HIV -seronegative Ugandan 
volunteers were randomly assigned to receive ALVAC -HIV (vCP205) (n = 20), 
control ALVAC containing the rabies virus glycoprotein G gene (n = 10), or 
saline placebo (n = 10). Adverse reactions to immunizations were similar to those 
in previous trials with these vaccines in HIV -seronegative volunteers in the 
United States. No severe (grade 3 or 4) adverse reactions attrib utable to receipt of 
the vaccine were observed.  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 51 of 184 HPTN 027 [55] was a phase 1 randomi zed, single -center, double -blind, placebo -
controlled trial that evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of ALVAC -HIV 
(vCP1521) in infants born to HIV -1 infected women in Uganda. Sixty  infants 
were enrolled ; 48 in the active group and 12 in the placebo grou p. Forty -seven 
infants received all 4 vaccinations and completed follow -up (38 in the vaccine 
arm and 9 in the placebo arm). There were 3 deaths in the HPTN 027 study (2 in 
the vaccine group and 1 in the placebo group); all were reported as unrelated to 
the vaccine. The deaths included pneumonia -like illness, cor pulmonale secondary 
to congenital heart disease complicated by pneumonia, and gastroenteritis 
complicated with electrolyte imbalance. The rate of SAEs was similar between 
groups (56% in the vaccine  group and 50% in the placebo group). Thirteen infants 
in HPTN 027 experienced an AE that led to discontinuation of vaccinations: 10 
subjects in the vaccine group and 3 in the placebo group. There were no severe or 
life-threatening reactogenicity events. M ild reactogenicity events were common 
in both study arms, with only 1 moderate event (irritability) in the placebo arm 
and 7 in the vaccine group (erythema, induration, pain, fever, and irritability).  
HVTN  097 was designed to evaluate whether the same vacc ine regimen (with a 
higher dose of ALVAC -HIV) that was used in Thailand in Study RV144 would 
be comparably safe and immunogenic in a South African population. The study 
enrolled 100 healthy, HIV -1–uninfected participants aged 18 to 40 years, 51 male 
and 49  female. One hundred percent were black, non -Hispanic. Ninety -one 
participants completed vaccinations and follow -up. The study was completed in 
December 2013. There were 4 participants who discontinued vaccinations, 2 due 
to pregnancy and 2 due to “other” reason; there were no discontinuations due to 
AEs or reactogenicity.  
Local and systemic reactogenicity was assessed for the investigational ALVAC -
HIV (vCP1521) and AIDSVAX vaccinations. Local injection site reactions of 
pain and/or tenderness were more com mon in participants receiving active HIV 
vaccinations versus placebo injections. Most pain and/or tenderness reactions to 
the HIV vaccinations were mild (48%), 28% were moderate (similar rates for 
ALVAC compared to the AIDSVAX vaccinations) and approximate ly 9% were 
severe (all but 1 severe pain/tenderness reactions were from ALVAC 
vaccination). In placebo recipients, the maximum pain and/or tenderness reactions 
were mild (52%). The majority of participants in both active (Group [G]1 and G2 
combined) and pl acebo groups experienced no erythema and/or induration 
reactions (84% and 95%, respectively); with all but 1 reaction (> 9 cm 
erythema/induration from an ALVAC vaccination) being non -gradable by the 
Division of AIDS (DAIDS) AE Grading Table (0 -25 cm 2), occ urring in G1. 
Moderate or severe systemic reactions associated with vaccine administration 
included malaise and/or fatigue (15% versus 5.3% in placebo), myalgia (12.5% 
versus 0% in placebo), headache (7.5% versus 21% in placebo), nausea (1.25% 
versus 0% in  placebo), chills (3.75% versus. 5.3% in placebo), and arthralgia 
(6.25% versus 0% in placebo). The maximum temperature elevations were Grade 
2, which occurred in 2 vaccinees compared to 0 in placebo. Overall 88.75% of 
vaccine recipients experienced at lea st 1 AE compared to 85% of placebo 
recipients. There were 2 SAEs and both were unrelated to treatment: thermal burn

HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 52 of 184 in a vaccinee and substance -induced psychotic disorder in a placebo recipient. 
There were no Grade 4 (life threatening) or 5 (death) AEs. Th ere were 5 Grade 3 
AEs in vaccine recipients (6.25%) and 2 Grade 3 events in 1 placebo recipient 
(5.3%), all deemed unrelated to study treatment. These included alanine 
transaminase (ALT) increase, headache, hypertension, abnormal loss of weight, 
and therm al burn in vaccinees and substance -induced psychotic disorder and 
abnormal loss of weight in 1 placebo recipient. Moderate AEs were experienced 
by 61.25% of vaccinees and 50% of placebo recipients. AEs considered related to 
the vaccine included itching at the injection site, lymph node swelling, faster 
heartbeat, abdominal pain, flu -like illness, diarrhea, injection site skin lump, and 
muscle spasms. Each of these reactions were mild or moderate, only occurred in 1 
person (except for the skin lump which occ urred in 3 participants), and did not 
last long. All participants recovered without sequelae. A few participants had 
changes in their laboratory, blood, and urine test results that were considered 
related to the vaccinations and all returned to normal. Ove rall, the study indicated  
that the vaccine regimen used in RV144 appears safe and well -tolerated in South 
Africans . 
4.7.4.4  Previous human experience with ALVAC -HIV used in combination with 
subunit protein boost adjuvanted with MF59  
There has been meaningful previ ous human experience with the use of ALVAC -
HIV vaccines in combination with recombinant gp120 proteins adjuvanted with 
MF59 . In addition to the exposures that occurred in the context of study HVTN

4.7.5  Immunogenicity  experience with related ALVAC -HIV vaccines  
4.7.5.1  Summary of immunogenicity from related  human experience  
Immunogenicity measures in ALVAC -HIV studies have evolved over a period of 
more than 2 decades, informed by evolution in knowledge about relevant immune 
responses. Initial studies focused on the measurement of CTL  activity, CD4+ T -
cell lymphoproliferation,  and nAb activity. Subsequent studies have focused on 
Ab binding to the Env glycoproteins and on intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) 
as well. Most recently, a large collaborative consortium performed a case -control 
study to evaluate immune CoR based on t he RV144 study that used the prime -
boost regimen of ALVAC -HIV (vCP1521) and the gp120 protein AIDSVAX  B/E 
[5]. 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 54 of 184 The development of assays for measuring immunogenicity has evolved during 
more than 20 years of testing in humans . Therefore, immunogenicity data cannot 
be fully integrated. However, extensive data from previous studies with ALVAC -
HIV can inform many relevant immunogenicity -related issues as described below.  
4.7.5.2  ALVAC -protein schedule and immunogenicity  
The selection of a vaccination schedule for the large efficacy tr ial in Thailand 
(RV144) was based on existing scientific knowledge at the time [62]. In addition 
to safety, the key parameters taken into consideration were the CTL immune 
responses and the nAb responses. The HIV vaccine field has evolved significantly 
since then and t he relevance of these immune measures is currently debated. 
However, the demonstration of vaccine protection in RV144 mandates the 
conservation of vaccination regimen features that are believed to have contributed 
to vaccine protection, even when the mecha nism of protection has not been 
definitely established. The following paragraphs summarize the considerations 
that were taken into account in the selection of a vaccine regimen an d schedule 
for the RV144 study.  
Prior to RV144, several schedules of administ ration with ALVAC and protein 
boost were examined in multiple clinical trials [56,58,63 -65]. While the studies 
were not designed or powered to discriminate statistically between the various 
vaccination schedules, an analysis of the data suggested that 4 doses of ALVAC 
induced better CTL responses than 3 or 2 doses. Specifical ly, net point prevalence 
CTL response rates on days 182 and 273 using 4 -dose immunization regimens 
(month s 0, 1, 3, and 6 or month s 0, 1, 6, and 9) produced higher response rates 
than the 3 -dose regimen ( month s 0, 1, and 6) on days 182 and 273. Regarding 
neutralization data, both ALVAC schedules (ALVAC alone and ALVAC plus 
subunit protein boost), showed significantly higher neutralization response rates 
compared to the control schedule.  
The addition of a subunit protein boost to ALVAC did not appear to alt er the CTL 
response rates [64]. In contrast, the protein boost had a significant effect on Ab 
responses. The ALVAC plus subunit protein boost schedule had significantly 
higher nAb response rates when compared to the ALVAC alone schedule.  
On the basis of these observations, a 4-dose regimen ( month s 0, 1, 3, and 6) of 
ALVAC was proposed in order to maximize CTL responses. In addition, 2 doses 
of the protein boost were proposed at months 3 and 6 to maximize Ab responses. 
The RV144 study implemented this vaccination schedule.  
4.7.5.3  Immunogenicity of ALVAC used in combination with protein boost plus 
MF59  
The vaccine regimen proposed for development in South Africa combines 
ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438) with a bivalent recombinant gp120 protein (total of 200  
mcg, 100  mcg of each protein) adjuvanted  with MF59. Both vaccine components

HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 55 of 184 Africa (clade C). Interim  immunogenicity  data from HVTN 100 are summarized 
in Section 4.7.2.4 . Studies prior to HVTN 100  with related vaccines provide d 
useful preliminary information on whether peak immunogenicity is expected to be 
at least similar to that elicited by the RV144 regimen and whether the use of 
MF59 could be dose -sparing for the protein.  
Study RV132 [50] used ALVAC -HIV (vCP1521) in the same dose and schedule 
as in study RV144 but 45 subjects in 1 of the study arms received a bivalent 
recombinant gp120 protein manufactured in CHO cells by Novartis Vaccines and 
adjuvanted with MF59 as a protein boost. The dose of the proteins was 150 mcg 
in total (100 mcg of the CM23 5 protein and 50 mcg of the SF2 protein). Study 
RV135 [49] used ALVAC -HIV (vCP1521) in the same dose and schedule as in 
study RV144, and 97 subjects in 2 study arms received a bivalent recombinant 
gp120 protein manufactured in CHO cells by VaxGen/Global Solutions for 
Infectious Diseases (GSID) and adjuvanted with alum as a protein boost. The 
study explored 2 doses of the proteins: a total dose of 200 m cg (100 mcg for the 
A244 protein and 100 mcg for the MN protein) and a total dose of 600 mcg (300 
mcg each of the same proteins in the lower dose formulation). The vaccine 
regimen with ALVAC -HIV and 600 mcg of gp120 protein adjuvanted with alum 
was utilize d in study RV144. Table 4-12 summarizes the nAb response rates for 
the pertinent study arms from these studies.

4.7.6  Clinical studies with HIV -1 subunit protein vaccines  
For description of interim safety/tolerability and im munogenicity results from 
HVTN 100, see Section  4.7.2.4 . 
In addition, o ther closely related recombinant monomeric (gp120) subunit vaccine 
formulations from GSK  Vaccines (formerly Novartis) have been tested in clinical 
trials. In addition, recombinant oligomeric (o -gp140) Env proteins for subtypes B 
and C from Novartis have been or are currently in clinical trials. Overall, in these 
studies, recombinant HIV -Env prote ins manufactured by Novartis were well 
tolerated and immunogenic. In most cases, recombinant HIV -Env proteins (either 
gp120 or gp140) were CHO -based and administered with MF59 , Novartis’ 
proprietary oil -in-water emulsion adjuvant [66]. MF59  safety has been established 
in clinical studies as well as in commercial products. A seasonal influenza vaccine 
adjuvanted with MF59  (Fluad®) is licensed in the EU and other countries for use 
in the elderly. MF59  is als o used in a prepandemic H5N1 influenza vaccine 
(Aflunov®) licensed in the EU for use in adults, and in 2 pandemic H1N1 
influenza vaccines (Focetria® and Celtura®), licensed in the EU and other 
countries for use in adults and children. More than 100 million  doses of MF59 -
adjuvanted influenza vaccines have been distributed in licensed products.  
Recombinant monomeric (gp120) vaccine candidates studied include Chiron’s 
early gp120 -based candidates from subtypes B and E, most of which were CHO -
based and administered with MF59 . More than 1200 subjects participated in the 
evaluation of the Chiron HIV SF2 gp120/ MF59  vaccine and the Chiron HIV 
CM235 Thai E gp120/ MF59  vaccine [45,50,60,67 -69]. Two clinical trials were 
conducted usi ng Novartis CHO -based subtype B gp140 recombinant Env protein 
with MF59 . There are 3 ongoing phase 1 studies with Novartis CHO -based 
subtype C gp140/ MF59  being conducted by the NIH -sponsored HVTN in the US 
and the RSA. Table 4-14 summarizes clinical trial experience with Novartis 
gp120 and gp140 recombinant vaccine candidates.

In general, these recombinant protein vaccines were immunogenic and well 
tolerated with no unusual or serious vaccine -associated AEs reported. Most of the 
reactions were mild to moderate in nature, and of short duration [4,45,50,60,67 -
71]. 
4.7.6.1  Summary of safety, reactogenicity, and tolerability from recent human 
experience  
For description of interim safety/tolerability results from HVTN 100, see Section 
4.7.2.4  
In addition, two other  clinical trials have been conducted recently using Novartis 
CHO -based subtype B gp140 with MF59 and  there have been 4 recent  clinical 
trials using Novartis CHO -based subtype C gp140.  
A phase 1 single -center trial (C86P1) was conducted using Novartis CHO -based 
subtype B gp140 recombinant Env protein in Great Britain by the Mucosal 
Vaccines for Poverty Related Diseases (MUVAPRED) Consortium t o assess 
safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of IN administration of subtype B gp140 
with and without the mucosal adjuvant LTK63 (detoxified mutant heat labile 
protein) followed by IM boosting with subtype B gp140/ MF59 . This study 
enrolled 30 healthy volunteers aged 18 -45 years , with 20 to receive gp140. The 
protocol was amended to halt further IN administration of LTK63 following a 
report of an AE (ie, facial nerve paralysis) with a possible association with the 
LTK63 adjuvant in another study [72]. During the study, there was 1 SAE 
reported of Bell’s Palsy (facial nerve paralysis) considered poss ibly related to the 
study vaccine LTK63 in a subject who never received any subtype B gp140 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12 , 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 58 of 184 protein or any protein with MF59  adjuvant. IN vaccination was reactogenic 
resulting in upper respiratory tract symptoms including nasal congestion, nasal 
discomfort , pharyngolaryngeal pain and rhinorrhea. The subtype B gp140 MF59  
was well tolerated following IM boost.  
Another completed study with Novartis subtype B gp140 MF59  was a 
multicenter, placebo -controlled trial (HVTN 049) conducted by the HVTN in the 
US[73]. Subjects received  1 of 3 doses of a DNA/PLG vaccine (subtype B gag 
DNA/PLG and subtype B env DNA/PLG microparticles, at doses of 250/250, 
500/500, or 1000/1000 mcg) or placebo (5 to 1 ratio) as a single IM injection at 0, 
1 and 2 months, followed by a boost of subtype B gp140 with MF59  (or placebo) 
at 6 and 9 months. An additional group of subjec ts received subtype B gp140 with 
MF59  without DNA prime, administered at 0, 3, and 9 months. Overall 96 
healthy, HIV -1–uninfected adult subjects were enrolled and 86 subjects 
completed all planned vaccinations. There were no SAEs reported as related to 
study vaccine. There were 4 events reported as SAEs that were not considered 
related to the study vaccine. A death attributed to cocaine overdose occurred in  1 
subject, 10 days after receipt of the second dose of the placebo. One subject had a 
Grade 3 increas e in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) to 2311 U/L, 14  days after the 
first DNA prime vaccination, which resolved within a week. Another subject had 
a Grade 4 increase in CPK to 4806 U/L 15 days after the first DNA prime 
vaccination, which resolved within 2 weeks. Both subjects reported to have 
initiated new exercise programs. One subject experienced severe fatigue 20 days 
after the fourth immunization (including  1 dose of subtype B gp140/ MF59 ), 
attributed to working 2 jobs and long hours. Overall, the regimens were generally 
well tolerated.  
A third study, HVTN 073E, was conducted in the US and the Republic of South 
Africa (RSA) as an extension to the previous HVTN 073/SAAVI03 study. This 
extension study examined the safety and immunogenicity of 2 boosting doses  of 
Novartis subtype C gp140/ MF59  or placebo in subjects who previously received 3 
vaccinations of SAAVI DNA -C2 and 2 vaccinations of SAAVI MVA -C. This 
study enrolled 27 subjects. There was 1 report of endometrial intra -epithelial 
neoplasia resulting in ho spitalization for hysterectomy, which was assessed as 
unrelated to study agents.  
Two other recent  phase 1 studies with Novartis subtype C gp140/ MF59  have been  
conducted by the HVTN in the US and RSA . In addition, 1  phase 1 trial was 
conducted by the Istitu to Superiore di Sanità  (ISS) in Italy. One of these trials, 
HVTN 088, was conducted in the US in order to evaluate the safety and 
immunogenicity of a long -interval, cross -clade subtype C gp140/ MF59  boost in 
subjects previously administered subtype B gp120/ MF59  or subtype B 
gp140/ MF59  in previous trials. This includes subjects from the HVTN049 
DNA/PLG prime, gp140/ MF59  boost study already described. The study enrolled 
16 previously vaccinated subjects and 20 naive controls. Individuals were 
identified who ha d received a clade B Env protein with MF59  4-17 years earlier, 
most in combination with a DNA or ALVAC prime. These individuals were 
enrolled in HVTN 088 to receive a clade C protein boost in an open label phase 1 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 59 of 184 trial. There have been 3 SAEs reported in this trial, 1 involving traumatic injury, 1 
instance of gastroenteritis, and 1 of appendicitis. All of these were assessed as 
unrelated to study agents.  
The second HVTN study, HVTN 086, was conducted in the RSA. It evaluat ed the 
safety and immunogenicity of various combinations of SAAVI DNA -C2, SAAVI 
MVA -C, and Novartis subtype C gp140/ MF59 . All scheduled clinic visits have 
been completed, though study participants remain subject to annual contacts to 
assess their health status. This study enrolled 184 sub jects. To date, 6 SAEs have 
been reported in this study, 1 case of acute tonsillitis that required hospitalization, 
1 of schizophrenia requiring hospitalization (later determined to be a pre -existing 
condition), 1 of pelvic inflammatory disease, 1 soft -tissue injury, 1 instance of 
anemia, and  1 instance of alcohol -related cardiomyopathy. All were assessed as 
not related to the study products.  
The ISS study (ISS P -002) conducted in Italy examin ed the safety and 
immunogenicity of subtype C gp140 co -administer ed with ISS TAT compared to 
subtype C gp140 alone or TAT alone. The study includes intradermal and IM 
injections (100 mcg for subtype C gp140 and 7.5 mcg for ISS TAT). This study 
did not include MF59 . This study was stopped early due to slow enrollment and  
subsequent expiration for the study product stability program. No  SAEs were 
reported in this study.  
4.7.6.2  Summary of immunogenicity from recent human experience  
The immunogenicity of Novartis recombinant proteins has been demonstrated 
consistently in all clinic al trials and in all 3 of the recently completed studies 
using Novartis CHO -based subtype B gp140 MF59 . In the HVTN 049 DNA/PLG 
prime protein boost study, the primary cellular immunogenicity endpoints 
included interferon gamma (IFN -γ) enzyme -linked immunos pot (ELISpot) and 
ICS responses. Immunogenicity was assessed 14 days after each vaccination. 
Env-specific IFN -γ ELISpot response rates did not increase substantially 
compared to baseline after the 3 DNA/PLG prime vaccinations, but did rise after 
the first protein/ MF59  boost. nAb titers against the homologous SF162 isolate 
were detectable in 2 subjects after the third DNA/PLG priming vaccination and in 
13 subjects after the first protein boost. Neutralization was boosted to high titer s 
in all but 1 subject f ollowing the second protein boost. Similarly , in the group of 
subjects who received subtype B gp140/ MF59  without a DNA/PLG prime, a 
nearly complete response to the SF162 isolate was observed at the second 
vaccination (all but  1 subject) which lasted throug h the third vaccination. Binding 
Ab titers against Env, measured by enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA), were detected following the first subtype B gp140/ MF59  boost and 
were very high following the second boost administration.  
The C86P2 MUVAPRED IN study, demonstrated immunogenicity with 
considerable IgG and IgA Ab responses to subtype B gp140 in serum, cervical, 
and vaginal secretions of subjects following IN administration of subtype B 
gp140 with the adjuvant LTK63 and an IM b oost with subtype B gp140 and M59 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 60 of 184 adjuvant. nAb responses against the homologous SF162 were also detected in all 
groups following IM boost with subtype B gp140 and MF59  adjuvant.  
HVTN 073E  data are available from specimens collected  2 weeks after each 
protein administration. Boosting with protein  enhanced levels of binding and 
neutralizing antibodies as well as CD4 + T-cell responses to HIV -1 envelope . The 
protein boost increased CD4+ T -cell response rates from 74% to 87% of the 
subjects.  No neutralizing ant ibodies  were detected with the DNA/MVA regimen 
before the  protein boosts. After  the first protein boost, neutralizing antibodies  to 
tier 1 viruses were detected in up to 56% of participants. After the second  protein 
boost,  neutralizing antibody responses w ere seen in up to 100% of participants  
and persisted in 75% of those participants  for at least 6 months  [74]. 
In addition, in the subtype C gp140/ MF59  HVTN 088 long -interval boost study , 
16 previously primed vol unteers and 20 naïve volunteers each received 2 doses of 
the subtype C gp140/ MF59  given 6 months apart. HIV -1 specific CD4+ and 
CD8+ T -cell responses were measured by an ICS assay. Ab responses were 
measured with a Luminex binding Ab assay and a nAb assay in TZM -bl cells. 
Despite the long interval (4 -17 years from prior protein/ MF59  administration), 5 
of 16 ( 31%) of primed participants demonstrated CD4+ T -cell responses to Env at 
baseline, which increased to 12 of 16 ( 75%) after a single protein boost. IgG and 
IgA responses to Con S  gp140 were present in 64% (IgG) and 7% (IgA) of 
primed participants at baseline, and rose to 93% and 85%, respectively, after  1 
dose of protein. Primed participants demonstrated ( 71%) nAb against Tier 1 clade 
B isolate MN at base line. After a single booster dose of protein, 100% of the 
primed participants neutralized MN and 93% showed neutralizing activity against 
a clade C isolate, MW965.26. Unprimed participants did not demonstrate CD4+ 
responses or Ab responses to Env until aft er the second dose, which elicited IgG 
and IgA responses to vaccine -matched oligomeric TV1 Env in 88% and 50%, 
respectively. nAb developed to MN in 38% and to MW965.26 in 88% of the 
unprimed participants.   
Three of the 4 vaccine regimens in HVTN 086 contai ned Novartis subtype C 
gp140/MF59 , either as a boost following pox -vector (MVA) primes, administered 
concurrently with a pox -vector (MVA) vaccine, or in a concurrent pox -
vector/protein boost and second protein boost following DNA plasmid primes. Ab 
respons es were measured with a Luminex binding Ab assay and a nAb assay in 
TZM -bl cells. All three vaccine regimens containing subtype C gp140/MF59  
elicited high rates (82 –100%) and magnitudes of IgG binding Ab against a range 
of gp120 and gp140 antigens. All vac cine regimens had evidence of nAb to (Tier 
1) HIV strains MN.3, MW965.26, and SF162.LS, with the MVA - and DNA -
primed regimens showing the highest titers to MW965.26, a clade C strain. HIV-1 
specific CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell responses to global potential T -cell epitopes 
(PTEg) were measured by an ICS assay.  The MVA - and DNA -primed vaccine 
regimens elicited the highest rates of CD4+ T cells producing IFN -γ and/or IL -2 
(77% and 45%, respectively), while the regimen with concurrent MVA/pro tein 
administration elicited the lowest rate (13%).  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 61 of 184 4.7.7  Clinical studies with HIV -1 subunit protein vaccines and AS01 B 
Immunogenicity data for studies HVTN 041, PRO HIV -005, ECR -004 and PRO 
HIV-002 are presented in Section  4.3.1  and 4.3.2 .  
The safety, reactogenicity and tolerability profiles of the  vaccine regimens 
investigated in these studies were considered acceptable and are presented below.  
HVTN 041  evaluated a combination vaccine (NefTat and gp120 W6.1D) 
formulated with AS02 A (oil-in-water emulsion of a combination of MPL and QS -
21) administere d at 0, 1 and 3 months with varying doses (5, 20 and 100 mcg) of 
the gp120 vaccine component (the NefTat antigen dose was constant at 20mcg).  
The vaccinations were well tolerated and none were discontinued because of 
vaccine -associated reactogenicity. The  most common local symptoms were pain 
and tenderness. Systemic symptoms were generally mild with the exception of 
moderate myalgia and headache occurring in 20 and 25%, respectively. Both 
symptoms were evenly distributed in the 3 NefTat and gp120 W6.1D groups (20% 
in each group for myalgia and from 10 [2/20 subjects] to 40% [8/20 subjects] per 
group for headache). Severe pain was observed in 2/20 subjects of 2 NefTat and 
gp120 W6.1D groups  (5 mcg and 100 mcg of gp120). Severe tenderness was 
observed in 2/20 s ubjects of 1 NefTat and gp120 W6.1D group (5 mcg of gp120). 
Severe malaise was observed in 2/20 subjects of 1 NefTat and gp120 W6.1D 
group (20 mcg of gp120).  All vaccine -related reactogenicities were transient and 
had either improved or resolved within 48 h ours of onset. Grade 4 laboratory 
abnormalities were observed in 1 single participant who was administered the 
AS02A -adjuvanted NefTat 20 mcg / gp120W6 .1D 5 mcg vaccine. This 
participant had an elevated CPK value, which  may have been due to creatine 
supple ments taken prior to exercise and likely not vaccine related. There were 6 
serious adverse events during the trial that occurred within 24 hours 
postvaccination and were felt to be probably or definitely due to the 
immunizations. These included 2 severe lo cal site reactions in group NefTat 20 
mcg and gp120 W6.1D 5 mcg  (associated to limitation of limb movement in 1 
case), 2 occurrences of severe malaise in 2 subjects of group NefTat 20 mcg / 
gp120W6 .1D 20 mcg, a febrile illness (103.2 ◦F) in 1 subject of gro up NefTat 20 
mcg / gp120W6 .1D 20 mcg, and an episode of generalized urticaria in 1 subject 
from group NefTat 20 mcg / gp120W6 .1D 100 mcg. All of these SAEs  
significantly improved within 24 h ours of onset. It is important to note that none 
of these SAEs wou ld be regarded as serious  in accordance with the current ICH 
E2A definitions. Grade 3 and Grade 4 related Adverse Events were considered 
SAEs per the “SAE reporting manual” active at the time of the study . 
PRO HIV -002 evaluated the gp120 W6.1D 20 mcg / NefT at 20 mcg candidate 
HIV vaccine formulated with 1 of 3 different Adjuvant Systems (AS02 A, AS02 V 
and AS01 B), each in 60 healthy HIV -seronegative adults. The vaccine candidates 
were administered at month  0, month  1, month  3 and month  6.  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 62 of 184 During the 7 -day follow -up period after vaccination, almost all doses (90.4% to 
98.8%) were followed by at least 1 solicited or unsolicited symptom considered to 
be related to vaccination with no difference between groups. The reactogenicity 
profiles obtain ed in the present study were expected and confirmed the previous 
results obtained with these adjuvants. During the course of the study, a total of 14 
SAEs were reported in 12 subjects, none of them was causally related to 
vaccination.  
Local and general so licited symptoms could be divided into 4 groups given their 
frequency per dose given into brackets (by decreasing order):  
• Pain (between 86.3% and 96.3%) with few grade 3 symptoms (≤ 3.4%).  
• Fatigue (between 33.8% and 46.6%), feverishness (between 22.9% and 
53.4%), headache (between 35.0% and 48.3%) and myalgia (between 25.8% 
and 43.3%). Few cases of grade 3 myalgia and fatigue were reported (≤ 
4.2%). For feverishness,  the frequency of grade 3 symptoms was 10.1% and 
for headache  was 5.9% in the gp120/ NefTat/  AS01 B group.  
• Redness, swelling, nausea and fever: the frequency of those symptoms did not 
exceed 30.3%. Few grade 3 nausea and fever were reported (≤ 2.1%). The 
frequency of grade 3 redness and swelling was 20.2% and 13.9% respectively 
in the gp120/ NefTa t/ AS01 B group.  
• Diarrh ea and vomiting: the frequency of these symptoms was less than or 
equal to 7.5%. No grade 3 diarrhea was observed, and only 0.4% of the doses 
were followed by grade 3 vomiting.  
Almost all general symptoms (fatigue, feverishness, head ache, myalgia, nausea 
and fever, vomiting) were considered as related to the vaccination, except for 
diarrhea.  
The duration of general symptoms was less than or equal to 2 days in most cases 
whereas the duration of local symptoms was often more than 2 day s. In the 
gp120/ NefTat/AS01 B group the overall frequency of the general symptoms 
tended to be higher after the second , third , or fourth  dose of vaccine compared to 
the first dose (but not for all symptoms and all groups).  
The incidence of unsolicited AEs ranged from 78.3% to 83.3%. The most 
frequently reported symptoms were upper respiratory tract infections and 
headache, followed by injection site induration, injection site pruritus and 
pharyngeal pain. Less than half unsolicited symptoms were causally re lated to 
vaccination (incidence between 31.7% and 36.7%). The most frequent symptoms 
causally related to vaccination were administration site reactions (injection site 
induration, pruritus or warmth) and asthenia. Few grade 3 or grade 3 related 
symptoms oc curred: 18 subjects (incidence between 6.7% and 13.3%. according 
to group) experienced grade 3 unsolicited symptoms, among which a majority 
were  non-related infectious conditions (cystitis, gastroenteritis, otitis, 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 63 of 184 pyelonephritis, tonsillitis, tooth absces s, upper respiratory tract infection and 
vaginal candidiasis). Six of them had symptoms considered to be causally related 
to vaccination (lymphadenopathy, palpitations, application site hyperesthesia, 
asthenia, muscle rigidity, headache, and tremor).  
No significant changes in laboratory parameters (hematology, biochemistry, 
urinalysis) and vital signs were observed throughout the study. This study had no 
negative social impact (only 2.8% of the subjects reported any disturbance) and 
19.4% of the subjects n otified even a beneficial impact.  
PRO HIV -005 evaluated an HIV vaccine candidate consisting of a recombinant 
fusion protein (F4) containing 4 HIV -1 clade B antigens (Gag p24, Pol -RT, Nef, 
and Gag p17) adjuvanted with AS01 B in 3 different doses: 10, 30, an d 90 mcg. 
Each dose of the AS01 B-adjuvanted vaccine candidate was administered twice in 
a group of 50 subjects, following a month  0 and month  1 schedule. Three control 
groups of 10 subjects received a dose of 10, 30 or 90 mcg  F4 in water for 
injection (WFI ).  
Reactogenicity was higher during the 7 -day period after each vaccine dose in the 
F4/AS01 groups than in the F4 in WFI groups. The incidence of local and general 
symptoms tended to be higher in the F4/AS01 groups after the second vaccine 
dose. Pain was the most common solicited local symptom, reported after 96.0% –
98.0% of doses in the F4/AS01 groups and after 10.0% –30.0% of doses in the F4 
in WFI groups (grade 3 severity after 5.0% -10.1% of doses in the F4/AS01 
groups). Fatigue was the most common solici ted general symptom, reported after 
66.0% -77.8% and 30.0% -45.0% of doses in the F4/AS01 and F4 in WFI groups, 
respectively (grade 3 severity after 7.0% -12.1% of doses in the F4/AS01 groups). 
Fever of more than 39°C was reported in 3.0%, 2.0% and 1.0% of th e doses in the 
respective 10, 30 and 100 mcg F4/AS01 groups). No solicited local or general 
grade 3 symptoms were reported in the F4 in WFI groups. No differences in 
reactogenicity were observed between the antigen dose levels in the F4/AS01 
groups. During  the 30 -day postvaccination period, 60.0% –84.0% of subjects in 
the F4/AS01 groups reported unsolicited symptoms, compared with 50.0% –
70.0% in the F4 in WFI groups. In the F4/AS01 groups, unsolicited symptoms 
(mainly chills and injection site reactions) wer e considered causally related to 
vaccination in 30.0% –44.0% of subjects and were of grade 3 severity in <10.0%. 
All related symptoms were transient and resolved without sequelae, generally 
within 2 –3 days. Six serious adverse events were reported in the F4 /AS01 groups,  
all considered unrelated to vaccination . No subjects died during the study period, 
and no subject withdrew because of adverse events.  
ECR 004 , a subset of volunteers primed 3 years before with 2 doses F4 10 mcg / 
AS01 B (PRO HIV -005) received a (third) single booster dose of F4 10 mcg / 
AS01 B.  
93.3% ( ie, 14 out of 15 subjects) of the subjects reported at least 1 AE and 40% 
(ie, 6 out of 15 subjects) of the subjects in the group F4 reported at least 1 grade 3 
symptom con sidered by the investigator to be related to vaccination.  Pain was the 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 64 of 184 most frequent solicited local AE. Grade 3 pain (13.3% or in 2 out of 15 subjects), 
redness (in 6.7% or in 1 out of 15 subjects) or swelling (in 13.3% or in 2 out of 13 
subjects) were re ported for a maximum duration of 2 days. Fatigue and headache 
were the 2 most frequently reported solicited general AEs. Fever was recorded in 
6 out of 15 subjects (40%) within the 2 days after vaccination. Grade 3 fatigue (in 
20% or in 3 out of 15 subject s) or fever (in 1 out of 15 subjects) was reported with 
a maximum duration of 1 day. Grade 3 unsolicited AEs were reported by 13.3 % 
(ie, 2 out of 15 subjects). Out of these cases, 2 cases were considered by the 
investigator to be causally related to vaccin ation: 1 case of chills and 1 case of 
insomnia. All of the grade 3 unsolicited AEs were resolved without sequelae. No 
subjects died, experienced an SAE, or withdrew due to an AE.

HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 67 of 184 6 Statistical considerations  
6.1 Accrual and sample size calculations  
Recruitment will target enrolling 160 healthy, HIV -uninfected adult participants  
ages 18 -40 years in Africa  and the United States . Participants will be randomized 
to 4 treatment groups (3 vaccine groups of size 50 each and a placebo group of 
size 10). The three vaccine groups (groups 1 -3) will evaluate AL VAC priming 
followed by boosting with ALVAC and gp120 protein. Three different 
formulations of the protein will  be evaluated: 1) a dose of 100 mcg of each 
protein formulated with MF59 ; 2) a dose of 100 mcg of each protein formulated 
with AS01 B; and 3) a do se of 20 mcg of each protein formulated with AS01 B. To 
ensure that both participants assigned male and female at birth  will be adequately 
represented in the trial, the trial will enroll at least approximately 40% of each 
sex. Hence, when approximately 96 participants of one sex are enrolled, 
recruitment of persons born of that sex will stop.  
Since enrollment is concurrent with receiving the first study vaccination, all 
participants will provide some safety data. However, for immunogenicity 
analyses, it is p ossible that data may be missing for various reasons, such as 
participants terminating from the study early, problems in shipping specimens, 
low cell viability of processed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) , or 
high assay background. Immunogenicit y data from 17 phase 1 and 2 phase 2a 
HVTN vaccine trials, which began enrolling after June 2005 (data as of 
September 2014 ), indicate that 15% is a reasonable estimate for the rate of 
missing data at month 6.5.  For this reason, the sample size calculations in Section 
6.1.2  account for 8 enrolled participants on each of the vaccine groups  having 
missing data for the primary  immunogenicity endpoint s.  
6.1.1  Sample size calculations for safety  
The goal of the safety evaluation for this study is to identify safety concerns 
associated with product administration. The ability of the study to detect SAEs  
can be expressed by the true eve nt rate above which at least 1 SAE would likely 
be observed and the true event rate below which no events would likely be 
observed. Specifically, for each vaccine group  of the study (n = 50), there is a 90% 
chance of observing at least 1 event if the true r ate of such an event is 4.5% or 
more; and there is a 90% chance of observing no events if the true rate is 0.1%  or 
less. As a reference, in HVTN vaccine trials from December 2000 through April 
2014, about 4% of participants  who received placebos experience d an SAE.   
Probabilities of observing 0, 1 or more, and 2 or  more events among groups of 
size 50 are presented in Table 6-1 for a range of possible true adverse event rates. 
These calculations provide a more complete picture of the sensitivity of this study 
design to identify potential safety problems with a vaccine  regimen . 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 68 of 184 Table 6-1 Probability of observing no events, 1 or more events, and 2 or m ore events, 
among groups of size 50, for different true event rates  
True  event  rate (%) Pr(0/100 ) Pr(1+/100 ) Pr(2+/100 ) 
1 0.61 0.39 0.09 
4 0.13 0.87 0.60 
10 0.005  >0.99 0.97 
20 <0.001  >0.99 >0.99 
30 <0.001  >0.99 >0.99 
An alternative way of describing the statistical properties of the study design is in 
terms of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the true rate of an adverse event 
based on the observed data. Table 6-2 shows the 2 -sided 95% CIs for the 
probability of an event based on a particular observed rate. Calculations are done 
using the score test method [75]. If none of the 50 participants receiving a vaccine 
regimen experience a safety event, the 95% 2 -sided upper confidence bound for 
the true rate for such an event is 7.1%. 
Table 6-2 Two-sided 95% confidence intervals based on observing a particular rate of safety 
endpoints for vaccine group s of size 50 
Observed  event  rate Confidence  interval  (%) 
0/50 = 0.0%  (0.0, 7.1) 
1/50 = 2.0% (0.4, 10.5) 
2/50 = 4.0% (1.1, 13.5) 
  5/50 = 10.0% (4.3, 21.4) 
10/50 = 20.0%  (11.2, 33.0) 
20/50 = 40.0%  (27.6, 53.8) 
6.1.2  Sample size calculations for immunogenicity  
The primary immunogenicity evaluation is to compare Groups 2 and 3 ( AS01 B 
groups ) separately to Group 1 (MF59 group ) based on the following two criteria:  
1. Establish superiority of the AS01 B regimen in CD4+ T -cell response rate at 
month 6.5 for either TV1 or 1086; AND  
2. Establish superiority of the AS01  B regimen in magnitude of anti -gp120 
antibody response at month 12 for 1086.  
Power is calculated fo r each group comparison separately and assumes that:  
1. The CD4+ T -cell response rate for the AS01  B regimen is at least 31% higher 
for both antigens; AND,  
2. The true geometric mean anti -gp120 binding antibody response is 1.5 -fold 
higher for the AS01  B regimen . 
Power is based on data simulations using HVTN 100 CD4+ T -cell data from the 
month  6.5 visit (2 weeks after the fourth  vaccination)  and predicted anti -gp120 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 69 of 184 1086 antibody binding ma gnitude at the month 12 visit. Simulated HVTN 120 
data sets were generated  by sampling with replacement from the HVTN 100 data 
and power is reported as the percentage of the 10,000 simulated HVTN 120 trials 
that reject the composite null hypothesis defined by the primary immunogenicity 
evaluation (“Overall power”) and separately  for the null hypotheses defined by 
the CD4+ T -cell and the anti -gp120 antibody criteria . CD4+ T -cell response calls 
were simulated for the MF59 group (Group 1) by dichotomizing the ICS 
IL2/IFN γ CD4+ T -cell response magnitude using a threshold defined by t he 
observed response rates of 49% to the TV1 antigen and 40% to the 1086 antigen.  
For the AS01  B comparator group (Group 2 or 3), CD4+ T -cell response calls 
were simulated based on threshold corresponding to response rates of 80% for 
TV1 and 71% for 1086 a ntigens.  The rationale for this approach is to maintain the 
between antigen correlation and allow simulation of a higher response rate in the 
AS01  B group.  Predicted HVTN 100 Env -gp120 binding data at month  12 were 
used for the second primary immunogenicit y criterion.  Env-gp120 binding 
magnitudes in the MF59 group  (Group 1) at month  12 were predicted using 
HVTN 100 month 6.5 data and assuming the same antibody decline between 6.5 
and 12 months that was obtained from model ing the decline of the  antibody 
response to the A244 gp120 antigen in RV144  [76]. AS01 B (Group 2 or 3) IgG 
response magnitudes were simulated on a logit scale using a fold -change 
equivalent to a 1.5 -fold change between group geometric means on the MFI scale.  
Specifically, the logit transformation of MFI is define d by logit(MFI) = log((M -
L)/L) – log(MFI/(M -MFI))  where M=215 and L=100, the upper and lower limits 
of detection of the binding antibody  multiplex assay (BAMA).  The rational e for 
using the logit scale is to simulate MFI values within the range of the assay.  
Overall power, accounting for both primary immunog enicity criteria defined 
above, depends on inter-correlation s between the CD4+ T -cell and anti -gp120 
readouts.  The correlation coefficient between month  6.5 TV1 and 1086 CD4+ T -
cell magnitudes in HVTN 100 is high (0.86, Spearman rank correlation).  
Correlat ion coefficients between month 6.5 CD4+ T -cell magnitude (TV1 or 
1086) and month 12 anti -gp120 1086 antibody magnitude are low (0.35 and 0.33, 
Spearman rank correlation).  Although t hese correlations are difficult to interpret  
since they are based on predic ted month 12 antibody responses , they are 
consistent with correlations between week 26 cellular and week 52 antibody 
responses from HVTN 096 and HVTN 205 [76]. Therefore, t he results for overall 
power shown in  Table 6-3, are based on the correlation between month  6.5 CD4+ 
T-cell magnitude and predicted anti -gp120 1086  antibody magnitude . An 
alternative is to assume independence between the month 6.5 CD4+ T -cell 
responses and the month 12 anti -gp120 responses.  Under this scenario the overall 
power is virtually the same (results not shown).  
Power calculations are based on 1 -sided Fisher’s exact test s for the TV1 and 1086 
CD4+ T -cell response rate comparisons an d a 1 -sided t -test comparing log(MFI) 
for the anti -gp120 responses comparison.  Comparisons are based on an alpha 
level of 0.025.

6.2 Randomization  
A participant’s randomization assignment will be computer generated and 
provided to the HVTN CRS pharmacist through a Web -based randomization 
system. At each institution, the pharmacist with primary responsibility for 
dispensing study products is charged with maintaining security of the treatment 
assignments  (except in emergency situations as specified in the HVTN MOP).  
6.3 Blinding  
Participants and site staff (except for site pharmacists) will be blinded as to 
participant s’ treatment group  assignments . Study product assignments are 
accessible to those HVTN CRS pharmacists, DAIDS protocol pharmacists and 
contract monitors, an d SDMC staff who are required to know this information in 
order to ensure proper trial conduct. Any discussion of study product assignment 
between pharmacy staff and any other HVTN CRS staff is prohibited. The HVTN 
SMB members also are unblinded to treatme nt assignment in order to conduct 
review of trial safety.  
When a participant leaves the trial prior to study completion, the participant will 
be told he or she must wait until all participants are unblinded to learn his or her 
treatment assignment.  
In some cases, the CRS, PSRT, or study s ponsor may believe unblinding of the 
site PI and participant would be appropriate to facilitate the clinical management 
of an AE or SAE. The HVTN Unblinding MOP specifies procedures for 
emergency unblinding, and for early  unblinding for medical reasons.  
6.4 Statistical analysis  
This section describes the final study analysis, unblinded as to treatment group  
assignment. All data from enrolled participants will be analyzed according to the 
initial randomization assignment regardless of how many vaccinations they 
received. In the rare instance that a participant receives the wrong treatment at a 
specific vaccin ation time, the Statistical Analysis Plan will address how to 
analyze the participant’s safety data. A nalys es are modified intent -to-treat in that 
individuals who are randomized but not enrolled do not contribute data and hence 
are excluded. Because of bli nding and the brief length of time between 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 71 of 184 randomization and enrollment —typically no more than 4 working days —very 
few such individuals are expected.  
Analyses for primary endpoints will be performed using SAS and R. All other 
descriptive and inferential st atistical analyses will be performed using SAS, 
StatXact, or R statistical software.  
No formal multiple comparison adjustments will be employed for multiple safety 
endpoints, multiple primary immunogenicity endpoints, or secondary endpoints. 
However, multi plicity adjustments will be made for certain immunogenicity 
assays, as specified in the SAP , when the assay endpoint is viewed as a collection 
of hypotheses (eg, testing multiple peptide pools to determine a positive 
response).  
Immunogenicity data from thi s study may be combined with other phase 1/2a 
studies within the P5 partnership HIV vaccine program . Comparable eligibility 
criteria and validated assays for primary immunogenicity endpoints will be used 
to mitigate the potential bias introduced by combini ng data across studies 
conducted over an extended period of time.  
6.4.1  Analysis variables  
The analysis variables consist of baseline participant characteristics, safety, and 
immunogenicity for primary - and secondary -objective analyses.  
6.4.2  Baseline comparability  
Treatment groups  will be compared for baseline participant characteristics using 
descriptive statistics.  
6.4.3  Safety/tolerability analysis  
Since enrollment is concurrent with receiving the first vaccination, all participants 
will have received at least 1 vaccina tion and therefore will provide some safety 
data.  
6.4.3.1  Reactogenicity  
The number and percentage of participants experiencing each type of 
reactogenicity sign or symptom will be tabulated by severity and treatment group  
and the percentages displayed graphically by group . For a given sign or symptom, 
each participant’s reactogenicity will be counted once under the maximum 
severity for all injection visits. In addition to the individual types of events, the 
maximum severity of local pain or tenderness, induration o r erythema, and of 
systemic symptoms will be calculated. Kruskal -Wallis tests will be used to test for 
differences in severity between group s. 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 72 of 184 6.4.3.2  AEs and SAEs  
AEs will be summarized using MedDRA System Organ Class and preferred 
terms. Tables will show by trea tment group  the number and percentage of 
participants experiencing an AE within a System Organ Class or within preferred 
term category by severity or by relationship to study product. For the calculations 
in these tables, a participant with multiple AEs wi thin a category will be counted 
once under the maximum severity or the strongest recorded causal relationship to 
study product. Formal statistical testing comparing group s is not planned since 
interpretation of differences must rely heavily upon clinical j udgment.  
A listing of SAEs reported to the DAIDS Regulatory Support Center (RSC) 
Safety Office will provide details of the events including severity, relationship to 
study product, time between onset and last vaccination, and number of 
vaccinations receive d. A separate listing will do the same for AEs of special 
interest (AESI). AESI for this protocol include but are not limited to potential 
immune -mediated disorders; a sample list of AESI is provided in  Appendix H . 
These listings will be submitted to the FDA in all annual reports and clinical trial 
reports.  
6.4.3.3  Local laboratory values  
Boxplots of local laboratory values will be generated for baseline values and for 
values measured during the course of the study by treatment group  and visit. Each 
boxplot will show the first quartile, the median, and the third quartile. Outliers 
(values o utside the boxplot) will also be plotted. If appropriate, horizontal lines 
representing boundaries for abnormal values will be plotted.  
For each local laboratory measure, summary statistics will be presented by 
treatment group  and timepoint , as well as cha nges from baseline for 
postenrollment values. In addition, the number (percentage) of participants with 
local laboratory values recorded as meeting Grade 1 AE criteria or above as 
specified in the DAIDS AE Grading Table (see Section  11.2.2 ) will be tabulated 
by treatment group  for each postvaccination timepoint . Reportable clinical 
laboratory abnormalities without an associated clinical diagnosis will also be 
includ ed in the tabulation of AEs described above.  
6.4.3.4  Reasons for vaccination discontinuation and early study termination  
The number and percentage of participants who discontinue vaccination and who 
terminate the study early will be tabulated by reason and treatme nt group . 
6.4.4  Immunogenicity analysis  
6.4.4.1  General approach  
For the statistical analysis of immunogenicity endpoints, data from enrolled 
participants will be used according to the initial randomization assignment 
regardless of how many injections they received. Add itional analyses may be 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 73 of 184 performed, limited to participants who received all scheduled injections per 
protocol. Assay results that are unreliable, from specimens collected outside of 
the visit window, or from HIV -infected participants after infection are ex cluded. 
Since the exact date of HIV infection is unknown, any assay data from blood 
draws 4 weeks prior to an infected participant’s last seronegative sample and 
thereafter may be excluded. If an HIV -infected participant does not have a 
seronegative sample  after enrollment, then all data from that participant may be 
excluded from the analysis.  
Response rates will be analyzed by tabulating the frequency of positive response 
for each endpoint and treatment group  at each timepoint  for which an assessment 
is performed. For CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell response, response rates to the 
individual peptide pools will also be calculated. Crude response rates will be 
presented with their corresponding 95% confidence interval estimate calcula ted 
using the score test method [75]. For the primary endpoints of CD4+ T -cell 
response rates for TV1 and 1086, differences between groups will be tested with a 
2-sided Barnard’s or Fisher’s exact test (as specified in the SAP) at an alpha level 
of 0.05. For secondary and exploratory assay endpoints, response rates and 95% 
confidence intervals will be calculated if appropriate for the endpoint. No 
adjustment will be made to the vaccin e group  estimates for the false positive rates 
in the placebo  group . 
The primary endpoint of anti -gp120 binding antibody response  magnitude, and 
likely some of the secondary assays, will have quantitative assay data . Other 
quantitative measures include binding antibody magnitude from the multiplex 
assay, neutralizing antibody titers, area under the magnitude -breadth curve [AUC -
MB] for the neutralizing antibody assay, and percentage of positive cells from the 
ICS assay. Quantitative data will be displayed as graphical and tabular summaries 
of the distributions by antigen, treatment group , and timepoint . For the primary 
and secondary immunogenicity endpoints, box plots and plots of estimated 
reverse cumulative distribution curves will be presented  by group.  For the primary 
endpoint, differences between groups will be tested with a nonparametric 
Wilcoxon rank sum test if the data are not normally distributed or with a 2 -sample 
t-test if the data appear to be normally distributed , at an alpha level of 0.05.  
Formal statistical comparisons between groups for secondary and exploratory 
immunogenicity endpoints are not objective s of the trial, although these are likely 
to be made to better understand the effect of each vaccine regimen . For 
comparisons in which the  response rate for 1 of the group s is low (eg, ≤ 20% for 
the class), statistical testing will use Barnard’s or Fisher’s exact test s (as specified 
in the SAP) comparing the 2 response rates as most of the continuous data 
readouts would be left censored at t he lower limit of detection.  For comparisons 
in which the response rates for both group s are high (eg, ≥ 75%), t he difference 
between group s will be tested using the continuous readouts with a nonparametric 
Wilcoxon rank sum test if the data are not normally distributed and with a 2 -
sample t -test if the data appear to be normally distributed.  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 74 of 184 Some immunologic assays have underlying continuous or count -type readout that 
are dichotomized into responder/nonresponder categories. If treatment group  
differe nces for these assays are best summarized by a mixture model, then either 
Lachenbruch’s test statistic [77] or an alternative two -part test [78] (as defined in 
the SAP)  will be used to evaluate the composite null hypothesis of equal response 
rates in the 2 group s and equal response distributions among responders in the 2 
such group s. For estimation, differences in response rates between group s will be 
estimated using the methods described above, and in the subgroup of positive 
responders, differences in location parameters between group s will be estimated 
using the methods described above.   
6.4.4.2  Missing data considerations  
Based upon previous HVTN trials, missing 15% of immunogenicity results for a 
specific assay is common due to study participants terminating from the study 
early, problems in shipping specimens, or low cell viability of processed PBMCs. 
To achieve unbiased statis tical estimation and inferences with  standard methods 
applied in a complete -case manner (only including participants with observed data 
in the analysis) , missing data need to be missing completely at random (MCAR). 
MCAR assumes that the probability of an o bservation being missing does not 
depend on any participant characteristics (observed or unobserved ). When 
missing data are minimal (specifically , if no more than 20% of participants are 
missing values), then standard complete -case methods will be used, be cause 
violations of the MCAR assumption will have little impact on the estimates.   
If a substantial amount of immunogenicity data are missing (at least 1 value 
missing from more than 20% of participants), then using the methods that require 
the MCAR assump tion may give misleading results. In this situation, analyses of 
the immunogenicity endpoints at a specific timepoint will be performed using 
parametric generalized linear models fit by maximum likelihood. These methods 
provide unbiased estimation and infe rences under the parametric modeling 
assumptions and the assumption that the missing data are missing at random 
(MAR). MAR assumes that the probability of an observation being missing may 
depend upon the observed responses and upon observed covariates, but  not upon 
any unobserved factors. Generalized linear models for response rates will use a 
binomial error distribution and for quantitative endpoints, a normal error 
distribution. For assessing repeated immunogenicity measurement, linear mixed 
effects model s will be used. If the immunological outcomes are left - and/or right - 
censored, then the linear mixed effects models of Hughes [79] will be used, 
because they accommodate the censoring. In addition, secondary analyses of 
repeated immunogenicity measurements may be done using weighted GEE [80] 
methods, which are valid under MAR. All of the models described above will 
include as covaria tes all available baseline predictors of the missing outcomes.  
6.4.5  Analyses and data sharing prior to end of scheduled follow -up visits  
Any analyses conducted prior to the end of the scheduled follow -up visits should 
not compromise the integrity of the trial in terms of participant retention or safety 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 75 of 184 or immunogenicity endpoint assessments. In particular, early unblinded analyses 
by treatment assignment require careful consideration and should be made 
available on a need to know basis in accordance with Sectio ns 6.4.5.1  and 6.4.5.2 . 
Interim blinded safety and immunogenicity data should not be shared outside of 
the SMB, HVTN 120  PSRT, the protocol team leadership, the HVTN Executive 
Manage ment Team, the study product developer, and the study sponsor and/or its 
designee(s) for their regulatory reporting unless approved by the protocol 
leadership and the HVTN leadership . 
6.4.5.1  Safety  
During the course of the trial, unblinded analyses of safety data  will be prepared 
approximately every 4 months during the study, as defined in Section  11.1.2 , for 
review by the HVTN SMB. Ad hoc safety reports may also be prepar ed for SMB 
review at the request of the HVTN 120  PSRT. Refer to the process described in 
the HVTN unblinding MOP  any requests for unblinded safety data prior to the 
end of the scheduled follow -up visits.  
6.4.5.2  Immunogenicity  analyses 
The unblinded analysis of the primary endpoint of CD4+ T -cell response  rates  
measured at month  6.5 will be conducted when all participants have completed 
the visit and all samples have been analyzed . Unblinded results will not be made 
publicly availab le until participants have completed their month  12 visit. 
Unbli nded data analys es of secondary and exploratory endpoints (ie, additional 
immunogenicity assays) measured at month  6.5 will occur after the unblinded 
CD4+ T -cell immunogenicity analysis since selection of secondary assays is 
dependent upon the primary analysis. Analysis of secondary and exploratory 
objectives for month  6.5 will take place after the primary analysis  and may be 
performed when assay data are available  for analysis from at least 80% of 
participants .  
Analysis of anti -gp120 binding antibody response magnitudes measured at month  
12 will be conducted when all participants have completed the visit and all 
samples have been analyzed. Unblinded analysis of se condary and exploratory 
endpoints from the month  12 timepoint will take place after the primary analysis 
of anti -gp120 binding antibody and may be performed when assay data are 
available for analysis from at least 80% of participants.  
The Laboratory Progr am will review analysis report s prior to distribution to the 
protocol chairs, DAIDS, vaccine developer, and other key HVTN members and 
investigators. Distribution of reports will be limited to those with a need to know 
for the purpose of informing decision s related to future trials . The HVTN 
leadership must approve any other requests for HVTN immunogenicity analyses 
prior to the end of the scheduled follow -up visits .

Participants will be healthy, HIV -uninfected (sero negative) adults who 
comprehend the purpose of the study and have provided written informed consent. 
Volunteers will be recruited and screened; those determined to be eligible, based 
on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be enrolled in the study. F inal 
eligibility determination will depend on information available at the time of 
enrollment, including results of screening  laboratory tests, medical history, 
physical examinations, and answers to self -administered and/or interview 
questions.  
Investigat ors should always use good clinical judgment in considering a 
volunteer’s overall fitness for trial participation. Some volunteers may not be 
appropriate for enrollment even if they meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Medical, psychiatric, occupational,  or other conditions may make evaluation of 
safety and/or immunogenicity difficult, and some volunteers may be poor 
candidates for retention.

7.3 Participant departure from vaccination sc hedule or withdrawal  
This section concerns an individual participant’s departure from the vaccination 
schedule. Pause rules for the trial as a whole are described in Section  11.3. 
7.3.1  Delaying vaccinations for a participant  
Under certain circumstances, a participant’s scheduled vaccination will be 
delayed. The factors to be considered in such a decision include but are not 
limited to the following:  
• Within 45 days prior t o any study injection  
▪ Receipt of blood products or immunoglobulin  
• Within 30 days prior to any study injection  
▪ Receipt of live attenuated vaccines  
▪ Receipt of allergy treatment with antigen injections  
• Within 14 days prior to any study injection  
▪ Receipt of any vaccines that are not live attenuated vaccines (eg, 
pneumococcal)  
• Pre-vaccination abnormal vital signs or clinical symptoms that may mask 
assessment of vaccine reaction.  
• Pregnancy: for participants who become pregnant, no study vaccinations will 
be gi ven; except for participants who may have been pregnant during the 
study but are no longer pregnant as shown by 2 negative urine pregnancy tests 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 84 of 184 taken from 2 different urine samples that may be collected on the same day; in 
this circumstance, the HVTN 120  PSRT should be consulted to determine if 
the participant may resume vaccinations.  
Vaccinations should not be administered outside the visit window period specified 
in the HVTN 120  Study Specific Procedures.  
In order to avoid vaccination delays and missed vaccinations, participants who 
plan to receive licensed vaccines or allergy treatments should be counseled to 
schedule receipt of these substances, when possible, outside the interva ls 
indicated above. The effects of these substances on safety and immunogenicity 
assessments and their interactions with study vaccines are unknown. Therefore, if 
circumstances allow, these substances should also be avoided in the interval 
between a study vaccination and completion of the 2 week postvaccination 
follow -up visit.  
7.3.2  Participant departure from vaccination schedule  
Every effort should be made to follow the vaccination schedule per the protocol. 
If a participant misses a vaccination and the visit w indow period for the 
vaccination has passed, that vaccination cannot be given. The participant should 
be asked to continue study visits. The participant should resume the vaccination 
schedule with the next vaccination unless there are circumstances that re quire 
further delay or permanent discontinuation of vaccination (see Sections 7.3.1  and 
7.3.3 ).  
7.3.3  Discontinuing vaccination for a participant  
Under certain circumstances, an individual participant’s vaccinations will be  
temporarily or  permanently discontinued. Specific events that will result in  
stopping a participant’s vaccination schedule include:  
• Co-enrollment in a study with an investigational research agent (rare 
exceptions allowing for the continuation of vaccinations may be granted with 
the unanimous consent of the HVTN 120  PSRT).  
• Clinically significant condition (ie, a condition that affects the immune system 
or for which continued vaccinations and/or blood draws may pose additional 
risk), including but not limited to the following:  
▪ Pregnancy (v accinations will be stopped while a participant is pregnant. If 
the participant is no longer pregnant and can be vaccinated within an 
appropriate visit window, vaccinations may resume, see Section 7.3.1 ); 
▪ HIV infection;  
▪ Any grade 4 local or systemic reactogenicity symptom, lab abnormality, or 
AE that is subsequently considered to be related to vaccination;  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 85 of 184 ▪ Any grade 3 lab abnormality that is subsequently considered to be related 
to vaccination  
▪ Other  grade 3 clinical AE (exception: fever or vomiting and subjective 
local and systemic symptoms) that is subsequently consider ed to be related 
to vaccination.  For grade 3 injection site erythema and/or induration,  upon 
review, the PSRT may allow continuation of vaccination  
▪ SAE that is subsequently considered to be related to vaccination   
▪ Clinically significant type 1 hypersensitivity reaction associated with 
study vaccination. Consultation with the HVTN 120  PSRT is required 
prior to subsequent vaccinations following any type 1 hypersensitivity 
reaction associated with study vaccination;  
• Investigator determination in consultation with Protocol Team leadership (eg, 
for repeated nonadherence to study staff instructions).  
A study participant who misses a study vaccination  is permitted to continue with 
subsequent vaccinations  that can still be scheduled within the time interval s 
specified for those procedures in the HVTN 120  Study Specifi c Procedures  (SSP) , 
unless there is a protocol -mandated reason for discontinuation.  
Participants discontinuing study product for reasons other than HIV infection 
should be counseled on the importance of continuing wit h the study and strongly

HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 95 of 184 8.4 Administration  
All injections are to be given IM in the deltoid indicated. Any administrator of 
study product  will be blinded to the individual participant’s treatment assignment.  
When preparing a dose in a syringe and administering the dose, consideration 
should be given to the volume of solution in the needle before and after the dose 
is administered. Particularly, if the needle used to withdraw the product is 
replaced prior to va ccine administration, consideration should be given to 
conserving the full dose of product. The pharmacy and clinic staff members are 
encouraged to work together to administer the dose specified in the protocol.  
All injections are to be given using standa rd IM injection technique.  
For all syringes containing Bivalent  Subtype C  gp120  / MF59 or placebo  or 
Bivalent Subtype C gp120  / AS01 B or placebo , the person administering the 
injection should gently roll the syringe prior to administration of the study 
product.  
If an injection(s) needs to be administered in an alternate body site  (eg, thigh) due 
to a medical contraindication, the injection(s) should not be administered in the 
same deltoid as the other injection(s). The appropriate study staff should 
documen t this clearly. Under this circumstance, this is NOT a protocol violation.  
8.5 Acquisition of study products  
The ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438) and diluent (0.4% NaCl) will be supplied  by Sanofi 
Pasteur  and will be available through the NIAID Clinical Research Products 
Management Center (CRPMC) .  
Bivalent Subtype C gp120 , MF59®, and AS01 B will be supplied  by GSK 
Vaccines  and will be available through the NIAID CRPMC .  
Placebo for ALVAC -HIV ( Sodium Chloride for Injection, 0 .9%), Placebo for 
Bivalent Subtype C gp120/MF59 ( Sodium Chloride for Injection, 0 .9%), and 
Placebo for Bivalent Subtype C gp120/ AS01 B (Sodium Chloride for Injection, 
0.9%) will not be provided through the protocol and must be obtained by the site .  
Once an HVTN CRS is protocol registered, the pharmacist can obtain study 
products from the CRPMC by following the ordering procedures outlined  in the 
Pharmacy Guidelines and Instructions for DAIDS Clinical Trials Networks.  
8.6 Pharmacy records  
The HVTN CRS pharmacist is required to maintain complete records of all study 
products. The pharmacist of record is responsible for maintaining randomization 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 20 18 
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 96 of 184 codes and randomization confirmation notices for each participant in a secure 
manner.  
8.7 Final disposition of study products  
For US clinical research sites,  all unused study  products must be returned to the 
CRPMC after the study is completed or terminated unless otherwise instructed by 
the study s ponsor . For non -US clinical research sites, all unused study products 
must be destroyed after the study is completed or terminated unless otherwise 
instructed by the study s ponsor.  The procedures are included in the Pharmacy 
Guidelines and Instructions for DAIDS Clinical Trials Networks.

HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 97 of 184 9 Clinical procedures  
The schedule of clinical procedures is shown in  Appendix G . 
9.1 Informed consent  
Informed consent is the process of working  with participants so that they fully 
understand what will and may happen to them while participating in a research 
study. The HVTN informed consent form documents that a participant (1) has 
been informed about the potential risks, benefits, and alternatives to participation, 
and (2) is willing to participate in an HVTN study. Informed consent 
encompasses all written or  verbal study information HVTN CRS staff provide to 
the participant, before and during the trial. HVTN CRS staff will obtain informed 
consent of participants according to HVTN policies and procedures.  
The informed consent process continues throughout the s tudy. Key study concepts 
should be reviewed periodically with the participant and the review should be 
documented. At each study visit, HVTN CRS staff should consider reviewing the 
procedures and requirements for that visit and for the remaining visits. 
Additionally, if any new information is learned that might affect the participants’ 
decisions to stay in the trial, this information will be shared with trial participants. 
If necessary, participants will be asked to sign revised informed consent forms.  
An H VTN CRS may employ recruitment efforts prior to the participant 
consenting. For example, some HVTN CRSs use a telephone script to prescreen 
people before they come to the clinic for a full screening visit. Participants must 
sign a screening or protocol -specific consent before any procedures are performed 
to determine eligibility. HVTN CRSs must submit recruitment and prescreening 
materials to IRB/EC and any applicable Regulatory Entity (RE) for human 
subjects protection review and approval.  
Note: As defined  in the DAIDS Protocol Registration Manual, an RE is “Any 
group other than the local IRB/EC responsible for reviewing and/or approving a 
clinical research protocol and site -specific informed consent forms (ICFs) prior to 
implementation at a site.” CRSs are  responsible for knowing the requirements of 
their applicable REs.  
9.1.1  Screening consent form  
Without a general screening consent, screening for a specific study cannot take 
place until the site receives protocol registration from the DAIDS RSC Protocol 
Regist ration Office.  
Some HVTN CRSs have approval from their IRB/EC and any applicable RE to 
use a general screening consent form that allows screening for an unspecified HIV 
vaccine trial. In this way, HVTN CRS staff can continually screen potential 
participant s and, when needed, proceed quickly to obtain protocol -specific 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 98 of 184 enrollment consent. Sites conducting general screening or prescreening approved 
by their IRB/EC and any applicable RE may use the results from this screening to 
determine eligibility for this protocol, provided the tests are conducted within the 
time periods specified in the eligibility criteria.  
9.1.2  Protocol -specific consent forms  
The protocol -specific consent forms describe the study products to be used and all 
aspects of protocol participation,  including screening and enrollment procedures. 
A sample protocol -specific consent form for the main study is located in 
Appendix A .  
A separate sample consent form for other uses of specimens is located in  
Appendix E . 
Each HVTN CRS is responsible for developing a protocol -specific consent 
form(s) for local use, based on the sample protocol -specific consent forms in 
Appendix A  and Appendix E . The consent form(s) must be developed in 
accordance with requirements of the following:  
• CRS’s IRB/EC  and any applicable REs , 
• CRS’s institution, and  
• Elements of informed consent as described in Title 45 CFR Part 46 and Title 
21 CFR, Part 50, and in ICH E6, Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated 
Guidance 4.8.  
Study sites are strongly encouraged to have their local CABs review their site -
specific consent forms. This review should include, but should not be limited to, 
issues of c ultural competence, local language considerations, and the level of 
understandability.  
The sample informed consent form s include instructions throughout the document 
for developing specific content.  
Sites should follow the instructions in the Protocol -specific Official Memo 
distributed along with this protocol regarding when they may begin using their 
site-specific protocol consent forms.  
Regarding protocol registration, sites should follow procedures outlined in the 
current version of the DAIDS Protocol Re gistration Manual.  
9.1.3  Assessment of Understanding  
Study staff are responsible for ensuring that participants fully understand the 
study before enrolling them. This process involves reviewing the informed 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 99 of 184 consent form with the participant, allowing time for th e participant to reflect on 
the procedures and issues presented, and answering all questions completely.  
An Assessment of Understanding is used to document the participant’s 
understanding of key concepts in this HIV vaccine trial. The participant must 
complete the Assessment of Understanding before enrollment. Staff may provide 
assistance in reading and understanding the questions and responses, if necessary. 
Participants must verbalize understanding of all questions answered incorrectly. 
This process and the participant’s understanding of the key concepts should be 
recorded in source documentation at the site.  
IRB/EC and any applicable RE may require that a participant has signed either a 
screening or protocol -specific consent document prior to administeri ng the 
Assessment of Understanding. The consent process (including the use of the 
Assessment of Understanding) should be explained thoroughly to the IRB/EC and 
any applicable RE, whose recommendations should be followed.  
9.2 Pre-enrollment procedures  
Screening  may occur over the course of several contacts/visits, up to and 
including before vaccination on day 0. All inclusion and exclusion criteria must 
be assessed within 56 days before enrollment, unless otherwise specified in the 
eligibility criteria (or below  in this section).  
After the appropriate informed consent has been obtained and before enrollment, 
the following procedures are performed:  
• Medical history, documented in the case history record;  
• Assessment of Understanding (see Section 9.1.3 ); 
• Assessment of whether the volunteer is at low risk for HIV infection  (see low 
risk guidelines in Appendix J  and Appendix K ); 
• Complete physical examination, including height, weight, vital signs, and 
clinical assessments of head, ears, eyes, nose,  and throat; neck; lymph nodes; 
heart; chest; abdomen; extremities; neurological function; and skin;  
• Assessment of concomitant medications the volunteer is taking, including 
prescription and nonprescription drugs, vitamins, topical products, 
alternative/co mplementary medicines (eg, herbal and health food 
supplements), recreational drugs, vaccinations, and allergy shots;  
• Laboratory tests, including:  
▪ Screening HIV test,  
▪ CBC with differential and platelet count,  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 100 of 184 ▪ Chemistry panel (ALT, AST, ALP, and creatinine ), 
▪ Urine dipstick (urinalysis if indicated, see Section 9.9), 
▪ HBsAg,  
▪ Anti-HCV Ab,  
▪ Urine or serum pregnancy test (volunteers who were assigned  female  sex 
at birth ); 
▪ Pap smear  (Only for volunteers who were assigned  female  sex at birth  and 
who agree to provide cervical samples; not required if volunteer has had 
Pap smear within previous 3 -5 years with most recent result normal or 
ASCUS or less than 21 years old  (see Section 7.1, Criterion 23; 
• Syphilis test,  
• Administration of behavioral risk assessment questionnaire;  
• Obtaining of volunteer demographics in compliance with the NIH Policy on 
Reporting Race and Ethnicity Data: Subjects in Clinical Research, Aug. 8, 
2001 (available at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice -files/NOT -OD-01-
053.html);  
• Counseling on HIV testing and risk reduction, performed in compliance with 
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s current 
guidelines or other local guidelines for HIV counseling, testing, and referral as 
described in Section 9.7; and  
• Discussion of pregnancy prevention. A pregnant or breastfeeding person may 
not be enrolled in this trial. Specific criteria and assessment of contraception 
and pregnancy status are described in study inclusion criteria. Discussion of 
pregnancy prevention includes advising a participant who was assigned  
female sex at birth and who reports no current sexual activity that could lead 
to that participant becoming pregnant to have a plan to begin adequate birth 
control. This plan would be put to use if, during the study, the participant 
becomes sexually active in a way that could lead to that participant becoming 
pregnant.  
9.2.1  Use of screening results from another HVTN  study  
If a participant screens for an HVTN study at the same HVTN CRS but then does 
not join that study, screening results from that effort may be applied to the 
screening for this protocol, as long as the screening was done under participant 
consent, the  participant has signed a consent form to begin screening for this 
study, and the tests were conducted within the time periods specified in the 
eligibility criteria (see Sections 7.1 and 7.2). 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 101 of 184 9.3 Enrollment and vaccination visits  
Enrollment is simultaneous with first vaccination.  The HVTN CRS requests the 
randomization assignment  via a Web -based randomization system. In general, t he 
time interval between randomization and enrollment should not exceed 4 working 
days. However, c ircumstances may require a participant’s enrollment vis it to be 
changed. This may exceed the 4 -day randomization time limit.  
At all vaccination visits, the following procedures are performed before 
vaccination:  
• Abbreviated physical examination, including weight, vital signs, and a 
symptom -directed evaluation b y history and/or appropriate physical exam 
based on participant self -reported symptoms or complaints;  
• Assessment of baseline reactogenicity parameters;  
• Assessment of concomitant medications (as described in Section 9.2); 
• Assessment of any new or unresolved AEs/intercurrent illnesses; and  
• Urine or serum pregnancy test (for participants who were assigned  female  sex 
at birth ). Persons who are NOT of repr oductive potential due to having 
undergone total hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy (verified by medical 
records), are not required to undergo pregnancy testing.  
Following completion of all procedures in the preceding list, and if results 
indicate that  vaccination may proceed, vaccination is prepared and administered 
(see Sections 8.3 and 8.4). 
Administration of all injections during a vaccination visit must be accomplished 
within 1 calendar day.  
Immediately following vaccination, the participant remains in the clinic for 
observation. An initial reactogenicity assessment is  made at a target of 30 minutes 
after injection, with an acceptable range of 25 -60 minutes. Before leaving the 
clinic, the participant is given the Participant Diary  and is instructed on how to 
complete it. The site will make arrangements to be in contact with the participant 
during the reactogenicity period (as described in Section 9.10). 
The following procedures will be performed at all vaccination visits. These 
procedures may be performed prior to or following vaccination:  
• Risk reduction counseling (as described in Section 9.7);  
• Pregnancy prevention assessment (as described in Section 9.2 and 9.8); and  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 102 of 184 • Assessment of new or unresolved social impacts (site staff will ask participant 
about the status of any unresolved social impacts and if s/he has experienced 
any new social impacts as a result of the trial participation).  
Additional procedures will be performed at scheduled visits as specified in  
Appendix G :  
• HIV infection assessment including pretest counseling. A subsequent follo w-
up contact is conducted to provide post -test counseling and to report results to 
participant;  
• Confirm that participants received HIV test results from previous visit. If not, 
provide test results and post -test counseling as appropriate; and  
• Administratio n of the social impact assessment questionnaire (types of 
impacts assessed involve personal relationships, health insurance, life 
insurance, educational or employment opportunities, housing, immigration, or 
travel);  
• Administration of behavioral risk assess ment questionnaire;  
• Administration of a questionnaire that asks the participant about any HIV 
testing he or she may have received outside of the study. Participants will also 
be asked whether they believe they received the active vaccine or the control ; 
• Specimen collection (blood and/or mucosal  and/or stool ) should be completed 
prior to vaccination;  
• For participants who agree to mucosal sampling collection (see  Appendix G ): 
▪ Urine test or swab  for gonorrhea and chlamydia;  
▪ Vaginal swab for Trichomonas and bacterial vaginosis (for participants 
providing cervical samples);  
• Vaginal swab (if indicated) for  hyphae/budding yeast (for participants 
providing cervical samples);  
• Syphilis serology; and  
• Mucosal specimen collection.  
9.4 Follow -up visits  
The following procedures are performed at all scheduled follow -up visits:  
• Risk reduction counseling (as described in Section 9.7);  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 103 of 184 • Pregnancy prevention assessment (as described in Section 9.2 and 9.8); and  
• Assessment of new or unresolved social impacts (site staff will ask participant 
about the status of any unresolved social impacts and if s/he has experienced 
any new social impacts as a result of the trial participation);  
• Assessment of new or continuing concomitant medications (as described in 
Section 9.2); and  
• Assessment of new or unresolved AEs/intercurrent illnesses.   
Additional procedures will be performed at scheduled follow -up visits as 
specified in  Appendix G :  
• Administration of behavioral risk assessment questionnaire;  
• Administration of the social impact assessment questionnaire (types of 
impacts assessed involve personal relationships, health insurance, life 
insurance, educational or employment o pportunities, housing, immigration, or 
travel);  
• Administration of a questionnaire that asks the participant about any HIV 
testing he or she may have received outside of the study. Participants will also 
be asked whether they believe they received the activ e vaccine or the control;  
• HIV infection assessment including pre -test counseling. A subsequent follow -
up contact is conducted to provide post -test counseling and to report results to 
participant;  
• Confirm that participants received HIV test results from pre vious visit. If not, 
provide test results and post -test counseling as appropriate;  
• Abbreviated physical examination including weight, vital signs, and a 
symptom -directed evaluation by history and/or appropriate physical exam 
based on participant self -repor ted symptoms or complaints;

assessments of head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat; neck; lymph nodes; heart; 
chest; abdomen; extremities; neurological function; and skin;  
• Specimen coll ection  (blood and/or mucosal and/or stool) ; 
• Clinical laboratory tests including:  
▪ CBC with differential,  
▪ Chemistry panel (see Section 9.2), and  
▪ Urine  dipstick (urinalysis if appropriate; see Section 9.9); and  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 104 of 184 • Urine or serum pregnancy test (for participants who were assigned  female  sex 
at birth ). Persons who are  NOT of reproductive potential due to having 
undergone total hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy (verified by medical 
records), are not required to undergo pregnancy testing.  
• For participants who agree to mucosal sampling collection (see Section  9.5): 
▪ Urine test  or swab  for gonorrhea and chlamydia;  
▪ Vaginal swab for Trichomonas and bacterial vaginosis (for participants 
providing cervical samples);  
• Vaginal swab (if indicated) for hyphae/budding yeast (for participants 
providing cervical samples);  
• Syphilis serology;  
• Pregnancy test; and  
• Mucosal specimen collection.  
9.5 Mucosal sampling  
Mucosal samples will be collected at the timepoints indicated in Appendix G  from 
the study participants who agree to these procedures.  
Participants who consent to provide cervical, rectal, or semen samples will be 
tested for the following infections at the mucosal sa mpling visits: gonorrhea, 
chlamydia, and syphilis. Participants who consent to provide cervical fluid 
samples will be tested for trichomoniasis and for bacterial vaginosis and (if 
clinically indicated) for hyphae/budding yeast. Test results will be provide d to 
participants and all participants who test positive for 1 or more of these infections 
will receive counseling as well as treatment (or referral for treatment) as 
appropriate.  Sample collection may not be performed or may be deferred to a later 
date wi thin the visit window if a contraindication to sampling (eg, active GTI) is 
present (as indicated below).  
Rectal fluid sampling (both sexes):  For participants assigned  female  sex at birth , 
a pregnancy test must be performed and be negative prior to any rec tal mucosal 
sampling. Persons who are NOT of reproductive potential due to having 
undergone total hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy (verified by medical 
records), are not required to undergo pregnancy testing. Rectal secretion sampling 
should be defer red if a participant is menstruating, but should be performed as 
soon as possible, if still within the visit window. In addition, rectal sampling will 
not be performed (or may be deferred to a later date if still within the visit 
window) if there is a cont raindication to rectal secretion sampling, such as an 
active infection or inflammation of the colorectal area [such as a herpes simplex 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 105 of 184 virus (HSV) -2 outbreak or inflamed hemorrhoids or colitis/diarrhea] or if the 
participant has any active genital tract i nfection (GTI).  
For 48 hours prior to sample collection, participants should abstain from:  
• Receptive anal sex,  
• Insertion of any foreign object or substance into the anus (including but not 
limited to cleaning products [creams, gels, lotions, pads, etc.], lubricant, 
enemas, and douching even with water), and  
• Using perianal or intra -anal steroid or other anti -inflammatory cream in or 
around the anus.  
Cervical fluid sampling (only for participants who were assigned female sex 
at birth ): Participants who are  21 years of age and older must report having had a 
Pap smear within the 3 -5 years prior to enrollment, with the latest result reported 
as normal or ASCUS  (see Section 7.1). A pregnancy test must be performed on 
the day of cervical sampling . The pregnancy test can be performed after collection 
has taken place . Persons who are NOT of reproductive potential due to having 
undergone total hysterectomy or bilateral oopho rectomy (verified by medical 
records), are not required to undergo pregnancy testing. Cervical sampling should 
be deferred if a participant is menstruating, but should be performed as soon as 
possible, if still within the visit window. In addition, cervica l sampling will not be 
performed (or may be deferred to a later date if still within the visit window) if a 
participant is known to have an active ulcerative genital lesion or  an active GTI at 
the scheduled timepoint. Participants providing cervical secretion samples should 
be advised as follows:  
• Do not use anything with spermicide, lubricants, or topical/intravaginal 
medications (eg, topical yeast infection treatments) for 48 hours before the 
samples are collected;  
• Do not douche for 48 hours before the samples are collected;  
• Do not have vaginal sex and/or insert any foreign object or substance into the 
vagina for 48 hours before the samples are collected;  
Semen sampling (onl y for participants who were born male):  Participants 
providing semen samples are asked to refrain from ejaculation for at least 48 
hours prior to specimen collection. In addition, mucosal sampling will not be 
performed (or may be deferred to a later date i f still within the visit window) if a 
participant is known or believes to have an active GTI at the scheduled timepoint . 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 106 of 184 9.6 Stool sampling  
Two stool samples will be collected from the study participants who agree to this 
procedure: 1 prior to enrollment (befo re the injection of the vaccine) and 1 at the 
month  6.5 timepoint. These samples will be collected using swabs, either via 
rectal swabs or by taking swabs from stool.  
9.7 HIV counseling and testing  
HIV counseling will be performed in compliance with the CDC’s guidelines or 
other local guidelines for HIV counseling and referral. HIV testing will be 
performed in accordance with the current HVTN HIV testing algorithm following 
enrollment.   
Participants will be counseled routinely during the trial on the avoidance of HIV 
infection and on the potential negative social impacts of testing Ab positive due to 
the vaccine. They will also be counseled on the risks of HIV Ab testing outside of 
the HVTN CRSs and will be discouraged from doing so during study participation 
and/or during any period of vaccine -induced positive serology.  
Study staff will take particular care to inform study participants of the likelihood 
of routine HIV testing being offered or performed outside the study CRS at 
emergency rooms, clinics, and medic al offices. Such testing has become more 
likely due to the CDC’s revised guidelines for HIV counseling and testing, as well 
as policy changes in many countries to make HIV testing more frequent and 
routine. CRS staff should inform participants of their rig ht to opt out of HIV 
testing outside the study site. CRS staff should inform study participants if local 
and/or state policies and regulations permit medical providers to perform HIV 
testing without first informing patients. If this is the case, then CRS s taff should 
advise study participants that they may decline testing preemptively. CRS staff 
should also inform participants if positive results must be reported to local public 
health authorities. CRS staff should also inform participants of the need to 
maintain study blinding by getting HIV testing only at the study CRS. CRS staff 
should provide participants with CRS contact information and should encourage 
participants to ask medical providers to contact the CRS. The CRS can verify that 
the participant is  in an HIV vaccine clinical trial and should only be tested at the 
study CRS.  
Potential participants identified as being HIV -infected during screening are not 
enrolled. Potential and enrolled participants identified as HIV infected will be 
referred for med ical treatment, counseling, and management of the HIV infection . 
Participants who are found to be HIV -infected after enrollment will not receive 
any additional study product but will continue to be followed in the study for 
safety assessments. These  indivi duals may also be referred to appropriate ongoing 
clinical trials or observational studies.  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 107 of 184 9.7.1  Distinguishing intercurrent HIV infection from vaccine -induced 
positive serology  
The study product may elicit an Ab response to HIV proteins. Therefore, vaccine -
induced positive serology may occur in this study. Several precautionary 
measures will be taken to distinguish intercurrent HIV infection from vaccine -
induced positive serology. These precautionary measures include:  
• Participants will have physical examination s at visits specified in  Appendix G . 
Signs or symptoms of an acute HIV infection syndrome, an intercurrent illness 
consistent with HIV -1 infection, or probable HIV  exposure would prompt a 
diagnostic workup per the HVTN algorithm for Recent Exposure/Acute 
Infection Testing to determine HIV infection.  
• HIV testing will be performed at multiple timepoints throughout the study 
(see Appendix F ). The Laboratory Program (or approved diagnostic 
laboratory) will follow the HVTN HIV testing algorithm (as described in the 
HVTN 120  SSP), which is able to distinguish vaccine -induced Ab responses 
from actual HIV infections.   
• All participants can receive HIV -1 diagnostic testing from the site following 
their last scheduled visit until they are told that they did not receive an HIV 
vaccine or that they do not have vaccine -induced seropositivity.  
• All participants who received vaccine product and who have vaccine -induced 
positive or indeterminate HIV -1 serology (as measured by the standard anti -
HIV Ab screening tests) at or after the study is unblinded will be of fered 
poststudy HIV -1 diagnostic testing (per the HVTN poststudy HIV -1 testing 
algorithm) periodically and free of charge as medically/socially indicated 
(approximately every 6 months)  unless or until HIV Ab testing is no longer 
the standard test in clinic al settings .  
9.7.2  VISP registry  
Experimental HIV vaccines may induce Ab production to HIV antigens, 
producing reactive results on commercially available HIV test kits. This is called 
“vaccine -induced seropositivity” (VISP) (see Section 9.7.1 ). In order to provide 
poststudy HIV testing to distinguish between VISP and HIV infection, and to 
mitigate potential social harms resulting from VISP in HIV vaccine recipients 
who are not infected with HIV, the HVTN has created a VISP registry. Following 
study unblinding, the registry will allow trained staff to verify that an individual 
has received an HIV vaccine, and therefore has the potential for VISP. 
Informatio n in the VISP registry will not be used for research. Rather, the registry 
exists to support provision of poststudy testing and counseling services to HIV 
vaccine recipients. The registry contains the names of all study participants, 
unless they request th at their names be removed.   
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 108 of 184 9.8 Contraception status  
Contraception status is assessed and documented at every scheduled clinic visit 
for a participant who was assigned  female sex at birth and who is sexually active 
in a way that could cause that participant to  become pregnant. Prior to enrollment 
and throughout the study, staff will ask participants to verbally confirm their use 
of adequate contraceptive methods. A participant who was assigned  female sex at 
birth and is sexually active in a way that could cause  that participant to become 
pregnant should be reminded at all scheduled clinic visits of the importance of 
using contraception and should be referred to specific counseling, information, 
and advice as needed. (Specific contraception requirements are liste d in Section 
7.1). This reminder should be documented in the participant’s study record.  
Self-reported infertility —including having reached menopaus e (no menses for 1 
year) or having undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal 
ligation ―must be documented in the participant’s study record.  
9.9 Urinalysis  
Dipstick testing may be performed in the clinic or the lab, as long as the required 
elemen ts (glucose, protein, and hemoglobin) are tested. The examination is 
performed on urine obtained by clean catch.  
If the screening dipstick is transiently abnormal due to menses or infection, 
document this issue in the participant’s source documentation. Fo r infection, 
provide appropriate treatment and/or referral. Following resolution, repeat the 
dipstick and, if within the eligibility limits specified in the protocol, the 
participant may be enrolled.  
Follow -up urinalysis should be deferred if a participant  is menstruating, but 
should be performed as soon as possible. If a follow -up dipstick is abnormal due 
to a participant’s menstrual period, document in the comment section of the case 
report form (CRF) and repeat the dipstick once the participant is no lon ger 
menstruating. A micro -urinalysis is not required.  
9.10 Assessments of reactogenicity  
For all participants, baseline assessments are performed before and reactogenicity 
assessments are performed after each vaccination. All reactogenicity symptoms 
are followe d until resolution and graded according to the Division of AIDS Table 
for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (DAIDS AE 
Grading Table), Corrected Version 2.1, July 2017 , except as noted in Section  
11.2.2 . 
The reactogenicity assessment period is 7 full days following each vaccination per 
the assessment schedule shown in Table 9-1. Participants are instructed to record 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 109 of 184 symptoms using a Participant Diary . Contacts between the participant and the site 
staff should take place  at least once between 1 -3 days postvaccination  . In general, 
a participant who self -reports any postvaccination reaction greater than mild is 
seen by a clinician within 48 hours after onset, unless the reaction is improving 
and/or has completely resolved. Clinic staff will follow new or unresolved 
reactoge nicity symptoms present at day 7  to resolution.  
Reactogenicity events are reported using CRFs that correspond to the time of 
assessment in Table 9-1. Reactogenici ty assessments include assessments of 
systemic and local symptoms, vaccine -related lesions. Events not listed on a CRF, 
or with an onset after the reactogenicity assessment period (day of vaccination 
and 7 full days after), or those meeting criteria for SA E/adverse events requiring 
expedited reporting to regulatory authorities, are recorded on an adverse 
experience log form.

9.10.1  Assessment of systemic and local symptoms  
Systemic symptoms include increased body temperature, malaise and/or fatigue , 
myalgia, headache, chills, arthralgia, nausea, and vomiting. Local symptoms 
include pain and/or tenderness at the injection site. The daily maximum severity 
reached for each symptom during the assessment period is reported.  
Body temperature is measured by oral or infrared thermometry. All temperatures 
must be measured by non -axillary thermometry. This includes temperatures taken 
in the clinic, as well as temperatures taken by participants during the 
reactogenicity period.  
Temperature is  reported in degre es Celsius. If temperature is measured in 
Fahrenheit, the conversion to Celsius should be documented in the participant’s 
chart note. A measurement is taken once daily during the assessment period and 
should be repeated if participant is feeling feverish.  
9.10.2  Assessment of injection site   
Typical injection site reactions are erythema  or redness and induration  or 
swelling. The maximum horizontal and maximum vertical measurements for all 
injection site reactions are recorded.  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 110 of 184 All injection site reactions are moni tored until resolution. Areas greater than 25 
cm2 are followed daily; otherwise, the frequency of follow -up is based on 
clinician judgment.  
9.11 Visit windows and missed visits  
Visit windows are defined in HVTN 120  Study Specifi c Procedures. For a visit 
not performed within the window period, a Missed Visit form is completed. If the 
missed visit is one that required safety assessments or local safety labs, HVTN 
CRS staff should attempt to bring the participant in for an interim v isit as soon as 
possible.  
Procedures performed at an interim visit are usually toxicity/safety assessments 
(including local safety labs) and HIV testing. With the exception of HIV testing, 
these procedures are performed only if they were required at the mi ssed visit or if 
clinically indicated. HIV testing may be performed as deemed appropriate by the 
study staff. Blood samples for immunogenicity assays are not typically collected 
at interim visits.  
If a missed visit required vaccination, please refer to Sec tion 7.3.2  and Section 
7.3.3  for resolution.  
9.12 Early termination visit  
In the event of early participant termination, site staff should consider if the 
following assessments are appropriate: a final physical examination, c linical 
laboratory tests (including urine d ipstick, CBC with differential , and chemistry 
panel), pregnancy testing, social impact assessment, and HIV test . For participants 
who have a confirmed diagnosis of HIV infection, see Section 9.14. 
9.13 Pregnancy  
If a participant becomes pregnant during the course of the study, no more 
injections of study product will be given  during the pregnancy, but remaining 
visits and study procedures should be completed unless medically contraindicated. 
For participants who are no longer pregnant, see Section 7.3.1 . In case of required 
termination from the study, enrollment in an observational study should be 
offered to the participant , if available . If the participant terminates from the study 
prior to the pregnancy outcome, the site should make every effort to keep in t ouch 
with the participant in order to ascertain the pregnancy outcome.  Pregnancies and 
pregnancy outcomes will be reported.

HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 111 of 184 9.14 HIV infection during the study  
If a participant becomes HIV -infected during the course of the study, no 
additional study product wil l be administered. Participants will be encouraged to 
continue scheduled study visits for up to 24 weeks  following their last study 
product administration. Follow -up duration for participants diagnosed with HIV 
infection may be adjusted in consultation wit h the CRS investigator and the 
HVTN 120  PSRT (eg, to avoid interference with participant initiation of HIV 
treatment). At post -infection follow -up visits, only specimens required for 
protocol -specified safety laboratory tests, urinalysis and pregnancy tests will be 
collected; in addition, some clinic procedures may be modified or discontinued 
(see Appendix F and Appendix G ). 
 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 112 of 184 10 Laboratory  
10.1 HVTN CRS laboratory procedures  
The HVTN  Site Lab Instructions  and SSP provide further guidelines for 
operational issues concerning the clinical and processin g laboratories. These 
documents  include guidelines for general specimen collection, special 
considerations for phlebotomy , specimen labeling , whole blood processing,  HIV 
screening/diagnostic testing,  and general screening and safety testing.  
Tube types for  blood collection are specified in  Appendix F . For tests performed 
locally, the local lab may assign appropriate tube types.  
In specific situations, the blood coll ection tubes  may be redirected to another 
laboratory or may require study -specific processing techniques. In these cases, 
laboratory special instructions will be posted on the protocol -specific section of 
the HVTN website.  
Of note, all assays described bel ow are performed as research assays to evaluate 
the ability of the vaccine to induce immune responses in the context of the 
participants’ genetic background, and are not approved for use in medical care. 
Results from these assays are not  made available to participants or medical 
professionals to guide treatment decisions.  
10.2 Total blood volume  
Required blood volumes per visit are shown in  Appendix F . Not shown is any 
additional blood volume that would be required if a safety lab needs to be 
repeated, or if a serum pregnancy test needs to be performed. The additional 
blood volume would li kely be minimal. The total blood volume drawn for each 
participant will not exceed 500 mL in any 56 -day (8 -week) period.  
10.3 Primary immunogenicity timepoint s 
The primary immunogenicity timepoint s in this study are at  month 6.5 and at 
month 12 . Endpoint assays  for humoral and cellular responses are performed on 
participants at the appropriate primary immunogenicity timepoint s and may be 
performed on samples collected at baseline. Depending on the initial results , 
assays for humoral and cellular responses may be  performed on samples collected 
from participants at other timepoints; the schedule is shown in  Appendix F . 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 113 of 184 10.4 Endpoint assays: humoral  
10.4.1  Binding antibody multiplex assa y (BAMA)  
HIV-1–specific total binding IgG antibodies will be assessed on serum samples 
from study participants taken at the primary immunogenicity timepoints and 
baseline. In addition, HIV -1–specific total binding IgA antibodies and binding to 
IgG subclass es (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) may also be assessed.  Specimens 
from other timepoints as well as other HIV antigens and Ab isotypes may also be 
assayed based on the results of the initial assay.  
10.4.2  Neutralizing Ab (nAb) assay  
HIV-1–specific nAb assays may be performed on serum samples from study 
participants taken at the primary immunogenicity timepoint (s). Specimens from 
the baseline and other timepoints may also be analyzed at the discretion of the 
HVTN Laboratory Program, which may be contingent on the res ults of the 
primary immunogenicity timepoint s. The TZM -bl assay will test neutralization of 
the vaccine strains (96ZM651, TV1.C, 1086.C) and a single highly neutralization -
sensitive tier 1 virus as a positive control (MW965.26). The global panel and 
clade C panel may be used to assess tier 2 neutralization [81,82] . 
10.4.3  Antibody -dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)  assay  
ADCC activity may be assessed using serum samples from study participants 
taken at the primary immunogenicity timepoints. Specimens from the baseline 
and other timepoints may also be analyzed at the discretion of the  HVTN 
Laboratory Program, which may be contingent on the results of the primary 
immunogenicity timepoints. For the Granzyme B flow -based cytotoxicity assay, 
participant sera are incubated with effector cells and gp120 -coated target. ADCC 
is quantified as n et percent granzyme B activity which is the percent of target 
cells positive for GranToxiLux (GTL), an indicator of granzyme B uptake, minus 
the percent of target cells positive for GTL when incubated with effector cells but 
without sera. For the Luciferas e-based cytotoxity assay, participant sera are 
incubated with IMC -infected cells and percent killing is measured through the use 
of Viviren luminescence.  
10.5 Endpoint assays: cellular  
10.5.1  Flow cytometry  
Flow cytometry will be used to examine vaccine -specific CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell 
responses following stimulation of PBMCs with synthetic HIV peptides that span 
the proteins encoded by the vaccine. ICS parameters will include cytokines such 
as IFN -γ, interleukin (IL) -2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, and may include 
other cytokines (such as cytokines relevant to Th2 and Th17 responses) to identify 
T cells of specific functionality. Data will be reported as percentages of CD4+ or 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 114 of 184 CD8+ T cells responding to a specific peptide pool. Additional cell surface 
markers, cytok ines, or functional markers may also be analyzed . 
10.6 Genotyping  
Molecular human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing may be performed on enrolled 
participants using cryopreserved PBMC collected at baseline, initially on 
specimens from participants who demonstrate v accine -induced T -cell responses at 
postvaccination timepoints. Other participants (including control recipients) may 
be HLA -typed to support future studies of immunological interest at the discretion 
of the HVTN Laboratory Program. Other genes, including t hose associated with 
immune  responses  (eg, immunoglobulin, or T cell receptor genes), or HIV-1 
disease  progression  may also be assessed.   
10.7 Lab assay algorithm  
The Lab Assay Algorithm lists assays to characterize cellular, humoral, and innate 
immune response s as well as host genetics that may be conducted to determine 
endpoints in HVTN vaccine trials. The type of assay(s) employed will be 
dependent on the response obtained by the primary immunogenicity assays at 
relevant timepoint s. Please note that the Lab A ssay Algorithm will be updated 
periodically to include new assays.  
10.8 Exploratory studies  
Samples may be used for other testing and research related to furthering the 
understanding of HIV immunology or vaccines. In addition, cryopreserved 
samples may be used to perform additional assays to support standardization and 
validation of existing or newly developed methods.  
10.8.1  Microbiome analysis  
Swabs of stool will be shipped to a central laboratory at the FHCRC where they 
will be stored at -80oC prior to DNA extracti on. DNA extraction will be 
performed with bead -beating and chaotropic lysis of bacteria.  Bacterial 
communities in stool samples will be assessed using broad -range 16S rRNA gene 
PCR followed by high throughput sequencing and phylogenetic/taxonomic 
analysis of the sequences. Associations identified by broad range PCR may be 
confirmed using taxon -directed quantitative PCR assays . 
10.9 Specimen storage and o ther use of specimens  
The HVTN stores specimens from all study participants indefinitely, unless a 
participant  requests that specimens be destroyed or if required by IRB/EC, or RE.  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 115 of 184 Other use of specimens is defined as studies not covered by the protocol or the 
informed consent form for the main study ( see Appendix A ).  
This research may relate to HIV, vaccines, the immune system, and other 
diseases. This could include genetic testing and, potentially, genome -wide studies. 
This research is done only to th e extent authorized in each study site’s informed 
consent form, or as otherwise authorized under applicable law. Other research  on 
specimens (“other use”) will occur only after review and approval by the HVTN, 
the IRB/EC of the researcher requesting the sp ecimens, and the CRS’s 
IRBs/ECs/REs if required.  
As part of consenting for the study, participants document their initial decision to 
allow or not allow their specimens to be used in other research, and they may 
change their decision at any time. The part icipant’s initial decision about other 
use of their specimens, and any later change to that decision, is recorded by their 
CRS in a Web -based tool that documents their current decisions for other use of 
their specimens. The HVTN will only allow other resea rch to be done on 
specimens from participants who allow such use.  
CRSs must notify HVTN Regulatory Affairs if institutional or local governmental 
requirements pose a conflict with or impose restrictions on specimen storage or 
other use of specimens.  
10.10  Biohazard containment  
As the transmission of HIV and other blood -borne pathogens can occur through 
contact with contaminated needles, blood, and blood products, appropriate 
precautions will be employed by all personnel in the drawing of blood and 
shipping and handling of all specimens for this study, as currently recommended 
by the CDC and the NIH or other applicable agencies.  
All dangerous goods materials, including Biological Substances, Category A or 
Category B, must be transported according to instructi ons detailed in the 
International Air Transport Association Dangerous Goods Regulations.

HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 116 of 184 11 Safety monitoring and safety review  
11.1 Safety monitoring and oversight  
11.1.1  HVTN 120  PSRT  
The HVTN 120  PSRT is composed of the following members:  
• DAIDS medical officer representative,  
• Protocol chair and cochair,  
• Protocol Team leader,  
• Core medical monitor,  
• Clinical safety specialist (CSS),  
• Regional medical liaison (RML)  /Regional Clinical Safety Liaison (RCSL) , 
and 
• A medical officer from an organization in Africa designated by the study 
sponsor will also participate in the PSRT.  
The clinician members of the HVTN 120  PSRT are responsible for decisions 
related to participant safety.  
The Protocol Team clinic coordinator, clinical data  manager, vaccine developer 
representative, clinical trial manager, and others may also be included in HVTN 
120 PSRT meetings.  
11.1.2  HVTN SMB  
The SMB is a multidisciplinary group c onsisting of biostatisticians, clinicians, 
and experts in HIV vaccine research that, collectively, has experience in the 
conduct and monitoring of vaccine trials. Members of the SMB are not directly 
affiliated with the protocols under review.  
The SMB revi ews safety data, unblinded as to treatment arm, approximately 
every 4 months. The reviews consist of evaluations of cumulative reactogenicity 
events, AEs, laboratory safety data, and individual reports of adverse events 
requiring expedited reporting to DAI DS and pertinent national regulatory 
authorities. To increase the sensitivity for detecting potential safety problems, the 
SMB will review safety data aggregated across multiple protocols that use the 
same or similar vaccine candidates. The SMB conducts ad ditional special reviews 
at the request of the HVTN 120  PSRT.  
HVTN 120  Version 3 .0 / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 117 of 184 Study sites will receive SMB summary minutes and are responsible for 
forwarding them to their IRB/EC and any applicable RE.  
11.1.3  SDMC roles and responsibilities in sa fety monitoring  
The roles and responsibilities of the SDMC in relation to safety monitoring 
include:  
• Maintaining a central database management system for HVTN clinical data;  
• Providing reports of clinical data to appropriate groups such as the HVTN 120  
PSRT and HVTN SMB (see Section 11.1.2 ). 
11.1.4  HVTN Core roles and responsibilities in safety monitoring  
• Daily monitoring of clinical data for events that meet the safety pause and 
HVTN 120  PSRT AE review criteria (see Section  11.3); 
• Notifying HVTN CRSs and other groups when safety pauses or planned holds 
are instituted and lifted (see Section 11.3); 
• Querying HVTN CRSs for additional information regarding reported clinical 
data; and  
• Providing support to the HVTN 120  PSRT.  
11.2 Safety reporting  
11.2.1  Submission of s afety forms to SDMC  
Sites  must submit all safety forms (eg, reactogenicity, adverse experience, 
urinalysis, local lab results, and concomitant medications) before the end of the 
next business day , excluding federal or bank holidays . The forms should not be  
held in anticipation of additional information at a later date. If additional 
information is received at a later date, the forms should be updated and 
resubmitted  before the end of the next business day after receiving the new 
information.  For the case of  a longer site holiday closure, site staff must submit 
the data by the end of the 5th day (local time) after receiving the information even 
if this day is a holiday.   
For example: If the site becomes aware of an AE on Thursday (Day 0), the site 
must submit  the data by the end of the next business day, on Friday. If there is a 
longer site h oliday closure, then this AE must  be reported no later than the end of 
the fifth day, Monday (Day 4). If Monday is a holiday as well, all safety forms 
still need to be sub mitted by the end of Monday (Day 4).  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 118 of 184 11.2.2  AE reporting  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant 
administered a study product/procedure(s) and which does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. An A E can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational study 
product/procedure(s), whether or not related to the investigational study 
product/procedure(s). All AEs are graded according to the Division of AIDS 
Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (DAIDS 
AE Grading Table), Corrected Version 2.1, July 2017 , available on the RSC 
website at http://rsc.tech -res.com/clinical -research -sites/safety -reporting/daids -
grading -tables , except :  
• Unintentional w eight loss is required to be reported as an AE only if it is 
considered to be potentially deleterious to the participant’s health (see HVTN 
120 Study Specific Procedures ); 
• Injection Site Erythema or Redness and Injection Site Induration or Swelling 
will not consider interference with usual social and functional activities such 
that: 
▪ Grade 1 is: 2.5 to < 5 cm in diam eter OR 6.25 to < 25 cm2 surface area;  
▪ Grade 2 is: ≥ 5 to < 10 cm in diameter OR ≥ 25 to < 100 cm2 surface area;  
▪ Grade 3 is: ≥ 10 cm in diameter OR ≥ 100 cm2 surface area OR Ulceration 
OR Secondary infection OR Phlebitis OR Sterile abscess OR Drainage;  
▪ Grade 4 is: Potentially life -threatening consequences (eg, abscess, 
exfoliative dermatitis, necrosis involving dermis or deeper tissue);  
Unsolicited AEs will be collected over a period of 30 days after each vaccination 
visit. All collected AEs are reported to  the SDMC on the appropriate CRF. Clinic 
staff should evaluate every AE to determine if (1) the AE meets the requirements 
for expedited reporting (Section 11.2.3 ), (2) if the AE meets the criteria for a 
safety pause/prompt AE review (Section 11.3), and (3) if the AE is a potential 
immune -mediated disease that may be listed as an AE of special interest (AESI). 
A sample list of AESI is provided in  Appendix H . 
Certain AEs will be collected and reported throughout the entire study:  
• SAEs/EAEs,  
• AESIs , 
• New chronic conditions requiring medical intervention  for ≥ 30 days,  
• Newly diagnosed or treated ST Is, 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 119 of 184 • AEs leading to early participant withdrawal or early discontinuation of study 
product(s) administration.  
CRSs are expected to notify HVTN clinical safety staff of any serious safety 
concern requiring their attention (see  Table 11-1). Telephone numbers and email 
addresses  are found  on the  Protocol home page on the HVTN Members’ site 
(https://me mbers.hvtn.org/protocols/ HVTN 120 ). Concerns requiring immediate 
attention should be communicated by calling the clinical safety phone.  
In the case of email notification HVTN clinical safety staff will reply during 
working hours ( local time ) to confirm that the email has been received and 
reviewed. If email service is not available, the HVTN CRS should notify the 
HVTN clinical safety staff of the event by telephone, then submit CRFs.  
In addition, site investigators  or their designees are req uired to submit AE 
information in accordance with IRB/EC and any applicable RE requirements.  
11.2.3  Expedited reporting of AEs  to DAIDS  
Requirements, definitions, and methods for expedited reporting of AEs are 
outlined in Version 2.0 (January 2010) of the Manual for Expedited Reporting of 
Adverse Events to DAIDS  (DAIDS EAE Manual), which is available on the RSC 
website at http://rsc.tech -res.com /clinical -research -sites/safety -reporting/manual . 
The SAE Reporting Category  will be used  for this study . 
The internet -based DAIDS Adverse Experience  Reporting System (DAERS) must 
be used for expedited AE (EAE) reporting  to DAIDS . In the event of system 
outages or technical difficulties, expedited AE reports may be submitted via the 
DAIDS EAE Form. This form is available on the DAIDS RSC website at 
http://rsc.tech -res.com/clinical -research -sites/safety -reporting/daids/paper -eae-
reporting.  
For questions about DAERS, please contact DAIDS -
CRMSsupport@niaid.nih.gov or from within the DAERS application itself.  
For questions about EAE reporting, please contact the DAIDS RSC Safety Office 
at DAIDSRSCSafetyOffice@tech -res.com .  
Under ICH E2A ( Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards 
for Expedited Reporting ), an SAE is defined as any untoward medic al occurrence 
that at any dose:  
▪ results in death,  
▪ is life -threatening (Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of 
“serious” refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event, w hich hypothetically might 
have caused death, if it were more severe),  
▪ requires patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 120 of 184 ▪ results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
▪ is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or  
▪ is a medically important event or reaction *  
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised when deciding if other situations are 
serious. Such instances could include medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening 
or result in death or hospi talization, but which may jeopardize the patient or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above. Examples of such events 
are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions not resulting in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.  
The expedited reporting period for this study comprises the entire study period for 
each individual participant (from study enrol lment until study com pletion or 
discontinuation from the study). After the expedited  reporting period for the 
study, unless otherwise noted, only Suspected, Unexpected Serious Adverse 
Reactions as defined in Version 2.0 of the DAIDS EAE Manual must be reported 
to DAIDS, if the  study staff become aware of the events.  
The NIAID/DAIDS will report all unexpected SAEs related to the study products 
observed in this clinical trial to the FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32 (IND 
Safety Reports).  However, because safety is a primary st udy endpoint, the 
Sponsor Medical Officer will not routinely be unblinded to study treatment 
assignment when there is an assessment of relatedness of the SAE with the study 
product(s); and the safety report will be sent to the FDA based on the blinded 
attribution assessment.  
In some cases, the PSRT or CRS may believe unblinding of the site PI and 
participant would be appropriate to facilitate the clinical management of an AE or 
SAE. The HVTN MOP specifies procedures for emergency unblinding, and for 
early u nblinding for medical reasons.  
The study products that must be considered in determining relationships of AEs 
requiring expedited reporting to DAIDS and pertinent national regulatory 
authorities are:  
▪ ALVAC -HIV (vCP2438) /placebo  
▪ Bivalent Subtype C gp120/ MF5 9/placebo  
▪ Bivalent Subtype C gp120/ AS01 B/placebo   
11.2.4  Expedited reporting of AEs to pertinent national regulatory 
authorities  
The study sponsor or designee(s) prepares and files expedited reports to 
appropriate regulatory authorities within the timelines required by pertinent 
national regulatory authorities.  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 121 of 184 Site IoRs/designees will submit AE information and any other relevant s afety 
information to their ECs/IRBs in accordance with EC/IRB requirements.  
11.3 Safety pause and prompt PSRT AE review  
When a trial is placed on safety pause, all enrollment and vaccination with the 
product related to the event that triggered the pause will be held until further 
notice. The AEs that will lead to a safety pause or prompt HVTN 120  PSRT AE 
review are summarized in Table 11-1. Vaccinations may be suspended for safety 
concerns other than those described in the table, or before  pause rules are met, if, 
in the judgment of the HVTN 120  PSRT, participant safety may be threatened. 
Criteria for an individual participant’s departure from the schedule of vaccinations 
are listed in Section 7.3.

b Does not include the following Grade 3 subjective reactogenicity symptoms [ injection site pain, tenderness, 
fatigue/malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, headache, nausea  (unless IV rehydration required )].  
For all safety pauses, HVTN Core notifies the HVTN 120  PSRT, HVTN 
Regulatory Affairs, DAIDS Pharmaceutical Affairs Branch (PAB), DAIDS 
Regulatory Affairs Branch (RAB), DAIDS Safety and Pharmacovigilance Team 
(SPT), and participating HVTN CRSs. When an immediate safety p ause is 
triggered, HVTN Core notifies the SMB.  
Once a trial is paused, the HVTN 120  PSRT reviews safety data and decides 
whether the pause can be lifted or permanent discontinuation of vaccination is 
appropriate, consulting  the SMB if necessary. HVTN Core notifies the 
participating HVTN CRSs, HVTN Regulatory Affairs, DAIDS PAB, DAIDS 
RAB, and DAIDS SPT of the decision regarding resumption or discontinuation of 
study vaccinations. Based on the HVTN 120  PSRT assessment, the trial sponsor 
or designee(s) notifies FDA and other pertinent national regulatory authorities as 
needed.  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 122 of 184 If an immediate HVTN 120  PSRT notification or prompt HVTN 120  PSRT AE 
review is triggered, HVTN Core notifies the HVTN 120  PSRT as soon as possible 
during working hours ( local time )—or, if the information was received during off 
hours, by the morning of the next work day. If a pr ompt HVTN  120 PSRT AE 
review cannot be completed within 72 hours of notification (excluding weekends 
and US federal holidays), an automatic safety pause occurs.  
The HVTN requires that each CRS submit to its IRB/EC and any ap plicable RE 
protocol -related safety information (such as IND safety reports, notification of 
vaccine holds due to the pause rules, unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participants or others , and notification of other unplanned safety pauses).  CRSs 
must also follow all applicable RE reporting requirements.  
In addition, all other AEs are reviewed routinely by the HVTN 120  PSRT (see 
Section 11.4.2 ). 
11.4 Review of cumulative safety data  
Routine safety review occurs at the start of enrollment and then throughout the 
study.  
Reviews proceed from a standardized set of protocol -specific safety data reports. 
These reports are produced by the SDMC and include queries to the HVTN CRSs. 
Events are tracked by internal reports until resolution.  
11.4.1  Daily review  
Blinded daily safety revie ws are routinely conducted by HVTN Core for events 
requiring expedited reporting to DAIDS, and events that meet safety pause criteria 
or prompt HVTN 120  PSRT AE review criteria.  
11.4.2  Weekly review  
During the injection phase of th e trial, the HVTN 120  PSRT reviews clinical 
safety reports on a weekly basis and conducts calls to review the data as 
appropriate. After the injections and the final 2 -week safety visits are completed, 
less frequent reportin g and safety reviews may be conducted at the discretion of 
the HVTN 120  PSRT. HVTN Core reviews reports of clinical and laboratory 
AEs. Events identified during the review that are considered questionable, 
inconsistent, or u nexplained are referred to the HVTN CRS clinic coordinator for 
verification.   
11.5 Study termination  
This study may be terminated early by the determination of the HVTN 120  PSRT,

Any policies or procedures that vary from  DAIDS and HVTN standards or require 
additional instructions (eg, instructions for randomization specific to this study) 
will be described in the HVTN 120  Study Specific Procedures.  
12.1 Social impacts  
Participants in this stud y risk experiencing discrimination or other personal 
problems, resulting from the study participation itself or from the development of 
VISP. The HVTN CRS is obliged to provide advocacy for and assistance to 
participants regarding these negative social imp acts associated with the vaccine 
trial. If HVTN CRS staff have questions regarding ways to assist a participant 
dealing with a social impact, a designated NIAID or HVTN Core representative 
can be contacted.  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 125 of 184 Social harms are tabulated by the SDMC and are s ubjected to descriptive analysis. 
The goal is to reduce their incidence and enhance the ability of study staff to 
mitigate them when possible.  
Summary tables of social impact events will be generated weekly, and made 
available for review by the protocol ch airs, protocol team leader, and the 
designated NIAID representative.  
12.2 Compliance with NIH guidelines for research involving products 
containing recombinant DNA  
Because this study is evaluating products containing recombinant or synthetic  
DNA, it must comply  with regulations set forth in the NIH’s Guidelines for 
Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid  Molecules  (April 
2016) . Information about the study must be submitted to site Institutional 
Biosafety Committees (IBC). Investigators at each site are responsible for 
obtaining IBC approval per NIH guideline section IV -B7-a-(1). IBC review and 
approval must be documented by the investigator and submitted as part of 
DAIDS’s initial protocol registration for this trial  before participants are enrolled 
at the site . If this protocol is amended, investigators should follow the 
requirements of their IBC.  
12.3 Regulatory considerations for A frican countries  
Any regulations specific to African  countries containing CRSs at which HVTN 
120 will be implemented will be observed.  
12.4 Emergency communication with study participants  
As in all clinical research, this study may generate a need to reach participants 
quickly to avoid imminent harm, or to report study findings that may otherwise 
concern their health or welfare.  
When such communication is needed, the CRS will request that its IRB/EC and 
any applicable RE expedit e review of the message. If this review cannot be 
completed in a timeframe consistent with the urgency of the required 
communication, the site can contact the participant without IRB/EC approval if 
such communication is necessary to avoid imminent harm to the study participant. 
The CRS must notify the IRB/EC and any applicable RE of the matter as soon as 
possible.

About 160 people will take part in this study at multiple sites  in Africa  and the 
United States . The research er in charge of this study at this clinic is 
[Insert name of site PI] . The United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) and 
the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation are paying for the study.  
1. We are doing this study to answer several  questions.  
• Are the study vaccines safe to give to people?  
• Are people able to take the study vaccines without becoming too 
uncomfortable?  
• How do people’s immune systems respond to different combinations and 
doses of the study vaccines? (Your immune system protects you from 
disease.)  
2. The study vaccines cannot give you HIV.  
The study vaccines are not made from actual HIV. It is impossible for the study 
vaccines to give you HIV. Also, they cannot cause you to give HIV to someone 
else. 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 146 of 184 3. We do not know if the stu dy vaccines will decrease, increase, or not change 
your chance of becoming infected with HIV if you are exposed to the virus.  
Several studies have tested whether HIV vaccines can reduce the risk of getting 
HIV from another person. In some studies, people w ho got the vaccine seemed to 
have the same  risk of getting HIV as people who did not get the vaccine. In one 
study, people who got the vaccine seemed to have a lower  risk of getting HIV 
than people who did not get the vaccine. In other studies, some people  who got 
the vaccine had a higher  risk of getting HIV than people who did not get the 
vaccine.  
This study differs from the studies in which people who got the vaccine had a 
higher or lower risk of getting HIV. The clinic staff  can tell you about the 
diffe rences.  
We do not know whether the vaccines in this study will affect your risk of getting 
HIV from another person. The risk could be higher, lower, or unchanged. It is 
very important to avoid exposure to HIV during and after the study. We will tell 
you h ow to avoid HIV.  
4.  These study vaccines are experimental.  
There are 3 study vaccines being tested in this study. They  are all experimental 
vaccines . That means we do not know whether the vaccines  will be safe to use in 
people, or whether they will work to p revent HIV infection. These vaccines are  
used only in research studies . The study vaccines are  called ALVAC -HIV 
(vCP2438), Bivalent Subtype C gp120/MF59, and Bivalent Subtype C 
gp120/AS01 B. From here on, we will call them  the ALVAC vaccine, the 
protein/MF5 9 vaccine, and the protein/AS01 B vaccine,  or the study vaccines .  
The ALVAC vaccine  
The ALVAC vaccine is made out of canarypox virus. Canarypox virus infects 
birds but cannot infect humans. This virus has small bits of man -made DNA 
inserted into it. DNA is  a natural substance found in all living things, including 
people and some viruses. The canarypox virus helps get the DNA into the body’s 
cells. The DNA then tells those cells to make small amounts of proteins that look 
like some of the ones found in HIV.  
The Protein /MF59 vaccine : 
The Protein/MF59 vaccine has man -made pieces of a protein found on the outside 
of HIV.  These proteins  will be mixed with an adjuvant. An adjuvant is a 
substance added to the vaccine to help the immune system respond better. In thi s 
study vaccine the adjuvant  is called MF59 . MF59  is commonly used in licensed 
flu vaccines in many countries. It has also been in other vaccines that have been 
given to over 50,000 people in research studies without causing any serious health 
problems.  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 147 of 184 The ALVAC vaccine and the Protein/MF59  vaccine combination is currently 
being given  in South Africa in 2 studies named HVTN 100  and HVTN 702 . For 
HVTN 100, 210 participants have received this vaccine combination. It is also 
being given in South Africa and ot her African countries in a study named  HVTN 
107. In addition, the Protein/MF59  is being given in 2 other studies named HVTN 
111 and HVTN 108. Similar Protein vaccines have been given to more than 
10,000 people in research studies.  In these studies, the pro tein vaccines did not 
cause serious health problems.  
The Protein/AS01 B vaccine:  
The Protein /AS01 B vaccine has the same proteins used in the Protein/MF59 
vaccine. However, these protein pieces are mixed with a different adjuvant called 
AS01 B. This adjuvan t is also added to this vaccine to help the immune systems 
respond better.  
The Protein/AS01 B is also being given in one of the studies mentioned above, 
named HVTN 108.  Similar vaccines have been given to over 1400 people in past 
studies. In these studies,  the vaccines did not cause serious health problems.  
This study will be the first time the ALVAC vaccine and the Protein/AS01 B 
vaccine combination will be given to humans.  
General risks of vaccines:  
All vaccines can cause fever, chills, rash, aches and pains, nausea, headache, 
dizziness, and feeling tired. Vaccines can also cause pain, redness, swelling, or 
itching where you got the injection. Most people can still do their planned 
activities after getting a vaccine. Rarely, people have side effects that  limit their 
normal activities or make them go to the doctor . 
Rarely, a vaccine can cause an allergic reaction, including a rash, hives, or trouble  
breathing. Allergic reactions can be life -threatening. You should tell us if you 
have ever had a bad reactio n to any injection or vaccine.  
Rarely, people who have received vaccines with adjuvants have developed 
illnesses called autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases have also occurred in 
people who have not been vaccinated. These diseases develop when immune c ells 
that normally protect you from illness, attack your organs instead. Autoimmune 
diseases can be serious and can also be lifelong. They can involve for example 
your liver, kidneys, skin, joints, eyes, brain, as well as other parts of the body. 
Since no one knows for sure if vaccines with adjuvants might cause autoimmune 
diseases, we continue to monitor this situation closely . 
Risks of the study vaccines:  
The ALVAC vaccine  and the Protein/MF59 vaccine : 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / Septembe r 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 148 of 184 In HVTN 100, the study vaccines have not caused serio us health problems. About 
3 out of 4 participants had mild or medium pain or tenderness on the arm where 
they got the injections. Three participants had severe arm pain after one of their 
injections. About 1 out of 7 participants had a small area of rednes s or hardening 
of the skin on the arm where they got the injections. These side effects did not 
bother most people much and all went away within a few days. Three participants 
had larger areas of redness or swelling (more than 10 cm in diameter) where they  
got the injection that bothered them. They were treated with prescription 
medications and the symptoms went away within a few days.  
About 2 out of 3 participants felt weak or tired, or had a headache or body aches 
after an injection. A small number had na usea, chills, fever, or vomiting. These 
symptoms were mostly mild but in 4 participants  their daily activities  were 
affected (joint aches in 2, weakness/tiredness in 1 and headache in another 
person). All of these symptoms went away within a few days.  
A few participants had one of these side effects after an injection: lump where 
they got the injection, itching where they got the injection or all over, lymph node 
swelling, stomach pain, diarrhea, dizziness, brief tingling around the mouth. 
These symptoms w ere all mild or medium and all went away  within a few days .  
Most of the symptoms participants had are common side effects of vaccines or of 
getting injections. We do not know yet which participants got the study vaccines 
and which got the placebo  because the study is still “ blinded” , so we do not know 
if the study vaccines  caused these side effects.   
The Protein/AS01 B vaccine:  
The Protein/AS01 B is being given in HVTN 108 and we will give you any 
important information that may come out of that stud y that may affect your health 
or your participation .  
In studies with similar products  some people had redness,  swelling, pain, muscle 
tenderness, or itching in the area where they got the injection. Some people had 
headache , weakness, increased heart rate , and increased sensitivity to stimulation 
at the site of injection. A small number of people had  flu-like symptoms, nausea, 
rash, vomiting, diarrhea, or swollen lymph nodes  after getting an injection. A very 
small number of people had tiredness  and diffic ulty sleeping . People who have 
these symptoms may only have a few of them  and they usually go away within a 
few days .  
There may be other risks of the study vaccines that we do not  yet know about.  We 
will tell you if we learn anything new that may affect y our participation  in the 
study.

HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 149 of 184 Joining the study  
5. It is completely up to you whether or not to join the study.  
Take your time in deciding. If it helps, talk to people you trust, such as your 
doctor, friends or family. If you decide not to join this study, or if you leave it 
after you have joined, your other care at this clinic and the benefits or rights you 
would normally have will not be affected.  
If you join this study, you may not be allowed to join other HIV vaccine or HIV 
prevention studies now or in the future. You cannot be in this study while you are 
in another study where you receive a study product. Also during the study, you 
should not donate blood or tissue.  
If you choose not to join this study, you may be able to join another study.  
Site: Remove item 6 if you use a separate screening consent that covers these 
procedures.  
6. If you decide to join the study, we will screen you to see if you are eligible.  
Screening involves a physical exam, HIV test and h ealth history. A physical exam 
may include, but is not limited to:  
• Checking your weight, temperature and blood pressure  
• Looking in your mouth and throat  
• Listening to your heart and lungs  
• Feeling your abdomen (stomach and liver)  
We will also do blood and urine tests. These tests tell us about some aspects of 
your health, such as how healthy your kidneys, liver, and immune system are. We 
will also test you for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and syphilis. We will ask you about 
medication s you are taking. We will ask you about behaviors that might put you 
at risk for getting HIV. If you were assigned female  sex at birth , we will test you 
for pregnancy. People who have had a hysterectomy or oophorectomy (removal of 
the uterus or ovaries, ve rified by medical records), are not required to have a 
pregnancy test.  We will also ask if you have ever been allergic to eggs, egg 
products, or the antibiotic Neomycin.  
We will review the screening results with you . The screening results may show 
you are not eligible to join the study, even if you want to. Also, you might not be 
able to join if we have already enrolled enough people of your same sex.  
Site: adapt the following section so it is applicable to the care available at your site  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 150 of 184 7. If we find that yo u have a health problem during screening or during the 
study.  
We will tell you about the care that we can give here for free.  
For the care that we cannot give, we will explain how we will help you get care 
elsewhere.  
We will not be able to pay for care f or health problems that are unrelated to this 
study.  
8. If you were assigned  female sex at birth and could become pregnant, you 
must agree to use birth control to join this study.  
Site: If you want to include Appendix B, Approved birth control methods (for sa mple 
informed consent form), in this consent form, paste it below and delete paragraph 
below.  
You should not become pregnant during the study because we do not know how 
the study vaccines could affect the developing baby. You must agree to use 
effective bi rth control from 3 weeks before your first injection until 6 months 
after your last study injection. We  will talk to you about effective  birth control  
methods.  They are listed  on a handout  that we will give to you.  
Being in the study  
If you meet the study  requirements and want to join, here is what will happen:  
9. You will come to the clinic for scheduled visits about [#] times over 12 
months.  
Site: Insert number of visits and range of visit lengths. (There is site -specific variation 
in screening protocols and in the number of possible follow -up visits between 
protocol -mandated visits).  
Visits can last from [#] to [#] hours.  
You may have to come for more visits if you have a lab oratory test resu lt or 
health issue.  
We may contact you after the main study ends (for example, to tell you about the 
study results).  
10. We will give you [Site: Insert compensation]  for each study visit you 
complete.  
This amount is to cover the costs of  [Site: Insert text]  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 151 of 184 Site: Insert any costs to participants (eg, birth control costs for female participants 
who could become pregnant).  
US sites: Include the following paragraph:  
Payments you receive for being in the study may be tax able. We may need to ask 
you for your Social Security number for tax reasons.  
You do not have to pay anything to be in this study.  
11. Not everyone in this study will get the study vaccines.  
Everyone in this study will get some placebos.  Placebos are substances that do not 
contain vaccine.  Some people will get the study vaccines and also some placebos.  
Some people will get only placebos . We will compare the results from people 
who got the placebos with results from people who got the study vaccines.  
The placebo for the study vaccines is saline solution. We do not expect  the 
placebo  to cause any health problems in people . 
The clinic staff have no say in whether you get the study vaccines and/or the 
placebos. They will not know which study products you a re getting, and neither 
will you. Only the pharmacist at your site will have this information while the 
study is going on.  
You will have to wait until everyone completes their final study visits to find out 
what study products you got. This could be 2-5 years. But, if you have a serious 
medical problem and need to know what you got before the end of the study, we 
can tell you.  
12. We will give you the study products on a schedule.  
There are 4 groups in this study. Each group will get a different combination of  
study products. The group you get assigned to is completely random. Each group 
will get 8 injections during the study. You will get the injections into your upper 
arms. At some visits you will get one injection. At other visits, you will get 3 
injections.   
The ALVAC vaccine or its placebo will go into the left arm. The Protein/MF59 
vaccine and Protein/AS01 B vaccine and their placebos will go into the right arm .  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 152 of 184 Site: You may insert the picture version of the injection schedule (Appendix I ) in

You will have to wait in the clinic for about a half hour after each set of injections 
to see if there are any problems. Then for that night and for 7 more days, you will 
need to keep track of  how you are feeling and if you have any symptoms. Within 
3 days  of vaccination, we will ask you to contact us or clinic staff will contact you  
to check on  how you are doing . You should always contact us if you have any 
issues or concerns after receiving an injection. If you have a problem, we will 
continue to check on you until it goes away . 
13. In addition to giving you the study products, we will:  
• Do regular HIV testing, as we ll as counseling on your results and on how to 
avoid getting HIV;  
• Do physical exams;  
• Do pregnancy tests if you were assigned  female  sex at birth ; 
• Ask questions about your health, including medications you may be taking;  
• Ask questions about any personal pr oblems or benefits you may have from 
being in the study, and;  
• Take blood and urine samples.  
Each time  we take blood, the amount will depend on the lab tests we need to do. It 
will be some amount between 10 mL and 200 mL (2 teaspoons to a little less than 
1 cup/ 14 tablespoons). Your body will make new blood to replace the blood we 
take out.  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 153 of 184 Site: You may want to add a sentence to the end of the previous paragraph 
contextualizing the blood volumes described (eg, “To compare, people who donate 
blood in the US can give a total of about 500 mL in an 8 -week period.”). Modify the 
example for cultural relevance and alter blood volumes as necessary.  
Site: Insert Appendix D , Table of procedures (for informed consent form) in this 
section or distribute it as a separate sheet if it is helpful to your study participants. 
You are not required to do either.  
We will be looking for side effects. We will review the results of these procedures 
and tests with you at your next visit, or sooner if necessary. If any of the results 
are important to your health, we will tell you.  
Site: in the following section, delete references to semen if your site is not 
participating in semen collection . 
14. If you agree, we will also collect stool, rectal fluid and cervical fluid or semen.   
At the end of this form we will ask if you allow us to collect stool, rectal fluid and 
cervical fluid (if you were assigned  female  sex at birth ) or semen (if you were 
assigned male  at birth ). You can decide not to give any of these samples and still 
be in the study.  
Stool  
We would like to collect a small sample of your stool to look at the bacteria living 
in your stomach. We want to learn if your immune response to th e study vaccines 
is influenced by these bacteria. We will do this twice during this study. If you 
agree to give the rectal fluid sample described below, we can collect the stool 
sample at that time, or you may provide a stool sample at home or at the clini c. 
The clinic must receive the stool sample within 24 hours after it is collected.  
Rectal fluid, cervical fluid, or semen  
We want to see how the study vaccines affect the parts of the body where people 
may be exposed to HIV: their rectum, vagina, and penis .  
We would like to collect these samples at 3 visits. When we collect the samples, 
we will test you for gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis. If you were assigned 
female  sex at birth , we will also test you for pregnancy, trichomoniasis, bacterial 
vaginosis a nd if needed, for a yeast infection. We will explain what these tests are 
for and we will give you the results. If you need care, we will tell you about the 
care we can give you at the clinic. We will also tell you about care we can help 
you get elsewhere.  We will ask you to avoid some activities for 2 days before we 
collect these samples. This will help make sure your samples give accurate lab 
readings.  
Rectal fluid  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 154 of 184 Site: You may delete the units of measure that are not used at your site in the next 
senten ce. We will collect rectal fluid by first inserting a plastic tube into your 
rectum that is about 10 cm (4 inches) long and a little less than 2.5 cm (1 inch) 
wide. The tube will go in side your bum  about 7 cm (3 inches). Then we will insert 
up to 3  small a bsorbent sponge s through the tube into the rectum. The sponge s 
will be left in place for 5 minutes and then removed.  
For the 2 days before we collect your rectal fluid:  
• Do not have  receptive anal intercourse  
• Do not put anything into your anus , includ ing cleaning products (creams, gels, 
lotions, pads, etc .), lubricant, enemas or douches (even with water)  
• Do not use any anti -inflammatory creams in or around your anus .  
We will not collect rectal fluid if we learn that you are pregnant,  or if we think 
you may have an anal or rectal infection . You should tell us if your rectal area is 
sore.  
Cervical fluid  
If you are 21 or older, y ou must have had a Pap smear within the last 3  to 5 years 
with the mo st recent result being normal. If you hav e not had a Pap smear within 
the last 3 years and would like to get one, we will tell you where you can get one . 
If you are younger than 21, you do not  need a Pap smear because at that age it is 
not medically necessary.  
To collect cervical fluid, we will g ive you a menstrual cup  to insert into your 
vagina. The study staff will explain how to insert and remove the cup, or they can 
do it for you at the clinic . We will explain how many cups we will collect and 
how long you should wear them.  
For the 2 days be fore we collect your cervical fluid,  
• Do not use any spermicide, lubricants, douche  (even with water) , or 
medication in or around your vagina;  
• Do not have  vaginal intercourse or insert anything into your vagina.  
Do not insert the menstrual cup :  
• if you t hink you may be pregnant.  
• if you think you may have a cervical or vaginal infection. We may ask you 
to collect this sample  at a later date.  
Semen  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 155 of 184 You may provide the semen at home or here. We will give you a plastic cup and 
ask you to ejaculate into  it. We must receive the semen sample within 2 hours or 
less after it is collected. For at least 2 days before providing the semen , we will 
ask you:  
• not to have sex , including oral sex  
• not to ejaculate  
• not to use anything with lubricants  
• not to put saliva on the penis  
You should tell us if you think you have an infection on your penis. If you have 
an infection,  we may not use your sample .  
15. The HVTN will test your samples to see how your immune system responds 
to the study products . 
We will se nd your samples (without your name) to labs approved by the HVTN  
for this study, which are lo cated in the United States and South Africa . 
Researchers at these labs will test your  samples to see how your immune system 
responds to the study products. In rare  cases, some of your samples may be sent to 
labs approved by the HVTN in other countries for research related to this study.  
Researchers may also do genetic testing related to this study on your samples. 
Your genes are passed to you from your birth parents . They affect how you look 
and how your body works. The differences in people’s genes can help explain 
why some people get a disease while others do not. The genetic testing will only 
involve some of your genes, not all of your genes (your genome). The res earchers 
will study only the genes related to the immune system and HIV and those that 
affect how people get HIV.  
If you become HIV infected, the researchers may look at all of the genes of the 
virus found in your samples.  If you give cervical, stool, or r ectal fluid samples, 
the researchers may look at all of the genes of the bacteria found in your samples. 
In both cases t he researchers will use this information to learn more about HIV 
and the study product(s). The researchers may put this information abou t the virus 
and/or bacteria into a protected database so that other researchers can access it. 
They would not be able to link the information to you.  
In some cases, researchers may take cells from your samples and grow more of 
them over time, so that they  can continue to contribute to this study.  
Tests done on your samples are for research purposes , not to check your health . 
The labs will not give the results to you or this clinic  because their tests are not 
approved for use in making health care decision s. 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 156 of 184 When your samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN will continue 
to store them.   
16. We will counsel you on avoiding HIV infection.  
We will ask you personal questions about your HIV risk factors such as sexual 
behavior, alcohol, and drug use. We will talk with you about ways to keep your 
risk of getting HIV low . 
Site: Delete next section if using separate consent for use of samples and information 
in other studies.  
17. When samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN wants to use 
them in other studies  and share them with other researchers . The HVTN 
calls  these samples “extra samples.”  
The HVTN will only allow your extra samples to be used in other studies if you 
agree to this. You will mark your decision at the end of this form. I f you have any 
questions, please ask.  
Do I have to agree? No. You are free to say yes or no, or to change your mind 
after you sign this form. At your request, we will destroy all extra samples that we 
have. Your decision will not affect your being in this study or have any negative 
consequences here.   
Where are the samples stored?  Extra samples are stored in a secure central place 
called a repository. [Site: choose one of the following two sentences. African sites 
should choose the sentence referencing the repository in South Africa. All other 
sites should choose the sentence referencing the repository in the United States.]  
Your samples will be stored in the HVTN repository in South Africa. Your 
samples will be stored in the HVTN repository in the United St ates. 
How long will the samples be stored? There is no limit on how long your extra 
samples will be stored. [Site: Revise the previous sentence to insert limits if your 
regulatory authority imposes them.]  
Will I be paid for the use of my samples? No. Also,  a researcher may make a new 
scientific discovery or product based on the use of your samples. If this happens, 
there is no plan to share any money with you. The researcher is not likely to ever 
know who you are.  
Will I benefit from allowing my samples to be used in other studies? Probably not. 
Results from these other studies are not given to you, this clinic, or your doctor. 
They are not part of your medical record. The studies are only being done for 
research purposes.  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 157 of 184 Will the HVTN sell my samples and i nformation? No, but the HVTN may share 
your samples with HVTN or other researchers. Once we share your samples and 
information, we may not be able to get them back.  
How do other researchers get my samples and information? When a researcher 
wants to use you r samples and information, their research plan must be approved 
by the HVTN. Also, the researcher’s institutional review board (IRB) or ethics 
committee (EC) will review their plan. [Site: If review by your institution’s 
IRB/EC/RE is also required, insert a sentence stating this.]  IRBs/ECs protect the 
rights and well -being of people in research.  If the research plan is approved, the 
HVTN will send your samples to the researcher’s location.   
What information is shared with HVTN or other researchers? The samp les and 
information will be labeled with a code number. Your name will not be part of the 
information. However, some information that we share may be personal, such as 
your race, ethnicity, sex, health information from the study, and HIV status. We 
may sha re information about the study product you received and how your body 
responded to the study product.  
What kind of studies might be done with my extra samples and information? The 
studies will be related to HIV, vaccines, the immune system and other disea ses.  
Researchers may also do genetic testing on your samples.  
In some cases, researchers may take cells from your samples and grow more of 
them over time, so that they can continue to do research with them.  
If you agree, your samples could also be used for genome -wide studies. In these 
studies, researchers will look at all of your genes (your genome). The researchers 
compare the genomes of many people, looking for common patterns of genes that 
could help them understand diseases. The researchers may put the information 
from the genome -wide studies into a protected database so that other researchers 
can access it, but your name and other personal information will not be included. 
Usually, no one would be able to look at your genome and link it to you as a 
person. However, if another database exists that also has information on your 
genome and your name, someone might be able to compare the databases and 
identify you. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or other problems. 
The risk of this is  very small. There may be other unknown risks.  
Who will have access to my information in studies using my extra samples?  
People who may see your information are:  
• Researchers who use your extra samples and information for other research  
• Government agencies  that fund or monitor the research using your extra 
samples and information

19. We may stop your injections or take you out of the study at any time. We 
may do this even if you want to stay in the study and even if you were 
scheduled for more  injections.  
This may happen if:  
• you do not follow instructions,  
• we think that st aying in the study might harm you,  
• you get HIV,  
• you enroll in a different research study where you get another study product, 
or 
• the study is stopped for any reason.  
If we stop your injections, we may ask you to stay in the study to complete other 
study pr ocedures.  
20. We will stop your injections if you become pregnant before your last 
injection .  
We will encourage you to stay in the study if you choose.  We will discuss your 
study options with you.  
If you leave the study while you are still pregnant, we will c ontact you after your 
due date to ask some questions about your pregnancy and delivery.  
21. If you get infected with HIV during the study, we will stop your injections, 
take fewer samples, and help you get care and support.  
We will encourage you to  stay in this study  for up to 6 months  after your last 
study product administration if you choose . We will discuss your study options 
with you. We will counsel you about your HIV infection and about telling your 
partner(s). We will tell you where you c an get support and medical care . Site:

HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 161 of 184 Other Risks  
22. There are other risks to being in this study.  
This section describes the other risks and restrictions we know about. There may 
also be unknown risks, even serious ones. We will tell you if we learn anything 
new that may affect your willingness to stay  in the study.  
Risks of routine medical procedures:   
In this study, we will do some routine medical procedures. These are taking blood 
and giving injections. These procedures can cause bruising, pain, fainting, 
soreness, redness, swelling, itching , a sore, bleeding , and (rarely) muscle damage 
or infection where you got the  injection . Taking blood can cause a low blood cell 
count ( anemia), making you feel tired.  
Risks of collecting rectal and cervical fluids:  
You may have some discomfort and minor bleeding during these procedures. This 
does not usually last very long.  
Personal problems/discrimination/testing HIV antibody positive:  
About 10 to 20% of people who join HVTN studies report personal problems or 
discrimination because of joining an HIV vaccine study. Family or friends may 
worry, get upset or angry, or assume that you are infected with HIV or at high risk 
and treat you unfairly as a result. Rarely, a person has lost a job because the study 
took too much time away from work, or because their employer thought they had 
HIV.  
The body makes antibodies to fight or prevent infection. Most vaccines cause the 
body to make antibodies as a way of preventing infection. Your body may make 
antibodies to HIV because you received HIV study vaccines. The study vaccines 
are likely to cause you to test positive on some types of HIV tests, even if you are 
not infected with HIV.  This is called vaccine -induced seropositivity (VISP). VISP 
means that after you get the study vaccines, a routine HIV test done outside this 
clinic is likely to say you have HIV, even if you don’t.  For this reason, you should 
plan to get HIV tests only at this clinic during the study. Our tests can tell the 
difference between true HIV infection and a positive result that is caused by the 
study vaccines.  
If you receive a positive test result caused b y the study vaccines at any time, we 
can arrange  free HIV testing for as long as you need it. If this happens, we do not 
know how long you will test positive due to the study vaccines. If you receive a 
positive HIV test result and we determine it is becaus e you have HIV, we will 
refer you for follow -up care.  
HVTN 120  Version  3.0 / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 162 of 184 It is unlikely, but you could test negative at the end of the study and positive some 
time later, even though you don’t have HIV. This could happen if different HIV 
tests come into use. We will give you  a phone number to call for more 
information.  
Site: Modify the following paragraph if applicable.  If someone believes you are 
infected with HIV even if you are not, you could face discrimination and other 
problems. For example, you could be denied medical  or dental care, employment, 
insurance, a visa, or entry into the military in some countries. If you do have a 
positive HIV antibody test caused by the study vaccines, you will not be able to 
donate blood or organs. Your family and friends may treat you di fferently. We 
will give you a brochure that tells you more about testing HIV positive because of 
an HIV vaccine, and how you can avoid some of these problems.  
If you become pregnant during or after the study and have VISP, we don't know if 
the antibodies c ould be passed to your baby. We know that this happens with 
other vaccines, like tetanus vaccine. These antibodies from the mother are not a 
danger to the baby, and they go away over time. For most babies antibodies from 
the mother last for about six month s. 
You should always tell the delivery staff if you have VISP. However, you may 
still be tested for HIV using the antibody test when you deliver your baby. If your 
test is positive and the delivery staff believes you have an HIV infection, your 
baby may be  started on antiretroviral treatment when it is not needed. If this 
happens, we can arrange for you and the baby to have a test that can tell the 
difference between true HIV infection and a VISP result. If you or the baby 
continue to have VISP, we can arra nge this testing for free for as long as it is 
needed . 
Embarrassment/anxiety:  
You may feel embarrassed when we ask about your HIV risks, such as having sex 
and using drugs. Also, waiting for your HIV test results or other health test results 
could make yo u feel anxious. You could feel worried if your test results show that 
you are infected with HIV. If you feel embarrassed or anxious, please tell us and 
we will try to help you.  
Risks of disclosure of your personal information:  
We will take several steps to  protect your personal information. Although the risk 
is very low, it is possible that your personal information could be given to 
someone who should not have it. If that happened, you could face discrimination, 
stress, and embarrassment. We can tell you m ore about how we will protect your 
personal information if you would like it.  
Risks of genetic testing:  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 163 of 184 It is unlikely, but the genetic tests done on your samples could show you may be 
at risk for certain diseases. If others found out, it could lead to di scrimination or 
other problems. However, it is almost impossible for you or others to know your 
test results from the genetic testing. The results are not part of your study records 
and are not given to you.  
U.S. Sites, include the following paragraph . In the very unlikely event that your 
genetic information becomes linked to your name, a federal law called the 
Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) helps protect you.  GINA 
keeps health insurance companies and employers from seeing results of gene tic 
testing when deciding about giving you health insurance or offering you work. 
GINA does not help or protect you against discrimination by companies that sell 
life, disability or long -term care insurance.  
Unknown risks:  
We do not know if the study vacc ines will increase, decrease, or not change your 
risk of becoming infected with HIV if exposed. If you get infected with HIV, we 
do not know how the study vaccines might affect your HIV infection or how long 
it takes to develop AIDS.  
We do not know if gett ing these study vaccines will affect how you respond to 
any future approved HIV vaccine. Currently, no HIV vaccine has been approved 
for use.  
We do not know how the study vaccines will affect a pregnant participant or a 
developing baby.  
Benefits  
23. The study may not benefit you.  
We do not know whether getting the study vaccines might benefit you in any way. 
However, being in the study might still help you in some ways. The counseling 
that you get as part of the study may help you avoid getting HIV. The l ab tests 
and physical exams that you get while in this study might detect health problems 
you don’t yet know about.  
This study may help in the search for a vaccine to prevent HIV. However, if the 
study vaccines later become approved and sold, there are no  plans to share any 
money with you.

24. If you join the study, you have rights and responsibilities.  
You have many rights that we will respect. You also have responsibilities. We list 
these in the Participant’s Bill of Rights and Responsibilities. We will give you a 
copy of it.  
Leaving the study  
25. Tell us if you decide to leave the study.  
You are free to leave the study at any time and for any reason. Your care at this 
clinic and your legal rights will not be affected, but it is  important for you to let us 
know.  
We will ask you to come back to the clinic one last time for a physical exam, and 
we may ask to take some blood and urine samples. We will also ask about any 
personal problems or benefits you have experienced from being in the study. We 
believe these steps are important to protecting your health, but it is up to you 
whether to complete them.  
Injuries  
Sites: Do not change text in  the following section (except as prompted) without 
obtaining prior approval from HVTN Regulato ry Affairs at vtn.core.reg@hvtn.org  
26. If you get sick or injured during the study, contact us immediately.  
Your health is important to us. (Sites: adjust the following 2 sentences if 
applicable to the care available at your site)  We will tell you about the c are that 
we can give you here. For the care that we cannot provide, we will explain how 
we will help you get care elsewhere . 
If you become sick or injured in this study, there is a process to decide if it is 
related to the study products and/or procedures.  If it is, we call it a study -related 
injury. There are funds to pay for treatment of study -related injuries if certain 
conditions are met.  
Next paragraph for African sites:  
Sites: adjust the language in this paragraph so it is applicable to your site. No te: 
insurance is purchased for all African countries.  In this study, our clinic has 
insurance to cover your medical treatment in the case of a study -related injury . In 
rare cases, the insurance funds may not be enough. The vaccine developers have 
agreed to  pay medical costs for study -related injuries that are determined to be 
caused by their own study products .  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 165 of 184 The HVTN has limited funds to pay medical costs that it determines are 
reasonable . (Sites: insert locale -appropriate medical insurance language in the 
following sentence)  If the injury is not study related, then you and your health 
insurance will be responsible for treatment costs.  
Some injuries are not physical. For example, you might be harmed emotionally by 
being in an HIV vaccine study. Or you m ight lose wages because you cannot go 
to work. However, there are no funds to pay for these kinds of injuries, even if 
they are study related.  
You may disagree with the decision about whether your injury is study related. If 
you wish, the HVTN will ask ind ependent experts to review the decision. You 
always have the right to use the court system if you are not satisfied.

HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 168 of 184 Appendix B  Approved birth control methods for persons 
assigned female sex at birth (for sample informed 
consent form)  for Africa n sites  
You should not become pregnant during the study because we do not know how 
the study vaccines could affect the developing baby.  
You must agree to use effective b irth control, from 3 weeks before your first 
study injection until 6 months after your last study injection.  
Effective birth control  for participants in Africa is defined as using 2 methods of 
birth control  every time you have sex . These include 1 of the following methods : 
• Male or female condoms; or,  
• Diaphragm or cervical cap;  
PLUS 1 of the following methods:  
• Birth control drugs that prevent pregnancy —given by pills, shots, patches, 
vaginal rings, or inserts under the skin;  
• Intrauterine device (IUD); or  
• You are only having sex with a partner who has had a vasectomy. (We will 
ask you some questions to confirm that the vasectomy was successful.).  
You do not have to use birth control if:  
• You have reached menopause, with no menstrual periods for one year;  
• You have had a hysterectomy (your uterus removed);  
• You have had your ovaries removed;  
• You have a tubal ligation (your “tubes tied”) or confirmed successful 
placement of a product that blocks the fallopian tubes;   
• You are sexually abstinent (no sex at all)  
Sites may delete the bullets below, if desired.  
• You are having sex only with a female partner or partners;  
• You only have oral sex.  
Remember: If you are having sex, male and female condoms are the only birth 
control methods that also provide protect ion again st HIV and other sexually 
transmitted infection s.

When samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN wants to use them 
in other studies and share them with other researchers. The HVTN calls these 
samples “extra samples”. The HVTN will only allow your e xtra samples to be 
used in other studies if you agree to this. You will mark your decision at the end 
of this form. If you have any questions, please ask.  
1. Do I have to agree?  
No. You are free to say yes or no, or to change your mind after you sign this f orm. 
At your request, we will destroy all extra samples that we have. Your decision 
will not affect your being in this study or have any negative consequences here.   
2. Where are the samples stored?  
Extra samples are stored in a secure central place called a  repository. [Site: 
choose one of the following two sentences. African sites should choose the 
sentence referencing the repository in South Africa. All other sites should choose 
the sentence referencing the repository in the United States.]  Your samples wi ll 
be stored in the HVTN repository in South Africa. Your samples will be stored in 
the HVTN repository in the United States.  
3. How long will the samples be stored?  
There is no limit on how long your extra samples will be stored.  [Site: Revise the 
previous sentence to insert limits if your regulatory authority imposes them.]  
4. Will I be paid for the use of my samples?  
No. Also, a researcher may make a new scientific discovery or product based on 
the use of your samples. If this happens, there is no plan to sh are any money with 
you. The researcher is not likely to ever know who you are.  
5. Will I benefit from allowing my samples to be used in other studies?  
Probably not. Results from these other studies are not given to you, this clinic, or 
your doctor. They are not part of your medical record. The studies are only being 
done for research purposes.  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 172 of 184 6. Will the HVTN sell my samples and information?  
No, but the HVTN may share your samples with HVTN or other researchers. 
Once we share your samples  and information , we may not be able to get them 
back.  
7. How do other researchers get my samples and information?  
When a researcher wants to use your samples and information, their research plan 
must be approved by the HVTN. Also, the researcher’s institutional review board 
(IRB) or ethics committee (EC) will review their plan. [Site: If review by your 
institution’s IRB/EC/RE is also required, insert a sentence stating this.]  IRBs/ECs 
protect the rights and well -being of people in research. If the research plan is 
approved, the HVTN will send your samples to the researcher’s location.  
8. What information is shared with HVTN or other researchers?  
The samples and information will be labeled with a code number. Your name will 
not be part of the information. However, some information t hat we share may be 
personal, such as your race, ethnicity, gender, health information from the study, 
and HIV status. We may share information about the study product you received 
and how your body responded to the study product.  
9. What kind of studies mig ht be done with my extra samples and information?  
The studies will be related to HIV, vaccines, the immune system and other 
diseases.  
Researchers may also do genetic testing on your samples.  
In some cases, researchers may take cells from your samples and  grow more of 
them over time, so that they can continue to do research with them.  
If you agree, your samples could also be used for genome wide studies. In these 
studies, researchers will look at all of your genes (your genome). The researchers 
compare the  genomes of many people, looking for common patterns of genes that 
could help them understand diseases. The researchers may put the information 
from the genome -wide studies into a protected database so that other researchers 
can access it, but your name an d other personal information will not be included. 
Usually, no one would be able to look at your genome and link it to you as a 
person. However, if another database exists that also has information on your 
genome and your name, someone might be able to com pare the databases and 
identify you. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or other problems. 
The risk of this is very small. There may be other unknown risks.  
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018  
HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 173 of 184 10. What are the risks of genetic testing?  
It is unlikely, but t he genetic test s don e on your samples  could show you may be 
at risk for certain diseases. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or 
other problems. However, it is almost impossible for you or others to know your 
test results from the genetic testing. The results  are not part of your study records 
and are not given to you.   
US Sites, include the following paragraph   
In the very unlikely event that your genetic information becomes linked to your 
name, a federal law called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act 
(GINA) helps protect you.  GINA keeps health insurance companies and 
employers from seeing results of genetic testing when deciding about giving you 
health insurance or offering you work. GINA does not help or protect you against 
discrimination by compa nies that sell life, disability or long -term care insurance.   
11. Who will have access to my information in studies using my extra samples?  
People who may see your information are:  
• Researchers who use your extra  samples and information for other research  
• Gover nment agencies that fund or monitor the research using your  extra  
samples and information  
• Any regulatory agency that reviews the research using your extra samples and 
information  
• The researcher’s Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee  
• The people wh o work with the researcher  
All of these people will do their best to protect your information. The results of 
any new studies that use your extra samples and information may be published. 
No publication will use your name or identify you personally.

Institute for Communicable Diseases (Johannesburg, South Africa) ; UW-VSL = University of 
Washington Virology Specialty Laboratory (Seattle, Washington, USA).  
2 HVTN Laboratories include: Cape Town HVTN Immunology Laboratory (CHIL, Cape Town, 
South Africa); South African Immunology L aboratory –National Institute for Communicable 
Diseases (SAIL -NICD, Johannesburg, South Africa); Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center 
(Seattle, Washington, USA); Duke University Medical Center (Durham, North Carolina, USA).   
3 Screening may occur over the  course of several contacts/visits up to and including day 0 prior to 
vaccination.  
4 Local labs may assign appropriate alternative tube types for locally performed tests.  
5 Chemistry panels are defined in Section  9.2 (pre-enrollment) and Section  9.3 (postenrollment).   
6 Immunogenicity assays will be performed at M0 (for binding Ab assay), M6.5, and M12. Based on 
the number of responders observed at these timepoints, lab assays may be performed on 
participants for humoral and cellular responses at other timepoints.  
7 Genotyping may be performed  on enrolled participants using cryopreserved PBMC collected at 
baseline, initially in participants who demonstrate vaccine -induced T -cell responses at 
postvaccination timepoints.  
8 For a participant who  was assigned female sex at birth , pregnancy test must be performed on  urine 
or blood specimens within 24 hours of vaccination with negative results received prior to 
vaccination. Persons who are NOT of reproductive potential due to having undergone total 
hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy (verified b y medical records), are not required to undergo 
pregnancy testing.  
9 At an early termination visit for a withdrawn or terminated participant who is not HIV -infected (see 
Section  9.12), blood should be drawn for HIV diagnostic testing, as shown for visit 12 above. If a 
participant has a confirmed diagnosis of HIV infection, do not collect blood for HIV diagnostic 
testing (see Section  9.14). 
10 Pregnancy testing at the indicated visit is only required of participants who were assigned female 
sex at birth and are providing a cervical and/or rectal secretion sample.  
11 Syphilis testing by serology and Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing by urine will only be performed 
if the participant agrees to provide a mucosal sample.  
12 Cervical/vaginal swabs will only be collected from participants who agree to provide a cervical 
secretion sample and for yeast if clinically indicated.  
13 Optional mucosal specimens may be collected as part of screening and prior to the enrollment visit 
once the participant has been found to have met mucosal specimen collection criteria specified in 
Section  9.5. 
14 Optional stool specimen must be collected prior to first vaccination.  
15 For participants with confirmed diagnosis of HIV infection, only specimens required for protocol -
specified safety laboratory tests, urinalysis, and pregnancy tests will be collected.  
y = 17 mL of SST blood collected for the Binding Ab and Neutralizing Ab assays will also cover 
specimen needs for the Ab avidity and ADCC assays; no separate blood draw is needed.

HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 181 of 184 Appendix J  Low Risk Guidelines for the United States  
The following are intended as guidelines for the investigator to help identify 
potential vaccine trial participants at “low risk” for HIV infection in the US.  
These guidelines are based on behaviors within the last 6 -12 months prior to 
enrollment; however , it may be appropriate to consider a person’s behavior over a 
longer period of time than specified to assess the person’s likelihood of 
maintaining low risk behavior. Some volunteers may not be appropriate for 
enrollment even if they meet these guidelines . These guidelines should be 
supplemented and interpreted with local epidemiologic information about HIV 
prevalence in your area and community networks.  The investigator may review 
the risk level of any volunteer with the site PI and/or protocol safety re view team.  
A volunteer may be appropriate for inclusion if he/she meets these guidelines:  
1. SEXUAL BEHAVIORS  
In the last 12 months  did not : 
• Have oral, vaginal or anal intercourse with an HIV -infected partner, or  
a partner who uses injection drugs   
• Give or r eceive money, drugs, gifts or services in exchange for oral, 
vaginal or anal sex  
AND  
In the last 6 months  has abstained from penile/anal or penile/vaginal 
intercourse, OR  
In the last 6 months : 
• Had 4 or fewer partners of the opposite birth sex for vaginal a nd/or 
anal intercourse, OR  
Is an MSM (person born male with partner(s) born male) who, in the last 12 
months : 
• Had 2 or fewer MSM partners for anal intercourse and had no 
unprotected anal sex with MSM, OR  
• Had unprotected anal intercourse with only 1 MSM par tner, within a 
monogamous relationship lasting at least 12 months (during which 
neither partner had any other partners). If the monogamous 
relationship ended, the volunteer may then have had protected anal 
intercourse with 1 other MSM partner (total 2 or f ewer partners in the 
last 12 months).  
Is a transgender person, regardless of the point on the transition spectrum, 
having sex with men (born male) and/or other transgender persons, who in the 
last 12 months : 
HVTN 120  Version 3.0  / September 12, 2018

which neither partner had any other partners). If the monogamo us 
relationship ended, may then have had protected anal or vaginal sex 
with 1 other partner (total 2 or fewer partners in the last 12 months).  
AND  
Uses or intends to use condoms in situations which may include penile/anal or  
penile/vaginal intercourse with  new partners of unknown HIV status, 
occasional partners,  partners outside a primary relationship, and/or partners 
known to have other partners.  
2. NON -SEXUAL BEHAVIORS  
In the last 12 months  did not:  
• Inject drugs or other substances without a prescription  
• Use cocaine, methamphetamine, or excessive alcohol, which in the 
investigator’s judgment  rendered the participant at greater than low 
risk for acquiring HIV infection.  The investigator’s judgment should 
consider local epidemiologic information about HIV prevalence in the 
area and community networks.  
A volunteer is NOT appro priate for inclusion if he/she:  
Acquired an STI (i.e. new infection) in the last 12 months:  
• Syphilis  
• Gonorrhea  
• Non-gonococcal urethritis  
• Herpes Simplex Virus type 2 (HSV2)  
• Chlamydia  
• Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)  
• Trichomonas  
• Mucopurulent cervicitis  
• Epididymitis  
• Proctitis  
• Lymphogranuloma venereum  
• Chancroid  
• Hepatitis B

HVTN120_v3.0_FINAL.docx  / Page 183 of 184 Appendix K  Low Risk Guidelines for Africa  
The following are intended as guidelines for the investigator to h elp identify 
potential vaccine trial participants at “low risk” for HIV infection. These 
guidelines are based on behaviors within the last 12 months prior to enrollment; 
however, it may be appropriate to consider a person’s behavior over a longer 
period of  time than specified to assess the person’s likelihood of maintaining low 
risk behavior. Some volunteers may not be appropriate for enrollment even if they 
meet these guidelines . These guidelines should be supplemented and interpreted 
with local epidemiolo gic information about HIV prevalence in your area and 
community networks. The investigator may review the risk level of any volunteer 
with the site PI and/or protocol safety review team.  
ASSESSMENT OF SEXUAL BEHAVIORS  
Consider whether a volunteer would be appropriate for inclusion if, within 12 
months prior to enrollment, the person:  
• Abstained from penile/vaginal and penile/anal intercourse, or  
• Was in a mutually monogamous relationship with a partner with a 
known HIV -uninfected status, or  
• Had one partner be lieved to be HIV -uninfected with whom he/she 
regularly used condoms for penile/vaginal and penile/anal intercourse.  
Exclude a volunteer if:  
Within the 12 months prior to enrollment: a history of newly acquired syphilis, 
gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis , active HSV lesions, chancroid, pelvic 
inflammatory disease (PID), genital sores or ulcers, cervicitis, genital warts of the 
labia minora, vagina, or cervix, or any other symptomatic genital warts.

Original 
protocol  October 5 , 2016   
 RATIONALE  for Amendment 1:  The regulatory agencies sought to improve clarity on  i) escalation 
within or initiation of new cohorts, ii) how adverse events would be managed (including drug or immu ne related AEs) , iii) patient stopping procedures , iv) imaging of injection of tumors to  improve 
necrosis monitoring of injected tumors, v) reduc ing bleeding risk as well as  drug extravasation and 
vi) remove section inconsistencies.   
 RATIONALE for Amendment 2:  In an effort t o facilitate appropriate patient selection , recruitment 
and to support enrollment, the entry criteria have been modified.  The additional changes made improve the clarity and consistency of the protocol with its corresponding manuals and other ancillary do cuments. Changes to section 6 cohort A1 were as a result of dosing the sentinel patient. 
 
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
Intensity Therapeutics’ Confidential Information                                                Page 5 of 212 RATIONALE for Amendment 3.  These changes were made per request by and in agreement with 
FDA.  
 RATIONALE for Amendment 4.  Several adjustments from the steering committee were implemented via administrative letters.  This amendment seeks to incorporate these changes plus include the most recent steering committee recommendations on new cohorts (combinations and higher dose cohort EC2).  Additional minor changes were made to improve the clarity and consistency of the protocol.  RATIONALE for Amendment 5.  Fifty -five patients have been treated and the safety has been 
reviewed for the monotherapy and combination with pembrolizumab arms.  There has been only 1 event that qualified for a technical DLT, which was a grade 3 abdominal pain, which was reviewed by the SSC and felt not to be dose limiting.  Side effects have been mainly low-grade pain at the injection site, and the pharmacokinetics support minimal exposure to the cytotoxic agents in the formulation.  We have therefore decided to simplify the dosing, to a fixed maximal amount of 175mL.  Retreatment has also provided benefit.  As a result, Sponsor will add a periodic maintenance dose of INT230-6.  To capture the potential treatment benefit, the response criteria was amended to focus on iRECIST.  This criteria was first introduced to capture the unique response pattern seen with immunotherapy.  This study has demonstrated increases in tumor volume at the first scan which sometimes are associated with decreased contrast uptake.  We see an influx of 
immune cells on the 1 month tumor biopsy.  Sponsor therefore chose to focus on the iRECIST principles for assessing response.  Safety data was reviewed by the S tudy Steering C ommittee and 
supported initiation of the phase 2 portion of the protocol with the combination of pembrolizumab and INT230-6.  Additional minor changes were made to improve the clarity and consistency of the protocol.  In collaboration with the National Cancer Institute Sponsor conducted research in murine cancer models combining INT230- 6 with CTLA -4 antibodies.  Sponsor’s published results show 
strong synergy of the combination with  tumor growth inhibition and survival.  Amendment 4 
discussed an outline of the cohort with a CTLA- 4 antibody (cohort FEC).  This amendment defines 
the specifics of the dosing and the CTLA-4 antibody being used in cohort FEC ( ipilimumab ). 
 RATIONALE for Amendment 6.  The primary goal  for Amendment 6 is  to simplify the INT230-6 
dose calculation  and ensure patients  enrolled are likely to  benefit from study drug.  70 patients have 
been treated in IT -01 as of December  31, 2020.  After  SSC determination of safety in  subjects  
receiving the fixed dose regimen  and adequate characterization  of the pharmacokinetics, we have 
removed the PK sampling .  In addition, blood biomarker sampling has been discontinued while we 
focus on the tumor associated biomarkers. A new exclusion criterion  was added to exclude subjects 
that have a tumor (s) > 15 cm  (in longest diameter ). Further, t reatment plan for subjects  with tumors 
that are 9 to 15 cm  should be discussed with and approved by the medical monitor.

Objectives:  
Primary:  
• The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple intratumoral doses 
of INT230-6 in subjects with advanced or recurrent malignancies.  This will be assessed by the rate of > grade 3 Adverse Events ( AEs) attributed to INT230-6 and not the underlying 
disease  
Secondary:  
• Assess the preliminary efficacy of INT230 -6 by measuring the disease control rate 
(CR+PR+PD) as assessed by iRECIST  
• Characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of multiple doses the three INT230-6 components (CIS, VBL, and SHAO) after single and then multiple IT tumor site injections

Intensity Therapeutics’ Confidential Information                                                Page 9 of 212 • To characterize the overall safety profile of INT230 -6 
Exploratory: 
• Characterize tumor response in injected and non- injected sites  
• Evaluate various tumor and anti-tumor immune response biomarkers that may correlate 
with tumor response 
• Evaluate overall response by i RECIST  
• Characterized the pharmacodynamics (PD) profile of the INT230 -6 formulation in subject   
treated and untreated tumors 
• To assess the progression free and overall survival in subjects receiving INT230-6 
Methodology:  
This is a clinical study of a new investigational treatment that uses a novel drug product called 
“INT230-6" to treat advanced cancers.  INT230- 6 is a fixed  ratio, multi-agent formulated drug product 
designed specifically for intratumoral (IT) injection.  This study will determine the safety of 
administering a fixed volume of INT230- 6 per cm3 of tumor into superficial, followed by multiple 
deep tumors.  A sentinel subject  will be enrolled at the lowest dose and followed for 4 weeks prior to 
escalating or adding additional subjects.  Gradual intra- subject  dose escalation will be done to increase 
the total amount of drug delivered to enable large tumors to be fully dosed at the proposed drug to 
tumor ratios.  Once escalation dosing cohorts are complete, if no MTD is obtained, then set a fixed total dose of INT230-6 to be used for all dosings.  Using fixed doses INT230- 6 treatment shall consist 
of an induction phase for  certain cohorts along with a maintenance regimen.  INT230-6 will also be 
tested in combination with addition al agents such as checkpoint antibodies in escalation or fixed 
dosing. 
 
Dose escalation  
There are 6 cohorts of subjects in the escalation portion of the protocol where INT230 -6 dosing is 
increased over 5 doses.  These escalation cohorts are (A, B1, EA, EC, EC2 and DEC).  Enrollment in 
these cohorts is closed.  
Cohort 1 (A) wa s a superficial tumor cohort starting at up to 5.0 mL of total dose with a low tumor 
load (1:4 ratio of drug to tumor).   
Cohort 2 (B1) was a deep tumor cohort start ing at  up to 5.0 mL and escalates the total dose and 
maximal dose per any one tumor.   
Cohort 3 ( EA) explored administration in superficial tumors every 2 weeks.   
Cohort 4 (EC) explored administration in both superficial and deep tumors every 2 weeks at a higher 
drug load (1:2 ratio) and will escalate the total dose and maximal dose per any one tumor.   
Cohort 5 (EC2) explored administration in both superficial and tumors every 2 weeks at an intermediate drug load (1:3 ratio) and will escalate the total dose and maximal dose per any one tumor.  
 
Cohort 6 ( DEC ) combined pembrolizumab and escalating  doses of INT230-6 and includes a safety 
lead-in cohort that doses INT230-6 in superficial tumors.

Fixed Dose INT230-6 
There are 4 cohorts that use a maximum total fixed dose of INT230-6 of 175 mL for all 5 induction 
doses and along with maintenance doses.  The maintenance dose is an INT230-6 dose given every 9 
weeks +/ - 10 days up to a maximum total dose amount of 175 mL.  The fixed dose cohorts are EC3, 
DEC2, FEC and potentially GEC and each  follows the Q 2 week INT230-6 dosing schedule at drug 
load to tumor volume ratio of 1:3 into  both superficial and deep tumors for tumor types defined in the 
appropriate supplement.   
Cohort 7 (EC3) explores administration of INT230-6 monotherapy for any tumor type.   
Cohort 8 (DEC2) combines a fixed dose of pembrolizumab with the same INT230-6 dosing regimen of 
EC3 as outlined in Supplement A.   
Cohort 9 (FEC) combines a fixed dose of ipilimumab with the same INT230 -6 dosing regimen of EC3 
as outlined in Supplement A.   
Future Cohort 10 (G cohort) combines INT230-6 with other molecules.   
Additional cohorts can be added depending on review of safety data by the Study Steering Committee.  
All cohorts and decisions to escalate the dose and introduce new subject populations will be governed by the Study Steering Committee (SSC).   
 
Expansion cohorts 
The SSC reviewed the safety and any available biologic and/or tumor measurement data, a decision to 
open expansion cohorts of 10-16 subject s with a single tumor type was  made.  Th ese groups will allow 
for better point estimates of the safety and preliminary efficacy in a homogenous population. 
Number of subject s (planned):  
The sample size (estimated to be between 100 and 175 subject s) during dose escalation cannot be 
precisely determined but depends on the observed toxicity.  In expansion cohorts, up to 16 subjects will be treated at fixed doses in a tumor type, to provide preliminary assessment of tumor response, in addition to safety assessment.

NOTE: F or specific inclusion/exclusion criteria relating  to a potential combination, please refer 
to the combination specific supplement. 
Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration:  
INT230- 6 administered intratumorally , a fixed combination of cisplatin, vinblastine and SHAO  
Duration of treatment:  
In A1 and B1 cohorts, s ubjects received injections monthly for up to 5 doses of INT230-6 (4 months). 
In E cohorts, injections are given every 2 weeks for up to 5 doses.  Cohorts EC3, DEC2 , FEC and

dosing once every 9 weeks +/ - 10 days until CR, PD or 2 years, whichever is first.  Given the short 
half-life of the components of INT230-6, safety follow up post the last dose of treatment is 28 days for 
monotherapy cohorts.  Subjects are followed regularly until progression and/or start of subsequent 
anti-cancer therapy.  Afterwards subjects will transition to a less frequent survival follow up.  The total 
expected duration of the study is 5 years .  
Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration:  
NA 
Criteria for evaluation: Efficacy : 
Since this is a locally administered product, it allows for multiple efficacy analyses.  The primary 
efficacy measure will  be disease control rate (CR+PR+SD) as assessed by iRECIST .  Since immune 
system activation is expected from preclinical studies, the trial will collect samples from the peripheral 
blood and from tumors to look at markers of activation.  Furthermore, observing tumor shrinkage in 
non-injected bystander tumors would also indicate potential immune activation.   In order to take the whole picture into account, the exploratory endpoints will look at overall tumor response, time to progression and overall surviva l.

urine sampling for clinical laboratory parameters), pregnancy testing, Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performance status, physical examination including vital sign measurements, any  
needed  or completed  electrocardiogram (ECG), and adverse events.  
 
Pharmacokinetic: 
Individual subject P K profiles will be tabulated following the intratumoral administration of INT230 -6.  
Sponsor expects that the P K profiles of three analytes SHAO/CIS/VIN given intratumorally may have 
significant inter -subject  variability.  This variability is due to the ex pected release kinetics into the 
blood stream following intratumoral dosing of INT230-6 via a) absorption into the tumor’s blood 
vasculature and b) from release from tumor microenvironment over time.  Final analysis  of the PK at 
the doses given indicate s that only 5% of the active ingredients for a given dose are present in the 
blood.  The concentration is very consistent and h ave a meaningful dose response.  As a result, the 
SSC determined that PK sample collection is no longer necessary at these dose levels  in Amendment 6.   
 
Statistical methods: 
Safety Analyses: All recorded adverse events will be listed and tabulated by system organ class, 
preferred term, and dose and coded according to version 19.1 of MedDRA. The incidence of adverse 
events will be ta bulated and reviewed for potential significance and clinical importance. Vital signs 
and clinical laboratory test results will be listed and summarized by dose. Any significant physical 
examination findings and results of clinical laboratory tests will be listed. ECG listings will be 
evaluated by the investigator and abnormalities, if present, will be listed.  
 
Adverse Events will be summarized for all reported data and by study period: a) up to and including 28 
days post last dose of initial treatment, and  b) from first dose of re -initiation of treatment, for subjects 
who re- initiate study therapy while in follow -up, up to 28 days post-dose of the last re- treatment dose  
for all monotherapy cohorts.  Please see cohort supplements for combination follow up. 
 
Efficacy Analyses: In order to perform preliminary evaluation of anti- tumor activity, injected tumor 
response (ITR), bystander tumor response (BTR) overall objective response (ORR), and disease 
control rate (DCR) will be tabulated by frequency distribution overall and by tumor type.  
For DCR in each expansion cohort, an exact binomial 95% confidence interval will be determined by 
Clopper-Pearson method. Median time to response and duration of response will be summarized for 
those subjects with confir med responses, using Kaplan- Meier method; PFS will be similarly 
summarized. Individual tumor measurements, tumor burden and % changes in tumor burden will be listed. Changes in tumor burden will be presented graphically.  
With 1 6 subjects treated in an expansion cohort, at a fixed dose and tumor type, the 90% confidence 
interval for a disease control  rate would be (3.4% to 36%) if 2 subjects (12.5%) had a response, (5.3% 
to 42%) if 3 (19%) subjects had a response, (9.0% to 48%) if 4 (25%) subjects had a response, and 
(13.2% to 54.8%) if 5 (31%) subjects had a response.

A final PK analysis section will be included in the final clinical study report.  The release kinetics of 
each analyte is not expected to be uniform across subject s.  Sponsor shall assess the blood 
concentrations of the three analytes for each subject at the first cycle.  Sponsor shall correlate the 
systemic measurement (Cm ax, AUC) of the 3 analytes to measured markers of systemic toxicity (in 
particular renal and blood – the known toxicities of the two active age nts; cisplatin & vinblastine).    
Human plasma will be analyzed for the concentration of vinblastine and SHAO using validated LC/MS/MS methods, and for cisplatin using a validated ICP-MS method.  For pharmacokinetic 
profiling platinum drugs, total platinum levels in subject  plasma or urine are routinely determined by 
spectroscopy methods as a surrogate.  Thus an ICP-MS method will be developed for this study to 
measure total platinum in human samples as a surrogate for cisplatin.  
In addition, scatter plots of Cmax and AUC(TAU) versus INT230-6 dose volume will be provided for 
the first dosing.  Dose proportionality per subject  normalized to tumor volume will be assessed, by 
estimating the slope of linear regression of SHAO/CIS/VIN log(Cmax) on log(dose) and of 
log(AUC(TAU)) on log(dose) based on a power model. Point estimates and 90% confidence intervals 
for the dose proportionality parameter (slope of the linear regression) will be calculated for Cmax and AUC  (TAU). Summary statistics for trough (Cmin) concentrations will be tabulated by dose and study 
cycle. Plots of Cmin vs. cycle will be assessed for Cohorts A1, B1 versus E Cohorts provided by dose.  For D and F cohorts refer to the appropriate supplements.  Pharmacokinetic concentrations from sparse samples will be listed and  may be used in combination with other studies for exposure-response or 
population pharmacokinetic modeling, which will be part of a separate report.  The SSC will evaluate whether PK sample collection can be stopped after a certain number of patients have been treated in cohort DEC2 and cohort FEC. 
 
Exploratory Biomarkers (Immune Function and others) Analyses : Summary statistics for immune 
function and other exploratory markers, such as but not limited to flow cytometry outcomes, cytokines, 
quantitative immunoglobulins, quantitative inflammatory infiltrates, T -cell repertoire and their cha nges 
(or percent changes) from baseline will be tabulated by cycle visit and dose to assess 
pharmacodynamic effects. In addition, the time course of biomarker outcomes will be investigated 
graphically, by summary plots (i.e., box plots) or individual subje ct plots over time. Possible 
associations between changes in biomarker measures of interest and pharmacokinetic exposure will be 
explored. Possible associations of various biomarkers measures (baseline value or change from 
baseline) with clinical outcome ( e.g., tumor response) may will be explored based on data availability, 
using response- evaluable subjects, to assess explore predictive markers in tumors. Methods such as, 
but not limited to, logistic regression may be used to explore such associations. Mea sures from 
markers based on optional samples, e.g., tumor-based markers may be similarly presented, depending 
on data availability.  
Administrative interim analyses on safety and efficacy or on PK, and selected biomarkers may be 
provided at several times prior to completion of the study in order to facilitate program decisions and 
to support study presentations or publications.

3.1. Background  
This trial is a  phase 1/2 s afety study of i ntratumorally a dministered INT230-6 in adult s ubjects with 
Advanced Refractory Cancers.  This trial is an adaptive open label exploration of INT230-6.  The 
trial enrolls any advanced cancer subjects with an accessible tumor for in jection who have failed or 
are not a candidate for approved therapies.  The trial will be governed by a Study Steering 
Committee  (SSC) who will review the data and help to adapt the protocol to minimize the number of 
subjects need for each stage.  Since ad ministration of the investigational material is direct to the 
tumor, biopsies of the tumor before and during treatment will enable assessment of immunologic effects in the tumor and help to understand possible pharmacodynamic effects.   
In the phase 1 portion INT230-6 wa s given in escalating amounts to the subject  by increasing the 
number of tumors injected, increasing the total volume per tumor injected and increasing the 
concentration by tumor.  Many of these escalations were done with intra- subject  increases .  The 
drug components are well known, but this combination and mode of administration had not been delivered  before, therefore the trial sought to begin with tumors that are superficially palpable to 
establish safety data before progressing to tumors which required imaging guidance.   The central 
objective of the phase 1 portion of the study wa s to characterize the safety and tolerability of 
INT230-6 alone and in combination with other therapeutic agents.  The SSC  has reviewed the safety 
and preliminary efficacy data from subjects in the phase 1 portion of the study. The SSC 
recommended initiation of phase 2 expansion cohorts of subjects.   
In the phase 2 expansion cohort portion of the study, the objective will be to characterize INT230 -
6’s effect  on the disease control rate as monotherapy and in combination with other drugs. Given the 
mechanism of action, Sponsor expects measurement of both the injected tumor responses as well as 
any bystander (untreated) tumor responses will be straightforward .   
Cisplatin ( as an IV product) is considered an irritant at concentrations <0.5 mg/mL.  Vinblastine 
sulfate is considered a vesicant when dosed IV at 1 mg/mL.   In Sponsor’s local tolerance toxicology 
study both 2 and 5 mL of INT230-6 were injected directly in 3 different tissue types of healthy dogs (subcutaneously, intraperitoneal and intrahepatic) over 8 days.  There were no gross or microscopic 
vessication observations due to INT230-6 in any tissues when given locally.  The current status of 
the safety aspects of the drug product and this study, including clinical adverse events, can be found 
in the investigator’s brochure.  Please refer to the latest version of the investigator’s brochure for safety information.
 
 
3.2. Systemic chemotherapy  
Systemic chemotherapy has formed the mainstay of the treatment of solid tumors from 1980s and 
onward offering the ability to kill rapidly dividing cells.  Many cytotoxic agents have components of their mechanism that involve immune activation  (Galluzzi_2015 ( 1)). Yet when tumors are 
shrinking during the course of treatment, there is little evidence of a memory immune effect that is maintained.  There are several hypotheses for this observation.  While chemotherapy  may be pro -
inflammatory, there are many anti -inflammatory signals in the tumor microenvironment 
(checkpoints, regulatory cells, etc.).  Recent approaches have combined chemotherapy with checkpoint inhibition to see if this aspect could yield a more robust immune effect (Rizvi_2016 ( 2)).  
Also,  systemic administration of these agents results in  impairment of bone marrow function.  It is 
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
Intensity Therapeutics’ Confidential Information                                                Page 25 of 212 also speculated that the kinetics of tumor cell death are slower than the kine tics of the innate 
immune system. In other words, the innate system clears tumor antigens faster than they can be 
processed by the ada ptive immune system (Obeid_2007 ( 3)).  However , given the number of tumors 
that remain sensitive to chemotherapy, this approach continues to be util ized and efforts to minimize 
impact on normal tissues are being studied. 
 
3.3. Local administration of cytotoxic agents 
In an effort to spare subjects from the side effects of systemically administered chemotherapy, 
researchers have deliver ed drugs directly to the tumor.  In animal models (typically localized 
disease), this has shown some promise.  However, in multiple clinical trials in advanced cance r 
patients , these approaches have failed to show superior outcomes compared to systemically 
administered drugs (Lammers_2006 ( 4)).  This is likely due to the poor diffusive and dispersive 
ability of these prior intratumoral formulations.  For the most part cytotoxic agents are hydrophilic 
and do not disperse throughout the tumor .  Research by the Sponsor indicates that intratumoral 
delivery of aqueous solutions are ejected from the tumor.  In addition, since many cancer cells could be circulating or residing in small amounts in other tissues , localized approaches often  fail to treat 
the full exten t of the disease.  IV administration can disperse drug broadly via the bloodstream; 
however, given systemic effects , only low drug doses ultimately reach the tumor  and even less is 
taken up by the cancer cells.  Typically, cyto toxic drugs require active transport to enter cells , a 
process  mediated by receptors.   Receptor transport  is slow and efflux pumps within cancer cells 
often remove the drugs.  As a result of negative trials,  registrational efforts for  intratumoral deliver y 
approach es of cytotoxic agents has been largely abandoned. 
 
3.4. Immunotherapy 
The concept of cancer immunotherapy has been around for many years, but its use is limited to a few settings  (BCG in bladder and high dose IL-2 in melanoma).  In the 2000’s with the discovery of 
checkpoints and their role in suppressing anti- tumor immunity  research on cancer treatments 
incorporating the immune system accelerated .  CTLA4 antibodies demonstrated that by blocking 
cancer’s  negative signal, a proportion of metastatic melanoma patients could achieve a long- lasting  
response off of treatment.  Response to these treatment s seemed  to require an inflamed tumor and/or 
a high mutational burden in order for effect use of checkpoint inhibitors (Snyder_2014 ( 5)).  Further 
improvement on this concept was seen with the discovery of anti- PD-1 antibodies which s eem to be 
more selective in activating the immune system and more capable of promoting an immune response 
than CTLA4 molecules.  Anti-PD-1 therapy has seen  promising activity in a variety of tumor types 
and has been approved for use in melanoma, lung, urothelial, hepatocellular, gastric, cervical, 
hematologic, microsatellite unstable,  and renal cancers  (Pembrolizumab_Package_Insert  (6)).  Yet  
many patients still do not respond to immunotherapy treatment.  Some improvement in melanoma can be seen if both approaches are given simultaneously (anti-CTLA4 combined with anti-PD1).   
 
3.5. Drug Product INT230-6 
INT230-6 is multi-component, new drug product specially formulated for intratumoral 
administration.  The technology used in the product facilitate s dispersion of drugs throughout the 
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
Intensity Therapeutics’ Confidential Information                                                Page 26 of 212 tumor and diffusion into cancer cells.  INT230-6 is comprised of a cell permeation enhancer 
molecule with  two, potent anti- cancer  payloads (cisplatin and vinblastine) in fixed ratio. The 
enhancer is not covalently bound to the drugs.  Typically, t he permeability of cancer cell membranes 
is more fluid than  healthy cell s (Sok_2002 ( 7)).  Thus, the presence of the enhancer allows for 
increased  passive diffusion of the therapeutic agents into the cancer cell s.  Both cisplatin and 
vinblastine function inside the cell.  Vinblastine acts by binding to tubulin leading to 
depolymerization of the microtubule and mitotic arrest.  This interrupts the cell cycle and stops 
replication of the cell  (Vinblastine_Package_Insert  (8)).  Cisplatin has a proposed mechanism of 
action that  introduces a defect in the DNA, causing DNA damage and ultimately apoptosis 
(Dasari_2014 ( 9)).  Once the two  molecules diffuse into the cell, the permeation enhancer is diluted 
from the drugs, which remain in higher concentration within the cell.  The combination of tubulin 
inhibition  and cell apoptosis cause significant cell death  throughout the injected tumor.  Data 
generated by the Sponsor show increased in flux of dendritic and T- cells into the tumor.  The result is 
a robust CD8 response that  clears the remaining live tumor cells.  Results from studies  
(Walters_2015 ( 10)) also show a CD4/CD8 memory response is also induced that  can protect treated 
animals against re -exposure to the same cancer cell line.  This approach offers patients the potential 
for a targeted and generally nontoxic therapy – one that kills a large portion of the injected tumors - stimulate s a systemic immune response to clear the tumor that  eliminate s distal tumor cells and  
prevents r ecurrences.   
 
3.6. Rationale for IT -01 Study Design  
3.6.1. Preclinical data with INT230- 6 in cell lines  
INT230-6 has been studied in vitro with multiple patient derived and cancer cell lines.  In Caco-2 monolayer studies, INT230-6 has demonstrated the ability to diffuse drugs through the membrane without disruption of the cell surface architecture.  The drugs also penetrate into the nucleus.  A 
critical ratio of enhancer to drug ratio is required to achieve this transport .  In addition, Sponsor 
studied the release of LDH by cells treated with INT230 -6.  Results showed that when the drugs 
enter the cell, the membrane integrity is intact and LDH is not released  (Intensity_in_vitro_e237 
(11)).  INT230-6 thus has strong dose dependent, growth inhibition of tumor cells. 
3.6.2. Preclinical data with INT230-6 in vivo models 
Intratumoral d rug dispersion of formulations in tumors with and without cell penetration enhancers 
was evaluated using BxPc3 pancreatic tumor xenographs.  A butterfly needle was placed into the center of a tumor (>500 mm3).  Various amounts of either INT230-6 (N=8) or aqueous cisplatin 
(drug) (N=6) preparation with 3 drops of India Ink (~150 μL/10mL in each preparation) were injected over 90 seconds using metered pump at drug dose to tumor volume ratios of approximately 
1:11 or 1:5. The needle was left in the tumor for an additional 30 seconds following injection. After 
euthanasia, tumors were removed, dissected, then fixed and sliced for Haemotoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining.  
The intratumorally dosed cisplatin without the enhancer showed substantial leakage from the 
injected tumors into the interstitial space between the tumor and skin. The injected INT230-6 appeared to be fully absorbed into the tumor ( Figure 1 ). INT230-6 plus ink dispersed throughout 
the tumor as seen in ( Figure 2 ); however, drug without the penetration enhancer was poorly 
absorbed into the tumor and almost no ink is observed to be absorbed within the tumor. This

highly significant (p<0.005) when compared to the cisplatin/vehicle group.

 Figure 2: Comparison of dispersion following one-time, intratumoral injection of 75 or 225 µL 
for 90 seconds of drug only with ink compared to INT230-6/ink. 
 
INT230-6 demonstrated reduction in tumor burden that was statistically superior to no treatment 
controls in immune competent BALB/C mouse models.  Sponsor, in collaboration with the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) , investigated the impact on INT230-6 on promoting a T-cell response.  
Colon-26/CT26/4T1 studies all reveal strong anti-tumor activity of INT230-6.  Key features include 
the ability to reduce tumor burden from baseline in the majority of animals, high rates of complete 
responses that  are dependent on CD8 T- cell activity, an ability to shrink and in some cases clear 
distal untreated tumors, and the ability to induce long term immunity which is co-dependent on CD4 
and CD8 T- cells.  Biopsies of tumors over time indicate recruitment of dendritic cells and 
lymphocytes to the tumor within 10 days of treatment (Bloom_2015 ( 12)) Walters_2015 ( 10)).  
Presumably these are facilitating antigen presentation of tumor antigens expressed by intact tumor cells that are no longer replicating and are undergoing cell death.  Sponsor suggests that antigen 
processing is occurring with evidence of cross priming.  Mice, given colon cancer SC  using 
Sponsor’s technology achieved a complete response.  Animals rec hallenge d with a 4T1 breast 
cancer inoculation in the absence of any new treatment became more resistant to this challenge than naïve animals  with no drug therapy.  There are publications in the literature of shared antigens

the injected tumors are partially due to enhanced cytotoxicity during the first week after treatment, 
but in part due to presence of CD8 T -cells.   When CD8 T -cells are depleted prior to treatment 
animals see regression of their tumors initially then regrowth with no complete responders .  These 
results compare to 80% complete responders if CD8 T- cells are present  (see Figure 3 ).

and without intact T -cells.

Multiple preclinical studies support consecutive injections ( up to 5 daily injections in a cycle ) into 
the same nodule (approximately 300mm
3).  In addition, studies support repeating the treatment cycle 
after a period of rest yields improved efficacy outcomes without an increase toxicity.  In fact, there 
was some weight loss in the first cycle that resolved  and nearly non- existent in  subsequent cycles.  A 
preclinical study showed that after 3 days of injection 75% of a tumor became necrotic while the animals continued to be injected without additional complications .  The Sponsor believes that the 
totality of preclinical data demonstrating no observed or increased toxicity with significantly increased efficacy justifies in the protocol using tumor injection with multiple cycles of tumor reinjection.  
 
3.6.3. Checkpoint blockade  
Nature has created checkpoints on the immune system to regulate the activity of the immune cells. 
These pathways are crucial for self -tolerance to prevent the immune system from attacking healthy 
cells indiscriminately. Large pharmaceutical companies such as Merck, Roche, AstraZeneca, Pfizer  
and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) have developed new types of anti -cancer anti -body drugs with the 
ability to modify and block the checkpoints on the immune system .  These large molecules are the 
curren t immunotherapy that have shown long term durable responses in patients.   
However, these checkpoint molecules have shown success in only some  types of cancers – often those 
that are the most mutated.  Sales of these drugs are currently in the billions of dollars. Approved

development.  
Our belief was that our products would be synergistic with checkpoint inhibitors.  We along with our 
partners at the National C ancer Institute conducted experiments to demonstrate that our lead drug 
INT230- 6 is synergistic with these new checkpoint blockage drugs.  Results show strong benefit in 
regressing tumors with the combination of INT230- 6 and checkpoint inhibitors and improving 
survival.  The data from  the combination of INT230 -6 with both anti -PD-1 or CTLA -4 antibodies in 
a dual tumor (metastatic) cancer mouse cancer model .  The data was generated by our partners at the 
National Cancer Institute and under our CRADA.

Intensity Therapeutics’ Confidential Informatio n 3.7. Prior Experience with Similar Investigational agents 
Companies have recently reported results from locally administered (IT) products .  These 
companies report  that local administration  of their products is able to demonstrate  distal 
responses through presumed immune activation.  These IT approaches claim  good safety 
of the procedure and translation from preclinical models to the clinical setting.  
The firm Onc osec has developed a DNA plasmid which expresses IL-12 by in vivo 
electroporation (i.e., intratumoral needle placement with electric current). Immunosec 
performed  a phase 1 study in melanoma which revealed that in 10 patients (53%) there 
was evidence of a systemic response resulting in either stable disease or objective 
regression of untreated bystander tumors. In addition, in three of these patients (15%), all 
of the distant tumors regressed completely in either the absence of any other systemic 
antitumor therapy (two patients) or after treatment with dacarbazine (one patie nt).  In 
vivo electroporation was associated with minimal systemic toxicity. No hematologic 
abnormalities were observed. The most fre quent adverse event related to treatment was 
transient pain during the electroporation procedure (13 patients had grade 1 and eleven  
had grade 2 pain) and bleeding around the treatment site (13 patients had grade 1 and 11 grade 2 hemorrhage).   A dose -proportional increase in IL-12 protein expression 
compared with pretreatment was seen in all patients with no significant IL -12 spillage 
into circulation and a correlative increase in tumor levels of IFN -gamma . The 
experimental regi men was found to be safe and well tolerated, with minimal systemic 
toxicity and with transient pain associated with the administration  (Daud_2016 ( 14)). 
Provectus has developed an intralesion al (IL) formulation of Rose Bengal (RB), an inert 
dye. In preclinical studies, utilizing an  OVA-expressing B16 melanoma murine model, 
Provectus found that intratumoral RB treatment led  to increased tumor- specific T -cells 
with memory characteristics. Intratumoral RB therapy al so increased antigen- specific T -
cell proliferation and enhanced tumor regression. In addition, IL RB facilitated dendritic 
cells (DCs) infiltrating lymph nodes draining from tumor. Incubation of melanoma cells 
with RB led to necrosis and the release of High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1), which activated DCs. The blockade of HM GB1 significantly reduced the antigen-presenting 
ability of DCs. Subsequently they performed a pilot clinical study in melanoma patients. Intratumoral RB led to tumor regression in both RB-injected and un- injected tumors, 
associated with an increase in cir culating T- cells. Increased tumor -specific response was 
found from those circulating T- cells of 5 out of 7 tested patients after IL RB treatment. 
HMGB1 levels in patient sera were also elevated (Liu_2016  (15)).  Broadly, Provectus 
demonstrated response rates of approximately 50% in the injected melanoma tumors, and 
some bystander responses (33% CR+ PR) which correlated with injected tumor respons es 
(Thompson_2015 ( 16)). 
Based on a comparison of Sponsor’s murine data, Sponsor expects INT230-6 will be more potent than either approach of Onco sec or Provectus.  INT230- 6 acts by inducing 
direct tumor c ell death due to potent agents.  In addition, INT230-6 attracts  inflammatory 
cells to the tumor microenvironment.  Sponsor’s preclinical program, although not with a 
direct comparison to these other therapies , INT230 -6 showed the ability to regress large

(Intensity_E238 ( 18)). 
On October 27, 2015 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first 
intratumorally dosed oncolytic virus therapy, talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC, or 
Imlygic® ). The  agency approved T- VEC for the treatment of some patients with 
metastatic melanoma that cannot be surgically removed.  The approval was based on the 
results of a multicenter phase III clinical trial of patients with metastatic melanoma 
lesions in the skin and lymph nodes.  Substantially more patients in the trial treated with 
T-VEC had a decrease in the size of their skin and lymph node lesions that lasted at least 
6 months compared with patients treated with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor.  
The treatment appears to work by directly killing cancer cells and stimulating an immune 
response against tumors, the trial investigators believe. Findings from the trial were 
published (Andbaka_2015( 17)).  In the international phase III trial, called OPTiM, 436 
patients with unresectable stage IIIB to IV melanoma were randomly assigned to receive 
either T -VEC or GM -CSF. T -VEC was injected directly into the tumors, and subsequent 
doses were administered 3 w eeks after the first dose, then once every 2 weeks. GM- CSF 
was administered subcutaneously every day for 14 days, in 28- day cycles.  The durable 
response rate, which was measured as an objective response to therapy that lasted for at 
least 6 months, was significantly higher in patients who received T-VEC (16.3 percent) 
than in those who received GM-CSF (2.1 percent). T-VEC also improved median overall survival, which was 23.2 months in the T-VEC arm and 18.9 months in the GM- CSF 
arm. 
 
3.8.  Nonclinical Program for INT230- 6  
Sponsor sought guidance from FDA for a proposed nonclinical program during a pre-
IND meeting held in August 2014 to enable an IND submission.  Sponsor recognized the possibility of local and systemic exposures if INT230-6 injections via absorption in tumor blood vessels or seepage from the tumor.  Sponsor and FDA agreed on a nonclinical program consisting of 3 studies.  
• a non-GLP dose range finding study in rats 
• a non-GLP local tolerability study in dogs 
• a GLP study in rats 
The non-GLP rat study was to determine systemic toxicity using both intraperitoneal (IP) 
and intravenous (IV) administration of INT230-6.  The objectives of the study were a) to 
evaluate the eff ects of various dose volumes and regimens of INT230-6 on local and 
systemic toxicity; b) to assess systemic exposure; and c) to compare IP vs IV dosing.  
The non-GLP study would serve to determine the conditions  most appropriate for a GLP 
study to characte rize systemic toxicity in rats  and determine the human starting dose. The 
non-GLP rat study successfully characterized the range of toxicities of INT230-6 and 
confirmed (per the vinblastine label) that IP administration in rats does represent systemic 
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
Intensity Therapeutics’ Confidential Information                                                   Page 34 of 212 exposure comparable to  IV administration.  Thus, Sponsor conducted only IV 
administration for the pivotal (GLP -compliant) toxicology study of INT230-6 to enable 
higher dosages and exposures to be characterized for systemic toxicity evaluation . The rat 
was the most suitable species to evaluate systemic exposure because it is a sensitive 
model for all relevant endpoints except for emesis, which could have significantly 
disrupted the toxicology assessment if carried out in a larger species (e.g., dog). 
The GLP compliant rat study confirmed that administration of INT230-6 did not res ult in 
any new or previously unreported systemic toxicity.  Toxicities observed were consistent 
for either  cisplatin or vinblastine.  The GLP study was conducted using once-weekly 
dosing for 3 weeks at three dose volumes.  This regimen exceed s the proposed clinical 
starting regimen  of onc e monthly.  A 6 -week non-dosing observation period enabled 
evaluations of recoveries, and satellite animals characterized plasma exposures to all three analytes after the first and last doses . 
Furthermore , the sponsor conducted a local tolerability  toxicology study in dogs to assess 
local tolerance effects of human -scale dosages of INT230-6 in the event that a physician 
missed the targeted tumor and injected healthy tissue or that the drug (or components) 
partially seeped from a superficial or deep body tumor into the surrounding tissue. 
Plasma exposures were also assessed. There were 3 treatment groups in the study: 5 mL  
of vehicle/dose, 2 mL  of INT230-6/dose and 5 mL  of INT230- 6/dose, with each animal 
dosed on Day 0 subcutaneous, Day 3 intraperitoneal and Day 8 intrahepatic ( IH).  Other 
than injection site reactions attributed to extravasation from the IP dosing site, there were no observed clinical, macroscopic or histopathological observations or effects on 
surrounding healthy tissue in any INT230-6 treated dog groups for SC, IP or IH dosing 
attributable to the formulation.  
 
3.9. Starting Dose Selection Method and Dose Escalation  
FDA agreed to a protocol that used 1/10 of the STD 10 to set the starting dose.  T he STD 10 
in the rat pivotal study was approximately 7.5 mL /kg1.  As a result , 1/10 of the rat  STD 10 
is 0.75 mL /kg, which equates on a body surface area basis to a human dose of 7.3 mL/60 
kg subject2. Therefore, Sponsor proposed that the maximum permissible starting dose for 
the first -in-human (FIH)  trial be  up to 5.0 mL per subject . The target dose per tumor of 
INT230- 6 for the first cohort was  0.25 mL  per cm3 of the tumor’s volume (i.e., 1:4 
loading dose).  This drug dose volume to tumor volume ratio has consistently  shown to 
saturate large tumors in pharmacology testing and resulted  in anti- tumor activity in 
multiple preclinical models.  A n injected or to- be-injected  tumor’s volume was 
determined using the ellipsoid calculation method ( ) using 
the imaging technique available at the site ( e.g., CT, ultrasound, or MRI).  In Amendment 
6, Sponsor is  implementing  a method to set INT230-6 dose for an individual tumor based 
on longest diameter. 
 
1 The actual value for 7.5 mL/kg IV was 12.9%.   
2 (0.75 ÷ 6.2 =  0.121 mL/kg, or 7.3 mL for a 60 kg person (60 x 0.121) .

Intensity Therapeutics’ Confidential Information                                                   Page 35 of 212 The total injected volume and the maximum per any one tumor was  escalated in the 
phase 1 portion of the study.   As noted above, the toxicology program showed that  
INT230-6 administered  IV resulted in no new toxicities.  Only events expected for either 
vinblastine or c isplatin  were observed.  Please refer to the IB for further information.  
To date, doses of INT230-6 up to 172 mL have been well tolerated. Following the phase 
1, the SSC made a recommendation  to increase dose level s of INT230-6 to 175 mL 
maximum dose. This regimen was submitted to the health authorities prior to activation  
of the fixed dose cohorts in Amendment 5.  Theoretically the total amount of cisplatin  
and vinblastine administered intratumorally using INT230-6 could be considerably safer  
than the approved or MTD of IV administered cisplatin/vinblastine .  If the agents  are 
reduced /degraded or bound up while in the tumor micro environment or inside the cancer 
cells the lesser toxicities effects could be expected .  (Vinblastine binds to a cell’s tubulin 
and cisplatin to the cell  DNA.  Should these processes occur within the cancer cells of the 
tumors, then systemic exposure would be reduced and corresponding morbidity due to the drugs decreased ).  Cohort EC has delivered doses of vinblastine in some subject s that 
have exceeded the typical IV dose, without any drug related grade 3 or higher AE’s  in 
those subjects. 
 
3.10. Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics  
PK data from IV administration of INT230- 6 in male and female rats for each main 
comp onent in INT230-6 is reported in Table 3 below.  Plasma was analyzed for the 
concentration of vinblastine and SHAO using validated LC/MS/MS methods, and for 
cisplatin using a validated ICP-MS method.  For pharmacokinetic studies, total platinum 
levels in subject  plasma and urine are routinely determined by spectroscopy methods as a 
surrogate for platinum drugs.  An ICP- MS method (Frontage Laboratories BTM -1942-
R2) was developed for this study to measure total platinum in rat study samples.  This document thus reports the ICP-MS measured total platinum values (obtained from plasma 
samples using method BTM-1942- R2) as cisplatin.  The results of these analyses were 
used for toxicokinetic analyses.

4.1. Research Hypothesis 
INT230- 6 when administered  intratumorally ( IT) to one or more tumors will safely 
reduce tumor burden, control disease, and promote an immune response against the 
cancer.  
 
4.2. Primary Objective  
The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple IT doses of 
INT230-6 in subjects with advanced or recurrent malignancies.  This will be assessed by the rate of grade 3 or higher adverse events attributed to INT230-6 and not the underlying disease. 
 
4.3. Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives are to: 1) Assess the preliminary efficacy of INT230 -6 by 
measuring the disease control rate (CR+PR+SD) as assessed by iRECIST; 2) characterize 
the pharmacokinetic profile of multiple doses of the three INT230-6 components (CIS, 
VBL, and SHAO) after single and then multiple IT tumor site injections. 3) characterize 
the overall safety of the INT230-6. 
 
4.4. Exploratory Objectives  
The exploratory objectives are to: 1) Characterize tumor response in injected and non-
injected sites; 2) Evaluate various tumor and anti-tumor immune response biomarkers that may correlate with tumor response; 3) Evaluate overall response by i RECIST; 4) 
Characterize the pharmacodynamics (PD) profile of the INT230- 6 formulat ion in subject  
blood and treated and untreated tumors; 5) T o assess the progression free and overall 
survival in subjects receiving INT230-6.

5.1. Dose Escalation  
This is a FIH  Phase 1/2, open label, non-randomized study. Subjects will have refractory, 
advanced cancers and will have failed or not be a candidate for standard of care. 
Investigators will have the option to continue INT230-6 based upon safety, local 
tolerability, and tumor response.  The phase 1 portion of the study was  divided into up to 
escalating dose cohorts for administration of INT230-6 and for cohorts A1, B1, EA, EC follows a 3+3+3 design . 
Certain cohorts employed  a subject  safety lead in e.g., Cohorts A, EA, DEC, FEC, etc. 
cohort to estimate the rate of DLTs.  A rate of DLTs <33% is desirable.  The DLT 
observation window is 28 days. If less than 2 out of the first 6 subjects  would have 
experienced a DLT, then additional subjects with different tumor types could have been  
enrolled to better define the safety in the different tumor types.  If 2 subjects would have experienced a DLT, t hen an additional 6 subject s could have been enrolled and followed 
for a 28 Day DLT window.  If > 3 subjects would have experienced a DLT, the safety 
data would have been reviewed by the SSC and a lower dose of INT230-6 would have been explored.  No DLTs were observed in the phase 1 portion of the study. 
The first 6 cohorts used an intrapatient dose escalation in  the amounts noted per tables 4, 
5, 6, 7.  Dose es calation occurred  by an increase in the amount and number of tumors that 
can be injected in a single subject , or by opening new cohorts at higher total drug 
exposure.   
5.1.1. A. SUPERFICIAL TUMORS at 1:4 ratio: Dosing once per 28 days, Cohort A1  
Cohort A1 – Superficial tumors included cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors. Nodal 
tumors were included if they we re visible and palpable.  Examples of such cancers are 
melanoma, head and neck, breast, and lymphomas. A sentinel subject could have had up 
to 3 naïve, superficial tumors injected at Cycle1, Day 0, for a total of 5.0 mL  of INT230-
6.  Depending on the extent of superficial disease, it may not have been possible to inject the maximum amount for a given subject. After the sentinel subject wa s on treat ment for 
28 days (i.e., up to 3 tumors injected  on day 0 and 28 days follow up), if there we re no 
DLTs, upon agreement from the SSC, more subjects could have been enrolled into Cohort A1, and received monthly injections as per the schedule on Days 0, 28, 56, 84 and 112 (n=2-9).  Cohort A1 continued until at least 3 subjects could have had the 
opportunity to complete at least 56 days or 3 DLTs would have occurred.  If 1 DLT was  
observed in the first 3 subjects, an additional 3 subjects at this dose level could have been 
added.  If there wa s 1 more DLT in the first 6 subjects, 3 more would have been added.  
If a third dose- limiting toxicity wa s observed in any dose level, even if < 9 subje cts are 
enrolled, enrollment in that dose level would have been discontinued and a lower dose level or intermediate dose level would have been explored.  A rate of DLTs that exceeds 
33% is unacceptable for this population.  There we re no DLTs in this cohor t. 
Effort s were  made to avoid injecting INT230-6 into necrotic tissue. Redosing was  
permitted  using ultrasound guidance to ensure proper needle placement . In any subject, if 
no DLTs we re observed  after 28 days of follow up, the subject could have received

days of follow-up, the subject could have received  superficial injections into any 
superficial  tumors monthly on days 56, 84 and 112 (total of 5 cycles) .   
For each injection day, there wa s a limit to the total volume of administration, a limit on 
the maximum number of tumors (cycles 1 -2 but not cycles 3-5) that could have been 
injected , and a limit on the maximum volume that could be injected into the largest 
tumor. This information is highlighted in the following schedule ( Table 4).  Note that the 
injection volume on subsequent cycles could have declined as the tumor size changes 
over time.

5.1.2. B. DEEP TUMORS AT 1:4 ratio: Dosing once per 28 days Cohort B1   
Cohort B1 was initiated and follow ed the same schedule as  Cohort A1 , but also allow ed 
injections in deep tumors with image guidance ( Table  5 ). Deep tumors were defined as 
those that lie within the body such as in an organ and are not able to be felt by touch.  Tumors in the pancreas, liver, colon, lung and stomach are examples of deep tumors.  Note  that a sentinel subject in this cohort could have received a single injection totaling 
up to 5.0 mL into a naïve, deep tumor (subjects; n =1); if no DLTs we re observed, this 
subject  could have received injections into up to 3 deep or superficial tumors 28 days 
later. Effort s were made to avoid injecting INT230-6 into necrotic tissue.  Redosing was  
performed using CT or ultrasound guidance.  If no DLTs we re observed, the same subject 
could have received deep or superficial injections into any 5 tumors monthly on days 56, 84 and 112 (total 5 cycles) .   
After the sentinel subject was  on treatment for 28 days (i.e., up to 1 injection and 28 days 
follow up) and  upon agreement from the Study Steering  Committee (SSC), more subject s 
could have received monthly injectio ns as per the schedule on Days 0, 28, 56, 84 and 112 
(n=2).  Note that the injection volume on subsequent cycles could have declined as the tumor size changes over time.

maximum amount for a given subject.  Cohort B1 continued until at least 3 subjects had 
the opportunity to complete a t least three doses or if  3 DLTs ha d occurred.  If 1 DLT wa s 
seen in the first 3 subjects, an additional 3 subjects at this dose level could have been 
added.  If there wa s 1 more DLT in the first 6 subjects, 3 more could have been  added. If 
≥3 DLTs  were seen in up to 9 subjects, the SSC w ould have paused accrual and reviewed  
the data.  If a third DLT  was observed in any dose level in any cohort, even if < 9 patients 
were enrolled, enrollment in that dose level would have been disco ntinued and a lower 
dose level or intermediate dose level in that Cohort would have been explored.  A rate of 
DLTs that exceeds 33% is unacceptable for this population.  There were no DLTs in this cohort.

and 1:3 ratio (Cohort EC2 ) 
Cohort E C was  similar to Cohort EA  but with a higher loading dose of INT230-6 (50% 
injection to tumor volume i.e., 0.50 mL/ cm3 tumor) ( Table 7 a) and a higher total dose 
escalation . Cohort EC2 ( Table 7b)  had higher drug volumes at a lower drug loading (1:3) 
per tumor compared with EC .

into as many tumors as feasible, with the aim to treat as many visible tumors as possible 1to 3 
times during the course of the induction treatment.  After the 5 doses, subjects continue to t he 
maintenance phase where they can repeat injecting new lesions or previously injected lesions 
with up to 175mL once every 9 weeks.  Treatment should continue until patient’s tumors 
disappear (CR), confirmed progression (iCPD) or 2 years whichever is firs t.

Study Steering Committee  
The Study Steering Committee is comprised of the majority of study investigators plus 
representatives from the Sponsor.  The SSC  will review safety data regularly in an 
ongoing basis on all subject s.  Decisions to increase the number of subjects in a cohort, to 
increase the loading concentration injected into the tumors, and the decision to begin treating deep tumors will require agreement from this committee.   The SSC will review 
the data on any  sentinel subject s and facilitate the decision to recruit more subject s.   
 
Expansion Groups  
The SSC has reviewed the safety and any available biologic and/or tumor measurement 
data from phase 1, and recommended opening expansion groups of 10-16 subject s with  
single tumor types.  These groups allow for better point estimates of the safety and 
preliminary efficacy in a homogenous population of subjec ts. These groups try to 
optimize drug exposure (i.e., maximum injection volume and drug load) to facilitate the optimal tumor destruction pot ential.

Subjects who completed therapy, including treatment with or without retreatment , 
treatment with  maintenance,  or discontinued treatment for any reason other than clinical 
or radiological progression will enter the Long Term Follow up period.  S ubjects will be 
evaluated every 8 weeks  for one year (until Amendment 5), and every 9 weeks 
(Amendment 6).  During this Long Term Follow up Period, if a subject progresses or 
receives an intervening anti -cancer  therapy , the subject will then enter the Survival 
Follow up Period.   
Subjects who discontinue treatment due to clinical or radiological progression or 
Withdraw Consent from study treatment(s) will not enter Long Term Follow up, but will 
enter survival follow up as outlined below. 
5.4. Survival Follow-up Period  
Following completion of the treatment and long- term follow-up, as applicable, al l 
subjects will be followed for survival.  After that initial assessment of all study subjects, 
any surviving subjects will have their survival status assessed approximately every 3 months by either a telephone or in- person contact until study completion or termination 
by the Sponsor.  With the exception of noting the first use of subsequent anti- cancer 
therapies, n o other d ata (e.g., subsequent therapies, performance status etc.) beyond 
survival will be collected during these calls/visits.  
 
5.5. Injection Procedure  
For all injections, proper precautions to prevent bleeding will be followed per the 
institutional guidelines for anti -coagulants for this patient population. The risk of the 
procedure should be similar to a biopsy.  Greater precau tions should be taken when 
injecting deep tumors. Subjects can not be on aspirin or NSAIAs.  Anticoagulants must be 
held with proper washout period prior to injection and not re initiated until the physician 
is confident that there have been no bleeding complications from the procedure.

The minimum tumor size must be > 1.0 cm in diameter on Day 0.  An eligible superficial 
tumor is defined as one that has not been previously irradiated, and has had at least 4 
weeks to heal after any surgery or open biopsy.  Note superficial tumors that have been 
irradiated previously but have evidence of active tumor growth, can be considered.  
Superficial tumor injection: A sentinel subject with accessible and eligible superficial 
tumors in the skin, subcutaneous tissues, and/or lymph nodes will receive up to 3 IT injection s into different tumors that are considered  the most troublesome (defined as the 
largest that are without confounding factors to permit local toxicity assessment and

assessment) .  The largest tumor should be targeted first). 
After IT injections, the sentinel subject was  monitored for at least 6 hours post- injection 
with vital signs, physical exams including close examination of the injection site and 
surrounding tissues for any untoward reactions, safety labs, and adverse events (see 
Table 11 for  28 day dosing and Table 12 for 14 day dosing) .  If there we re no safety 
concerns, the subject wo uld have been discharged to return to the clinic on Day 1 for the 
same safety follow up as on Day 0.  The subjects would have be en admitted to the 
hospital for observation if deemed medically necessary.  This subject would have return ed for safety evaluations on Days 7 and 14.  On Day 14 or day  28 (cohort 
dependent) the subject was  evaluated  for additional IT injections into superficial tumors.  
If the subject had no persistent adverse events greater than Grade 2 (NCI CTCAE v 4.03) that c ould reasonably be attribut ed to the IT injection or the components of INT230-6, the 
subject  could have received repeat injections in up to 5 tumors on day 28, and on 
subsequent cycles any number tumors chosen by the investigator. 
After this first subject completed at least 28 days of follow up without persistent ≥ Grade 
3 (NCI CTCAE v 4.03) adverse events that could reasonably be attributed  to INT230-6, 
additional subjects were enrolled in this cohort.   Note: On subsequent cycles, previously injected or new tumors could have been  treated.  
Data from animals suggest re -injecting the same tumors leads to better tumor control.  
Ultimately the decision to re -inject the same tumors was  made by the treating physician. 
The total number of additional tumors that  were readily injectable were  considered.   
Ultrasound was  used for needle placement to avoid injecting areas of necrosis. 
 
Cohorts B1, E C, EC2, EC3, DEC, DEC2, FEC , GEC  
 
All Tumor Types Including Deep Tumors  
Subject s having previously identified deep tumors observed using ultrasound, CT scan, 
MRI or PET/CT technologies will be eligible for treatment of their deep tumors provided 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria are met . The procedure will be done with ultrasound- 
or CT scan -, directed IT injection into deep tumors of at least 1.0 cm in diameter.  Most 
troublesome tumors  are defined as the largest that are without confounding factors, such 
as an unclear window to approach the tumor, unclear path for the needle which avoids major structures, scarring, proximity to large vessels, large areas of necrosis,  inability to 
ascertain a local toxicity assessment.  Most troublesome tumors are causing the greatest morbidity  (acknowledging that this is a subjective assessment).  The technical feasibility 
will be assessed by an interventional radiologist during the screening process to 
determine if the subject can be treated with this approach and what the most suitable 
tumors are for injection.  The largest tumor should be targeted first with the least amount of puncture wounds. Rex Medical deep tumor injection device (QuadraFuse)  can be used 
to enable proper dispersion of the drug product throughout the different quadrants of

Injection M anual  for further information.  
After IT injections, the sentinel subject in cohort B1 (any others are to be designated by 
the SSC) w as monitored for at least 6 hours post-injection with vital signs, physical 
exams including close examination of the injection site and surrounding tissues for any untoward reactions, safety labs, and adverse e vents (see Table 12).  If there we re no 
safety concerns, the subject was  discharged to return to the clinic on Day 1 for the same 
safety follow up as on Day 0. The subject would have been admitted to the hospital for observation if deemed medically necessary.   
Subjects will return for safety evaluations on Days 7 and 14 for cohort B1 and weekly for 
all E cohorts.  On Day 14 for all E cohorts, and Day 28 for cohort B1, subjects will be 
evaluated for additional IT injections.  If the subjects have no persistent adverse events greater than Grade 2 (NCI CTCAE v 4.03) that can reasonably be  attributed  to the IT 
injection or the components of INT230-6, the subject s can receive repeat injections .  
Over the course of the induction phase, investigators should attempt, if safe, to dose as many tumors as possible at least 2 or 3 times at the proper dose as noted in Table 8.  
It is not necessary to inject each tumor on each of the 5 induction dosing sessions.  For  
subjects who received 3 injections at the proper dose (from Table 8) in a given  tumor 
prior to completion of 5 dosing sessions decisions regarding further treatment should be discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
Note: On subsequent cycles, previously injected or new tumors may be treated.  Data 
from animals suggest re- injecting the same tumors leads to better tumor control. The 
treating physician will ultimately decide which tumors will be injected, taking into 
consideration the response of the injected tumor(s) and the number of additional tumors that can be readily injected .  Ultrasound or CT guidance may  be used for needle 
placement to avoid injecting  areas of necrosis.   
 
Methodology:  
INT230- 6 will be injecte d into the periphery of the a ccessible and deep body tumors 
through the smallest and shortest gauge needle as possible to reach the entire depth of the 
tumor. For deep body tumors, ultrasonography or CT guidance at physician’s choice will 
be used to place the needle into the tumor. The needle will be moved throughout the 
tumor with a pullback technique ( distal, middle and proximal) if possible and be removed 
after each injection or when all tumors have been injected  (see Injection Manual  for more 
details) .

8.1. Investigational Product  
An investigational product, also known as investigational medicinal product in some 
regions, is defined as follows: A pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo 
being tested or used as a reference in a clinical study, including products already with a 
marketing authorization but used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way different from the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized indication, or when used 
to gain further information about the authorized form. The investigational product should 
be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that investigational product is only dispensed to study subjects. The 
investigational product must be dispensed only from official study sites by authorized 
personnel according to local regulations. In this protocol, investigational product(s) is: INT230-6, an anti- PD1 (pembrolizumab) , CTLA -4 antibody (ipilimumab) , or other drug. 
 
8.2. Non-Investigational Product  
Other medications used in the study as support or rescue medicatio n for preventative, 
diagnostic, or therapeutic reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given 
diagnosis, are considered non-investigational products.  In this protocol, non-
investigational products are local anesthesia, anti -emetics (if prescribed by the 
investigator) and sedation . 
 
8.3. Physical Description of Study Drug  
INT230-6 is supplied in a frozen single use 10 mL  or 30 mL amber vial.  Each vial 
contains: 
 Name of Active Ingredients:  
Cisplatin, (cis -diamminedichloroplatinum - CIS) 0.5mg/ mL and  
Vinblastine Sulfate (VBL) 0.1 mg/ mL 
 
Name of Important Excipients: 
Sodium 2-hydroxybenzoylaminooctanoate (SHAO) 10 mg/ mL (of free acid ). 
 
8.4. Packaging and Labeling  
The study drug will be packaged and labeled according to current good manufacturing 
practices  (GMP). Details of the packaging and labeling of clinical suppli es may be fo und 
in the Pharmacy  and Drug Product Labeling Manual . 
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
Intensity Therapeutics’ Confidential Information                                                   Page 52 of 212  
8.5. Ordering Study Drug  
Clinical supplies may be requested by completing the Clinical Supplies Request For m 
and faxing it or e- mailing the form to the Sponsor with a copy to Catalyst . 
 
8.6. Storage  
Sterile INT2 30-6 has demonstrated that when stored frozen for 2 year s at -20°C all three 
main ingredient substances comprising the drug product retain approximately ~100% of 
their T=0 concentrations upon thaw.  Long term stability studies are in process.  Confirmation  of the drug product’s stability for use beyond 24 months shall be provided 
prior to use for drug product batches older than 24 months.  
INT230-6 vials must be stored at a temperature of approximately - 20°C ( -15°C to -25 °C 
is acceptable)  and should be protected from light. Recommended safety measures for 
preparation and handling of INT230-6 include laboratory coats and gloves. After 
INT230- 6 has been removed from the freezer , the total storage time ( at room 
temperature) is not to exceed 4 hours. 
Care must be taken to assure sterility of the prepared solution as the product does not 
contain any anti- microbial preservative or bacteriostatic agent.  
The product storage manager should ensure that the study drug is stored in accordance 
with the environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity) as determined by 
the sponsor. If concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the study drug arise, do not dispense the study drug and contact the sponsor immediately.  
 
8.7. Study Drug Preparation and Administration  
INT230- 6 is to be administered as an  intratumoral injection .  Each 10 mL  or 30 mL vial 
of INT230-6 must be thawed to  room temperature prior to use.  (See Injection  and Dosing 
Manual S ection 2.1 for determining the number of vials to thaw for each subject  session 
for each cohort).  Heating of the INT230-6 vials  is not permitted .  Thaw by placing the 
vials needed for dosing on a bench at room temperature. After one hour gent ly shake the 
vials to assure that any particulates that ma y be visible go into solution.  INT230-6 must 
be dosed within 1 to 4 hours following removal from the freezer assuring that the vial is at room temperature  at time of preparation .  Injection of tumors must be performed under 
ultrasound, endoscopic or CT guidance. The extent of necrosis in the tumor should be assessed prior to re- injecting the same tumor.  
If dosing into superficial tumors, prepare a standard syringe and sufficiently sized 22 
gauge (or finer e.g. 23, 24 gauge) needle of proper length for the size of the tumor.  (See 
below for dosing deep tumors).  Remove the foil overseal from the vial and place the needle into the rubber stopper .  Draw  the appropriate drug volume for the tumor to be 
dosed into the syringe at either the 0.25 mL  per 
cm3 of tumor or 0.5 mL  per cm3 of tumor 
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
Intensity Therapeutics’ Confidential Information                                                   Page 53 of 212 ratio (depending on the cohort to be dosed).  Use a fractionating technique to assure that 
the dose of INT230-6 is administered to each quadrant of the tumor.  If known, dose into 
the proliferating portion of the tumor rather than into any necrotic areas.  Administer the entire dose throughout the tumor ( moving the needle throughout  the tumor  as outlined 
per the Injection Manual ) gently pushing the plunger.  Prior to withdrawing the needle 
from the tumor, count to 30 to assure time for the INT230-6 formulation to thoroughly diffuse throughout the tumor.   If tumor is superficial with potential for ulceration (e.g. melanoma ), please co ver with an occlusive dressing which can be removed in 48 hrs.   
For dosing into deep tumors note Sponsor shall provide a special syringe ( see PK and 
Biomarker Manual  and Injection  Manual  for further intratumoral deep tumor dosing 
information).  Note : it takes approximately 1 mL to prime the tubing for the injection 
device.  
Care must be taken to maintain the  sterility of the INT230-6 solution as the product does 
not contain any anti -microbial preservative or bacteriostatic agent s.  Do not reinsert the 
needle into the vial after the subject  has been dosed.  Use a fresh, clean  drawing needle if 
more material from the vial is to be used.  
Anti-PD1and anti CTLA4 therapy will be prepared as directed in the relevant 
Supplements 
Training videos have been prepared by the Sponsor for: 
25. Drug Preparation 
26. Dosing Superficial Tumors  
27. Deep Tumor Dosing 
It is expected that research staff who are involved in any of the above activities (drug 
preparation, labelling or dosing) view the videos and that training is documented prior to 
involvement in such activities.  
 
8.8. Drug Accountability  
Sponsor will provide the study drug supply. All study drug(s) will be supplied to the Investigator by Sponsor or its designee. Study drug supplies must be kept in an appropriate, secure locked area and stored in accordance with the conditions specified on 
the labels  (approximately -20°C). The Investigator or designated study person must 
maintain an accurate recor d of dispensing the study drug in a Drug Accountability Log, a 
copy of which must be given to Sponsor at the end of the study. The Drug Accountability Log will record the study drugs received, dosages prepared, time prepared, doses 
dispensed, and doses and/or vials destroyed. The Drug Accountability Log will be reviewed by the field monitor during site visits and at the completion of the study.

Intra subject  dose reductions for the management of toxicities are not permitted unless 
discussed  with and approved by the Sponsor M edical Monitor. 
 
8.10. Incomplete Dosing  
Depending on the technique used for injection, it is possible that a single tumor will not 
allow for the full volume of administration. Every effort should be made to deliver the 
total d ose, across the permitted number of tumors. Depending on the overall tumor 
burden this may not be possible, in which case it should be recorded in the CRF.  If the 
tumor shrinks after one or more injections, the total volume declines, less total drug can be given, this will be recorded in the CRF. 
 
8.11. Dose Delay  
Delay of up to 14 days are permitted for treating on the next cycle for safety reasons.  I f 
the delay is greater than 2 weeks, then the subject should come off study unless discussed 
with and ap proved by the medical monitor.  These delays are not intended for 
administrative type/scheduling issues due to holidays, weather, etc.  The visit windows in 
Table 10 should be used in such circumstances.  If, in the case of such delay it is beyond 
the allowed visit window, approval via a Protocol Waiver Form from Sponsor Medical Monitor should be obtained prior to the visit occurring. 
 
8.12. Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug Due to Adverse 
Events  
INT230-6 should be perm anently discontinued for a subject  due to the occurrence of 
any of the following AEs that have not resolved prior to the next treatment 
• Any CTC Grade ≥ 3 immunologic related event that persists >1week despite 
treatment per institutional guidelines  
• CTC Grade 4 neutropenia > 7 days or neutropenic fever 
• Persistent ≥  CTC Grade 3 anemia despite growth factor support 
• Platelets < 70,000 for superficial tumors, <100, 000 for deep tumors  
• ≥ CTC Grade 3 elevation in liver enzymes  
• ≥ CTC G rade 4 neuropathy 
• Creatinine >1.5mg/dl 
• Any anaphylactic type reactions 
• ≥ Grade 3 nausea or vomiting that persists despite maximal supportive care

of the Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the subject with continued treatment 
 
8.13. Destruction of Study Drug  
If study drugs (those supplied by the sponsor or sourced by the investigator) are to be destroyed on site, it is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure the destruction of drug is 
according to applicable regulations, guidelines and institutional procedures. Appropriate 
records of the disposal must be maintained  at all times.  The unused study drugs can only 
be destroyed after being inspected and reconciled by the responsible Sponsor Study Monitor. 
 
8.14. Return of Study Drug 
Study drug will not be returned. All unused and/or partially used study drug may be 
destroyed on site providing the site has an applicable standard operating procedure on 
file.

9.1. Dose Escalation   
Cohorts A1, B1, EA, EC, EC2, DEC escalated doses.  Cohorts EC3, DEC2, FEC start out 
with a fixed total dose for each treatment session. For doses within Cohorts EC3, DEC2, 
FEC, investigators may decide to treat certain tumors on one visit and then treat 
additional tumors on subsequent visits that may involve an increase of INT230-6 dose 
given.  This section describes the management of the potential toxicities . 
9.1.1. Dose -limiting Toxicity  
A DLT is defined as a > Grade 3 study drug- related adverse event (using NCI CTCAE 
Version 4.03) occurring during the first dose (DLT window extends up to 28 days after dosing), excluding: 
• Grade 3 adverse event of tumor injection reaction (defined as local pain, 
irritation, or rash localiz ed at sites of known or suspected tumor) that resolves 
with s upportive care measures within 48 hours 
• Grade 3 or 4 nausea or vomiting that is adequately treated with supportive care and that resolve within one to two days 
• Any bleeding that is self -limiting  from  or near  the site of injection and  
resolves within 24 hours with non-invasive measures and without the need for 
transfusion 
• Grade 3 or 4 electrolyte abnormalities that correct to below grade 3 with 
standard measures within 48 hours 
A DLT will be considered related to study drug unless the re is a clear, well -documented, 
alternative explanation for the toxicity. Delayed DLTs are adverse events that meet the 
criteria of DLTs that occur after Cycle 1.  If >1 member of a cohort should have a DLT 
for Doses 2 - 5, then the SSC will determine how accrual shall proceed for that cohort. 
 
Intrasubject  dose escalation  
Any events of > Grade 3 that are considered study drug- related after cycle 1  for a subject  
will be reviewed by the SSC to assess if alterations in dosing levels and or frequency are 
needed  for that subject .  If more than one member of a cohort should have a > G rade 3 
event for cycles 2 to 5, then the SSC will determine how accrual should proceed for that 
cohort. 
All adverse events that meet DLT  criteria  must be reported to the pharmacovigilance 
services vendor ( ProPharma) within  24 hours of the study site being made aware of the 
event using the rapid notification procedures described in Section  13.3.2. 
9.1.2. Stopping Rules for Dose -limiting Toxicity During Dose Escalation

Intensity Therapeutics’ Confidential Information                                                   Page 57 of 212 the MTD.  At the time a third DLT  is observed in any dose level in any cohort, even if < 9 
subjec ts are enrolled, enrollment in that dose level will be discontinued and a lower dose 
level or intermediate dose level in that Cohort will be explored .  Any d elayed DLTs will 
be evaluated on a case- by-case basis.  The SSC will provide additional oversight and will 
be reviewing safety on an ongoing basis and may make adjustments to this criterion 
based on the data. 
Subjects who are tolerating a study drug dose level that is being reviewed due to DLTs 
that occurred in other subjects will not be automatically precluded from continued dosing 
during this safety review and  will be allowed to continue dosing for as long as it is 
tolerated unless the safety review mandates dose reduction. After safety analysis by the 
Investigators and Sponsor (with FD A and IRB notification), a decision will be made 
whether to resume enrollment and continue dosing at the current dose or initiate a new 
cohort of subjects at a lower INT230-6 dose.  
 
9.2. Possible Toxicities  
Based on the safety experience in the first  70 patients, the most common treatment 
associated adverse event is injection site pain.  Other constitutional adverse events 
(nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite and anorexia) have also been reported.   
Additional theoretical toxicities that could be affect ed by INT230 -6, which may or may 
not be increased with the combination of immune activating agents, such as hematologic, 
cardiovascular,  hepatic, musculoskeletal, and other systems, and may include the 
following: 
• Allergic reaction/hypersensitivity: Fever, c hills, shakes, itching, rash, hyper- 
or hypotension, and difficulty breathing. It is likely that most injection -related 
adverse events will  occur within the first 24 hours after the injection and may 
be treated by supportive treatment as indicated.  
• Injection procedure:  Pain during and after the injection, bleeding, infection, 
tumor ulceration  and edema.  The needle utilized for this is the same or smaller 
size than what is typically used for a biopsy.  All attempts at using a single injection point for each tumor are suggested.  Additionally , injecti on volumes 
of liquid into the tumor should provide some back pressure to help reduce the 
potential for bleeding.  The Quadrafuse device has been used for injection of deep tumors and has a low rate of hemorrhage as a complication.   
• Other potential adverse effects of INT230-6: Fatigue, anemia, leukopenia, hyponatremia, other laboratory abnormalities (including increases in gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransfer ase (ALT), lipase, creatinine), nausea or vomiting, decreased 
appetite, weight loss, muscle aches, chills, dizziness, and urinary retention. 
• Adverse effects associated with IV Cisplatin and Vinblastine are less likely given the dose used in this study: Renal damage, visual disturbances, hearing loss/tinitis, peripheral neuropathy, sensory loss/numbness, tingling, areflexia

alopecia, thrombocytopenia, other blood abnormalities (low magnesium, 
calcium, potassium), bleeding, dark urine, chest pain or heart attack, sweating, depression, muscle cramps, pain including headaches. 
• Extravasations: There are no reports of simultaneous extravasations of CIS and VBL so guidance on countermeasures does not exist.  Also watch closely for any toxicities when given intradermally for skin tumors. 
 
9.2.1. Management of select AEs  
The following table describes potential AEs and the management suggestions for 
INT230-6.  The investigator should use good medical judgement in determining the optimal care for his or her subjects. 
Table 9: Dose Modification and Toxicit y Management Guidelines for AEs 
Associated with INT230-6 using CTCAEv4.03  
General instructions: 
1. For situations where INT230-6 has been withheld, INT230-6 can be resumed 
after AE has been reduced to baseline or Grade 1  
2. For severe and life-threatening AEs, INT230-6 should be permanently discontinued 
AEs Action taken to INT230 -6 AE management  Monitor and follow -up  
Allergic reaction or 
hypersensitivity  Hold drug if Grade > 3 Follow the package insert for CIS and VBL,  these AEs 
usually can be managed with by administration of epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines.   
 You may consider a rechallenge with INT230 -6 if 
grade <2 and  resolves with 
minimal treatment.   
Typical cytotoxic effects 
including fatigue, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, 
decreased appetite
 Hold drug if Grade > 3  Supportive care as per 
institutional guidelines  Consider using anti -emetic 
premedication  on next 
INT230 -6 dose  
Local reactions  Hold drug if Grade > 3  apply heat packs, subcutaneous hyaluronidase
 Consider prophylactic 
antihistamines and low dose 
corticosteroids on next 
INT230 -6 dose  
Injection pain  Hold drug if Grade > 3  Pain control medications as 
prophylaxis and for 
treatment as per institutional standard
 Consider prophylactic pain 
medication prior to 
subsequent injections . If 
Grade 3 or higher, do not increase INT230 -6 dose
 
9.3. Stopping Rules for Clinical Deterioration  
Accumulating evidence indicates that the emergence of objective responses to agents that  
activate anti -tumor immune responses follows delayed kinetics  of weeks or months, and 
can be preceded by initial apparent radiological progression, or appearance of new 
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
Intensity Therapeutics’ Confidential Information                                                   Page 59 of 212 tumors or some enlarging tumors while certain target tumors are regressing (“mixed  
response”). It is thus reasonable to allow for these pos sibilities and continue to treat the 
subject until progression is confirmed and found to be advancing and continuing at the 
next imaging assessment. These considerations should be balanced by clinical judgment 
as to whether the subject is clinically deteriorating and unlikely to receive any benefit 
from continued treatment. Such deterioration will be assessed to have occurred after a clinical event that, in the Investigator’s opinion, is attributable to disease progression, is 
unlikely to reverse with continued study treatment and therefore indicates that the subject 
is not benefiting from study treatment and cannot be managed by the addition of supportive care (such as bisphosphonates and/or bone directed radiotherapy, thoracentesis 
or paracentesis of accum ulating effusions). The decision to continue or stop treatment 
should be discussed with the Sponsor Medical Monitor and will be documented in the 
study records. 
Examples of events that may, in the Investigator’s opinion, indi cate a lack of clinical 
benefit include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• Performance status decrease of at least 2 points from baseline 
• Skeletal related events defined by the following: 
− Pathologic bone fracture in the region of cancer involvement 
− Cancer related to bone surgery  
− Spinal cord or nerve root compression 
• Bladder outlet or urethral  obstruction 
• Development of new central nervous system (CNS) metastases  
• Subjects that develop new CNS metastases in the setting of improving 
baseline disease may have focal radiation, resection, or other local curative procedures performed after consultation with the Medical Monitor. 
If continued study therapy is deemed to offer the subject potential benefit, subjects may be allowed to restart study therapy after recovery from symptoms related to the procedure performed (i.e., local edema) and steroid dosing at < 10 mg prednisone/day or equivalent, after recovery to baseline or grade 1 . 
Subjects that have locally curative procedures while on study drug and subsequently develop new CNS metastases at a subsequent imaging assessment should discontinue study therapy and enter the follow-up period. 
Any setting where the initiation of new anti- neoplastic therapy has been deemed 
beneficial to the subject even in the absence of any such documented clinical events.

The Investigator or their designated study personnel will maintain a log of all study drugs 
received, dispensed, destroyed, and returned. Drug supplies will be inventoried and 
accounted for throughout the study.  
The Investigator and the study personnel will ensure that each subject receives the calculated dose of the study drug based on tumor volume, as in section 5.2.

All medications taken within 14 days before the administration of study drug and all 
concomitant therapy administered during the study will be recorded on the relevant case 
report form (CRF ), along with the reason for therapy use. 
1. The use of local anesthesia and / or sedatives as well as anti -emetics to facilitate the 
injection procedure is permitted . 
2. Inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption) may be continued if the subject is on a stable dose. Non-absorbed intra- articular steroid injections 
will b e permitted. Systemic corticosteroids required for the control of injection reactions 
must be tapered and be at non-immunosuppressive doses (< 10 mg/day of prednisone or 
equivalent) for at least 2 weeks before the next study drug administration. The use of 
steroids as prophylactic treatment for subjects with contrast allergies to diagnostic 
imaging contrast dyes will be permitted  (other cases can be discussed with the medical 
monitor to allow higher doses for clear medical indications). 
3. Use of new herbal remedies, other marketed anti -cancer chemo/immunotherapy drugs, or 
investigational drugs (drugs not marketed for any indication) is not permitted. 
4. New chemotherapy or immunotherapy is not permitted. 
5. Palliative/therapeutic therapies (e.g., focal radiotherapy for pain, thoracocentesis or paracentesis for comfort) may be administered after consultation with the Medical Monitor. Palliative radiation will not be delivered to injected tumor sites while on study . 
6. Various growth factors are permitted as per ASCO guidelines after the 28 day DLT window. 
7. The use of live vaccines while on study is prohibited. The use of any killed or attenuated 
vaccines for the prevention of influenza is permitted at any time without a study drug 
washout interval. The use of other killed or attenuated  vaccines for the prevention of 
infectious diseases may be permitted on a case-by- case basis  and must be discussed with 
the medical monitor prior to its use. A washout interval prior to and post vaccination may be required in these instances. Any vaccinations administered while on study must be documented in the subject’s medical records and recorded in the CRF . 
All subjects should be maintained on the same concomitant m edications 
throughout the study period, as medically feasible.  Any new concomitant 
medication s prescribed for the subject or changes to dosing/schedule of 
concomitant medications should be recorded on the appropriate CRF page. The addition of a new concomitant medication for which there is a concern that it may not be permitted should be first reviewed with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. 
8. No concomitant medication information will be collected following subject discontinuation from the study except for concomitant medication use associated with study drug- related adverse events or adverse events that lead to discontinuation from 
study and start of next anti- cancer therapy . Additional information for combination arms 
can be found in the appropriate supplements.

12.1. Study Procedures by Visit  
12.1.1. Overview  
The study is divided into periods (Screening, Treatment, Long Term Follow-up and 
Survival Follow up) with associated evaluations and procedures that must be performed 
at specific time points. The Time and Events Schedules Table 10, Ta ble 11  ( every 28 
day dosing)  and Table 12  (every 14 day dosing cohorts ) summarize  the frequency and 
timing of efficacy, safety, and other study me asurements.  
As soon as the subject is considered for this study and before performing any study 
procedures, the subject will have the study explained to him/her and will be asked to give written informed consent and HIPAA authorization. Informed consent/HIPAA 
authorization must be obtained before any procedures that do not form a par t of th e 
subject’s normal standard of care. Baseline imaging (within 28 days) and ECG as part of 
the subject’s previous routine care ( performed  within  14 days) of first dose  need not be 
repeated.  
All subjects (withdrawn or completed) should have final evaluations and procedures 
performed.  
12.1.2. Screening Period

The Treatment Period of the study is divided into 28 day cycles with associated evaluations and 
procedures that must be performed at specific time points ( see Table 11)  every 28 day dosing and 
Table 12 every 14 day dosing). Subjects who meet selection criteria may start INT230 -6 
treatment within 28 days of screening. Subjects will receive injections of INT230-6 every  14 or 
28 days based on their Cohort assignment.  INT230 -6 will also be dosed every 9 weeks +/- 10 
days in the cohorts specifying maintenance dosing (EC3, DEC2, FEC and potentially GEC).  
Results of assessments must be reviewed before administering the next dose. The maximum 
duration of study therapy to be administered to an individual subject in this study is 2 years (up 
to maximum of 4 months of initial treatment plus maintenance therapies for certain cohorts  as 
well as Follow up and Survival Follow up).  
Every effort should be made to schedule visits within the protocol-specified windows. For injection delays (i.e., by 1 to 13 days) or missed doses, see Section  8.11 for administration 
details. A subject who is withdrawn from the study before the completion of the first cycle for a 
reason other than a DLT will be replaced.  
12.1.3.1. Cycle 1  
A cycle is defined as 28 days. Dose 1 (Cycle 1 Day 0) 1 will begin with the first IT  injection of 
INT230-6 (Day 0) and will continue through to completion of evaluations by Day 28. For 
cohorts A1 and  B1 subjects will be dosed ev ery 28 days for a total of 5 cycl es (Days 0, 28, 56, 84 
and 112) with a response assessment every 2 months for the first year and then every 3 months 
until progression. In "E" Cohorts, subjects will be dosed every 14 days  for a total of 3 cycles 
(Days 0, 14, 28, 42, and 56). 
During Cycle 1 Day 0 , the following evaluations will be performed as indicated in Table 11 for 
28 day dosing and in Table 12 for 14 day dosing.  Results will be recorded on the CRF: 
• Physical Exam: A full physical Exam will be performed on Day 0.  A Targeted 
physical examination (including measurement of vital signs as well as pulmonary, 
heart, abdomen, and skin assessments) will be conducted at  all subsequent visits;  
• Vital sign measurements to include temperature,  pulse, O
2 saturation and resting 
blood pressure as defined in the Time and Events Schedule ( Table 11 for every 28 
day dosing and  Table 12 for every 14 day dosing) .  Vital signs will be obtained before 
injection and then 15, 30, 60 post injection.  In addition,180 and 360 minutes post injection  vital signs are collected at C1D0.

Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
  Page 75 of 212 
Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information 12.1.4. Follow- up Period  
Follow- up visits will be conducted after completio n of the Treatment Period (induction and maintenance for 
those cohorts with maintenance treatment) or as indicated in Section  5.4.  Patients who receive all 5 
treatment doses or discontinue treatment for any reason except Disease Progression, or Withdrawal of 
consent should enter Long Term Follow up Period.  These patients are to be evaluated every 9 weeks 
including scans until disease progression or they receive an intervening anti-cancer  medication.  After 
documented disease progression or receipt of an intervening anti -cancer  medication, patients will enter 
Survival Follow up.  During this time, patients will be contacted every 3 months for patient status (phone call or clinic visit).  For subjects who discontinue treatment due to progression, follow-up should be completed 
approximately every 3 months as noted below (survival follow up). Completion of subsequent follow-up visits will depend on the status of the subject at the end of treatment. A ll subjects will be followed from the 
last visit until progression, initiation of a  new therapy, or the duration of the study (4 years) , whichever 
occurs first.  
Following completion of the treatment and follow-up periods, al l subjects will be followed for survival after 
completion of treatment phases and through the follow up period of the protocol.  Subjects will have their survival status assessed approximately every 3 months by either a telephone, in -person contact, or chart 
review  until study completion or termination by the Sponsor.  No other data (e.g ., subsequent therapies, 
performance status etc.) beyond survival will be collected during these calls/vi sits. 
12.1.5. Study Participation 
Each subject will have their study participation documented, including the number of cycles completed, the duration of the Follow-up Period, and if discontinuing from the study, the reason for discontinuation.  At the end of each cycle, the subject continuation status for each subject will be documented on the CRF. 
If for any reason, either study treatment or observations were discontinued, the reason will be recorded.  The 
primary reasons for discontinuation will be documented: 
• Adverse event(s)  
• Protocol violation 
• Disease progression  (clinical or radiological)  
• Subject withdrew consent 
• Subject is lost to follow -up 
• Death  
• Other  
Subjects who discontinue from the study should be followed until resolution and/or stabilization of any adverse event.  All subjects who discontinue from the study should complete Follow-up Visits to be 
monitored for 28 days following the last dose of INT230-6 for the occurrence of study drug- related adverse 
events or other clinically significant adverse event.  Subjects who are unable to complete the follow-up visits should be contacted at least once within 28 days following the last dose INT230-6. 
 
   
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
  Page 76 of 212 
Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information 12.1.6. Discontinuation of Subjects from Treatment  
Subjects MUST discontinue investigational product (and non-investigational product at the discretion of the 
investigator) for any of the following reasons: 
• Withdrawal of informed consent (subject’s decision to withdraw for any reason) 
• Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness which, in the opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the best interest of the subject  
• Pregnancy  
• Termination of the study by Sponsor 
• Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily incarceration 
• for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical ( e.g., infectious disease) illness  
• Inability to comply with protocol 
• Discretion of the investigator  
• Disease progression or clinical deterioration as defined in Section  9.3   
• Dosing delays greater than the maximum allowed dosing delays as defined in Section  8.11.  All 
subjects who discontinue should comply with protocol specified follow-up procedures as outlined in Section  12.1.4.  The only exception to this requirement is when a subject withdraws consent for 
all study procedures or loses the ability to consent freely (i.e., is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either a psychiatric or ph ysical illness).  
12.1.7. Safety Evaluations 
The following evaluations will be performed during the study to measure the safety and tolerability of 
INT230- 6: clinical laboratory tests (blood and urine sampling for clinical laboratory parameters  see below ), 
pregnancy testing, EC OG performance status, physical examinations including vital sign measurements, 
ECG, an d the incidence and severity of treatment- emergent adverse events.  
Hematology 
Hematology analyses will consist of the following tests:  
Hemoglobin Mean cell volume  
Hematocrit  Mean cell hemoglobin 
Red blood cell count Mean cell hemoglobin concentration 
 
Platelet count  White blood cell count (total and differential) 
Coagulation; PT, PTT /aPTT, INR  
 Clinical Chemistry  
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
  Page 77 of 212 
Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information Clinical chemistry analyses will consist of the following tests:  
Alanine aminotransferase Creatine phosphokinase Phosphorus 
Albumin  Creatinine  Potassium 
Alkaline phosphatase Gamma -glutamyl 
transpeptidase  
Glucose  
Lactate dehydrogenase  Sodium 
Aspartate aminotransferase 
Amylase  Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Total bilirubin  
Bicarbonate  Lipase  Total protein  
Calcium   Triglycerides  
Chloride Low density lipoprotein Urea (or blood urea nitrogen) 
Cholesterol (total)  Magnesium Uric acid  
Urinalysis  
Urinalysis with microscopic analysis will be performed by the clinical laboratory. Analytes will include: pH, 
glucose, ketones, blood, and protein.  If abnormalities are noted on any of the dipstick results, microscopic 
analysis will be performed. 
12.2. Efficacy Evaluations 
 
Measured qualitatively (present only at screening), absent, progression, stable, and unevaluable. 
12.2.1. Primary Efficacy Param eter 
The primary efficacy parameter is disease control rate ( CR + PR  + SD) , as assessed usin g iRECIST  
(Appendix 1 Section  18.1).  Per i RECIST criteria, up to 5 target tumors are identified at baseline and 
followed., In this study, a target tumor is a single injected tumor identified at baseline or post baseline, and 
up to 10 target tumors will be followed.  Please refer to the Statistical Analysis Plan for tumor definitions.  
Subject to PI discretion , cohorts EC3, DEC2, FEC and potentially GEC  may  have any number of tumors 
injected during a given session.  Record as many tumor measurement s in the CRF  as possible.   
Evaluation of individual injected tumors will take place at every  visit, with overall response (Complete, 
Partial, Stable, Progressive, Not E valuable) adjudicated for each.  ITR calculation  could include original 
target tumors, bystander tumors that become injected, and new measurable lesions that are injected.   
12.2.2. Additional Efficacy parameter s 
An a dditional efficacy parameter is the injected  tumor response (ITR) and bystander tumor response (BTR) 
rate, defined as either  the number of injected or  non- injected bystander tumors with confirmed CR or PR, 
divided by the total number of injected or bystander tumors identified at baseline.  Tumor response status 
will be assessed using i REC IST response categories for tumors that  have not been injected (as detailed in  
Section  18.1).  Up to 9 bystander tumors will be identified at baseline and followed.  Evaluation of individual 
bystander tumors will take place at every visit, with overall response (Complete, Partial, Sta ble, Progressive, 
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
  Page 78 of 212 
Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information Not evaluable) adjudicated for each.  BTR calculation will only include bystander tumors that are not 
injected at that visit.   
An exploratory analysis will combine all efficacy measures (injected and bystander ) to calculate an overall 
response rate (ORR)  using i RECIST criteria , with the modification to allow more than 5 target tumors in the 
calculation of sum of diameters . The ORR will be based on the number of subjects with confirmed CR or 
PR, divided by the total number of subjects with measurable disease at baseline.   
 
12.2.3. Exploratory Biomarkers of Immune Response 
Additional sample collections efficacy may be performed to m easure the impact of INT230 -6 upon the 
potency of the immune response and evaluate biomarkers that may ultimately be associated with beneficial 
clinical responses  (refer to PK and Biomarker Manual  for additional information on biopsies). 
Samples (including serum and PBMCs) for evaluation of cytokines, lymphocyte phenotype (by flow cytometry), quantitative immunoglobulins, disease-related biomarkers (or antibody responses to selected antigens), cellular immune responses to tumor antigens, and a panel of recall non-tumor antigens may be assessed.  
Available slides and tissue samples from tumor biopsies collected before enrollment in this study may also be examined for tumor markers and inflammatory infiltrates.  
Readily accessible tissue from the research -related biopsies will be collected at baseline and then on study 
(refer to PK and Biomarker  Manual  for additional information).  Tissue samples from these tumor biopsies, 
as well as from any other clinically indicated and consented biopsies conducted during the study will be 
collected, to assess morphology and the presence or absence of inflammatory infiltrates, and their cellular 
characterization.  
Additional sample collections and analyses may be performed at selected study sites with a site -specific 
amendment.  All samples collected for these exploratory analyses will be stored and may be used for subsequent research relevant to tumor immune response. 
Blood biomarkers collections have been eliminated in Amendment 6. The following table is a summary of the samples to be collected.

to PK and Biomarker Manual for additional information).  Safety of biopsying to be reviewed after 5 subject s by SSC.  As of this 
amendment, safety has been demonstrated, and all subjects will have tumor biopsies.  
 
12.3. Pharmacokinetic Evaluations  
12.3.1. Sample Collection Volumes and Timepoints  
PK sampling has been discontinued in Amendment 6.  The SSC has eliminated dose escalation in 
Amendment 5.  Most recent PK data shows that only 5% of the active ingredients for a given dose are present in the blood and the concentrations show a meaningful dose response.  As a result, the SSC 
determined that PK sample collection is no longer necessary in Amendment 6.  A final PK analysis section 
will be included in the final clinical study report.    
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6

Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information 13. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
Clinical adverse events occurring after signing informed consent/HIPAA authorization, but before study drug 
administration are to be recorded on the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions CRF. 
 
13.1. Definitions  
An adverse event is any undesirable sign, symptom, clinically significant laboratory abnormality, or medical condition occurring after starting study treatment, even if the event is not considered to be study drug- related. 
Each adverse event is to be reported on an Adverse Event CRF page.  Adverse events are graded using the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) CTCAE, Version 4.03.  If CTCAE grading does not exist for 
an adverse event, the severity of mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), life-threatening (4), and death related to 
an adverse event (5) will be used. Information about all adverse events, whether volunteered by the subject, 
discovered by Investigator questioning, or detected through physical examination, laboratory testing, or other means, will be collected , and recorded on the Adve rse Event CRF page and followed as  appropriate. Adverse 
event monitoring should be continued until adverse event resolution/stabilization (whichever is later).  
Medical conditions/diseases present before the injection  of study drug are only considered adve rse events if 
they worsen after receiving any study drug.  Clinical events occurring before the administration of study drug 
but after signing the ICF and providing HIPAA authorization are to be recorded on the Medical 
History/Current Medical Conditions CRF page.  All laboratory values are to be reviewed by the Investigator and abnormal values will be graded according to CTCAE Version 4.03 and reported in the study report. 
A laboratory abnormality is considered an adverse event if it results in: 
• discontinuation from study drug, 
• necessitates therapeutic medical int ervention, 
• if the Investigator assesses the abnormality as an adverse event, or 
• any laboratory test that is clinically significant or meets the definition of a SAE  
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical, rather than the laboratory term would be used by the 
reporting investigator ( e.g., anemia versus low hemoglobin value).  These adverse events will be recorded on 
the Adverse Events CRF page and will include all signs, symptoms, or diagnosis associated with them.  
As far as possible, each adverse event will also be described by: 
1. Description  
2. Duration (start and end dates) 
3. CTCAE Grade 1 through 5 or severity if CTCAE is not available 
4. Relationship to the study drug - related or not related  
5. Relationship to the dosing procedure – related or not related  
6. Action(s) taken with study drug 
7. Whether event was serious  
8. Whether event is ongoing (i.e., not resolved). 
 
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
  Page 81 of 212 
Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship of each adverse event to study drug will be defined as “not related” or “related”.  The 
Investigator is responsible for determining the study drug relationship for each adverse event that occurs during the study.  Assessments are to be recorded on the appropriate CRF page.  
 
Not related  
The temporal relationship of the clinical event to study drug administration makes a causal relationship 
unlikely, or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation 
for the observed event. 
 Related  
The temporal relationship of the clinical event to study drug administration makes a causal relationship 
possible, and other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
 
Action(s) Taken  
The actions taken with study drug in response to an a dverse event are described.  One or more of these are to 
be selected:  
− No action taken  
− Study drug permanently discontinued due to this adverse event 
− Study drug temporarily interrupted 
− Study drug dosage adjusted 
13.1.1. Safety Reporting for Adverse Events  
All adverse events or other clinically relevant adverse events occurring up to 28 days after administration of 
the last dose of study drug will be collected for subjects continuing in the study. For subjects who discontinue from the study within 28 days af ter the administration of the last dose of study 
drug: 
• Study drug-related adverse event information will be collected and should be followed to 
resolution/stabilization  
• Adverse events that lead to the discontinuation should be followed to resolution/stabil ization  
• A telephone contact for the safety update would be acceptable if the subject cannot manage an 
office visit 
• Only study drug- related serious or other clinically significant adverse events will be collected for 
all subjects > 28 days after the administration of the last dose of study drug. 
 
A nonserious adverse event  is an AE not classified as serious. 
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
  Page 82 of 212 
Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information  
The collection of nonserious AE information should begin at initiation of study drug (day 0) and should 
conclude 28 days after last dose of study drug.  Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they become serious (see Section  13.2).  Follow-up is also required for 
nonserious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of study drug, or those that are present at the end of study treatment as appropriate.  All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious AE page of the CRF . 
 
13.2. Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is defined in general as an untoward (unfavorable) adverse event which: 
1. is fatal or life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe);  
2. requires or prolongs hospitalization; 
3. is significantly or permanently disabling or incapacitating; 
4. constitutes a congenital anomaly or a birth defect; or  
5. may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  (Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization .) 
 
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (e.g. any organism, virus or infectious particle, pathogenic or 
non-pathogenic) via the study drug is a SAE. 
Although pregnancy, overdose (greater than 50% more than the intended dose) and cancer are not always 
serious by regulatory definition, these events must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours (See 
Section  13.5 for reporting pregnancies) . 
NOTE : Progressive disease is not considered a SAE. 
The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs in Sponsor clinical studies: 
• a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not result in admission (unless considered "important medical event" or event life threaten ing) 
• elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent 
• admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure 
• routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (e.g. routine colonoscopy) 
• medical/surgical adm ission for purpose other than remedying ill health state and was planned 
prior to entry into the study.  Appropriate documentation is required in these cases . 
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
  Page 83 of 212 
Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information • admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status and 
requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of housing, economic inadequacy, care- giver 
respite, family circumstances, administrative).  
• Hospitalizations occurring under the following circumstances are not considered serious adverse events: admiss ion to a hospice for respite care; hospitalizations planned before entry into the 
clinical study; hospitalization for elective treatment of a condition unrelated to the studied indication or its treatment; hospitalization on an emergency, outpatient basis that does not result 
in admission (unless fulfilling the criteria above); hospitalization as part of the normal treatment 
or monitoring of the studied indication; or hospitalization to facilitate the work up of a Grade 1 adverse event, including overnight hospitalization following study drug administration for 
nonmedical reasons. 
 
13.3. Rapid Notification of Serious Adverse Events  
13.3.1. Reporting R esponsibility  
Any serious adverse event occurring in a subject after he/she has provided informed consent and HIPAA 
authorization, and while receiving study treatment; or during the 28 days following study drug 
administration; or within 28 days of the last visit for screen failures must be reported. 
The timeframe for reporting after discontinuation of study drug may be extended if there is a strong 
suspicion that the study drug has not yet been eliminated or the pharmacodynamic effects of the study drug 
persist beyond 28 days.  All serious adverse events must also be reported for the timeframe in which the study drug interferes with the standard medica l treatment given to a subject.  
The investigator should collect any SAE occurring after these time periods that is believed to be related to study drug or protocol- specified procedure.  A SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt 
exists regarding its status of seriousness.  
If the investigator believes that a SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy, or a complication of a study procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form. 
Each serious adverse event must be reported by the Investigator to Propharma (SAE Reporting FAX 919-
844-6948), or designee, within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence, even if it is not felt be related to study drug. Serious adverse events occurring after 28 days from the last dose of INT230-6 must be reported if 
deemed related to  study drug.  The report must include the adverse event term, subject identifier, attribution, 
description, concomitant medication used to treat the adverse event, and any other relevant information.  
Follow-up information about a previously reported serious adverse event must also be reported to Sponsor 
within 24 hours of receiving the information.  Sponsor, or its designee, may contact the Investigator to obtain 
further information about a reported serious adverse event.  If warranted, an Investigator Alert may be issued 
to inform all Investigators involved in any study with the same study drug that a serious adverse event has been reported.  
13.3.2. Reporting Procedures  
The Investigator must complete the Serious Adverse Event Report F orm in English, assess the causal 
relationship to study drug, and send the completed form to the SAE Reporting FAX Number  (919-844-
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
  Page 84 of 212 
Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information 6948) within 24 hours, to Sponsor or its designee.  The study monitor will review the Serious Adverse Event 
Report Form and the supporting source documents during monitoring visits. 
Follow-up information should be sent to the same SAE  Reporting Fax Number tha t received the original 
Serious Adverse Event Form, within 24 hours of the time the information is known.  Either a new Serious 
Adverse Event Report Form is faxed (indicating that the information is a follow-up), or the original form 
may be re -faxed (with the new information highlighted and a new date provided).  The follow- up report 
should describe whether the serious adverse event has resolved or is continuing, if and how it was treated, 
and whether the s ubject continued or permanently discontinued study participation.  The form(s) and FAX 
confirmation sheet(s) must be retained in the investigational site study file.  
The Investigator is responsible for informing the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee /Review Ethics Board  (IRB/IEC/REB ) of the serious adverse event and providing them with all 
relevant initial and follow-up information about the event.  Sponsor or designee will communicate serious 
adverse events to the study sites as required by regulatory authorities. 
SAEs must be recorded on the Sponsor SAE Report Form; pregn ancies on a Sponsor Pregnancy Surveillance 
Form.  These original Sponsor Forms are to remain on site.  SAEs, whether related or not related to study 
drug, and pregnancies must be reported to Sponsor within 24 hours via confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission, or scanned and reported via electronic mail to: 
 
SAE Email Address:  clinicalsafety@propharmagroup.com 
SAE Facsimile Number: 919-844-6948 
 
If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required.  (Note: Follow -up SAE 
reports should include the same investigat or term(s) initially reported.)  If an ongoing SAE changes in its 
intensity  or relationship to study drug or if new information becomes available, a follow -up SAE report 
should be sent within 24 hours to the Sponsor using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE 
report.   
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization . 
 
13.4. Overdose  
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional injection  of any excessive dose of INT230-6 ( for this 
study it is defined as > 50% o f the intended dose).  
Any overdose must be recorded in the trial medication section of the CRF.  In the event of overdose of INT230-6, 
subjects should receive appropriate advice and supportive medical care by the investigator or his/her designee and be followed-up accordingly.  For monitoring purposes, any case of overdose – whether or not associated with an AE (serious or non-serious) – must be reported to the Sponsor in an expedited manner.
 
 
13.5. Pregnancy  
Pregnancy testing must be performed in all women of childbearing potential throughout the study as 
specified in the Time and Event Schedule table, and the results of all pregnancy tests (positive or negative) 
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
  Page 85 of 212 
Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information are to be recorded on the CRF.  All women  of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy  test 
before each  INT230-6 injection .  If the pregnancy test is positive, the subject must not receive INT230-6 and 
must not continue in the study.  The subj ect will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. 
Females of non -childbearing potential are defined as females with functioning ovaries with a documented 
history of tubal ligation or hysterectomy or females who are post-menopausal, as defined by 12 months of 
spontaneous amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile, e.g., age appropriate , > 45 years, in the absence 
of hormone replacement therapy.  In questionable cases, a blood sample for follicle stimulating hormone and estradiol will be obtained to confirm childbearing potential.  
In addition, all women of childbearing potential should be instructed to contact the Investigator immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period) at any time during the study Treatment Period part of the study or during the 60-day period following their last dose of study drug. 
Male subjects should contact the Investigator immediately if they suspect they may have fathered a child 
during the study Treatment Period part of the study or during the 180-day period following their last dose of study drug.  When possible, partner’s pregnancies should be followed (to term) to determine the outcome. 
13.5.1. Reporting of Pregnancy 
If, following initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequently discovered that a study subject or a 
female partner of a male study participant is p regnant or may have been pregnant at the time of 
investigational product exposure, including during at least 6 half-lives after product administration, the investigational product will be permanently discontinued for the female study participant in an appr opriate 
manner.  Protocol required procedures for study discontinuation and follow-up must be performed on the 
subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy (e.g. x-ray studies).  Other appropriate pregnancy follow-up 
procedures should be considered if indicated.  
Pregnancies should be reported to Propharma but will not be considered as SAEs.  They will be 
tracked to determine the final outcome of the fetus.  Propharma  Pregnancy Questionnaire and 
Outcome forms will be used for this function.  If the pregnancy ends in an unfavorable manner (i.e., 
miscarriage, birth defect, etc.), the investigator is responsible for determining if the outcome met SAE criteria.  
Follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.  Infants should be followed for a minimum of 8 weeks. 
 
13.6. Other Safety Considerations  
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations,  electrocardiograms, x -rays, 
and any other potential safety assessments, whether or not these procedures are required by the protocol, 
should also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.

Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information 14. STAT ISTICAL METHODS  
14.1. Sample Size Determination  
The sample size (estimated to be between 100 and 175 subjects) during dose escalation and expansion cannot 
be precisely determined but depends on the observed toxicity.   
There are 6 cohorts of subjects in the escalation portion of the protocol where INT230-6 dosing is increased 
over 5 doses.  These escalation cohorts are (A 1, B1, EA, EC, EC2 and DEC). 
There are potentially 4 fixed dose cohorts ( EC3, DEC2 , FEC  and G ) that use a maximum total fixed dose of 
INT230-6 of 175 mL for all 5 induction doses as well as  a maintenance dose.  In EC3, DEC2 and FEC 
expansion cohorts, 10-16 subjects will be treated at fixed INT230-6 doses in a tumor type, to provide 
additional safety information and preliminary assessment of tumor response within a disease indication.   G 
cohort will be a combination of fixed dose INT230-6 with other molecule s.  With 16 subjects treated in an 
expansion cohort, at a fixed dose and tumor type the 90% confidence interval for an objective response rate would be (5.3% to 42%) if 3 (19%) subjects had a response, (9.0% to 48%) if 4 (25%) subjects had a response and (13.2% to 54.8%) if 5 (31%) subjects had a response.  
 
14.2. Study populations  
14.2.1. All Enrolled Population  
All subjects who sign informed consent form will be included.  Subject disposit ion will be tabulated using 
this data set.  
14.2.2. All Treated Population 
All subjects wh o receive at least 1 dose or any partial dose of INT230-6.  This population will be used for 
safety analyses, and primary efficacy analyses.  
14.2.3. Pharmacokinetic Data Set  
All available concentration -time data from subjects who rec eive INT230 -6 will be reported.  All available 
derived PK parameter values will be included in the PK data set and reported, but only subjects with adequate PK profiles will be included in the sum mary statistics and statistical analysis.  PK sampling has 
been eliminated in Amendment  6. 
14.2.4. Response Evaluable Data Set 
Response evaluable subjects will be defined as all subjects who receive at least one dose of INT230-6, have a 
baseline tumor assessment with measurable disease, and one of the following: 1) at least one on- treatment 
tumor evaluation, 2) clinical progression, or 3) death prior to the first on- treatment tumor evaluation.  
14.2.5. Exploratory Biomarker (Immune Function and others)  Data Set 
All subjects who receive at least one dose of INT230- 6 and have at least one measurement for a specific 
marker will be included in the data set for that marke r.  All treated subjects with at least one baseline 
measurement will be included in predictive analyses; t reated subjects with baseline measurement and at least 
one on treatment measurement will be included in pharmacodynamic assessments.  Blood biomarker 
sampling has been eliminated in Amendment 6. 
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
  Page 87 of 212 
Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information 14.2.6. Retreatment Population  
For cohorts A1, B1, EA, EC, EC2, DEC, those subjects who have completed treatment and hav e not started  
any subsequent anti- cancer therapy  were eligible for retreatment.  Subjects  who qualif ied for re -initiation of 
treatment were  evaluated for safety and efficacy b ased on availability of data.   
 
14.3. Statistical Considerations  
Please refer to the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
14.3.1. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Subject demographics and baseline characteristics including age, sex, race, ethnicity, weight, baseline 
disease diagnosis, and medical conditions will be summarized by dose level using descriptive statistics.  
14.3.2. Extent of Exposure 
The dose of INT230-6 taken by subjects will be summarized by total dose and number of tumors injected. Additional parameters will be summarized, such a reason for study drug interruption and number of tumors with drug exuded.  A by- subject listing of treatment exposure will be generated.  
Combination study drugs for cohorts 7 and higher will also be summarized.  Details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan.   
14.3.3. Tumor Response . 
The primary efficacy endpoint of disease control rate (DCR), defined as the sum of complete, partial and 
stable disease responses divided by the total number of subjects in the efficacy population, will be 
determined per iRECIST criteria for fixed dose and expansion cohorts.  DCR will be tabulated by overall and by tumor type. Exploratory analysis will be conducted by cohort, Phase 1 cohorts (monotherapy and PD-1), 
Phase 2 cohorts (monotherapy, PD- 1 and CTLA -4), Phase 1 and 2 cohorts (monotherapy and PD- 1), tumor 
types, study visit, number of INT230-6 doses, number of cycles of INT230-6 (i.e., retreatment), and number 
of prior lines of therapy.  Since iRECIST methods were not implemented at the time of dose escalation, DCR 
for these cohorts will be analyzed per RECIST v1.1.    
For DCR, exact binomial 95% confidence intervals will be determined by Clopper-Pearson method. Median 
time to response and duration of response will be summarized for those subjects with confirmed responses, 
using Kaplan-Meier method; Progr ession free survival (PFS) will be similarly summarized. Individual tumor 
measurements, tumor burden and % changes in tumor burden will be listed. Changes in tumor burden will be 
presented graphically . 
14.3.4. Concomitant Medication 
Concomitant medications will be  coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHODD). 
Concomitant medications will be summarized.   Tabulation will b e made with respect to the proportion of 
subjects taking at least 1 concomitant med ication for each preferred term during the study.  A listing of 
concomitant medications by subject will be provided. 
14.3.5. Safety  
The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple intratumoral doses of INT230-6 in 
subjects with advanced or recurrent malignancies.  This will be assessed by the rate of > grade 3 AEs 
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
  Page 88 of 212 
Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information attributed to study drugs (INT230- 6 and others per the appropriate protocol supplement), and study 
procedure, and not the underlying disease.   
Safety Analyses :  
All recorded adverse events will be listed and tabulated b y system organ class, preferred term, and coded 
according to version 19.1 of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The incidence of 
adverse events will be tabulated and reviewed for potential significance and clinical importance. Vital sig ns 
and clinical laboratory test results will be listed and summarized.  Any significant physical examination (PE) 
findings and results of clinical laboratory tests will be listed. Electrocardiogram (ECG) listings will be evaluated by the investigator and abnormalities, if present, will be listed.  
Adverse Events will be summarized for all reported data and by study period: a) up to and including 28 days 
post last dose of initial treatment, and b) from first dose of re- initiation of treatment, for subjects wh o re-
initiate study therapy while in follow -up, up to 28 days post-dose of the last re-treatment dose.  In order to 
better estimate MTD or toxicity frequency of some events of interest, logistic regression or constrained Bayesian estimation may be used to model frequency by INT230-6 dose level for each population arm or 
across population arms when combination of different population arms is deemed appropriate. 
The following safety parameters will be evaluated:  
Adverse Events  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medic al occurrence or worsening of a pre-existing 
medical condition in a subject  or clinical investigation subject administered an investigational (medicinal) 
product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to the 
investigational product.  Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open-ended 
questioning, examination, or evaluation of a subject.  (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be questioned regarding the specific occu rrence of one or more AEs.) 
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be assoc iated with protocol-specified procedures.  
All SAEs must be collected that occur within 28 days of discontinuation of dosing.  The investigator should 
collect any SAE occurring after these time periods that is believed to be related to study drug or protocol-
specified procedure.  A SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its status of seriousness.  If the investigator believes that a SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to 
the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy, or a complication of a study procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form. 
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) to 
categorize a system organ class and a preferred term for each adverse event.  The number of subjects who 
experienced at least 1 adverse event, study drug related adverse event, severe (Grade 3 or above) adverse event, serious adverse event, and the number of subjects withdrawn due to adverse eve nts will be 
summarized.   For each system organ class and preferred term, summaries will be made with respect to the 
number and proportion of subjects having at least 1 occurrence of an adverse event during the study, using the worst grade reported within a subject.  The incidence of adverse events will be presented  overall, by 
system organ class and preferred term, intensity (based on NCI CTCAE Version 4.03),  and additional 
grouping by severity and relationship to study drug.  Individual listings of adverse events will be provided. 
DLTs and study drug- related Grade > 2 adverse events will be listed individually.  
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
  Page 89 of 212 
Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information  
Physical Examination 
Abnormal PE findings with onset prior to first dose of study drug will be recorded as medical history. Any 
abnormal or clinically significant findings on or after dosing will be recorded as an adverse event. Clinical significance will be determined by the Principal Investigator at each site.  
Individual medical/surgical history will be listed by subject. Individual abnormal or clinically significant PE findings after dosing will be recorded as an adverse event and listed separately with AEs. 
 
Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements and change from baseline will be summarized .  Vital signs include weight, systolic 
blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), body mass index (BMI, derived), heart rate, oxygen 
saturation, and temperature. Individual vital sign measurements will be listed.  
 
ECGs  
ECG data will be read and interpreted locally. Summary statistics of ECG overall interpretation  will be 
displayed.  Per subject ECG test results at will be listed . 
Abnormal clinically significant ECG findings on or after informed consent will be recorded as an adverse 
event and  displayed with AEs. 
 
Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Clinical laboratory values will be summarized in SI units.   Severity grades will be programmatically 
calculated using standard American Medical Association’s (AMA) laboratory normal ranges [AMA Manual 
of Style, AMA 2009] and the quantitative NCI CTCAE 4.03 criteria (when available for a specific laboratory 
abnormality). Laboratory values considered to be normal by CTCAE criteria, meaning they do not qualify as Grade 1 -4, will be assigned a severity grade of 0.  
Summary statistics of numerical laboratory test results and changes of test results from baseline will be reported for hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, and urinalysis at each scheduled time point. For values with categorical results, the frequency and percentage of each result category will be tabulated at each 
scheduled time point. Shift tables will also be included reporting change from baseline category (low, 
normal, high) to post-dose category (low, normal, high).  Abnormal laboratory values that lead to a change in subject management or that are considered to be of clinical significance will be reported as an adverse event 
(serious adverse event if relevant) and summarized by SOC/PT and according to severity in the appropriate 
AE tables.  Clinical significance will be determined by the Principal Investigator at each site.  
Pregnancy test results will be displayed in a listing.  
 
ECOG Performance Status  
ECOG performance status will be summarized using descriptive statistics. ECOG performance status per 
subject during the trial will also be listed.

Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information 14.4. Efficacy  
14.4.1. Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
The release kinetics of each analyte is not expected to be uniform across subjects. Sponsor shall assess the 
blood concentrations of the three analytes for each subject at the first cycle. Sponsor shall correlate the 
systemic measurement [maximum plas ma drug concentration (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC)] of the 3 
analytes to measured markers of systemic toxicity [in particular renal and blood – the known toxicities of the 
two active agents; cisplatin (CIS) & vinblastine (VBL]. Human plasma will be a nalyzed for the concentration 
of VBL and 8- ((2-hydroxybenzoyl)amino)octanoate (sodium salt form) (SHAO) using validated LC/MS/MS 
methods, and for cisplatin using a validated ICP-MS method. For pharmacokinetic profiling platinum drugs, total platinum levels  in subject plasma or urine are routinely determined by spectroscopy methods as a 
surrogate. Thus, an ICP -MS method is  developed for this study to measure total platinum in human samples 
as a surrogate for cisplatin.  
In addition, scatter plots of Cmax and AUCTAU versus INT230-6 dose volume will be provided for the first 
cycle. Dose proportionality per subject normalized to tumor volume will be assessed, by estimating the slope of linear regression of SHAO/CIS/VIN log(Cmax) on log(dose) and of log(AUCTAU) on log(dose) based on 
a power model. Point estimates and 90% confidence intervals for the dose proportionality paramete r (slope 
of the linear regression) will be calculated for Cmax and AUCTAU. Summary statistics for trough [minimum 
plasma drug concentration Cmin)] concentrations will be tabulated by dose and study cycle. Plots of Cmin 
vs. cycle will be assessed for cohort s by combining A1, B1 versus E Cohorts and grouping subjects by 
similar dose volumes of INT230-6. Pharmacokinetic concentrations from sparse samples will be listed, and 
may be used in combination with other studies for exposure-response or population pharm acokinetic 
modeling, which will be part of a separate report.  
Administrative interim analyses of pharmacokinetic may be provided at various times during the study in 
order to support program decisions or publications.  PK sampling has been eliminated in Amendment 6. 
14.4.2. Exploratory Biomarkers (Immune Function and others)  
The pharmacodynamic effects based on the immunomodulatory activity of INT230-6 on selected immune 
cell populations (for example, T- cell repertoire and their changes (or percent changes) on flow cytometry) 
and soluble factors in blood (cytokines), exploratory immune function markers including flow cytometry 
markers, humoral and cellular immune responses to tumor antigens (quantitative immunoglobulins, 
quantitative inflammatory infiltrates, when available) and a panel of recall non -tumor antigens will be 
assessed by summary statistics for outcomes from these markers and their changes (or percent changes) from 
baseline tabulated.  In addition, the time course of biomarker outcomes will be conveyed graphically, by 
summary plots (i.e., box plots) or individual subject plots over time.  Possible associations between changes in biomarker measures of interest and pharmacokinetic exposure will be explored.  Possible associations of 
various biomarkers meas ures (baseline value or change from baseline) with clinical outcome ( e.g., tumor 
response) may will be explored based on data availability, using response-evaluable subjects, to assess 
predictive markers in tumors. Methods such as, but not limited to, logistic regression may be used to explore 
such associations. Measures from markers based on optional samples, e.g., tumor- based markers may be 
similarly presented, depending on data availability.  
Potential associations of various biomarker measures (baseline value or change from baseline) with clinical 
outcome (e.g., tumor response or disease control) will be explored e.g ., for expression levels of PD- L1 
protein measured by immunohistochemistry techniques in tumor sections at baseline may be explored  based 
on data availab ility, using response- evaluable subjects, to explore assess potential predictive effects of these

associations.  
Measures from marker s based on optional samples, e.g ., tumor- based markers may be similarly presented, 
depending on data availability.  
Administrative interim analyses of biomarker data may be provided at various times during the study ( e.g., 
for the initial and the additiona l study cohorts) in order to support program decisions or publication. Blood 
biomarker assessments  have been eliminated in Amendment 6.

Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information 15. ETHICAL ASPECTS 
15.1. Ethics and Good Clinical Practice  
This study must be carried out in compliance with the protocol and in accordance with Sponsor and site 
SOPs.  These are designed to ensure adherence to Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as described in the 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Harmonize d Tripartite Guidelines for GCP 1996 and in 
accordance with the ethical principles underlying European Union Dire ctive 2001/20/EC and the United 
States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 50 (21CFR50) and Title 21, Part 312 (21CFR312). 
The protocol and any amendments and the subject informed consen t will receive Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee /Review Ethics Board  (IRB/IEC /REB ) approval/favorable opinion 
before initiation of the study.  Study personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by 
education, training, and experience to perform their respective tasks.  This study will not use the services of 
study personnel where sanctions have been invoked or where there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (e.g., loss of medical license, debarment). 
All potential serious breaches must be reported to Sponsor immediately. A serious breach is a breach of the 
conditions and principles of GCP in connection with the study or the protocol, which is likely to affect, to a significant degree, the safety or phys ical or mental integrity of the subjects of the study or the scientific value 
of the study. 
 
15.2. Confidentiality Regarding Study Subjects  
Investigators must assure that the privacy of subjects, including their personal ide ntity and all personal 
medical information, will be protected at all times, as required by law. In CRFs and other study documents 
submitted to Sponsor or its designee, subjects will be identified by their initials, subject number, date of birth, and gender. 
Personal medical information may be reviewed and/or copied f or research, quality assurance, and/or data 
analysis. This review may be conducted by the study monitor, properly authorized persons on behalf of 
Sponsor, an independent auditor, IRBs/IECs or re gulatory authorities. Personal medical information will 
always be treated as confidential.  
 
15.3. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee/Review Ethics 
Board  
Before implementing this study, the protocol, the proposed ICF, and other information provided to subjects 
must be reviewed by an IRB/IEC /REB . A signed and dated statement that the protocol, and ICF, subject 
recruitment materials/process (e .g., advertisements), and any other written information to be provided to 
subjects have been approved by the IRB /IEC must be given to Sponsor before study initiation. The name and 
occupation of the chairperson and the members of the IRB/IEC (preferred) or the IRB’s Health and Human 
Safety Assurance number must be supplied to Sponsor or its designee. Any amendments to the protocol 
which need formal approval, as required by local law or procedure, will be approved by this committee. The IRB/IEC will also be notified of all other administrative amendments (i.e., administrative changes).  
The investigator or sponsor should also provide the IRB/IEC with a copy of the Investigator Brochure or product labeling, information to be provided to subjects and any updates. 
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
  Page 93 of 212 
Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information The investigator or sponsor should provide the IRB/IEC with reports, updates and other information ( e.g. 
expedited safety reports, amendments and administrative letters) according to regulatory requirements or 
institution procedures. 
 
15.4. Informed Consent  
Investigators must ensure that subjects, or, in those situations where consent cannot be given by subjects, 
their legally acceptable representatives, are clear ly and fully informed about the purpose, potential risks, and 
other critical issues regarding  clinical studies in which they volunteer to participate. 
The Investigator, or designee, will explain to each s ubject (or legally authorized representative) the nature of 
the research study, its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration of subject participation, alternative treatment, potential risks  and benefits involved, and any discomfort which may occur during the 
subject’s participation in the study. Each subject will be informed that participation in the study is voluntary 
and that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/h er subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the treating physician. 
This informed consent should be given by means of a standard written statement, written in nontechnical language. The subject should read and consider the statement before signing and dating it and should be given a copy of the signed document. No subject can enter the study and no study- related procedures can be 
done before his/her informed consent has been obtained. 
The ICF must be submitted by the Investigator with the protocol for IRB/IEC approval. Sponsor supplies a 
proposed ICF template that complies with regulatory requirements, includes all elements required by ICH, 
GCP and applicable regulatory requirements, and is considered appropriate for the study. The sample 
informed consent form will a dhere to the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of 
Helsinki. Any changes to the proposed ICF suggested by the Investigator must be agreed to by Sponsor or its 
designee be fore su bmission to the IRB/IEC, and a copy of the approved version must be provided to the 
Sponsor study monitor after IRB/IEC approval. 
 Investigators must: 
1. Provide a copy of the consent form and written information about the study in the language in which 
the subject is most proficient prior to clinical study participation. The language must be non- technical 
and easily understood. 
2. Allow time necessary for subject or subject's legally acceptable representative to inquire about the details of the study. 
3. Obtain an informed consent signed and personally dated by the subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion. 
4. Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opinion of the written informed consent form and 
any other information to be provided to the subjects, prior to the beginning of the study, and after any 
revisions are completed for new information. 
5. If informed consent is initially given by a subject’s legally acc eptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the subject subsequently becomes capable of making and communicating their informed consent during the study, then consent must additionally be obtained from the subject.  
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
  Page 94 of 212 
Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information 6. Revise the informed consent whenever important new inform ation becomes available that is relevant 
to the subject's consent. The investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, should fully 
inform the subject or the subject's legally acc eptable representative or legal guardian, of all pertinent 
aspects of the study and of any new information relevant to the subject's willingness to continue participation in the stud y. This communication should be documented. 
 
The consent form must also include a statement that Sponsor and reg ulatory authorities have dire ct access to 
subject records.  
Subjects unable to give their written consent (e.g., stroke subject s, or subjects with severe dementia) may 
only be enrolled in the study with the consent of a legally acceptable representative. The subject must also be 
inform ed about the nature of the study to the extent compatible with the subjects’ understanding, and should 
they become capable, personally sign and date the consent form as soon as possible. The explicit wish of a 
subject unable to give his or her written consent, who is capable of forming an opinion and assessing this information to refuse participation in, or to be withdrawn from, the clinical study at any time should be 
considered by the investigator. 
The rights, safety, and well-being of the study subjects are the most important considerations and should 
prevail over interests of science and society.  
 
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6

Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information 16. ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS  
16.1. Protocol Amendments 
Any change or modification to this protocol requires a written protocol amendment that must be approved by 
Sponsor before implementation. Amendments significantly affecting the safety of subjects, the scope of the 
investigation, or the scientific quality of the study require additional approval by the IRB/IEC of all centers 
and, in some countries, by the regulatory authority. A copy of the written approval of the IRB/IEC must be given to the Sponsor study monitor, or their designee. Examples of amendments requiring such approval are: 
1. Increase in drug dosage or duration of exposure of subjects, or any significant increase in the number of subjects under study; 
2. Significant change in the study design (e.g., addition or deletion of a control group); 
3. Increase in the number of procedures to which subjects are exposed; or 
4. Addition or deletion of a test procedure intended to improve safety monitoring. 
 
These requirements for approval should in no way prevent any immediate action from being taken by the 
Investigator or by Sponsor in the interests of preser ving the safety of all subjects included in the study. If an 
immediate change to the protocol is felt by the Investigator to be necessary and is implemented by him/her 
for safety reasons, Sponsor should be notified and the IRB/IEC for the center should be informed within 1 
working day. Any significant deviation must be documented in the CRF. 
If a deviation or change to a protocol is implemented to elimina te an immediate hazard(s) prior to obtaining 
IRB/IEC approval/favorable opinion, as soon as possible the deviation or change will be submitted to: 
− IRB/IEC for revie w and approval/favorable opinion 
− Sponsor 
− Regulatory Authority(ies), if required by local regulations 
− Documentation of approval signed by the chairperson or designee of the IRB(s)/IEC(s) must 
be sent to Sponsor. 
 
If an amendment substantially alters the stu dy design or increases the potential risk to the subject: (1) the 
consent form must be revised and submitted to the IRB(s)/IEC(s) for review and approval/favorable opinion; 
(2) the revised form must be used to obtain consent from subjects currently enrolled in the study if they are 
affected by the amendment; and (3) the new form must be used to obtain consent from new subjects prior to enrollment.  
If the revision is an administrative letter, investigators must inform their IRB(s)/IEC(s). Amendments affectin g only administrative aspects of the study do not require formal protocol amendments or IRB/IEC 
approval; however, the IRB/IEC for each center must be kept informed of such administrative changes. 
Examples of administrative changes not requiring formal pro tocol amendments and IRB/IEC approval that 
can be treat ed as administrative amendments include, but are not limited to: 
1. Changes in the staff used to monitor studies (e.g. Sponsor staff versus a contract research  
organization); and 
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
  Page 96 of 212 
Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information 2. Minor changes (within regulatory guidelines) in the packaging or labeling of study drug. 
 
16.2. Monitoring Procedures  
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an Inves tigator’s meeting, a Sponsor representative will 
review the protocol, CRFs, and other study documents with the Investigators and their staff. During the 
study, the Sponsor Study Monitor, or designee, will visit the site regularly to check the completeness of 
subject records, accuracy of entries on the CRFs, adherence to the protocol and to GCP, progress of enrollment, and also to ensure that study drug is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications.  
The Investigator must give the study monitor access to relevant hospital or clinical records to confirm their consistency w ith the CRF entries. No informa tion in these records about the identity of the subjects will 
leave the study center. Sponsor mo nitoring standards require full verification for the presence of informed 
consent, HIPAA authorization, adherence to the inclusio n/exclusion criteria, documentation of serious 
adverse ev ents, and recording of efficacy and safety variables. Additional checks of the consistency of source 
data with the CRFs are performed according to the study-specific monitoring plan. 
Representatives of Sponsor must be allowed to visit all study site locations periodically to assess the data 
quality and study integrity. On site they will review study records and directly compare them with source 
documents, discuss the conduct of the study with the investigator, and verify that the facilities remain 
acceptable.  
In addition, the study may be evaluated by Sponsor internal auditors and government inspectors who must be 
allowed access to CRFs, source documents, other study files, and study fa cilities. Sponsor audit reports will 
be kept confidential. 
The investigator must notify Sponsor promptly of any inspections scheduled by regulatory authorities, and 
promptly forward copies of inspection reports to Sponsor. 
 
16.3. Investigational Site Training  
Sponsor and its contracted study management company , Catalyst , will provide quality investigational staff 
training prior to study initiation. Training topics will include but are not limited to: GCP, AE reporting, study 
details and procedure, electronic CRFs, study documentation, informed consent, deep tumor dosing 
procedures and enrollment of WOCBP. 
 
16.4. Recording of Data and Retention of Documents  
All information required by the protocol should be provided; any omissions or corrections should be 
explained. All CRFs should be completed and available for collection within a timely manner, preferably no more than 10 days after the subject’s visit (except for the last visit of the last subject, which should be 
completed in a timely manner, preferably within 5 working days), so that the study monitor may check the 
entries for completeness, accuracy and legibility, ensure the CRF is signed by the Investigator and transmit the data to Sponsor or its designee. 
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
  Page 97 of 212 
Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information The CRF will be completed by the authorized study site personnel. Electronic queries will be used to 
communicate eligible discrepant data with the study sites.  
The Investigator must maintain source documents for each subject in the study. All information on CRFs will be traceable to these source documents, which are generally maintained in the subject’s file. The source 
documents will contain all demog raphic and medical information, including laboratory data, ECGs, etc., and 
also a copy of the signed informed consent/HIPAA authorization, which should indicate the study number 
and title of the study. 
Essential documents, as listed below, will be retained by the Investigator for the maximum period required to 
comply with national and international regulations, or institutional procedures, or for the period specified by the sponsor, whichever is longer. Sponsor will notify the Investigator(s)/institution(s) when study -related 
records are no longer required to be retained. The Investigator agrees to adhere to the document retention procedures by signing the protocol. The investigator must contact Sponsor prior to destroying any records associated with the study. 
If the investigator withdraws from the study (e.g., relocation, retire ment), the records shall be transferred to a 
mutually agreed upon designee (e.g., another investigator, IRB). Notice of such transfer will be given in 
writing to Sponsor. 
Essential documents include: 
1. Signed protocol and all amendments; 
2. IRB/IEC approvals for the study protocol and all amendments; 
3. All source documents and laboratory records; 
4. CRF copies;  
5. Subjects’ ICF/HIPAA authorization; and  
6. Any other pertinent study documents. 
16.4.1. Study Drug Records  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that a current disposition record of investigational product 
(those supplied by the sponsor) is maintained at each study site where study drug is inventoried and dispensed. Records or logs must comply with applicable regulations and guidelines and should include: 
− amount received and placed in storage area  
− amount currently in storage area 
− label ID number or batch number 
− amount dispensed to and returned by each subject, including unique subject identifiers 
− amount transferred to another area/site for dispensing or storage 
− non-study disposition (e.g. lost, wasted) 
− amount destroyed at study sit e, if applicable  
− amount returned to the sponsor 
− retain samples for bioavailability/bioequivalence, if applicable  
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6

dispensing/accountability, as per the Delegation of Authority Form. 
The sponsor will provide forms to facilitate inventory control if the investigational site does not have an established 
system that meets these requirements.  
16.4.2. Case report Forms  
An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed to record 
all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each individual treated or entered as a control 
in the investigation. Data reported on the CRF that are derived from source documents must be consistent with the s ource documents or the discrepancies must be explained. 
Electronic CRFs will be prepared for all data collection fields except for fields specific to SAEs and pregnancy, which will be reported on the SAE
 form and Pregnancy Surveillance form, respectively. Spaces 
may be left blank only in those circumstances permitted by study-specific CRF completion guidelines provided by the sponsor. 
The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects must be protected, respecting the privacy and 
confidentiality ru les in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s). The investigator will 
maintain a signature sheet to document signatures and initials of all persons authorized to make entries and/or corrections on CRFs. 
The completed CRF , must be promptly reviewed,  signed, and dated by a qualified physician who is an 
investigator or sub-investigator electronically through the Sponsor’s electronic data capture tool.  
Each individual electronically signing electronic CRFs must meet Sponsor training requirements and must 
only access the Sponsor electronic data capture too l using the unique user account provided by the sponsor. 
User accounts are not to be shared or reassigned to other individuals. 
 
16.5. Auditing Procedure  
In addition to the routine monitoring procedures, Sponsor, or its designees, may conduct audits of clinical 
research activities in accordance with internal SOPs to evaluate compliance with the principles of GCP. 
Sponsor, its designee, or a regulatory authority may wish to conduct an inspection (during the study or after 
its completion). If an inspection is requested by a regulatory authority, the Investigator will inform Sponsor immediately that this request has been made.  
 
16.6. Publication of Results  
Any formal presentation or publication of data collected from this study will be considered as a joint publication by the Investigator(s) and the appropriate personnel of Sponsor. Authorship will be determined 
by mutual agreement. For multicenter studies,  it is mandatory that the first publication be based on data from 
all centers, analyzed as stipulated in the protocol by Sponsor statisticians, and not by the Investigators 
themselves. Investigators participating in multicenter studies agree not to present data gathered from one 
center o r a small group of centers before the full, initial publication, unless formally agreed to by all other 
Investigators and Sponsor. 
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
  Page 99 of 212 
Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information The data collected during this study are confidential and proprietary to the sponsor. Any publications or 
abstracts arising from this study require approval by the sponsor prior to publication or presentation and must 
adhere to the sponsor’s publication requirements as set forth in the approved clinical trial agreement (CTA). All draft publications, including abstracts or detailed summaries of any proposed presentations, must be 
submitted to the sponsor at the earliest practicable time for review, but at any event not less th an 30 days 
before submission or presentation unless otherwise set forth in the CTA. Sponsor sha ll have the right to 
delete any confidential or proprietary information contained in any proposed presentation or abstract and 
may delay publication for up to 60 days for purposes of filing a patent application. 
Sponsor must receive copies of any intended co mmunication in advance of submission (at least 30 working 
days for a journal submission and 15 days for an abstract or oral presentation). Sponsor will review the 
communications for accuracy (thus avoiding potential discrepancies with submissions to health authorities), 
verify that confidential information is not being inadvertently disclosed, and provide any relevant supplementary information. Authorship of communications arising from pooled data may include members from each of the contributing centers, a s well as Sponsor personnel. 
 
16.7. Disclosure and Confidentiality  
By signing the protocol, the Investigator agrees to keep all information generated in connection with the 
study or provided by Sponsor or its designee in strict confidence and to request similar confidentiality from 
his/her staff and the IRB/IEC. Study documents provided by Sponsor (protocols, Investigators’ Brochures, CRFs, and other material) will be stored appropriately to ensure their confidentiality. Such confidential 
information may not be disclosed to others without direct written authorization from Sponsor, except to the 
extent necessary to obtain informed consent/HIPAA authorization from subjects who wish to participate in the study. 
16.8. Discontinuation of Study  
Sponsor reserves the right to d iscontinue study for any reason at any time. 
16.9. Data Management  
16.9.1. Data Collection 
Investigators must enter the information required by the protocol into t he Electronic Data Capture (EDC) 
system .  The electronic CRF  (eCRF ) will be completed by the authorized stu dy site personnel. An electronic 
version of the final eCRF book for each subject will be forwarded to the study sites for record keeping at the study site closure. 
16.9.2. Database Management and Quality Control 
Data items from the CRFs will be entered into  the st udy database using data entry with verifications. 
Subsequently, the information entered into the database will be systematically checked by Data Management 
staff following Sponsor, or its designee, data management procedures. Obvious errors will be corrected by 
Sponsor personnel, or its designee. Other errors, omissions, or requests for clarification will be queried; queries will be returned t o the study site for resolution.  After receipt in Data Management, the resolutions 
will be entered into the database. Quality control audits of all key safety and efficacy data in the database will be conducted as agreed upon by relevant team members.

Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information 18. APPENDICES  
18.1. Appendix 1: iRECIST  
18.1.1. iRECIST Response  Assessment  
Overall response will also be assessed using iRECIST. Immunotherapeutics may result in infiltration of 
immune cells leading to transient increase in the size in malignant lesions, or undetectable lesions becoming 
detectable. The criteria are identical to t hose of RECIST 1.1 in many respects but have been adapted to 
account for instances where an increase in tumor burden, or the appearance of new lesions, does not reflect 
true tumor progression. 
Key differences are described below. All responses defined using iRECIST criteria are designated with a 
prefix. iRECIST time -point and best overall responses will be recorded separately.  
18.1.2. Confirming  Progression  
Unlike RECIST 1.1, iRECIST requires the confirmation of progression and uses the terms iUPD 
(unconfirmed progression) and iCPD (confirmed progression). Confirmatory scans should be performed at 
least 4 weeks, but no longer than 8 weeks after iUPD. 
iCPD is confirmed if further increase in tumor burden, compared to the last assessment, is seen as evidenced 
by one or more of the following: 
• Continued increase in tumor  burden (from iUPD) where RECIST 1.1 definitions of progression 
had been met (from nadir) in target, non- target disease or new  lesions 
o Progression in target disease worsens with an increase of at least 5 mm in the 
absolute value of the sum 
o Continued unequivocal progression in non- target disease with an increase in tumor 
burden 
o Increase in size of previously identified new lesion (s) (an increase of at least 5 mm 
in the absolute value of the sum of those considered to be target new lesions) or additional new lesions. 
• RECIST 1.1 criteria are met in lesions types (target or non- target or new lesions) where 
progression was not previously identified, including the appearance of additional new lesions. 
If iUPD is not confirmed at the next assessment, then the appropriate response will be assigned (iUPD if the criteria are still met, but no worsening, or iSD, iPR or iCR if those criteria are met compared to baseline). As can be seen in Table 15 , the prior documentation of iUPD does not preclude assigning iCR, iPR, or iSD in 
subsequent time-point assessments or as best overall response (BOR) providing that iCPD is not documented 
at the next assessment after  iUPD.  
18.1.3. New  lesions  
New lesions should be assessed and measured as they appear using RECIST 1.1 criteria (maximum of 5 lesions, no more than 2 per site, at least 10 mm in long axis (or 15 mm in short axis for nodal lesions), and recorded as New Lesions -Target (NLT) and New Lesion -Non-Target (NLNT) to allow clear differentiation 
from baseline tar get and non- target lesions.  
New lesions may either meet the criteria of NLT or NLNT to drive iUPD (or iCPD). However, the measurements of target lesions should NOT be included in the sum of measures of original target lesions 
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
  Page 103 of 212 
Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information identified at baseline. Rather, these measurements will be collected on a separate table in the case record 
form.  
PD is confirmed in the New Lesion category if the next imaging assessment, conducted at least 4 weeks (but not more than 8 weeks) after iUPD confirms further progression fr om iUPD with either an increase of at least 
5 mm in the absolute value of the sum of NLT OR an increase (but not necessarily unequivocal increase) in the size of NLNT lesions OR the appearance of additional new lesions.

• For patients with non -target disease only at baseline, only CR or non -CR/non -PD can be assigned at each TPR but is not 
shown in the table for ease of presentation.  
18.1.4. Response and Stable Disease Duration (RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST)  
Response duration will be measured from the time measurement criteria for CR/PR or iCR/iPR (whichever is first recorded) are first met until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease 
is objectively documented, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded on study 
(including baseline). 
Stable disease duration will be measured from the time of start of treatment until the criteria for 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (including baseline).  
18.1.5. Methods of  Measurement  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Assessments should be identified 
on a calendar s chedule and should not be affected by delays in therapy. While on study, all 
lesions (including target, bystander, and non- target)  recorded at baseline should have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g. 2 mm). If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be 
recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to 
measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned. For lesions which fragment/split add 
together the longest diameters of the fragmented portions; for lesions which coalesce, measure 
the maximal longest diameter for the “merged  lesion”.    
Clinical Lesions . Clinical lesions will only be considered me asurable when they are superficial 
and ≥10 mm as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is recommended. If feasible, imaging is pref erred.  
Protocol IT-01 Version Amendment 6 
  
 
Page 105 of 212 
Intensity Therapeutics Confidential Information   Chest X -ray. Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is an 
important endpoint, since CT is more  sensitive  than X-ray, particularly  in identifying new 
lesions. However,  lesions ≥20 mm on chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung. 
CT, MRI. CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected 
for response assessment. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. When CT scans have slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. 
MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g . for body scans). Other specialized imaging or 
other techniques may also be appropriate for individual case.4 For example, while PET scans are 
not considered adequate to measure lesions, PET-CT scans may be used providing that the 
measures are obtained fr om the CT scan and the CT scan is of identical diagnostic quality to a 
diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast).  
Ultrasound. Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT is advised. 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy . The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised. However, they can be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
Tumor Markers . Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response. If 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit, however, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete response. 
Cytology, Histology . These techniques can be us ed to differentiate between PR and CR in rare 
cases if required by protocol (for example, residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell 
tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). When effusions are known to be a 
potential adverse effect of  treatment (e.g. with certain taxane compounds or angiogenesis 
inhibitors), the cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor  has met criteria for response or stable 
disease is advised to differentiate between response or stable disease and progressive disease.

1 1. OBJECTIVES 	
 
1.1 Study	Design	‐	Abstract 	
 
Arm 2: This study has two arms.  Arm 1 is the protocol as written below using Ammonia 
perfusion PET to assess ablation results of standard FDG PET/CT-guided liver tumor 
ablations. Arm 2 is the identical protocol, but substitutes the radiopharmaceutical FDG for 
Ammonia to assess ablation resu lts of standard FDG PET/CT- guided liver tumor ablations. 
Arm 2 will not include the option of perfor ming a second intraprocedural perfusion PET 
scan. FDG is FDA-approved for oncologic im aging as in this study. No IND or IND 
exemption is required. The protocol is iden tical in all other re spects. All protocol 
comments pertaining to Arm 2 will be placed in  new paragraphs beginning with “Arm 2:” 
in bold letters. Throughout the protocol, Arm 2 simply substitutes FDG for N-13 ammonia.  
In Arm 2, All AP-PET scans (which are the onl y research intervention of the study) are 
performed using FDG instead of N-13 ammonia.  
 Arm 1 and Arm 2 are independent and no randomi zation or enrollment criteria for one arm 
or the other are defined.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate a novel imaging technique for intra-procedural 
assessment, also known as monitoring, of  image-guided percutaneous liver tumor 
microwave or cryoablation (thermal ablation) procedures.  Monitoring assures that the tumor is being ablated completely (and nearby critical structures left unharmed) by allowing the interventionalist to view abla tive changes and make intra-procedural 
adjustments to the location of the ablation ap plicators, the number of overlapping ablation 
treatments, or the duration of  ablation applications. As a result, improved monitoring has 
the potential to improve patient outcomes.  We will assess a novel method for monitoring 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography 
(PET/CT)-guided liver tumor ab lations: intra-procedural 13N-ammonia perfusion PET (AP-
PET). N-13 ammonia is FDA-approved for cardiac  perfusion imaging, but will be used in 
this study for the off-label indication of imagi ng perfusion of the liver.  The standard dose 
and IV route of administration will be employed. We will compare this method of assessing immediate technical success of abla tion procedures to standard assessments 
using intra-procedural contrast-enhanced CT (CECT). We will also compare final intra-procedural ammonia perfusion PET to gold standard 24-hour magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) or CT for predicting longer term techni que effectiveness as demonstrated on routine 
MRI (or if MRI is not possible, on CT) obtaine d at a minimum of three to 12 months after 
the procedure.  This study will evaluate if AP-PET can be used intra-procedurally during FDG PET/CT-
guided ablation procedures to identify regions of  the ablation zone that do not adequately 
treat the tumor.  The ablation zone is th e volume of tissue destroyed by the ablation 
treatment.  Adequate ablation treatment of  tumor is generally defined by a minimum 
ablation margin of 5-10 mm. The ablation margin  refers to the rim of normal tissue beyond 
the tumor included within the ablation zone in order to assure that even microscopic tumor

2 extensions beyond the visible tu mor are fully destroyed.   
 
 
The ability to directly visualize and assess the ablation margin  requires visibility of both 
the tumor and the boundaries of the ablation zone. Unfortunately, tumor visibility using CT or US is often lost or dimi nished immediately following th ermal ablation.  On the other 
hand, the entire ablation zone is  generally visible as a regi on of decreased or absent 
enhancement on CECT scans obtained following the ablation. The ablation zone is usually poorly defined on US imaging obtained after ablation.  Because of these limitations of CT and US, the ablation margin is usually estimat ed using side-by-side  comparisons of the 
size and shape of the ablation zone as depict ed on intra-procedural post-ablation CECT 
with the pre-procedural MRI or CT appearan ce and location of the tumor. Alternatively, 
retrospective software fusion of  the post-ablation CECT with  pre-procedural MRI or CT 
can be used. Unfortunately, these standard approaches often do not allow for confident 
point-by-point assessment of the entire circ umference of the ablation margin.  These 
limitations of our standard imaging technique s for the intra-procedural assessment or 
monitoring of thermal ablation procedures in the liver underscore the need for identifying 
more robust techniques.  This  study explores a novel imagi ng technique with  the potential 
to improve our intra-procedural assessment  of ablation results and, in turn, patient 
outcomes. 
 
Adult patients referred to our Tumor Abla tion Clinic for image-guided percutaneous 
ablation of liver tumors will be considered fo r enrollment.  Patients who meet our standard 
clinical criteria for image-gui ded liver tumor ablations will be offered the opportunity to 
enroll in this prospective study. Standard clinical criteria include a known primary or metastatic malignancy of the liver for which local therapies are being considered. These 
may include tumors that are unresectable for a ny reason or tumors in patients who have co-
morbidities precluding surgery.  Liver tumor ablations are also performed to reduce the

3 tumor burden in patients with advanced diseas e or to palliate symptoms such as pain.  
Liver tumor ablation may serve as a bridge to liver transplantation in patients with 
hepatocellular carcinoma.  Ablation may be an  option for patients who do not wish to 
undergo open surgical procedures.  It is expect ed that approximately 2/3 of the tumors will 
prove to be FDG-avid and 1/3 non-FDG-avid.  It  is anticipated that we will ablate a single 
liver tumor per procedure in approximately 70%  of patients, two liver tumors in 15% of 
patients, three liver tumors in 10% of patient s, and more than three tumors in 5% of 
patients, based on our recent practice expe rience.  Patients will be excluded for 
uncorrectable coagulopathy or severe inter-current illness. Tumor ablation procedures will 
be performed as they are routinely performe d by our team in clinical practice using FDG 
PET/CT and possible supplemental US guidan ce. Targeting can be accomplished based on 
tumor visibility on any one or more of these imaging modalities (US, PET, or CT).  FDG-
avidity is not essential for th e targeting of tumors.  Patient s enrolled in this study will 
receive ablation treatments that will not be compromised by the research portions of the 
procedures.  
 
The ablation will be planned and the ablation applicators inserted percutaneously using 
routine FDG PET/CT and possible supplementa l US guidance. The ablation will then be 
performed using current protocols with either  microwave ablation or cryoablation devices. 
Microwave ablation and cryoablation devices of fer complimentary advantages that enable 
us to safely and effectively treat many liver tumors.  Cryoablation may be better tolerated 
and less painful when ablating liver tumors clos e to the liver capsule or diaphragm.  The 
iceball created during cryoablation is usually  well visualized duri ng the ablation, which 
can offer safety advantages when ablating near  critical structures.  Microwave ablation has 
fewer tendencies to induce thrombocytopenia or myoglobinemia than cryoablation, which 
can be an advantage in patients with baseli ne thrombocytopenia or renal insufficiency.  
Microwave ablation is better able to overcome vascular heat-sink phenomena that can limit the ablation of tumor cells abutting large blood vessels.  Our standard practice is to choose 
the most appropriate ablation technology base d on the individual patient’s specific 
circumstances.  Radiofrequency ablation is not included in this pr otocol, as microwave 
ablation has almost completely replaced the use of radiofrequency ablation in our practice.  
 When the initial ablation is completed, intra-procedural AP-PET-1(research scan #1) will be performed and the findings recorded.  Specifically, the ablation margin separating the FDG-avid tumor from the normal ammonia-perfus ed liver will be assessed for visibility 
and thickness along the entire ci rcumference. Patients with ad equate renal function (EGFR 
>60) will then undergo intra- procedural contrast-enhanced CT, as is now performed in 
routine clinical practice to mon itor initial results. Non-contrast  CT will be used in cases of 
inadequate renal function or contrast a llergy. If no additiona l overlapping ablation 
applications are deemed necessary or appropriate based on routine CT (Pathway 1), the procedure will be concluded at this point.  AP-PET information may be used to aid the margin assessment if CT is inconclusive.  No te that routine CT will always be used to 
determine the safety of additional overlapping ablation, per routine clin ical practice.  This 
is because proximity of ablation devices to cr itical structures can only be imaged with CT 
and not with PET.  The patient will then undergo routine 24-hour pos t-procedure liver MRI

4 or CT.  If the CT scan suggests an inadequa te ablation margin of less than 5-10 mm at any 
portion of the tumor surface, additional ablations  will be applied to the under-treated areas 
(Pathway 2), if deemed safe and appropriate based on standard clinical practice.  Then, 
AP-PET-2 will be repeated (research scan #2) . Not more than two AP-PET scans will be 
performed during the entire procedure.  The AP-PET scan(s), illustrated schematically below, constitute the only resear ch component of the protocol.  
 
Arm 2:  Arm 2 will not include the option of AP-PET 2 (research scan #2) due to the 
longer half-life of FDG.   
 
 For patients with FDG-avid tumo rs, visibility rates of the en tire ablation margin using AP-
PET-1will be compared to the visibility rates of the entire ablation margin using the intra-
procedural CECT scan.  Visibility rates us ing AP-PET-1 will also be compared to the 
visibility rates using the intra-procedural CECT scan fused to FDG PET (FDG 
PET/CECT).  The concordance rates of the fi nal intra-procedural AP-PET (research scan 
#1 or #2) with gold standard 24-hour post-pr ocedure MRI or CT will be determined.  
 For those patients with non-FDG-avid tumors, retrospective software fusion of AP-PET-1 
with pre-procedural MRI or CT will be used to assess visibility rates of the ablation margin and will be compared with visibility rates of the ablation ma rgin using retrospective fusion 
of the intra-procedural CECT and pre-procedural MRI or CT.  Similarly, in patients with 
non-FDG-avid tumors the concordance rate of  final intra-procedural AP-PET (research 
scan #1 or #2) fused to pre-procedural MR I or CT, with gold standard 24-hour post-
procedure MRI or CT will be determined. The an alysis of AP-PET utility in patients with 
non-FDG-avid tumors is a secondary objective of  this study, but is nevertheless of interest, 
as AP-PET may prove valuable in these pati ents who cannot receive IV contrast or

5 potentially as a superior assessment for patien ts who can receive IV contrast. Prediction of 
longer term technique effectiveness rates (l ocal recurrence rates) based on blinded 
retrospective reads will be compared for th e final intra-procedural AP-PET scan and 24-
hour MRI or CT, using local tumor progression as assessed on routine follow-up MRI or 
CT scans performed at least 3 to 12 months  after the ablation procedure as the gold 
standard. Liver contrast-enhanced MRI is preferred for routine 24-hour follow-up imaging, 
however, contrast-enhanced CT may be substituted if the patient cannot undergo MRI due 
to contraindications such as incompatible implanted devices.  The results of this study are expected to show  that AP-PET can be used to reveal areas of 
ablation under-treatment or areas of optimal tr eatment that are not consistently identified 
with contrast-enhanced CT al one.  Better intra-procedural assessment of tumor ablation 
results has the potential to improve image-guided tumor ablation technical success and effectiveness rates.

Arm 2:  The primary and secondary objectives ar e identical for Arms 1 & 2 of the study 
(except that in Arm 2, no research scan #2 will be performed).  
• 1.  For FDG-avid tumors, compare the rates of  complete, circumferential ablation margin 
visibility during FDG PET/CT-guided liver ab lations using two imag ing techniques: intra-

• 1.  For FDG-avid tumors, rates of local tumor progression based on a minimum of 3-12 
month imaging follow-up will be compared for ablation margin adequacy assessed by blinded retrospective reads of  final intraprocedural AP-PET (research scan #1 or #2) and

BACKGROUND 	
 
2.1 Study	Agent(s) 	
 
• No therapeutic drugs are involved in this study. The nuclear imaging radiopharmaceutical 
N-13 ammonia is an FDA-appr oved radiotracer that will be used for an off-label 
diagnostic imaging indication.  Th e tracer will be administer ed by the standard IV route 
and using the standard 10 mCi dose.  Inst ead of imaging perfusion of the heart (FDA-
approved indication), the tracer will be used in this study to image perfusion of the liver 
(off-label indication).   
• Arm (2):  FDG will be used not only for the routine targeting phase of the procedure but 
also as the perfusion agent instead of N-13 ammonia.  FDG is FDA-approved for 
oncologic imaging as in this study.  The tota l FDG dose including the targeting dose (8-10 
mCi) and the research perfusion dose (2-4 mCi) will together fall within the standard dose for routine diagnostic or interventional FDG PET/CT scans (< 15 mCi). This “split-dose” 
technique allows the research PET perfusion scan to be performed without adding to the 
routine FDG dose received by pa tients not undergoing the research PET perfusion scan.  
	
2.2 Study	Disease	
 
• Liver tumors, including primary or metastatic malignancies. 
 
2.3 Rationale 	and	Correlative 	Studies	Background 	
• Percutaneous image-guided thermal ablation procedures are increasingly used to treat liver tumors (1).  These procedures are most commonly 
performed using US or CT guidance.  Not all tumors are well-visualized 
using CT and/or US guidance, which has prompted the increasing use of 
PET/CT for guidance of percutaneous interventional procedures. PET/CT-

7 guided tumor ablations are becoming more common due the advantage of 
targeting tumors not visible using ot her imaging techniques and targeting 
tumors based on metabolic characteristics (2-4).  This allows for targeting of specific regions of tumors based on vi ability, glucose meta bolic activity, and 
other biologic characteristics (e.g.  hypoxia, DNA synthetic activity). 
• Regardless of the imaging guidance modali ty used, monitoring the ablation is 
important to assure that the tumor and a sufficien t margin of surrounding 
normal liver are ablated.  An adequate ablation margin minimizes the risk of 
local tumor recurrence.  It is an accepted, importan t goal of all liver tumor 
ablations that the ablation zone ex tends least 5-10 mm beyond the tumor at 
all points of the tumor surface (1). This assures that microscopic disease just 
outside the visible tumor is treated.  The ablati on margin surrounding the 
tumor is analogous to a surgical margin  that provides confidence the entire 
tumor has been removed including microscopic extensions into adjacent 
normal tissues. 
• Current techniques for intra-procedural a ssessment of tumor ablation margins have 
limitations.  For example, when performing CT-g uided ablations, it is standard practice to 
obtain an intra-procedural contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) to monitor whether the tumor is 
being treated fully and an adequate ablation margin is being obtained following thermal 
ablation.  CECT is usually performed only on ce near the end of th e procedure since one 
dose of IV contrast material is usually the limit for a 24-hour period.  If a reduced dose of 
IV contrast is used, this may allow for two intra-procedural CECT scans, however, this 
may limit the effectiveness of the method. For example, the degree of liver enhancement is reduced making it difficult to distinguish tumor from liver.  Patients with a contrast 
material allergy or severe renal insuffic iency (EGFR < 30) are often not considered 
candidates for CECT.  An additional limitation of CECT in the assessment of liver tumor ablations is that once ablated, the tumor is  usually difficult to distinguish from the 
surrounding ablated normal liver tissue.  Cons equently, direct visualization of the 
ablation margin is often not possible using CECT .  US is even less effective in assessing 
ablation results in that tumor visibility is  rapidly obscured by the developing ablation 
zone and the ablation zone margins are usually indistinct.  For liver tumors, MRI performs better in depicting not only the exact  borders of the ablation zone, but also in 
showing the residual tumor.  As a result, 24- hour follow-up MRI with contrast can be an 
effective method for confirming the thickness or size of the ablation margin.  Follow-up 
MRI, however, does not allow for intra-proce dural assessment of ablation results during 
US, CT, or PET/CT-guided ablations that might prompt immediate further treatment 
while the patient is still on the scanner table. 
• An effective imaging technique for monitori ng ablations that can be safely performed 
repeatedly during ablation procedures is needed. 
• We have previously shown that, during PET/ CT-guided tumor ablation procedures, tumor 
FDG activity is not dissipated by thermal ablation, whether through heating or freezing (2).  Tumor FDG activity remains unperturbe d following ablation allowing for continued 
excellent PET visibility of the tumor for hours af ter the procedure.  This unique feature of 
PET imaging can potentially be used to help  monitor the thickness of the ablation zone

8 margin.  One option is to incorporate CECT  into the PET/CT protocol for assessing 
ablation results.  In this scenario, the abla ted tumor is depicted by FDG avidity on PET, 
whereas the ablation zone is defined using CECT, all obtained as a combined PET/CT 
protocol.  The drawback of this appro ach is the potentia l for PET/CT image 
misregistration, for example, misalignment of anatomical structures as depicted on the 
PET acquisition when compared to the CT acquisition of the PET/CT scan, resulting 
from respiratory motion. PET offers an alterna tive to CECT in defining the ablation zone.  
Perfusion PET using a very short half-life radiopharmaceutical, N-13 ammonia, can also 
demonstrate the ablation zone due to its ut ility as a perfusion imaging agent.  N-13 
ammonia is primarily used for myocardial perfusion imaging, but is also known to 
demonstrate liver perfusion well (5-8). Be low are images from a cardiac ammonia 
perfusion PET study (note excelle nt liver perfusion activity). 
 
 
 
• Since all ablations, including microwave ab lation or cryoablation, reduce or eliminate 
blood perfusion throughout the ablation zone, PE T/CT can be used to define the ablation 
zone as a hypo-perfused region using the FDA-approved PET perfusion agent 13N-
ammonia. Unablated liver remains perfused whereas the ablation zone does not.  The 
ablation zone then appears as a photope nic region surrounded by radiopharmaceutical 
uptake in the unablated, perfused parenchyma.   In the scenario of a successful FDG 
PET/CT-guided thermal ablation of a liver tu mor, the expected appearance during AP-
PET would be a target pattern. The ablated tumor retains FDG activity and would form 
the center “hot spot” of the target.  The abla tion zone margin would appear as a “cold” 
ring due to minimal FDG activity and absence of perfusion by N-13 ammonia.  The outer 
surrounding unablated liver would appear “hot” due to perfusion by N-13 ammonia.  In 
the scenario of an unsuccessful FDG PET/CT-guided ablation, the ablation margin

9 depicted as a “cold” rim would either be abse nt or incomplete, indicating an inadequate 
ablation margin. AP-PET would be obtained using a radiopharmaceutical administration 
protocol identical to our standard cardiac practice.  PET image acquisition will be 
obtained dynamically, as the N-13 ammonia is  injected intravenously, using 15 second 
frames over 5 minutes.  
• The advantages of using AP-PET to define the adequacy of the ablation zone margin include a very low radiation dose to the pati ent, substantially less than a diagnostic CT 
scan and approximately one-t enth the dose from FDG PET,  using equal administered 
activity (9).  AP-PET is thus an ideal intraprocedural monito ring method that can be used 
repeatedly.  Incorporating CECT into the P ET/CT protocol could be used to assess the 
ablation zone margin relative to the FDG-avid  tumor, but is subject to the problem of 
misregistration of the PET and CT images (3).  In other words, the PET and CT 
components of a PET/CT scan are acquired at different time points and may not line up 
perfectly with each other, for example, due  to respiratory motion between the PET and 
CT scans.  Using FDG PET to visualize th e ablated tumor and AP-PET to visualize the 
perfused tissue eliminates the issue of misreg istration, since both ar e imaged at the same 
time and in the same position using a single PET scan. 
 
• Arm 2: The advantages of using FDG as th e perfusion agent for the AP-PET scan 
include that it does not require an on-site cyclotron – thus th e technique has the potential 
for wide applicability.  FDG is used in clin ical practice during tumor ablation procedures 
in a split-dose fashion, dividi ng a standard dose into two part s: one for the targeting phase 
of the procedure and one for the final assessment phase of the procedure.  This keeps the 
total radiation dose within that of a standard diagnostic PET/CT scan. 
 
• Our Nuclear Medicine physicists at BWH ha ve performed a PET/CT phantom study (see 
images below) that created compartments  simulating the expected radioactivity 
concentrations in normal liver, the ablation margin, and the tumor that support the potential of AP-PET to demonstrate the ablatio n margin of FDG-avid tumors even with 
acquisitions as short as 30 seconds. The abla tion margin appears as a dark ring around the 
FDG-avid tumor.  Surrounding normal liver remains perfused by activity.

• This study will assess the rates of complete ablation margin visibility using 
AP-PET alone in comparison to CECT alone or fused PET/CECT.  This study will assess the concordance of final intraprocedural assessment of 
tumor ablation results using AP-PET with results observed on gold standard 
24-hour contrast-enhanced MRI or CT.   
• Patients may benefit from participation in this study if AP-PET can be used 
to identify an inadequate ablation margin not evident on CECT or in 
patients who cannot undergo CECT and are scanned without contrast.  In 
such cases, additional overlapping ab lations may be performed during the 
same procedure and thus increase the chance of technical success (complete 
tumor ablation rate) and technique effectiveness (low local recurrence rate).  The safety of any additional ablation applications would be based on routine 
intraprocedural CT scans per standard practice.

The	treatment	plan	for	this	study	involves	the	non‐therapeutic 	
administration	of	a	radiopharmaceutical,	N‐13	ammonia,	one	
to	two	doses,	during	the	tumor	ablation	procedure.		The	N‐13	
ammonia	perfusion	PET	scan	is	a	diagnostic	imaging	test.		The	
tumor	ablation	procedure	is	performed	according	to	our	standard	clinical	practice	and	is	not	itself	a	research	activit y.		
The	use	of	N‐13	ammonia	to	image	liver	perfusion	with	a	PET	scanner	is	the	research	portion	of	the	procedure.		The	patient	will	receive	one	or	two	doses	of	N‐13	ammonia	(10	mCi/dose)	
for	intraprocedural	assessment	of	ablation	results.	Not	more	
than	two	doses	will	be	administered	and	one	or	both	doses	will	
be	administered	on	the	day	of	the	tumor	ablation	procedure	
only.	
 
   Arm 2: FDG is used instead of N-13 ammonia for the research PET scan.  Only one  
Perfusion PET scan with FDG will be performed.  The FDG dose will be divided, using 
8-12 mCi for targeting and 2-5 mCi for the perfusion scan.  The total FDG dose will not 
exceed a standard FDG dose (≤  15 mCi) used for routine diagnostic PET/CT scans or 
interventional PET/CT procedures.

15 There	are	no	expected	toxicities	related	to	the	IV	
administration	of	the	N‐13	ammonia	radiopharmaceutical,	however,	the	radiopharmaceutical	is	associated	with	a	small	
radiation	dose	to	the	patient.		Each	10	mCi	dose	of	N‐13	
ammonia	delivers	an	effective	dose	to	the	patient	of	approximately	0.74	mSv.		The	accompanying	CT	dose	is	0.6	
mSv	for	each	ammonia	PET/CT	scan.		Accordingly,	the	patient	
will	receive	an	effective	dose	of	1.34	mSv	if	a	single	N‐13	
ammonia	scan	is	performed	and	2.68	mSv	if	two	scans	are	
performed.		This	is	compared	with	an	annual	estimated	background	radiation	dose	associated	with	living	in	the	U.S.	of	
3.5	mSv.	No	dosing	delays	or	modifications	are	anticipated,	
however,	if	a	dose	cannot	be	obtained	due	to	technical	issues,	the	patient’s	procedure	would	be	completed	per	standard	
clinical	practice	and	would	not	be	adversely	impacted	by	the	
inability	to	perform	the	ammonia	PET	scan.		If	the	patient	did	
not	receive	the	N‐13	ammonia	dose	during	the	procedure,	they	
would	no	longer	be	eligible	to	participate	in	the	study.	
 
Arm 2: In Arm 2 of the study, FDG is used in stead of N-13 ammonia for the perfusion 
scan.  The FDG will be administered using our  standard clinical practice of splitting the 
FDG dose into a targeting dose (8-12 mCi) and a perfusion dose (2-5 mCi), so that the 
total dose does not exceed a routine FDG dose used for diagnostic PET/CT scans ( ≤ 15 
mCi).  Accordingly, the patient will not receive more radiat ion dose than they would if 
not participating in this research protoco l; the radiation dose w ill be identical to a 
routine FDG PET/CT-guide d ablation procedure. 
7. DRUG	FORMULATION 	AND	ADMINISTRATION		
 
N-13 ammonia production overview (not required for FDG production, as this is FDA-
approved for the study indication)  
 The radiopharmaceutical, N-13 ammonia, is prepared by the BICOR on-site 
cyclotron/radiopharmacy facili ty at BWH. Brigham and Wo men’s Hospital produces N-13 
ammonia in a cyclotron target by proton irradiatio n of natural water with  added ethyl alcohol.  
The irradiated solution is passed through an anion exchange column to remove extraneous anions 
and [
13N] Ammonia is captured on a cation exchange column while the target water passes to a 
waste vial.  Normal saline  is used to elute the [13N] Ammonia and is sterile filtered into the 
product container.  Sub-lots are produced each day in accordance with patient needs.  The first

Cyclotron	and	Target	Preparation	
 
Target water is prepared by mixing 145 uL of ethyl  alcohol to 50 mL of LA L water.  The target 
contains 1.5 mL of solution.  The prepared vial supplies all target-fills  for a day’s production.  
Hot	Cell	Preparation	
	
The target water delivery from the cyclotron leads to a clean hot cell (HC) where it is connected 
to the input of the [13N] Ammonia purification apparatus.  The columns in the apparatus are 
conditioned and assembled with the final product vi al kit prior to closi ng the hot cell.  Product 
vial kits are prepared in a sterile enclosure, one setup for each sub lot.

18 Target	Irradiation	
	
The process to make [13N]-Ammonia is irradiation of the ta rget with 16.5 MeV protons.  The 
proton current is set at 35 uAmp and the irradiation time is 15 minutes.  The reaction 16O(p,α)13N 
produces 13N ions that capture hydrogen from disso lved ethyl alcohol to form Ammonia 
([13N]NH 3).  At the end of bombardment, the target water is transferred and the target dried. 
Post	Irradiation	 Handling	
The target water passes through the anion and cati on columns before being diverted to the waste 
water collection vial leaving [13N]-Ammonia captured on the cation column.  10 mL of normal 
saline elutes the [13N]-Ammonia and passes through a sterilizing filter an d into the final product 
vial.  The first sub lot of the day is used only for quality control testing.

10. MEASUREMENT	 OF	EFFECT	
 
Drug response is not an endpoint of this trial.  No therapeu tic drugs are in vestigated in 
this trial.  Patients undergoing liver ablation procedures will under go follow-up contrast-
enhanced MRI or CT at 24 hours (but not more  than 30 days) after the ablation and then 
at 3-months to one year after the ablation.  While obtaining a contrast-enhanced MRI or 
CT is routinely performed by our team at 24 ho urs, there are occasionally patient-specific 
clinical factors that may make it preferable to  obtain the initial post- procedure scan up to 
30 days later.  This does not compromise our  assessment of study endpoints. Then at least 
one scan is obtained between 3-months a nd one year, depending on routine clinical 
requirements.  If there is severe renal in sufficiency with EGFR < 30, the patient cannot 
be enrolled.  CT and MRI with contrast can be performed with an EGFR ≥ 30.  The 
assessment for incomplete tumor ablation and local tumor recurrence following thermal ablation procedures are study endpoints that are not base d on standardized response 
criteria, such as RECIST.  Instead, the inte rpretation of follow-up im aging tests is based 
on identification of findings that  are now known to be specific  for residual or recurrent 
tumor.  These include new or enlarging nodular enhancing masses either in the ablation zone or at its margins.  Enlargement of the ablation zone compared to baseline post-ablation imaging is a suspicious finding.  Suspicious findings may undergo biopsy when 
possible and clinically indicat ed to prove the presence of tumor.  Progressive imaging 
findings will be a secondary criterion for local tumor r ecurrence when biopsy is not 
clinically indicated.  Other cl inical parameters, such as se rum tumor markers, cannot be 
used as the sole indication that the treated tumor was not treated completely because the marker activity could emanate from other liver  tumors or tumor outside the liver. Thus 
serum tumor markers will not provide direct evidence of lo cal tumor recurrence, but may

11. ADVERSE 	EVENT	REPORTING 	REQUIREMENTS 	
11.1 Definitions 	
Adverse	Event	(AE)	
 
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable si gn, symptom or medical condition or experience 
that develops or worsens in severity afte r enrollment into the study protocol or any 
procedure specified in the protoc ol, even if the event is not considered to be related to the 
study.  
 
• Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test  results constitute a dverse events only if 
they induce clinical si gns or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests.  
Serious	 adverse	event	(SAE)	
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any advers e event, occurring during the protocol and 
regardless of causality that:  
 
• Results in death 
• Is life-threatening. Life-threaten ing means that the person is at immediate risk of death 
from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it doe s not include a reacti on which hypothetically 
might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form. 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (i.e., the even t requires at least a 24-hour 
hospitalization or prolonged a hospitaliza tion beyond the expected length of stay). 
Hospitalization admissions and/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the 
study period, but planned prior to study entry ar e not considered SAEs if the illness or 
disease existed before the person was enrolled  in the trial, provided that it did not 
deteriorate in an unexpected manner during th e trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than 
planned). 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ab ility to conduct normal life functions. 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or 
• Is an important medical event when, base d upon appropriate medi cal judgment, it may 
jeopardize the participant and re quire medical or surgical in tervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above.  Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in  an emergency room or at home; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
Events not considered to be seri ous adverse events are hospitalizations for:

22 • routine treatment or monito ring of the studied indicati on, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures 
• elective or pre-planned treatment for a pr e-existing condition th at does not worsen 
• emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious criteria outlined 
above and not resulting in inpatient admission 
• respite care 
 
Expectedness	
• Adverse events can be 'Exp ected' or 'Unexpected.'  
Expected adverse event 
 
• Expected adverse events are thos e that have been previously 
identified as resulting from admi nistration of the agent. For the 
purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered expected  
when it appears in the current adve rse event list, the Investigator’s 
Brochure, the package insert or is  included in the informed consent 
document as a potential risk.   
 
• Refer to Section 6.1 for a listing of expected adverse events 
associated with the study agent(s). 
Unexpected  adverse event 
  
• For the purposes of this study, an  adverse event is considered 
unexpected  when it varies in nature, intensity or frequency from 
information provided in the current adverse event list, the 
Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or when it is not included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.   
Attribution 	
 Attribution is the relationship between an  adverse event or serious adverse event 
and the study treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows:  
• Definite – The AE is clearly related 
to the study treatment. 
• Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment. 
• Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment.  
• Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment. 
• Unrelated - The AE is  clearly NOT  related to the study treatment.

14. STATISTICAL 	CONSIDERATIONS 	
 
 
 
14.1 Study	Design/Endpoints 	
 
Arm 2: Study design/endpoints are identical for Arms 1 & 2. 
 
In this study of patients with liv er lesions, it is expect ed that roughly two-thirds of patients will 
have FDG-avid tumors, one-third of patients w ill have non FDG-avid tumors, and although it is 
possible for a patient to have both types of tumor,  that is considered rare. For sample size and 
power considerations we therefore conservatively assume that patients will have one type of 
tumor or the other and therefore target a sample size of 100 patients per arm, allowing for the 
potential for renal insufficiency in up to 25% of all patients (described in more detail below). Also, as the techniques focus on analysis by tumor and it is estimated that 70% of patients will 
have only a single lesion, the sample size considerations will focus on enrolling patients rather 
than tumors. Multiple tumors per patient, when they occur, will be treated and assessed in the 
statistical analysis, with appropriate adjustment  for clustering of tumors within a patient to 
account for correlation of responses within a pati ent. Sample size considerations, however, focus 
on enrollment of patients. The study design and endpoints are identical for Arm 1 and Arm 2. 
 
 
Primary Objectives: 
 1.  Among FDG-avid liver tumors, comparison of imaging techniques will be done on paired 
tumor samples using McNemar’s test, focusing on discordant pairs (AP-PET-1 adequate/CECT 
inadequate and AP-PET-1 inadequa te/CECT adequate). For these co mparisons it is expected that 
the rate of discordance will be high (near 60% of all pairs) and that differential in discordance will be large (difference between discordant pair s on the order of 50% or higher). In addition to 
comparing discordant pairs, there is  interest in being able to precise ly estimate the visibility rates 
under each imaging modality. With 50 paired sa mples in the FDG-avid liver tumor ablation 
group in each arm, visibility of the entire ablation margin can be  estimated with a 95% binomial 
confidence interval that should be no wider than 24 percentage points (+/-  12%) in the expected 
range of visibility of each modality (80% for AP-PET and 20% for CECT). This sample size will provide greater than 90% power for McNemar’s  test using a 5% type I error given the 
assumptions above about discordance.   Since both imaging modalities are required fo r McNemar’s test and the rate of renal 
insufficiency that would preclude a paired CECT scan is estimated to be roughly 25%, inflation 
for loss due to patients with renal insufficiency  implies that the FDG-avid tumor target sample 
size for this trial is 67 patients per arm (=50/ 0.75). The trial will be monitored closely for

32 potential early closure if the rate of renal insu fficiency is lower than 25% or potential extension 
of accrual if the yield of paired  samples is lower than 75%.  
 
2.  With at least 50 evaluations in  the FDG-avid liver tumor treated  group per arm, the visibility 
rates for AP-PET-1 and intra-procedural PET/CECT will be estimated with an accuracy of +/- 12% using 95% confidence intervals for binomial proportions. With this sample size, if the 
observed visibility rate is near 90%, the 95% confidence interval wi dth is expected to be shorter 
than 19 percentage points.  3.  In patients with FDG-avid liver tumors, the goal  of this objective is to assess the proportion of 
cases confirmed to have adequate ablation margins using 24-hour MRI or CT as the gold 
standard among those identified as nominally ade quate at the time of final intra-procedural 
imaging. Note that for this objectiv e, patients do not have to r eceive intra-procedural iodinated 
IV contrast, hence the reduction in sample size due  to renal insufficiency does not apply to this 
objective.  It is expected that nearly 95% of cas es will be identified as nominally adequate by all 
available post-ablation intra-procedural imaging data (i.e. standard-of- care imaging plus AP-
PET). With 75 cases per arm, this translates to roughly 71 nominally adequate cases. Among 
these cases, the ablation margin adequacy rate s based on 24-hour MRI or CT will be estimated 
with 95% binomial confidence intervals and it is expected that the adequacy rates for all available post-ablation intra-procedural imaging will be high, in the range of 90% or higher. With the sample size stated above, the 95% conf idence intervals to confirm adequate ablation 
after 24 hours will be no wider than 16 percentage points (+/- 8%). It is also of interest to 
confirm that margins that were deemed inadeq uate on AP-PET alone were confirmed inadequate 
based on 24-hour MRI or CT but this objective is largely exploratory sinc e the sample size for 
cases labeled inadequate after AP-PET is expected to be very low, only 5% of the total cases. 
Finally, it is of interest to a ssess agreement of fina l intra-procedural AP-PET with 24-hour MRI 
or CT. Concordance rates are unkno wn but are estimated to be in  the range of 50 to 80%. With 
75 cases per arm, the 95% confidence intervals on the concordance rates are expected to be no wider than 24 percentage points (+/- 12%) assuming, conservatively , that the true concordance 
rate is near 50%.  4.  Among non FDG-avid tumors (expected to be  one-third of patient accrual) comparison of 
imaging techniques will be done on paired samples using McNemar’s test, focusing on 
discordant pairs (AP-PET fused to pre-procedural MRI or CT adequate/CECT fused to pre-
procedural MRI or CT inadequate and AP -PET fused to pre-procedural MRI or CT 
inadequate/CECT fused to pre-pr ocedural MRI of CT adequate).  For these comparisons it is 
expected that the rate of discordance will be high (near 70% of all pairs) and that differential in 
discordance will be large (difference between disc ordant pairs on the order of 60%). In addition 
to comparing discordant pairs, th ere is interest in being able to precisely estimate the visibility 
rates under each imaging modality. With 25 pair ed samples per arm in the non FDG-avid liver 
tumor ablation group, visibility of  the entire ablation margin can be estimated with a 95% 
binomial confidence interval that should be no wider than 34 per centage points (+/- 17%) in the 
expected range of visibility of each modality (80% for AP-PET and 20% for CECT). This 
sample size will provide greater than 90% power for McNemar’s te st using a 5% type I error 
given the assumptions above about discordance.

Since both imaging modalities are required fo r McNemar’s test and the rate of renal 
insufficiency that would preclude a paired CECT scan is estimated to be roughly 25%, inflation 
for loss due to patients with renal insufficien cy implies that the non FDG-avid tumor target 
sample size for this trial is 33 patients per ar m (=25/0.75). The trial will be monitored closely for 
potential early closure if the rate of renal insu fficiency is lower than 25% or potential extension 
of accrual if the yield of paired  samples is lower than 75%.  
 5. In patients with non FDG-avid liver tumors, the goal of this objec tive is to assess the 
proportion of cases confirmed to have adequate ablation margins using 24-hour MRI or CT as the gold standard among those identified as nomin ally adequate at the time of final intra-
procedural imaging. Patients evaluated for this ob jective do not have to r eceive intra-procedural 
iodinated IV contrast.  It is expected that near ly 95% of cases will be identified as nominally 
adequate by all available post-ab lation intra-procedural imagi ng data (i.e. standard-of-care 
imaging plus AP-PET). With 33 cases per arm, th is translates to roughly 31 nominally adequate 
cases. Among these cases, the ablation margin adequacy rates based on 24-hour MRI or CT will 
be estimated with 95% binomial confidence interval s and it is expected that the adequacy rates 
for all available post-ablation in tra-procedural imaging will be  high, in the range of 90% or 
higher. With the sample size stated above, the 95% confidence interval s to confirm adequate 
ablation after 24 hours will be no wider than 24 percentage points (+/- 12%). It is also of interest to confirm that margins that were deemed inad equate on AP-PET fused to pre-procedural MRI or 
CT were confirmed inadequate based on 24-hour  MRI or CT but this objective is largely 
exploratory since the sample size for cases la beled inadequate after AP-PET fused to pre-
procedural MRI or CT is expected to be very lo w, only 5% of the total cases. Finally, it is of 
interest to assess agreement of final intrapro cedural AP/FDG PET fused to pre-procedural MRI 
or CT with 24-hour MRI or CT. Concordance rates are unknown but are estimated to be in the range of 50 to 80%. With 33 cases per arm, the 95% confidence intervals on the concordance 
rates are expected to be no wi der than 36 percentage points (+ /- 18%) assuming, conservatively, 
that the true concordan ce rate is near 50%.  
 
Secondary Objectives:  Within arm, comparison of local tumor progressi on rates to ablation margin adequacy will be 
largely descriptive as this study does not have adequate power to make definitive conclusions 
about progression rates. Given th e expected heterogeneity of th e treated liver tumor populations 
at presentation and potential vari ability in clinical follow-up fo r local progression, this objective 
is therefore largely exploratory. In tra-procedural IV iodinated contra st is not required for patients 
analyzed for this objective.  An independent ra diologist will perform b linded reads for both the 
final intraprocedural AP-PET and 24-hour MRI or CT to classify cases as ad equate or inadequate 
with respect to the ablation margins for both imaging techniques. Cases will be followed clinically for at least 3-12 m onths to identify local tumor progression. The method of Kaplan and 
Meier will be used to estimate the censored time-to-failure distributions for local tumor progression with the goal of estimating, in a preliminary and exploratory fashion, the local tumor 
progression rates by adequacy of the blinded AP-P ET and 24-hour MRI or CT reads.  Statistical

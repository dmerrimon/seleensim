1.0 Protocol Summary  
 
This will be a double- blinded, randomized, crossover  pilot study to evaluate the validity 
of a continuous oral sip -feeding  of stable isotope tracer method for the evaluation of 
whole- body protein metabolism . This method will be evaluated using t wo different 
amounts of an essential amino acid (EAA) + whey protein supplement  on up to ten 
younger, healthy subjects . Stable isotope preparations will be continuously consumed 
by subjects throughout visits 2 and 3 to enable whole body protein metabolism to be measured.  A DXA scan will be performed to quantify subject’s lean mass.  
 
2.0 Background  
 
Stable isotope tracers are routinely used to study protein metabolism  in free- living 
individuals  in the fields of nutrition and exercise (1, 2). Whole -body rates of protein 
synthesis (PS), breakdown (PB), and net balance (NB) in response to nutrition and 
exercise interventi ons are commonly evaluated using a primed- constant infusion of 
essential amino acid (EAA) tracer s, typically 2H5-phenylalanine and 2H4-tyrosine  (1). 
This method has many advantages. The primed- constant infusion allows for 
determination of basal protein kinetics,  in addition to  the acute  physiological response to 
an intervention, which allows for each subject to serve as their own control. Although an effective method, administration of the primed -constant infusion requires  involvement 
from multiple trained indivi duals, including research pharmacists and nurses who 
compound and administer the EAA tracer. This limits the ability to apply these methods 
in field -type settings outside of a hospital or lab. The cost associated with purchase and

260813  protocol v. 6 21Jul21  Page 5 of 13  compounding  of the tracer , in addition to involvement from multiple specialists , makes 
these types of studies very expensive and difficult  to conduct .  
 
An alternative to primed- constant infusion is to orally ingest amino acid tracers  in sip 
fashion to achieve a similar plateau enrichment . Oral bolus ingestion of amino acid 
tracer  has been used to quantify 24- hour whole- body protein metabolism in a variety of 
healthy and clinical populations for over 50 years  (3). This method is  one of the most 
conducive field- methods for determining  whole- body protein metabolism in free- living 
subjects and has minimal participant burden. However, full integration of th e tracer from 
a single bolus ingestion into the entire protein pool takes at least 10 hours. This limits 
the ability to quantify acute changes in protein kinetics of acute exercise or nutrition al 
interventions. However, ingestion of a priming bolus , followed by c ontinuous ingestion of 
EAA tracer may achiev e steady -state equilibrium similar to constant infusion of the 
isotope. Thus, oral ingestion may enable the determination of acute changes in protein 
kinetics in the same respect as constant infusion.  If shown to be valid, this method 
would significantly reduce the rigor and expense of pharmacy -prepared infusions, and 
more importantly, allow for quantification of acute physiological protein responses within 
the field setting.  
 
3.0 S pecific Aims  
 
SA1: To evaluate the validity of a continuous oral sip- feeding method  of stable isotope 
tracer  for the evaluation of whole- body protein metabolism in response to two different 
doses of an EAA/ whey protein supplement ( Low= 6.3g and High= 12.6g).  We will 
compare kinetic responses  with oral isotope ingestion to those previously determined by 
constant infusion with the same SP (4).

Institution: UAMS  
Spons or: UAMS  
260813  protocol v. 6 21Jul21  Page 7 of 13  At this visit, informed consent discussion is  held. Study staff will use appropriate PPE 
with surgical mask and gloves. Subjects will also be required to wear a mask and if they 
do not have one, a mask will be provided to them by the study staff . If a subject enrolls, 
their eligibility will be determined. Eligible subjects  will be randomiz ed and be scheduled 
for Visit 2 . A whole body DXA scan will be performed by study staff using the PI’s 
machine for quantification of lean mass.  
 
Visit 2: This vis it will take place at the UAMS IOA. Subjects will be instructed to fast 
(consuming only water) from 10:00 P.M. the evening prior to this visit. Study nurse will 
insert an IV into the subject’s preferred arm. At scheduled intervals, study staff will draw 
a ~2mL blood sample from the IV for research purposes , warming the arm by means of 
a heating pad or a heated plastic box . Blood will be transferred into a blood collection 
tube that contains EDTA, cooled on wet ice, centrifuged at ≥ 3000 RPM for ≥ 6 minutes,  
and have the resultant plasma transferred to a labelled cryo tube for freezing at ≤ -80 
degrees Centigrade.  
After the initial blood sample is drawn, subjects will begin ingesting their oral isotope preparations, beginning with a priming dose (per study -specific stable isotope 
calculations ). A timer will start when the priming dose is ingested. At 10- minute 
intervals, subjects will ingest a smaller volume of stable isotope preparations  that will 
continue throughout the duration of the study visit (approximately 7 hours).  
 Approximately three hours after study initiations , subject s will ingest their randomly 
chosen amount of SP . Blood sample collection will continue at specific  intervals 
throughout the remainder of Visit 2.  
At the conclusion of the 7 -hour study visit, the IV will be removed and a bandage placed 
over the site. Subjects will be provided with snacks and a beverage and be free to leave 
the site. Visit 3 is  scheduled.  
 Visit 3: Subjects will come back to the RIOA having fasted overnight as  for Visit 2 . All 
study procedures undertaken during Visit 2 will be repeated at Visit 3, with subjects ingesting the remaining SP amount.

4.6 Blinding  
This will be a double- blinded study. Both SP amounts are dissolved into equal volumes 
of water  so that subjects will not know which amount they are ingesting . Blood samples 
are coded so that lab staff and investigators will not know which amount of SP was 
consumed at each visit. Investigators  will be unblinded after all samples have been 
processed and data analysis has taken place.  
 
4.7 Randomization 
SP grouping will be predetermined before the first enrollment takes place. Study staff 
will document enrollment information into a spreadsheet that contains the SP group 
designations. SP labels will contain these designations. In the event that subject 
dropouts or screening failures skew the balance of groups, the groups will be modified 
toward the end of the enrollment period so that balance will be regained at the 
conclusion of the study.  
 
4.8 Study Pr oducts  
SP arrives  packaged in a small tub . It is stored at room temperature. Study staff will 
weigh the doses of SP: 6.3g and 12.6g. Prior to ingestion, SP  is dissolved into 
approximately 120mL of cool water.  This product has been approved and used in 
previously approved studies (IRB# 217658).  It is provided at no cost by Adesso, LLC 
(Delaware).  
 
5.0 Data and Specimen Collection and Management  
 5.1 Blood Sample collection  
Study staff will collect approximately 2 mL of whole venous blood at each occasion and 
place it into an EDTA tube.  A total of 15 blood samples per study visit  will be drawn for 
this study.  Approximately 60 mL of blood will be drawn per subject if they complete both 
visits 2 and 3.

5.2 Sample Storage  
Blood samples will be kept frozen at -80 degrees Centigrade or colder once the initial 
processing has taken place. Samples shall be stored in appropriate freezers in PI’s  
laboratory, located in a restricted area inside the UAMS R IOA building. Said freezers 
are monitored continuously for proper temperature and working condition. Samples will 
be destroyed only after all data has been anal yzed. All blood samples are coded  using a 
unique identifier . None of a subject’s personal identifiers are  present on any biological 
sample.  
 
5.3 Sample Analysis  
Plasma s amples are analyzed for  amino acid concentrations a nd stable isotope levels  
(enrichment) . The analyses are performed in the CTRAL  by study staff.  
 
5.4 Data Analysis & Statistics  
Separate independent sample t -tests will be used to evaluate the difference in average 
whole- body  protein metabolism measured using stable isotope infusion versus oral sip-
feeding method for both the low - and high- dose supplement.  To assess validity of the 
oral met hod compared to the infusion method, total error (TE), standard error of the 
estimate (SEE), and Pearson’s correlation coefficient, in addition to mean difference 
and 95% limits of agreement (LOA), will also be evaluated for PS, PB, and NB.  Data 
using the infusion method was collected on a previous cohort of participants of similar demographics ( n=8; 60% female; Age=21.4 ± 0.5 years; Weight=73.8 ± 4.8 kg; percent 
body fat=21.1 ± 2.2%)  using the same supplement product and dosing  (4). 
 
5.5 Dissemination of Data 
Results of this study may be used for presentations, posters, grant applications, or 
publications. The publications will not contain any identifiable information that could be

260813  protocol v. 6 21Jul21  Page 11 of 13  visits except when ingesting their isotopes/SP. Study staff will wear their mandated 
masks and use universal blood- borne precautions while handing blood samples.  
Study visit areas are  disinfected after study visits as per protocol.  
 
6.2 Blood sampling/IV insertion  
Blood samples will be collected solely for the purpose of experimentation. The total 
amount of blood taken will be up to 60 mL. Subjects should have no noticeable effects  of 
this volume of sampling . Brief discomfort due to the IV insertion  is common. There is also 
a risk of possible bruising, redness, and swelling at the IV site. There is also a possibility 
of feeling lightheaded when the IV is inserted or, less commonly, fainting. Finally, there is 
the rare risk of  infection due to the IV . The subject’s he ated arm will be monitored for 
signs of skin injury. Subject’s arm will be inside a pillowcase  when using the hot plastic 
box method, with its thermostat set no higher than 55 degrees Centigrade. Heating pad 
will be used on the highest setting available.  
 
6.3 Confidentiality  
A potential risk to study participants is the loss of confidentiality.  Measures to protect 
the confidentiality of study participants will be implemented as described in the Data 
Handling and Recordkeeping section above.  
 
6.4 Study Products  
The SP contains whey protein and may contain a small amount of lactose. Subjects with 
a known allergy or intolerance to whey protein, milk or lactose should not participate. In 
subjects with these allerg ies/intolerances, side or adverse eff ects of SP would include: 
abdominal pain, bloating, rash or hives , red and watery eyes, a runny nose, sneezing 
and coughing , diarrhea, nausea, and intestinal cramps . 
 
The amino acids are naturally occurring  required nutrients with no known adverse 
effects, even at much higher doses than will be used in this protocol. They are classified

2.0 OBJECTIVES  AND  SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
2.1 Primary  Objectives  
2.1.1  To define the  Progression -Free  Survival rate  at 24 weeks  in patients with  MSl-high,  MMR­ 
D, or hypermutated  persistent or  recurrent uterine cancer  treated with single -agent 
nivolumab.  
2.1.2  To define  the proportion  of patients  who have  objective  tumor  response  (complete  or 
partial)  by RECIST  1.1 in patients  with MSl-high,  MMR -O, or hypermutated  persistent  or 
recurrent uterine cancer  treated with single -agent  nivolumab.  
 
2.2 Secondary  Objectives  
2.2.1  To determine the  progression -free survival rate  by RECIST 1.1  and overall survival in  this 
population  of recurrent uterine cancer  patients treated with nivolumab.  
2.2.2  To determine  the frequency  and severity  of adverse  events  associated  with treatment  with 
nivolumab as  assessed  by Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 4 .03. Nivolumab  treatment:  Nivolumab  480 mg IV once  every  4 weeks.  
Treatment  will continue  until time of  disease progression or until  development  of 
unacceptable  toxicity,  whichever  comes first.  Patients who  demonstrate  radiologic 
progression  by RECIST  1.1 criteria  may be  considered for  continued  therapy  (but 
not primary  efficacy analysis)  if they  are deemed  to be clinically  benefiting, 
according  to predetermined  permitted  criteria  (section 12.4)

from the EMR to answer questions in this study.  
 
3.0 BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
3.1 Rationale for  lmmunotherapy  
Cancer  of the uterine corpus is the most  common  gynecologic  malignancy with an  estimated 
60,050 new cases  in 2016 and  10,470 deaths in  the United  States  1. The current standard of  care 
for advanced  carcinomas and carcinosarcomas  of the uterus is combination chemotherapy with 
carboplatin and  paclitaxel  2 and gemcitabine plus docetaxel for uterine leiomyosarcomas  3•4. The 
overall response rate  to these regimens is  57% and 27 -36%, respectively,  with complete 
responses being infrequent and all  patients eventually  dying from disease.  More recent studies 
have used  6-month PFS  as a criterion in the assessment of  efficacy in advanced endometrial 
cancer;  single -agent  bevacizumab in  this setting showed a PFS rate  of 40.4% at 6  months  and 
overall response  rate of 13.5%5. There is  a significant need for  new therapeutic  strategies that will 
provide long -lasting  remissions in uterine cancer.  
 
Nivolumab, a fully human, lgG4  (kappa) monoclonal antibody  that binds to  PD-1, has shown 
significant  clinical activity  as a single -agent  in non -small  cell lung cancer 6•8, melanoma  9, renal 
cell carcinoma 10-12, and non-Hodgkin  lymphoma 13. While it  has been shown  that host immune 
response  plays a  role in  controlling malignant progression  of epithelial  ovarian cancer,  thus 
suggesting  immunotherapy  as a rational therapeutic  approach  for this gynecologic  malignancy14, 
similar  data in the  setting of advanced uterine ca ncer has been lacking.  In a study of  63 
endometrial  cancers, polymerase -e (POLE) mutated ultramutated  tumors and microsatellite 
instability high (MSI -H) hypermutated tumors were  found to  be associated  with high neoantigen 
loads, high number of  tumor -infiltrating  lymphocytes  (TILs), and  corresponding overexpression of 
PD-1 and PD -L1, suggesting POLE -mutant and  MSI-H endometrial  cancers as  excellent 
candidates for PD -1 targeted immunotherapies  15. This data is in keeping with  previous  data in 
melanoma  demonstrating that  an "inflammatory"  gene signature corresponds to  higher expression 
of PD -L1, which may  serve as a  mechanism of adaptive  immune resistance  and indicate a tumor 
that will respond to imm unotherapeutic approaches  16.

In a study  of mutational burden and  mismatch  repair status  in colorectal cancer  (CRC),  149 cases 
of CRC  were analyzed  by MSK -IMPACT,  a targeted -exome capture assay  of 341 cancer­ 
associated  genes.  Ninety -eight  percent of mismatch  repair -proficient (MMR -P) cases  had 16  or 
fewer somatic mutations detected  with a median number of  6 mutations (range 0 -16) whereas 
MMR -deficient  (MMR -D) tumors had a  median number of  49 somatic mutations (range  23-67) 17. 
This study concluded that using a  cutoff for mutational load, such  as 20 somatic mutations in the 
MSK -IMPACT  panel, could  provide  a highly sensitive and specific  means  of screening for  MMR 
deficiency.  While  a straightforward approach such  as this  is appealing,  a bioinformatic  approach 
to interpreting  mutational burden is likely  to more  accurately  predict tumor  MMR  status or 
microsatellite  instability (MSI).  Such  an approach to determining MSI  status using paired tumor­ 
normal  sequence data  generated by next generation sequencing has been developed  18 and 
provides  a promising  method of identifying  MMR -D/MSl -high (MSI -H) cases  that may be missed 
by conventional testing.  Phase  2 trial results  have demonstrated that  clinical activity of the anti­ 
programmed death 1 (anti -PD-1) immune  checkpoint  inhibitor pembrolizumab is enriched in  
MMR -D colorectal  and other solid  tumors 19. These  results, taken with  the data from Howitt et  al. 
summarized  above,  suggests  that selecting  patients  with hypermutated,  MMR -D, or MSI-H uterine 
cancers will  enrich for response to  anti-PD-1 therapy.  While  nivolumab has not been used  in 
uterine  cancer  in a clinical trial  setting, phase I trials  in other  solid tumors20 and a case  series 
using nivolumab in hypermutated uterine cancers21 have shown the drug to be  safe and have 
suggested efficacy in  this setting, thus obviating  the need for a phase I trial in  this setting . 
 
To determine  how many  patients  with recurrent  or persistent uterine cancer  have a  high burden of 
somatic mutations,  we have analyzed 253 patients with uterine cancer  by MSK -IMPACT  to date 
under IRB protocol #12 -245. These  cases  include 165 endometrial  cancers and  88 uterine 
sarcomas, 23  (9.1%) of which  have 20 or  more  somatic mutations  (range 20 -445; 22 endometrial 
cancers,  1 uterine sarcoma).  We performed mutational signature decomposition analysis to 
determine the underlying  mutational process in  17 of  these hypermutated  endometrial cancers . 
One outlier tumor  with 445  somatic mutations was found to have a POLE V411L somatic hotspot 
mutation  and had  a predominantly  POLE  signature.  The other 16  tumors,  including 12  with MMR­ 
deficiency by immunohistochemical  (IHC) staining, 2 with unknown MMR  status, and  2 that were 
MMR -proficient  by IHC, had a predominant MSI -H mutational signature (Figure  1). Overall, 
mutational signature decomposition analysis from  targeted sequencing data in hypermutated 
tumors revealed MMR  deficiency  even in  cases  where  conventional  testing with 
immunohistochemistry  produced normal (MMR -proficient)  results . 
 
3.2 Nivolumab  
Nivolumab (also  referred to  as BMS -936558 or  MDX1106)  is a human  monoclonal antibody 
(HuMAb;  immunoglobulin  G4 [lgG4] -S228P)  that targets the  programmed death -1 (PD-1) cluster 
of differentiation  279 (CD279) cell  surface  membrane receptor. PD -1 is a negative  regulatory 
molecule expressed by  activated T  and B  lymphocytes.  20 Binding of PD -1 to its ligands, 
programmed death -ligands  1 (PD -L1) and 2 (PD -L2), results in the down -regulation of 
lymphocyte activation.  Inhibition  of the  interaction between  PD-1 and its ligands  promotes 
immune  responses and antigen -specific  T-cell responses  to both foreign antigens  as well as  self­ 
antigens. Nivolumab  is expressed  in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)  cells and  is produced using

OPDIVO™ (nivolumab)  is approved  for use in humans  to treat several  types of cancers,  in the 
United States (US, Dec -2014),  the European Union  (EU, Jun -2015),  Japan (Jul -2014), and 
several other countries.  
3.2.1  Nonclinical  Development  of Nivolumab  
Nivolumab  has been shown  to bind  specifically  to the human PD -1 receptor and  not to  related 
members of the  CD28  family. 21 Nivolumab inhibits  the interaction of  PD-1 with its ligands, PD -L1 
and PD -L2, resulting  in enhanced T -cell proliferation  and interferon -gamma  (IFN-y) release  in 
vitro.23•24 Nivolumab  binds with  high affinity to  activated  human  T-cells expressing cell  surface  PD- 
1 and to  cynomolgus monkey  PD-1. 21 In a mixed  lymphocyte reaction (MLR),  nivolumab 
promoted a  reproducible concentration -dependent enhancement of  IFN- y release. 23 
 
In intravenous  (IV) repeat -dose toxicology  studies  in cynomolgus monkeys, nivolumab was  well 
tolerated at  doses up  to 50 mg/kg,  administered weekly for  5 weeks,  and at  doses  up to  50 mg/kg, 
administered twice  weekly for 27  doses.  While  nivolumab alone was  well tolerated in cynomolgus 
monkeys, combination studies have highlighted  the potential  for enhanced toxicity when 
combined with other immunostimulatory agents . 21 
3.2.2  Clinical  Development  of Nivolumab  
The PK, clinical activity, and safety of  nivolumab have been assessed in  subjects with non -small 
cell lung cancer  (NSCLC), melanoma, and clear -cell re nal cell carcinoma (RCC)  in addition  to 
other tumor  types . Clinical activity and  safety  information  derives primarily from  that obtained from 
Phase 2/3 studies in  subjects with advanced or metastatic squamous (SQ)  and nonsquamous 
(NSQ) NSCLC, Phase  2/3 studies  in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, and a 
Phase 2  study in subjects with  advanced or metastatic clear -cell RCC 21. Nivolumab  is currently 
being investigated both as monotherapy and in  combination with  chemotherapy, targeted 
therapies, and other immunotherapies . 
 
Nivolumab is approved in  multiple  countries including the US  for treatment  of previously  treated, 
unresectable or  metastatic  melanoma and  previously treated,  metastatic squamous NSCLC, the 
EU for treatment of  previously treated, unresectable or  metastatic melanoma, and Japan for 
treatment  of unresectable  melanoma. See  Appendix  1 for US Prescribing  Information  (USPI)  and 
Appendix  2 for the EU Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).  
Clinical  Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetics  (PK) of nivolumab  was studied in  subjects over a  dose  range of  0.1 to 10 
mg/kg  administered as a  single  dose  or as multiple doses of  nivolumab  every 2  or 3 weeks . The

geometric mean(% CV%) clearance  (CL) was 9 .5 mUh (49.7%), geometric mean volume  of 
distribution  at steady  state (Vss)was 8.0  L (30.4%),  and geometric mean elimination  half-life 
(t1/2) was 26.7 days (101%).  Steady -state concentrations of nivolumab  were  reached by  12 
weeks  when  administered at  3 mg/kg O2W,  and systemic accumulation was  approximately  3-fold. 
The exposure to  nivolumab increased dose  proportionally  over the dose  range of 0 .1 to 10 mg/kg 
administered every 2 weeks. The clearance of  nivolumab  increased with  increasing body weight. 
The PPK analysis suggested  that the following factors  had no  clinically important effect on  the CL 
of nivolumab:  age (29  to 87  years), gender,  race,  baseline  LOH,  PD-L1. A PPK analysis 
suggested no  difference in  CL of nivolumab based on age, gender, race, tumor type, baseline 
tumor size, and hepatic  impairment.  
Although  ECOG  status, baseline glomerular  filtration rate (GFR),  albumin,  body weight, and mild 
hepatic impairment had an  effect on  nivolumab CL, the effect was  not clinically  meaningful.  PPK 
and exposure response  analyses have been performed to  support use  of 240 mg  Q2W dosing of 
nivolumab in  addition  to the 3  mg/kg  Q2W  regimen. Using  the PPK  model, exposure of  nivolumab 
at 240 mg  flat dose  was identical to  a dose  of 3 mg/kg  for subjects weighing 80 kg,  which  was the 
approximate median  body weight  in nivolumab  clinical  trials. Across  the various tumor  types in  the 
clinical  program, nivolumab  has been  shown to  be safe  and well  tolerated up to  a dose  level  of 10 
mg/kg, and the relationship between nivolumab exposure produced by 3  mg/kg  and efficacy and 
safety has been  found to be  relatively  flat. Given  the similarity of  nivolumab  PK across  tumor 
types and the  similar exposures predicted following  administration  of 240  mg flat dose compared 
to 3 mg/kg, it  is expected that the  safety and  efficacy  profile of  240 mg  nivolumab will be  similar to 
that of 3 mg/kg nivolumab.  
In addition,  nivolumab 360  mg Q3W and  nivolumab  480 mg Q4W are  currently under 
investigation  in monotherapy  and combination oncology studies. The  less frequent dosing 
regimens are designed to afford  more  convenience to  the target patient populations  and allow 
combination of nivolumab with other agents using alternative  dosing regimens versus  Q2W. 
These nivolumab dosing regimens were  selected using PPK and exposure -response  analyses 
modeling  and simulation approaches  such that they are  predicted to provide approximately 
equivalent  exposures  (Cavgss)  following administration  of nivolumab  3 mg/kg Q2W . The model 
predicted that following administration of  nivolumab 360  mg Q3W  and 480 mg  Q4W,  Cavgss are 
expected  to be similar to  those following nivolumab  3 mg/kg  or 240  mg Q2W,  while Cminss are 
predicted  to be 6% and ~16%  lower, respectively,  and are not  considered  to be clinically  relevant. 
Following  nivolumab 360 mg  Q3W and  480 mg  O4W,  Cmaxss are  predicted to be  approximately  
~23%  and ~43%  greater, respectively,  relative to that following nivolumab  3 mg/kg Q2W  dosing; 
however, the  range of  nivolumab exposures (median and  90% prediction intervals) following 
administration  of 360  mg O3W and  480 mg Q4W regimens across the  35 to 160 kg  weight  range 
are predicted to  be maintained  well below the corresponding exposures observed with  the well 
tolerated 10  mg/kg  nivolumab Q2W  dosing  regimen,  and are not considered  to put participants at 
increased risk. Hence, a  flat dose of 480 mg  nivolumab is under investigation.  
Clinical  Efficacy  
Nivolumab has demonstrated durable responses exceeding 6 months as monotherapy and in 
combination with  ipilimumab in  several  tumor types, including NSCLC 6-8, melanoma  9, RCC  10-12, 
and some  lymphomas 13. In confirmatory trials, nivolumab as monotherapy demonstrated a 
statistically significant improvement in OS  as compared  with the current standard of care  in 
subjects with  advanced or  metastatic NSCLC  6-8 and in  subjects with unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma 9. 
 
Clinical  Safety  
The overall  safety  experience with  nivolumab,  as a monotherapy  or in combination with  other 
therapeutics, is based on  experience  in approximately  8,600 subjects treated  to date.

For monotherapy,  the safety profile is  similar across tumor  types . There is no  pattern in the 
incidence,  severity, or  causality  of AEs to nivolumab dose  level. In  Phase  3 controlled studies, the 
safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy is acceptable in  the context of the  observed clinical 
effica cy, and  manageable using  established safety  guidelines.  Clinically relevant AEs typical of 
stimulation of the  immune  system were infrequent and manageable by delaying  or stopping 
nivolumab treatment and timely immunosuppressive  therapy or other supportive care.  
3.2.3  Shorter  Infusion  Duration  
Administration of  nivolumab using a 30 -minute infusion time  has been evaluated  in subjects with 
cancer.  Previous  clinical  studies of  nivolumab monotherapy  for the treatment  of cancer  have used 
a 60-minute infusion duration wherein nivolumab  has been safely administered up  to 10 mg/kg 
over long  treatment periods. Infusion reactions including high -grade hypersensitivity  reactions 
have been uncommon  across the  nivolumab  clinical  program. In CA209010,  a dose association 
was observed  for infusion site reactions  and hypersensitivity reactions  (1.7% at 0.3 mg/kg, 3.7% 
at 2 mg/kg and  18.5% at 10 mg/kg) . All the events  were Grade 1 -2 and were manageable . An 
infusion duration of  30 minutes for  3 mg/kg nivolumab (30% of  the dose provided  at 10  mg/kg) is 
not expected to  present any safety concerns compared  to the  prior experience at 10  mg/kg 
nivolumab dose  infused  over a  60-minute  duration.  The safety  of nivolumab 3  mg/kg  administered 
as a 30 -min infusion was assessed  in CA209153  in patients  (n=322) with previously  treated 
advanced  NSCLC  (see Section 5 .5.1.2). Overall,  there were  no clinically meaningful  differences 
in the frequency of hypersensitivity/infusion -related  reactions (of any cause  or treatment -related) 
in cancer patients administered nivolumab over a  30 min infusion compared  with that reported for 
patients  with the 60 min  infusion.  Thus, it  was shown that nivolumab  can be safely  infused over 
30 min in subjects with cancer.  
3.3 Translational  Science  Background  
3.3.1  Mutational  Burden  and MSlsensor  (Exploratory  Biomarkers)  
As detailed  above, previous studies have shown  that a  count  of the absolute number of somatic 
mutations  can predict  which  tumors are  MSI-H or MMR -D 17, and that the clinical benefit of  PD- 
1/PD -L1 pathway blockade is  enriched  in MMR -D tumors  19. In this trial, pre-treatment  matched 
pairs  of tumor  and normal  DNA  from formalin -fixed  paraffin  embedded  (FFPE)  tissue  will be 
evaluated  by MSK -IMPACT  under  IRB protocol  #12-245. MSK -IMPACT  is a next  generation 
sequencing  assay of  410 cancer -associated  genes  performed  in a CUA -compliant  
laboratory.  It identifies   somatic  point  mutations,  small  insertions  and deletions,  structural  
rearrangements,  and DNA copy  number alterations  in the  tumors  as compared  to matched  normal 
samples.  Treating the number of somatic mutations in  each  patient's  tumor as  a continuous 
variable,  we will seek  to correlate the patient's tumor's  mutational burden with  clinical benefit  from 
nivolumab, both overall response rate (ORR) and  progression -free survival (PFS)  at 24 weeks . 
 
The MSlsensor  algorithm is  a method  for assessing  MSI,  yielding  a "high"  or "low"  result.  We aim 
to correlate the  MSK -IMPACT  somatic mutation number with  the MSlsensor  score . The 
MSlsensor algorithm  may also be correlated with  the MMR  IHC results from  the tumor . 
We will also  explore the  correlation  of pre-treatment immune phenotype (tumor infiltrating 
lymphocyte and PD -L1 status,)  with best overall response  rate (ORR)  and progression free 
survival rate at 24 weeks . 
 
All patients  on this study  will also be consented  to IRB protocol  #12-245 in  order  to have MSK­ 
IMPACT  sequencing performed.  All of  the questions we  seek  to answer  using MSK -IMPACT 
results in this protocol will use data abstracted  from the EMR.

3.3.2  Analyzing  the Inflammatory  Phenotype in  the Tumor  Microenvironment  (Exploratory 
Biomarker)  
Immune  infiltration  of tumors  has been demonstrated  in multiple  studies  to be both prognostic  and 
predictive of  response to  immunotherapies,  with tumors exhibiting  inflamed phenotypes  being 
most  responsive.  Assessment of  the immune  subsets in the  tumors will help  to establish 
predictive markers on  the basis  of pre-treatment  phenotype  as well  to determine whether clinical 
efficacy correlates with  the degree of  infiltration  of specific  immune cell subsets . In addition,  both 
PD-L1 and indoleamine -2,3-dioxygenase  (IDO) have been demonstrated to be  up-regulated  in 
tumors  in response to  immune  infiltration  and may  serve  as negative  feedback  mechanisms  24. As 
such,  pre-treatment FFPE will be evaluated  for the presence of Tlls and immune  marker PD -L1. 
Evaluation  of Tlls and PD -L1 will be performed in  the laboratory of Dr. Jedd Wolchok  in 
collaboration  with Dr.  Dmitriy Zamarin.  See appendix  4. 
 
3.4 Inclusion of  Women  and Minorities  
Participating institutions will not  exclude potential subjects  from participating  in this or any study 
solely on  the basis of  ethnic origin or  socioeconomic status.  Every attempt will  be made  to enter 
all eligible  patients into this protocol  and therefore address the  study  objectives  in a patient 
population  representative  of the entire  uterine cancer population treated by participating 
institutio ns. 
4.0 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
4.1 Design  
This is  an MSKCC investigator -initiated,  single -center,  non-randomized, open -label,  phase 2 
study  to evaluate  the activity of nivolumab in  patients  with recurrent or persistent  hypermutated, 
MMR -D, or MSI -H uterine cancer. Activity of  nivolumab will be  assessed  by determining the 
percentage of  patients who  remain  progression -free at 24 weeks (primary  endpoint)  or who have 
objective RECIST response  (co-primary endpoint).  The safety and  tolerability  of single -agent 
nivolumab in  this population  will also  be evaluated.  
Each cycle  will be 28  days (4  weeks) in duration.  Patients will receive study treatment with 
nivolumab until disease  progression,  development  of intolerable  toxicity, elective  withdrawal from 
the study, study  completion, or study  termination . Patients who  demonstrate radiologic 
progression by  RECIST crite ria may be considered  for continued therapy (but not  primary  efficacy 
analysis) if  they are  deemed to  be clinically benefiting,  according to  predetermined  permitted 
criteria (section 12.4).  
 
Safety will  be evaluated through the monitoring of  all serious  and non-serious AEs and  irAE's, 
graded according  to the  current version of National  Cancer lnstitute's  Common  Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v . 4.03). AEs will be  collected from  the time  of study 
enrollment  until 30 days after last dose of study drug  dose.  
 
4.2 Intervention  
Eligible  patients will  undergo screening  and baseline  procedures per  the Study Schedule.  Study 
inclusion and exclusion criteria will be  applied per section  6.0. Enrolled patients will receive

nivolumab 480 mg  IV every 4  weeks.  Each  cycle  will be 28  days in duration. Patients will  receive 
study  treatment  until disease  progression, intolerable  toxicity, elective withdrawal from  the study, 
study completion, or study termination.  
Efficacy  assessments will  be performed at the initiation  of study treatment and then every  12 
weeks  (approximately every 3  cycles)  until radiologic  and/or  clinical disease  progression . Patients 
who discontinue treatment for reasons  other than progression will  continue efficacy assessments 
until progression is  demonstrated . Patients who demonstrate radiologic  progression by  RECIST 
criteria may be  considered f or continued therapy (but not primary efficacy analysis) if they are 
deemed to  be clinically benefiting, according to pre -determined  permitted criteria (section 12.4) . 
 
 
Nivolumab  480 mg  will be  infused IV over 30 minute  every 4  weeks.  (A treatment  window  of up to 
3 days from the  treatment  due date  will be  permitted, provided there are  at least  10 days between 
treatment infusions .)

9.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  PLAN  
All subjects  will receive single -agent  nivolumab. Each  cycle  will be  4 weeks in  duration.  Patients 
will receive study  treatment  until disease  progression, intolerable  toxicity, elective withdrawal from 
the study, study  completion, or  study  termination . Patients who demonstrate radiologic 
progression by  RECIST criteria  may be considered  for continued  therapy (but not  primary  efficacy 
analysis) if  they are  deemed to  be clinically benefiting,  according to  predetermined  permitted 
criteria (section 12.4)  
 
Nivolumab  480 mg  will be  infused IV over 30 minutes  every 4  weeks.  A treatment window of  up to 
3 days from the treatment due date will be permitted . 
 
Efficacy  assessments will  be performed every  12 weeks (3 cycles) from initiation  of study 
treatment until  disease  progression. Patients who  discontinue  treatment for  reasons  other than 
progression will continue efficacy assessments until  progression.

11.1.1  Summary  of Adverse  Events  
A cumulative review of  available  data from  completed and  ongoing  studies was  performed 21. 
There  have been some  reports of  adverse events  with BMS -936558  in clinical  studies.  Based  on 
the nature and frequency of the  observed events, the  events  identified  as ADRs  are listed  by 
system  organ  class  in Table 11.0 -1. As there is  potential  for hepatic toxicity with  nivolumab, 
drugs with  a predisposition to  hepatoxicity  should be  used with  caution in  patients  treated with

11.1.2  Immune -Related  Adverse Event  (irAEs) General  Definition,  Monitoring, and 
Management  
 
Guidelines  for the management  of adverse events  and toxicities  are detailed  in Appendix  3. 
 
For the purposes of  this protocol, an  immune -related  adverse reaction irAE is defined as an 
adverse reaction of  unknown etiology associated with  drug exposure and  consistent with  an 
immune  phenomenon.  Efforts should  be made  to rule out  neoplastic,  infectious, metabolic,  toxin 
or other etiologic  causes prior to  labeling  an event an  irAEs.  Serologic, immunologic, and 
histologic (biopsy)  data should be used  to support the diagnosis of an  immune -related  toxicity. 
Suspected immune -related  adverse reactions must  be documented on an  AE or SAE form . 
 
Overall,  immune -related  AEs commanly  start within 3  to 10 weeks from initiation  of therapy  and 
are in most  cases  successfully  managed  by delaying  doses,  discontinuing  dosing, and/or through 
administering symptomatic or immunosuppressive  therapy, including corticosteroids,  as 
mentioned below.  Immune -related  AEs generally  resolved within days to  weeks in  the majority  of 
subjects . 
 
Patients should  be informed of and carefully monitored for evidence of  clinically significant 
systemic  immune -mediated  adverse reactions (e.g., systemic  lupus  erythematosus -like diseases)  
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center

or organ -specific  immune -mediated  adverse  reaction (e.g ., rash,  colitis,  uveitis, hepatitis  or thyroid 
disease).  If an immune -mediated  adverse  reaction  is noted, appropriate work -up (including biopsy 
if possible) should be  performed, and steroid therapy may  be considered if  clinically necessary . 
 
It is unknown if  systemic corticosteroid  therapy has  an attenuating  effect on nivolumab activity. 
However, clinical  anti-tumor responses have been maintained in  patients  treated wit h 
corticosteroids  and discontinued  from ipilimumab. If utilized, corticosteroid  therapy should be 
individualized for  each  patient. For example,  prior experience  suggests  that colitis  manifested  as 
grade  3 diarrhea requires corticosteroid  treatment.  If an irAE is  documented,  in general,  delay 
protocol therapy and initiate corticosteroids  earlier to  obtain resolution with  the possibility for 
resuming  protocol therapy rather than waiting for higher grade events.  
 
Potential safety  concerns  and recommended  management  guidelines  regarding pulmonary 
toxicities,  GI toxicities,  hepatotoxicities, endocrinopathies,  dermatologic toxicities,  and other 
toxicities of concern  are summarized below and  described in  detail  in Appendix  3. 
 
Pulmonary  Adverse  Events  
Pulmonary AEs have  been observed  following  treatment with nivolumab  and have occurred  after 
a single dose and  after as  many as 48  treatments. The frequency of pulmonary AEs may  be 
greater with  nivolumab combination therapies than with  nivolumab monotherapy . The majority of 
cases reported were  Grade 1  or 2, and  subjects presented with either asymptomatic radiographic 
changes (eg, focal ground glass  opacities and patchy  infiltrates)  or with symptoms of  dyspnea, 
cough, or fever. Subjects with reported Grade 3  or 4 pulmonary AEs were noted to  have more 
severe  sympto ms, more  extensive radiographic  findings,  and hypoxia.  Pulmonary  AEs have  been 
reported in  subjects with a variety of  tumor types; however, there  have been numerically more 
cases in  subjects with NSCLC. It is not clear whether the underlying  NSCLC is a  distinct risk 
factor, or  if subjects with  NSCLC are more  likely  to develop  radiographic changes and symptoms 
for which  it is difficult to  distinguish between nivolumab related and  unrelated  causes . At this time, 
no other  underlying  risk factor,  including  prior radiotherapy,  presence  of lung metastases,  or 
underlying  pulmonary medical history, has yet to be  identified.  
 
Asymptomatic subjects were typically managed with dose delay . Subjects with Grade 2 
pneumonitis  were managed with dose  delay,  treated with corticosteroids,  and had resolution  of 
pneumonitis within days to  weeks. In  cases  where  nivolumab treatment was  restarted, recurrence 
of pneumonitis  was infrequently  reported across the  nivolumab program. Subjects with  more 
severe cases  of pneumonitis  can be difficult  to treat. In a  few cases,  subjects who did not  initially 
respond  to corticosteroids  were  administered  anti-tumor necrosis  factor  therapy (infliximab)  and/or 
cyclophosphamide.  In some  of these cases,  pneumonitis  began to  resolve following the use of 
these additional  therapies.  
 
Guidelines  on the  recommended management of  pneumonitis and other pulmonary AEs are 
found in  Appendix  3. Early  recognition and t reatment  of pneumonitis is  critical  to its management. 
Subjects should be  advised to  seek  medical  evaluation  promptly  if they develop  new-onset 
dyspnea, cough, or  fever or  if they have worsening of these baseline symptoms. As  respiratory 
symptoms are  common in subjects with cancer (eg, NSCLC), it is  important  that an 
evaluation/work -up distinguishes between non -drug-related causes (eg,  infection or  progression 
of disease) and  a possible drug -related  pulmonary toxicity as the  management of these events 
can be quite different. For symptomatic nivolumab -related  pneumonitis,  the principal treatment is 
corticosteroids  (Appendix  3). All subjects with Grade 3 -4 pneumonitis should discontinue

nivolumab and  initiate treatment with  high doses  of corticosteroids.  Consultation with  a BMS 
medical monitor should be sought for all suspected  cases of pneumonitis.  
Gastrointes tinal Adverse  Events  
Gastrointestinal  AEs have been observed  following treatment with  nivolumab . l\t1ost cases  of 
diarrhea  were  of low grade (Grade 1 -2). Colitis occurred  less frequently  than diarrhea . High -grade 
cases of diarrhea  and colitis were managed with corticosteroids  and, in all cases,  the events 
resolved.  
 
The recommended management of  GI AEs is provided in  Appendix  3. Early  recognition  and 
treatment of  diarrhea and colitis are  critical to  their management. Subjects should be  advised to 
seek  medical  evaluation  if they develop new -onset diarrhea,  blood in stool,  or severe abdominal 
pain or  if they have worsening of  baseline diarrhea. As GI symptoms  are common  in subjects with 
cancer,  it is important that  an evaluation/work -up distinguishes  between non -drug-related causes 
(eg, infection or  progression of  disease) and  a possible drug -related  AE as the management can 
be quite different. The principal treatment for high -grade GI AEs is  corticosteroids  (Appendix  3). 
Caution should  be taken in  the use of narcotics  in subjects  with diarrhea, colitis, or  abdominal 
pain as  pain medicines may mask  the signs of  colonic perforation . Consultation  with a BMS 
medical monitor should be sought for all  moderate - and high -grade cases of GI AEs.  
 
Diverticular  Perforation  
The prevalence  of diverticulosis  in the general population is  common  and increases with  age from 
10% under 40  years of age  to approximately  50% over 60  years of age.  Approximately  10% to 
25% of subjects with diverticulosis develop diverticulitis. Perforation occurs in  50% to 70% of 
instances of complicated diverticulitis. 27•28 Corticosteroids,  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs), and opioid analgesics  are known risk  factors  for diverticular  perforation.  27 Given the 
high prevalence of  diverticulosis  and diverticulitis in  the general population,  it is expected that 
some nivolumab -treated subjects will have these conditions  concurrently with  their malignancy.  
Cases  of diverticular  perforation  while on  concomitant corticosteroids  (6 cases)  or NSAID (1  case) 
were observed in nivolumab program. While  there is insufficient evidence to  suggest that 
diverticulosis  or diverticulitis is a  predisposing factor for GI perforation following nivolumab 
administration,  clinical caution should be exercised, as appropr iate, for subjects on  concomitant 
medications of corticosteroids,  NSAID, or opioid analgesics.  In addition, be vigilant for signs  and 
symptoms of  potential  perforation,  especially in subjects with  known diverticular  disease.  
 
Hepatic  Adverse  Events  
Hepatic  AEs, including elevated liver function tests  (LFTs)  and, infrequently,  DILi, have been 
observed  following  treatment  with nivolumab . l\t1ost  cases  were  of low or moderate  grade . Higher­ 
grade hepatic AEs, including  DILi,  were managed with  corticosteroids  (with or without 
mycophenolate  mofetil) and, in almost all cases,  the events resolved.  
 
The recommended management of  hepatic  AEs is  provided  in Appendix  3. Early  recognition and 
treatment of  elevated  LFTs  and DILi are  critical  to their management. Subjects  should  be advised 
to seek  medical  evaluation  if they notice  jaundice (yellow appearance  of skin  or sclera) or  if they 
develop  bruising,  bleeding,  or right-sided  abdominal pain. Physicians  should monitor LFTs  prior to 
each nivolumab treatment. As LFT abnormalities  are common  in subjects with cancer,  it is 
important that an  evaluation/work -up distinguishes between non -drug-related causes (eg, 
infection, progression of  disease, concomitant medications, or  alcohol) and  a possible drug­ 
related AE as  the management can  be quite  different.  The principal treatment for high -grade 
hepatic AEs is corticosteroids  (Appendix  3). Consultation  with a BMS  medical monitor should be 
sought for all moderate - and high -grade hepatic AEs .

Endocrinopathies  
Endocrinopathies  have been observed following treatment with  nivolumab (Section 5.5).  Most 
cases  were  of low or  moderate grade. The  events have typically been  identified  through either 
routine periodic  monitoring  of specific  laboratories  (eg, TSH) or  as part of a  work -up for 
associated symptoms (eg, fatigue) . Events may  occur  within weeks of  beginning  treatment, but 
also have  been noted to occur  after many months (while  still on treatment) . More  than 1 
endocrine  organ may  be involved  (eg, hypophysitis [pituitary  inflammation] may  need to  be 
evaluated  at the time  adrenal insufficiency or thyroid  disorder is  suspected) . Moderate - to high­ 
grade cases were  managed with  hormone replacement therapy  and, in some  cases,  with the 
addition of corticosteroids.  In some  cases,  nivolumab treatment was  held until adequate  hormone 
replacement was provided.  
Guidelines  on the  recommended management of  endocrinopathies are  provided  in Appendix  3. 
Early recognition and treatment of  endocrinopathies are critical to  its management. Subjects 
should  be advised to  seek  medical  evaluation  if they notice  new-onset fatigue, lightheadedness, 
or difficulty  with vision or if baseline fatigue  worsens.  /ls fatigue  is common  in subjects with 
cancer,  it is important  that an evaluation/work -up distinguishes  between  non-drug-related causes 
(eg, progression of  disease, anemia, concomitant medications, or  depression) and a  possible 
drug-related AE as  the management can  be quite different. The  principal management of 
endocrinopathies is hormone replacement therapy . For subjects with moderate - or high -grade 
events, corticosteroids  may also be  used ( Appendix  3). Consultation with a BMS medical  
monitor  should  be sought  for all moderate - and high-grade cases  of endocrinopathies.  
 
Skin Adverse  Events  
Rash  and pruritus  were  the most  common  skin AEs observed  following  treatment  with 
nivolumab.  The rash was typically focal with  a maculopapular  appearance  occurring  on the trunk, 
back, or extremities. Most cases have been of low or moderate grade . In some  cases,  rash and 
pruritus resolved without intervention . Topical corticosteroids  have  been  used  for some  cases  of 
rash. Anti -histamines have been used  for some  cases of  pruritus . More severe cases responded 
to systemic corticosteroids.  
 
Subjects should be advised to  seek  medical evaluation  if they notice new -onset rash. Early 
consultation with a  dermatology  special ist and a  biopsy should be  considered if there is 
uncertainty  as to the  cause  of the rash, or if  there is any  unusual appearance or clinical feature 
associated  with it. Other  drugs  that may  cause  rash should  be considered in  the differential  and, if 
possible, discontinued.  Three cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis occurred  in subjects receiving 
either  nivolumab+ipilimumab  and prophylaxis  with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, alternate 
dosing with  ipilimumab and  nivolumab, or  nivolumab monotherapy.  These  cases  highlight the 
possible importance of  discontinuing  suspected  drugs  in the  management of  rash. In addition, 
careful  evaluation  of potential  benefit -risk is  necessary  when considering the  use of nivolumab  or 
ipilimumab in a  patient who  has previously experienced  a severe or  life-threatening  skin adverse 
reaction on a prior immune -stimulating therapy.  
 
The principal treatment for skin AEs, such  as rash and  pruritus, consists of symptomatic 
management.  Topical corticosteroids  can be used for low - to moderate -grade focal rash. 
Systemic  corticosteroids  should be  used  for diffuse  and high-grade  rash.  Consultation  with a BMS 
medical monitor should be sought for a ll moderate - and high -grade cases of skin AEs.  
Renal  Adverse  Events  
Elevated creatinine and  biopsy -confirmed  tubulointerstitial nephritis  and allergic nephritis have 
been infrequently  observed  following treatment with  nivolumab.  The frequency  of renal  AEs may 
be greater  with nivolumab  combination  therapies  than with nivolumab monotherapy.  Most  cases  
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center

were Grade 2 or 3  and based on creatinine  elevation . subjects with a  history of  RCC  or prior 
nephrectomy did not  appear  to be at  higher risk.  Events were  managed with  corticosteroids  and, 
in all cases, renal function partially  or fully improved.  
The recommended management of  renal AEs is provided in Appendix  3. Physicians should 
monitor  creatinine regularly . As creatinine abnormalit ies are common  in subjects  with cancer and 
other comorbidities,  it is important that an  evaluation/work -up distinguishes  between non -drug­ 
related causes  (eg, dehydration,  concomitant medications, hypotension,  or progression of 
disease)  and a possible  drug-related  AE as  the management can  be quite different.  The principal 
treatment  for renal AEs is  corticosteroids  (Appendix 3). Consultation with  a BMS  medical  monitor 
should be sought for all moderate - and high-grade  cases of  renal AEs.  
Neurologic  Adverse  Events  
Neurologic  AEs have been uncommonly  observed following treatment with  nivolumab.  The 
frequency of  neurologic  AEs may  be greater with nivolumab +  ipilimu mab combination therapies 
than with nivolumab monotherapy  or other  nivolumab combinations.  Neurologic  AEs can manifest 
as central  abnormalities  (eg, aseptic meningitis, encephalopathy, or encephalitis)  or peripheral 
sensory/motor neuropathies  (eg, Guillain -Barre Syndrome, myasthenia gravis complicated with 
sepsis and fatality).  
 
The recommended management of  neurologic  AEs is provided in Appendix  3. Early recognition 
and treatment of  neurologic  AEs is  critical to  its management. Subjects  should be  advised to  seek 
medical evaluation  if they notice impairment in  motor function (eg, weakness), changes in 
sensation (eg, numbness), or symptoms suggestive  of possible central nervous system 
abnormalities such  as new headache or mental status changes. As neurologic  symptoms can  be 
common  in subjects with  cancer,  it is important that an  evaluation/work -up distinguishes  between 
non-drug-related  causes  (eg, progression  of disease,  concomitant  medications, or infection) and  a 
possible drug -related AE as  the management can  be quite different. The  principal treatments for 
neurologic  toxicity are  dose  delay, corticosteroids,  and IV immunoglobulin  as outlined in  the safety 
algorithm (Appendix  3). For high-grade related neurological  AEs,  nivolumab  should be 
discontinued.  Consultation with a BMS medical monitor should be sought for  all moderate - and 
high-grade cases of neurologic  AEs. 
 
Lipase/Amylase  Elevations  
Asymptomatic elevations  in lipase  and amylase have been reported. In monotherapy studies, 
lipase  and amylase  levels were  not systematically  monitored, so an  estimate of  the frequency of 
asymptomatic lipase/amylase  elevations  is unknown. In studies  evaluating  the safety of  the 
nivolumab + ipilimumab combination in multiple tumor types, lipase  and amylase levels were 
systematically  monitored,  and elevations  in any grade  of lipase/amylase  were  consistently  noted 
in approximately  10% to 30% of subjects.  Very  few subjects  reported  associated  symptoms  (eg, 
abdominal pain)  or radiographic findings  (eg, stranding) consistent  with pancreatitis.  Thus, there 
does not seem  to be  clinical significance to  the elevated laboratory  values . 
 
As lipase/amylase  abnormalities  are not uncommon  in subjects  with cancer,  it is important that  an 
evaluation/work -up distinguishes between non -drug-related causes (eg, progression of  disease, 
concomitant medications, or alcohol) and a  possible drug -related cause  as the management can 
be quite different. The recommended management  of nivolumab -related elevated  lipase/amylase 
values centers around close  observation. Physicians should ensure that subjects  have no 
associated  symptoms  consistent  with pancreatitis,  such  as abdominal  pain.  Corticosteroids  do not 
seem  to alter the  natural history of  lipase/amylase  elevations . Laboratory  values tend to  fluctuate 
on a day -to-day basis  and eventually  return  to baseline or low grade over  the course of  weeks, 
whether or not subjects receive corticosteroids.  Asymptomatic elevations  should be  monitored

approximately  on a biweekly basis, and  nivolumab  should be  held per protocol instructions.  For 
sustained asymptomatic Grade  4 elevations,  nivolumab should  be discontinued  per protocol 
instructions. For subjects with elevated lipase/amylase  and symptoms consistent with  possible 
pancreatitis,  nivolumab should  be discontinued, and  consultation with  a gastroenterologist  should 
be considered . Consultation  with a BMS medical monitor should be sought for all high -grade 
cases of elevated lipase/amylase . 
 
Uveitis  and Visual  Com aints  
Immune therapies  have been uncommonly associated with visual complaints . Inflammation  of 
components within the  eye (eg,  uveitis)  is an uncommon,  but clinically important, event. Uveitis 
may occur  more  frequently  with nivolumab +  ipilimumab  combination  therapy than with nivolumab 
monotherapy or nivolumab in  combination with other therapies. An ophthalmologist should 
evaluate  visual  complaints with examination of  the conjunctiva, anterior and  posterior  chambers, 
and retina. Topical corticosteroids  may be used  to manage low -grade events.  Low-grade events 
that do  not resolve and high -grade  events should be managed with systemic corticosteroids.  
Consultation with  a BMS medical monitor should be  sought for a ll cases  of ocular inflammatory 
events.  Complaints of  double vision should  also prompt  medical  evaluation.  In addition to  ocular 
inflammatory events, a work -up should also consider pituitary inflammation  as a cause . 
 
Infusion  Reactions  
Infusion reactions, including high -grade hypersensitivity reactions,  following  administration  of 
nivolumab are  uncommon.  Investigators  are advised  to monitor  for fever,  chills,  shakes,  itching, 
rash,  hypertension or hypotension, or  difficulty in  breathing during and immediately after 
administration of nivolumab.  
Dose  Modifications : dose  reductions or  dose  escalations are  not permitted. 
Dose Delay Criteria  
Because  of the potential  for clinically  meaningful  nivolumab -related  AEs requiring early  
recognition and  prompt  intervention,  management  algorithms have  been  developed  for suspected 
AEs of  selected categories. [see  current  Investigator  Brochure and Appendix  for citation 
examples) . 
 
Dose  delay criteria apply for  all drug-related  adverse events  (regardless  of whether  or not the 
event  is attributed  to nivolumab).  All study  drugs  must  be delayed until  treatment  can resume.  
 
Dose  delay  criteria apply for  all drug-related AEs . Nivolumab must  be delayed until  treatment can 
resume . 
 
Nivolumab  administration  should  be delayed  for the following:  
Any Grade  2 non-skin,  drug -related  AE, with the following  exceptions:  
• Grade  2 drug-related  fatigue  or laboratory  abnormalities  do not require  a treatment  delay  
• Any Grade  3 skin,  drug-related  AE 
 
Any Grade  3 drug-related  laboratory  abnormality,  with the following exceptions  for lymphopenia, 
leukopenia,  AST, ALT, total bilirubin,  or asymptomatic amylase  or lipase:  
• Grade  3 lymphopenia  or leukopenia  does  not require  dose  delay.  
• If a subject  enrolled  with a baseline AST,  ALT, or total  bilirubin  that was within  normal  limits,  and 
develops  new Grade 2 AST,  ALT, or bilirubin  toxicity delay  dosing until less  than or equal to 
grade 1 .

• If a subject  enrolled  with a baseline AST,  ALT, or total  bilirubin  greater than  normal  but less  than 
or equal to  Grade 1 toxicity range, and develops  a new Grade  3 AST, ALT, or bilirubin  toxicity, 
delay dosing until less than equal to grade 1.  
• Any Grade  3 drug-related  amylase  or lipase  abnormality  that is not associated  with symptoms 
or clinical manifestations  of pancreatitis  does  not require  dose delay.  The Investigator  should  be 
consulted  for such  Grade  3 amylase  or lipase  abnormalities . 
Any AE, laboratory  abnormality,  or intercurrent  illness  which,  in the judgment of  the investigator 
warrants delaying  the dose  of study medication.  
 
Subjects  who require delay of nivolumab should  be re-evaluated  weekly or  more  frequently  if 
clinically indicated and  resume  nivolumab dosing when re -treatment criteria are met.  
Criteria  to Resume  Treatment  
Subjects  may resume  treatment  with study drug  when  the drug-related  AE(s)  resolve  to Grade  :51 
or baseline value, with the following exceptions:  
• Subjects  may resume  treatment  in the presence  of Grade  2 fatigue  
• Subjects who  have  not experienced  a Grade 3  drug-related skin AE  may resume  treatment in 
the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity.  
11.1.3  Overdose,  Warnings,  and Precautions  
There is no  available  information concerning overdose with nivolumab.  Depending on  the 
symptoms  and/or  signs  leading to  the suspicion  of overdose, supportive medical  management 
should be provided.  There is  no specific antidote.  
 
Overdose  
 
An overdose is defined as the  accidental or intentional  administration  of any dose  of a product 
that is considered both excessive  and medically  important. All occurrences of  overdose  must  be 
reported  as an SAE.  
Other  Safety  Considerations  
Any significant worsening  noted  during interim or  final physical  examinations, electrocardiograms, 
x rays,  and any other potential  safety  assessments, whether  or not these  procedures are  required 
by the  protocol, should also  be recorded as a  nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate,  and 
reported accordingly.  
12.0 CRITERIA  FOR  THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
Antitumor  Effect  
Response  and progression will be  evaluated  in this  study using  the new international  criteria 
proposed by the  revised Response  Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)  guideline 
(version 1.1) [22] . Changes in the  largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of  the tumor 
lesions  and the shortest  diameter in  the case  of malignant lymph nodes are  used  in the RECIST 
criteria.

12.1 Definitions  
 
Evaluable  for toxicity . All patients  who receive  at least  one dose  of nivolumab  will be  evaluable  for 
toxicity.  Patients will be  considered evaluable  for toxicity from  the time  of their first  treatment on 
study.  
 
Evaluable  for objective response . Only  those patients  who have measurable disease  present at 
baseline, have received  at least  one dose  of therapy,  and have had their  disease  reevaluated  will 
be considered evaluable  for response. These patients will have their response classified 
according to  the definitions  stated  below . (Note: Patients who  exhibit  objective disease 
progression prior to  the end of cycle  1 will also be  considered evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable  Non-Target  Disease  Response . Patients who  have lesions  present  at baseline that are 
evaluable  but do not  meet  the definitions  of measurable disease,  have received  at least  one dose 
of therapy, and have had  their disease reevaluated will be  considered evaluable  for non -target 
disease. The response assessment is  based on  the presence, absence, or unequivocal 
progression of the lesions.  
 
12.2 Disease  Parameters  
 
Measurable  disease . Measurable  lesions are  defined as  those  that can  be accurately measured  in 
at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20  mm by chest x -ray, as >10  mm 
with CT scan,  or >10 mm with calipers by clinical  exam. All tumor measurements  must  be 
recorded in millimeters  (or decimal  fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note : Tumor lesions  that are  situated in  a previously  irradiated area  will not be considered 
measurable unless  progression is  documented or  a biopsy  is obtained to confirm  persistence  at 
least 90  days following completion of radiation therapy.  
 
Malignant  lymph  nodes . To be considered pathologically enlarged and  measurable, a  lymph node 
must  be >15 mm in short axis when assessed  by CT scan  (CT scan  slice thickness recommended 
to be no  greater  than 5 mm).  At baseline  and in follow -up, only the short axis  will be  measured 
and followed.  
Non-measurable disease . All other lesions (or sites  of disease),  including  small  lesions (longest 
diameter <10  mm or pathological  lymph nodes with;:::  10 to <15 mm  short axis), are  considered 
non-measurable  disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal  disease, ascites,  pleural/pericardia! 
effusions,  lymphangitis  cutis/pulmonitis,  inflammatory  breast  disease,  and abdominal masses  (not 
followed by CT or MRI),  are considered as non -measurable.  
 
Note : Cystic  lesions  that meet  the criteria  for radiographically  defined  simple  cysts  should  
not be considered  as malignant lesions (neither measurable  nor non -measurable)  since 
they are, by definition,  simple cysts.  
 
'Cystic lesions' thought  to represent cystic metastases can  be considered as  measurable 
lesions,  if they meet  the definition  of measurability  described  above. However,  if non-cystic 
lesions are  present in the  same  patient, these  are preferred for selection as target  lesions.

IRB Number: 17 -180 A(10)

Target lesions. All  measurable  lesions up to  a maximum of 2  lesions per organ and 5  lesions in 
total, representative  of all involved  organs,  should  be identified as  target lesions  and recorded and 
measured  at baseline. Target  lesions  should be  selected on  the basis  of their size  (lesions  with 
the longest  diameter),  be representative  of all involved  organs, but in  addition  should be those 
that lend themselves to  reproducible  repeated measurements . It may be the case  that, on 
occasion,  the largest lesion does not lend itself to  reproducible  measurement in  which 
circumstance the  next largest lesion which can be  measured  reproducibly  should be selected. A 
sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short  axis for nodal lesions)  for all  target 
lesions will  be calculated and  reported as the baseline su m diameters . If lymph nodes are  to be 
included  in the sum,  then only the short  axis is added  into the sum . The baseline sum diameters 
will be used  as reference to  further  characterize any  objective  tumor  regression  in the 
measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target  lesions . All other  lesions (or sites  of disease) including any measurable  lesions over 
and above the 5  target lesions should be  identified  as non -target  lesions and  should also  be 
recorded at  baseline . Measurements  of these lesions  are not required,  but the  presence, 
absence, or  in rare cases  unequivocal  progression of  each  should be  noted throughout  follow -up. 
12.3 Methods  for Evaluation  of Measurable  Disease  
All measurements should be  taken and recorded in  metric  notation  using a  ruler or calipers . All 
baseline evaluations  should be performed as  closely as possible  to the beginning of treatment 
and never more than 4 weeks  before the beginning of the  treatment.  The same  method of 
assessment  and the same  technique  should  be used  to characterize  each  identified  and reported 
lesion  at baseline  and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation  is preferred to evaluation by 
clinical  examination unless the  lesion(s) being followed cannot be  imaged but are  assessable  by 
clinical exam.  
 
Clinical  lesions : Clinical  lesions  will only  be considered  measurable  when  they are 
superficial (e.g ., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and  10 mm diameter  as assessed 
using calipers  (e.g., skin  nodules). In the case  of skin  lesions, documentation by color 
photography,  including  a ruler to estimate  the size  of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest  x-ray: Lesions on  chest  x-ray are  acceptable  as measurable lesions  when they  are 
clearly defined  and surrounded by  aerated lung. However,  CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional  CT and MRI: This guideline  has defined  measurability  of lesions on  CT scan  
based  on the assumption  that CT  slice thickness is 5  mm or less. If CT scans  have slice  thickness 
greater  than 5 mm, the minimum size  for a measurable  lesion should be twice  the slice  thickness . 
MRI is also acceptable in  certain situations (e.g. for body scans),  but NOT  lung.  
CA125 : CA125 alone cannot  be used  to assess  response . If CA125 is  initially  above the  upper 
normal limit, it must  normalize  for a patient to be  considered in complete  clinical response . 
 
12.4 Response Criteria  
Evaluation  of Target  Lesions  
Com  ete Response  (CR) : Disappearance of  all target lesions.  Any pathological  lymph  nodes 
(whether target or non -target)  must  have reduction in  short axis to <10 mm.  
 
Partial Response  (PR) : At least  a 30% decrease  in the  sum of the diameters of target  lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center 
IRB Number: 17 -180 A(10)  
Approval  date:  07-Sep-2021  
Page  30 of 44  
 
 
 
Progressive Disease  (PD):  At least a 20% increase  in the  sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest  sum on study (this  includes  the baseline  sum if that is the 
smallest  on study) . In addition  to the  relative increase of  20%, the  sum must  also demonstrate an 
absolute increase  of at least 5  mm. (Note: the appearance  of one or more  new lesions is also 
considered progressions).  
 
Stable Disease  (SD) : Neither  sufficient shrinkage to  qualify  for PR nor sufficient increase  to 
qualify for PD,  taking as reference the smallest sum  diameters while on study.  
Evaluation  of Non-Target  Lesions  
Com  ete Response (CR) : Disappearance of  all non -target  lesions and  normalization  of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must  be non-pathological in  size (<10 mm  short axis). Note:  If 
CA125 is  initially  above the  upper normal  limit,  it must  normalize  for a patient  to be considered in 
complete clinical response . 
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence  of one or  more  non-target lesion(s)  and/or  maintenance of  CA125 
level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease  (PD) : Appearance  of one or more  new lesions  and/or unequivocal 
progression of  existing non -target lesions. Unequivocal  progression  should not  normally trump 
target lesion  status . It must  be representative  of overall  disease  status  change,  not a single lesion 
increase.  
 
Although  a clear  progression  of "non -target"  lesions  only is exceptional,  the opinion  of the treating 
physician should  prevail in such  circumstances,  and the progression  status should  be confirmed 
at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator).  
Evaluation of  Best  Overall  Response  
The best overall response is the best response  recorded from the  start of  the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence  (taking as reference  for progressive disease  the smallest 
measurements recorded  since  the treatment started).  The patient's  best response assignment  will 
depend on  the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria .

Duration  of Response  
Duration  of overall response : The  duration of  overall  response  is measured  from the  time 
measurement criteria are met for CR  or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first  date that 
recurrent or progressive disease  is objectively  documented (taking as  reference for  progressive 
disease  the smallest  measurements recorded  since  the treatment started) . The duration of overall 
CR is measured  from the time measurement criteria are first met  for CR until the first date that 
progressive disease is objectively  documented.  
 
Duration  of stable disease : Stable disease  is measured from the  start of the  treatment  until the 
criteria  for progression are  met, taking as reference the  smallest  measurements  recorded  since 
the treatment  started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
Progression -Free  Survival  
Progression -Free  Survival  (PFS)  is defined as the  duration of  time from start  of treatment to  time 
of recurrence, progression (as defined by RECIST 1.1), or death, whichever occurs first.  
 
Survival  
Survival is  defined as the  duration of time  from start  of treatment to  time of death or  the date  of 
last contact  
Permitted Deviations  from  RECIST  
The study's efficacy  objectives  will be evaluated according to  the standard, unmodified RECIST 
v1.1 criteria  described above, and  that, within the  context  of this  protocol,  the only purpose of  the *** In exceptional  circumstances,  unequivocal  progression  in non-target  lesions  may be 
accepted  as disease  progression.  
 
Note:  Patients with  a global deterioration of health status  requiring discontinuation  of treatment without objective 
evidence of disease progression at that time  should be reported as"  symptomatic deterioration."  Every  effort 
should be made  to document  the objective  progress  ion even after discontinuation of treatment.

modifications  to the criteria  is to allow  certain  patients  to continue the  study  treatment  despite 
meeting RECIST criteria for progression of disease.  
 
The response  to immunotherapy  may differ from  the typical  responses observed with  cytotoxic 
chemotherapy including the following (Wolchoket al 200 9, Nishino et  al 2013):  
• Response  to immunotherapy  may be delayed  
• Response  to immunotherapy  may occur  after POD  by conventional  criteria  
• The appearance  of new lesions  may not represent  POD  with immunotherapy  
• SD while  on immunotherapy  may be durable  and represent  clinical  benefit.  
 
As long as  they are receiving treatment on  protocol, patients  will be permitted  to continue study 
treatment after RECIST v 1 .1 criteria for  POD  are met at the  first 12  week(+/ - 7 days) CT if they 
meet all of the following criteria : 
• No decrease  in performance  status  
• No requirement  for immediate  alternative  treatment  or urgent  palliative  treatment  
• Progression  limited  to an increase  of 40% in the sum of diameters  of target  lesions  
• No more  than 4 new lesions  included  in the sum.  
 
For patients  who continue  treatment in  the case  of radiologic  progression at  the first  12 week 
(+/- 7 days) CT:  
• At any subsequent CT  scan  patients  who have stable  disease  as compared  to the  12 week 
(+/- 7 days) CT  scan  will be allowed to continue  on study treatment.  
• Patients who  continue treatment in  the case  of radiologic  progression at  the first 12 week  (+/- 
7 days) CT, and  later experience  a PR or CR  (as compared  to baseline  CT) will be  recorded 
as delayed responses.  
 
lv1odification of RECIST  as described  may discourage  the early  discontinuation  of Nivolumab  and 
provide a  more  complete  evaluation  of its anti-tumor activity than  would be  seen  with conventional 
response  criteria.  Nonetheless, the efficacy analysis will  be conducted by programmatically 
deriving each efficacy endpoint  based on  RECIST v 1 .1 criteria.  
 
The primary  reason  for study  treatment discontinuation  should  be documented  on the eCRF . 
 
Of note, clinically significant deterioration  is considered to  be a rapid tumor progression  that 
necessitates treatment with  anti-cancer therapy other than nivolumab or with symptomatic 
progression that  requires urgent medical  intervention  (e.g.,  central  nervous system  metastasis, 
respiratory failure due to tumor, spinal cord compression)  
 
13.0 CRITERIA  FOR  REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
Patients may  withdraw from  the study  at any time.  Any patient who  withdraws will  be encouraged 
to return to  the study  center for a  treatment completion visit. Patients  who discontinue early 
should return within  30 days following the  final dose of study treatment. The primary reason for 
discontinuation must be recorded in the medical record .

Patients  may be withdrawn  from the study  if they experience  any of the following:  
 
• Disease  progression,  per investigator  assessment  
• Intolerable  toxicity  of study  drugs  
Other  reasons  for patient  discontinuation  may include,  but are not limited  to, the following:  
 
• Change  in patient  eligibility  
• Non-compliance  
• Patient  decision  
• If treatment  is delayed  for more  than 28 consecutive  days 
The investigator  has the right to discontinue a  patient from the  study  for any  medical condition 
that the  investigator  determines may  jeopardize the patient's safety  if he or  she continues in the 
study;  for reasons of  noncompliance (e.g.,  missed  doses,  visits); or  if the investigator  determines 
it is in the best interest of the patient.  
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS  
 
This study aims  to assess  the activity of single -agent  nivolumab in  patients  with recurrent or 
persistent MSI -H, MMR -D, or hypermutated uterine cancer . All patients will be  treated with 
nivolumab at  a dose  of 480  MG given every 4  weeks, until disease progression, or intolerable 
toxicity.  The objective response  would  be considered the  best response  observed at  either the  12 
or 24 week radiographic  evaluati on. 
 
The null hypothesis  relating to  uninteresting levels  of activity was  chosen in  accordance with 
previously published reports of  cytotoxic and biologic and  anti-vascular agent activity in 
endometrial cancers.  Further details are outlined in  Aghajanian,  et al. Phase  II trial of 
bevacizumab in  recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer:  A Gynecologic  Oncology Group 
Study.  J Clin Oncol  29: 2259 -2265,  2011.  In that study, bevacizumab  was considered to  be an 
active  agent with  7/52 evaluable  patients (13.5%) achieving objective response,  and 21/52 
patients (40.4%) surviving progression free for at least 6  months.  
 
Evaluation  of overall response  rate (ORR)  
ORR  (defined as  complete response  (CR)+  partial response (PR))  will be the primary  endpoint.  A 
5% ORR  will be considered non -promising and 25% of higher  will be considered promising  for 
further study.  Forty  patients  provide  95% power and Type 1  error of  2.5% using a  Simon two 
stage design.  There will  be an  interim analysis after 23  patients  and if 2 or more  responders 
(CR+PR)  are observed out  of 23  patients then the  study will  continue to  the second stage . At the 
end of  the study  we require 6  or more  responders out of  40 patients to  declare  this study  positive 
and the agent worthy for further  investigation . 
Unacceptable  response  rate: 0.05 
Desirable response rate: 0 .25

Evaluation  of progression -free survival  (PFS)  at 24 weeks  
 
PFS at 24  weeks is the  co-primary endpoint.  For PFS rate at 24 weeks, we  consider a 25% rate 
as non-promising and  a rate of  50% or  higher as  indicative  of promising  clinical  activity. There will 
be an interim analysis  after the first 23 patients  are accrued,  and if  5 or more of  the first  17 
patients accrued are  progression free at 24 weeks then the study will continue to  the second  
stage.  At the end  of the study  we require  16 or more  patients to  be progression free  at 24 weeks 
in order to  declare the study  positive and  the agent worthy  for further investigation . This study  will 
have  91% power  and 2.5% Type  1 error  to show  activity  in terms  of 24 weeks  PFS rate. The 
study will continue if either overall  response  rate (ORR) or progression -free survival rate (PFS) is 
promising. If we see 1 or fewer objective  responses in  stage  1 out of  23 patients then we  will hold  
accrual  to determine if  at least 5/17  remain progression free at  24 weeks.  The first 17  patients  will 
be included in the assessment of  24 week PFS rate .

The overall  Type  I error of  the study is  5%, the  combined Type  I error of  the two primary 
endpoints  of the study.  
 
Based  on historical rates of  recurrent MSI -H, MMR -D, or hypermutated  uterine cancer  in our 
study population,  we anticipate successful  enrollment of  1 patients  per month yielding  a total 
accrual  time of 24 months.  If 2 or more  responders (CR+PR)  are seen in the  first 23  patients  or 5 
patients of the  first 17 enrolled  remain progression  free at 24  weeks, whichever is met first,  then 
accrual  will continue to stage II.  If we see 1  or fewer responders (CR+PR)  in the first  23 patients 
enrolled,  then we will  halt accrual  between stages and wait until we  get 24 week PFS results on  
the first 17 patients accrued  in order to  determine if  we can go onto stage  II based  on promising 
PFS.  
 
Efficacy  Variables  
The intent of this protocol  is to assess single -agent nivolumab for  activity in  patients  with recurrent 
MSI-H, MMR -D, or hypermutated uterine cancers.  There  are no  treatment comparisons involved.  
 
The principal  parameters  employed  to evaluate  the efficacy  of the  combination  are:

• The rate of ORR  and duration  of overall  objective  response  (ORR=  CR+  PR). 
• The frequency  and severity  of observed  adverse  effects.  
• Progression -free survival  rate at 24 weeks  for all patients  evaluable  for this endpoint.  
 
Evaluable  for efficacy (response  and PFS):  those  who have measurable  disease  at baseline and 
have received at least one  dose of therapy and had  at least one  post-baseline efficacy 
assessment.  Patients who  are evaluable  for response  and are lost to follow up  or die before the 
24 week PFS assessment will  be considered as  events  (failures). The primary analysis for 
efficacy  will include only patients who  are evaluable for response . A sensitivity analysis will 
include all patients who  have measurable disease  at baseline and have received at least one 
dose of  therapy, but do  not hav e a post baseline assessment of  response, considering them as 
non responders for ORR and events for PFS.  
For safety  patients  who received  at least one  dose  of therapy  will be included . 
 
Definitions  of Statistics  to be Reported  
• Disease  Control Rate  (OCR),  defined as the percentage of patients  with complete response 
(CR)+ partial  response  (PR)+ stable disease  (SD)  12 weeks from the start of treatment will  
be reported and the  90% confidence interval will  be estimated  using  exact  binomial 
proportions.  This will be  done following RECIST criteria.  
• Progression free survival  (PFS),  defined as the  duration of time  from start of treatment to 
time of recurrence,  progression, or  death due to  any cause,  whichever occurs  first. Patients  
will be censored  at last  follow up date . The Kaplan  Meier  estimate  of median  PFS will  be 
reported as well as  the PFS  rate at 24 weeks  
• Overall survival  (OS),  defined  as the duration of  time from start of treatment until the date of 
death due  to any  cause. Patients will  be censored  at last follow  up date. The Kaplan Meier  
estimate  of median  OS will be reported.  
• Duration of  response  (DOR),  defined as the  time from which  measurement criteria are  met 
for CR  or PR  (whichever status is recorded first using RECIST} until the  first date of  
documented  disease  progression, will be  estimated  using  the Kaplan Meier  method.  Patients 
without documented progression will be  censored  at last follow up.  
• Adverse events  by the  current version of Common  Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
version  4 (CTCAE  v4.03) will  be tabulated in  order  to assess  the safety  profile and tolerability  
therapy  in treated  patients.  
 
Safety  Analysis  
 
The rates  of irAE,  SAE,  therapy  completion  rate, and protocol  completion  will be reported.  
 
Safety will  be measured  by the frequency of grade 3 or 4  treatment -related clinically significant 
toxicities (NCI Common  Terminology Criteria  for Adverse  Events version 4.0),  aside  from Grade 3 
or 4 hematologic  or laboratory abnormalities,  unless they are  deemed unexpected or clinically 
significant.  
Frequencies  of toxicities  will be  tabulated.  The grade 3  or 4 treatment -related non­ 
hematologic/non -laboratory toxicity will  be estimated  at the  end of  the trial  along with  the 95% 
confidence interval.  With 40 patients,  these rates can  be estimated  within ±16%.  
 
AEs will  be collected from  the time  of study  enrollment  until 4  weeks  after last  dose  of study  drug 
delivered.

Exploratory  Objectives:  
Objective 1: Correlate mutational burden with  clinical  benefit from  nivolumab, both overall 
response  rate (ORR)  and progression -free survival (PFS)  rate at 24 weeks.  Mutational 
burden will  be measured  by the  number of  somatic mutations found in genomic profile by 
IMPACT  (continuous number). Two separate analyses will be  done for each  efficacy 
outcome:  ORR or  PFS at 24 weeks which are considered binary here  and thus the 
analysis will test  whether  the median number of  somatic mutation is different  in the  group 
of responders  vs non  responders. A  non parametric test  will be  used  to test differences  in 
the distribution  of somatic mutations in  the 2 groups (responders vs  non responders)  such 
as Wilcoxon rank sum test.  
Objective 2:  Correlate the somatic mutational burden identified  by MSK -IMPACT  with the 
MSlsensor  algorithm  score.  The MSK -IMPACT  data will  also be analyzed by  the 
MSlsensor  algorithm.  We will  assess  the relationship  between MSlsensor  score  and the 
number of  somatic mutations . MSlsensor  score  is a binary variable; any score  <10 is MSI 
stable, any score  10 or higher is MSI high.  We will test  whether  the median mutational 
burden (continuous variable) is different among  patients with  MSlsensor  score<  10 (MSI 
stable)  or MSlsensor  score  10 or  higher (MSI high). Wilcoxon  rank sum  test will be  used  to 
test differences  in 2 groups.  
Objective 3: Correlate the  MSlsensor  score  with the MMR  IHC status (immunohistochemical 
staining for mismatch  repair  enzyme proteins). We  will test  for agreement  between the 
MSlsensor  score  (binary)  with MMR  status by  IHC which  is measured  as retained or 
absent  (binary). The  goal of  the above aims  is to explore the agreement between "MMR 
IHC absent",  and "MSlsensor  score  high" and  "mutational burden high" . McNemar's test 
will be used to  test agreement between  MSI sensor and  MMR  status.  
Objective 4: Test  for association between pre -treatment  immune  phenotype (tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes  and PD -L1) and best overall response rate (ORR)  and progression free 
survival  rate at 24  weeks . Tlls and  PD-L1 are both biomarkers  without  a specific cutoff 
that defines positive  and negative . For these reasons  these will be  analyzed  as 
continuous variables.  Two separate analysis will  be done for  each  efficacy  outcome: ORR 
or PFS at 24 weeks which are  considered binary here and thus the analysis will test 
whether the median biomarker value is different in the  group of  responders  vs non 
responders.  Wilcoxon  rank sum  test will be  used to test differences  in 2 groups.

necessary  to enroll a  participant to the  study  have been completed. See  related Cl inical  Research 
Policy and Procedure #401 (Protocol Participant Registration).  
15.2 Randomization  
 
N/A 
16.0 DATA  MANAGEMENT  ISSUES  
A research study assistant (RSA) will be assigned to  study. The responsibilities of the RSA 
include  project  compliance,  data collection,  extraction and  data entry,  data reporting,  coordination 
of the activities of the protocol study team and, and  of the  flow of regulatory paperwork . 
The data collected for the study will  be entered into  a secure database (CRDB) . All routine blood 
test results required per the protocol will  be captured in CRDB  in addition to  baseline medical 
conditions  and disease  information,  response  assessments,  off-study documentation,  and toxicity 
grade  and attribution.  Source  documentation  will be available  to support  the computerized  patient 
record.  
MSK will  hold the IND.  MSK will  be responsible for  all safety  monitoring. All  SAEs will  be reported 
to the MSKCC IRB. The safety of the study will  be monitored by the  MSKCC Data and Safety 
Monitoring  Committee.  
Weekly  registration  reports will  be generated  by the RSA  and reviewed by  the Pl to monitor 
patient accruals  and completeness of  registration data. Routine data quality  reports  will be 
generated  to assess missing data and inconsistencies.  
Accrual  rates  and extent and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow  up will be monitored  periodically 
throughout  the study.  Recurrent  lapses in  data collection, deviations  or violations  will be 
discussed  with the study  team and  a corrective  plan will be  generated.  Accrual goals and factors 
impacting accrual  goals will be discussed  at the weekly New Patient/Protocol  meetings.  
If accrual  proceeds  more  quickly  than anticipated,  it may be slowed  or staggered  at the  discretion 
of the Principal  Investigator,  to account  for safety  concerns  or data management  resources.  
16.1 Quality  Assurance  
The data and safety  monitoring  plan at  Memorial Sloan Kettering  Cancer  Center  was approved by 
the National  Cancer Institute  in September  2001. The  plan addressed  the new policies  set forth 
by the  NCI and the  document entitled "Policy of  the National Cancer Institute for data and safety 
monitoring  of clinical trials" which can be found at 
http://grants .nih.gov/grants/guide/noticefiles/not98 -084.html.  The DSM  plans at MSKCC were 
established and are  monitored by the Office  of Clinical Research.  The MSKCC data and  safety 
monitoring  plan can  be found on the  MSKCC Internet  at 
http://inside2/clinresearch/Documents/MSKCC  Data and Safety Monitoring  Plans.pdf . There are 
several different mechanisms by  which  clinical  trials are monitored for data, safety and quality.  
There are institutional processes in  place for quality assurance  (e.g., protocol monitoring, 
compliance  and data  verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff education  on clinical 
research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control, plus there are  two institutional

committees that are responsible for monitoring  the activities  of our clinical trials programs . 
rvlemorial  Sloan Kettering Cancer  Center has set  up three distinct  monitoring processes for  our 
clinical trials program. There are two sub -committees  that have the responsibility of data and 
safety monitoring.  These are  joint sub -committees with  dual-reporting respon sibilities. The Data 
and Safety rvlonitoring  Committee  (DSMC) is  the sub-committee responsible  for monitoring all 
Phase  1, 2, 1/2, pilot and  non-phase clinical  trials.  The Data and  Safety rvlonitoring  Board (DSMB) 
is the sub -committee responsible for monitoring Phase 3 randomized clinical trials.  
The DSMC  convenes once  per quarter and monitors  the risk  participants are  exposed to,  the 
progress of  the study, the adequacy of the  data storage and whether  sufficient data  are being 
entered into the  CRDB.  The DSMC monitors phase 1,  2, 1/2, pilot  and non -phase trials that are 
not being monitored by  an industrial sponsor,  and which  meet  the NCI definition of a  Clinical  Trial. 
This trial will qualify for monitoring by the  DSMC.  
During the  protocol development  and review process,  each  protocol will  be assessed  for its level 
of risk and degree of  monitoring required,  and the monitoring procedures  will be established  at the 
time of protocol activation.  A detailed  description of  the data to be  collected, process of  data 
collection (i.e ., data manager  and/or data management office), database that will  be utilized  for 
data collection and storage (e.g.,  Clinica l Research Database (CRDB), user -supported  software), 
reporting requirements  of the data to  the institution (IRB), the sponsor  and/or governing agency.  
16.2 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data  and Safety rvlonitoring  (DSM) Plans  at rvlemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer  Center were 
approved by  the National Cancer  Institute in  September  2001. The  plans  address  the new policies

17.0 PROTECTION  OF HUMAN  SUBJECTS  
 
17.1 Privacy  
 
The consent indicates that individualized  de identified  information collected for the  purposes of  this 
study  may be shared  with other qualified  researchers.  Only  researchers  who have received approval 
from MSK will be  allowed to  access this  information  which  will not include protected health 
information,  such  as the participant's name, except for dates. It is also stated in  the Research 
Authorization  that their research  data may be  shared with  other qualified researchers.  
17.2 Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  Reporting  
An adverse  event  is considered serious  if it results  in ANY  of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing 
hospitalization  
• A persistent or  significant incapacity  or substantial disruption of the  ability  to conduct normal  life 
functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important 1 \/ledical  Events (IME)  that may not result  in death, be  life threatening,  or require 
hospitalization may be  considered serious when, based upon medical  judgment,  they may 
jeopardize  the patient or subject  and may require medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed in this definition  
Note : Hospital  admission  for a planned  procedure/disease  treatment is  not considered  an SAE.  
 
SAE reporting is  required as  soon  as the participant signs  consent.  SAE reporting  is required for  30- 
days after the  participant's last  investigational treatment or intervention.  Any events that occur  after 
the 30-day period and that are at  least possibly related to  protoc ol treatment must  be reported.  
 
If an SAE requires submission  to the IRB office  per IRB SOP  RR-408 'Reporting of Serious Adverse 
Events', the SAE report  must  be sent to  the IRB within 5  calendar days of the  event. The  IRB 
requires a  Clinical Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE report  be submitted electronically to the SAE 
Office as follows:  
For IND/IDE  trials:  Reports that  include a  Grade 5  SAE should be  sent to  saegrade5@mskcc.org . 
All other reports should be sent to saemskind@mskcc.org . 
 
For all other  trials: Reports  that include  a Grade 5  SAE should be sent  to  saegrade5@mskcc .org.

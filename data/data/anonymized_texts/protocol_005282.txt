Trial title  
A randomized, open -label, comparative trial comparing the incidence of hypophosphatemia 
in relation to treatment with iron isomaltoside and ferric carboxymaltose in subjects with iron 
deficiency anaemia   
Trial design 
The trial is a randomi zed, open-label, comparative  trial. Subjects with Iron Deficiency 
Anaemia (IDA) will be randomi zed 1:1 to one treatment course of one of the following 
treatment s: 
 Group A: iron isomaltoside 1000  (Monofer®, Pharmacosmos, Holbæk, Denmark, 
termed iron isomaltoside in the following) , 1000 mg at baseline  
 Group B: ferric carboxymaltose  (Ferinject®/Injectafer®, Vifor Inc , Switzerland ), 750 
mg at baseline and day 7, cumulative dose: 1500 mg  
It is intended that 50 % of the recruited subjects are women with IDA due to gynaecological 
blood loss es. 
Phase of trial 
The trial is a phase III trial. 
Background  
IDA is highly prevalent in subjects with gastrointestinal diseases and cancer, menstruating or 
pregnant women, and subjects who have undergone bariatric procedure. IDA can have a su b-
stantial medical and Quality of Life (QoL) burden on the subjects and the treatment of t hese 
subjects includes controlling the bleeding and replenishing lost iron.  
Oral iron administration is used in the clinical practice primarily because of its convenience. 
However, oral iron may not be tolerated by all subjects and iron loss may exceed the capacity 
for iron absorption. Hence, there is a need of an alternative in s ubjects, who do not tolerate 
oral iron or who require rapid repletion of iron stores , and intravenous (IV) iron is being i n-
creasingly used in patients not responding to oral iron.  
Existing IV iron complexes differ in relation to the compounds capability to  induce uninten d-
ed hypophosphatemia to a degree defined as medical significant (i.e. serum (s-) phosphate < 
2 mg/dL as defined in the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Ve r-
sion 4.0), and in the medical review of ferric carboxymaltose pe rformed by the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA it is stated that ferric carboxymaltose is associated 
with clinical significant hypophosphatemia. The effect of iron isomaltoside on s-phosphate 
has therefore been evaluated in several trials , showing a low frequency of hypophosphatemia 
in iron isomaltoside treated subjects.   
It seems as the frequency of hypophosphatemia is highest in gynaecology patients and fr e-
quencies up to 50-70 % have been reported for ferric carboxymaltose  in gynaecology patients 
with heavy uterine bleeding .  
This trial is planned to evaluate the effect of IV iron isomaltoside compar ed to IV ferric ca r-
boxymaltose on phosphate in subjects with IDA, and it is intended that 50 % of the recruited 
subjects are w omen with IDA due to gynaecological blood losses .

The primary objective of the trial is to compare the incidence of hypophosphatemia in  sub-
jects with IDA treated with iron isomaltoside or ferric carboxymaltose.  
The secondary safety objective of the trial is to compare the effects of iron isomaltoside and 
ferric carboxymaltose treatment in subjects with IDA on the following:   
(1) Incidence of severe hypophosphatemia  
(2) Time with hypophosphatemia  
(3) Proportion of subjects with hypophosphatemia  at the last visit  
(4) S-phosphate (absolute [∆] and relative [%] changes)  
(5) Fractional phosphate urinary excretion  
(6) Intact Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (i FGF23), C-terminal FGF23 ( cFGF23), vitamin D 
(25, 1.25, 24.25), Parathyroid Hormone  (PTH), and ionized calcium  
(7) Adverse Events (AEs) and biochemical safety parameters

Trial treatment  
The subjects will be dosed with either one treatment course of iron isomaltoside  (group A) or 
one treatment course of ferric carboxymaltose  (group B) as described below.  
Group A: iron isomaltoside  will be administered as a single IV infusion of 1000 mg at bas e-
line diluted in 100 mL 0.9 % sodium chloride and  given over approximately 20 min utes (50 
mg iron/min , cumulative dose: 1000 mg ).  
Group B: ferric carboxymaltose will be administered as 750 mg infused over at least 15 
minutes at baseline and day 7 (cumulative dose: 1500 mg).  
No premedication (e.g. antihistamine or steroids) is allowed before ad ministration of the trial 
drug. If the subject is in daily treatment for e.g. allergy or asthma this is not considered as 
"premedication" and may be continued .

Confidential    Page 9 of 56 Sample size calculations  
Data from a previous trial conducted with iron isomaltoside 1000 mg suggests that the inc i-
dence of hypophosphatemia in a gynaecology population with/without heavy uterine bleeding 
can be expected to be approximately 10  % (P-Monofer-IDA-01, 1000 mg; n=3/29=10.3  %, 
95 % Confidence Interval (CI) = 2 -27 %, gynaecology subgroup ; n = 1/10 = 10.0 %, 95 % CI 
= 0-45 %). For ferric carboxymaltose the incidence has been observed to be 40 -70 % (e.g. 
Wolf et al., 2013; n = 10/17 = 59 %, 95 % CI = 33 -82 %).  
The significance level is set to 5 %, and the power is set to 80 %. Assuming inc idences of 15 
% for iron isomaltoside and 40 % for ferric carboxymaltose, 49 subjects in each treatment 
group is required to detect a difference between the treatment groups  (based on chi -square 
test). 
To account for the uncertainty, and to gain more safety information, 60 subjects per treatment 
group will be randomiz ed in this trial.   
In addition to the efficacy and safety analyses performed for this trial alone, an efficacy and 
safety assessment will b e performed for the P-Monofer-IDA-04 and P-Monofer-IDA-05 trials 
combined. This is briefly de scribed in Section 15.6.  
Statistical analyses  
The primary endpoint, incidence of hypophosphatemia (defined as s-phosphate < 2 mg/dL) at 
any time from baseline to day 35 , will be tabulated and exact 95  % CI will be estimated for 
each treatment group.  
Iron isomaltoside will be compared to ferric carboxymaltose by estimation  of the risk diffe r-
ence and the associated 95 % CI, adjusting for strata (type of underlying disease (women 
with IDA due to gynaecological blood losses; yes/no) and screening s-phosphate level ( < or ≥ 
3.5 mg/dL )) using the Cochran -Mantel-Haenszel method.  
As sensitivity, the treatment groups will be compared between the treatment groups by a l o-
gistic regression model with treatment and type of underlying disease as factors and baseline 
s-phosphate as covariate and  by Fisher’s exact tests.  
All subjects in the safety analysis set will be included in the analysis. The first post -baseline 
phosphate measurement will be taken at day 1; hence, very few missing values are expected. 
If there are subject(s), for whom no post -baseline phosphate measurement(s) are avail able, 
these subjects will be set as having s-phosphate < 2 mg/dL in the primary analysis.  
All the statistical analyses will be described in a statistical analysis plan.  
Ethical aspects  
The trial will follow International Conference on Harmonization -Good Clinical Practice  
(ICH-GCP) guidelines and the Helsinki Declaration, and all subjects will sign informed co n-
sent before inclusion.  
The protocol will be submitted to relevant authorities ( Institutional Review Board  
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) , Competent Authorities , and Data Protection 
Agencies) according to local regulatory requirements prior to trial initiation.

2.1 Background 
Iron Deficiency Anaemia (IDA) is highly prevalent in subjects with gastrointestinal diseases 
such as inflammatory bowel diseases [Wilson et al., 2004] and cancer [Aapro et al., 2012], 
menstruating or pregnant women [WHO, 2008], and subjects who have undergone bariatric 
procedure [Muñoz et al., 2009]. IDA can have a substantial medical and Quality of Life 
(QoL) burden on the subjects, and treatment of these subjects includes controlling the bleed-
ing and replenishing lost iron.  
Oral iron administration is used in the clinical practice primarily because of its convenience. 
However, oral iron may not be tolerated by all subjects and iron loss may exceed the capacity 
for iron absorption. Hence, there is a need of an alternative in subjects, who do not tolerate 
oral iron or who require rapid repletion of iron stores, and intravenous (IV) iron is being in-
creasingly used in patients not responding to oral iron. Moreover, some international guid e-
lines recommend IV iron as the preferred option in the treatment of IDA in circumstances 
where there is decreased transport capacity and a high iron demand, as it is more effective and 
better tolerated than oral iron [Dignass et al., 2015; KDIGO guideline, 2012; Gasche et al., 
2007]. 
Existing IV iron complexes differ in relation to the compounds capability to induce unintend-
ed hypophosphatemia [Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Advisory Committee Briefing 
Document, 2008; Okada et al., 1983; Schouten et al., 2009a; Schouten et al., 2009b; Van 
Wyck et al., 2009; Wolf et al., 2013] to a degree defined as medical significant (i.e. s-
phosphate < 2 mg/dL as defined in the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 4.0), and in the medical review of ferric carboxymaltose performed by the 
FDA in the USA it is stated that ferric carboxymaltose is associated with clinical significant 
hypophosphatemia [FDA, 2013].  
Mild to moderate severe hypophosphatemia is usually asymptomatic, and major clinical s e-
quelae usually occur only with severe hypophosphatemia. Severe hypophosphatemia is asso-
ciated with various complications including fatigue [Liu & Jeng, 2004], seizures [De Oliveira 
Iglesias et al., 2009], osmotic demyelination syndrome [Turnbull et al., 2013], myocardial 
depression [O'Connor et al., 1977], ventricular tachycardia [Ognibene et al., 1994], proximal 
myopathy [Russell, 1994], respiratory muscle weakness [Gravelyn et al., 1988], rhabdomyo l-
ysis [Singhal et al., 1992], haemolytic anaemia [Poesen et al., 2012], muscle weakness, and 
bone pain [Schubert & DeLuca, 2010].  
The effect of iron isomaltoside on serum ( s-) phosphate has been evaluated in several trials. 
The frequency of transient hypophosphatemia in iron isomaltoside treated subjects is low; 0-
1.8 % in chronic kidney disease patients [Bhandari et al., 2015; Gupta et al., 2013; Kalra et 
al., 2016], 0-10  % in inflammatory bowel disease patients [Reinisch et al., 2013; Reinisch et 
al., 2015; Dahlerup et al., 2016], 0 % in cardiology patients [Johansson et al., 2015], 5 % in 
women with post-partum [Holm et al., 2017], and 8 % in cancer patients [Birgegard et al., 
2016].  
It has been suggested that  hypophosphatemia associated with parenteral iron could be media t-
ed by Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23) [Durham et al., 2007; Imel et al., 2011; Schouten 
et al., 2009a; Schouten et al., 2009b; Shimizu et al., 2009; Wol f et al., 2013] which is a phos-
phate  regulating  peptide hormone secreted by osteocytes.  Although the mechanism  is poorly

Protocol Version: 3.0 (amendment 2)

Confidential    Page 18 of 56 understood, it has been suggested that FGF23 leads to a suppression of renal tubular pho s-
phate reabsorption and 1α -hydroxylation of vitamin D, leading to hypophosphatemia [Scho u-
ten et al., 2009b]. 
It seems as the frequency of hypophosphatemia is highest in gynaecology patients and fr e-
quencies up to 50-70 % have been reported for ferric carboxymaltose in gynaecology patients 
with heavy uterine bleeding [van Wyck et al., 2009].  
This trial is planned to evaluate the effect of IV iron isomaltoside 1000 (Monofer®, Pharma-
cosmos, Holbæk, Denmark, termed iron isomaltoside in the following) compared to IV ferric 
carboxymaltose (Ferinject®/Injectafer®, Vifor Inc, Switzerland) on phosphate in subjects with 
IDA, and it is intended that 50 % of the recruited subjects are women with IDA due to gyna e-
cological blood losses. 
2.2 Iron Isomaltoside  
Iron isomaltoside is a complex between iron and a carbohydrate moiety. The carbohydrate 
isomaltoside 1000 is a purely linear chemical structure as shown by 13C Nuclear Magnetic 
Resonance (NMR) of repeating α- (1-6) linked glucopyranose residues. Thus, it is structurally 
different from the branched dextran polysaccharides present in iron dextran. Isomaltoside 
1000 consists predominantly of 3-5 glucose units and is prepared from oligomers used for 
prevention of dextran-induced anaphylactic reaction. These oligomers have been chemically 
modified to further reduce the potential for anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction. Thus, iso-
maltoside 1000 is not a dextran [Jahn et al., 2011]. 
Iron isomaltoside has strongly bound iron within the iron isomaltoside formulation, which 
enables a controlled, slow release of bioavailable iron to the iron-binding proteins with only a 
little risk of free iron toxicity [Jahn et al., 2011]. This allows flexible dosing, including high 
and rapid dosing. 
Following IV administration, iron isomaltoside is rapidly taken up by the cells in the reticul o-
endothelial system, particularly in the liver and spleen. Due to its molecular weight it is not 
eliminated by the kidneys [Monofer® Investigator 's Brochure, current version ]. 
Iron isomaltoside is available as aqueous solution for injection containing 100 mg iron/ml 
with pH between 5.0 and 7.0.    
2.3 Trial Rationale 
Among the various formulations of parenteral iron available on the market, iron isomaltoside 
may allow flexibility in terms of high and rapid dosing. The use of parenteral iron, especially 
in high doses, may result in better compliance, fewer visits to the medical practitioner, and 
overall improvement in QoL. However, IV iron complexes differ in relation to the compounds 
capability to induce unintended hypophosphatemia and frequencies up to 70 % have been 
reported for ferric carboxymaltose in gynaecology patients. Thus, this trial is planned to eva l-
uate the effect of IV iron isomaltoside compared to IV ferric carboxymaltose on phosphate in 
subjects with IDA, and it is intended that 50 % of the recruited subjects are women with IDA 
due to gynaecological blood losses.

The trial is a randomized, open-label, comparative trial. The trial duration for the individual 
subject will be approximately 9  weeks (including a 28 days screening period) and each sub-
ject will attend 8  visits. Subjects with IDA will be randomized 1:1 to one treatment course of 
one of the following treatments: 
 Group A: iron isomaltoside (1000 mg infusion at baseline, cumulative dose: 1000 
mg) 
 Group B: ferric carboxymaltose (750 mg infusion at baseline and day 7, cumul a-
tive dose: 1500 mg) 
It is intended that 50 % of the recruited subjects are women with IDA due to gynaecological 
blood losses.

7 TRIAL ASSESSMENTS  
7.1 Demographic and Baseline Assessments 
Date of birth, gender, race, ethnicity, and smoking habits will be collected. A current smoker 
is defined as a subject who has been smoking within the last 6 months. 
7.2 Pregnancy Test 
A urine pregnancy test will be performed for all women of childbearing potential. The test 
will be handled and interpreted by the site personnel. 
7.3 Relevant Medical History  
Relevant medical history will be recorded. Changes in medical history will be recorded at the 
subsequent visits during the trial (worsening of symptoms or diseases shall be recorded as 
AEs). The following will be collected: disease and start and stop date. Except for underlying 
disorder causing IDA, start dates occurring > 12 months before the enrolment into the trial 
should be set as > 12 months.

7.6 Height 
Height will be measured without shoes. 
7.7 Weight 
Weight will be measured. 
7.8 Vital Signs  
Heart rate and blood pressure will be measured at the following time points when a subject 
receives trial drug: approximately 0-10 minutes before infusion, during infusion, 5-15 
minutes, and 20-40 minutes after the infusion has ended. If vital signs are measured more than 
once in the given time interval, the lowest measurement of diastolic blood pressure (including 
the attendant systolic blood pressure and heart rate) for the period should be noted in the ele c-
tronic Case Report Form (eCRF). 
7.9 Electrocardiogram 
A standard 12 lead ECG will be recorded (including date, time, and signature). At baseline 
and other treatment visits, two ECGs will be recorded; one before administration of the trial 
drug and one approximately 30 minutes after start of the dosing. Only one ECG should be 
recorded at the follow-up visits. 
The ECGs do not need to be evaluated by a cardiologist. 
7.10 Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale 
The FACIT Fatigue Scale is used to measure fatigue symptoms of the subjects [Cella et al., 
2005]. It is a self-administered questionnaire which will be filled in by the subject. 
7.11 Short Form-36 Questionnaire 
The SF-36 questionnaire is used to measure QoL. SF-36 is a 36 item questionnaire developed 
from the Medical Outcomes Study in the United States [Brazier et al., 1992]. The SF-36 co m-

Confidential    Page 27 of 56 prises eight health scales, covering functional status, well-being, and overall evaluation of 
health. It is a self-administered questionnaire which will be filled in by the subject. 
7.12 Bone Pain Measurement 
Bone pain is measured as pain intensity on a VAS [Woodforde & Merskey, 1972]. It is a 100 
mm length continuous scale anchored by two verbal descriptors, one for each symptom e x-
treme; “no pain” (score of 0) and “worst imaginable pain” (score of 100). Thus, a higher score 
indicates greater pain intensity. 
Based on the distribution of pain VAS scores in postsurgical patients (knee replacement, hy s-
terectomy, or laparoscopic myomectomy),  who described their postoperative pain intensity as 
none, mild, moderate, or severe, the following cut points on the pain VAS have been reco m-
mended: no pain (0–4 mm), mild pain (5– 44 mm), moderate pain (45– 74 mm), and severe 
pain (75– 100 mm) [Jensen et al., 2003]. 
7.13 Muscle Strength 
Muscle strength is measured by grip strength. Grip strength can be measured quantitatively 
using a hand dynamometer. The Jamar hand dynamometer (Lafayette Instrument Company, 
USA) will be used as this is the most widely cited in the literature and accepted as the gold 
standard. The standardized Southampton protocol for adult grip strength measurement will be 
followed [Roberts et al. 2011]. Details of the measurement can be found in Appendix B. 
7.14 Upper and Lower Limb Proximal Muscle Function 
The upper and lower limb proximal muscle function is measured by the "1 kg arm lift" test 
and the "30 sec chair stand" test as described in Agarwal and Kiely, 2006.  
For the "1 kg arm lift" test, the number of times the weight is lifted above the head in a 30 sec 
period is recorded for each arm individually and the final score is the mean of the two mea s-
urements. For the "30 sec chair stand" test, the final test score is the number of times that the 
subject rises to a full stand from the seated position with arms folded within 30 sec. Both tests 
provide a numerical score on a continuous scale that is operator independent. Neither test e x-
hibits a ceiling effect, as the upper limit of repetitions for each test is infinite. If the subjects 
have severe weakness and are unable to perform the tests at all, the score is 0 [Agarwal & 
Kiely, 2006]. Details of the measurement can be found in Appendix C. 
7.15 Respiratory Muscles Strength 
The measurements of MIP and MEP provide a non-invasive clinical method for evaluating the 
strength of respiratory muscles, and it is the most widely used test to assess muscle pressures 
[ATS/ERS statement, 2002]. The MIP reflects the strength of the diaphragm and other in-
spiratory muscles, while the MEP reflects the strength of the abdominal muscles and other 
expiratory muscles. MIP and MEP will be measured by MicroRPM (CareFusion Germany 
234 GmbH, Hoechberg, Germany). Three tests should be performed for both MIP and MEP 
with the highest value from the three tests taken as the achieved result. Details of the mea s-
urement can be found in the following instruction video : http://www.bd-

8.4 Subject Recruitment 
Informed consent must be obtained from the subject before any trial related procedures are 
carried out. 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the Investigator should comply with any 
applicable regulatory requirements, and should adhere to International Conference on Harmo-
nization-Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) and the Declaration of Helsinki. 
Before informed consent is obtained the subject should be allowed ample time and opportun i-
ty to read the subject information sheet, to enquire about details of the trial, and to decide 
whether or not to participate. 
If the subject wishes to participate, the written ICF should be completed as appropriate and 
then signed and personally dated by the subject and the Investigator who conducted the in-
formed consent discussions. The procedure for obtaining the informed consent must follow 
the local requirements and legislation.  
9 SUBJECT COMPLETION AND WITHDRAWAL  
9.1 Screen Failures 
The PI will maintain a list of screening numbers and names of the subjects who have been 
screened at the site in order to allow for identification of records at a later date. The reasons 
for failure should be noted in the screening log of the site file and the final visit form.  
9.2 Re-screening 
Subjects may be re-screened three times at the discretion of the PI. Each subject re-screened 
must be re-consented and allocated a new subject number. All required screening assessments 
must be repeated in accordance with the protocol. 
9.3 Subject Withdrawal 
The subject has the right to withdraw from the trial at any time and for any reason without 
prejudice to his/her future medical care by the physician or at the institution. The PI can wit h-
draw subjects from the trial in the following situations; treatment failure, safety reasons, and 
protocol violations. 
The subject may also withdraw the consent if he/she does not wish to or is unable to continue 
in the trial. The Investigator will discuss with the subject the most appropriate way to with-
draw in order to ensure the subject’s health. If a subject withdraws from the trial, the Invest i-

ducting the trial if the trial is suspended or terminated due to safety reasons.  
Pharmacosmos A/S or its designee will promptly inform the Competent Authorities of the 
suspension or termination of the trial and the reason(s) for the action. If required by applicable 
regulations, the PI must inform the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/ Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) promptly and provide the reason for the suspension or termination.  
10 INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCTS  
10.1 Description of Investigational Products 
Iron isomaltoside 
Iron isomaltoside is a complex between iron and a carbohydrate moiety. The carbohydrate 
isomaltoside 1000 is a purely linear chemical structure as shown by 13C NMR of repeating α-
(1-6) linked glucopyranose residues. Thus, it is structurally different from the branched de x-
tran polysaccharides present in iron dextran. Isomaltoside 1000 consists predominantly of 3- 5 
glucose units and is prepared from oligomers used for prevention of dextran-induced anaph y-
lactic reaction. These oligomers have been chemically modified to further reduce the potential 
for anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction. Thus, isomaltoside 1000 is not a dextran [Jahn et al., 
2011]. 
Iron isomaltoside has strongly bound iron within the iron isomaltoside formulation, which 
enables a controlled, slow release of bioavailable iron to the iron-binding proteins with only a 
little risk of free iron toxicity [Jahn et al., 2011]. This allows flexible dosing, including high 
dose and rapid dosing. 
Trial ID: P-Monofer-IDA-05  
Protocol Version: 3.0 (amendment 2) 
Date of Document :  29 November 2017  
  
Confidential    Page 33 of 56 Following IV administration, iron isomaltoside is rapidly taken up by the cells in the reticul o-
endothelial system, particularly in the liver and spleen. Due to its molecular weight, it is not 
eliminated by the kidneys [Monofer® Investigator 's Brochure, current version ]. 
Iron isomaltoside is available as aqueous solution for injection/infusion containing 100 mg 
iron/mL with pH between 5.0 and 7.0. 
Ferric carboxymaltose 
Ferric carboxymaltose is a colloidal iron (III) hydroxide in complex with carboxymaltose, a 
carbohydrate polymer that releases iron. It is  an aqueous complex with the chemical name 
polynuclear iron (III) hydroxide 4(R)-(poly-(1→4)- O-α-D-glucopyranosyl)-oxy-
2(R),3(S),5(R),6-tetrahydroxy-hexanoate. It has a relative molecular weight of approximately 
150,000 Daltons [Injectafer® prescribing information (USA), 07/2013].  
Ferric carboxymaltose is provided as a dark brown, sterile, aqueous, isotonic colloidal solu-
tion for IV injection. Each mL contains 50 mg iron as ferric carboxymaltose in water for i n-
jection. Ferric carboxymaltose is available in 15 mL single-use vials. Sodium hydroxide 
and/or hydrochloric acid may have been added to adjust the pH to 5.0-7.0. Ferric carbox y-
maltose will be administered as 750 mg infused over at least 15 minutes at baseline and day 7 
(cumulative dose: 1500 mg), which is an approved treatment course [Injectafer® prescribing 
information (USA), 07/2013]. 
10.2 Dosage, Administration and Blinding of Trial Drug 
The subjects will be randomized 1 :1 to one treatment course of one of the following trea t-
ments: 
 Group A, iron isomaltoside will be administered as a single IV infusion of 1000 mg 
diluted in 100 mL 0.9 % sodium chloride and given over approximately 20 minutes 
(50 mg iron/min) at baseline (cumulative dose: 1000 mg) 
 Group B, ferric carboxymaltose will be administered as 750 mg infused over at least 
15 minutes at baseline and day 7 (cumulative dose: 1500 mg) 
No premedication (e.g. antihistamine or steroids) is allowed before administration of the trial 
drug. If the subject is in daily treatment for e.g. allergy or asthma this is not considered as 
"premedication" and may be continued. 
The subjects must be observed for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity during and after 
trial drug administration for at least 30 minutes and until clinically stable following compl e-
tion of each administration. 
Details of administration and storage of iron isomaltoside and ferric carboxymaltose are fu r-
ther described in the Drug Handling Plan.  
10.3 Dose Rationale 
In the present trial, subjects will be given a cumulative dose of 1000 mg iron isomaltoside 
administered as a single infusion. Justification for this single dose regime is found in recent 
safety data. Up to 31 December 2016 , more than 1700 subjects have been treated with iron 
isomaltoside including bolus injections and high single dose infusions up to 2500 mg admini s-
tered over 2 minutes for bolus injections and 15-60 minutes for infusions without a test dose. 
No safety concerns were found with these single dose levels.

Protocol Version: 3.0 (amendment 2) 
Date of Document :  29 November 2017  
  
Confidential    Page 34 of 56 In this trial we have included single doses of 1000 mg iron isomaltoside in order to elucidate 
the safety and effect of high doses of iron isomaltoside since higher dosing would result in 
better compliance and increased convenience due to fewer visits necessary to make the su b-
jects iron replete. 
In the majority of the trials with iron isomaltoside, single dose infusions of up to 1000 mg 
have been administered over 15 minutes. There is no apparent indication that there are any 
specific safety concerns related to this speed of administration of iron isomaltoside. In the 
present trial, iron isomaltoside will be administered over 20 minutes. 
Ferric carboxymaltose will be administered as 750 mg infused over at least 15 minutes at 
baseline and day 7 (cumulative dose: 1500 mg), which is an approved treatment course [I n-
jectafer® prescribing information (USA), 07/2013]. 
10.4 Side Effects of Iron Isomaltoside 
Side effects for iron isomaltoside are described in the Investigator's Brochure for iron iso-
maltoside (current version). 
10.5 Side Effects of Ferric Carboxymaltose  
Side effects for ferric carboxymaltose are described in Injectafer® prescribing information 
(USA), 07/2013.  
10.6 Preparation, Handling, and Labelling 
Pharmacosmos A/S or its designee will be responsible for preparation and packaging of all 
trial medication. No trial product will be used after its expiry date. The contents of the label 
will be in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements. 
Details of administration and storage of iron isomaltoside and ferric carboxymaltose are fu r-
ther described in the Drug Handling Plan.  
10.7 Handling and Storage 
The investigational product must be dispensed or administered according to procedures d e-
scribed herein. Only subjects enrolled in the trial may receive the investigational product, and 
it must be administered in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements. Only a u-
thorised site staff may supply or administer the investigational product. All investigational 
products must be stored in a secure area with access limited to the authorised site staff and 
under physical conditions that are consistent with investigational product-specific requir e-
ments. 
10.8 Product Accountability 
The PI is responsible for investigational product accountability, reconciliation, and record 
maintenance throughout the course of the trial in accordance with all applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The responsible person(s) will document the amount of investigational products received from 
and returned to Pharmacosmos A/S or its designee, and the amount supplied and/or admini s-
tered to subjects.

THERAPIES  
11.1 Permitted Medications 
Throughout the trial, the subject may take any concomitant medications or treatments deemed 
necessary to provide adequate supportive care except for those listed in Section 11.2. Any 
concomitant medications administered while the subject is participating in the trial must be 
recorded on the source document and transcribed into the concomitant medication form.  
11.2 Prohibited Medications and Non-drug Therapies 
No premedication (e.g. antihistamine or steroids) is allowed before administration of the trial 
drug. If the subject is in daily treatment for e.g. allergy or asthma this is not considered as 
"premedication" and may be continued. 
The following medication and non-drug therapy are not allowed during the trial period since 
they could potentially have an impact on the endpoints: 
 Any iron supplementation other than investigational drug (nutritional supplementation 
including iron is allowed unless it is assumed as treatment of the subject's anaemia) 
 Blood transfusion 
 Erythropoietin or erythropoietin-stimulation agents 
 Radiotherapy  
 Chemotherapy 
12 ADVERSE EVENTS  
12.1 Definition of Adverse Events 
An AE is defined in the ICH-GCP guideline as “any untoward medical occurrence in a subject 
or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not ne c-
essarily have a causal relationship with this treatment” (ICH E6:1.2). An AE can therefore be 
any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A clin-
ically significant abnormal laboratory finding is also regarded as an AE if the effect is unf a-
vourable for the subject. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to review the laboratory test 
results and determine whether an abnormal laboratory value is clinically significant. In gen-
eral, a clinically significant laboratory value which suggests disease progression and/or r e-
quires active management is considered as an AE. Clinical significant efficacy laboratory p a-
rameters (including related parameters) are not to be recorded as AEs unless these are consid-
ered lack of efficacy or overdose.     
Clinical significant findings in physical examinations and ECGs are to be recorded as medical 
history if they are observed at baseline. Otherwise they should be recorded as AEs.  
Worsening of a pre-existing medical condition (e.g. cancer or diabetes) must also be recorded 
as an AE (e.g. if there is an increase in severity, frequency, duration of the condition or wor s-
ening of outcome). Pre-planned procedures and pre-existing medical conditions (planned or 
Trial ID: P-Monofer-IDA-05  
Protocol Version: 3.0 (amendment 2) 
Date of Document :  29 November 2017  
  
Confidential    Page 36 of 56 present at the time of signing the ICF) that have not worsened are not considered AEs. These 
are recorded on the medical history pages of the eCRF.  
12.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as an AE that  
 is fatal 
 is life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death) 
 requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalisation (a min i-
mum of an overnight stay in a health care facility) 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 is a medically important event or reaction 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations 
should be considered serious such as important medical events that might not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but might jeopardise the subject or might 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  
If the above interventions are performed as standard of care and not associated with an AE, 
the health issue for which the intervention is being performed will not be considered an SAE. 
If there is a complication as a result of the procedure and the complication meets at least 1 
serious criterion, that complication would be reported as an SAE. 
12.3 Definition of an Adverse Drug Reaction 
An Adverse D rug Reaction ( ADR) is an AE that is judged by the Investigator or Pharmaco s-
mos A/S to be “related” or “possible related” to the trial drug (see classification of relatedness 
in Section 12.4).  
If the ADR fulfils at least 1 of the criterion for an SAE, it is considered a Serious Adverse 
Reaction (SAR). If the SAR is not listed as an expected side effect for iron isomaltoside 
[Monofer® Investigator’s Brochure, current version] or for ferric carboxymaltose [Injectafer® 
prescribing information (USA), 07/2013], it is considered a Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reaction (SUSAR).  
It i
s the responsibility of Pharmacosmos A/S to evaluate the SARs for expectedness. 
12.4 Collection of Adverse Events 
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs (as defined in Section 12.1) observed 
by the Investigator or reported by the subject are properly collected and recorded in the sub-
ject’s medical record as well as in the AE pages of the e CRF. 
AEs/SAEs occurring before administration of the trial drug are considered as non-treatment 
emergent, and those occurring after administration of the trial drug are considered as trea t-
ment emergent. Non-treatment emergent AEs/SAEs which are worsened after treatment with 
trial drug will be assessed as treatment emergent.  
Non-treated subjects: All SAEs will be reported in the eCRF from the time a subject has 
signed the ICF and until he/she exits the trial. Non-serious AEs occurring in subjects who are 
never treated with the trial drug will not be collected.

Confidential    Page 37 of 56 Treated subjects: From the time a subject has signed the ICF and until he/she exits the trial, 
all AEs/SAEs will be reported in the eCRF.  
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from the trial because of an AE, this information must 
be included in the final visit form. 
An AE should be described in the following manner: The nature of the event will be described 
in precise, standard medical terminology (i.e. not necessarily the exact words used by the sub-
ject). If known, a specific diagnosis should be stated. Furthermore, the Investigator should 
describe an AE regarding seriousness (see Section 12.2), severity, relatedness, action taken, 
and outcome.  
Severity 
 Mild: The AE does not interfere in a significant manner with the subject’s normal 
functioning level, but may be an annoyance 
 Moderate: The AE produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to 
health, but is uncomfortable and/or an embarrassment 
 Severe: The AE produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and 
is a hazard to the subject 
Relatedness 
 Related: The AE is related to the medicinal product  
 Possible related: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed  
 Unlikely related: The event is most likely related to an aetiology other than the medi c-
inal product 
 Not related: No relatedness to the medicinal product 
The categories "related" and "possible related" will be classified as related AEs and the cat e-
gories "unlikely related" and "not related" will be classified as unrelated AEs in the Clinical 
Study Report (CSR). 
Outcome 
 Recovered/resolved: Complete clinical recovery without any sequel attributable to the 
event as per Investigator’s discretion 
 Recovered/resolved with sequelae: Complete clinical recovery but with one or more 
sequels attributable to the event as per Investigator’s discretion   
 Recovering/resolving: The condition is improving and the subject is expected to r e-
cover from the event. This term should only be used when the subject has completed 
the trial 
 Not recovered/not resolved: The subject’s condition has not improved and the symp-
toms are unchanged 
 Fatal 
 Unknown: The subject’s condition is unknown. This term should only be used when 
no other definition is possible e.g. the subject is lost to follow-up 
For the purpose of medical management, all AEs and laboratory abnormalities that occur du r-
ing the trial must be evaluated by the Investigator. Each of these will be followed to satisfa c-
tory clinical resolution. Insofar as possible, all AEs should be followed-up to determine the

event has subsided (or disappeared), the condition has stabilised, the event is otherwise e x-
plained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. 
12.5 Reporting of SAEs 
The 
Investigator must report all SAEs promptly and within 24 hours to Drug Safety at Pha r-
macosmos A/S after obtaining knowledge of the event.  
The Investigator should report the SAEs by filling out the SAE form and report to Pharm a-

After the initial SAE report, the Investigator is required, proactively, to provide further info r-
mation regarding the subject’s condition. All follow-up information must be forwarded to 
Pharmacosmos A/S as it becomes available.  
For all AEs with fatal outcome, autopsy reports (if available) and relevant medical reports 
should be reported to Pharmacosmos A/S, as described above.  
SAEs occurring after trial termination must be reported if considered related to the trial trea t-
ment. 
Pharma
cosmos A/S will report SUSARs to the Competent Authorities within 7 calendar days 
for fatal and life threatening SUSARs and follow-up information within the next 8 calendar 
days. All other SUSARs are submitted as soon as possible within 15 calendar days and rel e-
vant follow-up information is subsequently communicated as soon as possible.  
Pharmacosmos A/S will inform any SUSARs to all PI(s) within 15 calendar days by circula t-

All SAEs 
including expected SARs will be reported by Pharmacosmos A/S to the Competent 
Authorities by the annually Development Safety Update Report. 
In addition, 6-monthly safety reports will be prepared by Pharmacosmos A/S and submitted to 
the Inv
estigators for information.  
13 PREGNANCIES  
Subjects who become pregnant during the trial should continue the trial but cannot receive 
more trial drug. 
If a subject becomes pregnant during the trial, they will be required to inform the Investigator 
about the pregnancy, delivery, and the health of the infant until 1 month of age. The Investig a-
tor must report the pregnancy and follow-up within 14 calendar days of obtaining the info r-
mation. Pregnancy complications must be recorded as an AE. If the infant has a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect, this must be reported and followed up as an SAE. 
The site will send a copy of the pregnancy form to Pharmacosmos A/S within 1 working day 
to Drug Safety, contact details in Section 12.5.

Overdose may lead to accumulation of iron in storage sites eventually leading to haemoside r-
osis. Monitoring of iron parameters such as s-ferritin may assist in recognising iron accumul a-
tion. Supportive measures such as chelating agents can be used. 
An overdose must be reported as an AE. 
15 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
15.1 Hypotheses 
The following hypotheses will be tested:  
The incidence of hypophosphatemia is not different in the two treatment groups.  
H0: πiron isomaltoside  - πferric carboxymaltose  = 0 
against the alternative:  
HA: πiron isomaltoside  - πferric carboxymaltose  ≠ 0 
where, π iron isomaltoside  and πferric carboxymaltose  denote the incidence of hypophosphatemia.  
The null hypothesis will be tested against the alternative by estimation of the risk difference 
using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method .  
15.2 Sample Size Determination 
Data from a previous trial conducted with iron isomaltoside 1000 mg suggests that the inc i-
dence of hypophosphatemia in a gynaecology population with/without heavy uterine bleeding 
can be expected to be approximately 10 % (P-Monofer-IDA-01, 1000 mg; n=3/29=10.3 %, 95 
% Confidence Interval (CI) = 2-27  %, gynaecology subgroup; n = 1/10 = 10.0 %, 95 % CI = 
0-45 %). For ferric carboxymaltose the incidence has been observed to be 40-70 % (e.g. Wolf 
et al., 2013; n = 10/17 = 59 %, 95 % CI = 33-82 %). The significance level is set to 5 %, and 
the power is set to 80 %. Assuming incidences of 15 % for iron isomaltoside and 40 % for 
ferric carboxymaltose, 49 subjects in each treatment group is required to detect a difference 
between the treatment groups. 
To account for the uncertainty, and to gain more safety information, 60 subjects per treatment 
group will be randomized in this trial.  
15.3 Data Analysis Sets 
The following data analysis sets will be used in the analyses of the data: 
Intention to Treat (ITT) analysis set: The ITT analysis set will include all randomized sub-
jects. This will be the primary analysis set for evaluating efficacy. Subjects will be included as 
randomized.  
Safety analysis set: The safety analysis set will include all subjects who received at least one 
dose of the trial drug. This will be the analysis set for evaluating safety. Subjects will be i n-
cluded as treated. 
Trial ID: P-Monofer-IDA-05  
Protocol Version: 3.0 (amendment 2) 
Date of Document :  29 November 2017  
  
Confidential    Page 40 of 56 Full Analysis Set (FAS): The FAS will consist of all randomized subjects, received at least 
one dose of the trial drug, and have at least one post baseline Hb assessment. Subjects will be 
included as randomized. 
Per Protocol (PP) analysis set: The PP analysis set will include all subjects in the FAS who do 
not have any major protocol deviation of clinical or statistical significance. Major protocol 
deviations are defined in Section 17.3. 
The classification of the subjects will be performed before database lock. 
15.4 Interim Analysis 
No interim analysis will be performed.  
15.5 Key Elements of the Analysis Plan 
The statistical analyses will be described in detail in a statistical analyses plan. 
15.5.1 Safety Analyses 
15.5.1.1 Primary Analysis 
The incidence of hypophosphatemia (defined as s-phosphate < 2 mg/dL) at any time from 
baseline to day 35 will be tabulated and exact 95 % CI will be estimated for each treatment 
group.  
Iron isomaltoside will be compared to ferric carboxymaltose by estimation of the risk diffe r-
ence and the associated 95 % CI, adjusting for strata (type of underlying disease (women with 
IDA due to gynaecological blood losses; yes/no) and screening s-phosphate level (< or ≥ 3.5 
mg/dL)) using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method. 
As sensitivity, the treatment groups will be compared between the treatment groups by a lo-
gistic regression model with treatment and strata as factors and baseline s-phosphate as co-
variate and by Fisher’s exact tests. 
All subjects in the safety analysis set will be included in the analysis. The first post-baseline s-
phosphate measurement will be taken at day 1; hence, very few missing values are expected. 
If there are subject(s), for whom no post-baseline s-phosphate measurement(s) are available, 
these subjects will be set as having s-phosphate < 2 mg/dL in the primary analysis. 
15.5.1.2 Secondary Analyses 
The incidence of s-phosphate < 1.0 mg/dL at any time from baseline to day 35 and the inc i-
dence of s-phosphate < 2 mg/dL at day 35 will be presented similar to the primary endpoint. 
The time with hypophosphatemia from baseline to day 35 will be presented by a Kaplan-
Meier plot, and compared between the two groups by a log-rank test. Only subjects who have 
one or more s-phosphate value(s) < 2 mg/dL will be included. The time with s-
hypophosphatemia will be calculated as the actual number of days from the first day where s-
phosphate < 2 mg/dL until the first day where  s-phosphate ≥ 2 mg/dL. If a subject experiences 
more than one period with s-phosphate < 2 mg/dL, the longest period will be used in the ana l-
ysis. All periods will be tabulated. 
The absolute and percentage change in s-phosphate from baseline to day 1, 7, 8, 14, 21, and 
35 will be analysed using a Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML)-based Mixed Models 
for Repeated Measures (MMRM) approach. All subjects in the safety analysis set with post-

Confidential    Page 41 of 56 baseline s-phosphate data will be included with their observed data. For subjects without post-
baseline s-phosphate values will have change from baseline set to 0 at the first post-baseline 
visit. The model will include the fixed, categorical effects of treatment (iron isomaltoside and 
ferric carboxymaltose), strata, week, treatment- by-week interaction, as well as the continuous, 
fixed covariates of baseline s-phosphate value and base-line s-phosphate- by-week interaction. 
The fractional phosphate urinary excretion at day 1, 7, 8, 14, 21, and 35 will be tabulated. 
The change in iFGF23, cFGF23, vitamin D (25, 1.25, 24.25), PTH, and ionized calcium from 
baseline to day 1, 7, 8, 14, 21, and 35 will be analysed by a MMRM model similar to s-
phosphate. 
15.5.1.3 Adverse Events 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) current 
version.  
Treatment emergent AEs will be summary tabulated by body system and preferred term ind i-
cating number and percentage of subjects and number of events. Number of subjects who e x-
perience an ADR including SUSARs will be compared between treatment groups.  
The following AE listings will be made as a minimum: 
 The following list will be made for subjects who never received trial drug: 
o Non-treatment emergent SAEs  
 The following lists will be made for the safety analysis set: 
o Non-treatment emergent AEs and SAEs 
o Treatment emergent AEs (non-serious and serious) 
o Treatment emergent SAEs 
o ADRs 
o AEs leading to dose reduction or withdrawal from treatment 
o Serious or severe hypersensitivity reactions 
o Fatal SAEs 
The incidence of serious or severe hypersensitivity reaction starting on or after the first dose 
of randomized treatment will be tabulated. The hypersensitivity terms are defined as SMQ 
terms (including four additional terms) in Appendix A. 
15.5.1.4 Additional Safety Analyses 
Vital signs, ECG, and standard laboratory data will be presented by descriptive statistics. The 
incidence of treatment emergent potentially clinically significant laboratory and vital sign 
values will be tabulated. 
Physical examination will be tabulated (by body system) as described for categorical data 
above.

The change in Hb, s-ferritin, and TSAT from baseline to day 1, 7, 8, 14, 21, and 35 will be 
analysed by a MMRM model similar to s-phosphate. All subjects in the ITT analysis set will 
be included. 
15.5.3 Exploratory Analyses 
The following exploratory endpoints will be analysed similar with a MMRM model similar to 
s-phosphate:  
 Change in biochemical bone/muscle markers (serum N-terminal PINP, CTx, s-alkaline 
phosphatase (bone specific and total), and creatine kinase) from baseline to day 1, 7, 8, 
14, 21, and 35 
 Change in fatigue symptoms from baseline to day 14 and 35 measured by the FACIT 
Fatigue Scale 
 Change in QoL from baseline to day 14 and 35 measured by SF-36 questionnaire 
 Change in bone pain from baseline to day 14 and 35 measured on a VAS  
 Change in muscle strength from baseline to day 14 and 35 measured by grip strength 
 Change in upper and lower limb proximal muscle function from baseline to day 14 
and 35 measured by the "1 kg arm lift" test and the "30 sec chair stand" test 
 Change in respiratory muscles strength from baseline to day 14 and 35 measured by 
MIP and MEP 
15.6 Combined Analysis of P-Monofer-IDA-04 and P-Monofer-IDA-0 5 
The two trials P-Monofer-IDA-04 and P-Monofer-IDA-05 will run in parallel. With n = 60 
tre
ated with iron isomaltoside and n = 60 treated with ferric carboxymaltose, each trial has 
more than 80% power to detect a difference in the incidence of hypophosphatemia, defined as 
s-phosphate < 2 mg/dL at any point from day 1 to day 35.  
In P-Monofer-IDA-04  and P-Monofer-IDA-05 the same dosing regimens are investigated: 
 Group A: iron isomaltoside (1000 mg infusion at baseline, cumulative dose: 1000 
mg) 
 Group B: ferric carboxymaltose (750 mg infusion at baseline and day 7, cumul a-
tive dose: 1500 mg) 
Pooled analyses of safety and efficacy endpoints will be performed for the t wo trials. 
The analyses will be performed similar to those specified for the individual trials, with the 
addition of trial in the models, i.e. the strata in the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method will be a 
combination of baseline s-phosphate and trial .  
Using the assumptions of incidences of 1 5 % for iron isomaltoside and 40 % for ferric ca r-
boxymaltose, with n = 120 for iron isomaltoside 1000 mg and n = 120 for ferric carboxymal t-
ose, there is 99 % power to detect this difference. 
The assumption of the incidence of s-phosphate < 2 mg/dL for iron isomaltoside is based on 
the subgroup in the trial P-Monofer-IDA-01 receiving 1000 mg (n = 29). For this subgroup, 
no subject experienced s-phosphate < 1 mg/dL. For ferric carboxymaltose, there has been ob-
served incidences of 9 % [Bager & Dahlerup, 2016].

is 82% power to detect this difference. 
Also, the overall incidence of treatment emergent AEs and ADRs will be compared between 
the treatments. 
The CSR can be finalised without the combined analysis, which will be done when both trials 
are finalised. The combined analysis will be included as an appendix to the CSR. 
16 DATA MANAGEMENT AND DATA COLLECTION  
16.1 Definition of Source Data 
Source data is defined as all information in original records or certified copies of original re c-
ords of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for recon-
struction and evaluation of the trial. Source data are contained in source documents (original 
records or certified copies). Source data location list needs to be filled in and maintained by 
the Investigator during the trial. 
16.2 Data Management 
Data management will be outsourced. The data collection tool for this trial will be an eCRF, 
which is compliant with 21 CFR Part 11 regulations. Subject data necessary for analyses and 
reporting will be entered into a validated database or data system. Clinical data management 
will be performed in accordance with applicable standards and data cleaning procedures.  
The site staff will be trained before they have access to the eCRF and an eCRF guideline will 
be available.  
17 TRIAL MONITORING  
17.1 Trial Monitoring

18.2 Direct Access 
Direct access to all source data and documents will be mandatory for representatives from 
Pharmacosmos A/S, Contract Research Organizations, IRB/IEC, Competent Authorities, and 
other national authorities (e.g. Data Protection Agency) for the purpose of verification of 
available data. 
If an audit or inspection occurs, the PI and institution agree to allow the auditor/inspector d i-
rect access to all relevant documents and to allocate his/her time and the time of his/her staff 
to the auditor/inspector to discuss findings and any relevant issues. 
18.3 Trial and Site Closure 
Upon completion or premature discontinuation of the site or trial, the CRA will conduct site 
closure activities with the PI or site staff, as appropriate, in accordance with applicable regul a-
tions, ICH-GCP guidelines, and Pharmacosmos A/S or its designee’s procedures.  
18.4 Records Retention 
Following closure of the trial, the PI must maintain all site trial records in a safe and secure 
location mutually agreeable to the PI, Pharmacosmos A/S, or its designee. The records must 
be maintained to allow easy and timely retrieval when needed (e.g. audit or inspection) and, 
whenever feasible, to allow any subsequent review of data in conjunction with assessment of 
the facility, supporting systems, and staff. Where permitted by local laws/regulations or inst i-
tutional policy, some or all of these records can be maintained in a format other than hard 
copy (e.g. microfiche, scanned, and electronic); however, caution needs to be exercised before 
such action is taken. The PI must assure that all reproductions are legible and are a true and 
accurate copy of the original and meet accessibility and retrieval standards, including re-
generating a hard copy, if required. Furthermore, the PI must ensure there is an acceptable 
back-up of these reproductions and that an acceptable quality control process exists for mak-
ing these reproductions. 
Pharmacosmos A/S or its designee will inform the PI of the time period for retaining these 
records to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements. The minimum retention time 
will meet the strictest standard applicable to that site for the trial, as dictated by any institu-
tional requirements, local laws or regulations, or Pharmacosmos A/S or its designee standard 
procedures; otherwise the retention period will by default be 25 years.

rangements, including, but not limited to, the following: archival at an off-site facility and 
transfer of ownership of the records if the PI leaves the site.  
18.5 Provision of Trial Results and Information to Principa l Investigators 
When the CSR is completed, Pharmacosmos A/S or its designee will provide the PI with a 
summary of the trial results. The PI is encouraged to share the summary results with the sub-
jects, as appropriate. In addition, the PI will be given reasonable access to review the relevant 
statistical tables, figures, and reports and will be able to review the results for the entire trial at 
a Pharmacosmos A/S site or other mutually agreeable location. 
18.6 Finance and Insurance 
All agreements between the PI and Pharmacosmos A/S or designee must be signed prior to 
screening of the first subject in the clinical trial. The agreement must clearly state the rights 
and obligations of the parties concerned and include a detailed financial settlement. 
Every subject participating in the trial will be insured in accordance with the local legal r e-
quirements against trial related injuries to health, which may occur during the trial.  
Excluded from this, however, are injuries to health and deteriorations of illnesses already in 
existence which would have occurred or continued to exist even if the subject had not taken 
part in the clinical trial. 
The insurance cover is jeopardised if the subject fails to report immediately to the PI or r e-
sponsible physician any injury to health, which might have resulted from participation in the 
clinical trial, or if the subject undergoes any other medical treatment without their consent 
before the clinical trial has been completely finished, insofar as the individual subject is con-
cerned. 
The subject insurance will be arranged by Pharmacosmos A/S on the basis of the final trial 
protocol. 
19 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIO NS 
19.1 Regulatory and Ethical Considerations 
Pharmacosmos A/S or its designee will obtain favourable opinion/approval to conduct the 
trial from the IRB/IEC, Competent Authorities, and the Data Protection Agency in accordance 
with the local requirements prior to initiating the trial.

APPENDIX B  
Southampton protocol for adult grip strength measurement (equipment: Model J00105 
JAMAR Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer or similar model) [Roberts et al. 2011]. 
(1)  Sit the participant comfortably in a standard chair with legs, back support, and fixed 
arms. Use the same chair for every measurement.  
(2)   Ask them to rest their forearms on the arms of the chair with their wrist just over the end 
of the arm of the chair—wrist in a neutral position, thumb facing upwards.  
(3)   Demonstrate how to use the Jamar handgrip dynamometer to show that gripping very 
tightly registers the best score.  
(4)   Start with the right hand.  
(5)   Position the hand so that the thumb is round one side of the handle and the four fingers 
are around the other side. The instrument should feel comfortable in the hand. Alter the 
position of the handle if necessary.  
(6)   The observer should rest the base of the dynamometer on the palm of their hand as the 
subject holds the dynamometer. The aim of this is to support the weight of the dyn a-
mometer (to negate the effect of gravity on peak strength), but care should be taken not 
to restrict its movement.  
(7)   Encourage the participant to squeeze as long and as tightly as possible or until the ne e-
dle/measurement stops rising/increasing. Once the needle/measurement stops ri s-
ing/increasing the participant can be instructed to stop squeezing.  
(8)   Read grip strength in kilograms from the outside dial and record the result to the nearest 
1 kg on the data entry form.  
(9)   Repeat measurement in the left hand.  
(10)  Do two further measurements for each hand alternating sides to give three readings in 
total for each side.  
(11)  The best of the six grip strength measurements is used in statistical analyses so as to 
encourage the subjects to get as high a score as possible.  
(12)  Also record hand dominance, i.e. right, left or ambidextrous (people who can genuinely 
write with both hands).

adult grip strength measurement.

Tests of upper and lower limb proximal muscle function [Agarwal and Kiely, 2006 ]. 
The subject sits in a chair holding a 1 kg weight with the shoulder adducted, the elbow in full 
flexion, and the forearm in supination (Figure 1). He/she is asked to lift the arm above the 
head until the elbow is fully extended, then to lower the arm back to the starting position, and 
then repeat the action at his/her own pace. This devised test has been called the "1 kg arm lift" 
test. It is important that the emphasis is not on achieving a maximum possible number of rep e-
titions within the time, but instead that the test is performed at a comfortable pace according 
to the subject’s own rhythm. The number of times the weight is lifted above the head in a 30 s 
period is recorded for each arm individually and the final score is the mean of the two mea s-
urements. When the test cannot be performed in one arm, for reasons other than the muscle 
disease in question, such as elbow or shoulder arthritis, the score from the contralateral arm 
alone is used.

the 1 kg weight with the shoulder adducted, the elbow in full flexion, and the forearm in sup i-
nation. He/she is asked to lift the arm above the head until the elbow is fully extended, then to 
drop the arm back to the starting position, and then repeat the action at his/her own pace for a 
30 s period.

Confidential    Page 56 of 56 The "30 s chair stand" test is a valid and reliable measure of proximal lower limb strength in 
older adults. The subject is asked to stand upright from a chair with their arms folded across 
the chest, then to sit down again and then repeat the action at his/her own pace over a 30 s 
period (Figure 2). Again it is important to emphasize that the subject does not need to achieve 
a maximum possible number of repetitions within the time allocated, but that the test is pe r-
formed at a comfortable pace according to the subject’s own rhythm. It is important that the 
same or a similar chair is used on each occasion, as the score may be influenced by the height 
of the chair. The final test score is the number of times that the subject rises to a full stand 
from the seated position with arms folded within 30 s.

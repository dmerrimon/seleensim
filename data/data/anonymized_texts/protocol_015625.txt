EX-MKTG -149 TIGER  Protocol v 3.0 31 may2023  9 2 INTRODUCTION  
It is anticipated that more than 40% of contact lens wearers would benefit from a contact lens that 
corrects astigmatism , but this target is not reached in most countries .1 As new lenses come to 
market it is of interest to compare the performance of the new product to the performance of established products. The goal of this study is to compare the performance of Biofinity toric  (Lens 
A), a silicone hydrogel monthly replacement  lens from CooperVision Inc., which has successfully 
been established on the market with TOTAL30 for astigmatism  (Lens B), a SiHy monthly 
replacement lens recently launched by Alcon  Inc.  
3 OBJECTIVES  
To compare the clinical performance of Biofinity toric ver sus Total 30 for astigmatism in habitual 
lens wearers, when worn for 1 -month each.  
The prim ary outcome variable: 
• Ease of handling for  lens removal  (0 - 100) reflecting a typical day in the past month, 
collected at the 1- month in- office visits   
The secondary outcome variable:  
• Distance Visual Acuity (Snellen converted to logMAR) for study lenses determined at the 1-month in- office visits   
Other  outcome variables :  
o Lens fit: centration, lens orientation, post blink movement at 1-month follow -up 
o Subjective ratings : 
 At- home questionnaires  [collected on Days 7, 14 and 27 (study CL) ] 
 In-office experience ratings - after lens insertion [collected at lens dispense 
visit (study CL) ] 
 In-office experience ratings  – a typical day in the past week  [collected at 
screening (habitual CL)  and 1- month follow -up visits (study CL) ] 
 In-office satisfaction ratings – a typical day in the past week  [collected at 
screening (habitual CL) and 1- month follow -up visits (study CL) ] 
 In-office agreement ratings – a typical day in the past week  [collected at 
screening (habitual CL) and 1- month follow -up visits (study CL) ] 
 In-office preference ratings collected at exit visit  (study CL)  
 
EX-MKTG -149 TIGER  Protocol v 3.0 31 may2023  10 4 HYPOTHESIS  
The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference for  the primary outcome variable between 
Lens A compared to Lens B.  
5 MATERIALS AND METHODS  
5.1 STUDY DESIGN  
5.1.1 OVERALL DESIGN 
This study will be conducted at several optometry practices in the US  and Canada. This study is 
a prospective, bilateral eye, subjected- masked, randomized, 1- month  cross- over, daily -wear 
design involving two different  silicone hydrogel toric lens types. Each lens  type will be worn 
bilaterally for approximately one month , during which participants record their subjective lens -wear 
experience on three different days.  Additional measures will be collected during in- office study 
visits. 
5.1.2 R ANDOMIZATION  
A randomization schedule will determine the order of Lens A and Lens B wear f or the f irst/second 
month for each p articipant . Participants  will be randomized immediately prior to their first lens 
dispense.  
This randomization schedule will be generated for each site using a web- based program: 
(www.randomization.com ). The  lens type that will be worn during the first month  is called “ Lens 
type #1”, the lens type dispended for the second month  is called “ Lens type #2”. The final study 
randomization schedule will be generated by CORE’s  Database Administrator  and provided to the 
research assistants at each site .  
5.1.3 MASKING  
At the fitting visit, only the participant will be masked of the lens type, the investigator will know 
which type is fit to  make changes to the lens at this visit  if needed . Strongly adhesive stickers will 
be placed on the packages/foils to mask the participant to the lens brand. At both dispense 
visits, participants will be masked to the lens type dispensed.  The study personnel will determine 
the lens order according to the r andomization schedule and will over -labeled the l ens 
packages/f oils prior to dispense. 
EX-MKTG -149 TIGER  Protocol v 3.0 31 may2023  11 5.2 INVESTIGATIONAL  SITES  
5.2.1 NUMBER OF S ITES  
This study will be conducted  at approximately 5 optometry  practice sites within the United States  
and Canada.   
 
5.2.2 IN VESTIGATOR RECRUI TMENT  
The principal investigator at each site will be required to fulfil the following criteria:  
• Is a l icensed Optometrist with at least two years of contact lens fitting experience. 
• Can demonstrate training in Good Clinical Practice (GCP). 
• Accepts responsibility for the conduct of the study at their site.  
• Has in- office email and document scanning capabilities.  
• Will scan and send all study visit documents to CORE, ideally the same day* as the 
visit or at most within 2 days of the study visit.  
• Is willing  to follow the study protocol and to co- operate with the study monitors  at 
CORE . 
* Study documents are required as soon as possible because this allows for timely data review, 
query and entry.  
5.3 STUDY POPULATION 
5.3.1 SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION  
The sample size calculation was based on a recent study comparing Biofinity sphere and Total30 
sphere; the data for subjective responses for ease lens handling for lens removal when reflecting 
in a typical day, collected at the 1- month visits: standard deviation of 2.0 ( 0 - 10 scale) was 
transformed to a standard deviation of 20 for using a 0 - 100 scale for this study. 90% power is 
achieved with a minimum sample size of 44 participants.  
EX-MKTG -149 TIGER  Protocol v 3.0 31 may2023  12  
Therefore, up to 48 participants will be dispensed with study products with the goal to complete at 
least 44.  
5.3.2 N UMBER OF P ARTICIPANTS  
Participants will be recruited using site records  and databases where consent for contact about 
research has been provided. There will also be general  advertising materials ( e.g. posters, social 
media posts ) and all these, including email scripts, will be approved by the ethics review board. 
All initial individual- targeted recruitment activities, such as any direct mailing of recruitment scripts, 
will be conducted by practice staff that are not directly involved in conducting the research. This 
separation will reduce any undue influence of the optometrist -patient relationship. This process 
will also eliminate opportunity for the investigator to access personal health information before any consent for disclosure is provided by the potential participant.   
It is anticipated that up to 60 potential participants may attend a  Screening visit and at least  48 
participants will be randomized and dispensed with study products, with a target of at least 44 
completing the study. Each site will dispense study products to approximately 10 participants. 
5.3.3 I

A person will be excluded from the study if he/she:  
1. Is participating in any concurrent clinical or research study ; 
2. Has any known active * ocular disease and/or infection that contraindicates contact lens 
wear ; 
3. Has a  systemic condition  that in the opinion of the investigator may affect  a study

EX-MKTG -149 TIGER  Protocol v 3.0 31 may2023  14 7. Has undergone refractive error surgery  or intraocular surgery . 
 
^These recommended percentages are reasonable estimates of market shares in the U.S.  Exceptions 
may be permitted after discussion with the study monitor or sponsor  to target the anticipated habitual lens 
distribution across all si tes. 
*For the purposes of this study, active ocular disease is defined as infection or inflammation which 
requires therapeutic treatment. Mild (i.e. not considered clinically relevant) lid abnormalities  (blepharit is, 
meibomian gland dysfunction, papillae), corneal and conjunctival staining and dry eye are not considered 
active ocular disease.  Neovascularization and corneal scars  are the result of previous hypoxia, infection or 
inflammation and are therefore not act ive. 
#Pregnant and lactating women are not being excluded from the study due to safety concerns but due to 
fluctuations in refractive error, accommodation and/ or visual acuity that occur secondary to systemic 
hormonal changes  and water retention. It has further been shown that pregnancy could impact tear 
production, which could impact dry eye symptoms. Such fl uctuations could affect the secondary outcome 
data, thereby negatively affecting study data integrity.  
5.4 STUDY MATERIALS  
Sites will be provided (if needed) with a trial kit  of Lens A and will source their own trial kit  or order 
trial lenses in the required parameters  of Lens B. The sites will use these trial kits /lenses  to fit Lens 
A and Lens B lenses  to determine the optimal lens power . The final lens prescription has to be 
tested on eye and commercial boxes of Lens A and B will be ordered through the site’s normal 
commercial route  (Lenses from the fitting sets will not be used for dispensing). In case, the same 
prescription is worn on both eyes, a single 6- pack will be ordered to be split between both eyes.  
Reimbursement to practice sites for study product expenses will be provided by CooperVision, 
after CORE has reconciled the invoices and the  product accountability and dispensing logs. 
CORE will provide all sites with the study paperwork. This  will include participant informed consent 
letters and study data collection forms, product accountability logs and the participant dispensing logs. CORE  will train site personnel to complete the forms correctly and provide continued support 
to answer queries on correct form completion.  
 
  
  
  

EX-MKTG -149 TIGER  Protocol v 3.0 31 may2023  15 5.4.1 L ENSES  
Both, Lens A and Lens B are  cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
and are  commercially available in the U.S. and Canada.

5.4.2 L ENS CARE PRODUCTS  
It is expected that participants will continue to use their habitual lens care products with the study 
lenses. This will avoid any potential incompatibility the participants may have with a new care 
product. Each participant will be compensated for them using their own lens care product for the approximately 2- month study period. Participants who habitually use a daily disposable lens or 
use a care regimen that is not suitable with the use of the study lenses , will be provided with 
OptiFree Puremoist with Hydraglyde  (Alcon). The sites will source commercial bottles of this care product and r eimbursement will be provided by CooperVision, after CORE has reconciled 
the invoices and the product accountability and dispensing logs.  
5.4.3 O
THER PRODUCTS  
Sodium fluorescein will be used to assess corneal and conjunctival staining.   
5.4.4 R EWETTING DROPS  
Participants will not be encouraged to use rewetting drops; however, those who habitually used rewetting drops will be allowed to continue using their normal drops.  
EX-MKTG -149 TIGER  Protocol v 3.0 31 may2023  16 5.4.5 DI SPOSING OF STUDY PRODUCTS  
At the end of the study, all sites will return all unused products  to CORE , unless  otherwise 
directed. Worn lenses will be disposed of by participants and at the sites according to local 
regulations.  
5.4.6 P RODUCT ACCOUNTABILITY  
Accountability  logs are completed to record all study products that were used for each 
particip ant, which includes products used during the visits and those dispensed to  and returned 
by each participant . 
5.5 SCHEDULED AND UNSCHEDULED VISITS  
This study has a minimum of 4 scheduled study visits, including the screening visit.  There is an 
option for repeated screening visit  if needed.  
A scheduled 1- month  follow -up visit may only take place when the participant  attends  wearing  
the study lenses for at least two  hours  that day . If this is not the case and the participant  is not 
experiencing any problems  with the lenses, the appointment will be rescheduled, ideally within 
the visit window.   
Visits that fall outside of the specified visit windows will be designated as protocol deviations and 
at the end of the study, the data collected during protocol deviations will be assessed for their suitability to be included in the analysis population. 
Table 3 summarizes the scheduled s tudy visits and study codes.

.5.1 V ISIT 0 SCREENING & FITTING  VISIT  
Informed consent shall be obtained in writing from the participant  and the process shall be 
documented before any procedure specific to the clinical investigation is carried out.  
Participants will be assigned a unique alpha -numeric study ID after they sign the consent 
documentation i.e. before their eligibility for the study has been confirmed. Each site will use a 
different letter preceding the participant ID  number.  For example, participant 01 at  site P will be 
P01, and participant 01 at site L will be L01. Ineligible participants will be discontinued from the 
study.  
The investigator will determine participant eligibility using the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

EX-MKTG -149 TIGER  Protocol v 3.0 31 may2023  25 5.5.6 ST UDY EXIT 
The study exit form will be completed when a participant exits the study. This form will be 
completed either after the last  study visit, or if the participant is discontinued from the study at 
another time, complete also an unscheduled visit form. A study exit form must be completed for all participa nts who have taken a study ID number. If in the opinion of the investigator post -study 
follow- up visits are required, the exit form will be completed after the last follow -up visit.  
Exit visual acuity will be recorded with either the participant’s spectacles, refraction or habitual 
contact lenses. An exit biomicroscopy assessment will be conducted if not already completed on the same day for a concurrent study visit.  
After the  exit assessments have been completed, the participant and investigator will complete 
the study completion and remuneration forms. At this time the participant will be considered as 
having exited the study.  
 
5.5.7 U
NSCHEDULED VISITS  
An unscheduled visit is defined as an interim visit requested by the participant  or investigator 
due to an unanticipated problem. Data recorded at these visits will be entered into the database. 
Only relevant and applicable unscheduled visit information will be included in the final report as 
deemed necessary.

6 MONITORING PROTOCOL ADHERENCE  
Adherence to study visit windows, lens wearing schedule, and time windows around other data 
collection points (i.e. subjective ratings) will be monitored by CORE. Deviations from the study 
plan as  described in the protocol will be reported in the study report. As described in Section 13.4, 

EX-MKTG -149 TIGER  Protocol v 3.0 31 may2023  28 major protocol deviations will be reported to the Sponsor and Sterling Institutional Review Board  
within 10 days of becoming aware of them (as per Sterling Institutional Review Board guidelines) .  
7 POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS TO HUMAN PARTICIPANTS  
There may be no direct benefits to the subjects in this study . Participation in a study may contribute 
to scientific  research information that may be used in the development  of new contact lens 
products. The subjects will receive an examination of the front part of their eyes and may have the 
opportunity to try a different type of soft contact lenses and/or different lens care products at no 
cost to them. The contact lens materials used in this study are commercially available as daily wear. This study will investigate participants’ wearing schedule intended for daily wear (NOT extended wear) , similar to the average wearing time of 10 -16 hours for daily wear lenses.  
All lenses used in this study are IDE exempt under 21 CFR 812.2(c)2. The two study contact lens  
types will be worn as per their approved use; on a daily wear  basis with monthly replacement.  
When contact lenses are worn on a daily wear basis there is a small risk of an adverse event compared to not wearing contact lenses. When contact lenses are worn on an extended wear basis, there is a significantly increased risk of an adverse reaction compared with wearing contact 
lenses on a daily wear basis.  
Adverse events and/ or complications in daily wear of  soft contact lenses can occur  (e.g.: 
inflammation and infection).  Complications that may occur during the wearing of contact lenses 
include discomfort, dryness, aching or itching eyes, excessive tearing, discharge, hyperemia and 
variable or blurred vision.  More serious risks may include pain, photophobia, iritis, corneal edema or eye infection. Although contact lens -related infections are very infrequent, the possibility does 
exist.  The incidence of infection due to day -wear soft lenses is 0.035%. Almost always an infection 
will occur only in one eye.  This risk is assumed by 35- million Americans who currently wear 
contact lenses and only current soft lens wearers will be recruited for this study.  
A dye (fluorescein) normally used for eye examinations is being used in this study. Although rare, it is possible to have an allergic reaction to the dye. Participants will be asked if they  have  a 
known allergy or sensitivity to fluorescein. 
The assessments conducted in this study are r outine clinical procedures  and they includ e auto-
refraction, auto -keratometry, visual acuity, anterior ocular health assessment, and contact lens 
fitting will be used. In addition, high magnification imaging of the lens fit may be made using 35 
mm or digital cameras . Patients will be monitored frequently  until the end of the study to reduce 
EX-MKTG -149 TIGER  Protocol v 3.0 31 may2023  29 the occurrence of adverse or potential adverse events. Patients will be given instruct ions from their 
investigator regarding early symptoms and signs of adverse events.  
8 ADVERSE EVENTS  
See CORE SOP012 for a description of all adverse events, including management and reporting . 
An ‘adverse event’ refers to any undesirable clinical occurrence in a participant, whether it is 
considered to be device- related or not. Adverse events (AE) may be classified as ‘unanticipated 
adverse device effects,’ ‘serious adverse events,’ ‘significant adverse events,’ or ‘non- significant 
adverse events,’  as defined below , Table 5.  
A number of conditions may result in temporary suspension until resolution. These include corneal infiltrates, corneal staining, limbal injection, bulbar injection or tarsal conjunctival abnormalities.  
Table 4 : Classification of types of adverse event  
AE classification, coding (for reporting to the sponsor) and reporting details, plus examples , are 
provided in Table 6. 
Table 5 : Contact lens adverse event classification, coding and reporting guide  
Code  Condition Reporting  
Serious Adverse Events  
01 Presumed infectious keratitis or infectious corneal ulcer  For all serious 
AEs:  02 Permanent loss of ≥ 2 lines of best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA)  Classification  Definition 
Serious Adverse 
Event  Those events that are life- t hreatening, or result in permanent impairment of a body 
function, or permanent damage to a body structure or necessitate medical 
(therapeutic) or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure.  
Significant 
Adverse Event  Those non- s erious adverse events that occur with contact lens usage that are not 
sight -threatening but are usually symptomatic and may warrant therapeutic 
management and /or temporary or permanent discontinuation of contact lens wear.  
Non- Significant 
Adverse Events  Those less severe non- s erious adverse events that occur with contact lens usage that 
are not sight -threatening, may or may not be symptomatic and may warrant palliative 
management, such as ocular lubricants or temporary interruption of contact lens wear.  
Unanticipated 
Adverse Device 
Effect  Adverse events in a study that were not previously identified in the protocol in terms of nat
ure, severity, or degree of incidence. An Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device 
Effect is an unanticipated adverse event that is serious in nature and caused by or associated with the device and is considered reportable.

EX-MKTG -149 TIGER  Protocol v 3.0 31 may2023  31 8.1 NORMAL OR ADAPTIVE SYMPTOMS 
Transient symptoms such as end- of-day dryness, lens awareness, itching or burning or other 
discomfort may occur with contact lens wear and may occasionally reduce wearing time. These 
are not reported as adverse events unless in the investigator’s opinion they are unexpected in nature, severe or have a high rate of occurrence.  
8.2 PROCEDURES FOR ADVERSE E VENTS  
Treatment of an adverse event will depend on its nature and severity. Based on the clinical judgment of the investigator the ocular adverse events  may be  managed at the practice, or the 
participant may be referred to another eye care practitioner for treatment. The investigator will 
attempt to determine whether the reaction is related to the test device or a result of other factors. 
An adverse event form will be completed for each adverse event. If both eyes are involved, a 
separate adverse event form will be completed for each eye. Whenever possible, the adverse event will be photo- documented.  
Expenses incurred for medical treatment as part of study participation will be paid by the sponsor (bills and prescription receipts kept). The participant must be followed until resolution or no further 
change is anticipated and/or referred for further care with the appropriate health care professional 
and/or recorded as being under appropriate health care as per investigator’s discretion. A written 
report will be completed indicating the subsequent treatment and resolution of the condition.  
8.3 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
All potential Serious and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects that are related or possibly related to participant’s participation will be reported to CORE’s lead study coordinator  (details below) and 
also to the sponsor (details below) within 24  hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event. 
The site’s Principal Investigator will also report the event to Sterling  IRB within 10 days of 
becoming aware of the Serious or Unanticipated event, using the Reportable Events Form. All 
fatal or life -threatening events will be reported immediately to the IRB.  
Significant and Non -Significant Adverse Events will be reported to CORE’s lead study coordinator  
and the sponsor as soon as possible, but no later than 5 working days after becoming aware of 
the occurrence.

Details of all adverse events will be included in the study report. 
9 DISCONTINUATION FROM THE STUDY  
Participants may be discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor in consideration 
of participant safety or protocol compliance, or at discretion of the participant.  Participants 
discontinued from a study will be reimbursed for their active involvement in the study (including the initial screening visit  and all lens fitting visits ) as per the information on the consent letter .  
Upon discontinuing, a participant will be offered the option of their data being withdrawn from future statistical analysis. The following is a list of possible reasons for discontinuation from the study:  
• Screening failure: Part icipants will be discontinued if  they do not meet the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria outlined in section 5.2.3. 
• Unacceptable performance with products to be used in study: Participants may be discontinued if they are unable to achieve acceptable comfort and /or vision with the study products.  
• Positive slit lamp finding: Participants may be permanently discontinued from the study 
depending on the severity of the condition and on the judgement of the investigator.   
• Adverse event: If a participant experiences an adverse event during the study,  they may 
be discontinued based on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  

EX-MKTG -149 TIGER  Protocol v 3.0 31 may2023  33 • Symptoms : If the participant has persistent symptoms,  they may be discontinued based 
on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  
• Disinterest, relocation or illness: The participant may choose to discontinue due to 
reasons within or beyond their control.  
• Violation of protocol or non- compliance:  The participant will be discontinued if they are 
unable or unwilling to follow the protocol specified visit schedules  and/or study 
procedures . 
• Instillation of topical ocular medication:  The participant will be discontinued if they elect to use a topical ocular medi cation during the study  unless  that topical ocular medication 
is prescribed for a limited duration (less than two weeks)  to treat a transient condition; in 
this case  the participant may remain an active participant (at the discretion of the 
investigator) after stopping topical ocular medication following resolution of the ocular 
condition).  
• Lost to follow -up:  The participant will be discontinued if they cannot be contacted and do  
not return to complete the  final study exit, and if the investigator has made a reasonable 
effort to contact the participant for a final study visit.  
• Premature termination of the study by the sponsor, CORE  or Sterling IRB . 
A discontinuation form , stating the reason for discontinuation will be completed, which requires 
the signatures of both the participant and the investigator except where the participant is lost to 
follow- up in which case only the signature of the investigator is required .   
When a participant chose to discontinue from the study,  they will be given the opportunity to 
withdraw their data from the statistical analysis. This choice will be captured on the discontinuation form.  
All discontinuations including their reasons will be included in the final report.  
10 DEVICE MALFUNCTIONS  
A device malfunction means the failure of the device to meet its performance specification or otherwise perform as intended. Any defective lens that is  likely to cause or contribute to a Serious 
Adverse Event should be reported to CORE  and the sponsor within 24  hours of the investigator 
becoming aware of the malfunction. Sterling IRB  would also be notified within 24 hours of any 
device malfunction that may contribute to a  Serious Adverse Event . 
EX-MKTG -149 TIGER  Protocol v 3.0 31 may2023  34 Other defective lenses should be reported to CORE as soon as possibl e. 
This clinical study will also ascertain satisfaction or preference with subjective attributes such as 
comfort, vision, or lens handling. Responses to these subjective questionnaires will not be considered as complaints or device malfunctions.  
11 STUDY COMPLETION AND REMUNERATION 
At the last scheduled protocol visit a study completion form  will be completed, which requires the 
signatures of both the participant and the investigator.  P articipants will also be provided with a 
letter of  appreciation.    
Once their involvement in the study is complete, participants will be informed about receiving feedback following study completion in the Let ter of Appreciation. 
Participant remuneration will be paid as per site contract  and approved consent letter . 
12 S TATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA MANAGEMENT  
12.1 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
All data will be analyzed by CORE  at the University of Waterloo.  Unmasked data analysis will be 
conducted using Statistica 14.0 , Statsoft or other suitable softwar e.  Descriptive statistics will be 
provided on demographic data  (age, gender, refractive error distribution, etc.).  Table 7  lists the 
primary and other outcome variables and anticipated statistical procedures. 
Visual acuity results will be converted to LogMAR for analysis purposes. 
Comparisons will be made between the study lenses for the variables measured at the 1- month  
visits. Additionally,  the subjective ratings completed on days 7, 14 and 27 with each study lens  
will be compared. A binomial test will be used to analyze the results for the count data of 
subjective preferences and experience responses. Where relevant, the number of “ no 
preference” responses will be evenly distributed to the two options on the basis they would be equally likely to choose either.  
For assessments conducted for each eye separately, the right eye will be  used for analysis. If a 
general difference is found (paired t -test / Wilcoxon matched pairs) between OD and OS, a 
comment will be  provided. 
Where appropriate, data may be presented as both mean  or median  and as counts by ‘bucket’ 
groups.  
EX-MKTG -149 TIGER  Protocol v 3.0 31 may2023  35 Additional analysis may be conducted.

12.2 DATA MANAGEMENT  
Data will be collected and written on paper forms which will be provided to each site by CORE. 
Each  site is  required to submit completed study forms via a secure file- sharing system hosted on 
a University of Waterloo SharePoint site. Each site will be provided with their own account and 
password to access the designated folder for uploading files. Users will be required to log in with 
their provided credentials to deposit their files securely .  
The site will endeavour to provide the scanned forms to CORE on the same day as the study 
visit or a maximum  of two days after the study visit.  
Within CORE, d ata will be entered into a REDCap database developed and tested specifically 
for this study and accessible only to trained, authorised users. A data management plan will be developed to describe the data handling in more detail, including the personnel involved.  
Data from this study will be retained by CORE  for a minimum of 25 years on a password-
protected server. After 25 years, data will be disposed of in accordance with the guidelines laid 
out by the University of Waterloo.  More d etails regarding storage procedures are provided in 
section 15.7 and also in CORE SOP0 14 Clinical data management. 

EX-MKTG -149 TIGER  Protocol v 3.0 31 may2023  36 At the completion of the study CORE will provide a copy of the study database in Excel format to 
the sponsor when requested. Data will typically be sent using Sendit. This system provides a secure way to transfer files when email is not appropriate, whether because of file size, file type or concerns over security. Sendit includes features such as password protection, a restricted time period for download, IP logging and email notification of download. Files may be encrypted prior to transmission at the request of the sponsor. Using this method means that data files ar e 
only stored on University of Waterloo servers during the transfer.   
12.3 COMMENTS ON SOURCE DOCUMENTS  
Data analysis will not be conducted on comments which have been recorded in the source documents. Only relevant and applicable comments will be included in the final report as deemed necessary by CORE’s L ead Co-ordinator .  
13 PROTOCOL & OTHER TRAINING  
All study personnel will be required to complete training prior to their involvement in the study. Records of training will be kept at CORE . This will include train ing by CORE on the study 
protocol , study procedures, informed consent procedures, and on the randomization and 
participant masking procedures , as well as training for Good Clinical Practice.   
All site Principal Investigators and co-investigators will provide a scan of their curriculum vitae, 
license to practice optometry and evidence of professional indemnity insurance.  
14 STUDY MONITORING  
Each site will provide regular  status reports to CORE . Status r eports will include:  
• The number of participants screened, enrolled, and randomized (i.e. assigned a study ID number), discontinued and completed.  
• Details of all protocol deviations, adverse events, device malfunctions . 
• Reports of unintended events.  
CORE will collate the site updates and regular  status reports to the study sponsor.  
Study monitoring visits to the sites may be conducted by CORE, the sponsor, or sponsor’s 
designate,  throughout the study and will be scheduled in conjunction with t he Princip al 
Investigator at each site. In addition, study records may be inspected by the sponsor, the 
sponsor's designate, Sterling Institutional Review Board, and by regulatory authorities in Canada and the United States, namely Health Canada and the United States Food and Drug 
EX-MKTG -149 TIGER  Protocol v 3.0 31 may2023  37 Administration (FDA); however, they will not be permitted to take away any records containing 
identifiable personal information.  
Study data review and data monitoring will be conducted by CORE personnel. To improve data integrity,  data entry will be conducted by one person and a second person will visually compare 
the data entry to the source documents.  Data queries will be reported to the site within 5 working 
days of receipt of initial data. A response resolving the query will be expected from the site within 
5 working days of receipt of the query.  
All adverse events and protocol deviations will be reviewed by the site Principal  Investigator  and 
will be reported to the sponsor. All serious adverse events and major protocol deviations will be reviewed by the site Princip al Investigator  and CORE’s Lead Co -ordinator before reporting to the 
sponsor and to Sterling Institutional Review Board as per their policies .

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Act which mandates the registration of certain clinical trials 
of drugs and medical devices.  They will maintain the information on that site .  
15.4 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
Protocol deviations are unanticipated or unintentional changes to a study after it has received 
prior sponsor approval and ethics clearance . Protocol deviations can be major or minor. All 
protocol deviations must be reported to CORE’s lead study coordinator (see section 8.3).  
15.4.1  M AJOR PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
Major protocol deviations may impact the research protocol, information consent document or other study materials, usually cannot be anticipated ahead of time and are often necessary to ensure the safety and welfare of the participants.  
The following are examples of protocol deviations that must be reported to Sterling IRB : 
• Changes in procedures initiated to eliminate immediate risks/hazards to participants;  
• Enrollment of participants outside the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria whether agreed to or not by the sponsor;  
• Medication / device / intervention errors (i.e. incorrect drug or dosage of drug / incorrect contact lens(es) dispensed / incorrect care system dispensed); 
• Inadvertent deviation in specific research intervention procedures or timing of the 
research intervention which could impact upon the safety or efficacy of the study -related 
intervention or upon the experimental design;  
• Information consent documentation violations: no documentation of informed consent; 
incorrect version of, or incomplete, informed consent documentation used.  
15.4.2  M
INOR PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
Protocol deviations caused by or which originate with research participants are considered minor, and normally are not reported to Sterlin g IRB  unless these result in increased risk to the 
EX-MKTG -149 TIGER  Protocol v 3.0 31 may2023  39 participant (s). The following are examples of protocol deviations that are considered minor and 
do not require reporting to the ORE:  
• Logistical or administrative aspects of the study (e.g., study participant missed 
appointment, change in appointment date) ; 
• Inadvertent deviation in specific research intervention procedures or timing of the 
research intervention which would not impact upon the safety or efficacy of the study -
related intervention or upon the experimental design (i.e., missing a measurement during 
a session that is not considered critical for the study).  
15.4.3  R EPORTING AND DOCUMENTING PROTCOL DEVIATIONS  
Major protocol deviations must be reported to the Sterling Institutional Review Board and the sponsor within 10  days  of the deviation occurring (or its discovery)  using the Reportable Events 
Form . To facilitate timely reporting to the sponsor , all sites must notify CORE (see contact details 
in section 8.3) of a major protocol deviation as soon as possible.  
All protocol deviations (major and minor) occurring during the study will be documented and included in the final report .

When the study has been completed, all sites will send the original study product accountability 
and dispensing logs, and enrolment logs to CORE . Each site should retain the original consent 
documents and the study data collection forms  documentation for ten years following the close 
of the database in case data queries arise during the analysis and report writing stages . CORE 
may request that these originals be sent to them for storage  and study data collections forms 
may be sent to the sponsor for storage. 
Records and data from this study will be retained at CORE for a minimum of 25 years. Details 
regarding storage procedures are given in CORE  SOP014 Clinical data management .  
16 REPORT  
Data will be analysed at CORE and a  report will be sent to the sponsor  according to terms 
described in the study contract .

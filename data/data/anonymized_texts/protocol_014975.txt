SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol CA209436
Protocol Title: A Phase I/ II Study to Evaluate the Safety and Preliminary Effi cacy of Nivolumab in Combination 
with Brentuximab Vedotin in S ubjects with Relapsed Refractory N on Hodgkin Lymphomas with CD30 Expression 
CheckMate 436: CHECKpoint pathway and nivolumab clinical Trial Evaluation
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Administration, Du ration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s): Brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg is to be administered as a 30-minu te intravenous infusion on day  1 of 
every 3-week cycle during the Dose Evaluation Phase (Cohort A). The brentuximab vedotin dose for the Expansion 
Phase (Cohort B) will be determined once the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) period in Cohort A is complete.Nivolumab dose will be 240 mg flat administered intravenously over a 30-minute infusion throughout Cohort A and 
Cohort B. Nivolumab is to be administered on Cycle 1, day 8. Sub sequent to cycle 1, both drugs will be 
administered on the Day 1 of every 3-week cycle. 
Study Phase:  Phase I/II
Research Hypothesis: The study will investigate the hypothesis that brentuximab vedo tin can be safely combined 
with nivolumab. Additionally, the study will investigate that th e combination can result in a clinical meaningful 
ORR in subjects with relapsed/refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lym phoma (DLBCL), relapsed/refractory Peripheral 
T Cell Lymphoma (PTCL) (all subtypes excluding Anaplastic Large C ell Lymphoma), relapsed/refractory Primary 
Mediastinal B Lymphoma (PMBL), relapsed/refractory Mediastinal G ray Zone Lymphoma (MGZL) and 
relapsed/refractory Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma (CTCL) Mycosis Fung oides/Sezary Syndrome (MF/SS).
Objectives: Primary Objectives: 
•To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of n ivolumab and brentuximab in subjects with the 
diagnosis of relapsed, refractory DLBCL, PTCL (all subtypes excluding ALCL), CTCL (MF/SS), PMBL and 
MGZL.
•To assess the clinical benefit of nivolumab and brentuximab ved otin combination regimen in subjects with the 
diagnosis of relapsed/refractory DLBCL, relapsed/refractory PTC L (excluding ALCL), relapsed refractory 
CTCL, relapsed/refractory PMBL, and relapsed/refractory MGZL (MF/SS) (CD30 expression t1% by 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a prerequisite for all subjects pa rticipating in this study), as measured by ORR, 
defined as the proportion of subjects achieving either a PR or CR. In subjects with relapsed/refractory DLBCL,
relapsed/refractory PTCL, relapsed/refractory PMBL, and relapsed /refractory MGZL, the response will be 
assessed according to Lugano Classification 2014. For subjects with relapsed/refractory CTCL, response will be 
assessed according to consensus Global Response Score as per th e consensus statement of the International 
Society for Cutaneous Lymphoma.
Secondary Objectives:
•To assess overall duration of response (DOR) of the brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab combination regimen 
based on investigators assessments
•To assess the complete response rate (CRR) with the combination regimen and the duration of CR based on 
investigators assessments. 
•To assess progression free survival (PFS) based on investigators a ssessments and overall survival (OS) of the
brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab combination regimen.
Exploratory Objectives:
•To assess the Indeterminate response (IR) per Lymphoma Response  to Immunomodulatory therapy Criteria 
(LYRIC) in subjects with DLBCL, PTCL, PMBL, MGZL and CTCL (if app licable)

Study Design:  
This is an open-label, multicenter phase I/II study of nivoluma b in combination with brentuximab vedotin designed 
to evaluate the safety and efficacy in subjects with the diagno sis relapsed/refractory of DLBCL, PTCL (excluding 
ALCL) , CTCL (MF/SS), PMBL and MGZL. 
The study will consist of three phases: Screening, Treatment an d Follow-up. The treatment phase is divided in two 
parts: Cohort A consists of the Dose Evaluation Phase and Cohor t B is the Expansion Phase.
It is anticipated that 170 subjects will be enrolled in the Unit ed States, Canada and E urope for the entire study 
(Cohort A and Cohort B combined). All subjects will undergo a s creening period to determine eligibility within 28 
days prior to initial dosing. 
Dose Evaluation Phase (Cohort A)
The Dose Evaluation Phase (Cohort A) will include a dose limiti ng toxicity (DLT) evaluation for the dose level of 
brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg intravenously in combination with  nivolumab 240 mg flat dose intravenously in a q 
3 week cycle. Refer to section 4.5.1  for further details. 
In cycle 1, brentuximab vedotin 1.8mg/kg will be administered o n day 1 nivolumab 240 mg flat dose will be 
administered on day 8. Subsequent to cycle 1, both drugs will be  administered on the first day of the new cycle. 
Brentuximab vedotin will be administered first as a 30-minute i nfusion followed by a minimum 30-minute rest. 
Nivolumab will then be administered also as a 30-minute infusio n.  
The DLT evaluation period, which consists of the first dose of study drug through the first 6 weeks of treatment, will 
be conducted in the first 6 treated subjects (all comers). Decisions to enroll up to 6 additional subjects onto the same 
dose of brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg in combination with nivolu mab 240 mg flat dose intravenously every 3 
weeks or at a reduced dose of brentuximab vedotin at 1.2 mg/kg w ill be based on the safety data reviewed 
throughout the DLT evaluation period. 
If any of the first 6 treated subjects discontinue treatment for  reasons other than a DLT but prior to completing the 
DLT evaluation period, then they will be replaced. Subjects enr olled to Cohort A will be monitored for DLT 
throughout the DLT evaluation period. Refer to section 4.5.1 for  DLT definition. 
After 6 DLT-evaluable subjects have been followed through the f irst 6 weeks of treatment, or at the point that 2 or 
more subjects experience a DLT, whichever comes first, the stud y team will review the available data and provide 
any of the following recommendations, but not limited to:
1. If one or none ( d1) of the 6 subjects experience a DLT, the expansion cohort wil l begin with brentuximab 
vedotin 1.8 mg/kg Cycle 1 Day 1 and nivolumab 240 mg flat dose on Cycle 1 Day 8. 
2. If two or more (t 2) of the 6 subjects are determined to have had a DLT based on the protocol definition (refer 
to section 4.5.1) , the following options will be considered
a. To repeat Cohort A of the study and treat up to 6 addition al subjects at the same drug doses and schedule  
previously tested 
b. To repeat Cohort A of the study and treat up to 6 additional subjects at a reduced dose of brentuximab 
vedotin 1.2 mg/kg
c. Administration of the combination treatment on Day 1 of every cycle, including cycle 1
d. To close the study to additional enrollment

BMS-936558 nivolumab
NOTE: Doses may not be increased to above 1.8 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin or nivolumab 240 mg flat dose.
On review of all available data, the study team may determine t hat the classification of DLT was not appropriate for 
one or more of the subjects, in which case enrollment may resum e if the target of 6 DLT-eva luable subjects has not 
yet been reached. However, if 2 or more subjects were determined to have experienced DLTs, then expansion will 
not occur as the next step. Based on the study team’s recommendations, up to 6 additional subjects may be enrolled 
in Cohort A at the same drug dose levels and schedule or at a m odified treatment (described above in this section). 
These additional sub jects will then be assessed for DLT in the same manner described above to determine if it is 
appropriate to move to the Expansion Phase (Cohort B). If it is  determined by the study team that due to safety
concerns no additional dose levels or schedules should be enrol led, then the study will be closed to enrollment.
There is no planned interim analysis (IA). However, all available efficacy and safety data will be used to select t he 
recommended brentuximab vedotin dose and treatment schedule tha t will be further evaluated in the Expansion 
Phase (Cohort B). 
Expansion Phase (Cohort B)
The Expansion Phase will assess the combination of nivolumab and  brentuximab vedotin and will consist of a 
single-arm phase II study which w ill expand enrollment at the recommended dose level and treatment schedule as 
deemed safe by the study team in Cohort A.  An additional 40 su bjects in DLBCL (cohort B1), 30 subjects in PTCL 
(cohort B2), 20 subjects in CTCL (cohort B3), 30 subjec ts in PMBL (cohort B4) and 10 subjects MGZL (cohort B5)
will be enrolled to complete this evaluation. 
If one or none ( d1) of the 6 subjects experience a DLT, the expansion cohort will begin with brentuximab vedotin 
1.8 mg/kg Cycle 1 Day 1 and nivolumab 240 mg flat dose on Cycle 1 Day 8. Subsequent to cycle 1, both drugs will 
be administered on the first day of the new cycle. Brentuximab vedotin will be administered first as a 30-minute 
infusion followed by a minimum 30-minute rest. Nivolumab will be then be administered as a 30-minute infusion. If 
two or more ( t2) of the 6 subjects are determined to have had a DLT based on the protocol definition (refer to 
section 4.5.1 ) treatment modification or enrollment closure will be consider ed, as described above.
All subjects in Cohort A and Cohort B will be allowed to be tre ated until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity as described in Section 4.5.3 and Section 4.5.5 . If during therapy it appears that a subject is benefiting fro m 
the combination but experiencing toxicities related to one agen t that would require permanent treatment 
discontinuation, then they have the option to continue therapy with the single agent not attributing to toxicities.
Subjects that present progressive disease during treatment may b e allowed to be treated beyond progression until 
further progression is observed. Refer to Section 4.5.9  for further details.
Once subjects discontinue from study treatment for any reason, subjects will enter the follo w-up phase of the study. 
During follow-up, long-term safety, survival status, disease pro gression, subsequent anticancer therapy and 
occurrence of other primary malignancy d ata w ill be collected. Follow-up visit 1 (X01) and follow-up visit 2 (X02) 
will be in person visits and all subsequent follow-up visits ma y be done in person or by phone. All treated subjects 
will be followed for survival at least every  3 months un til death or lost to follow-up. Subjects with residual toxicity  
G t2 at the time of discontinuation must follow these until resolved to at least G1, end of study or deemed 
irreversible, whichever occurs first. Subjects who discontinue for reasons different than progressive disease must 
continue to perform tumor assessments as described in Section 5.4 until disease progression is documented. 
The primary endpoint for Cohort B will be investigator-assessed O RR for all five tumor types. This analysis will 
occur 8 months after the last patient receives their first trea tment (LPFT). Depending on the enrollment for each 
disease cohort, the analysis may be done at different times for  each cohort or at the same time for the five cohorts.

Study Assessments: 
Safety Evaluation: Adverse events will be assessed continuously  during the study and for 100 days post last 
treatment. Adverse events will be coded using the most current version of MedDRA and reviewed for potential 
significance and importance. Adverse events will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03. Subjects 
should be follo wed until all tr eatment-related adverse events have recovered to baseline or ar e deemed irreversible 
by the investigator.
Efficacy Assessments: Primary efficacy endpoint in this study i s Objective Response Rate. Subjects will perform 
tumor assessments at week 6 and week 12 continuing every 9 week s (+/- 1 week) for the subsequent 4 tumor 
assessment timepoints, regardless of dosing schedule. After the  first year, tumor assessments are to occur every 
12 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) until disease progression is documented. S ubjects with DLBCL, PTCL, PMBL, and MGZL
will follow the Lugano Classification 2014 and perform FDG PET- CT at the tumor assessment time points. Subjects 
with CTCL will follow the mSWAT and Global Response Score and w ill perform CT/MRI along with whole blood 
and medical photography (as appropriate) at the tumor assessment time points described in  Section 5.4 .
Statistical Considerations:
Sample Size: In the Dose Evaluation Phase (Cohort A), 6 -12 subjects will be treated. The number of subjects is not 
based on statistical power considerations. If less than 1/3 of 6 subjects experience a DLT, the upper limit of the 80% 
1-sided exact confidence interval for the true DLT rate will not  be greater than 42%. If less than 1/3 of 12 subjects 
experience a DLT, the upper limit of the 1-sided 80% exact conf idence interval (CI) for the true DLT rate will not 
be greater than 41.2%. 
In the Expansion Phase (Cohort B), a total of 130 subjects will be treated, with 40 subjects in cohort B1 (DLBCL), 
30 subjects in cohort B2 (PTCL), 20 subjects in B3 (CTCL), 30 su bjects in cohort B4 (PMBL) and 10 subjects in 
cohort B5 (MGZL). 
Given 40 subjects in DLBCL, the one-sided 90% confidence interv al (ie, two-sided 80% confidence 
interval) for the ORR is 48.6% - 70.6% if we assume an observed ORR rate of 60%. The lower bound of 
the 90% CI excludes 40%, which is the null hypothesis ORR rate for PTCL.
Given 30 subjects in PTCL, the one-sided 90% confidence interva l (ie, two-sided 80% confidence interval) 
for the ORR is 46.7% - 72.3% if we assume an observed ORR rate of 60%. The lower bound of the 90% CI 
excludes 40%, which is the null hypothesis ORR rate for PTCL. 
Given 20 subjects in CTCL, the one-sided 90% confidence interval (ie, two-sided 80% confidence interval) 
for ORR is 63.9% - 91.0% if we assume an observed ORR rate of 80 %. The lower bound of the 90% CI 
excludes 60%, which is the null hypothesis ORR rate for CTCL. 
Given 30 subjects in PMBL, the one-sided 90 % confidence interv al (ie, two-sided 80% confidence 
interval) for the ORR is 37.0% - 63.0% if we assume an observed ORR rate of 50%. The lower bound of 
the 90% CI excludes 30%, which is the null hypothesis ORR rate for PMBL. 
Given 10 subjects in MGZL, the one-sided 90 % confidence interv al (ie, two-sided 80% confidence 
interval) for the ORR is 11.6% - 55.2% if we assume an observed ORR rate of 50%. The lower bound of 
the 90% CI excludes 10%, which is the null hypothesis ORR rate for MGZL.

Table below summarizes the 90% exact CI for different targeted ORRs and sample sizes. The targeted ORR of 60% 
in DLBCL and PTCL and 80% in CTCL, and null hypothesis ORR rate  of 40% in DLBCL and PTCL and 60% in 
CTCL are based on the historical data and the activity of brent uximab vedotin and nivolumab as single agents from 
phase I and phase II studies.
One-sided 90% Exact CI for different number of subjects in each cohort
If the observed ORR rate is 60% in Cohort B1 and B2 Power
N=30 [46.7% - 72.3%] 82%
N=40 [48.6% - 70.6%] 87%
If the observed ORR rate is 80% in Cohort B3
N=20 [63.9% - 91.0%] 62 % 
If the observed ORR rate is 50% in Cohort B4
N=30 [37.0% - 63.0%] 81 %
If the observed ORR rate is 30% in Cohort B5
N=10 [11.6% - 55.2%] 61%
Also, If we have 20 subjects in Cohort B 3, assuming true ORR is 80%, there will be approximately 62% po wer to 
reject null hypothesis that the true ORR is <=60%, considering a one-sided alpha of 10%. Given a very low 
prevalence of CTCL, 20 subjects in cohort B3 is considered as fea sible and adequate for a phase II signal detecting 
trial. Sample size of 30 subjects in Cohort B2 and 40 subjects in Cohort B1 are corresponding to power of 82% and 
87% respectively to reject null hypothesis that the true ORR is  <=40% assuming true ORR is 60% and considering a 
one-sided alpha of 10%. If we have 30 subjects in Cohort B4, ass uming true ORR is 50%, there will be 
approximately 81% power to reject null hypothesis that the true  ORR is <= 30%, considering a one-sided alpha of 
10%. Finally if we have 10 subjects in Cohort B5, assuming true  ORR is 30%, there will be approximately 61% 
power to reject null hypothesis that the true ORR is <= 10%, considering a one-sided alpha of 10%.
Endpoints: The safety endpoints include incidence of deaths, adverse event s, serious adverse events, adverse 
events leading to discontinuation, adverse events leading to dose delay, select adverse events and specific laboratory 
abnormalities (worst grade). Toxicities will be graded using th e National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.
The primary efficacy endpoint is ORR. It is defined as the number of subjects with a best overall response (BOR) of 
confirmed CR or PR divided by the number of treated subjects. The BOR is defined as the best response designation 
recorded between the date of first dose and the date of initial  objectively documented progression or the date of 
subsequent therapy, whichever  occurs first. In subjects with re lapsed/refractory DLBCL, relapsed/refractory PTCL, 
relapsed refractory PMBL and relapsed refractory MGZL the respon se (CR, PR, PD, and progression) will be 
assessed according to Lugano Classification 2014. For subjects with relapsed/refractory CTCL, response will be 
assessed according to consensus Global Response Score as per th e consensus statement of the International Society 
for Cutaneous Lymphoma. The secondary endpoints are DOR, CR rate, duration of CR, PFS and OS.
Analyses:   All analyses will be performed separately for each cohort and also for all treated subjects.
Descriptive statistics of safety will be presented using Nation al Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. All on study AEs, drug-related, AEs, SAEs and drug-related 
SAEs will be tabulated using worst grade per NCI CTCAE v4.03 crit eria by system organ class and MedDRA 
preferred term. On-study lab parameters including hematology, chemistry, liver function, thyroid function, and renal 
function will be summarized using worst grade per NCI CTCAE v4.0 criteria. 
The ORR will be summarized by binomial response rates and their  corresponding one-sided 90% exact CIs using the 
Clopper-Pearson method. The same analysis will be performed for CR rate.

1 INTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE
Treatment with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy results in p romising responses by 
eliminating tumor cells, however a great majority of subjects re lapse with need for therapies that 
can result in durable responses. The therapeutic efficacy of st andard conventional 
chemotherapeutic treatments is often limited by the emergence o f molecular resistance resulting 
in relapse. Evasion of the host immune responses is an importan t mechanism for inducing 
resistance to cancer therapy.1,2Over the last several decades drug development in oncology has 
seen the emergence of immune therapies.3The armamentarium includes 1) vaccine approaches to 
cause strong specific immune responses to tumor antigens 2) ado ptive transfer of ex vivo expanded 
engineered or innate tumor specific lymphocytes 3) therapeutic administration of monoclonal 
antibodies such as rituximab against CD20 on lymphoid malignant  cells, Herceptin® 
(trastuzumab) directed against HER2 on breast cancer cells and 4 ) strategies to block molecular 
and cellular mediators of cancer induced immunosuppression such  as Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte 
Antigen 4 (CTLA4, CD152), Programmed Death -1 receptor (PD-1, CD279) or T regulatory cells 
(T reg) .1
Tumor cells up regulate expression of the immune check point rec eptors (ICR) such as CTLA4, 
PD-1 and the ligands (PD-L1, B7-H1/CD274) ICR which effectively attenuates the T-cell proliferation and anti tumor effects.
4The success of anti-Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4
(CTLA4) (ipilimumab) in cancer therapy has highlighted the pote ntial role for other check point 
inhibitors .4Analogous to anti-CTLA4, a second immune check point inhibitor,  directed against 
PD-1 has gained interest due to the potential to circumvent mul tiple immunosuppressive 
mechanisms emanating in the tum or microenvi ronment.5PD-1 is an immune inhibitory receptor 
of the CD28/CTLA-4 family which regulates the homeostasis of T cells activation, tolerance and 
immunopathology.6The PD-1/PD-L1 interaction inhibits T lymphocyte proliferation, survival and 
effector function (cytotoxicity, cytokine release). PD-1 immune  check point inhibition has been 
shown to result in up regulati on of genes  associated with effector, NK cell function and cytolytic 
effects .6The cardinal biological effects of PD-1immune check point inhib ition are manifested by 
reversal of exhaustive CD8+T cells, averting depletion of memor y B cells, depleting Foxp3+iTreg 
cells and restoring robust Th1 immunity .6Targeting PD-1immune check points has the potential 
to play a major role in cancer therapy by reversing tumor immun e escape. Nivolumab is a fully 
human, IgG4( ദ) isotype mAb that binds PD-1 on activated immune cells and disr upts engagement 
of the receptor with its ligands PD-L1(B7-H1/CD274) and PD-L2 (B7-DC/CD273), abrogating the inhibitory signals and augmenting host antitumor immune res ponse.
6Nivolumab has 
demonstrated efficacy in solid and hematological malignancies.7,8Clinical studies are ongoing to 
further elucidate the efficacy of PD-1 immune check-point inhib ition in hematologic 
malignancies.9,10

Nivolumab
Nivolumab is a fully-human mo noclonal antibody (HuMAb; immunogl obulin G4 [IgG4]) that 
targets PD-1. In vitro, nivolumab binds to PD-1 with high affinity (EC50 0.39-2.62 nM), and 
inhibits the binding of PD-1 to its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 (IC 50 ±1 nM). Nivolumab binds 
specifically to PD-1 and not to related members of the CD28 fam ily such as CD28, ICOS, CTLA-4 
and BTLA. Nivolumab blocks the PD 1 pathway and results in a re producible enhancement of 
both proliferation and IFN- Ȗ release in the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Using a 
cytomegalovirus (CMV) re-stimulation assay with human PBMC, the  effect of nivolumab on 
antigen specific recall response indicates that nivolumab augme nts IFN- Jsecretion from 
CMV-specific memory T cells in a dose-dependent manner versus i sotype-matched control. In 
vivo blockade of PD-1 by a murine analog of nivolumab enhances the anti-tumor immune response 
and results in tum or rejection in several immunocompetent mouse tumor models (MC38, SA1/N, 
and PAN02).11Nivolumab is indicated for the treatment of subjects with unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma and disease progression following ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a 
BRAF inhibitor.12Nivolumab is indicated for the treatment of metastatic Squamous  Non-Small 
Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with progression on or after platinum-b ased chemotherapy.13
Nivolumab is approved in US, Europe and Japan for the treatment of subjects with unresectable 
or metastatic melanoma following progression on ipilimumab. Nivo lumab is approved in US and 
Europe for the treatment of metastatic Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung cancer (NSCLC).
Nivolumab has demonstrated efficacy in lymphoid malignancies. R esults from a phase I trial with 
heavily pre treated group of lymphoid malignancies demonstrated anti tumor effects of Nivolumab in subjects with relapsed B, T Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) and Ho dgkin Lymphoma (HL). 
The Overall Response Rate (ORR) in 29 subjects with B NHL was 28% and in 23 subjects with T 
NHL was 17% respectively .
9Nivolumab has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in subjects with 
relapsed refractory HL. In a heavily pre treated group of 23 su bjects, therapy with nivolumab 
demonstrated promising clinical activity. The ORR reported in t his study was 87%, Complete 
Response Rate (CRR) of 17% Partial Response Rate (PRR) of 70% a nd (13%) of subjects achieved 
Stable Disease (SD). The Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 24 w eeks was reported as 86% 
Nivolumab has been designated breakthrough therapy for the treatment of relapsed HL after failure 
of autologous stem cell transplantation and brentuximab vedotin .8,9Nivolumab is currently being 
developed by Bristol Myers Squibb for the treatment of solid tumors and hematological 
malignancies. 
Brentuximab Vedotin
Brentuximab vedotin is a CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of 
3 components:1) the chimeric IgG1 antibody cAC10, specific for human CD30; 2) the 
microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE); and 3) a protease-cleavable 
linker that covalently attaches MMAE to cAC10. The primary mecha nism of anticancer activity 
of brentuximab vedotin is binding of the ADC to CD30-expressing cells, followed by internalization of the ADC-CD30 complex, and the release of MMAE via proteolytic cleavage.

BMS-936558 nivolumab
Binding of MMAE to tubulin disrupts the microtubule network within the cell, subsequently 
inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic death of the cell.14
Additionally brentuximab vedotin has shown to induce Immunogenic Cell Death (ICD).15ICD is 
a distinct cell k illing mechanism mediated thro ugh toll like r eceptor ligands which can abrogate 
the inhibitory effect of tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment and reinitiate the immune 
responses. Brentuximab vedotin possible immune modulatory properties were demonstrated in a 
report analyzing brentuximab vedotin’s effects in CD30+ Hodgkin  Lymphoma cell lines. 
Brentuximab vedoti n was evaluated f or its ability to i nduce Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress (ER). 
It was shown that brentuximab vedotin in a dose dependent manne r up regulated the apoptotic 
endoplasmic reticulum ER sensor C/EBP homologous protein which resulted in cleavage and 
activation of ATF6, a transcription factor required for inducti on of the ER stress. The net results 
were induction of ER stress and ICD markers. Induction of ICD w as associated with activation of 
immune reaction. It was concluded that exposure of dendritic cells to brentuximab vedotin- killed 
tumor cells evoked an i nflammatory phenotype including an incre ase in co-stimulatory markers 
CD86 and Major Histocompatibilit y Complex  (MHC) Class II antige ns, and activation of Nuclear 
Factor ദB (NFദ B) an intermediate of inflammatory signaling pathway. This sugges ts additional 
brentuximab vedotin anti tumor effects by activating the innate immune response, although thiseffect remains to be validated, as the observations are early and ex vivo.
In a pivotal phase 2 study of 102 subjects with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) 
following autologous stem cell transplant (SCT), treatment with  brentuximab vedotin resulted in 
an ORR of 75% (95% CI, 64.9%–82.6%). The CRR was 34% (95% CI, 2 5.2%–44.4%) and the 
median PFS for all sub jects on study was 5.6 months (95% CI, 5.0–9.0 months).
14Brentuximab 
vedotin is approved for the therapy of relapsed HL after failur e of autologous transplant or after 
failure of at least two multi agent systemic chemotherapy for s ubjects who are not candidates for 
autologous transplant. 
Brentuximab vedotin has also demonstrated activity in systemic Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma 
(ALCL). In a trial of 58 subjects with relapsed CD30+ ALCL who ha d received prior systemic 
chemotherapy, brentuximab vedotin demonstrated an ORR of 86%, C RR of 57%, and PRR of 
29%. The median duration of response was reported as 12.6 month s. The most common adverse 
event reported was peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, d iarrhea, pyrexia, 
thrombocytopenia, cough and vomiting.16
Brentuximab vedotin has also shown efficacy in other lymphoid malignancies. Ongoing trials in 
different NHL are exploring its full potential. Brentuximab vedo tin is currently being developed 
by Seattle Genetics for the treatment of hematological malignancies. 
1.1 Study Rationale
Study CA209436 is an open label, multi center Phase 1/2 st udy to investigate the safety and 
efficacy of nivolumab in combination with brentuximab vedotin i n subjects with relapsed, 
refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma (PTCL) all 
subtypes excluding Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL), Cutaneo us T Cell Lymphoma

(CTCL) Mycosis Fungoides (MF), Sezary Syndrome (SS), Primary Medi astinal B Lymphoma 
(PMBL) and Mediastinal Gray Zone Lymphoma (MGZL).
Harnessing host immune response is an important antitumor strat egy. In this context reversing the 
effects of exhaustive T cells by checkpoint blockade agents is being actively explored as an 
effective immune therapy in clinical trials. It has been advoca ted that optimal T cell-based 
antitumor immunity requires both CD8+ T c ells acting as cytolytic effector cells and CD4+ Th1 
cells to sustain antitumor response. Additionally it has been s uggested that PD-1 blockade can 
restore robust Th1 immunity and T cell activation, hence abolish  immunosuppression in the tumor 
microenvironment .2,5Although immune therapies including check point blockade appear  effective 
anti cancer therapies, concerns remains for enhancing efficacy due to limitation of single agent 
activity which has been observed in certain tumor types. Some o f the strategies to enhance the 
efficacy of immune therapies include improving the quality of e ffector cells and to reveal 
additional tumor antigens .2The MHC class II antigen processing pathway is altered in cance r 
thereby precluding efficient presentation of T cell epitopes .2Hence one strategy to increase 
efficacy of check point blockade is by combining with agents which possess the ability to enhance the effects of MHC Class II molecules to increase antigen prese ntation. It is therefore postulated 
that nivolumab and brentuximab vedotin combination will have ad ditive and synergistic 
mechanism of actions.
Brentuximab vedotin will mediate its effects through induction of apoptosis.
Brentuximab vedotin may provide s ynergy by inducing ICD. Inducti on of ICD may enhance and 
increase the expression of the co stimulatory molecule CD86 and M HC Class II antigens. These 
effects may result in augmenting the effects of nivolumab.Nivolumab by inducing robust Th 1 immunity and T cell activatio n, will result in augmenting host 
anti tumor immune response.Collectively this combination has a high potential of becoming an effective novel therapy in 
lymphoid malignancies with unmet medical need.
1.1.1 Unmet medical need in DLBCL
DLBCL is the most common form of NHL. With the standard first line chemo immunotherapy 
(anthracycline based regimen and rituximab), 67% of sub jects ar e alive at a median follow up of 
4 years.
17This implies that approximately 30-40% of subjects either relap se after standard therapy 
or demonstrate presence of refractory disease. At the time of r elapse, the standard of care is to 
offer high dose therapy with autologous transplant to subjects who demonstrate chemo sensitive 
disease. The salvage chemotherapy is comprised of platinum or cytarabine based regimens in 
combination with rituximab. Most studies have demonstrated CRR with salvage regimen ranging 
from 20-40%.18,19The Landmark PARMA study has established autologous transplant as a 
standard treatment mod ality in the managem ent of relapsed DLBCL for subjects demonstr ating 
chemo sensitive disease. The PARMA trial demonstrated the rate of Event Free Survival (EFS) of 
46% for subjects in the transplant group versus 12% in the group  which received chemotherapy

without transplant.20Subjects who do not respond to salvage therapy have an extremel y poor 
outcome with a median survival of only 4 months with 4% alive a t 1 year.21Furthermore, only 20-
25% subjects after autologous transplant sustain durable respon ses. Treatment options following 
failure of transplant or for chemo refractory subjects are fini te. This underscores the urgent need 
for effective therapy for subjects with relapsed refractory DLBC L. Several novel agents are 
emerging and have shown activity in relapsed DLBCL.22Nivolumab has demonstrated activity as 
a single agent in subjects with relapsed refractory DLBCL. A total of 11 subjects with relapsed 
DLBCL were treated with nivolumab. Nivolumab was administered at a  dose of 1mg/kg 
intravenously followed by 3mg/kg intravenously in the expansion cohort until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities. The trial reported an ORR of 36%, CRR of (9%), PRR of ( 27%), and 
(27%) SD. The median duration of response was 17 weeks (range 6- 44.1+) at a media n follow up 
of 23 weeks (range  3-69.0+). Overall the st udy treatment was we ll tolerated and majority of 
adverse event reported were grades 1-2 .
9Results from a phase II study in subjects with NHL has 
demonstrated eff icacy of brentuximab vedotin in subjects with r elapsed DLBCL. There were a
total of 49 subjects with relapsed DLBCL, brentuximab vedotin was administered at 1.8 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks. Subjects who achieved SD or better could continue treatment until 
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or study closure. Su bjects with relap sed DLBCL were 
noted to have an O RR of 44%, with  (17%) achieving Complete Remi ssion (CR) in subjects with 
CD30 expression. The median durati on of res ponse was reported as 16.6 months in subjects with 
CR. Significant activity of brentuximab vedotin was noted across a range of CD 30 expression.
23
An important observation from a majority of the trials of novel a gents in relapsed DLBCL is that 
they have limited single agent activity, suggesting the need of adjuncts to improve quality of response. Trials with novel agent combinations are needed to address an important unmet medicalneed in this patient population. 
1.1.2 Rationale for nivolumab and brentuximab vedotin in relapsed DLBCL
Since the outcome remains dismal fo r relapsed refr actory DLBCL, incorporation of n ovel agents 
is key to identify a nd improve therapy. Re search elucidati ng mo lecular characterization in DLBCL 
is emerging to provide insight which can facilitate drug develo pment to improve outcomes. The 
International Prognostic Index (IPI) is used to delineate subje cts into prognostic subgroups based 
on clinical prognosticators however it lacks biological insight which attributes to the heterogeneity 
of the disease. Gene- expression profile has yielded important prognostic and biological 
information for DLBCL. The Leukemia and Lymphoma Profiling Proje ct (L&LPP) using 
microarray identified two independent groups with distinct gene  expression profiles based on 
hierarchical clustering.
24,25The two groups based on Cell of Origin (COO) include the Germin al 
Center subtype (GC) and Activated B Cell like (ABC) or non-Germinal center (non GC) subtype. 
Subjects with ABC are noted to have inferior outcomes as compar ed to the GC subtype. In an 
updated analysis from the L&LPP, in subjects with DLBCL treated with Rituximab, 
Cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, Oncovin, Prednisone(R-CHOP) two gene signatures were 
identified. The favorable signature stromal 1 demonstrated genes related with extracellular matrix and histiocytic infiltration. The stromal signature 2 which was  associated with worse prognosis

was reflective of genes linked with angiogenesis and surrounding macrophages.26,27This suggests
role of tumor microenvironment in DLBCL pathology. Relapsed NHL is often treated with 
allogeneic transplant, underpinning the role of adaptive immuno therapies in this setting.28
Eradicati on of immune tolerance in this patient population may provide an important therapeutic 
strategy. This is further supported by activity of check point blockade agents such as anti PD1 in 
relapsed DLBCL. In a phase II trial of subjects with relapsed DLBCL undergoing autologous 
transplant, pidilizumab an anti PD-1 monoclonal antibody was ad ministered for measurable 
disease following transplant. The therapeutic benefit of anti-P D1 was manifested by a CRR of 
34% and ORR of 51% among subjects with measurable disease .10Likewise, Nivolumab has 
demonstrated activity in heavily pre treated group of subjects with relapsed DLBCL with an ORR 
of 36% .9
CD 30 is a membrane glycoprotein associated with the TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily. There 
is suggestion that CD30 stimulation results in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and activation of the 
prosurvival transcription factor NF- ദB.29CD30 is expressed in several lymphoid malignancies.
Results from a retrospective analysis of 167 cases of archived tissue from subjects with DLBCL, 
demonstrated variable CD30 expression measured by immunohistoch emistry (IHC). Twenty one 
percent (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.8-27.1%) of these case s expressed CD30, a nd in 52% 
of samples CD30 expression was noted in > 80% of tumor cells.30Multivariate analysis performed 
in Bcl2+ DLBCL showed that higher frequency of CD30 expression was observed in samples with 
non- GC subtype, and in subjects < 47 years old. Another group e xamined CD30 expression in 
subjects with de novo DLBCL using IHC. A total of 385 cases of formalin fixed paraffin embedded 
DLBCL in tissue microarray were examined. Using a > 0% cut off,  CD30 expression was predicted 
of superior 5 year progression free within R-CHOP treated germi nal center B cell like DLBCL 
(86% versus 64%, p=0.020). Epstein - Barr virus (EBV) was identi fied in 11 (3%) of cases in the 
non- GCB/ABC subtype DLBCL (p=0.001).31International DLBCL Rituximab-CHOP 
Consortium Program evaluated 903 cases of de novo DLBCL. It was reported that approximately 14% of subjects with DLBCL express CD30. The subjects with CD30 expression DLBCL had superior Overall Survival (OS) and PFS regardless of the COO. In multivariate analysis, 
controlling other variables, including B symptoms, tumor size, IPI, COO classification and TP53 
mutational status, absence of CD30 expression remained an indep endent inferior predictor of 
overall survival Hazard Ratio [HR] of 3.03; 95% Confidence Inte rval [CI], 1.33-6.89; P = .0082) 
and Progression Free Survival (PFS) (HR of 2.89; 95% CI, 1.35-6 .20; P = .0064).The molecular 
elucidation in this group using gene expression profiling depicted up regulation of genes encoding 
negative regulators of NF țB activation and lymphocyte survival, and down regulation of genes 
encoding B-cell receptor signali ng and proliferation, as well a s prominent cytokine and stromal 
signatures in CD30 expressed DLBCL subjects, suggesting a distinct molecular basis for its 
favorable outcome.
32Although the report is suggestive of favorable prognosis in de novo frontline
R-CHOP treated subjects with CD30 expressed DLBCL, the prognost ic implications of CD30 
expressed DLBCL in relapsed setting remains unclear and some re port suggest association with

CD30 expression as an adverse prognosticator.33Results from a phase II study in subjects with 
NHL has demonstrated efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in subject s with relapsed DLBCL .23
Based on these observations, it is postulated that combined imm une modulation with 
antibody-mediated PD-1 immune-checkpoint blockade nivolumab and brentuximab vedotin may 
result in additive activity and synergistic activity translating into improved clinical outcomes in subjects with relapsed DLBCL. 
1.1.3 Unmet medical need in Peripheral T Cell NHL (PTCL)
PTCL is a heterogeneous group of aggressive T cell NHL which carries a poor prognosis. The 
incidence of PTCL is < 1 case per 100, 000 people in the United States. Despite being a rare tumor 
PTCL accounts for substantial numbers of death worldwide.
34PTCL encompasses several 
different types, among which the most frequent subtypes are PTCL- Not Otherwise Specified
(NOS-25.9%) and Angioimmunoblastic T cell Lymphoma (AITL-18.5%). Historically the 
treatment of PTCL has comprised of integration of cytotoxic chemo therapy combination such as 
CHOP in the frontline tr eatment. The outcome for subjects with PTCL remains dismal with a 
reported 5 year overall s urvival of only 37%.35,36More intensive chemotherapeutic regimens such 
as ACVBP (dose-intensified doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide, Vindesine, Bleomycin and Prednisone) have been employed for younger subjects with superi or event free survival and overall 
survival albeit at the expense of increase in toxicities .
36The majority of subjects with PTCL 
require many lines of therapies with ultimate dismal outcomes. Recently integration of novel 
agents in the management of PTCL has been employed with the aim to improve outcomes in this 
highly aggressive dis ease group. Pralatrexate is a novel folate  antagonist which exerts its effects 
by binding to the reduced folate carrier. Pralatrexate has demonstrated activity in subjects with 
relapsed PTCL. The phase II PROPEL (Pralatrexate in Patients wi th Relapsed or Refractory T-cell 
Lymphoma) trial demonstrated activity of pralatrexate in subjec ts with relapsed refractory PTCL. 
The total number of subjects treated were 111 with a median of 3  prior therapies. Pralatrexate was 
administered at a dose of 30mg/m2/week for 6 weeks in 7 weeks cycle. Approximately 63% of 
subjects were refractory to their last therapies. The reported ORR was 29%, CRR of 11% with a 
median duration of res ponse of 10.1 months. The median PFS and OS were 3.5 and 14.1 mo nths 
respectively.37Important toxicities include mucositis and thrombocytopenia. Pralatrexate was 
approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as a  single agent for the treatment 
of relapsed refractory PTCL. Ro midepsin, one of the Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor (HDACi), has 
also demonstrated activity in the treatment of relapsed PTCL. I n a phase II trial with 131 subjects 
with PTCL, romidepsin was administered at a dose of 14mg/m2intravenous infusion on days 1, 
8 and 15 of a 28 days cycle. The ORR was 25%, CRR 15% and the median duration of response was 17 months with the longest ongoing response at 34 months. The most common adverse events 
include cytopenias and infections along with nausea and fatigue .
38Brentuximab vedotin has 
demonstrated promising activity i n patient with relap sed ALCL. In a phase II trial 58 subjects wi th 
ALCL were treated with brentuximab vedotin at 1.8 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks. The ORR was 86%, CRR 57% and PRR 29%. The median duration of response was 12.6 months .

et al also demonstrated activity of brentuximab vedotin in subj ects with relapsed CD30+ PTCL. 
In this phase II study the total number of subjects with PTCL NOS=22 and AITL n=13. The ORR 
was 41% (8CR, 6PR) in subjects with PTCL NOS and the ORR was 54%  (5 Complete Response, 
2 Partial Response) in subjects with AITL.39Nivolumab has also demonstrated activity in subjects 
with T NHL (n=23) the ORR has been reported as 17% with PRR for 4(17%), SD for 10(43%). In this phase I study the total number of subjects with PTCL was 5 . Nivolumab was administered at 
1mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks and at 3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks in the expansion 
cohort un til unaccep table toxicities or disease progression. The ORR for the PTCL cohort was 
40% and PRR (40%) Importantly, the duration of response appears  durable in the responding 
group .
9
The overall prognosis of PTCL remains poor, marked with multiple  relapses and OS at 10 year of 
10-15%, hence there remains a vital need to develop effective the rapies. The availability of novel 
agents allows for exploring combination with scientific rationale to improve not only response rates but also durability of responses.
1.1.4 Rationale for nivolumab combination with brentuximab vedotin in PTCL
PTCL encompasses several subtypes originating from the post thy mic T lymphocytes mature 
T cells.
40The scarcity of cases of PTCL, diverse morphology and lack of d iagnostic markers are 
some of the factors for impeding the progress in the molecular and genetic characterization in 
PTCL .40,41With the exception of ALCL which harbors the specific genetic a bnormality
t(2;5)(p23;q35), other subtypes of PTCL lack specific genetic ab normalities .40,42The cellular 
inception of several of the subtypes of PTCL remains obscure or appears to be heterogeneous. At the present time approximately 50% of PTCL cases are not classi fiable .
41Majority of PTCL NOS 
are related to the CD4 helper cells and a minority are analogou s to CD8 cytotoxic cells. T follicular 
helper cells (TFH) have been identified as the cell of origin f or a few subtypes of PTCL including 
AITL.43,44The AITL neoplastic cells are identified as clonal mature DECD4+ T cells which 
express numerous TFH markers such as; CXCL13, PD1, ICOS, CD200 and BCL6.40Studies 
incorporating gene expression profiling have began to delineate  biological and prognostic 
subgroups to elucidate pathobiology in PTCL.45Iqbal et al recently examined gene expression 
profiling in 372 PTCL cases. The group demonstrated high expres sion of several signatures 
association with the tumor microenvironment in subjects with AIT L. The genes in the signature 
depicted strong associated with angiogenesis and vascular endothelial function or cell migration. 
Furthermore, 2 major subgroups in PTCL NOS were recognized. The 2 subgroups include GATA3 
with high expression of GATA3 and target genes (CCR4, IL18RA, C CL3, and IFN ڜ )and the 
TBX21 with high expression of TBX2I, EOMES, and CXCR3, IL2RB, CCL3 and IFNڜ .) The 
enrichment in these subgroups depicts gene signatures related t o proliferation (MYC), mTOR 
(PI3K), IFN ڜ induced genes and NFKB gene signatures. The presence of GATA3 profile was 
noted to be associated with inferior outcomes.46The role of immunosuppressive 
microenvironment in PTCL was further validated by a study by Wilcox et al. Tumor biopsies were evaluated for the expression  of PD-L1 (B7-H1) from sub jects with CTCL and PTCL.

BMS-936558 nivolumab
Approximately 50% of T cell NHL cases  examined depicted express ion of PD-L1. The expression 
was noted in the cells within the microenvironment such as the monocyte derived cells, dendritic 
cells and the macrophages.47Collectively these observations suggest strong influence of pro  
inflammatory and immunosuppressive microenvironment in PTCL .47
In this context PD-1 modulation may provide a benefit by enhanc ing immune responses in subjects 
with PTCL. Results from a phase I trial are indicative of activity of nivolumab in PTCL. 
Additionally brentuximab vedotin appears active in PTCL, hence combination of these agents may 
provide a novel combination which will result in improving qual ity of responses. 
1.1.5 Unmet medical need in CTCL Mycosis Fungoides (MF) and Sezary 
Syndrome (SS)
The incidence of CTCL in the United States is 6.4/million/year.  MF and SS comprise 53 % of 
CTCL cases per year. Treatment for CTCL is stage dependent, wit h local therapies used for early 
stage and systemic therapies employed for extensive or relapsed  diseases.48The response to 
systemic therapy f or relapse d disease is often ephemeral and underscores the need for developing 
effective agents in this disease.49Numerous chemotherapeutic agents have shown activity in 
MF/SS. Gemcitabine has demons trated CRR of 11- 51% with duration  of response of 
10-15 months.50Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin has shown an ORR of 88% with di sease free 
survival of 13 months.51Additionally combination chemotherapy CHOP has shown an ORR of 
66% in subjects with CTCL.52Biological agents such as anti CD52 monoclonal antibody 
alemtuzumab and the fusion toxin denileukin diftitox targeting t he interleukin 2 receptor and 
bexarotene have also demons trated activity in CTCL (MF/SS).53,54.Recently novel agents such as 
HDACi (romidepsin and vorinostat) have been approved for the tre atment of MF/SS.55,56
Romidepsin has demonstrated activity in subjects with CTCL. Res ults from a phase II trial in 
96 subjects with CTCL demonstrated an ORR was reported as 34% & CRR 6%. The median 
durati on of r esponse was 15 months. Romidepsin was administered  as an intravenous i nfusion at 
a dose of 14mg/m2on days 1, 8 and 15 every 28 days. The commonly reported advers e events 
reported were mild and mainly involving the gastrointestinal tr act which included nausea, fatigue, 
infections, vomiting and decrease in white blood cells57. Vorinostat is another HDACi for the 
treatment of CTCL in subjects who have failed prior therapies. The pivotal study was a single 
agent vorinostat at an oral dose of 400 mg daily. The total numbe r of subjects in this phase II trial 
was 74. The trial demonstrated an ORR of 30%, the estimated med ian duration of response was 
168 days. The most common adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, nausea and anorexia.58
Nivolumab has demonstrated act ivity in subjects  with CTCL. In the phase I trial with nivolumab
the total number of subjects with CTCL (MF) was 13. Nivolumab was administered at 1 mg/kg intravenously followed by 3 mg kg intravenously every 2 weeks i n the expansion cohort. The 
response for MF cohort w as an ORR of 15% wit h PRR of (2, 15%) a nd SD in (9, 69%) sub jects. 
Importantly, the duration of response appears durable in the responding group. Overall the therapy 
is well tolerated with majority of adverse events reported as grades 1-2 .

Brentuximab vedotin has also demonstrated activity in subjects with CD30+ CTCL. In a phase II 
trial of 32 subjects with relapsed CTCL, brentuximab vedotin was administered at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg every 3 week up to 8 cycles with optional extension of additional 8 cycles for the 
responding subjects. The ORR was 70% (21/30), responses were ob served in all clinical stages. 
Additionally 54% of subjects were progression free at 12 months. The median maximum CD30 
expression by IHC of all subjects was 13 %( range 0-100%; 6 had < 5%), the median was noted to 
be higher in responders (CRR/PRR) 15%, versus non responders 3%  (p = 0.037) It was also 
demonstrated that subjects with CD30 expression less than 5% ha d a lower likelihood of clinical 
response (17% versus 83%; p=0.0046). Overall the therapy was wel l tolerated with majority of 
adverse events reported as grades 1-2.
59
There remains a significant need for new active agents in the t herapy of CTCL as the outcomes 
continue to be poor for the majority of subjects with recurring disease and relapses due to limited duration of responses. 
1.1.6 Rationale for nivolumab and brentuximab vedotin in CTCL (MF/SS)
With increased understanding of disease biology and the integration of novel agents in the 
treatment of NHL, the outcomes have improved. The progress is impeding in the management of 
T cell NHL, it is likely that elucidati on of pat hobiology will help to integrate novel agents in this 
disease to improve outcomes. Evidence is suggestive that the elements of microenvironment such 
as stromal cells, dermal fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cell s, infiltrating T cells, macrophages, 
mast cells produce different types of growth factors, cytokines and chemok ines which cause
disease progression in subjects with CTCL.
60Recent reports have shown increased expression of 
ICR and the associated ligands in subjects with T NHL. Wilcox et  al demonstrated increased 
expression o f B7-H1 (PD-L1, CD 274) a member of the co stimulatory/co inhibitory ligands by the 
tumor cells, monocytes and the tumor infiltrating monocytes wit hin the tumor microenvironment. 
The report also highlighted the role of PD-L1 in the suppressio n of host immunity by promoting 
induction of T regulatory FoxP3+ cells and inhibiting the effec ts of immune T cells in sub jects
with TNHL including CTCL and PTCL47. In another report from Kantekure et al the expression 
of PD-1 and PD-L1 in subjects with different stages of CTCL were examined. The study identified
PD-1 as an important immunosuppressive protein, promoting immun e inhibition in subjects with 
CTCL.61This suggests that PD-1 modulation by treatment with a PD-1 blocking antibody may 
result in clinical benefits by enhancing host immune response. R esults from a Phase I trial in 
hematological malignancies are suggestive of activity of anti PD1 (Nivoulmab) in subjects with T NHL. Subjects with CTCL (MF/SS) have demonstrated variable expr ession of CD30. 
Brentuximab vedotin has demonstrated activity in CTCL (MF/SS) .
59
Given that nivolumab and brentuximab vedotin have demonstrated a ctivity in subjects with CTCL 
(MF/SS), the combination has the potential of demonstrating incre ased activity which may 
translate into improving quality of responses in this patient p opulation.

1.1.7 Unmet Need in Primary Mediastinal B Lymphoma (PMBL)
PMBL is a distinct type of Non Hodgkin Lymphoma NHL derived fro m the thymic B cells62
PMBL is a rare NHL which compromises only 2-4 % of NHL and 10% of cases of DLBCL. PMBL 
affects subjects in the third and fourth decade of life with a female predominance63. The 
therapeutic approach to PMBL remains an active area of debate. C hemo immunotherapy is used 
in the frontline treatment with promising responses. However pr ognosis is poor for subjects who 
relapse following front line therapy62. The increased efficacy of dose dense regimens in this 
disease suggests that this requires a unique therapeutic approa ch62. During the pre- rituximab era, 
reports with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and pr ednisone (CHOP-like)
chemotherapy and radiation consolidation demonstrated suboptima l outcomes manifested by early 
progression and poor salvage options64. In the current chemo immunotherapy era, reports 
integrating rituximab with CHOP or third-generation regimens (e g, methotrexate, leucovorin, 
doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone and bleo mycin [MACOP-B]) have 
resulted in favorable outcomes with cure rates generally in the  range of 80% compared with 
approximately 50% in the pas t62,65,66,67. The Mab thera International (MinT) study, an important 
study in high grade B cell lymphomas. This study also included su bjects with PMBL. In this study, 
subjects were treated with CHOP-like chemotherapy with or witho ut rituximab. The number of 
subjects with PMBL was 87. The study demonstrated that rituximab  treatment resulted in 
significantly improved r ate of CR (90 versus 54 %) decrease in the rate of progression ( 3 versus 
24 %) and increase in the rate of 3 years event free survival (78 versus 52%) and overall survival 
(89 versus 78)68.
There has also been interest in intensifying chemotherapy with integration of dose dense regimen. 
In this context, results from a single center Phase II prospective study appear promising for the 
treatment of PMBL. In this study, total number of subjects with n ewly diagnosed PMBL was 51.
Subjects were treated with six to eight cycles of dose-adjusted etoposide, doxorubicin, 
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab (da-EP OCH-R). All subjects were 
supported with growth factors and antimicrobial prophylaxis trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. After a median follow-up of 63 months, the reported rates of eve nt-free and overall survival at five 
years were 93 percent and 97 percent (95% CI 81-99%), respectively. Approximately  10-30% of 
patients relapse after first line therapy. There is no standard therapy for relapsed or refractory 
PMBL. The general approach is to salvage subjects with chemo immunotherapy and if subjects 
demonstrate chemo sensitivity, consolidate with high dose thera py and hematopoietic stem cell 
transplan t
64.  Prior to the immunotherapy era, the outcomes reported were inferior with sal vage 
therapy in PMBL as compared to DLBCL;  ORR 25% PMBL vs 48% in DLB CL, 2 year survival 
15% PMBL vs 34% DLBCL64. Outcomes have improved in the rituximab era, 4 year PFS 69% 
have been reporte d65,69. In a retrospective study, a total of 44 subjects with relapsed/ refractory 
PMBL were treated with high dose therapy and autologous stem ce ll transplant (ASCT). 
Approximately 41% of the subjects were refractory to front line treatment. The ORR after 
HDT/ASCT was 77% with CR of 63.6%. With a median follow-up of 5 3.5 months the OS and 
PFS at 4 years were 70 and 61% respectively. The OS at 4 years was 61% for subjects with primary

refractory disease69. It has been observed that the outcomes remain dismal for subj ects with chemo 
refractory disease and for subjects who relapse after ASCT, underscoring the need for novel agents 
in this disease62,64. Pembrolizumab, a check point inhibitor, which has demonstrated a ctivity in 
relapsed PMBL. In a phase IB study subjects with relapsed PMBL w ere treated with single agent 
pembrolizumab. The total number of subjects with relapsed PMBL w as 16. The study reported 
ORR of 38%, with 6% CR, the median DOR was not reached, range (.03-17 months), additionally 
6/16= 38% subjects progressed. Th e median follow up was 5 months70. The single agent activity 
of pembrolizumab appears less promising in PMBL as compared to its single agent activity in 
relapsed classical HL, where ORR were reported as 65%70,71. This suggests, perhaps efficacy can 
be improved by combining novel agents. Another novel agent, BV has also demonstrated activity 
in PMBL. In a phase II study of subjects with relapsed DLBCL, 6 subjects were enrolled with the 
diagnosis of relapsed PMBL. The subjects were treated with single agent BV. The median follow up was 6.6 months for all subjects participating in the study ( range 2.2-22.7+). Preliminary 
evidence of activity of BV were reported in subjects with PMBL,  out of 6 subjects, 1 subject 
demonstrated CR, 3 subjects demonstrated Stable Disease (SD) an d 2 subjects progressed. 
Important to note that this is a small cohort of subjects treated  with single agent BV
76. BV has also 
been used in frontline treatment of PMBL in combination with che mo immunotherapy72.
1.1.8 Rationale for nivolumab combination with brentuximab vedotin in 
PMBL
PMBL is derived from medullary thymic B cell. PMBL has a B cell phenotype and e xpresses 
CD20, CD79a, CD30, CD10, CD23, BCL6 where as CD15 is negative62,63.The CD30 expression 
is dim as compared to cHL. Gene expression profiling has demons trated similarities among PMBL 
and nodular sclerosing Hodgkin Lymphoma (NSHL )63. Some of the common genetic aberrations 
reported include abnormalities on chromosomes 9p and 2p. The PD1 ligand genes, PD-L1 and 
PD-L2 are located on chromosome 9p24.1.73Chromosome 9p24.1 amplification and increased 
expression of the PD-1 ligands has been reported in Classical H odgkin Lymphoma (cHL) and 
PMBCL cell lines.74Some studies have demonstrated and identified 9P24.1/CD274 
(PD-L1)/PDCD1LG2(PD-L2), copy gain and increased expression of the PD-1 ligands in 65% of 
PMBLs74. In another molecular analysis of PMBL and DLBCL, twenty-three of 32 (72%) PMBLs 
but only 1 of 37 (3%) DLBCLs were noted to demonstrate expression of PD-L2 by Immunohistochemistry (IHC). These findings are highly suggestive  of the presence of 9p24 
genetic aberration in subjects with PMBL.  This has critical im plication for drug development, as 
these constitute important targets based on the inhibition of P D1 receptors and the PD1 ligand 
PDL1 and PDL2 for PMBL
73,75.
Given the variable expression of C30 that is observed in PMBL along with presence of 9p24 amplification, there is rationale to combine BV with nivolumab in PMBL.

1.1.9 Unmet Medical Need in Mediastinal Gray Zone Lymphoma (MGZL)
MGZL is an extremely rare form of NHL. MGZL affects, the majori ty of the time, the mediastinum 
of young subjects with a male propensity  62,76. The World Health Organization recognizes MGZL 
a rare lymphoma with features analogous and intermediate between  NSHL and PMBL62. T h e  
clinical characteristics and treatment have not been formulated and standardized due to the scarcity 
of the disease. Subjects with MGZL are treated with chemo immunotherapy similar to PMBL. The 
outcomes are inferior as compared to subjects with PMBL and NSH L 62,77. In a prospective study 
where subjects were treated with infusional dose-adjusted etopo side, doxorubicin and 
cyclophosphamide with vincristine, prednisone and rituximab (da -EPOCH-R), the event free 
survival and overall survival we re 62% and 74% at 59 months med ian follow up77. Although the 
numbers are small, there is evidence of activity with BV in sub jects with MGZL. In a phase II 
study of subjects with relapsed DLBCL, 6 subjects were enrolled  with the diagnosis of relapsed 
MGZL. The subjects were treated with single agent BV. The media n follow up was 6.6 months 
for all subjects participating in the study (range 2.2-22.7+). Preliminary evidence of activity of BV 
were reported in subjects with MGZL. For the 6 patients with MG ZL enrolled on this study,
responses reported were 1 CR and 2 PRs76. Due to low incidence of this lymphoma, there is 
scarcity of data on the treatment in the front line and relapsed setting. Most subjects are treated similar to relapsed PMBL
77.
1.1.10 Rationale for nivolumab combination with brentuximab vedotin in 
MGZL
Since the outcome remains dismal for relapsed refractory MGZL, incorporation of novel agents is 
needed to improve outcomes in therapy. MGZL similar to PMBL, exp resses CD 20 and CD30. 
The expression of CD 30 is dim and variable and the expression o f CD 20 is low. The molecular 
characterization of mediastinal grey zone lymphoma is an area of research. Molecular analysis has 
demonstrated amplifications in 2p16.1 (REL/BCL11A locus) as wel l as alteration of the 
JAK2/PDL2 locus. Alterations affecting the JAK2/PDL2 locus in 9 p24 have been reported in 55% 
of subjects with MGZL78. Additionally studies suggest s imilarities in the epigenetic ch aracteristics 
in PMBL, NSHL and MGZL. 
Given the variable expression of C30 that is observed in MGZL along  with presence of 9p24 
amplification, there is rationale to combine BV with nivolumab in MGZL.
1.1.11 Rationale for permitting continued treatment in select cases of PD
Immune therapies have been noted to be associated with atypical  responses known as tumor flare 
or immune r elated response.79,80There is increasing evidence that subjects treated with immune 
therapies including checkpoint inhibitors may manifest disease progression (by conventional 
response criteria) before demonstrating clinical objective resp onses and/or stable disease. Ongoing 
clinical trials wit h nivolumab have reported  this phenomenon in approx imately 10% of subjects.81
Similar response has also been observed with other immune therapies. Treatment with antiviral 
agent in combination with interleukin-12 demonstrated evidence of objective responses after an

initial P rogressive Disease (PD) in a patient with human immunodeficienc y virus related kaposi 
sarcoma.82The exact etiology for this phenomenon remains unknown. There is suggestion that 
enhanced inflammation within tumors results in increase in tumor size which may manifest as 
enlarged index lesions and as newly visible small non-index lesions. Over time, both the malignant 
and inflammatory portions of the mass may then decrease leading to overt signs of clinical 
improvement. Alternatively, in some individuals, the kinetics of tumor growth may initially outpace anti-tumor immune activity. With sufficient time, the a nti tumor activity will dominate 
and become clinically apparent. Given the observation of this p henomenon, subjects will be 
allowed to continue study therapy (nivolumab and brentuximab vedotin) after initial 
investigator-assessed Response Evaluation Criteria (Lugano Lymp homa 2014, Response Criteria 
in MF/SS; consensus Global Response Score) defined progression.

to be deriving clinical benefit and if they continue to meet th e following criteria;
1. Investigator-assessed clinical benefit
2. Stable performance status
3. Treatment beyond dis ease progression will not delay an imminen t intervention to prevent 
serious complications of disease progression
4. Subject will be re-consented for treatment beyond progressive disease

1.1.12 Rationale and Aims for Biomarker Assessments
The biological basis of nivolumab in the treatment of oncologic al disease is to modulate the 
immune system to both generate and restore a durable anti-tumor response leading to clearance of 
tumor. The nivolumab clinical data supports the hypothesis that  inhibition of the PD 1 pathway 
results in rejection of tumor by the host immune system. Additionally, in the lymphoid 
malignancies, PD-1 blockade in the tumor microenvironment appea rs a biologically important 
parameter to c orrelate with response. Brentuximab vedotin has shown to execute  anti tumor effects 
by inducing cell death and apoptosis, along with immune modulati on through i nduction of ICD. 
Understanding the biology of tumor microenvironment both pre and post treatment will be crucial 
for evaluating the role of combination in modulation of the imm une system and its response to 
PD-1 blockade. In this context, relevant biomarker panels will be obtained in this trial, see 
Section 5.6 .  
The precise mechanisms by which nivolumab exerts its anti-tumor  activity is unclear, however, 
particular cell types, such as eff ector T cells and regulatory T cells are critical f or the anti-tumor 
response. The 9p24 amplicon induces JAK2, and gene dose dependent JAK-STAT induces PD-1ligand transcription. Effects of nivolumab on JAK/STAT pathway (pJAK2, pSTAT1 and 
pSTAT3), will be evaluated in DLBCL and T NHL.
Therefore, the major questions that will be addressed are: 
•Does expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells prior to therapy correla te with clinical efficacy to 
combination therapy?

•Can we define distinct pharmacodynamic markers of combination t herapy in the peripheral 
compartment?
•How does nivolumab in combination with brentuximab vedotin alte r the activating and 
negative costimulatory molecules on immune cells in the periphe ry and at the tumor site? Are 
there any distinct mechanisms of resistance to nivolumab?
•Does the composition and phenotype of the tumor microenvironment correlate with clinical 
efficacy?
•Does the treatment with brentuximab vedotin enhance effects of nivolumab?
•Is there a correlation between the effects of combination therapy and immune related genes, 
cytokines and signaling pathways?
1.1.13 Rationale for Study Design
CA209436 is a Phase I/II open-label study of nivolumab combined with brentuximab vedotin to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy in subjects with relapsed and/or  refractory DLBCL, PTCL
(excluding ALCL) and CTCL (MF/SS). CD30 expression t1% by IHC is a prerequisite for all 
subjects participating in this study. A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation period will be 
conducted for the first 6 subjects during cohort A (Dose Evaluat ion Phase). In this  cohort the first 
dose of brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg will be given on Cycle 1 Day 1. The first dose of nivolumab 
240 mg flat dose w ill be given on Cy cle 1 Day 8. Subsequent  to cycle 1, both drugs w ill be 
administered on the first day of the new cycle. Brentuximab ved otin will be administered first as 
a 30-minute infusion followed by a minimum 30-minute rest. Nivo lumab will then be administered 
as a 30-minute infusion. By administering brentuximab vedoti n, a directly cytotoxic agent which 
also induces ICD, it is anticipated that the tumor associated a ntigens will be released and available 
for presentation to cytotoxic T cells, which may enhance effect s of nivolumab. Given the long 
half-life of nivolumab, there is no rationale to continue stagge red dosing beyond Cycle 1. 
In Cohort A, the safety of the combination treatment w ill be evalu ated by the BMS study team
along with the Seattle Genetics study team and the investigators participating in the trial pri or to 
expansion of enrollment to evaluate treatment effect in Cohort B, as detailed in  Section 4.5.1
After 6 DLT-evaluable subjects have been followed throughout th e first 6 weeks of treatment, or 
at the point that 2 or more subjects experience a DLT, whichever comes first, the study team will 
review the available data and provide a ny of the follo wing recommendations, that may include but 
are not limited to:
1. If one or none (d 1) of the 6 subjects experience a DLT, the expansion cohort wil l begin with 
brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg Cycle 1 Day 1 and nivolumab 240 mg flat dose on Cycle 1 
Day 8. 
2. If two or more ( t2) of the 6 subjects are determined to have had a DLT based on the protocol 
definition (refer to section 4.5.1 ), the following options will be considered
a. To repeat Cohort A of the study and treat up to 6 additional subjects at the same drug doses 
and schedule previously tested

b. To repeat Cohort A of the study and treat up to 6 additional subjects at a reduced dose of 
brentuximab vedotin 1.2 mg/kg;
c. Administrati on of the com bination treatment on Day  1 of every  cycle, including cycle 1
d. To close the study to additional enrollment. 
Cohort B of the study w ill furt her characterize safety and evaluate the antitumor acti vity of
brentuximab vedotin combined with nivolumab in subjects with re lapsed and/or refractory
DLBCL, PTCL (excluding ALCL), PMBL, MGZL and CTCL (MF/SS) who hav e failed prior 
chemotherapy or autologous transplant or are ineligible for aut ologous transplant. The Expansion 
Phase (Cohort B) plans to treat approximately 130 subjects.
If the combination of nivolumab and brentuximab vedotin is considered safe based on the DLT 
evaluation, nivolumab will be a 240 mg flat dose for the expansion  cohort q 3 weeks administered 
as a 30-minute infusion.
1.1.13.1 Rationale for Dose Selection 
Brentuximab Vedotin
The recommended dose for brentuximab vedotin per its prescribin g information is 1.8 mg/kg via 
intravenous (IV) i nfusion administered every 3 weeks (first day of every tr eatment cy cle). This 
dose and schedule was evaluated in two pivotal phase 2 studies in subjects with CD30-positive 
hematologic malignancies.
Nivolumab
In both Cohorts A and B, the first dose of nivolumab 240 mg flat via 30 minute IV  infusion will 
be given on Cycle 1 Day 8. Subsequent to cycle 1, both drugs wi ll be administered on the first day 
of the new cycle (every 3 weeks). The rationales for using the fl at dose, every 3 week dosing 
intervals, and 30-minute infusion times are provided in s ection 1.1.13.2 , section 1.1.13.3 ,a n d  
section 1.1.13.4 .
1.1.13.2 Flat Dose Rationale
The flat dose of 240 mg was selected based on clinical data and  modeling and simulation 
approaches using population PK (PPK) and exposure-response anal yses of data from studies in 
multiple tumor types ( melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer [NSCLC], and renal cell carcinoma 
[RCC]) where body weight normalized dosing (mg/kg) has been use d.
PPK analyses have shown that the PK of nivolumab is linear with  proportional exposure over a 
dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/ kg, and no differences in PK across ethnicities and tum or types were 
observed. Nivolumab clearance and volume of distribution were f ound to increa se as the body 
weight increases, but less than the proportional with increasin g weight, indicating that mg/kg 
dosing represents an over-adjustment for the effect of body weight on nivolumab PK. The PPK 
model previously developed using data from NSCLC subjects has r ecently been updated, using 
data from 1544 subjects from 7 studies investigating nivolumab in the treatment of melanoma,

BMS-936558 nivolumab
NSCLC, and RCC. In this dataset, the median (minimum - maximum) weight was 77 kg 
(35 kg - 160 kg) and thus, an approximately equivalent dose of 3 m g/kg for an 80 kg subject, 
nivolumab 240 mg flat dose was selected for future investigation . To predict relevant summary 
exposures of nivolumab 240 mg flat, the PPK model was used to si mulate 100 virtual trials, with 
1000 subjects per treatment arm (240 mg flat dose or 3 mg/kg) ran domly sampled from 
aforementioned pooled database of cancer subjects. Because no di fferences in PK were noted 
across ethnicities and tumor type s, these simulated melanoma an d NSCLC data are applicable to 
subjects with other tumor types. The simulated geometric mean Cavgss  predicted for 240 mg flat 
dose every 2 week are predicted to be similar for all sub jects in reference to 80 kg subjects 
receiving 3 mg/kg every 2 week.
Nivolumab is safe and well tolerated up to 10 mg/kg every 2 week dose level. Adverse events have 
been broadly consistent across tumor types following monotherap y and have not demonstrated 
clear dose-response or exposure-response relationships. Additio nally, the simulated median and 
95thprediction interval of nivolumab summary exposures across body weight range (35 - 160 kg) 
are predicted to be maintained below the corresponding observed highest exposure experienced in 
nivolumab ie, 95thpercentile following nivolumab 10 mg/kg every 2 week from clinic al study 
CA209003. Thus, while subjects in the lower body weight ranges would have greater exposures 
than 80 kg subjects, the exposures are predicted to be within t he range of observed exposures at
doses (up to 10 mg/kg every 2 week) used in the nivolumab clinic al program, and are not 
considered to put subjects at increased risk. For subjects with greater body weights, the simulated 
ranges of exposures are also not expected to affect efficacy, bec ause the exposures predicted 
following administration of a 240 mg flat dose every 2 week are on the flat part of the exposure-
response curves for previously investigated tumors, melanoma and NSCLC.
1.1.13.3 Every 3 Week Dosing Interval Rationale
For previously approved indications of melanoma and NSCLC and for other indications currently 
being investigated using the flat dose, the dosing frequency fo r nivolumab monotherapy is 3 mg/kg 
and 240 mg flat dose, respectively, every 2 weeks. Nivolumab over  a dose range of 0.3 mg/kg to 
10 mg/kg has been studied as monotherapy and in combination in several tumor types using an 
every 3 weeks dosing regimen. It has been demonstrated that fol lowing administration of 
nivolumab 0.3 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks, > 90%  receptor occupancy (RO) is 
achieved beginning with the first cycle. Because nivolumab will  be administered in combination 
with brentuximab vedotin, which has every 3 week dosing and the s upporting RO data, the 
nivolumab dosing regimen in this study will be 240 mg flat dose a dministered every 3 weeks with 
brentuximab vedotin.
1.1.13.4 Thirty Minute Infusion Time Rationale
Long infusion times place a burden on subjects and treatment centers. Establishing that nivolumab 
can be safely administered using shorter infusion times of 30 m inutes duration in subjects will 
diminish the burden provided no change in safety profile. Previ ous clinical studies show that 
nivolumab has been administered safely over 60 minutes at doses  ranging up to 10 mg/kg over

long treatment duration. In Study CA209010, (a Phase 2, randomi zed, double blinded, 
dose-ranging study of nivolumab in subjects with advanced/metas tatic clear cell RCC) a dose 
association was observed for infusion site reactions and hypers ensitivity react ions (1.7% at 
0.3 mg/kg, 3.7% at 2 mg/kg and 18.5% at 10 mg/kg). All the event s were grade 1-2 and were 
manageable. An infusion duration of 30 minutes for 240 mg flat dose of nivolumab (~ 30% of the 
dose provided at 10 mg/kg) is not expected to present any safet y concerns compared to the prior 
experience at 10 mg/kg nivolumab dose infused over a 60 minute duration.
1.2 Research Hypothesis 
The study will investigate the hypothesis that brentuximab vedotin can be safely combined with 
nivolumab. Additionally the study will investigate that the comb ination can result in a clinical

1.4 Product Development Background
1.4.1 Clinical Pharmacology Summary (Nivolumab)
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of nivolumab was studied in subjects over a dose range of 0.1 to 
10 mg/kg administered as a single dose or as multiple doses of nivolumab every 2 or 3 weeks. The 
geometric mean (% CV%) cl earance (CL) was 9.5 mL/h (49.7%), geo metric mean volume of 
distribution at steady state (Vss) was 8.0 L (30.4%), and geometric mean elimination half-life 
(t1/2) was 26.7 days (101%). Steady-state concentrations o f nivolumab were r eached by 12 weeks 
when administered at 3 mg/kg Q2W, and systemic accumulation was approximately 3-fold. The 
exposure to nivolumab increased dose proportionally over the do se range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg 
administered every 2 weeks. The clearance of nivolumab increased with increasing body weight. 
The PPK analysis suggested that the following factors had no clinically important effect on the CL of nivolumab: age (29 to 87 years), gender, race, baseline LDH,  PD-L1. A PPK analysis suggested 
no difference in CL of nivolumab based on age, gender, race, tumor type, baseline tumor size, and hepatic impairment. Although ECOG status, baseline glomerular fi ltration rate (GFR), albumin, 
body weight, and mild hepatic impairment had an effect on nivolumab CL, the effe ct was not 
clinically meaningful. When nivolumab is administered in combin ation with ipilimumab, the CL 
of nivolumab was increased by 24%, whereas there was no effect on the clearance of ipilimumab.

1.4.2 Clinical Pharmacology Summary (Brentuximab Vedotin)
The PK of brentuximab vedotin was assessed in phase 1 and 2 tri als in oncology patients. 
Maximum serum concentrations of brentuximab vedotin antibody-dr ug conjugate (ADC) were 
generally observed close to the end of the 30 minute IV infusio n. ADC exposures increased 
approximately dose proportionally from  1.2 to 2.7 mg/kg, and there was minimal to no 
accumulation upon multiple-dosing on a Q3W schedule. Serum ADC concentrations declined in a 
multi-phasic manner, with a terminal half-life of approximately 4 to 6 days. The mean Vss  of the 
ADC was approximately 6 – 10 L, suggesting limited or modest extravascular distribution. 
Following administration of brentuximab vedotin, free or unconj ugated MMAE levels were 
quantifiable in plasma, though at concentrations that were markedly (roughly 1/10th to 1/40th on 
a molar basis) lower than those of the ADC. Maximum plasma MMAE concentrations were 
attained approximately 1 to 3 days after the infusion. MMAE exp osures decreased by 
approximately 20% to 50% with continued administration of brentuximab vedotin (relative to the 
first dose). Based on a population PK analysis, gender, age and  race do not have a meaningful 
effect on the PK of brentuximab vedotin. Patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A to C) exhibited a trend toward moderate decreases in ADC exposures , but increases in MMAE 
exposures of approximately 2.3 - fold. ADC and MMAE exposures were not meaningfully altered by mild or moderate renal impairment; however, severe renal imp airment (CrCl < 30 m L/min) was 
associated with a trend toward moderate decreases in ADC exposu res, but increases in MMAE 
exposures of approximately 1.9 - fold.
Further details on the clinical pharmacology of brentuximab ved otin can be found in the 
Investigator Brochure.
1.4.3 Safety Summary (Nivolumab)
The overall safety experience with nivolumab, as a monotherapy or in combination with other 
therapeutics, is based on experience in approximately 8,600 sub jects treated to date. Overall, the 
safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy as well as combination therapy is manageable and 
generally consistent across completed and ongoing clinical tria ls with no MTD reached at any dose 
tested up to 10 mg/kg. There was no pattern in the incidence, s everity, or causality of AEs to 
nivolumab dose level. Most AEs were low-grade (Grade 1 to 2) wi th relatively few related high-
grade (Grade 3 to 4) AEs. Most high-grade events were manageabl e with the use of corticosteroids 
or hormone replacement therapy (endocrinopathies) as instructed in the management algorithms 
provided in Appendix 6  and nivolumab investigator brochure. The spectrum, frequency, and 
severity of drug-related AEs were generally similar across the dose levels tested. A review of the 
safety data by tum or type (RCC, NSCLC, mCRPC, CRC, and melanoma) also did not show any 
clinically meaningful diffe rences in the proporti on of subjects with AEs noted across tumor type. 
Although tum or progression was the most common cause of mortality, there were 3 drug-related 
deaths associated with grade 3-4 pneumonitis. Pneumonitis (any grade) occurred in 12 of 306 
subjects (4%), and grade 3-4 pneumonitis occ urred in 4 subjects (1 %), with clinical presentations 
ranging from asymptom atic radiographic abnormalities t o progressive, diffuse pulmona ry 
infiltrates associated with cough, fever, and/or dyspnea. No cl ear relationship between the

occurrence of pneumonitis and tumor type, dose level, or treatment duration was noted. In 9 of 12 
subjects, pneumonitis was reversible with treatment discontinua tion and/or immunosuppression 
(glucocorticoids, infliximab, mycophenolate). 
Nivolumab, at 1 or 3 mg/kg, has an acceptable safety profile in subjects with relapsed or refractory 
hematologic malignancy. The following were the key safety findin gs for 105 subjects treated with 
nivolumab monotherapy in CA209039 as of 15-Apr-2015:
1. The most frequently reported drug-related AEs (> 10% of subje cts) were fatigue (16.2%) and
rash (10.5%). The majority were Grade 1-2 in severity.
2. The most frequently reported drug-related SAE was pneumonitis  (4.8%).
3. Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported for  14.3% of subjects. The most
frequently reported AE leading to discontinuation were pneumoni tis (2.9%).
4. The most frequently reported drug-related select AE categories were skin (19.0%), GI (9.5%), 
and pulmonary (9.5%). The most frequently reported ( t5% of total treated subjects) drug-
related select AEs were rash (10.5%), pneumonitis (9.5%), pruri tus (9.5%), and diarrhea 
(8.6%). Drug-related select AEs were mostly Grade 1-2 in all ca tegories.
5. Most deaths were due to disease progression. One death was re ported due to study drug toxicity 
(The subject with non Hodgkin’s lymphoma [small lymphocytic lymphoma] in the 3 mg/kg 
treatment group died due to Grade 5 pneumonitis with onset 10 d ays after the subject received 
the only dose of nivolumab).
Additional details on the safety profile of nivolumab, including results from other clinical studies, 
are also available in the Investigator Brochure (IB).
1.4.4 Safety Summary (Brentuximab Vedotin)
Two pivotal phase 2 studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of brentuximab vedotin as a single 
agent were performed in patients with relapsed or refractory Ho dgkin lymphoma (HL) and 
systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) (Studies SG035-0 003 and SG035-0004, 
respectively). Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) occurring  in t20% of HL and systemic 
ALCL patients in the phase 2 studies were peripheral sensory neuropathy (45%), fatigue (43%),
nausea (41%), diarrhea (34%), pyrexia (31%), upper respiratory tract infection (31%), neutropenia (21%), and vomiting (20%). These events were primarily Grade 1 o r  2 ,  w i th  th e  e x c e p ti on  of  
neutropenia, for which Grade 3 and Grade 4 events were reported for 13% and 7% of patients, respectively. Similar patterns and incidences of AEs were generally observed for HL and ALCL 
patients.
A phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluating effi cacy and safety of brentuximab 
vedotin in the treatment of patients with HL who are at risk of  disease progression following 
autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) has been completed (SGN3 5-005). A total of 329 patients 
were randomized (164 patients to brentuximab vedotin and 165 to  placebo) and there were 
327 patients who received study treatment (167 patients received at least 1 dose of brentuximab 
vedotin and 160 patients received placebo). AEs that had a highe r relative risk of occurring in 
patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm of Study SGN35-005 compared with patients in the

placebo arm (as indicated by a relative risk >1 and confidence intervals that do not include 1) were 
peripheral motor neuropathy, paresthesia, abdominal pain, const ipation, peripheral sensory 
neuropathy, weight decreased, neutropenia, nausea, myalgia, vom iting, diarrhea, and arthralgia.
Additional oncology clinical studies, compassionate-use program s, and postmarketing use have 
contributed further brentuximab vedotin safety data. Notable adv erse events observed with 
brentuximab vedotin treatment of various cancers to date include peripheral neuropathy, infusion-related reactions, and cytopenias; and, less commonly, progress ive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxi c epidermal necrolysis (TEN), 
tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), acute pancreatitis, pulmonary toxicity, and hepatotoxicity. In addition, concomitant use of brentuximab vedotin and bleomycin is contraindicated due to 
pulmonary toxicity that occurred in some patients receiving thi s combination of treatments.
1.5 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment
Subjects with relapsed/refractory Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (DLBCL, PTCL, CTCL, PMBL and 
MGZL) after progression on systemic therapy represent an area of substantial unmet medical need. 
Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant has the potential to offer cure in this patient population, majority 
of subjects are ineligible for this treatment due to age, refrac tory disease status or lack of suitable 
stem cell donor. Additionally allogeneic stem cell transplant h as significant risk of associated 
morbidity and mortality. Although a significant numbers of nove l agents are emerging in the 
treatment of relapsed NHL, the duration of response remains sho rt with the majority as single 
agents. Therefore the development of new approaches is needed i n relapsed NHL. The clinical 
activity of nivolumab observed to date in heavily pretreated su bjects with solid tumors as well as 
early results in NHL and HL suggests the potential for improved  clinical outcomes for these 
subjects. Additionally brentuximab vedotin has demonstrated pro mising activity in HL and NHL. 
Nivolumab and brentuximab vedotin also have the potential for clinically relevant adverse events including pulmonary toxicity, hepatotoxicity, diarrhea/colitis, endocrinopathies, nephrotoxicity, peripheral neuropathy and cytopenias. To date, serious AEs have  been manageable with prompt 
diagnosis and initiation of corticosteroids, dose interruption,  and adequate supportive care with 
both agents. Together the data suggest a positive benefit-risk potential, supporting a Phase I/II
study to further assess the safety and efficacy of nivolumab and brentuximab vedotin combination in subjects with relapsed, refractory DLBC, PTCL (excluding ALCL) , CTCL (MF/SS), PMBL & 
MGZL.

The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol. The protocol and any amendments 
and the subject informed consent w ill receive Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IRB/IEC) approval/favorable opinion prior to initiat ion of the study.
All potential serious breaches must be reported to BMS immediat ely. A serious breach is a breach 
of the conditions and principles of GCP in connection with the study or the protocol, which is 
likely to affect, to a significant degree, the safety or physic al or mental integrity of the subjects of 
the study or the scientific value of the study.
Personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified b y education, training, and 
experience to perform their respective tasks.
This study will not use the services of study personnel where s anctions have been invoked or where 
there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (eg, loss of medi cal licensure, debarment). 
2.2 Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee
Before study initiation, the investigator must have written and dated approval/favorable opinion 
from the IRB/IEC for the protocol, consent form, subject recrui tment materials 
(eg, advertisements) and any other written information to be prov ided to subjects. The investigator 
or BMS should also provide the IRB/IEC with a copy of the Invest igator Brochure or product 
labeling information to be provided to subjects and any updates.  
The investigator or BMS should provide the IRB/IEC with reports, updates and other information 
(eg, expedited safety reports, amendments, and administrative le tters) according to regulatory 
requirements or institution procedures.
2.3 Informed Consent
Investigators must ensure that subjects are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, potential 
risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they volunteer to participate. 
In situations where consent cannot be given to subjects, their legally acceptable representatives
(as per country guidelines) ar e clearly and fully  informed about  the purpose, potential risks, and 
other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which the subject volunteers to participate. BMS will provide the investigator with an appropriate (ie, Glob al or Local) sample informed 
consent form which will include all elements required by ICH, G CP and applicable regulatory 
requirements. The sample informed consent form w ill adhere to t he ethical principles that have 
their origin in the D eclaration of Helsinki.
Investigators must:1. Provide a copy of the consent form and written information ab out the study in the language in 
which the subject is most proficient prior to clinical study participation. The language must be 
non-technical and easily understood. 
2. Allow time necessary for subject or subject's legally accepta ble representative to inquire about 
the details of the study.

3. Obtain an informed consent signed and personally dated by the subject or the subject's legally 
acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the i nformed consent discussion. 
4. Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opinion of th e written informed consent form 
and any other information to be provided to the subjects, prior  to the beginning of the study, 
and after any revisions are completed for new information.
5. If informed consent is initially given by a subject’s legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the subject subsequently becomes capable of making and communicating his or 
her informed consent during the study, consent must additionally be obtained from the subject.
6. Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is 
relevant to the subject's consent. The investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, 
should fully inform the subject or the subject's legally accept able representative or legal 
guardian, of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new information relevant to the 
subject's willingness to continue participation in the study. T his communication should be 
documented. 
The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects mus t be protected, respecting the privacy 
and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements , the subjects' signed ICF and, in the 
US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Authorization.
The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and reg ulatory authorities have direct
access to subject records. Subjects unable to give their written consent (eg, stroke or su bjects with or severe d ementia) may 
only be enrolled in the study with the consent of a legally acceptable representative. The subject 
must also be informed about the nature of the study to the exte nt compatible with his or her
understanding, and should this subject become capable, he or sh e should personally sign and date 
the consent form as soon as possible. The exp licit wish of a subject who is unable t o give his or 
her written consent, but who is capable of forming an opinion an d assessing information to refuse 
participation in or to be withdrawn from, the clinical study at any time s hould be considered by 
the investigator.
The rights, safety, and well-being of the study subjects are th e most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
3.1 Study Design and Duration
This is an open-label, multicenter phase I/II study of nivoluma b in combination with brentuximab 
vedotin designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy in subject s with the diagnosis of 
relapsed/refractory DLBCL, PTCL (excluding ALCL), CTCL (MF/SS), PMBL, and MGZL. 
The study will consist of three phases: Screening, Treatment an d Follow-up. The treatment phase 
is divided in two parts: Cohort A consists of the Dose Evaluati on Phase and Cohort B is the 
Expansion Phase.
Revised Protocol No.: 01

2.0 Approved 930092648 2.0v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA209436
BMS-936558 nivolumab
It is anticipated that 170 subjects will be enrolled in the Uni ted States, Canada and Europe for the 
entire study (Cohort A and Cohort B combined). All subjects wil l undergo a screen ing period to 
determine eligibility within 28 days prior to init ial dosing.
Dose Evaluation Phase (Cohort A)
The Dose Evaluation Phase (Cohort A) will include a dose limiti ng toxicity (DLT) evaluation for 
the dose level of brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg intravenously i n combination with nivolumab 
240 mg flat dose intravenously in a q 3 week cycle. Refer to section 4.5.1 for further details.
In cycle 1, brentuximab vedotin 1.8mg/kg will be administered on day 1 where as nivolumab 
240 mg flat dose w ill be administered on day 8. Subsequent to cy cle 1, both drugs will be 
administered on the first day of the new cycle. Brentuximab ved otin will be administered first as 
a 30-minute infusion followed by a minimum 30-minute rest. Nivo lumab will then be administered 
also as a 30-minute infusion.  
The DLT evaluation period, which consists of the first dose of study drug through the first 6 weeks 
of treatment, will be conducted in the first 6 treated s ubjects (all co mers). Decisions to enroll up 
to 6 additional subjects onto the same dose of brentuximab vedoti n 1.8 mg/kg in combination with 
nivolumab 240 mg flat dose intravenously every 3 weeks or at a r educed dose of brentuximab 
vedotin at 1.2 mg/kg will be based on the safety data reviewed t hroughout the DLT evaluation
period.
If any of the first 6 treated subjects discontinue treatment for reasons other than a DLT but prior 
to completing the DLT evaluation period, then they will be repl aced. Subjects enrolled to Cohort 
A will be monitored for DLT throughout the DLT evaluation period. R efer to section 4.5.1 for 
DLT definition. 
After 6 DLT-evaluable subjects have been followed throughout the first 6 weeks of treatment, or 
at the point that 2 or more subjects experience a DLT, whichever  comes first, the study team will 
review the available data and provide any of the following recomme ndations that may include but 
are not limited to:
1) If one or none ( d1) of the 6 subjects experience a DLT, the expansion cohort will beg in with 
brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg Cycle 1 Day 1 and nivolumab 240 m g flat dose on Cycle 1 
Day 8. 
2) If two or more ( t2) of the 6 subjects are determined to have had a DLT based on the protocol 
definition (refer to section 4.5.1 ), the following options will be considered
a) To repeat Cohort A of the study and treat up to 6 additional s ubjects at the same drug doses 
and schedule previously tested 
b) To repeat Cohort A of the study and treat up to 6 additional subjects at a reduced dose of
brentuximab vedotin 1.2 mg/kg;
c) Administrati on of the combination tre atment on Da y 1 of every  cycle, including cycle 1
d) To close the study to additional enrollment.
NOTE: Doses may not be increased to above 1.8 mg/kg brentuximab  vedotin or nivolumab 
240 mg flat dose.

On review of all available data, the study team may determine t hat the classification of DLT was 
not appropriate for one or more of the subjects, in which case enrollment may resume if the target 
of 6 DLT-evaluable subjects has not yet been reached. However, i f 2 or more subjects were
determined to have experienced DLTs, then expansion will not oc cur as the next step. Based on 
the study team’s recommendations, up to 6 additional subjects may  be enrolled in Cohort A at the 
same drug dose levels and schedule or at a modified treatment (des cribed above in this section). 
These additional subjects w ill then be assessed for DLT in the same manner described a bove to 
determine if it is appropriate to move to the Expansion Phase ( Cohort B). If it is determined by the 
study team that due to safety concerns no add itional dose levels or schedules should be enrolled, 
then the study will be closed to enrollment.
There is no planned interim analysis (IA). However, all availab le efficacy and safety data will be 
used to select the recommended brentuximab vedotin dose and trea tment schedule that will be 
further evaluated in the Expansion Phase (Cohort B).Expansion Phase (Cohort B)
The Expansion Phase will consist of a single-arm phase II study  which will expand enrollment at 
the recommended dose level and treatment schedule as deemed saf e by the study team i n Cohort A. 
An additional 40 subjects in DLBCL (cohort B1), 30 subjects in PTCL (cohort B2) 20 subjects in 
CTCL (cohort B3), 30 subjects in PMBL (cohort B4) and 10 subject s in MGZL  (cohort B5) will 
be enrolled to complete this evaluation. 
If one or none ( d1) of the 6 subjects in cohort A experience a DLT, the expansio n cohort will 
begin with brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg Cycle 1 Day 1 and nivo lumab 240 mg flat dose on 
Cycle 1 Day 8. Subsequent to cycle 1, both drugs will be administered on the first day of the new 
cycle. Brentuximab vedotin will be administered first as a 30-m inute infusion followed by a 
minimum 30-minute rest. Nivolumab  will be then be administered as a 30-minute infusion. If two 
or more (t2) of the 6 subjects are determined to have had a DLT based on t he protocol definition 
(refer to  section 4.5.1 ) treatment modi fication or e nrollment closure will be considered, as 
described above.
All subjects in the study (Cohort A and Cohort B) w ill be allowed  to be treated until disease 
progression or unacceptable tox icity as described in Section 4.5.3 and Section 4.5.5 . If during 
therapy it appears that a subject is benefiting from the combination but experiencing toxicities 
related to one agent that would require permanent treatment disc ontinuation, then they have the 
option to continue therapy with the single agent not attributin g to toxicities.
Subjects that present progressive  disease during treatment may be allowed to be treated beyond 
progression until further progression is observed. Refer to Section 4.5.9 for further details.
Once subjects discontinue from study tr eatment for any reas on, subjects will enter the follow-up 
phase of the study. During follow-up long-term safety, survival status, disease progression, subsequent anticancer therapy and occurrence of other primary malignancy data will be collected. 
Follow-up visit 1 (X01) and follow-up visit 2 (X02) will be in p erson visits and all subsequent

follow-up visits may be done in person or by phone. All treated subjects w ill be followed for 
survival at least every  3 months until death or lost to follow -up. Subjects wit h residual toxicity G

deemed irreversible, whichever occurs first. Subjects who discontinue for reasons different than 
progressive disease must continue to perform tumor assessments as described in Section 5.4 until 
disease progression is documented. 
The primary endpoint for Cohort B will be investigator-assessed  ORR for all five tumor types. 
Primary endpoint analysis will occur 8 months after the last patient receives their first treatment 
(LPFT). Depending on the enrollment for each disease cohort, the  analysis may be done at different 
times for each cohort, or at the same time for the five c ohorts. The study design schematic is 
presented in Figure 3.1-1 .

3.3.3 Women of Childbearing Potential
A Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has experienced 
menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) and is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined a s 12 months of amenorrhea in 
a woman over age 45 years in the a bsence of other biological or  physiological causes. In addition, 
females under the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle st imulating hormone, (FSH) level 
> 40mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
*Females treated wit h hormone replacement therapy, (HRT) are li kely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order  to obtain a physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the inves tigators should use their

judgement in checking serum FSH levels. If the serum FSH level is > 40 mIU /ml at a ny time 
during the washout period, the woman can be considered postmenopausal:
•1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
•4 week minimum for transdermal products
•8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long as 6 months.
3.4 Concomitant Treatments
3.4.1 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments
The following medications are prohibited during the study (unle ss utilized to tr eat a drug related 
adverse event):
•Immunosuppressive agents
•Immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (except as stated in Section 3.4.2.1 )
•Any concurrent anti-neoplastic therapy (ie, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, 
extensive, non-palliative radiation therapy, or standard or investigational agents)
3.4.2 Other Restrictions and Precautions
Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with eit her corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily 
prednisone equivale nt) or other immunosuppressive medications with in 14 days of first dose are 
excluded. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 mg daily 
prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.
It is the local imaging facility’s responsibility to determine,  based on subject attributes (eg, allergy 
history, diabetic history and renal s tatus), the appropriate imaging mod ality a nd contrast regimen 
for each subject. Imaging contraindications and contrast risks s hould be considered in this 
assessment. Subjects with renal insufficiency should be assessed as to whether or not they should 
receive contrast and if so, what type and dose of contrast is appropriate. Specific to MRI, subjects with severe renal insufficiency (ie, estimated glomerular filtr ation rate (eGFR) 
< 30 mL/min/1.73m2) are at increased risk of nephrogenic systemic  fibrosis. MRI contrast should 
not be given to this subject population. In additi on, subjects are excluded from MRI if they have 
tattoos, metallic implants, pacemakers, etc.   
The ultimate decision to perform MRI in an individual subject i n this study rests with the site 
radiologist, the investigator and the standard set by the local Ethics Committee.

daily prednisone are permitted. A brief (less than 3 weeks) cou rse of corticosteroids for 
prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or for tr eatment of non- autoimmune conditions (eg, delayed-
type hypersensitivity reaction caused by a contact allergen) is permitted.
Concomitant palliative and supportive care for disease related symptoms (including 
bisphosphonates and RANK-L inhibitors) is allowed if initiated prior to first dose of study therapy. 
Palliative radiotherapy must have been completed at least 3 weeks prior to first dose. Palliative 
radiation therapy is allowed on study, study treatment must be held 2 weeks prior to and 2 weeks 
post treatment. 
The use of platelet and/or re d blood cell supportive growth factors or transfusions when applicable 
is allowed. The use of colony stimulating factors for the treatment of neutropenia per institutional 
practice is permitted during therapy.
Routine premedication for infusion reactions should not be admi nistered prior to the first dose of 
study drug(s). However, subjects who experience an infusion-related reaction may receive 
subsequent treatment with premedication as described in Section 4.5.6 .
Subjects who are receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitors concomitantl y with brentuximab vedotin 
should be closely monitored for adverse reactions.
Routine prophylaxis with vaccines is permitted pri or to study e ntry; it is recommended that 
vaccines used do not contain live micro-organisms.
3.5 Discontinuation of subjects following any treatment with study drug
Subjects MUST discontinue investigational product (and non-inve stigational product at the 
discretion of the  investigator) for any of the following reason s:
•Subject’s request to stop study treatment
•Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality or interc urrent illness which, in the 
opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the best 
interest of the subject
•Termination of the study by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS)
•Loss of ability to fr eely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily incar ceration 
for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectio us disease) illness
•Additional protocol specific reasons for discontinuation Section 4.5.5 and Section 4.5.3
In the case of pregnancy, the investigator must immediately noti fy the BMS Medical 
Monitor/designee of this event. In most cases, the study drug w ill be permanently discontinued in 
an appropriate manner. If the investigator determines a possibl e favorable benefit/risk ratio that 
warrants continuation of study drug and it is allowed by lo cal regulations, a discussion between 
the investigator and the BMS Medical Monitor/designee must occu r.
All subjects who discontinue study drug should comply with proto col specified follow-up 
procedures as outlined in Table 5.1-3 . The only exception to this requirement is when a subject

withdraws consent for all study procedures including post-treat ment study follow-up or loses the 
ability to consent freely (ie, is imprisoned or involuntarily i ncarcerated for the treatment of either 
a psychiatric or physical illness).
If study drug is discontinued prior to the subject’s completion of the study, the reason for the 
discontinuation must be documented in the subject’s medical rec ords and entered on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF) page.
3.6 Post Study Drug Study Follow up
In this study, overall survival is a key endpoint of the study. P ost study follow-up is of critical 
importance and is essential to preserving subject safety a nd the integrity of the st udy. Subjects who 
discontinue study drug must continue to be followed for collecti on of outcome and/or survival 
follow-up data as required and in line with Table 5.1-3 until death, withdrawal  of consent, lost to 
follow-up or the conclusion of the study.
In addition, subjects who discontinue study therapy by proceeding to allogeneic SCT or ASCT 
will require tumor assessment (CR or non-CR) by the investigato rs according to the Lugano 
Classification 2014 (DLBCL/PTCL) and consensus Global Response Score (CTCL) on day 100, at 6 months, 1 year and every year thereafter from the date of stem cell infusion until the first 
non-CR after SCT is documented. For the subjects who discontinue  study therapy by proceeding 
to allogeneic SCT, documentation of acute and chronic GVHD will  be simultaneously collected
see Appendix 5 for more details.
Subjects who discontinue study drug may continue to be followed. BMS may request that survival 
data be collected on all treated subjects outside of the 3 month specified visit schedule. At the t ime 
of this request, each subject w ill be con tacted to determine their survival status unless the subject 
has withdrawn consent for all contact.
3.6.1 Withdrawal of Consent
Subjects who request to discontinue study drug w ill remain in the study and must continue to be 
followed for protocol specified follow-up procedures. The only exception to this is when a subject 
specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him /her or persons previously 
authorized by subject to provide this information. Subjects should notify the investigator of the 
decision to withdraw consent from future follow-up in writing , whenever possible. The 
withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medic al records by the investigator, as 
to whether the with drawal is from furt her tr eatment with study drug only or also from study 
procedures and/or post treatment study follow-up, and entered o n the appropriate CRF page. In the 
event that vital status (whether the subject is alive or dead) i s being measured, publicly available 
information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately directed in accordance with local law.
3.6.2 Lost to Follow-Up
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing status. 
This includes follow-up with pe rsons authorized by the subject as noted above. Lost to follow-up

is defined by the inability to  reach the subject after a minimu m of three documented phone calls, 
faxes, or emails as well as lack  of response by subject to one registered mail letter. All attempts 
should be documented in the subject’s medical records. If it is  determined that the subject has died, 
the site will use permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of death.
If investigator’s use of third-party representative to assist i n the follow-up portion of the study has 
been included in the subject’s informed consent, then the inves tigator may use a Sponsor-retained 
third-party representative to assist site staff with obtaining subject’s contact information or other 
public vital status data necessary to complete the follow-up po rtion of the study. The site staff and 
representative will consult publicly available sources, such as public h ealth registries and 
databases, in order to obtain updated contact information. If after all attempts, the subject remains 
lost to follow-up, then the last known alive date as determined  by the investigator should be 
reported and documented in the subject’s medical records.

4.1 Investigational Product
An investigational product, als o known as investigational medic inal product in some regions, is 
defined a pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo  being tested or used as a reference 
in a clinical study, including products already with a marketin g authorization but used or 
assembled (formulated or packaged) differently than the authoriz e d  f o r m ,  o r  u s e d  f o r  a n  
unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form.
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area a ccording to local regulations. It is 
the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that investiga tional product is only dispensed to 
study subjects. The investigational product must be dispensed o nly  f rom  official study  si tes by 
authorized personnel according to local regulations.In this protocol, investigational products are:
•Nivolumab (BMS-936558) 
•Brentuximab Vedotin
4.2 Non-investigational Product
Other medications used as support or escape medication for prev entative, diagnostic, or therapeutic 
reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given diag nosis, may be considered as non-
investigational products. 
Not applicable for this study.
4.3 Storage and Dispensing
The product storage manager should ensure that the study drug i s stored in accordance with the 
environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity) as determined by BMS. If concerns 
regarding the quality or appearance of the study drug arise, the  study drug should not be dispensed
and contact BMS immediately.
Study drug not supplied by BMS will be stored in accordance with the package insert.
Investigational product documentation (whether supplied by BMS o r not) must be maintained that 
includes all processes required to ensure drug is accurately ad ministered. This includes 
documentation of drug storage, administration and, as applicable, storage temperatures, 
reconstitution, and use of required processes (eg, required diluents, administration sets).
4.3.1 Brentuximab Vedotin
Brentuximab vedotin will be administered every 21 (q 3 weeks) day s by IV infusion given over 
approximately 30 minutes. In the absence of infusion-related rea ctions, the infusion r ate for all 
subjects should be calculated in orde r to achieve a 30 minute infusion period . Brentuximab vedotin 
must not be administered as an IV push or bolus nor mixed with o ther medications. Brentuximab 
vedotin will be administered first as a 30 minute infusion foll owed by a minimum 30 minute rest 
prior to the nivolumab infusion.

Dosing is based on subject’s actu al body weight. Doses must be ad justed for subjects who 
experience a t10% change in weight from baseline. Other dose adjustments for c hanges in body 
weight are permitted per institutional standard. An exception to  weight-based dosing is made for 
subjects weighing greater than 100 kg; doses w ill be based on 100 kg for these individuals.
Rounding is permissible within 5% of the nominal dose.
Refrigeration should be set at 2–8°C for storage of vials and so lutions containing brentuximab 
vedotin. The controlled location must be accessible only to the pharmacist, the investigator, or a 
designated person. Brentuximab vedotin does not contain preserva tives; therefore, opened and 
reconstituted vials of brentuximab vedotin should be used as so on as possible. If not used 
immediately, the in-use storage should not be longer than 24 hours. It is recommended that 
brentuximab vedotin vials and solutions be protected from dir ect sunlight un til the time of use.
Reconstituted vials and solutions must not be shaken.
Drug product vials may be labeled as brentuximab vedotin, the U nited States adopted name 
(USAN) and the International Nonpropri etary N ame (INN), or as SGN 35, the compound code; 
the 2 names can be used interchangeably.Brentuximab vedotin vials are provided via single-use container s. Any partially used vials or 
diluted dosing solutions should be discarded using appropriate institutional drug disposal 
procedures.
Brentuximab vedotin should be reconstituted with 10.5mL of Ster ile Water for Injection, United 
States Pharmacopeia (USP) or equivalent (see Pharmacy Binder fo r details) for a final 
concentration of 5mg/mL. The vial should be gentl y swirled until  the contents are completely 
dissolved. The vial must not be shaken. The recons tituted drug product should be inspected 
visually for any particulate matter and discoloration.
The required volume of reconstituted drug product should be diluted into an infusion bag. The bag 
should be gently inverted to mix the solution. The bag must not be shaken. Prior to administration, the reconstituted and diluted drug product should be inspected visually f or any particulate matter 
and discoloration.
Detailed drug preparation and drug accountability instructions for brentuximab vedotin are 
provided in the Pharmacy Binder.
4.3.2 Nivolumab
Nivolumab will be administered every 21 days (q 3weeks) by IV i nfusion given over 
approximately 30 minutes. Nivolu mab (BMS-936558) vials must be stored at a temperature of 2°C 
to 8°C and should be protected from light and freezing. If stored in a glass front refrigerator, vials

4.4 Method of Assigning Subject Identification
After the subject’s initial eligibility is established and info rmed consent has been obtained, the 
subject must be enrolled into the study by calling an IVRS to obtain the subject number. Every 
subject that signs the informed consent form must be assigned a subject number in IVRS. Specific 
instructions for using IVRS w ill be provided to the investigational site in a separate document. 
The investigator (or designee) will register the subject for enrollment by following the enrollment 
procedures established by BMS. The following information is req uired for enrollment:
•Date of informed consent
•Date of birth
•Gender at birth
•Lymphoma Disease Diagnosis (DLBCL, PTCL, CTCL, PMBL, MGZL)
A separate call will need to be placed to assign eligible subjects their first tr eatment once the tumor 
tissue submitted to the central laboratory has gone through the quality assessment and the 
information is available in the IVRS.
4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
There will be 2 parts to this study. During the Dose Evaluation Phase (Cohort A) six eligible 
subjects will be enrolled and treated with brentuximab vedotin ( IV) 1.8 mg/kg as the starting dose 
and may be reduced to 1.2 mg/kg if toxicities described in Table 4.5.3-1 are observed. Subjects 
enrolled to C ohort A w ill be tr eated with a combination of brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab 
240 mg flat dose (IV) of every 3 week cycle. In cycle 1, brentuxi mab vedotin will be administered 
on day 1 where as nivolumab will be administered on day 8. Subs equent to cycle 1, both drugs 
will be administered on the first day of the new cycle. Brentuxi mab vedotin will be administered 
first as a 30-minute infusion followed by a minimum 30-minute rest. Nivolumab will be then be 
administered as a 30-minute infusion 
The starting dose of brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg is to be giv en over approximately 30 minutes
intravenously. In the absence of i nfusion rel ated reaction, the infusion r ate for all subjects should 
be calculated in order to achieve a 30-minute infusion period. Dosing calculations should be based 
on the subject’s actual body weight. If the subject’s weight on th e day of dosing differs by > 10% 
from the previous weight used to calculate the required dose, a  corrected dose must be recalculated. 
Other dose adjustments for changes in body weight are permitted  per institutional standard. All

doses should be rounded to the nearest milligram. Brentuximab ve dotin may be reduced to 
1.2mg/kg if toxicities described in Table 4.5.3-1 are observed. The Cohort B w ill open with a 
proposed dosing regimen with cycle durati on of 21 days (3 weeks) . Brentuximab vedotin will be 
administered based on the dose identified in Cohort A (1.8 mg/kg or 1.2 mg/kg) and nivolumab 
will be given over 30 min intravenously at a 240 mg flat dose.
An exception to weight-based brentux imab vedotin dosing is made for subjects weighing greater 
than 100 kg; doses will be based on 100kg for these individuals.  Rounding is permissible within 
5% for the nominal dose.There will be no dose escalations or reductions of nivolumab al lowed. There are no premedications 
recommended for nivolumab on the first cycle. If an acute infus ion reaction is noted, subjects 
should be managed according to Section 4.5.6 .
First dose of nivolumab will be administered on Cycle 1 Day 8, which is only 2 weeks away from
Cycle 2 Day 1. For safety reasons, subjects may be dosed no less than 12 days between doses. For 
all other cycles, treatment is to occur within 3 days of the sched uled dosing date. Dose given after 
the 3 day window is considere d a dose delay. T reatment may be d elayed for up to a maximum of 
6 weeks from the previous dose. Refer to Section 4.5.4 for further details .
Subjects will be monitored continuously for AEs while on study. Treatment modifications (eg, dose delay, interruption or discontinuation) will be based on specific laboratory and AE criteria (further details described in  Section 4.5.3 and Section 4.5.4 ).
4.5.1 Dose Evaluation Phase: (Cohort A)
The Dose Evaluation Phase (Cohort A) will include a dose limiti ng toxicity (DLT) evaluation for 
the dose level of brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg intravenously in combination with nivolumab 
240 mg flat dose intravenously in a q 3 week cycle. In cycle 1, br entuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg 
will be administered on day 1 where as nivolumab 240 mg flat dos e will be administered on day 8. 
Subsequent to cycle 1, both drugs will be administered on the f i r s t  d a y  o f  t h e  n e w  c y c l e .  
Brentuximab vedotin will be administered first as a 30-minute i nfusion followed by a minimum 
30-minute rest. Nivolumab will be then be administered as a 30- minute infusion.  
The DLT evaluation will be conducted in the first 6 treated sub jects (all comers). Decisions to 
enroll up to 6 additional subjects onto the same dose of brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg in 
combination with nivolumab 240 mg flat dose intravenously every 3 w eeks or at a reduced dose 
of brentuximab vedotin at 1.2 mg/kg will be based on the safety data reviewed throughout the DLT 
evaluation period. The DLT evaluation period consists of the first dose of study drug through the first 6 weeks of treatment.
If any of the first 6 treated subjects discontinue treatment for reasons other than a DLT, prior to 
completing the DLT evaluation period, then they w ill be repl aced. These subjects will be 
monitored for DLT throughout the DLT evaluation period (DLT def inition is provided further 
below in this section). After 6 DLT-evaluable subjects have bee n followed through the end of the 
DLT evaluatio n period, or at the point that 2 or more subjects experience a DLT, whichever comes 
first, the study team will review  the available data. The BMS s tudy team along with Seattle

Genetics study team and the investigators participating in the trial, will review all of the available 
safety data and provide any of the following recommendations tha t may include, but are not limited 
to:
1. One or none ( d1) of the 6 subjects experience a DLT, the expansion cohort wil l begin with 
brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg Cycle 1 Day 1 and nivolumab 240 m g flat dose on Cycle 1 
Day 8. Subsequent to cycle 1, both drugs will be administered on the first day of the new cycle. 
Brentuximab vedotin will be administered first as a 30-minute i nfusio n followed by a minimum 
30 minute rest. Nivolumab will be then be administered as a 30 min infusion.
2. If two or more ( t2) of the 6 subjects are determined to have had a DLT based on the protocol 
definition, the following options will be considered
a. To repeat Cohort A of the study and treat up to 6 additional subjects at the same drug 
doses and schedule previously tested 
b. To repeat Cohort A of the study and treat up to 6 additional subjects at a reduced dose 
of brentuximab vedotin 1.2 mg/kg;
c. Administration of the combination treatment on Day 1 of every  cycle, including cycle 1
d. To close the study to additional enrollment. 
NOTE: Doses may not be increased to above 1.8 mg/kg brentuximab  vedotin or nivolumab 
240 mg flat dose
On review of all available data, the study team may determine t hat the classification of DLT was 
not appropriate for one or more of the subjects, in which case enrollment may resume if the target 
of 6 DLT-evaluable subjects has not yet been reached. However, if 2 or more subjects were 
determined to have experienced DLTs, then expansion will not occur as the next step. Based on the study team’s recommendations, up to 6 additional subjects m ay be enrolled in Cohort A at the 
same drug doses and schedule or at a modified treatment (descri bed above in this section). These 
additional subjects will then be assessed for DLT in the same manner described above to determine if it is appropriate to move to the Expansion Phase (Cohort B). If it is determined by the study 
team that due to safety concerns no additional dose levels or s chedules should be enrolled, then 
the study will be closed to enrollment.
Dose Limiting Toxicity
The incidence of dose limiting toxicities assessed in the first 6 DLT-evaluable subjects beginning 
Cycle 1 Day 1 through the first 6 weeks of treatment w ill determine whether the combination, 
nivolumab with brentuximab vedotin is tolerable. A subject will be considered evaluable for DLT 
if they have received at least one dose of either drug in the f irst 6 weeks of treatment. However, if 
the subject discontinues treatment for reasons other than a DLT  prior to completing the DLT 
evaluation period, then they are notconsidered DLT evaluable and will be replaced. DLT should 
not be AEs considered by the investigator to be disease related . For the purpose of this study, DLTs 
are defined as any study drug-related toxicity (brentuximab vedo tin or nivolumab) that requires 
either a dose reduction or delay of more than 7 days of either s tudy drug in Cycle 2 or delays the 
Cycle 3 Day 1 administration of combined treatment by more than  7 days. The DLT evaluation 
period consists of the first dose of study drug through the fir st 6 weeks of treatment. The IBs for

brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab individually describe adverse  events commonly observed 
relative to either agent (ie, neutropenia or peripheral neuropat hy with brentuximab vedotin; 
immune-mediated adverse events with nivolumab), as well as less  common serious findings. 
However, the final decision regarding causality is at the discretion of the Investigator. 
There is no planned interim analysis (IA). However, all availabl e efficacy and safety data will be 
used to select the recommended dose that will be further evalua ted in the Expansion Phase 
(Cohort B).
4.5.2 Premedication
Routine premedication should not be administered for the preven tion of infusion-r elated reactions 
prior to the first dose of study drug(s). However, subjects shoul d be carefully monitored for 
infusion reactions during administration of study drug(s). If an  acute infusion reaction is noted, 
subjects should be managed according to  Section 4.5.6 .
Subjects should be individually evalu ated to assess the need for tumor lysis prophylaxis pri or to 
the first dose of brentuximab vedotin. Subjects should receive pr ophylaxis as appropriate per the 
institutional standards.
4.5.3 Dose Modifications for Brentuximab Vedotin
Table 4.5.3-1 describes the recommended dose modifications for brentuximab vedotin treatment 
associated toxicity. Doses reduced for brentuximab vedotin-rela ted toxicity should not be 
re-escalated without discussion with the sponsor. Dose escalatio n of brentuximab vedotin beyond 
1.8 mg/kg is not permitted.
Dose reductions below 1.2mg/kg are not allowed, and to xicities s hould be managed with dose 
delays.If brentuximab vedotin treatment is delayed for any reason, niv olumab must also be delayed until 
the subject has appropriately recovered and is able to resume t he combination treatment on the 
first day of the subsequent cycle. Nivolumab should only be giv en alone in case a decision has 
been made to permanently discontinue brentuximab vedotin.

Subjects who discontinue nivolumab due to a related AE may continue treatment with brentuximab 
vedotin monotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable t oxicity. The same applies in case 
subjects discontinue brentuximab  vedotin due to related AE and chose to continue on nivolumab 
monotherapy. During Cohort A, however, if subject meets disconti nuation criteria within the DLT

4.5.5.1 Management Algorithms for Immuno-Oncology Agents
Immuno-oncology (I-O) agents are associated with AEs that can d iffer in severity and duration 
than AEs caused by other therapeutic classes. Nivolumab is cons idered an immuno-oncology agent 
in this protocol. Early recognition and management of AEs assoc iated with immuno-oncology 
agents may mitigate severe toxicity. Management algorithms have  been developed to assist 
investigators in assessing and managing the following groups of  AEs:
Gastrointestinal
Renal
Pulmonary
Hepatic
Endocrinopathies
Skin
Neurological

2.0 Approved 930092648 2.0v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA209436
BMS-936558 nivolumab
For subjects expected to require more than 4 weeks of corticost eroids or other immunosuppressants 
to manage an AE, consider recommendations provided in the algor ithms. These algorithms are 
found in Appendix 6 and the Nivolumab IB. Discussions with the BMS Medical Monitor o n how 
to apply these algorithms are strongly encouraged. The guidance  provided in these algorithms 
should not replace the Investigator’s medical judgment but should complement it.
4.5.6 Treatment of Infusion Related Reactions (nivolumab/brentuximab 
vedotin)
Infusion-related reactions may occ ur during the infusion of stu dy treatment(s). The i nfusion should 
be administered at a site properly equipped and staffed to manage anaphylaxis should it occur. All 
supportive measures consistent wi th optimal patient care should  be given throughout the study 
according to institutional standa rds. Supportive mea sures may include extending the infusion time 
and/or administering medications for infusion-related reactions .
Infusion or hypersensitivity reactions may occur to either brentuximab vedotin or nivolumab. If such a reaction were to occur, it might manifest with fever, ch ills, rigors, headache, rash, pruritus, 
arthalgias, hypotension, hypertension, bronchospasm, or other a llergic-like reactions. Infusion 
reactions should be graded according to NCI CTCAE (Version 4.03) guidelines.
Subjects who experience a Grade 1 or Grade 2 i nfusion-related reaction should be premedicated 
for subsequent infusions. Premedication should be given at least 30 minutes prior to dosing study 
drug(s) and should include an antihistamine and corticosteroid. Recommended doses are:
diphenhydramine 25- 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and methylprednisolone 40 mg IV (or equivalent).
In addition, acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg and ranit idine 50 mg IV may be given. If 
the onset of a reaction occurs during an infusion, the infusion may be interrupted for treatment of the infusion-related reaction, including treatment with antihis tamines, corticosteroids, and/or 
bronchodilator therapy, as appropriate. Subjects who experience a Grade 3 infusion-related 
reaction to brentuximab vedotin or nivolumab may potentially re ceive additional treatment with 
the study drug(s) at the discretion of the investigator after d iscussion with the sponsor.
If anaphylaxis or a Grade 4 infusion-related reaction occurs, a dministration of the implicated 
agent(s) (brentuximab vedotin and/or nivolumab) should be immed iately and permanently 
discontinued.
In case of late-occurring hypersensitivity symptoms t o nivolumab (eg, appearance of a localized 
or generalized pruritus within 1 week after nivolumab treatment), symptomatic treatment may be 
given (eg, oral antihistamine or corticosteroids).
4.5.7 Management of Suspected PML
Signs and symptoms of PML may include altered mental status, motor deficits such as hemiparesis 
or ataxia, visual disturbances, or higher cortical dysfunction such as dysphasia or agnosia. See the 
brentuximab vedotin (IB) for further details.

BMS-936558 nivolumab
If PML is suspected, hold further dosing of brentuximab vedotin  and nivolumab and undertake a 
diagnostic work-up including (but not limited to):
•Neurologic examinations, as warranted
•Brain radiologic features by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
•PCR analysis: John Cunningham virus (JCV) DNA detectable in cerebrospinal fluid
If PML is confirmed, permanently discontinue tr eatment with brentuximab vedotin a nd nivolumab.
4.5.8 Guidelines for Assessment and Initial Management of Tumor Lysis 
Syndrome
The possibility of tumor lysis syndrome cannot be ruled out for the subjects with lymphoma. 
Therefore, adequate management such as hydration and/or the use of allopurinol is recommended in the subjects who have risk factor of potential tumor lysis syndrome, for example the subjects with high tumor burden, reflected by high serum LDH levels, or b ulky disease, or those with 
preexisting renal failure.
4.5.9 Treatment Beyond Disease Progression
4.5.9.1 Circumstances in which post-progression treatment is permitted
Subjects meeting progression defined by relapsed disease (after CR) or progressi ve disease 
(after PR, SD) per 2014 Lugano Classification  & the Lymphoma Res ponse to Immunomodulat ory 
therapy Criteria (LY RIC)  
85for DLBCL/PTCL/PMBL/MGZL ( Appendix 2) or modified Severity 
Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT) a nd Global Response Score in CTCL criteria ( Appendix 4)
may continue receiving study medicat ion beyond inve stigator-ass essed progression as long as they 
meet the following criteria:
•Investigator-assessed clinical benefit
•Stable performance status 
•Treatment be yond progression will not delay an imminent interve ntion to prevent serious 
complications of disease progression 
•Subjects will be re-consented for treatment beyond progressive disease
•Tolerance of study drug. 
The decision to continue treatment beyond investigator-assessed progression should be discussed 
with the BMS Medical Monitor and documented in the study records. The assessment of clinical benefit should take into account whether the subject is clinica lly deteriorating and unlikely to 
receive further benefit from continued treatment.

4.5.9.2 Assessment Schedule for the Subjects with Post-progression 
Treatment
The subject should continue to receive monitoring according to  the Lymphoma Response to
Immunomodulatory therapy Criteria (LYRIC) a minimum of 12 weeks On -Treatment Assessments 
on Table 5.1-2 . Radiographic assessment described in section 5.4.1 should be performed when 
subjects continue post progression treatment as outlined in appendix 2 .
4.5.9.3 Discontinuation due to “Further Progression”
Subjects should discontinue study therapy upon evidence of furt her progression, defined as an 
additional 10% or greater increase in tumor burden volume from time of initi al progression 
(including all target lesions and new measurable lesions, increase in tumor burden without a 5mm 
absolute increase does not require discontinuation) from previou s PET-CT, CT and/or MRI.
•The tumor burden volume from time of initial progression should  be used as the reference 
baseline for comparison with the post-progression assessment.
•New lesions are considered measurable at the time of initial pr ogression if the long axis is more 
than 15 mm regardless of the short axis. Increase in tumor burden without a 5mm absolute 
increase does not require discontinuation.
•Any new lesion considered non-measurable at the time of or afte r initial progression may 
become measurable and therefore included in the tumor burden determination.
4.5.9.4 Efficacy Assessment for Subjects who Discontinue Study Drug during 
Post-Progression Treatment
When subjects stop post-progression treatment, no additional radiographic assessment w ill be 
required and they will continue in the follow-up phase of the s tudy ( Table 5.1-3 ). The subjects 
who proceed to allogeneic SCT or ASCT will be followed with spe cific tumor assessment on 
day 100, at 6 months, 1 year and every year thereafter from the date of stem cell infusion until the 
first non-CR after S CT is documented.
4.6 Blinding/Unblinding
Not applicable.
4.7 Treatment Compliance
Treatment compliance will be monitored by drug accountability as well as the subject’s medical

baseline examinations should inclu de weight, height, ECOG Perfo rmance Status, blood pressure 
(BP), heart rate (HR), temperature, and oxygen saturation by pu lse oximetry at rest (also monitor 
amount of supplemental oxygen if applicable) and should be perf ormed within 28 days prior to 
first dose. 
Physical examination will be performed as clinically indicated a nd clinical signs and symptoms 
are to be collected within 14 days of first dose. For subjects w ith CTCL, a skin examination 
following the mSWAT should be included. During the on-treatment  visits, a target physical 
examination is acceptable and it should include the assessment of the lymph node areas, abdominal 
organs (eg, spleen), neurological assessment and skin lesions if a pplicable. If there are any new or 
worsening clinically significant changes since the last exam, r eport changes on the appropriate 
non-serious or serious adverse event page.

Pregnancy testing (urine or serum) must be done in WOCBP only an d within 24 hours of first dose 
and at least every 4 weeks (+/- 3days) thereafter regardless of do sing schedule. 
Baseline local laboratory assess ments must b e done within 14 days  prior to first dose to include 
CBC w/differential, LFTs (ALT, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline p hosphatase), BUN or serum urea 
level, creatinine, uric acid, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, LDH, glucose, albumin, amylase, lipase and
urinalysis (total protein, glucose blood, leukocyte esterase, spe cific gravity and pH).
Baseline local laboratory asse ssments for Hep B and C testing ( HBV sAg, HCV Ab or HCV RNA)
must be done within 28 d ays prior to first dose. 
On treatment oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry should be obta ined within 72 hours prior to 
dosing and at any time a subject has any new or worsening respir atory symptoms. A reading at 
rest should be obtained at each time point. If a subject shows changes on pulse oximetry or other 
pulmonary-related signs (eg, hypoxia, fever) or symptoms (eg, d yspnea, cough) consistent with 
possible pulmonary adverse events, the subject should be immedi ately evaluated to rule out 
pulmonary toxicity. An algorithm for the management of suspecte d pulmonary toxicity can be 
found in Appendix 6 and the nivolumab IB.
Thyroid function testing is to be done at every other cycle (ap proximately every 6 weeks , unless 
treatment delays are observed) for subjects receiving study drug . At baseline TSH, Free T3 and 
Free T4 will be performed within 14 days of first dose. During treatment TSH will be done (with 
reflexive Free T4 and Free T3 if TSH results are abnormal) with in 72 hours prior to dosing. 
On treatment local laboratory assessments should be done within  72 hours prior to dosing; and 
will include CBC with differential, BUN or serum urea level, serum creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, amylase, lipase, glucose, AST, AL T, total bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphatase and LDH.
Local laboratory assessments are to be performed for the Follow -up X01 visit and include CBC 
with differential, uric acid, serum urea level, uric acid, albu min, creatinine, sodium, potassium, 
calcium, magnesium, chloride, glucose, AST, ALT, total bilirubi n, alkaline phosphatase, LDH, 
TSH (reflex to free T3, free T4 for abnormal TSH result). This panel should be repeated at Follow-
up visit X02 if Follow-up vis it X01 results were abnormal.
For subjects who discontinue study therapy by proceeding to all ogeneic SCT, documen tation of 
acute and chronic GVHD will be captured on Day 100, at 6 months, 1 year and every year 
thereafter from the date of stem cell infusion until the first non-CR after SCT is documented.
Subjects will be evalu ated for safety if they have received any study drug. Toxicity assessments 
will be continuous during the tr eatment phase. During the Follow-Up Phase at Visits X01 and X02 , 
toxicity assessments should be done in person. Follow-up visit 1  (X01) is to occur 35 days from 
the last dose +/- 7 days. Follow-up visit 2 (X02) is to occur 80  days (+/- 7 days) from follow-up

Adverse events and laboratory values will be graded according t o the NCI-CTCAE version 4.03.
Additional measures, including non-study required laboratory tests, should be performed as 
clinically indicated or to comply with local regulations. Labor atory toxicities (eg, suspected drug 
induced liver enzyme evaluatio ns) will be monitored during the follow-up phase via on site/local 
labs until all study drug related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible.
Some of the assessments referred to in this section may not be captured as data in the eCRF. They 
are intended to be used as safety monitoring by the treating ph ysician. Additional testing or 
assessments may be performed as clinically necessary  or where required by institutional or local 
regulations.
5.3.1 Imaging Assessment for the Study
Any incidental findings of potential clinical relevance that ar e not directly associated with the 
objectives of the protocol should be evaluated and handled by t he Study Investigator as per 
standard medical/clinical judgment.
At the sponsor’s discretion, scans may be collected centrally t o be reviewed by independent 
radiologists.
5.4 Efficacy Assessments
DLBCL, PTCL, PMBL and MGZL Efficacy Assessment :
The primary eff icacy assessment is Objective Response (OR). Ob jective Res ponse is defined as a 
subject achieving either a PR or CR according to the Lugano Classification 2014 and Lym phoma
Response to Immunomodulatory therapy Criteria (LYRIC) ( Appendix 2 ) and will be based on
investigator assessed response. Efficacy assessment for DLBCL, PTCL, PMBL and MGZL will 
be primarily derived from the FDG PET-CT performed according to  the timepoints described in 
Table 5.1-1 Table 5.1-2 and Table 5.1-3 . Subjects with PET-Avid lesions at baseline should be 
followed with PET, subjects with non-Pet avid lesions and lesio ns on CT scans at baseline should 
be followed with CT Scans. Tumor assessment (CR or non-CR) will  be assessed by the investigator 
according to the Lugano Classification 2014.  
CTCL Efficacy Assessment :
Efficacy assessment for Cutane ous T Cell lymphom as will include  CT/MRI for visceral disease 
assessment and peripheral lymph nodes at the pre-determined timepoints described in Table 5.1-1
Table 5.1-2 and Table 5.1-3 . The consensus Global Response Score assessment to evaluate disease 
activity will also be completed a t every tum or assessm ent time point to assess extent of disease. 
Medical photographies are recommended to document the appearanc e of skin lesions throughout 
the study. The mSWAT will be used to assess skin involvement, it is preferable that the mSWAT 
assessments should be performed by the same investigator at all  time points to eliminate inter-

observer variability for a given patient. Lymphoma Response to Immu nomodulatory therapy
Criteria (LY RIC) will be used where clinically indicated ( Appendix 2).
Whole blood must be included for assessment of SS-CTCL at basel ine to evaluate blood tumor 
burden. In the case the blood is confirmed to be positive for t umor cells, it must be reassessed at 
the time of response documentation, prior to its confirmation. 
All subjects treated are expected to be followed for disease progression. Subjects that discontinue 
treatment for other reasons different from disease progression must continue to perform tumor 
assessments as described in Table 5.1-3 until disease progression is documented. 
The primary analysis of the study will be performed 8 months af ter the last subject has received 
the first dose of study med ication, or ear lier if that subject discontinues study therapy. After the 
cut off for the primary analysis, subjects who are receiving stud y treatment can continue treatment 
per protocol until progression, unacceptable toxi city, withdrawal of consent, or other reasons as 
listed in Section 3.5 .
Once subjects discontinue study therapy by proceeding to alloge neic SCT or ASCT, they will not 
undergo radiographic assessments at the predetermined timepoints described in Table 5.1-3 .
Instead, they will be evaluated on Day 100, at 6 months, 1 year and every year thereafter from 
the date of stem cell infusion until the first non-CR after SCT is documented.
Sites are required to have available on site all of the on-study tumor scans.
5.4.1 Radiographic Assessments
Baseline assessments should be performed within 28 days prior t o the first dose, utilizing FDG 
PET-CT, CT or MRI. CT scans are preferred for CTCL. In addition to c hest, abdomen, pelvis, all 
known sites of disease should be assessed at baseline. FDG PET-C T will be performed for 
assessment throughout the study for subjects with DLBCL, PTCL, PMBL and MGZL. Low dose 
or attenuation correction CT portions of a combined FDG PET-CT are of limited use in 
anatomically based efficacy assessments and it is therefore sugg ested that they should not be 
substituted for dedicated diagnostic contrast enhanced CT scans  for anatomically based 
measurements. However, if a site can document that the CT performed as part of a FDG PET-CT is of identical dia gnostic quality to a diagnostic CT with oral contrast, (+/- IV c ontrast) then the 
adequate dose CT of the FDG PET-CT can be used for tumor measur ements. Subjects with CTCL 
are to perform the CT scans described above in addition to medi cal photographies if appropriate 
for disease assessment.
Subjects will be evaluated for t umor response by FDG PET-CT, or CT/MRI at week 6 and week 12 
continuing every 9 weeks (+/- 1 week) for the subsequent 4 tumor assessment timepoints, 
regardless of dosing schedule. After the first year, tumor assessments are to occur every 12 weeks 
(+/- 2 weeks) until disease progression is documented.
Tumor assessments for ongoing study treatment d ecisions will be completed by the investigator 
using the Lugano Classification 2014 for Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphomas and Peripheral T Cell 
Lymphomas. Refer to Appendix 2 for further details. For Cutaneous T Cell Lymphomas, response

should be assessed by the consensus Global Response Score. Refer  to Appendix 4  for further 
details.
5.4.2 Assessment of Overall Tumor Burden and Measurable Disease
To serially evaluate tumor response to therapy, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor burden 
at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. Measurable disease is defined by the presence of at least one measurable tumor lesion . 
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as m easurable or non-measurable as 
follows in Section 5.4.2.1 and Section 5.4.2.2 .
5.4.2.1 Measurable Lesions
Measurable lesions must be accurately measured in at least two p erpendicular dimensions. For 
subjects staged with PET-CT (DLBCL, PTCL, PMBL and MGZL), focal uptake in nodal and 
extranodal sites that is in keeping with lymphoma, according to the distribution and/or CT 
characteristics, is considered involvement with lymphoma, inclu ding spleen, liver, bone, thyroid, 
and so on. For subjects staged with CT, up to six of the largest target nodes, nodal masses, or other lymphomatous lesions that are measurable in two diameters (long est diameter [LDi] and shortest 
diameter) s hould be identified from differe nt body regions representative of the patient’s overall 
disease burden and include mediastinal and retroperitoneal disease, if involved. A measurable node 
must have a LDi greater than 15 mm. Measurable extranodal disease (eg, hepatic nodules) may be 
included in the six representative, measured lesions. For extranodal measurable lesion the LDi must be greater than 10 mm. All other lesions (including nodal,  extranodal, and assessable disease) 
should be followed as non measurable disease (eg, cutaneous, GI, bone, spleen, liver, kidneys, 
pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites). In subjects in whom a discordant histology or malignant 
transformation is suspected, a PET-CT may identify the optimal site to biopsy for confirmation.
For subjects with CTCL measurable, skin lesions are defined as pap ules, plaques and patches 
covering t10% of the skin surface (T2). Lymph nodes are qualified as abnor mal if > 15 mm in 
diameter.
5.4.2.2 Non-Measurable Lesions
Non-measurable lesions will be all other lesions, including sma ll lymph nodes (longest diameter 
d15 mm) as well as truly non-measurable lesions. Lesions considere d truly non-measurable 
include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardia l effusion, inflammatory breast 
disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal ma sses/abdominal organomegaly 
identified by physical exam and that is not measurable by repro ducible imaging techniques.

5.4.3 Specifications by Method of Assessment
5.4.3.1 Measurement of Lesions
All measurements should be recorded in the eCRF in metric notat ion (mm). All baseline 
evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 
28 days before the beginning of treatment.
5.4.3.2 Method of Assessment
The same method of assessment and the same techni que should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up . Imaging based evaluation should 
always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesi on(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.
5.4.3.3 FDG PET-CT, CT Scan and MRI
Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) scans acquired on ded icated CT equipment are
preferred for response assessment of subjects with CTCL or DLBCL/ PTCL/PMBL/MGZL
subjects without FDG avid tumors in this study. CT with contrast  of the chest, abdomen and pelvis 
(as clinically indicated) are to be performed for tumor assessm ents at week 6 and week 12 
continuing every 9 weeks (+/- 1 week) for the subsequent 4 tumor assessment timepoints, 
regardless of dosing schedule. After the first year, tumor asse ssments are to occur every 12 weeks 
(+/- 2 weeks) until disease progression is documented. CT scans should be acquired with 5mm 
slices with no intervening gap (contiguous). When CT scans have  slice thickness greater than 
5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice t he slice thickness.
Should a subject have a contraindication for CT IV contrast, a non-contrast CT of the chest and a 
contrast enhanced MRI of the abdomen and pelvis may be obtained . MRIs should be acquired with 
slice thickness of 5 mm with no gap (contiguous). 
Every attempt should be made to  image each subject using an identical acquisition protocol on the 
same scanner for all imaging time points.
FDG PET-CT with oral contrast and intravenous contrast w ill be performed for assessment 
throughout the study  for patients with DLBCL , PTCL, PMBL and MG ZL. If however CT is low 
dose and intravenous contrast is not available, then sites may o btain additional CT with  oral and 
intravenous contrast. Note on CT component of a PET-CT s canner: Combined modality scan ning such as with PET-CT 
is increasingly used in clinical care. Low dose or attenuation correction CT portions of a combined 
PET-CT are of limited use in anatomically based efficacy assessments and it is therefore suggested 
that they should not be used. Site should document that the CT performed as part of a PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast). In certain cases where the CT portion of the PET-CT scan is low dose, then a diagnosti c CT scan with oral and 
intravenous contrast should be performed.

MRI of the brain should be done at baseline if CNS involvement is suspected to rule out active 
disease. Scans during on-study treatment and follow up periods a re required only as clinically 
indicated for new signs and symptoms that suggest central nervous system (CNS) involvement.
5.4.3.4 Clinical Lesions
Clinical lesions (nodal, extranodal) will only be considered me asurable when they are superficial 
and t15 mm diameter as assessed using calipers. As previously noted, when lesions can be 
evaluated both by clinical exam and imaging, imaging evaluation  should be undertaken since it is 
more objective.
In regards to CTCL, skin evaluation will be performed using the  m SWAT scoring system. It is 
recommended that the mSWAT at the bedside should be performed by the same investigator at all 
time points. If the same investigator cannot perform all the assessments, then all personnel grading the same patient must have completed prior training, ideally be fore study initiation.
5.4.3.5 Medical Photography (Skin lesions only)
Medical photography wit h ruler measurements for documen tation of skin lesions are 
recommended in subjects with CTCL.
5.4.3.6 Whole Blood (SS-CTCL only)
Peripheral blood flow cytometry to evaluate for SS cell at scre ening and at response confirmation 
is required in subjects with CTCL(SS).
5.4.3.7 Target Lesions
At baseline, up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masse s meeting the criteria for 
measurable lesions given in  Section 5.4.2 should be identified as target lesions and their 
measurements recorded. Other measurable lesions will be designa ted as non-target lesions.
A sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) will be calculated for all target lesions and recorded 
as the baseline SPD. The baseline SPD will be used as reference  to further characterize any 
objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.
5.4.3.8 Non-Target Lesions
All other lesions (or sites of  disease) including non-measurabl e lymph nodes should be identified 
as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’. 
In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same organ as a single 
item on the case report form (eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lym ph nodes’ or multiple liver 
nodules’).
5.4.4 Bone Marrow Assessments
Bone marrow assessments are not mandatory in the study, unless clinical suspicion is high. In
subjects with PTCL, if there is clinical suspicio n for bone marrow involvement, it is recommended

to obtain a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy at the time of scre ening. All subjects may volunteer 
to undergo bone marrow biopsy and aspirate at any time during therapy if clinically indicated for 
DLBCL, CTCL, PMBL and MGZL. 
Only if clinically indicated, bone marrow biopsy and aspir ate pe rformed within 90 days prior to 
obtaining consent or fresh sample collected during screening are acceptable options. If a bone 
marrow biopsy/aspirate is performed during the screening period , consider submitting a bone 
marrow aspirate sample for biomarker analyses. For subjects tha t perform bone marrow 
assessment at screening and there is marrow involvement confirm ed, a bone marrow biopsy and 
aspirate w ill be required to confirm a CR, and submission of bon e marrow aspirate samples is 
optional as detailed in Table 5.6-1 .
In addition to efficacy assessments, additional, optional, bone marrow biopsy and aspirate samples 
may be collected and submitted for biomarker studies as detaile d in Table 5.6-1 .
5.4.5 Disease Response Evaluation
The determination of disease response to study treatment will b e made using Lugano Classification 
2014 in subjects with DLBCL, PTCL, PMBL and MGZL ( Appendix 2). Responses in CTCL will 
be evaluated using consensus Global Response Score by the investigators ( Appendix 4 ).
For CTCL Response Evaluation, the consensus Global Response Score will be used incorporating 
skin, lymph nodes, viscera and blood. The mSWAT score will be u sed to evaluate and score skin 
lesions, and to assist in skin response evaluation. 
5.5 Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity Assessments
Samples for PK and immunogenicit y assessments will be collected  for all sub jects receiving 
nivolumab and brentuximab vedotin as described in Table 5.5.1-1 . All time points are relative to 
the start of study drug administration. After cycle 1 (once bot h study drugs of the combination are 
administered on the same day), predose samples are to be collec ted relative to the start of 
brentuximab vedotin. All on-treatment time points are intended to align with days on which study 
drug is administered, if dosing occurs on a different day, the P K and immunogenicity sampling 
should be adjusted accordingly. Further details of sample colle ction, processing, and shipment will 
be provided in the laboratory procedures manual.
5.5.1 Pharmacokinetics:  Collection and Processing
A detailed schedule of PK and immunogenicity evaluations for nivolumab and brentuximab
vedotin is provided in Table 5.5.1-1 . PK samples will be analyzed for nivolumab and brentuximab
vedotin by validated ligand binding assays. Immunogenicity sampl es will be analyzed for anti-
nivolumab antibodies by a validated immunogenicity assay; sampl es may also be analyzed for 
neutralizing antibodies by a validated method. Serum samples may be analyzed by an exploratory method that measures anti-drug antibodies for technology explor ation purposes; explorat ory 
results will not be reported. Serum samples designated for PK or biomarker assessments may also 
be used for immunogenicity analysis if required (eg, insufficie nt volume for complete 
immunogenicity assessment or to follow up on suspected immunogenicity related AE).

aAll biomarker samples may be obtained within 3 days prior to th e indicated time.
bFresh tumor biopsy collections may be performed at screening or cycle 1 for flow-cytometry analysis of TILs. Such 
fresh biopsies for TILs analysis are optional but strongly enco uraged. If screening or cycle 1 day 1 fresh tumor 
collection for TILs flow-cytometry analysis is perform, on-stud y collections are also optional but encouraged.
cSubjects may undergo tumor biopsy during screening or submit ar chival tumor tissue collected prior to obtaining 
informed consent. Tumor tissue must have been collected within 20 months from screening, while slides must have 
been cut within 6 months from screening. Refer to section 5.6.1 for further details. In order to be treated, the sample 
must meet the minimum quality requirements, as determined by the central laboratory during the screening period.
dIn subjects with PTCL where clinical suspicion for marrow involvement is high, bone marrow biopsy and aspirate 
collected within 90 days prior to obtaining consent or fresh sample during screening are acceptable. Submission of 
bone marrow aspirate is encouraged if available. Submission of bone marrow biopsy specimens is not required at 
any point in this study.
eIf the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma prior to or at base line, a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate will be 
required to confirm a CR. Submission of bone marrow aspirate is encouraged.
fAll subjects may volunteer to undergo tumor and/or bone marrow biopsies at any time during therapy if clinically 
indicated. When tumor biopsy is performed, submission of tumor biopsy is encouraged.
gSamples from subjects that have confirmed progression are optio nal.
5.6.1 Biomarker Sampling
Tumor Biopsy:
Tumor biopsy s pecimens will be obtained to characterize immune cell populations and expression 
of selected tumor markers. 
Biopsy samples should be excisional, incisional or core needle.  Fine needle biopsies are not 
allowed because the architecture of the tumor in its microenvir onment cannot be assessed.
Tumor tissue (obtained during the screening phase or collected as a standard of care procedure 
prior to obtaining informed consent) must be provided for bioma rker analysis. Subjects with 
relapsed disease must provide a recent biopsy sample within 20 months from screening, while 
slides have been cut within 6 months from screening.

determined by the central laboratory during the screening perio d. Minimum of 1 FFPE tumor tissue 
block (preferred) OR a minimum of 20 FFPE unstained sections are required for assessment of 
PD-L1 status and other biomarker evaluations.
All subjects may volunteer to undergo tumor biopsy at any time during therapy if clinically 
indicated (eg, upon progression). When tumor biopsy is performed, submission of tumor biopsy is 
optional, but encouraged for the purposes of understanding mechanisms of resistance to therapy.
Fresh tumor biopsy collections may be performed at screening or cycle 1 day 1 for flow-cytometry 
analysis of TILs. Such fresh tumor biopsies for TILs analysis are optional but strongly encouraged. If screening or cycle 1 day 1 fresh tumor collection for TILs f low-cytometry is performed, on-
study collections are also optional but encouraged.  
Plasma and Serum
Soluble Biomarkers
Soluble factors, such as cytokines, chemokines, soluble recepto rs, and antibodies to tumor antigens 
will be characterized and quantified by immunoassays in serum. 
Plasma samples will be collected and assessed for additional cy tokines and soluble factors, 
including soluble PD-L1 if possible.PBMC
Immunophenotyping
The proportion of specific lymphocyte subsets and expression le vels of T cell co-s timulatory 
markers in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBM C) preparation will be quantified by flow 
cytometry. Analyses may include, but not necessarily be limited  to, the proportion of T, B, and 
NK cells, proportion of memory and effector T cell subsets, and expression levels of PD 1, PD L1, 
PD-L2, ICOS, and Ki67
Whole Blood
Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Analysis
In order to identify potential polymorphisms associated with sa fety and efficacy of nivolumab, 
selected genes will be evaluated for single nucleotide polymorp hisms (SNP). Analysis will be 
limited to sequence polymorphisms linked to genes associated wi th the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway and 
activated T cell phenotype, including PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, and C TLA-4. A blood sample will be 
obtained at Day 1, unless restricted by local requirements
Bone Marrow Biopsy and Aspirate
If clinical suspici on of bone ma rrow involvement, disease manifestation in the bone marrow will  
be evaluated in subjects with PTCL ( Section 5.4.4 ) within 90 days prior to start of study therapy. 
If disease is observed in the bone marrow prior to or during screening, bone marrow aspirate will 
be required if CR is considered during the treatment phase of the study. Bone marrow aspirates 
will be obtained using institutional standards for these proced ures. Samples will be assessed for

as described in Table 5.6-1 ).
Samples from bone ma rrow aspirates that ma y be pe rformed at screening and during CR evaluation 
(only for subjects who had marrow involvement at study entry) are encouraged to be submitted for biomarker assessment. These will be utilized to assess the phen otypic and functional status of 
immune cells and tumor cells.
All subjects may volunteer to undergo bone marrow biopsy and aspirate at any time during therapy 
if clinically indicated. When bone marrow biopsy is done, submission of bone marrow aspirate is 
encouraged.
5.6.2 Detailed Biomarkers
The biomarkers described below will be analyzed by third party vendors to the extent possible 
considering that tumor tissue provided by some of the subjects may be insufficient to complete the 
full panel of biomarkers proposed in this protocol. 
•PD-L1 : Proprietary IHC analysis (Screening only)
•Immunecell subsets: Lymphocyte subsets and expression levels of T cell co-stimulato ry 
markers (by flow cytometry). Analyses may include, but not be limited to, the proportion of 
T-, B-, and NK-cells, proportion of memory- and effector T-cell subsets, and expression levels 
of PD 1, PD L1, PD L2, ICOS, CD 30, CD153 and Ki67. Analysis of  the diversity of the T-cell 
repertoire in correlation to clinical activity.
•Tumor gene and phenotype : Analysis (by IHC, RNASeq, GEP, qRT-PCR, miRNA, 
methylation, or mutational analyses) of disease heterogeneity a nd subtypes and implication of 
the data as response predictors to study therapy. (Screening on ly)
•Cell of origin : Cell of origin evaluation will be done by for subjects with diagnosis of relapsed 
DLBCL. Additionally, BCL2 and MYC will be assessed for double hi t lymphoma. (Screening 
only)
•Molecular mechanisms of action and resistance to the study drug s:Expression profiling 
of immune-related genes, mutational analysis, and immune relate d signaling pathway gene 
expression profiling. Analysis includes, genes associated with immune-related pathways, such 
as T cell activation and antigen processing and presentation (Screening o nly and other 
timepoints if tumor material is made available)
•PD-1 expression and nivolumab binding effects of combination therapy on survival 
pathways (NF-kB,) as well as survival signals from the microenv ironment. Tumor samples 
obtained from bone metastases are not considered acceptable for PD-L1 testing because the 
PD-L1 assay does not include a decalcification step. For any cases where the only tumor tissue 
available is from a bone metastasis lesion, please discuss furt h e r  w i t h  t h e  s t u d y  M e d i c a l  
Monitor
•Biomarkers of clinical response : Multiplex- and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) of tumor antigen-specific responses associated with cli nical response by including 
cytokines, chemokines, soluble receptors, and antibodies to tum or antigens quantified. 
Analyses include but are not limited t o, soluble CD 25, soluble PD-1, soluble LAG 3, CXCL 
9, and soluble PD-L1. (Screening and during treatment as described in Table 5.6-1 )

•Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with safety and efficacy of study therapy. 
SNP analysis will be limited to genes associated with the PD1/P D-L1 pathway and genes 
associated with CD30 and TNF receptors and apoptosis. 
•Characterization of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tumor antigens. 
Immunohistoch emistry (IHC) w ill be used to assess the number and composition of immune 
infiltrates in order to define th e immune cell subsets present within formalin-fixed, paraffin 
embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue before and after exposure to therapy. These IHC analyses will 
include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following marke rs: CD4, CD8, FOXp3, PD-1, 
PD-L1, and PD-L2.
•Flow cytometry of TIL from bone marrow aspirates, tumor biopsies and lymph nodes will be 
assessed for the proportion of T, B, and NK cells, proportion o f memory and effector T cell 
subsets, and expression levels of PD 1, PD L1, PD-L2, ICOS, and  Ki67. Where available, 
immune cells from tumor and lymph node biopsies will be isolate d and cryopreserved. For 
functional assessment, including proliferation and intracellular cytokines such as IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha.
•Characterization of tumor genotype and phenotype: Gene mutations, chromosomal 
translocations, aberrant expressions, and epigenetic modificati ons within tumor cells will be 
characterized and explored by IHC and RNA/DNA analysis of tumor  biopsies. Associations 
of altered tumor cell genetic structure with nivolumab efficacy  will be performed.
•Characterization of T cell repertoire : As described above, DNA sequencing will be 
performed on pre- and post treatment tumor tissue to assess the composition of the T cell 
repertoire. DNA will be isolated from either the FFPE tumor blo ck or from RNAlater, or 
equivalent preparations. 
Complete instructions on the collection, processing, handling, and shipment of all samples 
described herein will be provided in a separate procedure manual at the time of study initiation.
5.7 Outcomes Research Assessments
General health-related quality of life will be collected with t he EQ-5D 3L during Expansion Phase 
(Cohort B) as outlined in the assessment schedule in Table 5.1-2 and Table 5.1-3
Outcomes research data including health related quality of life (QoL) and patient reported 
symptom burden provide a more complete understanding of the imp act of treatment by 
incorporating the subjects’ perspective. These data will be used to assess the impact of nivolumab combined with brentuximab vedotin as reported by subjects with DLBCL (cohort B1), PTCL
(cohort B2) and CTCL (cohort B3).
The EQ-5D 3L is a standardized i nstrument for s elf-reported healt h status comprised of 
5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discom fort, and anxiety, plus a visual 
analog rating scale (VAS). 
Subjects will be asked to complete the EQ-5D 3L before study drug administration and any clinical 
activities are performed during visits to the study clinics at on-study visits. . During follow-up and

survival-follow-up assessments, the EQ-5D 3L may be administered  via telephone contact.
Validated questionnaires will be provided in the subject’s preferred language.
5.8 Other Assessments 
5.8.1 Immunogenicity Assessments
Serum samples collected at time points identified in Table 5.5.1-1 will be analyzed by a v alidated 
immunogenicity assays. Additional characterization (ie, neutral izing antibodies) for any detected 
anti-drug antibodies (ADA) response to nivolumab and/or brentux imab vedotin may also be 
performed using a validated functional cell-based assay. All on-treatment PK timepoints are 
intended to align with days on which nivolumab and brentuximab vedotin are administered. If it 
is known that dose(s) is/are going to be delayed, then the pred ose sample should be collected just 
prior to the delayed dose(s). However, if a predose sample(s) i s/are collected, but the dose is 
subsequently delayed, additional predose sample(s) should not b e collected. Selected serum 
samples may be analyzed by an exploratory method that measures antinivolumab antibodies for 
technology exploration purposes; exploratory results will not be reported.
In addition, serum samples designated for PK or biomarker asses sments may also be used for 
immunogenicity analysis if required (eg, if there is insufficie nt volume for complete 
immunogenicity assessment or to follow up on suspected immunogenicity related AE). 
6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subjec t administered study drug and that 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treat ment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory f inding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or no t considered related to the study 
drug.
The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physic ian and should be used to assess all
adverse events (AE). The causal relationship can be one of the f ollowing:
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between stud y drug administration and 
the AE.Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship betw een study drug 
administration and the AE.
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship. 
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during  open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs .)

6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
•results in death
•is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)
•requires inpatient  hospitalization or cause s prolongation of ex isting hospitalization (see NOTE
below)
•results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
•is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based up on appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) Examples
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treat ment in an emergency room  or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; bl ood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization.) Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See  Section 6.6 for the definition of potential DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic o r nonpathogenic) via the study d rug 
is an SAE.
Although pregnancy, overdose, cancer, and potential drug induce d liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by regulatory definition, these events must be handled as SAEs. (See Sectio n 6.1.1
for reporting pregnancies).
Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to  study therapy (eg, d eath is an 
endpoint, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis mus t be reported) should be reported 
as SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
NOTE : 
The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs in BMS c linical studies: 
a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24  hours, that does not result 
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threatening event)
elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical proce dure
routine h ealth assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of h ealth status 
(eg, routine colonoscopy)
medical/surgical admission other than t o remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases

(applies to oncology protocols)
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Sections 5.6.1 a nd 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) repre sent the Reference Safety 
Information to determine expectedness of serious adverse events  for expedited reporting. 
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not 
related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol-specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur duri ng the screening period and within 
100 days of the last dose of study drug . If applicable, SAEs must be collected that relate to any 
later protocol-specified procedure (eg, a follow-up skin biopsy). 
The investigator must report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure. 
An SAE report must be completed for any event where doubt exists  regarding its seriousness. 
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to the 
conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complication of a study 
procedure), the relationship must be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Re port Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnan cies must be reported to BMS 
(or designee) within 24 hours of awareness of the event. SAEs mus t be recorded on the SAE Report 
Form; pregnancies on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form (electronic or paper forms). The preferred 
method for SAE data reporting co llection is t hrough the eCRF. The paper SAE/pregnancy 
surveillance forms are only intended as a back-up option when the eCRF system is not functioning.In this case, the paper forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact Information list.
SAE Facsimile Number: Refer to Contact Information list.
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC) , electronic submission is the 
required method for reporting. In the event the electronic syste m is unavailable for transmission, 
paper forms must be used and submitted immediately. When paper f orms are used, the original 
paper forms are to remain on site.SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy reporting): Refer to Contact
Information list.If only limited information is initially available, follow-up r eports are required. (Note: Follow-up 
SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initially  reported.)

If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to s tudy drug or if new information 
becomes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted  within 24 hours to BMS 
(or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.
6.2 Nonserious Adverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collection o f nonserious AE i nformation should begin at initiation of study drug until 100 da ys 
from the last dose of study drug .Nonserious AE information sho uld also be collected from the 
start of a placebo lead-in period or other observational period  intended to establish a baseline status 
for the subjects.
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stab ilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study drug and for those pres ent at the end of study treatment as 
appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious AE 
page of the CRF (paper or electronic).Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or  laboratory abnormalities that 
are reported/identified during the course of the study.
6.3 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities
The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be ca ptured on the nonserious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
•Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or me ets the definition of an SAE 
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject to have study drug discontinued 
or interrupted
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject to receive specific corrective 
therapy.
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by the 
reporting investigator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value) .
6.4 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the study drug, it is subsequently discovered that a study subject is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study exposure , including during at least 5 half 
lives after product administration, the investigator must immed iately notify the BMS Medical 
Monitor/designee of this event and complete and forward a Pregn ancy Surveillance Form to BMS 
Designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event and in accor dance with SAE reporting 
procedures described in Section 6.1.1 .

Clinical Protocol CA209436
BMS-936558 nivolumab
In most cases, the study drug will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose 
tapering if necessary for subject safety).
In the rare event that the benefit of continuing study drug is thought to outweigh the risk, after 
consultation with BMS, the pregnant subject may continue study drug after a thorough discussion 
of benefits and risk with the subject
The investigator must immediately notify the BMS (or designee) Medical Monit or of this event 
and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form to BMS (or designee) within 24 hours 
of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE reporting procedures described in 
Section 6.1.1 . 
Follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, in cluding perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be re ported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study p articipant should be reported to 
BMS. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.
6.5 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional adminis tration of any dose of a product that 
is considered both excessive and medically important. All occur rences of overdose must be 
reported as an SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details.).
6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver-related  laboratory abnormalities s hould 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as: 
1. AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (UL N)
AND
2. Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without initial findings of ch olestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),
AND
3. No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation  and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limi ted to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing ch ronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
6.7 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, electrocardiogram, 
x-ray filming, any other potential safety assessment required or  not required by protocol should 
also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.

8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
•In the Dose Evaluation Phase (Cohort A), 6 -12 subjects will be treated ( Section 4.5.1 ). The 
number of subjects is not based on statistical power considerat ions. If less than 1/3 of 6 sub jects 
experience a DLT, the upper limit of the 80% 1-sided exact conf idence interval for the true 
DLT rate w ill not be gr eater than 42%. If less than 1/3 of 12 su bjects experience a DLT, the 
upper limit of the 1-sided 80% exact confidence interval (CI) for the true DLT rate will not be 
greater than 41.2%. 
•In the Expansion Phase (Cohort B), a total of 130 subjects w ill be tr eated, with 40 subjects in 
cohort B1 (DLBCL ), 30 sub jects in cohort B2 (PTCL), 20 subjects in B3 (CTCL), 30 subjects 
in cohort B4 (PMBL) and 10 subjects in cohort B5 (MGZL). 
Given 40 subjects in DLBCL, the one-sided 90% confidence interv al (ie, two-sided 80% 
confidence interval) for the ORR is 48.6% - 70.6% if we assume an observed ORR rate of 
60%. The lower bound of the 90% CI excludes 40%, which is the null hypothesis ORR rate for PTCL. 
Given 30 subjects in PTCL, the one-sided 90% confidence interval (ie, two-sided 80% confidence interval) for the ORR is 46.7% - 72.3% if we assume an observed ORR rate of 
60%. The lower bound of the 90% CI excludes 40%, which is the null hypothesis ORR rate 
for PTCL. 
Given 20 subjects in CTCL, the one-sided 90% confidence interva l (ie, two-sided 80% 
confidence interval) for ORR is 63.9% - 91.0% if we assume an observed ORR rate of 
80%. The lower bound of the 90% CI excludes 60%, which is the n ull hypothesis ORR rate 
for CTCL.
Given 30 subjects in PMBL, the one-sided 90 % confidence interv al (ie, two-sided 80% 
confidence interval) for the ORR is 37.0% - 63.0% if we assume an observed ORR rate of 50%. The lower bound of the 90% CI excludes 30%, which is the null hypothesis ORR rate 
for PMBL. 
Given 10 subjects in MGZL, the one-sided 90 % confidence interval (ie, two-sided 80% 
confidence interval) for the ORR is 11.6% - 55.2% if we assume a n observed ORR rate of 
50%. The lower bound of the 90% CI excludes 10%, which is the null hypothesis ORR rate 
for MGZL.
Table 8.1-1 summarizes the 90% exact CI for different targeted ORRs and sample sizes. The 
targeted ORR of 60% in DLBCL and PTCL and 80% in CTCL, and null hypothesis ORR rate 
of 40% in DLBCL and PTCL and 60% in CTCL are based on the historical data and the activity 
of brentuximab vedotin and nivolu mab as single ag ents from phase I and phase II studies.

If the observed ORR rate is 60% in Cohort B1 and 
B2Power
N=30 [46.7% - 72.3%] 82%
N=40 [48.6% - 70.6%] 87%
If the observed ORR rate is 80% in Cohort B3
N=20 [63.9% - 91.0%] 62 % 
If the observed ORR rate is 50% in Cohort B4
N=30 [37.0% - 63.0%] 81 %
If the observed ORR rate is 30% in Cohort B5
N=10 [11.6% - 55.2%] 61%
Also, If we have 20 subjects in Cohort B3, assuming true ORR is 80%, there will be approximately 
62% power to reject null hypothesis that the true ORR is <= 60%, considering a one-sided alpha 
of 10%. Given a very low prevalence of CTCL, 20 subjects in coh ort III is considered as feasible 
and adequate for a phase II signal detecting trial. Sample size  of 30 subjects in Cohort B2 and 40 
subjects in Cohort B1 are corresponding to power of 82% and 87%  respectively to reject null 
hypothesis that the true ORR is <= 40% assuming true ORR is 60% and considering a one-sided alpha of 10%. If we have 30 subjects in Cohort B4, assuming true  ORR is 50%, there w ill be 
approximately 81% power to reject null hypothesis that the true  ORR is <= 30%, considering a 
one-sided alpha of 10%. Finally if we have 10 subjects in Cohort B5, assuming true ORR is 30%, 
there will be approximately 61% power to reject null hypothesis  that the true ORR is <= 10%, 
considering a one-sided alpha of 10%.
If the screening failure rate is 20%, we would need to enroll 1 70 subjects to have 136 patients 
treated (130 in Cohort B, 6 in Cohort A). If Cohort A needs 6-12 more treated subjects, we would 
need to enroll 8-15 more subjects accordingly.
8.2 Populations for Analyses
In each cohort the following populations will be defined:
•All Enrolled Subjects: All subjects who signed an informed consent form and were registered
into the IVRS.
•All Treated Subjects: All subjects who received at least one do se of any of the study drugs. 
This is the primary population for safety and efficacy analyses . This dataset will be used for 
baseline demographics and efficacy and safety analyses.
•PK Subjects: Subjects with available serum time-concentration data from treated subjects 
dosed with nivolumab and/or brentuximab vedotin.
•HEOR subjects: treated subjects who have an assessment at scree ning/baseline and at least 
1 follow-up assessment

8.3 Endpoints
8.3.1 Primary Endpoint(s)
The primary safety endpoints include incidence of deaths, adver se events, serious adverse events, 
adverse events leading to discontinuation, adverse events leadi ng to dose delay, drug-related 
adverse events and specific laboratory abnormalities (worst gra de). Toxicities will be graded using 
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 4.03.
The primary efficacy endpoint is ORR. It is defined as the numb er of subjects with a best overall
response (BOR) of confirmed CR or PR divided by the number of treated subjects. The BOR is 
defined as the best response designation recorded between the d ate of first dose and the date of 
initial ob jectively documented progression or the date of subsequent ther apy, whichever occurs 
first. Allogeneic SCT and ASCT will be considered as subsequent  therapy. In subjects with 
relapsed refractory DLBCL, relapsed refractory PTCL, relapsed refra ctory PMBL and relapsed 
refractory MGZL the response (CR, PR, PD, and progression) will be assessed according to 
Lugano Classification 2014. For subjects with relapsed refractor y CTCL, response will be assessed 
according to consensus Global Response Score as per the consensus statement of the International 
Society for Cutaneous Lymphoma. A CR must have been c onfirmed by scans, including a negative 
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to be considered for CR in subjects wit h PTCL, DLBCL, 
PMBL and MZGL. In subjects with PTCL, if the bone marrow was com promised at baseline, a 
bone marrow must also be negative at the time of CR. In CTCL CT scans (chest, neck, abdomen 
and pelvis), blood flow for SS cells and m SWAT skin scoring alo ng with medical photography 
will be performed at baseline and at the end of the treatment fo r response evaluation. The 
investigator will perform tests that will allow evaluation of r esponse to therapy according to 
corresponding disease criteria in Appendix 2  and Appendix 4 . The analysis of the primary endpoint 
will occur approximately 8 months after the last enrolled subjec t’s first dose of study therapy.
Depending on the enrollment for each disease cohort, the analysis may be done at different times
for each cohort, or at the same time for the three cohorts.
8.3.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)
The secondary endpoints are DOR, CR rate, duration of CR, PFS a nd OS.
DOR will be calculated from the da te of initial documentation o f a response (CR, or PR) to the 
date of first documented evidence of p rogressive disease (or relapse for subjects who experience 
CR during the study) or death. Subjects who are progression-free and alive or have unknown status 
will be censored at the last tumor assessment. For subjects who received subsequent therapy prior to documented progression, duration of response will be censore d on the last tumor assessment 
date prior to subsequent therapy. Allogeneic SCT and ASCT will b e considered as subsequent 
therapy.

2.0 Approved 930092648 2.0v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA209436
BMS-936558 nivolumab
The CR rate is defined as the number of subjects with a BOR of CR divided by the number of 
treated subjects. The duration of CR will only be evaluated in subjects with BOR of CR and is 
defined as the time from first documentation of CR to the date of initial documented progression 
or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Censoring wi ll be applied as per DOR definition.
PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study  drug until the d ate of first documented 
evidence of progressive disease (or relapse for sub jects who experience CR during the study) or 
death, whichever comes first. Subjects who are progression-free and alive or have unknown status 
will be censored at the last tumor assessment. For subjects who received subsequent therapy prior 
to documented progression, it will be censored on the last tumo r assessment date prior to 
subsequent therapy.
OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug until the date of death 
(any reason). If the subject is alive or the vital status is unk nown, the subject will be censored at 
the date the subject was last known to be alive.
8.3.3 Exploratory Endpoint(s)
The Indeterminate response will be assessed per the Lymphoma Res ponse to Immunomodulatory 
therapy Criteria (LYRIC). The exploratory biomaker objectives a re to assess CD30 expression and 
correlate with response, and to assess PD-L1/L2 status and corr elate it with response etc. These 
biomarker endpoints are discussed in detail in Section 5.6 . The exploratory objectives also include 
characterizing pharmacokinetics (PK) and the immunogenicity of nivo lumab and brentuximab
vedotin following combination therapy. The nivolumab and brentux imab vedotin c oncentr ation, 
PK parameter and inmmunogenicity endpoints are discussed in details in Section 5.5 .  
8.4 Analyses
8.4.1 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Demographic and baseline characteristics of patient will be sum marized for each cohort and also 
for all treated subjects.
8.4.2 Efficacy Analyses
All analyses will be performed separately for each cohort and a lso for all tr eated sub jects combined 
with same treatm ent dosage (ie, safety cohort subjects with diffe rent dose from the expansion
cohort will not be combined). 
The ORR will be summarized by binomial response rates and their corresponding two-sided 80% 
exact CIs using the Clopper-Pearson method. The same analysis w ill be performed for CR rate.
The DOR will be summarized by cohort for subjects who achieve c onfirmed PR or CR using the 
Kaplan-Meier (KM) product-limit method. Median values of DOR, a long with two-sided 95% CI 
using log-log transformation method and range, will also be calculated. The same analysis will be performed f or duration of CR, PFS and OS at 1 year. Detailed analyses on efficacy endpoints will 
be presented in the statistical analyses plan.

8.4.3 Safety Analyses
Safety analyses will be performed in all treated subjects. Desc riptive statistics of safety will be 
presented using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminol ogy Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. All on-study AEs, drug-related, AEs, SAEs and drug-related SAEs 
will be tabulated using worst grade per NCI CTCAE v4.03 criteria  by system organ class and 
MedDRA preferred term. On-study lab parameters including hemato logy, chemistry, liver 
function, thyroid function, and renal function will be summarized using worst grade per NCI CTCAE v4.03 criteria. 
In addition to separate analyses per cohort, safety analyses wil l be performed all treated subjects 
combined. If safety cohorts subject have different doses, the s afety results will be presented by 
cohorts and by dose.
8.4.4 Pharmacokinetic Analyses
The nivolumab and brentuximab vedotin concentration data obtained  i n  t h i s  s t u d y  m a y  b e  
combined with data from other studies in the clinical development programs to develop or refine 
existing population PK models. These models may be used to evaluat e the effects of intrinsic and 
extrinsic covariates on the PK of nivolumab or brentuximab vedoti n and to determine measures of 
individual exposure (such as steady-state peak, trough, and tim e-averaged concentration). In 
addition, model determined exposures may be used for exposure-response analyses. Results of population PK and exposure response-analyses will be reported s eparately.
8.4.5 Biomarker Analyses
Summary s tatistics for peripheral bl ood and tumor biomarker activity such as, but not limited to 
CD30, PD-L1/L2 expression levels and their corresponding changes (or percent changes) from 
baseline will be tabulated by planned study visit to assess phar macodynamic effects. In addition, 
the time course of biomarker outcomes will be investigated graph ically; if there is indication of 
meaningful pattern across time, further analysis may be performe d to characterize the relationship. 
Results from peripheral blood and tumor biomarkers will be tabul ated and associations between 
biomarkers and efficacy or safety measures will be assessed. Met hods such as, but not limited to,
logistic regression will be used to explore possible associatio ns between measures of peripheral
blood, tum or biopsies a nd clinical outcome. More details of biomarker analyses will be described 
in the statistical analysis plan.
8.4.6 Outcomes Research Analyses
Subject’s overall health state on a visual analog scale (EQ-VAS ) at each assessment time point 
will be summarized using descriptive s tatistics (N, mean, standard deviation, median, first and
third quartiles, minimum, maximum). Proportion of subjects reporting problems for the 5 EQ-5D
3L dimensions at each assessment time point will be summarized by level of problem. Percentages
will be based on number subjects assessed at assessment time po int.

8.4.7 Other Analyses 
8.4.7.1 Immunogenicity Analyses
Immunogenicity ma y be re ported for ADA positive status (such as persistent positive, neutralizing 
positive, only last sample positive, baseline positive and other positive) and ADA negative status, 
relative to baseline. Effect of immunogenicity on safety, effic acy, biomarkers and PK may be 
explored. Additional details will be described in the SAP.
8.5 Interim Analyses
No formal interim analysis is planned. Interim analyses may be conducted if it is necessary in order 
to make decisions regarding further development. Summaries and listings of efficacy and safety 
will be provided. Interim analyses will not impact the study conduct and the trial will continue as planned.

If the revision is done via an administrative letter, investiga tors must inform their IRB(s)/IEC(s).
9.1.2 Monitoring
BMS representatives will review data centrally to identify potential issues to determine a schedule 
of on-site visits for targeted review of study records. 
Representatives of BMS must be allowed to visit all study site locations periodically to assess the 
data quality and study integrity. On site they will review stud y records and directly compare them 
with source documents, discuss the conduct of the study with the  investigator, and verify that the 
facilities remain acceptable.In addition, the study may be evaluated by BMS internal auditors and government inspectors who 
must be allowed access to CRFs, source documents, other st udy files, and stud y facilities. BMS 
audit reports will be kept confidential.
The investigator must notify BMS promptly of any inspections sc heduled by regulatory aut horities, 
and promptly forward copies of inspection reports to BMS. 
9.1.2.1 Source Documentation

*The recommendations from Lugano Classification is to use a 5 p oint scale to assess the metabolic 
response in PET-CT based response.
Response Evaluation in DLBCL, PTCL, PMBL & MGZL:
CR (Complete Remission)
The designation of CR requires all of the following be met:
1) Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of  disease.
a) PET-CT-based response: A score of d3 is considered to represent complete metabolic 
response.
b) CT based response: Target node/nodal masses must regress to d1.5 cm in LDi, with no 
extrlymphatic sites of disease.
Organ involvement: Absence of organomegaly ( Table 3 ).
2) Bone marrow: No evidence of FDG- avid disease in marrow. If th ere was evidence of 
involvement of bone marrow with lymphoma at screening/baseline and a biopsy was 
performed (PTCL), a bone marrow biopsy will be required to confirm CR.
3) The presence of residual symptoms in the absence of detectabl e disease by imaging does not 
preclude the designation of CR.
PR (Partial Remission)The designation of PR requires all of the following:1) PET-CT based response: Score of 4 or 5, provided reduced uptake compared with base line 
and absence of structural progression development on CT Scan.

2) CT based response: t50% regression in SPD of upto 6 measurable nodal and extranodal  
lesions ( Table 3).
3) Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by t50% in length beyond normal.
Bone marrow : reduced uptake compared with baseline. If there is evidence of nodal response but 
persistent focal changes in the marrow consider further evaluation ( Table 3 ).
SD (Stable Disease)
SD is defined as the following:
1) PET-CT based response: no metabolic response, score of 4  or 5 with no signif icant changes 
from baseline.
2) CT based response: < 50% decrease from baseline, absence of new lesions ( Table 3 ). 
3) Bone marrow: no change from baseline.
PD: Relapsed Disease (after CR)/Progressive Disease (after PR, SD)
1) PET-CT based response: Score of 4 or 5 with increase in inten sity from baseline or interim 
scan/ or any new FDG avid focus consistent with malignant lymph oma ( Table 3 ).
2) CT based response: New node, new or recurrent splenomegaly,pr ogression of existing lesions 
(Table 3 ).
IR (INDETERMINATE RESPONSE)
A patient will be considered to have Indeterminate Response (IR) in one or more of the 3 following 
circumstances
1) Increase in overall tumor burden (as assessed by SPD) of t50% of up to 6 measurable lesions 
in the first 12 weeks of therapy, without clinical deterioratio n (IR(1))
2) Appearance of new lesions; or growth of one or more existing lesion(s) of t50% at any time 
point during treatment occurring in the context of lack of over all progression (<50% increase) 
of overall tumor burden, as measured by SPD of up to 6 lesions a t any time during the tr eatment 
(IR(2))
3) Increase in FDG uptake of one or more lesion(s) without a con comitant increase in lesion size 
or number (IR(3))
It is possible that, at a single time point a subject could ful fill criteria for both IR(1 or 2) AND 
IR(3): for example, there could be a new FDG-avid lesion in the  absence of overall progression
(IR(2)), and, at the same time, increase in FDG uptake of a separate lesion (IR(3)). In such cases, 
the designation of IR(1 or 2) should take priority (eg, IR(2))

Follow-up of IR
1) In patients categorized as having any of the above types of I R, it is mandatory to obtain a repeat 
imaging after an additional 12 weeks (or earlier if clinically indicated). At that time, response 
should be re-evaluated and the patient should be considered to have true PD if the SPD of 
target lesion has increased further, with the considerations bel ow:
2) In the case of IR(1), the comparison should be between the fi rst IR(1) and the current SPD, 
with an increase of >10% constituting PD. In addition there should be an increase of > 5 mm 
(in either dimension ) of at least one lesion for lesions < 2 cm, and 10 mm for lesio ns > 2 cm, 
to be consistent with the Lugano classification (3)( Table 2 ). The 10% threshold is empiric but 
designed to account for variability in measurement (37), especially when taken along with the 
minimum increase. If the target SPD increase is < 10%, the response would still be categorized 
as IR(1), and the patient could continue treatment until a subsequent scan shows either true PD 
(> 10% increas e from first  IR(1) time point and an increase of >  5mm in either dimension of 
at least one lesion) or response (>50% decrease from baseline). In this situation, it is reasonable to repeat imaging in 4-8 weeks of the original IR(1) timepoint to ensure absence of significant further increase.
3) In the case of IR(2), the new or growing lesion(s) (unless bi opsy proven to be benign) should 
be added to the target lesion(s), up to a total of no more than  6 total lesions. If the SPD of the 
newly defined set of target lesions has increased > 50% from th e nadir value which may 
precede the IR time point. The patients is considered to have P D.
4) In the case of IR(3), since inflammatory responses may result in an increase in the standardized 
uptake value of a lesion, the patient will not be considered to have PD unless there is evidence 
of PD by an increase in lesion size or the development of new le sions, as noted above
5) Importantly, if a patient is assessed as having IR and then “true” PD at a subsequent time point 
(without an intervening objective response between IR and PD), the IR assessment should 
subsequently be corrected to PD for reporting purposes to the date of the pri or designation of 
IR

Response Evaluation in CTCL:
Response in CTCL w ill be evalu ated based on the involvement of different sites (lymph nodes, 
viscera, skin and blood) using the TNMB staging (as clinically i ndicated) and will be incorporated 
in the Global Response Score. The m SWAT will be used for skin scoring.
All responses to be designated as CR or PR, should be documented for at least 4 weeks in duration. 
No CR can be ascribed to a study drug while a patient remains o n concomitant therapy (such as 
topical steroids) with known efficacy in MF/SS.
In certain cases to document CR a biopsy may be required if there are limitations on Spiral CT 
scan or MRI examination for lymph node or viscera evaluation and if it is deemed necessary.
Blood evaluation for Sezary syndrome: The absolute number of CD 4+ CD26- determined on flow 
cytometry will be used to assess blood involvement. A normal value for CD+ CD26- or 
CD4+CD7- cells by flow cytometry is lower than 15%.Response in skin:m SWAT for skin soring/evaluation, to track skin tumor burden.CR: 100% clearance of skin lesions. 
PR: 50%-99% clearance of skin disease from baseline without new tumors (T3) in patients with 
T1, T2 or T4 only skin disease. ( t50% reduction in the mSWAT score compared with baseline).
Stable disease: < 25% increase to < 50% clearance in skin disease.from baseline without new 
tumors (T3) in patients with T1, T2, or T4 only skin disease. (Less than 50% reduction to less than 
25% increase in the mSWAT score compared with baseline).
Progressive disease: > 25% increas e in skin disease from baseline  or new tumors (T3) in patients 
with T1, T2 or T4 only skin disease or Loss of response: in tho se with complete or partial response, 
increase of skin score of greater than the sum of nadir plus 50 % baseline score. Relapse is any 
disease recurrence in those with complete response. ( t25% increase in the mSWAT score from 
baseline).Response in the lymph nodes will be assessed using a Spiral CT Scan or MRI.
CR: all lymph nodes d1.5 cm in greatest transverse (long axis) diameter by method us ed to assess 
lymph nodes at baseline or biopsy negative for lymphoma; in add ition, lymph nodes that were 
N3 classification and d1.5 cm in their long axis and > 1 cm in their short axis at bas eline, must be 
d1 cm in their short axis or biopsy negative for lymphoma.
PR: cumulative reduction t50% of the SPD of each abnormal lymph node at baseline and no new 
lymphnode > 1.5 cm in the diameter of the long axis or > 1.0 cm in the diameter of the short axis 
if the long axis is 1-1.5 cm diameter.
SD: fails to attain the criteria for CR, PR, and PD.

PD: > 50% increase in SPD from baseline of lymph nodes or any new  node > 1.5 cm in the long 
axis or > 1 cm in the short axis if 1-1.5 cm in the long axis t hat is proven to be N3 histologically 
or loss of response: > 50% increase from nadir in SPD of lymph nodes in those with PR.
Relapse is any new lymph node > 1.5 cm in the long axis in those with CR proven to be N3 
histologically.
Response in the viscera will be assessed using a Spiral CT Scan or MRI:CR: (viscera): liver , spleen or any organ considered involved a t baseline should not be enlarged 
on physical exam and should be considered normal by imaging; no nodules should be present on 
imaging of liver or spleen; any post treatment mass must be det ermined by biopsy to be negative 
for lymphoma.
PR:t50% regression in any splenic or liver nodules, or in measureab le disease (SPD) in any 
organs abnormal at baseline; no increase in size of liver or sp leen and no new sites of involvement.
SD: Fails to attain the criteria for CR, PR, or PD.
PD: > 50% increase in size (SPD) of any organs involved at baseline or new organ involvement or 
loss of response: > 50% increase from nadir in the size (SPD) of any previous organ involvement 
in those with PR.
Relapse new organ involvement in those with CR.Response in blood will be performed with peripheral blood flow cytometry.
CR: B0 (absence of blood involvement).
PR: > 50% decrease in quantitative measurements of bl ood tumor burden from baseline in those 
with high tumor burden at baseline (B2).SD: Fails to attain criteria for CR, PR, or PD.
PD: B0 to B2 or > 50% increase from baseline and at least 5,000 neoplastic cells/ L

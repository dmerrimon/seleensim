Heart failure (HF)1-5 is a disease of epidemic proportions in the United States affecting over 5 
million individuals. While the incidence of many diseases in the U.S. is decreasing, HF represents one 
of only two human diseases that are increasing in  frequency. It is estimated that  nearly 400,000 new 
cases of HF will be diagnosed in the next year, one million patients will be hospitalized, and 300,000 
patients w ill die from HF in the U.S. Although the development of new medications has substantially 
broadened the therapeutic armamentarium over the past decades, the long -term prognosis for patients 
with HF remains poor with less than 50% of patients surviving five  years after the initial diagnosis. A 
characteristic feature of HF is that it is a progressive disease with patients having repeated and 
progressively more frequent hospitalizations for worsening symptoms. HF puts an overwhelming 
burden on patients as evid enced by dramatically diminished quality of life (QOL). It also has a 
marked impact on the economics of our health system accounting for over 50 billion dollars in annual 
national healthcare expenditure.  
Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an establ ished therapy in HF6. HF patients with 
severe cardiomyopathy and ventricular conduction abnormalities, as demonstrated by a wide QRS 
waveform on surface electrocardiogram (>120 ms), who continue to suffer from HF symptoms (New 
York Heart Association Classe s II, III, and ambulatory IV) despite optimal pharmacological therapy 
1 KEY ROLES 
2 INTRODUCTION:  BACKGROUND  INFORMATION  AND  SCIENTIFIC  RATIONALE  
2.1 BACKGROUND  INFORMATION  
CRT-P vs. CRT -D 
Protocol  A Version  v.0.6  
         24 MAY 2018  
PROTOCOL  SUMMARY   
4  including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, -blockers, and 
potassium -sparing diuretics can benefit from CRT with improved maximum oxygen consumptio n, 
exercise tolerance, and improved QOL7,8. Results of large, multicenter, randomized controlled trials 
such as Companion9 and Care -HF10 demonstrate, in addition, a significant decrease in the composite 
endpoint of death or HF hospitalization with CRT over optimal pharmacological therapy. Studies also 
suggest a benefit of CRT on reducing the burden of ventricular arrhythmias11. It is estim ated that 
about 40% of patients who have systolic HF are CRT candidates by current guideline criteria6.   
CRT-P versus CRT -D  
CRT can be delivered through a pacemaker (CRT -P) or a defibrillator (CRT -D). CRT -P 
devices are smaller (i.e. require a smaller sur gical incision at implantation) and cost a fraction of the 
price of CRT -D devices. Both CRT -P and CRT -D provide resynchronization to the failing heart 
through low  energy pacing impulses, but CRT -D can additionally deliver high -energy shock therapy 
to termi nate life -threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Compared to optimal pharmacological 
treatment, both CRT -P and CRT -D have been shown in randomized controlled trials9,10 to reduce all -
cause mortality and improve patient symptoms and cardiac function. In one s tudy comparing them to 
each other9, CRT -P and CRT -D had equivalent benefits in reducing the composite endpoint of death 
or HF hospitalization9. For the endpoint of all -cause mortality however, CRT -D exhibited a non -
significant trend towards lower mortality  compared to CRT -P when considering HF patients of all 
ages9. Published guidelines do not distinguish between the clinical indications for CRT -P and CRT -
D6.  
High Energy Defibrillator Therapy is Non -Specific  
High energy defibrillator shocks are non -specifi c i.e. most defibrillator recipients never 
receive shock treatments. Of 100 patients implanted with a defibrillator for primary prevention, ~23% 
receive appropriate shocks in response to life -threatening ventricular arrhythmias over long term 
follow -up12. In addition, it is estimated that about 4 appropriate defibrillator shocks account for one 
life saved13, 14.  Moreover, defibrillators may deliver inappropriate therapy15 and may have significant 
short and long term complications16 thus negatively impactin g QOL. Shocks are painful, drain device 
battery, and add significantly to the cost of care for patients because of a higher burden of visits to the 
emergency department or outpatient clinics as well as admissions to the hospital and surgical 
procedures for  replacement of depleted device batteries. In addition, the number of defibrillators and 
defibrillator lead malfunctions resulting in advisories and recalls by the Food and Drug 
Administration have increased significantly over the past decade17 out of prop ortion to those seen 
with the simpler pacemaker devices, thus adding to the morbidity and mortality of defibrillator 
recipients and to the overall cost of health care.  
CRT in the Elderly  
The U.S. and Europe  populations are  getting older. For instance, in the United States, the 
population aged 80 -84 years increased by 16.1%, and those aged 85 -89 years increased by 29.8% 
from 2000 to 201018. Although not excluded from the large CRT randomized trials9, 10, older patients 
(≥75 years)  have been largely underrepresented in these trials but still receive up to 40% of all CRT -
D’s in the United States19,38. Moreover, older patients have a higher risk of death than younger 
patients based on competing causes of death and comorbid conditions, t hus stirring controversy 
regarding the role of defibrillator therapy in the elderly20-24. In addition, data from large CRT -D 
registries show that the odds of receiving appropriate defibrillator shocks decrease significantly with 
every decade of age25. 
 
 
CRT-P vs. CRT -D 
Protocol  A Version  v.0.6  
         24 MAY 2018  
PROTOCOL  SUMMARY   
5  Potential Impact  
  A large, randomized, non -inferiority trial comparing mortality and QOL in older HF patients 
receiving CRT -P versus CRT -D therapy addresses a critical clinical practice area. Uncertainty about 
the comparative outcomes of older patients with  these two therapies leads to suboptimal and costly 
management of HF: Older CRT recipients often receive the larger and more expensive CRT -D device 
that can deliver painful shocks, in the absence of any proof for incremental survival benefit with 
CRT -D ove r CRT -P. The pilot randomized trial of this proposal (Aim 1) will be essential to the 
design of a large pivotal trial. This project will also have significant scientific impact because it will 
evaluate  the clinical and demographic predictors of choosing CR T-P or CRT -D therapy as well as 
patients’ change in their satisfaction with their decision 6 months after enrollment. The results of this 
research will ultimately effect clinical change in the management of elderly CRT recipients driven by 
changes to the CRT published guidelines. This research is likely to impact clinical practice and will 
be important to many stakeholders, including elderly patients and their families, physicians, hospitals, 
and third party payers, especially Medicare.  
 
Since the initial introduction of the defibrillator as a life -saving therapy almost 30 years ago, 
most large scale clinical trials9, 10, 12 -16 have focused on expanding its clinical indications by 
identifying newer patient groups at increased risk of sudden cardiac death that may benefit from this 
therapy. From the original surgically -implanted single -chamber ‘shock box’ devices used in survivors 
of cardiac arrest, the field moved steadily in the direction of expanding the indications to larger 
patient  groups. Today, defibrillators are implanted mainly for primary prevention of sudden cardiac 
death in patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction (≤35%) who have never experienced a life -
threatening arrhythmia13, 14. They are also implanted in HF patients, a significant proportion of whom 
requires CRT devices9, 10. Driven by industry sponsors, on -going trials are now investigating the role 
of the implantable defibrillator in patients with relatively preserved ventricular function (ejection 
fraction  between 36% and 50%)26 who never had ventricular arrhythmias. Yet, despite the established 
benefits of defibrillator therapy on survival, few patients implanted with these devices receive 
electrical treatment from them19.  
The proposed research is innovat ive because it takes a perspective that goes in the opposite 
direction to most studies of the past 3 decades that have aimed to expand the indications for 
defibrillator therapy. Instead, our project investigates whether in a subset of patients (age ≥ 75 years) 
who are currently indicated for CRT device implantation, the smaller, simpler, and cheaper CRT -P is 
equivalent to the CRT -D in decreasing mortality and improving QOL. Of note, the proposed patient 
population overwhelmingly receives CRT -D therapy in th e U.S. today (>80% of cases)27, presumably 
because of an overinflated estimate of the protective role of defibrillator therapy in these patients, 
which is based on results extrapolated from other non -CRT trials, which were performed in different 
patient po pulations13-15. As opposed to studying the eligibility of non -indicated patients to receive an 
available therapy with the goal of expanding its clinical indications, we propose to study a subgroup 
of patients that is currently indicated for CRT -D therapy a ccording to the published national 
guidelines6 and CMS  reimbursement policies28 but is poorly represented in large randomized trials14 
and is least likely to benefit from defibrillator therapy.  
Our proposal is also important because it focuses exclusively on elderly patients who 
although not excluded from randomized trials of cardiac implantable electronic devices, have been 
grossly underrepresented in these trials9, 10, 12 -16. Elderly patients  constitute a fast -growing stratum of 
the United Sat es population and an important one given that the burden of cardiac disease and the 
cost of health care increase dramatically in the later years of life. To our knowledge, the proposed 
trial would be the first cardiac implantable electronic device trial to  be performed exclusively in

PROTOCOL  SUMMARY

patients 75years of age or older, thus focusing on this large stratum of the population that is 
neglected in clinical cardiac research.  
  Finally, our research will create a cohort of patients who declined enrollment into the pilot 
randomized controlled trial. This observational cohort will provide an opportunity to examine the 
clinical and demographic determinants of choosing CRT -P versus CRT -D in older HF patients. 
These decisions are typically made by the patients with help from caregivers and other family 
members, after discussing the pros and cons with the treating physician. We will also assess the 
patients’ satisfaction with their decision to receive CRT -P versus CRT -D, at baseline and 6 months 
after enrollment. Examining  the factors that predict patients’ choice of CRT -P versus CRT -D in HF 
management and the level of satisfaction of patients is novel in the field of cardiac implantable 
electronic device management.
 
 
For the Aim 1 randomized trial subjects, they will be screened for appropriateness of the trial 
before being randomized. If there is any indication that the patient should receive a CRT -D over a 
CRT -P then the patient will not be considere d for the trial. Once the patient is enrolled in the Aim 1 
the choice to have a randomized decision will not increase any health risks to the patient.  Both the 
CRT -P and CRT -D device implantations are part of the standard medical care for HF patients. The  
risks involved with the implantation of either device are comparable to those of patients not enrolled 
in this research study. The risks include, but are not limited to, death, stroke, heart attack, damage to 
the heart or lungs or veins, infections, bleed ing, arrhythmias, or the need for emergent open -heart 
surgery. These risks are the same in patients undergoing the CRT -P or CRT -D implantation 
procedures but who are not enrolled in this research study.   Defibrillator devices include additional 
risk of  shocks that can occur when there is an abnormal heart rhythm detected by the device. 
Occasionally, the device may deliver a shock for unintended reasons (a benign heart rhythm or noise).  
For the observational Aim there is no additional health risk to the patients as only the patients’ 
health information will be collected. There is a risk that the patients personal or health information 
may become exposed outside of the observational trial.  This risk will be minimized by using all 
possible safeguards to help reduce risk of exposure. This risk also applies to the Aim 1 subjects.  
 
There may be no direct benefits to the subjects as a result of their  participation in this study. 
The possible benefits of this procedure, using the pacemaker or the defibrillator, would be to help the 
subjects  heart function in a more synchronized manner. By  participating in this study, subjects  may 
contribute valuable in formation to medical science that may b enefit future patients with their  same 
condition . The sponsor cannot guarantee any benefit to the subjects for their participation in this 
study. 
 
The primary objective is to evaluate and determine the feasibility of enrolling and maintaining 
elderly heart failure patients in  the CRT -P versus CRT -D randomized trial. Additionally, for Aim 2, 
the observational arm will also maintain the same objective. Secondary objective is to examine the 
predictors of undergoing Pacemaker versus Defibrillator device implantation in elderly pat ients 
(≥75b years) .

PROTOCOL  SUMMARY   
7   
 
The design of this pilot study is in two parts corresponding to Aims 1 and 2 (Figure 1). Aim 1 
is designed as a pilot randomized, controlled trial to be conducted at 4 institutions in the United 
States. It will randomize older patients (≥ 75 years) who are indicated for CRT device implantation to 
receive a CRT -P or a CRT -D. The choice of the design of Aim 1 was intended to mimic the design 
of a future large , multicenter, non -inferiority trial which would provide definitive answers regarding 
the relative impact of CRT -P versus CRT -D on total mortality and QOL in older patients. This 
specific design is necessary to allow the gathering of hard data on rates of screening of patients, 
acceptance of enrollment, randomization, device implantation, and patient retention during follow -
up. Any design variations are likely to introduce biases which would increase the chances of flawed 
design of the pivotal trial.  
Aim 2  is a non -randomized, observational study of patients who were offered inclusion into 
Aim 1 but refused to participate. We speculate that a majority of those patients who refuse 
participation in the randomized pilot trial do so because of a strong preferen ce for CRT -P or CRT -D. 
This cohort complements Aim 1 and presents an opportunity to understand the reasons why older 
patients may refuse enrollment into a randomized trial of CRT -P versus CRT -D and to examine the 
demographic and clinical determinants assoc iated with choosing a CRT -P versus a CRT -D device. It 
also provides the means to measure patients’ QOL and satisfaction32-34 with decision (CRT -P or 
CRT -D), at baseline and  6 months after enrollment into this observational cohort.

With the Aim 1 randomized subjects the primary endpoint is the  ability to enroll in the 
randomized controlled trial of CRT -P versus CRT -D patients. The subjects enrolled with aid in 
determining and assessing feasibility of screening, enrolling, randomizing, and retaining participants 
in this pilot trial. 
 
 The subjects enrolled in Aim 2 will help to determine the clinical and demographic 
characteristics of subjects who refused participation in the pilot randomized trial and to compare 
them to those in Aim 1.  Therefore the secondary endpoint is the determination of predictors of 
refusing participation in CRT -P versus CRT -D clinical trial.

PROTOCOL  SUMMARY   
9  Patients identified in Aim 1 who refuse to participate will be offered to enroll in the 
observational cohort of Aim 2 . Patients are eligible to enroll in the observational cohort  at the time 
of implant through fourteen days’ post procedure. There is  a separate written, informed consent 
designed specifically for the prospective observational study. Sites are to collect , from all patients 
enrolled in Aim  2, their reas on(s) why they refused enrollment in Aim 1. It is anticipate d that a 
majority of these patients will accept participating in the observational study of Aim 2 that allows 
them to retain control over their decision.  
The research coordinator at each site will maintain a detailed log  of all patients who were 
offered participation in the non -randomized observational cohort, whether they signed a consent 
form or not. Reasons for declining participation in the research prot ocol of Aim 2 will be recorded. 
The inclusion and exclu sion criteria for Aim 2 are identical to Aim 1.  
 
Patients presenting to the outpatient cardiology clinics or inpatient services of the 4 
participating institutions and who are prescribed CRT device implantation or CRT -D device change -
out for battery depletion will be considered for participation in this pilot randomized trial. The main 
investigator at each site will identify prospective patients who may require CRT device implantation. 
This will be achieved by screening the inpatient services and outpatient clinics of the cardiac 
electrophysiology service s at each site. Research coordinators will verify that the prospective subjects 
meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria for the study. Once this information is 
ascertained, the investigator, research coordinator, or both will approach the  patient to explain the 
rationale  of the study and its requirements. After signing written informed consent, patients will be 
randomized to receive a CRT -P or a CRT -D device. Block randomization by enrolling site will be 
adopted. The randomization status o f the patient will be communicated to the treating cardiologist. Of 
note, the surgical procedure for CRT -P or CRT -D implantation is similar with respect to duration and 
risk of the procedure, with the exception that CRT -D implantations require a larger ski n incision 
(~1.5 inches versus 0.75 inches).  
The research coordinator at each site will maintain a log of all patients who were screened for 
this pilot trial. The log should include reasons for why the patient did not meet either the inclusion or 
the exclu sion criteria. Additionally, the log would also include the patient’s reason for not wanting to 
enroll in the Aim 1 clinical trial. This log will be maintained at each individual site and redacted of 
identifiable information in order to send to the sponsor  upon request. Use of patient initials and age 
will be used in place of patient’s full name and date of birth.  
 
During the consenting process subjects will be informed of their rights to withdraw from the 
study at any time without prejudice . Subjects who no longer attend their required in -office follow -up 
or are unable to be reached by telephone after 2 documented attempts by investigator, will be 
considered lost to follow -up. These subjects will not underg o any additional study activities once 
they have been withdrawn.  The Social Security Death Index37 will only be used as an adjunctive 
method of confirming death if no contact at all could be established with the patient or family during 
follow -up. Any iden tifiable research or medical record information recorded  for, or resulting from, 
the subject’s  participation in this research s tudy prior to the date that they formally withdraw 
consent may continue to be used and disclosed by the investigators for researc h purposes.  
A patient may be discontinued from participating in this research if their device implantation 
procedure is not successful or is complicated by death or if they fail to follow -up after device 
implantation according to the research protocol requ irements.

PROTOCOL  SUMMARY   
10   
This study  may be  temporarily suspended  or prematurely terminated if  there  is sufficient 
reasonable  cause.  Written notification, documenting the reason for study  suspension  or 
termination, will be provided by the suspending  or terminating party  to each of the individual sites. 
It is the responsibility of each individual site to then notify their respective IRB.  If the  study is  
prematurely terminated  or suspended, the  PI will promptly  inform  the sponsors IRB and  will 
provide the reason(s) for the  termination  or suspension to each site. The study may resume  once  
concerns about  safety,  protocol  compliance, data quality are  addressed  and satisfy the sponsor and 
IRB. Before resuming any study enrollments each individual site must first receive notification 
from the sponsor.  
 
Randomization Aim  
 Table 1  details the baseline data collected for every enrolled patient.  Baseline demographics 
(e.g. age, gender, and race) and clinical information (e.g. cardiac condition, comorbid conditions, 
echocardiographic parameters, EKG parameters) will be abstracted from  the electronic medical 
records of each participating institution. QOL questionnaires will be obtained at enrollment and at 
the 6 -month follow -up visit using both the RAND -36 health Status Inventory35 and the Minnesota 
Living with Heart Failure Questionnai re36. A paper and pencil option will be provided unless the 
patient is unable to read or write in which case the questionnaires will be administered verbally by a 
research coordinator.  
  Patients will be followed in the pilot randomized trial from the dat e of enrollment until study 
closure. During follow -up, information will be collected on procedural details and complications, as 
well as clinical events including death, hospitalizations, and emergency room visits. The events will 
be ascertained by asking the patient or their caregiver. Data pertaining to hospitalizations and 
emergency room visits will be readily available if they occurred at the enrolling institution. If at 
another institution, these data will be collected by asking the patient to sign a r elease of medical 
records form and by obtaining relevant clinical information from the other institution. The cause of 
death and primary reason for hospitalization will be adjudicated as cardiac (arrhythmic or non -
arrhythmic) or non -cardiac by an adjudicat ion committee that is independent from the research 
team . For the CRT -D arm of the study, information about appropriate and inappropriate device 
shocks and anti -tachycardia pacing therapies will be collected. Importantly, rates of patient 
screening, enrollment, randomization, and retention in the study will also  be collected.

 The milestones of data collection are detailed in Table 2.  Patients enrolled in the randomized 
pilot trial will have baseline demographic, clinical, and pharmacological information collected after 
they sign written informed consent. QOL questionnaires and patient satisfaction will also be obtained 
at baseline. At the scheduled date of device implantation, which will be within 30 days of enrollment, 
procedural details will be collected including total and fluoroscopic durations of the procedure, device 
and l ead models, and any acute major or minor procedural complications. Patients whose device 
implantation procedure is scheduled > 30 days from the date of enrollment have to be re -consented 
for participation in this trial. In follow -up, each patient will be c ontacted by phone at 30 days, 3 
months, and 6 months post enrollment and every 6 months thereafter until the end of the study. The 
phone calls will be used to collect interim information from patients or next of kin regarding non -
acute procedural complicat ions or clinical events (e.g. death, hospitalization). Original medical 
records will be obtained for all clinical events and will be reviewed by an independent adjudication 
committee. Each scheduled phone visit will also be associated with a remote device interrogation to 
assess device function and obtain information about stored arrhythmic events.  
Observational Aim  
Patients enrolled in the observational cohort of Aim 2 will have demographic and clinical data 
collected at baseline similarly to patients enr olled in the ra ndomized trial of Aim 1. Table 1  details 
the clinical variables collected at enrollment. Table 2  details the follow -up milestones. Also, 
patients enrolled in Aim 2 of this proposal will undergo QOL assessment using the RAND -36 
Health Status Inventory35 and the Minnesota Living with heart Failure Questionnaire36 (Appendices 
1 and 2) at baseline and at the 6 -month follow -up visit which could be conducted by phone. 
Procedural information and complications as well as clinical events will be collected on patients 
enrolled in the non -randomized observational cohort, similarly to patients enrolled in Aim 1 . Data 
on cost of care will also be collected for all patients enrolled in Aim 2.  
In addition, patients enrolled in the observational cohort will be asked about  their decision  to 
receive a CRT -P or CRT -D device and will be probed for the reason (s) behind their decision and 
their answers will be recorded. The actual type of device implanted (CRT -P versus CRT -D) will be 
ascertained at the time of the implantation procedure. At baseline and at the 6-month research call, 
they will be assessed for their level of satisfaction with their decision about device therapy (CRT -P 
or CRT -D) using the Satisfaction with Decision Scale32-34 (Appendix 3 ), which  assigns a score of 1 
to 5 to the answer of each of 6 questions pertaining to the patient’s level of satisfaction with their 
medical decision (lowest satisfaction score is 6 and highest is 30).

The main investigator at each of the participating institutions will be responsible daily for the  
appropriate implementation of study protocols and for patient safety. All adverse events will be 
reported to the  DSMB, to the local IRB of the participating institution where the adverse event 
occurred  per their respective reporting guidelines , and  if requ ired, to the NHLBI.  Each adverse event 
will be classified by the site investigator as ‘study -related’ or ‘not study related’ and  reviewed by the 
DSMB for adjudication. Serious adverse events (death, procedural complications, or  hospitalizations 
for any rea son) will be reported to the coordinating center and the local IRB (per their reporting 
guidelines) within 48 hours of adverse event awareness.  
 
  The study  clinician will  have oversite of completed  SAE  Form s. Reporting of the forms should 
occur  within  the following  timelines:  
 
• All deaths  and immediately  life-threatening events,  whether  related  or unrelated  to the 
clinical trial , will be recorded  on the SAE  Form and submitted  to the study  sponsor  
within  48 hours  of site awareness.   
• Other  SAEs  regardless  of relationship  will be submitted  to the study  sponsor  within 72  
hours  of site awareness.  
 
All SAEs  will be followed  until resolution  or until the site investigator  deems  the event  to be 
chronic  or stable.  Other  supporting documentation  of the event  may be requested  by the study  
sponsor  and should be  provided  as soon  as possible.   
 
Safety  oversight  will be under  the direction of a DSMB  composed  of individuals  with the 
appropriate  expertise,  including  cardiologists.  The DSMB  will meet  at least quarterly  to assess  
safety  and efficacy  data on each arm of the study.  The DMSB will  operate  under  the rules  of 
an approved  charter  that will be written  and reviewed at  the organizational  meeting  of the 
DSMB.  At this time,  each data  element  that the DSMB  needs to  assess  will be clearly  defined. 
The DSMB  will provide  its input  to the NHLBI.

PROTOCOL  SUMMARY   
13   
The primary  responsibility  of the DSMB , an independent group of experts that a dvises the 
study investigators, is to oversee the progress of the study and review adverse events. All adverse 
events  in both arms of the clinical trial will be reviewed and adjudicated as ‘research -related’ or 
not. Stoppage rules of the clinical trial will be mandated by the DSMB if examination of the 
adverse events revealed  that one treatment arm is clearly superior to the other treatment for the 
primary endpoint of all -cause mortality.  The DSMB will also review the overall progress of the 
trial, the quality of data collection, the safety and  confidentiality of data storage, and the overall 
management of the trial. A Data and Safety Monitoring report will  be generated including 
information on study status and enrollment milestones, quality of data collected, and  safety data.  
 
 
Randomized Aim  
 
Descriptive patient characteristics will be presented as mean (SD) for continuous  variables and 
n (%) for categorical variables.  Baseline comparisons of patients assigned to CRT -P vs. CRT -D will 
be performed using t -tests for continuous variables (Wilcoxo n rank -sum test if non -normally 
distributed) and chi -squared tests for categorical variables (Fisher’s Exact Test in case of small 
sample sizes within cells) to confirm that the randomized treatment arms are balanced in key 
demographics and potential confo unders.  The proportion of patients experiencing major/minor 
procedural complications within 30 days will be reported as n (%) within each treatment arm. These 
complication rates will be ascertained through review of pertinent medical records following the  
device implantation. Mortality [as n (%)] and the 6 -month QOL outcomes [as mean (SD)] within each 
treatment arm will be reported as well.  Cost of care for the index hospitalization for CRT device 
implantation and for the follow -up period will be measured  at the conclusion of the study and 
compared between the 2 cohorts using a 2 -sample t -test (or Wilcoxon test if the data are non -normally 
distributed). Retention will be presented as n (%) completing at least 6 -month of follow -up.  In 
addition to the reten tion, in order to document the recruitment success, we will report the number of 
patients approached in order to successfully enroll n=50 patients, which will be useful information in 
planning a large scale trial . 
 
Observational Aim  
 
All patients who do no t enroll in the trial, but consent to be followed, will be enrolled in a 
parallel observational cohort.  Patients’ clinical and demographic characteristics will be examined and 
compared between CRT -P and CRT -D recipients using t -tests, Wilcoxon rank -sum te sts, chi -squared 
tests, or Fisher’s Exact tests, as appropriate. Patient satisfaction among CRT -P vs. CRT -D recipients 
will be assessed  at baseline and  6 months after enrollment using the Satisfaction with Decision Scale. 
The scores will be presented as me an (SD) and tested using a 2 -sample t -test (or Wilcoxon test if the 
data are non -normally distributed). Deceased patients will be included in the analysis (assigned the 
lowest possible satisfaction score of 6) to avoid survival bias in the event of differe ntial mortality in 
CRT -P vs. CRT -D. Cost of care will also be presented as mean (SD) and compared between the two 
cohorts using a 2 -sample t -test (or Wilcoxon test if the data are non -normally distributed).  
Multivariate modeling with adjustment for select ed patient factors will be considered if there are 
differences in CRT -P vs. CRT -D patients on key demographics, but the power to test this difference 
while accounting for multiple confounders may be limited.

PROTOCOL  SUMMARY   
14   
Randomized Aim  
 
It will be of interest to estimate the recruitment success rate and the retention rate in this 
population, as that will be useful knowledge for designing a pivotal non -inferiority trial.  The 
proposed sample size of 50 patients guarantees a maximum sample standard  deviation = √(.5*(1 -
.5)/50) = 7%, meaning that a 95% confidence interval will have a maximum margin of error ± 13% in 
estimating true retention rate.  However, this margin -of-error may be lower (the further the sample 
retention is from 50%).  For example,  if 40/50=80% participants enrolled complete at least the 6 -
month visit, a 95% CI estimating the true 6 -month retention in this population would range from 
68.9-91.1%, information that can be used to guide recruitment estimates for the large scale trial.  The 
recruitment success rate can be estimated with even more precision, as there will be a larger N 
approached than N enrolled (and thus a smaller standard deviation of the sample proportion).  
 
Observational Aim  
 
It is anticipate d based on the physician an d patient surveys that approximately 40% of patients 
offered the opportunity to enroll in the pilot randomized controlled trial of Aim 1 will do so.  
Therefore, 125 patients  will need to be screen  to enroll 50 in the  pilot randomized trial.  It is assumed  
that 80% of those who decline participation in Aim 1 will agree to be followed in the observational 
cohort, the cohort will consist of 60 non -randomized patients.  A comparison will be scored  on the 
Satisfaction with  Decision Scale using a t -test (or Wilcoxon rank -sum test, if non -normally 
distributed).  Assuming roughly equal numbers select CRT -D vs. CRT -P, enrollment of 60 cohort 
participants will have 80% power to detect a difference in Satisfaction with Decision s cores if one 
treatm ent group’s average score is at  least 0.75 standard deviations higher than the other group.  
 
Randomized Aim  
 
Based on the total volume of CRT recipients at the 4 enrolling institutions and the estimated 
percentage of acceptance of patients to enroll in a randomized CRT -P versus CRT -D trial provid ed by 
the physician (Appendix 1 ) and patient (Appendix 2 ) surveys, it is  anticipate d that the actual 
enrollment rate will exceed the rate needed to reach the target sample size of 50 patients in Aim 1 
over a 1.25 -year enrollment period. The required threshold for the rate of enrollment is 0.83 patients 
per institution per month. If the ac tual enrollment rate turns out to be slower than expected, then more 
institutions m ay be added to the pilot trial. The data gathered from this pilot trial will be necessary to 
inform the design of a future large, non -inferiority, randomized trial of CRT -P versus CRT -D with 
respect to number of sites needed and duration of the enrollment phase.  
The present pilot randomized trial is by necessity un -blinded, i.e. patients and physicians 
know whether the implanted device is a CRT -P or CRT -D. In order to better understand if there are 
biases in the type of patients who accept randomization, the research is to be conducted as  described 
in Aim 2  by doing so this  will provide insight into the determinants of accepting participation in the 
randomized trial (compare p atients in Aim 1 versus Aim 2) as well as insights into the determinants 
of choosing a CRT -P versus CRT -D device (compare patients in Aim 2 who received CRT -P versus 
CRT -D).

Protocol  A Version  v.0.6  
         24 MAY 2018  
PROTOCOL  SUMMARY   
15  Observational Aim  
 
The sample size needed for Aim 2 is likely to be easily ac hieved as we will offer enrollment to 
all patients screened but not enrolled into Aim 1. We expect the patient acceptance to enroll in an 
observational study where no clinical decisions are imposed by the research protocol to be very 
high. If our estimates  of enrollment turn out to be too optimistic however, we would consider 
adding another institution to the research protocol to mitigate this issue.  
The main purpose of Aim 2 is to provide insight into which patients refuse to enroll in the 
large RCT and w hy in order to inform the design of the pivotal RCT. Since all investigators on this 
proposal are electrophysiologists, if the pilot proposal were to reveal that a major reason for 
patients’ refusal to participate in a randomized study of CRT -P vs. CRT -D is because of the opinion 
of their referring cardiologist about the relative merits of these devices, then the pivotal RCT could 
be designed to include referring cardiologists as primary site investigators, which would likely 
mitigate this problem. This is one example for how the results of Aim 2 may inform the design of 
the large scale trial.  
 
The individual study sites will maintain a patient binder to include all source documents that 
correlate with the information that is obtained with this trial. The sponsor has the right to request 
redacted source documents to aid in verification of informa tion provided for the sole purpose of the 
trial. With each adverse event that is reported, the sites will submit all source documents pertaining 
to that event. These records will also be redacted of any patient identifiable information and marked 
with the corresponding patient identification number and correlating case report form. Each site is 
responsible for maintaining a patient log that indicates the patient that corresponds with their study 
identification number.  
 
QC procedures  will be implemented beginning with the data entry system  and data QC checks  
will be run on the database  for reports to be generated.  Any missing data  or data anomalies  will be 
communicated  to the site(s)  for clarification/resolution.  Each site is responsible for conducting the  
clinical trial  and that the data is generated,  documented  (recorded), and reported  in compliance  with 
the protocol,  GCP,  and the applicable  regulatory  requirements . The investigational  sites will 
provide  access  to all trial related information , source  data/documents,  and reports  for the purpose  of 
monitoring and auditing by  the sponsor.  
 
 
The investigator  at each site  will ensure  that this study  is conducted  in full conformity  with 
Regulations  for the Protection  of Human Subjects  of Research . All personal planning to be involved 
must ensure that the trial is performed and the data are generated, documented (recorded), and 
reported in compliance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirement(s) . 
 
The protocol,  informed  consent  form(s),  and all participant  materials  will be submitted  to the 
IRB for review  and approval.  Approval  of both the protocol  and the consent  form  must  be obtained  
before  any participant  is enrolled.  Any amendment  to the protocol  will require  review  and approval  
by the IRB before  the changes  are implemented  to the  study.  All changes  to the consent form  will 
also need  IRB approv al; a determination  will be made  regarding whether  previously  consented  
participants  need to  be re-consented.  Any changes to the consent by the individual sites will first be 
required to obtain approval from the sponsor prior to submitting changes to the IRB.

PROTOCOL  SUMMARY   
16   
Informed  consent  is a process  that is initiated prior  to the individual’s  agreeing to participate  
in the  study  and continues  throughout  the individual’s  study  participation.  Participants and their 
families should be informed of risks and possible benefits of participation.  Consent  forms  will be 
IRB-approved  and the participant  will be asked  to read and review  the document.  The investigator  
will explain  the research study  to the participant  and answer  any questions  that may arise.  All 
participants  will receive  a verbal  explanation in terms  suited  to their comprehension  of the 
purposes,  procedures,  and potential  risks  of the study  and of their rights  as research  participants.   
Participants  will have  the opportunity  to carefully  review  the written  consent  form  and ask 
questions  prior  to signing.  
The participants  should have  the opportunity  to discuss  the study  with their family members  
or think  about  it prior  to agreeing to  participate.  The participant  will sign the informed  consent 
document  prior  to any procedures  being done  specifically  for the study.  The participants  may 
withdraw  consent  at any time throughout  the course  of the trial. A copy  of the informed  consent 
document  will be given  to the participants  for their records.  The rights  and welfare  of the 
participants  will be protected by emphasizing to  them  that the quality of their medical  care will  not 
be adversely  affected  if they decline  to participate  in this study. Additionally, each informed 
consent process will be documented and maintained with the original copy of the consent at each 
study site according their institutional SOP.  
 
Participant  confidentiality  is strictly  held in trust by the participating investigators,  their staff,  
and the sponsor . This confidentiality  is extended  to cover  clinical information relating to 
participants.  Therefore,  the study  protocol,  documentation,  data,  and all other  information 
generated  will be held in strict  confidence.  No information  concerning the  study  or the data will be 
released to  any unauthorized  third party  without  prior  written  approval  of the sponsor.  The study  
participant’s  contact  information  will be securely  stored  at each  clinical  site for internal  use during 
the study.  At the end of the study,  all records  will continue  to be kept in a secure  location for as 
long a period as dictated  by local  IRB and Institutional  regulations.  
Study  participant  research  data,  which is for purposes  of statistical  analysis  and scientific  
reporting,  will be transmitted  to and stored  at UPMC.  This will not  include  the participant’s  
contact  or identifying information.  Rather,  individual  participants  and their  research data  will be 
identified  by a unique  study  identification number. The study  data entry  and study  management  
systems  used by clinical sites and by UPMC research  staff will be secured and password protected. 
At the end of the study,  all study  databases  will be de-identified  and archived at  the UPMC.  
 
 
Data  collection is the responsibility  of the clinical  trial staff at the site under  the supervision of 
the site PI. The investigator  is responsible  for ensuring  the accuracy,  completeness,  legibility,  and 
timeliness  of the data reported.  
All source  documents  should be  completed in a neat,  legible  manner  to ensure  accurate  
interpretation  of data.  Black  ink is required  to ensure  clarity  of reproduced  copies.  When  making  
changes  or corrections,  cross  out the original  entry  with a  single  line, and initial  and date the 
change.   DO NOT  ERASE,  OVERWRITE,  OR USE  CORRECTION  FLUID  OR TAPE  ON THE  
ORIGINAL.  
Copies of the electronic CRF (eCRF) will be provided for use as source documents and 
maintained for recording data for each participant enrolled in the study . Data  reported  in the eCRF  
derived  from  source  documents  should be  consistent  with the source  documents  or the discrepancies

PROTOCOL  SUMMARY   
17  should be  explained  and captured in a progress  note and maintained  in the participant’s  official  
electronic  study  record.  
All clinical data will be entered into REDcap by the individual sites, the data system will be 
provided by UPMC . The data system includes  password  protection and internal  quality checks,  
such as automatic  range  checks,  to identify  data that appear inconsistent,  incomplete,  or 
inaccurate.  Clinical data  will be entered directly  from the source  documents.  
 
Each individual site is required to maintain  research records for a period of no  less than seven 
years after the study ends. The sponsor may continue to use and disclose study records which may 
contain subject identifiable information related to this research study for a minimum of 10 years and 
for as long (indefinite) as it may take to complete this research study.  
 
A protocol  deviation is any  noncompliance with the  clinical trial protocol  or GCP 
requirements.  The noncompliance  may be either on  the part  of the  participant, the  investigator, or  
the study site staff.  It is the  responsibility  of the site  to use continuous  vigilance  to identify and  
report deviations  within 7 -14 working days of identification  of the protocol deviation,  or within  7-
14 working days  of the scheduled protocol -required activity.  All deviations  must  be addressed in 
study  source  documents and  reported the sponsor.  Protocol deviations  must  be sent to the local 
IRB per their  guidelines. The site PI/study staff is responsible for  knowing  and adhering to their 
IRB requirements.  
 
 The sponsor plans to make the dataset generated by this research available to other 
investigators in the field. To that end, the sponsor will make the data available through the NHLBI 
data repository managed by BioLINCC, within 2 years of the end of the cl inical activities and the 
publication of the main findings. The sponsor will also provide full description of variable 
definitions, format, forms used in data collection as well as study procedures and protocols. A

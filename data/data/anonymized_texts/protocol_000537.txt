 16 Introduction  
Non -Hodgkin lymphoma  
Non-Hodg kin lymphom a (NHL ) is the most commo n hematologi c malignanc y in adults . The 
majority of NHL ar e of B- cell origin and are characterized  by the expression of mem brane 
antige n CD2 0 which is important in cel l cycle initiatio n and differenti ation (Anderson et al. 
1984).  
 
Indolent NHL s are a heterogeneou s group of malignant lymphomas and account for  about 
one-third of all NHLs . Follic ular lymphoma is  the most  common subtype  of indolen t NHL in 
the Wester n hemispher e and is associate d with follicl e center B cells that typicall y contai n 
the BCL2 chromosom e translocatio n t(14:18) , which  lead s to overexpres sion of the 
intracell ular anti- apoptotic prote in Bcl- 2.  
 
Early - stag e indolen t NHL ma y be  effectivel y treated with radiatio n therapy , but advance d 
stage s remai n incurable and there is no established standard of care for previously untreated 
follicular lymphoma (Friedber g et al. 2009).  
 
Natural History and Current Management of Indolent Non -Hodgkin Lymphoma  
Natural History 
The clinical cours e of indolent NHL is characterize d by remissio n and relapse 
(Gallaghe r et al. 1986) . The diseas e oft en initiall y responds to immunochemotherapy , 
but most patient s eventuall y suffer multipl e relapses distinguishe d by increasin g 
resistance and decreasin g duration of respons e in subsequent  lines of therapy.  
Patients with advance -stage diseas e are not usuall y cured with convent ional treatmen t 
and ultimatel y die from recurrent diseas e or treatm ent- relate d toxicity. 
 
Current Management  
Ther e is no standar d treatmen t for the managemen t of advance d follic ular lymphoma , and 
data from the Nationa l LymphoCare  registry demonstrate that  practic e varie s widely 
amon g physician s (Friedber g et al. 2009) .  Fo r follicular lymphom a patient s requirin g 
treatment , immunochemot herapy wit h rituximab,  a monoclona l antibody directe d again st 
CD20, plus chemotherapy has demonstrate d improvement s in respons e rates, 
progression- free survival  (PFS), and overal l surviva l compare d with chemotherapy alone in 
four studies (Hiddeman n et al. 2005; Herol d et al. 2007; Marcu s et al. 2008; Salle s et al. 
2008) . Despite high response rates, and median PFS exceeding 5 years with the addition 
of maintenance rituximab (Salles et al. 2011), chemoimmunotherapy is not considered 
curative in FL, as patients continue to relapse.  In addition, the side effect profile associated with cytotoxic therapy raises the question, what is the optimal frontline strategy for FL?

 17 Obinutuzumab Background  
Structure and Mechanism of Action of Obinutuzumab  
Obinutuzumab (GA101, RO5072759), is a glycoengineered, humanized, type II anti -
CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb).  Obinutuzumab w as derived by humanization of 
the parental B -Ly1 mouse antibody and subsequent glycoengineering leading to the 
following characteristics (Beers et al. 2010; M össner et al . 2010): high antibody -
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC); high affinity binding to the CD20 antigen; 
low  complement -dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) activity; and antibody dependent 
cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) through recruitment of Fc γRIII positive immune 
effector cells such as natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages and monocytes; and high direct cell death induction. Given the direct cell death inducing properties of 
obinutuzumab and the significantly enhanced ADCC in preclinical assays, it is 
possible that obinutuzumab may have greater efficacy than the w idely used anti -
CD20 -mAb rituximab (Rituxan
).  
Clinical Experience with Obinutuzumab  
Clinical data on  obinutuzumab are available  from four Phase I or II studies (Studies BO20999,  
BO21003, BO21000, and JO21900) and two Phase III s tudies (Studies GA O4753g and 
BO21004/ CLL -11). Result s from the ongoing studie s are described be lo w.  For the most up-
to-date information on obinutuzumab, please refer to the current version of the Investigator ’s 
Brochure.  
 
Tolerability and Efficacy of Obinutuzumab in NHL  
Study BO20999 ( GAUGUIN ; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) (Phase I)  
BO20999 w as an open- label, multicenter, Phase I/ II study to explore obinutuzumab 
safety and activity in relapsed/ refractory NHL and CLL. Patients have received 
obinutuzumab at doses w ith a range of 400 −2000 mg (given  as a flat dose) across 
four cohorts (Morschhauser  et al. 2009).  There were no dose -limiting toxicities 
(DLTs) and no requirement for dose reductions.  Infusion -related reactions (IRRs) 
occurred in all CLL patients and w ere characterized predominantly by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (NCI -CTC) Grade 1 −2 toxicities:  
chills,  nausea, vomiting,  fever, pyrexia, hypertension, hypotension, dyspnea, and 
dizziness.  Tw o patients experienced four NCI -CTC Grade 3 toxicities:  sweats, 
flushing, asthenia, and hepatic  cytolysis .  
Although the safety profile appears otherw ise similar betw een NHL and CLL, there w as 
an increase in NCI -CTC v3.0 Grade 3−4 neutropenia noted in CLL patients, w hich 
w ere observed in 9 patients across the four dose levels administered.  Five patients experienced NCI -CTC Grade 4 neutropenia and 4 patients experienced NCI -CTC 
Grade 3 neutropenia as the maximum severity.  Of the  9 patients, 7 had 
one NCI-CTC Grade 3−4 event and 2 patients experienced more than one event.  
Granulocyte colony -stimulating factor (G -CSF) support w as administered to 6 of the 
9 patients, and these patients responded quickly to G -CSF support.  For  the 
3 patients who did not receive G- CSF, neutrophil counts normalized spontaneously.  
Furthermore, it is important to note that these neutropenia  events  did not appear to 
be accompanied by a higher incidence of infections.  No deaths w ere reported in Phase I of this study for CLL .

 18 As assessed by the International Workshop on CLL (IWCLL) criteria, the 
end-of-treatment response rate w ith obinutuzumab monotherapy w as 62%  
(8 of 13 patients with partial response [PR]) (Morschhauser  et al. 2009).  
Study BO20999 ( GAUGUIN ; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) (Phase II)  
T we n t y patients w ith relapsed/refractory  CLL have received 1000 mg of 
obinutuzumab.  The most commonly reported adverse  event (AE) during the 
treatment period w as IRR, reported in 19 (95% ) of 20 patients.  Fifteen patients 
experienced Grade 3 −4 AEs of whom 14 patients had treatment -related Grade 3 −4 
AEs (investigator assessment).  Treatment -related Grade 3−4 AEs were IRR 
(6 patients), neutropenia (4 patients), lymphopenia (2 patients), thrombocytopenia (2 
patients), and anemia, pure red cell a plasia, pancytopenia, febrile neutropenia, herpes 
zoster, and interstitial lung disease (1  patient each).  Eleven serious adverse events 
(SAEs) in 9 patients w ere reported during treatment, 9 of w hich w ere assessed by the 
investigator as related to obinutuzumab:  IRR (4 patients) and febrile  neutropenia, 
pancytopenia, pure red cell aplasia, interstitial lung disease and pyrexia (1 patient 
each).  Three patients w ithdrew  from further study treatment after the first infusion due to IRR.  One death has been reported during follow -up from colon cancer.  The 
most common AE in follow -up w as nasopharyngitis, reported in 2 patients.  End -of-
treatment response assessment show ed that four patients (20% ) achieved a clinical response, w ith a best overall response rate ( ORR) of 25%  in evaluable patients ( Salles  
et al. 2011).  
Study BO21003 ( GAUSS ; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) (Phase I)

Overall,  the rate of adverse events was simila r be t we e n the high-dose and low-  dose 
arms . The most commo n AE i n both groups  was IRRs,  most ly  during cycle  1. The  rate 
of IRRs  wa s  64%  of  patient s in the G-CHO P arm and 79% of patients  in the  G-FC arm;  
7% of IRR event s we re Grad e 3 or 4 event s in both chemotherapy  arms.  There w ere 
fe wer dose delays , dose reductions , and neutropeni a in the G-CHO P versu s the G -FC 
cohorts.  Grad e 3/4 neutropenia wa s seen in 39%  o f the G- CHO P patient s and 50% of 
the G- FC patients . In the G-CHOP arm 6%  of cycles w ere delayed  due to neutropenia 
or in fection and the dose of any CHOP component was reduced in 29%  of patients. In 
the G -FC arm , 10%  of cycles were delayed due to neutropen ia or infection with dose 
reductions in 36%  of patients. Three deaths were  reported following G -FC induction 
treatment (progressi ve disease, n=1;  underlying Parkinson’s disease, n=1; and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease during maintenance,  n=1) with none considered to be 
treatment -related.  
 
The overall response rate (ORR) at the end of induction was 96%  in the G - CH OP group (39%  
CR) and 93%  in the G -FC gro up (50%  CR). Data from the G - CHOP  cohort were compared in a 
mat ched -pair analysis to the rituximab plus CHOP (R -  CHOP) arm from study M39022 
(EORTC  20981) in a similar patient popula tion. Respons e rates to G -CHOP compared 
favorably to response rates to R -CHOP.

Overview of Safety of Obinutuzumab  
Obinutuzumab has been administered to approximately 1310 patients w ith 
CD20 -positive malignancies.  Both in patients w ith NHL and w ith CLL, IRR w as the 
most common AE in clinical trials conducted to date.  They w ere predominantly 
associated w ith the first infusion, generally occurring early during the infusion,

Obinutuzumab  + lenalidomide in untreated FL MDACC  Protocol 2015- 0464 Version 11 
 20 shortly after, or in some cases up to 24 hours after the completion of the infusion 
w ith obinutuzumab.  The incidence and intensity of IRRs decreased w ith subsequent infusions of obinutuzumab.  In a few  patients, concurrent signs of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) w ere observed.  Other frequently observed AEs include infections 
and neutropenia.  These events appeared to be more common in patients w ith CLL compared to NHL.  
In trials investigating the combination of obinutuzumab and CHOP, FC, chlorambucil 
or bendamustine, the incidence of AEs in the treatment arms w ith combined use w as consistent w ith the know n safety profiles of the individual study drugs.  So far, no maximum tolerated dose, no dose -limiting toxicities, and no clear dose -related 
trends in the incidence of AEs have been determined.  
A pooled analysis of safety data for obinutuzumab collected during the monotherapy 
studies BO20999 and BO21003 was conducted in patients with NHL (aggressive [aNHL] and indolent []iNHL]) or CLL w ho participated in those tw o studies (both Phase I and Phase II) and received monotherapy treatment w ith obinutuzumab and included a total 205 patients w ith NHL (49 aNHL and 156 iNHL patients) and 38 patients w ith CLL.  
In the group of 38 patients w ith CLL  treated with obinutuzumab monotherapy , the 
majority of patients (25 [66% ]) w ere treated for ≥
  4 w eeks to <   6 months.  Eleven 
patients (29% ) w ere exposed for 6 to  < 12 months, and tw o patients (5% ) w ere 
exposed for 12 months or longer.  Eight of 38 patients (21% ) w ith CLL w ere w ithdraw n during the treatment phase; 4 patients (11% ) w ere w ithdraw n due to AEs, w hich indicates that AEs w ere mostly manageable.  Almost all patients (37/ 38 [97% ]) experienced an IRR.  The number of patients w ith Grade 3−4 IRRs was 11/ 38 (29% ).  
As is typical for patients w ith CLL, blood and lymphatic system disorders w ere 
among the most frequently reported AEs, in particular neutropenia (13/ 38  patients 
[34% ]), febrile neutropenia (5/ 38 patients [13% ]), and thrombocytopenia (7/ 38 
patients [18% ]).  
Infections and infestations w ere common AEs, occurring in 21/ 38 patients (55% ).  
Infections reported in more than one patient w ere nasopharyngitis (6 patients), bronchitis and sinusitis (4 patients each), influenza and lung infection (3 patients 
each), and herpes zoster and oral herpes (2 patients each).  
Thirteen patients (34% ) died, 8 of these due to disease progression.  One patient died 
from an unspecified cause after w ithdraw al from the study for lack of response.  This 
patient  had received subsequent experimental therapies and had stable CLL at the 
time she died.  For 4 additional patients, the cause of death w as reported as colon cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, metastasis, and septic shock, and all w ere considered not to be related to treatment.  
In the tw o studies investigating obinutuzumab as monotherapy, BO20999 and 
BO21003, patients w ith CLL appeared to be at a higher risk of experiencing an AE of special interest than patients w ith NHL.  The largest difference in the incidences w as seen for neutropenia (occurring in 47%  of patients w ith CLL [18/ 38] vs. 8%  of 
patients w ith aNHL [4/ 49] and 8%  of patients w ith iNHL [13/ 156]) and treatment -
related AEs associated w ith the infusion (100%  [38/ 38] vs. 80%  (39/ 49) and 83%  
[129/ 156]).  
To date, a very small number of patients have experienced TLS (six in total); four 
patients in the aNHL population (population including MCL) and one patient each in the CLL and iNHL populations.  
Infections have been reported in 20/ 49 aNHL patients (41% ), 74/ 156 iNHL patients 
(47% ), and 21/ 38 CLL patients (55% ).  One iNHL patient was withdrawn from the

 21 study because of an infection.  In addition, one CLL patient and one iNHL patient 
died from an infection (septic shock in both cases) during survival follow -up 671 days 
and 494 days after last dose of treatment, respectively.  
Three CLL and 3 iNHL patients w ere w ithdraw n from treatment due to an AE of 
special interest, all for IRRs.  An additional patient in the iNHL group discontinued treatment because of an infection.  This indicates that these events w ere generally manageable.  
Risks Associated with Obinutuzumab Therapy  
Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation  
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, 
hepatic failure , and death, can occur in patients treated w ith anti -CD20 antibodies 
such as obinutuzumab.  HBV reactivation has been reported in patients who are 
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive and also in patients w ho are HBsAg negative but are hepatitis B core antibody (anti -HBc) positive.  Reactivation has 
also occurred in patients w ho appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection (i.e., HBsAg negative, anti -HBc positive, and hepatitis B surface antibody [anti -HBs] 
positive).  HBV reactivation is defined as an abrupt increase in HBV replication 
manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA level or detection of HBsAg in a 
person w ho w as previously HBsAg negative and anti -HBc positive.  Reactivation of 
HBV replication is often followed by hepatitis, i.e., increase in transaminase levels and, in severe cases, increase in bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death.  
Screen all patients for HBV infection by measuring HBsAg and anti -HBc before 
initiating treatment w ith obinutuzumab. For patients w ho show  evidence of hepatitis B infection (HBsAg positive [regardless of antibody status] or HBsAg negative but 
anti-HBc positive), consult physicians w ith expertise in managing hepatitis B 
regarding monitoring, and consider  HBV antiviral therapy.  
Monitor patients with evidence of current or prior HBV infection for clinical and 
laboratory signs of hepatitis or HBV reactivation during and for several months 
follow ing treatment w ith obinutuzumab.  HBV reactivation has been reported for 
other CD20- directed cytolytic antibodies follow ing completion of therapy.  
In patients w ho develop reactivation of HBV w hile receiving obinutuzumab, immediately 
discontinue obinutuzumab and any concomitant chemotherapy, and institute appropriate treatment.  Resumption of obinutuzumab in patients w hose HBV 
reactivation resolves should be discussed w ith physicians w ith expertise in managing hepatitis B.  Insufficient data exist regarding the safety of resuming obinutuzumab in 
patients who develop HBV reactivation.  
Progressive Multifocal L eukoencephalopathy  
JC virus infection resulting in  progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), w hich 
can be  fat al,  wa s observed in patients treated  w ith obinutuzumab.  Consider  the 
diagnosis of PML in any patient presenting w ith new  onset or changes to pre -
existing neurologic manifestations.  Evaluation of PML includes , but is not limited to , 
consultation w ith a neurologist, brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI), and lumbar 
puncture.  Discontinue obinutuzumab  therapy  and consider discontinuation or 
reduction of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy in patients who develop PML.

 22 Infusion -Related Reactions  
Obinutuzumab can cause severe and life -threatening IRRs .  T wo-thirds of patients 
experienced a reaction to the first 1000 mg of obinutuzumab infusion.  IRRs  can also 
occur w ith subsequent infusions.  Symptoms may include hypotension, tachycardia, 
dyspnea, and respiratory symptoms (e.g., bronchospasm, larynx and throat irritation, 
w heezing, and laryngeal edema).  Other common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, hypertension, flushing, headache, pyrexia, and chills.  
Pre-medicate patients w ith acetaminophen, antihistamine , and a glucocorticoid .  
Institute medical management (e.g., glucocorticoids, epinephrine, bronchodilators, and/ or oxygen) for IRRs  as needed.  Closely monitor patients during the entire 
infusion.  IRRs  w ithin 24 hours of receiving obinutuzumab have occurred.  
For patients w ith any Grade 4 IRRs , including but not limited to anaphylaxis, acute 
life-threatening respiratory symptoms, or other lif e-threatening infusion reaction, 
stop the obinutuzumab infusion.  Permanently discontinue obinutuzumab therapy.  
For patients w ith Gra de 1, 2 , or 3 IRRs , interrupt obinutuzumab for Grade 3 reactions 
until resolution of symptoms.   Interrupt or reduce the rate of the infusion for Grade 
1 or 2 reactions and manage symptoms.  
For patients w ith pre -existing cardiac or pulmonary conditions, monitor more 
frequently throughout the infusion and the  post-infusion period because  these 
patients  may be at greater risk of experiencing more severe reactions.  Hypotension 
may occur as part of the obinutuzumab IRR.  Consider w ithholding antihypertensive 
treatments for 12 hours prior to, during, and for the first hour after administration of 
each obinutuzumab infusion until blood pressure is stable.  For patients at increased 
risk of hypertensive crisis, consider the benefits versus the risks of w ithholding their hypertensive medication as is suggested here.  
Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
Acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia,  and/ or 
hyperphosphatemia from TLS can occur w ithin 12  − 24 hours after the first infusion.  
Patients w ith high tumor burden and/ or high circulating lymphocyte count 
( > 25 × 109/L) are at greater risk for TLS and should receive appropriate tumor lysis 
prophylaxis with anti -hyperuricemics (e.g., allopurinol) and hydration beginning 
12 − 24 hours prior to the infusion of obinutuzumab.  For treatment of TLS, correct 
electrolyte abnorm alities, monitor renal function  and fluid balance, and administer 
supportive care, including dialysis as indicated.  
Infection  
Serious bacterial, fungal, and new  or reactivated viral infections can occur during and 
follow ing obinutuzumab therapy.  Do not administer obinutuzumab to patients with 
an active infection.  Patients w ith a history of recurring or chronic infections may be 
at increased risk of infection.  
Neutropenia  
Obinutuzumab in combination w ith chlorambucil caused Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in 
34%  of patients in clinical trials .  Patients w ith Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia should be 
monitored frequently w ith regular laboratory tests until resolution.  Anticipate, 
evaluate, and treat any symptoms or signs of developing infection.  Neutropenia can

 23 also be of late onset (occurring more than 28 days after completion of treatment) 
and/ or prolonged (lasting longer than 28 days).  
Patients w ith neutropenia are strongly recommended to receive antimicrobial 
prophylaxis throughout the treatment period.  Antiviral and antifungal prophylaxis 
should be considered.  
Thrombocytopenia  
Obinutuzumab in combination w ith chlorambucil caused Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia 
in 12%  of patients in clinical trials .  In 5%  of patients, obinutuzumab caused an acute 
thrombocytopenia occurring w ithin 24 hours after the obinutuzumab infusion.  In 
patients w ith Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, monitor platelet counts more frequently until resolution.  Transfusion of blood products (i.e., platelet transfusion) 
may be necessary.
 
Summary of Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Data for Obinutuzumab  
A t wo -compartment model comprising a time -varying clearance pathw ay and a linear 
clearance pathw ay provides an adequate description of the pharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab following intravenous (IV) administration in Studies  BO20999 and 
BO21003.  Follow ing the infusion of obinutuzumab , the elimination appears to be 
characterized by a clearance pathw ay that is dependent on time (i.e., starting at a typical value of 630 mL/ day and then gradually decreasing to an asymptote of 60 mL/ day at steady state) and a linear clearance pathw ay.  Tumor burden may 
potentially contribute significantly to the clearance of obinutuzumab, especially at the beginning of treatment w hen CD20 -positive tumor cells are most abundant.  
As tumor burden decreases, the clearance reaches an asymptote, w hich is believed 
to be primarily a function of the proteolytic  metabolic clearance.  Consequently, 
some  patients w ith a high tumor burden may appear to clear the drug from the 
plasma faster than do patients w ith a low  tumor burden because obinutuzumab binds 
to the CD20 -positive tumor cells and is effectively removed from the plasma.  
Therefore, the clearance of the drug w ill vary w ith time, since repeated treatments wit h  obinutuzumab will reduce the quantity of CD20 -positive tumor cells.  
Consequently, the number of obinutuzumab administrations during the first cycle of treatment may be expected to reduce the number of CD20- positive tumor cells, thus 
minimizing the impact of the time varying clearance pathw ay on obinutuzumab exposure.  
Treatment w ith obinutuzumab resulted in extensive B -cell depletion, with all patients 
show ing a reduction in cell count to absolute zero at some stage of their treatment cycle.  Overall, there has been no notable increase in complement levels before and after infusion, but changes have been observed in the levels of interleukin (IL) -6 and 
IL-8 before and after infusion.

Lenalidomide Description 
 
The che mical na m e is 3- (4- am ino- 1- oxo  1,3- dihydro  - 2 H- isoindol - 2- yl) piperidine - 2,6- dione  
. The em pirical form ula for lenalido m ide is C 13H13N3O3, and  the gram  m olecular weight  is 
259.3.  
 Lenalidomide  is off- white  to pale - yellow  solid powder. It  is soluble  in organic solvent/water  
m ixtures, and  buffered  aqueous  solvents.  Lenalidomide  is more  soluble  in organic  solvents  and  
low pH solutions.  Solubility  was significantly  lower  in less acidic buffers,  ranging  from  about  0.4 
to 0.5 m g/ m l. Lenalido m ide has an  asym m etric carbon atom  and  can  exist as the opti cally active form s S( - ) and  R(+),  and  is produced  as a race m ic m ixture with a net optical rotation of 
zero. 
 
Lenalidomide  is available  in 2.5mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 15mg, 20mg, and 25mg capsules  for oral 
ad m inistration. Each  capsule  contains  lenalido m ide as the  active  ingredient and  the following  inac tive ingredients:  lactose  anhydrous, m icrocrystalline cellulose, croscar mellose  sodium,  and  
m agnesium  stearate.

Multiple dosing at the recommended dose - regimen does not result in drug accumulation. 
Pharmacokinetic sampling in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients was not performed. In 
multiple myeloma patients maximum plasma concentrations occurred between 0.5 and 4.0 
hours post - dose both on Days 1 and 28. AUC and Cmax values increase proportionally with 
dose following single and multiple doses. Exposure (AUC) in multiple myeloma patients is 57% 
higher than in healthy male volunteers.

Aggressive NHL  
Witzig et al reported the Phase II results of lenalidomide monotherapy in patients with 
relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL. Lenalidomide (25 mg/ d) was administered on days 1 to 21 of a 28 -day cycle and continued as tolerated or until disease progression. (Witzig et al 
2011) Patients with various aggressive  
histologic subtypes (including diffuse large B -cell, grade 3 follicular lymphoma, mantle cell, 
and transformed NHL) were enrolled. 277 patients were enrolled, the ORR was 35% . Clinical 
responses were observed in all lymphoma subtypes. Median PFS was 3.7 months. The most 
common adverse event was myelosuppresion with grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in 17 and 6% , respectively. A multicenter clinical trial has been completed investigating clinical efficacy of single agent lenalidomide vs. investigator ’s choice in patients w ith 
relapsed/ refractory DLBCL and preliminary findings suggest clinically activity of lenalidomide in relapsed/ refractory DLBCL with more pronounced efficacy in ABC DLBCL. (Czucman et al. 2014)

Lenalidomide plus  Rituximab  in Indolent  Lymphoma 
At MD Anderson,  we conducted a phase  II, single arm study with a combinatio n of 
lenalidomid e and rituxima b in patients wit h untreate d indolen t NHL . (Fowler et al. 2014) 
Patient s receiv e lenalido mide 20 mg/ da y on days 1- 21 of each 28 day cycle . Rituxima b wa s 
given at 375 mg/ m2 on day 1 of each cycle. W e reporte d high overal l respons e rates , with a 
complet e respons e rate of 87% in patient s with follicular lymphoma . Toxicit y has been mild to 
moderate , with the most common non- hematologi c advers e even t reporte d as grad e 1-2 
fat igu e and rash. Hematologic toxicity included 35%  ≥grade 3 neutropenia and 4%  with 
≥grade 3 thrombocytopenia. These results w ere validated by a recently reported Phase II 
cooperative group study of lenalidomide and rituximab in untreated indolent NHL, 
demonstrating similar response rates and toxicity.  (Martin P, et al ASH 2013).   
 
Study Rationale  
Obinutuzumab Plus Lenalidomide in Untreated Follicular Lymphoma  
We hypothesiz e that the high clinica l response s noted in indolent lymphoma patient s 
followin g lenalido mide and rit uxima b is relate d to the combination’s abilit y to augmen t the 
immun e response , and subsequen t ADC C through alteration o f immun e cell subset s in the 
tumor and peripheral blood. Lenalidomide has been show n to activat e NK cells, T cells, or 
both and leads to expansio n of immun e effec tor cells in-vivo in NHL and CLL models . In 
preclinica l models , we have also show n the synergistic  anti-tumor  effect  of  combining 
lenalidomid e with anti-CD2 0 molecules.  
 
As noted a
bove , obinutuzuma b is a new , humanize d anti-CD2 0 monoclonal antibody which 
binds to a unique type II epitope on the cell surface. Obinutuzumab has demonstrat ed 
increased  affinit y  to the FCgRIIIa  receptor,  and may have increase d ADC C when compare d 
to rit uxima b. Preliminar y 
studies also sugges t the obinutuzuma b is effectiv e in patient s with relap sed/ refractory 
indolen t lymphoma . (Salle s et al 2011)  
 Combinin g an anti-CD2 0 antibody with increase d affinit y for the FCgRIIIa
 recepto r with an 
immunomodulator y agen t that increases ADC C is rationa l and ha s the potentia l to build 
upon the anti-lymphom a characteristic s of both agents. Bot h agent s are we ll tolerated , and 
the expecte d toxicit y profil e is mild.  
 
The startin g dose of lenalidomid e is based upon the initial dose findin g study by Wan g et 
al., which determined the maximu m tolerate d dose of lenalidomid e with rituxima b was 
20mg daily in relapsed NHL.   This dose was also shown to be safe in a recently

 27 presented phase I study of obinutuzumab and lenalidomide in relapsed NHL. 
(Morschhauser F, et al ASH 2014) In addition, we are conducting a Phase I/II study of 
obinutuzumab and lenalidomide in relapsed/refractory indolent NHL ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
No DLTs were observed in the Phase I dose escalation portion of the study and the 
Phase II cohort is currently enrolling with obinutuzumab dosed at 1000mg and 
lenalidomide at 20mg.  
Novel Endpoints  
With the prolonged natural history of follicular lymphoma, identifying optimal endpoints or 
surrogates for overall survival for frontline studies is an evolving field. In an analysis of the 
National LymphoCare Study, previously untreated patients with FL who experienced 
progressive disease w ithin 2 years of initial treatment w ere identified as a high risk group, “early progressors ”. Early progression was dramatically associated with inferior overall 
survival, 5 year OS estimates of 50%  versus 90%  in the reference group. (Casulo et al. JCO 
2015) After adjusting for FLIPI score, early progression was associated with an increased risk 
of death (hazard ratio [HR] =6.44 (95%  confidence interval [CI] 4.33- 9.58). This suggests that 
a landmark progression- free survival at 2 years may predict for a high risk population and 
discern a difference in survival outcomes. Another proposed efficacy endpoint includes the 
complete response rate at 30 months w hich has been shown to correlate with PFS in follicular 
lymphoma (Sargent et al, ASCO 2015). Both approaches serve as surrogate endpoints for overall survival.  
 
We are proposing a novel frontline, open -label, Phase II clinical trial for previously 
untreated patients w ith follicular lymphoma, a non -cytotoxic approach based on 
sound scientific rationale w ith emerging clinical endpoints. We are proposing the 
next generation of immune therapy w ith obinutuzumab in combination w ith lenalidomide to enhance ADCC and direct cell death to improve outcomes for our patients w ith an anticipated acceptable toxicity profile.  We aim to explore the 
efficacy and safety of the novel combination of obinutuzumab and lenalidomide in 
previously untreated patients w ith follicular lymphoma to influence practice patterns.

Study Design 
Description of the Study  
This is a single center, Phase II, open label study designed to assess the e fficacy and safet y of 
obinutuzumab combined w ith lenalidomide in previ ously untreated subjects with follicular 
lymphoma . The study will include approximately 90 subjects in one treatment arm.  
 
Once a patient provides w ritten informed consent, the patient may enter the screening period, 
w hich is permitted to last up to 4 w eeks. During the screening period, the patient w ill undergo 
safety and other assessments to determine eligibility for the study. The patient eligibility will be based on investigator assessment. The patient w ill enter the treatment period once the patient has fulfilled the required assessment in the screening period. The treatment period for each patients starts w ith study day 1 of cycle 1. The treatments w ill be  given as described in Section 
5. The patients will receive protocol- specified treatments, until:  
 
1) Failure to achieve at least a partial response after 6 cycles of therapy  
2) Relapse or progression of disease  
3) Withdraw al of consent,  
4) Unacceptable toxicity, or  
5) End of study.  
 
Upon completion of the required treatments, the patient w ill enter the follow -up period. During 
the follow -up period, patients w ill be follow ed for disease progression, next lymphoma 
treatment, and OS.

 36 Obinutuzumab  
Obinutuzumab is provided as a single dose, sterile liquid formulation in 50 mL pharmaceutical 
grade glass vials containing a nominal 1000 mg of obinutuzumab. The formulated drug product 
consists of 25 mg/ mL drug substance (G3 material) formulated in histidine, trehalose, and poloxamer 188.  The vials contain 41 mL (with 2.5%  overfill).  Obinutuzumab w ill be supplied to research subjects by Genentech for the duration of this trial at no charge to participants or 
their insurance providers.  
 
Obinutuzumab drug product intended for IV infusion is prepared by dilution of the drug product into an infusion bag containing 0.9%  NaCl to the final drug concentration of 4 mg/ mL. 
Using a 250- mL infusion bag containing 0.9%  NaCl, withdraw and discard 40 mL of the NaCl. 
Withdraw 40 mL of obinutuzumab from a single glass vial and inject into the infusion bag 
(discard any unused portion of obinutuzumab left in the vial). Gently invert the infusion bag to mix the solution; do not shake.  
 Do not use obinutuzumab beyond the expiration date stamped on the carton.  
 
Obinutuzumab Administration  
Obinutuzumab 1000mg will be given as outlined in Section 5.2. 
 
First Infusio n of obi nutuzumab:  
 
Thirt y to 60 minute s prior to all obinutuzumab infusions,  the following pre -  medicatio ns will be 
given (unles s contraindi cated):  
 
• Oral acetaminophe n (1000 mg ) AND  
 
• An antihis tamin e such as diphenhydramine (50−100 mg)  
 
• For Cycle 1, day 1  prophylacti c corticosteroi ds (e.g., 20 m g IV dexamethasone ) 
at least one hour prior to the obinutuzuma b infusion. An equivalent dose of  
methylpredni solone (80mg) is acceptabl e but hydrocortisone shoul d not be used.  
 
 
Obinutuzumab will be administered at an initial rate of 12.5mL/ hr (50mg/ hr) for 60 minutes, 
and then the infusion rate may be escalated by 12.5mL/ hr increments every 30 minutes to a maximum of 100mL/ hr as tolerated. If hypersensitivity or an infusion reaction develops, the infusion should be interrupted until symptoms resolve or improve, see Section 6.4, Table 4. For management of infusion reaction, please refer to the institution’s hypersensitivity reaction 
order sheet. The infusion can continue at one -half the previous rate upon improvement in 
symptoms, and the escalation of 12.5mL/ hr increments every 30 minutes resumes to a 
maximum rate of 100mL/ hr.

 37 After the end of the first infusion, the IV line or central venous catheter should remain in place 
for ≥ 1 hour to be able to administer IV drugs if necessary. If  no adverse events occur after 1 
hour, the IV line may be removed or the central venous catheter may be de accessed.  
 
Subsequent infusions of obinutuzumab:  
 
Thirty to 60 minutes prior to all obinutuzumab infusions, the following pre -  medications will be 
given (unless contraindicated):  
 
• Oral acetaminophen (1000  mg) AND  
 • An antihistamine such as diphenhydramine (50− 100 mg)  
In subsequent cycles, steroids (dexamethasone 20mg IV 30- 60 minutes before obinutuzumab) 
should be given to patients who experienced a severe IRR ( ≥ grade 3) with the prior infusion of 
obinutuzumab or who are thought to be at high risk for infusion- related reactions, as assessed 
by the investigator.  
 If subjects tolerated the previous infusion well, the subsequent infusions can start at an initial 
rate of 25mL/ hr and increase by 25mL/ hr increments every 30 minutes to a maximum of 
100mL/ hr as tolerated. If subjects did not tolerate the first infusion well, follow the guidelines for the first infusion.  
 
If hypersensitivity or an infusion reaction develops, the infusion should be interrupted until 
symptoms resolve or improve, see Table 4. For management of infusion reaction, please refer to the institution ’s hypersensitivity reaction order set. The infusion can continue at one -half 
the previous rate upon improvement in symptoms, and the escalation of 25mL/ hr increments every 30 minutes resumes to a maximum rate of 100mL/ hr.  
 
For subsequent infusions, the IV line or central venous catheter should remain in place 
for at least 1 hour after the end of the infusion. If no adverse events occur after 1 
hour, the IV line may be removed or the central venous catheter may be de 
accessed.  
Obinutuzumab Storage 
The recommended storage conditions for the obinutuzumab drug product are betw een 
2°C and 8° C, protected from light.  Chemical and physical in- use stability for 
obinutuzumab dilutions in 0.9%  sodium chloride (NaCl) at concentrations of 0.2
 − 20 mg/ mL have been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2° C − 8°C and an additional 
24 hours at ambient temperature and ambient room lighting.  The prepared diluted 
product should generally be used immediately.  If not used immediately,  the infusion 
should be stored under refrigerated conditions due to microbiology stability and should not  be longer than 24 hours at 2° C
 − 8°C unless reconstitution/ dilution has 
taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.  Obinutuzumab should not be frozen or shaken.  Mix gently.  All transfer procedures require strict adherence to aseptic techniques.

Lenalidomide  
Lenalidomide (Revlimid ®) will be provided to research subjects for the duration of their 
participation in this trial at no charge to them or their insurance providers.  Lenalidomide will be provided in accordance with the Celgene Corporation’s Revlimid REMS ® program.  Per 
standard Revlimid REMS ® program requirements,  all physicians who prescribe lenalidomide 
for research subjects enrolled into this trial, and all research subjects enrolled into this trial, 
must be registered in, and must comply with, all requirements of the Revlimid REMS ® 
program.  
 
Further information about the Revlimid REMS ® program is available at 
www.celgeneriskmanagement.com. 
 
Drug will be shipped on a per patient basis by the contract pharmacy to the clinic site for IND studies. Only enough lenalidomide for one cycle of therapy will be supplied to the patient each cycle.  
 
Lenalidomide administration  
Patients w ith creatinine clearance (CrCl) >60 mL/ min as determined by modified 
Crockcroft - Gault (see Appendix  2) will receive a total of 18 cycles  as outlined in 
Section 5.2. 
Lenalidomide Dose Adjustment for Renal Impairment  
 
Subjects with renal impairment (CrCl ≤ 60 ml/ min) will be dosed based on Table 1.  CrCL 
assessment will occur on: Day 1, 8, and 15 for cycle 1 and Day 1 of cycles 2 -18. How ever, if  a 
subject has a creatinine obtained at any time during the administration of lenalidomide on study because it was clinically indicated, a dose reduction based on CrCL and Table 1 should 
be performed.  
 Subjects with moderate renal impairment, CrCL of 30- 60mL/ min, will initiate 10mg of 
lenalidomide daily on days 1- 21 of a 28 day cycle.  Subjects with severe renal impairment, 
CrCL of <30 mL/ min, will initiate 15mg of lenalidomide every 48 hours on da ys 1-21 of a 28 
day cycle.  
 For subjects with renal impairment (CrCl ≤  60 ml/ min) necessitating dose adjustment on Day 1 
of a cycle according to Table 1, but then stably improves, a dose increase based on CrCL will 
not occur until day 1 of the next cycle.  At any point, should a patient require dose reduction 
due to reduced CrCl, and the CrCl then stably improves, dose escalation will not occur until 
day 1 of the next cycle.

Dose Reduction, Delay and Discontinuation  
Toxicity necessitating dose modification or delay is based on NCI CTCAE v 4.03 Toxicity 
Grade. The Principal Investigator will assess whether each AE is related or not to each of the 
study drugs. Events that are judged definitely, probably or possibly related are considered related AEs. Events that are considered unlikely or definitely not related are considered not related AEs. Factors to be taken into consideration include the temporal relationship between administration of study drug and the onset of the AE, other potential causes of the AE 
including the subject ’s underlying medical condition and concomitant medications, whether the 
AE is consistent with known AEs previously attributed to a study drug, whether the AE 
decreases or resolves upon withholding or reducing the dose of the study drug, or whether the AE recurs upon reintroduction of the study drug. AEs defined below (Sections 5.4.1), unless 
the Principal Investigator considers the event clearly unrelated to study drug, will be 
considered a toxicity that necessitates dose modification or delay.  
 
Toxicities Necessitating Dose Modification or Delay  
Toxicities necessitating dose modification or delay will be defined as any non -hematologic or 
hematologic toxicity listed below. Study treatment should be discontinued in the event of a toxicity lasting more than 28 days despite appropriate medical management, unless reviewed 
and approved by the Principal Investigator. The action in Table 2 should be taken for the 
following toxicities:  
 
Non-hematologic toxicity  w
 ill be defined as any of the following:  
 • Any unmanageable Grade 3 or 4 non- hematologic toxicity with failure to improve (< 
Grade 2) or recover to baseline within 14 days of withholding drug  
• Grade 3 non -blistering rash that does not resolve to < Grade 2 within 14 days  
• Any desquamating (blistering) or grade 4 rash  
• Any grade Stevens -Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis  
• Grade 3 or 4 thrombosis/ embolism  
• Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy which began or worsened while on study  
 
Hematologic toxicity  wi
 ll be defined as any of the following:  
 • Grade 3 neutropenia with infection or fever (single temperature of > 38.3 º C, or with a 
sustained temperature of ≥ 38 º C lasting > 1 hour).  
• Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC<500/ µL) lasting > 7 days.  
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (<25,000/ µL)

Lenalidomide Dose Reduction or Delay  
The lenalidomide dose should be held for any unmanageable toxicity that is consistent with the 
rules outlined in Table 2.  
 The dose of lenalidomide may be reduced successively by one level from starting dose, Table 3. Once a patient ’s dose has been reduced, no dose re -escalation is permitted. Patients who 
cannot tolerate the lowest applicable dose level are to be discontinued from the Treatment 
Phase. Dose modification should also meet the specifications outlined for those subjects with 
renal insufficiency as outlined in Table 1. If patients with renal impairment are currently receiving 10mg every 24 hours and need a dose modification, they will then be dose reduced to 15mg every 48 hours. If they need further dose reduction due to toxicity, they will be discontinued due to being unable to tolerate the lowest applicable dose. Similarly, patients 
starting at 15mg every 48 hours who need further dose reduction will be discontinued due to 
being unable to tolerate the lowest applicable dose.

Overdose Instruction  
Overdose, as defined for this protocol, refers to obinutuzumab and lenalidomide dosing only.    On a per dose basis, an overdose is defined as the following amount over the protocol -
specified dose of obinutuzumab and lenalidomide assigned to a given patient, regardless of any associated adverse events or sequelae.  
PO any amount over the protocol -specified dose  
IV 10%  over the protocol -specified dose

On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as anything more frequent than the 
protocol required schedule or frequency.   
 On an infusion rate basis, an overdose is defined as any rate faster than the protocol -specified 
rate.  Complete data about drug administration, including any overdose, regardless of whether 
the overdose was accidental or intentional, should be reported in the case report form  
 
 
Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Investigators are encouraged to keep a subject who is experiencing a clinical benefit on study unless significant toxicity puts the subject at risk or routine noncompliance puts the study outcomes at risk. If a subject meets any of the following criteria, then withdrawal from the study treatment is mandatory:  
 
• Subject has failed to achieve a t least a partial response (PR) aft er 6 cycles  of therapy . 
Subjects with earlier evidence of nonresponse that warrants change in therapy in the opinion of the treating physician will discontinue study drug  at any time . 
• Subject has  confirmed progressive disease (PD)  
• Subject has an intercurrent illness or AE that prevents further treatment administration beyond 28 days  
• Subject decides to withdraw from study  
• Subject becomes pregnant  
• Subject is routinely noncompliant with study procedures and/ or scheduled evaluations  
• Subject requires a prohibited concomitant medication 
• Investigator considers withdrawal to be in the best interest of the subject.  
 A safety follow up visit is required for all subjects except those who have withdrawn full consent.  
 
 
Concomitant medications 
permitted supportive care 
Supportive medications (such as for emesis, diarrhea, constipation, etc.) should be delivered in 
accordance with standard practice. Use of neutrophil growth factors (granulocyte colony -
stimulating factor [G -CSF] such as filgrastim or pegfilgrastim) is permitted for management of 
neutropenia in accordance with the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines. Preemptive or prophylactic G -CSF during cycle 1 is not required, but can be used at the 
discretion of the investigator if the subject is felt to be of high risk according to the current ASCO guidelines.

 46 Transfusions may be given in accordance with institutional policy. Short courses of 
corticosteroids (<14 days) for treatment of non- lymphoma related medical reasons (e.g. rash, 
arthritis, asthma) or for tumor flare  reaction (TFR)  at doses that do not exceed 10mg per day 
of prednisone or equivalent are permitted.  However, if clinically indicated, higher doses of corticosteroids (>10mg per day) are permissible.  
 
Thromboembolism prophylaxis  
It is recommended that patients receive prophylactic aspirin (81mg) daily unless contraindicated. If aspirin is contraindicated, use of low molecular weight heparin or warfarin (or equivalent Vitamin K antagonist) to keep the international normalized ratio (INR) in the 
range of 2- 3, or use of other anti -thrombotic therapy according to hospital guidelines, or 
physician preference, is acceptable. However, the choice of anticoagulant for prophylaxis for 
VTE relies upon the investigator ’s discretion and should be tailored to the patient ’s individual 
risk/ benefit profile by taking into account the individual thrombotic risk (e.g., history of 
venous thrombosis), bleeding risk, and the quality of compliance with antithrombotic 
treatm ent.  In the setting of thrombocytopenia, thromboembolism prophylaxis should be held in 
accordance with the guidelines established in Table 2.   All patients who develop a deep venous thromboembolism in any location must be treated 
appropriately with low molecular weight heparin. Heparin should continue for at least 3 
months, however treating physician discretion is allowed. Study treatment is to continue during heparin use. For subjects in whom low molecular weight heparin is contraindicated (i.e., renal impairment), a vitamin K antagonist anti -coagulant can be used instead where medically 
appropriate.  
  
Tumor lysis prophylaxis 
Patients with high tumor burden or those considered to be high risk for tumor lysis by the 
investigator should receive TLS prophylaxis (allopurinol, rasburicase or equivalent as per 
institutional guidelines) during the first cycle of lenalidomide administration or as clinically indicated. To monitor for TLS, the patients will have chemistries drawn on Days 1, 8, and 15 of the first cycle and additionally as clinically indicated.  
 
Obinutuzumab pre -medication 
Premedication consisting of acetaminophen and an antihistamine should be administered before each obinutuzumab infusion as outlined in Section 5.3.1.1. Steroids (dexamethasone or prednisone) can also be administered as clinically indicated before obinutuzumab.  
 
Management  of infusion- relate d symptom s for obinutuzuma b is summar ized in  Table 4 
and in accordance w ith institution policy outlined in the hypersensitivity order set.

 55 CT, PET/CT, MRI scans  
A CT scan (with contrast unless contraindicated) of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis are 
required for disease assessment. A “ diagnostic quality ” combined PET/ CT with IV and PO (or 
water) contrast is an acceptable alternative to CT scans.  In addition, if independent CTs are performed, a PET can also be used to augment tumor assessment. In the case w here a CT w ith 
contrast is contraindicated, an alternative  would be an MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  
 
In general, follow -up assessments w ill be done by CT scans. PET -CT scan is encouraged and 
should be done at baseline and repeated to confirm complete remission and/ or at treatment 
discontinuation, unless the subject ’s insurance will not cover a PET as part of standard of 
care. In this situation, CTs are acceptable alternatives. For lymphomas that are not FDG -avid 
at screening, PET does not need to be repeated in subsequent assessments.  
 
Response Assessment  
Response assessment will be completed by the Principal Investigator using Cheson 2014 
Lugano Criteria. At screening, up to 6 target lesions will be selected and followed for the duration of the study. Information on extranodal involvement can also be recorded. The best ORR will be documented.  
 
Hematology 
Hematology studies must include a complete blood count (CBC) with differential. Coagulation studies performed at screening will include a PT and PTT.   
 
Serum Chemistry  
Chemistry must include electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate), blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, albumin, total protein, LDH, β 2-microglobulin), and uric acid.  
 
Coagulation Studies  
Coagulation studies performed at screening will include PT/ INR and activated PTT.  
 
Hepatitis Serologies  
Hepatitis serologies include Hepatitis C antibody, Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis B core antibody. For patients with a positive Hepatitis C antibody, Hepatitis C viral PCR should 
be performed to evaluate for active infection.  
 
HIV serologies 
HIV serologies include antibodies to HIV 1 and 2.

 56 Creatinine Clearance  
Determination of creatinine clearance using the modified Cockcroft -Gault estimate (utilizing 
actual body weight) should be calculated during the Screening phase and at the start of each 
cycle to determine dose of lenalidomide (Section 5.4.3).  
 
Pregnancy Test  
During  screening, two serum pregnancy tests will be required for women of childbearing 
potential. Females of childbearing potential are defined as: all females who are menstruating, amenorrheic from previous treatments, under 50 years of age, and/ or perimenopausal, and do 
not qualify for the females not of reproductive potential category.   
 Females not of reproductive potential are defined as: females who have been in natural menopause for at least 24 consecutive months, or w ho have had a hysterectomy and/ or 
bilateral oophorectomy, or female children who have not started menstruating.  
 
Females of reproductive potential must also adhere to the scheduled pregnancy testing as required in the Revlimid REMS ® program.  
Urine pregnancy tests should be performed as clinically indicated for women of childbearing 
potential.  
 
Bone Marrow Biopsy and Aspirate  
An unilateral bone marrow biopsy and aspirate will be done at screening or up to 90 days before the first dose of study drug. Thereafter, bone marrow biopsy and aspirate will only be 
required to confirm CR if it was positive at screening.  
 
ECG  
An electrocardiogram will be conducted during screening to evaluate for clinically significant 
cardiac arrhythmias.  
 
Determination of FLIPI Score  
During the screening phase, subject ’s FLIPI score will be calculated and recorded as outlined 
in Appendix 3.  
 
Determination of Tumor Burden Status  
During the screening phase, subject ’s tumor burden, either high or low will be determined 
using the GELF criteria as outlined in Appendix 4.

 57 Blood Sampling and Tumor Tissue Collection for Correlative Studies  
Blood and tumor sample collection for biomarker studies is optional. In consenting subjects, 10 
ml of blood sample (purple top, EDTA) will be collected within 28 days prior to the first infusion of obinutuzumab, C1D8 ( ± 2 days), C4D1 ( ± 2 days), and at the time of disease 
progression ( ±14 days). These samples will be transported within 6 hours of collection to Dr. 
Neelapu ’s laboratory for processing at the South Campus Research Building I, Room 4.3206, 
at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC).   In consenting patients, core needle biopsies and FNA will be obtained by Interventional 
Radiology from an accessible lymph node under ultrasound or CT -scan guidance within 28 
days prior to the first infusion of obinutuzumab, on C1D8 ( ±2 days), and at the time of disease 
progression ( ±14 days). Whenever feasible, up to 3 cores will be obtained using 18 or 20 gauge 
needles as deemed appropriate by an Interventional Radiologist. The three cores will be placed into normal saline and transported within 6 hours of collection on ice to Dr. Neelapu’s 
laboratory for processing at the South Campus Research Building I, Room 4.3206, at MDACC. The cores will be processed as follows: i) the first core will be disaggregated and analyzed by flow cytometry and single cell RNA sequencing, ii) second core will be formalin- fixed and 
paraffin -embedded for IHC, iii) third core will be snap frozen for DNA, RNA, or protein 
isolation. If fresh biopsies are not feasible, archival tissue from prior tumor biopsy may be used for biomarker studies.  
Samples will be maintained until the study has been terminated.  
 
SUBJECT COMPLETION AND WITHDRAWAL 
Completion  
A subject will be considered to have completed the study if he or she has died before the end of the study, has not been lost to follow up, or has not withdrawn consent before the end of 
the study.  
 
Treatment Discontinuation  
 
Study treatment will be discontinued in any of the following events:  
• SD after 6 cycles of therapy.  
• Confirmed PD  
• Unacceptable toxicity: an intercurrent illness or AE that prevents further study drug administration beyond 28 days  
• Treatment discontinuation by subject beyond 28 days  
• Investigator decision  
• Subject becomes pregnant  
 
All subjects, regardless of reason for discontinuation of study treatment will undergo a treatment termination visit and followed for progression and survival.

 58 Study Exit/Withdrawal  
 
Exit from study (including all follow up) will occur under the following circumstances:  
• Withdrawal of consent for follow -up observation by the subject  
• Lost to follow up  
• Study termination by the Investigator  
• Death  
 
If a subject is lost to follow up, every reasonable effort should be made by the study personnel 
to contact the subject. The measures taken should be documented.  
 
When a subject withdraws before the completing the study, the following information should be 
documented:  
• Reason for withdrawal  
 
Whether the subject withdraws full consent (withdraws consent for treatment and all follow up including further contact) or partial consent (withdraws consent to treatment but agrees to 
participate in follow up visits).  
 
Statistical 
General Considerations  
This is an open- label, Phase II study investigating the efficacy and safety of obinutuzumab and 
lenalidomide in previously untreated subjects with FL. The study will include 90 subjects in 
one treatment arm.  
 
Response Assessment  
 
Response assessments w ill be done and recorded by the Principal Investigator. The response criteria are based on the revised criteria for malignant lymphoma described in the Lugano Criteria, international Working Group for NHL (Cheson 2014). In addition, will examine response assessment based on the Cheson 2007 response criteria for historical comparison.  
 
Safety Monitoring  
 
The Principal Investigator or a physician designee will assess each subject to evaluate for potential new or worsening AEs as specified in the Trial Flow Chart, Appendix 1 and more frequently if clinically indicated. Adverse experiences will be graded and recorded throughout the study and during the follow -up period according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.03. Toxicities 
will be characterized in terms regarding seriousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action taken with regard to trial treatment. The study investigators and data coordinators are

 59 responsible for entering the data and safety for this study including causality. For both AEs 
and SAEs, the Investigator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the event.  
 Safety data will be monitored by the Principal Investigator and in accordance with institutional policies. The Investigator will record the action taken with the study drugs as a result of an AE or SAE, as applicable (e.g., discontinuation, interruption, or reduction of study drugs, as 
appropriate) and report if concomitant and/ or additional treatments were given for the event. 
AEs and SAEs will be reviewed on an ongoing basis to identify safety concerns.   For subjects with a history of Hepatitis B or C, standard of care monitoring for viral 
reactivation will be conducted. Subjects with a history of Hepatitis B will be required to 
undergo hepatitis B reactivation prophylaxis unless contraindicated.  
 All SAEs that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject ’s participation in the 
study must be followed until recovered, recovered with sequelae, not recovered or death (due to the SAE).  
 Genentech and Celgene shall notify the Investigator via an IND Safety Report of the following 
information:  
 
Any AE associated with the use of study drug in this study or in other studies that is both serious and unexpected, any changes on the investigational brochure or any other safety 
information that changes the risk/ benefit profile of obinutuzumab or lenalidomide during the 
conduct of the study; any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects; including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity. The Principal Investigator shall notify his/ her IRB promptly of these new serious and unexpected AEs or significant risks to subjects. The Investigator must keep copies of all AE 
information, including correspondence with Genentech, Celgene, and the IRB, on file.  
 
Definition of Analysis Populations  
 
The following definitions will be used for the efficacy and safety analysis:  
 
All treated population: The subjects who enrolled in the study and had at least 1 dose of study 
drug.  
 
Response evaluable population: The subjects in the all treated population who have measurable 
disease at baseline and have at least one adequate post -treatment disease assessment by the 
investigator.  
 Safety analysis population: All enrolled subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug 
(same as the all treated population).

Obinutuzumab  + lenalidomide in untreated FL MDACC  Protocol 2015- 0464 Version 11 
 60 The all treated population will be used for analyzing efficacy endpoints unless specified 
otherwise. The response evaluation population will be used for sensitivity analysis of efficacy 
endpoints. The safety population will be used for safety analysis.  
 
Endpoint Data Analysis  
 
Baseline Characteristics 
 
Subject demographics (age, sex, race/ ethnicity) and other baseline characteristics (ECOG PS, 
tumor burden, FLIPI score) will be summarized. Summary statistics will include means, standard deviations, and medians for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables. Compliance parameters including number of completed cycles, number of dose 
modifications, and reasons for discontinuation will also be similarly summarized.  
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
 
The primary efficacy endpoint is PFS rate at 2 years. Response w ill be assessed by the investigator based on the 2014 Cheson Lugano criteria. The 2- year PFS rate will be calculated 
and corresponding 95%  CI will be derived.  
 
Analysis Methods  
 
The primary analysis for all efficacy endpoints will be conducted based on the all treated 
population. PFS is defined as the time from the treatment start date (Cycle 1, Day 1) until the first date of objectively documented progressive disease or date of death from any cause. 
Patients will be censored at the last follow -up date if progression or death has not occurred 
during follow -up.   If a patient has missing data (incomplete CT scan), all other available CT, 
PET/ CT or MRI of the patient will be used for the analysis.  Kaplan- Meier method will be 
used to estimate the PFS.  Corresponding 95%  CI will be summarized. Cox proportional hazards models will be used to assess the effects of patient prognostic factors on time -to-
event endpoints. The final analysis will be performed when the last patient is followed for 3 
years after last study drug dose.  
 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
 
CR rate at 120 w eeks (± 4 weeks) will be determined by the PI (Cheson, Lugano classification 
2014). The number and percentage of subjects with a CR at 120 weeks will be tabulated.

Obinutuzumab  + lenalidomide in untreated FL MDACC  Protocol 2015- 0464 Version 11 
 61 ORR (CR + PR) will be assessed by the investigator based on Cheson, Lugano 2014. The 
number and percentage of subjects with an ORR will be tabulated. The best ORR will be 
recorded.  
 
DOR  will be measured from the time by which measurement criteria for CR or PR, whichever is 
recorded first, is met until death or the first date by which progressive disease is documented. 
Subjects who are progression free and alive at the time of clinical cut -off or have unknown 
status w ill be censored at the last tumor assessment. Subjects w ith no baseline disease 
assessment w ill be censored on cycle 1, day 1. Non -responders will be excluded from the 
analysis for DOR. Kaplan -Meier methodology w ill be used to estimate event -free curves, 
median, and 95%  CI.  
 EFS will be measured from the date of cycle 1, day 1 to the date of first documented 
progression, transformation to diffuse large B -cell lymphoma, initiation of new anti -lymphoma 
treatment, or death. Kaplan- Meier methodology will be used to estimate event -free curves, 
median, and 95%  CI.  
 OS will be measured from the date of cycle 1, day 1 to the date of death regardless of cause. 
For subjects who have not died, subjects will be censored at the time of last contact. Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate event -free curves, median, and 95%  CI.  
 
Safety Analysis  
 
Analysis of safety data will be conducted on the safety population. Safety summaries will include tabulations in the form of tables and listings. The frequency (number and percentage) of treatment -emergent AEs will be reported. Additional AE summaries will include AE 
frequency by AE severity and by relationship to study drug.  
 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values will be summarized.  
 
 
Handling of Missing Data 
 
Subjects lost to follow up will be included in the statistical analyses up to the point of their last 
evaluation or contact.  
 
Data for subjects without disease progression or death will be censored at the date of the last 
tumor assessment and before the date of initiation of alternative anticancer therapy. Subjects with no post -baseline assessment will be censored on cycle 1, day 1.

Obinutuzumab  + lenalidomide in untreated FL MDACC  Protocol 2015- 0464 Version 11 
 62 The primary endpoint is PFS.  It is expected that the experimental regimen will achieve better 
efficacy compared to the standard of care for this population. It was reported that the standard 
of care of lenalidomide and rituximab in this patient population had a two- year PFS rate of 
86.5%  (95%  CI: 77% -  97.2% ). We will enroll a total of 90 patients with an accrual rate of 4 
patients per month.  All patients will be followed for at least 3 years or until death.  The final 
analysis w ill be performed w hen the last patient is follow ed for 3 years.  When the sample size 
is 90,  a  t wo -sided 95%  CI for the PFS rate at 2 years will extend 0. 087 from the observed rate 
for an expected rate of 77%  (nQuery Advisor 7.0).  According to our previous experience, we 
will be able to obtain biomarker data from about 30%  of patients enrolled.  We will explore the 
correlation between the biomarkers and clinical outcomes.  
 
Trial Monitoring  
Due to the fast accrual planned for the study and long median PFS time expected for the experimental regimen, a formal futility monitoring rule is not feasible.  
Because of the limited number of patients who have received the combination treatment, for pat
ient safety we will monitor the prohibitive toxicity, defined as frequent discontinuation (>2 
discontinuations ) of treatment during cycles 1 and 2. The prohibitive toxicity  rate of 15%  or 
higher will be considered unacceptable. The prior probability of the rate is assumed to follow a Beta (0.3, 1.7) distribution with two patients worth of information. We will monitor patients by 
a cohort size of 10.  At any time after at least 10 patients have completed toxicity evaluations, 
the trial will be stopped if the following statement is true  
 
Pr 
[prohibitive toxicity rate > 15%  | data]  > 0.95,  
 which means that the trial will be stopped for toxicity if the posterior probability of the rate being greater than 15%  is greater 95% .   
Patients will be monitored by a cohort size of 10 according to the following stopping 
boundaries for prohibitive toxicity at cycles 1 and 2:  
 
Number of patients evaluated  Stop if ≥ prohibitive toxicities observed  
10 4-10 
20 7-20 
30 9-30 
40 11-40

 Toxicity and response summaries will be submitted to the IND Office Medical Affairs &  Safety  
after the first 10 evaluable participants are treated in the study and every 10 evaluable 
participants thereafter.  
 To ensure patient safety, we will also utilize an additional monitoring rule for treatment -
related death.  Any treatment -related death occurring at any time  will result in pause in 
accrual pending complete evaluation and discussion between the Principal Investigator and the FDA.   
Any second malignancy other than non- melanoma skin cancer that occurs anytime during the 
study will result in pause in accrual pending complete evaluation and discussion between the 
Principal Investigator and the FDA.

Reporting of Adverse Events  
Assessment of Safety  
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of safety information is the 
responsibility of the PI and will be conducted in accordance with Institution policies.   
 
Safety assessments w ill consist of monitoring and reporting adverse events (AEs) and 
serious adverse events (SAEs)  that are considered related to obinutuzumab  or 
lenalidomide per protocol , all events of death, and any study specific issue of 
concern.  
Adverse Events  
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associated w ith the use of an investigational medicinal product (IMP) or other 
protocol -imposed intervention, regardless of attribution . 
This includes the follow ing :

 64 AEs not previously observed in the patient  that emerge during the protocol -specified AE reporting 
period, including signs or symptoms associated w ith follicular lymphoma  that w ere not present prior to 
the AE reporting period.  
Complications that occur as a result of protocol -mandated interventions (e.g., invasive procedures such 
as cardiac catheterizations).  
If applicable, AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment associated w ith medication w ashout, 
no treatment run -in, or other protocol -mandated intervention.  
Preexisting medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) judged by the investigator to have w orsened in severity or frequency or changed in character during the protocol -specified AE 
reporting period.  
 
Serious Adverse Events  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting Requirements for M D Anderson Sponsor Single Site IND 
Protocols  
 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious ” if, in the view  of either the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the follow ing  
outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse event  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• A congenital anomaly/ birth defect.  
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered a serious adverse drug experience w hen, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32).  
 
• Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered serious adverse events. Any important medical event can and should be reported as an SAE if deemed appropriate by 
the Principal Investigator or the IND Sponsor, IND Office.  
• All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a SAE must 
be reported to the IRB in accordance w ith the timeframes and procedures outlined in “The 
University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review  Board Policy on Reporting Adverse Events for Drugs and Devices ”. 
• Serious adverse events w ill be captured from the time of the first protocol -specific intervention, 
until 30 days after the last dose of drug, unless the participant w ithdraw s consent.  
• Serious adverse events must be follow ed until clinical recovery is complete and laboratory tests have returned to baseline, progression of the event has stabilized, or there has been acceptable resolution of the event.  
• All SAEs, expected or unexpected/  initial or follow  up, must be reported to the IND Office 
within 5 working days of knowledge of the event  regardless of the attribution .

Obinutuzumab  + lenalidomide in untreated FL MDACC  Protocol 2015- 0464 Version 11 
 65 • Death or life -threatening events that are unexpected, possibly, probably or definitely related to 
drug must be reported (initial or follow  up) to the IND Office within 24 hours of knowledge of 
the event  
• Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the 30 day time period that are 
related to the study treatment must be reported to the IND Office. This may include the 
development of a secondary malignancy.  
• The electronic SAE application (eSAE) will be utilized for safety reporting to the IND Office and MD Anderson IRB.  
• All events reported to the supporting company must also be reported to the IND Office  
 
Reporting to FDA:  
• Serious adverse events w ill be forw arded to FDA by the IND Sponsor  according to 21 CFR 
312.32.  
 
It is the responsibility of the PI and the research team to ensure serious adverse events are reported 
according to the Code of Federal Regulations, Good Clinical Practices, the protocol guidelines, the 
sponsor ’s guidelines, and Institutional Review Board policy . 
 
Methods and Timing for Assessing and Recording Safety Variables  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs , that are observed 
or reported during the study, are collected and reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ), appropriate IRB(s), and Genentech , Inc. in accordance w ith 
CFR 312.32 (IND Safety Reports).  
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during w hich all AEs and SAEs must  be reported after informed 
consent is obtained an d initiation of study treatment  and ends 30 days follow ing the 
last administration of study treatment or study discontinuation/ termination, w hichever is earlier. After this period, investigators should only report SAEs that are attributed to prior study treatm ent.  
Assessment of Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs w hether volunteered by the patient , discovered by study personnel 
during questioning, or detected through physical examination, laboratory test, or other means w ill be reported appropriately.  Each reported AE or SAE w ill be 
described by its duration (i.e., start and end dates), regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to the study drug (obinutuzumab and lenalidomide, see follow ing guidance), and actions taken.  
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should apply the follow ing general guideline:  
Attribution  is the determination of w hether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or 
procedure.  
• Definite  -  the adverse event is clearly related to the investigational agent(s).  
• Probable  -  the adverse event is likely related to the investigational agent(s).  
• Possible  -  the adverse event may be related to the investigational agent(s).  
• Unlikely  -  The adverse event is doubtfully related to the investigational agent(s).  
• Unrelated  -  The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the investigational agent(s).

 66 Expected AEs are those AEs that are listed or characterized in the Package Insert or 
current Investigator Brochure.  
Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the Package Insert (P.I.) or current 
Investigator ’s Brochure or not identified.   This includes AEs for w hich the specificity 
or severity is not consistent w ith the description in the P.I. or Invest igator ’s 
Brochure .  For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis w ould be unexpected 
if the P.I. or Investigator ’s Brochure  only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or 
hepatitis.  
Procedures for Eliciting, Recording, and Reporting Adverse Events  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
A consistent methodology for eliciting AEs at all patient  evaluation timepoints should be adopted.  
Examples of non -directive questions include:  
“How have you felt since your last clinical visit? ” 
“Have you had any new  or changed health problems since you w ere last here? ”  
 
Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse Events  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/ concepts w hen reporting AEs or 
SAEs.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.  
Diagnosis v ersus  Signs and Symptoms  
If know n at the time of reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather than individual 
signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, 
asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/ or 
symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, it is acceptable to report the information that is currently available.  
If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow -up 
information.  
Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period (see 
Sect ion  10.2.1 ), regardless of attribution, w ill be reported to the appropriate parties.  
When recording a death, the event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be reported as the single medical concept.  If the cause of 
death is unknow n and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, report “Unexplained Death”. 
Preexisting Medical Conditions 
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such 
conditions should be reported as medical and surgical history.  A preexisting medical 
condition should be re -assessed throughout the trial and reported as an AE or SAE 
only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition w orsens during the study.  When reporting such events, it is important to convey the concept that the 
preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., “ more 
frequent headaches ”).

 67 Hospitalizations for Medical or Surgical Procedures  
Any AE that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be 
documented and reported as an SAE.   If a patient  is hospitalized to undergo a 
medical or surgical procedure as a result of an AE, the event responsible for the 
procedure, not the procedure itself, should be reported as the SAE.  For example, if 
a patient  is hospitalized to undergo coronary bypass surgery, record the heart 
condition that necessitated the bypass as the SAE.  
Hospitalizations for the follow ing reasons do not require reporting:  
Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical procedures for preexisting conditions  
Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization required to allow  efficacy measurement for the study or  
Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for scheduled therapy of the target disease of the study.

Pregnancy 
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless 
of age or disease state) of a female subject occurring w hile the subject is on obinutuzumab or lenalidomide, or w ithin 18 months of the subject ’s last dose of 
obinutuzumab and 3 months of the last dose  lenalidomide, are considered 
immediately reportable events.  Obinutuzumab or lenalidomide is to be discontinued 
immediately. The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must 
be reported to Genentech, Inc. and Celgene Drug Safety immediately by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the Pregnancy Initial Report Form, or approved equivalent form. The female subject may be referred to an obstetrician -gynecologist 
(not necessarily one w ith reproductive toxicity experience) or another appropriate healthcare professional for further evaluation.  
The Investigator w ill follow  the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and 
must notify Celgene Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow -up Report Form, 
or approved equivalent form.  
 IF THE OUTCOME OF THE PREGNANCY WAS ABNORMAL (E.G., 
SPONTANEOUS OR THERAPEUTIC ABORTION), THE INVESTIGATOR SHOULD REPORT THE ABNORMAL OUTCOME AS AN AE.  IF THE 
ABNORMAL OUTCOME MEETS ANY OF THE SERIOUS CRITERIA, IT MUST BE 
REPORTED AS AN SAE TO CELGENE DRUG SAFETY IMMEDIATELY BY FACSIM ILE, OR OTHERAPPROPRIATE M ETHOD, WITHIN 24 HOURS OF THE INVESTIGATOR ’S KNOWLEDGE OF THE EVENT USING THE SAE REPORT 
FORM, OR APPROVED EQUIVALENT FORM.  
 All neonatal deaths that occur w ithin 28 days of birth should be reported, w ithout 
regard to causality, as SAEs. In addition, any infant death after 28 days that the Investigator suspects is related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by facsimile, or other appropriate

 68 method, within 24 hours of the Investigator ’s know ledge of the event using the SAE 
Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  
 
Male Subjects  
If a female partner of a male subject taking investigational product becomes pregnant, 
the male subject taking lenalidomide should notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female partner should be advised to call their healthcare provider immediately.  
If the female partner of a male study subject  becomes  pregnant while the study 
subject is  receiving  obinutuzumab  or within  6 months  of the last dose of 
obinutuzumab , a report should  be  completed  and  expeditiously  submitted  to 
Genentech . 
Post -Study Adverse Events  
The investigator should expeditiously report any SAE occurring after a patient  has 
completed or discontinued study participation if attributed to prior obinutuzumab exposure.  If the investigator should become aw are of the development of cancer or a 
congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a female patient  who  
participated in the study, this should be reported as an SAE.  
Adverse Events  of Special Interest (AESIs)  
The following AEs are considered of special interest and must be reported to the  Sponsor expeditiously  
(see Section  10.3.2.9  for reporting instructions) irrespective of regulatory seriousness criteria:  
Adverse events of special interest for this study include the following:  
Cases of potential drug -induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or 
AST in combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as 
defined by Hy's Law and based on the following observations: -  Treatment -
emergent ALT or AST > 3 x baseline value in combination with total bilirubin 
> 2 x ULN (of which > 35%  is direct bilirubin) -  Treatment -emergent ALT or 
AST > 3 x baseline value in combination with clinical jaundice  
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study treatment, as 
defined below -  Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion 
protein transmitting transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or 
non- pathogenic, is considered an infectious agent. A transmission of an 
infectious agent may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal 
product. This term applies only when a contamination of study treatment is 
suspected  
The obinutuzumab Events  of Special  Interest  are:
 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome  (serious and non- serious events)  
Second malignancies  
 
Other Special Situations Reports  
 
The following  other Special  Situations  Reports  should  be collected  even  in the absence  of an

a. For each Cycle, assessment is assumed to be on Day 1 unless otherwise specified.  
b. In subjects who discontinue study therapy without documented disease progression, every effort should be made to continue monitoring their disease status as per the follow -up schedule 
until (1) the start of new anti -cancer treatment, (2) documented disease progression, (3) death, or (4) the end of the study, whichever occurs first.  Survival assessments will continue up 
to 3 years after the last study drug.  
c. Treatment cycles are 28 days; however the treatment cycle interval may be increased due to toxicity according to the dose modification guidelines provided in Section 5.4 . If the interval 
is increased, all procedures except for response assessment should be performed based on the new dosing schedule  
d. Written consent must be obtained prior to performing any protocol specific procedure. Results of a test performed prior to the subject signing consent as part of routine clinical 
management are acceptable in lieu of a screening test if performed within the specified time frame (e.g., within 28 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment). Screening number will be assigned when the study informed consent is signed.  
e. Record all medications taken within 28 days of screening visit. Concomitant medications – Enter new medications started through the treatment phase as well as up to 30 days after the 
last study drug dose.  Record all medications taken for SAEs  as defined in Section 10.1.2.  
f. Obinutuzumab  administration will occur on day 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1; Day 1 of cycles 2 -6; Day 1 of cycles 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, and 30. Hypersensitivity reaction 
should be managed according to institution policy and as outlined in Section 6.4.  
g. Patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) >60 mL/ min as determined by modified Crockcroft -Gault will receive 6 cycles of lenalidomide, 20mg daily on days 1 -21 of a 28 day cycle ( ± 
2days). Patients wit h  a CR after 6 cycles will then receive 10mg of lenalidomide daily on days 1- 21 every 28 days ( ± 2days) for a total of 18 cycles. Patients w ith a PR aft er 6 cycles will 
continue 20mg of lenalidomide on days 1- 21 every 28 days ( ± 2days) for 3 to 6 more cycles until they achieve a CR at which time they will receive 10mg lenalidomide on days 1- 21 every 
28 days ( ± 2days) for the remainder of 18 cycles. Patients with a PR after 12 cycles will then receive 10mg of lenalidomide on days 1- 21 every 28 days ( ± 2days) for the remainder of 18 
cycles.  Patients that fail to achieve at least a PR after 6 cycles with discontinue study drug. For subjects with earlier evidence of nonresponse that warrants change in therapy in the 
opinion of the treating physician, will discontinue study drug.  
h. AEs and laboratory safety measurements will be graded per NCI CTCAE version 4.03. All AEs, will also be evaluated for seriousness and handled as discussed in Section 10.1 . 
Unresolved abnormal labs that are drug related AEs should be followed weekly until resolution. Labs do not need to be repeated after the end of treatment if labs are within normal range.  
AEs will be monitored until 30 days after last study drug dose.  
i. Vital signs to include temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, weight and blood pressure. Height will be measured at Screening visit 1 only.  
j. For women of child- bearing potential, a serum pregnancy test should be performed10 -14 days and 24 hours prior to the initial prescription of lenalidomide.  . Females of reproductive 
potential must adhere to the scheduled pregnancy testing as required in the Revlimid REMS ® program.

Obinutuzumab + lenalidomide in untreated FL MDACC  
Protocol 2015 --0464 Version 11 81 k. Coagulation factors (PT/ INR and aPTT) should be tested as part of the screening procedures for all subjects. For subjects requiring anticoagulation during the study, appropriate 
coagulation tests should be done when clinically indicated to monitor anticoagulation.  
l. These screening tests need to be finalized prior to the first dose of obinutuzumab. HCV RNA will be performed if Hep C Ab is positive.  
m. All subjects will have bone marrow biopsy/ aspirate performed at baseline (within 90 days of cycle 1, day 1). Subsequent bone marrow assessments will only be performed in subjects who 
have bone marrow  involvement at baseline to confirm disease response (CR) . 
n. In consenting patients, a fresh t umor biopsy can be coll ected . If this is not possible, archival tumor tissue (paraffin embedded) when available should be collected at Screening for 
biomarker analyses. On C1D8 ( ± 2 days) an optional research biopsy should be performed. At the time of confirmed PD, if a tumor biopsy is planned as part of routine clinical practice, 
for consenting patients, a fresh tumor sample should be collected and processed.  
o. Biomarker blood samples will be collected and processed. During screening or within 28 days of the first infusion of obinutuzumab, on cycle 1, day 8 ( ± 2 days), cycle 4 , Day 1 (± 2 days), 
and at the time of documented PD  (±14 days) , blood biomarker collectio n should be performed. 
p. Disease response assessment is based upon Cheson 2014 lymphoma response criteria  and Cheson 2007 revised response criteria . “Diagnostic quality ” PET-CT with oral contrast/ or 
water and IV contrast should be performed at Screening unless there is a contraindication. If CT scans have already been completed, a PET can be performed at Screening. PET/ CT or CT and PET should be repeated to confirm complete remission and/ or at treatment discontinuation. For lymphomas that are not F DG-avid, PET does not need to be repeated in 
subsequent assessments. CTs of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis with IV contrast will otherwise be conducted at baseline for those who do not undergo diagnostic quality PET -CT, 
at approximately Cycle 4, Day 1 ( ± 7 days), Cycle 7, Day 1 ( ± 7 days ), Cycle 10, Day 1 ( ± 7 days ), Cycle 14 , Day 1 ( ± 7 days ), Cycle 20 , Day 1 ( ± 7 days) , Cycle 26 , Day 1 ( ± 7 days) , 
and at the completion of treatment . During the follow -up phase, response assessment w ill occur every 24 w eeks ( ±4 w eeks)  x 3 assessments, and then annually (± 4 weeks) until study 
completion, PD, w ithdrawal of consent, death, or lost to follow up, whichever comes first. When a contraindication prevents CT, an MRI of the chest, abdomen/ pelvis can be substituted.  
In subjects who discontinue study therapy without confirmed disease progression, a radiological assessment should be performed at the time of treatment discontinuation (i.e. date of 
discontinuation ± 2 weeks). If previous scan was obtained within 4 weeks prior to the date of discontinuation, then a repeat scan at treatment discontinuation isn’ t mandatory.

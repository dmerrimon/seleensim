OVERALL RATIONALE FOR REVISED PROTOCOL 03:
On 6-Mar-2020, Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) decided to permanentl y discontinue enrollment and 
dosing in the nivolumab + ab emaciclib + anastrozol e cohorts of the CA2097A8 study.  
 
 
 
 
 
The study 
is currently in the Safety Run-In Phase. A t implementation of R evised Protocol 03, the study will 
only evaluate whether the combination of nivolumab, with palboc iclib, plus anastrozole is a safe 
and effective neoadjuvant treatment for men and postmenopausal women with primary BC ≥2 cm 
that is ER+ and HER2- subtype who are suitable to receive NET an d willing to undergo SOC 
breast surgery after completion of the study treatment. Partici pants must have histologically 
confirmed invasive breast carcinoma meeting the characteristics  described in the Inclusion 
Criteria. Participants in screening and not yet treated were off ered the option to join the safety
lead-in of the nivolumab + pal bociclib + anastrozole arm. Parti cipants on treatment with 
nivolumab + abemaciclib + anastrozole were to be re-consented an d continue on anastrozole alone, 
or taken off study. Safety monitoring for ILD/pneumonitis (base line chest X-ray, periodic pulse 
oximetry) as risk mitigation measures have also been included. 
Additional changes were made to include the updates from Admin istrative Letter 01 and 
clarifications.

Section Number & Title Description of Change Brief Rationale
Section 3.3.3 CDK4/6 Inhibitor and 
Nivolumab Combination Safety 
ProfileAdded the following paragraph:
In a Phase 2 study of 
pembrolizumab, palbociclib and letrozole (AI) in patients with metastatic ER+, HER2- BC ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), of 20 patients treated with the triple combination, Grade 3 pneumonitis was reported in 1 patient  during the DLT assessment 
period. The median follow up for this study was 13.7 months (95% CI 6.4-16.9) and progression-free survival (PFS) has not been reached.  Also in a phase 1 study exploring safety and efficacy of avelumab, palbociclib and axitinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), of 13 patients treated at 3 dose levels, 1 patient 
with baseline chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease at dose level 3 developed a respiratory failure event possibly related to study treatment and died. No Grade 3 or above ILD/pneumonitis events were reported.  A randomized Phase 2 trial assessing a triple combination regimen of palbociclib + avelumab (anti-PD-L1 inhibitor) + fulvestrant (estrogen receptor antagonist) for patients with pre-treated metastatic 
ER+/HER2- BC has been ongoing 
since Aug-2017; no clinical data have been reported to date. ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Thus, the potential benefit of the palbociclib combination therapy appears to outweigh the known risks and warrants clinical investigation.Additional supporting information.

endpoints the definitions of pCR were expandedConsistency across program protocols.
Section 5.1 Overall Design Added the following paragraphs and removed reference to equal 
distribution of participants in both

Removed references to abemaciclib, 
and to equal distribution of participants in both safety run-in cohorts.
Deleted the following text: At the 
end of the Safety Run-in Phase, the Sponsor will evaluate the safety profile of the 2 cohorts. In the case that the treatment regimen for 1 of the 2 cohorts is not deemed to be tolerable for use in the Randomization Phase, then the treatment regimen for the other 
cohort will advance to the 
Randomization Phase, with the statistical assumptions remaining unchanged for this part, as captured in Section 10 (Statistical 
Considerations).Cohort 1 is now closed for 
enrollment.

Clinical Protocol CA2097A8
BMS-936558 nivolumab
1 SYNOPSIS
Protocol Title: Randomized, Non-comparative Neoadjuvant Phase II Study in Patie nts with 
ER+/HER2- Breast Cancer ≥2 cm with Safety Run-in, Assessing Nivolumab + Palbociclib + 
Anastrozole
Short Title: Nivolumab with Palbociclib plus Anastrozole in Patients with ER+/HE R2- Breast 
Cancer≥2 cm
Study Phase: 2
Rationale:
Blockade of the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) pathway has demo nstrated clinical activity across 
multiple tumor types, includi ng breast cancer (BC). An accumula ting body of evidence supports 
PD-1/cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK)4/6 blockade potential synergy , as it has become more 
apparent that CDK4/6 inhibitors affect the tumor immune microen vironment (ie, increases 
expression of programmed death-liga nd 1 [PD-L1], enhances antig en presentation and secretion 
of cytokines from both tumor and CD8+ T cells, and suppresses p roliferation of 
immunosuppressive regulatory T cells [Tregs]). Preliminary clinical data supporting synergistic 
activity of the combination o f pembrolizumab and abemaciclib ha s been demonstrated in a Phase 
1b study of heavily pretreated p articipants with metastatic hormone receptor-positive (HR+), 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) BC. C linical data on combinations 
of other CDK4/6 inhibitors coupled with PD-(L)1 inhibition are be ing generated in multiple 
clinical trials spanning from the neo adjuvant to metastatic set ting (ClinicalTrials.gov: 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).
The aim of CA2097A8 is to assess the potential synergistic acti vity of nivolumab with palboci clib 
and anastrozole in participants with newly diagnosed, previously untreated primary estrogen 
receptor-positive (ER+), HER2- BC ≥2 cm, defined by significantly improved residual cancer
burden (RCB; 0-I) rate.  
 
Additional objectives of the 
study include characterization of safety and tolerability of thi s combination  
 
. 
Study Population:
Participants will include men and postme nopausal women with ER+ and HER2- pr imary 
BC≥2c m .

Objectives and Endpoints:
Objectives Endpoints
Primary
•Safety Run-in Phase: Number of 
participants with occurrence of DLT.•DLT is defined as TEAE (graded according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0) that occurs during the first 4 weeks after 
treatment start and that meets specific criteria.
•Randomized Phase: To assess RCB 0-I rate
by central assessment of palbociclib plus anastrozole with or without nivolumab in all participants with untreated pr imary BC 
≥2 cm (ER+, HER2-).•RCB 0-I r ate assessed by central assessment at the time of 
definitive surgery.
•RCB is a conti nuous index combining pathological 
measurements of primary tumor (s ize and cellularity) and 
nodal metastases (number and size) defined by a point system at surgery (refer to Appendix 7).
Secondary
•To assess the safety and tolerability of palbociclib plus anastrozole with or without nivolumab.•Incidence of AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, immune-related AEs, deaths, and laboratory abnormalities in all participants.
•To assess pCR rate by local assessment of palbociclib plus anast rozole with or without 
nivolumab in participants with untreated 
primary BC ≥2 cm (ER+, HER2-).•pCR rate in all participants assessed by the local pathologist 
at the time of definitive surgery. pCR is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen 
and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion 
of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (ie, ypT0/Tis ypN0 in the current AJCC staging system).
−pCR, defined as no invasive residual disease in breast 
or lymph nodes (ie, ypT0/is, ypN0) in the current AJCC 
staging system.
•To assess ORR (clinical and radiological 
[ultrasound (preferred) or mammography]) by Investigator assessment and BCS rate of palbociclib plus anastrozole with or without nivolumab in participants with untreated 
primary BC ≥2 cm (ER+, HER2-).•ORR is defined as the number of participants with a BOR 
of CR or PR divided by the number of randomized participants for each treatment group at the end of the study treatment period.
•BCS rate is defined as the number of participants who undergo BCS after completing the study treatments divided by the number of randomized participants for each treatment group.

to receive neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) and willing to u ndergo standard-of-care (SOC) 
breast surgery after completion of the study treatment. 
On 6-Mar-2020, Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) decided to permanentl y discontinue enrollment and 
dosing in the nivolumab + abemaciclib + anastrozole cohorts of the CA209-7A8 study during the 
Safety Run-in phase.  
 
 
 
 
 
At implementation of Revised Protocol  03, the study will only e valuate whether the combination 
of nivolumab, with palbociclib plus anastrozole is a safe and e ffective neoadjuvant treatment for 
men and postmenopausal women with primary BC ≥2 cm that is ER+ and HER2- subtype who 
are suitable to receive NET and willing to undergo SOC breast s urgery after completion of the 
study treatment. Participants must have histologically confirme d invasive breast carcinoma 
meeting the characteristics described in the Inclusion Criteria . Participants in screening and not 
yet treated were be offered the option to join the safety lead- in of the nivolumab + palbociclib + 
anastrozole arm. Participants on treatment with nivolumab + abe maciclib + anastrozole were to be 
re-consented and continue on anastrozole alone, OR taken off st udy. In addition, baseline chest X-
ray and periodic pulse oximetry are implemented to monitor ILD/ pneumonitis in patients who will 
be treated with nivolumab + palbociclib + anastrozole.
The study is divided into 3 periods: Screening Period, On-treat ment Pre-surgery (neoadjuvant) 
Period (Safety Run-in Phase and Randomized Phase), and Safety Fo llow-up Period.
The study started with a Safety Run-in Phase for the combination  of nivolumab, w ith abemaciclib 
or palbociclib, plus anastrozole and will begin the Randomized Ph ase after the regimen is 
determined to be safe. Participants in the Safety Run-in Phase will move to the Safety Follow-up 
Period upon completion of the neoadjuvant treatment or upon dis continuation. Potential needs for 
additional enrollment or for dose de-escalation w ill be discussed with Investigators and BMS 
during the Saf ety Run-in Phase. Once a safe dose for the regimen  has been determined by BMS in 
collaboration with Investigators, the Randomized Phase of the s tudy will begin.
In the Randomized Phase, participants will be randomly assigned  by an IRT system to 3 different 
treatment arms and stratified by the following factors:  
 2) evaluation of l ymph nodes (cytologically positiv e vs radiologically or 
cytologically negative); and 3) tumor size (> 3 cm or ≤3 cm).
For both the Safety Run-in Phase and Randomized Phase, particip ants will be tr eated for a 
maximum of 5 cycles (1 cycle = 4 weeks). Participants with prog ressive disease prior to 
completion of the 5-cycle study treatment must discontinue all s tudy drugs and proceed to the 
Safety Follow-up Period. Participants who permanently discontin ue the study drugs for any reason 
are considered to have completed the On-treatment Pre-surgery ( neoadjuvant) Period, and hence

anastrozole (as concomitant medication and not as study treatme nt) until subsequent SOC breast 
surgery. Followi ng the completion of neoadjuvant tr eatment, all participants who remain operative 
candidates will undergo definitive surgery for BC within 4 week s of the last neoadjuvant treatment 
administration. If anastrozole can no longer be administered aft er EOT, participants will go to 
breast surgery right away. Pr e-surgical lym ph node biopsy is not  allowed. Information on the type 
of the surgery will be collected and recorded in the electronic  case report form (eCRF). Surgical
specimens will be collected for the analyses outlined in the pr otocol. Depending on treatment 
assignment, up to 2 safety follow- up visits will be conducted in person. The first safety follow- up 
visit (FU1) will be comp leted for all participants within 30 days ( ±7 days) from the last study 
treatment (oral or intravenous [IV ], whichever occurs later). The second safety follow-up visit 
(FU2) will occ ur approximately within 100 days ( ±7 days) from the last dose of nivolumab and 
will be required for participants in the Safety Run-in Phase an d participants randomized to Arms A
or Bin the Randomized Phase. Further planned tr eatment of participants in the adjuvant setting 
(ie, radiotherapy, endocrine treatment, chemotherapy or any othe r treatment mod ality) will be at 
the discretion of the treating physician, following local clini cal guidelines, and collected in the 
appropriate eCRF.

Number of Participants:
A total of approximately 115~136 participants w ill be tr eated in the study. It is anticipated that 
approximately 3~24 participants (up to approximately 30 screened ) will be t reated in each cohort 
in the Safety Run-in Phase. At the time of Revised Protocol 03,  2 subjects had been treated in 
Cohort 1 (nivolumab + abemaciclib + anastrozole), which was subs equently closed for enrollment. 
Approximately 138 participants w ill be screened for 110 participants to be treated in the 
Randomized Phase, assuming a screen failure rate of approximately 20%. 
Originally, approximately 3~24 parti cipants will be  treated in t he Safety Run-in Phase in each 
cohort (Cohort 1: nivolumab + abemaciclib + anastrozole for 5 cycl es; n = 3∼6 per dose level of 
abemaciclib; Cohort 2: nivolumab + palbociclib + anastrozole for 5 cycles; n = 3 ∼6 per dose level 
of palbociclib). At the time of R evised Protocol 03, 2 subjects had been treated in Cohort 1 
(nivolumab + abemaciclib + anastrozole), which was subsequently closed for enrollment.
Approximately 110 participants are planned to be randomized in t his study at a 4:4:3 ratio into 
Arm A (nivolumab + palbociclib + anastrozole for 5 cycles; n = 4 0), Arm B (palbociclib + 
anastrozole for 1 cycle, followed by nivolumab + palbociclib + anastrozole fo r 4 cycles;  n = 40), 
and Arm C (palbociclib + anatroz ole for 5 cycles ; n = 30), respectively. Participants will be 
stratified by  node status, and tumor size.

BMS-936558 nivolumab
3 INTRODUCTION
CA2097A8 is an open-label, randomized, non-comparative Phase 2 study assessing 
nivolumab, plus palbociclib, and anastrozole as either concurrent  or phased neoadjuvant treatment 
for men and postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer (BC) ≥2 cm that are estrogen 
receptor-positive (ER+) and human epidermal growth factor recept or 2-negative (HER2-) with 
safety run-in.
Nivolumab (BMS-936558) is a fully human, IgG4 (kappa) isotype m onoclonal antibody (mAb),
an immuno-oncologic (IO) checkpoint inhibitor that binds progra mmed cell death-1 (PD-1) on 
activated immune cells and disrupts engagement of the receptor with its ligands programmed 
death-ligand 1 (PD-L1; B7-H 1/CD274) and programmed death-ligand  2 (PD-L2; B7-DC/CD273), 
thereby abrogating inhibitory signals and augmenting the host a nti-tumor response. Palbociclib is
an orally bioavailable and highly selective small-molecule inhi bitor against cyclin-dependent
kinases (CDK)4/cyclin-D1 and CDK6/cyclin-D3 enzyme complexes, le ad to reactivation of 
retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, binding back of E2F transcription factor and subsequent cell cycle 
arrest, thus abrogating endocrine-resistant cell proliferation. Anastrozole is a reversible, third-
generation, selective nonsteroi dal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) th at reduces peripheral estrogen

description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safet y of the study treatments is 
provided i n the Investigator Brochures (IBs) and package inserts.1,2,3,4
The study will assess the efficacy and safety of: i) concurrent therap y with nivolumab in 
combination with palbociclib, and anastrozole (Arm A), ii) phased therapy with one initial priming 
cycle of palbociclib and anastrozole followed by nivolumab in com bination with palbociclib, and 
anastrozole (Arm B), and iii) control tr eatment with palbociclib and anastrozole (Arm C). 
Participants with newly diagnosed, previously untreated primary  ER+ and HER2- BC ≥2 cm will 
be subjected to a total 5 cycles (4 weeks per cycle) of neoadjuv ant therapy before definitive 
surgery. Efficacy will be measured by significantly improved re sidual cancer burden (RCB) 0-I 
rate.  
 
3.1 Study Rationale
PD-1 pathway inhibition has demonstrated clinical activity across mult iple tumor types, including
BC.5An accumulatin g body of evidence s upports PD-1/CDK4/6 blockade potential synergy, as it 
has become more apparent that CDK4/6 inhibitors modulate the tu mor immune 
microenvironment6(ie, increases expression of PD-L1,7enhances antigen presentation8and 
secretion of cytokines from both tumor and CD8+ T cells,9,10and suppresses proliferation of 
immunosuppressive regulato ry T cells [Tregs]8). Preliminary clinical data in support of synergistic 
activity of the combination of pembrolizumab and abemaciclib ha s been demonstrated in a 
Phase 1b study on heavily pretr eated participan ts with metastatic hormone receptor-positive 
(HR+), HER2- BC.11Clinical data on combinations of other CDK4/6 inhibitors with PD -(L)1

blocking agents are being generated in multiple clinical trials spanning from the neoadjuvant to 
metastatic setting (ClinicalTrials.gov: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], NCT0277868 5, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).
Additional treatment benefit (im proved anti-tumor efficacy and c omplete tumor regression) was 
observed in a syngeneic mouse tumor model by priming the anti-ca ncer immune response with 
abemaciclib in a phased administration of abemaciclib and an an ti-PD-L1 therapy.12Therefore, an 
additional phased therapy arm has been added for each CDK4/6 inhibitor to explore possible 
treatment benefit in patients.
The aim of the CA2097A8 study is to assess the potential synerg istic activity of nivolumab, with 
palbociclib, and anastrozole in participants with newly diagnos ed, previously untreated primary 
ER+, HER2- BC ≥2 cm, defined by significantly improved RCB (0-I) rate.  
 
 
Additional objectives of the study include char acterization of safety and 
tolerabilit  
.  
3.1.1 Research Hypothesis
The combination of nivolumab, with palbociclib, and anastrozole  is a safe and effective 
neoadjuvant treatment for patients with ER+, HER2- primary BC ≥2c m .
3.2 Background
3.2.1 ER+/HER2- Breast Cancer
BC ranks second as a cause of cancer death in women after lung cancer.13An estimated 42,260 
BC deaths (41,760 women) are exp ected in 2019 in the United Sta tes (US). In clin ical pr actice, 
BC tumors are classified by the expression status of estrogen r eceptor (ER), progesterone receptor 
(PgR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The  BC subtypes identified on the 
basis of these receptors have been reported to bear distinct ge ne expression profiles,14,15as well 
as different prognoses and treatm ent vulnerabilities. Seventy p ercent of invasive BC in 
women > 45 years of age express ER and/or PgR, but not HER2, and a re termed hormone 
receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-.16Seminal studies performed with gene expression profiling 
analysis of primary BC samples indicated that the tumors in the  HR+ group are characterized by 
the relatively high expression of genes related to luminal pheno type (ER-responsive genes, luminal 
cytokeratins, and other luminal-associated markers); consequently , HR+, HER2- BC was found to 
be significantly enriched with the so called luminal BC intrins ic subtypes, namely: luminal A 
(50-60% of all BC, showing higher dependence on ER signaling, s lower proliferation rate and 
overall more indolent clinical c ourse) and luminal B (15-20% of  all BC, showing lower 
dependence on ER signaling, higher proliferation rate, and overa ll, a more aggressive clinical 
course and worse prognosis, as compared to their luminal A counterparts).17

3.2.2 Neoadjuvant Endocrine Treatment
While, traditionally, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been used to d ownstage locally advanced and 
unresectable primary BC, a number of studies have highlighted t he role of neoadjuvant endocrine 
treatment (NET) as an alternative option to chemotherapy in pati ents with HR+, HER2- primary 
tumors,18particularly for postme nopausal women. Available data suggest that NET is associated 
with similar response rates and rates of breast-conserving surg ery (BCS) as neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, albeit with lower toxicity in postmenopausal women  with HR+ BC.18,19,20,21,22For 
postmenopausal women receiving NET, the administration of an ar omatase inhibitor (AI) is 
recommended instead of tamoxifen, based on evidence suggesting improved outcomes for women 
treated with AIs across clinical trials and meta-analyses.21,23,24,25, 26,27,28,29Similar clinical 
outcomes (rate of BCS) in the neoadjuvant setting among the AIs  were observed in 
377 postmenopausal women with Stag e II or III strongly ER+ BC who were randomly assigned to 
treatment with exemestane, letrozole, or anastrozole for 16-18 weeks before surgery in the 
American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z1031 tria l.28
3.2.3 Nivolumab Mechanism of ActionCancer immunotherapy rests  on the premise that tumors can be recognized as foreign rather than 
as self and can be effectively attacked by an activated immune system. An effective immune 
response in this setting is thought to rely on immune surveilla nce of tumor antigens expressed on 
cancer cells that ultimately results in an adaptive immune resp onse and cancer cell death. 
Meanwhile, tumor progression may depend upon acquisition of tra its that allow cancer cells to 
evade immune surveillance and escape effective innate and adapt ive immune responses.
30,31,32
Current immunotherapy efforts attempt to break the apparent tol erance of the immune system to 
tumor cells and antigens by eith er introducing cancer antigens by therapeutic vaccination or by 
modulating regulatory checkpoints of the immune system. T cell stimulation is a complex process 
involving the integration of numerous positive as well as negat ive co-stimulatory signals in 
addition to antigen recognition by the T- cell r eceptor (TCR).33Collectively, these signals govern 
the balance between T-cell activation and tolerance.
PD-1 is a member of the cluster of differentiation 28 (CD28) fam ily of T cell co-s timulatory 
receptors that also includes CD28, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), 
inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS), and B- and T-lymphocyte att enuator (BTLA).34PD-1 
signaling has been shown to inhibit CD28-mediated upregulation of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, 
IL-13, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and B- cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL). PD-1 expression has also 
been noted to inhibit T cell activation and expansion of previo usly activated cells. Evidence for a 
negative regulatory  rol e of  PD-1 com e s  from  studi es of  PD-1 def icient mice, which develop a 
variety of autoimmune phenotypes.35These results suggest that PD-1 blockade has the potential 
to activate anti-self T-cell res ponses, but these responses are v ariable and dependent upon a h ost 
genetic factors. Thus, PD-1 deficiency or inhibition is not acc ompanied by a universal loss of 
tolerance to self-antigens.

BMS-936558 nivolumab
In vitro, nivolumab (BMS-936558) binds to PD-1 with high affini ty (half-maximal effective 
concentration [EC50] 0.39-2.62 nM), and inhibits the binding of PD-1 to its ligands PD-L1 and 
PD-L2 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] ±1 nM). Nivolumab binds specifically to 
PD-1 and not to related members of the CD28 family such as CD28 , ICOS, CTLA-4, and BTLA. 
Blockade of the PD-1 pathway by nivolumab results in a reproduc ible enhancement of both 
proliferation and IFN-γ r elease in the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Usi ng a cytomegalovirus 
(CMV) re-stimulation assay with human peripheral bl ood m ononuclear cells (PBMCs), the effect 
of nivolumab on antigen-specific recall response indicates that  nivolumab augmented IFN-γ 
secretion from CMV-specific memory T cells in a dose-dependent manner vs isotype-matched 
control. In vivo blockade of PD-1 by a murine analog of nivolum ab enhances the anti-tumor 
immune response and results in tumor rejection in several immuno competent mouse tumor models 
(MC38, SA1/N, and PAN02).36
3.2.4 CDK 4/6 Inhibitors and Mechanism of Action
Cell cy cle progression is regulated by cyclin-dependent serine-threonine protein kinases. 
Extracellular growth and adhesion signals increase the level an d function of cyclin D pro teins 
within the cell. In turn, the cyclin D proteins associate with and activate CDK4 and CDK6.37CDK4 
and CDK6 phosphorylation leads to inactivation of the Rb protei n and thus releases E2F, which in 
turn leads to the transcription initiation of proteins involved in cell cycle propagation and 
proliferation. 
The luminal A and B subtypes of BC (85% of which are ER+, HER2-) have high rates of 
cyclin D/CDK activation; in the luminal A and B subtypes, cyclin  D1 (CCND1) amplifications 
were observed in 29% and 58%, and CDK4 amplifications were obser ved in 14% and 25%, 
respectively.38,39Luminal A subtype tumors also have loss of CDKN2A, which encode s 
p16INK4A, a CDK inhibitor.40The luminal subtypes also maintain expression of Rb, which is 
essential for benefit from treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor.41
Dysregulation of cell cycle ch eckpoints is common in BC, and in  all cancers in general, and may 
have clinical and therapeutic significance. For example, patien ts with HR+ BC exhibiting a gene 
expression signature of Rb loss had a shorter recurrence-free s urvival following adjuvant 
tamoxifen.42A tumor gene e xpression signature of E2F activation is also associated with h igher 
residual tumor cell proliferation following neoadjuvant AI ther apy. Therefore, activation of the 
CDK4/6-Rb-E2F pathway promotes endocrine resistance, and treatm ent with a CDK4/6 inhibitor 
or knockdown of CDK4 expression leads to reactivation of Rb, bi nding back of E2F and 
subsequent cell cycle arrest thus abrogating endocrine-resistan t cell proliferation. A seminal 
preclinical study exploring 47 human BC cell lines reported tha t palbociclib monotherapy was 
active in luminal BC cell lines compared to non-luminal BC cell s lines, and that palbociclib 
potentiated tamoxifen and trastuzumab activity in ER+ and human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2-positive (HER2+) BC cell lines, respectively.43

3.2.5 Clinical Experience with Nivolumab
The overall clinical safety experience with nivolumab, as eithe r monotherapy or in combination 
with other therapeutics, is based on experience in approximatel y 17,700 participants.3Nivolumab 
monotherapy is approve d in multiple regions, including the US a nd Europe (EU), for unresectable 
or metastatic melanoma, previously treated metastatic non-small  cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 
previously treated advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) , previously treated relapsed or refractory 
classical Hodgkin lymphoma, previously treated advanced or meta static urothelial carcinoma, and 
for the treatment of previously treated recurrent or metastatic  squamous cell carcinoma of the head 
and neck (SCCHN); it is also approved for previously treated co lorectal cancer (CRC), previously 
treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the adjuvant treatm ent of melanoma in the US. In 
addition, nivolumab has been approved for use in combination wi th ipilimumab for  RCC in the 
US and unresectable melanoma in multiple countries, including t he US and EU.3
In 39 patients with BC, nivolumab alone or in combination with ipilimumab were tolerable without 
additional safety signal detected in the CheckMate 32 study (unp ublished data). In 66 patients with 
metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), nivolumab with or without various induction 
therapies (radiation therapy, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, or dox orubicin) demonstrated ORRs
from 17% without induction therapy to 35% with doxorubicin indu ction therapy (TONIC trial).44
An additional 37 clinical trials of nivolumab alone or in combi nation treating patients with BC are 
currently ongoing (eg, ClinicalTrials.gov: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], NCT037891 10, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).
Details on the clinical safety and PK profile of nivolumab, inc luding results from other clinical 
studies, are summarized in the nivolumab IB.3
3.2.6 Clinical Experience with CDK 4/6 Inhibitors and Endocrine TherapyThe clinical development of second generation, CDK4/6-selective  inhibitors, namely palbociclib, 
abemaciclib, and ribociclib, led to practice-changing results in  the setting of advanced HR+, 
HER2- BC. In combination with aromatase inhibitors in the first-l ine setting and fulvestrant in the 
second-line setting, CDK4/6 inhibitors not only significantly inc reased ORR and prolonged
progression-free survival (PFS),
45but also achieved clinically meaningful overall survival (OS) 
benefit from treatment combining palbociclib and fulvestrant, a lbeit not statistically significant.46
In addition, single-ag ent abemaciclib demonst rated an ORR of 19.7% in heavily pretreated patients 
with refractory HR+, HER2- metastatic BC.47Selective CDK4/6 inhibitors are currently assessed 
in early-stage HR+, HER2- primary BC (neoadjuvant and adjuvant s etting) as well as other BC 
subtypes. In the neoadjuvant setting, the combination of palboc iclib and letrozole markedly 
enhanced the suppression of malignant cell proliferation as ass essed by Ki67, a marker of cellular 
proliferation, but did not substantially increase the clinical response of primary ER+ BC over a 
14-week period.48,49Therefore, novel combinations are needed in this setting to opt imize efficacy.
Details on the clinical safety and PK profile of palbociclib, i ncluding results from other clinical 
studies, are summarized in its respective product label.4

3.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
Based on preclinical and clinical  data, treatment of nivolumab a nd palbociclib in combination with 
endocrine therapy (ET) is expected to be tolerable and toxicitie s of the treatment are expected to 
be manageable and reversible upon dose reduction, treatment int erruption, or discontinuation.
Participants in this study will be carefully monitored for key toxicities. Risks will be further 
minimized by adherence to inclusi on/exclusion selection criteri a (see Section 6 [Study 
Population]), avoidance of prohibited medication (see Section 7.7 [Concomitant Therapy]), close 
safety monitoring (see Section 9.2 [Adverse Events], Section 9.2.9 [Management Algorithms for 
Nivolumab], and Section 9.4 [Safety]), and dose adjustment guidelines (see Section 7.4 [Dosage 
Modification]). These will also be clearly discussed and highlig hted during site visits. 
A Study Steering Committee (SSC; see Section 5.1.4.1 [Study Steering Committee]) will be 
established comprising of Investigators and BMS personnel parti cipating in the trial to ensure 
transparent management of the trial according to the protocol. A BMS Safety Management Team 
will review and evaluate all emerging data across the program for potential safety signal 
assessment in a timely manner.
More d etailed information a bout the known and expected benefits  and risks and reasonably 
anticipated adverse events (AE s) of study treatm ents may be found in the IB,3Patient Information 
Leaflet, Package Insert,1,2,4, 50Development Safety Update Report, or Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC).Due to the need to develop improved therapies to reverse or del ay resistance to current ET in ER+, 
HER2- BC, and on the basis of the clinical and nonclinical data i n support of the current study, 
BMS feels that the benefit-risk profile of nivolumab in combina tion with palbociclib and 
anastrozole in men and postmenopausal women with ER+, HER2- early- stage BC is favorable for 
proceeding with the proposed rando mized Phase 2 clinical trial. As of Protocol Revision 03, the 
benefit-risk profile of the abemaci clib-containing combination i s no longer considered favorable; 
thus BMS will not move forward with randomization to nivolumab in combination with 
abemaciclib and anastrozole (see Section 5.1 ).
3.3.1 Nivolumab Safety Profile
Overall, the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy is managea ble and generally consistent 
across completed and ongoing clinical trials with no maximum to lerated dose reached at any dose 
tested up to 10 mg/kg. Most AEs were low-grade (Grade 1 to Grad e 2) with relatively few related 
high-grade (Grade 3 to Grade 4) AEs. There was no pattern in th e incidence, severity, or causality 
of AEs with respect to nivolumab dose level.
A pattern of immune-related AEs has been defined, for which mana gement algorithms have been 
developed; these are provided in Appendix 6 . Most high-grade events were manageable with the 
use of corticosteroids or hormone replacement therapy (endocrinopathies) as instructed in these 
algorithms.

3.3.2 CDK 4/6 Inhibitor and Endocrine Therapy Combination Safety Profile
Overall, the safety profile of palbociclib monotherapy, as well as in combination with ET is
manageable and generally consistent across completed and ongoin g clinical trials.
For palbociclib, the most commo n adverse reactions (incidence ≥10%) were neutropenia, 
infections, leukopenia, fatigue, nausea, stomatitis, anemia, al opecia, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, 
rash, vomiting, decreased appetite, asthenia, and pyrexia.4
For anastrozole:
•In the early BC study (ATAC), the most common (incidence of > 10%)  side effects were hot 
flashes, asthenia, arthritis, pain, arthralgia, pharyngitis, hy pertension, depression, nausea and 
vomiting, rash, osteoporosis, fractures, back pain, insomnia, h eadache, peripheral edema, and 
lymphedema, regardless of causality.2
•In the advanced BC studies, the most common (> 10%) side effects were hot flashes, nausea, 
asthenia, pain, headache, back pain, bone pain, increased cough , dyspnea, pharyngitis, and 
peripheral edema.2
Extensive details on the safety profile of palbociclib and anast rozole are availab le in the Patient
Information Leaflet, Package Insert, or SmPC.
3.3.3 CDK4/6 Inhibitor and Nivolumab Combination Safety Profile
The safety profile of nivolumab is w ell characterized and manageable when administered alone or 
in combination with other treatments, including regimens where i t is administered in combination 
with chemotherapy, targeted agents, as w ell as additional IO products. In a Phase Ib study, the 
combination of pembrolizumab (a PD-1 inhibitor with similar saf ety profile) and abemaciclib at 
Food & Drug Administr ation (FDA)-approved doses of the respectiv e agents demonstrated a 
manageable safety profile, with a confirmed ORR of  28.6% in 28 h eavily pretreated participants
with metastatic BC (HR+, HER2- subtype)11
In a Phase 2 study of pembrolizu mab, palbociclib  and letrozole ( AI) in patients with metastatic 
ER+, HER2- BC ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), of 20 patients treated with the tripl e combination, Grade 3 
pneumonitis was reported in 1 patient during the DLT assessment  period. The median follow up 
for this study was 13.7 months (95% CI 6.4-16.9) and progressio n-free survival (PFS) has not been 
reached.51Also in a phase 1 study exploring safety and efficacy of aveluma b, palbociclib and

5 STUDY DESIGN
5.1 Overall Design
This randomized, open-label Phase 2 study was to evaluate whethe r the combination of nivolumab, 
with abemaciclib or palbociclib, plus anastrozole is a safe and effective neoadjuvant treatment for 
men and postmenopausal women with primary BC ≥2 cm that is ER+ and HER2- subtype who 
are suitable to receive NET and willing to undergo SOC breast s urgery after completion of the 
study treatment. 
On 6-Mar-2020, Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) decided to permanentl y discontinue enrollment and 
dosing in the nivolumab + abemaciclib + anastrozole cohorts of t he CA2097A8 study during the 
Safety Run-in Phase.  
 
 
 
 
At implementation of Revised Protocol 03, the study will only evaluate whether the combination of 
nivolumab, with palbociclib, plus anastrozole is a safe a nd effective neoadjuvant tr eatment for men 
and postmenopausal w omen with primary BC ≥2 cm that is ER+ and HER2- subtype who are 
suitable to receive NET and willing to undergo SOC breast surgery  after completi on of the st udy 
treatment. Participants must have histologically confirmed invas ive breast carcinoma meeting the 
characteristics described in Section 6.1 (Inclusion Criteria). Participants in screening and not yet 
treated were offered the option to join the safety lead-in of the nivolumab + palbociclib + 
anastrozole arm. Participants on treatment with nivolumab + abem aciclib + anastrozole were to be 
re-consented and continue on anastrozole alone, OR taken off st udy. In addition, baseline chest X-
ray and periodic pulse oximetry are implemented to monitor ILD/ pneumonitis in patients who will 
be treated with nivolumab + palbociclib + anastrozole.The study is divided into 3 periods: Screening Period, On-treat ment Pre-surgery (neoadjuvant) 
Period (Safety Run-in Phase and Randomized Phase), and Safety F ollow-up Period.
The study started with a Safety Run-in Phase for the combination  of nivolumab, w ith abemaciclib 
or palbociclib, plus anastrozole and will begin the Randomized Ph ase after the regimen is 
determined to be safe. Participants in the Safety Run-in Phase will move to the Safety Follow-up 
Period upon completion of the neoadjuvant treatment or upon dis continuation. Potential needs for 
additional enrollment or for dos e de-escalation w ill be discuss ed with Investigators and BMS 
during the Safe ty Run-in Phase. Once a safe dose for the regimen has been determined by BMS in 
collaboration with Investigators, the Randomized Phase of the s tudy will begin.
In the Randomized Phase, participants will be randomly assigned  by an IRT system to 3 different 
treatment arms and stratified by the following factors:

 2) evaluation of l ymph nodes (cytologically positiv e vs radiologically or 
cytologically negative); and 3) tumor size (> 3 cm or ≤3 cm).
For both the Safety Run-in Phase and Randomized Phase, particip ants will be tr eated for a 
maximum of 5 cycles (1 cycle = 4 weeks). Participants with prog ressive disease prior to 
completion of the 5-cycle study treatment must discontinue all study drugs and proceed to the 
Safety Follow-up Period. Participants who permanently discontin ue the study drugs for any reason 
are considered to have completed the On-treatment Pre-surgery ( neoadjuvant) Period, and hence 
reach end of tr eatment (EOT). After Cy cle 5 or EOT, p articipants must co ntinue to receive 
anastrozole (as concomitant medication and not as study treatme nt) until subsequent SOC breast 
surgery. Followi ng the completion of neoadjuvant tr eatment, all participants who remain operative 
candidates will undergo definitive surgery for BC within 4 week s of the last neoadjuvant tr eatment 
administration. If anastrozole can no longer be administered aft er EOT, participants will go to 
breast surgery right away. Pre-surgical lymph node biopsy is no t allowed. Information on the type 
of the surgery will be collected and recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF). Surgical
specimens will be collected for the analyses outlined in the pr otocol. Depending on treatment 
assignment, up to 2 safety follow- up visits will be conducted in person. The first safety follow- up 
visit (FU1) will be comp leted for all participants within 30 days ( ±7 days) from the last study 
treatment (oral or intravenous [IV ], whichever occurs later). The second safety follow-up visit 
(FU2) will occ ur approximately within 100 days ( ±7 days) from the last dose of nivolumab and 
will be required fo r participants in the Safety Run-in Phase and participants rand omized to Arms 
A or B in the Randomized Phase. Further planned treatment of par ticipants in the adjuvant setting 
(ie, radiotherapy, endocrine treatment, chemotherapy or any othe r treatment mod ality) will be at 
the discretion of the treating physician, following local clini cal guidelines, and collected in the 
appropriate eCRF.

5.1.1 Screening Period
Participants will provide written informed consent to participate in the study be fore completing 
any protocol-specified procedures or evaluations not considered  to be part of the participants’ 
standard care. After signing the informed consent form (ICF), p articipants will be evaluated for 
entry criteria and be enrolled into Interactive Response Techno logy (IRT). The screening 
assessments are shown in Table 2-1 .
Participants must provide a pretreatment (baseline) tumor tissu e, which must be either in FFPE 
tissue block containing 20 mm3 of tissue collected ≤90 days prior to enrollment (strongly 
preferred) or unstained tumor tissue sections (22 unstained slide s) sectioned ≤60 days prior to 
enrollment from a ti ssue sample collected ≤90 days prior to enrollment from primary tumor lesion. 
If a recent tumor specimen is not available, a  fresh tumor biop sy (containing 20 mm3 of tissue) is 
required. At least 15 unstained slides must be submitted for a pa rticipant to be eligible. If < 15
unstained slides are available, the participant is not eligible . Submit samples to the designated 
central laboratory with an associated pathology report.  
Safety Run-in participants: Participant can start study treatme nt before confirmation of receipt of 
the tumor sample by the central laboratory. However, receipt of  the tumor sample by the central 
laboratory must occur within 28 days of the first dose.
Randomized participants:  
 Documen tation of tumor size a nd node status (cytologically positive vs  
radiologically or cytol ogically negative) must be provided to I RT prior to randomization.
 
The Screening Period for each participant ends with the confirmat ion of full eligibility of the 
participant or with the confirmat ion that the participant is a screen failure. This study permits the 
re-enrollment of a participant that has discontinued the study as a pretreatment failure
(ie, participant has not been randomized [or treated in the Safe ty Run-in Phase]). If re-enrolled, 
the participant must be re-consented.
5.1.2 On-treatment Pre-surgery (neoadjuvant) Period
A schedule of on-treatment visi ts and assessments is provided in Table 2-2.
5.1.2.1 Safety Run-in PhaseAs of Revised Protocol 03, Cohort 1 w ill be discontinued. Participants in screening and not yet 
treated were offered the option t o join the nivolumab + palbocic lib + anastrozole arm. Participants 
on treatment were to be re-consented and continue on anastrozole  alone, OR taken off study.
The Safety Run-in Phase will be conducted in advance of the Ran domized Phase to evalu ate the 
safety and tolerability of the combinatio n of nivoluma b, with palbociclib, plus anastrozole, which 
will be administered during the Randomized Phase.

Participants will r eceive palbociclib in combination with nivolumab plus anastrozol e (Cohort 2) 
for 5 cycles as neoadjuvant therapy and be followed up for safe ty (see Section 5.1.3 [Safety 
Follow-up Period]). . For the purpose of guiding alternative dos e levels, all AEs will be gra ded 
according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Termino logy Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) v5.0 and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be defined based on the incidence, 
intensity, and duration of the AEs for which no clear alternati ve cause is identified. For the purpose 
of participant management, any drug-related AE that meets DLT c riteria will lead to 
discontinuation of s tudy treatment.
Participants who have discontinued due to a DLT or who have rec eived 1 dose of nivolumab and 
75% of accumulative  doses of palbo ciclib of the cycle, and have completed the 4-week DLT period 
will be considered as DLT-evaluable participants. Participants w ho withdraw from the study 
during the DLT evaluation period or have received less than 1 dose of nivolumab and 75% of 
accumulative doses of palbociclib of the cycle for reasons othe r than a DLT will not be considered 
as DLT-evaluable participants and may be replaced with new participants at the same dose level. 
Dose De-escalation Rules
For Cohort 2, 3 DLT-evaluable participants will be treated with  the below starting doses:
•Nivolumab: 480 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) intravenously (IV)
•Palbociclib 125 mg once daily (QD) PO for 3 weeks of each cycle (1 week off)
•Anastrozole: 1 mg QD PO
If no participants (0 of 3 DLT-ev aluable participants) experience  a DLT during the DLT period 
(4 weeks), the Randomized Phase will be initiated at this dose le vel. If 1 evaluable participant
(1 of 3 DLT-evaluable participants) experiences DLT, then the coho rt will be expanded to 
6 DLT-evaluable participants. If no more DLTs are observed (1 of 6  DLT-evaluable participants), 
then the Randomized Pha se will be initiated at the dose level te sted. If 1 or more additional 
evaluable participants (2 of 6 DLT-evaluable participants) experiences DLT during the DLT 
period, a lower dose w ill be tested using the same 3 + 3 schema. See Figure 5.1.2.1-1 for an 
overview of the 3 + 3 approach to be used for the Safety Run-in P hase.

Generally, if a cohort is discontinued due to DLT of unclear re levance to nivolumab, a lower dose 
level of CDK4/6 inhibitor per product label will be tested in t he next cohort. See Section 7.4
(Dosage Modification) for additional details on permitted dose adjustment. If a cohort is 
discontinued due to DLT related to nivolumab, a different dose or dose schedule will be explored 
per Investigator and Medical Monit or discussion. 
For cohort expansion or dose de-escalation decisions, the available t oxicity information (including
AEs and laboratory abnormalities  that are not DLTs), clinical judgme nt  
will be e valuated by the Investigators a nd BMS study personnel
(including the Medical Monitor and statistician) during a dose d ecision meeting b y teleconference.
Drug administration at the next dose level or proceeding to the Rand omized Phase must not occur

previous dose level were evaluated and that it is permissible to proceed.

5.5 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
5.5.1 Rationale for the Choice of Patient Population
Men or postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed, histologically  proven ER+, HER2- primary 
BC≥2 cm who are eligible for NET will be included in the study p opulation. Due to the low 
pathological complete response (pCR) rate, there remains an unm et medical need in this patient 
population.
Historically, NET has been offered to women with H R+ tumors who are unfit for surgery or refuse 
this procedure, or to elderly women with short life expectancy, as established by a qualified 
specialist and based on a validated geriatric assessment tool. NET has also been used to reduce 
tumor size and third-generation aromatase inhibitors increased l ikelihood of breast conserving 
surgery to 36-45%. In patients with a low recurrence score, NET demonstrated a clinical response 
rate of 59% and a BCS rate of 91%. NET not only confers clinical benefit to patients with HR+, HER2 - BC but also provides important 
prognostic information and is an excellent platform for the development of investigational drugs, 
triaging of novel combinations,  and disco very of mechanisms of drug 
resistance. Several key mechanisms of action have been assessed  in the neoadjuvant space in an 
exploratory setting, where results from metastatic trials mirro r those from their respective 
neoadjuvant trials (ie, mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR] block ade + endocrine therapies,
53
phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) blockade + endocrine therapies,54,55and CDK4/6 blockade plus 
endocrine therapies49,56,57,58). Those examples suggest that know ledge gained from NET studie s 
provide information to predict if a new combination is likely t o be successful in large adjuvant or 
metastatic Phase 3 trials. We anticipate that the current study may help to focus the development

of the combination of nivolumab, palbociclib, and anastrozole fo r use in patients with BC that is 
ER+ and HER2-.
5.5.2 Rationale for Choice of Endpoint (Residual Cancer Burden 0-I Rate)
There are lack of clinical endpoints predictive of event-free sur vival after NET in the HR+, HER2-
primary BC setting, since pCR is uncommon and is not an effective  surrogate of long-term 
outcome for this tumor type. Failure to achieve a pCR does not imply poor patient outcome since 
these patients still receive 5-10 years of adjuvant ET. Additio nally, many patients with HR+, 
HER2- BC are likely cured with local treatment and standard adju vant ET, which is also informed 
by several well validated prognostic gene signatures. For patients who did not achieve pCR, RCB 
is a type of pathological response quantification for the exten t of residual disease with the RCB 
index evaluating 5 post-treatment variables: 2-dimensional tumo r bed, cellularity, percentage of 
carcinoma in situ, number of metastatic lymph nodes, and the di ameter of the largest nodal 
metastases. The RCB index classifies the surgical specimen into 4 categories that include RCB-0
(pCR), RCB-I (minimal residual disease), RCB-II (moder ate residual dis ease), and RCB-III 
(extensive residual disease), a nd predicts risk of relapse after  neoadjuvant chemotherapy to be 
highest for RCB-III (53.6%), wh ile s imilar for RCB-0 and RCB-I ( 2.4% and 5.4%, 
respectively).59,60RCB (0-I) determined by local site pathologists was also prognostic fo r better 
long-term survival after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in all subtyp es of BC.61,62Hence, RCB index 
is increasingly used in NET studies  
. In addition, a RCB (0-I) rate endpoin t can be assessed within several 
months of initiation of an investigational drug in the neoadjuvant setting that could potentially address an unmet need in a far shorter time frame than would be required via the conventional 
approach to BC drug development. Use of this surrogate endpoint is expected to innovate the 
development of novel therapies for BC.
5.5.3 Rationale for CDK 4/6 Plus PD-1 Inhibition
PD-1 inhibition prevents interaction with the receptors PD-1 and  B7-1 (a costimulatory 
cell-surface protein), reversing T- cell s uppression and leading to tumor response. The PD-1 
inhibitor pembrolizumab as a single agent led to ORR of 12% (3/ 25) in heavily pretr eated p atients 
with ER+ BC that was also PD-L1 positive. In combination with che motherapy, pembrolizumab 
improved pCR rates in all HER2- BCs in the neoadjuvant setting.
5Several preclinical studies point 
towards PD-1/CDK4/6 blockade synergy as it has become more appa rent that CDK4/6 inhibitors 
affect the tumor immune microenvironment.6Within tumor cells, selective CDK4/6 inhibitors 
increase expression of PD-L1 th rough the E3 ligase adapter prot ein, Speckle-type POZ protein 
(SPOP),7and enhance antigen presentation via reduced activity of the E2 F target, 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase 1 (DNMT).8Secretion of cytokines from both 
tumor and CD8+ T cells is also enhanced with CDK4/6 inhibitor t reatment,9,10whereas 
proliferation of immunosuppressive Tregs is suppressed.8In murine models of BC, selective 
CDK4/6 inhibitors promote anti-tumor immunity via indirect stimulation of type III interferon 
(IFN) production and enhancing tumor antigen presentation, plus suppression of the proliferation

of Tregs.8,10In addition, tr eatment with the CDK4/6 inhib itor abemaciclib alone resulted in tumor 
growth delay that was associated with an increased T-cell infla mmatory signature in tumors. 
Combination of a CDK4/6 inhibitor with an anti-PD-(L)1 therapy led to complete tumor regression 
and immunological memory, accompanied by enhanced antigen prese ntation, a T- cell inf lamed 
phenotype, and enhanced cell-cycle control.63
Clinically, in a Phase Ib study, the combination of pembrolizum ab and abemaciclib demonstrated 
a confirmed ORR of 28.6% in heavily pretreated participants with  metastatic HR+, HER2- BC.11
In agreement with the previously mentioned preclinical data indicating CDK4/6 blockade as a 
mediator of the cancer immunity, ab emaciclib alone or in combi nation with anast rozole has been 
associated with upregulation of gene expression signatures related to T-cell immune response and 
antigen presentation in the neoMONARCH study, where 10-16 paired samples in each arm were 
examined in the  primary disease setting.11Clinical data on combinations of other CDK4/6 
inhibitors with PD-(L)1 blocking agents are being generated in multiple clinical trials spanning 
from the neoadjuvant to metastatic settings (ClinicalTrials.gov:  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) .
The aim of CA2097A8 is to assess the potential synergistic acti vity of nivolumab, with palbo ciclib,
and anastrozole in participants with newly diagnosed, previously  untreated primary HR+, HER2-
BC≥2 cm, defined by significantly improved RCB (0-I) rate.  
 This trial is part of a broader effort to esta blish nivolumab as a SOC for the 
treatment of HR+, HER2- BC.
5.5.4 Rationale for Phased Therapy (Arm B)
Strategies to render the tumor micro-environment (TME) more susceptible to anti-PD(L)1 therapy 
has been investigated in a phase 2 study (TONIC trial) of 50 pa rticipants with metastatic TNBC 
who received palliative chemotherapy.44Priming the anti-cancer immune response with low-dose 
chemotherapy for 2 weeks or radiation therapy before starting n ivolumab resulted in a best 
objective response rate (ORR) of 24%. In CT26 syngeneic mouse t umor model, a phased 
administration of abemaciclib and an anti-PD-L1 therapy improve s anti-tumor efficacy and 
induced complete tumor regression.12In the same animal model, abemaciclib monotherapy 
induced intra-tumor immune inflammation on D13 and D20. In agre ement with the previously 
mentioned preclinical data indicating CDK4/6 blockade as a medi ator of cancer immunity, 
abemaciclib in combination with anastrozole has been associated  with upregulation of gene 
expression signatures related to T- cell imm une response and antigen presen tation in the 
neoMONARCH study, where 10-16 paired samples in each arm were e xamined in the primary 
disease.49We therefore chose to test a phased therapy approach in Arm B to  investigate whether 
additional treatment benefit will be  observed with these regimens.

5.6 Justification for Dose
5.6.1
Justification for Dose of Nivolumab
Nivolumab 480 mg Q4W infused over 30 minutes was FDA approved i n Mar-2018 for the majority 
of the nivolumab approved indications. The European Medicines A gency’s (EMA’s) Committee 
for Medicinal Products for Human Use has also recommended addin g  th e  opti o n  of  a  4 -week 
dosing schedule to the label for nivolumab for the treatment of  patients with advanced melanoma 
and previously treated RCC.
Nivolumab 480 mg Q4W infused ove r 30 minutes will be examined in combination with 
palbociclib and anastrozole in this study.5.6.2 Justification for Dose of CDK4/6 Inhibitors
Abemaciclib 150 mg BID PO or palbociclib 125 mg QD PO for 3 wee ks of each cycle (1 week 
off) were a pproved by FDA in Sep-2017 and Feb-2015 , respectively, and by EMA in Sep-2018 
and Nov-2016, respectively, in combination with ET for ER+, HER2 - BC, based on clinical safety 
and efficacy.
Abemaciclib 150 mg BID PO or palbociclib 125 mg QD PO for 3 week s of each cycle (1 week 
off) will  be examined in combination with nivolumab and anastroz ole in this study.
As of Revised Protocol 03, examination of abemaciclib + nivolumab + anastrozole will not be 
continued in this study.

assessed, as it represents the participant’s most current, clin ical state.
7 TREATMENT
Study treatment is defined as any investigational treatment(s),  marketed product(s), placebo, or 
medical device intended to be administered to a st udy participant acc ording to the st udy 
randomizatio n or treatment allocation.
Study treatment includes both Inve stigational [Medicinal] Produc t (IP/IMP) and 
Non-investigational [Medicinal] Product (Non-IP/Non-IMP) and ca n consist of the following:
•BMS-936558 (nivolumab)
•Abemaciclib
•Palbociclib
•Anastrozole
An IP, also known as an IMP in some regions, is defined a pharma ceutical form of an active 
substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a c linical study, including products 
already with a marketing author ization but used or assembled (f ormulated or packaged) differently 
than the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized indicatio n, or when used to gain further 
information about the authorized form.

bAfter 5 cycles or EOT, all participants should continue to recei ve anastrozole until breast surgery. Anastrozole is 
not considered study therapy beyond completion of Cycle 5 or EOT .
Randomized participants should begi n study treatment within 3 c alendar days of rando mization.
7.1.1 Nivolumab Dosing (Safety Run-in Cohorts and Randomized Phase 
Arms A and B)
Participants are to start nivolumab within 3 calendar days of r andomization.Participants will 
receive nivolumab at a dose of 480 mg as a 30-mi nute IV infusio n for a maximum of 5 cycles 
(maximum 4 cycles for Arm B).
Doses of nivolumab may be interrupted, omitted, or discontinued , depending on how well the 
participant tolerates the treatment. There w ill be no dose escalations or reductions of nivolumab 
allowed. For Q4W dosing cycles, participants may be dosed within a ±3-day window. 
If a participant cannot receive nivolumab within a ±3-day window, nivolumab must be omitted 
(skipped) for that cycle. If nivolumab is omitted, the other st udy medications may continue. If a 
participant discontinues nivolumab, the entire study treatment (CDK4/6 inhibitor and anastrozole) 
must be discontinued.When nivolumab is scheduled to be administered on the same day with palbociclib plus
anastrozole, nivolumab dosing should be started > 1 hour after palbociclib plus anastrozole 
ingestion. If nivolumab can not be given within 3 days of palboc iclib plus anastrozole 
administration for a given cycle, nivolumab must be omitted for t hat cycle. 
Premedications are not recommended for the first dose of nivolu mab.
Participants should be carefully monitored for infusion reactio ns during nivolumab a dministration. 
If an acute infusion reaction is noted, participants should be managed according to Section 7.4.4.3
(Treatment of Nivol umab Infusion Reaction). 
Instructions for dilution and infusion of nivolumab injection m ay be provided in the clinical 
protocol, pharmacy binder, or pharmacy reference sheet. Care mu st be taken to assure sterility of

7.1.2 CDK4/6 Inhibitors and Anastrozole Dosing
Premedications are not recommended for the first dose.
In the Safety Run-in Phase, participant assignment to abemacicl ib or palbociclib will be carefully 
managed by the study team with the Investigator. The selected CD K4/6 inhibitor cannot be 
changed or switched to another one once the study treatment has  been initiated. At implementation 
of Revised Protocol 03, the study will only evaluate the combin ation of nivolu mab with palbociclib 
plus anastrozole. Patients in screening and not y et treated were offered the option to join the nivolumab 
+ palbociclib + anastrozole arm. Patients on treatment were to b e re-consented and continue on 
anastrozole alone, OR taken off study. 
Study treatment must be taken within 3 calendar days following randomization.
In the Randomized Phase, participants will be randomly assigned by an IRT system.
Palbociclib should be taken together with anastrozole as follows :
•Palbociclib is dosed QD PO for the first 3 weeks of the cycle ( with the 4th week off). 
Anastrozole is dosed continuously, BID and QD PO, respectively.
•On scheduled visit days, partici pants must hold taking study tr eatments at home. They must 
take them in the clinic under the supervision of the Investigat or or designee after all st udy 
procedures for the visit have been completed. On all other days, participants may take st udy 
treatments at home.
•Participants should be instructed  to take palbociclib and anastr ozole with a large glass of water 
(~250 mL or ~8 oz) at the same time each day.
•Palbociclib should be administered with food. Anastrozole can b e administered either with or 
without food.
•Participants should be instructed to swallow the tablets whole a nd not to chew, crush, or open 
them.
•If vomiting occurs during the course of treatment, no re-dosing  of the participant is allowed 
before the next scheduled dose. The occurrence and frequency of  any vomiting during a 
treatment cycle must be noted i n the AEs secti on of the  eCRF. 
•Any doses that are missed (not taken within 6 hours of the inte nded time) s hould be s kipped 
and should not be replaced or made up on a subsequent day.
•Multivitamins, glucosamine, probiotics, and fish oil are permit ted. 
•After 5 cycles or EOT, all participants should continue to rece ive anastrozole until subsequent 
breast surgery. If anastrozole can no longer be administered af ter EOT (ie, due to related 
toxicities), breast surgery w ill be performed right away. Anastrozole is not considered stud y 
therapy beyond com pletion of Cycle 5 or EOT.

7.2 Method of Treatment Assignment
Before the study is initiated, each user wi ll receive log-in in formation and directions on how to 
access the IRT. Each participant will be assigned a unique part icipant number after signing the 
ICF. Participant numbers will be used on all participants’ stud y information. Participant numbers 
will not be reassigned. The Investigator or designee will regis ter the participant for enrollment by 
following the enrollment procedures established by BMS.
The following information is required for enrollment in the IRT:
•Date that informed consent was obtained
•Year of birth
•Gender at birth
Safety Run-in participants who have met all eligibility criteri a will be enro lled in the IRT.  
After the Safety Run-in Phase is complete (safet y of the combination is c onfirmed), randomization 
of participants to Arms A, B, and C can begin. 
The following information is required for participant randomiza tion:
•Participant number
•Year of birth
•Tumor characteristics (involvement of lymph nodes, tumor size at  baseline)
Participants meeting all eligibility criteria w ill be randomized in a 4:4:3 ratio and stratified by  
 2) involvement of lym ph node
(cytologically positive vs radiologically or cytologically nega tive), and 3) tumor size (> 3 cm or 
≤3c m ) .
The exact procedures for usi ng the IRT will be  detailed in the I RT manual. Study treatment w ill 
be dispensed at the study visits as listed in Section 2 (Schedule of Activities).
7.3 Blinding
This is a randomized, non-comparative, open-label study; blinding procedures are not applicable.
7.4 Dosage Modification
When assessing AEs, the Investigator must assign drug causality  to each study drug for each AE. 
If a reasonable determination cannot be made, then the AE shoul d be considered related to each of 
the study drugs. IO agents are associated with AEs that can diff er in severity and duration from 
AEs caused by other therapeutic classes. No dose re-escalation w ill be allowed.
Please refer to individual approved drug labels for recommendat ions on dose reduction, 
interruption or discontinuatio n of individual st udy drug s in the  management of study drug-related

adverse reactions. C linical judgment of the  treating physician s hould guide the management plan 
of each participant based on i ndividual benefit-risk assessment. However, for events requiring a 
discontinuation, treatment must be discontinued. Any changes to t he dose must be recorded on the
appropriate eCRF.
7.4.1 Dose Modifications for Abemaciclib
At the implementation of Revised Protocol 03, abemaciclib dosin g will be discontinued in all 
patients. 
7.4.2 Dose Modifications for Palbociclib
Palbociclib can be interrupted, reduced, or discontinued both with in a cycle and between cycles.
The dose modifications permi tted fo r palbociclib in combination with anastrozole are based on the 
dose level changes outlined in Table 7.4.2-1.
Table 7.4.2-1: Dose Levels for Palbociclib
Dose Level Oral Dose Frequency
Starting dose 125 mg QD ×3 weeks on (1 week off)
First dose reduction 100 mg QD ×3 weeks on (1 week off)
Second dose reduction 75 mg QD ×3 weeks on (1 week off)
Third dose reduction Discontinue Not applicable
Abbreviations: mg = milligram; QD = once daily.
7.4.3 Dose Modification for Anastrozole
No dose modification f or anastrozole is listed per full prescribing information.
7.4.4 Dose Modifications for Nivolumab
Participants who require a dose omission for nivolumab should b e re-evaluated and resume 
treatment at the next cycle when re-treatment criteria are met.  Drug-drug interaction between 
nivolumab and palbociclib are not expected. Nivolumab is a mono clonal antibody given IV, and 
is unlikely to cause any cytokine mediated changes in CYP isoen zymes.
7.4.4.1 Dose Omission Criteria for Nivolumab
Nivolumab administration should be omitted for the following:
•Grade 2 non-skin, drug-related AE, with the exception of fatigu e.
•Grade 2 drug-related creatinine, AST, ALT, and/or total bilirubi n abnormalities.
•Grade 3 skin, drug-related AE.
•Grade 3 drug-related laboratory abnormality, with the following  exceptions:
−Grade 3 lymphopenia or asymptomatic amylase or lipase does not require dose omission.
−Grade ≥3 AST, ALT, total bilirubin will require dose discontinuation ( see Section 8.1.1
[Nivolumab Dose Discontinuation]).

Investigator, warrants an omissio n of the  dose.
For the nivolumab omission criteria and criteria to resume trea tment, please refer to the nivolumab 
dose delay criteria in Appendix 6.
7.4.4.2 Criteria to Resume Treatment with Nivolumab
Participants may resume treatment with study treatment when the  drug-related AE(s) resolve to 
Grade ≤1 or baseline value, with the following exceptions:
•Participants may resume treatm ent in the presence of Grade 2 fa tigue.
•Participants who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug-related sk in AE may resume treatment 
in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity.
•For participants with Grade 2 AST, ALT, and/or total bilirubin a bnormalities, dosing may 
resume when laboratory values return to baseline and management  with corticosteroids, if 
needed, is complete.
•Drug-related pulmonary tox icity, dia rrhea or co litis must have r esolved to baseline before 
treatment is resumed. Participants with persistent Grade 1 pneu monitis after completion of a 
steroid taper over at least 1 month may be eligible for retreat ment if discussed with and 
approved by Med ical Monit or (or designee).
Participants with drug-related endocrinopathies adequately cont rolled with only  physiologic 
hormone replacement may resume treatment after consu ltation with the Medical Monitor (or 
designee). Adrenal insufficiency  requires discontinuation regar dless of control with hormone 
replacement.
7.4.4.3 Treatment of Nivolumab Infusion Reaction
Since nivolumab contains only human immunoglobulin protein sequ ences, it is unlikely to be 
immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensi tivity reactions. However, if such a reaction were 
to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headach e, rash, pruritus, arthralgias, 
hypotension, hypertension, bronchospasm, or other allergic-like reactions. All Grade 3 or 4 
infusion reactions should be re ported within 24 hours to the st udy Medical Moni tor and reported  
as a serious adverse event (SAE) if it meets the criteria. Infus ion reactions should be graded 
according to NCI CTCAE v5.0 guid elines.
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modifie d based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines, as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptoms (mild reaction; i nfusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated):
•Remain at bedside and monitor participant until recovery from sy mptoms occurs. The 
following prophylactic pre -medications are r ecommended for futu re infusions:

BMS-936558 nivolumab
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/para cetamol 325 to 1000 mg at 
least 30 minutes before subsequent nivolumab administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms: (moderate reaction required therapy or i nfusion inte rruption but responds 
promptly to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihis tamines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophylactic medications indicated for 
≤24 hours):
•Stop the study drug i nfusion, begin an IV infusio n of normal saline, and tr eat the participant
with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 
1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor participant un til resolution of symptoms. 
Corticosteroid and/or bronchodilator therapy may also be admini stered as appropriate. If the 
infusion is interrupted, then restart the i nfusion at 50% of the original infusion r ate when 
symptoms resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 min utes, the rate may be 
increased to 100% of the original infusion rate. Monitor partic ipant closely. If symptoms recur, 
then no further study medication will be administered at that v isit.
•For future infusions, the following prophylactic premedications are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equiv alent) and/or acetaminophen/para cetamol 325 to 1000 mg 
should be administered at least 30 minutes before nivolumab inf usions. If necessary, 
corticosteroids (up to 25 m g of hydrocortis one or equiv alent) may be used.
For Grade 3 or 4 symptoms : (severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [ie, not rapidly respons ive to 
symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of symptoms following 
initial improv ement; hospi talization indi cated for other clinical sequelae [eg, renal impairment, 
pulmonary infiltrates]. Grade 4: Life threatening; pressor or v entilatory support indicated):
•Immediately discontinue infusion of study d rug. Begin an IV i nfusion of normal saline and 
treat the participant as follows: Recommend bronchodilators, epi nephrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a 
1:1000 solution for subcutane ous administrati on or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution 
injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 5 0 mg IV with 
methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Partici pant should be monitored 
until the Investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will no t recur. Study drug w ill be 
permanently discontinued. Investigators should follow their ins titutional guidelines for the 
treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor partici pant until recovery of the 
symptoms.
In case of late-occurring hypersen sitivity symptoms (eg, appear ance of a localized or generalized 
pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, oral 
antihistamine or corticosteroids).
7.5 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
The IP should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is the responsibility of 
the Investigator to ensure that IP is only dispensed to study p articipants. The IP must be dispensed 
only from official study sites by authorized personnel accordin g to local regulations.

administered in the clinic by trained site pers onnel and drug ac countability should be reviewed by 
the site study staff. Sites should di scuss discrepancies with th e participant at each scheduled visit.
7.7 Concomitant Therapy
Concomitant medications, all forms of premed ications, and supportive care are recorded at 
baseline and throughout st udy tr eatment and safety follow-up in the appropriate section of the 
eCRF at each visit.
All medications (prescription and over-the-counter), vit amin and mineral s upplements, and/or 
herbs taken by the participant from Screening th rough the Safety Follow-up Period w ill be 
documented and recorded, including start and stop date, dose an d route of administration, 
frequency, and indication. Medications taken for a procedure (e g, biopsy) should also be included.
Anastrozole administered after completion of 5 cycles of neoadj uvant treatment (or EOT) up to 
subsequent breast surgery must be collected as concomitant medication.
Any subsequent anti-cancer therapy (ie, adjuvant treatment, rad iotherapy) will be recorded up to 
100 days after last dose of nivolumab or 30 days after last dos e of study treatment (Arm C), in the 
appropriate section of the eCRF.7.7.1 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments for Nivolumab
The following medications are prohibited during the study (unle ss utilized to treat a drug-related 
AE):
•Any live/attenuated vaccine (eg, varicella, zoster, yellow feve r, rotavirus, oral polio, and 
measles, mumps, rubella [MMR]) during treatment and until 100 d ays post last dose.
•Immunosuppressive agents.

•Supraphysiological doses of systemic corticosteroids.
•Any concurrent anti-neoplastic therapy (ie, chemotherapy, hormo nal therapy, immunotherapy, 
extensive, non-p alliative rad iation therapy , or standa rd or investigational agents for treatment 
of ER-, HER+ BC).
•Any botanical preparation (eg, herbal supplements or traditional  Chinese medicines) intended 
to treat the disease under s tudy or provide supportive care. Us e of marijuana and its derivatives 
for treatment of symptoms related to cancer or cancer treatment  are permitted if obtained by 
medical prescription or if its use (even without a medical pres cription) has been legalized 
locally.
7.7.2 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments for Abemaciclib and 
Palbociclib
•Anticancer agents: No additional investigational or commercial anticancer agents (i ncluding 
specifically aromatase inhibitors, anti-estrogens other than fu lvestrant, chemotherapy, and 
immunotherapy) other than those mentioned in this study w ill be permitted during the 
On-treatment Pre-s urgery (neoadjuvant) Period. In general, any drugs containing “for the 
treatment of breast cancer” on the product insert are not permi tted on the study. Additionally, 
use of megestrol acetate as an appetite stimulant is not permit ted.
•Strong CYP3A inhibitors/inducers and CYP substrates (refer to Appendix 10
[Concomitant Medications]): The results from human disposition (I3Y-MC-JPBD) and 
in vitro human r ecombinant CYP phenotyping studies indicate that  abemaciclib is extensively 
metabolized pr imarily via CYP3A. Co-administration with drugs that are CYP3A i nhibitors 
and inducers may change the plasma concentrations of abemacicli b in humans. 
−Co-administration with  strong CYP3A inhibitors and strong induce rs should be avoided 
while on treatment. Par ticipants treated with those drugs within  the last 5 days prior to 
randomization/study t reatment cannot be included in the tr ial. 
−Co-administration with moderate CYP3A inhibitors and moderate inducers should also be 
avoided if possible, or otherwise be subject to caution (eg, inc reased frequency of safety 
monitoring).
−CYP substrates: In vitro studies in cultured human hepatocytes indicate that ab emaciclib 
and its major metabolites LSN2839567 and LSN3106726 downregulate messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) of CYPs at clinically relevant concentrations. The mechanism of 
downregulation and its clinical relevance are presently not understood. Therefore, care 
should be taken when co-administering substrate drugs of CYPs ( CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A) with narrow therapeutic margi n. Participants
treated on CYP3A Substrates with Narrow Therapeutic Index (NTI) ca n only be included 
in the trial after discontinuation of the drug for longer than 5  half-lives prior to 
randomization/study treatment. 
•Herbal/alternative remedies: Participants are to avoid Seville oranges and grapefruit and 
grapefruit juice, as they affect CYP and PgP activity.

•Chronic immunosuppressive therapies: Chronic immunosuppressive therapies should be 
avoided, including systemic corticosteroids. Steroids given for  physiolo gical rep lacement, as 
anti-emetics, or inhaled, as well as s hort courses of ora l/topical steroids given for allergic 
reactions or asthma flares are allowed.
•Erythropoietin: Erythropoietin is  not to be used. Any potential indication should be discussed 
with the Investigator and the Sponsor.
7.7.3 Other Restrictions and Precautions
Participants with a condition requiring systemic treatment with  either corticosteroids at above 
physiolog ical replacement dose or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 d ays of 
randomization/study treatment are excluded.
7.7.3.1 Imaging Restriction and Precautions
It is the local imagi ng facility’s respons ibility to determine,  based on participant attributes 
(eg, allergy history, diabetic history , renal status), the a ppropriate imaging mo dality and contrast 
regimen per imaging study. Imaging contraindications and contrast risks are to be considered in 
this assessment. Participants with renal insufficiency are to be assessed as to whether or not they should receive contrast and, if so, which contrast agent and dos e is appropriate. Specific to 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), participants with severe rena l insufficiency (ie, estimated 
glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m
2) are at increased ris k of nephrogenic systemic 
fibrosis; therefore, M RI contrast is contraindicated. In addition , participants may be excluded from 
MRI if they have tattoos, metallic implants, pacemakers, etc. 
Gentle hydration before and after IV contrast should follow loc al SOC. The ultimate decision to 
perform MRI in an individual participant in this study rests wi th the site radiologist, the 
Investigator, and standards set by the local IEC.
7.7.4 Permitted Therapy
Participants are permitted the use of topical, ocular, intra-ar ticular, intranasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). A brief (le ss than 3 weeks) course of 
corticosteroids for prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or f or treatment of non-autoimmune 
conditions (eg, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by  a contact allergen) is permitted.
7.8 Treatment After the End of the StudyAt the end of the study, BMS will not continue  to provide BMS-s upplied study treatment to 
participants/Investigators unless BMS chooses to extend the stud y. The Investigator should ensure 
that the participant receives appropriate SOC to treat the condi tion under study.
BMS reserves the right to terminate access to BMS-supplied stud y treatment if a ny of the following 
occur:
1) The study is terminated due to safety concerns.
2) The development of the study tr eatment is termin ated for other reasons, including but not 
limited to lack of efficacy and/or n ot meeting the study  object ives.

8 DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA
Reasons for discontinuation (of treatment vs from study): Participants are expected to complete 
5 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy except in the event of disease progression, death, unacceptable 
toxicity, symptomatic deterioration, Investigat or’s decision to discon tinue treatment, the 
participant’s decision to discontinue treatment or withdraw consent, the participant being lost to 
follow-up, or BMS decides to terminate the study.
8.1 Discontinuation from Study Treatment
Participants MUST discontinue IP (and non-IP at the discretion of  the Investigator) for any of the 
following reasons:
•Participant’s request to stop study tr eatment. Par ticipants who request to discontinue study 
treatment w ill remain in the study and must continue to be followed for pr otocol specified 
follow-up procedures. The only exception to this is when a part icipant specifically withdraws 
consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously authorized by participant to 
provide this information
•Any clinical AE, laboratory abnorm ality or intercurrent illness which, in the opinion of the 
Investigator, indicates that continued participation in the stu dy is not in the best interest of the 
participant
•Termination of the study by BMS
•Loss of ability to fr eely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily inca rceration 
for treatment of eit her a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious dis ease) illness. (Note: Under 
specific circumstances, and only in countries where local regul ations permit, a participant who 
has been imprisoned may be permitted to continue as a participan t. Strict conditions apply and 
BMS approval is required.)
•Disease progression
Refer to Section 2 (Schedule of Activities) for data to be collected at the time of  treatment 
discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations t hat can be completed.
All participants who disc ontinue study treatment s hould comply with protocol specified follow-up 
procedures as outlined in S ection 2 (Schedule of Activities). The only exception to this re quirement 
is when a participant withdraws consent for all study proce dures including post-treatment study 
follow-up or los es the ability to consent freely (ie, is impris oned or involuntarily incarcerated for 
the treatment of either a psyc hiatric or physical illness).
If study treatment is discontinued prior to the participant’s co mpletion of the study, the reason for 
the discontinuation must be documented in the participant’s med ical records and en tered on the 
appropriate eCRF page.

and subsequent breast surgery must be performed right away.
8.1.5 Post-study Treatment Study Follow-up
Participants who discontinue st udy treatment must continue to b e followed per Table 2-3.
8.2 Discontinuation from the Study
Participants who request to discontinue study treatment will rem ain in the study and must continue 
to be followed for protocol sp ecified follow-up procedures. The  only exception to this is when a 
participant specifically withdraws consent for any further cont act with him/her or persons 
previously authorized by parti cipant to provide this information . 
•Participants should notify the Investigator of the decision to withdraw consent from future 
follow-up in writing, whenever possible.
•The withdrawal of consent shoul d be explained in detail in the m edical rec ords by the

are intended to be used as safety monitoring by the treating ph ysician. Additional testing or 
assessments may be performed as clinically necessary  or where required by institutional or lo cal 
regulations.
9.1 Efficacy Assessments
9.1.1 Blinded Independent Pathology Review
Blinded independent pathology review will be established for ce ntral review and central
assessment of RCB. Tumor and lymph node collection from definiti ve surgical resection  
 should be perform ed on the day of surgery. 
Processing of the remainder of the specimens for histopathologi c analysis should be performed 
within 72 hours of the procedure. Sections w ill be used for central pathology review assessing 
pathologic response. All hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides pre pared from the specimens that 
are reviewed locally must be sent for central pathology review,  along with a c opy of the comp leted 
pathology report. Diagnostic H&E slides are preferred, but recu t sections from all the tissue blocks 
are acceptable. Pathology samples acquisition guidelines and su bmission process will be outlined 
in the laboratory manual.
9.1.2 Pathologic Assessment of Effect
9.1.2.1 RCB DeterminationCentral RCB will be assessed from  routine pathologic sections o f the primary breast tumor site 
and the regional lymph nodes right after surgery . Five variables are included in 
a calculation formula, which includes the following:
1) The primary tumor bed area in its 2 dimensions. For multifocal  tumors (defined as the presence 
of 2 or more foci of cancer within the same breast quadrant), th e largest lesion must be ≥2 cm 
and designated as the “target” lesion for the RCB determination .
2) The overall cancer cellularity (percentage of area).
3) The percentage of cancer that is in situ disease (percentage of area).
4) The number of positive lymph nodes.5) The diameter of the largest lymph node metastasis.
The calculated RCB index value can also be categorized as 1 of 4 RCB classes. The calculation 
formula and detailed description can be found at a dedicated we bsite: 
http://www.mdanderson.org/breastcancer_RCB. The 4 RCB classes ar e the following:
1) RCB 0: no residual disease
2) RCB-I: minimal residual disease3) RCB-II: moder ate residual disease
4) RCB- III: extensive residual disease

9.1.2.2 Pathological Complete Response Determination
The determination of pCR will be performed by the local patholo gist following examination of 
tissue (breast and nodes) removed at the time of surgery. 
Criteria for evaluation of pCR includes the following: 
•pCR in breast and axillary lymph nodes as well as non-axillary s entinel node (pCR breast and
nodes).
•No histologic evidence of invasive tumor cells in the surgical breast specimen or axillary nodes 
after neoadjuvant treatment. 
•pCR in the breast (pCR breast). No histological evidence of inva sive tumor cells in the 
surgical breast.

linical Response Assessments
For the purposes of this study , all clinical res ponse assessments, including 1) clinical breast 
examination by palpati on of breast a nd axilla, and 2) imaging assessment of breast and axilla via
ultrasound (preferred) or mammography, will be assessed by the Investigator and performed 
locally. Every attempt should be made to image each participant using an identical imaging 
modality and acquisition protocol for all imaging time points. Tumor measurements s hould be

made by the same Investigator or Imager for each assessment, wh enever possible. Tumor 
assessments for all participants should continue per protocol, even if dosing is delayed or 
discontinued. The longest diameter (LD) of the initial lesion(s) wi ll be reported as the baseline 
measurement and used as reference to characterize the objective tumor response. The LD of the 
same lesion(s) will be measured during subsequent imaging studie s.
A best overall response of stable disease requires a minimum of 49 days on study from the first 
dose of treatment.
Screening and on-study images should be acquired as outlined in  Section 2 (Schedule of 
Activities). Tumor assessments at other time points may be perf ormed if clinically indicated.
Bone scans and other SOC imaging, including pathologic examinatio n of suspicious lesions, may 
be acquired per local standards, as clinically indicated.At the Sponsor’s discretion, images may be collected for review .
9.1.3.1 Objective Response Rate Assessed by Imaging
ORR will be assessed at the end of  the neoadjuvant treatment pri or to Surgery.
For the purposes of this study, tumor response assessments will  be performed by bilateral breast
and axilla ultrasound (preferred) or mammography. Changes in tum or measurements and tumor 
responses will be assessed by th e same Investigator or designee . The timepoint of tumor
assessments will be reported on the eCRF based on the Investigator’s assessment.
Radiographic Response Assessments:
•Radiographic complete response: Disappearance of the target les ion.
•Radiographic partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the LD of the target lesion
taking as reference the baseline LD.
•Radiographic progression (PD): At l east a 20% increase in the L D of target lesion taking as
references the baseline LD or the appearance of one or more new  lesions.
•Radiographic stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient
increase to qualify for PD taking as reference the baseline LD.
Note:
1) Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size ( lesions with the longest diameter)
and should lend themselves to repr oducible repeated measurements. Up to 2 lesions in the 
breast may be identified as target lesions. Per this protocol, target lesion #1 must be ≥2 cm
and, if selected, target lesion #2 must be ≥ 10 mm. A sum of the diameters of all target lesions
will be calculated and reported as the bas eline sum of d iameters. The baseline sum of diameters
will be used as a reference to  further characterize any objecti ve tumor regression in the
measurable dimension of the disease. Lesions that meet the crit eria for radiographically defined
simple cysts should not be considered malignant lesions (neithe r target nor non-target) since

they are, by definition, simple cysts. Pathologic axillary lymph  nodes are not to be designated
at target lesions, and lymph node measurements are not to be in cluded in the sum of diameters.
2) Target Lesions that become too small to measure: all lesions recorded at baseline should have
their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluatio n, even when very small (e.g.,
2 mm). However, somet imes lesions that are rec orded as target lesions at baseline become so
faint on imaging that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and
may report them as being too small to measure. When this occurs , it is important that a value
be recorded on the eCRF as follows:
−If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesio n has likely disappeared, the measurement
should be recorded as 0 mm.
−If the lesion is b elieved to be present and is faintly seen but too small to accu rately measure,
too small to measure should be indicated.
3) Assessments of partial respons e and complete response do not require confirmation. A best 
objective response of stable disease requires a minimum of 42 d ays on study from 
randomizatio n to the date of the follow- up imaging assessment.
For further information please refer to Appendix 8 (RECIST v1.1).
9.1.4 Breast Conserving Surgery Rate
BCS rate is defined as the number of participants who undergo BCS after completing the study 
treatments divided by the number of randomized participants for  each treatment group.
For this study, planned breast surgery (mastectomy or BCS) at t he time of diagnosis or baseline 
and the actual surgery patient undergo after completion of the study treatment will be captured on 
the eCRF to assess BCS rate with palbociclib plus anastrozole w ith or without nivolumab in 
participants with untreated primary BC ≥2 cm (ER+, HER2-).

dverse Events
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 3.
AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant's legally a uthorized repre sentative).
The Investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and re porting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain respo nsible for following up AEs that 
are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the s tudy, or that caused the participant to 
discontinue before completing the study.
Contacts for SAE reporting specified in Appendix 3.
9.2.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the IB represent the Reference Safet y Information to determine 
expectedness of SAEs for expedited reporting.
All SAEs must be collected from the time of signing the consent , including those thought to be 
associated with protocol-specif ied procedures and for a minimum of 100 days of discontinuation 
of nivolumab dosing. For particip ants randomized in Arm C, SAEs s hould be collected for 30 days 
from the date of last dose. For participants randomized/assigne d to treatment and never treated 
with study drug, SAEs s hould be collect ed for 30 days from the d ate of randomization/tr eatment 
assignment.

The Investigator must report any SAE that occurs after these ti me periods and that is believed to 
be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure (eg, a  follow-up skin biopsy).
•Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded on the appropriate section of the eCRF m odule.
•All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor or design ee within 24 hours, as indicated 
in Appendix 3 .
•The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponso r or designee within 24 hours
of updated information being available.
Investigators are not obligated  to actively seek AEs or SAEs in  former study participants. 
However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a dea th, at any time after a participant 
has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the eve nt reasonably related to the study 
treatment or study participation, the Investigator must promptl y notify the Sponsor.
The method of evaluating, and assessing caus ality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for 
completing and reporting/transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3.
9.2.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
AEs can be spontaneously re ported or elicited during open-ended questioning, examination, or 
evaluation of a participant. Care should be taken not to introduce bias when collecting AEs and/or 
SAEs. Inquiry about specific AEs should be guided by clinical judgement in the context of known 
AEs, when appropri ate for the program or protocol.
All non-serious AEs (not only those deemed to be treatment-rela ted) should be collected 
continuously during the On-tr eatment Pre-s urgery (neoadjuvant) Period and for a minimum of 
100 days following discontinuation of nivolumab. For participants  randomized in Arm C, non-
serious AEs should be collected for 30 days from the date of la st dose.
Every AE must be assessed by the Investigator with regard to whether it is considered 
immune-mediated. For events which  are potentially immune-mediat ed, additional information will 
be collected on the participant’s eCRF.
9.2.3 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
•Non-serious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilizati on, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (refer to Appendix 3).
•Follow-up is also required for non-serious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of 
study treatment and for those present at the end of study treat ment as appropriate.
• All identified non-serious AEs must be recorded and described on the non-serious AE page of 
the eCRF (paper or electronic). Completion of supplemental eCRF s may be requested for AEs 
and/or laboratory abnormalities t hat are reported/identified du ring the course of the study.
After the initial AE/SAE re port, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each p articipant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and non-serious AEs of  special interest (as defined in

Section 9.2 [Adverse Events]) will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until 
the event is otherwise explaine d, or until the participant is l ost to follow-up (as defined in 
Section 8.3 [Lost to Follow-up]).
Further informatio n on follow- up procedures is given in Appendix 3.
9.2.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
•Prompt notification by the Investigator to the Sponsor of SAEs is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a 
product under clinical investigation are met.
•An Investigator who receives an Investigator Safety Report desc ribing SAEs or other specific 
safety information (eg, su mmary  or listing of SAEs) from the S ponsor w ill file it along with 
the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
The Sponsor or designee will be reporting AEs to regulatory autho rities and IECs according to 
local applicable laws including European Directive 2001/20/EC a nd FDA Code of Federal 
Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 a nd 320. A SUSAR  (Suspected, Unexp ected Serious Adverse 
Reaction) is a subset of SAEs and will be reported to the appro priate regulatory authorities and 
Investigators following local and global guidelines and require ments.
9.2.5 Pregnancy
Protocol-required procedures fo r study disconti nuation and foll ow-up must be performed on the 
participant.
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study p articipant should be reported to 
Sponsor or designee. In order for Sponsor or designee to collec t any pregnancy surveillance 
information from the female partne r, the fe male pa rtner must si gn an informed consent form for 
disclosure of this information. Information on this pregnancy w ill be collected on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.In cases where a study drug can be present in seminal fluid, at  exposures sufficient to potentially 
cause fetal toxicity, and if any sexual activity (eg, vaginal, a nal, oral) has occurred between a male 
participant and a pregnant WOCBP partner(s), the information sh ould be reported to the Sponsor 
or designee, even if the male participant has undergone a successful vasectomy. In order for 
Sponsor or designee to  collect any pregnancy surveillance infor mation from the f emale part ner, 
the female partner(s) must sign an informed consent form for di sclosure of this information. 
Information on the pregnancy will  be collected on the Pregnancy  Surveillance Form.
9.2.6 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities
The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be ca ptured on the non-serious AE eCRF 
page or SAE Report Form electronic, as appropriate. Paper forms are only intended as a back-up 
option when the electronic system is not functioning.
•Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or mee ts the definition of an SAE.

BMS-936558 nivolumab
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the partic ipant to have study treatment
discontinued or interrupted.
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the participant to receive specific 
corrective therapy.
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by the 
reporting Investigator (eg, anemia vs low hemoglobin value).
9.2.7 Potential Drug-Induced Liver Injury
Wherever possible, t imely confirmation of initial liver-related  laboratory abnormalities s hould 
occur prior to the reporting of a p-DILI event. All occurrences  of p-DILIs, meeting the defined 
criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 9.2 [Adverse Events] and Appendix 3 for reporting 
details).
p-DILI is defined as:
1) Aminotransaminase (AT; ALT or AST) elevation > 3 ×ULN,
AND2) Total bilirubin > 2 ×ULN, without initial findings  of cholestasis (elevated serum ALP),
AND
3) No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation  and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
9.2.8 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, ECG, x-ray 
filming, any other potential safety assessment required or not required by protocol should also be 
recorded as a non-serious or serious AE, as appropriate, and re ported accordingly.
9.2.9 Management Algorithms for Nivolumab
IO agents are associated with IMAEs that can differ in severity  and duration from AEs caused by 
other therapeutic classes. Nivolumab is considered an IO agent in this protocol. Early recognition 
and management of IMAEs associate d with IO agents may mitigate severe toxicity. Management 
algorithms have bee n developed from extensive exper ience with nivolu mab to assist Investigators 
in assessing and managing the following groups of IMAEs:
•GI
•Renal
•Pulmonary
•Hepatic
•Endocrinopathies

BMS-936558 nivolumab
•Skin
•Neurological
•Myocarditis
The algorithms reco mmended for the management of IMAEs in this protocol are in Appendix 6 .
Please note that for this protocol, nivolumab delay means nivol umab omission.
•Checkpoint inhibitor molecules have been uncommonly associated with ocular drug-r elated 
AEs. Inflammation of components within the eye (eg, episcleriti s, uveitis) are uncommon 
events of nivolumab monotherapy (< 1% of cases). These events a re usually of low or 
intermediate grade, reversible, detected early in the course of  therapy, and manageable with 
topical or systemic steroids.
−Routine eye examinations should be performed in participants re ceiving immune 
checkpoint inhibitors ( Section 2 [Schedule of Activities]). Upon clinical suspicion of an 
ocular event consider ophthalmic consult, dose omission, or dos e discontinuation.
−Permanently discontinue for clinically significant or severe im mune-mediated adverse 
reactions. Initiate systemic c orticosteroids for severe immune- mediated adverse reactions.
−Permanently discontinue for immune-mediated ocular disease that  is unresponsive to local 
immunosuppressive therapy.
−Administer corticosteroid eye drops to participants who develop  uveitis, iritis, or 
episcleritis.
9.3 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional adminis tration of any dose of a product that 
is considered both excessive and medically important. Overdoses  that meet the regulatory 
definition of SAE will be reported as an SAE (refer to Appendix 3).
All instances of accidental overdose and/or dosing errors shoul d be reported on the Dosage 
Administration Record eCRF.
For this study, any dose of nivolumab, abemaciclib, palbociclib , or anastrozole that is greater than 
the scheduled dose within a 24-hour time period will be consider ed an overdose.
In the event of an overdose the Investigator should:1) Contact the Medical Monitor immediately.
2) Closely monitor the participant for AEs/SAEs and laboratory a bnormalities until study 
treatment ca n no longer be detected  systemically (at least 5 days for abemac iclib or palbociclib, 
and at least 10 days for anastrozole).
3) Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the durat ion of the overdosing in the eCRF.
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be  made by the Investigator in 
consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical eva luation of the participant.

Table 10.3.2-1: Safety - Statistical Analyses
Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods
Primary
•Number of participants with occurrence of 
DLT (Time frame: from start of study treatment up to 4 weeks).•DLT rate by treatment and dose level in the Safety Run-in 
Phase.
Secondary
•Incidence of AEs, SAEs, immune-related 
AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and death.
•Laboratory abnormalities.AEs will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0.Frequency 
distribution of treated participants with AE using the worst 
CTC grade. Participants will only be counted (1) once at the PT level, (2) once at the sy stem organ class level, and (3) 
once in the “total participant” row at their worst CTC grade, regardless of system organ class or PT.
Laboratory values will be graded according to NCI CTCAE 
v5.0.
Laboratory shift table using the worst CTC grade on treatment 
per participant.
Abbreviations: AE = adverse ev ent; DLT = dos e-limiting toxicity ; CTC = Common Terminology Criteria; 
CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; NCI = Nati onal Cancer Institute; PT = preferred term; 
SAE = serious adverse event.

Sponsor or designee will provide the investigator with an appro priate (ie, Global or Local) sample 
informed consent form w hich will include all elements required by ICH, GCP and applicable 
regulatory requirements. The sample informed consent form will adhere to the ethical principles 
that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Investigators must:
•Provide a copy of the consent form and written information about the study in the language in 
which the participant is most proficient prior to clinical stud y participation. The language must 
be non-technical and easily understood. 
•Allow time necessary for participant or participant's legally a cceptable representative to 
inquire about the details of the study.
•Obtain an informed consent signed and personally dated by the participant or the participant's 
legally acceptable representative and by the person who conduct ed the informed consent 
discussion. 
•Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opinion of the written informed consent form 
and any other information to be provided to the subjects/partic ipants, pri or to the beginning of 
the study, and after any revisions are completed for new inform ation.
If informed consent is initially given by a participant’s legal ly acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the participant subsequently becomes capable of m aking and communicating his or 
her informed consent during the study, consent must additionally be obtained from the participant.
Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is 
relevant to the participant's consent. The investigator, or a p erson designated by the investigator, 
should fully inform the participant or the participant's legall y acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new information relevant to the 
participant's willingness to continue participation in the stud y. This commun ication should be 
documented. The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects/par ticipants must be protected, 
respecting the privacy and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements, the 
subjects'/participants’ signed ICF and, in the US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Authorization.The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and reg ulatory authorities have direct 
access to participant records. 
Subjects/participants unable to gi ve their written consent (eg, stroke or subjects/participants with 
or severe dementia) may only be enrolled in the study with the consent of a legally acceptable 
representative. The participant must also be informed about the  nature of the study to the extent 
compatible with his or her understanding, and should this partic ipant become capable, he or she 
should personally sign and date the consent form as soon as pos sible. The explicit wish of a 
participant who is unable to give his or her written consent, b ut who is capable of forming an 
opinion and assessing information to refuse participation in, or to be withdrawn from, the clinical

SOURCE DOCUMENTS
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the source data are accurate, legible, 
contemporaneous, original and attr ibutable, whether the data are hand-written on paper or entered 
electronically. If source  data are created (first entered), modified, maintained, archived, retrieved, 
or transmitted electronically via computer ized systems (and/or any other kind of electronic 
devices) as part of regulated clinical trial activities, such s ystems must be compliant with all 
applicable laws and regulations governing use of electronic rec ords and/or electronic signatures. 
Such systems may include, but are not limited to, electronic medical/health records (EMRs/EHRs), 
adverse event tracking/reporting, protocol required assessments , and/or drug accountability 
records).
When paper records from such systems are used in place of electronic format to perform regulated

APPENDIX 3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS: 
DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING, 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW UP AND REPORTING
ADVERSE EVENTS
Adverse Event Definition:
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical oc currence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation parti cipant administered study treatment 
and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with t his treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (suc h as an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the us e of study treatment, whether or 
not considered related to the study treatment.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
•Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematol ogy, clinical chem istry, or urinalysis) or 
results from other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological sc a n s ,  v i t a l  s i g n s  
measurements), including those that worsen from bas eline, considered clinically significant 
in the medical and scie ntific judgment of the investigator. Note  that abnormal lab tests or 
other safety assessments should only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not 
available. Once the final diagnosis is known, the reported term  should be updated to be the 
diagnosis.
•Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing conditio n including either an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
•New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention a dministration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-d rug interaction.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a s uspected overdo se of either study intervention 
or a concomitant medication. Overdose, as a verbatim term (as r eported by the investigator), 
shoul d not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional  overdose taken with possible 
suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported  regardless of sequelae and 
should specify "intentional overdose" as the verbatim term
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
•Medical or surgical proce dure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): th e condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
•Situations in which an untoward medical occ urrence did not occur (so cial and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).

DEFINITION OF SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot b e an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met.
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of deat h at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypotheticall y might have caused death if it were 
more severe)
Requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of ex isting hospitalization (see NOTE 
below)
NOTE: The following hospitalizations are not  considered SAEs in BMS clinical studies: 
•a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not result 
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-th reatening event)
•elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
•admissions as per protocol f or a planned med ical/surgical procedure
•routine health assessment requi ring admission for baseline/tren ding of health status 
(eg, routine colonoscopy)
•medical/surgical admission other  than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases
•admission encountered for another life circumstance that carrie s no bearing on health status 
and requires no medical/surgical inte rvention (eg, lack of hous ing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason)
•admission for administr ation of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs (applies 
to oncology protocols)
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) th at may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based up on appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed i n the definition above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treat ment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or co nvulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization.) Potential drug indu ced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 9.2.7 for the definition of potential DILI.) 
Pregnancy and potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) must f ollow the same transmission timing 
and processes to BMS as used for SAEs (see Section 9.2.5 for reporting pregnancies).
Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to  study therapy should be reported 
as SAE (eg, death is an endpoint, if death occurred due to anap hylaxis, anaphylaxis must be 
reported).
EVALUATING AES AND SAES
Assessment of Causality
•The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship betwee n study intervention and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.
•A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relat ionship cannot be ruled out.
•The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the re lationship.
•Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration 
will be considered and investigated.
•The investigator will also consult the Investigat or’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
•For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality .
•There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the in vestigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to Sponsor. Howeve r, it is very important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causality for every e vent before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to Sponsor.
•The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in lig ht of follow-up information 
and send a SAE follow-up report with the updated causality asse ssment.
•The causality assessment is one  of the criteria used when deter mining regulatory reporting 
requirements.

Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
If only limited information is i nitially available, follow- up reports are required. (Note: Follow-
up SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initi ally reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to s tudy treatment or if new 
information becomes available, the SAE report must be updated a nd submitted within 24 hours 
to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmit ting the initial SAE report.
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.
REPORTING OF SAES TO SPONSOR OR DESIGNEE
•SAEs, whether related or not r elated to study treatment, and pregnancies must be reported 
to BMS (or designee) immediately within 24 hours of awareness of the event.
•SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report Form.
−The required method for SAE data reporting is through the eCRF.
−The paper SAE Report Form is only intended as a back-up option when the electronic 
data capture (EDC) system is unavailable/not functioning for tr ansmission of the eCRF 
to BMS (or designee).
♦In this case, the paper form is transmitted via email or confir med facsimile (fax) 
transmission
♦When paper forms are used, the original paper forms are to remain on site
•Pregnancies must be recorded on a paper Pregnancy Surveillance Form and transmitted via 
email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission

APPENDIX 4 WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL DEFINITIONS AND 
METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until beco ming post-menopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hy sterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
•Premenarchal
•Premenopausal female wi th 1 of the following:
−Documented hysterectomy
−Documented bilateral salpingectomy
−Documented bilateral oophorectomy
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of  the participant’s medical 
records, medical examinatio n, or medical history interview.
•Postmenopausal female
−A postmenopausal state is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in  a woman over age 
45 years in the absence of other biological or physiological cau ses. In addition, females 
under the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle stimulatin g hormone, (FSH) level 
> 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
Note: Females treated with hormone replacement thera py, (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may re quire a washout period in order to obtain a  physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the inves tigators should use their 
judgement in checking serum FSH levels. 
•1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
•4 week minimum for transdermal products
•8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long a s 6 months. If the serum FSH 
level is > 40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the  woman can be considered 
postmenopausal.

APPENDIX 6 NIVOLUMAB MANAGEMENT ALGORITHMS
These general guidelines constitu te guidance to the Investigato r and may be supplemented by 
discussions with the Medical Monitor representing the Sponsor. The guidance applies to all 
immuno-oncology agents and regimens.
A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be di ligently evaluated according to 
standard medical practice. N on-inflammatory etiologies s hould be cons idered and appropriately 
treated.Corticosteroids are a primary t herapy for immuno-oncology drug- related adverse events. The oral 
equivalent of the recommended IV doses may be considered for am bulatory patients with low-
grade toxicity. The lower bioavailability of oral corticosteroi ds should be taken into account when 
switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.Consultation with a medical or surgical specialis t, especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedure, is recommended.The frequency and severity of the related adverse events covere d by these algorithms will depend 
on the immuno-oncology agent or regimen being used.

APPENDIX 7 DETAILED PATHOLOGY METHODS FOR USING RESIDUAL 
CANCER BURDEN
Residual cancer burden (RCB) is estimated from routine patholog ic sections of the primary breast 
tumor site and the regional lymph nodes (LNs) after the complet ion of neoadjuvant therapy. 
Six variables are included in a calculation formula. The calcula ted RCB index value can also be 
categorized as 1 of 4 RCB classes. The calculation formula (see  image below) and detailed 
description can be found at a dedicated website: http://www.mdan derson.org/breastcancer_RCB.
Relevant information can be in cluded within a pathology report (diagnoses or comment) without 
a need for reporting calculated RCB index results. An example o f relevant information from a 
report would be:
•Residual invasive carcinoma with chemotherapy effect
•Residual carcinoma measures 2.4 ×1.8 cm (d1 ×d2) and contains approximately 10% cancer 
cellularit y (proporti on of cancer; %CA)
•Residual intraductal carcinoma, solid type with necrosis, compr ising 5% of the residual 
carcinoma (proportion of in situ com ponent; %CIS)
•Metastatic carcinoma involving 3 of 14 axillary LNs (3/14)
•The largest metastasis measures 4 mm in greatest dimension (diam eter of the largest nodal 
metastasis ; dmet)

From the results above, one c ould calculate RCB using these resu lts: d1 = 24 mm; d2 = 18 mm; 
%CA = 10%; %CIS = 5%; LN = 3; dmet = 4 mm.
Primary Tumor Bed
In general terms, pathologic evaluation of the primary tumor be d in the breast requires that the 
pathologist make 3 judgments about the primary tumor bed:
1) Identify the cross-sectional dimensions of the residual tumor  bed (d1 and d2).
2) Estimate of the proportion of that residual tumor bed area th at is involved by cancer (%CA). 
3) Estimate the proportion of the cancer that is in situ compone nt (%CIS).
Defining the Tumor Bed
In cases of multicentric diseas e, the RCB measur ements a re from the largest residual tumor bed. 
In cases where the extent of residual cancer under the microscope does not correlate with the gross 
measurement of the residual tum or be d, the tumor bed d imensions are to be revised according to 
the microscopic findings. 
Schematic diagrams are shown below to illustrate how gross resi dual tumor bed dimensions are 
first estimated from the gross findings (pink area) but may be revised after review of the slides 
from the gross tumor bed area according to the extent of residu al cancer (blue).

BMS-936558 nivolumab
In the diagrams above, the macroscopic tumor bed dimensions in ex amples A, C, and D also define 
the final dimensions of the residual tumor bed after microscopic  review. However, the macroscopic 
tumor bed dimensions in examp le B overestimate the extent of re sidual cancer, and so the 
dimensions of the residual tum or bed (d1 and d2) would be revised af ter microscopic evaluation 
of the extent of residual cancer in the corresponding slides fro m the gross tumor bed. In a different 
example (E), microscopic residual cancer extends beyond the con fines of the macroscopic tumor 
bed. Again, the dimensions of the residual tumor bed (d1 and d2 ) would be revised after 
microscopic evaluation of the recognizable extent of residual ca ncer beyond the macroscopic 
tumor bed.
This approach accounts for differences in the concentration and  distribution of residual cancer 
within a tumor bed. In the illustration above, the estimated %C A in example A would be high (in 
a small area), whereas the estimated %CA for examples C and D would be lower (in a larger area). 
In examples C and D, the estimated %CA would likely be similar, even though the distribution of cancer within the residual tumor bed is different in those 2 exa mples.

Estimating Cellularity within the Tumor Bed
The %CA and the %CIS are estimated from microscopic evaluation o f the slides from the residual 
tumor bed area. The most effective way to ob tain this information is to measure and submit for 
histology the largest cross-sectional area of residual tumor be d, and to designate in the report which 
slides represent the cross section of tumor bed. After reviewing those slides, the pathologist can 
estimate the average cellularity in the tumor bed on each slide in order to e stimate the overall 
average cellularity of the tumor bed area, as illustrated below .
The key is to simply:
1) Define the gross tumor bed as the largest cross-sectional are a.
2) Submit sections representing that tumor bed area as individua l slides.
3) Review those slides to estimate the %CA and %CIS within the residual tumor bed.
A practical way to estimate %CA in a slide is to encircle with ink dots the tumor bed on each slide 
from the grossly defined residual tumor bed (eg, slides A1-A5 in  the example above). Then use 
the microscope to estimate the cellularity in each microscopic field across the area of tumor bed. 
In each microscopic field, %CA can be estimated by comparing th e proporti on of residual tumor 
bed area containing cancer (invasive or in sit u). Estimate an average of the readings for %CA in 
the cross-sectional area. The same can be done for %CIS. Estima tes are to the nearest 10%, but 
include 0%, 1%, and 5% for areas with low cellularity. The aver age cellularity within the tumor

bed from each slide across the tumor bed can then be estimated, as illustrated above. The website

pathologists with accurately estimating the cellularity of a mic roscopic field. Those diagrams are

Footnotes
Inoperable or Progressive Disease
The RCB index cannot be accurately calculated for patients whos e disease remains inoperable at 
the completion of the neoadjuvant treatment course (eg, requiri ng subsequent additional tr eatments 
before surgical resection is possible), or those who experience  disease progression and so do not 
undergo surgical resection at the completion of the neoadjuvant  treatment course. For those 
patients, RCB is assigned as extensive (ie, RCB-III).
Internal Mammary Lymph Node Metastasis
There were no examples of internal mammary nodal metastasis in the published study that 
evaluated the prognostic value of RCB. However, it is reasonabl e to include internal mammary 
nodes with the other regional (axillary) nodes in the assessment of RCB.
Pre-treatment Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy
Surgical excision of a  positive sentinel LN  before the neoadjuv ant treatment would invalidate the 
accuracy of measuring RCB after the treatment to assess respons e. If all sentinel LNs were negative 
before treatment began, this would not affect the assessment of RCB after treatment ended.
Summary of Key Points for Pathologic Assessment of the Primary Tumor Bed
Define the dimensions of residual tumor bed and estimate the pe rcent of that area that is cancer.
3)GROSS. Identify the residual tumor bed and describe this macroscopic finding:
a) Report the measurements of the largest gross dimensions (prefer 3 d imensions, but 
minimum is 2 dimensions).
b) Submit the largest cross-sectional area for histology and spe cifically describe those blocks 
in the Section Code:
i) Try to indicate how they are oriented by photography, or a scheme or intelligent 
description (eg, “blocks B1 – B7 cross section of tumor bed in r ows from 
antero-superior to postero-inferior”).
ii) If additional blocks are from surrounding tissues, then desc ribe those as well.
iii) Five representative sections from a bi g, obvious tumor bed should be sufficient.
4)MICROSCOPY. Review the slides that correspond to the tumor bed ( ±surrounding tissues):
a) Estimate the extent of spread of residual cancer relative to the gross tumor bed:
i) If similar to the gross description, then keep the original measurements.ii) If obviously different, then revise the d imensions of the tumor bed based on the 
microscopic review of the tumor bed.
iii) S uggestion: Dotting the perimeter of cancer in each slide can be helpful to reconstruct 
the tumor extent across multiple slides (see point 1) b) i)).
b) Using the microscope, make visual snapshots of cancer cellularity as you go from f ield to 
field across the defined tumor bed from one end to the opposite  (eg, left to right, then top 
to bottom) to estimate the:

examples at the following website: http://www.mdanderson.org/br eastcancer_RCB.

APPENDIX 8 RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID TUMORS 
GUIDELINES (VERSION 1.1) 
1 EVALUATION OF LESIONS
Solid tumors will be evalu ated using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version  1.1 
(RECIST 1.1) guideline .1
At baseline, tumor lesions/lym ph nodes will be categorized as measurable or non-measurable as 
follows:
2 MEASURABLE
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
•10 mm by CT/MRI scan (scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm), or ≥2x slice thickness if 
greater than 5mm.
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pat hologically enlarged and measurable, a lymp h node 
must be ≥15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT/MRI scan (scan slice thickness recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm).
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet th e criterion of a short axis of 
≥15 mm by CT/MRI scan. Only the short axis of these nodes will co ntribute to the baseline sum. 
The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by rad iologists to judge if a node is 
involved by solid tumor. Nodal size is normally reported as two  dimensions in the plane in which 
the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the ax ial plane; for MRI the plane of 
acquisition may be axial, sagittal or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. For 
example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 20 mm x 3 0 mm has a short axis o f 20 mm 
and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example,  20 mm should be recorded as the 
node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with shor t axis ≥10 mm but < 15 mm) 
should be considered non-target lesions. Nodes that have a shor t axis < 10 mm are considered 
non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.Note: Lesions on X-Ray are not to be selected as Target or Non- Target Lesions.
3 NON-MEASURABLE
All other lesions are considered non-measurable, including smal l lesions (l ongest d iameter 
< 10mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to < 15 mm short axis) as w ell as truly 
non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non-measurable  include: leptomeningeal 
disease, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal 
masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable by 
reproducible imaging techniques.

3.1 Special Considerations Regarding Lesion Measurability
3.1.1 Bone Lesions
•Bone scan, PET scan and plain films are notconsidered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesions. 
•Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components , that 
can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered 
as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability 
described above.
•Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.
4 BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF ‘TARGET’ AND ‘NON-TARGET’ 
LESIONS
When more than one meas urable lesion is present at baseline all  lesions up to a maximum of five 
lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) represen tative of all involved organs should 
be identified as target lesions  and will be recorded and measure d at baseline (this means in 
instances where patients have only one or two organ sites invol ved a maximum of two and four 
lesions respectively will be recorded).
Note: A maximum of two lesions can be selected per organ system . For example, a maximum of 
two lung lesions can be selected (selected from one lung or one  lesion from each). A maximum of 
two lymph nodes can be selected at baseline, as the lymphatic system is considered one organ.
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (l esions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should b e those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on  occasion, the largest lesion does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstan ce the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected.
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short ax is for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis i s added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize  any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes s hould be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Mea surements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ 
(more details to follo w). In addition, it is  possible to record  multiple non-target lesions involving 
the same organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, ‘mu ltiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ 
or ‘multiple liver metastases’).

5 RESPONSE CRITERIA
5.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions
•Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nod es 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axi s to < 10 mm.
•Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesio ns, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
•Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesio ns, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes th e baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20% , the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of  one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).
•Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient i ncrease to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
•Not Evaluable (NE): If one or more target lesions cannot be measured or adequately assessed 
as either fully resolved or too sm all to measure (due to missi ng or poor quality i mages), and 
the sum of diameters of the remaining measured target lesions ( if any) has not increased 
sufficiently to meet Progressive Disease as defined above. 
5.1.1 Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions
5.1.1.1 Lymph Nodes
Lymph nodes identified as target lesions s hould always have the actual short axis measurement 
recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline  examination), even if the nodes 
regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when lymph nod es are included as target lesions, 
the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal 
lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10 mm. Case r eport forms or other data collection 
methods may therefore be designed to have target nodal lesions recorded in a s eparate section 
where, in order to qualify f or CR, each node m ust achieve a sho rt axis < 10 mm. For PR, SD and 
PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions.
5.1.1.2 Target Lesions that Become ‘too Small to Measure’
While on study, all lesions (nodal and non-nodal) r ecorded at baseline s hould have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). 
However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as  target lesions at baseline 
become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel co mfortable assigning an exact 
measure and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’. Wh en this occurs it is important 
that a value be recorded on the case report form. If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion 
has likely disappeared, the meas urement should be recorded as 0  mm. If the lesion is believed to 
be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a defa ult value of 5 mm should be assigned 
as the reference diameter. (Note: It is less likely that this ru le will be used for lymph nodes since 
they usually have a definable size when normal and are frequent ly surrounded by fat such as in the 
retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be pre sent and is faintly seen but too

BMS-936558 nivolumab
small to measure, a default value of  5 mm s hould be assigned in this circumstance as well). This 
default value is derived from the 5 mm CT slice thickness (but should not be changed with varying 
CT slice thickness). The measurement of these lesions is potent ially non-reproducib le, therefore 
providi ng this default value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon measurement 
error. To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to pro vide an actual measure , that s hould be 
recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
5.1.1.3 Lesions that Split or Coalesce on Treatment
When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the  fragmented portions should be 
added together to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, a s lesions coalesce, a plane between 
them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diam eter measurements of each 
individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such tha t they are no longer separable, the 
vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the m aximal longest diameter for the 
‘coalesced lesion’.
5.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to d etermine the tumor response for the 
group of non-target lesions. While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need 
not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitative ly at the time points specified in 
the protocol.
•Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions. All lymph nodes must be 
non-pathological in size (< 10mm short axis). 
•Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s)
•Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.
5.2.1 Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non-Target Disease
The concept of progression of non-target disease requires addit ional explanation as follows:
5.2.1.1 When the Patient also has Measurable DiseaseIn this setti ng, to achieve ‘unequi vocal progression’ on the basis of the no n-target disease, there 
must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target  disease such that, even in presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has inc reased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy A modest ‘increase’ in the size of o ne or more non-target lesions is 
usually not sufficient to  qualify for unequivocal p rogression status. Pleural effusions, pericardial 
effusions and ascites will not be  followed as target or non-tar get lesions and will not contribute to 
response or progression. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in 
non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease wi ll therefore be extremely rare.
5.2.1.2 When the Patient has Only Non-Measurable Disease
This circumstance arises in some trials when it is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable 
disease. The same general concepts apply here as noted above, h owever, in this instance there is 
no measurable disease assessment to factor into the inte rpretati on of an increase in non- measurable

BMS-936558 nivolumab
disease burden. Because worsening in non-target disease cannot be easily quantified (by definition: 
if all lesions are truly non-measurable) a useful test that can  be applied when assessing patients for 
unequivocal progressi on is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden bas ed on the change 
in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the inc rease that would be required to 
declare PD for measurable disease: ie, an increase in tumor bur den representing an additional 73% 
increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase dia meter in a measura ble lesion). 
Examples include, an increase in lymphangitic disease from loca lized to widespread, or may be 
described as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’. If ‘u nequivocal progression’ is seen, the 
patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that poi nt. While it would be ideal to have 
objective criteria to apply to non-measurable disease, the very  nature of that disease makes it 
impossible to do so; therefore the increase must be substantial .
5.2.2 New Lesions
The appearance of new malignant  lesions denotes disease progres sion; therefore, some comments 
on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specifi c criteria for the identification of 
new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequi vocal: ie, not 
attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in im aging modality or findings thought 
to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new ’ bone lesions may be simply 
healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). This is particularly  important when the patient’s baseline 
lesions show partial or complete response. For example, necrosi s of a liver lesion may be reported 
on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not.
NOTE: Fluid collections (pleural effusions, pericardial e ffusions, and ascites) w ill not be 
considered new lesions and will not contribute to response or p rogression. In the event a new fluid 
collection is seen on a post-baseline imagi ng exam, a comment m ay be made, but the appearance 
of a new fluid collection alone should not result in an assessm ent of Progressive Disease (PD). A 
lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical locatio n that was not scanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progressio n. An example of this is the patient 
who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain ordered which 
reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are consider ed to be evidence of PD even if 
he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline. A lesion identif ied on Chest X-Ray that was not 
present in prior CT can be considered a new lesion and will res ult in Progressive Disease (PD).
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued follow-up evaluation 
will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans conf irm there is definitely a new 
lesion, then progression should be  declared using the date of t he initial scan. While FDG-PET 
response assessments need additi onal study, it is sometimes rea sonable to incorporate the use of 
FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of pro gression (particularly 
possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET im aging can be identified according 
to the following algorithm:1) Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follo w-up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesion.

2) No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: I f the positive FDG-PET at 
follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT,  this is PD. If the positive 
FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up 
CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the 
date of PD will be the d ate of the initial a bnormal FDG-PET scan). If the positive FDG-PET 
at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on C T that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.
5.3 Response Assessment
5.3.1 Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from th e start of the study treatment until 
disease progression or th e last response recorded, taking into account any requirement for 
confirmation and censoring rules regarding subsequent therapy. The patient’s best  overall response
assignment will depend on the findings of both target and non-target disease and will also take into 
consideration the appearance of new lesions. Furthermore, depen ding on the nature of the study 
and the protocol requirements, it may also require confirmatory  measurement.
5.3.2 Time Point Response
At each protocol specified time point, a response assessment oc curs. Table 5.3.2 -1 provides a 
summary of the overall re sponse status calculation at each time point for patients who have 
measurable disease at baseline. When patients have non-measurab le (therefore non-target) disease 
only, Table 5.3.2-2 is to be used.

aNon-CR/non-PD is preferred over SD for non-target disease since  SD is increasingly used as endpoint for 
assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this categor y when no lesions can be measured is not advised.
5.3.3 Best Overall Response 
Best response determinati on of complete or par tial res ponse requires confirmation: Complete or 
partial responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a subsequent time point of 
≥4 weeks (28 days) later. In this circumstance, the best overall response can be interpreted as in 
Table 5.3.3-1. When SD is believed to be best response, it must  meet the protoc ol specified 
minimum time from the d ate of first treatment or randomization d ate.
For example, if the first scheduled follow-up imaging visit is Week 6 ( ±7 days) for a particular 
protocol, a Best Response of SD can only be made after the subje ct is on-study for a minimum of 
6 weeks (42 days) minus 7 days, for an absolute minimum time on -study of 35 days from the 
reference start date (reference date is considered Day 1 on stu dy).  If the subject is not on-study 
for at least this am ount of t ime, any tumor assessment indicating stable disease before this  time 
period will have a Best Response of NE unless PD is identified.
Special note on response assessment: When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions 
and the nodes decrease t o ‘normal’ s ize (< 10 mm), they may st ill have a measurement reported 
on scans. This measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to 
overstate progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this 
means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the case report form (CRF).

aIf a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen  at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best 
response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was me t. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed 
when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR sh ould be changed to PR and the best response is PR.
5.3.4 Confirmation Scans
Verification of Response: To be assigned a status of CR or PR, changes in tum or measurements 
must be confirmed by consecutive or subsequent repeat assessmen ts that should be perform ed no 
less than 28 days after the criteria for response are first met.  Subsequent documentation of a CR 
may provide confirmation of a pre viously identified CR even wit h an intervening NE or PR 
(eg, CR NE CR or CR PR CR). Subsequent documentation of a  PR may provide confirmation of 
a previously identified PR even with an intervening NE or SD (e g, PR NE PR or PR SD PR). 
However, only one (1) intervening time point will be allowed between PR/CRs for confirmation.
Verification of Progression : Progressi on of disease should be verified in cases where progression 
is equivocal. If repeat scans confirm PD, then progression should be declared using the date of the 
initial scan. If repeat scans do not confirm PD, then the subje ct is considered to not have 
progressive disease.

APPENDIX 11 NYHA FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION
Heart failure is usually classified according to the severity o f the patient’s symptoms. The table 
below describes the most commonly used classification system, t he New York Heart Association
(NYHA) functional classificatio n. It places p atients in 1 of 4 categories based on how much they 
are limited during physical activity.
Class Patient Symptoms
INo limitation of physical activity. Ordinary phys ical activity does 
not cause undue fatigue, palpitati on, or dyspnea (shortness of 
breath).
IISlight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Or dinary 
physical activity results in fatigue, palpi tation, or dyspnea 
(shortness of breath).
IIIMarked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Le ss 
than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpi tation, or dyspnea.
IVUnable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. 
Symptoms of heart failure at rest. If any physical activity is 
undertaken, discomfort increases.
Class Objective Assessment
ANo objective evidence of cardiovascular disease. No symptoms 
and no limitation in ordinary physical activity.
BObjective evidence of minimal cardiovascular disease. Mild 
symptoms and slight limitation duri ng ordinary activity. 
Comfortable at rest.
CObjective evidence of moderately s evere cardiovascular disease.  
Marked limitation in activity due to symptoms, even during 
less-than-ordinary activity. Comfortable only at rest.
DObjective evidence of severe cardiovascular disease. Severe 
limitations. Experiences symptoms even while at rest.

APPENDIX 12 REVISED PROTOCOL SUMMARY OF CHANGE HISTORY
Overall rationale for Revised Protocol 02, 24-July-2019
The primary reasons for these changes  
ensure that the protocol is consistent with internal 
BMS policies and operating procedures. Additional amendments, i ncluding to sections of the 
Synopsis, have been made to align the protocol with respect to these changes.
Summary of key changes for Revised Protocol 02
Section Number & 
TitleDescription of Change Brief Rationale

Overall rationale for revised protocol 01, 12-June-2019
The primary reasons for these changes are to clarify and decrea se the frequency of assessments 
and sample collections, clarify participant eligibility and stratification, and reduce the 
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) peri od. These changes were mad e to reduce participant burden and 
increase overall feasibility of the study. Additional amendment s, including to sections of the 
Synopsis, have been made to align the protocol with respect to these changes.

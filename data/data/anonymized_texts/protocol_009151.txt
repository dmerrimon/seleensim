This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according 
to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines), applicable government 
regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most serious public health crises in modern times that 
disproportionately affects ethnic and racial minorities [1, 2] .  There are currently no effective 
disease-modifying treatments or preventative strategies.  Single pathway pathogenic models emphasize a temporal series of biological changes that drives  the neurodegeneration associated 
with the AD clinical syndrome.  The formation of amyloid plaques is thought to initiate the disease, which stimulates intracellular tau pathology, neurodegeneration, and, ultimately, cognitive and functional decline[3, 4].  However, it is now clear that tau deposition often occurs prior to or independent of the formation of amyloid pathology[5 -9] and an emerging literature 
suggests that other factors, including cerebrovascular disease, m ay potentiate tau pathology[10 -
12].  After several unsuccessful trials that focus on clearance or prevention of  amyloid deposition 
to treat AD [13, 14], attention is turning towards tau as a more viable treatment target [15], 
partially due to its tighter link with the clinical symptoms of the disease [16].  It is also becoming 
clearer that treatment and preventative strategies for AD will be most effective during midlife, before the onset of frank symptomatology[17], consistent with recent mandates to study AD risk factors across the adult lifespan [18].  However, there is very little available information on AD 
biomarkers during midlife and there is an absolute dearth of existing data on biomarker profiles, their cognitive correlates, and their risk factors among middle-aged ethnic and racial minorities, who are at greater risk for the disease [1, 19].   
1.2 Investigational Agent  
18F-MK-6240 (6-Fluoro-3- (1H-pyrrolo[2,3- c]pyridin-1-yl)isoquinolin -5-amine , 18F-MNI -946) is 
a PET radioligand that binds to paired helical filament tau aggregates. This radioligand has only been used for research purposes. 
18F-MK-6240 will be administered in tracer doses at activity of  
up to 5 mCi (185 MBq) per injection.  
18F-Florbetaben  (4-[(E)-2- (4-{2-[2-(2-[18F] fluoroethoxy) ethoxy] ethoxy} phenyl)vinyl]-N-
methylaniline)  is approved and indicated for PET imaging of the brain to estimate β-amyloid 
neuritic plaque density in adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for 
AD and other causes of cognitive decline. 
1.3 Preclinical Data  
PET studies in rhesus monkey show that 18F-MK-6240 rapidly crosses the blood- brain barrier 
(BBB) followed by rapid clearance (Figure 1). Distribution is homogeneous across all brain 
regions, as expected since neurofibrillary tangle ( NFT ) pathology is not present in monkey brain 
(Figure 2 ). The lack of elevated 18F-MK-6240 retention in white matter compared to gray matter 
is an important characteristic for a NFT tracer that is not achieved by more lipophilic tracer

influence from radio- metabolites on brain signal is minimal or negligible.

Self-block PET studies (n=3) with 18F-MK-6240 were performed by injecting a high dose of 
unlabeled MK -6240 prior to radiotracer injection. No significant changes in V T with respect to 
baseline were observed (Figure 3) across  different brain regions. Additionally, V T was 
homogeneous across different brain regions, demonstrat ing the lack o f specific 18F-MK-6240 
binding, as expected in the healthy rhesus brain. The corresponding summed PET images from 
these studies are shown in  Figure 4.

A study w
as done to determ ine the potential toxicity of MK -6240 when administered IV (via 
bolus injection) once daily to rats for 7 or 8 days.  
Crl:
WI(Han) rats were assigned to 4  groups of 10 females and 10  males each that received 16.6, 
33.3, or 333 µg/kg/day of MK-6240 (hydrochloride salt) in 10 mM acetate buffer, 10% (w/v) 
Captisol™, 0.675% (w/v) sodium chloride, 10% (v/v) ethanol, pH 4, or vehicle only, at a dose 
volume of 5 mL/kg.  The dosing formulations contained the clinical precursor- related impurity at 
a MK -6240 to impurity ratio of approximately 10:2. Assessment of toxicity was based on 
mortality, clinical observations, body weights, food consumption, ophthalmic examinations, and 
clinical and anatomic pathology evaluations. 
There 
were no unscheduled deaths, no MK˗6240- related clinical signs, and no changes in body 
weight or food consumption. There were no changes in hematological, coagulation, serum biochemical examinations or urinalyses, ophthalmic findings, and organ weight changes. Ther e 
were no gross observations or histomorphologic findings, and no MK -6240- related localized 
effects observed at the injection sites.

This material is t he property of Columbia University Medical Center.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the study sp onso r. Histomorphologic changes attributable to the administration of Captisol™ were seen in all 
groups, including control with a comparable incidence and severity (very slight) in the kidneys and in the lungs.  They consisted of, in the renal cortex, a fine clear vacuolation of the epithelial cells lining the proximal tubules in females and males and, in the lung, an accumulation of macrophages  in the alveoli with occasionally finely vacuolated cytoplasm in males.  Similar 
histomorphologic changes have been seen in rats treated with Captisol™ at this concentration. Therefore, such observations were considered unrelated to the administration of MK-6240.  Based on these findings, the no- observed -adverse -effect -level ( NOAEL ) was ≥333 µg/kg/day. 
3H-Florbetaben in vitro binding experiments reveal two binding sites (K d of 16 nM and 135 nM) 
in frontal cortex homogenates from patients with AD. Binding of 18F-florbetaben to β-amyloid 
plaques in post- mortem brain sections from patients with AD using autoradiography correlates 
with both immunohistochemical and Bielschowsky silver stains. 18F-Florbetaben does not bind to 
tau or α-synuclein in tissue from patients with AD. Neither Florbetaben  nor non- radioactive 19F-
florbetaben  bind to AT8 positive tau deposits in brain tissue from patients with frontotemporal 
dementia (FTD), using autoradiography and immunohistochemistry, respectively. 
1.4 Clinical Data to Date  
MK-6240 was administered at microdoses in accordance with ICH M3(R2) guidelines for an 
exploratory clinical PET trial. In the three elderly healthy volunteers that were included in the ongoing brain imaging study, after 
18F-MK-6240 injection, the radiotracer uptake in brain was 
high with a peak SUV of ~5, followed by a quick washout from all brain regions. The radioactivity distribution in brain was homogenous across regions including gray and white matter as expected for a healthy volunteer with no NFT s (Figure 5). Absolute quantification of 
target density in terms of V
T was low, consistent with low potential for non -specific, off- target  
(non-NFT) binding.

The color scale for PET imag e is sh own in terms of standardized uptake value

In this
 Phase 0 imaging trial performed by Molecular NeuroImaging (MNI), 18F-MK-6240 
(referred to as 18F-MNI -946 in the MNI report) was used for e valuation as a PET radioligand for 
imaging tau protein deposition, six subjects (3 AD, 3 healthy volunteers) completed the study.

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is t he property of Columbia University Medical Center.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the study sp onso r. Each subject received one PET scan with 18F-MK-6240. Prior to 18F-MK-6240 each subject 
underwent a 18F-florbetapir PET screeni ng scan for amyloid deposition. The investigational 
radiopharmaceutical, 18F-MK-6240, and imaging procedures were well tolerated with no 
reported adverse events ( AEs) related to the product. 
Dynamic PET scans were acquired on a Siemens ECAT EXACT HR+ over 180 minutes 
following 18F-MK-6240 injection (0-90 and 120-180 minute imaging segments). A brain MRI 
was obtained as part of the screening visit. PET and MRI images were aligned and normalized 
into the Montreal Neurological Institute space, and ATLAS -based (Hammers, N30R83) volumes 
of interest (VOI) were applied to the dynamic PET series. 18F-MK-6240 was evaluated in terms 
of kinetic profile (uptake and clearance), binding potential (BP ND) computed noninvasively using 
non-invasive Logan with cerebellar cortex as reference, and target region to cerebellum standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) for both healthy volunteers ( HVs) and AD subjects. 
18F-MK-6240 exhibited high initial brain uptake within about 3 min of tracer injection with SUV 
values of 3.5-6.0 followed by fast washout in low binding regions (80-85% at ~60 min post-injection) and moderate in high binding regions (30-50% decrease at ~60 min post injection), and by a slow and steady washout in all regions during ~60-180 min interval. Low concentration was found in the cerebellum and white matter.  In AD subjects, 
18F-MK-6240 showed elevated retention and SUVR values in regions expected 
to demonstrate tau pathology, with values of up to 4.0, compared to ~0.5-1.5 for the HV subjects. The pattern of uptake varied between AD patients and between hemispheres, consistent with known heterogeneity of tau pathology in AD. 
18F-MK-6240 metabolism was rapid with 7 ± 3% 
(n=5) intact parent remaining at 60 min post injection.  The results of this proof-of-concept human study suggest that 
18F-MK-6240 can detect tau 
pathology in AD and has suitable pharmacokinetic properties for quantitative measurements of tau pathology burden.  Three controls (age 68, 66, and 59 years) and one patient with AD (ag e 67 years, Mini Mental 
State Exam score 11) underwent PET imaging with 
18F-MK-6240 with arterial sampling for full 
quantification of the PET data. Images were acquired 0 -90 min post- inject ion. Total V T was 
calculated using the two -tissue compartment model with the metabolite -corre cted arterial input 
function. V T values were similar (~3.5 – 4.5 mL · cm-3) across brain regions in the control 
subjects, with stable values after 60 min of scan time. In the AD patient, V T values were elevated 
(6 – 9 mL · cm-3) in amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, and medial temporal cortex regions.  
 The cerebellum was used as reference region to calculate relative cortical binding with both kinetic modeling (Two tissue compartment model; distribution volume ration (DVR)) and simplified measurement (SUVR) using 60-90 min scan data. DVR and SUVR values showed 
strong correlation ( R
2 = 0.96, P < 0.0001), suggesting SUVR can be used to quantify 
neurofibrillary tangle binding.   Florbetaben  was evaluated in three single arm clinical st udies (Study A -C) that exam ined images 
from adults with a range of cognitive function, including some end-of- life patients who had 
agreed to participate in a post -mortem brain donation program. Subjects underwent Florbetaben  
injection and scan, then had images interpreted by independent readers masked to all clinical

Bielschowsky silver staining (BSS) of six brain regions assessed by a Pathology Consensus Panel masked to all clinical information (including PET scan results). Florbetaben  PET imaging 
results (negative or positive) corresponded to a histopathology derived plaque score based on the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) criteria using neuritic plaque counts (Table 1). For the subject level SoT, if in any of the six regions β- amyloid neuritic 
plaques were more than sparse, the subject was classified as positive; if in none of the regions the β-amyloid neuritic plaques were assessed as being more than sparse, the subject was classified as 
negative.  
Study A
 evaluated Florbetaben  PET images from 205 subjects and compared the results to 
postmortem truth standard assessments of brain β- amyloid neuritic plaque density in subjects 
who died during the study. The median age was 79 years (range 48 to 98 years) and 52% of the subjects were male. By medical history 137 study participants had AD, 31 had other non- AD 
dementia, 5 had dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), and 32 had no clinical evidence of dementia. Interpretation of images from 82 autopsied subjects was compared to the subject level histopathology SoT. Three readers, after undergoing in- person tutoring, interpreted images using 
a clinically applicable image interpretation methodology (See Attachment C). At autopsy, the 
subjec t level brain β -amyloid neuritic plaque density category was: frequent (n = 31); moderate 
(n = 21); sparse (n = 17); or none (n = 13). Results from Study A are presented in Table 2 and Table 3 .

B five independent, bl inded readers underwent the Electronic Media Training in the 
clinically applicable image interpretation methodology (See Attachment C) and assessed images 
from the same 82 end-of- life subjects who enrolled in Study A. The time interval between the 
Florbetab en scan and death was less than one year for 45 patients, between one and two years for 
23 patients and more than two years for 14 patients. Results from Study B can also be found in 
Table 2 and Table 3. 
Study C evaluated the reliability and reproducibili ty of the clinically applicable image 
interpretation methodology (see Attachment C) using the Electronic Media Training; 461 images 
from previous clinical studies were included from subjects with a range of diagnoses. Five new readers assessed randomly provided images from subjects with a truth standard (54 subjects who underwent an autopsy) and without a truth standard (51 subjects with mild cognitive impairment, 182 subjects with AD, 35 subjects with other dementias, 5 subjects with Parkinson’s Disease and 188 HV). Among the 461 subjects, the median age was 72 years (range 22 to 98), 197 were 
females, and 359 were Caucasian. Image reproducibility data for various subject groups in Study C are presented in Table 4. Interreader agreement across all 5 readers  had a kappa coefficient of 
0.79 (95% CI 0.77, 0.83). The performance characteristics in 54 subjects with SoT were similar to those measured in Studies A and B. Additionally, intra -reader reproducibility was assessed 
from 46 images (10%); the percentage of  intra- reader agreement for the 5 readers ranged from 
91% to 98%.

Single IV doses of [18F]MK -6240 (up to ~185 MBq [5 mCi], containing ≤ 20 μg MK-6240) were 
generally well tolerated in healthy m ale and female subjects. In  patients administered with the 
former Captisol formulation, ( PN-001), 6 subjects (46.2%) reported a total of 3 treatment 
emergent AEs, of which one was considered by the primary investigator to be related to the 
study drug (front al headache),  (Table 5 ), which resolved spontaneously, and two were 
considered not related to study drug, rather method of administration (vascular access site 
bruising and vascular access site hematoma).  
In the M
NI-946 #e0061 study, using the current fo rmula tion, a sterile solution of up to 10% (v/v) 
ethanol, and 0.5% sodium ascorbate in saline (0.9% sodium chloride), one subject reported left 
wrist hematoma which was not considered related to study drug. There was no commonly 
recurring AE reported following [18F]MK -6240 inject ion. All AEs were mild in intensity.   
In the CE -
01-JPN-18-01 study, also using the current formulation, two subjects reported  adverse 
events prior to study drug administration. There were no adverse events reported  post [18F]MK -
6240 dose. 
Data 
from th e met a-analysis of safety report (May 2020) and the two completed studies indicate 
that of 4,230 subjects exposed to [18F]MK -6240 in ongoing trials at the time of the report , only 
0.95% (39 subjects) experienced an AE and  only 0.40% (17 subjects) experienced an AE that 
was considered related to i njection of [18F]MK -6240. One subject experienced two related AEs 
(headache and arthragia). There were no SAEs reported that were cons idered related to injection 
of [18F]MK -6240. One unrelated  SAE of pneumonia is recorded in the safety database. Other 
unrel ated AEs reported in the meta-safety analysis study population included claustrophobia, 
anxiety, back pain, chest pain, musculoskelet al pain, nausea, hypertension, decreased blood 
glucose, skin irritation, falling and discomfort in the PET scan ner.

of 08 May  2022 are presented below.  The most commonly occurring AEs that were related to 
injection of [18F]MK -6240 included headache (ten subjects) and dizziness (three subjects). All 23 
of the AEs reported in 22 subjects are listed  in Table 5  and were considered possibly related to 
injection of [18F]MK -6240. 
No Suspe

AEs deemed at least possibly related to [18F]MK -6240 were m ild in intensity.  
No cl
inically significant abnormalities were noted in physical examinations, laboratory safety 
tests (chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), VS, and ECGs. A meta -analysis of the safety  
database indicated that a majority of the studies c ontributing BP data demonstrated modest 
decreases in mean systolic and diastolic BP at the Post- injection Pre -scan time point while a  
majority of th e studies demonstrated increases in mean systolic and diastolic BP at the Post-
injection  Post- scan time point. It is difficult to determine whether these BP ch anges are related  
to injection with [18F]MK -6240 or whether they are related to the imaging procedures or other 
factors. BP monitoring before administration of an imaging agent and after imaging is routine in clinical practice and should continue a best practice for individuals [
18F]MK -6240. 
Furthermore, consistent with microd ose patient exposures, injection with [18F]MK -6240 does not 
appear to alter ECG  recordings in any clinically significant manner.  
There
 were no ECI, deaths or discontinuations due to an AE .

a As of the cutoff  date 08 May 2022 , 9825  subjects had been exposed to [18F]MK -6240 in completed and ongoing trials. This 
data includes expedited reports , if any in ongoing studies.  
b This subject also reported  headache and was the only subje ct in the safety database to report two related adv erse events.  
Three (
3) healthy volunteers were included in the dosimetry study (two females and one male). 
For each subject, 10 whole body images over approximately 5 hours (18F radionuclide, physical 
half-life is 109.77 min) were serially acquired according to standard procedures on a Siemens 
Biograph PET- CT camera. Three- dimensional volumes of interest were drawn to estimate total 
undecay corrected radioactivity exposures as a function of time in each organ of interest that 
takes up the tracer in si gnificant and visually assessable amounts in addition to others t hat were 
delineated in the registered CT image (e.g. lungs and muscle). From these radioactivity exposure 
curves, the mean residence time of the radiotracer were calculated for each organ/tissue. These

dose (ED).  
 
Evaluation of radiation dosimetry has been performed following administration of  
[18F]MK -6240 in three healthy humans (two females and one male). The average (± SD) value of 
ED was 29.4 ± 0.6 µSv/MBq, which is in the typical range for 18F-radiolabelled ligands. The 
radioactivity widely distributed to vario us body organs with organ absorbed doses largest for the 
gallbladder (202 µGy/MBq), small intestine (116 µGy/MBq), upper large intestine (128 µGy/MBq) and urinary bladder (128 µGy/MBq). Based on this, the administration of one 185 MBq (5 mCi) of [
18F]MK -6240 for PET scanning is anticipated to result in a total human ED of 
about 5.4 mSv. 
 
The overall safety profile of Florbetaben  is based on data from 978 administrations of 
Florbetaben  to 872 subjects and 12 subjects who received vehicle only. No serious adverse 
react ions related to Florbetaben  administration have been reported. The most frequently observed 
adverse drug reactions in subjects receiving Flor betaben  were injection site reactions consisting 
of erythema, irritation and pain. All adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity and of 
short duration. 
 
The effective dose resulting from a 300 MBq (8.1 mCi) administration of Florbetaben  in adult 
subjects is 5.8 mSv. The use of a CT scan to calculate attenuation correction for reconstruction of 
Florbetaben  images (as done in PET/CT imaging) will add radiation exposure. Diagnostic head 
CT scans using helical scanners administer an average of 2.2 ± 1.3 mSv effective dose (CRCPD Publication E-07-2, 2007). A low-dose head CT attenuation scan administer s a 0.04 mSv 
effective dose. The actual radiation dose is operator and scanner dependent.  
 Thus, the total combined radiation exposure from MK-6240 and Fl orbetaben  administration and 
subsequent scan on a PET/CT scanner is estimated to be 5.4mSv  + 5.8m Sv + 2 * 0.04mSv  = 
11.28 mSv . 
2 Study Objectives  
The study employs tau PET imaging in a well- characterized multi- racial/ethnic cohort to 
examine the extent to whic h tau pathology is associated with cognition, differences in tau 
pathology acr oss racial/eth nic groups, and  the relationship between MRI markers of small- vessel 
cerebrovascular disease and tau pathology. The study also investigates amyloid -dependent tau 
spreading. 
 
Regional SUVR for 18F-MK-6240 will be calculated to investigate  associations with measures o f 
memory, olfactory function, and cerebrovasc ular disease, and amyloid positivity  for 18F-
Florbetaben will be calculated to investigate the potential moder ation of amyloid on the 
associations with tau.

 3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
Tau and Aβ PET scanning take s place at  the Kreitchman PET Center in the Radiology 
Department at Columbia University  on separate days within 24 months of each other.  18F-MK-
6240 w ill be provided by Cerveau and 18F-Florbetaben  is provided by Life Molecular Imaging.  
Participant preparation includes intravenous catheterization followed by administration of 8.1 
mCi as  a slow single intravenous bolus (6 sec/mL) in a total volume of up to  10 mL of 18F-
Florbetaben for Aβ PET imaging and 5 mCi of 18F-MK-6240 for t au PET.  The 18F- Florbetaben 
PET scan s are acquired over a period of 20 minutes in 4 × 5 minute frames on an MCT PET/CT 
scanner (Siemens) in dynamic, 3D imaging mode beginning 90 minutes after injection. The 18F-
MK-6240 PET scans are acquired over a perio d of 30 to 60 minutes in 6 x 5 to 12 x 5 minute 
frames on the same scanner, beginning 60 to 80 minutes after injection. 
Transmission scans are done prior to the 
emission scan.  An accompanying structural CT scan  (in-plane 
resolution=0.58×0.58 mm, slice thickness=3mm, FOV=29.6×29.6 cm, 
number of slice s=75) is also acquired.  For 
quantitative analysis of tau and Aβ  PET 
scans [20], dynamic PET frames are 
aligned to the first frame with rigid -body 
registra tion and a static PET image is 
obtained by averaging the four frames. The static PET image is then registered to the CT to obtain the inverse transformation matrix that transfers the CT image to the static PET image sp ace.  Each individual’s 
MPRAGE MRI is also registered to the 
participant’s CT image using normalized mutual information and tri-linear interpolation.  Sets of 
regions-of- interest (ROIs) are selected from the FreeSurfer  (FS) -segmented MRI scans.  A 
combinat ion of the two transformation matrices  is used to transfer the ROI masks and the 
cerebellar grey matter from  MRI space to static PET image space using nearest neighbor 
interpolation. These regional masks are used to extract the regional PET data.  The SUV, defined 
as the decay -corrected brain radioactivity concentration normalized for injected dose and body 
weight, is calculated in selected regions.  The SUV is then  normalized to cerebellum grey matter 
to derive the SUVR.  This pr ocess is illustrated in Fig ure 6 .       
For tau PET, in asymptoma tic individuals tau pathology is typically restricted primarily to the  
medial temporal lobes  [21-24] (corresponding to Braak Stage I/II) and tau pathology in this 
region appears to be selectively related to episodic memory  [23, 24] , so we will use bilaterial 
medial and inferior temporal cortex for the primary analysis of tau imaging.  We will also quantitate  SUVR in regions corresponding to Braak stage III/IV (limbic cortex), and stage V/VI 
(isocortex) [23 ] for secondary analyses.  Tau SUVR data in all FreeSurfer -defined cortical 
regions will be databased for exploratory analyses.  
For Aβ PET, SUVR values are derived in lateral temporal cortex, parietal cortex,  and posterior

values, we derive cut scores for positivity following established procedures[25] .  The overall 
rating is Aβ+ if any of the regions is considered positive.  For the current study we are primarily 
concerned with whether participants are Aβ+, but we will also database continuous amyloid SUVR  values in all  FS-defined ROIs.   
3.2 Primary Study Endp oints  
The primary outcome measure with be regional SUVR  values for 18F-MK-6240 and Aβ+ for 18F-
Florbetaben . 
3.3 Primary Safety Endpoints  
The PET/CT imaging in this study is being undertaken for research purposes only and w ill not be 
reviewed clinically  unless specifically requested . The majority o f participants wi ll receive or 
have re ceived  an MRI scan under a different protocol, which is  reviewed clinically.  A small 
number of participants  are not eligible to receive an MRI scan  due to contraindications, and 
therefore will not have had a clinical  review . 
 
4 Subject Selection and Withdrawal  
4.1 Inclus ion Criteria  
We will limit our recruitment into this study to people who are between  35 and 85 years old at 
the time of enrollment, with or without confirmed WHICAP parent  history of AD, and who are 
currently enrolled in the ongoing Offspring Study. Recrui tment will focus on those individuals 
who did or will undergo structural MRI scanning as part of this Offspring study wit hin 18 
months of PET study participation . A small number of subjec ts who enroll in the PET study 
may hav e contraindications to MRI scanning, for which we have an adjusted method of image 
analysis in place as described in Section 4.3 below .  
The participants must meet the following: 
1. Age 35-85 years  
2. Have either mild cognitive impairment or mild clinical Alzheimer's disease; or have no 
problem with memory or thinking 
3. Able to participate in all scheduled evaluations and to complete all re quired tests and 
procedures 
4. Must be considered likely to comply with the study protocol and to have a high 
probability of completing the study 
 
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Exclusion criteria include pregnant or lactating women , conditions precluding entry into the 
scanners (e.g. claustrophobia, etc.), and inability to have a venous catheter for the injection of the 
radioligand.

1. Past or present history of certain brain disease other than mild cognitive impairment or 
mild clinical Alzheimer's disease  
2. Certain s ignificant medical conditions. Examples are uncontr olled epilepsy or multiple 
serious injuries 
3. Unable to lie still for the duration of the PET scans 
4. Radiation exposure for research studies in the last year that would put the subject  past 
allowable limits if included in this study 
5. Participation in the last year in a clinical trial for a  disease modifying drug for AD 
unless it can be determined that the subject  received a placebo and not  an active drug 
6. Conditions that preclude entry into the scanner (e.g., claustrophobia, etc.). 
7. Inability to have a catheter placed in the vein for the injection of the dye 
8. Currently pregnant or breastfeeding 
 
4.3 Subject Recruitment and Screening 
Adult children from the WHICAP study are currently being recruited into the Offspring Study.  
The parents are a selected subset of participants in WHICAP who are active (seen at the most recent assessment wave) or inactive (deceased , moved, too ill to participate) and seen at baseline 
and at least one fo llow-up.  We recruit from families in which parents with and without AD are 
demographica lly matched. Table 6  shows the number of WHICAP families from which we are 
recruiting offspring, given the current prevalence of AD among WHICAP participants and the expected conversion rate over 5 years among active participants.  Our preliminary data suggest 
that on average, we will have access to two to three offspring who live in the greater NYC area.   
 
We plan to assess 600 offspring per year for all five years o f the Offspring Study, and obtain 
medi cal, neuropsychological, and functional data from an in -person visit. We are recr uiting 
approximately 33% of the offspring to participate in brain MRI. These 1,000 (n=200 per year) 
offspring will be representative of the 
cohort at large with respect to parent diagnosis, race/ethnicity, and sex.  All offspring will be screened for eligibility for structural brain MRI.  
Table 6 shows  our expected MRI 
recruitment based on our experience in the WHICAP study, our pilot interview 
data of offspring, and conservativ e 
estimates of eligibility and willingness 
to be scanned. Only one offspring per family will be recruited for the MRI.  If ther e are more than 
one offspring who are eligible for MRI withi n a family, we select the oldes t.  Of eligible families, 
we expect th at 75% of offspring will be eligible after screening for MRI contraindications, and of 
those, 60% will be willing to participate (willingness rate was 79% in our survey), and thus we will  
have 1,079 eligible and willing MRI participants.    White  Black  Hispan ic

This material is t he property of Columbia University Medical Center.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by the study sp onso r. Aβ and tau PET s cans will be obtained on a representative subset of 150 offspring (with and 
without positive family history of AD ) between the age of 35 and 85. We will prioritize  
individuals who have already undergone or will undergo structural MRI as par t of the Offspri ng 
Study. We will obtain both PET sca ns within  24 months of each other . Therefore, about 33 
individuals per year will be recruited and scanned for contemporaneous Aβ and tau PET and 
MRI scanning.  MRI scans will be comple ted up to 18 months prior t o the first PET scan, or up 
to 18 months afte r the last PET scan.  Since MRI scanning has already commenced in the overall 
study, we will re -acquire MRI scans (with other funds) in instances when the initial scan falls  
outside of the 18-month window. A s ubset of P ET e ligible subjects may  be ineligible for MRI 
scans  due to contraindications. To allow us to continuously meet recruitment goals , we will still 
obtain PET scans on these individuals and use a n adjusted statistical method during data 
analysis. Specially , PET data collected without MRI data will be quantified as parametric 
standard uptake value rat io (SU VR) images using atlas -based regions of interest (ROIs) rather 
than subject- specific, MRI -based ROIs. The Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) brain atlas 
will undergo a non- linear spatial transform to PET space. An inferior cerebellar gray matter R OI 
from the MNI template will be used as refer ence region. Alzheimer's disease specific ROIs from 
the MNI template will be used to derive mean SUVRs . A covariate for analysis method (atlas-
based ROIs vs subject- specific, MRI -based ROIs) will be included in all statistical analyses.   
 
4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1  When and How to Withdraw Subjects 
Subjects  may be withdrawn if they experience any serious adverse reactions to the radioligand or 
during the participation in the study. 
4.4.2  Data Collection and Follow-up for Withdrawn Subjects 
No data collection will occur after withdrawal in subjects who drop out of the study. If data was 
collected prior to withdr awal, such data will be analyzed if possible.  
5 Study Drug  
5.1 Description  
18F-MK-6240 is a novel tau radioligand recen tly developed by Merck & Co., Inc [26]. 18F-MK-
6240 shows favorable binding properties in both human brain homogenates and rhesus monkey brain PET studies [27] . Pharmacological studies have shown that the unlabeled compound MK-
6240 is not expected to have any significant binding to other targets that would confound measurement of tau aggregation. Early human PET studies have shown that 
18F-MK-6240 
binding is elevated in AD pat ients, and that resulting radiation exposure is within the range of 
other 18F radioligands. 
 Florbetaben  is indicated fo r PET  imaging of the brai n to estimate β-amyloid neuritic plaque 
density in adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evalu ated for AD  and other 
causes of cognitive decline.  A negative Florbetaben  scan indicates spars e to no amyloid neuritic 
plaques and is inconsistent with a neuropathological diagnosis of AD at the time of image acquisition; a negative scan result reduc es the likelihood that a patient’s cognitive impairment is

neuropathological examination has shown this amount of amyloid neuritic plaque is present in 
patients  with AD but may also be present in patients with other types of neurologic conditions as 
well as o lder people with normal cognition. Florbetaben is a n adjunct to other diagnostic 
evaluations.  
5.2 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug 
Participant prep aration includes intravenous catheterization followed by administration of 8.1 
mCi as a slow single intravenous bolus (6 sec/mL) in a total volume of up to 10 mL of 18F-
Florbetaben for Aβ PET imaging and 5 mCi of 18F-MK-6240 for tau PET.  
 
18F-MK-6240 will be formulated in clear  solution of up to 10% (v/v) ethanol, and 0.5% sodium 
ascorbate in saline (0.9% sodium chloride) for IV  bolus administration.  
 
18F-Florbetaben is supplied in a 30 mL glass vial containing up to 30 mL of a clear solution at a 
strength of 50 to 5000 MBq/mL (1.4 to 135 mCi/mL) 18F-florbetaben at end of synthesis . Each 
vial contains multiple doses and is enclosed in a shielded container to minimize external radiation exposure. 
5.3 Packaging  
N/A since 18F-MK-6240 will be packaged and provided by Cerveau  and 18F-Florbetaben will be 
packaged and provided by Life Molecular Imaging . 
5.4 Receiving, Storage, Dispensing and Return 
5.4.1  Receipt of Drug Supplies 
Upon receipt of the of the study treatment supplies, an inventory must be performed and a drug receipt log filled out and signed by the person accepting the shipment. It is important that the designated study staff counts and verifies that the shipment contains all the items noted in the shipment inventory.  Any damaged or unusable study drug in a 
given shipment (active drug or comparator) will be documented in the study files.  The investigator must notify study sponsor of any damaged or unusable study treatments that were supplied to the investigator’s site.  
 
5.4.2  Storage 
Store 18F-Florbetaben  and 18F-MK-6240 at room temperature 25°C (77°F); excursions 
permitted to 2°C to 42°C (36°F to 108°F). The product does not contain a preservative. Store within the original container or equivalent radiation shielding. Radiotracer must not 
be diluted.  This preparation is approved for use by persons under license by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or the relevant regulatory authority of an Agreement State.

For 18F-MK-6240, the carrier mass dose will be limited to no more than 20 μg per 
injection.  For 18F-Florbetaben, the carrier mass dose will be limited to no more than 30 
μg per injection. 
5.4.4  Return or Destruction of Study Drug 
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of drug shipped, drug consumed, and drug remaining.  This reconciliation will be logged on the drug reconciliation form, signed and dated.  Any discrepancies noted will be investigated, resolved, and documented prior to return or destruction of unused study drug.  Drug destroyed on site will be documented in the study file s. 
6 Study Procedures  
6.1 Tau PET  
The 18F-MK-6240 PET s cans are acqu ired over a period between  30 to 60 minutes in 6 to 12 x 
5  minute frames on the same scanner, beginning 60 to 80 minutes after injec tion. 
 
Transm ission s cans are done prior to the emis sion scan.  An accompan ying s tructural CT scan 
(in-plane reso lution=0.58×0.58 mm, s lice thickness=3mm, FOV=29.6×29.6 cm, number of 
slice=75) is also acquired. 
 
6.2 Amylo id PET 
The 18F-Florbetaben PET scans are acquired over a period of 20 minutes in 4 × 5 minute frames 
on an MCT PET /CT scanner (Siemens) in dynam ic, 3D imaging mode beginning 90 minutes 
after injection. 
 
Transm ission s cans are done prior to the emis sion scan.  An accomp anying s tructural CT scan 
(in-plane reso lution=0.58×0.58 mm, s lice thickness=3mm, FOV=29.6×29.6 cm, number of 
slice=75) is also acquired. 
 The second PET v isit will occur within 24 months of the f irst. There is no particular order that 
the participants must receive the study drugs. I f eligible, the MR I scan will be collected up to 18 
months prior to the first PET visit, or up to 18 months after the second PET visit. 
 
6.3 Questionnaires  
Participants may be asked to complete any number of outst anding questionnaires during the PET 
scan uptake periods. The questionnaires are self -administered a nd are part of t he planned data 
collection for the main Offspring study.

7.1 Sample Size Determination 
The sample size of 150 subjects was selected to allow sufficient power (
  80%) of a two -sided 
significance test with 
  = 0.05 to de tect meaningful effects associated with the primary 
hypotheses.  We used the G*Power[28] to perf orm the following power analyses.   
7.2 Statistical Methods  
Regional SUVR for 18F-MK-6240 will be calculated to investigate associations with meas ures of 
memory, olfactory function, and cerebrovascular disease, and amyloid positivity for 18F-
Florbetaben will b e calculated to investigate the potential moderation of amyloid on the 
associations with tau.  
Before any specific statistical modelling techniques are applied, we will examine all variables for 
illegitimate values, outliers, and other incon sistencies.  Dis tributions of demographic and other 
clinically important variables will be examined and summarized by means, standard deviations, minima, and maxima for continuous measures and proportions for categorical measures.  Similar descriptive anal yses will be conducted on all outcome variables of interest.  We will make every 
effort to obtain all data to reduce or eliminate missing data issues.  Tests will be two -sided and 
performed at a significance level of 
=0.05.  After descriptive ex amination of t he variables of 
interest, a series of unadjusted or partially adjusted planned analyses will be conducted to address the specific hypotheses, followed by fully adjusted models, follow-up analyses, and exploratory analyses.  In all regression analyses, step s will be taken to avoid issues related to 
multicollinearity of the predictors.  If necessary, data reduction techniques (e.g., screening out variables that are highly correlated) will be applied to the predictors prior to fitting the regre ssion 
models. 
7.3 Subject Population(s) for Analysis  
The study builds on an over-25-year history of studying cognitive aging and dementia in the community through the WHICAP study and the newly-established Offspring Study, in which 3,000 adult children of part icipants in the WHICAP study are being recruited and evaluated 
comprehensively, and 150 Offspring participants will undergo PET imaging. This racially/ethnically diverse subject population will allow the  examination of sources of health 
disparities and the examination of biomarkers in established community-based diverse cohorts, utilizing existing cohorts. We have detailed characterization of both the parental and offspring 
generations, including consensus diagnosis based on detailed in-person assessment, longitudinal cognitive data, risk factors, and date of onset.  Unlike many other offspring cohorts, our Offspring Study has direct assessment of parental AD status among a community- based sample.  
Finally, we will be at the leading edge of examining the int erplay of cerebrovascular disease and 
AD pathology, both of which occur at higher prevalence in racial/ethnic minorities,  by being 
among the first to examine the relationship between markers of cerebrovascular disease and tau pathology in vivo .

Revision B  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 9 of 28 STATISTICS  
Primary Analysis Plan  This trial is descriptive in nature with no pre -specified hypothesis.  
Continuous data will be summarized using means, standard 
deviations, medians, ranges, and possibly 95% confidence intervals.  
In addition, where assessments are made over time, the differences 
from baseline may be statistically tested to see if different from zero 
using paired Student’s t -test for parametric data or Wilcoxon Signed 
Rank test if non- parametr ic data.  An alpha of 0.05 will be considered 
statistically significant and no adjustments for multiple testing will be 
made.  Categorical data will be presented as counts and percentages.  
Rationale for Number of 
Subjects  Up to 50 subjects will be enrolled to provide data of hernia 
recurrence at two  year s post procedure in addition to long- term 
symptomatic and asymptomatic hernia recurrence and quality of life .  
There is not a pre -specified sample size calculation, but a sample size 
of 30 is “rule of thumb” generally accepted as an adequate sample 
size for human studies.  (1)

 1.0 PURPOSE OF THE INVESTIGATION  
1.1. Background  
Surgical mesh used for hernia repair is classified by the FDA as a Class II m edical device, which 
means that new surgical meshes receive “clearance” for mar keting via the 510(k) process.  In 
order for a new surgical mesh to receive clearance, it is required to demonstrate substantial 
equivalence to a predicate device.  The process is designed to assure safety and efficacy of new 
Class II devices without requiring over -burdensome clinical data.  It fosters the advancement of 
technology and allows new manufacturers to enter the marketplace in an expeditious fashion 
without introducing unreasonable risk to the public.  Because clinical data is not required for a 
company to receive 510(k) clearance of a device, and because clinical trials can be extremely 
costly, there is a scarcity of prospective safety and efficacy -driven trials for new surgical meshes.  
The relative lack of clinical data for the many types of surgical mesh on the market today can 
make it diffic ult for surgeons to select the best  mesh  for a given procedure.  
 
Hiatal hernia repair may be done with or w ithout the use of mesh; however, the SAGES 
Guidelines Committee  states that “t he use of mesh reinforcement of large hiatal hernia repairs 
leads to decreas ed short term recurrence rates” (2) .  The Committee also identifies a  need for 
longer -term results.  Extending the focus from large hiatal hernias to small ones, Schmidt et al. 
performed a retrospective review of 70 patients with 1 -5 cm hiatal hernias and reported a 
recurrence rate of 16% (5 /32) in the suture cruroplasty group, compared with a recurrence rate of 
0% (0/38) in the group with crural rei nforcement with absorbable mesh (3) .  Their research 
points to the value of using biologic mesh in even small hiatal  hernia repairs.   
Despite ongoing c oncerns related to the use of synthetic mesh in hiatal hernia repair including  
erosion, dysphagia, and stricture, Wassenaar et.al. studied 73 subjects who had laparoscopic  
hiatal hernia repair with biologic mesh, with a median follow -up time of 45 months  totaling 530 
patient years , and found no evidence of stricture, ulceration, or erosion in any of the patient s.  
Given the absence of major complicati ons and the high (>90%)  overall  satisfaction with the 
operation, this research underscores the value of biologic mesh for hiatal hernia repair  (4).   
Miromatrix Medical has devel oped MIROMESH ® - a new, noncrosslinked, acellular mesh 
derived from the highly vascularized porcine liver .  MIROMESH received FDA 510(k) 
clearance with an indication for reinforcement of soft tissue  on March 31, 2014 under K134033.  
The company believes that this biological mesh is superior to other biological meshes on th e 
market  due to the unique sourcing and processing of the material.  The  perfusion 
decellularization technique used to create the product is  the only technology available to fully 
decellularize solid organs while maintaining their structure and vasculature,  thereby allowing 
production of a highly vascularized, full -thickness biological mesh for hernia repair. The 
substantial vascularity and favorable tissue composition of this  biological mesh differentiate it 
from the thin, dense (primarily skin) tissues currently on the market that rely on immersion 
decellularization .  
This study will serve to provide clinicians with high- quality clinical data  in order to provide 
them with a higher degree of confidence when selecting M IROMESH for hiat al hernia repair.

 2.5 Study procedures  
2.5.1  Screening and consenting procedures  
Patients who are candidates for laparoscopic hiat al hernia repair will be considered for study 
participation.  Trained site personnel will review prospective study subject charts to rule out any 
obvious study exclusion criteria prior to introducing the study to the patient.   
 
Prior to the hernia repair surgery, t he Principal Investigator (or a trained and qualified delegate) 
will introduce the study and review the full set of study c riteria with the patient.  If the patient 
meets all study criteria, the PI or delegate will review the current IRB -approved consent form 
with the patient.  The patient will be encouraged to ask questions and will have all of their 
questions addressed to th eir satisfaction before deciding whether or not to be in the study.  A 
copy of the consent form will be made available to the subject to take home for review and 
discussion with family members.  If the patient agrees to participate in the study, (s)he will sign 
the consent form and will be provided with a signed copy for their records.  Upon signing the 
consent form, the patient will be considered “enrolled” as a study subject.  Refer to section 6.0 
for additional details about the consent process. 
2.5.2  Surgical  treatment  
Antibiotics will be administered prophylactically according to the physician’s standard practice.   
 
All study subjects will receive the  FDA cleared MIROMESH  study device as part of their 
laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair surgery.  Prior to use, the study device (s) will be soaked for a 
minimum of 2 minutes using a sterile basin and room temperature sterile saline or room 
temperature sterile lactated Ringer’ s solution to cover the mesh.   
The hernia sac shoul d be dissected away from mediastinal structures and excised whenever 
possible.  The gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) will be returned to a tension- free 
infradiaphragmatic position with the intra -abdominal esophagus measuring at least 2 cm.  Collis 
gastropla sty, as well as gastropexy, will be documented for study records if performed.   
The crura will be closed with interrupted sutures  whenever possible .  MIROMESH should be 
trimmed in a way to accommodate the specific subject’s anatomy and defect , and should then be 
placed in an onlay fashion to reinforce primary crural closure .  A small space of at least 0.5 cm 
should be left between the edge of the mesh and the esophageal wall to avoid excessive contact 
of the mesh with the esophagus  (4) (5).  Mesh fixation may be achieved with glue, tacks , or 
sutures, or any combination thereof.  Care should be taken that fixation methods do not breach 
the aorta or pericardium when applied low on the left crus or near the apex of the crura anteriorly  
(2).  Fundoplication will be performed at the discretion of the investigator and the degree of wrap 
will be documented for study records.   
Subjects should not be placed on the  immunosuppressant drug  rapamycin  for at least 30 days 
post-surgery, as it has been shown to inhibit vascularization and incorporation of surgical mesh 
(6).

 2.5.4  Subject Surveys  
Miromatrix Medical Inc. has entered into an agreement with OptumInsight Life Sciences, Inc. to 
use the SF -36v2™ survey for this study.  SF -36v2™ is a 36- question quality -of-life survey that 
is common ly used in research, including hernia studies. It measures eight domains; four of these 
are related to physical heath, and four are related to mental health.  The physical health domains 
include physical functioning, physical role, bodily pain, and general  health.  The mental health 
domains include vitality, social functioning, emot ional role, and mental health.  Investigators 
may use and administer the Survey Materials only through investigational sites, only on behalf of 
Miromatrix Medical Inc., only duri ng the Study Term (June 11, 2015 to March 31, 2018) and 
only for the Approved Purpose (MIROMESH PM -2).  Investigator sites may not use the Survey 
Materials for any other purpose.   Refer to Appendix C for additional details. 
 
The GERD Health Related Quality of Life (GERD -HRQL) survey  will serve  as a measurement 
tool for  this study due to the close relationship between hiatal hernia and gastroesophageal reflux 
disease ( GERD ) symptoms.  The survey provide s a quantitative method of measuring  GERD 
symptom severity .  There are 51 possible scores, imparting the instrument  with a high level of 
precision; and because of the response anchors, the instrument cannot have a floor effect.  A  
study by Velanovich also implies little ceiling effect.  The GERD -HRQL has been shown to be 
reliable, valid, and practical for  the assessment of sympt om severity in gastroesophageal reflux 
disease (7).   
 
In addition to the GERD -HRQL survey, subjects will be asked to complete symptom Visual 
Analog Scales (VAS) to assess the following hernia -related symptoms: regurgitation, chest pain, 
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, postprandial pain, cardiovascular, and pulmonary.  Subjects 
will be asked to indicate their symptoms over the previous 7 days by drawing a line on a 10- cm 
scale, with 0 representing ‘no effect on life’ and 10 representing ‘extreme effect on life’.   
 
2.5.5  Hernia recurrence  
Hernia recurrence is defined as a >2 cm protrusion of an organ through the esophageal opening 
in the diaphragm  as identified on UGI  (x-ray with barium contrast ).  This definition is consistent 
with the definition of hernia recurrence for a previous study  (8).  Recurrent hernias will be 
measur ed according to the distance from the apex of the hiatus to the posterior decussation of the 
left and right crus.  Classification categories for reporting purposes will be as follows:  
1) No evidence of recurrence  
2) ≤2 cm organ protrusion above diaphragm  
3) Between  2 and 4 cm organ protrusion above diaphragm  
4) >4 cm organ protrusion above diaphragm  
 
Asymptomatic recurrent hernias may not require reoperation but will still be repo rted on an 
Adverse Event CRF.  In the event of study site hernia recurrence requiring surgical treatment, a 
Re-intervention CRF will be completed and the subject will be discontinued from the study.   
2.5.5  Withdrawal of subjects due to non -compliance 
A minimum of three contact attempts will be made to schedule subjects for follow -up visits, 
including at least one written attempt.  After all attempts have been exhausted, a subject will be  
discontinued from the study .

 2.5.6  Procedures to assess efficacy  
As an FDA cleared Class II medical device, the study devi ce is generally regar ded as efficacious.  
The procedures conducted in this study may  provide insight on the extent and/or rate of vascular 
in-growth of the biological mesh and clinical acceptance of the study device.   
2.5.7  Procedures to assess safety  
As an FDA cleared Class II medical device, the study device is generally regarded as safe.  
Device- related and procedure -related adverse events will be collected throughout the study and 
will be reported according to applicable regulations as outlined in section 3.2. 
2.6 Study outcome evaluations  
2.6.1  Study endpoints  
The primary endpoint i s an assessment of hernia recurrence req uiring surgical operation at two  
years post procedure for subjects that received implant of the mesh.  This assessment will be 
made at the 2 -year follow -up visit.  Additionally, any subjects that had surgical hernia re -
intervention or the need for hernia re -intervention due to a recurrence according  to the Adverse 
Event or Follow -Up CRF at any point in the previous two years post -procedure will be 
considered a failure.  
 
Secondary endpoints:  
• Assessment of hernia recurrence requi ring surgical reoperation at one year  post procedure 
for subjects that rec eived implant of the mesh  
• Assessment of quality of life and symptomatic hernia recurrence using the SF-36, GERD-
HRQL , and symptom  questionnaires at 2 week s, 2 months , 6 months, 1 year, 18 months, 
and 2 years  
• Assessment of hernia recurrence >2 cm as seen on  radiographic imaging at one year and 
two years post procedure in comparison to discharge imaging .   
• Assessment of device -related and procedure- related adverse events over time 
• Procedure characteristics for the hiatal hernia repair surgery will include at a minimum:  
− Length of hospital stay  
− Procedure time  
− Implant success  
2.6.2  Sample size determination  
This trial is an observational trial designed to gather long -term data for assessing performance of 
the Miromatrix Biological Mesh  (MIROMESH ®). Up to 50 subjects will be enrolled to provide 
data of hernia recurrence  at two  years post procedure in additional to long -term assessments of 
subject symptoms and quality of life .  There is no sample size calculation, but a sample size of 
30 is “rule of thumb” generally accepted as an adequate sample size for preliminary summaries.   
While the exact rate of success (no recurrence of hernia requiring success) is unknown t o this 
study population, Table 3  below provides expected 95% confidence int erval widths for various 
sample sizes and success using the binomial approach.  Using worst case scenario in the 
binomial distribution of 50%, the worst expected CI width will be in the 29- 37% range with 
sample size of 30 to 50 subjects.

2.6.3  Outcome data and data analysis 
This trial is descriptive in nature with no pre -specified hypothesis.  Continuous data will be 
summarized using means, standard deviations, medians, ranges and possibly 95% confidence 
intervals. In addition, where assessments are made over time, the differences from baseline may 
be statistically tested to see if different from zero using paired Student’s t- test for parametric data 
or Wilcoxon Signed Rank test if non- parametric data.  An  alpha of 0.05 will be considered 
statistically significant and no adjustments for multiple testing will be made. Categorical data 
will be presented as counts and percentages.  
 
Additionally, a Kaplan Meier survival analysis may be performed on the primary objective in 
case there are early withdrawals from the trial prior to the one year visit.  Otherwise, a sensitivity 
analysis may be performed plugging in best and worst case scenario results using binomial 
techniques.  
 
Summaries of the objectives will include all subjects with available data that received a 
MIROMESH  implant and will include  all assessments over time.  Procedure characteristics may 
include all subjects that had a MIROMESH  implant attempt.  
 
Counts and incidences of adverse events will be summ arized for all subjects with an implant 
attempted.  Summaries may be presented by seriousness and/ or relatedness to procedure/device.

Revision B  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 of 28 
 2.6.4  Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  
A Data and Safety Monitoring Committee will be not used  due to the post -market nature of the 
clinical study  with a cleared  device  to be used in accordance with current labeling .  Adverse 
events will be classified by investigators and will be reviewed by the study sponsor. 
3.0 RISK ANALYSIS  
3.1 Anticipated risks  
The study involves a n FDA cleared,  class II device with greater  than minimal risk to the subject.  
The greater than minimal risk designation (as defined in 45 CFR Part 46) is solely due to the x -
ray imaging required at the discharge, 1- year, and 2 -year visits.  Some of this imaging 
(specifically the discharge x -ray) may be considered standard of care at  certain facilities.  
An x -ray of the upper GI tract provides an average radiation dose of 6 mSv.  This amount of 
radiation is comparable to the natural background radiation for 2 years, with an additional 
lifetime risk of fatal cancer from the examination  estimated at 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 1,0001.  
Subjects in this study will be exposed to three such doses, all approximately one year apart. 
Anticipated risks of receiving the study device are the same regardless of whether a patient 
decides to participate in the study .  Known risks related to surgical mesh for hiatal hernia repair 
include, but are not limited to  (9): 
 
• Infection  
• Pain 
• Adhesions  
• Erosion/migration  
• Compromised sterility  
• Bleeding  • Mechanical failure  
• Foreign body reaction  
• Seroma 
• No in -growth  
• Mesh shrinkage  
• Hematoma  
There is a small risk of  loss of confidentiality  due to study participation .  
3.2 Adverse event reporting  
For the purposes of this study, reportable adverse events will be limited to all events related to, 
or possibly related to, the study device and/or procedure .  There may be adverse events which 
meet the SAE definition but are not related to the device or procedure; such events will not be 
collected in this study.  The sponsor will determine if an event meets Medical Device Reporting 
(MDR) require ments .  All MDR r eportable events will be reported to FDA as detailed in section 
3.2.5. 
3.2.1  Adverse event definitions 
Adverse Event: Any  untoward medical occurrence associated with  the use of  a device in 
humans, whether or not considered device related.

  MIROMESH PM -2 
Revision B  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 28 
 Adverse Device Effect: An adverse event caused by or related to the device.   
Serious adverse effect:  An adverse effect is considered “serious” if, i n the view of either the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• death  
• a life -threatening AE  
• inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• a persistent or s ignificant disability or permanent damage  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage . 
 
Life-threatening adverse effect:  Any adverse effect that places the subject, in the view of either 
the investigator or the sponsor, at immediate risk of death from the effect as it occurred .  It does 
not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 
MDR -reportable event: events that manufacturers become aware of that reasonably suggest 
that one of their marketed devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or 
has malfunctioned and the  malfunction of the device or a similar device that they market would 
be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur . 
3.2.2  Eliciting adverse effect information  
Clinical study subjects will be routinely ques tione d about adverse event s at study visits.  
3.2.3  Recording and assessing of adverse effects  
All observed or volunteered reportable adverse ef fects (serious or non- serious) will be recorded 
in the subjects’ case histories.  S ufficient information will be pursued and/or obtained so as to 
permit 1) an adequate determination of the outcome of the effect (i.e., whether the effect should 
be classified as a serious adverse effect ) and; 2) an assessment of the casual relationship bet ween 
the adverse effect and the study device .    
Adverse ef fects believed  to be associated with the study device will be followed until the effect 
(or its sequela e) resolves or stabilizes at a level accept able to the investigator  or until stud y 
completion, whichever is sooner .  
3.2.4  Causality and severity assessment  
The investigator will promptly review reportable adverse effects to determine 1) if there is a 
reasonable possibility that the adverse effect was caused by the study device or the study 
procedure ; and  2) if the adverse effect meets the criteria for a serious adverse effect . 
3.2.5  Reporting MDR reportable events to the FDA  
The sponsor will electronically report MDR -reportable events  to the FDA’s Center for Devices 
and Radiological Health  according to the table below .   
 
Table 4. MDR Reporting Requirements  
What to report  Reporting Timeframe  
30 day reports of deaths, serious injuries and 
malfunctions  Within 30 calendar days of becoming aware of an 
event  
  MIROMESH PM -2 
Revision B  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 of 28 
 What to report  Reporting Timeframe  
5-day reports for an event designated by FDA or 
an event that requires remedial action to prevent 
an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the 
public health  Within 5 work days of becoming aware of an 
event  
 
Reports  will consist of: 
• a completed Form FDA 3500A   
• a cover letter analyzing the significance of the event   
A copy of the report will be provided to all participating study investigators .   
Subsequent to the initial submission of a completed FDA Form 3500A , the sponsor  will submit 
additional information concerning the reported adverse effect as requested by the FDA.  
3.2.6 Reporting adverse effects to the responsible IRB  
Reportable adverse events and follow -up information will be reported to the IRB according to 
the individual IRB’s policies.   
3.3 Withdrawal of subjects due to adverse effects  
It is not expected that subjects will be withdrawn from the study due to adverse effects.  In the 
event that a subject experiences an adverse effect which results in removal of the study device, 
the subject should continue study participation until resolut ion of the event.  Upon resolution, the 
subject should be withdrawn from the study.    
4.0 MONITORING PROCEDURES  
Monitoring of the study for compliance with the clinical protocol and with applicable regulations 
will be conducted periodically by the sponsor  and/or a designated  CRO or equivalent .   
 
The investigator and the institution will permit direct access of the study monitors and 
appropriate regulatory authorities to the study data and to the corresponding s ource data and 
documents to verify accuracy.   In cases of institution policy which limit sponsor access to 
medical records, the institution will be required to provide adequate resources and procedures to 
ensure data quality and accuracy.  
 
The study Monitoring Plan will be  located in the sponsor’s electronic study master file.  
5.0 LABELING  
The Instructions for Use document is located in Appendix A . 
6.0 INFORMED CONSENT 
Informed consent will be obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH GCP, US 
Code of Federal Regulations for Protection of Human Subjects (21 CFR 50.25[a,b], CFR 50.27, 
and CFR Part 56, Subpart A), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA, 
if applicable), and local regulations. 
  MIROMESH PM -2 
Revision B  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 of 28 
 The sponsor will work with study site personnel to provide an informed consent form and 
HIPAA authoriz ation to the IRB for approval.  The written consent document will embody the 
elements of informed consent as described in CFR 21 CFR 50.25 and will also comply with  local 
regulations. The Investigator  will retain an IRB -approved copy of the Informed Consent Form in 
the study master file.  
A properly executed, written, informed consent will be obtaine d from each subject prior to 
conducting any study -related procedures .  Information should be given in both oral and written 
form and subjects (or their legal representatives)  must be given ample opportunity to inquire 
about details of the study.  If a subject is unable to sign the informed consent f orm (ICF) and the 
HIPAA authorization, a legal representative may sign for the subject.   A copy of the signed 
consent form will be given to the subject or legal representative of the subject  and the original 
will be maintained with the subject’s study rec ords at the site . 
7.0 IRB INFORMATION  
The protocol and consent form will be reviewed and approved by the IRB of each participating 
center prior to study initiation.  Adverse events  will be reported to the IRB in accordance with 
the standard operating proce dures and policies of the IRB, and the Investigator will keep the IRB 
informed as to the progress of the study.  
Any documents that the IRB may need to fulfill its responsibilities (such as protocol, protocol 
amend ments, consent forms, information concerning patient recruitment, payment or 
compensation procedures, or other pertinent information) will be submitted to the IRB.  The 
IRB’s written unconditional approval of the study protocol and the informed consent form will 
be in the possession of the Investigator and the Sponsor before the study is initiated.  This 
approval must refer to the study by exact protocol title and should identify the documents 
reviewed and the date of review.  
Protocol and/or informed consent modif ications or changes may not be initiated without prior 
written IRB approval except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the patients or 
when the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the study.  Such 
modifications will be submitted to the IRB and written verification that the modification was 
submitted and approved should be obtained.   
The IRB must be informed of revisions to other documents originally submitted for review; new 
information that may affect adversely the  safety of the patients of the conduct of the study; an 
annual update and/or request for re -approval; and when the study has been completed.  
8.0 ADDITIONAL RECORDS AND REPORTS   
8.1 Data handling and record- keeping  
Sample Case Report Forms  (CRFs) are locat ed in Appendix B.  Paper  CRFs will be used for this 
study and will be entered into a validated MS Excel spreadsheet using a 2 -step process to ensure 
accuracy.  A t a minimum, a n Enrollment CRF  and a Discontinuation CRF will be completed for 
each subject enrolled into t he clinical study.  The investigator will review a nd sign each 
completed CRF; the investigator’s signature serving as attestation of the investigator’s 
responsibility for ensuring t hat all data entered on the CRF are complete, accurate and authentic.

the use of unique subject IDs in the elect ronic database  (MS Excel spreadsheet) .  Subject 
identifying information will not be collected in the database.  Additionally, subject names or 
other directly identifiable information will not appear on study reports, publications, or other 
disclosures of c linical study outcomes.  
Investigator s will retain the specified records and reports for a minimum of  two years after the 
investigation  has been disc ontinued.  Investigators may seek sponsor approval to transfer custody 
of the records to any other person or entity who will accept responsibility  for them.  
9.0 PUBLICATIONS   
9.1 Authorship 
The study sponsor will be responsible for determining publication procedures and resolving 
authorship issues.  Authorship may be determined by various means, including contribution to 
the study design and enrollment rate.   
9.2 Trial Registration  
The Inter national Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) member journals have adopted 
a clinical trials registration policy as a condition for publication.  The ICMJE defines a clinical 
trial as any research project that prospectively assigns human subjects t o intervention or 
concurrent comparison or control groups to study the cause -and-effect relationship between a 
medical intervention and a health outcome.  Medical interventions include drugs, surgical 
procedures, devices, behavioral treatments, process -of-care changes, and the like.  Health 
outcomes include any biomedical or health- related measures obtained in patients or participants, 
including pharmacokinetic measures and adverse events. The ICMJE policy requires that all 
clinical trials be registered in a public trials registry such as ClinicalTrials.gov , which is 
sponsored by the National Library of Medicine.  The sponsor will  register th is trial on 
ClinicalTrials.gov  in order for the research results to  be considered for publication in ICMJE 
member journals.

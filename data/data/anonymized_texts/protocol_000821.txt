PROTOCOL NO.: GS-LHON -CLIN -06 
TITLE OF STUDY:  Long -term Follow -up of ND4  LHON S ubjects  Treated  With GS010 O cular  Gene 
Therapy  in the  RESCUE  or REVERSE  Phase III  Clinical Trials  
INVESTIGATIONAL  CENTERS : The 7 investigational c enters  are located  in the European Union  (United 
Kingdom  [1], France  [1], Germany  [1], and Italy [1]) and the United States  (3) and will be the same centers 
as those used in the RESCUE and REVERSE  studies . 
STUDY PERIOD: The total study period for an individual subject will be  3 years. The study will be stopped 
when the last subject completes the last visit.  
PLANNED STUDY  DATES:  The planned duration of the long -term follow -up is 5 years starting from  
approximately the end of  2017 and stopping towards  the end of  2022.  
OBJECTIVES:  
Primary Objective : To assess the long -term safety of intravitreal GS010 administration up to 5 years post -
treatment in subjects who were treated in the RESCUE or REVERSE studi es. 
Secondary Objective s: (1) To assess the long -term efficacy of intravitreal GS010 administration up to 
5 years post -treatment in subjects who were treated in the RESCUE or R EVERSE studies.  
(2) To assess the quality of life  (QOL)  in subjects who were treated with GS010 in the RESCUE or 
REVERSE studies for up to 5 years post -treatment . 
STUDY DESIG N: Background : Subjects  with Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy  (LHON)  who 
participated  in the  RESCUE and REVERSE clinical trials were administered  gene therapy  with the 
investigational medicinal product ( IMP), GS010 , by a single  intravitreal  (IVT) inject ion in a single  randomly -
selected  eye, while the  fellow eye  received a sham  IVT injection . The European Medicines Agency  
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use guideline recommends a m onitoring plan  for the purpose 
of observing subjects for potential delayed adverse events  (AEs) for up to 5  years post -treatment; hence, the 
main rationale for initiating this long -term follo w-up study.  Study  Design : This will be a  Phase III 
prospective non -interventional long -term follow -up clinical study of subjects previously treated with GS010  
and sham  during  2 Phase III studies —RESCUE and REVERSE . The long -term follow -up study will follow 
subjects over an additional  3 years , for a total of 5 years post -injection follow -up. The  long-term follow -up 
study will  include 5 visits  at 2, 2.5, 3, 4, and 5  years  after IMP injection.  Assessments : Safety, efficacy, and 
QOL  variables will be assessed during each of the 5 long-term follow -up visits and descriptive  summaries 
and statistic al testing  will be used for analysis of the data.  
ENDPOINTS:  
Primary Endpoint  
1) Adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) (ocular or system ic) related to IMP or 
administration procedure, as judged by the Investigator, reported during  the long -term follow -up 
visits (2, 2.5, 3, 4, and 5 years) from the period of 96 weeks up to  5 years post -treatment and 
summarized descriptively by type, frequency (number, percentage), severi ty, causal relationship, 
and seriousness.  
Secondary Endpoints  
1) Ocular or vision -related adverse events reported during the post -treatment long -term follow -up 
visits from the period of 96 weeks up to 5 years and summarized descriptivel y by type, frequency 
(number, percentage), severity, causal relationship, and seriousness.  
2) Change in contrast sensitivity measured with the Pelli -Robson chart in all -, best -, and worst -eyes 
treated with GS010 IVT injection compared to all -, best -, and worst -eyes treated with sham IVT 
injection respectively, from the RESCUE or REVERSE study baselines an d pooled , to the follow -up 
study time points (2, 3, 4 , and 5 years).  
3) Change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) reported with Logarithm of the Minim al Angle of 
Resolution (LogMAR), change of parameters measured with Humphrey™ v isual field (HVF) 30 -2, 
and change of parameters measured with spectral -domain optical coherence tomograp hy (SD -OCT) 
in all -, best - and worst -eyes treated with GS010 IVT injection compared to all -, best -, and worst -
eyes treated with sham IVT injection respectively, from the RESCUE or  REVERSE study baselines 
and pooled, to each follow -up study time points (2, 2.5, 3, 4, and 5 years).

  Page 5 of 65 4) Response status of eyes treated with GS010 IVT injection compared to eyes t reated with sham IVT 
injection, including all -, best - and worst -eyes receiving GS010 or sham respectively,  with responder 
eyes defined by:  
a. An improvement of at least 15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS) letters 
(equivalent to a decrease of at least 0.3 LogMAR) compared to baseline, or having  a Snellen 
acuity equivalent better than 20/200. The McNemar test will be used for com parisons from the 
RESCUE or REVERSE study baselines and pooled , to each of the follow -up study time points 
(2, 2.5, 3, 4, and 5 years).  
b. Eyes that lose less than the 15 ETDRS letters (equivalent to an increase of  less than 
0.3 LogMAR) compared to the RESCUE  or REVERSE study baselines and pooled.  
5) Response status of subjects whose ETDRS scores of the treated eye are at least 1 5 letters better than 
the sham eye or whose treated eye has a LogMAR acuity of at least 0.3 LogMAR bett er than the 
sham eye at each long -term follow -up visit (2, 2.5, 3, 4, and 5 years) in the RESCUE and REVERSE 
studies and pooled.  
6) Time course of the response in eyes treated with GS010 IVT injection compared t o eyes treated with 
sham IVT injection, for the BCVA reported with LogMAR, for pa rameters measured with HVF

5.1 Disease Review  
Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) is a rare, maternally inherited mi tochondrial 
genetic disease, typically presenting as a non -syndromic optic neuropathy. Retinal ganglion 
cells (RGC), whose axons form the optic nerve, are the major cellular targ et affected by the 
resultant mitochondrial dysfunction. LHON was the first inherited human dise ase associated 
with point mutations in the mitochondrial D NA (mtDNA)1and it is considered the most 
common inherited genetic mitochondrial disorder .2 LHON is a rare disease , and in Northern 
Europe, an estimated prevalence ranging from  1 in 30,000 to 1 in 50,000 has been reported.3-5 
Three primary point mutations in the mtDNA are cau sative of LHON in approximately 90% 
of those affected. These point mutations, G3460A, G11778A and T14484C, occur respectively 
in the ND1, ND4 , and ND6  genes of the mtDNA , and all encode protein subunits of Complex 
I (CI) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The resultant dysfunction of CI a nd the 
respiratory chain lead to abnormal mitochondrial metabolic function, decreased  adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) production , and increased reactive oxygen species. This leads to cell death 
of the RGC and the resultin g atrophy of the optic nerve.3 
LHON manifests as acute to sub -acute, sequential, bilateral, painless vision loss. It is a bilateral 
disease , and the clinical manifestation is essentially predictive of bilateral involvement. Greater 
than 97% of patients are reported to have bilateral involvement at 12  months and occurrences 
of unilateral involvement in retrospective reports of cohorts with LHON ar e very rare .6,7 A 
G11778A ND4  cohort was studied in which 53% reported bilateral involvement in ≤  2 months , 
and 80% reported bilateral involvement in ≤6  months.8 
The clinical hallmark of LHON is central vision loss .9  This is accompanied by dysfunction of 
color and contrast vision and central and cecocentral visual field defects  and a final visual 
acuity of 20/200 or worse in 98% of eyes .6,10 A prospective natural history study8 reported 
LHON subjects with the G11778A ND4  mutation. The primary outcome was the finding of no 
significant diffe rence in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) visual 
acuity at 12, 24 , or 36 months of follow -up compared to baseline at study entry. This finding 
was for the entire cohort as well as for the subgroups of patients who entered t he study within 
12 months of disease onset or after 12  months of disease onset. Improvement by ≥15 ETDRS 
letters occurred in 14.7% of total study eyes in 18% of study patients  over the study period . 
Eighty -six percent of patients had eyes with stable acuities during study follow -up. Subjects 
entering the study after 36 months from disease onset showed no change or improvem ent of 
visual acuity over follow -up. The authors concluded that for  the G11778A ND4  mutation 
spontaneous natural recovery is partial and occu rs on a very limited basis in a small percentage 
of subjects , and thus , gene therapy interventions can be measured for efficacy with a reasonable 
sample size.  
5.2 Long- term Follow -up of the Benefits and Risks  of Study Treatment  
Investigational Medicinal Product 
This long- term follow -up study will be non -interventional hence, no investigational medicinal 
product ( IMP) will be administered. GS010 was administered to subjects via standard  
intravitreal ( IVT) injection  in RESCUE or REVERSE . Please see the Phase III study protocols

RESCUE and REVERSE Long -term Follow -up  Version 2.0;  17 September  2018  
 
  Page 17 of 65 or the Investigator’s Brochure for a discussion of the IMP.  
Generation of GS010 Safety Profile 
For the profile of GS010 including  the expected adverse events, please refer to the current 
version of the Investigator’s Brochure. Investigators are  also referred to Van Der Reis11 and 
Jager12 for review of IVT injection -associated adverse effects.  
5.2.1  Benefit Assessment  
The main potential benefit for subjects with LHON due to the G11778A ND4  mutation who 
receive GS010 IVT is halting, reversal  (neuroprotection) or improvement of vision loss due to 
disease progression (neuroenhancement) . Statistical modeling of the vision test results from 
GS-LHON -CLIN -01 indicate that potential benefit from  IVT injection of GS010 may be 
greater in subjects with relatively shorter vision loss  duration and with relatively less vision 
loss at the time of GS010 IVT injection. The appropriately powered Phase III efficacy studies 
were required and pending analysis to confirm any potential benefit f rom IVT injection of 
GS010. 
5.2.2  Risk Assessment  
This study is not an interventional study and there are no risks from administration of a ny IMP 
or study procedure. The long- term follow -up study will assess the safety of gene therapy IMP 
GS010 that was administered in the RESCUE and REVERSE st udies. The risks associated 
with gene therapy  IMPs  are as follows:  
Risk of Immune R esponse:  Although the eye is considered to be an  immune -privileged site ,13 
an exp ected risk is potential immune responses to the capsid and transgene.  Immune reactions 
against the newly introduced foreign protein or a T -cell response to the capsid could lower the 
therapeutic efficacy or cause local inflammation. Immune reactions agains t adenovirus-
associated viral vector serotype 2 (AAV2/2 ) will be monitored throughout the study.  The 
AAV2/2 used in this study has been studied and employed in other ophthalmologic clinical 
trials such as type 2 trials and to date no major health concerns,  including immunologic or 
clinical, have been reported .14 
Insertional Mutagenesis:  Adeno- associated virus es (AAV ) are non -integrative viruses. Studies 
performed in vivo with mouse liver suggest that AAV vectors integrate in to the host genome ; 
however no direct evidence of tumorigenesis due to AAV2/2 integration or other AAV 
serotypes has been observed in all preclini cal studies and clinical trial data accumulated so far. 
This risk is considered as minimal.  
Germ -line T ransmission : Based on preclinical and clinical data, the risk of germ -line 
transmission is low. The probability that a recombination event could occur is very l ow. 
Dissemination : The risk of vector shedding after in vivo gene therapy depends on the route of 
administration and the vector dose administered.  An exhaustive report gather ed the bio -
distribution and shedding data from pre- clinical and clinical studies obtained for the HADV- 5 
and AAV2/2 vector .15 These studies conclude that the more compartments the viral vector has

RESCUE and REVERSE Long -term Follow -up  Version 2.0;  17 September  2018  
 
  Page 18 of 65 to pass to reach a certain excretion route, the lower the risk of shedding is, due to e ither dilution 
of the viral vector, or degradation in case of passage through the stomach or interaction w ith 
the immune system.  The possible consequence of leakage of the vector into  the environment 
is expected to be low as shedding is minimal and transient. Nevertheless, recombi nation with 
endogenous pathogenic replication -competent adenovirus might occur, therefore leading to 
AAV2/2 replication. 
5.2.3  Summary of Benefit s: Risk s 
The overa ll risk -benefit balance of IVT injection of GS010 for the treatment of vision loss  due 
to the ND4  mutation  causing  LHON  is not yet available  as no formal  clinical  efficacy  analysis 
has been provided  at the time of planning of th is long- term follow -up study. T he IMP , GS010, 
is considered to be safe and well tolerated . 
5.3 Study Rationale 
The dramatic loss of vision in  individuals with  LHON is life -changing, disabl ing, and affects 
their families socially, emotionally, and financially. LHON greatly alters a patient’s ability to 
perform daily activities, reduces a patient's autonomy, and particularly  disrupts the ability to 
read. The quality of life (Q OL) in patients with LHON remains poor, even relative to other 
forms of chr onic vision loss of other etiologies.16 LHON rep resents an urgent medical need . 
Currently there is no approved therapeutic agent for the treatment of vision los s from LHON 
in the United States. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) provided conditional app roval 
under exceptional circumstances for Raxone® (International Non -Proprietary Name [NN]: 
Idebenone) (Raxone® European Product Assessment Report 2015). A study of i debenone for 
the treatment of vision loss from LHON , caused by the three most common prima ry mutations 
(ND1, ND4, ND6 ), failed to reach its primary endpoint .17 Vision loss from LHON remains an 
unmet medical need.  
The IMP , GS010, is a replication -defective single -stranded DNA recombinant adeno-
associated virus 2 (rAAV2) vector containing a codon -modified complimentary DNA (cDNA), 
encoding the human wild type mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase 4 protein (rAAV2/2 -
ND4 ), under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter in an intron -
containing expression cassette (beta globin intron, HBB2), flanked by the viral inve rted 
terminal repeats from AAV2/2. GS010 is under development for the treatment of vision loss 
in LHON when due to the G11778A ND4  mitochondrial mutation.  
GS010 has received orphan drug status in both the United States of America ( USA ) and the 
European Union ( EU) (respectively #13 4120 and #EMA/OD/164/10). GenSight Biologics has 
completed the preclinical development stage and has conducted a Phase I /II safety and 
tolerability trial. Subsequently, 2 P hase III  clinical studies , the RESCUE and  REVERSE 
studies ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], respectively ) of GS 010, were initiated in the USA 
and EU.  Subjects in the RESCUE and REVERSE were treated with the gene therapy IMP 
GS010 injected once in a single, randomly selected  eye. The fellow eye received a sham  IVT 
injection per the randomized treatment allocation.  This long- term follow -up study will be 
considered part of the Phase III program and is an extension of the  post- treatment  2-year

Long- term Risk Assessment and Management 
According to the EMA  Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use Guideline, entitled 
“Follow- Up of Patients Administered with Gene Therapy Medicinal Products ,” and the United 
States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA)  Center for Biologics E valuation and Research  
Guidance for Industry (2006) entitled , “Gene Therapy Clinical Trials: Observing Subjects for 
Delayed Adverse Events,” viral vectors without integration, latency, or react ivation potential 
like AAV vectors present a low risk for gene therapy -related delayed adverse reactions. 
Although the FDA  indicated that  long- term follow -up is not considered necessary for this  
clinical development  program, the EMA recommends a yearly monitoring plan up to 5  years 
post- treatment.  
The regulatory intention of further  observation is to determine the sustainability of efficacy, or 
whether declining efficacy after administration of gene therapy IMP  occurs or whether more 
time is needed for tissue to be fully functional. For safety, the intention is to det ermine delayed -
onset of adverse events ( AEs), and to determine any additional unexplored long -term risks. 
The EMA refers to the Guideline (2008) entitled “Safety and Efficacy Follow -up: Risk 
Management of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products” for possible delayed risks. One  area 
for long -term observation is the potential risk directly related to the administration procedure 
of advanced therapies, and for this program would be the technique of IVT injection and any 
associated long -term effects.  
In summary, a ll treated subjects in the  RESCUE and REVERSE studies will be offered 
participation in the GS-LHON -CLIN06 study for the purpose of long- term safet y evaluations , 
but only those providing informed consent and meet ing eligibility criteria will be included in 
the study.

7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This study will be a  multinational  multicenter prospective non -interventional long -term 
follow- up clinical study of subjects previously treated with GS010 in either the RESCUE  or 
REVERSE  studies. Of the  7 investigational centers  participating , 4 are located  in Europe 
(1 each in France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom, ) and 3 are located in  the United 
States.  
Subjects will be enrolled in the long- term fol low-up study when informed consent is provided  
and inclusion/exclusion criteria are met. Enrollment will occur during the Inc lusion Period,  
which will be  during  the RESCUE  and REVERSE study Week 96 /End-of-Study ( EOS ) Visit 
or anytime  up to 1 day prior to the long -term follow -up study  Visit 2 ( Day 180 ). Preferably , 
the assessments required  to be performed  during the Inclusion Period will be conducted at the 
RESCUE  and REVERSE study Week 96/EOS visit; however, if the subject cannot undergo all 
assessments at that time, the assessments may be performed at a later date  during the Inclusion 
Period , but no later than  one day before the Year 2.5 visit (Day 180). 
The study population will be limited to the number of subjects treated  in the RESCUE and 
REVERSE studies. The total length of the long- term follow -up study will be 3 years and the 
total length of the subject follow -up from IMP administration will be 5 years. The RESCUE 
and REVERSE long- term follow -up study is planned to start towards the end of 2017  and study 
start will be defined as the first subject’s first visit  in this study . The approximate study end 
date is  planned to be towards the end of year 2022 after the last subject’s last visit.  
The follow -up will  include onsite assessments of safety, QOL, and efficacy  as in the RESCUE 
and REVERSE studies . The study will include 5  follow-up study visits: at 2.0 -, 2.5-, 3-, 4-, 
and 5 years post- treatment . 
Statistical analysis of the data will include  descriptive summaries  of safety , QO L assessments , 
and statistical testing of efficacy endpoints.

7.3 Study Population  
The study population will include subjects who were treated with GS010 in either of the 
2 Phase III trials —RESCUE and REVERSE. Subjects will have had vision loss and been 
diagnosed with LHON due to the G11778A point mutation in the mitochondrial ND4  gene. 
Subjects will have received a single  IVT injection of the gene therapy GS010 in a single 
randomly- selected eye in the RESCUE or REVERSE studies.  
Subjects will provide informed consent and will be enrolled after all inclusion/excl usion 
criteria are met.  
7.3.1 Inclusion Criteria  
Subject s MUST  satisfy all the following entry criteria before they will be allowed to participa te 
in the study: 
1. Subject was treated  with GS010 IVT injection  in either of the RESCUE or REVERSE 
Phase III clinical studies.  
2. Subject of legal consent age has provided informed consent; subject s that are  not of legal 
consent age ha ve undergone their country -approved clinical trial enrollment consent 
process.  
7.3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
If any of the following apply, the subject  MUST  NOT  enter the study:  
1. Subject is unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol requirements. 
2. Subject has any medical or psychological condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, 
may compromise their safe participation in the study.  
3. Subject is taking or intending to take idebenone during the long- term follow -up study 
period. 
7.3.3 Subject Withdrawal /Early Subjec t Termination  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the applicable regulations, a subject  has the 
right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice  to his or her 
future medical care by the physician or at the in stitution.  
 
Subject s will be withdrawn from the study under a ny of the following  circumstances : 
• The subject’s request, at any time and for any reason.  
• The Investigator decides that the subject  should be withdrawn and the study is not in the 
subject’s best interest . The Sponsor or Sponsor designee is to be notified immediately.

RESCUE and REVERSE Long -term Follow -up  Version 2.0;  17 September  2018  
 
  Page 25 of 65 • The Investigator , the Sponsor, or the Health Authority, for any reason, stops the study. 
• The subject  fails to return to the investigational site  for scheduled visits and does not 
respond to telephone or written attempts at contact. 
o If the subject fails to attend the scheduled visit, there will be at least 2 attempts to 
contact the subject via telephone and 2 written communications. If these receive no 
reply the subject will be considered lost to follow-up. 
Subjects who are lost to follow -up, who dropped out , or who were dis continued will not be 
replaced.  
The reason for withdrawal will be recorded in the clinical records and the e lectronic case r eport 
form (eCRF). All  subjects who are withdrawn from the study will undergo an Early 
Termination visit  (ETV) . 
 
Evaluations at Withdrawal 
For any subject who is withdrawn before co mpleting all study visits, the I nvestigator should: 
• Perform a n ETV 
• Complete all appropriate  eCRF pages, providing the date of and explanation for the 
subject’s withdrawal/discontinuation. 
 
7.4 Concomitant or Prohibited  Therapy  
No investigational product will be administered during this long- term follow -up study.  
Unmasking procedures are not pertinent to this study as no study treatment/study  procedures 
will be performed during the long- term follow -up. 
No intervention specific for LHON , the disease under study,  will be allowed  during th is long-
term follow -up study and s ubjects will not be permitted to enroll in any investigational trials.  
Subjects may receive concomitant medications that are for indications other tha n the treatmen t 
of vision los s due to LHON,  and these are allowed per the decision and discretion of the 
Investigator. 
Idebenone ( Raxone®; approved in Europe for LHON, but not in the US) will be prohibited 
during the study. If the subject starts idebenone during the long- term follow -up, this will be 
considered non -adherence to the protocol but will not disqualify the subject from continuing 
in the study. 
Any other treatment s that are considered necessary for the subject ’s welfare may be given at 
the discretion of the Investigator. Administration of concomitant medications must  be reported 
in the appropriate section of the eCRF along with dosage information, dates of administration,

Page 34 of 65 9. DESCRIPTION AND METHODS OF STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND 
PROCEDURES  
9.1 Demographics, Medical History, and Prior Medications  
The baseline demographic data  of age and gender  will be imported from the RESCUE or 
REVERSE clinical database into the long- term follow -up clinical database . 
The medical history will be reviewed and updated by the Investigator or qualifi ed designee.  
All relevant prior medications  will be recorded , including prescription and non -prescription 
medications, preparations and health and/or dietary supplements taken b y the subject . 
Concomitant medications from the RESCUE and REVERSE studies may be recorded as prior 
medications with respect to the long- term follow -up study.  
9.1.1  Physical Examination 
Physical examination will be performed by the Investigator, or designee, an d will include 
general appearance, skin, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck, thyroid, chest/lungs, hea rt, 
abdomen, lymph nodes, extremities; and subject height an d body weight. 
All abnormalities should be clearly documented.  A clinically significant abnormal finding that 
is causally related to the study medication or study procedure in the judgment of th e 
Investigator will be recorded as an AE. 
9.2 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be assessed and recorded at Visit 1 and Visit 5/EOS or ETV by the I nvestigator 
or designee  and will include temperature, pulse rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
(after sitting at rest for 5 minutes) . A clinically significant abnormal finding that is causally 
related to the study medication or study procedure  in the judgment of the Investigator will be 
recorded as an AE.  
9.3 Electrocardiogram  
A 12-lead ECG will be recorded at Visit 1 and Visit 5/EOS or ETV by the I nvestigator as part 
of the general safety assessment  and will include R -R interval, PR interval, QRS complex, and 
QT interval. The  ECG should be recorded prior to blood collection and the subject  will be  in a 
supine position and at rest for at least 10 minutes prior to the start  of the recording.  The ECGs 
will be reviewed  and read locally at the  investigative center  site to assess any abnormalities  of 
which  should be clearly documented.  A clinically significant  abnormal finding that is causally 
related to the study medication or study procedure in the judgme nt of the Investigator will be 
recorded as an AE . 
9.4 Clinical Laboratory Testing 
Venous blood samples will be taken  for hematology and chemistry testing at  Visit 1 and Visit  5 
(EOS)  or ETV . The following parameters will be determined:  
• Hematology: complete blood count including red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, 
white blood cells with differential counts, and platelets.

RESCUE and REVERSE Long -term Follow -up  Version 2.0;  17 September  2018  
 
Page 35 of 65 • Serum chemistry: glucose, lipase, amylase, calcium, sodium, potassium, chlor ide, 
bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine.  
• Liver Function Tests: aspartate aminotransferase  (AST), alanine aminotransferase  
(ALT ), alkaline phosphatase  (ALP), g amma -glutamyl transpeptidase  (γGT ), total 
bilirubin, and albumin. 
Analysis of samples will be conducted by  the study central l aboratory . Further details of the 
procedures to be followed for sample collection, storage, and shipment will be documented in 
a Laboratory Manual.  
Additional and repeat laboratory safety testing may be performed at the discre tion of the 
Investigator. 
The I nvestigator, or designee , is responsible to review the results of all laboratory tests in a 
timely manner. For all abnorm al values, the I nvestigator must provide comments on the 
laboratory results sheet, identifying those that are abnormal and clinica lly significant, as well 
as those that are abnormal and not clinically significant.  A clinically significant abnormal 
finding that is causally related to the IMP will be reported as an AE as per the Investigator’s 
judgment. 
9.5 Quality -of-Life Assessments  
QOL questionnaires will be administered in paper version at the study site. An interviewer will 
administer the questionnaire to the subject. The caregiver may be present but this i s not 
required. QOL questionnaires must be performed prior to any vision or ocular testing . 
9.5.1  36-Item Short  Form Health Survey, Version 2  
The SF -36 Questionnaire is a generic subject -reported outcome instrument used to assess Q OL. 
It includes 36 questions that assess 8 health concepts: 
1) limitations in physical activities because of health problems 
2) limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems  
3) limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems  
4) bodily pain 
5) general mental health (psychological distress and well -being) 
6) limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems  
7) vitality (energy and fatigue) 
8) general health perceptions . 
Each question has 5 answers scored 1 (unable to) to 5 (no difficulty). The scale score  of each 
domain is calculated based on the summed score across items included in the domain, and is 
rescaled to 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health states (Ware 2007) .

Page 36 of 65 9.5.2  Visual Functioning Questionnaire -25 
The VFQ -25 Questionnaire is a 25 -item version of the 51 -item Visual Functio n Questionnaire 
from the National Eye Institute. The VFQ -25 consists of 25 vision -targeted questions 
representing 11  vision- related constructs, plus an additional single -item general health rating 
question. All items are scored from 0 to 5, so that a higher number represents better 
functioning. To score the questionnaire, each item is converted to a 0 -100 scale. Items within 
each subscale are averaged to create 12 subscale scores. The subscale scores (excludi ng the 
general health rating question) are then averaged to calculate the composite score.18 
9.6 Ocular  and Vision Assessments  
The methodology for  all the ophthalmic evaluations will be detailed in the  standard operating 
procedures (SOP s) for o cular and vision t esting . A central  ophthalmology reading center will 
be used for quality control  and analysis  as detailed per evaluation in the study specific SOP.  
Ocular and vision assessments will be performed by the Investigator or other qualified site 
personnel. 
9.6.1 Pelli -Robson Contrast Sensitivity  
Contrast sensitivity will be measured using the Pelli -Robson chart.19,20 (Elliot 1990a, Elliott 
1990b) The Pelli -Robson chart is comprised of eight rows of six optotypes of a constant size, 
with varying levels of contrast. The scoring will be based on the lowest contra st for which at 
least two lett ers in a triplet are reported correctly. The test will be administered at 1 meter.  
Assessment of the effect of GS010 will be analyzed. 
9.6.2  Slit-Lamp Examination (Pre- and Post- Pupil Dilation)  
Slit-lamp biomicroscopy examination will be performed per local sta ndard medical 
examination techniques, pre- and post-pupil dilation, per the study schedule. 
9.6.3  Goldmann Applanation Tonometry  
Intra ocular pressure  will be measured per the study schedule by Goldmann applanation 
tonometry. Topical fluorescein and anesthetic will be utilized per standard local practices for 
the Goldmann applanation procedure. 
9.6.4  Refraction for Best -Corrected Visual Acuity  
Refraction wil l be performed as per the  SOP for ocular and vision t esting . Subject must be 
refracted prior to performing other vision assessments, for example visual ac uity, contrast 
vision, and HVF testing. Refraction will be performed to obtain the BCVA for each ey e. 
9.6.5  Visual Acuity  
Subjects will include both those with eyes able to read letters on the ETDRS chart , defined as 
on-chart eyes, and those with eyes unable to read letters on the ETDRS chart, define d as off -
chart eyes. Please refer to the SOP for ocular and vision t esting for the detailed definition of 
off- and on- chart eyes.

Page 37 of 65 On-chart eyes will have an ETDRS score, as well as Snellen and LogMAR visual acu ity values 
based on the letters/lines read on the ETDRS chart at 4 - and 1- meter distances.  
Off-chart eyes will not have an ETDRS score, Snellen or LogMAR visual acuity. Off -chart 
eyes will be tested for count fingers (CF) or hand motion (HM) visual acuity per the  SOP  for 
ocular and vision t esting.  
LogMAR visual acuity will be obtained for off -chart eyes based on  the methodology described 
by Karanjia .21 (Refer to the SOP for ocular and vision t esting for complete details ). Briefly, 
the finger/hand dimensions of the examiner will be measured beforehand. The exami ner will 
then present their fingers/hand to the subject to assess CF or HM vision, and wi ll measure the 
distance at which the subject accurately counted fingers or detected HM. The finger/ hand 
dimensions of the examiner and the distance at which CF or HM was performed will be e ntered 
into the equation ,21 modified for assessment of visual acuity in meters. The output of intere st 
is the LogMAR visual acuity.  
For the purpose of the study, one ETDRS line will be considered equivalent to 0.1 LogMAR, 
and 1 ETDRS letter equivalent to 0.02 LogMAR. 
9.6.6  Humphrey  Visual Field 30 -2 
Standardized automated v isual fields will be obtained with an HVF Analyzer II (Carl Zeiss 
Meditec Inc.) using the 30 -2 SITA Fast test, Stimulus III Wh ite to measure mean deviations in 
decibels of sensitivity  and other parameters obtained . A central reading center will perform 
quality control, analysis, and interpretation of all HVF results. 
9.6.7 Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography  
SD-OCT will be assessed with the Spectralis® OCT (Heidelberg Engineering). P arameters 
will be obtained for the optic nerve (e.g., retinal nerve fibe r layer  [RNFL] ) and posterior pole, 
per standard protocols included in the Spectralis  software. A central reading center will 
perform quality control, analysis, and interpretation of all SD- OCT data.  
9.6.8  Color Fundus Photos  
Color fundus photo s will be obtained at all visits and will be used for grading of vitreous haze. 
A central reading cent er will perform quality control, analysis, and interpretation of all color 
fundus photos.

Page 38 of 65 10. SAFETY MEASUREMENTS AND VARIABLES  
10.1 Adverse Events  
10.1.1   Summary and Overview 
An AE can be any unfavorable or unintended sign, including an abnormal laboratory finding, 
symp tom or disease temporally associated with the IMP/study procedure,  whether or not 
considered causally related  with the IMP/study procedure. 
Adverse events  should be volunteered by the subject, be observed from examination of the 
subject at a n investigative center  visit, or from observations of clinically significant laboratory 
values or special examination abnormal values. AEs will not be solicited in this long- term 
follow-up study by the use of a specific list of anticipated events.  
Surgical p rocedures planned before enrolment of the subject in the study are not considered 
AEs if the condition was known before study inclusion. In this case, the medical condition 
should be reported in the subject’s medical history. 
Worsening of visual acuity determined by the Investigator to be due to the progress ion of 
LHO N will not be considered an AE. 
10.1.2  Assessment  and Documentation  of Adverse Events  
The Investigator will ask the subject  at each  follow-up visit how they have been doing since 
the last visit. The I nvestigator may inquire about any changes in their health status since the 
last visit  and i f the subject recalls and reports a health -related event to the Investigator, then 
the Investigator will use their medical judgment to determin e whether the eve nt is an AE. If 
the I nvestigator judges that the sub ject ha s had  an adverse event, specific details will be 
explored for a complete AE assessment . If the subject is unable to recall specif ic details, the 
subject and/or I nvestigator may contact the  subject’ s primary physician to collect the data 
needed for complete AE assessment . Further monitoring of AEs will occur for those AEs 
recorded on the eCRF. 
AEs to be recorded on the eCRF and further monitored by the Investigator include the 
following: 
• Any AE that is causally related to  GS010 IVT and/or study procedure 
• Any ocular or vision -related AE  that is  causally related or unrelated to study medication 
and/or study procedure 
• Any SAE  that is  causally related or unrelated to study medication and/or study 
procedure. 
 
Clinically significant abnormal findings observed during physical examinati on, vital signs  
measurement , or ECG recording will be re corded in the eCRF  as an AE  if the clinically 
significant  abnormal finding is deemed as causally related to the study medication or study 
procedure.

RESCUE and REVERSE Long -term Follow -up  Version 2.0;  17 September  2018  
 
Page 39 of 65 Events are to be recorded  by the Investigator or designee on the page  titled  “Adverse Events” 
of the eCRF (also called the “AE page”).  The following  AE data  must be assessed and 
documented: 
• Date of onset and date of res olution (i.e. actual dates when the event starts and is 
resolved rather than dates when the Investigator is informed). 
• Nature/description of the event with self -explanatory and concise medical terminology 
(indicate a diagnosis or syndrome instead of sympto ms). A diagnosis (a  single 
diagnostic term ), if available,  should be used for documentation in the eCRF , rather 
than a subset of individual symptoms comprising the diagnosis ; each diagnostic 
verbatim term will be counted as a single AE . 
• Severity.  
• Relationship to GS010 IVT injection.  
• Relationship to study procedure. 
• Seriousness. 
• Any action taken regarding the event, whether by the Investigator, the subject  (as 
reported by the subject), or by another physician (as reported by the subject or in the  
subject’s medical record).  
• Outcome.  
AEs requiring therapy must be treated with recognized standards of medical  care to protect the 
health and well -being of the subject. Any treatment given will be reported on the page 
"Concomitant medication" of the CRF.  
If known, the name of  any disorder or  illness should be recorded, in preference to the listing 
of individual signs or symptoms. 
Severity  Intensity/ Grading  
The severity of clinical AE is graded according to the Common Terminology Crit eria for 
Adverse E vents (CTCAE) version 4.0. The CTCAE scale will be provided to Investigators. 
 
Should an event be missing in one of the scales, the follow ing 3 -point scale must be used: 
• Mild: discomfort noticed, but no disruption of normal daily activity. 
• Moderate: discom fort sufficient to affect normal daily activity.  
• Severe: inability to work or perform normal daily activity.  
 
Table 2 shows the correspondence between the severity levels of the CTCAE grades and th e 
3-point scale grades.

study treatment  and/or study procedure s. The relationship of each AE to the study treatment  
and/or study procedur es will be evaluated using  the following definitions: 
 
• Unrelated: T here is evidence of relationship to a cause other than the  GS010 IVT 
injection or study procedure. Does not meet criteria listed under unlikely, possibl e, or 
probable.  
• Unlikely: D oes not fol low a reasonable temporal sequence from administration  of 
GS010 IVT injection or study procedure  and is most likely produced by the subject's 
clinical state and/or by environmental factors and/or by other therapies administered.  
• Possible: F ollows a reason able temporal sequence from administration  of GS010 IVT 
injection or study procedure and is not likely produced by the subject's clinica l state 
and/or by environmental factors and/or other therapies administered. 
• Probable: F ollows a reasonable temporal seq uence from administration  GS010 IVT 
injection or study procedure . Clear -cut temporal association.  
• Related: I ncludes all of the following: 
o It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug. 
o It could not be reasonably explained by the  known characteristics of the subject’s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors or other modes of therapy administe red 
to the subject.  
o It follows a known pattern of response to the suspected drug. 
 
Outcome  
The outcome of each AE will be rated as follows: 
• Recovered  
• Not recovered  
• Recovered  with sequelae 
• Fatal ; This outcome is to be used only for an event leading to death. The outcome of 
all other events at the time of the death must be reported. The outcome of ongoing ones 
is reported as "not recovered".

Page 41 of 65 • Unknown  
• Worsening; This outcome is used when an AE worsens. The new status of the event is 
documented as another AE in the e CRF.  
 
10.2 Serious Adverse Event Assessing and Recording  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that fulfil ls the following criteria:  
• Results in death; 
• Is life -threatening;  
• Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing inpatient hospitalization; 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity;  
• Is a congenital abnormality/birth defect;  
• Important medical events not captured by the above but which may, for example,  
require medical intervention to prevent one of the above criteria . 
 
Definition of Serious Criteria  
Life-threatening: an AE is life -threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred (i .e., it does not include a reaction that might have caused death if it 
had occurred in a more serious form). 
Hospitalization: AEs requiring hospitalization should be considered SAEs. Hospital ization for 
elective surgery for a pre -existing condition that has not worsened, or hospitalization for 
routine clinical procedures that are not the result of an AE need not be considered AE s or 
SAEs. Any untoward event occurring during the procedure must be reported as an AE, either 
'serious' or 'non -serious' according to the usual criteria.  In general, hospitalization signifies that 
the subject has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at t he hospital or 
emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate i n the 
physi cian's office or outpatient setting. When in doubt as to whether 'hospitalization'  occurred 
or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. 
Disability/incapacitating: an AE is incapacitating or disabling if the experience  results in a 
substantial an d/or permanent disruption of the subject's ability to carry out normal life 
functions. 
Events Not to Be Considered an SAE  
Events associated with hospitalization for the following will not be considered as  an SAE: 
• Evaluation or treatment of a pre -existing c ondition and  a non- exacerbating  condition as 
long as the condition(s) associated with the hospitalization: 
o Existed prior to the subject ’s entry into the study and has been recorded in the subject ’s 
medica l history as documented in the CRF (e .g., degenerative disease)  
o Has not worsened in severity or frequency following the subject ’s exposure to study 
medication  
o Has not required a change in treatment management following the subject ’s exposure 
to the study medication .

Serious Adverse Event  Documentation and Reporting  
Reporting requirements for SAEs will be managed on behalf of  GenSight by a third -party 
vendor. 
Any SAE occurring during the course of the study, i .e., between the ICF signature and the 
EOS  visit, MUST be reported  to the Sponsor or the ir representative  as soon as it becomes 
known . The Investigator must complete and email  or fax a "Serious Adverse Event Form" to 
the Sponsor or their designee within 24 hours of occurrence or knowledge of the event. 
An Investigator’s delegate may complete the SAE form; however, the Princ ipal Investigator 
or delegate physician must sign it. The form can be sent to the Sponsor or their de signee with 
the delegate's signature if the Principal Investigator/delegate physician’ s signature cannot be 
obtained within one working day. The Principal Investigator/delegate physici an’s signature 
must be obtained as soon as possible, as must his/her evaluation of the relationship to the I MP. 
The signed form must be emailed or faxed to the Sponsor or their designee immediately.  
The SAE form must be completed in English. 
The initial report should be promptly followed by detailed, written reports , which will include 
copies of hospital case reports, autopsy reports and other documents when requested and 
applicable.  
The Sponsor or designee  will assess initial and follow -up SAE reports from the site for 
expectedness, which will be determined based on the most recent edition of the Investi gator’s 
Brochure. Reports of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions will be ex pedited to 
the regulatory authorities as required per local regulations as an Investiga tional New Drug 
(IND) Safety Report within the required time frame.  
The Sponsor or designee  will be  responsible for informing the  institutional review board(s)  
(IRB)/independent ethics committee(s) (IEC) of SAEs as required. Correspondence with the 
IRB/IEC relating to the reporting of SAEs will be ret ained in the study file. The Investigator  
will receive a copy of all  correspondence with the IRB/IEC and maintain in the site files .

Page 43 of 65 10.3 Ocular Inflammation  Events  
Specific assessment and documentation of ocular inflammation will be of interest, as ocular 
inflammation is commonly r eported with use of intravitreal  AAV -based gene therapy and was 
a noted adverse side effect in preclinical studies, the Phase I/II, and in itial Phase III clinical 
studies of the IMP GS010. Specific ally, standardized schemes for assessing anatomic location, 
severity, and clinical evolution will be employed. Specific scales will be used f or anterior 
uveitis (anterior chamber) and i ntermediate uveitis (vitreous). 
The Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group provided standardiz ed 
methods for (1) anatomic classification of uveitis  (Table 3); (2) grading scheme for anterior 
chamber cells  (Table 4); (3) grading scheme for anterior chamber flare  (Table 5); and 
(4) activity of uveitis  terminology (for clinical evolution) 22 (Table 6). 
The National Institutes of Health  (NIH)  Grading System for Vitreous Haze is provided in  
Table 7. 
Investigators will grade cases of ocular inflamma tion according to these scales.  
Grading of anterior vitreous cells will be performed based on the slit -lamp examination 
utilizing a 1  mm by 1  mm slit -lamp beam and the same grading scheme used for anterior 
chamber cells ( Table 4). 
Grading of vitreous haze will be performed in a standardized fashion by the central  
ophthalmology reading center, based on color fundus photos of the posterior pole. Baseline  
color fundus photos will be obtained at Visit 1 ( long-term follow -up study) for all subjects and 
fundus photos will be obtained at each visit thereafter. The N IH grading system23 will be used 
to grade the vitreous haze on the fundus photo. Table 7 and photos will serve as the basis for 
vitreous haze grading.

10.4 Monitoring of Subjects with Adverse Events  
Each subject must be carefully monitored for AEs. After an initial SAE report the Investigator is 
required to follow -up proactively each subject and provide further information to the Sponsor or 
designee on the subject’s condition. Subjects who experience the onset of an AE thought to be 
related to IMP or IV T inj ection prior to their final visit (Visit 5/EOS) will be monitored until the 
resolution of the AE or for 30 days after the AE occurs, whichever comes fir st. AEs not resolved 
after 30 days will be listed in the CRF as continuing/not resolved.

Page 47 of 65 10.5 Other Safety A ssessments  
10.5.1  Clinical Laboratory, Physical Examination, Vital Signs  Parameters , and ECG 
For laboratory parameters, physical examination findings , vital signs,  and ECG  any clinically 
significant abnormalities  that are causally related to the study medication or study procedure in 
the judgment of the Investigator will be recorded as AEs.  
In the event of unexplained abnormal laboratory test values, the tests should be repeated  
immediately and monitored until the  values  have returned to the reference  range and/or an 
adequate explanation of the abnormality is identified . 
10.5.2  Concomitant Medications  
During the study, any medication taken by the subject is to be reported by the subj ect. Any 
changes in concomitant therapy  during the study will be documented, including cessation of 
therapy, initiation of therapy, and dose changes . The Investigator or designee will record any 
concomitant therapies given for the treatment of AEs on the concomitant medication page of the 
subject’s source document and eCRF. 
10.6 Procedures in Case of Pregnancy  
If a subject or the partner of a male subject becomes pregnant  during the study , the subject  should 
inform the I nvestigator and provide a copy of the positive pregnancy test and estimated date of 
the pregnancy . Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that  the 
IMP may have interfered with the effectiveness  of a contraceptive medication. 
The outcome of all pregnancies (i.e., spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth , 
or congenital abnormality) that begin before Visit 5 must be followed up and documented even 
if the subject was discontinued from the study.  A pregnancy outcome of a congenital 
abnormality /birth defect  or of a spontaneous miscarriage would qualify as an SAE and be reported 
to the Sponsor or designee  for processing to the regulatory authorities . A pregnancy outcome of 
an elective abortion without evidence of  complications  would not be processed as an AE.

Page 48 of 65 11. STATISTICAL ANALYS IS 
Data base lock , statistical programming and analysis, and reporti ng will be performed by the CRO . 
11.1 Data Collection, Database Lock, and Coding of Terms 
Electronic CRF /electronic data capture will be used for data collection during the long- term 
follow-up study and a Data Management Plan will be prepared by the CRO, PRA Health Sciences , 
detailing the procedures leading to database lock . Assessment data from the RESCUE/REVERSE 
clinical database that is needed to complete the statistical s ummaries and analyses that are 
required for this long -term follow -up study will be imported into the GS -LHON -CLIN -06 clinical 
database. When the GS-LHON -CLIN -06 clinical database has been found to be complete and 
accurate, the database will be locked. Any changes to the database after that time can on ly be 
made by written agreement between GenSight Bio logics  and PRA.  
Coexistent diseases and AEs will be coded using the current version of MedDRA. Pr evious and 
concomitant medications will be coded using the la test available World Health Organization 
(WHO ) Drug Reference Dictionary.  
11.2 Statistical Analysis Plan  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared after the protocol is a pproved and before 
database lock occurs. The SAP will provide further details regarding the endpoint s, data handling 
rules, and the statistical methods to be used to address all stud y objectives  and endpoints. The 
SAP will also include display formats for the summary and analysis tables, listings, and graphical 
displays. 
Data for quantitative variables will be presented by arithmetic mean (for ot her continuous 
variables), standard dev iation (SD) median, first quartile (Q1), third quartile (Q3), minimum and 
maximum. Data for categorical and binary variables (responder analysis) will be presented by 
counts and percentages. Least square means, 95% confidence interval  (CI) and P -values  will be 
reported derived from models and statistical tests.  
11.3 Sample Size Estimation  
A formal sample size calculation  will not be performed because  this is an extension study and no 
inferential  or formal statistics  of the primary endpoint of the study will be conducted.  The study 
population is limited to the number of subjects treated in the RESCUE and REVERSE  studies. 
11.4 Analysis Populations 
11.4.1  Safety Population 
The safety population will be  defined as all  subjects who received study medication  in RESCUE 
or REVERSE Phase III studies and consented to be enrolled in this long -term follow -up study . 
This population will be used as the population for all safety analyses.  
11.4.2  Intent -to-treat Population  
The intent -to-treat population will be defined as all subjects who received study medication i n 
RESCUE or REVERSE Phase III studies and consented to be enrolled in this long -term follow -
up study. This population will be used as the population for efficacy and QOL analy ses. This

11.5 Statistical Methods  
11.5.1  Safety Analys es 
Primary  Safety Analysis 
Adverse events and SAEs related to GS010 IVT injection or study procedure wil l be summarized 
in two different ways: (1) systemic AEs and SAEs related to study drug/procedure, and (2) ocular 
AEs and SAEs related to study drug/procedure. Systemic AE data will be su mmarized by all 
subjects. Ocular AE data will be summarized by sham eye only and GS010 eye only.  
Clinically significant abnorm al findings observed during physical examination, vital signs 
measurement, ECG recording, or laboratory values will be summarized as AEs i n the AE tables 
if the clinically significant abnormal finding is deemed as causally related to the  study medication 
or study procedure. 
The following summaries will be produced for (1) SAEs unrelated to study drug /study procedure , 
(2) systemic AEs/SAEs related to study drug/procedure , and (3)  ocular AEs/SAEs related to study 
drug/study procedure, using counts and percentage as follows: 
• Overall summary of AEs/SAEs related to study drug/procedure 
• AEs related to GS010 IVT injection or study procedure, including the number of events 
reported  
• AEs/SAEs related to GS010 IVT injection or study procedure by maximum severity  
• AEs/SA Es related to GS010 IVT injection or study procedure leading to study 
discontinuation 
• SAEs related to GS010 IVT injection or study procedure 
• SAEs related to GS010 IVT injection or study procedure leading to death . 
Events will be coded using the  MedDRA  and summarized by  system organ class and preferred 
term. 
Secondary  Safety Analysis 
The number, type, frequency, and severity of ocular or vision -related AEs, including those with 
no relation or any relation to the GS010 IVT injection or study procedure will be pre sented in the 
same way that the primary endpoint of ocular AEs/SAEs related  to GS010 IVT injection or study 
procedure.

11.5.2.2  LogMAR 
Analysis for European Medicines Agency  
The primary analysis will be performed on the  intent- to-treat (ITT) population . The change fr om 
baseline to e ach follow -up visit in the LogMAR acuity will be the response. The change from 
baseline of all -GS010 eyes will be compared to the change from baseline of all -sham eyes (intra -
subject comparison) using a mixed -effects ANCOVA model  using the following terms (or 
covariate) in the model: 
• Subject  and eyes of the subject as random factors  
• The baseline LogMAR  
• Treatment  
The investigative site  will not be included in th is analysis as the number of subjects recruited per 
site will be very small. However, stratification by geographical area will be p erformed as a 
sensitivity analysis. Neighboring countries can be pooled to reach at least 9  subjects  per 
geographical entity. The analysis will be performed based on alpha of 0.05 (two- sided test).  
An additional model will add the treatment by geographical interaction to investigate  lack of 
generalizability of the treatment effect.  
Analysis for Food and Drug Administration 
The primary analysis will be performed on the ITT population. The change from baseline of  the 
best-GS010 treated eyes will be compared to the change from baseline of the best -sham eyes 
(inter -subject comparison) using an ANCOVA with baseline LogMAR as covariate.  The analysis 
will be performed using an  alpha of 0.05 (two -sided test). The statistical significance in favor of 
the best -GS010 treated eyes against the best -sham eyes will show evidence of the advantage of 
using GS010 for halting visual acuity loss or imp roving visual acuity in subjects with LHON. 
The difference in the mean change from baseline (adjusted mean difference) between th e two 
treatment groups and associated 95% confidence interval will be reported.  
The center will not be included in the analysis  as the number of subjects recruited per site will be 
very small. However, stratification by geographical area will be performed as a s ensitivity 
analysis. Neighboring countries can be pooled together to reach at least 9 s ubjects per 
geographical entity. The pooling of countries will be performed during the masked  review of data.  
An additional model will add the treatment by geographical area interaction to test fo r a lack of 
generalizability of the treatment effect . 
The same analysis will be repeated for worst -GS010 treated eyes against worst-s ham eyes.

Thickness/Volume and Topographical Map  
The change of GCL  thickness/volume and topographical map and other parameters measured by  
SD-OCT (e.g., retinal nerve fib er layer) from baseline to each follow -up visit will be based on 
mixed -effects ANCOVA , including the subject and the eyes of the subject as random factors, the 
treatment and the baseline GCL  thickness/volume as covariates in the model. The analysis will 
be performed using an  alpha of 0.05  (two-sided test). The difference in the mean change from 
baseline (adjusted mean difference) to each follow -up visit b etween the two trea tment groups (all -
GS010 vs all-sham) and associated 95% confid ence interval will be reported.  
The analysis will also be performed for the best -GS010 treated eyes compared to best -sham eyes; 
and worst -GS010 treated eyes compared to worst -sham eyes. The analysis will be similar to the 
FDA analysis of change of LogMAR  from baseline to the follow-up visits. 
11.5.2.4   Responder Analysis  
Eye responder and subject responder are defined in Section 8.2.2. 
Responder analyses at  all the follow -up visits will  compar e all-GS010 eyes against all -sham eyes  
based on a McNemar test . The analysis will  also be performed to compare  best-GS010 eyes 
again st best -sham eyes and worst -GS010 eyes against worst -sham  eyes using the Fisher e xact 
test. 
For the subject responder endpoint, randomization test will be performed  for each of  the follow -
up visits. 
11.5.2.5   Time C ourse Analysis 
Time course analysis will compare time course of the response up to Visit 5 (Year 5) using 
MMRM (Mixed Model Repeated Measure) procedure. The change from baseline in the LogMAR  
and change from baseline in log of contrast sensitivity (LogCS ) will be the response s. The change 
from ba seline of all -GS010 eyes will be compared to the change from baseline of all -sham eyes 
using a MMRM including the subject and the eyes of the subject as random factors, t he treatment, 
follow-up v isit, eye status at baseline (better or worse), interaction b etween baseline values and 
treatment, interaction between linear time from onset of disease and treatment, in teraction 
between eye status at baseline and treatment, interaction between linear time  and treatment and 
baseline LogMAR as predictors in the mode l. The estimate of treatment effect at various follow -
up time points and its 95% confidence interval (CI) (without adjustment for multiplicit y) will be 
presented. Compound symmetry  structure will be fitted. In case of any convergence problem with 
this covariance structure, other covariance structures will be used. 
Time course analysis of Humphrey visual field parameters and SD -OCT parameters will be 
conducted similarly to  the time course analysis of LogMAR (details will be provided in the SAP).  
11.5.2.6   Humphrey Visual Field Parameters  
Mean  deviation in decibels of sensitivity and foveal threshold  sensitivities at all the follow -up 
visits and change from baseline to each follow -up visit will be summarized by all -GS010 eyes

The Sponsor has ethical, legal, and scientific obligations to conduct this study in a ccordan ce with 
established research principles and ICH GCP guidelines.  
12.1 Data Collection and Data Management 
Study- specific data outlined in the protocol will be entered into the clinical database b y 
individual(s) designated by the Investigator. Data will be verifi ed electronically using a series of 
online programmed edit checks created by the Clinical Data Manager, and programmed by th e 
Clinical Data Programmer or Designee. Data discrepancies will be brou ght to the attention of the 
clinical team and investigated by  the clinical research associate ( CRA ) and site staff. The CRAs 
will review and verify all data collected in the eCRF against source documentation, during 
scheduled monitoring visits. The CRA will work closely with the site staff to add ress any 
discrepancies, so that proper resolutions can be made and documented in the clinical databa se. 
An audit trail will track all changes made to the data.  
12.2 Database Quality Assurance 
The clinical database will be reviewed and checked for omissions, apparent err ors, and values 
requiring further clarification, using computerized and manual procedures. D ata queries requiring 
clarification will be generated and addressed by the investigational site. O nly authorized 
personnel will make corrections to the clinical dat abase, and all corrections will be documented 
in an audit trail.  
12.3 Routine Monitoring  
In order to maintain current of study progress, the Sponsor's monitors or representat ives will visit 
the investigative sites during study conduct, in addition to maintainin g telephone and written 
communication. On site visits, telephone calls, and regular inspection of the eCRFs will be 
conducted in order to assess subject enrolment, compliance with protocol procedures, 
completeness and accuracy of data entered on the eCRFs, verification of eCRF data against 
original source documents, and occurrence of AEs. The Investigator must provide the  monitor 
with full access to all source and study documents.  
The Investigator must agree to Sponsor -authorized personnel having direct acce ss to the clinical 
(or associated) files and clinical study supplies (dispensing and storage areas) for all study 
subjects considered for study entry for the purpose of verifying entries made in t he eCRF, and 
assist with their activities, if requested. Ade quate time and space for CRA monitoring visits 
should be made available by the Investigator. 
The site must complete the CRFs in a timely manner and on an ongoing basis to allow r eview by 
the CRA . 
12.4 Inspections and Auditing Procedures  
The Sponsor or its representative may conduct audits at the investigative sites i ncluding, but not 
limited to, presence of required documents, the informed consent process, and comparison of 
eCRFs with source documents. All medical records (progress notes)  must be available for audit. 
The Investigator agrees to participate with audits conducted at a convenient t ime in a reasonable 
manner.

13.1 Electronic Case Report Forms  
The Investigator is responsible for the quality of the data recorded in the eCRFs. The data entered 
should be a complete and accurate account of the subject’s record collected during  the study. 
Study data are not to be imputed  directly into the eCRF, but must be collected first in primary 
source documents at the clinical site. Completion of source documents will pr ecede the 
completion of t he eCRF. Source documents may be electronic, hard copy, or a combination of 
both. Source documents are defined as the results of original observations and activit ies of a 
clinical investigation. They include, but are not limited to, progress notes, elec tronic data, 
screening logs, telephone interviews, and recorded data from automated instruments. All source  
documents pertaining to this study will be maintained by the Investigators and mad e available for 
direct inspection by the authorized study personnel outlined in the ICF. The eCRF will be 
considered the source document for individual CRF elements such as study -specific scales if 
those data are collected directly onto a CRF.  
Data collection will be completed according to the guidelines provided by the S ponsor or its 
designee in writing. All required data are to be recorded using the source documents for  every 
subject who signed an informed consent. Site staff will be trained on the eCRF completion 
guidelines and requirements for source documentation. 
Compl eted eCRFs will be reviewed by the study monitor in line with CRF review guidelines. T he 
Sponsor or its designee will review every subject’s eCRF  and 100% source data verification  
(SDV)  will be required for all d ata; and this includes the Annesley Brain Ey e Center  worksheets. 
Eligibility failure CRFs and source documents require 100% SDV. Any discrepancies found 
during the CRF review will be clarified by the Investigator or designated indi vidual. This includes 
on-site CRF reviews by the Sponsor or its designee, or during quality assurance review of the 
data.  
A justification must be documented for any missing data. Any changes in the study progress notes 
and other source documents will be initialed and dated by a site staff member author ized to make 
the chang e. Changes will be made by striking a single line through erroneous data (so a s not to 
obliterate the original data), and clearly entering the correct data (e .g., wrong data right data). If 
the reason for the change is not apparent, a brief explanation for  the change will be written by the 
clinician in the source documentation. 
The Investigator must sign and date a declaration attesting to his/her respo nsibility for the quality 
of all data recorded, and that the data represents a complete and accurate recor d of each subjec t’s 
participation in the study.  
All eCRF entries, corrections, and alterations must be made by the Investigator or de signated 
individual. The Investigator or designated individual must adjust the eCRF (if applicable) and 
complete the query.  
13.2 Source Documents Maintenance  
The Investigator must c omplete a subject identification and enrolment log to allow easy 
identification of each subject during and after the study. This document wi ll be reviewed by the 
Sponsor site contact for completeness. The subject identification and enrolment log  should rem ain

RESCUE and REVERSE Long -term Follow -up  Version 2.0;  17 September  2018  
 
Page 57 of 65 confidential and will be filed in the Investigator Site File. To ensure subje ct confidentiality, no 
copy will be made. All reports and communications relating to the study will identif y subjects by 
assigned number only. The Investigator must also compl ete a subject eligibility  log, which reports 
on all subjects who were seen to determine eligibility for inclusion in the study . 
At a minimum, source documentation must be available to confirm: subject identification,  
eligibility, and study identification; explanation of the study and date of informed consent; dates 
of visits; results of safety and efficacy parameters as required by the proto col; record of all AEs; 
concomitant medications; date of study completion or early discontinuation, and reason f or ear ly 
discontinuation if applicable. 
The original signed informed consent  for each subject  shall be filed with records kept by the 
Investigator and a copy shall be given to the subject. 
 
13.3 Record Maintenance  
All documents pertaining to the study, including all versions of the approved study protocol , copy 
of the informed consent document, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
documents, completed eCRFs, source documents ( e.g., subject records, hospital records, 
laboratory recor ds, drug accountabili ty records ), and other study -related documents will be 
retained in the permanent archives of the study site. 
The Investigator must therefore notify and obtain approval in writing from the Spons or prior to 
destruction of any study records or provide an opportunity for the Sponsor to collect such rec ords. 
If the Investigator withdraws from the study (e .g., relocation, retirement) all study -related records 
should be transferred, in a written agreement with the Sponsor, to a mutually agre ed-upon 
designee within  a Sponsor- specified timeframe.  
Records must be retained in accordance with the current ICH Guidelines on GCP. All essential 
study documents including records of subject s, source documents, CRF s and study drug i nventory 
must be kept on file. 
Essential documents shoul d be retained until at least 2  years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketin g 
applications in an I CH region, or until at least 2  years have elapsed  since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational products. However, esse ntial 
documents may be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regul atory 
requirements or by agreement with the Sponsor. The Sponsor is responsible for informing t he 
Investigator when these documents need no longer be retained. 
The Investigator will not dispose of any records relevant to this study without wr itten permission 
from the Sponsor and will provide the Sponsor the opportunity to collect such records. The 
Investigator shall take responsibility for maintaining adequate and accur ate hard copy source 
documents of all observations and data generated during this study. Such documentation is subject  
to inspection by the Sponsor, its r epresentatives and regulatory authorities.  
If an Investigator moves, withdraws from an investigation or retires  the responsibility for 
maintaining the records may be transferred to another person who will accept re sponsibility.

Page 58 of 65 Notice of transfer must be m ade to and agreed by the Sponsor. 
13.4 Confidentiality  
All information obtained during the conduct of the study with respect to the subject ’s state of 
health will be regarded as confidential. For disclosure of any such information, a n agreeme nt will 
be obtained in writing. 
The Investigator must ensure that each subject ’s anonymity is maintained. On eCRF s and other 
documents submitted to the Sponsor or the CRO, subject s must not be identified by name. Instead, 
subject s will only be known by the unique sub ject number allocated to them in order to ensure 
confidentia lity on all study documentation . Subject s will retain this unique number throughout 
the study. The Investigator will keep a separate log of these codes.  
In order to comply with government regulatory guidelines and to ensure subject  safety, it may be 
necessary for the Sponsor and its representative, the CRO personnel, the local research review 
board, or  the competent authorities  to review subject s’ medical records as they relate to this study. 
Only the subject ’s unique number on the CRF s will identify him/her, but their full names may be 
made known to a drug regulatory authority or other authorized government or health care 
officials, if necessary , and to personnel designated by the Sponsor. 
All subject bodily fluids, and/or other materials collected shall be used sole ly in accordance with 
this protocol and the informed consent signed by the subject, unless otherwise agreed to in w riting 
by the sub ject. 
Documents that are not for submission to the Sponsor or the CRO will be maintained by t he 
Investigator in strict confidence, except to the extent necessary to allow mon itoring by the 
Sponsor and the CRO, and auditing by regulatory authorities. No doc uments identifying subject s 
by name will leave the investigative site and subject  identity will remain confidential in all 
publications related to the study.

(Fortaleza 2013 ) (available in the I nvestigator study file) and all applicable national and local 
regulatory requirements  and with ICH guidelines regarding scientific integrity (E4, E8, E9 , and 
E10). Additionally, i n Europe t his study will be conducted in compliance with IEC, in accordance 
with applicable regulations regarding clinical safety data management (E2A , E2B [R3]), European 
Community directives 2001/20, 2001/83, 2003/94 , 2005/28 , and 2016/679  (General Data 
Protection Regulation)  as enacted into local law . In the U nited States , this study will be conducted 
in compliance with IRB,  Title 21 Part 56 of the US A Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) relating 
to IRBs and GCP as described in the US FDA CFR (21 CFR § 50, 56, 312) - in accordance with 
applicable ICH regulations regarding clinical safety  data management (E2A, E2B[ R3]). 
14.2 Regulatory Approval 
GenSight or their appointed agents will be responsible for ensuring that appropriate regulator y 
authority approvals are obtained, according to local country requirements.  No subject  may enter 
the study until this approval has been obtained. A copy of the approval (where one is provided, 
according to local country requirements) will be provided to the Investigator a nd to the IRB/IEC . 
14.3 Protocol Compliance  
In accordance with ICH Topic E6 ( R2) Guideline for GCP the Investigator should not implement 
any deviation from, or changes of the protocol without agreement by the Sponsor and documented 
approval from the IRB/IEC of a protocol amendment , except where necessary to eliminate an 
immediate hazard(s) to study subjects, or when the change(s) involves only logistical or 
administrative aspects of the study (e.g., change in monitor[s], change of telephone number[s] ). 
Protocol amendment (s) must be approved by the Sponsor  and comply with national  requirements . 
A protocol amendment must be submitted to the appropriate regulatory authorities and to the 
IRB/IEC  assuming this responsibility. The Investigator must await IRB/IEC  approval of protoc ol 
amendments before implementing the changes, except where necessary to elim inate apparent 
immediate hazard to subject s. In these cases, the IRB/IEC  must be notified within 5 business days 
of the change.  All amendments to the protocol must be approved by both the appropriate 
regulatory authorities and the IRB/IEC , except for administrative revisions , which require 
notification  only. 
14.4 Protocol Adherence and Deviations  
Any protocol deviation related to the conduct of the study, subject management, or subje ct 
assessment will be documented and discussed with the Investigator on a case by  case basis. 
Protocol deviations will not be approved prospectively. 
The protocol must be read thoroughly and the instructions must be followed. However, excepti ons 
will be made in emergency situations when the protection, safety, and well -being of the subject 
requires immediate intervention based on the judgment of the Investigator or a res ponsible, 
appropriately trained, and credentialed professional(s) designated by the Investigator as a sub -
investigator. In the event of a significant protocol deviation due to an emergency, ac cident, or

Page 60 of 65 error, the Investigator or designee must contact the Medical Monitor at the earliest possible time 
by telephone. This allows for an early joint decision to be made as to whether or not t he subject  
should continue in the study. The Investigator, the Sponsor, and the Medical Monitor will 
document this decision. 
14.5 Contractual and Financial Details 
The Investigator (and/or, as appropriate, the hospital administrative re presentative) and the Sponsor 
will sign a clinical study agreement prior to the start of the study, outlining o verall Sponsor and 
Investigator responsibilities in relation to the study. The contract sho uld describe whether costs for 
pharmacy, laboratory and other protocol -required services are being paid directly or indirectly.  
The disclosure of any financial interests from each Investigator or sub -Investigator is required for 
this study, including financial interests of the spouse and each dependent chil d of the Investigator 
who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects tha t could affect the 
reliability of data submitted  to regulatory authorities. Financial Disclosure Statements will need 
to be completed, as requested by FDA CFR 21 P art 54  for all US Investigators; and by EU 
Investigators if data from these sites will be used to support a New Drug Applic ation in the US. 
ICH requires that the clinical Investigator make all clinical trial -related records available for 
direct access by the CRA , auditor, IRB, or regulatory agency  and that financial aspects of the trial 
be in the Investigator's files. The FDA currently does not  require financial records or mandate 
"direct access" (312.62).

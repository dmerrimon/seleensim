Title of Study:
A Multi-center, Randomized, Double -blind, Placebo -controlled Study  to Evaluate the 
Efficacy  and Safet y of Immune Globulin (Human), 10% Caprylate/Chromatograph y Purified 
(IGIV -C) in Sy mptomatic Subjects with Generalized My asthenia Gravis
Study Number
GTI1408
Phase:
2
Number of Subjects Planned:
Approximately  62 adult subjects will be randomized .
Study Centers Planned:
Approximately  40 study  centers
Study Objectives:
The primary  objective is to evaluate the efficacy  of IGIV -C in subjects with generaliz ed 
myasthenia gravis ( MG)on standard of care treatment at study  entry  in terms of 
improvement in MG sy mptoms as measured b y the mean change in Quantitative My asthenia 
Gravis ( QMG )score from Baseline (Week 0) to Week 24 as compared to placebo .
The safet y objective of this study  is to evaluate the safet y and tolerability of IGIV -C loading 
dose of 2 g/kg followed by 7 maintenance dosages of 1 g/kg every  3 weeks through Week 21 
in subjects with MG.
Target Population:
Eligible participants for this study  will include adult subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of 
generalized MG who are receiving standard of care MG treatment, but continue to have 
symptoms of MG as demonstrated by  a QMG ≥ 10 points.
Overall Study Description:
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study  to evaluate the 
efficacy  and safet y of IGIV -C in subjects with MG who are sy mptomatic on standard of care 
treatment. Subjects will be randoml y allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either IGIV -C or 
matched placebo every  three weeks in double -blinded fashion. Randomization will be 
stratifie d by sentinel features of the subject’s B aseline standard of care MG treatment 
regimen at the time randomization: 
Regimen includes ONLY cholinesterase inhibitors
Regimen includes corticosteroid (CS) as the ONLY 
IMMUNOSUPPRESSANT/IMMUNOMODULATOR , alone or in combination 
with other MG medications (e.g., a subject on prednisone plus a cholinesterase 
inhibitor would be in this stratum)
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 5of 98Regimen includes ANY NON -CS 
IMMUNOSUPPRESSANT/IMMUNOMODULATOR alone or in combination 
with other MG medications which may  include CS (e.g., a subject on azathioprine, 
prednisone, and a cholinesterase inhibitor would be in th is stratum)
For those subjects randomized to receive IGIV -C, an initial loading dose of 2 g/kg of body  
weight will be administered after the Baseline assessments are complete at Baseline (Week 0, 
Visit 1) followed by  maintenance doses of 1 g/kg of body  weight administered every  third 
week through Week 21 (Visit 8). The initial loading dose (2 g/kg) will be divided o n 2 
consecutive day s with extension of up to 4 consecutive day s to account for 
tolerability /weight >80 kg. The subsequent 7 maintenance dosages (1 g/kg) will be infused 
on one day  with an extension to 2 consecutive days (divided doses) to account for 
tolerability /weight >80 kg. For both loading and maintenance infusions the limit for blinded 
IGIV -C infusion is no more than 80 g/day , corresponding to an 80-kg body  weight for a 1 
g/kg per diem dosage .
For those subjects randomized to receive placebo, a sterile 0.9% sodium chloride injection, 
United States Pharmacopeia ( USP)or equivalent will be infused at the Baseline/Week 0 Visit 
(Visit 1) using the same volume as would be required for the IGIV -C loading dose. 
Subsequent placebo maintenance doses will be matched in volume to the IGIV -C 
maintenance doses and administered every  third week until Week 21 ( Visit 8).
The Investigator s will hold the subjec ts’ current background medical regimen constant from 
Screening through the end of the study  (Week 24, Visit 9), unless there is a compelling 
emergent medical need to make medication adjustments , the subject discontinues the study  
because criteria for Treat ment Failure are met as defined in Section 3.3.3 (after End of Study  
visit assessments are complete), or adverse effects due to other components of the subject’s 
therap y become untenable ; in such cases ,the Medical Monitor must be contacted.
Week 21 (Visit 8) is the time of the last investigational product (IP) maintenance dosage. 
Week 24 (Visit 9) will constitute the primary  endpoint time point for analy sis because this 
timing allows an opportunity  to assess the effect of the final IP infusion made at Week 21 
(Visit 8). Week 24 (Visit 9) will serve as the final End of Study  Visit.
Study Phases:
Screening :
During the three -week Screening P hase, assessments will be performed to determine subject 
eligibility .
Baseline :
Eligible subjects will have the Baseline assessments performed and will be randomized to 
receive either IGIV-C or placebo. After randomization, a loading dose of the blinded I P will 
be administered (Week 0, Visit 1).
IP Maintenance Phase :
Maintenance infusions of blinded I P will be given over 1 day every  three weeks at Week 3

End of Study /Earl y Termination:
Subjects will have an End of Study  Visit at Week 24 (Visit 9). 
Key Assessments and Procedures
During the course of the study , subjects will receive scheduled general physical 
examinations, neurological assessments of strength , functional ability and endurance, qualit y 
of life assessments, and laboratory  evaluations.
Duration of Treatment:
Subjects will receive a loading dose of IP at the Baseline Visit (Week 0, Visit 1) in divided 
doses on two day s and will then receive IP infusions every  3 weeks on one day  from Week 3 
(Visit 2) until Week 21 (Visit 8).

Study Procedures:
Subjects deemed eligible based on Screening evaluations will complete the Baseline 
assessments, thereb y initiating double -blind treatment. Subjects will continue with 
assessments for 24 weeks, with scheduled assessments at Week 0 (Visit 1) (Baseline and 
loading infusion divided on 2consecutive days), followed by  assessments and maintenance 
doses every  3 weeks through Week 21 (Visit 8). The time point for assessment of the primary  
endpoint is Week 24 (Visit 9). Visits/procedures a nd assessments should be scheduled within
± 3 day s of the protocol-specified timing. T he main protocol text and tabular summary
Schedule of Study  Procedures ( Appendix 1 )provide additional details .Tools for assessi ng 
MG are provided in Appendix 2 to Appendix 6.
The QMG score and MG Composite will be assessed at every  visit. Therefore before each 
visit, subjects must withhold th eir acet ylcholinesterase inhibitor (e.g., p yridostigmine) dosage 
for 12 hours prior to the visit to assure accurate assessment of the QMG. The MG-Activities 
of Daily  Living (MG -ADL) and the 15- item MG Quality -of-Life Instrument (MG -QOL 15) 
are assessed at Baseline, Week 9 (Visit 4), Week 15 (Visit 6), and Week 24 (Visit 9). Safet y 
assessments include vital signs performed at each visit, clinical laborato ry testing and 
physical examinations performed at Screening, Baseline, Week 9 (Visit 4), Week 15 (Visit 
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 9of 986), and Week 24 (Visit 9) , assessments of adverse e vents (AEs) throughout the study , and 
targeted evaluation sfor potential thromboembolism risk and hemoly sis at time points 
designated in Appendix 1 and Section 3.8 of the protocol.  
Investigational Produc t, Dose, and Mode of Administration:
Immune Globulin (Human), 10% Capry late/Chromatography  Purified (IGIV -C)
Immune Globulin I njection (Human), 10%, Caprylate/Chromatography  Purified (IGIV -C) is 
the active IP for this study , which is a marketed product. I GIV-C glass vials may  be supplied 
in the vial sizes of 10 mL, 25 mL , 50 mL, 100 mL, and 200 mL . The i nfusion solution will be 
visually  masked to maintain the blind.
Administration of I P will be via the IV route, and will be administered in a double -blinded
fashion. The unblinded pharmacist or designee will prepare the I P to maintain the blind for 
all parties during infusions and study assessments. Reference the Pharmacy  Manual for 
additional details.
Placebo
Sterile 0.9% sodium chloride injection, USP (0.9% NaCl, USP) or equivalent will be used as 
placebo to maintain the blind. The i nfusion solution will be at a volume approximate to that 
required for the appropriate weight-based dose of IGIV- C and visually  masked to maintain 
the blind.
Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study . Subjects will be randomized in 
a 1:1 ratio via Interactive Web Response System ( IWRS ) into IGIV-C treatment group and 
Placebo treatment group to rec eive either IGIV- C or matching p lacebo every  three weeks in a 
double -blind fashion via IV administration.
Preparation of Investigational Products
The volume (i.e., total infusion dose administered) of IP to be prepared for each IV infusion 
will be individualized for each subject based on body  weight, and the protocol specified 
loading dose of 2 g/kg divided over 2 days starting after the randomization at Baseline 
(Week 0), followed b y maintenance doses of 1 g/kg administered over 1 day  every  three 
weeks until Week 21 (Visi t 8). The infusion solution will be visually  masked to maintain the 
blind.
Note that the loading dosage is divided over 2 days as standard infusion time; however, 
extensions up to 4 day s are allowed for tolerability issues or higher weight, i.e., limit for
IGIV -C infusion is no more than 80 g/day  (corresponding to 80 kg body  weight). Similarl y, 
the maintenance dosage is infused o n 1 day  as standard; however, extension is allowed for 
divided dosage over 2 consecutive days for tolerability  issues or higher we ight, i.e., limit for 
IGIV -C infusion is no more than 80 g/day  (corresponding to 80 kg body  weight).
The unblinded pharmacist must inspect I GIV-C visually  before preparing for administration 
to subjects. The solution must not be used if turbid or if it con tains visible particles. Solution

Definition and Management of Treatment Failures Due to MG Worsening:
During the study , MG worsening will be defined as:
•QMG increase b y ≥4 points relative to Baseline/Week 0
All subjects will remain in the study  until at least Week 9 (Visit 4) is completed. No 
premature discontinuation of I P administration is to be made for reasons of Treatment Failure 
(QMG increase b y ≥4points relative to Baseline/Week 0 ) until the subject receives at least a 
total of 3 complete doses of the IP, which includes the initial loading dose and the first two 
maintenance doses irrespective of the QMG scores measured at Week 3 and Week 6 (Visit 2 
and Visit 3) in order to allow time for the investigational medicinal product to potentially  
produce a beneficial effect . 
At Week 9 (Visit 4) through Week 21 (Visit 8), if the subject suffers a worsening of his/her 
MG sy mptoms defined as a QMG increase ≥ 4 points relative to Baselin e (Week 0), and this 
worsening is confirmed at the next scheduled consecutive visit , the subject will discontinue 
from the study . The earliest withdrawal for Treatment Failure will be at Week 9 and would 
occur onl y if QMG scor e is increased b y 4 points or more (relative to Baseline) at both Week 
6 (Visit 3) and Week 9 (Visit 4).
Safety Evaluation:
Safety  will be assessed throughout the clinical trial for all individuals who have received at 
least one infusion of the IP. The f ollowing safet y variables will be assessed in this study :
Adverse events (AEs), suspected adverse drug reactions (Suspected ADRs), adverse 
reactions (ARs), serious AEs (SAEs), and discontinuations due to AEs and SAEs 
(including m yasthenic crisis)
Vital Sig ns (temperature [T], respiratory  rate [RR], heart rate [HR], sy stolic blood 
pressure [SBP] and diastolic blood pressure [DBP]); during infusions vital signs will be 
carefully  monitored.
Physical examinations: phy sical exams will be recorded as normal or ab normal, 
according to the ph ysician’s judgment criteria, and findings will be recorded.
Blood chemistry  and Hematology
Thromboembolic events (TEs) and hemol ysis events
Management and Recording of Adverse Events
AEs (includes Suspected ADRs) occurring at a ny time between signature of the subject’s 
informed consent form ( ICF) and the last day  of the subject’s participation in the clinical trial 
will be reported and recorded on the appropriate subject’s electronic case report form ( eCRF )
entry . 
It is the Inv estigator’s responsibility  to ensure that all AEs are appropriately recorded. 
AEs will be elicited b y spontaneous reporting b y the study  individual or by  a non -leading 
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 11of 98inquiry  or direct observation by  the study  staff.
This study  will utilize a n Independen t Safet y Review Committee (I SRC) whose members 
(from Grifols) will be impartial and independent of the clinical trial team. The clinical trial 
team will remain blinded to subject treatment assignment. The ISRC will review relevant 
safet y information from t he study  as outlined in the I SRC Charter. At a minimum, after the 
first 20 subjects are enrolled and have completed half of the treatment period, the I SRC will 
conduct a safet y review of the following data at a minimum:
AEs, SAEs, and discontinuations due to AEs and SAEs
Vital signs
Blood chemistry  and hematology
Assessing for TEs
Assessing for hemol ysis
During the study , the Medical Monitor will review all relevant safet y information from the 
study  in order to protect subject welfare and preserve study  integrity . Data to be reviewed 
include but are not limited to the following: eCRFs, listings from the clinical and safety  
databases, AEs/SAE reports, concomitant medications, laboratory  data, vital signs, and 
physical examinations data.
Clinical Outcome Meas ures:
Primary  Efficacy  Variable
The primary  endpoint is improvement in MG sy mptoms as measured b y the mean change in 
QMG score from Baseline (Week 0) to Week 24 as compared to placebo .

Statistical and Analytical Methods:
Determination of Sample Size
Assuming that the IGIV treatment group is 50% better than the Placebo group, with 
alpha=0.05 and two -sided test, 28 subjects are needed for each treatment group (total 56 
subjects) to have at le ast 80% power to detect the treatment difference. Assuming a 10% drop 
out rate, 62 subjects are planned to be randomized.
Subject Populations for Analy sis
Intent -To-Treat (I TT) Population
The ITT population consists of all subjects who are randomized. 
Safety  Population
The Safet y population consists of all subjects who received an y amount of IP.  
Per Protocol (PP ) Population
The PP population consists of all subjects in I TT population without any  major protocol 
deviation which has impact on the primary efficacy  data. Any  deviations from the protocol 
will be recorded i n the protocol deviation list. The validity  of a subject for inclusion in the PP 
population will be assessed at a review meeting that will take place b efore finalizing the 
database. The revi ew meeting will review the protocol deviation list, as well as data listings. 
If protocol deviations are identified which justify  removing a subject from the PP population, 
then these decisions will be documented.
Primary  Efficacy  Anal yses
The primary  efficacy  endpoint is the change in QMG score from Baseline (Week 0) to Week 
24. The treatment comparison will be performed using anal ysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
with change in QMG score as dependent variable, treatment and Baseline standard of care 
treatment regimen as fixed factors and Baseline QMG score as a covariate. The null 
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 13of 98hypothesis (H0) and the alternative h ypothesis (Ha) are:  
H0: μ1 = μ2 
Ha: μ1 ≠  μ2
Where μ1 and μ2 represent the population mean in IGIV -C and Placebo group, respectivel y.
For subjects who discontinued the study  early, the last observation carried forward (LOCF) 
method will be used to impute the change in QMG from Baseline to Week 24. A sensitivity  
analysis of completers with non -missing QMG score at Week 24 will be performe d. For 
subjects who experience treatment f ailure ( as defined in Section 3.3.3 ) or myasthenic crisis
(as defined in Section 3.3.4 ) the value at time of failure will be employ ed.
For the longitudinal measurements of QMG score at various time points, the treatment effects 
will be explored by  using the mixed -effect model repeated measures (MMRM) with change 
from Baseline as dependent variable; treatment, Baseline standard of care treatment regimen, 
protocol -specified visits, treatment by -visit interaction as fixed effects; Baseline QMG value 
as covariates; and measu res within-subject at each visit as a repeated measure.
Primary  Efficacy  analy ses will be based on the ITT population. For sensitivity  anal ysis, the 
same anal ysis will be repeated using the PP population. 
Secondary  Efficacy  Analy ses
Treatment comparison w ill be performed b y Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted 
for Baseline standard of care treatment regimen. Subjects who discontinued from the study  
early will be considered as not showing clinical improvement. 
Exploratory  Efficacy  Analy ses
For the t ime to event variables, Kaplan- Meier estimates will be provided and the treatment 
comparison will be performed using log -rank test. For change from Baseline variables, 
ANCOVA and/or MMRM methods similar to the primary  efficacy  endpoint will be used. For 
percentage variables, the CMH test adjusted for Baseline sta ndard of care treatment regimen
will be used. 
MGFA p ostintervention alchange in status at Week 24 relative to Baseline will be 
summarized by  treatment group.
Safety  Anal yses
The safet y analysis wil l be based on safet y population.
The incidence of AEs, SAEs, suspected ADRs, and AEs by  severit y will be summarized by 
treatment, s ystem organ class and preferred term using descriptive statistics. Subjects with 
deaths, SAEs, and AEs leading to premature d iscontinuation from the study will be listed.  
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015

1.1 Myasthenia Gravis 
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction and is 
clinically  manifested as variable and fluctuating muscle weakness ( 1). In most cases, the 
disorder is associated with the production of antibodies against acety lcholine receptors 
(AChR) leading to the destruction of the postsy naptic motor end plate ( 2). Clinical sy mptoms 
of MG include muscle fatigue and weakness that can be localized, such as ocular, or 
generalized across multiple muscle groups (s ystemic). Manifest weakening during continued 
activity , quick restoration of power with rest, and dramatic improvement in strength 
following the administration of drugs inhibiting a cetylcholinesterase such as neostigmine and 
pyridostigmine are other notable characteristics ( 3). The special vulnerability  of the 
neuromuscular junctions in certain muscles gives my asthenia a highly  characteristic clinical 
presentation. Usuall y the eyelids and the muscles of eye movement, and somewhat less often 
the face, jaws, thr oat, and neck are the first to be affected. Exacerbations of disease can lead 
to my asthenic crisis (MC) with severe respiratory  weakness requiring intubation.
MG is a relativel y rare disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1.7 to 10.4 per million 
dependin g on the location, and has been reported to be as high as 21 per million in 
Barcelona, Spain ( 4). While sy mptoms can be ameliorated with acet ylcholinesterase 
inhibitors that prolong native acet ylcholine activity , definitive therapy  requires attenuation of 
the aberrant immune process. This can be achieved by treating patients with 
immunosuppressive medications, immunomodulation therapies or plasma exchange ( 5). 
Immunosu ppressive medications used in the treatment of MG include corticosteroids, 
azathioprine, cy clophosphamide, cyclosporine, and my cophenolate mofetil. B -cell targeted 
immunotherapies (e.g., rituximab, belimumab), and eculizumab have also been explored as 
investigational treatment modalities. I ntravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is commonly  used 
in the acute setting as an integral part of therap y (4, 6).
While there are a number of studies evaluating IVIg for the treatment of MG worsening or 
exacerbation ( 7, 8, 9, 10, 11), there are few prospective data from controlled trials in the 
public domain for IVIg treatment of chronic MG ( 12, 13). The latter 2 studies were in very  
small patient numbers 12 and 15 patients , respectively . The study  by Wolfe and colleagues 
was terminated prematurely  due to insufficient IVIg inventories, and that by  Ronager and 
colleagues was a controlled crossover study  wherein I VIg was given for 5 day s with 16 
weeks observation followed b y plasma exchange every  other day  (5 interventions) with 16 
weeks observation (or vi ceversa). Thus , there is a need for definitive, prospective clinical 
studies of IVIg in the chronic/maintenance setting.
Corticosteroids have generall y been considered a fair ly reliable and appropriate modality  for 
immunomodulation of MG, mainly  based on clinical experience rather than rigorousl y 
controlled studies ( 6). Prednisone (or prednisolone in Europe) is the initial 
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 24of 98immunosuppressive treatment used in many  MG patients, although the optimal dosage and 
schedule of administration have not been precisely defined ( 14). The long -term use of 
steroids is complicated by  severe and often intolerable adverse effects, the cumulative burden 
of steroid side effects is high (15), and therefore there has been much clinical interest in 
approaches to CS dose reduction. The minimum effective CS dose is the clinical target ( 16). 
1.2 Treatment of M yasthenia Gravis
Therapies for MG are based on two approaches, prolongation of the half -life of the 
neurotransmitter acet ylcholine in the sy naptic cleft, and reduction in the burden of pathol ogic 
antibodies inhibiting neuromuscular transmission. 
Acet ylcholinesterase inhibitors effectively  prolong acet ylcholine activity ; neostigmine and 
pyridostigmine have been demonstrated to provide sy mptomatic improvement in muscle 
strength. Common adverse events (AEs) include diarrhea and abdominal cramps, whilst
overdose s ymptoms show features consistent with acute cholinergic poisoning ( 4).
Down regulation of the production of antibodies through immune modulati onis a 
complementary  approach, and corticosteroids, azathioprine, cy closporine, tacrolimus, and 
cyclophosphamide have been employ ed. Clinical observation and limited trial data support a 
number of medications using this approach, however all require close monitoring for 
frequent and sometimes serious adverse effects ( 17, 18, 19, 20, 21). Additional ly, onset of 
of action is often reported to be slow with these agents, with the exception of corticosteroids 
(22). Although corticosteroids are the most common first- line immune suppressant emplo yed 
in chronic MG, their adverse effect profile is considerable. Examples of adverse effects of 
systemic CS use include clinical adverse effects (e.g., adipose tissue redistribution, 
hypertension, cardiovascular risk, osteoporosis, peptic ulcer, adrenal insufficiency , 
infect ions, a septic necrosis and pancreatitis as well as mood, ophthalmological, menstrual 
and skin disorders) and biological adverse effects (e.g., e lectrol yte homeostasis 
diabetogenesis, dy slipidemia and pregnancy -related AEs) (23, 24).
Additional therapies include complete th ymectomy , an intervention that is the subject of an 
ongoing clinical trial supported by  the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and 
Stroke (NINDS) (25) which presents an opportunity  to reduce antibod y production. Removal 
of an associated thy moma has shown benefit historically .In the setting of MCand 
exacerbations, plasmapheresis has been emplo yed. However, a 2011 American Academ y of 
Neurology  (AAN) guideline update states that: “There is insufficient evidence to support or 
refute the use of plasmapheresis in my asthenia gravis ” (26).Plasmapheresis requires highl y 
specialized equipment, significant operator expertise, and often requires large gauge access 
to the central circulation.
IVIg derived from healthy donor plasma appears to mitigate immunologic events related to 
the pathologic antibodies in MG. While there are multiple theoretical mechanisms by  which 
exogenous IVIg modulates the immune sy stem, several generall y accepted paths include 
competition with anti- idioty pe antibodies, anti -complement effects, and Fc receptor 
saturation (27, 28, 29).
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 25of 98The mechanism b y which IVIg exerts its clinical effect in MG remains to be elucidated b ut it 
is believed to improve symptoms by  modulating the pathogenic autoantibody  response. Other 
mechanisms of action postulated in other diseases include the Fc receptor blockade of the 
reticuloendothelial s ystem, modulation of the idioty pic-anti-idioty picnetwork, enhancement 
of regulatory  T cells, inhibition of complement deposition, modulation of cy tokines, growth 
factors and adhesion molecules, modulation of apoptosis and macrophages, and immune 
regulation of both B -cell and T -cell immune function ( 30, 31). Improvement in MG 
symptoms ty pically  occurs in about 70% of patients, beginning during treatment or within a 
few day s of initiating IVIg treatment and lasting for weeks to month s (32).
The Therapeutics and Technology  Assessment Subcommittee of AAN recently  released 
updated evidence -based guideline sthat consider IVIg as an effective therapy  for moderate -
to-severe cases of MG, but also acknowledges the need for additional clinical trials ( 33). 
1.3 Immune Globulin (Human), 10%  Caprylate/Chromatography  
Purified (IGIV -C) 
Immune Globulin (Human), 10% Capry late/Chromatography  Purified (IGIV -C) is an 
intravenous (IV) product that is currentl y available commerciall y in a number of countries 
for the treatment of primary  immunodeficiency , idiopathic thrombocy topenic purpura (ITP), 
and chronic inflammatory  dem yelinating pol yneuropathy (CIDP) as well as oth er indications 
in some countries. 
In addition to the information provided herein , please refer to the IGIV -C IB and any  
additional data supplied by  the Sponsor.
1.4 Stud y Rationale and Dose Selection
1.4.1 Study Rationale
The general recommendation is that I VIg con centrates are a safe and effective treatment 
option as a short term treatment for acute exacerbation of MG. Moreover, IVIg has 
demonstrated a positive treatment effect in clinical studies of MG worsening or exacerbations 
(7, 9, 11), but further clinical data are needed to confirm the effectiveness of IVIg in the 
treatment of MG as a maintenance therap y (12, 13).In a recent Cochrane review ( 10) of IVIg 
for MG ,controlled trials were generally  of limited timeframe underscoring the need for 
longer term evaluation .
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled study  to evaluate the 
efficacy  and safet y of Immune Globulin (Human), 10% Capry late/Chromatography  Purified 
(IGIV -C) in symptomatic subjects with generalized MGon standard of care treatment . The 
primary  measure of efficacy  for this study  is the change in score of MG s ymptoms as 
measured b y the Quantitative My asthenia Gravis ( QMG ) score from Baseline (Week 0) to 
Week 24.
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 26of 981.4.2 Dose Rationale
The optimal dose of IVIg for MG exacerbation is still unclear, but prior reviews reported a 
usual dose of 2 g/kg, which is administered over 3 to 5 day s (32, 35). More recent studies in 
MG have evaluated the administration of a total IVIg dose of 2 g/kg over 2 consecutive day s 
(1g/kg daily ) with no increase in side effects and a comparable benefit lasting up to 30 to 60 
days post -treatment ( 7, 9, 11). 
Likewise, in a study  of sub jects with Guillain -Barré s yndrome (GBS), a total IVIg dose of 
2g/kg administered over 2 consecutive day s (1g/kg dail y) was compared to the standard 
regimen of 0.4 g/kg dail y for 5 days and there were no significant differences in the primary 
or secondar y outcome measures ( 36).
Based on the above, subjects will receive a loading IGIV -C dose of 2 g/kg of body weight 
administered over two day s followed b y maintenance infusions at 3 -week intervals at a dose 
of 1 g /kg of bod y weight administered over one day . The loading and maintenance dosage is 
the same as that used for IGIV -C in CIDP which has been well tolerated, and is approved for 
CIDP at this dosage both in North America and Europe.

3INVESTIGA TIONAL PLA N
3.1 Stud y Design and Plan
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study  to evaluate the 
efficacy  and safet y of IGIV -C in subjects with MG who are symptomatic on standard of care 
treatment. Approximately 6 2adult subjects will be randomized at approximately  40 global 
study  centers.
Subjects who are on standard of care treatment for MG may enroll. Eligibility  parameters 
allow monotherap y, dual tre atment, or three-drug treatment (i.e., various combination s
consisting of a cholinesterase inhibitor, CS, and an additional immunosuppressant ). Subjects 
will be randomly  allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either IGIV -C or matched placebo every  
three weeks in double -blinded fashion. Randomization will be stratified by sentinel features 
of the subject’s Baseline standard of care MG treatment regimen at the time randomization : 
Regimen includes ONLY cholinesterase inhibitors
Regimen includes CS as the ONLY IMMUNOSUPPRESSANT /
IMMUNOMODULATOR, alone or in combination with other MG medications
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 28of 98(e.g., a subject on prednisone plus a cholinesterase inhibitor would be in this 
stratum )
Regimen includes ANY NO N-CS 
IMMUNOSUPPRESSANT/IMMUNOMODULATOR alone or in combination 
with other MG medications which may  include CS (e.g., a subject on 
azathioprine, prednisone, and a cholinesterase inhibitor would be in this stratum )
For those subjects randomized to receive I GIV-C, an initial loading dose of 2 g/kg of bod y 
weight will be administered after the baseline assessments are complete at Baseline (Week 0, 
Visit 1) followed by  maintenance doses of 1 g/kg of body  weight administered every  third 
week through Week 21 (Visit 8). The initial loading dose (2 g/kg) will be divided on 2 
consecutive day s with extension of up to 4 consecutive day s to account for
tolerability /weight >80 kg. The subsequent 7 maintenance dosages (1 g/kg) will be infused in 
one day  with an extension to 2 consecutive day s (divided doses) to account for
tolerability /weight >80 kg. For both loading and maintenance infusions the limit for blinded 
IGIV -C infusion is no more than 80 g/day , corresponding to an 80 -kg body  weight for a 1 
g/kg per diem dosage .
For those subjects randomized to receive placebo, a sterile 0.9% sodium chloride injection, 
United States Pharmacopeia ( USP)or equivalent will be infused at the Baseline/Week 0 Visit 
(Visit1) using the same volume as would be required for the IGIV -C loadi ng dose.
Subsequent placebo maintenance doses will be matched in volume to the IGIV -C 
maintenance doses and administered every  third week until Week 21 (Visit 8 ).
The Investigator s will hold the subjects’ current background medical regimen constant from 
Screening through the end of the study  (Week 24, Visit 9) ,unless there is a compelling 
emergent medical need to make medication adjustments , the subject discontinues the study  
because criteria for Treatment Failure are met as defined in Section 3.3.3 (after End of Study  
visit assessments are complete), or adverse effects due to other components of the subject’s 
therap y become untenable ; in such cases the Medical Monitor must be contacted .
Week 21 (Visit 8) is the time of the last investigational product (IP) maintenance dosage. 
Week 24 (Visit 9) will constitute the primary  endpoint time point for analy sis because this 
timing allows an opportunity  to assess the effect of the final IP infusion made at Week 21 
(Visit 8). Week 24 (Visit 9) will serve as the final End of Study  Visit .
A schematic of the overall study  design and essential activities is shown in Figure 3-1.The
Schedule of Study  Procedures is provided in Appendix 1 . Tools for assessing MG are 
provided in Appendix 2 to Appendix 6 , and specific safet y monitoring in Appendix 7 and
Appendix 8 .
Worsening of MG s ymptoms
The intent is that subjects will receive their original randomized treatment assignment of IP 
through the entire Treatment Period (i.e., through Week 21 [Visit 8]). Subjects will remain on 
IP until at least Week 9 (Visit 4). No premature discontinuations on the basis of the a priori
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 29of 98defined Treatment Failure ( Section 3.3.3 ) are allowed until the subject receives a minimum 
of 3 complete doses of IP, which includes the initial loading dose a nd the first two 
maintenance doses irrespective of the QMG scores measured at Week 3 and Week 6 (Visit 2 
and Visit 3), and the subject is assessed at W eek 9 ( Visit 4) with regard to continuation of 
worsening .
For example, a subject with a QMG increase of 4 points or more at Week 3 ( Visit 2 ) or 
Week 6 (Visit 3 )must have confirmation of this QMG increase at the next, subsequent
scheduled visit (i.e., Week 6 [ Visit 3 ] andWeek 9 [ Visit 4 ],respectively ). However, s ubjects 
will not be removed from study until at or after Week 9 for reasons of QMG score continuing 
to meet the criteria for Treatment Failure (Section 3.3.3 ) in order to allow time for the 
investigational medicinal product to potentially produce a beneficial effect .
At W eek 9 (Visit 4) through Week 21 (Visit 8), if the subject suffers a worsening of his/her 
MG sy mptoms with an increase in QMG of 4 points or more, as defined in Section 3.3.3
“Definition of Treatment Failure Due to MG Worsening ”, and this worsening (increase 
in QMG of 4 points or more) is confirmed at the next scheduled consecutive visit, the subject 
will be discontinued from the study .

3.3 Stud y Time Periods and Definitions
3.3.1 Investigational Product Treatment Period
Subjects will receive a total of 8 doses of IP, which includes oneinitial loading dose at the 
Baseline (Week 0) V isit (after Baseline assessments are complete) and 7 maintenance doses 
at Weeks 3 through 21 (Visits 2 through 8), inclusive.
3.3.2 Worsening of MG Symptoms
All subjects will remain in the study until at least Week 9 (Visit 4) is completed. No 
premature discontinuation of I P administration is to be made for reasons of Treatment Failure 
(defined in Section 3.3.3) until the subject receives at least a total of 3 complete doses of the 
IP, which includes the initial loading dose and the first two maintenance doses irrespective of 
the QMG scores measured at Week 3 and Week 6 (Visit 2 and Visit 3). 
At Week 9 (Visit 4) through Week 21 (Visit 8), if the subject suffers a worsening of his/he r 
MG sy mptoms defined as a QMG increase ≥ 4 points relative to Baseline (Week 0), and this 
worsening (increase in QMG of 4 points or more) is confirmed at the next scheduled 
consecutive visit the subject will discontinue from the study .The earliest withdr awal for 
Treatment Failure will be at Week 9 and would occur only  if QMG score is increased by  4 
points or more (relative to Baseline) at both Week 6 (Visit 3) and Week 9 (Visit 4).
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 34of 983.3.3 Definition ofTreatment Failure Due to MG Worsening
During the study , MG w orsening will be defined as:
QMG increas e by ≥4 points relative to Baseline/Week 0
If a subject experiences worsening in QMG score fulfilling the criterion above at or after 
Week 9, and this worsening (increase in QMG of 4 points or more) is confirmed at the next 
scheduled consecutive visit , the subject will be considered a Treatment Failure and will be 
discontinued from the study (atcompletion of the visit where confirmation of worsening is 
demonstrated) . 
If a subject experiences worsening in QMG score fulfilling the criterion above at Week 3
(Visit 2) or Week 6 (Visit 3) and the QMG increase by  ≥ 4 points relative to Baseline is 
confirmed at the next scheduled visit (i.e., confirmation at Week 6 [Visit 3]or Week 9 
[Visit 4], respectively ), and this≥ 4-point QMG worsening is maintained through Week 9 
(Visit 4) the subject will be considered a Treatment Failure. 
Asubject will not be discontinued from the study  for reasons of Trea tment Failure until the 
Week 9 V isit or later as described in Section 3.3.2 .
3.3.4 Myasthenic Crisis
Myasthenic (or MG) crisis will be defined as an episode of worsening (as defined in 
Section 3.3.2 ) which requires hospitalization. Hospitalizations solely  for socioeconomic 
reasons would not fulfill criteria for MG crisis. Also see Earl y Term ination Visit and Section 
3.11.
3.4 Treatments
3.4.1 Treatments to Be Administered
3.4.1.1 Immune Globulin (Human), 10% Caprylate/Chromatography Purified (IGIV- C)
Immune Globulin I njection (Human), 10%, Caprylate/Chromatography  Purified ( IGIV -C)is 
the active IP for this study , which is a marketed product. IGIV -C glass vials may  be supplied 
in the vial sizes of 10 mL, 25 mL , 50 mL, 100 mL, and 200 mL . Detailed information 
regarding IGIV -C can be found in the IGIV -C Investigator Brochure.
Administ ration of I P will be via the IV route, and will be administered in a double -blinded 
fashion. The unblinded pharmacist or designee will prepare the IP to maintain the blind for 
all parties during infusions and study  assessments. Reference the Pharmacy  Manua l for 
additional details.
3.4.1.2 Placebo
Sterile 0.9% sodium chloride injection, USP (0.9% NaCl, USP) or equivalent will be used as 
placebo to maintain the blind. 
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 35of 983.4.1.3 Labeling of Investigational Products
Labeling will be according to the requirements of local law an d legislation. L abel text will be 
approved according to Grifols Therapeutics Inc. procedures, and a cop y of the labels will be 
made available to the study  site upon request.
3.4.1.4 Storage of Investigational Products
IP must be stored in a secure area accessible to the unblinded pharmacist or designee 
responsible for the preparation and dispensing of IP.
Active I P (IGIV -C) must be stored at temperatures of 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). Do not 
freeze. The unblinded pharmacist or designee is responsible for maintaining storage 
temperature records and for immediatel y reporting deviations in temperature to the unblinded 
study  monitor. Reference the Pharmacy  Manual for additional details.
3.4.1.5 Preparation of Investigational Products
The volume (i.e., total infusion dose adminis tered) of IP to be prepared for each IV infusion 
will be individualized for each subject based on body  weight, and the protocol specified 
loading dose of 2 g/kg divided o n 2 consecutive day s starting after the randomization at 
Baseline (Week 0), followed b y maintenance doses of 1 g/kg administered over 1 day  every  
three weeks until Week 21(Visit 8). I nfusion solution will be visually masked to maintain 
the blind.
Note that the loading dosage is divided over 2 days as standard infusion time; however, 
extensions up to 4 day s are allowed for tolerability  issues or higher weight, i.e., limit for 
IGIV -C infusion is no more than 80 g/day  (corresponding to 80 kg body  weight). Similarl y, 
the maintenance dosage is infused in 1 day  as standard; however, extension is allowed for 
divided dosage over 2 day s for tolerability  issues or higher weight, i.e., limit for IGIV -C 
infusion is no more than 80 g/day  (corresponding to 80 kg body  weight).
Subjects randomized to receive placebo will receive 0.9% sodium chloride injection, USP or 
equivalent, visually  masked and at a volume approximate to that required for the appropriate 
weight -based dose of IGIV -C in order to maintain blinding of the subject, caregivers, 
Investigator , and assessors. The IP will be prepared by  the unblin ded stud y site pharmacist or 
designee.
The unblinded pharmacist must inspect I GIV-C visually  before preparing for administration 
to subjects. The solution must not be used if turbid or if it contains visible particles. Solution 
which has been frozen should not be used.
Reference the Pharmacy  Manual for detailed IP preparation and administration instructions.

CONFIDENTIAL    Page 36of 983.4.1.6 Accountability for Investigational Products
IP isto be used onl y for the study in accordance with the directions given in this protocol. 
The study  pharmacist or designee is responsible for the distribution of the IP in accordance 
with directions given in the protocol and Pharmacy  Manual.
The unblinded study  pharmacist or designee is responsible for maintaining accurate records 
of the I P for his/her site . IP inventory /dispensing documentation verify ing the receipt, 
dispensing, destruction or return must be maintained and kept current b y the pharmacist. The 
inventory  must be made available for inspection during the study  by the unblinded monitor. 
IP suppli es must be accounted for b y the monitor and inventory /dispensing logs must be 
verified b y the monitor prior to IP destruction. Written documentation from Grifols or 
designee of an y used and unused inventory is required. At the end of the study, a cop y of t he 
inventory /dispensing log(s) will be retrieved by  the monitor and returned to Grifols 
Therapeutics Inc.
3.4.2 Rationale for Selection of Doses/Timing of Investigational Product in the 
Study
3.4.2.1 Selection of IGIV -C Dose and Dosing Interval in the Study
The optimal dose of IVIg for MG maintenance dosing is still unclear; however, recent studies 
have supported a loading dose of 2 g/kg administered in as little as two consecutive dail y 
doses of 1 g/kg each with no increase in side effects as compared to the longer dosi ng period 
of 3 to 5 day s (7, 9, 11, 32, 35). Maintenance dosage of IGIV -C in CIDP has been well 
tolerated at 1 g/kg administered over 1 to 2 day s every  three weeks and has regulatory  
approval for this indication/dosage in both North America and Europe.
Based on the above, subjects will receive a loading IGIV -C dose of 2 g/kg of body weight 
followed b y maintenance dosages at 3 -week intervals at a dose of 1 g/kg of body  weight. 
3.4.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study . Subjects will be randomized in 
a 1:1 ratio via Interactive Web Response Sy stem (IWRS) into I GIV-C treatment group and 
Placebo treatment group to receive either IGIV- C or matching placebo every  three weeks in a 
double -blind fashion via IV administration. Eac h subject’s IGIV -C dose will be 
individualized based on the subject’s bod y weight and the protocol specified loading dose of 
2 g/kg over 2 consecutive days and maintenance dosage of 1 g/kg over 1 day  every  three 
weeks through Week 21 (Visit 8). Therefore, each subject’s infusion volume and duration of 
the infusion will vary  from subject to subject, and must be carefully  prepared by  the 
unblinded pharmacist who will prepare IP consisting of either IGIV -C or an equivalent 
volume of 0.9% sodium chloride inject ion. Note that for the loading dosage ,2 day s is 
standard (2- 4 day s is allowed as an extension for tolerability  issues or higher weight, i.e., 
limit for I GIV-C infusion is no more than 80 g/day [corresponding to 80 kg body  weight]). 
Similarly , the maintenance dosage is given over 1 day  as the standard time interval (divided 
dosage over 2 day s is allowed for tolerability issues or higher weight, i.e., limit for I GIV-C 
infusion is no more than 80 g/day  [corresponding to 80 kg body  weight]).
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 37of 983.4.3.1 Subject Numbering
Within each study  site, subjects in the study  will receive a consecutive subject number. 
Subject numbers are generated beginning with the study  center number (3 digits, assigned by  
the Sponsor) followed consecutively  with a unique number for each subject (4 digits, 
including leading zeros). For example, if the Investigator’s center number is 301, subject 
number will be 3010001, 3010002, 3010003, etc., in consecutive order. Subject numbers, 
once assigned, will not be reused at an y center.
3.4.3.2 Blinding
This is a double -blind, placebo -controlled stud y. Placebo infusion will be visually 
indistinguishable from IGIV -C to maintain blinding. The unblinded pharmacist or designee 
will prepare all I P infusion bags with no visual differences between IGIV -C and p lacebo and 
cover with a non -transparent blinding bag cover. 
Additionally ,results of the central laboratory  analy sis of immunoglobulin G ( IgG)levels will 
not be shared with the Investigator , blinded study  staff, clinical research organization (CRO) 
or blinded Spons or personnel involved with study  conduct.
3.4.3.3 Administration and Timing of Investigational Products for Each Subject
IGIV -C (or p lacebo) will be administered as a loading dose of 2 g/kg divided over 2 
consecutive day s starting after randomization at Week 0 (V isit 1), followed by  maintenance 
doses of 1 g/kg over 1 day every  three weeks through Week 21 (Visit 8). Note that for the 
loading dosage, 2 day s are standard (2- 4 day s are allowed as an extension for tolerability  
issues or higher weight, i.e., limit for I GIV-C infusion is no more than 80 g/day  
[corresponding to 80 kg body  weight]). Similarly , the maintenance dosage is administered
over 1 day  as the standard time interval (divided dosage over 2 day s is allowed for 
tolerability  issues or higher weight, i.e., limit for IGIV -C infusion is no more than 80 g/day  
[corresponding to 80 kg body  weight]). Infusion administration, including infusion rate, is 
provided in the Pharmacy Manual.
In the event that the subject is not able to tolerate the set infusion rate, th e rate may  be 
decreased for better tolerability . The initial and final infusion rates will be recorded.
3.4.3.4 Preparation and Handling of Investigational Products
Blinded IP (IGIV -C or p lacebo) should be infused using a separate line by  itself, without 
mixing wi th other IV fluids or medications that the subject might be receiving. The IP 
infusion line can be flushed with 5% dextrose in water (D5/W) or 0.9% sodium chloride 
injection. Do not flush with heparin .

CONFIDENTIAL    Page 38of 983.4.3.5 Treatment Compliance
Reasons for an y deviation from th e administration of less than 100% of the IP dose as 
prepared b y the pharmacist or designee must be recorded in the electronic case report form 
(eCRF) and in the subject’s medical records.
All IV infusions will be administered at the study  site under the s upervision of the treating 
Investigator or designee.
3.5 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Concomitant medications must be recorded in the eCRF, including the trade or generic 
names of the medication, the dose, the route of administration, and the duration of the 
medication (frequency ).
Diphenhy dramine, acetaminophen/ibuprofen, and non -steroidal anti -inflammatory  drugs are 
allowed during the trial as pre -medications for study  drug infusions. These and any  other 
concomitant medication taken during the stud y period m ust be documented in the subject’s 
medical records and the eCRF.
3.5.1 Prohibited Medications Prior to Study Participation

in the I nvestigator’s opinion. 
In case of a compelling, emergent medical need to make MG medication adjustments during 
study , the Medical Monitor must be contacted .
Use of medications known to potentially  worsen MG is discouraged (unless medically  
required) including telithromy cin, fluoroquinolones (e.g., Ciprofloxacin and L evofloxacin), 
azithromy cin, aminogly coside antibiotics, b otulinum toxin, quinine, quinidine, procainamide, 
D-penicillamine, and β- blockers. For patients entering stud y alread y on β-blockers ,continued 
use of β -blockers is allowed if medicall y needed; de novo use (initiation of β- blocker 
treatment for the first time) while on stud y is discouraged.

Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 40of 983.6.3 Exploratory Variables
The exploratory  objectives for this study  are to evaluate the effect of IGIV- C on: 
Percentage of subjects who experience a clinical improvement in QMG score (defined 
above) at Weeks 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21

3.6.4 Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis Score (QMG)
The MGFA, Inc. Task Force on Clinical Research Standards recognizes the utility  of the 
QMG score in prospective clinical trials in MG ( 34) complemented b y additional tools such 
as the MG C omposite. The QMG is eas y to administer by  clinical evaluators and/or 
physicians in approximately  30 minutes with minimal equipment to measure spirometry  and 
muscle strength testing. An average 3-point improvement in QMG score indicates clinical ly 
meaningful improvement in terms of minimal clinically  important difference and precedent 
set by  endpoints in other MG stu dies(37, 38). Subjects receiving cholinesterase inhibitors 
will be instructed not to take medication 12 hours prior to QMG.
QMG Test Items are listed in Appendix 3 .
3.6.5 MG Composite Scale
The MG Composite scale takes less than five minutes to complete, and is made up of three 
ocular, three bulbar, one respiratory , one neck, and two limb items ( 39, 40).
The task force on MG study design of the medical scientific advisory  board of the MGFA 
recommends using the MG Composite as the quantitative measure for determining 
improvement and worsening for subjects with generalized MG disease. A 3 -point 
improvement in MG Composite score reliably indicates clinical improvement. A 3 -point 
improvement in the MG Composite score also appears to be meaningful to the patient ( 41).
The MG Composite items are listed in Appendix 4 .
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 41of 983.6.6 MG-ADL
The MG -ADL is an 8- item, patient reported (or Investigator administered) questionnaire that 
is completed to assess the sy mptoms and activities in MG ( 42-44). A 2 -point improvement in 
the MG -ADL indicates clinical improvement ( 42).
The questionnaire and scoring is provided in Appendix 5 . 
3.6.7 15-item MG Quality -of-Life Instrument (MG -QOL 15)
MG sy mptoms significantly  impact quality  of life (QOL) particularl y in aspects of ph ysical 
functioning. The 15 items on the MG- QOL 15 are derived from mobility , symptoms, general 
contentment, and emotional well -being categories assessed b y the patient over the past few 
weeks. All individual items related to degree of disease -related impairment are rated on a 
Likert scale ranging from “not at all” (score 0 points) to “very  much” (scor e 4 points) with 
higher scores indicating greater negative impact (worse disease) ( 45-47 ).
The MG -QOL 15 and scoring are provided in Appendix 6 .
3.6.8 MGFA Postinterventional Change in Status
An MGFA postintervention alchange in status relative to Baseline will be evaluated at Week 
24 (Visit 9) wherein the Investigator will classify  the patient as: (I) Improved, defined as a 
substantial decrease in pretreatment clinical manifestations of MG, QMG decrease ≥ 3 
points; (U) Unchanged, defined as no substantial change in pretreatment clinical 
manifestations of MG; (W) Worse, defined as a substantial increase in pretreatment clinical 
manifestations of MG, QMG increase ≥ 3 points.

randomized at Week 0 (Visit 1). At this time ,an initial loading dose of blinded IP will be 
administered at a dose of 2 g/kg divided on 2consecutive days starting after randomization. 
Maintenance infusions of blinded IPwill be given at doses of 1g/kg over 1 day  every  three 
weeks through Week 21(Visit 8). Note that the loading dosage is divided over 2 day s as 
standard infusion time; however, extensions to 4 day s are allowed for tolerability  issues or 
higher weight, i.e., limit for IGIV -C infusion is no more than 80 g/day  (corresponding to 
80kg bod y weight). Similarly  the maintenance dosage is infused in 1 day  as standard; 
however ,extensions for divided dosage over 2 days are allowed for tolerability  issues or 
higher weight, i.e., limit for IGIV -C infusion is no more than 80 g/day  (corresponding to

for quantitative/semi- quantitative binding, blocking, and modulating AChR antibodies which 
are not required.
If a subject discontinues at an y point during the study  after receiving IP, the subject will be 
requested to return to the clinic to have the procedures and assessments outlined in Appendix 
1conducted as soon as practical following the decision to with draw (at least within 14 day s 
after the termination date) if the subject is willing. Subjects must withhold their 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (e.g., pyridostigmine) dosage for 12 hours prior to the Early 
Termination Visit to assure accurate assessment o f the QMG .

the central laboratory  analy sis of IgG levels will not be shared with th e Investigator , blinded 
study  staff, CRO or blinded Sponsor personnel involved with study  conduct. All 
measurements will be conducted using qualifie d assay s. Specific details regarding all aspects 
of sample collection and processing can be found in the Stu dy Reference Manual at each site.
3.9 Screen Failures
Screening evaluations will be used to determine the eligibility of each subject for enrollment 
at the Baseline Visit. Subjects who fail to meet eligibility  criteria during Screening
evaluations will be considered screen failures. Subjects may  re-screen for the study  if the 
reason for screen failure is no longer relevant; a new informed consent form must be signed 
for re -screening .
3.10 Removal of Subjects
Removal from Study: Subjects who discontinue the study  prematurel y will receive an Early 
Termination Visit with same assessments as Week 24 (Visit 9) in Appendix 1 with the 
exception of quantitative/semi -quantitative binding, blocking, and modulating acet ylcholine 
receptor antibodies which are not required . 
Subjects may  withdraw or be withdrawn from the study  for the following reasons:
1.At their own request or at the request of their legally  acceptable representative.
2.If, in the Investigator's opinion, continuation in the s tudy would be detrimental to the 
subject's well -being.
3. At the specific request of the Sponsor. 
Also, subjects must be withdrawn for the following reasons: 
Subjects not meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria prior to the Baseline (Week 0) 
Visit bas ed on laboratory results
Subjects with an occurrence of a concomitant disease or an y medical condition which, 
either because of its severity  or duration or necessary  change in treatment, contravenes 
the condition of the study or puts the patient at unneces sary risk or harm 
Subjects with an occurrence of an AE which in the opinion of the Investigator and/or 
subject requires termination of treatment
QMG increase b y ≥ 4 points relative to Baseline (Week 0) occurring at or after Week 9 
(Visit 4) with worsening (increase in QMG of 4 points or more) confirmed at the next 
scheduled consecutive visit indicating worsening MG ( Section 3.3.3 )
MG crisis (defined in Section 3.3.4 )
Subjects who are noncompliant with the protocol per the Investigator ’s discretion
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 53of 98Pregnancy
In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the eCRF and in the subject's 
records. 
3.11 Follow -up of Subjects Withdrawn from Study
Subjects who receive any amount of I P and discontinue earl y from the study will be 
requested to return for the Earl y Termination Visit procedures (see Section 3.8.2.9 ) as soon 
as practical following decision to withdraw (at least w ithin 14 day s after the termination date) 
if the subject is willing.
3.12 Premature Termination of Study /Closure of Center
The Sponsor, Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee (I RB/EC), and/or regulatory  
authorities have the right to close this study  or a study  center, and the Investigator/Sponsor 
has the right to close a center, at an y time, although this should occur only  after consultation 
between involved parties. The I RB/EC must be informed. Should the study/center be closed 
prematurel y, all study  mater ials (except documentation that has to remain stored at site) must 
be returned to the Sponsor. The Investigator will retain all other documents until notification 
given b y the Sponsor for destruction.
A study  center can be closed for the following reasons:
Lack of enrollment 
Non-compliance with the requirements of the study protocol
Non-compliance with International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical 
Practice (I CH GCP)
4ADVERSE EVENTS 
4.1 Warnings/Precautions
For complete IGIV -C safety  information, ref er to the current IGIV -C IB. It is possible that 
unknown, unforeseen adverse reactions may  occur in subjects with MG exacerbations.
4.1.1 Interaction/Overdose
In an overdose situation, cardiovascular overload would be the primary  concern and should 
be managed ac cordingly . Since up to 2 g/kg have been tolerated b y man y subjects, and the 
maximum g/kg dose allowed at an y single infusion day in this study is 1 g/kg, no 
cardiovascular events are expected.
4.1.2 Live Viral Vaccines
Passive transfer of antibodies may  transien tly interfere with the immune response to live 
virus vaccines such as measles, mumps, rubella and varicella. Inform subjects that blinded 
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 54of 98IGIV -C/placebo can interfere with their immune response to live viral vaccines. Inform 
subjects to notify  their health care professional/immunizing phy sician of recent participation 
in a clinical study  including blinded study  drug (IGIV -C or placebo). The Investigator must 
consider an y potential interaction prior to receiving vaccinations so that appropriate measures 
may be taken.
4.2 Specification of Safety  Parameters
Aspects of clinical safet y will be evaluated in this clinical trial. 
Safety  endpoints will include:
AEs, SAEs and suspected ADRs
Vital signs 
Physical examination s
Blood chemistry  and hematology
Thromboembolic e vents
Hemoly sis
4.3 Methods and Timing for A ssessing, Recording and A nalyzing 
Safet y Parameters
Safety  will be assessed throughout the clinical trial for all individuals who have received at 
least one infusion of the IP.
4.3.1 Adverse Events
AEs (includes suspected ADRs) occurring at an y time between signature of the subject’s ICF 
and the last day  of the subject’s participation in the clinical trial will be reported and recorded 
on the appropriate subject’s eCRF entry . 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility  to ens ure that all AEs are appropriately recorded. 
AEs will be elicited b y spontaneous reporting b y the study  individual or by  a non -leading 
inquiry  or direct observation by  the study  staff.
4.3.2 Vital Signs 
During the infusions, abbreviated vital signs (HR, SBP, a nd DBP) will be recorded just 
before the start of each infusion (within 15 ± 5 minutes before the beginning of each 
infusion), 30 ± 10 minutes after starting infusion, and immediately  after infusion completes.
Clinically  relevant changes in vital signs dur ing infusions of I P will be reported as AEs 
temporally  associated to the infusion. Clinical relevance will be based on the Investigator’s 
criteria. 
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 55of 98In addition, vital signs will be assessed at scheduled visits. Abnormal vital signs judged as 
clinically  relevant b y the Investigator in the context of the patient’s medical history will be 
considered AEs.
4.3.3 Physical E xamination
Physical exams will be registered as normal or abnormal, according to the phy sician’s 
judgment or study staff’s criteria and findings wi ll be recorded. Abnormal phy sical findings 
judged as clinicall y relevant by the Investigator in the context of the patient’s medical history  
will be considered AEs.
4.3.4 Blood Chemistry and Hematological Parameters
All clinical laboratory  data for renal (creati nine, BUN), hepatic (ALT, AST, AL P and TBL) 
and hematological parameters ( complete blood count [ CBC ]including differential leukocy te 
count) will be listed for each clinical trial subject ( seeSection 3.8.3 ). Clinical laboratory  
results and the change from Baseline values at Week 24 will be summarized by  treatment 
group using summary  statistics. Shift tables will be provided to summarize values that fall 
outside the normal ranges.
The Investigator will be require d to classify  laboratory  results out of the normal range 
reported b y the laboratory as clinically relevant or not according to his/her criteria in the 
context of the patient’s medical history .
Laboratory  results out of the normal range judged by  the Invest igator as clinically  relevant in 
the context of the patient’s medical history /underly ing comorbid conditions will be 
considered AEs.
4.3.5 Thromboembolic Event Risk
Procedures for the monitoring of TE risk are provided in Appendix 7 .Pulmonary  embolism 
and deep venous thrombosis will be considered AEs and/or SAEs if criteria for seriousness 
are met.
4.3.6 Hemolysis
Procedures for hemol ysis detection are provided in Appendix 8 . In the event that true 
hemoly tic an emia develops, it will be considered an AE and/or a n SAE depending on 
whether seriousness criteria are met. Hemol ytic ARs are defined as temporally  associated 
with the study drug within 7 day s post infusion.
4.4 Procedures for Eliciting Reports of and for Reco rding and 
Reporting A dverse Events and Intercurrent Illnesses
4.4.1 Adverse Event
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a medicinal product or stud y treatment and which does not necessaril y 
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 56of 98have a causal relationship with this administration. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an y abnormal laboratory  finding, for example), sy mptom or 
disease temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whethe r or not considered 
related to the medicinal product.
Any AE that occurs at any  time between the signature of the ICF and last day  of the subject’s 
participation in the clinical trial must be reported and recorded on the AE eCRF entry .
4.4.2 Suspected Adverse Dr ug Reaction (ADR)/Adverse Reaction (AR)
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be 
considered suspected ADRs. The phrase “response to a medicinal product” means that a 
causal relationship between a medicinal p roduct and an AE is at least a reasonable 
possibility , that is, the relationship cannot be ruled out. I n the framework of this study , a 
suspected ADR with a causal relationship of “definite” will be labeled as an AR; thus, ARs 
are a subset of suspected ADRs.
The Sponsor is responsible for assessing the suspected ADR expectedness during the clinical 
trial.
4.4.3 Causality of Adverse Event
The Investigator is required to provide a causalit y assessment for each AE reported to the 
Sponsor. The Sponsor will consider the Investigator’s causality  assessment. Assessment of 
the causal relationship to the study  drug will be made according to the following 
classifications based on Karch FE, et al ( 48):
Definite : An event th at follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
treatment or in which the treatment level has been established in body  fluids or tissues; that 
follows a known response pattern to the suspected treatment; and that is confirmed by  
improv ement on stopping the treatment (dechallenge), and reappearance of the event on 
repeated exposure (rechallenge).
Probable : An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
treatment; that follows a known response pattern to t he suspected treatment; that is confirmed 
by dechallenge; and that could not be reasonabl y explained by  the known characteristics of 
the patient’s clinical state.
Possible : An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
treatment that follows a known response pattern to the suspected treatment but that could 
have been produced b y the patient’s clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to 
the patient.
Doubtful/Unlikely: An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the treatment; that does not follow a known response pattern to the 
suspected treatment; but that could not be reasonably  explained by  the known characteristics 
of the patient’s clinical state.
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 57of 98Unrelated : Any  event that does not meet the criteria above.
The operational tool to decide the AE causal relationship is based on algorithms by  Karch 
and Lasagna and Naranjo et al ( 49, 50).
When an AE is classified, assessing causal relationship by  the Investigator, as definitive, 
probable, possible or doubtful/unlikely , the event will be defined as a suspected ADR. A 
suspected ADR with a causal relationship of “defin ite” will be defi ned as an AR. When the 
causal relationship is labeled “Unrelated”, then it will be considered that the AE is not 
imputable to the study  treatment and it is not a suspected ADR.
In addition, when a causal relationship between the study  treatment and the AE cannot be 
ruled out by  the Investigator and/or Sponsor, it means that the AE cannot be labeled 
“unrelated”.
For an y subject, all AEs that occur at any time, between the beginning of the first infusion of 
IGIV -C and the final visit of the clinical trial, will be considered treatment emergent adverse 
events ( TEAEs ).
AEs occurring during the actual IP infusions (i.e., from the initiation of the IP infusion on the 
first day  to the completion of the total dosage of IP on the last day ) and within 72 hours 
following the completion of the infusion of the total dosage of IP on the last day, regardless 
of other factors that may  impact a possible causal association with product administration, 
will be defined as infusional AEs (i.e., an AE temporally  associated with an infusion of the 
IP) and labeled infusional TEAEs (a subset of TEAEs).
For AEs that occur during infusions, the infusion rate in effect at the time of onset of the AE, 
the time of onset of the AE and the time of AE change smateriall y in intensity and/or 
resolve swill be captured.
4.4.4 Intensity of Adverse Event or Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction
AEs and suspected ADRs will be classified depending on their intensit y (severity) according 
to the following definitions:
1.Mild: an AE which is well tolerated by  the subj ect, causing minimum degree of malaise 
and without affecting normal activities.
2.Moderate: an AE that interferes with the subject’s normal activities.
3.Severe: an AE that prevents the subject from performing their normal activities.
AE and suspected ADR int ensity  gradation must be distinguished from AE and suspected 
ADR seriousness gradation, which is defined according to event consequence. For example, 
headache can be mild, moderate or severe but usually  is not serious in all these cases.
The Investigator w ill be responsible for assessing the AE and suspected ADR intensity  
during the clinical trial, taking into account the criteria currentl y included in this section.
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 58of 984.4.5 Expectedness of Adverse Event or Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction
An AE or suspected ADR is c onsidered “unexpected” if the nature, seriousness, severit y or 
outcome of the reaction(s) is not consistent with the reference information. The expectedness 
of a suspected ADR shall be determined b y the Sponsor according to the reference document 
(IBor Summary  of Product Characteristics [ SPC]or product label ).
Events not listed for the particular drug under investigation in the IB or SPC are considered
“unexpected” and those listed are considered “expected.” When new Serious ADRs (Serious 
potentially -related AEs) are received, it is the Sponsor’s responsibility  to determine whether 
the event sare “unexpected” for expedited safet y reporting purposes.
4.4.6 Seriousness of Adverse Event or Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction, 
Serious Adverse Event
An AE or suspected A DR is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or 
Sponsor, it results in any  of the following outcomes: 
1.Death
2.Life-threatening AE (life -threatening in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk o f death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which hy potheticall y might have caused death if it were more severe)
3.In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
4.A persistent or significant incapacit y or substantia l disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions
5.A congenital anomal y/birth defect
6.An important medical event (important medical event in the definition of “serious”) 
refers to those events which may  not be immediately  life-threatening, or resu lt in death, 
or hospitalization, but from medical and scientific judgment may  jeopardize the subject 
or/and may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes 
listed above
This definition permits either the Sponsor or the I nvestigator to decide whether an event is 
“serious”. If either the Sponsor or the Investigators believes that the event is serious, the 
event must be considered “serious” and evaluated by  the Sponsor for expedited reporting. 
A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe AEs. The term “severe” is used to 
describe the intensit y (severity) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may be of 
relative minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
“serious”, which is defined on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually  associated 
with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. 
According to the medical criteria, an AE or a suspected ADR can be classified as serious, 
although it does not fulfill the conditions fixed in this section, if it is considered important 
from a medical point of view.
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 59of 984.4.6.1 Hospitalization or Prolongation of Hospitalization
An AE or suspected ADR is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or 
Sponsor , it results in hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization UNLESS this 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is part of the clinical practice (according to 
the Investigator’s criteria) for the treatment of the MG.
4.4.7 Adverse Events of Spe cial Interest
4.4.7.1 Thromboembolic Events
Subjects will be monitored for signs and s ymptoms of arterial and venous thromboses. In 
addition, the Grifols Medical Monitor will routinely  review reported AEs for possible 
thromboses. Arterial and venous thromboses wil l be identified according to definitions in the 
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clin ical Modification (I CD-9-CM). 
Such thrombotic events include, but are not limited to, DVT, PE, my ocardial infarction, 
cerebrovascular accident, ac ute coronary  syndrome, limb thrombosis, sagittal sinus 
thrombosis, and portal vein or mesenteric artery  thrombosis. All thrombosis will be recorded 
as AEs, reported accordingl y, and if serious, may require earl y discontinuation from study . 
See Appendix 7 for details. 
4.4.7.2 Hemolysis
Subjects will be monitored for signs and s ymptoms of hemoly sis. In addition, the Grifols 
Medical Monitor will routinely review reported AEs for possible hemoly sis. Hemoly sis will 
be recorded as an AE, reported accordingl y, and if resulting in serious hemoly tic anemia, 
may require earl y discontinuation from study . See Appendix 8 for details.
4.4.7.3 MG Events That Are Not Considered AEs
Given that variati ons in sy mptoms are an inherent part of the natural history of MG, all 
recorded information regarding severit y of MG manifestations will be considered efficacy 
data. 
For the purpose of this study , variation in MG symptoms will not be considered an AE unle ss 
MCrequires hospitalization. If a subject is hospitalized for MG, it will be reported as an 
SAE.
4.4.8 Procedures for Eliciting Reports of and for Recording and Reporting Adverse 
Events and Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions
The occurrence and follow -up deta ils of all AEs experienced by  any of the subjects during 
the clinical trial, from signature of the Clinical Trial W ritten Informed Consent Form to the 
last follow -up visit, will be recorded on the AE eCRF entry  and in the subject’s hospital 
record. If no A E has occurred during the stud y period, this should also be indicated in the 
eCRF.
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 60of 98At each visit, AEs will be elicited b y asking the individual a non -leading question such as 
“Do you feel different in any way since the last visit?” Moreover, AEs will also be collected 
through directl y observed events or spontaneously volunteered b y the subject. Clearl y related 
signs, s ymptoms and abnormal diagnostic procedures should preferabl y be grouped together 
and recorded as a single diagnosis or s yndrome wherever poss ible. It is responsibility  of the 
Investigator to ensure that AEs are appropriatel y recorded.
The following variables must be recorded on the AE eCRF entry :
1.the verbatim term (a diagnosis is preferred)
2.date/time of onset
3.date/time of resolution
4.severit y (mild, moderate, severe)
5.causality  (unrelated, doubtful/unlikely , possible, probable, definite)*
6.seriousness (y es, no)
7.action taken (with regard to I P)
8.other action (to treat the event)
9.outcome and sequel (follow -up on AE)
*AEs occurring before subject's ex posure to IP will be always labeled as "unrelated".
For AEs that occur during infusions, the infusion rate in effect at the time of onset of the AE, 
the time of onset of the AE and the time of AE change smateriall y in intensity and/or 
resolve swill be cap tured the eCRF entry .
In addition to the I nvestigator’s own description of the AEs, each AE will be encoded by  the 
Sponsor or CRO according to the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA®).
For example, a laboratory test abnormality  considered clinically  relevant, e.g., causing the 
subject to withdraw from the study , requiring treatment or causing apparent clinical 
manifestations, or judged relevant b y the Investigator, should be reported as an AE. Each 
event must be described in detail along w ith start and stop da tes, severit y, relationship to IP, 
action taken and outcome. Each event must be adequatel y supported b ydocumentation as it 
appears in the subject’s medical or case file.
A pregnancy  not verified before the Baseline Visit but occurring during the course of the 
study  will be not considered an AE, unless a relation to the study  drug is suspected. In any  
case, a Pregnancy Report Form must be completed and sent as soon as possible to the 
Sponsor, and the study  treatment must be discontinued. A cop y of the form should be filed at 
the study  site for follow -up until the end of the pregnancy .
4.4.9 Timelines and Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any SAE (see Section 4.4.6 )that occurs after signing the IC F through the last day  of 
subject´s participation in the clinical trial must be expeditiously  reported whether or not 
considered attributable to the study  drug. Each SAE must be fully  recorded in th e subject’s 
eCRF or SAE Report F orm.
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 61of 98SAEs will be reported using the designated SAE Report form. When the Investigator 
becomes aware of an SAE, she/he must submit electronicall y through the Electronic Data 
Capture ( EDC )system or when the EDC s ystem is not available submit a completed, signed 
and dated SAE Report Form (in English) within 24 hours to the Sponsor by  email/fax. 
Each SAE must be followed up until resolution or stabilization. After the initial report, all 
relevant information for SAE follow up, and for the outcome, must also be supplied to the 
Sponsor in a timely  manner (within 3 day s from its identification or within 24 hours for 
relevant new information) by  means of the SAE Report Form. In addition, the Sponsor or 
CRO may  request additional information and/or reports.
All SAE Report Forms must be reported to Grifols electronically  through the EDC sy stem or 
when the EDC s ystem is not available, reported to:
Grifols Global Pharmacovigilance
FAX (back -up onl y): (US/Canada)
and (International )
When required, and according to local law and regulations, SAEs must be reported to the 
IRB/EC and regulatory  authorities.
4.4.10 Type and Duration of the Follow -Up of Subjects after Adverse Event or 
Suspected ADR
In so far as is possible, all individuals wil l be followed up until the AE or suspected ADR has 
been resolved. If an AE/suspected ADR/SAE is present when the subject has completed the 
study , the course of the event must be followed until the final outcome is known or the event 
has been stabilized and no further change is expected and the Investigator decides that no 
further follow -up is necessary .
Any pregnancy  must be followed by  the Investigator until delivery  or to the end of 
pregnancy .
5STATISTICA L METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE 
SIZE
5.1 Statistic al and A nalytical Plan
Unless otherwise specified, descriptive statistics will include the number of non -missing

5.1.1 Subject Populations for Analysis
INTENT -TO-TREAT (ITT) POPULATION
The ITT population consists of all subjects who are randomized. 
SAFETY POPULATION
The Safet y population consists of all subjects who received an y amount of IP.   
PER PROTOCOL (PP) POPULATION
The PP population consists of all subjects in the ITT population without any major protocol 
deviation which has an impact on the primary  efficacy  data. Any deviations from the 
protocol will be recorded in the protocol deviation list. The validity  of a subject for inclusion 
in the PPpopulation will be assessed at a review meeting that will take place b efore 
finalizing the database. The review meeting will review the protocol deviation l ist, as well as 
data listings. If protocol deviations are identified which justify removing a subject from the 
per-protocol population, then these decisions will be documented.
5.1.2 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
Demographic and Baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics.
5.1.3 Efficacy Analyses
5.1.3.1 Primary Efficacy Analyses
The pr imary  efficacy  endpoint is the change in QMG score from Baseline (Week 0) to 
Week 24. The treatment comparison will be performed using anal ysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) with change in QMG score as dependent variable, treatment and Baseline
standard of care t reatment regimen as fixed factors and Baseline QMG score as a covariate. 
The null hy pothesis ( H0) and the alternative hy pothesis ( Ha) are:  
H0: μ1= μ 2
                                    Ha: μ1≠ μ2
Where μ 1and μ 2represent the population mean in the IGIV -C and Placebo group s, 
respectivel y.
For s ubjects who discontinued the study  early, the last observation carried forward (LOCF) 
method will be used to impute the change in QMG from B aseline to Week 24. A sensitivity  
analysis of completers with non -missing QMG score at Week 24 will be performed. For 
subjects who experience Treatment Failure (defined in Section 3.3.3 ) or MG crisis (defined 
in Section 3.3.4 ) the value at time of failure will be employ ed.
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 63of 98For the longitudinal measurements of QMG score at various time points, the treatment effects 
will be explored by  using the mixed -effect model repeated measures (MMRM) with change 
from Baseline as dependent variable; treatment, Baseline standard of care treatment regimen, 
protocol -specified visits, treatment- by-visit interaction as fixed effects; Baseline QMG value 
as covariate; and measures within -subject at each visit as a repeated measure.
Primary  Efficacy  analy ses will be based on the ITT population. For sensitivity  anal ysis, the 
same anal ysis will be repeated using the PP population. 
5.1.3.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses
Secondary  endpoints include the percentage of subjects achieving clinical response as 
measured b y QMG, MG Composite, and MG- ADL at Week 24. 
The following secondary efficacy  variables will be anal yzed using the ITT population: 
Percentage of subjects who experience a clinical impro vement assessed b y QMG score 
from Baseline (Week 0) to Week 24 where clinical improvement is defined as at least a 
3-point decrease in QMG
Percentage of subjects who experience a clinical improvement assessed b y the 
MGComposite from Baseline (Week 0) to W eek 24 where clinical improvement is 
defined as at least a 3-point decrease in the MG Composite 
Percentage of subjects who experience a clinical improvement as assessed by  MG-ADL 
from Baseline (Week 0) to Week 24 where clinical improvement is defined as a t least a 
2-point decrease in MG -ADL
Treatment comparison will be performed b y Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted 
for Baseline standard of care treatment regimen. Subjects who discontinued from the study  
early will be considered as not showing cl inical improvement. 
5.1.3.3 Exploratory Efficacy Analyses
Exploratory  efficacy  analy ses will be based on the ITT population. The following 
exploratory  efficacy variables will be anal yzed:
Percentage of subjects who experience a clinical improvement in QMG score ( defined 
above) at Weeks 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 
Time to first clinical improvement in QMG score (at least a 3-point decrease)
Time to Treatment Failure based on QMG score definition ( Section 3.3.3 )
Change from Baseline (Week 0) in QMG score to Weeks 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 
Percentage of subjects who experience a clinical improvement in the MG Composite 
(defined above) to Weeks 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 2 1
Change from Bas eline (Week 0) in MG Composite to Weeks 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24
Percentage of subjects who experience a clinical improvement in MG -ADL (defined 
above) to Weeks 9 and15
Change from Baseline (Week 0) in MG -ADL to Weeks 9, 15, and24
Change from Baseline in the 15- item MG -QOL 15 to Weeks 9, 15, and 24

For the time to event variables, Kaplan -Meier estimates will be provided and the treatment 
comparison will be performed using a log-rank test. For change from Baseline variabl es, 
ANCOVA and/or MMRM method ssimilar to the primary  efficacy  endpoint will be used. For 
percentage variables, the CMH test adjusted for Baseline standard of care treatment regimen 
will be used. 
MGF A postintervention alchange in status at Week 24 relative to Baseline will be 
summarized by  treatment group.
5.1.4 Safety Analyses
The safet y analysis will be based on safet y population.
The safet y analyses will be addressed by  listing and tabulation of AEs (includ ingsuspected 
ADRs), vital signs, phy sical examinatio ns and clinical laboratory  tests. Data will be 
described using descriptive anal yses.
Adverse events:
Safety  anal ysis will be primarily  focused on a descriptive anal ysis of suspected ADRs. Safet y 
assessment will be based on the prevalence of suspected ADRs that occurred during the 
clinical trial.
Adverse events will be coded and classified using MedDRA®terms (s ystem organ class and 
preferred terms). 
Adverse events will be classified as TEAEs or non- TEAEs. A TEAE will be defined as an 
AE which occurs betwee n the beginning of the first infusion of I GIV-C and the final visit of 
the clinica l trial. A non- TEAE will be defined as an AE which occurs prior to the first dose 
of IP. Non -TEAEs and TEAEs will be summarized separately . 
All AEs will be summarized by  presenting subject incidences and percentages, and they  will 
also be listed by  body  systems with subject identification codes.  
In addition, TEAEs, including suspected ADRs, will be summarized by system organ class, 
preferred term, causal- relationship, inten sity (severity ) and seriousness (serious vs. non -
serious) using descriptive statistics. At each level of summarization, a subject will only  be 
counted once per s ystem organ class or preferred term using the most severe or causal 
relationship AE. 
AEs tempo rally associated with the infusion of the I P (i.e., infusional AEs, including 
infusional suspected ADRs), will be summarized by  presenting infusion/subject incidences 
and percentage and listed. I n addition, the infusion rate in effect at the time of onset of the 
AE, the time the AE is first reported and the time the AE changes materially  in intensity  
and/or resolves will be also reported and listed.
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015  
CONFIDENTIAL    Page 65of 98Subjects with deaths, SAEs, suspected ADRs and AEs leading to premature discontinuation 
from the study  will b e listed and presented in a narrative form.  
Any AEs for which the Investigator causalit y assessment is missing or undetermined will be 
individually  listed.
Vital signs:
Vital signs (T, RR, HR, SBP and DBP) will be listed for each clinical trial subject and 
summarized by  treatment group . In case a subject presents a clinically  relevant abnormality  
of vital signs during an infusion, the event will be flagged and reported as an AE temporall y 
associated to the infusion. For each subject and for each infusion, every  vital sign will be 
considered. Clinical relevance will be based on the Investigator’s criteria. Abnormal vital 
signs judged as clinically relevant b y the Investigator in the context of the patient’s medical 
history  will be considered AEs. 
Physical examination :
Physical e xamination findings (normal and abnormal) will be listed for each clinical trial 
subject with the specific findings observed. Abnormal findings judged as clinically relevant 
by the Investigator in the context of the patient’s medical history  will be considered AEs.
Blood chemistry  and hematology :
All clinical laboratory  data for renal (creatinine, BUN), hepatic (ALT, AST, AL P, and TBL) 
and hematological parameters (CBC including differential leukocy te count) will be listed for 
each cl inical trial subject and summarized by  treatment group . Laboratory  results out of the 
normal range judged as clinically  relevant by  the Investigator in the context of the patient’s 
medical history  will be considered AEs.
Lab tests for TEs and hemoly sis:
The D-dimer for TE assessment and the laboratory  tests for detecting hemoly sis (including 
whole blood Hb, serum free Hb , haptoglobin, L DH, DAT, ARC, RBC, hematocrit, TBL and 
indirect bilirubin, and blood smear) will be listed and out of normal range results will be 
flagged. 
5.2 Determination of Sample Size
According to a stud y by Tackenberg and colleagues in 16 MG subjects with IGIV as 
maintenance therap y, the change from Baseline to endpoint in QMG score averaged 9.81 
with a standard deviation of 4.21 ( 52). Assuming that the IGIV treatment group is 50% better 
than the Placebo group, with alpha=0.05 and two -sided test, 28 subjects are needed for each 
treatment group (total 56 subjects) to have at least 80% power to det ect the treatment 
difference. Assuming a 10% drop out rate, 62 subjects are planned to be randomized.

eAssessments to be performed prior to IP infusion.
fEach recorded weight will be used to calculate the IP infusion dose for the scheduled visit and subsequent IP infusions until the next scheduled weight is measured.
gFull vital signs including temperature , respiratory rate , heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) , and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) will be recorded at each visit. 
During the infusions, abbreviated vital signs (HR, SBP, and DBP) will be recorded just b efore the start of each infusion (within 15 ± 5 minutes before the beginning of each 
infusion), 30 ± 10 minutes after starting infusion, and immediately after infusion completes.
hCollect blood samples at Baseline /Week 0 (Visit 1) prior to randomization but test only if the subject exhibits clinical signs and symptoms consistent with hepatitis A, 
hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV), or parvovirus B19 infection while participating in the study .See Section 3.8.3.3and Table 3-1for details.
iSubjects must withhold their acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (e.g., pyridostigmine) do sage for 12 hours prior to the v isit to assure accurate assessment of the QMG.
jModified Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) postintervention alchange in status relative to Baseline will be evaluated at Week 24 (Visit 9) wherein the 
Investigator will classify the patient as: (I) Improved, defined as a substantial decrease in pretreatment clinical manifestations of MG, QMG decrease ≥ 3 points; (U) 
Unchanged, defined as no substantial change in pretreatment clinical manifestations of MG; (W) Worse, defined as a substantia l increase in pretreatment clinical 
manifestations of MG, QMG increase ≥ 3points.
kHemolysis evaluati on (laboratory parameters) and t hromboembolism evaluation will be performed at Baseline prior to start of first IP loading infusion, at the end of the first 
infusion of the loading dose, at the time when last loading infusion is complete, and at the completion of each designated maintenance dosage at Week 3 and Week 6 (Visit 2 
and 3) and at Week 15(Visit 6). Hemolysis evaluation includes hemoglobin ( Hb), hematocrit, red blood cell count ( RBC), blood smear, ser um free -Hb, haptoglobin, lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), direct antiglobulin test (DAT), absolute reticulocyte count (ARC), total and direct/indirect bilirubin, urine for urinary sediment and hemoglobinuria, 
and hematuria. Hemolysis evaluation ( laboratory par ameters ) will also be performed 7 days post loading dose infusion at Baseline (Week 0) and 7 days post study drug
infusion at Weeks 3 (Visit 2), 6 (Visit 3), and 15 (Visit 6).
lInitiation of induction (loading) dose of IVIG 2 g/kg of body weight begins afte r all Baseline assessments are complete and patient is randomized. Loading dose is infused 
over 2 days. Note that for the loading dosage 2 days is standard (2 to 4 days is allowed as an extension for tolerability issues or higher weight, i.e., limit for IG IV-C infusion is 
no more than 80g/day [corresponding to 80 kg body weight]).
mMaintenance doses of 1 g/kg of body weight are administered over 1 day every three weeks through Week 21 (Visit 8). Note that the maintenance dosage is given over 1 day 
as the sta ndard time interval (divided dosage over 2 days is allowed for tolerability issues or higher weight, i.e., limit for IGIV -C infusion is no more than 80g/day 
[corresponding to 80 kg body weight]).
nThe Early Termination visit will consist of the same assessm ents as Week 24 (Visit 9 ) except for q uantitative/semi -quantitative binding, blocking, and modulating 
acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies which are not required.

Subjects will be monitored for signs and s ymptoms of arterial and venous thromboembolic 
(TE) events. Arterial and venous TE events will be identified according to definitions in the 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) [ 51]. Such events include, but are not limited 
to, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary  embolism (PE), acute my ocardial infarction, 
cerebral infarction, acute ischemic heart disea se, embolism or thrombosis of arteries of lower 
extremities, sagittal sinus thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis and injury  of mesenteric artery .  
All TE events will be recorded as adverse events (AEs) and reported accordingl y. An y TE 
event fulfilling an y of the criteria for “serious” will be reported as a serious adverse event 
(SAE).
The Sponsor’s Medical Monitor (or designee) will routinely  review reported AEs for possible 
TE events.
Thromboembolic events risk will be determined by  the Investigator or appr opriate study staff 
as indicated b y the following schedule ( Table 1 ):

Description of the procedures:
For the detection of hemoly sis, the following procedure will be carried out to all the study  
population:
1. Blood testing: whole blood Hb, serum free Hb , haptoglobin, LDH, DAT, ARC, RBC, 
hematocrit, TBL and indirect biliru bin, and blood smear.
2.Urine testing: urinary  sediment and hemoglobinuria.
3. Clinical parameters including red/dark urine, jaundice, as well as other signs and 
symptoms of anemia (such as pallor or tach ycardia).
Definition of hemoly sis associated with the us e of IGIV -C: 
In this clinical trial, an IVIg -associated hemol ytic reaction is one in which there is evidence 
of a new hemoly tic process [ 55]. Consideration of possible hemoly sis as defined below 
should only  be triggered if other explanatory  factors/conditions can be excluded. Subjects 
from this study  may  be severel y ill and may  have anemia for a number of reasons. Therefore, 
it is important to exclude the underl ying conditions and concomitant medications as a ca use 
of anemia. The exclusions are:
-History  or examination consistent with an alternative cause of anemia including blood 
loss (e.g. ,frequent phlebotomy  is highl y associated with changes in Hb and hematocrit 
levels for patients admitted to an internal medi cine service [ 56, 57]), iron- deficiency  
anemia, other drug -induced hemoly tic anemia, or anemia associated with an underly ing 
disease (e.g., autoimmune hemoly tic anemia [ 58, 59]).
-Negative DAT.
Absence of other inclusion criteria, in particular absence of evidence for hemoly sis.
Protocol GTI1408 –Amendment 1   15 Jul 2015

3 PROTOCOL VERSION 4.0 SUMMARY OF CHANGES TABLE  
The primary reason for this protocol amendment is to modify participant eligibility criteria for 
clarity and to ensure enrollment of the intended patient population. 
The clinically relevant changes , ie, changes that affect the type or frequency of protocol 
procedures, or the addition of information to the protocol that influences clinical 
decision -making or consent, are itemized below:   
Protocol Version 4.0 (08 December 2020) 
Section # and Name  Description o f Change  Brief Rationale  
Section 1.1 Synopsis  
Section 4.1 Overall Design  
Section 9.4.2 Randomization and 
Stratification  The number  of global sites where 
participants will be enrolled was 
changed from approximately 90 to approximately 100 global sites.  Additional sites  were added to meet 
enrollment g oals. 
Section 1.1 Synopsis  
Section 4 .1 Overall Design  
Section 5 .1 Inclusion Criteria  The inclusion requirement for participants to be on at least 50% of the maximum recommended dose of ACEI or ARB was modifie d to 
allow participants to be on < 50% dose, as long as that is the 
maximum tolerated dose for the 
participant and he/she  has been on 
this dose for at least 3 months.  The doses of ACE Is/ARBs vary 
considerably across countries, depending on the local clinic al 
practice, ethnic differences in body mass,  and patient tolerability  to 
higher doses. Hence, this 
requirement was modified , and 
participants are now required to be 
on maximum tolerated dose, rather 
than on a minimum dose 
requirement  of at least 50% of th e 
maximum recommended dose.   
Section 1.1 Synopsis  
Section 1.2, Figure 1 Study Design Schema 
Section 4.1 Overall Design Section 5.1 Inclusion Criteria  An inclus ion criterion was added, 
stipulating that participants with an 
eGFR ≥ 30  mL/min/1.73 m2 and 
< 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 may also 
undergo screening, if they have undergone a kidney biopsy within 12 months of the date of init ial 
screening and do not have ≥ 50% tubulo- interstitial fibrosis (T2 if 
using MEST -C score) or crescents 
in
 ≥ 25% of glomeruli (C2 if us ing 
MEST -C score).  
The inclusion criterion for participants to have stable eGFR or to repeat eGFR measurements after 15 days if previous values are not 
available or if eGFR is not stable was removed.  Particip
ants with eGFR 
≥ 30 mL/min/1.73m2 and 
< 45 mL/min/1.73m2 have a high 
unmet need for novel therapeutic options; however, they may also have significant kidney fibrosis, which would limit potential benefit 
from VIS649. Hence, this criterion 
was expanded to this eGFR range only if these patients have rec ent 
biopsy evidence of absent advanced 
fibrosis or crescents.  
eGFR is generally stable over shorter periods of time (e.g., weeks/months). Hence, the first eGFR can be considered as baseline and thus avoid the inconvenience to participants of requiring a re peat 
labor atory measurement in 15 days’ 
time.  
CONFIDENTIAL  VIS649 -201 Protocol Version 4.0  
 
 4 Protocol Version 4.0 ( 08 December 2020) 
Section # and Name  Description o f Change  Brief Rationale  
The inclusion criterion for 
participants to have stable proteinuria or to repeat proteinuria measurements after 15 days if 
previous values are not available or 
if proteinuria is not stable was removed.  
 
   
Inclusion criteria stipulating that 
participants should be on stable and 
maximally tolerated doses of ACEIs/ARBs for at least 3 months with uPCR > 0.75g/g or 24 -hour 
protein ≥ 1.0 g/d and eGFR > 45 mL/min/1.73m2 were removed 
from Figure  1. Patients with pe rsistent proteinuria 
above the stated threshold comprise the target population for VIS649 therapy, irrespective of the 
day-to-day variability typically 
described at this range of 
proteinuria. Hence, the first proteinuria can be considered as baseline and t hus avoid the 
inconvenience to participants of 
requiring a repeat measurement in 
15 days’ time.  
For simplification of the schema, inclusion criteria were modified.  
Section 1.1 Synopsis  
Section 5.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 An exclusion criteria specification was added, stipulating that 
participants with isolated nephrotic range proteinuria (> 3.5 g/day) will be eligible.  
The exclusion criteria due to previous immunosuppressive therapies were changed from 2 years (for combined 
immunosuppressive therapy) and 6 mont hs (for systemic steroids) to 
16 weeks from the time of 
screening.  Additional language added to clarify these criteria.  
 
 
Systemic steroids and other 
immunosuppressive therapies typically do not have significant immunosuppressive potential  
beyond 12 weeks following 
discontinuation. As a safety buffer, 
4 weeks were added for a total of 16 weeks. Hence, the exclusion criterion was updated to exclude participants who have received these therapies in the previous 16 weeks.  
Section 1.1 Synopsis  
Section 5.1 Incl usion Criteria  
 Minimum requirement for IgM was updated to 37 mg/dL.  Normal Ig levels vary significantly 
across the Globe  and are affected 
by race and ethnicity.  The IgM was 
updated to reflect emerging and 
recent data on IgM levels. The level of 37 mg/dL h as been cited in the 
literature as  the lower limit of 
normal in adults  as listed below:

Section 10.2 Appendix 2  The schedule of assessment w as 
updated to reflect the continuous AE monitoring and concomitant medications review through Day 485.  
Blood sample for total IgA, IgG, 
and IgM13 was removed from D1 
postinfusion.  
Footnote 1 and Sections 1.1, 4, and 
5 were updated to reflect the  
ACEI/ARB  therapy  eligibility 
criteria . 
Footnote 6 and Section 8.2.2 w ere 
update d to specify that vital signs  
measurements will be recorded postinfusion at 60 ( ±10) minutes 
and 2 hours.  
Footnote 10 and  Section 10.2 were 
updated to specify  that dipstick will 
be performed locally and that  local 
laboratory results will be  permitted  
for the urine dipstick and microsc opy. Administrative updates for clarity.  
Section 1.1 Synopsis  
Section 9.5 Interim Analyses  Additional specifications were 
added to the 3 interim PK/Ig 
analyses, including group-
unblinded PK/Ig summaries (with individual participant treatment blinded).  
The first of the 2 early interim 
efficacy analyses, which may be 
performed when at least 16 participants have been treated, 
was changed from at least 6 months to at least 2 months, optimally 
when at least 50% of the 16 (or 
more) participants have  achieved > 
30% reduction in uPCR based on The time required to see reduction 
in proteinuria after treatment w ith 
VIS649 is currently unknown. It is 
possible that the reduction in proteinuria may occur earlier than 6 months. This amendment gives 
the flexibility to perform a blinded 
assessment of proteinuria response 
as early as 2 months after treatment with VIS649. As the analysis will be performed on blinded uPCR data, and only if the aforementione d 
criteria are met, there is no statistical cost. These data and analyses will be prepared by a 
separate, unblinded team for

Section # and Name  Description o f Change  Brief Rationale  
Section 7.3 Lost to Follow -up A lost -to-follow up action  was 
added, stipulating that the 
particip ant, if reached, should be 
invited to attend EOS visits, which 
can also be done via phone call, 
medical record review, etc. if the participant is unwilling to visit the clinic.  This was added to a llow data 
collectio n remotely.  
Section 8 Study Assessments and Procedures  Submission of pathology report that confirms IgAN diagnosis was removed  as part of eCRF collection.  Actual report not required.  
Section 8.5, Table 5 
Pharmacokinetic and Serum 
Immunoglobulin Sampling  
Schedule  Preinfusion time was updated fr om 
-30 min alone to a range of - 180 
min to -1 min. This was added to increase 
flexibility in collecting pre -infusion 
samples.

 12 1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1 Synopsis  
Name of Sponsor: Visterra, Inc.  
Name of Investigational Intervention:  VIS649 
Protocol Title:  A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo- Controlled, Multiple -Dose 
Study to Eval uate the Efficacy and Safety of VIS649 in Participants with 
Immunoglobulin A (IgA) Nephropathy (IgAN) 
Short Title:  Phase 2 Study of VIS649 for IgA Nephropathy 
Rationale:  VIS649 is a humanized  immunoglobulin G 2 (IgG 2) monoclonal antibody that 
binds to and blocks the biological actions of the cytokine A PRoliferation 
Inducing Ligand (APRIL), a key factor in the p roductio n of aberrantly 
glycosylated IgA 1 (a-g IgA 1), which  is critical to the  pathogenesis of IgAN. The 
central mechanism for the development of IgAN is the production of a-g IgA 1. 
These a-g IgA 1 act as autoantigens and lead to development  of autoantibodies 
forming circulating immune complexes which deposit in the mesangium of the glomeruli and  in turn, trigger  an inflammatory response and compleme nt 
activation, causing damage to the kidneys.  
In data from a single-ascending dose study (VIS649-101) of VIS649 in healthy 
participants , VIS649 reduced serum levels of IgA and a -g IgA
1. The current 
study will test the hypothesis that blocking the biological actions of APRIL  in 
IgAN participants lead s to reduction of serum IgA (including a -g IgA 1) levels  
and will reduce or halt the progression of IgAN, as measured by decrease in  
proteinuria.  
The findings from this s tudy will form the basis for subsequent cl inical 
development of VIS649. 
Objectives and 
Endpoints: The key objectives and endpoints of the study are: 
Primary Safety Objective  Primary Safety Endpoint  
• To evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of monthly doses of VIS649 at each of 3 dosing levels, administered IV to IgAN

compared with saline placebo infusions as an add -on to SOC 
treatment with ACEI/ARB therapy  • AEs graded by  severity , clinical 
laboratory tests, vital sign  
measurement s, and physical 
examinations

Overall Design:  This is a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled, 
multiple -dose study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenously (IV) 
administered VIS649 over a 12- month treatment course in participants with 
IgAN. Participants will be enrolled from approximately 100 global sites in  
approximately  16 countries.  
Screening evaluations, including physical examinations, vital signs, 12- lead 
electrocardiogram, safety laboratory testing (serum chemistry, hematology, 
urinalysis, serology, hemoglobin A1c, and pregnancy), blood sampling for 
baseline Ig  levels (IgA, IgG, and IgM),  and 24-hour urine collection, will take 
place during the  30 days prior to the first dose of study intervention.  
To be eligible, participants should be on stable and maximally tolerated doses 
of either angiotensin -converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin 
receptor blocker (ARB)  therapy , as per standard of care (SOC) and applicable 
guidelines, for at least 3 months. Participants should optimally be on at least 
50% of the maximum recommended dose   of these agents; however, if a 
participant is on their maximally tolerated dose (and this is < 50% of the maximum recommended dose) and has been on this dose for at least 3 months, they may be enrolled.  
Participants who are unable to tolerate ACEI/ARB th erapy may be eligib le for 
participation in the study, if their overall management of IgAN, including blood 
pressure (BP) control, is as per local SO C and applicable guidelines . 
Enrolled participants must be 18 years of age or older with an IgAN diagnosis 
confirmed by biopsy.  
It is anticipated that most biopsies resulting in a diagnosis of IgAN will have 
been interpreted using the MEST score - Mesangial cellularity, endocapillary 
proliferation, segmental sclerosis, tubular atrophy (Cattran et al, 2009 ) or 
MEST- Crescents ( C) scoring system  (Trima rchi, Barratt et al. 2017 ) from the 
Oxford classification of IgAN.  
A MEST or MEST-C score finding on kidney biopsy of T2 or C2 is 
exclusionary for this study. If the biopsy was not reported using the Oxford 
classification schema, the following findings (corr esponding to these Oxford 
classifications) are exclusionary: a) > 50% tubular atrophy, and/or b) > 25% 
crescents.  
Participants must have screening urinary protein/creatinine ratio 
(uPCR) ≥ 0.75 g/g or 24 -hour urine protein ≥  1.0 g/d , as measured from a 
24-hour urine collection (or an intended 24- hour urine collection).  
Participants must have estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR ) ≥ 45 mL/min /1.73 m
2, calculated using the Chronic Kidn ey Disease 
Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD- EPI) formula ( Levey, Stevens et al. 2009 ). 
Participants with eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and < 45 mL /min/1.73 m2 may 
also undergo screening, if they have undergone a kidney biopsy within 12 
months of the date of initial screening and do not have ≥ 50% tubulo-i nterstitial 
fibrosis (T2 if using MEST -C score) or crescents in  ≥ 25% of glomeruli (C2 if 
using MEST -C score) . 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  VIS649 -201 Protocol Version 4.0  
 
 15 The study  will evaluate 3 dose levels of VIS649 (2, 4, and 8 mg/kg) versus 
placebo. A total of 144 participants will be randomized with equal allocation 
(1:1:1:1) across the 4 intervention groups (approximately 36 participants per 
group). Randomization will be stra tified first by region (Japan vs rest  of world).  
A target o f 12 or more  participants are planned to be randomized in Japan; these 
participants will be randomized with equal allocation and without further stratification.  The randomization for the rest-of- world will be stratified by 
screening uPCR (≤  2.0 g/g vs > 2.0 g/g).  
VIS649 or placebo wil l be administered as 12  monthly IV infusions starting on 
Day 1/Month 0. Participants will return to the study center on Days 8 and 18, 
then monthly through Month 14 and on Month 16 for safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic (PK) , and/or pharmacodynamic ( PD) assessments.  
Safety assessments will include review of adverse events (AEs)
 (including 
hypersensitivity reaction and anaphylactic reaction), physical examinations, 
injec tion site tolerability (pain, irritation , and tissue damage), cli nical laboratory 
assessments (including biochemistry, hematology, urinalysis , and pregnancy 
testing ), laboratory testing (including serum Ig levels and  antidrug antibodies  
[ADAs] ) vital sign measurements and  use of concomitant medications. 
Participants wil l return to the study center on approximately  Month 16 , at least  
155 days following the last dose of study intervention (Dose 12) for an 
end -of - study  (EOS)  visit , at which  time final safety , PK, PD, and efficacy 
assessments will be performed . Participants discontinuing dosing earlier will 
attend an early termination visit at the time of dosing  discontinuation and will 
be encouraged to attend the study visits as per schedule of assessments.  
A rollover, open- label extension study will be offered  to enable access to 
VIS649 (there will be no placebo arm) for study participants who have completed th is trial, provided that the Investigator believes  that the participants  
might benefit, and that  the site has agreed to  participate in the extension study. 
Further details will be provided in a separate protocol.  
Number of 
Participants:  Approximately 144  participants. A target of 12 or more participants are planned 
to be randomized and enrolled in Japan. T he remaining partici pants will be 
enrolled at  sites in  the rest of  world ; there are no  other country- specific 
enrollment targets.  
Intervention Groups and Duration: The study will evaluate 3 dose levels of VIS649 (2, 4, and 8 mg/kg) versus 
placebo. VIS649 or placebo will be administered as a single, monthly IV infusion for 12  monthly doses.  
VIS649 will be administered IV over 1 hour, in a single, final volume 100 mL 
infusion in normal saline (0.9% NaCl), followed by a 25-mL saline flush. The 
dose of study intervention for the duration of the study will be based on the 
participant’s Month 0 pre -dose weight. 
Placebo (0.9% NaCl) will be administered IV over 1 hour as a single 100- mL 
infusion, followed by a 25 mL saline flush. 
An unblinded pharmacist (or ot her unblinded designee) will prepare drug or 
placebo for infusion. Participants, the Sponsor, the Investigator, and all other 
site study staff will be blinded to study intervention.  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  VIS649 -201 Protocol Version 4.0  
 
 16 The total study duration for each participant (from screening to EOS ) will be up 
to approximately 17 months ( assuming up to 1 month for screening, 12  months 
for monthly doses [ including  30 days after the 12th dose ], and follow-up visits 
through at least 155 days  after the last dose of study intervention).  
Target Population: Key inclusion criteria for eligibility into the study are the following:

maximally tolerated doses of either ACEI or ARB, as per local SOC 
and applicable guidelines, for at least 3 months preceding screening . 
Participants should optimally  be on at least 50% of the maximum 
recommended dose of these agents; however, if a participant is on their 
maximally tolerated dose (and this is <  50% of the ma ximum 
recommended dose) and has been on this dose for at least 3 months, 
they may be enrolled. Participants who are unable to tolerate 
ACEI/ARB therapy may be eligible for participation in the study, if 
their overall management of IgAN, including BP control, is as per local SOC and applicable guidelines.

screening and do not have ≥ 50% tubulo- intersti tial fibrosis (T2 if using 
MEST- C score) or crescents in ≥ 25% of glomeruli (C2 if using 
MEST- C score ). The eGFR should be measured when the participant  is 
considered to be in a steady state without recent changes in volume 
status, medications that could i mpact the result (eg , nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs [ NSAIDs ], aminoglycosides, co- trimoxazole) , 
or changes in dietary protein intake. 
6. Participant’s serum Ig values must meet the following criteria:

Data Safety Monitoring Board: An independent data  safety monitoring board ( DSMB ) will review unblinded 
safety data.  The DSMB will meet at 5 scheduled data review meetings and  as 
needed  on an ad hoc basis. Details regarding the content and scope of safety 
assessments, as well as the governing of the DSMB, will be described in a separate DSMB c harter.  
CONFIDENTIAL  VIS649 -201 Protocol Version 4.0

Statistical Methods:  General Considerations 
All data collected will be documented using summary tables, figures, and/or 
data listings presented by intervention and dose group. For continuous 
variables, descriptive statistics (number [n]; mean ; geometric me an and 
coefficient of variation [ %CV ], as appropriate; median ; standard deviation; 
minimum ; and maximum) will be presented. For categorical variables, 
frequencies and percentages will be presented. As appropriate, a 95% CI w ill be 
presented. Graphical displays may be presented.  
Randomization and Stratification 
Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive VIS649 at 2, 
4, or 8 mg/kg, or placebo, with approximately 36 participants randomized per 
intervention group. Randomization will be stratified first by region (Japan vs 
rest of world). Japanese participants will be randomized with equal allocation 
and without further stratification. Randomization for the rest of world will then 
be stratified by screenin g uPCR ( ≤ 2.0 g/g vs > 2.0 g/g).   
Interim Analyses  
In addition to 5 DSMB safety reviews, 3 interim PK /Ig analyses and 2 interim 
efficacy analyses are planned. The interim PK/ Ig analyses will provide 
additional data for population PK/PD modeling and will advise the study Sponsor on future study design and planning.  
An early interim efficacy analysis may be performed when  at least 
16 participants have been treated for at least 2 months , optimally when at least 
50% of the 16 (or more) participants have achieved  > 30% reduction in uPCR  
based on review of blinded uPCR data across all study participants. The interim 
analysis will present group- unblinded efficacy summaries (with indi vidual 
participant treatment blinded) and will be prepared by a separate, unblinded 
team  for Sponsor review to inform future study design.  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  VIS649 -201 Protocol Version 4.0  
 
 19 A second interim efficacy analysis will be performed at the time of the fourth 
scheduled DSMB meeting (once 50% of randomized participants have 
completed 6 months of study dosing and approximately 20 part icipants have 
completed 12 months of study dosing). Group- unblinded efficacy summaries 
(with individual participant treatment blinded) will be prepared for Sponsor 
review to inform future study design.  
The interim efficacy analyses will not include hypoth esis testing and will be for 
the purpose of future study design and planning. The primary efficacy endpoint, 
change in proteinuria levels from baseline, will be analyzed. No modifications to this study protocol are planned based on results of the interim analyses.  
Nonetheless, to account for multiple reviews of the efficacy endpoint, the type I error rate applied at the end of the study will be reduced by 0.002 for each 
interim efficacy review, resulting in a 2 -sided end-of-study type I error rate of 
0.046. 
Planned analyses The primary efficacy outcome for this study is the change from baseline in 
uPCR on the natural log scale at Month 12. Dose response will be explored 
using orthogonal contrasts. Sensitivity analysis will follow using dose as a 
continuous c ovariate.  
In addition, to assess the dose response over time, a Mixed Model with Repeated Measurements (MMRM) , which includes fixed class- effects of 
treatment  (intervention), visit, randomization strata , and treatment -by - visit 
interaction, with a fixed e ffect covariate of baseline uPCR on the natural log 
scale will be used . 
Secondary efficacy endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
In addition, c omparisons between dose groups against placebo will be 
performed using an Analysis of Covar iance or MMRM for continuous measures 
and logistic regression or generalized estimating equations for categorical 
variables.  
Safety will be assessed by evaluation of AEs (including hypersensitivity 
reaction and anaphylactic reaction), physical examinations, injection site 
tolerability (pain, irritation , and tissue damage), clinical laboratory assessments 
(including biochemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and pregnancy testing), laboratory testing (including serum Ig levels and ADAs) , vital sign  
measurement s, and use of concomitant medications.  
Analysis of PK parameters will include participant data -listings of serum 
concentrations and summary statistics by intervention group, including mean, 
geometric mean, standard deviation, %CV, median, and range, as appropriate. Summary graphs including mean concentrati on-time profiles by group will also 
be presented. For the subset of participants in  whom intensive PK samples are 
collected, serum concentration data will be analyzed by noncompartmental analysis and population PK methods using nonlinear mixed - effects mod eling , 
as implemented in NONMEM or equivalent software. Additional analyses and 
summaries may be generated , as appropriate.

 2. INTRODUCTION 
VIS649 is a humanized immunoglobulin G2 ( IgG 2) monoclonal antibody being developed for the 
treatment of immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), an autoimmune glomerulonephritis 
characterized by the deposition of immuno globulin A ( IgA)-containing immune complexes in 
the kidney. 
2.1 Study Rationale  
Immunoglobulin A nephropathy is a chro nic disease affecting the kidneys. It is clinically 
characterized by proteinuria, hematuria and progressive decline of glomerular filtration r ate 
(GFR). IgAN is characterized histologically by dominant or co-dominant deposition of IgA in 
the kidney glomerulus ( Rodrigues, Haas et al. 2017) . The central mechanism for the 
development of IgAN is the production of aberrantly glycosylated IgA 1 (a-g IgA 1), which has 
been attributed to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. These a- g IgA 1 act as 
autoantigens and lead to development of autoantibodies forming circulating immune complexes 
that deposit in the mesangium of glomeruli and in turn, trigger an inflammatory response and 
complement activation  (Kiryluk, Moldoveanu et al. 2011, Berthoux, Suzuki et al. 2012, Kiryluk, 
Novak et al. 2013, Kiryluk, Li et al. 2014, Kiryluk and Novak 2014). This results in episodic and cumulative kidney damage. Natural history studies indicate that IgAN may progress to end -stage 
renal  disease (ESRD) in approximately 30% of patients, over the course of 10 years ( Lai, Tang et 
al. 2016).  
Proteinuria is an important marker of progression of renal disease in patients with IgAN. Patients 
with significant proteinu ria (> 1.0 g/day) have a faster decline of e stimated glomerular filtration 
rate ( eGFR ) and progression to ESRD, when compared to patients with lower degrees of 
proteinuria (< 500 mg/day). Hence, reduction in proteinuria is a crucial aspect  in the 
managemen t of IgAN  (Reich, Troyanov et al. 2007, Nam, Kie et al. 2014, Inker,  Mondal et al. 
2016). 
The cytokine A PRoliferation Inducing Ligand (APRIL), which belongs to the tumor necrosis 
factor ligand superfamily, has emerged as a key factor in the pathogenesis of IgAN through mediation of the Ig isotype switch during B- cell development, production of IgA, plasma- cell 
survival, and possibly specifically influencing production of a- g IgA
1 as well  (Castigli, Scott et 
al. 2004, Varfolo meev, Kischkel et al. 2004, Endo, Nishio et al. 2007, Bossen, Cachero et al. 
2008). Studies in IgAN patients have shown that elevated APRIL levels correlate with poor 
kidney outcomes, when compared with patients with lower APRIL levels ( Han, Yang et al. 2016, 
Zhai, Zhu et al. 2016) . A similar trend is also seen with a -g IgA 1 levels, with higher l evels 
associated with faster and more frequent progression to kidney failure when compared to patients with lower a -g IgA
1 levels  (Castigli, Scott et al. 2004 , Berthoux, Suzuki et al. 2012, Zhao , Hou et 
al. 2012). 
VIS649 is a humanized  IgG 2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to and blocks the biological 
actions of APRIL, preventing its binding to its receptors, transmembrane activator and calcium -
modulator and cyclophilin ligand ( CAML ) intera ctor (TACI), and B- cell maturation antigen

 (BCMA). Blocking the biological actions of APRIL reduces the production of IgA. The 
hypothesis to be tested in this study is that a decrease in the production of IgA and a- g IgA 1 will 
diminish the for mation of cir culating immune complexes and their deposition in the glomeruli, 
allowing injury repair and clinical improvement, as measured by reduc tion in  proteinuria. 
In data from a single-ascending dose study (VIS649 -101) of VIS649 in healthy participants, 
VIS649 reduced serum levels of IgA and a -g IgA 1. The current study will test the hypothesis that 
blocking the biological actions of APRIL in IgAN participants  leads to reduction of serum IgA 
(including a- g IgA 1) levels and will reduce or halt the progression of IgAN as measured by 
reduction in proteinuria (the study’s primary efficacy endpoint). The current study will also 
assess the safety of VIS649 in participants  with IgAN and collect extensive data on 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD).  
The findings from this study will form the basis for subsequent clinical development of VIS649. 
2.2 Background  
Immunoglobulin A nephropathy is one of the most common primary glomerular diseases and 
affects patients g lobally, with some geographical variation in incidence a nd prevalence ( Wyatt 
and Julian 2013, Rodrigues, Haas et al. 2017, Schena and Nistor 2018). Clinical presentation 
varies from incidentally detected asymptomatic hematuria and proteinuria to rapidly progressive 
glomerulonephritis requiring dialysis. Immunoglobulin A nephropathy is a significant cause of chronic kid ney disease (CKD) and ESRD, with 30-40% of patients reaching ESRD 20-30 years 
after the first clinical presentation. Immunoglobulin A nephropathy can occur in either sporadic (90-95%) or familial (5 %-10%) patterns. Patients with familial IgAN might h ave po orer 
prognoses than those with sporadic disease, with an increased risk of progression to renal failure (Lai, Tang et al. 2016). 
Immunoglobulin A nephropathy is diagnosed by kidney biopsy, which shows dominant or co-dominant IgA deposition on immunofluorescence. The pathogenesis of IgAN is currently 
thought to be a multi-hit process, the “first hit” being the production of a-g IgA
1. The primary 
defect is the deficiency  of galactose in the hinge region of IgA 1. As a consequence, the 
N-acetylgalactosamine in the truncated IgA 1 hinge region glycan is exposed and acts as an 
autoantigen. Multiple cohort studies have shown the relationship between elevated a- g IgA 1 and 
IgAN, with higher a- g IgA 1 levels resulting in  more rapid disease progression. The “second hit” 
consists of IgA and IgG autoantibody production against these a- g IgA 1. The “third hit” consists 
of formation of circulating immune complexes consisting of the IgG/IgA auto antibody and a-g IgA
1 antigen complex. The “fourth hit” consists of deposition of these circulating immune 
complexes in the mesangium of the glomeruli. These antigen-antibody complexes are 
nephritogenic and trigger an inflammatory response leading to infiltration of macrophages, 
monocytes and T cells, local release of cytokines, complement activation, and activation of the renin -angiotensin cascade. This leads to glomerular injury and tubulo- interstitial fibrosis, 
clinically manifesting as proteinuria, hematuria, hypertension, and reduced GFR  (Berthoux, 
Suzuki et al. 2012, Floege, Moura et al. 2014, Knoppova, Reily et al. 2016, Mestecky, Novak et al. 2016). 
CONFIDENTIAL  VIS649 -201 Protocol Version  4.0

 While p roteinuria is a common manifestation of IgAN , the degree of proteinuria correlates with 
disease progression, with faster decline of eGFR, and progression to ESRD in patients with high -
grade proteinuria ( > 1.0 g/d) when compared to patients with low-grade proteinuria (< 0.5 g/d) 
(Reich, Troyanov et al. 2007, Nam, Kie et al. 2014 , Inker, Mondal et al. 2016, Thompson, 
Carroll et al. 2019). Control of proteinuria is a key therapeutic target in patients with IgAN. 
Measures to control proteinuria often consist of renin -angiotensin- aldosterone system ( RAAS ) 
blockade in the form of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy , blood pressure (BP) control, statins to control cholesterol, smoking 
cessation, low- salt diet, low -protein diet, and avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs. If patients 
continue to have significant proteinur ia despite these measures,  they are usually treated with 
nonspecific immunosuppressive agents such as steroids, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or cyclophosphamide ( Boyd, Cheung et al. 2012, KDIGO 2012, Radhakrishnan and Cattran 2012, 
Barbour and Feehally 2017, Rodrigues, Haas et al. 2017). These drugs, especially steroids (Pozzi, Andrulli et al. 2004, Rauen, Eitner et al. 2015, Tesar, Troyanov et al. 2015, Lv, Zhang et 
al. 2017), have been shown to be beneficial from a re nal perspective in some studies, but their 
use is  often  complicated by significant adverse effects such as increased risk  of infections, 
metabolic derangements, cosmetic changes, weight gain, fractures, and  neuropsychiatric 
manifestations . Some of these ag ents have other significant risks such as increased risk of 
malignancies with prolonged administration. The significant s ide effects of these drugs  preclude 
chronic use of these agents and limit their benefits in a chronic disease such as IgAN.  
APRIL is a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily of ligands and is emerging as a key 
mediator in IgAN pathogenesis and disease progression based on convergence of genetic, 
biochemical, and clinical data. APRIL is produced by myeloid and mucosal epithelial c ells. 
APRIL regulates B cell -mediated immune responses through several mechanisms, including 
class -switch recombination, principally through its 2 receptors : TACI and BCMA. APRIL is also 
important for plasmablast differentiation in secondary lymphoid organs. In addition, myeloid-derived APRIL mediates plasma cell survival by promoting the formation of so- called “survival 
niches” within the bone marrow microenvironment and mucosal compartments, leading to the establishment of a reservoir for long- lived antib ody-secreting cells  (Bossen, Cachero et al. 2008). 
Evidence of the critical role of APRIL in IgAN includes the following: (a) serum a- g IgA
1 
(autoantigen) levels ar e elevated in patients with IgA N and correlate with APRIL levels and 
disease severity; (b) genome- wide association studies link APRIL to the disease; (c) serum 
APRIL is elevated in patients with IgAN and higher APRIL levels among IgAN patients are 
associat ed with more rapid progression to kidney failure ( Mestecky, Raska et al. 2013, Han, 
Yang et al. 2016, Muto, Manfroi et al. 2017). 
In a mouse model of IgAN, administration of an anti-APRIL antibody similar to VIS649 led to 
lower IgA deposits in the kidney, lower proteinuria, and less glomerular sclerosis compared with 
animals administered a control antibody that does not bind APRIL. These data suggest that APRIL plays a key role in the pathogenesis of IgAN and that blocking APRIL could be an attractive approach for the treatment of IgAN  (Myette, Kano et al. 2019).  
VIS649 is a humanized IgG
2 mAb against the biologically active form of APRIL.  VIS649 was 
tested in healthy human participant s in a Phase 1, randomized, placebo -controlled,

 single-ascending dose, f irst-in-human study to a ssess the s afety, t olerability, PK , and PD of 
VIS649 (VIS649-101). The study enrolled 51 participants  in 5 sequential dosing cohorts. 
Participant s in Cohorts 1 to 4 received 4 different dose levels of VIS649 (0.5, 2, 6, and 12 mg/kg, 
respectively), enrolling 9 participants  per cohort (7 participant s receiving VIS649 and 
2 participant s receiving placebo). Cohort 5 had 15 participants  with 10 receiving VIS649 and 
5 participants  receiving placebo. Participants in Cohort 5 received 6  mg/kg of VIS649 on Day 1 
and subsequently received a tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine on Day 28. Blinded group data 
are available, including IgA levels. Preliminary data show that the total serum IgA decline d by 
up to ~60% from normalized baseline values  in these healthy participants . The vaccine response 
in Cohort 5 was intac t, with a comparable IgG response to Td vaccine in participant s receiving 
VIS649 and participant s receiving placebo. Mean serum IgG levels declined by up to ~35% 
below normalized baseline values and mean IgM levels showed a marked decline of up to ~70% 
below the normalized baseline values. These declines in the Ig levels were reversible and the 
time taken to restoration of Ig levels to baseline was dependent on the dose of VIS649, with 
higher doses requiring a longer time period. VIS649 was very well tolera ted across all dose 
levels and there were no serious adverse events  (SAEs) attributed to VIS649. Further details can 
be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
The adverse risk -benefit ratio of nonspecific immunosuppressive agents precludes the chronic 
use of such agents and highlights the need for the development of an effective alternative that 
acts specifically on relevant pathophysiological factors in IgAN and is safe for chronic use. 
2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment

was not suppressed by 
VIS649, and peripheral blood 
myeloid cell line populations 
were unaffected.  
IgM suppression risk 
 Based on the mechanism of action of 
VIS649, preclinical studies, and human data from healthy volunteers, total serum IgM is 
expected to be suppressed to levels approximately below baseline .  
Most patients with s elective IgM deficiency 
are asymptomatic, but a few patients develop chronic and recurrent infections and increased risk of autoimmune diseases  (Yel, 
Ramanuja et al. 2009 , Louis and Gupta 2014, 
Louis, Agrawal et al. 2016, Janssen, Macken 
et al. 2018 ). Selective IgM deficiency is 
usually associated with other defects such as decreased T- helper cell activity, increased 
isotype specific suppressor T  cells, increased 
CD8 Treg cells, and intrinsic B  cell defects .  
VIS649 is not expected to have effects such  
as these on cellular immunity.  
Additional information can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  • Please see abo ve regarding Ig 
and AE data monitoring under DSMB review.  
Nonspecific immunosuppression risk  There is the possibility of nonspecific immunod eficiency with potential risk of 
exacerbation of pre -existing latent infection 
or poor response to new infection.  
Additional information can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  • Participants with acute or 
chronic infections at the time of screening are prohibited from enrollment.  
• Participants with underlying 
iatrogenic or primary immunodeficiency syndromes are pr ohibited from 
enrollment.  
• DSMB monitoring will include careful attention to infection -related AEs. 
• Concurrent treatment with systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive 
therapy is prohibited during 
study conduct.  
Infusion reactions (anaphylaxis, fever, chills, 
rigors, nausea, vomiting, pain, headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, 
hypotension, There were no SAEs  among participants in 
the Phase 1 VIS649 -101 study at dose levels 
up to 12 mg/kg.  
Severe infusion reactions such as anaphylaxis have not been observed with VIS649 in humans.  • All VIS649 doses will be 
administered at the clinical site by trained personnel, and 
participants will be closely monitored for the occurrence of infusion reactions.

2.3.2 Benefit Assessment  
Immunoglobulin A nephropathy is a chronic disease with periodic flares. IgAN is a significant 
cause of CK D and ESRD, the clinical progression varies, with 30 – 40% of patients reaching 
ESRD 20  to 30 years after the first clinical presentation  (Lai, Tang et al. 2016) . These patients 
have significantly increased mortality and morbidity, with life expectancy reduced by 6 to 10 years when compared to healthy individuals. ( Hastings, Bursac et al. 2017, Jarrick, Lundberg 
et al. 2019). There are currently no approved therapies for IgAN, and t he current treatment 
strategies consist of 2 main approaches : nonspecific supportive treatments consisting of BP  
control, treatment with ACEI/AR B, smoking cessation, lipid reduction, low- salt diet, or fish oil, 
and immunosuppressive therapies such as steroids, cyclophosphamide, or azathioprine. The 
immunosuppressive therapies are usually employed in patients with a high risk of progression, as characterized by proteinuria > 1.0 g/d and declining GFR ( Cheng, Zhang et al. 2009, Boyd, 
Cheung et al. 2012, KDIGO 2012 , Rad hakrishnan and Cattran 2012, Barbour and Feehally 2017, 
Rodrigues, Haas et al. 2017). R ecent trials have shown some benefit in proteinuria reduction 
with steroid s in these patients, thought they are at high risk for developing significant 
complications like infections, metabolic derangements, osteoporosis, and diabete s mellitus with 
these immunosuppressive agents, thus limiting the duration for which these drugs can be given to patients despite benefit from a renal perspective ( Pozzi, Andrulli et al. 2004 , Rauen , Eitner et al. 
CONFIDENTIAL  VIS649 -201 Protocol Version  4.0 
 
  
31 
 
 2015, Tesar, Troyanov et al. 2015, Lv, Zhang et al. 2017) . Hence, there is a critical need for a 
safe and specific treatment for IgAN.  
VIS649 has the potential to provide a significant advance ment  in the therapeutic approach to 
IgAN. It has a very specific mechanism of action in the form of APRIL inhibition, which plays a 
critical pathophysiological role in the production of a- g IgA 1 in patients with IgAN.  
VIS649 has an attractive safety profile based on currently available data, including data from the 
first-in-human  study (VIS649-101), in which no SAEs attributable to VIS649 were observed . It 
is anticipated that VIS649 will be used as chronic therapy and will significantly improve the 
outcomes in patients with IgAN when compared to intermittent therapies like steroids that are currently used to treat these patients. 
2.3.3 Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion  
Given the mechanism of action of VIS649 and data from a Phase 1 single-ascending dose study 
(VIS649-101) in healthy par ticipants , it is expected that participants receiving VIS649 will have 
a decline in Ig levels . To mitigate the risk of IgG reduction, serum IgG 
thresholds for enrollment have been established so as  to prevent the development of clinically 
signific ant hypogammaglobulinemia. In addition, studies in both healthy human participants  and 
nonhuman primates have demonstrated that the ability to develop an IgG response to novel antigens and recall T -cell dependent antigen challenge is not significantly impaired. As 
mentioned earlier, t here were no SAEs considered attributable to VIS649 in the Phase 1 
single-ascending dose study (VIS649-101), and in the nonhuman primate 6-month toxicology study, the no-adverse effect level for the antibody was the highest dos e evaluated .  
An independent data safety monitoring board ( DSMB ) for this study will be reviewing all 
available safety data, including unblinded Ig data and AEs  on a periodic and, as needed , on an ad  
hoc basis.  
Given these encouraging preliminary data and the precautions built into the protocol, evaluation 
of the potential benefit of VIS649 in slowing or halting CKD progression in IgAN participants  is 
warranted.

 4. STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 Overall Design  
This is a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, multiple -dose study 
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenously ( IV) administered VIS649 over a 12-month 
treatment course in participants with IgAN.  
Participants will be enrolled from approximately 10 0 global sit es in approximately 16 countries. 
Screening evaluations (including physical examinations, vital signs, 12- lead electrocardiogram 
[ECG ], safety laboratory testing [serum chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, serology, hemoglobin 
A1c, and pregnancy], blood sampling for baseline Ig levels  [IgA, IgG, and  IgM], and 24-hour 
urine collection ) will take place during the 30 day s prior to the first dose of study intervention.  
To be eligible, participants should be on stable and maximally tolerated doses of  either ACEI or 
ARB  therapy , as per standard of care (SOC) and applicable guidelines, for at least 3 months. 
Participants should optimally be on at least 50% of the maximum recommended dose of these 
agents; however, if a participant is on their maximally tole rated dose (and this is < 50% of the 
maximum recommended dose) and has been on this dose for at least 3 months, they may be 
enrolled. Participants who are unable to tolerate ACEI/ARB therapy may be eligible for 
participation in the study if their overall management of IgAN, including BP  control, is as per 
SOC and applicable guidelines. 
Participant  education regarding temporary cessation of ACEI s/ARBs during acute illness and 
resumption of these drugs after resolution of the acute illness will be as per local practice and 
SOC and this therapy will be  resumed at the dose closest to the level at the time of 
randomization. During the course of the study, the doses of ACEIs or ARBs should not change; 
however, minor changes are allowed depending on the clinical situation. Control of BP should be 
as per SOC and applicable guidelines. Additional antihypertensives can be used to control BP  as 
per the Investigator’s preference and local practi ce.  
Enrolled participants must be 18 years of age or older with an IgAN diagnosis confirmed by 
biopsy. 
It is anticipated that most biopsies resulting in a diagnosis of IgAN will have been interpreted 
using the MEST score –mesangial cellularity, endocapillary proliferation, segmental sclerosis, 
tubular atrophy ( Cattran et al, 2009) or MEST -Crescents ( C) scoring system ( Trimarchi, Barratt 
et al. 2017) from the Oxford classification of IgAN. Components of the MEST-C score include:  
• M – Mesangial hypercellularity, defined as more than 3 mesangial cells in any mesangial 
area of a glomerulus; a score of M0 indicates hypercellularity i n < 50% of glomeruli and 
a score of M1 is for hypercellularity noted in ≥ 50% of glomeruli. 
• E – Endocapillary proliferation, defined as hypercellularity due to an increased number of cells within glomerular capillary lumina causing narrowing. E0 represents absence of 
hypercellularity; E1 is hypercellularity in any glomeruli.  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  VIS649 -201 Protocol Version  4.0 
 
  
36 
 
 • S – Segmental glomerulosclerosis, defined as adhesion or sclerosis (obliteration of 
capillary lumina by matrix) in part of but not the whole glomerular tuft; S0 represents absence of segmental glomerulosclerosis ; S1 is presence of segmental glomeru losclerosis 
in any glomerulus. 
• T – Tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis, defined as the estimated percentage of cortical area showing tubular atrophy or interstitial fibrosis, whichever is gre ater; T0 is 0 -25%; 
T1 is 25-50%; T2 is > 50% atrophy/interstiti al fibrosis.  
• C – Crescents: C0 (no crescents), C1 (crescents in < 25% of glomeruli), and C2 (crescents in ≥ 25% of glomeruli). 
A MEST -C score finding on kidney biopsy of T2 or C2 is exclusionary for this study. If the 
biopsy was not reported using the Oxford classification schema, the following findings (corresponding to these Oxford classifications) are exclusionary: a) > 50% tubular atrophy and/or b) > 25% crescents.  
Eligible participants must have sufficient proteinuria  at screening , defined as urine protein to 
creatinine ratio (uPCR) ≥ 0.75 g/g or 24-hour urine protein ≥ 1.0 g/d, as measured from a 
24-hour urine collection (or an intended 24-hour urine collection).  Eligible participants must have an  eGFR ≥ 45 mL/min /1.73 m
2, calculated using the Chronic 
Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD- EPI) formula  (Levey, Stevens et al. 2009), 
before  dosing on Day 1. Participants with an eGFR ≥ 30 m L/min/1.73 m2 and < 45 mL /min/1.73 
m2 may also undergo screening, if they have undergone a kidney biopsy within 12 months of the 
date of initial screening and do not have ≥ 50% tubulo- interstitial fibrosis (T2 if using MEST -C 
score) or crescents in > 25% of glomeruli (C2 if using MEST- C score).   
Participa nts known to have chronic infectious diseases (eg , chronic sinusitis, chronic urinary 
tract infections, bronchiectasis) will be excluded. Pa rticipants  in countries with high prevalence 
of tuberculosis may undergo appropriate investigations such as chest X- ray or i nterferon  
gamma -release assay , as deemed appropriate by the Investigator, to rule out tuberculosis. 
Participants will be excluded from the study if they test positive for the screen ing serology 
markers listed in Table 8.  Participants with a positive  Hepatitis C virus (HCV)  antibody test must 
undergo testing for HCV RNA; if HCV RNA is undetectable, the pa rticipant can be included in 
the study. Participants with positive HbSAg and/or positive Anti HbC antibody will be excluded. Participants must be vaccinated as per respective national guidelines and other relevant 
guidelines. Participants should continue to receive annual influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine, as per local guidelines.  
The study will evalua te 3 dose levels of VIS649 (2, 4, and 8 mg/kg) versus placebo. A total of 
144 participants will be randomized with equal allocation (1:1:1:1) across the 4 intervention groups (approximately 36 participants per group). Randomization will be stratified first by 
region (Japan vs rest-of- world).  A target of 12 or more participants  are planned to be randomized 
in Japan; these participants will be randomized with equal allocation and without further 
stratification.  The randomization for the rest- of-world will be strat ified by screening uPCR 
(≤ 2.0 g/g vs > 2.0 g/g).

 VIS649 or placebo will be administered as 12 monthly IV infusions starting on Day 1/Month 0. 
Participants will return to the study center on Days 8 and  18, then monthly through Month 14 
and on Month 16 for safety, efficacy, PK , and/or PD assessments . Participants will be 
encouraged to follow the schedule of visits for their monthly infusions as close to the prescribed interval as possible. If under special c ircumstances, a participant  is unable to visit the study 
center within 7  days of the scheduled infusion, they will still be able to receive the infusion 
within the next 7 days, and this will be recorded as a protocol deviation. However, if there is any further delay, that dose should be skipped, and the participant should receive subsequent doses as per the schedule. The participant will not receive additional doses to make up for the missed 
dose(s).Safety assessments will include review of AEs (including hypersensitivity reaction and 
anaphylactic rea ction), physical examinations, injection site tolerability (pain, irritation , and 
tissue damage), clinical laboratory assessments (including biochemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and pregnancy testing), laboratory testing (including serum Ig levels and antidrug antibodies 
[ADAs] ), vital sign measurements, and use of concomitant medications. 
Participants will return to the study center on Month 16, 155 days following the last dose of 
study intervention (Dose 12) for an end-of-study (EOS)  visit, at which time  final safety, PK, PD, 
and efficacy assessments  will be performed . Participants discontinuing dosing prior to Dose 12 
will attend an early termination visit at the time of dosing discontinuation and will be encouraged 
to attend the study visits as per schedule of assessments ( Table 1).  
An independent DSMB will review safety data at regular intervals (see Section 9.6).  
A rollover, open- label extension study will be offered  to enable access to VIS649 (there will be 
no placebo arm) for study participants  who have completed this  trial, provided that th e 
Investigator believes that the participants  might benefit, and that  the site has agreed to  participate 
in the extension study. Further details will be provided in a separate protocol. 
The total study duration for each participant (from screening to EOS) will be up to 17 months 
(assuming up to 1 month for screening, 12 months for monthly doses [including 30 days after the 12
th dose], and follow-up visits  up to 155 days after the last dose of study intervention.  
In response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to prepare for possible 
quarantines, site closures, travel limitations  etc., Visterra , in consultation w ith clinical 
investigators and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/Independent Ethics Committees (IECs), 
may determine that the protection of a participant’s safety, welfare, and rights is best served by 
home health visits, telemedicine, or other remote sup port. Local regulations will be followed.  
4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
This study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple -dose study to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of IV administered VIS649 in  IgAN participant s over a 
12-month intervention course.  
Immunoglobulin A nephropathy is a chronic, slowly progressing disease. The underlying 
pathogenic factor in IgAN is the formation of a- g IgA 1, which is attributed to a culmination of 
genetic and envir onmental factors in susceptible individuals. The hypoglycosylated hinge region 
of a-g IgA 1 presents as a novel antigen, against which IgG and IgA autoantibodies may be 
CONFIDENTIAL  VIS649 -201 Protocol Version  4.0 
 
  
38 
 
 generated . This leads to formation of circulating IgG/a- g IgA 1 immune complexes that  are 
deposited (in part) in the mesangium of the glomerulus, inciting an inflammatory, nephritogenic 
response ( Boyd, Cheung et al. 2012, Mestecky, Raska et al. 2013, Lv, Zhang et al. 2017). This 
manifests clinically as  proteinuria, hematuria, and decline in eGFR.  High grade proteinuria 
(> 1.0 g/d) is a critical marker of progressive IgAN and remission of proteinuria is a crucial therapeutic target in the management of IgAN ( Donadio, Bergstralh et al. 2002, Reich, Troyanov 
et al. 2007, Nam, Kie et al. 2014, Inker, Mondal et al. 2016, Thompson, Carroll et al. 2019). 
VIS649 inhibits the biological actions of APRIL and reduces the levels of IgA , a-g IgA
1 and 
other Ig. In patients with IgAN, it is hypothesized that this reduction in APRIL and a- g IgA 1 will 
reduce the deposition of circulating immunocomplexes in the glomerulus. This should lead to cessation of ongoing renal damage and lead to recovery of the damaged glomeruli, as reflected by a reduction in proteinuria. 
Based on the PK/PD data from the Phase 1 single-ascending dose study (VIS649-101) and on 
simulation models, full therapeutic suppression of IgA through APRIL signaling inhibition will be achieved at 12 weeks, with the selected doses administered monthly. Considering the 
time-dependent and indirect effect of VIS649, a 12-month study intervention dur ation is deemed 
necessary to achieve therapeutic effect and assess for clinically relevant benefit of VIS649, as 
measured by reduction in proteinuria. 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the change from baseline in uPCR, at Month 12 (30 days 
after the 12
th dose of study intervention) , as measured from a 24 -hour urine collection. Studies 
have shown that in patients with IgAN, reduction of proteinuria leads to clinically relevant improvements like  reduction in the rate of decline of eGFR and progression to ESRD .  
In an analysis of data from the Toronto Glomerulonephritis Registry of 542 patients followed for a mean of 6.5 years (61% males, 50% whites, 23% Asians, with mean initial proteinuria 2.4 g/d 
and creatinine clearance of 77 m L/min/1.73 m
2), time -averaged proteinuria ( defined as an 
average of the mean of  the proteinuria measurements for every 6 -month period) was the most 
important predictor of kidney function decline and risk of ESRD, independently of BP and use of renin -angiotensin blockers. If time -averaged proteinuria was maintained < 1 g/d, the 10- year risk 
of ES RD was 5%, versus 20% with a time -averaged proteinuria of 1 –2 g/d, 40% with a 
time-averaged proteinuria of 2  to 3 g/d, and 60% with > 3 g/d ( Reich, Troyanov et al. 2007). 
This study highlights the primary importance of proteinuria reduction as a therapeutic target in 
the management of IgAN.  
A comprehensive series of safety evaluations, including review  of AEs (including 
hypersensitivity reaction and anaphylactic reaction), physical examinations, injection site 
tolerability (pain, irritation , and tissue damage), clinical laboratory assessments (including 
biochemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and pregnanc y testing ), laboratory testing (including 
serum I g levels  and ADA s), vital sign measurements, and use of concomitant medications will be 
conducted to evaluate the safety profile of VIS649. 
It is expected that VIS649 will result in obvious reductions in ser um IgA, IgG , and IgM, which, 
if visible to the site or Sponsor, would effectively unblind treatment. Therefore, unblinded Ig 
data will only be available to designated unblinded personnel.

 The results of VIS649-101 and PK/PD model simulations and the safety coverage from the 
6-month toxicology study all support the planned dosing strategy for the current study.  
4.4 End-of-study Definition  
A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed the intervention period and EOS visit.  
The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study.

 5. STUDY POPULATION  
Prospective approval of protocol deviations to enrollment criteria, also known as protocol 
waivers or exemptions, is not permitted. Rescreening is permitted  if a previous participant was a 
Screen Fail under Protocol Version 3.0. The medical monitor must be consulted prior to 
rescreening.  Rescreening  or retesting  may also be permitted  due to issues arising during 
shipping/storage/handling/ collection/processing of samples. Rescreening of a participant may 
also be permitted if initial participation in the study was precluded due to an acute infection or an acute illness  that subsequently resolved completely,  and the participant then is able to fulfill all 
study eligibility criteria . 
5.1 Inclusion Criteria  
Participants are eligible to be included in the stud y only if all of the following criteria apply:

3. Participant  has m edical  records showing they have been on stable and maximally 
tolerated doses of either ACEI or ARB, as per local SOC and applicable guidelines, for at 
least 3 months preceding screening . Participants should optimally be on at least 50% of 
the maximum recommende d dose of these agents; however, if a participant is on their 
maximally tolerated dose (and this is < 50% of the maximum recommended dose) and 
has been on this dose for at least 3 months, they may be enrolled.  Participants who are 
unable to tolerate ACEI/ARB therapy may be eligible for participation in the study if 
their overall management of IgAN, including BP control, is as per local SOC and applicable guidelines. 
4. Participant has  screening uPCR ≥ 0.75 g/g meas ured from a  24-hour urine (or an intended 
24-hour urine sample) or 24-hour urine protein ≥ 1.0 g/d, as measured from 24 -hour urine 
collection  (or an intended 24-hour urine sample ).  
• The proteinuria should be assessed  when the participant is considered to be in a 
steady state with no recent heavy exercise, fever, or other potential issues that 
could impact the result.  Re-testing may be allowed if it is determined  that the  
participant was not in steady state after consultation with the medical monitor.  
5. Participant has  eGFR  ≥ 45 mL/min /1.73 m
2, calculated using the CKD- EPI formula.  
• Retesting may be allowed if it is determined that the participant was not in steady 
state after consultation with the medical monitor.  
• Participants with eGFR ≥ 30 mL /min/1.73 m2 and < 45 mL /min/1.73 m2 may also  
undergo screening, if they have undergone a kidney biopsy within 12 months of the date of initial screeni ng and do not have ≥ 50% tubulo- inters titial fibrosis (T2 
if using MEST- C score) or crescents in > 25% of glomeruli (C2 if using MEST- C 
score) .The eGFR should be measured when the participant is considered to be in a 
steady state without recent changes in volume status, medications that could 
CONFIDENTIAL  VIS649 -201 Protocol Version  4.0 
42 impact the result (eg , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [ NSAIDs ], 
aminoglycosides, co-trimoxaz ole), or changes in dietary protein intake.

study. 
26. Participant is  unable to comply with study protocol procedures and/or study visit 
schedules.  
27. Participant wit h known or suspected alcohol or drug abuse that would compromise the ir 
safety or study participation, in the opinion of the Investigator. 
5.3 Lifestyle Considerations  
Lifestyle recomm endations applicable to IgAN patients such as, but not limited to, BP control, 
low-salt diet, low- protein diet,  smoking cessation, weight reduction, and avoidance of 
nephrotoxic drugs (eg, NSAIDs ) will be followed as per local practice and guidelines.  
5.4 Screen Failures 
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but are 
not subsequently entered into  the study. A minimal set of screen failure information is required 
to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the Consolidated Standards 
of Reporting Trials publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory 
authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any SAE.

 6. STUDY  INTERVENTION  
Study intervention is defined as any investigational intervention(s), marketed product(s), 
placebo , or medical device(s) intended to be administered to a study participant according to the 
study protocol. 
6.1 Study Intervention(s) Administered  
The study interventions to be administered under this protocol are detailed in Table 4. 
VIS649 is for investigational use only and should only be used within the context of this study.  
VIS649 will be administered as a mg/kg dosage determined by dose assigned at time of 
randomization. VIS649 will be administered IV over 1 hour*, in a single, final volume of 100-mL infusion in normal saline (0.9% NaCl), followed by a 25-mL saline flush. The dose of study intervention wi ll be based on the Month 0 predose weight. 
Placebo (0.9% NaCl) will be administered IV over 1 hour* as a single 100 mL infusion, followed by a 25- mL saline flush.  
Infusions should preferentially be administered to the participant’s dominant arm.

 Abbreviations: IM P = investigational medicinal product; IV = intravenous(ly); N/A = not applicable; NIMP = noninvestigational 
medicinal product.  * Occasionally pre-filled saline bags have some additional fluid as overage, in such scenarios dispense the 
entire contents of t he bag during the infusion (may be over  60 minutes) . 
6.2 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability  
The required amount of VIS649 to be dosed will be diluted in normal saline up to a maximum 
total volume of 100 mL; for placebo participants, 100 mL of normal s aline will be prepared. The 
length of the IV line will be set to a maximum volume of 25 mL, so that the 25- mL saline flush 
following administration will ensure all VIS649/placebo has been administered. 
The VIS649/placebo infusion will be administered IV using a 0.20- or 0.22- µm in -line filter a nd 
will be controlled by a volumetric pump. Standard, uniform-length infusion lines will be used. 
In addition:  
1. The Investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained for study intervention during transit to and storage in the investigational 
pharmacy. Any deviations from Pharmacy Manual guidance are to be reported and resolved before use of the study intervention. 
2. Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study inter vention and only 
authorized site staff may supply and administer study intervention. All study intervention 
must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or 
automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions , with access limited to 
the Investigator and authorized site staff.  
3. The Investigator, institution, or head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance 
(ie, receip t, reconciliation, and final disposition records).  
4. Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study interventions are provided in the Study Reference Manual.  
6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding  
This study is double -blinded. An unblinded pharmacist (or other unblinded designee)  will 
prepare study intervention doses for infusion. Participants, the Sponsor, the Investigator, and all other site study staff will be blinded to study intervention.  
All eligible participa nts will be centrally assigned to randomized study intervention using an 
Interactive Voice/Web Response System (IVRS/IWRS). Before the study is initiated, the 
telephone number and call-in directions for the IVRS and/or the log-in information and 
directions for the IWRS will be provided to each site.  
Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio to receive VIS649 at 2, 4, or 
8 mg/kg or placebo, with approximately 36 participants randomized to each intervention group. 
Randomization will be stratified first by region (Japan vs rest of world). A target of 12 or more  participants are planned to be randomized at Japanese sites. Japanese participants will be 
CONFIDENTIAL  VIS649 -201 Protocol Version  4.0 
 
  
47 
 
 randomized with equal allocation and without further stratification. Randomization for the rest  of 
world will then be stratified by screening uPCR ( ≤ 2.0 g/g vs > 2.0 g/g).  
Each assignment will have a unique randomization number, assigned to eligible participants after 
the screening. Once a randomization number has been assigned via the I VRS/IWRS, it may not 
be reassigned.  
In case of an emergency, the Investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participants’ intervention assignment is war ranted. Participant safety must 
always be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the Investigator decides that 
unblinding is required for participant safety , the Investigator should make every effort to contact 
the Sponsor prior to unblinding a participant’s intervention assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the participant. If a participant’s intervention assignment is unblinded, the Sponsor must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind. The date and reason that 
the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation and electronic case report 
form (eCRF), as applicable.  
Local laboratory testing such as Ig concentrations, albumin :globulin ratio ( often tested as part of 
routine liver function panel), or serum protein electrophoresis may reveal obvious reduction in the total globulin levels in participants  receiving study intervention and could  effectively unblind 
the participant . Performing  such investigations is  prohibited, unless this has been discussed with 
the Sponsor and such  investigation s have been  deemed neces sary for clinical mana gement of the 
participant . 
6.4 Study Intervention Compliance  
Preparation of individual doses of study intervention will be verified  by a second (unblinded) 
member of the study site pharmacy staff.  
Participants will receive study interven tion at the study center directly from the Investigator or 
designee under medical supervision. The date and time of each dose administered in the clinic 
will be recorded in  the source documents and eCRF . The dose of study intervention and study 
participant  identification will be confirmed at the time of dosing by a member of the study site 
staff other than the person administering the study intervention.  
6.5 Concomitant Therapy  
Any medication or vaccine (including over- the-counter and prescription medicines, vitamins, 
herbal supplements, fish oil , and NSAIDs ) that the participant is receiving at the time of 
enrollment or receives during the study must be recorded along with the following: 
• Reason for use 
• Dates of administration , including start and end dates 
• Dosage information, including dose and frequency 
The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are any questions regarding concomitant or 
prior therapy. 
CONFIDENTIAL  VIS649 -201 Protocol Version  4.0 
 
  
48 
 
 6.5.1 Concomitant Therapy to be Avoided 
Participants should avoid using drugs that are contraindicated in IgAN (eg, NSAIDs, 
aminoglycosides, co -trimoxazole) during the study, per local practice. 
During conduct of the study, administration of systemic corticoster oids or other 
immunosuppressive therapy (for IgAN or other conditions) is prohibited due to the risk of over 
immune suppression due to overlapping actions of VIS649 and other immunosuppressive agents. If the Investigator believes that treatment  with such therapy is required, and the potential benefits 
outweigh the possible risks, t he Medical Monitor must be notified, as continued dosing with 
study intervention may, in this circumstance, be discontinued.  
6.6 Dosing  Schedule Modification  
Participants will be enc ouraged to follow the schedule of visits for their monthly infusions as 
close to the prescribed interva l as possible. If under special circumstances, a participant is unable 
to visit the study center within 7 days of the scheduled infusion, they will still be able to receive the infusion within the next 7 days, and this will be recorded as a protocol deviation. However, if 
there is any further delay, that dose should be skipped, and the participant should receive 
subsequent doses as per the schedule. The participant will not receive additional doses to make up for the missed dose (s). 
There will be no other a lteration s from the dosing schedule outlined in Section 6.1.  
6.7 Intervention after the End of the Study  
A rollover, open- label extension study will be offered  to enable access to VIS649 (there will be 
no placebo ar m) for study participants  who have completed this  trial, provided that  the 
Investigator believes  that the participants  might benefit, and that the site has agreed to  participate 
in the extension study. Further details will be provided in a separate protocol.

 7. DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND 
PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WIT HDRAWAL  
7.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention Dosing  
Participants have the right to discontinue study intervention or withdraw from the study at any 
time for any reason. Participants may withdraw or be withdrawn from study- related procedures 
and intervention for the following reasons: 
• Withdrawal of consent 
• Adverse event  
• Protocol deviation 
• Investigator decision 
• Pregnancy ( Appendix 4) 
• Sponsor decis ion to terminate the study  
• Lost to follow-up 
In particular, study intervention should be discontinued if participants experience the following:  
• Grade ≥ 3 infusion reaction such as severe anaphylaxis or cytokine release syndrome 
• At the discretion of the Investigator, study intervention may be stopped if the participant has an unexplained decline in  eGFR of > 30% sustained over 3 months that is not 
revers ed after correction of all reversible factors such as volume depletion, NSAID, 
ACEI/ARB , other nephrotoxic drug use, or resolution of acute illness or infection. 
Adverse events that are ongoing at the EOS should be monitored until resolution, stabilization, 
until the event is otherwise explained, the participant is lost to follow -up, or 30 days after EOS.  
Serious AEs that are ongoing at the EOS should be monitored until resolution, stabilization, until 
the event is otherwise explained, the participant is lost to follow-up, or 30 days after EOS, 
whichever is longer (Section 8.3.1). If the participant withdraws because of an AE, every effort must be made to perform protocol- specified safety follow -up procedures. 
If study intervention dosing is definitively discontinued, participants are encouraged to continue with assessments as per the s chedule of assessments. At a minimum, if study participation is 
terminated by the participant or Investigator, the participant should complete all early 
termination assessments and will be encouraged to return for the EOS assessments outlined in Table 1. The primary reason for discontinuation should be recorded in the appropriate section of the eCRF.  
7.1.1 Temporary Discontinuation 
Study intervention may be interrupted for up to 2 doses in participants who experience the 
following:  
• Severe or intractable in fection  
• Acute severe illness or injury requiring hospitalization 
CONFIDENTIAL  VIS649 -201 Protocol Version  4.0 
 
  
50 
 
 7.1.2 Rechallenge  
VIS649 doses may be re-initiated (at the same dose) under the following conditions: 
• If study intervention was interrupted due to acute illness or infection, study intervention 
can be re- initiated if the participant has recovered from the acute illness or infection, as 
deter mined by the Investigator. 
7.2 Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, or 
administrative reasons. This is expected to be uncommon. 
At the time of discontinuing from the study, if possible, the participant should complete al l early 
termination ( ET) assessments outlined in Table 1. The participant will be encouraged to attend 
an EOS visit 155 days following the last dose of study intervention. The participant will be 
permanently discontinued both from the study intervention and from the study at that time.  
If the participant withd raws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken 
and not tested, and the Investigator must document this in the site study records. 
7.3 Lost to Follow -up 
A participant  will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. 
The f ollowing actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit: 
• The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule. The site also should ascertain whether or not  the participant wishes to and/or 
should continue in the study. 
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator or designee must make every effort to r egain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, 
if necessar y, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s 
medic al record.  
• Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study.  
• The participant, if reached, should be invited to attend EOS visit s, which can also be done 
via phone call, medical record review, et c. if the participant is unwilling to visit the 
clinic.  
Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study as a whole are handled as part of Appendix 1.

 8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
Study procedures and their tim ing are outlined in Table 1. Protocol waivers or exemptions are 
not allowed. 
Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon occurrence 
or awareness to determine if the participant sh ould continue or discontinue study intervention. 
Adherence to the study design requirements is essential for study conduct. 
All screening  evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants 
meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all 
participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as 
applicable.   
Repeat or unscheduled sam ples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issu es with the 
samples.  
8.1 Efficacy Assessments 
8.1.1 Twenty -four-hour Urine Sample Collection  
Twenty -four-hour urine collection for derivation of 24-hour urine volume, protein, albumin, 
creatinine, uPCR, and u ACR will be performed at the time points outlined in Table 1.  
Participants will discard the first morning void and begin a 24-hour urine collection the day prior 
to the clinic visit. Care should be taken to avoid over-collection or under-collection of urine, 
however, if t his occurs, the sample may still be used to calculate the proteinuria and uPCR. On 
days of 24-hour urine collection (or the intended 24-hour urine collection) , the uPCR sample will 
be collected from the 24 -hour urine collection and routine urinalysis will be performed on a 
sample freshly voided during the clinic visit. 
8.2 Safety Assessments  
8.2.1 Physic al Examinations 
A complete physical examination, including assessments of the cardiovascular, respiratory, 
gastrointestinal, and neurological systems will be complete d at the screening, at the 
Month 12/ ET visit, and at the Month 16/EOS visit. In addition, physical examinations may be 
conducted at any other time if considered clinically indicated by the Investigator. 
8.2.2 Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements will be performed  at the visits outlined in Table 1 and will include 
weight, temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and systolic and diastolic BP . Height will be 
measured and recorded  during s creening .  
Vital signs measurements on dosing days will be recorded within 15 (±5) minutes prior to the 
start of the infusion, every 15 minutes until the infusion is complete, and postinfusion at 60 (±10) minutes and 2 hours. 
CONFIDENTIAL  VIS649 -201 Protocol Version  4.0 
 
  
52 
 
 Systolic and diastolic BP  and pulse measurements will be assessed while the participant  is seated 
or supine with a completely automated device. Manual techniques will be used only if an 
automated device is not available. Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be preceded 
by at least 5 minut es of rest for the partic ipant in a quiet setting without distractions ( no 
television, cell phone , etc). 
Whenever possible, vital signs should be collected before blood collection for laboratory tests 
and before dosing with study intervention. 
8.2.3 Electrocardi ograms 
A single 12- lead E CG, heart rate, and measures of PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals will be 
obtained at the screening visit. Twelve- lead ECGs should also be conducted at other times during 
the study if considered clinically indicated by the Investigator. 
Twelve- lead ECG s should be conducted after 5 minutes in recumbence or semi- recumbency.  
8.2.4 Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments 
Clinical laboratory evaluations for safety will be performed by a central laboratory whenever 
possible, however, local laboratory tests may be utilized  for more urgent safety monitoring. 
Before starting the study, the Investigator will provide the Sponsor (or its designee) copies of all 
laboratory certifications and normal ranges for all laboratory assessments to be performed by that 
laboratory. Local laboratory assessments to make intervention- related decisions may be 
performed at all visits.  
A list of clinical safety laboratory tests to be performed is provided in Appendix 2 and the timing for these assessments i s provided in Table 1. All protocol-required laboratory assessments must 
be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual. Details of laboratory tests to be 
conducted for assessment of VIS649 PK, PD, exploratory biomarkers, and immunogenicity are provided in Sections 8.5, 8.6, 8.8, and 8.9, respectively.  
The Investigat or must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the eCRF. The 
laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory findings are those that are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the Investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. 
All laboratory tests with values considere d clinically significantly abno rmal, with the exception 
of disease defining abnormalities such as eGFR and proteinuria considered to be a part of the 
natural history of IgAN, during the study or within 30 days after the last dose of study 
intervention should be repeated until the values return to normal, baseline, or are no longer 
considered clinically significant by the Investigator or medical monitor. 
If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable by the 
Investig ator, the etiology should be identified and the Sponsor notified. 
CONFIDENTIAL  VIS649 -201 Protocol Version  4.0 
 
  
53 
 
 8.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse event and SAE definitions are provided in Appendix 3. 
All AEs  (serious and nonserious) reported by the participant must be recorded on the source 
documents and eCRF provided by the Sponsor. Medical terminology should be used for AE 
reporting. Adverse events should be reported as a single unifying diagnosis whenever possible 
or, in the absence of a unifying diagnosis, as individual signs or symptoms. 
The Investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following 
up AEs that are seri ous, considered related to the study intervention or study procedures, or that 
caused the participant to discontinue the study intervention (see Section 7).  
8.3.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event  and Serious Adverse 
Event Information 
Adverse events that are ongoing at the EOS should be monitored until resolution, stabilization, until the event is otherwise explained, the participant is lost to follow -up, or 30 days after EOS.  
Serious AEs that are ongoing at the EOS should be monitored until resolution, stabilization, until 
the event is otherwise explained, the participant is lost to follow -up, or 30 days after EOS, 
whichever is longer ( see Section 1.3).  
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study intervention but after obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions section of the 
eCRF, not the AE section. 
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately and under no 
circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 3. The I nvestigator will 
submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it being a vailable.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek information about AEs or SAEs after conclusion of study participation. However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any 
time after a participant has been discharged from th e study, and he/she considers the event to be 
reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor. 
8.3.2 Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures 
for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3. 
Care will be taken not to  introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrences. For example, participants should be asked the nonleading question: “How have 
you felt s ince your last visit?”  
Exacerbation or disease progression  should be reported as an AE only if there are unusual or 
severe clinical features that were not present, or experienced earlier, or not expected based on the course of the condition. 
CONFIDENTIAL  VIS649 -201 Protocol Version  4.0 
 
  
54 
 
 In addition, the Sponsor must be notified immediately by telephone, fax, or e-mail of any 
immediately reportable events. Immediately reportable events (IRE) include the following:  
• SAEs  
• Pregnancies. Although normal pregnancy is not an AE, it will mandate study intervention 
discontinuation and must be reported on an IRE form and the Pregnancy Surveillance Form(s) to the Sponsor. Pregnancy will only be documented on the AE eCRF if there is 
an abnormality or complication. This includes pregnancy of the participant or the 
participant’s partner 
Adverse event, start date, end date, seriousness, severity, relationship to study intervention, 
action taken with study treatment, and outcome will be recorded on the source documents and in 
the eCRF. Special attention should be paid to recording hospitalization and concomitant medicati ons. 
8.3.3 Follow- up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Nonserious AEs that are identified at any time during the study must be recorded on the AE eCRF with the current status (ongoing or resolved/recovered) noted. All nonserious events (that are not I REs) that are ongoing at the last scheduled contact will be recorded as ongoing on the 
eCRF. For any AE having been identified throughout the study, additional relevant medical history information may be requested by the Sponsor during analysis to further ascertain causality (including, but not limited to, information such as risk-related behavior, family history, and occupation). 
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contac ts. All AEs and SAEs will be collected from the signing of 
the informed consent form ( ICF) until the EOS . Adverse events that ar e ongoing at the EOS 
should be monitored until resolution, stabilization, until the event is otherwise explained, the 
participan t is lost to follow -up, or 30 days after EOS. Serious AEs that are ongoing at the EOS 
should be monitored until resolution, stabilization, until the event is otherwise explained, the participant is lost to follow -up, or 30 days after EOS, whichever is longer (see Section 1.3).   
Resolution means that the participant has returned to the baseline state of health and stabilized 
means that the Investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the 
participant’s condition. The Investigator will continue to report any significant follow-up 
information to the Sponsor up to the point the event has resolved or stabilized, or the participant is lost to follow -up or has died. 
Further information on follow-up procedures is provided in Ap pendix 3. 
8.3.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events  
Prompt notification by the Investigator to the Sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilitie s towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
CONFIDENTIAL  VIS649 -201 Protocol Version  4.0 
 
  
55 
 
 Sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to 
the regulatory authority, IRB/IEC , and Investigators. 
Investigator safety reports must be prepa red for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to Investigators as necessary.  
An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing a SAE or other s pecific 
safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
8.3.5 Pregnancy  
Details  of all pregnancies in female pa rticipants and female partners of male participants  will be 
collected after the start of study intervention and until 155 days after the last dose of study intervention. 
If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 4. 
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs. 
8.4 Treatment of Overdose  
Standard symptomatic support measures should be used in the case of excessive pharmacological effects or overdose. No antidotes are available.  
8.5 Pharmacokinetics  
For all participants, serial blood samples will be drawn prior to each VIS649/placebo IV infusion and at the end of each infusion in order to determine circulating serum concentrations of VIS649, as specified in Table 1 and  Table 5. Up to 60 participants (approximately 15 participants in each 
cohort) may have a more in tensive PK and PD sampling schedule, as described in Table 5. Study 
participants who agree to participate in this more intensive PK and PD sample collection sub-study will sign an additional informed conse nt for this activity.  
Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided by the Sponsor in a separate laboratory manual. The actual  date and time (24 -hour clock time) of each 
sample will be recorded.  
Samples collected for analyses of serum VIS649 concentration s may also be used to evaluate 
safety or efficacy aspects related to concerns arising during or after the study. 
Drug concentration information that may unblind the study will not be reported to investigative 
sites or blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded.

 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 Statistical Hypothesis  
The primary efficacy objective of this study is to evalua te the effect  of VIS649 on proteinuria. 
The hypothesis that there is a VIS649-related dose response in the change from baseline in 
natural log uPCR at Month 12 versus placebo will be formally tested .   
9.2 Sample Size Determination  
The sample size for this stu dy was calculated assuming a linear dose response in reduction of 
uPCR in placebo and  VIS649 2, 4, and 8 mg/kg dose levels of 0%, 15%, 30%, and 45%, 
respectively. Applying contrasts of -3, -1, 1, and 3 for the corresponding dose levels and analyzing uPCR on the natural log scale, the result is an expected mean change from baseline of 0, -0.163, -0.357, and -0.593 for placebo and VIS649 dose levels of 2, 4, and 8 mg/kg, 
respectively.   Using an analysis of variance model with contr asts of -3, - 1, 1, and 3 for the 
corresponding dose levels, a standard deviation of 0.87, 80% power, a 2-sided type I error rate of 
0.05, and accounting for a dropout rate of ~ 20%, the required sample size is 36 participants per group, or 144 participants overall.    
9.3 Populations for Analyses  
Populations for analysis in this study are defined in Table 6. 
Table 6: Populations for Analysis 
Population  Description  
ITT All participants who are randomized . Participants will be categorized by the 
intervention and dose they were randomized to receive.  
mITT  All randomized participants who receive at least 1 dose of study intervention. 
Participants will be categorized by the intervention and dose that they were 
randomized to rece ive. 
Safety  All randomized participants who receive any amount of study intervention. 
Participants will be analyzed according to the intervention and dose they actually 
received.  
PK/PD  All randomized participants who have at least 1 set of postdose PK/PD  measures 
taken.  
Biomarker  All randomized participants who consented to participation in the biomarker 
substudy. A separate consent process is required, as described in Section 8.8. 
Abbreviations: ITT = intent -to-treat; mITT = modified intent -to-treat; PD  = pharmacodynamic(s); 
PK = pharmacokinetic(s).  
Analysis of safety parameters will be performed on the Safety population. The modified 
intent- to-treat ( mITT ) population will be the primary population for assessm ent of efficacy. The 
PK/PD population will be the primary population for PK/PD summaries. Analysis of biomarker data will be performed on the Biomarker population.

 methods. If appropriate, continuous independent variables w ill be evaluated a s such and as 
categorical variables with participants grouped by exposure categories. Additionally, population 
PK/PD modeling and simulation may be utilized to measure the dynamic relationship between drug concentration, drug effect, and drug safety. 
9.4.7.2 Antid rug Antibodies  
Presence vs absence of anti -VIS649 antibodies, anti-VIS649 antibody titers (including 
neutralizing antibody titers, if available), will be summarized by intervention group and time 
point using descriptive statistics.  
9.5 Interi m Analyses  
In addi tion to 5 DSMB safety reviews ( Section 9.6), 3 interim PK/ Ig analyses and 2 interim 
efficacy analys es (completed to inform future study design) are planned : 
• Three PK/Ig analys es will be performed ; each will be conducted in parallel with a key 
milestone event ( DSMB meetings, early interim analysis , or the formal interim analysis ).  
APRIL  levels may also be analyzed along with PK and Ig. Anti -drug antibody may be 
assessed  if warranted based on the PK data. These  PK/Ig assessment s will be performed 
by a separate, unblinded team which will include g roup-unblinded PK/Ig summaries 
(with individual participant treatment blinded) . Summarized results will be made 
available to  the Sponsor to inform future study design. Th ese analys es may  be used to 
update a previously developed population PK/PD model. 
• An early interim efficacy analysis may be  performed when at least 16 participants have 
been treated for at least 2 months , optimally when at least 50% of the 16 (or more) 
partic ipants have achieved > 30% reduction in uPCR based on review of blinded uPCR 
data across all study participants. Blinded uPCR monitoring will be conducted to 
determine the timing of this early interim efficacy analysis.  Monitoring will include 
plotting blinded uPCR data over time per participant.  The interim analysis will present 
group-unblinded efficacy summaries (with individual participant treatment blinded) and will be prepared by a separate, unblinded team for Sponsor review to inform future study design.  
• A second interim efficacy analysis will be performed at the time of the fourth scheduled DSMB meeting ( once 50% of randomized participants have completed 6 months of study 
dosing and approximately 20 participants have completed 12 months of study dosing). Group-unblinded efficacy summaries (with individual participant treatment blinded) will be prepared for Sponsor review to inform future study design.  
• The interim efficacy analyses will not include hypothesis testing and will be for the 
purpose of future study design and planning. The primary ef ficacy endpoint, change in 
proteinuria levels from baseline, will be analyzed.  No modifications to this  study protocol 
are planned based on results of the interim analyses.  Nonetheless, to account for multiple 
reviews of the efficacy endpoint, the type I error rate applied at the end of the study will 
be reduced by 0.002 for each interim efficacy review, resulting in a 2- sided end -of-study 
type I error rate of 0.046.

The tests detailed in Table 8 will be performed by the central laboratory. 
Local laboratory results are only required in the event that the central laboratory results are not 
available in time for either study intervention  administration and/or response eva luation. If a 
local sample is required, it is important that the sample for central analysis is obtained at the 
same time.  Additionally, if the local laboratory results are used to make either a study 
intervention decision or response evaluation, the results must be entered into the eCRF. Local 
laboratory  results will not be acceptable for qualifying a participant for t he study (except for the 
urine dipstick and microscopy). 
Additional tests may be performed at any time during the study as determined necessary by the 
Investigator or required by local regulations.

If fertility is unclear (eg, amenor rhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be 
confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be considered. 
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP: 
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal female wi th 1 of the following: 
• Documented hysterectomy  
• Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
• Documented bilateral oophorectomy 
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above (eg, mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), Investigator discretion should be applied to determining study entry. 
Note: Documentation can come from site personnel review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview. 
3. Postmenopausal female  
• A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause.  
o A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range 
may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with more than one FSH measurement is required.  
o Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the nonestrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods 
if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must 
discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.  
10.4.2 Contraception Guidance  
Women of childbearing potent ial must use highly effective methods of contraception for at least 
28 days prior to first study intervention through 155 days after the last dose of study intervention. 
CONFIDENTIAL  VIS649 -201 Protocol Version  4.0

 Highly effective methods of contraception are defined as methods that can achieve a fa ilure rate 
of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly, and include:  
• combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation:  
o oral 
o intravaginal  
o transdermal  
• progestogen-only hormona l contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: 
o oral  
o injectable  
o implantable   
• intrauterine device   
• intrauterine hormone- releasing system    
• bilateral tubal occlusion  
• vasectomi zed partner ; note: a vasectomized partner is a highly effective birt h control 
method provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP study participant and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success  
• sexual abstinence; sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraini ng from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk 
associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be 
evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial a nd the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the participan t  
Women of childbearing potential must also have a negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( β-hCG) pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine β -hCG pregnancy test 
prior to the first stud y intervention on Day 1. Female particip ants must also agree not to donate 
eggs/bank eggs for the duration of their participation in the study. 
Male participants and/or his partner must use a n acceptable form of contraception (ie, 
double- barrier, have had a vasectomy, or have a female partner of nonchildbearing potential) 
from date of first study dose through 155 days after the last dose of study intervention. Following 
the first dose of study intervention, male participants must also agree to not donate sperm 
through 155 days after the last dose of study intervention. 
10.4.3 Collection of Pregnancy Information 
Male participants with partners who become pregnant  
CONFIDENTIAL  VIS649 -201 Protocol Version  4.0 
 
  
75 
 
 • The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male 
participant’s female partner who becomes pregnant while the male participant is in 
this study. This applies only to male participants who receive study intervention. 
• After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner directly, the I nvestigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate 
form and submit it to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s 
pregnancy. The female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, the follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the 
estimated delivery date. Any ter mination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless 
of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
Female p articipants who become pregnant  
• The Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female participant who 
becomes pregnant while participating in this study. The initial information will be 
recorded o n the appropriate form and submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
learning of a participant’s pregnancy.  
• The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The Investigator will collect follow -up information on the participant and the neonate and 
the information will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, follow-up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication o r elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be 
reported as an AE or SAE.  
• A spontaneous abortion (occurring at < 22 weeks gestational age) or still birth (occurring at > 22 weeks gestational age) is always considered to be an SAE and wil l 
be reported as such.  
• Any poststudy pregnancy related SAE considered reasonably related to the study intervention by the Investigator will be reported to the Sponsor as described in 
Section 8.3.4. While the Investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information 
in former study participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous 
reporting. 
• Any female participant who becomes preg nant while participating in the study will 
discontinue study intervention.

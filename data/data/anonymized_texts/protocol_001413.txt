ABSTRACT   
Wee1 is a tyrosine kinase that is activated in response to DNA damage and plays a role in chemo -resistance 
and tolerance of oncogene induced cellular stress. The Wee1 inhibitor, AZD1775 ( MK-1775 ), was 
developed to overcome this checkpoint and rend er cells more sensitive to chemotherapy, and may be more 
effective in tumors with high levels of the MYC or MYCN oncogene.  In the phase 1 portion of this study 
(Part A), patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors including CNS tumors will receive the Wee1 
inhibitor AZD1775 (MK -1775)  in combination with irinotecan. Both agents will be administered orally on 
days 1 -5 of a 21 -day cycle with a step -wise inter -patient dose escalation of AZD1775 (MK -1775) .  Patients 
will be accrued to dose levels using a  3+3 design. Toxicity will be graded according to the CTCAE v 5.0 
and response will be assessed by RECIST criteria. There will be analysis of AZD1775 (MK -1775)  
pharmacokinetics and the mechanism -based biomarker of AZD1775 (MK -1775)  induced replication 
checkpoint over-ride. Analysis of Wee1  signaling and MYC and MYCN levels will be performed from 
archival tumor tissue in patients  with available tissue  and from  bone marrow in consenting patients with 
bone marrow involvement.  Once the recommended phase 2 dose of AZD1775 (MK -1775)  in combination 
with irinotecan is determined, there will be a phase 2 expansion for patients with refractory or recurrent 
neuroblastoma (Part B) for patients with  refractory or recurrent  medulloblastoma/CNS PNET (Part C)  and 
for patien ts with  relapsed or refractory  rhabdomyosarcoma (Part D) .

1.0 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES (SCIENTIFIC AIMS)  
 
1.1 Primary Aims   
1.1.1 To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 
dose of AZD1775 (MK -1775)  administered  on days 1 through 5  every 21 days , 
in combination with oral irinotecan, to children with recurrent or refractory solid  
tumors . 
 
1.1.2 To define and describe the toxicities of  AZD1775 (MK -1775)  in combination 
with oral irinotecan  administered on this schedule.  
 
1.1.3 To characterize the pharmacokinetics of  AZD1775 (MK -1775)  in children with 
refractory cancer.  
 
1.2 Secondary Aims   
1.2.1 To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of AZD1775 (MK -1775)  and 
irinotecan  within the confines of a Phase 1 study.  
 
1.2.2 To obtain initial Phase 2 efficacy data on the anti -tumor activity of AZD1775 
(MK -1775)  in combination with irinotecan administered to children with 
relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma , in children with  relapsed o r refractory  
medulloblastoma/CNS PNET (central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal 
tumor)  and in children with relapsed or refractory rhabdomyosarcoma.  
 
1.2.3 To investigate checkpoint over-ride by AZD1775 (MK -1775)  via the 
mechanism -based pharmacodynamic ( PD) biomarker of decreased CDK1 
phosphorylation  in correlative and exploratory studies .  
 
1.2.4 To evaluate potential predictive biomarkers of AZD1775 (MK -1775)  sensitivity, 
including MYC, MYCN , p-Wee1 , EZH2  and γ-H2AX in tumor tissues  in 
correlative and exploratory studies . 
 
 
2.0 BACKGROUND   
2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development and Dosing  
Although patients with localized solid tumors generally do well, patients with refractory 
and relapsed disease have a poor prognosis.  New therapeutic regimens that combin e 
chemotherapy with targeted chemosensitizing agents merit study in this patient population.   
2.1.1 Rationale for Wee1 inhibition strategies  
Wee1 is a tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates and inhibits CDK1 ( the HUGO term 
for CDC2 ) at a conserved tyrosine 15 residue, affecting proper coordination of 
DNA replication as well as entry into mitosis.1 In the presence of DNA damage or 
replication stress (by chemothera py, radiation or oncogenes) CDK1 activity is 
restrained by the checkpoint kinases CHK1 and Wee1, allowing for repair of DNA 
prior to mitosis and tolerance of replication stress and maintenance of tumor cell 
viability.2 Inhibition of CHK1 or Wee1 under these circumstances leads to

replication fork collapse or mitotic catastrophe, generation of double -strand DNA 
breaks and ultimately cellular death. Therefore, checkpoint inhibitors have been 
evaluated in clinical trials as chemotherapy and radiation sensitizers.3 The Wee1 
inhibitor MK -1775 has be en evaluated in combination with gemcitabine, 
carboplatin and cisplatin, 5 -FU, topotecan and cisplatin and carboplatin and 
pacli taxel.4  
 
2.1.2 Rationale for Wee1  inhibition strategies in pediatric solid tumors  
In an effort to identify novel therapeutics for neuroblastoma, an unbiased RNA  
interference screen of the entire protein kinome was performed and the Cell Cycle 
Checkpoint Kinase 1 ( CHK1) was the most potent in a panel of ten neuroblastoma 
cell lines.5 Upon examination of downstream signaling, this effect was  
phenocopied by inhibition of the CDK1 kinase, Wee1.6 Like CHK1, Wee1 was 
highly expressed in neuroblastoma, particularly tumors with MYCN amplification 
and constitutively phosphorylated in neuroblastoma cell lines and diagnostic 
primary tumors of children with advanced disease. This single agent sensitivity 
resulted in synergistic gro wth inhibition in combination with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy agents, including camptothecins. 6 There is also potent synergistic 
growth inh ibition with dual CHK1 and Wee1 targeting.6,7 Neuroblastoma is likely 
sensitive to single agent Wee1 inhibition due to intrinsic replication stress and high 
CDK1 activity due to high levels of MYC and MYCN.2 MYCN  is an oncogenic 
driver in high -risk neuroblastoma via focal genomic amplification, and tumors 
without MYCN  amplification have high levels of c -MYC. Yet, both oncogenes 
have remained undruggable. As has been recently shown with MYC -induced 
lymphomas, targeting the ATR/CHK1 and Wee1 pathways in MYC -driven tumors 
may be a synthetic lethal means of targeting MYC and MYCN.8,9 As such, 
medulloblastoma is an embryonal tumor that also involves MYC / MYCN in tumor 
initiation and maintenance and marks the most clinically aggressive subset of 
medulloblastomas.10-12 Like neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma cell lines are also 
sensitive to single agent Wee1 inhibition (unpublished results). In addition, Wee1 
has been shown to be overexpressed in diffuse in trinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) 
tumors and MK -1775 was a radiation sensitizer in a mouse model of DIPG.13  
 
2.1.3 Rationale for Chemotherapy Backbone  
In adult clinical trials, MK -1775 has been developed in combination with 
gemcitabine, cisplatin, carboplatin, 5 -FU, topotecan plus cisplatin and carboplatin 
plus paclitaxel. The rationale for combining MK -1775 with irinotecan in a 
pediatric phase 1/2 clin ical trial is multi -factorial. Irinotecan induces replication 
arrest and MK -1775’s mechanism of action involves replication arrest over -ride 
providing mechanistic support for this combination. There is pre -clinical data 
showing synergistic growth inhibitio n of MK -1775 in combination with irinotecan 
in preclinical models of neuroblastoma.6 The multiple five -day dosing regimen of 
irinotecan allows for serial dosing of MK -1775, allowing for a more prolonged 
exposure than single day dosing and irinotecan induced downregulation of CHK1. 
Finally, irinotecan containing regimens have been shown  to have activity in 
combination in neuroblastoma  (providing a backbone to test  targeted agents ) 14 and 
there is  single agent activity of irinotecan in medulloblastoma (16% overall 
response rate).15 
 
To date, MK -1775 has not been combined with i rinotecan in a clinical trial, but

MK-1775 was combined with topotecan and cisplatin in an adult phase 1 trial for 
cervical cancer. 4  
 
2.1.4 Rationale for Proposed MK-1775  and Irinotecan Dosing  
MK-1775 has been administered to adults as a single agent and in combination 
with several chemotherapeutics. The schedule of administration of MK -1775 was 
determined by the chemotherapy regimen and included single dosing and multiple 
day dosing regimens.  
 
The proposed starting dose, schedule and dose escalation of MK -1775 on a 5 day 
schedule were based on the following considerations:  4 
 
▪ Wee1 restrains CDK1 activity and is involved in the DNA damage response, 
and irinotecan causes DNA strand breaks.2  Inhibitors of Wee1 including MK -
1775 may potentiate the DNA damage in tumor cells.  However, MK -1775 
may also potentiate toxicity.  Therefore, the starting dose of irinotecan on this 
study (70 mg/m2 PO) corresponds to the recommended phase 2 do se for 
heavily pretreated patients (40 mg/m2 IV) and the starting dose used in 
combination regimens.16,17  In the absence of dose limiting toxicity, the dose 
of irinotecan will be escalated from 70 mg/m2 to 90 mg/m2. 17 
 
▪ Irinotecan is administered on a daily 5 -day schedule every 21 days; therefore, 
the proposed administration of MK -1775 will be daily x 5 every 21 days.15 
MK-1775 has a short half -life (average of 9 hours). In dogs, the No Observed 
Adverse Effect Level (NOEL) of MK -1775 was 100 mg/m2 (5 mg/kg) daily 
for 7 days. Given the novel combination, schedule and dosing in children, a 
conservative approach was taken with dosing. The proposed starting dose of 
MK-1775 daily for 5 days on this trial is 50 mg/m2, 50% of the NOEL in dogs 
receiving MK -1775 daily x 7 day s. The highest MK -1775 dose proposed on 
this study (110 mg/m2 daily x 5 days) is at the NOEL. The proposed starting 
dose on this trial (50 mg/m2) was also determined by the tolerated adult phase 
1 clinical trial that evaluated patients receiving 3 days of IV topotecan, 1 day 
of IV cisplatin and 5 days of MK -1775 (50 mg for 9 doses) every 21 days.  The 
highest proposed dose in this trial’s escalation (1 10 mg/m2) is based on the 
adult phase 1 multiple day dosing trials in which 5 doses of MK -1775 were 
adminis tered over 2.5 days in combination with carboplatin and cisplatin. The 
MTD of MK -1775 was 225 mg and 200 mg, respectively, which when 
converted to 5 -day single dose administration would be approximately 116 
mg/m2/day.  
 
▪ Preclinical data indicates that MK-1775 concentrations ≥ 0.28µM produce a 
target effect (EC50 for p -CDK1 ) after gemcitabine.4 Clinical studies showed 
accumulation of drug with BID dosing, but this was minimal with daily dosing. 
A single oral dose of 100 mg MK -1775 (57 mg/m2) in adults in combination 
with chemotherapy has an average C max of approximately 0.3 µM; therefore, 
all pr oposed MK -1775 doses on this study may produce a biologically relevant 
concentration. In the absence of dose limiting toxicity, MK -1775 dose 
escalation is proposed to increase the systemic exposure and prolong time 
above this threshold concentration.

2.1.5 Rationale for Cefixime  
There are two distinct patterns of irinotecan -associated diarrhea: early and late 
onset. Early onset diarrhea occurs within 4 hours of treatment, is associated with 
cholinergic symptoms and is readily reversible with atropine. Late o nset diarrhea 
develops during the second week of therapy and is one of the main dose limiting 
toxicities of irinotecan in pediatric studies.18  With the addition of antibiotics, such 
as cefixime, that selectively eradicate intestinal bacteria that would otherwise re -
activate the metabolized irinotecan, investigators have been able to improve 
tolerability of irinotecan. Using cefixime combined wi th as needed use of 
loperamide, Furman et al 19 were able to increase the MTD of protracted oral 
irinotecan by 50%, and a similar increase was noted with protracted IV irinotecan 
dosing.20  
 
2.2 Preclinical Studies   
 
2.2.1 Antitumor Activity of Irinotecan in pre -clinical models  
Irinotecan is a camptothecin prodrug whose active metabolite (SN -38) induces 
cytotoxicity in the presence of topoisomerase I. Topoisomerase I permits 
relaxation of supercoiled DNA by inducing single strand breaks, which reduces 
torsional stra in during DNA replication and transcription. When an active 
topoisomerase I enzyme is present, camptothecins stabilize topoisomerase -induced 
DNA strand breaks which ultimately leads to apoptosis.  Anti -tumor activity of 
irinotecan has been demonstrated in mouse models of neuroblastoma21, 
rhabdomyosarcoma22 and CNS malignancies.22,23 
 
2.2.2 Antitumor Activity of MK-1775  in pre -clinical models  
Kinase screening assays identified MK -1775 as a selective and potent (IC50= 5.18 
nM) inhibitor of Wee1.24 In vitro synergistic antiproliferative effects were 
observed in tumor cells treated with MK -1775 in combination with gemcitabine, 
cisplatin, carboplatin and 5 -FU. In tumor bearing mouse xenografts, MK -1775 was 
administered according the chemothera py schedule.  There was enhanced anti -
tumor efficacy, increased survival and tolerability noted in multiple xenograft 
models when MK -1775 was combined with gemcitabine, cisplatin, carboplatin, 5 -
FU, radiation or capecitabine.4,24-28 
 
While MK -1775 has the potential to enhance chemotherapy sensitivity, with 
continuous dosing there is single agent activity in some tumor models. In vitro 
testing of eight sarcoma lines with MK -1775 had an average IC50 of 342 nM (± 
154 nM).29 There was anti -tumor efficacy of twice daily dosing of MK -1775 in 
mouse xenografts bearing tumors derived from non -small cell lung cancer and 
colorectal carcinoma.4 MK-1775 enhanced the radiation response in DIPG mouse 
xenografts.13 Finally, MK -1775 also had single agent antiproliferative activity in 
10 of 11 human derived neuroblastoma cell lines with an average IC 50 of 300 nM 
(± 193 nM ) and cell lines derived from the MYCN genetically engineered 
neuroblastoma mouse model (IC50s ~ 200 nM).6 The average IC50 in 4 
medulloblastoma cell lines treated with MK -1775 alone was 454 nM (unpublished Formatted:  Highlight

results).   MK-1775 in combination with SN -38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan) 
resulted in significant synergistic inhibition in eight of ten of the human 
neuroblastoma cell lines tested. 6  
 
 
2.2.3 MK-1775  Toxico logy4 
In the 7 day oral toxicity studies, MK -1775 was administered by 25, 75, or 300 
mg/kg in rats, and at 5 or 15 mg/kg in dogs, once daily for 7 days.  Expected 
toxicity of the hematopoietic organs and GI tract were observed in both rats and 
dogs.  In rats, ho wever, this was associated with mortality at 75 mg/kg (450 mg/m2) 
and 300 mg/kg (1800 mg/m2). During the 2 week recovery period, MK -1775 
related changes recovered or showed a trend towards reversibility in rats dosed at 
25 mg/kg (150 mg/m2) and dogs at 15 mg/kg (300 mg/m2). In the anesthetized 
cardiovascular dog study, MK -1775 marginally prolonged QTc by an average of 
5% and 7%, at the 3 and 10 mg/kg doses, respectively. Only minimal effects on 
blood pressure ( -5%) and heart rate ( -5%) were observed at the 10 mg/kg dose. 
There were no effects on other cardiographic measures, i.e., QRS duration or PR 
interval, at either dose. In mice, MK -1775 had no effect on CNS function (at a dose 
of 10 mg/kg), including gross behavior, spontaneous activity, neural reflexes , or 
thermoregulation during the 24 -hour post dose period.  
 
2.2.4 Preclinical Pharmacokinetic Studies 4 
The PK studies were conducted i n male Sprague -Dawley rats and Beagle dogs 
following IV and PO administration of MK -1775. MK -1775 was rapidly 
distributed and eliminated with the mean half -life (t ½) 1.6 hours in rats and 1.1 
hours in dogs. MK -1775 has moderate plasma protein binding with the unbound 
fraction in rat, human and dog begin 23.2%, 40% and 39.5%, respectively. The 
major metabolic pathway of MK -1775 in human liver preparations was oxidative 
metabolism. In human hepatocytes, the major metabolites formed were an N-
desmethyl metabol ite and an N-oxide derivative. All metabolites observed in 
human liver preparations were also formed in vivo in the rat and dog. Oxidative 
metabolism of MK -1775 was mediated predominantly by cytochrome P450 3A4 
(CYP3A4) and flavin -containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). MK -1775 was a 
weak reversible inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 (IC50 
of 51, 56, 12, and 14 μM, respectively). In addition, MK -1775 was a time -
dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4. MK -1775 is a substrate of P -glycoprotein (Pgp).  
 
2.3 Adult St udies  
 
2.3.1 Phase 1 Studies  4 
MK-1775 clinical data are derived from the phase 1 dose -escalation study (PN001) 
in adult patients with advanced solid tumors, sponsored by Merck.30 The study 
consists of a MK -1775 monotherapy arm and several combination therapy arms 
(MK -1775 with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin). The study objectives 
include invest igating safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of MK -1775 administered as 
monotherapy and as combination therapy. MK -1775 administered as a single agent 
at a single dose ( ≤ 1300 mg PO) was well tolerated, and no MTD has been 
established. A single patient experie nced Grade 3 dehydration and urinary tract 
infection.  To date, a total of 176 patients have received MK -1775, 9 patients 
received MK -1775 as one dose monotherapy. Eight out of the original 9 patients  Formatted:  Highlight

went on to get a combination with cisplatin, carboplati n or gemcitabine and an 
additional 35 patients were enrolled in the single -dose combination. In all, 44 
patients took part in the single -dose monotherapy/combination portion of the 
study. The MTD for single dose MK -1775 given in combination but 24 hours af ter 
cisplatin (75 mg/m2) or gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) has been established at 200 mg, 
and with carboplatin (AUC5) at 325 mg. AE data is available for 43 patients. 
Among all patients receiving single dose MK -1775 in combination with 
chemotherapy, the most co mmon classifications for drug -related AEs ≥ Grade 3 
were blood and lymphocytic system disorders (7/43), gastrointestinal disorders 
(3/43) and investigations (3/43) . The MTDs for BID dosing x 5 doses of MK -1775 
with similar chemotherapy regimens were 200 mg with cisplatin and 225 with 
carboplatin. The DLTs for multiple dose cisplatin (75 mg/m2) were Grade 3 colitis 
and Grade 4 neutropenia in 3 of 4 patients at 250 mg M K-1775 BID for 2.5 days. 
The DLTs for multiple dose carboplatin (AUC  5) were Grade 3 diarrhea and 
nausea and Grade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and pancytopenia in 6 of 12 
patients at 325 mg MK -1775 BID for 2.5 days. MK-1775 in combination with 
gemci tabine is currently being evaluated on a QD × 2 schedule since the PD 
threshold was not met at the initially defined MTD on a BID schedule . 
 
The most frequent adverse events seen in the combination trials are 
myelosuppression, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, c onstipation and abdominal pain. 
Investigational findings, including alterations in blood chemistry, have also been 
affected.  
 
In all, three patients had confirmed partial responses in the multiple dose 
combination study; this included two patients (squamou s cell carcinoma and 
melanoma) receiving multiple doses of MK -1775 at 100 mg BID in combination 
with cisplatin, and one patient (squamous cell carcinoma) receiving single -dose 
MK-1775 at a dose of 200 mg in combination with cisplatin. In an investigator -
sponsored study, two additional refractory ovarian cancer patients receiving 225 
mg MK -1775 BID in combination with carboplatin have had confirmed partial 
responses.  
 
Merck has also sponsored trials with the combination of MK -1775 with 5 -FU with 
and without cisplatin in Japanese patients, combination with topotecan plus 
cisplatin in cervical cancer and carboplatin plus paclitaxel in ovarian cancer. The 
first two studies have been discontinued as a result of prioritization efforts; no 
safety concerns were iden tified. The carboplatin plus paclitaxel study is ongoing.  
 
2.3.2 Phase 2 Studies  
A phase II study of AZD1775 dosed orally twice daily over 2.5 days with 
carboplatin every 21 -days, demonstrated that AZD1775 enhances carboplatin 
efficacy in patients with TP53 mutated ovarian cancers that were previously 
refractory or resistant  to a platinum -based  regiment .31 
 
2.3.3 Pharmacology/Pharmacokinetics/Correlative and Biological Studies 4 
The AUC0 -inf and C max increased approximately proportionate to dose. For the 
majority of patients, C max was reached ~3 hours after dosing (range 1.0 -8.0 hours 
for monotherapy and 1.0 -8.0 hours combination therapy). The mean terminal half -
life (t 1/2) was ~9 hours (mean range 8.2 -12.1 hours for monotherapy and 7.91 -11.9 Formatted:  Highlight

hours for combination therapy). Target engagement was assessed by 
immunohistochemical scoring for variation from baseline in p CDK1 Tyr15 in a skin 
biopsy. A 50% reduction from baseline i n pCDK1 Tyr15 was targeted, based on 
preclinical studies demonstrating significant antitumor effects of MK -
1775/chemotherapy combinations at this level of target engagement in xenograft 
tumor samples. In the PN001 trial, 55% of patients at doses of greater than 100 mg 
showed target engagement.  
 
2.4 Pediatric Studies  
 
2.4.1 Prior Experience in Children  
Part A, the phase 1 dose escalation of ADVL1312, was completed in 2016.32 Thirty -one 
eligible patients, median age 14 years (range 5 -20) were enrolled  on Part A of ADVL1312 ; 
29 (93%) received prior chemotherapy (median 3 regimens) and 25 (81%) received prior 
radiation therapy. Sixteen patients had a primary CNS malignancy: malignant glioma (9), 
ependymoma (3), neuroepithelial tumor (1), medulloblastoma (2) and CNS Ewings 
sarcoma (1). Fifteen patients had extracranial solid tumors: soft tissue sarcoma (6), 
neuroblastoma (2), carcinoma (4), osteosarcoma (2) and Wilms’ Tumor (1). The most 
common toxicities were hematologic and gastrointestinal (nausea, vomi ting, diarrhea). 
Two patients experienced dose limiting toxicity, one with grade 3 diarrhea and dehydration 
and the second with grade 3 dehydration at DL5 (AZD1775 110 mg/m2 and irinotecan 90 
mg/m2). Therefore, the MTD and recommended phase 2 dose from Par t A of ADVL1312 
is AZD1775 (85 mg/m2/day) in combination with irinotecan (90 mg/ m2/day) daily for 
five days every 21 days (D ose Level 4 ). 
 
 
2.5 Overview of Proposed Pediatric Study   
There will be four parts to the study. Part A is the phase 1 dose escalation of AZD1775 
(MK-1775 ) in combination with oral irinotecan  for individuals with refractory or recurrent 
solid tumors. Part A will be conducted in children with refractory or recurrent solid tumors, 
including CNS tumors. AZD1775 (MK -1775)  will be administered  in combination with  
oral irinotecan in a 21 day cycle. Part B will be a phase 2 expansion at the recommended 
phase 2 dose of AZD1775 (MK -1775)  in combination with irinotecan for patients  with 
recurrent or refractory neuroblastoma.  Part C will be a phase 2 expansion at the 
recommended phase 2 dose of AZD1775 (MK -1775)  in combination with oral irinotecan 
for patients  with recurrent or refractory medulloblastoma /CNS PNET . Pharmacokinetics 
will be obtained in all patients in Part A of the study (see Section 8.3 ). Part D will be a 
phase 2 expansion at the recommended phase 2 dose of AZD1775 (MK -1775)  in 
combination with oral irinotecan for patien ts with recurrent or refractory 
rhabdomyosarcoma.  Correlative and exploratory pharmacodynamic , tumor tissue and 
bone marrow studies will be obtained as described in Sections 8.4, 8.5, and 8.6.  
 
2.6 Rationale for inclusion of Part D (Amendment #4)  
Since the initial protocol for ADVL1312 was developed, independent groups have shown 
that AZD1775 has promising in vitro and in vivo activity in pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma, 
supporting the addition of an expansion cohort in this disease.  Kahen et al demonstrated 
that AZD1775 exhibited broad activity with high cell killing in four separate 
rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines (two embryonal and two alveolar).33 Relevant  to this 
amendment, AZD1775 was synergistic with irinotecan, which is a chemotherapeutic agent 
typically used clinically in r habdomyosarcoma. Furthermore, in vivo studies with Formatted:  Highlight

orthotopic rhabdomyosarcoma  xenografts performed at St. Jude’s C hildren’s Research 
Hospital (SJCRH) confirmed AZD1775 to have activity in r habdomyosarcoma. AZD1775 
in combination with irinotecan had a 42% response rate (CR + PR), an effect that was even 
greater with the addition of vincristine (70% response rate).34 Part D will be a phase 2 
expansion at the recommended phase 2 dose of AZD1775 (MK -1775) in combination with 
oral irinotecan for patients with recurrent or refractory rhabdomyosarcoma.

Immediately following enrollment, the institutional pathology report for the diagnosis 
under which the patient is being enrolled must be uploaded into RAVE . The report  must 
include the associated study number and COG patient registration and accession numb ers. 
Personal identifiers, including the patient’s name and initials must be removed from the 
institutional pathology report prior to submission.  
 
3.9 Study Enrollment  
Patients may be enrolled on the study once all eligibility requirements for the study have 
been met. Patients who give informed consent for the protocol in order to undergo 
screening for eligibility are not considered enrolled and should not be enrolled until the 
screening is completed and they are determined to meet all eligibility criteria. Stu dy 
enrollment is accomplished by going to the CTSU OPEN (Oncology Patient Enrollment 
Network) https://open.ctsu.org/open/ . For questions, please contact the CTSU OPEN 
helpdesk at https://www.ctsu.org/ CTSUC ontact .aspx. Patients must be enrolled before 
treatment begins.  The date protocol therapy is projected to start must be no later than five 
(5) calendar days after the date of study enrollment. Patients must not receive any 
protocol therapy prior to enrollment . 
 
3.10 Dose Assignment  
The dose level will be assigned via OPEN at the time of study enrollment.  
 
4.0 PATIENT  ELIGIBILITY   
 
All clinical and laboratory studies to determine eligibility must be performed within 7 days prior to 
enrollment unless otherwise indicated.  Laboratory values used to assess eligibility must be no older 
than seven (7) days at the start of chemo therapy. The start of chemotherapy is defined as the 
initiation of treatment with AZD1775 ( MK-1775 ) and irinotecan. The start of protocol therapy is 
defin ed as the initiation of cefixime  or an availab le equivalent antibiotic (i.e. c efpodoxime) . 
Laboratory tests need not be repeated if chemo therapy starts within  seven (7) days of obtaining 
labs to assess eligibility .  If a post -enrollment lab value is outsid e the limits of eligibility, or 
laboratory values are older than 7 days, then the following laboratory evaluations must be re -
checked within 48 hours prior to initiating chemo therapy: CBC with differential, bilirubin, ALT 
(SGPT) and serum creatinine.  If t he recheck is outside the limits of eligibility, the patient may not

receive protocol -prescribed  chemo therapy and will be considered off protocol therapy. Imaging 
studies must be obtained within 14 days  prior to start of chemo therapy  (repeat the tumor imag ing 
if necessary).   For patients whose disease is evaluated with a bone marrow examination, the bone 
marrow aspirates and biopsies are required within 14 days prior to the start of chemo therapy.  
  
 
Clarification in timing when counting days : As an example, please note that if the patient’s last day 
of prior therapy is September 1st, and the protocol requires waiting at least  7 days for that type of 
prior therapy, then that patient cannot be enrolled until September 8th.

End of cycle 
  
Irinotecan ( PO) will be administered 1 hour prior to AZD1775 ( MK-1775 ) (PO) on days 
1-5, with rest on days 6 -21. Cefixime or an available equivalent antibiotic (i.e. 
cefpodoxime) will be used as diarrheal prophylaxis and administered at least 2 days prior 
to the first dose of irinotecan, during, and 3 days after the last dose of i rinotecan  of each 
cycle . Instructions for administration of oral irinotecan are included in Section 9.3  and 
Appendix V . 
 
AZD1775 (MK -1775)  should be taken on an empty stomach one hour prior or two hou rs after 
a meal. Capsules should be swallowed whole and not opened or manipulated.  If a dose is 
vomited it should not be repeated; resume administration with the next regularly scheduled 
dose.  
 
The doses of irinotecan and AZD1775 (MK -1775)  will be as per Section 5.3 .  Cefixime 
will be dosed at 8 mg/kg PO once daily (max: 400 mg/day).  If cefixime is not available, 
cefpodoxime should be dosed at 5 mg/kg/dose PO twice daily (10 mg/kg/day in two 
divided doses; max : 200 mg/dose).   
 
The treatment regimen may be repeated for a total of 18 cycles, up to a total duration of 
approximately 12 months.  
 
Drug doses should be adjusted based on the BSA calculated from height and weight 
measured  within 7 days  prior to  the beginning of each cycle , and according to the dosing 
nomogram (see Appendix IV).    
 
5.2 Criteria for Starting Subsequent Cycles

*Starting Dose Level  
 
If the MTD has been exceeded at the first dose level, then the subsequent cohort 
of patients will be treated at a dose of 70 mg/m2/dose  of irinotecan and 40 
mg/m2/dose of AZD1775 (MK -1775)  (dose level 0).  
 
5.3.2 Parts B , C, and D : Phase 2 Expansion  
Patients with neuroblastoma (Part B) , medulloblastoma/CNS PNET (Part C) , and 
relapsed  or refractory rhabdomyosarcoma (Part D)  will be treated with irinotecan 
and AZD1775 (MK -1775)  at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) determined 
from the phase 1 component (Part A) of this trial.  
 
The MTD/RP2D of Part A was determined to be  Dose Level 4 (85 mg/m2/dose  
AZD1775 and 90 mg/m2/dose  irinotecan on a 21 -day cycle).  
 
5.3.3 Intra -Patient Escalation  
Intra -patient dose escalation is not allowed.  
 
5.4 Grading of Adverse Events  
Adverse events (toxicities) will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. All appropriate treatment areas should 
have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0. A copy of t he CTCAE version 5.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP web site 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . Any 
suspected or confirmed dose-limiting toxicity should be reported immediately (within 24 
hours) to the Study Chair.  
 
5.5 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
DLT will be defined as any of the following events that are possibly, probably or definitely 
attributable to the combination of irinotecan and AZD1775 (MK -1775) .  The DLT 
observation period for the purposes of dose -escalation (Part A) will be the first  cycle of 
therapy.  
 
Dose limiting hematological and non -hematological toxicities are defined differently.   
 
5.5.1 Non-hematological dose -limiting toxicity

supportive care  
• Grade 3 liver enzyme elevation, including ALT/AST/GGT, that 
returns to Grade  1 or baseline prior to the time for the next 
treatment cycle. Note:  For the purposes of this study the ULN for 
ALT is defined as 45 U/L.  Adverse event grades will be based on 
increases above the upper limit of normal, regardless of the subject’s 
baseline. See Appendix  XII for toxicity grading table.  
• Grade 3 fever  
• Grade 3 infection  
• Grade 3 hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia or

• Grade 3 mucositis or stomatitis ≤ 3 days duration  
 
5.5.1.2  Non-hematological toxicity that causes a delay of  14 days between 
treatment cycles.  
 
5.5.1.3  Note : Allergic reactions that necessitate discontinuation of study drug 
will not be considered a dose -limiting toxicity.  
 
5.5.2 Hematological dose limiting toxicity  
5.5.2.1  Hematological  dose limiting toxicity is defined as:  
 
In patients evaluable for hematological toxicity (see Section 4.1. 8.1),   
• Grade 4 neutropenia for > 7 days  
• Platelet count < 20,000/mm3 on 2 separate days, at least 48 hours apart, 
or requiring a platelet transfusion on 2 separate days, within a 7 day 
period  
• Myelosuppression that causes a delay of > 14 days between treatment 
cycles.  
 
5.5.2.2  Note:  Grade 4 febrile neutropenia will not be considered a dose -limiting 
toxicity.  
 
6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS FOR ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
The Study Chair must be notified of any dosage modification or use of myeloid growth 
factor.  
 
6.1 Dose  Modifications for Hematological Toxicity  
 
6.1.1 Patients who have dose -limiting thrombocytopenia should receive subsequent 
cycles at the same dose of AZD1775 (MK -1775)  and a dose reduction of irinotecan 
to 65 mg/m2 if original dose assignment was 90 mg/m2, or to 50 mg/m2 if original 
dose assignment was 70 mg/m2. If dose -limiting thrombocytopenia recurs after the 
irinotecan is reduced, the AZD1775 (MK -1775)  should be dose reduced to the next 
lower dose assignment indicated in the dosing nomogram (See Appx. IV ). (Note: 
Patients enrolled at Dose Level 0 who experience dose -limiting thrombocytopenia 
after dose reduction of irinotecan should be removed from protocol therapy ). If 
dose limiting thrombocytopenia recurs the patient should be removed from 
protocol therapy . 
 
6.1.2 Patients who have dose -limiting neutropenia (Grade 4 neutropenia of > 7 days 
duration or delay in the start of the next cycle for > 14 days due to neutropenia) 
with no other dose -limiting toxicity should receive the same dose s in the next cycle 
with myeloid gr owth factor support 24-48 hours after completion  of irinotecan and 
AZD1775 (MK -1775) .  [Note: Patients MUST NOT receive prophylactic myeloid 
growth factor in the first cycle  of therapy (See Section 7.4 ).] If dose -limiting 
neutropenia recurs after myeloid growth factor is added, then the patient should be 
treated with 65 mg/m2 irinotecan (or to 50 mg/m2 if original dose assignment was 
70 mg/m2) and the same dose of AZD1775 (MK -1775)  for subsequent cycles. If 
the patient develops  dose-limiting neutropenia at the dose reduced irinotecan, the 
patient should be treated at the next lowest dose of AZD1775 (MK -1775)  indicated 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL 1312

in the dosing nomogram (See Appx. IV ) or removed from protocol therapy if 
enrolled at Dose Level 0 . If dose limiting neutropenia recurs the patient should be 
removed from protocol therapy.  
 
6.1.3 Patients who experience dose -limiting thrombocytopenia after one dose reduction  
of irinotecan and one dose  reduction of AZD1775 (MK -1775)  or dose -limiting 
neutropenia after addition of myeloid growth factor and one dose reduction of 
AZD1775 (MK -1775)  must be removed from protocol therapy.  
 
6.1.4 Patients who have a dose -limiting hematological toxicity that does not resolve to 
eligibility criteria or baseline within 21 days after the planned start of the next 
treatment cycle must be removed from protocol therapy.  
 
6.2 Dose Modifications for Non -Hematological Toxicity  
 
6.2.1 Patients who have any dose -limiting non -hematological toxicity (as defined in 
Section 5.5.1 ) may continue on protocol therapy upon meeting eligibility lab 
requirements or baseline but should receive subsequent doses at the n ext lower 
dose level. Note: Patients enrolled at Dose Level 0 who experience dose-limiting 
non-hematological toxicity  should be removed from protocol therapy.  
 
6.2.2 If the same non-hematological dose -limiting toxicity recurs after one dose 
reduction, the patien t must be removed from protocol therapy.  
 
6.2.3 Patients who have a dose -limiting non -hematological toxicity that does not resolve 
to eligibility criteria or baseline within 21 days after the planned start of the next 
treatment cycle must be removed from protocol therapy.  
 
6.2.4 Dose modifications for diarrhea  
See Appendix VI  for specific guidelines for supportive care measures for patients 
who develop therapy -associated diarrhea.  
• If dose -limiting Grade 3 (> 3 days) or Grade 4 therapy -associated diarrhea 
is experienced by a patient despite maximal use of anti -diarrheal medications 
and appropriate use of prophylactic antibiotics, the dose of irinotecan should 
be reduced to 65 mg/m2 if original dose assignment was 90 mg/m2, or to 50 
mg/m2 if original dose assignment was 70 mg/m2 for subsequent cycles.  
• If dose -limiting Grade 3 (> 3 days) or Grade 4 diarrhea recurs despite  
maximal use of anti -diarrheals, prophylactic antibiotics, after a single 
irinotecan dose reduction , the patient should come off protocol therapy.  
 
 
7.0 SUPPORTIVE  CARE  AND OTHER  CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
 
7.1 Concurrent Anticancer Therapy  
Concurrent cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or 
biologic therapy may NOT be administered to patients receiving  study drug(s). If these 
treatments are administered the patient will be removed from protocol therapy.  
 
7.2 Investigational Agents

7.3 Supportive Care  
Appropriate antibiotics, blood products, antiemetics, fluids, electrolytes and general 
supportive care are to be used as necessary (see Section 6.0 ). See Sections 7.5 and 9.1.5 for 
drugs that  should not be used concomitantly due to potential interactions with irinotecan 
and/or AZD1775 (MK -1775) .  Use of prophylactic antimicrobials to prevent irinotecan -
associated diarrhea (cefixime or available equivalent, i.e. cefpodoxime) is required .  See 
the COG Supportive Care Guidelines at:  
https://childrensoncologygroup.org/index.php/cog -supportive -care-guidelines . 
 
7.4 Growth Factors  
Growth factors that support platelet or white cell number or function can only be 
administered in accordance with Section 6.1  or for culture proven bacteremia or invasive 
fungal infection. The Study Chair should be notified be fore growth factors are initiated.  
 
7.5 Concomitant Medications  
Anticonvulsants should be used as clinically indicated and tapered as soon as possible. The 
use of enzyme inducing anticonvulsants is not permitted. See Appendix II  for a list of 
unacceptable enzyme inducing and recommended non -enzyme inducing anticonvulsants.  
Irinotecan is metabolized by CYP3A4.   
 
Moderate and potent  inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 and sensitive CYP3A4 substrates 
and CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow ther apeutic range should not be used concomitantly 
with AZD1775 (MK -1775)  (See Appendix III ). Corticosteroids may induce CYP3A4 and 
are therefore not routinely recommended on study unless deemed absolutely necessary or 
when used in st able or decreasing doses from the time of study enrollment.  The use of 
aprepitant as an antiemetic is prohibited due to early drug interaction data 
demonstrating increased exposure to AZD1775 (MK -1775) .  
 
Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of AZD1775 (MK -1775)  and 
agents that are sensitive substrates of CYP2C8, 2C9 and 2C19, or substrates of this enzyme 
with narrow therapeutic ranges, as well as agents that are inhibitors or substra tes of P -gp. 
 
Drugs that prolong the QTc may be used only if the drug is necessary and no alternatives 
are available. See Appendix XV  for drugs that may prolong the QTc.  
 
 
8.0 EVALUATIONS/MATERIAL AND DATA TO BE ACCESSIONED  
 
8.1 Required Clinical, Laboratory and Disease Evaluation  
All clinical and laboratory studies to determine eligibility must be performed within 7 days 
prior to enrollment unless otherwise indicated.  Laboratory values used to assess eligibility 
(see Section 4.0 ) must be no older than seven (7) days at the start of chemo therapy. The 
start of chemotherapy is defined as the initiation of treatment with AZD1775 (MK -1775)  
and irinotecan. The start of protocol therapy is defined as the ini tiation of cefixime  or an 
available equivalent antibiotic (i.e. cefpodoxime) . Laboratory tests need not be repeated if 
chemo therapy starts within  seven (7) days of obtaining labs to assess eligibility.  If a post -
enrollment lab value is outside the limits of eligibility, or laboratory  values are older than 
7 days, then the following laboratory evaluations must be re -checked within 48 hours prior 
to initiating chemo therapy: CBC with differential, bilirubin, ALT (SGPT) and serum 
creatinine.  If the recheck is outside the limits of eligibility, the patient may not receive 
protocol -prescribed  chemo therapy and will be considered off protocol therapy. Imaging Formatted:  Highlight

studies must be obtained within 14 days  prior to start of chemo therapy  (repeat the tumor 
imaging if necessary).  For patients whose disease is evaluated with a bone marrow 
examination, the bone marrow aspirates and biopsies are required within 14 days prior to 
the start of chemo therapy.

8.4 Pharmacodynamics (for Part A only)  
Preclinical studies showed that inhibition of p-CDK1 correlated with AZD1775 (MK -
1775)  exposures that resulted in tumor regression and immunohistochemical evidence of 
Wee1 inhibition in both tumor tissues and skin punch biopsies.  While this trial is designed 
to define a maximally tolerated dose, the two correlative and exploratory studies below 
will aid in determining at which dose(s) p -CDK1 and -H2AX  target engagement are 
occurring.  Both studies will be done from the same collection (with the p-CDK1 being the 
priority if sample is limited).  
 
8.4.1 Description of Studies

(orange color) strengths in size 2 gelatin capsules. The dry -filled capsules consist 
of a roler -compacted granule of drug substance, lactose monohydrate, 
microcrystalline, cellulos, croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate. Each 
high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle contains 20 capsules.  
 
The pharmaceutical collaborator does not have stabilit y data to support 
repackaging AZD1775 (MK -1775)  capsules in any container other than what is 
provided.  
 
9.1.4 Storage  and Stability  
AZD1775 (MK -1775)  is to be stored at 2 to 30° C  (36 to 86 ° F. Do not freeze.  
Shelf life studies of AZD1775 (MK -1775)  are on -going . If a storage temperature 
excursion is identified, pr omptly return  AZD1775 (MK -1775)  to 2 - 30° C  and 
quarantine the supplies.  Provide a detailed report of the excursion (including 
documentation of temperature monitoring and duration of the excursion) to 
PMBAfterHours@mail.nih.gov  for determination of suitability.  
 
There is no stability data to support repackaging AZD1775 (MK -1775)  capsules in 
any container other than the original bottle.  Do not repackage in the pharmacy; 
dispense in the original container.  
 
9.1.5 Administration  
Patients will take AZD1775 (MK -1775)  orally based on assigned dose , one hour 
after oral irinotecan.  
 
AZD1775 (MK -1775)  should be taken on an empty stomach one hour prior or two 
hours after a meal. Capsules should be swallowed whole and not opened or 
manipulated.  If a dose is vomited it should not be repeated; resume administration 
with the n ext regularly scheduled dose.  
 
AZD1775 (MK -1775)  is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and is a weak, time -
dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ; do not use in patients taking moderate and potent 
3A4 inhibitors and inducers.  The use of enzyme inducing anticonvulsants  is not 
permitted ( Appendix II ) 
Avoid concomitant CYP3A4 moderate or strong inhibitors/inducers, and sensitive 
substrates with a narrow therapeutic index.   AZD1775 (MK -1775) is also a weak 
inhibitor of CYP2C19.  C aution should be exercised with concomitant 
administration of sensitive substrates or substrates with a narrow therapeutic index.  
 
In vitro transporter studies have shown that AZD1775 (MK -1775) was  an inhibitor 
of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2K, P -glycoprotein (P -gp) and breast 
cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and a substrate for P -gp and BCRP. The PK 
parameters of AZD1775 (MK -1775) could be altered if AZD1775 (MK -1775) is 
coadministered with P -gp and BCRP inhibitors/inducers, and there is potential for 
drug-drug interactions when coadministered with OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, 
MATE2K, P -gp and BCRP substrates. This finding is particularly relevant for 
drugs administered orally where exposure is norma lly limited by BCRP -mediated 
efflux, in particular some statins. Modelling has predicted a substantial increase in 
the exposure of atorvastatin when coadministered with AZD1775 (MK -1775) and 
the use of atorvastatin is therefore prohibited.  
 
The use of apre pitant as an antiemetic is prohibited due to early drug interaction  Formatted:  Highlight

data demonstrating increased exposure to AZD1775 (MK -1775) . AZD1775 (MK -
1775)  is a p -glycoprotein substrate , but has not been evaluated as an inhibitor of 
p-glycoprotein; caution should be  used with p -glycoprotein substrates and 
inhibitors.  
 
Please see Appendix XIV  for drug interactions associated with the drugs used in 
this study.  
 
9.1.6 AZD1775 ( MK-1775 ) Toxicities  
The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a 
single list of reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent 
using a uniform presentation of events by body system. In addition to the 
comprehensive list,  a subset, the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited 
Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and is identified with bold and 
italicized text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are protocol 
specific exceptions to expedited repo rting to NCI (except as noted below).  Refer 
to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelop ment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguide
lines.pdf  for further clarification. Frequency is provided based on 323 patients. 
Below is the CAEPR for AZD1775 (adavosertib).  
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in 
parentheses next t o the AE in the SPEER.  If this CAEPR is part of a combination 
protocol using multiple investigational agents and has an AE listed on different 
SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is 
required.

9.2 Cefixime        (11/17/17)  
(Suprax®) 
 
9.2.1 Source and Pharmacology  
Cefixime is a third generation cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration that 
inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to one or more of the penicillin -
binding proteins and interfering with the final transpeptidation  step of 
peptidoglycan synthesis. Its spectrum of activity is similar to other third -generation 
agents, including Enterobacteriaceae, and β -lactamase producing H. influenzae  
and N. gonorreae , and Staph.  Aureus. When taken  orally , it is about 40% -50% 
absorb ed whether administered with or without food. The area under the time 
versus concentration curve is greater by approximately 10% -25% with the oral 
suspension than with the tablet after doses of 100 to 400  mg, when tested in normal 
adult volunteers. This in creased absorption should be taken into consideration if 
the oral suspension is to be substituted for the tablet.  Cefixime serum half -life is 
approximately 3 -4 hours. It is excreted primarily by the kidney. There is no 
evidence of metabolism of cefixime in vivo.

kidney injury, creatinine increased, vaginal infection, vomiting.  
Pregnancy & 
Lactation  Pregnancy Category B  
Teratogenic effects were not observed in animal reproduction studies. Cefixime 
crosses the placenta and can be detected in the amniotic fluid. There are no well -
controlled studies of cefixime in pregnant women; effects of cefixime on the fetus 
are unknown.   An increase in most types of birth defects was not found following 
first trimester exposure to cephalosporins. It is not known whether cefixime is 
excreted in human milk.  
 
9.2.3 Formulation and Stability:  
Cefixime is available in scored 400 mg film coated tab lets, 400 mg capsules, 100 
mg chewable tablets, and 200 mg chewable tablets.  The chewable tablets are tutti -
frutti flavor and contain aspartame and fd&c red #40 aluminum lake.  Cefixime is 
also available  in two strengths as a powder for oral suspension, wh ich when 
reconstituted, provides either a 100 mg/5mL or 200 mg/5 mL  suspension . The 
powder for oral suspension is strawberry flavored and contains sodium benzoate, 
sucrose, and xanthan gum.  After reconstitution, suspension may be stored for 14 
days at room  temperature or under refrigeration.  
 
Cefixime tablets and powder for oral suspension are stored at 20 - 25°C (68 - 77°F).  
Do not freeze. The suspension bottle should be kept tightly closed.  
 
9.2.4 Administration  
Given orally at 8 mg/kg/day (maximum dose 400 mg) divided every 12 -24 hours . 
May be administered with or without food; administer with food to decrease GI 
distress.  However, if administered with food ensure that sufficient time has elapsed 
prior to administering AZD1775 (MK -1775)  (refer to section 9.1.5  for details)  
 
Shake the suspension prior to withdrawing dose or administration.

9.3 IRINOTECAN         (03/07/17 ) 
[CPT -11,Camptothecin -11,7-ethyl -10-(4-[1-piperidino] -1-piperidino) -carbonyloxy -
camptothecin), Camptosar®],   NSC #616348      
 
9.3.1 Source and Pharmacology  
Irinotecan is a semisynthetic water -soluble analog of camptothecin (a plant 
alkaloid isolated from Camptotheca acuminata) . Irinotecan is a prodrug that 
requires conversion, by the carboxylesterase enzyme to the topoisomerase -I 
inhibitor, SN -38 in order to exert anti -tumor activity. SN -38 is approximately 
1000  times more potent than irinotecan . Camptothecins interact specifically with 
the enzyme topoisomerase I, which relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing 
reversible single -strand breaks. Irinotecan  and its active metabolite SN -38 bind to 
the topoisomerase I -DNA complex and prevent religation of these single -strand 
breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan  is due to 
double -strand D NA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication 
enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and 
either irinotecan  or SN -38. Renal excretion is a minor route of elimination of 
irinotecan. The majority of the drug is me tabolized in the liver. SN -38 is 
conjugated to glucuronic acid and this metabolite has no anti -tumor activity. The 
extent of conversion of SN -38 to its glucuronide has been inversely correlated with 
the risk of severe diarrhea, because the other major rout e of SN -38 excretion is 
biliary excretion by canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (cMOAT), 
which presumably leads to mucosal injury. In addition, APC and NPC are 
oxidative metabolites of irinotecan dependent on the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. After 
intravenous infusion of irinotecan  in humans, irinotecan  plasma concentrations 
decline in a multiexponential manner, with a mean terminal elimination half -life 
of about 6  to 12 hours. The mean terminal elimination half -life of the active 
metabolite SN -38 is about 10  to 20 hours. Irinotecan  is 30% to 68% bound to 
albumin and SN -38 is approximately 95% bound to albumin.

Pregnancy & 
Lactation  Fetal toxicities and teratogenic effects of irinotecan have been noted in animals at 
doses similar or less than those used in humans. Toxicities include: decreased 
skeletal ossification, multiple anomalies, low birth weight and increased fetal 
mortality. It is not known if irinotecan is excreted into breast milk but it is excreted 
into rat milk.  
(L) Toxicity may also occur later  
 
9.3.3 Formulation & Stability  
Each mL of irinotecan injection contains 20  mg irinotecan  (on the basis of the 
trihydrate salt) , 45 mg sorbitol , and 0.9  mg lactic acid. When necessary, pH has 
been adjusted to 3.5 (range, 3.0 to 3.8) with sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric 
acid. Irinotecan is available in single -dose amber glass vials in 40  mg (2  mL), 
100 mg (5  mL), 300 mg (15 mL), and 500 mg (25 mL) . Store at controlled room 
temperature 15° -30°C (59° -86°F). Protect from light. It is recommended that the 
vial (and backing/plastic blister) sh ould remain in the carton until the time of use.  
 
9.3.4 Guidelines for Administration  
See Treatment and Dose Modifications sections of the protocol  and (Appendix V ). 
For oral use, the appropriate volume of irinotecan solution (20 mg/ml) should be  
drawn up undiluted into a plastic oral syringe. Each dose is to be mixed with juice 
(crangrape, cranapple, cranberry, or other “cran” juice or juice cocktail) 
immediately  before administration. The oral syringes containing undiluted 
irinotecan are stable for 21 days when stored in a refrigerator. Irinotecan has a very 
unpleasant flavor, therefore,  the juice will be used to mask the drug taste. See 
protocol for pre -medication an d supportive care measures.  
 
For this protocol, irinotecan is administered orally, 1 hour prior to AZD1775 (MK -
1775) .

10.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM PROTOCOL THERAPY AND OFF STUDY 
CRITERIA  
 
10.1 Criteria for Removal from Protocol Therapy  
 
a) Clinical (including physical examination or serum tumor markers) or radiographic 
evidence of progressive disease (See Section 12.0 ). 
b) Adverse Events requiring removal from protocol therapy (See Section 6.0 ). 
c) Refusal of further protocol therapy by patient/parent/guardian  
d) Non-compliance that in the opinion of the investigator does not allow for ongoing 
partici pation.  
e) Completion of 18 cycles of therapy.  
f) Physician determines it is not in the patient’s best interest.  
g) Repeated eligibility laboratory studies ( CBC with differential, bilirubin, ALT (SGPT) 
or serum creatinine)  are outside the parameters required for e ligibility prior to the start 
of AZD1775 (MK -1775)  (and/or irinotecan , if applicable).  S ee Section s 4.0 and 8.1. 
h) Study is terminated by Sponsor.  
i) Pregnancy  
 
Patients who are removed from protocol therapy during cycle 1 should continue to 
have the required observations in Section 8.1  until the originally planned end of the 
cycle or until all adverse events have resolved per Section 13.4.4 , whichever happens 
LATER . The only exception is with documentation of the patient’s withdrawal of 
consent. Patients who are removed from protocol therapy in subsequent cycles should 
have the necessary observations to ensure adequate clinical care.  
 
Patients who are off protocol therapy are to be followed until they meet the criteria for Off 
Study (see below). Ongoing adverse events, or adverse events attributed to protocol therapy 
that emerge after the patient is removed from protocol therapy, but within 30 days of the 
last dose of investigational agent, must be followed and reported via RAVE and CTEP -
AERS (if applicable).  Follow -up data will be required unless consent is withdrawn.  
 
10.2 Off Study Criteria  
 
a) Thirty days after the last dose of the investigational agent.  
b) Death  
c) Lost to f ollow -up 
d) Withdrawal of consent for any further required observations or data submission.  
e) Enrollment onto another COG therapeutic (anti -cancer) study  
f) Patient did not receive protocol treatment after study enrollment  
 
 
 
11.0 STATISTICAL AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Sample Size and Study Duration  
 
Strata : 
  Part A:  Patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors (Phase 1)  
 Part B:  Patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma (Phase 2)   
  Part C:  Patients with relapsed or refractory medulloblastoma/CNS PNET (Phase 2)  
 Part D: Patients with relapsed or refractory rhabdomyosarcoma (Phase 2)

Version Date: 06/02/2020   Page 46 
 
 
A minimum of 3 evaluable patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors including CNS 
tumors (Part A) will be entered at each dose level for det ermination of MTD. Once the 
MTD or recommended phase 2 dose has been defined, up to 6 additional patients with 
relapsed/refractory solid tumors may be enrolled to acquire PK data in a representative 
number of young patients ( i.e. 6 patients in each group o f < 12 years old  and ≥ 12 years 
old).  Review of the enrollment rate into previous COG new agent studies indicates that 1 -
2 patients per month are available, which will permit completion of this part of the study 
within 22 -44 months.  Assuming an inevaluab ility rate of 20%, a maximum of 44 patients 
is anticipated in Part A.  In the unlikely scenario that all dose levels require expansion to 
12 evaluable patients ( Section 11.2.2 ), a maximum of 80 patients is anticipated.  
 
Accrual to Parts B , C, and D will only open once the MTD or recommended phase 2 dose 
has been determined in Part A, and may open concurrently with the PK expansion  
described above . Review of patient accrual onto recent Phase 2 studies indicat es the 
following entry rates for the various tumors under study can be achieved:  
 
Disease Group/Part   Patients/Year  
Neuroblastoma    36 
Medulloblastoma/CNS PNET   15 
Rhabdomyosarcoma   8 
 
A minimum of 29 patients and a maximum of 74 patients are expected to e nroll in Parts B , 
C, and D, assuming an inevaluability rate of 20% .  We anticipate that the entire study will 
require 37-82 months for enrollment and evaluation of all parts.  
 
The MTD/RP2D of Part A was determined to be  Dose Level 4 (85 mg/m2/dose  AZD1775 
and 90 mg/m2/dose  irinotecan on a 21 -day cycle).  Part A has been completed  37 patients 
were  enrolled, no patients were ineligible.  
 
11.2 Definitions  
 
11.2.1  Evaluable For Adverse Effects  
Any patient who experiences DLT  at any time during protocol therapy is 
considered evaluable for Adverse Effects. Note: Patients who experience dose -
limiting diarrhea must have received at least 85% of the protocol -specified 
supportive care (e.g. cefixime or equivalent) in Cycle 1 to be considered evaluable 
for this Adverse Effect.  
 
Patients without DLT who receive  all of the prescribed dose in Cycle 1 protocol 
guidelines and had the appropriate toxicity monitoring studies performed are also 
considered evaluable for Adverse Effects. Pati ents who are not evaluable for 
Adverse Effects at a given dose level will be replaced.  
 
11.2.2  Maximum Tolerated Dose  
The MTD or recommended phase 2 dose will be the maximum doses of AZD1775 
(MK -1775)  and irinotecan at which fewer  than one -third of patients exper ience 
DLT (See Section 5.5 ) when receiving AZD1775 (MK -1775)  in combination with 
irinotecan in Part A . In the event that two DLTs observed out of 6 evaluable  
patients are different classes of Adverse Effects (e.g. hepatotoxici ty and 
myelosuppression), expansion of the cohort to 12 patients will be considered if all 
of the following conditions are met:  
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL 1312  
  
  
Version Date: 06/02/2020   Page 47 
 
 
•  One of the DLTs does not appear to be dose -related  
•  The Adverse Effects are readily reversible  
•  The study chair, DVL statistician, DVL committee chair or vice chair, 
and IND sponsor all agree that expansion of the cohort is acceptable   
Expansion will proceed according to the rules of the 3+3 design (Section 11.3): 
Three additional patients will be st udied.   If none of the initial three additional 
patients experiences DLT, the dose will be escalated.   If one of the initial three 
additional patients experiences DLT, expansion to a total of 12 patients will 
continue.   If fewer than 1/3 of patients in the expanded cohort experience dose -
limiting toxicities, the dose escalation can proceed.  
 
11.2.3  Evaluability for Response  
Any patient who is enrolled and receives at least one dose of AZD1775 (MK -1775)  
in combination with irinotecan  will be consider ed evaluable for response provided: 
(1) the patient demonstrates progressive disease or death while on protocol 
therapy; or (2) the patient is observed on protocol therapy for at least one cycle and 
the tumor is not removed surgically prior to the time com plete response or partial 
response is confirmed, or (3) the patient demonstrates a complete or partial 
response as confirmed according to protocol criteria. Patients who demonstrate a 
complete or partial response confirmed by central review will be conside red to 
have experienced a response for the application of the rule given in Section 11.4 . 
Two objective status determinations are required to confirm best response ( Section 
12.7). All other pati ents will be considered non -responders. All patients considered 
to have a response (CR or PR) must have imaging studies reviewed centrally at the 
COG. Centers will be notified by the COG about requests for scans of patients with 
stable disease. See Section 8.2  regarding shipping instructions. Preliminary 
assessment of activity using institutionally provided tumor measurements will be 
entered into CDUS quarterly. The central review by COG will be provided as the 
final reviewed a ssessment of response when such becomes available.  
 
11.3 Dose Escalation and Determination of MTD (Part A)  
The 3+3 design will be used for dose -escalation in Part A for determination of MTD in 
each Part of the study   
11.3.1  Three patients are studied at the first dose  level.  
 
11.3.2  If none of these three patients experience DLT, then the dose is escalated                                                                             
to the next higher level in the three subsequent patients.  
 
11.3.3  If one of three patients experiences DLT at the current dose, then up to three more 
patients are accrued at the same level.  
 
a)  If none of these three additional patients experience DLT, then the dose is 
escalated in subsequent patients.  If there are no further dose escalations, then 
the RP2D has been confirmed.  
 
b)  If one or more of these three additional patients experiences DLT, then patient 
entry at that dose level is stopped.  (See Section 11.2.2  for exception to rule).  
Up to three more pati ents are treated at the next lower dose (unless six patients 
have already been treated at that prior dose).  
 
11.3.1  If two or more of a cohort of up to six patients experience DLT at a given dose 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL 1312  
  
  
Version Date: 06/02/2020   Page 48 
 
level, then the MTD has been exceeded and dose escalation will be s topped (see 
Section 11.2.2  for exception to rule).  Up to three more patients are treated at the 
next lower dose (unless six or more patients have already been treated at that 
prior dose).  The highest dose with less than two DLTs out of six evaluable 
patients will be the estimated MTD.  
 
In addition to determination of the MTD, a descriptive summary of all toxicities 
will be reported.  
 
The MTD/RP2D of Part A was determined to be  Dose Level 4  (85 mg/m2/dose  
AZD1775 and 90 mg/m2/dose  irinotecan on a 21 -day cycle).  
 
11.4 Phase 2 Evaluation in Neuroblastoma (Part B) , Medulloblastoma/CNS PNET (Part 
C) and Rhabdomyosarcoma (Part D)  
 
The best response of disease to AZD1775 (MK -1775)  in combination with 
irinotecan will be examined separately in each of Parts B ,  C, and D .   
 
11.4.1  Study Design  for patients with Neuroblastoma (Part B)  
 
The following Simon’s optimal two stage design35 will be used  in Part B .

AZD1775 (MK -1775)  in combination with irinotecan will not be considered of 
sufficient interest for further evaluation in a disease category if the true response 
rate is 5% and of sufficient activity if the true response rate is 25%. If AZD1775 
(MK -1775)  in combination with irinotecan has a true response rate of 5%, the rule 
described above will identify it of sufficient activity for further study with 
probability 0.07 (type I error), and the trial will have an expected sample size of 
14 with 60% probability of early termination.  If AZD1775 (MK -1775)  in 
combin ation with irinotecan has a true response rate of 25%, the rule described 
above will identify it of sufficient activity for further study with probability 0.88 
(power against the alternative hypothesis P = 0.25).

sufficient interest for further evaluation in a disease category if the true response 
rate is 15% and of sufficient activity  if the true response rate is 40 %. If AZD1775 
(MK -1775)  in combination with irinotecan has a true response rate of 15%, the 
rule described above will identify it of sufficient activity for fur ther study with 
probability 0.05  (type I error), and the trial will ha ve an expected sample size of 
13 with 60% probabil ity of early termination.  If AZD1775 (MK -1775)  in 
combination with irinotecan has a true response rate of 40 %, the rule described 
above will identify it of sufficient activity for fur ther study with probability 0.81  
(power against the  alternative hypothes is P = 0.40 ).

Response in all patients will be determined according to the evaluation criteria 
outlined in Section 12.0  as either complete response (CR), partial response (PR), 
stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) and reported as final results.  A 
report on the efficacy assessment will be posted on the completed disease stratum 
as part of the semi -annual study committee meeting book report.  
 
Data collected from any patients enrolled at the M TD or recommended phase 2 
dose or enrolled onto Parts B , C, or D  will be utilized in the Phase 2 study.  
 
 
11.4.4  Method of Analysis  
Response criteria are described in Section 12.0 . Response rates will be calculated 
as the percent of patients whose best response is a CR or PR and confidence 
intervals will be constructed according to the method of Chang.36 A responder is 
defined as a patient who achieves  a best confirmed response (as defined in Section 
12.7) of PR or CR on the study.  
 
11.5 Inclusion of Children, Women and Minorities  
The study is open to all participants regardless of gender or ethnicity.  Review of accrual 
to pa st COG studies of new agents demonstrates the accrual of both genders and all NIH -
identified ethnicities to such studies.  Efforts will be made to extend the accrual to a 
representative population, but in a Phase 1 trial which will accrue a limited number of 
patients, a balance must be struck between patient safety considerations and limitations on 
the number of individuals exposed to potentially toxic or ineffective treatments on the one 
hand and the need to explore gender, racial, and ethnic aspects of cl inical research on the 
other. If differences in outcome that correlate to gender, racial, or ethnic identity are noted, 
accrual may be expanded or additional studies may be performed to investigate those 
differences more fully.  
 
11.6 Pharmacokinetic and Correla tive Studies and Response Analysis  
A descriptive analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of AZD1775 (MK -1775)  will 
be performed to define systemic exposure, drug clearance, and other pharmacokinetic 
parameters. The PK parameters will be summarized with  simple summary statistics, 
including means, medians, ranges, and standard deviations (if numbers and distribution 
permit).   
 
While the primary aim of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of AZD1775 (MK -1775) , 
patients will have disease evaluations perf ormed as indicated in Section 8.1 .  Disease 
response will be assessed according to RECIST criteria for patients with solid tumors, and 
will be reported descriptively.  
 
Decreased p -CDK1 indicating Wee1 inhibition  by AZD1775 (MK -1775)  and predictive 
biomarkers of AZD1775 (MK -1775)  sensitivity will also be investigated.  All these 
analyses  will be descriptive and exploratory  and hypotheses generating in nature .

12.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA  
 
12.1 Com mon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be utilized for AE reporting.  All 
appropriate treatment areas should ha ve access to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0. A 
copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/ele ctronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
 
 
12.2 Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumors  
See the table in section 8.0  for the schedule of tumor evaluations. In addition to t he 
scheduled scans, a confirmat ory scan should be obtained  at least 21 days  following initial 
documentation of objective response.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the revised Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) .37  Key points are 
that 5 target lesions are identified and that changes in the largest  diameter (unidimensional 
measu rement) of the tumor lesions but the shortest  diameter of malignant lymph nodes are 
used in the RECIST v 1.1 criteria.  
 
12.2.1  Definitions  
 
12.2.1.1  Evaluable for objective response : Patients who exhibit objective disease 
progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will be considered evaluable for 
response. For all other patients,  only those patients who have measurable 
disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of 
combi nation therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be 
considered evaluable for response.  
 
12.2.1.2  Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response : Patients who have lesions 
present at baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of 
measura ble disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have 
had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for non -
target disease.  The response assessment is based on the presence, 
absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.   
 
12.2.2  Disease Parameters  
 
12.2.2.1  Measurable disease : Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be 
recorded) as ≥ 20 mm by chest x -ray, as ≥ 10 mm with CT scan, or ≥ 10 
mm with calipers by clinical exam.  All tumor measurements must  be 
recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note :  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area 
might or might not be considered measurable.  If the investigator 
thinks it appropriate to include them, the conditio ns under which 
such lesions should be considered must be defined in the 
protocol . 
 
12.2.2.2  Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL 1312  
  
  
Version Date: 06/02/2020   Page 52 
 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed 
by CT scan (CT scan slice t hickness no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline 
and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  
 
12.2.2.3  Non-measurable disease:  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including 
small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological ly mph nodes 
with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non -measurable disease.  
Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as 
non-measurable.  
 
Note:   Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined 
simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions 
(neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by 
definition, si mple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent 
cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they 
meet the definition of measurability described above. However, 
if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are 
preferred f or selection as target lesions.  
 
12.2.2.4  Target lesions:  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per 
organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should 
be identified as target lesions  and recorded and measured at basel ine.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with 
the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in 
addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  It may be the cas e that, on occasion, the largest lesion 
does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance 
the next largest lesion that can be measured reproducibly should be 
selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short 
axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The 
baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to  further characterize 
any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the 
disease.  
 
12.2.2.5  Non-target lesions : All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be 
identified  as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, 
absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be 
noted throughout follow -up.  
 
12.2.3  Methods for Evaluation of M easurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless 
the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL 1312  
  
  
Version Date: 06/02/2020   Page 53 
 
 
12.2.3.1  Clinical lesions:   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable 
when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) 
and  10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In 
the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photograp hy, including 
a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
12.2.3.2  Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions 
when they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  
However, CT is preferable.  
 
12.2. 3.3 Conventional CT and MRI:   This guideline has defined measurability of 
lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 
mm or less.  If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the 
minimum size for a measurable lesion shou ld be twice the slice 
thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body 
scans). Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior 
scans.  
 
12.2.3.4  PET-CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion 
of a combined PET -CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality 
for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document 
that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of i dentical diagnostic 
quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT 
portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can 
be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring 
cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT 
introduces additional data that may bias an investigator if it is not 
routinely or serially performed.   
 
12.2.3.5  Tumor markers : Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  
If markers are initially above  the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
12.2.3.6  Cytology, Histology:  These techniques can be used to differentiate 
between partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare 
cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, 
where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
 Cytology should be obtained if an effusion appears or worsens during 
treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease.  
 
12.2.3.7  FDG -PET: While FDG -PET response assessments need additional 
study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET 
scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression 
(particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -
PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL 1312  
  
  
Version Date: 06/02/2020   Page 54 
 
up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion.  
 
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of 
disease confirmed by CT, this is PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional 
follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date 
of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is 
not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
 
 Note :  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one that is FDG avid 
with an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue 
on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
 
12.2.4  Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumor and Measurable Disease  
 
12.2.4.1  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target and non -target 
lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or non -target) must have reduction in short 
axis to <  10 mm.  If immunocytol ogy is available, 
no disease must be detected by that methodology.  
Normalization of urinary catecholamines or other 
tumor markers if elevated at study enrollment (for 
patients with neuroblastoma).  
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the su m of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline sum diameters  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline  
sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition 
to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
(Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions 
is also considered progressions). Note:  in 
presenc e of SD or PR in target disease but 
unequivocal progression in non -target or non -
measurable disease, the patient has PD  if there is 
an overall level of substantial worsening in non -
target disease such that the overall tumor burden 
has increased sufficientl y to merit 
discontinuation of therapy  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as 
reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study  
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL 1312  
  
  
Version Date: 06/02/2020   Page 55 
 
 
12.2.4.2  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph 
nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis)  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the 
upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical 
response.  
 
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) 
and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above 
the normal limits  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or m ore new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non -target 
lesions.  Unequivocal progression  should not 
normally trump target lesion status.  It must be 
representative of overall disease status change, 
not a single lesion increase.     
 
12.2.5  Overall Best Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined as outlined in Section 
12.7 from a sequence of overall r esponse assessments.  
 
 
12.3 Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumors and Evaluable Disease  
 
12.3.1  Evaluable Disease  
The presence of at least one lesion, with no lesion that can be accurately measured 
in at least one dimension.  Such lesions may be evaluable b y nuclear medicine 
techniques, immunocytochemistry techniques, tumor markers or other reliable 
measures.   
 
12.3.2  Complete Response  
Disappearance of all evaluable disease.  
 
12.3.3  Partial response  
Partial responses cannot be determined in patients with evaluable disease  
 
12.3.4  Stable Disease (SD)  
That which does not qualify as Complete Response (CR), Partial Response  (PR), 
or Progressive Disease.  
 
12.3.5  Progressive Disease

12.3.6  Overall Best Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined as outlined in Sectio n 
12.7 from a sequence of overall response assessments . 
 
 
12.4 Response Criteria for Neuroblastoma Patients with MIBG Positive Lesions  
Note:  Neuroblastoma patients who do not have MIBG positive lesions or bone 
marrow involvement should be assessed for response  as solid tumor patients with 
measurable or evaluable disease.  
 
12.4.1  MIBG Positive Lesions  
Patients who have a positive MIBG scan at the start of therapy will be evaluable 
for MIBG response. The use of 123I for MIBG imaging is recommended for all 
scans. If the patient has only one MIBG positive lesion and that lesion was 
radiated, a biopsy must be done at least 28 days  after radiation was completed and 
must show viable neuroblastoma.  
 
12.4.2  The following criteria will be used to report MIBG response by t he treating 
institution:  
 
Complete response :  Complete resolution of all MIBG positive lesions  
Partial Response :  Resolution of at least one MIBG positive lesion, with 
persistence of other MIBG positive lesions  
Stable disease :  No change in MIBG scan in number of positive lesions  
Progressive disease : Development of new MIBG positive lesions  
 
12.4.3  The response of MIBG lesions will be assessed on central review using the Curie 
scale as outlined below. Central review responses will be used to assess effica cy 
for study endpoint. See Section 8.2.1  for details on transferring images to the 
Imaging Research Center.  
 
NOTE: This scoring should also be done by the treating institution for end of 
course response assessments.  
 
The body is divided into 9 anatomic sectors for osteomedullary lesions, with a 10th 
general sector allocated for any extra -osseous lesion visible on MIBG scan . In each 
region, the lesions are scored as follows. The absolute extension score is graded 
as:  
0 = no sit e per segment,  
1 = 1 site per segment,  
2 = more than one site per segment,  
3 = massive involvement (>50% of the segment).  
 
The absolute score is obtained by adding the score of all the segments. See 
diagram of sectors below:  
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL 1312  
  
  
Version Date: 06/02/2020   Page 57 
 
 
 
The relative score is calculated by dividing the absolute score at each time point 
by the corresponding pre -treatment absolute score. The relative score of each 
patient is calculated at each response assessment compared to baseline and 
classified as below:  
1. Com plete response: all areas of uptake on MIBG scan completely resolved. 
If morphological evidence of tumor cells in bone marrow biopsy or aspiration 
is present at enrollment, no tumor cells can be detected by routine morphology 
on two subsequent bilateral bo ne marrow aspirates and biopsies done at least 21 
days apart to be considered a Complete Response . 
2. Partial response : Relative score ≤ 0.2 (lesions almost disappeared) to ≤ 0.5 
(lesions strongly reduced).  
3. Stable disease : Relative score > 0.5 (lesions weakly but significantly reduced) 
to 1.0 (lesions not reduced).  
4. Progressive disease : New lesions on MIBG scan.  
 
12.4.4  Overall Best Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis o f treatment effect.  Best response is determined from the sequence of the 
overall response assessments as described in Table 5 in Section 12.7 . 
 
12.5 Response Criteria for Neuroblastoma Patients with Bone Marrow Involvement  
Note:  Neuroblastoma patients who do not have MIBG positive lesions or bone 
marrow involvement should be assessed for response as solid tumor patients with 
measurable or evaluable disease.  
 
12.5.1  Bone Marrow Involvement  
Bone marrow obtained within 14 days prior  to start of protocol therapy  with tumor 
cells seen on routine morphology (not by immunohistochemical  staining only) of 
bilateral aspirate or biopsy on one bone marrow sample.  
 
Bone Marrow responses are determined by H&E Staining of bilateral bone marrow 
biopsies and aspirates.  
 
Complete Response :  No tumor cells detectable by routine morphology on 2 
consecutive bilateral bone marrow aspirates and biopsies 
performed at least 21 days  apart. Normalization of urinary

Version Date: 06/02/2020   Page 58 
 
catecholamines or other tumor markers if el evated at 
study enrollment.  
 
Progressive Disease :  In patients who enroll with neuroblastoma in bone 
marrow by morphology have progressive disease if there 
is a doubling in the amount of tumor in the marrow AND 
a minimum of 25% tumor in bone marrow by 
morp hology. (For example, a patient entering with 5% 
tumor in marrow by morphology must increase to ≥ 25% 
tumor to have progressive disease; a patient entering with 
30% tumor must increase to > 60%).  
 
In patients who enroll without evidence of neuroblastoma 
in bone marrow will be defined as progressive disease if 
tumor is detected in 2 consecutive bone marrow biopsies 
or aspirations done at least 21 days  apart.  
 
 
Stable Disease : Persistence of tumor in bone marrow that does not meet 
the criteria for either complete response or progressive 
disease.  
 
12.5.2  Overall Best Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best resp onse is determined from the sequence of the 
overall response assessments as described in Section 12.7 . 
 
12.6 Response Criteria for Patients with CNS Tumors  
 
12.6.1  Measurable Disease  
Any lesion that is at minimum 10 mm in one dimension on standard MRI or CT, 
for CNS tumors.  
 
12.6.2  Evaluable Disease  
Evaluable disease is defined as at least one lesion, with no lesion that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension. Such lesions may be evaluable by 
nuclear medicine techniques , immunocytochemistry techniques, tumor markers, 
CSF cytology, or other reliable measures.  
 
12.6.3  Selection of Target and Non -Target Lesions  
For most CNS tumors, only one lesion/mass is present and therefore is considered 
a “target” for measurement/follow up to assess for tumor progression/response. If 
multiple measurable lesions are present, up to 5 should be selected as “target” 
lesions. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of size and suitability for 
accurate repeated measurements. All other lesions will be followed as non -target 
lesions. The lower size limit of the target lesion(s) should be at least twice the 
thickness of the slices showing the tumor to decrease the partial volume effect 
(e.g., 8 mm lesion for a 4 mm slice).  
 
Any change in size of non-target lesions should be noted, though does not need to be 
measured.

Version Date: 06/02/2020   Page 59 
 
12.6.4  Response Criteria for Target Lesions  
Response criteria are assessed based on the product of the longest diameter and its 
longest perpendicular diameter. Development of new disease or progression in any 
established lesions is considered progressive disease, regardless of response in 
other lesions – e.g., when multiple lesions show opposite responses, the 
progressive disease takes precedence. Response Criteria for target lesio ns: 
 
• Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions.  
 
• Partial response (PR):  ≥50% decrease in the sum of the products of the two 
perpendicular diameters of all target lesions (up to 5), taking as reference the 
initial baseline measurements.  
 
• Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient decrease in the sum of the products of 
the two perpendicular diameters of all target lesions to qualify for PR, nor 
sufficient increase in a single target lesion to qualify for PD.  
 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  25% or mo re increase in the sum of the products 
of the perpendicular diameters of the target lesion s, taking as reference the 
smallest  sum of the  product s observed since the start of treatment, or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions.  
 
12.6.5  Response Criteria for No n-Target Lesions:  
 
• Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions.  
 
• Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (IR/SD):  The persistence of one or 
more non -target lesions.  
 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  The appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions.  
 
12.6.6  Response criteria for tumor markers (if available):  
Tumor markers will be classified simply as being at normal levels or at abnormally 
high levels.  
 
12.6.7  Overall Response Assessment  
The overall response assessment takes into account response in both target and 
non-target lesions, the appearance of new lesions and normalization of markers 
(where applicable), according to the criteria described in the table b elow. The 
overall response assessment is shown in the last column, and depends on the 
assessments of target, non -target, marker and new lesions in the preceding 
columns.

12.7 from a sequence of overall response assessments.  
  
12.7 Best Response  
 
12.7.1 Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements reco rded since the treatment started).  The 
patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria.

accepted as disease progression.  
Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
reported as “ symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to document 
the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for prog ressive disease the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively 
documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline 
measurements.

13.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting which are required as part of every clinical trial, are 
done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future 
studies usin g similar agents.  Adverse events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times 
during a trial.  (Please follow directions for routine reporting provided in the data collection packet 
for this protocol).  Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to 
allow for optimal monitoring of patient safety and care.  The following sections provide information 
about expedited reporting.  
 
 
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient has  
received an investigational or commercial agent; 2) whether the adverse event is considered serious; 
3) the grade ( severity); and 4) whether or not hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization was 
associated with the event.  
 
An investigational agent  is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New Drug 
Application (IND).  In some instances, the investigational agent may be available commercially, 
but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved package label.  
 
Com mercial agents  are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from a 
commercial source.  The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some occasions 
distribute commercial agents for a trial.  
 
13.1 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event Is To Be Reported In an Expedited Manner  
 
Step 1 : Identify  the type of adverse event using the NCI CTCAE  version 5.0. All 
appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 
5.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can b e downloaded from the CTEP web 
site http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
 
Step 2 :  Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE  version 5.0 . 
 
Step 3 :  Review Table A  in this section to determine if:  
• the adverse event is considered serious;  
• there are any protocol -specific requirements for expedited reporting of specific 
adverse events that require special monitoring ; and/or  
• there are any protocol -specific exceptions  to the reporting requirements.   
 
Note :  This includes all events that occur w ithin 30 days of the last dose of protocol 
treatment.  Any event that occurs more than 30 days after the last dose of 
treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the 
agent(s) must also be reported according to the instructions  in the  table  
below . Attribution categories are as follows:  Unrelated, Unlikely, 
Possible, Probable, and Definite.

FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY  Serious Adverse Events, whether or not 
they are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that r esults in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization for ≥ 24 
hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered serious when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to p revent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA, 
21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST be immediately reported to the NCI via CTEP -
AERS  within the timeframes detailed in the table below.

NOTE:   Protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting of serious adverse events are found in the Specific 
Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER) portion of the CAEPR  below under the section titled 
“Additional Instructions or Exceptions” . 
Expedit ed AE reporting timelines are defined as:  
o “24-Hour; 5 Calendar Days” - The AE must initially be reported via CTEP -AERS  within 24 hours of 
learning of the AE, followed by a complete expedited report within 5 calendar days of the initial 24 -
hour report.  
o “7 Calendar Days” - A complete expedited report on th e AE must be submitted within 7  calendar 
days of learning of the AE.  
1Serious adverse events that occur more than 30 days after the last administration of investigational 
agent/intervention and have an attribution of possible, probable, or definite require reporting as follows:  
Expedited 24 -hour notification followed by com plete report within 5 calendar days for:  
• All Grade 3, 4, and Grade 5 AEs  
Expedited 7  calendar day reports for:  
• Grade 2 AEs resulting in hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
2 For studies using PET or SPECT IND agents, the AE reporting period is  limited to 10 radioactive half -lives, 
rounded UP to the nearest whole day, after the agent/intervention was last administered.  Footnote “1” above 
applies after this reporting period.  
Effective Date:  May 5, 2011  
 
• Any medical event equivalent to CTCAE grade 3, 4, or 5 that precipitates hospitalization (or 
prolongation of existing hospitalization) must be rep orted regardless of attribution and design ation 
as expected or unexpected with t he exception of any events identified as proto col-specific 
expedited  adverse  event  reporting  exclusions.   
• Any event that results in persistent or significant disabilities/incapacities, congenital anomalies, or

Version Date: 06/02/2020   Page 65 
 
birth defects must be reported via CTEP -AERS  if the event occurs following treatment with an 
agent under a CTEP IND.  
 
• Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID provided during trial registration 
on all reports.   
Additional I nstructions or Exceptions to CTEP -AERS  Expedited Reporting Requirements for Phase 1 
Trials Utilizing an Agent under a CTEP -IND or Non -CTEP IND:   
• Any death that occurs more than 30 days after the last dose of treatment with an investigational 
agent that can  be attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent and is not clearly due to 
progressi ve disease  must be reported via CTEP -AERS  for an agent under a CTEP or non -CTEP 
IND agent  per the timelines outlined in the table above.  
 
• Myelosuppression, ( Grade 1 through Grade 4 adverse events as defined in the table below), does 
not require expedited reporting, unless it is associated with hospitalization.

• See also the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER) in Section 9.1.6  of the 
protocol. Additional protocol -specific exceptions to expedited reporting of serious adv erse events 
are the toxicities in bold font listed under the drug information section of the protocol ( Section 9.1 ). 
 
As referenced in the CTEP Adverse Events Reporting Requirements, an AE that resolves and then recurs 
during a subsequent cycle does not require CTEP -AERS  reporting unless (1) the Grade increases; or (2) 
hospitalization is associated with the recurring AE.  
 
13.2 When to Report an Event in an Expedited Manner  
 
• Some adverse events require notification within 24 hours  (refer to Table A ) to NCI via 
the web a t: http://ctep.cancer.gov  call CTEP  at: 301-897-7497  within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the event if the CTEP -AERS  24-Hour Notification web -based 
application is u navailable) and by telephone call to the Study Chair. Once internet 
connectivity is restored, a 24 -hour notification phoned in must be entered electronically 
into CTEP -AERS  by the original submitter at the site.  
 
• When the adverse event requires expedited r eporting, submit the report within 5 or 7 
calendar days  of learning of the event (refer to Table A ). 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL 1312  
  
  
Version Date: 06/02/2020   Page 66 
 
 
• Expedited AE reporting for this study must only use CTEP -AERS  (Adverse Event 
Expedited Reporting System), accessed via the CTEP home page 
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_events.htm
.  
 
13.3 Expedited Reporting Methods  
 
13.3.1  CTEP -AERS  Reporting  
To report adverse events in an expedited fashion use the NCI’s Adverse Event 
Expedited Reporting System ( CTEP -AERS ) that can be found at 
https://ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers/pages /task. 
 
A CTEP -AERS  report must be submitted electronically via the CTEP -AERS  Web-
based application located at https://ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers/pages/task . If 
prompted to enter a sponsor email address, please type in: 
PEPCTNAERS@childrensoncologygroup.org . 
 
Send  supporting documentation to the NCI  by fax (fax # 301 -230-0159) and  by 
email to the ADVL1312 Study -Assigned  Research  Coordinator.  ALWAYS 
include the ticket number on all faxed documents . 
 
13.4 Definition of Onset and Resolution of Adverse Events    
Note:  These guidelines below are for reporting adverse events on the COG data 
submission forms and do not alter the guidelines for CTEP -AERS  reporting.  
 
13.4.1  If an adverse event occurs more than once in a course (cycle) of therapy only the 
most severe grade of the event should be reported . 
 
13.4.2  If an adverse event progresses through several grades during one course of 
therapy, only the most severe grade should be reported.  
 
13.4.3  The duration of the AE is defined as the duration of the highest (most severe) 
grade of the Adver se Effects.  
 
13.4.4  The resolution date of the AE is defined as the date at which the AE returns to 
baseline or less than Grade 1, whichever level is higher  (note that the resolution 
date may therefore be different from the date at which the grade of the AE 
decreased from its highest grade).  If the AE does not return to baseline the 
resolution date should be recorded as "ongoing."   
 
13.4.5  An adverse event that persists from one course to another should only be reported 
once unless the grade becomes more severe in a s ubsequent course. An adverse 
event which resolves and then recurs during a different course, must be reported 
each course it recurs.  
 
 
  
13.5 Other Recipients of Adverse Event Reports  
 
13.5.1  Events that do not meet the criteria for CTEP -AERS  reporting ( Section 13.2 ) 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL 1312  
  
  
Version Date: 06/02/2020   Page 67 
 
should be reported at the end of each cycle using the forms provided in the data 
form packet (See Section 14.1 ). 
 
13.5.2  COG will forward reports and supporting documentation to the Study Chair, to 
the FDA (when COG holds the IND) and to the pharmaceutical company (for 
industry sponsored trials).  
 
13.5.3  Adverse events determined to be reportable must also be reported according to 
the local policy and procedures to the Institutional Review Board responsible  for 
oversight of the patient.  
 
13.6 Reporting Secondary AML/MDS  
All cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that 
occur in patients on NCI -sponsored trials following their chemotherapy for cancer must be 
reported to the Investig ational Drug Branch (IDB) of the NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation 
Program (CTEP) via CTEP -AERS  and included as part of the second malignant neoplasm 
reporting requirements for this protocol (see data submission packet).  Submit the 
completed CTEP -AERS  report within 14 days of an AML/MDS diagnosis occurring after 
treatment for cancer on NCI -sponsored trials.  
 
 Secondary Malignancy :  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent 
under an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP -AERS . Three options are available to 
describe the event:  
1) Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy  (e.g., acute myelocytic 
leukemia [AML])   
2) Myelodysplastic syndrome  (MDS)  
3) Treatment -related secondary malignancy.  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also 
be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
Second Malignancy :  
A second malignancy  is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is 
NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONLY 
routine reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified.  
 
13.7 Reporting Pregnancy, Pregnancy Loss , and Death Neonata l 
When submitting CTEP -AERS  reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, or “Neonatal 
loss”, the Pregnancy Information Form should be completed and faxed along with any 
additional medical information to (301) 230 -0159  and also emailed to the ADVL1312 
Study -Assigned  Research Coordinator . The potential risk of exposure of the fetus to the 
investigational agent should be documented in the “Description of Event” section of the 
CTEP -AERS  report.  
13.7.1  Pregnancy  
• Patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exp osure of the 
fetus to agents that may be teratogenic. For this reason, pregnancy 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY . ADVL 1312  
  
  
Version Date: 06/02/2020   Page 68 
 
occurring on study or within 6 months following the last dose of study 
therapy should be reported in an expedited manner via CTEP -AERS  as 
“Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other (Pregnancy) 
under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions  System Organ 
Class  (SOC ) and reported as Grade 3.  
• Pregnancy should  be followed until the outcome is known.  If the baby is 
born with a birth defect or anomaly, then a se cond CTEP -AERS report is 
required.  
 
13.7.2  Pregnancy Loss  (Fetal Death)  
• Pregnancy loss is defined in CTCAE version 5.0 as “Death in utero.”  
 
• Any pregnancy loss  should be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 
“Pregnancy loss ” under the “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions ” SOC. Do NOT report a pregnancy loss as a Grade 5 event 
since CTEP -AERS recognized any Grade 5 event as a patient death.  
 
13.7.3  Death Neonatal  
• Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE version 5.0 as “ Newborn deaths 
occurring during the first 28 days after birth ” that is felt by the 
investigator to be at least possibly due to the investigational 
agent/intervention, should be reported expeditiously.  
 
• A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously as “Death neonatal” 
under the  “general disorders and administration” SOC when the death is 
the result of a patient pregnancy or pregnancy in partners of men on 
study . 
 
• Do NOT report a neonatal death resulting from a patient pregnancy or 
pregnancy in partners of men as a Grade 5 event since CTEP -AERS 
recognizes any Grade 5 event as a patient death.  
 
Pregnancy should be followed up until the outcome of the pregnancy is known at intervals 
deemed appropriate by her physicians. The “Pregnancy Information Form” should be used 
for all necess ary follow -ups. This form is available at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/PregnancyRepo

14.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
Data and safety is ensured by several integrated components including the COG Data and 
Safety Monitoring Committee.  
 
14.4.1  Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  
This study will be monitored in accordance with the Children’s Oncology Group 
policy for data and safety monitoring of Phase 1 and 2 studies. In brief, the role of 
the COG Data and Safety Monitoring Committee is to protect the interests of 
patients and the  scientific integrity for all Phase 1 and 2 studies. The DSMC 
consists of a chair; a statistician external to COG; one external member; one 
consumer representative; the lead statistician of the PEP-CTN  scientific 
committee; and a member from the NCI. The D SMC meets at least every 6 months 
to review current study results, as well as data available to the DSMC from other 
related studies. Approximately 6 weeks before each meeting of the Phase 1 and 2 
DSMC, study chairs will be responsible for working with the study statistician to 
prepare study reports for review by the DSMC. The DSMC will provide 
recommendations to the COG PEP-CTN  Chair and the Group Chair for each study 
reviewed to change the study or to continue the study unchanged. Data and Safety 
Committee  reports for institutional review boards can be prepared using the public 
data monitoring report as posted on the COG Web site.  
 
14.4.2  Monitoring by the Study Chair and Developmental Therapeutics Leadership  
The study chair will monitor the study regularly and e nter evaluations of patients’ 
eligibility, evaluability, and dose limiting toxicities into the study database. In 
addition, study data and the study chair’s evaluations will be reviewed by the COG 
PEP-CTN Chair, Vice Chair and Statistician on a weekly conf erence call.

APPENDIX VI :  PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR TREATING DIARRHEA  
 
Guidelines for the Treatment of Diarrhea  
 
Institutional practice may be used in place of these guidelines.  
 
Early diarrhea  
Early onset diarrhea associated with irinotecan is usually preceded by sweating and abdominal cramping. 
Patients who have the onset of these symptoms followed by diarrhea within several hours after taking 
irinotecan should conta ct the treating physician immediately.  The treating physician may consider 
treatment with atropine. If symptoms do not improve with administration of atropine, treatment for late 
diarrhea (as outlined below) should be started.  
 
Late diarrhea (more than 24 hours after the administration of the first dose of irinotecan)  
Each family will be instructed to have antidiarrheal medication available and begin treatment at the first 
episode of poorly formed or loose stools or the earliest onset of bowel movem ents more frequent than 
normally expected for the patient. Patients will also be instructed to contact their physician if any diarrhea 
occurs. Patients will be given loperamide based on body weight.  
 
Be aware of your child's bowel movements. At the first sign they become softer than usual or if your child 
has any notable increase in the number of bowel movements over what is normal for him/her, begin taking 
loperamide ( Imodium ). If he/she does not start taking the loperamide right away, the diarrhea may 
become severe and last several days or require hospitalization.  
 
Please follow these directions carefully, using dosing guidelines below:  
• Take _____________ at the first sign of diarrhea.  
• Continue taking  __________   every 2 hours until the diarrhea slows or the  normal pattern of bowel 
movements returns. Repeat the same doses and frequency if the diarrhea returns.  
• Do not exceed ___________ in a 24 hour period.  
• Please call your doctor if you have any questions about taking loperamide, if your child's diarrhea 
is not under  control after two days, or if he/she is feeling extremely weak, lightheaded, or dizzy.  
• Make an extra effort to give your child lots of fluids (several glasses of pedialyte, fruit juices, soda, 
soup, etc.) while your child is participating in this study.  
• Side effects may include tiredness, drowsiness or dizziness. If your child experiences these side 
effects, or if your child is urinating less frequently than usual, please contact your child's physician.  
• Do not give your child any laxatives without consulti ng with his/her physician.  
 
Loperamide dosing recommendations for late diarrhea (maximum dose of Loperamide for adults is 16 
mg/day):

APPENDIX IX -B: PD SAMPLE COLLECTION  GUIDELINES  
 
Required Items : 
 
- Whole blood collection at required PD time points as outlined in Appendix IX -A 
- Smart Tubes at room temperature (one per incubation condition): will be provided by study team  
- Water bath pre-warmed to 37 °C 
- -80°C freezer or dried ice  
- Complete RPMI (optional)  
 
Protocol:  
 
1. Use an approved tube containing sodium heparin (ie. green top Vacutainer) to collect PD sample.  
Ensure good mixing with the anticoagulant by inverting the securely capped t ube at least 6 times.  
Begin incubation of the blood with the Smart Tube system as soon as possible, ideally within two 
hours of the blood draw.  Keep the blood at room temperature until it is assayed with the Smart 
Tube system.  
 
2. Add 1 milliliter (ml) of t he whole blood sample to each Smart Tube.  Immediately cap the Smart 
Tube and vortex or invert six times to ensure good mixing with the agents added.   
 
3. Place the Smart Tubes in the 37°C water bath for 30 minutes.  
 
4. At the end of the 30 minutes incubation t ime remove the Smart Tubes from the water bath and 
activate the Smart Tubes manually.  To activate a Smart Tube manually, make sure the cap is 
screwed on securely and then bend the Smart Tube in the middle until you feel the ampoule 
inside break, then inve rt the Smart Tube 10 times to ensure good mixing (gently shaking the 
Smart Tube up and down 10 times is an acceptable alternative to inverting it 10 times).  
 
5. Incubate the activated Smart Tubes at room temperature for 8 minutes.  
 
6. Immediately transfer the Smart Tubes to a -80°C freezer or place in direct contact with dry ice.  
The Smart Tubes should be stored at -80°C until the sample is analyzed.  Samples frozen in 
Smart Tubes should not be stored at temperatures warmer than -80°C.   Smart Tubes have not 
been validated for storage in liquid nitrogen. Samples will be stored at -80°C and shipped when 
all PD time points have been collected. Tubes need to be shipped on dry ice. All samples should 
be shipped to address as outlined in section 8.4.3 . Samples should NOT be shipped on a Friday or 
before a holiday.

Title 
A prospective, multi-center, randomized, cross-over  study to assess the effect of norgestrel 75 mcg on  
cervical mucus and ovarian activity during perfect use, after one delayed intake and after a missed pi ll. 
 
Investigator(s), Study site(s) 
2 clinical sites in the United States (US): Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon and 
University of California Davis Health, Sacramento, California  
 
Phase:  IIa 
 
Indication 
Oral contraception  
 
Objectives: 
Primary objective 
• To determine the effect on cervical mucus score of  a delayed intake of 6 hours or of a missed 
pill of norgestrel 75 mcg compared to the effect ob served during reported perfect daily use  
 
Subordinate primary objective 
• To estimate the duration of the protective effect of cervical mucus after last pill intake of 
norgestrel 75 mcg during reported perfect use 
 
Secondary objectives 
• To evaluate and compare the percentage of subjects  with a protective cervical mucus score 
during reported perfect daily use, during a treatme nt period with a delayed intake of 6 hours and 
during a treatment period with a missed pill of nor gestrel 75 mcg.   
• To evaluate and compare the ovarian activity durin g reported perfect daily use, during a 
treatment period with a delayed intake of 6 hours a nd during a treatment period with a missed 
pill of norgestrel 75 mcg.  
• To assess if a combination of cervical mucus score  and ovarian status can be considered as a 
measure of protection from conception during report ed perfect daily use, during a treatment 
period with a delayed intake of 6 hours and during a treatment period with a missed pill of 
norgestrel 75 mcg. 
• To determine levonorgestrel pharmacokinetics after  a single dose of norgestrel 75 mcg, at 
steady state, after a delayed intake of 6 hours and  after a missed pill.   
• To assess the safety of norgestrel 75 mcg taken da ily for 12 weeks. 
 
Study design 
This is an exploratory, prospective, multi-center, randomized, cross-over study to assess the effect o f 
norgestrel 75 mcg on cervical mucus and ovarian act ivity during reported perfect daily use, after a 
delayed intake of 6 hours and after a missed pill.  
 
Study subject participation will be approximately 4 .5 months long (up to one month for screening, thre e 
28-day treatment periods, up to 12 days of follow-u p and up to 5 days for the end of study visit (EOS)  
after the last pill intake or follow-up visit) (see  Figure 1 below).

Adverse events  (AEs) 
AEs will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary.  
Frequencies of subjects (occurrence rate) with trea tment-emergent AEs, regardless of relationship to 
study treatment and sorted by system organ class an d preferred term will be summarized.  
Frequencies of subjects with possible treatment-rel ated AEs will also be displayed. Serious and non-
serious possibly-related AEs will be described on a  case by case basis and the relationship with the 
treatment intake will be discussed.  
Frequency tables of AEs, displayed by intensity wil l also be provided.  
 
Study Duration and dates 
Subjects will be evaluated for a period of approxim ately 4.5 months (screening up to 1 month, treatmen t 
phase 3 months, extra follow-up and end of study vi sit up to 16 days).  
Besides the screening visit, a total of approximate ly 28 visits will be required for this study but 4- 7 
additional visits per menstrual cycle may be requir ed if an ovarian follicle of ≥ 15mm in one dimension 
is visualized on TVUS.   
 
Subject recruitment is expected to begin in Q2 2018  and is planned to continue through the beginning 
of Q1 2019.

1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
 
Oral contraceptives (OCs) are the most widely used hormonal method of contraception in the United 
States (US). Combined estrogen-progestin OCs (COCs)  are the most frequently-prescribed OCs in the 
US, while progestin-only pills (POPs) are less freq uently prescribed. POPs are mainly prescribed to 
breastfeeding women or when the use of a COC is con tra-indicated.  
 
POPs prevent conception by suppressing ovulation in  approximately half of the cycles in users, 
thickening the cervical mucus to inhibit sperm pene tration, lowering the midcycle LH and FSH peaks, 
slowing the movement of the ovum through the fallop ian tubes, and altering the endometrium (McCann 
1994). 
 
Because of the lower dose of progestin in POPs comp ared to the dose in COCs, the reliance on 
mechanisms of action other than ovulation inhibitio n, and the potential importance of consistent daily  
pill taking, POPs are perceived to be not as effect ive as COCs. However, when used as directed, POPs 
seem to be as highly effective as a COC, with a per fect-use failure rate estimated at 0.3% and a typic al 
use failure rate estimated at 9% (Trussell, 2011; C urtis, 2016). A recent Cochrane review concluded 
that no firm conclusion is possible concerning the comparative efficacy of POPs or whether such pills 
are as effective as COCs (Grimes A, 2013). 
 
 
Opill ® (norgestrel (NG) 75 mcg) is a 2nd  generation synthetic progestin-only oral contracep tive approved 
in the US in 1973, (under the proprietary name Ovre tte ®) at a daily dose of 75 mcg and first marketed 
in 1974 in the US. NG is a mixture of two enantiome rs, only one of which levonorgestrel (LNG) being 
the active form. LNG have been marketed in the US a nd in Europe for more than 30 years in a wide 
variety of contraceptive products (including combin ed and progestin-only oral contraceptives, implant,  
vaginal ring, intrauterine system, and emergency co ntraceptives)..  
  
Approval for marketing in the US by the Food and Dr ug Administration (FDA) was based upon the 
results of eight clinical trials of continuous dail y oral NG 75 mcg. The study sites represented all m ajor 
US geographic regions and participants were 53% Cau casian and 47% African-American. There was 
a combined 2 575 women, of whom 2 173 completed at least one cycle of medication (28 days), and 
21 856  28-day cycles of exposure in women aged 15 to 49 years. Thirty-seven pregnancies were 
confirmed during the eight clinical investigations,  resulting in an overall use effectiveness (Pearl I ndex) 
of 2.0 pregnancies per 100 women-years of use.  Eig hteen pregnancies were confirmed to be a result 
of method failure and 19 pregnancies occurred among  women who omitted 1 or more pills during the 
cycle in which the conception took place. The theor etical use effectiveness rate among women 
experiencing a method failure therefore has a Pearl  Index of 0.98 per 100 women-years (N = 2 173; 21 
854 cycles; 1 821 women-years). 
 
As with other POPs, Opill ® has only few contra-indications, the most relevant  is having history of breast 
cancer. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the  US Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive 
Use, 2016, list “current breast cancer” as the sing le condition that represents an unacceptable health  
risk (category 4) for a woman if she uses POPs. Onl y a few other conditions are listed for which the u se 
of POPs is not usually recommended unless other, mo re appropriate, methods are not available. The 
main adverse reactions consist in the disturbance o f the menstrual cycles, and other few and moderate 
hormonal reactions such as delayed follicular atres ia or ovarian cysts. 
 
 
2. RATIONALE, BENEFITS AND RISKS 
 
NG, as with other POPs, is currently prescribed wit h the advice that it should be taken without 
interruption every day at the same time to achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness. Any pill taken  
more than 3 hours late is considered a missed pill due to diminishing effects on cervical mucus (Han L  
2017).  
Protocol: 151042-002   CONFIDENTIAL-PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 18/80   It has also been emphasized that the effect of prog estins on cervical mucus is the most immediate leve l 
of protection provided by POPs, but offering a full  protection for less than 24 hours (McCann 1994). 
In fact, there are only very few studies assessing the PK of oral NG/LNG for use as POP and no data 
linking the PK to the pharmacodynamic (PD) action o f POPs. In one study where five subjects were 
given a single dose of 30 mcg LNG (Weiner 1976), th e mean plasma half-life was 13.7 hours with large 
variability between subjects (7.95 to 23.23 hours).  Twenty four hours after drug intake, the plasma 
concentrations were 0.05 to 0.14 ng/mL. The plasma levels observed in 3 subjects taking 30 mcg LNG 
daily for 3 weeks were between 0.10 and 0.40 ng/mL when measured 12 hours after the oral 
administration each day during the 3-week treatment  period. Brenner et al. (1977) found that serum 
levels of LNG were 0.2 to 0.5 ng/mL 24 hours after oral administration of 75 mcg NG.  
 
In addition, there are very few clinical data asses sing the temporality of the effect of POPs on cervi cal 
mucus. In healthy women given 350 mcg of norgestrie none for 13 days, cervical mucus displayed 
changes in its macromolecular structure, i.e. an ex treme degree of compactness, an appearance typical 
of the late luteal phase (Chretien et al. 1980). Th e cervical mucus remained extremely dense 24 hours 
after the last dose of norgestrienone but, 12 hours  later, few samples exhibited meshes large enough 
to permit the easy passage of sperm cells and, 48 h ours after the last dose mucus was considered as 
not protective. Lebech et al. (1970) found that spe rm penetration of the cervical mucus was totally 
inhibited in 3 out of 4 subjects treated with 0.5 m g/day megestrol acetate but returned to normal 
38 hours after the ingestion of the last dose. Howe ver, interpretation of the results of these continu ous 
low-dose progestogen contraceptive studies is hampe red by the small sample sizes, the incomplete 
description of the methodology, and the absence of statistical analysis and it is not known whether su ch 
results can be extrapolated to NG 75 mcg.  
 
Regarding ovarian activity, it was shown that 75 mc g NG daily for 30 days inhibited or suppressed LH 
and FSH peaks and the rise of serum progesterone (P 4) and urinary pregnanediol during the luteal 
phase, suggesting that even if there was follicular  rupture, this was associated with luteal insuffici ency 
(Moghissi and Marks, 1971). In another study where 29 subjects received 30 mcg LNG daily, an 
ovulation defined as follicular rupture associated with P4 level above 30 nmol/L was observed in 28% 
of all studied 57 cycles (Rice CF, 1999). However, there is no study analysing both ovarian activity a nd 
cervical mucus in women treated with NG and no data  are available regarding the effect of delayed or 
missed pill on these parameters.  
 
In the light of limited PK and PD data on NG and PO Ps in general that supports the clinical guidance o f 
taking it everyday at the same time within a three hour window, this exploratory study aims to determi ne 
the PD mechanisms underlying the contraceptive prot ection of NG 75 mcg. Primarily, the study will 
evaluate whether these PD mechanisms are impacted b y a delayed intake or a missed pill. 
 
The main PD endpoints will be the cervical mucus as sessed according to the WHO guidelines excluding 
the volume component as already described (Dunson e t al, 1998; Petta et al, 1998) and the ovarian 
activity measured with a Ovarian Activity Score (OA S) (see Appendix 3).  
 
 
3. OBJECTIVES 
 
The primary objective of the study is to determine the effect of a delayed intake of 6 hours or of a m issed 
pill on cervical mucus score compared to cervical m ucus score during reported perfect daily use of 
norgestrel 75 mcg.  
 
The subordinate primary objective is to estimate th e duration of the protective effect of cervical muc us 
after last pill intake of norgestrel 75 mcg during reported perfect use. 
The protective effect of cervical mucus is consider ed as present when the score is below or equal 4.

  Page 19/80   The secondary objectives are: 
• to evaluate and compare the percentage of subjects  with a protective cervical mucus score 
during reported perfect daily use of norgestrel 75 mcg, during a treatment period with a delayed 
intake of 6 hours and during a treatment period wit h a missed pill of norgestrel 75 mcg.   
• To evaluate and compare the ovarian activity durin g reported perfect daily use, during a 
treatment period with a delayed intake of 6 hours a nd during a treatment period with a missed 
pill of norgestrel 75 mcg.  
• To assess if a combination of cervical mucus score  and ovarian status can be considered as a 
measure of protection from conception during report ed perfect daily use, during a treatment 
period with a delayed intake of 6 hours and during a treatment period with a missed pill of 
norgestrel 75 mcg.  
• To determine levonorgestrel pharmacokinetics after  a single dose of norgestrel 75 mcg, at

4. STUDY DESIGN 
 
This is an exploratory, prospective, multi-center, randomized, cross-over study to assess the effect o f 
norgestrel 75 mcg on cervical mucus and ovarian act ivity during reported perfect daily use and after a  
delayed intake of 6 hours and after a missed pill.  
 
This study includes three 28-day treatment periods (approximately 3 months) with a screening period 
of up to 1 month to demonstrate ovulatory status pr ior to enrollment, a possible follow-up of 12 days to 
follow ovarian activity if a follicle ≥ 15 mm is observed at the end of period 3 and an en d of study (EOS) 
visit within 5 days. Women of reproductive age (18- 35 years old) who meet eligibility requirements wil l 
receive treatment for a total of three 28-day perio ds (84 days) but in treatment period 2 and 3, will have 
a 6-hour delay in pill intake or a missed pill (see  Figure 2  below).  
 
Figure 2 Design of the study 
 
 
Besides the screening visit, a total of approximate ly 28 visits will be required for this study but up  to 7 
additional visits per menstrual cycle (up to 3 in t reatment periods 1 & 2, up to 7 in treatment period  3) 
may be required if an ovarian follicle of ≥ 15mm in one dimension is visualized on TVUS.   
 
The study is designed to evaluate cervical mucus at tributes, ovarian activity and PK of LNG after dail y 
treatment by norgestrel 75 mcg as well as the PK an d PD changes that ensue with poor regimen 
adherence.  
 
In the first treatment period, treatment will be in stalled and cervical mucus attributes and ovarian a ctivity 
in the first weeks of treatment will be observed. I n addition, PK profile of LNG will be determined af ter 
a single dose (Day 1) and at steady state (on week 3). 
 
In the second and third periods of treatment, the d ifference on cervical mucus score and ovarian activ ity 
score between a perfect use (Day 41 ± 3 / Day 69 ± 3) and a 6-hour delayed intake (Arm A Day 42 ± 3 
and Arm B Day 70 ± 3) or a missed pill (Arm B Day 4 3 ± 3 and Arm A Day 71) will be assessed.

Two investigational research centers located in the  US will conduct the study. A complete list of 
investigators, sub-investigators, and coordinators will be maintained with trial documentation. 
 
Listed here are the investigational research center s conducting this study: 
• Alison Edelman, MD, MPH: Oregon Health & Science U niversity, Portland, Oregon 
• Mitchell Creinin, MD: University of California Dav is Health, Sacramento, California 
 
 
6. SUBJECT RECRUITMENT 
 
Participants will be recruited from two research ce nters in the US. Competitive recruitment will be 
planned between the two centers. Each center will e nroll a minimum of 20 subjects  but the total number 
of completers should reach at least 45 subjects.  
 
Subjects will be recruited from family planning cli nics and other clinics serving reproductive-aged 
women for gynecologic care and reproductive health services (including the clinics’ database) as well 
as through IRB-approved research recruitment effort s (newsletters, in-services, tear-ads, radio ads, 
social network ads, online form etc). Referrals fro m previous / ongoing participants are accepted. Thi s 
study will be listed on the website ClinicalTrials. gov (see section 21.1). Subjects will be selected f or the 
study according to the inclusion and exclusion crit eria detailed in section 9.  
 
Information collected before signature of the infor med consent form (ICF), if used, will be stored in a 
locked office, with access limited to study staff. For subjects electing to enroll in the study, this 
information will become a part of their protected r esearch record. For subjects choosing not to enroll , 
all protected health information (PHI) will be stor ed confidentially with the research study informati on in 
a locked cabinet and archived with other study-spec ific documents at the closure of the trial. 
Confidentiality of PHI will be maintained according  to regulations and sites’ procedures.    
 
Women will be screened for eligibility and  interest in study participation. If they meet the b asic criteria 
and agree to participate, they will be required to provide informed written consent prior to beginning  any 
study procedures. The protocol and patient informat ion sheet/ ICF will be reviewed and approved by 
the IRB prior to initiation of the study. Informati on collected and created in order to conduct and ov ersee 
this research study may be stored according to regu lation, sites’ procedures and with the agreement of  
the participant.  
 
 
7. STUDY DURATION 
 
The total duration of the study for each participan t is expected to be approximately 4.5 months: up to  4 
weeks for screening to meet enrollment criteria, 12  weeks of treatment and a possible follow-up of 12 
days to follow ovarian activity if a follicle ≥ 15 mm is observed at the end of period 3 and an EO S visit 
within 5 days. 
 
Subject recruitment is expected to begin Q2 2018 an d is planned to continue through the beginning of 
Q1 2019. However, if the enrollment rate declines, the enrollment period may be extended beyond this 
date. If this enrollment timeline is met, all subje cts should finish active treatment by approximately  the 
end of Q2 2019. Therefore, the total duration of th e study will be approximately 15 months for each 
study site.  
 
Results of the study are expected to be available Q 3 2019.

Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 21/80   8. SAMPLE SIZE/NUMBER OF SUBJECTS 
 
Approximately 70 subjects will be screened to have at least 45 subjects who complete the study.  
 
The primary analysis is based on the score of cervi cal mucus as a quantitative variable because it is 
expected to be the most powerful analysis. However the justification of the sample size will not be ba sed 
on the primary analysis because too much informatio n is missing such as an order of magnitude of the 
variance covariance matrix of the change from time point of reference. This is the reason why the 
sample size calculation will be based on proportion s of women with no loss of protection.   
 
A total sample size of 45 subjects should allow to detect a loss of protection that affect pertinently  a 
substantial proportion of the population. Indeed if  the difference between a cycle with a perfect use and 
a cycle with an infringement in the schedule is 14 % in the expected proportions of women with a loss 
of protection at any time and if the proportion of discordances between the 2 situations is 17% then t he 
exact power is equal to 79.1%. If the expected diff erence in proportions is 15% with a rate of 
discordance of 18% then the exact power is 82.4% fo r an unconditional test. The expected difference 
in proportions need therefore to reach 14-15 % to g et a sufficient power for detecting a significant 
difference. This difference in proportions is a sub stantial difference knowing that most of change in 
status (see discordance rate) are in the same direc tion i.e. from protection to loss of protection.

12.3 Dosage schedule  
The first dose will be taken at 9:00 am ± 3 hours d uring V1 1 (enrollment visit) while the subject is present 
at the study site.  
At V1 1, she will also choose, with the site, her treatmen t time (T) starting on Day 2 for all the rest of th e 
study (3 treatment periods).  
This treatment time should be: 
• same every day (± 1.5 hours) except the day of V2 R and V3 R (DMP period, see section 14.3.2. 
and 14.4.2) 
• between 6:00 am and 12:00 pm

On V2 R-1 and V3 R-1, the subject will come on site to take her daily p ill at 9:00 am ± 1 hour (T2/3 R-1) 
during the scheduled study visit. She will also com e to site at V2/3 R and V2/3 R+1  to take/miss her pill 
according to the site’s instructions. 
NB: at time of summer and winter time change, speci fic schedule has to be followed: 
• If the day of time change is within 2 days before the first day of DMP period (V2 R-1 or V3 R-1), the 
subject will be asked to take her pill between 8:00  am and 10:00, for the two days before DMP 
period. 
• If the day of time change is on the 2nd  or 3rd  day of the DMP period, the subject will take on si te 
her pill according to the site’s instructions, with out taking account of the time change (i.e. at the 
“old” time).

Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 25/80   In case of missed study pills (with the exception t o DMP periods): If one dose is missed, it should be  
taken as soon as it is remembered and at the latest  at the time of the next dosing, thus allowing a 
subject to take two doses within 24 hours. The even t will have to be reported to the study staff at th e 
next visit. 
If more than one consecutive dose is missed, the su bject should contact the site for dosing instructio ns. 
The subject will be advised to take only the most r ecently missed pill, at the latest at the time of t he next 
dosing, and to leave the other missed pills in the blister.  
 
In any case, she will be reminded to use a non-horm onal back-up method of contraception (such as 
condoms or spermicides) for the next 48 hours. 
 
In case of diarrhea and/or vomiting: if a subject h as diarrhea and/or vomiting within 4 hours after ta king 
a pill, another pill should be taken as soon as pos sible on the same day and the event reported to the  
study staff at the next visit.  
 
In case of lost blister: if a subject loses a blist er, she should call the site to be instructed eithe r to use 
the extra blister she was provided with or to come back to the site for a new blister if necessary. 
 
12.4 Treatment dispensation  
 
Prior to dispensing the study medication, the inves tigator or designee will record the site number and  
subject’s study identification number on the medica tion box label, and the subject’s study identificat ion 
number on the blister. The investigator or designee  will record the amount dispensed and date of 
dispensation in the investigational study medicatio n accountability log. 
 
Subjects should be instructed to bring back both us ed and unused blister packs to the site at each vis it 
so that remaining pill accountability can be perfor med. All unused, partially/fully used blister packs  
should be retained by the site at the end of each t reatment period for study medication accountability . 
Each participant will be provided with a total of 4  medication boxes containing 1 blister of 28 tablet s 
each, i.e. one for each of the 3 treatment periods and one for back-up. Two boxes will be provided at 
the start of treatment period 1 (one to be used in treatment period 1 and one to be used as back-up if  
necessary), one at the end of treatment period 1, a nd one at the end of treatment period 2. 
 
12.5 Investigational product accountability  
Each study site is required to maintain study recor ds of the disposition of study medication, includin g 
dates and quantities of distribution by subject ID number, and initials of the research center personn el 
distributing the study product. Study accountabilit y logs will be provided for this purpose. 
Study medication will be shipped to each research c enter after the receipt and acceptance of all 
necessary regulatory documents. Upon receipt of stu dy medication, an inventory of the study 
medication must be completed by the Investigator (o r designee). All study medication dispensed and 
returned must be recorded as outlined above. All do sing records must be consistent with the study 
accountability logs. 
 
12.6 Storage 
Study medication will be stored at the designated r esearch sites in a dry place at the study site at r oom 
temperature ( ≥15 ⁰C [59 ⁰F] and ≤25 ⁰C [77 ⁰F]) under controlled and secured conditions, in a l ocked 
storage area away from sunlight to avoid temperatur e fluctuations. A temperature log for the 
investigational product storage area must be mainta ined for the duration of the study.

  Page 26/80   12.7 Disposal/return 
 
At the end of the study, the monitor will complete a final accountability of all clinical supplies, in cluding 
used and unused medication boxes. Once accountabili ty is completed, remaining study product will be 
shipped back to the sponsor or its designee.  
 
12.8 Compliance 
 
Subjects will be instructed to bring their study me dication pack at each visit. Compliance will be 
assessed by monitoring of norgestrel pill packs dur ing these visits as well as at the end of each 
treatment period and by information recorded by the  e-diary.   
 
During the DMP periods, the 6-hour delayed intake w ill be directly observed by study staff and the 
missed pill will be removed from the blister by sit e staff and placed in a small container (clear bag,  small 
box, etc) labeled with subject number, period, date  of removal in order for the CRA to monitor the 
accountability.  
 
Subjects will report pill intake (yes/no) daily and  the time through e-diary.   
 
Levonorgestrel plasma levels will be determined dur ing the first visit of weeks 5 and 9 at the time of  
cervical mucus collection  without informing the su bject of the exact date (see section 14.Study Visit  for 
details). Letting the subject know that they will h ave a blood sample to check the levonorgestrel leve l, 
at some point in the study may encourage them to st ay compliant. 
 
If a subject missed three or more consecutive pills  in any treatment period or misses one pill in trea tment 
period 2 or 3, the research center staff will discu ss the matter with her and determine with the spons or, 
case by case, whether she can continue moving forwa rd in the study or if she has to be withdrawn from 
the study.  
 
 
13. LABORATORY TESTS AND EVALUATIONS 
 
13.1 Physical and gynecological examination 
 
Physical and gynecological examinations (breast and  pelvic examinations) will be performed at 
screening visit only. 
 
13.2 Vital signs

Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 27/80   Samples will be analyzed at the local certified lab oratories at each study center.  
 
The investigator or medically qualified designee mu st review and sign all laboratory reports; a copy o f 
the report must be kept with each subject’s chart. All out-of-range laboratory results must be assesse d 
by the investigator or medically qualified designee  for clinical significance. Any reports required fr om 
the screening assessment must be reviewed, signed a nd dated on or before the date/time of enrollment 
in order to properly document the determination of eligibility. 
 
13.4 Hormone testing 
 
Hormone testing (P4, E2, FSH, LH) will be performed  locally at each site.  
 
P4 will be tested at all visits up to EOS visit, wi th the exception of V2 R and V3 R during the DMP periods. 
 
E2, FSH and LH will be tested at all regular visits , extra visits and follow-up visits until a postovu latory 
image is observed, with the exception of V2 R and V3 R during the DMP periods. 
 
The samples will be destroyed after completion of C SR. 
 
Point of care urine high-sensitivity pregnancy test ing will be performed at V1 1 (enrollment visit) before 
dispensation of study drug and at the EOS visit.  
 
13.5 Levonorgestrel concentrations 
 
Blood sampling for levonorgestrel concentrations wi ll be performed at the following visits: 
• V1 1 
• 1st  visit of week 3 
• 1st  visit of week 5 (V2 1) 
• V2 R-1, V2 R, V2 R+1  
• 1st  visit of week 9 (V3 1) 
• V3 R-1, V3 R, V3 R+1  
 
2K- EDTA tubes will be used for sampling. After sep aration of plasma, samples will be frozen at -80°C 
until shipment to the bioanalytical centre that wil l perform centralized analysis of the samples from both 
clinical sites. Levonorgestrel concentrations in pl asma will be determined by a LC-MS/MS method. 
 
13.6 Pap test and STI screening  
 
A Pap test will be performed at screening for subje cts with an abnormal cervical lesion detected durin g 
the gynecological examination. Subjects with high-g rade lesions prior to enrollment are to be excluded . 
 
Subjects will be screened for Chlamydia and gonorrh ea by vaginal or cervical swab or urine test and 
results will be read on site in accordance with loc al standards. A wet mount should be obtained if 
vaginitis is suspected. Women who test positive sho uld be treated for any infections and enrollment 
should be delayed until treatment has been complete d.  
 
If a non-physiologic vaginal discharge is detected,  diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis will be made usin g 
wet mount and potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation . Treatment should be instituted and completed 
prior to enrolment in the study for those who were diagnosed at screening. For the subjects who develo p 
bacterial vaginosis during the treatment, oral trea tment will be instituted and the subjects will rema in in 
the study. 
 
13.7 Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) 
 
TVUS will be performed at screening, at all regular  and extra visits until a postovulatory image is 
observed, with the exception of V2 R and V3 R during the DMP periods.

Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 28/80   TVUS examinations will be performed by licensed and  trained study personnel. Standard 
measurements will include documentation of the larg est follicle’s maximum measurements in 3 
dimensions and average size if it is ≥10 mm, postovulatory image 1 and TVUS abnormalities. A cross-
sectional picture of each ovary even if no follicle s >10 mm are present will also be taken.  
 
To maintain a high level of consistency for these e valuations, it is recommended that an experienced 
sonographer perform the scans on each subject, and the number be limited to the smallest group 
needed by the site for successful completion of the  protocol. 
 
All ultrasounds procedures should be performed usin g a vaginal transducer of at least 5 mHz. 
The ultrasound equipment must be capable of printin g the images or saving them digitally for later 
printing. Printed images will be placed in the sour ce documents. All images should be clearly labeled 
with a subject identifier and date the TVUS was per formed. 
 
13.8 Cervical mucus 
 
Cervical mucus will be sampled and analysed at all regular and extra visits, including all the visits during 
the DMP period. The cervical mucus collection will always be performed before TVUS. 
 
A gynecologic exam is completed to assess the cervi cal mucus score based on the modified Insler 
score (WHO manual 2010). Consistency (viscosity), f erning, spinnbarkeit and cellularity will be scored  
on a 4-point scale (0-3), see Appendix 2 for detail s. 
The protective effect of cervical mucus is consider ed as present when the score is below or equal 4. 
 
The cervical mucus will be collected by aspiration.  The cervical mucus assessment will be made by a 
limited amound of trained clinic personnel in order  to limit variability. A centralized training will be 
organized to maintain a high level of consistency f or these evaluations. It is recommended that an 
experienced physician or specifically trained nurse  (whoever is available on site at the time of subje ct 
visit) perform the exam on each subject, and the nu mber of examiners be limited to the smallest group 
needed by the site for successful completion of the  protocol. 
 
13.9 IMP intake and bleeding reporting (e-diary) 
 
Every day, the subject will have to record the time  of intake of study medication and the volume of 
bleedings if any in an e-diary: 
 
 
14. STUDY VISITS 
 
14.1 Screening visit (V0, during luteal phase)  
 
The purpose of the screening evaluation is to obtai n baseline history, physical exam, and laboratory 
evaluations to determine if the subject meets eligi bility criteria. Prior to any screening procedure b eing 
performed, potential participants will receive info rmation about the study, including potential risks,  and 
patient information sheet / informed consent form, that they will sign.  
 
Screening will include the following procedures: 
• The risks, benefits, and alternative methods of co ntraception will be reviewed with each subject 
in a manner consistent with her education level. 
• Each woman must sign an IRB-approved informed cons ent form before any of the study-related 
procedures can be performed. The original signed in formed consent form will be kept on file by 
 
1 postovulatory image is defined as:  
• abrupt disappearance of follicle like structure ( FLS) or 
• reduction in size of the leading follicle > 4 mm at two consecutive visits or  
• haemorrhagic corpus luteum (FLS at least as large  as the leading follicle)

Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 29/80   the investigator with the subject’s records. A copy  of the executed form will be given to the 
subject. 
• A unique subject identification number will be ass igned by the site after the subject signs the 
informed consent form and prior to the initiation o f screening assessments. 
• Demographic characteristics will be collected incl uding date of birth, ethnicity, and race. 
• Previous medical, surgical and gynecological histo ry will be collected, including history of acute 
and chronic medical and gynecological conditions, m arijuana, illicit drug and alcohol use history, 
menstrual cycle history, current sexual activity, p revious contraceptive use, pregnancy history 
and plans for future pregnancies. This includes rec ording the date of onset of last menstrual 
bleeding along with the date of last use of a metho d of contraception. 
• Vital signs (pulse, and blood pressure) will be ob tained and recorded with the subject in a sitting 
position after at least 2 minutes’ rest. This metho d will be employed for all blood pressure 
measurements taken during the study.  
• Height and weight will be recorded. BMI will be ca lculated in kg/m².  
• General physical and gynecological examinations (b reast and pelvic examinations) will be 
performed. 
• A TVUS will be performed to ensure the subject has  an intact uterus and both ovaries and 
assess endometrial thickness, endometrial appearanc e, presence of follicles and TVUS 
abnormalities. 
• If indicated, a Pap test will be performed. 
• Chlamydia and gonorrhea tests. A wet mount should be obtained if vaginitis is suspected. 
• Wet mount and KOH preparation of vaginal fluid to confirm diagnosis bacterial vaginosis if there 
is presence of non-physiologic vaginal discharge. 
• Blood sampling for clinical chemistry and CBC test s for safety as well as P4 to check ovulatory 
status.  
• Women will be questioned regarding concomitant med ications. Concomitant medications taken 
within the 2 weeks before screening and from time o f consent will be reported, in addition to 
indications for the medications and reasons for dis continuing. 
• Subject eligibility will be assessed based on all inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
• Adverse events happening after signature of ICF wi ll be recorded 
The results of the routine laboratory tests, Pap an d STI test results (if indicated), and remaining el igibility 
criteria must be reviewed by the PI/medical designe e before enrolling the subject. The 
investigator/medical designee must review laborator y reports, which should be filed with each subject’ s 
chart. The PI/medical designee will consider an ind ividual subject’s risks regarding use of a POP. The  
woman will be informed by telephone/email of her sc reening results and, if eligible, she will be instr ucted 
to notify the study site when her next menstrual bl eeding occurs in order to schedule the next visit.  
If any laboratory results are abnormal, according t o local lab standards and clinically significant pe r the 
investigator’s judgment, the subject will be inform ed and excluded from the study as well as referred to 
her primary health care provider. At the discretion  of the investigator, abnormal laboratory assessmen ts 
may be repeated before a final determination of exc lusion is made. Subjects who have vaginitis, or 
those that screen positive for Chlamydia or gonorrh ea, should be treated and can then be enrolled into  
the trial once proof of cure is obtained. It is adv isable to have partners of women who screen positiv e 
for Chlamydia or gonorrhea treated as well.  
If a subject is on a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhi bitor at time of screening, and is not taking the 
CYP3A4 inhibitor on a chronic basis, the subject ma y be re-evaluated for enrollment 6 days after they 
complete their course of treatment. Stoppage of the  inhibitor must be related to treatment completion 
and unrelated to the purpose of enrollment in this study. 
 
Laboratory assessments performed >60 days prior to enrollment should be repeated. Subjects who 
have delayed enrollment beyond 60 days since screen ing should be queried regarding any changes in 
their medical history and the investigator will det ermine if there is a need to repeat the physical ex am, 
including the gynecologic exam (breast and pelvic e xaminations). Vital signs (BP and pulse) and 
weight/BMI should be verified in accordance with ex clusion criteria.

15. ADVERSE EVENTS 
 
15.1 OBLIGATIONS OF THE INVESTIGATOR REGARDING SAFE TY REPORTING   
 
15.1.1 Definitions of Adverse Events (AE), Serious Adverse Events (SAE), severity 
and causality assessment 
 
An adverse event  is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or  clinical trial subject administered 
a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
 
An adverse reaction  is defined as “all untoward and unintended respons es to an investigational 
medicinal product related to any dose administered” . The definition also covers medication errors and 
uses outside what is foreseen in the protocol, incl uding misuse and abuse of the product. The definiti on 
implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relati onship between the event and the IMP. This means 
that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to sug gest a causal relationship. 
 
The reference document used to assess the expectedn ess is US Product Information of the study 
treatment. A copy of the document will be provided to the investigators before study start. 
 
An event is considered a Serious Adverse Event  (SAE), if in the view of either the investigator o r 
sponsor, it meets the criteria as outlined in 21 CF R 312.32 (a) as per the following:  
Any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose t hat results in any of the following outcomes:  
• death,  
• a life threatening adverse drug experience,  
NOTE: The “life-threatening” criterion in the defin ition of “seriousness” refers to an event in which 
the subject was at immediate risk of death at the t ime of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. 
• inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of exist ing hospitalization, unless hospitalization 
is for:  
1. routine medical treatment or monitoring or surge ry in relation with the indication 
studied in the protocol and not associated with any  deterioration  
2. planned treatment for a pre-existing condition t hat is unrelated to the indication 
of the current study and has not worsened since the  start of study medication (in 
that case, this pre-existing condition should be me ntioned in the e-CRF as 
patient’s history or concomitant disease) 
3. Emergency consultation without any medical admis sion 
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• or a congenital anomaly/birth defect, 
• is medically important 
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercise d in deciding whether the case should be 
considered serious in other situations, such as imp ortant medical events that may not result in death,  
be immediately life-threatening or require hospital ization but, may jeopardize the patient or subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to pre vent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Examples of such medical events include allergic br onchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or conv ulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization or development of drug dependency o r drug abuse.”   
 
Severity 
The Investigator is responsible for assessing the s everity of each AE using the following definitions for 
severity criteria: 
• Mild – events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject’s daily 
activities. 
• Moderate – events result in a low level of inconve nience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures.  Moderate events may cause some interfere nce with functioning. 
Protocol: 151042-002   CONFIDENTIAL-PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 38/80   • Severe – events interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy 
or other treatment.  Severe events are usually inca pacitating. 
 
Relationship to Investigational Product 
The Investigator is responsible for assessing the r elationship between the AE and the investigational 
product. The Investigator must determine whether th ere is a reasonable possibility that the 
investigational product caused or contributed to an  AE. The relationship assessment, based on clinical  
judgment, often relies on the following: 
• A temporal relationship between the event and adm inistration of investigational product; 
• A plausible biological mechanism for the investig ational product to cause the AE; 
• Another possible etiology of the AE; or 
• Previous report of similar AEs associated with th e investigational product or other agents 
in the same class. 
 
The terms used to assess the relationship of an eve nt to the investigational product are: 
Causality Assessment Criteria for Assessment (note that re-challenge does not 
apply in this study) 
Certainly Related The experience occurs immediately  following investigational 
product administration, related pharmacologically ( not related to 
underlying condition/concurrent disease or other dr ugs or 
chemicals) 
Possibly Related The experience follows a reasonabl e temporal sequence from 
the time of drug administration and/or follows a kn own response 
pattern to the investigational product but could ha ve been 
produced by other factors such as the participant’s  clinical state, 
therapeutic intervention or concomitant therapy. 
Unlikely Related Improbable temporal relationship. The experience was most 
probably produced by other factors such as the part icipant’s 
clinical state, therapeutic intervention or concomi tant therapy and 
does not follow a known response pattern to the inv estigational 
product. 
Not Related There is not a reasonable possibility t hat the AE is related to the 
investigational product; when an AE is assessed as not related to 
the investigational product, an alternative etiolog y, diagnosis or 
explanation for the AE should be provided. If new i nformation 
becomes available, the relationship of any AE shoul d be 
reviewed again and updated as required. 
 
15.1.2 Adverse Events: Recording and Reporting 
All AEs will be managed and reported in compliance with all applicable regulations and reported in the  
eCRF and in the clinical study report (CSR). 
At every visit, study staff will ask each subject h ow she has felt since her last visit as well as dir ectly 
and indirectly ask if she has experienced any AEs. A review of the subject’s diary should be completed  
during the visit with the subject to identify any p ossible AEs reported through the diary.  
The reporting period for AEs, regardless of serious ness or relationship to the study drug, is the peri od 
immediately following the subject signing the infor med consent through the EOS. However if an AE/SAE 
is reported after the last visit and considered as related to the IMP, the sponsor has to be informed.  
Protocol: 151042-002   CONFIDENTIAL-PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 39/80   All AEs must be recorded in the subject’s e-CRFs an d must include the following information (when 
applicable):  
• Specific condition or event.  
o Whenever possible, diagnosis or syndrome should be  reported instead of symptoms.  
o Laboratory, vital signs or ECG parameters should b e recorded as AE only if they are 
medically relevant (e.g.: symptomatic, leading to s tudy drug discontinuation, requiring 
medical treatment). 
o Indication of whether the condition was preexistin g prior to study entry or not and if yes, 
whether it has worsened in severity or frequency in  which case it is reported as an AE. 
Conditions present prior to study entry (screening)  that do not worsen in severity are 
considered medical history, not considered AEs. (Re fer to Section 11.2 Prior and 
Concomitant Illnesses and Treatments).  
• Date of occurrence.  
• Date of resolution. If the event has not resolved by the end of the study-reporting period, it will b e 
documented as still present on the case report form .  
• Severity (AEs that change in intensity are recorde d at the intensity level that is the most severe 
reported by the subject over consecutive days. If t he intensity category changes over a non-
consecutive period of time, then these changes shou ld be recorded separately with distinct onset 
dates). 
• Relationship to study medication as evaluated by t he investigator (causality assessment). 
• AE outcome (recovered, ongoing, etc.) 
• Seriousness 
 
The investigator should also specify actions taken with respect to the study drug(s), corrective treat ment 
given, additional investigations performed, outcome  and his/her opinion as to whether there is a 
reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by th e study drug(s). 
 
15.1.3 Instructions to study participants  
 
Participants will be provided with instructions for  contacting the study site to report any untoward 
medical occurrences they may experience, except for  possible life-threatening events, for which they 
will be instructed to seek immediate emergency care . Participants will be able to seek evaluation at t he 
study site, where feasible and medically appropriat e. With permission of the participant, and whenever  
possible, records from all non-study medical provid ers related to untoward medical occurrences will be  
obtained for review. Participants who have ongoing SAEs or related AEs at their last study visit will be 
followed until resolution or stabilization, or refe rred for additional care. If a SAE occurs after the  last 
visit, the participant will be asked to report it t o investigator, so it can be reported to the sponso r (see 
section 15.1.2). 
 
15.1.4 Study reporting for SAEs 
The reporting period for SAEs is the period immedia tely following the informed consent signature until  
the EOS. In case a SAE is brought to the attention of the investigator at any time after the end of th e 
clinical trial and is considered by him to be cause d by the study drug with a reasonable possibility, the 
SAE will be reported to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigil ance Department. 
SAEs must be followed until resolution, even if thi s extends beyond the study-reporting period. 
Resolution of a SAE is defined as the return to bas eline status or stabilization of the condition with  the 
expectation that it will remain chronic.  
In case of SAE, the investigator must immediately: 
• Enter within 24 hours the information related to t he SAE in the appropriate screen of the e-CRF. 
• Attach the photocopies of all examinations carried  out with the dates on which they were 
performed as well as the laboratory normal ranges

Department within 1 working day of knowledge or upo n request from the Sponsor 
Pharmacovigilance Department. 
Fax:  
E-mail:  
 
Any additional SAE supporting documentation should be transmitted to Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance 
Department whenever possible (with subject identifi cation information redacted) to verify the medical 
diagnosis. This includes hospital discharge summari es, lab report, death certificates/autopsy reports 
(where applicable), surgical procedure summaries, h istology reports, and imaging reports.  
 
As the IND holder, HRA is responsible for the appro priate recording, review and compliance with 
regulatory reporting requirements of SAEs to the FD A in accordance with 21 CFR 312.50.  
 
15.1.5 Follow up 
 
The investigator should take all appropriate measur es to ensure the safety of the patient and should 
follow the outcome of the AE/SAE until return to no rmal or consolidation of the patient’s condition. 
Any new information should be sent by Fax or email to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department 
within 1 working day of knowledge: 
Fax: + 
E-mail:  
 
15.1.6 Event of special interest 
 
Pregnancy: 
In case of pregnancy, the study drug will be discon tinued and the investigator must immediately: 
Fill in the Pregnancy Collection Form (see Appendix  6) and send it by fax or email within 1 working 
day to HRA Pharma’s Pharmacovigilance Department: 
Fax:  
E-mail:  
All cases of pregnancy will be recorded in the e-CR F. 
The investigator should take all appropriate measur es to follow the pregnancy until its final outcome 
(abortion, delivery or other).The Pharmacovigilance  Department will contact the investigator in order to 
collect needed information on the pregnancy.  
 
15.1.7 Notification of IRB of SAEs 
 
All expedited SAEs that occur at each site must be directly reported to the IRB by the Investigator wi thin 
10 business days of the investigator’s knowledge of  the event. However, the death of a subject must 
be reported within 24 hours of discovery. The inves tigator should report non-expedited SAEs/AEs for 
their own site per their IRBs reporting guidelines.   
 
The final adjudication of an SAE will be conducted by HRA and the final form will be sent to the princ ipal 
investigator for submission to the IRB for applicab le events. Investigators must also submit applicabl e 
safety information provided by HRA to their IRB.  
 
15.2 OBLIGATIONS OF THE SPONSOR REGARDING SAFETY RE PORTING   
 
During the course of the study, the sponsor will re port in an expedited manner all Suspected 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) to th e Health authorities as appropriate. The 
sponsor should also inform investigators of SUSARs.  
 
Protocol: 151042-002   CONFIDENTIAL-PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 41/80   No specific DSMB will be set up for this trial. How ever, in case of pertaining safety issues emerging 
during the study, the independent, autonomous Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) established 
by the WHRU, Portland, Oregon may be used. 
 
15.3 PREGNANCY DETERMINATION AND FOLLOW-UP 
 
Subjects are not supposed to be at risk for pregnan cy (see inclusion criteria) but If a subject become s 
pregnant during the study, the investigator must in form HRA of the pregnancy within 24 hours of such 
determination, the subject must be discontinued fro m the trial, and all procedures scheduled for the 
EOS Visit should be performed. Additional pregnancy  data will be submitted as it becomes available. 
The estimated date of ovulation will be made by the  investigator based upon results of the following 
pregnancy determination criteria, listed in order f rom most accurate to least accurate:  
1. TVUS. 
2. Estimate based on pelvic and/or abdominal examin ation or pregnancy outcome. 
3. Daily diary information ( e.g. , last menstrual period). 
4. Quantitative β-hCG determination. 
5. Investigator estimation in the absence of above criteria. 
 
Subjects who become pregnant during the study will be informed of pregnancy options and referred for 
appropriate care.  
All pregnancies will be monitored until outcome (i. e. 9 months follow-up or until outcome information is 
obtained). Information will also be collected on an y maternal or fetal complications. Congenital 
anomalies or birth defects will be classified as SA Es. Pregnancy outcome data will be collected for 
analysis. Reports of pregnancy outcome and examinat ions during the pregnancy will be requested from 
the attending physician/outside clinic, if applicab le. Pregnancy outcome data will include the rates o f 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, live preterm, and  full-term births. 
If a subject has a spontaneous abortion or ectopic pregnancy this will be considered as a SAE. In 
addition, congenital malformations and anomalies wi ll be recorded as SAEs and summarized.  
If a subject continues with her pregnancy through c hildbirth, every effort will be made to maintain co ntact 
with her so that health of the baby can be evaluate d at six and twelve months. Any outstanding data at  
the end of the study that is collected will be subm itted to the FDA as a Safety Update to the NDA 
submission. A clinical summary of the prenatal and postnatal events will be reported separately from 
the case report form in narrative format in the cli nical summary report.  
 
 
16. STUDY CONDUCT 
 
16.1 Deviation from the Protocol 
 
The Investigator should not deviate from the protoc ol without prior notification and approval of HRA w ith 
the exception of minor visit window deviations. In the event that the investigator or the subject devi ates 
from the protocol without a protocol waiver, notifi cation should be provided to HRA as soon as possibl e 
detailing the circumstances of the protocol violati on. Certain protocol violations may require the sub ject 
to be terminated early from the study. It is the re sponsibility of the research centers to report all protocol 
waivers and protocol violations to their IRB accord ing to IRB policy.  
 
16.2 Amendments to the Protocol 
 
Neither the investigator nor the sponsor will alter  this study protocol without obtaining the written 
agreement of the other.  
 
Any change of the clinical trial must be written an d filed as an amendment to this protocol. The 
Investigator(s) must submit the protocol amendment for review by their IRB and shall obtain the 
approval of their IRB before it is implemented. 
 
Protocol: 151042-002   CONFIDENTIAL-PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 42/80   In cases of emergency, when the protocol change or deviation is to eliminate or reduce an immediate 
hazard or risk to human subjects, the amendment may  be implemented before review or approval by 
their IRB. In such cases, the investigator shall no tify their IRB of the change or deviation in writin g within 
10 working days after implementation. Any protocol- related issues that pose an immediate or significan t 
hazard to subjects must be reported to HRA immediat ely. If the protocol amendment is an administrative  
change, it will be sent to their IRB for informatio n (updating of file). 
All modifications of the clinical trial will be wri tten and filed with FDA as an amendment to this pro tocol, 
maintaining original section identification. Such m odifications will be made jointly by HRA, and all t he 
Investigators with the approval of all the IRBs. 
 
16.3 Subject Confidentiality 
Subject names will not be supplied to the sponsor. Only the subject number and subject initials will b e 
recorded in the e-CRF, and if the subject name appe ars on any other document, it must be obliterated 
before a copy of the document is supplied to the sp onsor. Study findings stored on a computer will be 
stored in accordance with local data protection law s. The subjects will be told that representatives o f 
the sponsor, IRB, or regulatory authorities may ins pect their medical records to verify the informatio n 
collected, and that all personal information made a vailable for inspection will be handled in the stri ctest 
confidence and in accordance with local data protec tion laws. 
Subject confidentiality will be maintained by the u se of coded subject ID numbers. Clinical informatio n 
will not be released without the written permission  of the participant, except as necessary for monito ring 
by the FDA, HRA.  
The investigator will maintain a personal subject i dentification list (subject ID numbers with the 
corresponding subject names) to enable records to b e identified.  
 
16.4 Discontinuing Subjects 
 
A subject will be considered to have completed the clinical trial after she has completed the three 28 -
day treatment periods and completes the EOS Visit a nd after the final set of data has been collected 
and entered in the e-CRF.  
 
Subjects may be  discontinued prematurely for any of the following reasons: 
• Emergence of AE or SAE that, in the judgment of th e investigator, should result in premature 
discontinuation. 
• Inter-current illness that, in the judgment of the  investigator, should result in premature 
discontinuation. 
• Major protocol violation as per investigator’s jud gment and after sponsor’s approval. 
• Use of prohibited medications, including any outli ned in the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria  
• Suspected drug interaction. 
• Pathologically changed laboratory values. 
• Knowledge of new risks necessitating new benefit/r isk evaluation. 
• Non-compliance (see section 12.8) 
• Missing multiple visits  
• Emergence of any of the exclusions listed above. 
 
Subjects must be  discontinued for any of the following reasons: 
• Withdrawing their consent (e.g., due to personal r easons, experiencing AE).  
• Subject lost to follow up 
• Trial closed-out. 
• Confirmed Pregnancy. 
• Gonorrhea or Chlamydia or a pelvic-inflammatory di sease diagnosis during the course of the study, 
except for the diagnosis being made on the initial screening test, at which time the Investigator 
chooses to suspend the subject’s enrollment until p roof of cure is obtained. 
• Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction to st udy medication   
• Serious intercurrent problems requiring admission to the critical care unit or surgery   
Protocol: 151042-002   CONFIDENTIAL-PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 43/80    
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any stage and for any reason. 
 
The reason for premature discontinuation will be re corded on the End of Trial form. If withdrawal from  the 
study is due to an AE, this information will also  be recorded on the Adverse Event form. 
All subjects who terminate early from the trial wil l undergo EOS visit procedures regardless of the 
reason for discontinuation with the exception of th ose subjects who have lost contact with the researc h 
center. A subject cannot be considered lost to foll ow-up until the subject misses a visit and the rese arch 
center performs and documents at least three (3) at tempts to contact her. Documentation must include 
a letter sent return receipt requested to the subje ct instructing her to call the research center. Eve ry 
effort must be made to follow-up with subjects who terminate with product-related adverse experiences,  
in order to determine the final outcome of AEs.  
 
16.5 Withdrawals from Study 
 
All efforts should be made to contact the woman whe n she decides to discontinue so that appropriate 
discontinuation data can be obtained. Such contact will not be used to dissuade any subject who wishes  
to terminate the study.  
 
As far as possible, all examinations scheduled for the EOS visit must be performed on all subjects who  
receive study medication but do not complete the st udy according to protocol. 
 
The procedures outlined for the EOS visit should be  performed, whenever it occurs. Additionally, all 
study medication will be collected. The reasons for  discontinuation will be recorded in the End of Tri al 
CRF.  
 
At a minimum, all subjects who discontinue study me dication, including those who refuse to return for 
a final visit, will be contacted for safety evaluat ions during the 30 days following the last dose of study 
medication. Subjects who discontinue study medicati on should be considered withdrawn from the study 
after the final visit assessments are performed or when it is clear that the subject will not return f or these 
assessments 
 
 
17. STUDY MONITORING AND DOCUMENTATION 
 
17.1 Clinical Monitoring, Quality Control, and Qual ity Assurance 
 
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed by the  sponsor will be followed, in order to comply with 
GCP guidelines. On-site checking of the CRFs for co mpleteness and clarity, cross-checking with source 
documents, and clarification of administrative matt ers will be performed. 
 
The Principal Investigator and sub-investigators wi ll allow representatives from HRA and subcontractor s 
direct access to all CRFs, source documents, and co rresponding portions of the medical records for 
each participant at mutually convenient times for p eriodic review before, during, and after the study has 
been completed.  The monitoring visits provide HRA Pharma and subcontractors with the opportunity 
to:  
• Initiate the research center. 
• Evaluate the progress of the study. 
• Verify the accuracy and completeness of the e-CRFs . 
• Ensure that all protocol requirements, applicable FDA regulations, and investigators’ obligations 
are being fulfilled. 
• Resolve any inconsistencies in the study records. 
• Close out the trial at the research center.

Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 44/80   In addition to routine monitoring, HRA or its desig nee may, at its discretion, perform site audits. Th e 
purpose of such audits will be to evaluate site tri al conduct and compliance with the protocol, SOPs, 
GCP, and the applicable regulatory requirements. If  an audit is performed, a site must provide the 
auditors with direct access to all relevant records  and documentation related to the study. 
 
Regulatory authorities, the Institutional Review Bo ard may also request access to all source documents , 
CRFs, and other study documentation for on-site ins pection.  
 
17.2 Administrative and Record Management and Reten tion of Data 
All investigative site records (source documents an d other subject records) will be kept in a secure a nd 
hazard free storage area. Access will be restricted  to study personnel authorized to handle research 
documents. All records will be retained 15 years af ter the study completion.  
HRA should be notified before destruction of any si te records or transfer of oversight of the records 
should there be PI change at a site. 
All Essential Documents as defined in Section 8 of the ICH consolidated guideline on GCP (Essential 
Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial) cont ained in the Trial Master File and the Investigator ’s 
File must be retained after the completion or termi nation of the study by the investigator and the spo nsor 
for at least 15 years after the study completion. 
However, because of international regulatory requir ements, the sponsor may request retention for a 
longer period of time. The investigator must theref ore obtain approval in writing from the sponsor pri or 
to destruction of any records. 
Throughout the study, e-CRFs and data clarification  forms will be transmitted from the clinical site(s ) to 
the sponsor or its designee and the information wil l be stored in an electronic database.. The final e -
CRFs will be copied onto a CD-rom and sent to the s ite for archiving.  
Data entered by subjects in e-diaries throughout th e trial will be transferred at study end to the Con tract 
Research Organization (CRO) in charge of data manag ement..  
In order to assure the accuracy of data collected i nto the e-CRF, it is mandatory that the sponsor (or  
designees), as well as representatives of regulator y agencies, have access to original source 
documents (e.g., patient records, patient charts, l aboratory reports). During the review of these 
documents, the anonymity of the patient will be res pected with strict adherence to professional 
standards of confidentiality. 
Normally, investigator’s records will be held in th e investigator's archives. If the investigator is u nable 
to meet this obligation, he or she must ask the spo nsor for permission to make alternative 
arrangements.  Details of these arrangements should  be documented. 
Key documents to be retained are summarized below: 
 Investigator Sponsor 
• Signed informed consent documents

17.3 Study Documentation 
HRA monitoring subcontractor is responsible for ass uring that the essential documents maintained in 
the investigator site files at the research centers  are accurate and complete. Essential documents in 
the investigator site files / trial master file wil l be maintained according to written SOPs. 
 
17.4 Electronic Data Capture System 
All requested information should be entered in the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system. Prior to the 
start of the clinical trial, the investigator will complete an authorized signature sheet showing the 
signatures and handwritten initials of all individu als who are authorized to maintain study records an d 
submit data using the EDC system.  
 
17.5 Confidentiality and Reporting of Results 
Subject names will not be entered into the EDC syst em; instead, unique subject identifiers will be 
assigned. Medical records will be kept at the resea rch center and will be available to study staff and , 
HRA, site IRBs, or the FDA only. Any publications o r presentations that result from this study will 
maintain participant confidentiality. All data will  only be used for the purpose for which it has been  
approved. Data collected during this study and any analyses of that data will not be used in any way 
other than those ways already approved without furt her approval from HRA. 
 
 
18. DOCUMENTATION AND USE OF STUDY FINDINGS 
 
18.1 Documentation of study findings 
 
An e-CRF will be used for each subject . 
 
All protocol-required information collected during the study must be entered by the investigator, or 
designated representative, in the e-CRF. Details of  e-CRF completion and correction will be explained 
to the investigator. If the investigator authorizes  other persons to make entries in the e-CRF, the na mes, 
positions, signatures, and initials of these person s must be supplied to the sponsor. 
 
Protocol: 151042-002   CONFIDENTIAL-PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 46/80   The investigator, or designated representative, sho uld complete the e-CRF as soon as possible after 
information is collected, preferably on the same da y that a study subject is seen for an examination, 
treatment, or any other study procedure. Any outsta nding entries must be completed immediately after 
the final examination. An explanation should be giv en for all missing data. 
 
A source data location list will be prepared and up dated during the study. This list will be filed in both 
the trial master file and the investigator study fi le. This list should also include identification of  any data 
to be recorded directly on the e-CRFs and to be con sidered to be source data. 
 
The completed e-CRF must be reviewed and approved b y the investigator named in the study protocol 
or by a designated sub-investigator. 
 
The data management CRO will provide the sponsor an d the investigator with paper renditions of the 
e-CRF (for example, in pdf format) and / or a CD-RO M of the e-CRF at study end. 
 
18.2 Use of study findings 
 
All information concerning the product as well as a ny matter concerning the operation of HRA Pharma, 
such as clinical indications for the drug, its form ula, methods of manufacture and other scientific da ta 
relating to it, that have been provided by HRA Phar ma and are unpublished, are confidential and must 
remain the sole property of HRA Pharma. The investi gator will agree to use the information only for th e 
purposes of carrying out this study and for no othe r purpose unless prior written permission from HRA 
Pharma is obtained. 
 
By signing the Investigator’s declaration, the inve stigator agrees that the results of the study may b e 
used for the purposes of national and international  registration, publication, and information for med ical 
and pharmaceutical professionals. If necessary, the  authorities will be notified of the investigator’s  
name, address, qualifications, and extent of involv ement. 
 
The sponsor will prepare a final report on the stud y and will communicate a summary of key findings to  
all investigators. 
Only the principal investigator will be required to  sign a statement that he or she has read the repor t 
and confirms that, to the best of his or her knowle dge, it accurately describes the conduct and result s 
of the study.

19. STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL METHODS 
 
19.1 Populations 
 
Four populations of interest will be analyzed.  
Protocol: 151042-002   CONFIDENTIAL-PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 47/80   • The Intent-To-Treat  (ITT)  population  consists of all subjects who were randomized; 
• The Full Analysis Set (FAS) or population of evaluable women is dependent on the question 
of interest. 
o  It is composed of all randomized and treated wome n  with  cervical mucus 
information (mucus score) at the second or third tr eatment periods for the questions 
related to mucus and the effect of unperfect use of  norgestrel. 
o It is all randomized and treated women with ovaria n activity information (OAS: 
ovarian activity score) at the second or third trea tment periods for questions related 
to ovarian activity . 
o It is all women with complete information on mucus  and ovarian activity for questions 
related to overall conception protection . 
Cycles with a very early ovulation (within 10 days before the DMP period) at period 2 or 3 may 
be removed from the set of evaluable cycles in a se nsitivity analysis or included as failure 
depending upon the question of interest because the  effect of intake infringement cannot be 
assessed in these cycles. The exclusion of cycles f rom a given analysis, the exclusion of a 
woman from the FAS and the status of non evaluable cycles will be decided in a blind manner 
by an independent adjudication committee.  
• The per-protocol (PP) population  is composed of subjects from the FAS without major  
protocol violation/deviation and with complete cerv ical mucus and ovarian activity data at the 
three periods. Relevant protocol violation/deviatio n will be defined during the data review but 
will include at least compliance issues and early o vulation;  
• The Safety population  that consists of all subjects who took at least on e dose of study 
medication (Opill ® 75 mcg). 
 
The ITT population will be used to describe the pop ulation and to get information on the level of 
compliance in a clinical trial (treatment period 1)  that is expected to be better than in the real lif e. 
 
The FAS or evaluable population will be used in the  ‘primary’ analysis for assessing the effect of del ayed 
or missed pill on mucus permeability to spermatozoi ds and on secondary pharmacodynamic analyses.  
 
The PP population will be used for assessing the ph armacodynamic effect without missing data and 
possibly biased data due to protocol violations/dev iations. This will be the "cleanest" results for 
assessing the effect of infringement and the PD eff ect at the expense of completeness of the set of 
randomized women and representativeness of the trea ted population. 
 
The Safety set will mainly be used for safety purpo ses. 
 
19.2 Description of Subjects 
 
The number of subjects, who were screen failures, e nrolled, treated, withdrawn and who completed the 
clinical trial will be tabulated. This will be pres ented in a chart called patient disposition.  
 
Baseline demographics and characteristics will be s ummarized for all subjects per population. The 
characteristic of the ITT, FAS, PP and safety popul ations at entry in the study will be provided throu gh 
descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, m inimum, median, maximum and number of 
observations and missing cases) for quantitative va riables and frequencies and percentages for 
categorical variables.

19.3.1 Primary analysis 
 
The primary working hypothesis  states that an infringement in the schedule of int ake of norgestrel 
75 mcg has a negative impact on the level of concep tion protection of women.  
 
The primary objectives  of the study is to verify whether a delayed intake  of 6 hours or a missed pill of 
norgestrel 75 mcg has an effect on cervical mucus p rotection and more specifically tends to increase 
the cervical mucus score compared to reported perfe ct use of norgestrel 75 mcg just before 
infringement. 
 
The primary population  of subjects is the FAS. It is composed of all rand omized and treated women  
with  cervical  mucus information (mucus score) at the second or th ird treatment period. Subjects with a 
very early ovulation will be discarded from the set  of evaluable cycles in the primary analysis. 
 
The  primary treatment periods of interest are the second and third treatment peri ods.  
 
The primary assessment criterion  of interest is the cervical mucus score during the  treatment periods 
2 and 3. 
 
The symbols used in the statistical section are: 
• T is the time of treatment (pill) 
• TMS is the time of mucus scoring 
• TMS score is the value of mucus score at the time of mucus scoring  
• A or B concerns arm A or B respectively 
• R denotes the day of pill intake infringement in p eriod 2 and period 3  
• R-1 denotes the day before infringement in periods  2 and 3  
• R+1 denotes the day after infringement in periods 2 and 3  
• V1, V2 and V3 or 1, 2 and 3 denote visits during t he first, second and third periods respectively. 
• T2 R-1 and T3 R-1 are times of pill intake at V2 R-1 and V3 R-1 respectively. 
 
The primary time points of interest  are: 
  
• Time of mucus scoring (TMS) the day before  infringement (delayed pill or missed pill) in 
period 2 and period 3 (baseline):  
o TMS2 R-1 = T2 R-1+ 8 h ± 30 min at V2 R-1 and  
o TMS3 R-1 = T3 R-1 + 8 h ± 30 min at V3 R-1.  
 
• Time of mucus scoring the day of infringement  in period 2 or 3: 
o Subjects belonging to arm A 
 TMS2 A,R = T2 R-1 +3 h ± 15 min at V2 R and  
 TMS3 A,R = T3 R-1 + 6 h ± 15 min at V3 R  
o Subjects belonging to arm B   
 TMS2 B,R  = T2 R-1 + 6 h ± 15 min at V2 R 
 TMS3 B,R = T3 R-1 +3 h ± 15 min at V3 R  
 
• Time of mucus scoring the day after infringement (both arms):   
o TMS2 R+1  = T2 R-1 - 30 min (before pill intake)  at V2 R+1  and   
o TMS3 R+1  = T3 R-1 - 30 min at V3 R+1 .  
 
N.B.: The time of pill intake  the day after infringement should be the same as t he day before 
infringement (expected around 9 am).  
 
The primary baseline time points are:

Around 8 hours after pill intake the day before inf ringement.  
 
The primary response time points are:   
 
• Arm A: 
o TMS2 A,R  = T2 R-1 + 3 h ± 15 min at V2 R  
o TMS2 R+1  = T2 R-1 - 30 min (before pill intake) at V2 R+1

o TMS2 B,R  = T2 R-1 +6 h ± 15 min at V2 R  
o TMS2 R+1  = T2 R-1 - 30 min (before pill intake) at V2 R+1  
o TMS3 B,R = T3 R-1 + 3h ± 15 min at V3 R 
o TMS3 R+1  =T3 R-1 - 30 min (before pill intake) at V3 R+1 .

The  primary outcomes/endpoints are  the changes from baseline (BSL):  
• Delta from BSL to V2 R = Mucus score at V2 R − score at V2 R-1 (period 2): change from baseline 
to 3 or 6 hour after infringement  
• Delta from BSL to V2 R+1  = Mucus score at V2 R+1 − score at V2 R-1 (period 2): Change from 
baseline to just before pill intake the day after i nfringement  
• Delta from BSL to V3 R =  Mucus score at V3 R − score at V3 R-1 (period 3) change from baseline 
to 3 or 6 hour after infringement  
• Delta from BSL to V3 R+1  = Score at V3 r+1  − score at V3 r-1 (period 3) Change from baseline to 
just before pill intake the day after infringement  
 
The  primary model of interest is a mixed model for repeated measures using as response delta to V2 R, 
delta to V2 R+1 , delta to V3 R and delta to V3 r+1 . The covariates will be the period (or period effe ct), the 
intervention (type of infringement: missed pill or delayed pill), the sequence of intervention (missed  pill 
then delayed pill and vice versa), the time and the  subject. Time, period intervention type, and seque nce 
will be considered as categorical variables. The su bject as random effect (RANDOM statement of the 
MIXED procedure). This will permit to take into acc ount the fact that measures from each period are 
derived from the same subjects. A time repeated eff ect (REPEATED statement of the MIXED 
procedure) within each combination subject* period (SUBJECT = subject* period as option of the 
REPEATED statement). This will permit to take into account the fact that for each subject, at each 
period several measures are performed over time. Th e proper struture of the variance covariance matrix  
will be retained using the best fit among unstructu red matrix (UN) compound symetry (CS) and 
autoregressive structure (AR1).    
 
The primary test of interest  will be the significance of the overall mean (inte rcept). This will answer 
the question: is the overall mean change from basel ine different from zero? Or does the infringement

Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 50/80   of schedule regardless the type of infringement lea d to a change in mucus score?  
 
The contrasts or estimates of interest  are  
• the effect of infringement type: does the effect o f missed pill differ from the effect of 6 hours 
delay? If the answer is yes then a signal of effect  is detected.  
• The effect of time: does the response on the day o f infringement differ from the response on 
the day after infringement? If the answer is yes th en a signal of effect of infringement is 
detected.  
 
The SAP may present other models (secondary models)  to answer other questions of interest or to 
get a more parsimonious model. For example if the s equence of intervention effect is not significant a  
model without this covariate can be planned in the SAP. 
  
19.3.2 Subordinated objective 
 
The subordinate primary objective is to estimate the duration of the protective effec t of cervical mucus 
after last pill intake of norgestrel 75 mcg during reported perfect use (at the day before the infring ement). 
 
The possible increase in mucus score may have no de tectable effect on conception risk depending on 
the level of score because it increased but remaine d below a threshold of good protection.  
 
The mucus score has a value ranging from zero (not propicious for spermatozoïds progression: 
maximal protection) to 12 (propicious for spermatoz oïds progresion: minimal protection). The primary 
cut-off  for full cervical mucus protection is a cervical m ucus score of 4. There is therefore a good 
conception protection by cervical mucus if the cerv ical mucus score is ≤ 4.  
 
The responses  of interest are: 
 
1. The full protection by cervical mucus regardless  of the use of norgestrel 75 mcg if the score 
was and remained at 4 or below at V2 R-1, V2 R, V2 R+1 , V3 R-1, V3 R and V3 R+1 . The full protection 
by the mucus lasted for 2 x 3 days. The proportion of patients meeting this criterion is p FP.  
2. The absence of risk increase further to delayed intake: The score was ≤ 4 the day before 
infringement and remained at 4 or less the day of i nfringement and the day after the delayed 
pill intake. The protection by the mucus lasted at least up to the day after infringement. The 
proportion of patients fulfilling this criterion is  pdelay .   
3. The absence of risk increase further to missed p ill: The score was ≤ 4 the day before 
infringement and remained at 4 or less the day of i nfringement and the day after missed pill. 
The protection by the mucus lasted at least up to t he day after infringement.The proportion of 
patients fulfilling this criterion is p missed .     
4. The absence of risk increase due to infringement  regardless of the type: The score was ≤ 4 the 
day before infringement and remained at 4 or less t he day of infringement and the day after 
infringement. The protection by the mucus lasted at  least up to the day after infringement. The 
proportion of patients fulfilling this criterion is  pbreach .   
5. The transient risk increase further to delayed i ntake: The score was ≤ 4 the day before 
infringement, exceeded 4 the day of infringement bu t came back to 4 or less the day after the 
delayed pill intake. The protection by the mucus wa s interrupted the day of infringement. The 
proportion of patients fulfilling this criterion is  pdelay,trasient risk .   
6. The transient risk increase further to missed pi ll: The score was ≤ 4 the day before infringement, 
exceeded 4 the day of infringement but came back to  4 or less the day after the delayed pill 
intake, The protection by the mucus was interrupted  the day of infringement. The proportion of 
patients fulfilling this criterion is p missed,transient risk .   
7. The prolonged risk increase further to delayed i ntake: The score was ≤ 4 the day before 
infringement, exceeded 4 the day of infringement an d the day after the delayed pill intake. The 
protection by the mucus was interrupted the day of infringement and at least up to the day after. 
The proportion of patients fulfilling this criterio n is p delay, prolonged risk, .

Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 51/80   8. The prolonged risk increase further to missed pi ll: The score was ≤ 4 the day before 
infringement, exceeded 4 the day of infringement an d the day after the missed pill. The 
protection by the mucus was interrupted the day of infringement and at least up to the day after. 
The proportion of patients fulfilling this criterio n is p missed, prolonged risk, .   
9. Other definitions can be added in the SAP to get  a detailed picture of the effect of infringement 
and its duration. 
 
Comparison between the missed pill and the delayed pill can easily be performed and tested through a 
stratified McNemar test (stratification on the site , CMH option in SAS). The SAS glimmix procedure for  
repeated measures was not retained for decision mak ing test because convergence issues in fitting the 
model are too frequent. The first null hypothesis i s H 0: Proportion of protected women at baseline (R-1) 
is equal to the proportion of protected women after  schedule infringement and more specifically at Day  
R (27 hours and 30 hours post treatment). The secon d null hypothesis is the equality of proportions at  
baseline (R-1) and at Day R+1 (48 hours post treatm ent). 
 
19.3.3 Secondary analyses 
 
Cervical mucus protection in each type of treatment  period 
 
The aim of this secondary objective is to assess th e level of cervical mucus protection during reporte d 
perfect use, during a treatment period with a delay ed pill intake of 6 hours and during a treatment pe riod 
with a missed pill of norgestrel 75 mcg. 
 
The time frames are: 
• reported perfect use: all the visits of the period  1 before a postovulatory image is obtained 
• delayed pill intake: all the visits of the period 2 for Arm A and all the visits of period 3 for Arm B 
before a postovulatory image is obtained 
• missed pill: all the visits of the period 2 for Ar m B and all the visits of period 3 for Arm A before  
a postovulatory image is obtained. 
 
The assessment criterion is the cervical mucus scor e. The cut off is a cervical mucus score of 4.  There 
is conception protection by cervical mucus if the c ervical mucus score is ≤ 4. 
 
The endpoints are: 
• The percentage of subjects with cervical mucus sco re ≤ 4, between 5 and 8, and ≥ 9 in reported 
perfect use period 
• The percentage of subjects with cervical mucus sco re ≤ 4, between 5 and 8, and ≥ 9 in delayed 
pill intake periods 
• The percentage of subjects with cervical mucus sco re ≤ 4, between 5 and 8, and ≥ 9 in missed 
pill periods 
• The percentage of subjects with cervical mucus sco re ≤ 4 in all periods  
 
Other analyses based on other endpoint of interest can be in the SAP. 
 
Ovarian Activity in each type of treatment period 
 
The aim of this secondary objective is to describe the distribution of the ovarian status among the 
subjects, during reported perfect use, during a tre atment period with a delayed pill intake of 6 hours  and 
during a treatment period with a missed pill of nor gestrel 75 mcg. 
 
The time frames are: 
• reported perfect use: all the visits of the period  1  
• delayed pill intake: all the visits of the period 2 for Arm A and all the visits of period 3 for Arm B

  Page 52/80   • missed pill: all the visits of the period 2 for Ar m B and all the visits of period 3 for Arm A 
 
The assessment criterion is the OS as defined in Ap pendix 31. 
The OS are ranked depending on the risk of concepti on: OS nlp  > OS alp  > OS a > OS q. 
For each treatment period the most risky OS will be  considered. 
 
The endpoints are: 
• The percentage of subjects with OSq, OSa, OSa/OSal p and OSnlp in reported perfect use 
period 
• The percentage of subjects with OSq, OSa, OSa/OSal p and OSnlp in delayed pill intake periods 
• The percentage of subjects with OSq, OSa, OSa/OSal p and OSnlp in missed pill periods 
• The percentage of subjects with OSnlp in all perio ds 
 
19.3.4 Other secondary analyses 
 
Protection from conception based on cervical mucus score and OS (binary and ternary 
analyses)) 
 
Based on cervical mucus score and OS only, the aim of these exploratory analyses are to assess if a 
combination of cervical mucus score and ovarian sta tus can be considered as a measure of protection 
from conception or not and the level of protection,  during reported perfect use of norgestrel 75 mcg a nd 
after a delayed intake/missed pill. 
 
For both analyses, the assessment criteria will be the OS and the highest cervical mucus score during 
the 3 visits before a postovulatory image is obtain ed including the visit when the postovulatory image  
is obtained 2. 
For the OS, the risk of conception is ranked depend ing on the OS: OS nlp  > OS alp  > OS a > OS q and for 
each treatment period the most risky OS will be con sidered.  
 
Binary analysis 
 
The aims of this analysis is to determine whether a  subject is protected on not, according to the 
algorithm presented in Figure 4 
 
Figure 4 Conception protection based on OS and cerv ical mucus score (binary analysis) 
 
 
The endpoints will be, for each treatment period, t he distribution of subjects:  
 
1 The ovarian status are: 
OSq = quiescence defined as a OAS ≤ 3 
OSa = ovarian activity defined as a OAS = 4 or 5 
OSalp = ovulation with abnormal luteal phase define d as a OAS = 6 at only one visit 
OSnlp = ovulation with normal luteal phase as a OAS  = 6 at two consecutive visits or OAS = 7  
2 The number of visits considered for the evaluation of the mucus score may be modified by the adjudicat ion 
committee (see section 20).

Pharmacokinetics of LNG and PK/PD analysis 
 
The PK profile of LNG after administration of norge strel 75 mcg will be assessed at different times 
during the study. 
 
The PK profile of LNG will first be assessed at Day  1 after the first administration of norgestrel 75 mcg 
in fasted conditions. 
 
All the subjects will be sampled at different time points after administration as presented in the tab le 
below:

Even #  X  X  X  X  
 
 
During the first visit of the 3rd  week of treatment, the pharmacokinetics of LNG at steady state will be 
assessed. 
All the subjects will be sampled at different times  points. If the visit is in the morning, they will be sampled 
predose and between 0.5h and 2h post administration . If the visit is in the afternoon, they will be 
sampled between 5h and 9h post administration. 
The plasma concentration(s) for each subject will b e reported with the nominal time of sampling. 
 
 
The pharmacokinetics of LNG will also be assessed d uring the DMP period. The sampling schedule 
will depend on the arm the subjects had been random ized in (see Table 6 below).

The concentration of LNG will also be determined in  all subjects during the 1st  visit of study week 5 
(V2 1) and 9 (V3 1). The sample will be drawn within 30 minutes of th e mucus analysis. 
The concentrations will be reported as C2 1 and C3 1. 
 
 
A population pharmacokinetic model will  be develop ed using a dedicated software for nonlinear mixel 
model. The model will be developed using a sparse s ampling scheme. This model will be used to 
estimate population PK parameters such as clearance  and volume of distribution as well as derived PK 
parameters (C 24h , Cmax  and AUC). Complete details of all PK analyses and methods will be provided in 
a separate analysis plan finalized before the datab ase lock (DBL). 
 
A PK/PD analysis, describing the relationships betw een pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data 
will be performed; details will be provided in a se parate analysis plan finalized before database lock . 
 
19.3.5 Presentation of pharmacodynamic data 
 
PD effect will be evaluated by cervical mucus analy sis and ovarian activity during the three treatment  
periods.  
• Cervical mucus score: the time course of the mucus score will be presented for each period 
graphically along with summary statistics. 
• TVU largest follicle diameter measurement: The time  course of the diameter will be presented 
graphically along with summary statistics. The time  series will be truncated after a postovulatory 
image has been obtained  
• P4, E2, FSH and LH measurement. The time course of each parameter will be presented for 
each period graphically along with summary statisti cs. 
 
19.4 Safety analysis 
 
Safety data will be collected by querying subjects about AEs and vaginal bleeding patterns and by 
performing safety laboratory parameters at screenin g and the EOS visit. Subjects will report bleeding 
data and drug intake using a e-diary every day.  
Evaluation of the bleeding patterns will be based o n the subjects responses in the e-diary and validat ed 
during clinic visits. Vaginal bleeding in between e xpected menstrual periods will be categorised as 
breakthrough bleeding and spotting based on the ble eding intensity recorded in the e-diary. 
Amenorrhea or absence of bleeding for two menstrual  cycles or more than 60 days in subjects who 
took the medication as prescribed will also be note d.   
 
Safety will be evaluated by incidence of premature discontinuation and AEs. Summaries will be 
provided for all AEs reported, and separately for A Es leading to study discontinuation. Serious Advers e 
Events (SAEs) will be listed separately and describ ed by narrative.

clinical study report.  
         
 
20. ADJUDICATION COMMITTEE 
 
An adjudication committee will be implemented for t he study. Experts in the cervical mucus assessment 
and ovarian activity who are not affiliated with ei ther of the study sites will comprise the committee . The 
committee will gather at study end, after the data review meeting. 
Its responsibilities will be to review data regardi ng IMP intake and TVU, hormonal and mucus 
measurements, to make decisions for each subject on  compliance (for the analysis of the data), and 
reach agreement on ovarian activity score, ovarian status and cervical mucus score. They will also 
define the set of evaluable cycles. The adjudicatio n committee will work in a blinded manner (see 
section 19.1). 
A separate charter will be drawn to provide the det ails. 
 
 
21. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND LEGAL ASPECTS

Protocol: 151042-002   CONFIDENTIAL-PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 56/80   This study will be listed on the website ClinicalTr ials.gov by HRA Pharma, before the first subject is  
enrolled. 
 
21.2 Study without direct benefit to individual sub jects  
No direct benefit to individual subjects is expecte d from this study. Because participation is on a 
voluntary basis, subjects will be remunerated for t heir time spent in the study and travel expenses at  
the end of the study and on a prorated basis in the  event of early discontinuation. Details of 
remuneration will be listed in the participant’s in formation sheet approved by the IRB. 
 
21.3 Delegation of investigator responsibilities 
The investigator should ensure that all persons ass isting with the trial are adequately informed about  
the protocol, any amendments to the protocol, the s tudy medication, and their trial-related duties and  
functions. 
The investigator should maintain a list of sub-inve stigators and other appropriately qualified persons  to 
whom he or she has delegated significant trial-rela ted duties. 
 
21.4 Interactions with Institutional Review Boards 
This protocol and any protocol amendments, together  with the required documents will be submitted by 
the sponsor to the responsible IRB according to the  applicable requirements at the site. The study wil l 
commence at each participating site only after thei r IRB has granted full approval. 
Investigators/institutions will permit trial relate d monitoring, audits, IRB review and regulatory 
inspection(s) providing direct access to source dat a/documents. 
Study medication can only be supplied to the invest igator after documentation on all ethical and legal  
requirements for starting the study has been receiv ed by the sponsor. This documentation must also 
include a list of the members of the IRB and their occupation and qualifications. If the IRB will not 
disclose the names of the committee members, it sho uld be asked to issue a statement confirming that 
the composition of the committee is in accordance w ith GCP. Formal approval by the IRB should 
preferably mention the study title, study code, stu dy site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as appl icable), 
and any other documents reviewed. It must mention t he date on which the decision was made and must 
be officially signed by a committee member. 
 
Before the first subject is enrolled in the study, all ethical and legal requirements must be met. 
 
The IRB and, if applicable, the authorities must be  informed of all subsequent protocol amendments, in  
accordance with local legal requirements. Amendment s must be evaluated to determine whether formal 
approval must be sought and whether the informed co nsent document should also be revised. 
 
The investigator must keep a record of all communic ation with the IRB and, if applicable, between a 
coordinating investigator and the IRB. This also ap plies to any communication between the investigator  
(or coordinating investigator, if applicable) and t he authorities. 
 
21.5 Ongoing information for IRB 
 
The site will notify the sponsor at the time of IRB  submission.  
If required by legislation or the independent IRB, the sponsor must verify that the following is submi tted 
to the IRB: 
• Information on serious or unexpected AEs as soon a s possible 
• Periodic reports on the progress of the study

Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 57/80   21.6 Informed Consent 
 
Under informed consent, the subject shall understan d that she is authorizing access to medical records  
as required for monitors, auditors, IRBs and regula tory authorities. Subjects that agree to participat e in 
the study must sign the informed consent form (ICF)  prior to study-specific procedures. The ICF will b e 
HIPAA compliant. 
 
It is the investigator's responsibility to assure t hat each subject is provided an explanation of the details 
contained in the informed consent statement and oth er locally required documents prior to the individu al 
signing the ICF certifying voluntary participation in the trial and prior to study participation.  
The document must be in a language understandable t o the subject and must specify who informed the 
subject. Where required by local law, the person wh o informs the subject must be a physician. If not 
required by local law, another appropriately traine d and qualified healthcare professional, other than  a 
physician, is acceptable. 
 
After reading the informed consent document, the su bject must give consent in writing. The subject's 
consent must be confirmed at the time of consent by  the personally dated signature of the subject and 
by the personally dated signature of the person con ducting the informed consent discussions.  
 
The subjects will be informed of their right to pri vacy and the fact that personal information will be  treated 
as strictly confidential and will not be publicly a vailable in accordance with HIPAA regulations. They  will 
also be informed that HRA Pharma and the FDA have t he right to inspect and possibly photocopy their 
medical records to verify the accuracy and complete ness of the clinical trial results.  
 
Prior to study participation, all study candidates will: 
• Be informed of the nature and purpose of the study . 
• Be given an explanation of the procedures to be fo llowed in the study. 
• Be given a description of any attendant discomfort s and risks reasonably to be expected from 
the study, as well as from the study product. 
• Be given an opportunity to ask any questions conce rning the study. 
• Be instructed that consent to participate in the s tudy may be withdrawn at any time; and that the 
participant may discontinue participation in the st udy without prejudice.

  Page 58/80   21.8 Confidentiality 
 
The information on individual subjects arising from  this study is to be considered confidential and 
transmitted to the sponsor only in a form that will  not permit identification of the individual. The 
information obtained from the subjects that can be identified with the subject will remain confidentia l 
within the research team. Regulatory and sponsoring  agencies may request access to the study records 
and related medical records of each participating s ubject; the subject’s identity will remain confiden tial 
to the extent permitted by the applicable laws and regulations. The results of the research will be 
released to public agencies including regulatory ag encies, clinical investigators, and research 
organizations without reference to items identifiab le to a particular subject. The results will be pub lished 
such that the identity of the subjects will not be disclosed and cannot be ascertained. National and 
international agencies and sponsoring agencies may request access to the medical records of each 
participating subject, and if requested, the subjec t’s identity will remain confidential. All records will be 
kept in a secure storage area with limited access. 
 
21.9 Premature closure of the study  
 
The sponsor may decide to close this study at any t ime. As far as possible, this should occur after 
consultation with the investigator. The IRB must be  informed. 
Should the study be closed prematurely, all study m aterials (study medication, lab equipment, etc.) 
must be returned to the sponsor, as if the study ha d been completed. 
 
21.10 Liability and insurance 
The sponsor has subscribed to an insurance policy c overing, in its terms and provisions, its legal lia bility 
for injuries caused to participating persons and ar ising out of this research performed strictly in

PREAMBLE  
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has develope d the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement of 
ethical principles for medical research involving h uman subjects , including  research on identifiable 
human material and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole a nd each of its constituent paragraphs should be 
applied with consideration of all other relevant pa ragraphs. 
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Decl aration is addressed primarily to physicians. The 
WMA encourages others who are involved in medical r esearch involving human subjects to adopt these 
principles. 
GENERAL PRINCIPLES  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the p hysician with the words, "The health of my patient 
will be my first consideration," and the Internatio nal Code of Medical Ethics declares that, "A physic ian 
shall act in the patient's best interest when provi ding medical care." 
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and s afeguard the health, well-being and rights of patie nts, 
including those who are involved in medical researc h. The physician's knowledge and conscience are 
dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty. 
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultim ately must include studies involving human subjects . 
6. The primary purpose of medical research involvin g human subjects is to understand the causes, 
development and effects of diseases and improve pre ventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions 
(methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best  proven interventions must be evaluated 
continually through research for their safety, effe ctiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality. 
7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards  that promote and ensure respect for all human 
subjects and protect their health and rights.  
 
8. While the primary purpose of medical research is  to generate knowledge, this goal can never take 
precedence over the rights and interests of individ ual research subjects. 
9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in  medical research to protect the life, health, dign ity, 
integrity, right to self-determination, privacy, an d confidentiality of personal information of resear ch 
subjects. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the physici an 
Protocol: 151042-002  CONFIDENTIAL-PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 73/80   or other health care professionals and never with t he research subjects, even though they have given 
consent. 
10. Physicians must consider the ethical, legal and  regulatory norms and standards for research 
involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international norms and standard s. 
No national or international ethical, legal or regu latory requirement should reduce or eliminate any o f 
the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration. 
11. Medical research should be conducted in a manne r that minimises possible harm to the 
environment. 
12. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by individuals with the 
appropriate ethics and scientific education, traini ng and qualifications. Research on patients or heal thy 
volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician or other heal th 
care professional. 
13. Groups that are underrepresented in medical res earch should be provided appropriate access to 
participation in research. 
14. Physicians who combine medical research with me dical care should involve their patients in 
research only to the extent that this is justified by its potential preventive, diagnostic or therapeu tic value 
and if the physician has good reason to believe tha t participation in the research study will not adve rsely 
affect the health of the patients who serve as rese arch subjects. 
15. Appropriate compensation and treatment for subj ects who are harmed as a result of participating in  
research must be ensured. 
RISKS, BURDENS AND BENEFITS  
16. In medical practice and in medical research, mo st interventions involve risks and burdens. 
Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance of the objective 
outweighs the risks and burdens to the research sub jects. 
17. All medical research involving human subjects m ust be preceded by careful assessment of 
predictable risks and burdens to the individuals an d groups involved in the research in comparison wit h 
foreseeable benefits to them and to other individua ls or groups affected by the condition under 
investigation. 
Measures to minimize the risks must be implemented.  The risks must be continuously monitored, 
assessed and documented by the researcher. 
18. Physicians may not be involved in a research st udy involving human subjects unless they are 
confident that the risks have been adequately asses sed and can be satisfactorily managed.  
When the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or when there is conclusive proof of defin itive 
outcomes, physicians must assess whether to continu e, modify or immediately stop the study. 
VULNERABLE GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS  
19. Some groups and individuals are particularly vu lnerable and may have an increased likelihood of 
being wronged or of incurring additional harm. 
All vulnerable groups and individuals should receiv e specifically considered protection. 
 
20. Medical research with a vulnerable group is onl y justified if the research is responsive to the he alth 
needs and priorities of this group and the research  cannot b carried out in a non-vulnerable group. In  
Protocol: 151042-002  CONFIDENTIAL-PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 74/80   addition, this group should stand to benefit from t he knowledge, practices or interventions that resul t 
from the research. 
SCIENTIFIC REQUIREMENTS AND RESEARCH PROTOCOLS  
21. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific principles , 
be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, and 
adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, animal exp erimentation. The welfare of animals used for 
research must be respected. 
22. The design and performance of each research stu dy involving human subjects must be clearly 
described and justified in a research protocol.  
The protocol should contain a statement of the ethi cal considerations involved and should indicate how  
the principles in this Declaration have been addres sed. The protocol should include information 
regarding funding, sponsors, institutional affiliat ions, potential conflicts of interest, incentives f or 
subjects and information regarding provisions for t reating and/or compensating subjects who are 
harmed as a consequence of participation in the res earch study. 
In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe  appropriate arrangements for post-trial provisions . 
RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEES 
23. The research protocol must be submitted for con sideration, comment, guidance and approval to the 
concerned research ethics committee before the stud y begins. This committee must be transparent in 
its functioning, must be independent of the researc her, the sponsor and any other undue influence and 
must be duly qualified. It must take into considera tion the laws and regulations of the country or 
countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and 
standards but these must not be allowed to reduce o r eliminate any of the protections for research 
subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
The committee must have the right to monitor ongoin g studies. The researcher must provide monitoring 
information to the committee, especially informatio n about any SAEs. No amendment to the protocol 
may be made without consideration and approval by t he committee. After the end of the study, the 
researchers must submit a final report to the commi ttee containing a summary of the study’s findings 
and conclusions.  
PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the p rivacy of research subjects and the confidentiality  
of their personal information. 
INFORMED CONSENT  
25. Participation by individuals capable of giving informed consent as subjects in medical research mu st 
be voluntary. Although it may be appropriate to con sult family members or community leaders, no 
individual capable of giving informed consent may b e enrolled in a research study unless he or she 
freely agrees. 
26. In medical research involving human subjects ca pable of giving informed consent, each potential 
subject must be adequately informed of the aims, me thods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts 
of interest, institutional affiliations of the rese archer, the anticipated benefits and potential risk s of the 
study and the discomfort it may entail and any othe r relevant aspects of the study. The potential subj ect 
must be informed of the right to refuse to particip ate in the study or to withdraw consent to particip ate 
at any time without reprisal. Special attention sho uld be given to the specific information needs of 
individual potential subjects as well as to the met hods used to deliver the information.  
After ensuring that the potential subject has under stood the information, the physician or another 
appropriately qualified individual must then seek t he potential subject's freely-given informed consen t, 
Protocol: 151042-002  CONFIDENTIAL-PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 75/80   preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be exp ressed in writing, the non-written consent must be 
formally documented and witnessed. 
All medical research subjects should be given the o ption of being informed about the general outcome 
and results of the study. 
27. When seeking informed consent for participation  in a research study the physician must be 
particularly cautious if the potential subject is i n a dependent relationship with the physician or ma y 
consent under duress. In such situations the inform ed consent should be sought by an appropriately 
qualified individual who is completely independent of this relationship. 
28. For a potential research subject who is incapab le of giving informed consent, the physician must 
seek informed consent from the legally authorized r epresentative. These individuals must not be 
included in a research study that has no likelihood  of benefit for them unless it is intended to promo te 
the health of the group represented by the potentia l subject, the research cannot instead be performed  
with persons capable of providing informed consent,  and the research entails only minimal risk and 
minimal burden. 
29. When a potential research subject who is deemed  incapable of giving informed consent is able to 
give assent to decisions about participation in res earch, the physician must seek that assent in addit ion 
to the consent of the legally authorized representa tive. The potential subject's dissent should be 
respected. 
30. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, for 
example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents 
giving informed consent is a necessary characterist ic of the research group. In such circumstances the  
physician must seek informed consent from the legal ly authorized representative. If no such 
representative is available and if the research can not be delayed, the study may proceed without 
informed consent provided that the specific reasons  for involving subjects with a condition that rende rs 
them unable to give informed consent have been stat ed in the research protocol and the study has 
been approved by a research ethics committee. Conse nt to remain in the research must be obtained 
as soon as possible from the subject or a legally a uthorized representative. 
31. The physician must fully inform the patient whi ch aspects of the care are related to the research.  
The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient's decision to withdraw from the stud y 
must never adversely affect with the patient-physic ian relationship. 
32. For medical research using identifiable human m aterial or data, such as research on material or 
data contained in biobanks or similar repositories,  physicians must seek informed consent for its 
collection, storage and/or reuse. There may be exce ptional situations where consent would be 
impossible or impractical to obtain for such resear ch. In such situations the research may be done onl y 
after consideration and approval of a research ethi cs committee. 
USE OF PLACEBO  
33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those 
of the best current proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances: 
• Where no proven intervention exists, the use of pla cebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; 
Or 
• Where for compelling and scientifically sound metho dological reasons the use of any 
intervention less effective than the best proven on e, the use of placebo, or no intervention is 
necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an  intervention  
Protocol: 151042-002  CONFIDENTIAL-PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
Version 1.0 (FINAL)  Date:  26-Feb-2018  
  Page 76/80   • And the patients who receive any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, 
or no intervention will not be subject to additiona l risks of serious or irreversible harm as result 
of not receiving the best proven intervention.  
Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this o ption. 
POST-TRIAL PROVISIONS  
34. In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, resea rchers and host country governments should make 
provisions for post-trial access for all participan ts who still need an intervention identified as ben eficial 
in the trial. This information must also be disclos ed to participants during the informed consent proc ess. 
RESEARCH REGISTRATION AND PUBLICATION AND DISSEMINA TION OF RESULTS 
35. Every research study involving human subjects m ust be registered in a publicly accessible database  
before recruitment of the first subject. 
36. Researchers, authors, sponsors, editors and pub lishers all have ethical obligations with regard to  
the publication and dissemination of the results of  research. Researchers have a duty to make publicly  
available the results of their research on human su bjects and are accountable for the completeness 
and accuracy of their reports. All parties should a dhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting.  
Negative and inconclusive as well as positive resul ts must be published or otherwise made publicly 
available. Sources of funding, institutional affili ations and conflicts of interest must be declared i n the 
publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration should not be 
accepted for publication. 
UNPROVEN INTERVENTIONS IN CLINICAL PRACTICE 
37. In the treatment of an individual patient, wher e proven interventions do not exist or other known 
interventions have been ineffective, the physician,  after seeking expert advice, with informed consent  
from the patient or a legally authorized representa tive, may use an unproven intervention if in the 
physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life , re-establishing health or alleviating suffering. This 
intervention should subsequently be made the object  of research, designed to evaluate its safety and 
efficacy. In all cases, new information must be rec orded and, where appropriate, made publicly 
available.

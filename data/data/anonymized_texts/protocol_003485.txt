Version 1.2 Incorporating Non substantial Amendment 2Definition of Key Study Terms
Terms Definition of terms
Baseline Assessments of subjects as they enter a trial before they receive any 
treatment. 
Baseline Diary Run -In 7-day period in which subject completes NRS on handheld 
device daily beginning at Day -7 through Day -1.
Double- Blind The study subjects, Investigator(s)/Site staff and Astellas study team will be 
blinded to treatment.
Early
Discontinuation
(ED)The act of concluding participation, prior to completion of all protocol -
required elements, in a trial by an enrolled subject . Four categories of 
discontinuation are distinguished: a) dropout: Active discontinuation by a 
subject (also a noun referring to such a discontinued subject); b) 
Investigator -initiated discontinuation (e.g., for cause); c) loss to follow -up: 
cessation of participation without notice or action by the subject; d) 
Sponsor- initiated discontinuation. Note that subject discontinuation does not 
necessarily imply exclusion of subject da
ta from analysis. “Termination” 
has a history of synonymous use, but is now considered non -standard.
Endpoint Variable that pertains to the efficacy or safety evaluations of a trial.
Enroll To register or enter a subject into a clinical trial. NOTE: Onc e a subject has 
signed the informed consent , the clinical trial protocol applies to the subject. 
End of Study
(EOS)End of study for each subject has occurred when the final protocol -defined 
assessment has been completed. In this study, the last protocol defined 
assessment is approximately 4 week safter last study drug dose.
End of Treatment 
(EOT)The date the last dos e of study drug was taken by the enrolled subject.
Electronic Patient
Reported Outcomes
(ePRO)An electronic patient -reported outcome (ePRO) is a patient -reported 
outcome that is collected by electronic methods.
Follow -up Period The week sfollowing the f inal dose of study drug for all subjects. This 
includes a Follow -up visit and an End of Study Phone Call.
Independent Data 
Monitoring
Committee
(IDMC)The Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) is responsible for the 
interim futility evaluation of e fficacy data defined in the IDMC Charter. 
Participants in the IDMC include, but may not be limited to: an Independent 
Astellas Statistici an who is not on the study team , and does not 
communicate with study team or Site staff. The IDMC will evaluate 
unblinded data and provide conclusion of futility analysis to Astellas 
Management.
Intervention The drug, device, therapy or process under investigation in a clinical study 
that is believed to have an effect on outcomes of interest in a study. (e.g., 
health -related quality of life, efficacy, safety, pharmacoeconomics). 
Randomization The process of assigning trial subjects to treatment or control groups using 
an element of chance to determine assignments in order to reduce bias.
Randomization will occur after predose assessments and eligibility criteria 
have been confirmed at Visit 3.

Screening A process of active consideration of potential subjects for enrollment in a 
trial.
Screen failure Potential subject who did not meet 1 or more criteria required for 
participation in a trial.
Screening period Period of time before entering the treatment period, usually from the time 
when a subject signs the consent until just before the test drug or 
comparative drug is given to a subject .
Study period Period of time from the first site initiation date to the last site completing the 
study.
Treatment Period Time from Day 1, after first study drug administration through time of last 
study drug dose .Period of time where major interests of protocol object ives 
are observed, and where the test drug or placebo is given to a subject, and 
continues until the last assessment after completing administration of the 
test drug or placebo.
Washout Time (post review of safety laboratory assessments) when a subject 
discontinues use of prohibited medications , as medically indicated and 
based upon the Investigator’s recommendation, to allow for medication to 
be eliminated from the body. Completed prior to Diary Run-In.

Version 1.2 Incorporating Non substantial Amendment 2Throughout the treatment period, beginning on Day 1 (Randomization) through Visit 6/Week 8, 
subject s will record all daily average pain scores (NRS) and any acetaminophen use in the e -diary. 
Subjects will take study drug
once per day (QD). Subject s randomized to ASP 8062 will receive 30mg (1tablet of 25mg and 1 
tablet of 5 mg ).In order to maintain the study blind, ASP8062 andplacebo treated subject s will 
receive matching tablets. 
During the treatment period, subject s will return to the clinic per schedule for safety and efficacy 
procedures (see Schedule of A ssessments for details). Subject s who do not complete the treatment 
period will be requested to complete EOT visit procedures.
Follow -up Period:
Subject s areencouraged to abstain from any concomitant medica tions for the treatment of pain prior 
to Visit 
7/Week 10.Subjects are encouraged to abstain from alcohol. Rescue medication is allowed 
during the follow -up period. Subject s will continue to enter their daily average pain score (NRS) , 
and acetaminophen use into their e -diary and return diaries at 
Visit 7/Week 10. All subject s will return to the site for a follow -upvisit at Day 71, 2weeks following
the EOT visit ( Day 57). A follow -up safety phone call will take place approximate ly 
4 weeks post study drug discontinuation ( Day 85/EOS).

Version 1.2 Incorporating Non substantial Amendment 21INTRODUCTION
Protocol 8062- CL-0101 is a proof -of-concept study  to examine the effects of ASP8062 for 
the treatment of pain in subjects with fibromy algia.
1.1Background
Background on Target Indication
Fibrom yalgia is a complex sy ndrome characterized by  chronic widespread musculosk eletal 
pain often occurring with sy mptoms of depression, fatigue, sleep disturbances and/or 
cognitive complaints. Fibromy algia pain ty picall y includes deep musculoskeletal pain with 
tender points in the shoulder, girdle, torso, hips and extremities. Fibrom yalgia may include 
various somatic sy mptoms, such as headache and irritable bowel s yndrome. The core 
diagnostic criteria for fibromy algia are defined b y the 1990 American College of 
Rheumatology  (ACR) [Wolfe et al, 1990]. While the ACR has published new, a s well as 
subsequent amended criteria [Wolfe et al, 2011; Wolfe et al, 2010], the 1990 version is still 
commonly  utilized in clinical trials. The overall prevalence of fibrom yalgia in the general 
population was estimated to be 2. 2% in the United States (3.4% and 0.5% in females and 
males, respectively ) [Queiroz, 2013].
Drugs used to treat fibromy algia (e.g., pregabalin, duloxetine) provide, at best, only  modest 
relief of s ymptoms and are accompanied b y various side effects including sedation, dizziness, 
cognitive complaints, weight gain, edema and headaches. The approved medications for the 
treatment of fibrom yalgia (US: pregabalin, duloxetine, milnacipran; Japan: pregabalin) result 
in only  an incremental increase in the percent of subject s (~8% to 13%) w ith a 30% pain 
reduction compared to 28% to 34% of subject s with a similar level of improvement on 
placebo in randomized clinical trials [Häuser et al, 2014]. Despite the available approved 
medications, novel medications to treat pain, fatigue, sleep distu rbances and impaired 
cognition without intolerable AEs are required to address an unmet medical need for subject s 
with fibromy algia .
A pathophy siological mechanism for 
fibrom yalgia has not y et been established. The concept 
of altered central processing of nociceptive information has dominated the fibromy algia 
literature [Woolf, 2011; Staud, 2011] . However, clinical studies support the hy pothesis that 
increased glutamate or decreased GABA within the posterior insula may  be related to 
apparent central sensitization in FM pathophy siology  [Foerster et al., 2012; Harris et al., 
2009; Harris et al., 2008].
Background on Pharmacological Concept
γ-aminobuty ric acid (GABA ), the most abundant inhibitory  neurotransmitter, activates 
2types of receptors: ionotropic GABA type A (GABA A) receptors [Olsen & Sieghart, 2008] 
and metabotropic GABA Breceptors [Bowery  et al, 2002]. Based on evidence from GABA B
receptor agonists (baclofen and sodium oxy bate [SXB]), stimulation of GABA Breceptors 
may constitute a putative new targe t in treating disorders such as fibrom yalgia[Russell et al, 
2011]. A double -blind, placebo -controlled randomized fibromy algia clinical trial with the

Version 1.2 Incorporating Non substantial Amendment 2GABA Breceptor agonist SXB provides promise that optimal activation of GABA Breceptors 
might result in clinically  significant improvements in efficacy  for patients with fibromy algia
compared to currentl y available treatments [Spaeth et al, 2012; Russell et al, 2011; Russell et 
al, 2009]. However, the muscle relaxant, brad ycardia -inducing and sedative properti es of 
baclofen and SXB limit their potential widespread therapeutic utility  [Dario & Tomei, 2004; 
Chin et al, 1998]. One possible alternative approach is the use of positive allosteric modulator
(PAM )[Ong & Kerr, 2005]. They  positively  modulate the effect of the agonist by  binding to 
an allosteric site without directly  stimulating the receptor and are, therefore, expected to exert 
agonist -like activity  with lower incidence of undesirable side effects [May  et al, 2004].
Animal studies have established the a ntinociceptive action of GABA Breceptor agonists, 
probably  by effects on both spinal cord and brain [Bowery  et al, 2002]. Altered spinal GABA 
levels may  contribute to the induction phase of chronic pain [Eaton et al, 1999]; and lowering 
GABA levels within the insula is reported to enhance pain in an animal model [Jasmin et al, 
2003].
In a clinical stud y, patients with fibromy algia had significantl y decreased GABA levels in the 
right anterior insula versus the levels seen in healthy  volunteers [Foerster et al, 2012]. 
Diminished inhibitory  neurotransmission resulting from lower concentrations of GABA 
within the brain may  play  a role in the pathoph ysiology  of fibromy algia , suggesting the 
activation of GABA transmission can be a possible therapeutic approach against fibrom yalgia. 
These concepts are supported by  clinical efficacy  of SXB on pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance 
and functionality  in fibromy algia patients [Russell et al, 2011].
Rationale for Clinical Trial with ASP 8062
ASP8062 is an orally  available small -molecule with GABA Breceptor -PAM activity  
discovered b y Astellas Pharma Inc . In the reserpine -induced m yalgiamodel, a rat mod el of 
fibromy algia [Nagakura et al, 2009], ASP8062 significantly  recovered the decrease in muscle 
pressure threshold via the potentiation of GABA Breceptor function . Based on nonclinical 
studies, ASP8062 may  effectivel y ameliorate fibromy algia while minimi zing side effects 
seen with GABA Bagonists . Double- blind, placebo -controlled randomized fibromy algia
clinical trials with the GABA Breceptor agonist SXB provides promise that optimal activation 
of GABA Breceptors might result in clinically  significant impr ovements in efficacy  for 
patients with fibromy algia compared to currently  available treatments [Spaeth et al, 2012; 
Russell et al, 2011; Russell et al, 2009].
1.2Nonclinical and Clinical Data
ASP8062 is an orally  available, new molecular entity  discovered b yAstellas Pharma Inc.

CNS. Three Phase I clinical trials have been completed to date prior to initiation of the 8062 -
CL-0101 study : the single ascending dose (SAD) study  (8062 -CL-0001), the multiple 
ascending dose (MAD) study  (8062
-CL-0002) and the single dose pol ysomnography  study  
(8062 -C
L-0003). The 3 studies included health y male and female subjects.

Version 1.2 Incorporating Non substantial Amendment 2Clinical Pharmacokinetics
In general, the pharmacokinetic properties of ASP8062 administered at doses of 1 -30 mg 
once dail y QD for 14 days w eresimilar to single doses of ASP8062. Tmax values were in the 
same range as single doses (1.5 to 3 hours) and w erenot dose dependent, suggesting 
absorption is consistent following single or multiple dosing. Accumulation following 
multiple doses was predictable and was approximately  2 to 3- fold for AUC. Steady -state 
conditions were observed for all dose levels following approximately  9 day s of dosing. The 
terminal half -life was moderat ely long with on average t1/2 approximately  65 hours. This is
consistent with single dose t 1/2 values suggesting no evidence of time variant 
pharmacokinetics (e.g., auto- induction or auto -inhibition). Based on statistical testing of the 
power model slope, AUC 24and C maxwere dose proportional across a 1 -30 mg QD dose at 
steady -state. Following 14- days of 30 mg QD dosing the predefined mean AUC 24
(2339 ng*hr/mL) exposure limit was approached with one subject having exceeded this 
AUC 24value. No individual su bjects exceeded the mean C maxlimit of 247 ng/mL after a 
single dose of 70 mg or multiple doses of 30 mg QD. Given the comparable PK profile s and 
predictable accumulation, a 70 mg single dose would provide comparable exposures to a 
30mgQD dose at stead y-state. 
Continuous CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) sampling over 24 -hours following a 10 mg or 30 mg 
ASP8062 single dose showed approx imately 1% penetration into the CSF based on AUC 
comparisons of CSF and plasma. Since ASP8062 is 2% unbound to plasma protein, and only  
unbound ASP8062 will enter the CSF , these data suggest most unbound drug enters the CSF 
following a single dose. Finally , no significant effect of a high -fat meal was seen on either 
AUC or C maxat 10 mg supporting dosing with or without food in fut ure studies.
Clinical Safety
Nine ty-four unique subjects have received single or multiple doses of ASP8062 in the 3 Phase 
1 studies (e.g., single ascending dose with food- effect cohort , multiple ascending dose with 
single dose CSF cohort , single dose pol ysomnography  study ) completed prior to the 8062
-CL-
0101 study . Twent y-four subjects were exposed to placebo alone. Overall, ASP8062 was well 
tolerated in all subjects. There were no deaths, no SAEs reported or discontinuations due to 
TEAEs . All AEs were transient and mild or moderate in severit y. The most common possibly  
drug-related TEAEs observed in subjects during phase 1 studies were headache, dizziness and 
lightheadedness. These TEAEs occurred more often following multiple doses of 10 mg(4 
AEs) and 30 mg (7AEs) suggestive of dose dependency . No ASP8062 -related findings 
suggestive of hepatic, cardiovascular, or hematopoietic safet y issues in AEs , changes in 
laboratory  parameters, or vital changes were observed. No effect on QTc or expo sure/QTc 
relationship was observed. No withdrawal effects were seen based on review of AEs, 
cognition assessments, and Clinical I nstitute Withdrawal Assessment for benzodiazepines 
(CIWA-B) after dosing was completed. There was n oimpact to mood orsubjecti ve effects 
(including abuse liability) or a potential effect on (causing/triggering) suicidal ideat ionor 
behavior based on review of AEs, Bond -Lader, Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI)
or Columbia -Suicide Severity  Rating Scale (C-SSRS). A single s ubject did report a buzzed

Version 1.2 Incorporating Non substantial Amendment 2feeling during most day s of ASP8062 administration, however the report was only  made 
during the follow- up outpatient visit .Safety  and tolerability  data from phase 1 studies in 
healthy  male and female subjects show that ASP8062 i s well -tolerated. 
Clinical PSG Data
Changes in slow -wave (stage N3) or rapid ey e movement (REM) sleep as well as increases in 
EEG delta band power have previousl y been seen following GABA Bagonist dosing in 
preclinical rodent studies ,and similarly  in clinical studies of healthy  volunteers and 
narcoleps y patients. Since ASP8062 is a positive allosteric modulator for the GABA B
receptor, activity  on these endpoints in the clinic would provide evidence that ASP8062 can 
lead to modulation of GABA Breceptors in the human brain. The 8062 -CL-
0003 
polysomnograph y (PSG) study  was a 4 period crossover designed trial with single doses of
35 mg ASP8062, 70 mg ASP8062, 40 mg paroxetine or placebo administered on day  1 of 
each period to 20 health y ma le or female volunteers
. Following each nightly  dose of study  
drug pol ysomnographic and sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) measures were taken over the 
subsequent 8 hrs of sleep. A minimum 14 day  washout period occurred between periods. The 
primary  objective of the poly somnograph y stud y was to evaluate the effects of a single dose 
of ASP8062 on stage N3 (slow -wave sleep) and REM sleep in health y subjects. Preliminary  
results showed a dos e dependent significant increase in duration of the primary  endpoint, N3,
over thewhole night of sleep ( Figure 1) following both the 35 mg (p=0.072) and 70 mg 
(p=0.006) single dose. These data are further s upported by  a significant (p<0.1 )increase 
in 
N3 duration (35mg and 70 mg) and % N3 (70 mg) over the first third of the night when the 
majority  of slow- wave sleep occurs. S econdary  measures, usually  associated with slow -wave 
sleep changes: time spent in stage N1andnumber of awakenings showed significan
tor 
directional trends which are consistent with clinical findings with the GABA Bagonist sodium 
oxybate. Interestingl y, contrary to preclinical findings, no significant e ffect of ASP80 62 on 
REM sleep , the other primary  endpoint, was present at either dose over the whole night of 
recording. Finall y, Paroxetine 40 mg was included as an active control in the study  given its 
known effects on REM reduction. A s ignificant ( p<0.001) reduction ontotal minutes REM 
sleep was seen following sin gle dose 40 mg paroxetine both in whole night, and over various 
thirds of the night showing assay  sensitivity .

1.3Summary of Key Safety Information for Study Drugs
Given the early  stage of development, there are currentl y no expected adverse events (AEs) 
for ASP 8062.
ASP8062 may be associated with Treatment Emergent Adverse Events 
(TEAEs) based on the 
nonclinical studies. The following were key  non- clinical observations: headache, dizziness 
and lightheadedness. (Refer to the IB for detailed information) .
1.4Risk Benefit Assessment
No clinical efficacy  studies have been conducted to date with ASP 8062 in the treatment of 
pain associated with fibromy algia: therefore, the actual benefit of ASP 8062 in the treatment 
of pain associated with fibromy algia is unknown. There are no known risks identified with 
this mechanism of action, as ASP8062 is a first- in-class compound. Based on the safet y 
profile from the phase 1 clinical data, the risks appear to be justified from a risk benefit 
assessment. An overview of the risk benefit of ASP8062 can be found in the IB, including 
monitoring and mitigation steps taken to maintain safet y of the subjects while on study 
treatment. Routine risk minimization procedures areplanned in this study . The potential risks 
are reversible, therefore, no additional safet y monitor ing is required .Overall, the 
fibromy algia subjects that will meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be relativel y 
healthy , therefore increased risk is not expected in this population. Please see section 2.2.2
Dose Rationale for safet y margins relative to non -clinical toxicology .

2.2Study Design and Dose Rationale
2.2.1Study Design
This is a phase 2a, r andomized, double -
blind, placebo -controlled paralle l group study to 
assess analgesic efficacy  and safet y of ASP8062 in subject s with fibromy algia . 
The study  will be conducted in the US in up to approximately  35 sites . Approximately  356
subject s are planned to be screened for 178 randomized subject s (89/arm) ( 50% screen fail rate).
The study  will consist of the following study  periods:
Screening period (Day -42 to Day -1) 
Up to 42 day s, which includes the completion of screening procedures ( Visit 1), wash -out 
of prohibited medications (if applicable) , and a 7 -day Baseline Diary  Run -In. The wash-
out of prohibited medications should be completed prior to the initiation of the Baseline 
Diary  Run -In. The Baseline Diary  Run -Inmay be extended up to 2 day s if necessary  in 
the Investigator’s opinion. In gene ral, the Screening period should not exceed 42 day s. 
The Investigator should contact the medical monitor if there are circumstances that would 
cause the subject to exceed 42 day s.
Double- blind randomized treatment period (Day 1 to Day 57 [End of Treatment (EOT)]) 
Eight -weeks of treatment with study  drug and site visits at Day 1, 15, 29 and 57.

Version 1.2 Incorporating Non substantial Amendment 2Follow -up period (Day 58 to Day 85 [End of Study  (EOS)]) 
Includes a follow -up site visit on Day 71, and an (EOS) phone call on Day 85.
Screening Period: 
After signing the informed consent, screening procedures for the subject will start ( Visit 1). 
Subjects will be required to meet both the 1990 and 2010 ACR criteria for fibromy algia. T he 
Investigator or other qualified individual at the site will confirm the diagnos is of 
fibromy algia . 
After signing informed consent and during the screening period, stud y site personnel will 
check that potential subjects have not alread y been pre -screened, initiated or completed 
screening or have been randomized into this study , or another clinical trial, using an 
independent subject participation database.  Independent subject participation databases seek 
to reduce duplicate enrollment by  identify ing duplicates before they  randomize into the study , 
and this measure is consistent with exclusion requirement of not participating in another 
interventional clinical trial during the conduct of the study  (inclusion criterion 18).  I n order 
to complete this check and per the informed consent, study  personnel will request that the 
subject present a valid picture id entification (e.g. driver’s license, passport, state issued ID 
card, etc.) and stud y personnel may be required to provide certain authorized information that 
could potentially  be used to identify  study  subjects identifiers (e.g. date of birth, initials, et c.) 
so that the match algorithms can be run. 
Subjects that meet the inclusion criteria, none of the exclusion criteria, and are not identified 
as a duplicate subject (e.g. certainl y, possible, probably), will be enrolled into the study
. 
Appropriate docume ntation reflecting the subject’s eligibility  according to these criteria will 
be reflective in the subject’s source documents.
Subjects who meet the eligibility  criteria will be instructed , if medicall y appropriate, to wash -
out of an y prohibited medications via phone call. At Visit 2 all subject s who continue to meet 
eligibility  criteria will be provided with an electronic diary  (e-diary ). Subjects will enter a 
1-week Baseline Diary  Run -In, and during this period they  will record their daily  avera ge 
pain score (0 –10 Numerical Rating Scale [NRS])  
 in the e- diary . They  will receive instructions regarding its 
use and begin entering daily  scores.  
Each evening before bed, subject s are to rate 
their average pain during the previous 24 hours using the e -diary . Subjects will need to have a 
mean dail y average pain score ≥ 4 and ≤ 9 (0 -10 NRS), and meet pre -specified daily  average 
pain scores . 
A subject who does not meet the required mean daily  average pain score or who is not 
compliant with e -diary  entries by  completing at least 5 of 7 day s in the baseline run -in, will 
be considered a screen failure and will not be allowed to repeat the pain assessments nor 
rescreen for the stud y.

reviewed before Randomization at Visit 3. After confirmation of eligibility, subject s who 
meet the mean dail y average pain score e ligibility  requirements at this visit will be 
randomized. For subject s that meet the entry  criteria blood samples for laboratory  tests and 
pharmacogenomics will be taken after Randomization and prior to dosing. A single 
pharmacokinetic sample will be taken on day  1 in the clinic at approximately  1-4 hour(s) 
after dosing and once at each visit during weeks 2, 4 and 8/EOT. PK samples at weeks 2, 4, 
and 8/OT should be evenly  split between the following 3 sampling windows: before dosing, 
1-4 hours post dose and >4 hours post dose. Time of the last dose and time of sample 
collection will be captured in the eCRF during these visits .
Rescreening is not allowed. Repeat of screening assessments as mentioned in exclusion 
criteria 11, 12, 14 and 15 may  be done once, after a reasonable timed period at the 
Investigator’s discretion but within the Screening period. 
Double
-Blind Randomized Treatment Period (treatment period):
Subjects will enter the treatment period and will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
ASP8062 or placebo once per day for a period of 8 weeks. 
Acetaminophen may  be used as rescue therapy  for intolerable pain due to fibromy algia 
during the baseline period and in all subsequent study  periods [see section 4.1.3 Rescue 
Medication] . Nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs) will be allowed (with the 
exception of celecoxib), as needed, for non -fibromy algia pain , such as headache.
Subjects are 
encouraged to a bstain from alcohol.
Throughout the treatment period, beginning on Day 1 (Randomization) through 
Visit6/Week 8, subject s will record all dail y average pain scores (NRS) and any 
acetaminophen use in the e -diary .  
 Subject s will take study  drug once per day  (QD) . Subjec ts randomized to 
ASP8062 will receive 30 mg (1 tablet of 25 mg and 1 tablet of 5mg).In order to maintain the 
study  blind, placebo treated subject s will receive matching tablets
. 
During the treatment period, subject s will return to the clinic per schedule for safet y and 
efficacy  procedures (see Schedule of Assessments for details). Subjects who do not complete 
the treatment period will be requested to complete EOT visit p rocedures.
Follow -up Period:
Subjects are encouraged to abstain from any  concomitant medications for the treatment of 
fibromy algia pain prior to Visit 7/Week 10. Subjects are encouraged to abstain from alcohol. 
Rescue medication is allowed during the follo w-up period. Subjects will continue to enter 
their daily  average pain score (NRS) , and acetaminophen use 
into their e -diary  and return diaries at 
Visit 7/Week 10. All subject s will return to the site for 
a follow -upvisit at Day 71, 2 weeks following the EOT visit ( Day 57). A follow -up safet y 
phone call will take place approximately  4 weeks post study  drug discontinuation ( Day
85/EOS).

Version 1.2 Incorporating Non substantial Amendment 2Interim Analys es:
Two interim anal yses for futility  based on the primary  efficacy  endpoint will be conducted. 
The timing of these anal yses will be at approximately 35% and 55% of all subject s with 
Week 8/EOT data [see section 7.7Interim Anal ysis]. The plan for the interim analy sis may  
be modified based on the speed of recruitment.
2.2.2Dose Rationale
The analgesic efficacy  of ASP 8062 w ill be assessed at a dose of 30 mg QD over a period of 
8weeks.
Thedose for the 8062
-CL-0101 study  is 30 mg QD. This dose i s based on collective Phase 1 
experiences with regard to safet y, tolerabilit y, PK, biomarker response, and modeling and 
simulation. I mportantly , the modeled steady  state AUC 24for 30 mg QD (2017 ng*hr/mL) is 
similar to the 70 mg single dose AUC 24, the highest dose tested in the polysomnograph y 
study  (8062- CL-0003). ASP8062 exposures following the 70 mg single dose resulted in 
statistically  significant increases in Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) (N3) compared to placebo; 
suggesting ASP8062 can enter the brain and lea d to modulation of the GABA Breceptor at 
these exposures. In addition, the modeled C trough (mean 55 ng/mL) following a 30 mg QD 
dose is well above the exposures in a rat vagotomy  FM model (EC80 = 0.488 ng/mL).
Regarding safety  and tolerability  of ASP8062, modeling and simulation of anticipated human 
Cmax(100 ng/mL )and AUC 24(2017 ng.hr/mL ) mean exposures following a 30 mg QD dose 
fall below the previously defined human mean exposure limits, 247 ng/mL  and 
2339 ng*hr/mL respectively . These limits were appro ached in the highest SAD cohort 
(70mg) and MAD cohort (30 mg QD) and were not associated with an y safety or tolerabilit y 
concerns. 
The 4 and 13- wk dog toxicology  studies both identified the 3 mg/kg dose as a NOAEL. 
LOEALs (10 mg/kg) in these studies were both defined by  vomiting and salivation in the 
dogs , the most sensitive toxicological species. These findings were reversible during the 4 -
week recovery  period and are monitorable in the clinical studies. There is approximately  a 
2-3-fold and 4- fold safet y margin to the LOAELs AUC 24and C maxexposures respectively, 
compared to the observed mean AUC 24from a 30 mg QD dose in the MAD study .AUC 24
and C maxsafet y margins to the 13 -week toxicology NOAELs are 1 -and 2 -fold respectivel y.
Thus, a dose of 30 mg QD should provide exposures which have shown pharmacological 
activity  at the GABA Breceptor on PSG endpoints but still be below exposures associated 
with toxicity  in nonclinical studies.

4.4Blinding
4.4.1Blinding Method 
This is a double blind study . Subjects will be randomized to receive ASP 8062 or placebo in a 
blinded fashion such that neither the investigator, Sponsor’s study  management team, clinical 
staff, nor the subject will know which agent is being administered. The randomization
number will be assigned based on information obtained from the Interactive Response 
Technology  (IRT).
The randomization list will be provided to Global Pharmacovigilance of Astellas, who will 
break the codes for all suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction cases for reporting 
purposes only . They  are also capable of breaking the code in emergency  situations. The 
randomization list is also provided to BioAnal ysis Scientist for the purposes of PK anal ysis 
prior to unblinding.  The PK analy sis results will not be shared prior to unblinding at 
database lock. 
4.4.2Confirmation of the Indistinguishability of the Study Drugs 
The appearance and the form of both the drug and packaging are identical to those of th eir 
matching placebo. 
4.4.3Retention of the Assignment Schedule and Procedures for Treatment Code 
Breaking 
The randomization list and study  medication blind will be maintained by  the Interactive 
Response Technology  (IRT) sy stem. Details of steps to maintain t reatment blind in the study  
team during the interim analy sis will be described in an I nterim Anal ysis Plan (IAP).

Version 1.2 Incorporating Non substantial Amendment 24.4.4Breaking the Treatment Code for Emergency 
The treatment code for each randomized subject will be provided by  the IRT in the event of a
medica l emergency  requiring knowledge of the treatment assigned to the subject. The time,
date, subject number and reason for obtaining an y of these codes, and therefore breaking the
blind, must be documented in the study  file. They must only  be requested by  theinvestigator
or other persons designated as sub- investigators. No subjects or other study  personnel will be
made aware of the treatment given to an y subject unless a medical emergency necessitates
such disclosure. Unblinding of the stud y drug should only  be considered for subject safet y or 
when critical therapeutic decisions are contingent upon knowing the blinded study  drug 
assignment. An yunblinding by  the investigational staff must be reported immediately  to the 
Sponsor and must include an explanation o f why the study  drug was unblinded. If possible, 
the Sponsor should be contacted prior to unblinding of the stud y drug.
4.4.5Breaking the Treatment Code by the Sponsor
The Sponsor may  break the treatment code for subjects who experience a Suspected 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR), in order to determine if the individual case 
or a group of cases requires expedited regulatory  reporting. Individual Emergency  Codes will 
be provided to the limited staff who are responsible to break the codes for all SUSA R cases 
for reporting purposes.
4.5Assignment and Allocation
All subject numbers will be assigned using the Interactive Response Technology  (IRT) 
starting at Screening . Randomization will be stratified by  site. All subjects will have a unique, 
10-digit subject number. The first 5 digits of this number will be the investigator’s site
number. The second 5 digits assigned will represent the subject’s accession number. This will 
be the number that identifies a subject during the course of the stud y.
All subj ects who meet the eligibility  criteria will be randomized. Subjects will be randomized 
in a 1:1 ratio to ASP8062 or placebo according to the randomization schedule through IRT. 
The site personal will dispense the treatment according to the IRT s ystem’s ass ignment.
If a subject is assigned a randomization number, but does not receive study  drug, the 
randomization number will not be used again. The randomization schedules that determine 
subject treatment will be computer
-generated b y IRT before the beginning of the study .
Specific procedures for randomization through the I RT are contained in the study -specific 
IRTmanual.

Version 1.2 Incorporating Non substantial Amendment 25TREATMENTS AND EVALUATION
5.1Dosing and Administration of Study Drug(s) and Other 
Medication(s)
5.1.1 Dose/Dose Regimen and Administration Period
Subjects randomized to the ASP8062 group will receive ASP 8062 30 mg (1 tablet of 25 mg 
and 1 tablet of 5 mg) QD for the duration of 8 weeks. Subject randomized to the placebo 
group will receive placebo to match ASP 8062 ( 2 tablets) QD for the duration of 8 wee ks. 
Doses should be taken in the morning with or without food. In case a subject forgets a dose, 
the dose should be taken as soon as they  remember but prior to bedtime that day . The next 
day's dose should still be taken as planned. Two doses should not be taken in the same day .
Subjects should be reminded not to drive and/or operate machinery  within 4 hours of dosing, 
this applies only  to the 1st dose of study  drug. 
At Randomization and at Visit 4(Week 2) subjects will receive the assigned treatment 
sufficient for a period of 2 weeks (including morning dose on the day  of the next visit). At 
Visit 5(Week 4) subjects will receive the assigned treatment sufficient for a period of 
4weeks. 
A single pharmacokinetic sample will be taken on day  1 in the clinic at approximately  
1-4hour(s) after dosing and once at each visi t during weeks 2, 4 and 8/EOT. PK samples at 
weeks 2, 4, and 8/OT should be evenl y split between the following 3 sampling windows: 
before dosing, 1
-4 hours post dose and >4 hours post dose. Time of the last dose and time of 
sample collection will be captured in the eCRF during these visits .There are no fasting 
requirements for the pharmacokinetic samples but date and time of the dose taken prior to 
collecting the pharmacokinetic sample, as wel l as the date and time of the last meal in 
relation to that dose will be captured in the electronic case report form (eCRF). 
5.1.2Increase or Reduction in Dose of the Study Drug(s)
The dose of 30 mg QD of ASP 8062 was tested in the Phase 1 multiple dose study  
(30mgQD). This 
30mg QD dose w as well tolerated and no maximum tolerated dose was 
determined. Stopping criteria are presented in Section 6.1. Study  8062- CL-0101 is a fixed 
dose, proof -of-concept study . In order to adequately  evaluate the h ypothesis, it is important to 
assess efficacy  and safety  across a common dose, therefore, dos e increases and decreases are 
not allowed.

5.2Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
5.2.1Demographics
Date of birth, sex, race, ethnicity , height, weight, and BMI will be recorded at Screening 
(Visit 1). Height will be measured at Screening only. Weight will also be collected prior to 
Randomization and at Week 8/EOT .
5.2.2Medical History
A detailed medical hist ory (including ps ychiatric history ) for each subject will be obtained at 
Screening , including prior medication and contraception use. All relevant past and present 
conditions, as well as prior surgical procedures will be recorded. Presence of current and/or 
pastmajor depressive disorder will be captured in the eCRF. Any history  of diagnosis of the 
following disorders will be captured in the eCRF: temporomandibular disorders, irritable 
bowel sy ndrome, chronic tension ty pe headache, migraine, chronic low bac k pain, my algic 
encephalomy elitis/chronic fatigue s yndrome, interstitial cy stitis/painful bladder s yndrome, 
endometriosis, and vulvody nia.
Details on family  history  of fibrom yalgia, long QT sy ndrome, depression and bipolar 
disorder will be obtained for each subject.
5.2.3Diagnosis of the Target Disease, Severity, and Duration of Disease 
The diagnosis fibromy algia must be confirmed by the investigator and documented in the 
subject’s medical notes (meeting both the 1990 and 2010 American College of 
Rheumatolog y clinical classification criteria for fibromyalgia). Duration of fibromyalgia , date 
of onset of fibrom yalgia sy mptoms, date of fibromy algia diagnosis will be recorded in the 
eCRF . 
The number of tender points, WPI  and SS score will be completed by  the clinician on a tablet 
device during the Screening visit.
Subjects should have a WPI  ≥7 and SS score ≥ 5 or WPI  of 3 to 6 and SS scale score ≥ 9.
Severity  of pain due to fibromy algia will be assessed through the PGI S and the FIQR and

Version 1.2 Incorporating Non substantial Amendment 2The Complex Medical Symptoms Invento ry (CMSI ) is designed to aid clinicians in collecting 
information from fibromy algia patients regarding their disease -specific s ymptoms and to 
characterize the diagnosis. The inventory  contains 2parts: a s ymptom checklist to be 
completed b y patients, and a diagnostic inventory  completed by  the clinician . In this study , 
only the s ymptom checklist will be utilized.
The sy mptom checklist contains 39 items (males) or 41 items (females) . For each s ymptom 
question, patients mark a box to indicate if the s ymptom: 1) has occurred for at least 
3months in the past y ear, and/or 2) has occurred for a 3- month period during their lifetime . 
Only the boxes that apply  should be checked. 
The CMSI  will be completed on the tablet device by  the subject at Baseline Diary  Run -In
(Visit 2).
5.2.4Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview
The M.I.N.I. International Neurops ychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I. 
7.0) is a short, structured 
diagnostic interview administered by  trained personnel . 
The instrument captures the major 
Axis I  psychiatric disorders in DSM -V and ICD -10, and has demonstrated equivalent 
reliability , validity , and decreased interview time when compared to the Structured Clinical 
Interview for DSM diagnoses (SCI D-P). 
Each module begins with screening questions that 
are answered yes or no. A negative response in the screening algorithm advances the 
interview to the next module, whereas a positive response will prompt additional questions 
that ask patients to characterize behavior with “y es” or “no” responses . Some questions 
contain a recall period (e.g., “Past Two Weeks”, “Past Episode”, and “Current Episode”) . 
After completion of the additional questions, the clinician indicates whether or not the 
diagnostic criteria have been met, based on the instrument scoring crite ria[Sheehan et al, 
1997; L ecrubier et al, 1997; Sheehan et al, 1998; Amorim et al, 1998] .
The M.I.N.I . 7.0 will be completed at 
Screening on paper by trained site personnel, in 
accordance with the structured interview requirements.
5.2.5 Hospital Anxiety and De pression Scale (depression subscale only)
The Hospital Anxiety  and Depression Scale ( HADS )is a 14- item self-report scale developed 
for the assessment of anxiety  and depression in non-psychiatric populations . 
Each item is 
rated on a 4 -point L ikert-type sca le with vary ing level descriptors specific to each item. For 
the purposes of this study, only  the 7 item depression subscale will be administered to 
monitor subjects for moderate to severe s ymptoms of depression [Snaith, 2003; White et al, 
1999; Hermann, 1997; Zigmond & Snaith, 1983] . 
The HADS depression subscale will be recorded on a tablet device at Screening and at 
Randomization before dosing. 
Subject s will be excluded in case they  have a score of > 14 at 
Screening or Randomization . The HADS depression subscale will also be administered at 
Week 8/EOT.

The subject s will use a handheld device, e -diary , to report dail y average pain NRS scores, 
 and to capture rescue medication use. Data will be automatically  
transmitted to a central database.
The questionnaires on efficacy  to be performed during the clinic visits (FIQR, PGI C, PGIS, 
 will be reported on a tablet device [see also 
Appendix 12.6]. 
Subjects will receive instructions on how to complete the e- diary /tablet and will be counseled 
on the importance of completing the e -diary  daily and should be retrained on the use of the 
diary  as needed. During the start of Baseline Diary Run -In (Visit 2), the subject will be given 
sufficient time to practice e -diary  completion, supervised b y trained site personnel.
Questionnaires need to be completed b y the subject prior to an y other study assessment.
During the 
Baseline Diary  Run -Inperiod, subjects must record dail y average pain ratings on
a minimum of 5 of 7 days in order to be randomized in the study .
5.3.1.1Daily Average Pain Numerical Rating Scal e
The Dail y Average Pain Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) is a generic instrument for the 
assessment of pain, consisting of a single question that asks subjects to record their dail y 
average pain on an 11 -point scale, where 0 anchors ‘no pain’ and 10 ‘pain as bad as you can  
imagine’ . The recall period is the last 24 hours. To be eligible for the study  subjects should be
compliant with daily  pain recordings during the Baseline Diary  Run -Inperiod, as defined b y 
the completion of a minimum of 5 of 7 daily  avera ge pain ratings and agrees to complete 
daily  diaries throughout the duration of the study .
The NRS should be completed by  the subject daily for the duration of the study , in the 
evening and at a consistent time each day . Throughout the study , the subjects should be 
counseled on completion of daily  e-diary  entries and should be retrained on the use of the 
diary  as needed.
The NRS will be collected from the start of the baseline run- in period through Week 10.

Version 1.2 Incorporating Non substantial Amendment 25.3.1.3Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire Revised
The Fibrom yalgia Impact Questionnaire Revised ( FIQR ) was developed to capture the total 
spectrum of problems related to fibrom yalgia and the responses to therap y. The original FIQ 
and FIQR have been extensively  used as an index of disease activity  and therapeu tic efficacy . 
The 21- item FIQR contains 3 domains: activities of daily  living, overall impact, and 
symptoms . Subjects answer each question on an 11 -pt numerical rating scale, with anchors 
appropriate to each question. The recall period is the last 7 day s or, for the physical function
domain, the last time the activity  was performed if not within the 7 day  recall period [Bennett 
et al, 2009] .
The FIQR will be completed b y the subject on the tablet device at Randomization and at the 
Week 2, 4, 8/EOT and Week 10 visit. At Screening the subject only completes the pain item 
of the FIQR. 
5.3.1.4Patient Global Impression of Change  and Patient Global Impression of 
Severity
ThePatient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and Patient Global I mpression of Severity  
(PGIS)areadaptable global indices that capture the patient’s perspective on a defined 
condition. The PGIC is a self -administered 7 -pt Likert scale that asks subjects to evaluate 
their fibromy algia relative to baseline. The PGIC is anchored b y “very much improved ” and 
“very  much worse.” The PGISis a self -administered 6 -ptLikert scale 
that asks subjects to 
evaluate how their fibromy algia is now . The PGIS is anchored b y “no s ymptoms” to “very  
severe”. 
Both the PGIC and the PGI Swill be completed by  the subject on the tablet device at the site . 
The PGICwill be completed at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 10. The PGIS will be completed at 
Randomization, Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 10 .

provided in the laboratory manual. Anal ysis of ASP8062 and any  metabolites (if applicable) 
will be performed using a validated method at a bioanalytical laboratory specified b y the 
Sponsor.
5.4Safety Assessment
Safety  will be assessed through AEs , safety  laboratory  tests (chemistry , hematology  and 
urinaly sis), phy sical examination, vital signs, 12- lead ECGs and the C -SSRS. Unscheduled 
assessments will be performed if clinicall y warranted.
ASP8062 penetrates the CNS in humans; therefore, a prospect ive assessment of suicidality  
will be performed using the C -SSRS.
5.4.1Vital Signs
Single measures of sitting resting blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and pulse rate values will 
be obtained at each visit (except for Visit 2) and should be conducted prior to blood d raws. 
Blood pressure should alway s be measured on the same arm of the subject and preferabl y in 
the same position (sitting or supine) .
Body temperature will be assessed at Screening , Randomization and Week 8/EOT only . The 
method of recording body temperatu re must be the same between visits (acceptable methods 
are oral or t ympanic temperature).
Vital signs should be taken before scheduled blood draws.
5.4.2Adverse Events

performed locall y at Baseline Diary  Run -Inand Visit 3(prior to Randomization ). 
Results of the urinary  drug and alcohol screen tests will be noted in the patient files.
A serum pregnancy  test will be performed for all female subjects of child -bearing potential at 
Screening . A urine pregnancy  test will be performed for female subjects of child -bearing 
potential prior to Randomization and at Week 8/EOT and the Week 10/FUvisits. 
If the clinical laboratory  results are outside the normal range, the Investigator will document 
his/her assessment as clinically  significant or not clinically  significant. 
Unscheduled tests or a repeat of abnormal laboratory  test(s) may  be performe d if clinically  
indicated and to follow -up on suspected AEs.
5.4.4Physical Examination 
The subject will be examined by  a medical doctor or other allied professional at Screening, 
Randomization (predose), Week 8 and Week 10 . Phy sical examination may also be 
performed at unscheduled visits if necessary. It includes examination of main body  systems, 
such as cardiovascular s ystem, chest/lungs, abdomen, neurological state and musculoskeletal 
system. 
At the Screening visit ( Visit 1) the phy sicalexamination will inc lude a tender point exam. 
For the tender point examination, an incremental pressure with a maximum force of 
approximately  4 kg will be applied to the 18 possible tender point sites. A positive tender 
point count is a response from the subject indicating a subjective feeling of discomfort 
following pressure ≤ 4 kg. 
The medical doctor will conduct the exam, determine findings and assess any  abnormalities 
as to clinical significance and whether an y exclusion criteria have been met. After stud y drug 
administra tion, new abnormal findings or a worsening of an ongoing abnormal condition 
must be recorded as an adverse event.

A 12 -lead ECG will be performed at Screening , Randomization , EOT and FU visits. All 
ECGs should be taken before an y schedul ed blood draws. ECGs will be recorded with the 
subject in the supine position, after the subject has been l ying down for approximately  5 
minutes. There should be at least 5 minutes between ECG measurements in case a repeat is 
needed. An y clinicall y signifi cant adverse changes on the ECG will be reported as AEs. 
Printouts of all ECGs, marked with the subject number and initials, visit date and visit 
number should be stored in the subject’s source data.
5.4.6Colombia Suicide Severity Rating Scale
The Columbia Suicide Severit y Rating Scale (C -SSRS) was developed as a screening tool to 
identify  suicide risk . The interview asks subjects detailed questions regarding suicidal 
ideation, behaviors, intensity  of ideation, and attempts. Response options and recall perio ds 
vary in accordance with the nature of the question . The scale requires training to ensure 
appropriate administration
. 
The C -SSRS will be performed by  train ed site staff via interview at Screening , Randomization , 
Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 10. At Screening , the “ Screening /baseline” version is to be used to 
determine eligibility . During all subsequent visits, the “Since last visit” version is used to 
monitor on- study  suicidal ideation and behavior after the initial assessment. Responses will be 
reported on the ta blet device . 
Subjects who have a history  of suicide attempt or suicidal behavior within the last 12 months, 
or has suicidal ideation within the last 12
months (a response of “y es” to questions 4 or 5 on 
the suicidal ideation domain), will be excluded.
5.4.7Safety Narrative Plan 
The subject narratives will be detailing potential signals of abuse, for more details please 
refer to Appendix 12.7 and 12.8
5.5Adverse Events and Other Safety Aspects
5.5.1 Definition of Adverse Events
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject, temporall y associated with the use 
of a medicinal produc t, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE 
can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  
finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporall y associated with the use of a 
medicinal product.
In order to identify  any events that may  be associated with study  procedures and could lead to 
a change in the conduct of the study , Astellas collects AEs even if the subject has not 
received treatment. AE collection begins after the signing of t he informed consent and will be 
collected until 30 day safter the last dose of stud y drug.

14 Aug 2017 Astellas Page 62of 112
Version 1.2 Incorporating Non substantial Amendment 2An abnormality  identified during a medical test (e.g., laboratory  parameter, vital sign, ECG 
data, ph ysical examination) should be defined as an AE only  if the abnormality  meets 1 of the 
following criteria:
Induces clinical signs or sy mptoms
Requires active intervention
Requires interruption or discontinuation of study  drug
The abnormalit y or test value is clinically  significant in the opinion of the investigator.
5.5.2Definition of Serious Adverse Events
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it results 
in any  of the following outcomes: 
Results in death
Is life -threatening (an AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death)
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  or substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions 
Results in congenital anomaly , or birth defect
Requires inpatient hospitalization (except for planned procedures as allowed per study ) or 
leads to prolongation of hospitalization (hospitalization for 
treatment/observation/examination caused b y AE is to be considered as serious) 
Other medicall y importa nt events (defined in paragraph below)
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result i n death or hospitalization but may  jeopardize the 
subject or may  require intervention to prevent 1 of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above. These events, including those that may  result in disability /incapacity , should also 
usually  be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that 
do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse. 
The Sponsor has a list of events that they  classify  as “alway s serious” events . If an AE is 
reported that is considered to be an event per this classification as “alway s serious”, 
additional information on the event may  be requested. 
5.5.3Special Situations
Special Situations
observed in association with the study  drug(s) (e.g., test drug, comparator, 
or background therap y) administered to the subject as part of the study  are collected as 
described in the table below. These Special Situations are not considered adverse events but 
can be associated with or result in an AE. An AE that may  be associated with or result from a 
Special Situation is to be assessed separatel y from the Special Situation and captured in the

5.5.4Criteria for Causal Relationship to the S tudy Drug
AEs that fall under either "Possible" or "Probable" should be defined as "AEs whose relationship to 
the study drugs could not be ruled out" .
Causal relationship to 
the studydrugCriteria for ca usal relationship
Not Related A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal  
relationship to study drug administration which makes a causal relationship 
improbable, and /orin  which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease 
provide plausible explanations.
Possible A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the study drug, but which could also be 
explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. Information 
on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.
Probable A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the study drug, unlikely to be attributed 
to concurrent disease or  other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a 
clinicall y reasonable response on re -administration (rechallenge) or 
withdrawal (dechallenge).
5.5.5Criteriafor Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity  of each adverse event
Mild: No disruption of normal daily  activities
Moderate: Affect normal dail y activities
Severe: Inability  to perform dail y activities
5.5.6Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
The collection of AEs and the expedited reporting of SAEs will start following receipt of the 
informed consent and will continue to 30 day safter the last dose of stud y drug.

5.5.7Follow-up ofAdverse Events
All AEs occurring during or after the subject has discontinued the study  are to be followed up 
until resolved or judged to be no longer clinicall y significant, or until they  become chronic to 
the extent that they  can be fully  characterized by  the investigator. 
If during AE follow -up, the AE progresse sto an"SAE ", or if a subject experiences a new 
SAE , the investig ator must immediately  report the information to the S ponsor . 
Please refer to Appendix 12.3 Liver Safet y Monitoring and Assessment fordetailed 
instructions on Drug Induced Liver Injury .
5.5.8Monitoring of Common Serious Adverse Events
No common SAEs have been identified at this time. Common SAEs are SAEs commonly  
anticipated to occur in the study  populatio n independent of drug exposure. SAEs classified as 
“common” are provided in Appendix 12.4 Common Serious Adverse Events for reference. 
The list does NOT change the investigator’s reporting obligations or prevent the need to 
report an AE meeting the definition of an SAE as detailed above. The purpose of this list is to 
alert the i nvestigator that some events reported as SAEs may  not require expedited reporting 
to the regulatory  authorities based on the classification of “common SAEs” as specified in 
Appendix 12.4 Common Serious Adverse Events. 
The Sponsor will monitor these events 
throughout the course of the stu dy for any  change in frequency . Any changes to this list will 
be communicated to the participating investigational s ites. I nvestigators must report 
individual occurrences of these events as stated in Section 5.5.6 Reporting of Serious 
Adverse Events. 
5.5.9Adverse Events of Special Interest
Any AEs/SAEs that are considered abuse of the study  drug will be collected and followed.
To complete subject narratives, additional information around AEs of special interest will be 
collected. AEs of special interest related to potential abuse are listed in [Appendix 12.7
Adverse Events of Interest Related to Abuse].

information.
When the outcome of the pregnancy  falls under the criteria for SAE s (spontaneous abortion, 
induced abortion, stillbirth, death of newborn, congenital anomal y [including anomaly in a 
miscarried fetus]], the investigator should respond in accordance with [Section 5.5.6
Reporting of Serious Adverse Event]. Additional information regarding the outcome of a 
pregnancy  (which is categorized as an SAE ) is mentioned below.
●"Spontaneous abortion "includes miscarriage, aborti on and missed abortion.
●Death of an infant within 1 month after birth should be reported as an SAE regardless of 
its relationship with the study  drug.
●If an infant dies more than 1 month after the birth, it should be reported if a relationship 
between the death and intrauterine exposure to the study  drug is judged as "possible" by  
the investigator.
●In the case of a delivery  of a living newborn, the "normalit y" of the infant is evaluated at 
the birth.
●Unless a congenital anomaly  isidentified prior to sponta neous abortion or miscarriage, 
the embry o or fetus should be assessed for congenital defects b y visual examination.
5.5.11Emergency Procedures and Management of Overdose
No information on overdose with ASP8062 in humans is available. Following a suspected 
overdo se, study  subjects should be managed with sy mptomatic and supportive care and 
observed in a controlled medical setting according to the current standard of care. The 
Medical Monitor/Expert should be contacted as applicable.

Version 1.2 Incorporating Non substantial Amendment 2If a subject is discontinued from the study  with an ongoing AE or an unresolved laboratory  
result that is significantl y outside of the reference range, the investiga tor will attempt to 
provide follow -up until the condition stabilizes or no longer is clinically  significant. 
Discontinuation Criteria from Treatment for Individual Subjects:
1.Subject develops unacceptable toxicity
2.Subject is lost to follow -updespite reasonable efforts by  the investigator to locate the 
subject
3.Subject withdraws consent for further treatment
4.Female subject becomes pregnant
5.Monitoring of liver safety is done to address the potential for liver toxicity  (see 
[Appendix 12.3] for details).
If an individual subject has an ALT or AST result > 3 x UL N or TBL > 2 x ULN, testing
should be repeated within 48 to 72 hours of notification of the test results. Then twice 
weekl yliver safet y tests will be performed until normalization or study  discontinuation.
Any subject that meets the following criteria below [outlined in the FDA Guidance for
Industry , Drug -Induced Liver Injury : Pre-marketing Clinical Evaluation (July  2009)]

7.4.1Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The primary  efficacy  endpoint is change from baseline to Week 8 in mean daily  average pain 
score asses sed b y NRS (0 to 10 scale) in the subject’s daily e -diary . 
7.4.1.1Primary Analysis
The primary  anal ysis for the primary  endpoint of c hange from baseline to Week 8 in the mean 
daily  average pain NRS will use a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) anal ysis, where 
the model will include the effects for treatment group, center (pooled where necessary ), time 
(study  Week 1 to 8) and treatment- by-time interaction, as well as the covariates of baseline 
mean dail y average pain NRS and baseline pain -by-time interaction and subject as a random 
effect . 
The unconstrained between -time-point covariance structure will be used. If this is not 
feasible, additional covariance structures will be considered and details will be provided in the 
SAP. This analy sis will utilize observed d ata, and there will be no imputation for missing data. 
The treatment group contrast for change from baseline to Week 8 will be the primary  statistical 
inference obtained from the MMRM analy sis. Least squares estimates for the primary  endpoint 
will be shown for each treatment group, and for the treatment comparisons of ASP8062 vs 
placebo with 2 -sided 90% confidence intervals. A one-sided 5% significance level will be used 
for the comparison involving ASP8062 vs placebo. 
The hy pothesis for comparisons is giv en as follows:
H0: The change from baseline to Week 8 in the mean dail y average pain NRS for 
ASP8062 group is the same as (or worse than) the placebo group. 
H1: The change from baseline to Week 8 in the mean dail y average pain NRS for 
ASP8062 group is 
less than the placebo group.

Version 1.2 Incorporating Non substantial Amendment 27.4.1.2Sensitivity Analysis
The following sensitivity anal yses will be conducted for the primary  endpoint. 
●A sensitivity  anal ysis for the primary  endpoint will use the same MMRM model as 
described in [Section 7.4.1.1 Primary  Anal ysis]. For this sensitivity  anal ysis, multiple 
imputation will be used for imputation of any  missing data, using ‘Jump to Reference’ 
algorithm (where placebo is the refe rence group) [Carpenter et al. 2013] for subjects 
who discontinue due to lack of efficacy  or AEs and standard regression- based multiple 
imputation for subjects with missing data for other reasons. 
●A sensitivity  anal ysis will use modified baseline observat ion carried forward (mBOCF) 
for missing data at Week 8 with analy sis of covariance (ANCOVA), with covariates of 
baseline mean daily  average pain NRS score and center. mBOCF is defined as 
imputation by  baseline observation carried forward BOCF for subjects who discontinue 
due to lack of efficacy  or AEs , and imputation by  LOCF for subjects with missing data 
at Week 8 for other reasons. 
●A sensitivity  anal ysis for t he primary  endpoint will use the same MMRM model as 
described in [Section 7.4.1.1 Primary  Anal ysis] using the PPS .
7.4.1.3Subgroup Analysis
Subgroup anal ysis of primary  efficacy  endpoint will be considered for following subgroups: 
gender, age catego ry, category  of baseline pain score, with or without depression, and central 
or peripheral nerve component (subgroups b y CMSI , ).
Additional subgroups will be 
considered as appropriate. More details about subgroup anal ysis will be provided in the SAP. 
7.4.2Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
The secondary  efficacy  endpoints are defined in [Section 2.3.2 Secondary  Endpoints]. 
The primary  anal ysis for the secondary  endpoints of mean dail y average pain score (≥ 30% 
and 50% reduction from baseline to Week 8 and to EOT) will be carried out with the Fisher’s 
Exact Test. For the Week 8 anal ysis, subjects with missing data will be classified as non-
responders (BOCF) and an addi tional anal ysis will use mBOCF. For the EOT anal ysis, 
LOCF will be used. 
The primary  anal ysis for the change from baseline to Weeks 2, 4 and 8 for the FIQR 
subscales of Ph ysical Function, Sy mptoms and Overall Impact will use the same MMRM 
analysis as desc ribed in [ Section 7.4.1.1 Primary  Analy sis]. The primary  analy sis for the 
change from baseline to EOT for the FIQR subscales will use an ANCOVA model, with 
covaria tes of baseline FIQR subscale score and center. An additional ANCOVA anal ysis will 
be conducted at Week 8 with mBOCF for subjects with missing data. 
The primary  anal ysis for the PGI C will use the proportional odds model for ordinal data, with 
model term f or treatment group. The analy sis will be used to assess PGIC at Weeks 2, 4, 8 
and EOT. For subjects with missing data, the analy sisat Weeks 2, 4 and 8 will be conducted 
using imputation of ‘No Change’ for subjects who discontinue due to lack of efficacy  or AEs,

7.7Interim Analysis (and Early Discontinuation of the Clinical Study)
Two interim analyses for futility  based on the primary  efficacy  endpoint will be conducted. 
The t iming of these anal yses will be at approximately 35% and 55% of subject s with
Week 8/EOT data. The plan for the interim analy sis may  be modified based on speed of 
recruitment. These anal yses will be conducted b y an Astellas statistician with results 
review ed by an Astellas IDMC. The Astellas statistician and other members of the Astellas 
IDMC are external to the study  team. No one within the study  team will be unblinded to the 
treatment allocation or interim results. Details of the interim anal ysis procedur e, steps to 
maintain treatment blind in t he study  team and criteria for s topping the study  will be 
described in an Interim Analy sis Plan (IAP).
7.8Handling of Missing Data, Outliers, Visit Windows, and Other 
Information
As a general principle, no imputation of missing data will be done. Exceptions are the start 
and stop dates of AEs and concomitant medication and last dose date of double blind study  
drug. The imputed dates will be used to allocate the concomitant medication and AEs to a 
treatment group, in add ition to determining whether an AE is/is not treatment emergent. The

Version 1.2 Incorporating Non substantial Amendment 212.3Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment 
Any subject enrolled in a clinical study  with active drug therapy  and reveals an increase of 
serum aminotransferases (AT) to > 3 × ULN or bilirubin > 2 × ULN should undergo detailed 
testing for liver enzy mes (including at least ALT, AST, AL P, and TBL). Testing should be 
repeated within 72 hours of notification of the test results. For studies for which a central 
laboratory  is used, alerts will be generated by  the central laboratory  regarding moderate and 
severe liver abnormality  to inform the investigator, study  monitor and study team. Subjects 
should be asked if they  have an y symptoms suggestive of hepatobiliary  dysfunction.
Definition of Liver Abnormalities
Confirmed abnormalities will be characterized as moderate and severe where ULN:
ALT or AST Total Bilirubin
Moderate > 3 ×ULN or > 2 ×ULN
Severe* > 3 ×ULN and > 2 ×ULN
In addition, the subject should be considered to have severe hepatic abnormalities for an y of 
the following:
ALT or AST > 8 × ULN.
ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks. 
ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and International Normalized Ratio (I NR) > 1.5 (If INR testing 
is applicable/evaluated).
ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophi lia (> 5%). 
The investigator may  determine that abnormal liver function results, other than as described 
above, may  qualify  as moderate or severe abnormalities and require additional monitoring 
and follow -up.
Follow-up Procedures
Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughly

case report form (LA -CRF) that has been developed globall y and can be activated for an y 
study  or an appropriate document. Subjects with confirmed abnormal liver function testing 
should be followed as described below.
Confirmed moderatel y abnormal LFTs should be repeated 2 to 3 times weekly  then weekl y or

Version 1.2 Incorporating Non substantial Amendment 2Sponsor should be contacted and informed of all subjects for whom severe hepatic liver 
function abnormalities possibly  attributable to study  drug are observed.
To further assess abnormal hepatic laboratory  findings, the investigator is expected to:
●Obtain a more detailed h istory  of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases . Symptoms 
and new -onset diseases is to be recorded as “AEs” within the (e)CRF. Illnesses and 
conditions such as hy potensive events, and decompensated cardiac disease t ha
tmay lead 
to secondary  liver abnor malities should be noted. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is seen in 
obese h yperlipoproteinemic and/or diabetic patients, and may be associated with 
fluctuating AT levels. The investigator should ensure that the medical history  form 
captures an y illness that predates stud y enrollment that may be relevant in assessing 
hepatic function. 
●Obtain a history  of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medication, 
complementary  and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreational drug use and 
special diets. Medications, including dose, is to be entered inthe (e) CRF . Information on 
alcohol, other substance use and diet should be entered on the LA -CRF or an appropriate 
document .
●Obtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agents .
●Based on the subje ct’s history ,  other testing may  be appropriate including: 
oAcute viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E or other infectious agents), 
oUltrasound or other imaging to assess biliary  tract disease,
oOther laboratory  tests including INR, direct bilirubin.
●Consider gas troenterology  or hepatology  consultations
.
●Submit results for any  additional testing and possible etiology  on the LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document.
Subject Study Discontinuation
In the absence of an explanation for increased LFT’s, such as viral hepatitis , preexisting or 
acute liver disease, or exposure to other agents associated with liver injury, the subject may  
be discontinued from the study . The investigator may  determine that it is not in the subject’s 
best interest to continue study  enrollment. Disco ntinuation of treatment should be considered 
if:
●ALT or AST > 8 × ULN.
●ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks .
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5) (If INR testing is 
applicable/evaluated).
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%). 
In addition, if close monitoring for a subject with moderate or severe hepatic laboratory  tests 
is not possible, drug should be discontinued.

Version 1.2 Incorporating Non substantial Amendment 212.5 Retrospective Pharmacogenomics Sub-Study 
INTRODUCTION
PGx research aims to provide information regarding how naturall y occurring changes in a 
subject’s gene and/or expression based on genetic variation may  impact what treatment 
options are best suited for the subject. Through investigation of PGx by  technologies such as 
genot yping, gene sequencing, statistical genetics and Genome -Wide Association Studies , the 
relationship between gene profiles and a drug’s kinetics, efficacy  or toxicity  may  be better 
understood. As man y diseases may be influenced by 1 or more genetic variations, PGx 
research may  identify  which genes are involved in determi ning the way  a subject may  or may  
not respond to a drug.
OBJECTIVES
The PGx research that may be conducted in the future with acquired blood samples is 
exploratory . The objective of this research will be to analy zeor determine genes of relevance 
to clinic al response, pharmacokinetics and toxicity /safety  issues.
By anal yzing genetic variations, it may  be possible to predict an individual subject’s response 
to treatment in terms of efficacy  and/or toxicity .
SUBJECT PARTICIPATION
Subjects who have consented t o participate in this study  may  participate in this PGx sub-
study . As part of this sub- study , subjects must provide written consent prior to providing an y 
blood samples that may  be used at a later time for genetic analy sis.
SAMPLE COLLECTION AND STORAGE
Subjects who consent to participate in this sub -study  will provide 1 approximately 6 mL tube 
of whole blood per Astellas’ instructions. Each sample will be identified by the unique 
subject number (first code). Samples will be shipped frozen to a designated b anking CRO 
either directly  from site or via a central laboratory  as directed b y Astellas.
PGxANALYSIS
Details on the potential PGx analysis cannot be established y et. Astellas may  initiate the PGx 
analysis incase evidence suggests that genetic variants may  be influencing the drug’s 
kinetics, efficacy  and/or safety. 
DISPOSAL OF PGx SAMPLES / DATA
All PGx samples collected will be stored for a period of up to 15 years following stud y 
database hardlock. If ther e is no requirement for analysis, the whole blood sample will be 
destroy ed after the planned storage period. The subject has the right to withdraw consent at 
any time. When a subject’s withdraw notification is received, the PGx sample will be 
destroyed. Th e results of any  PGx anal ysis conducted on a sample prior to its withdrawal will 
be retained at Astellas indefinitely .

Duration of treatm ent Administration will continue until progressi ve disease (PD),
unacceptable toxicity , other withdrawal criteria, or a maximum 
treatment duration of 34cycles, whichever occurs first.
Statistical m ethods Descriptive statistics will be used for all anal yses. 
Dose escalation will be guided by  a Bay esian logistic regression 
model (BLRM) with overdose control that will be fitted to binary  
toxicity  outcomes using a hierarchical modelling approach to jointly  
model escalation arms A and B. The estimates of the model 
parameters will be updated as data are accumulating using the 
BLRM. At the end of the dose escalation the toxicity  probability  at 
each dose level in each arm will be calculated to determine an 
estimat e of the MTD in each arm.

MCS -40-106- RD-03(16.0)/Saved on:31Aug 20181.All cycles are 3 w eeks in duration. Patients will continue treatment with the study drugs until progressive disease (PD) by RECIST, w ithdrawal of patient 
consent, an unacceptable toxicity occurs, or the maximum number of cycles of treatment are reached, w hichever occurs first. The maximum duration of treatment 
with BI 1387446 (Arms A and B) is 18 cycles, unless the patient has a partial response according to itRECIST , in which case treatment may continue for cycles 19 -
34 after consultation with the sponsor. BI 1387446 has to be paused if there is no lesion suitable for injection any more, but ma y be re- started in the absence of PD if 
any lesion becomes suitable for injection again . The maximum duration of treatment with eza benlimab (BI 754091) (Arm B only) is 34 cycles. Patients will be 
allow ed to stay on treatment in the case of initial radiological PD (iUPD by itRECIST ), if the Investigator judges that it is in the patient’s best interest and the patient 
has signed an informed consent describing this circumstance. Day 1 of Cycle 1 is defined as the day when BI 1387446 is first administered. 
2.Applicable only to patients who did n ot experience PD on treatment. After the 90dFU, p atients will have follow -up visits (in person or by telephone) for tumour
progression and to monitor safety by collecting AEs/SAEs/AESIs every 3 months until PD, introduction of new anti -cancer treatment, death, loss to follow -up, 
withdrawal of consent or for a maximum of 6 months after EoT.
3.EoT visit: When a decision is taken to discontinue all treatment drugs, the EoT visit should be done instead of the scheduled visit. 30dFU visit: To be performed in 
person 30 days aft er the EoT visit .At this visit, all AEs/SAEs/AESIs and other required information must be collected as specified in the Flow Chart . 90dFU visit:
To be performed by tel ephone (or in person if the investigator deems necessary) 90 days after the EoT visit . Only AEs/SAEs/AESIs and concomitant therapy need to 
be collected at the 90dFU visit.
4.At Cycle 2 Day 1, an overnight stay is recommended if logistically possible due to sa mpling planned at the visit. 
5.Theinformed consent for trial participation should be signed prior to any trial procedure. Re -consenting may become necessary when new relevant information 
becomes available and should be conducted according to the sponsor’s instructions. A separate informed consent should be signed for biobanking if agreed by the 
patient. Per Section 4.1.2.3 , a patient will be allowed to stay on treatment in the case of initial radiological PD (corresponding to iU PD by itRECIST /, if the 
Investigator judges that it is in the patient’s best interest and the patient has signed a separate informed consent describi ng the circumstance.
6.The screening medical history and demographics, physical examination and Eastern Coope rative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, vital signs, 
electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography (or MUGA scan), safety laboratory, and screening pregnancy test (serum) should be done ≤28 days prior to initiation of 
treatment. If these assessments are performed within 72hours of initiation of treatment, they do not need to be repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1 w ith the exception of the 
ECOG performance status, an abbreviated physical examination, and vital signs (pre -and post -infusion) prior to first trial dose. 
7.Measurements of vital signs should precede blood sampling. 
8.Safety laboratory assessments including haematology, serum biochemistry, and urinalysis will be performed locally. The parame ters to be assessed at each visit is 
listed in Section 5.2.3 .
9.Focused/ limited parameters will be measured , refer to Section 5.2.3 .
10.Triplicate 12 -lead electrocardiograms (ECGs )will be obtained only at th etimepoints outlined in Blood S ample F low Chartfor Arm A and Flow Chart for Arm B . At 
all other tim epoints indicated in the Flow Chart and whenever the Investigator deem s it necessary, single ECGs will be done prior to drug administration. ECG at 
screening must be done before blood w ork or other procedures after at least 5 minutes in resting position . ECG recording will be sent to a vendor for central 
evaluation.
11.A single ECG will be obtained as clinically indicated prior to drug administration , at least every two to three cycles (i.e. on Day 1 in C ycle 7, 9, 11, 13, 16, 19, 23,

27.Consecutive biopsies should be taken always from the same lesion if clinically feasible .
28.Biopsies are taken from the projected injected and one distinct non -injected lesion if not indicated differently in the Flow Chart . Mandatory timepoints are baseline 
and C2D1. At optional timepoints only, patients with lesions suitable for diagnostic biopsy associated w ith limited procedural risks sh ould be included (refer to 
Section 5.4 for details ). 
29. Sam pling for ADA only in Cy cles 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 34.
30.Abbreviated physical examination (focused on the specific disease, at the Investigator ’s discretion).
31.After Cycle 5, every other cycle (i.e.Cycle 7, 9, 11…33).
32.Safety laboratory does not need to be repeated if the result is available within 24h prior to the drug administration.
33.No need to perform tumourassessment if ithas been done within the 3 weeks p rior to EoT .
34.Echocardiography will be obtained prior to administration of trial drugs (if drug administration is applicable) on Day 1 in Cycle 4, C7, C11, C 15, and at EOT (a time 
window  of -7 days is acceptable). For Cycle 2 Day 1, echocardiography may be perfo rmed within 72 hours prior to drug administration. 
35.If the patient stops trial treatment prior to completion of maximum number of cycles for a reason other than PD, the tumour a ssessment according to RECIST w ill be 
performed according to standard of c are until the last follow -up needed according to protocol.
36.A slit -lamp examination will be performed by an ophthalmologist at 
screening, at the30-day safety follow -up,and at any time during the treatment period, if 
clinically indicated . Opacities as seen on clinical slit -lamp examination will be graded according to LOCS III.
37.Although echocardiography is the preferred method, MUGA scans are permitted to quantify LVEF. The same method should be used in a single patient throughout 
the trial.

MCS -40-106- RD-03(16.0)/Saved on:31Aug 20181. INTRODUCTION
1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Despite the recent advancements in cancer treatment, cancer remains a leading cause of death 
globall y. In the United States (US), approximately 1,762,450 new cancer cases were expected 
to be diagnosed in 2019. The American Cancer Society  estimated that the re would be 
approximately  606,880 deaths due to cancer in the US during 2019 [R19-0312 ]. In particular 
if the disease is diagnosed in late, advanced stages, or after disease progression on available 
treatments, the prognosis of patients is poor and the vast majority  succumb to their disease. 
Therefore, there is a substantial need for novel therapeutic agents and treatment strategies to 
improve the treatment outcome for cancer patients. 
The STING pathway  has been identified as a key innate immune sensing pathway  to detect 
the presence of cy tosolic cy clic dinucleotides derived from microbial invasion and self -DNA 
leakage. Mice deficient in the STI NG pathway  show blunted ty pe I IFN production, reduced 
anti-tumour T cell priming, an d fail rejection of immunogenic tumour s [R19-
0315].
STING is a nintracellular pattern recognition receptor expressed in various endothelial and 
epithelial cell ty pes, as well as in hematopoietic cells such as T cells, macrophag es and 
dendritic cells, including plasmacy toid dendritic cells. I t stimulates the transcription of 
numerous genes involved in immune response, such as the ty pe I interferons [ R19-0314] and 
other proinflammatory  cytokines, and th rough cross- priming by antigen presenting cells may 
lead to an adaptive antitumour immune response against tumour antigens, a concept which 
has previousl y been described as 'in- situ vaccination' [ R19-0317 ].
The STING pathway  plays a key  role in spontaneous or treatment induced cancer immune 
response, and activation of this pathway  is considered to induce or augment an anti- tumour
immune response [ R19-0506, R19 - 0674 ].Intratumour al administration of STI NG agonists 
has resulted in remarkable therapeutic activit y in animal models [ R19-0316 ].
Activity  of STING agonists was also observed in patients when used as single agent, and 
more pronounced when used in combination with a PD1- antibody  [R19-0608, R19- 0623 ].
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
1.2.1 BI 1387446
Mode of action
STING is a pattern recognition receptor that detects cy tosolic nucleic acids and t ransmits 
signals that activate ty pe I interferon (IFN) responses. I tis localized in the endoplasmic 
reticulum. Double stranded DNA derived from either d ying tumour cells or pathogens binds 
and activates the enzy me cy clic GMP -AMP Sy nthase (cGAS) which then generates cy clic di -
nucleotides (CDNs) which bind to and activate STING. The naturall y occurring CDN 
cGAMP and the s ynthetic CDN BI 1387446 induce a conformational change in STING 
homo -dimers that allows the binding and activation of the interaction partner tank binding

monkey s. A marked increase in plasma levels of cy tokines was observed when tocilizumab 
was administered 24 hours prior to BI 1387446 compared to B I 1387446 monotherap y, while 
no relevant effect was observed when animals were treated with tocilizumab 6h post BI 
1387446.  For details, refer to the Investigator ’s Brochure.
Data from c linical studies
This is the first trial in human and therefore no clinical data is available.
For a more detailed description of the BI1387446 profile ,refer to the current Investigator ’s 
Brochure (IB)[c26065921].
1.2.2 Ezabenlimab (BI 754091)
Mode of action
Ezabenlimab (BI 754091) is a humanised IgG4Pro isoty pe anti PD 1 mAb being developed as 
an i.v. infusion for the treatment of cancer. Ezabenlimab (BI 754091) has highl y human 
frameworks and a low predicted immunogenicity  score. The ezabenlimab (BI 754091)
molecule has a molecula r weight of approximately 148 kilodaltons. 
Ezabenlimab (BI 754091) shows strong anti -tumour effects in several mouse tumour models. 
Single and repeat dosing studies showed that e zabenlimab (BI 754091) was well tolerated (as 
judged b y bod y weight changes and clinical signs) and resulted in significant tumour growth 
inhibition ( ≥83%).
REP of e zabenlimab (BI 754091) is 30days. 
Data from clinical studies
Ezabenlimab (BI 754091) is currentl y being tested in patients in several BI-sponsored clinical 
trials, e.g.1381-0001, 1381 - 000 2. The dose of 240 mg ezabenlimab (BI 754091) once every  
3 weeks was taken forward into the expansion portion of the Trial 1381- 0001 trial and is 
considered the recommended phase 
II dose for e zabenlimab (BI 754091) .
A total of 139 patients have been dosed with ezabenlimab (BI 754091) in clinical trials, 56 
patients with monotherapy  ezabenlimab (BI 754091) , and 83 patients with ezabenlimab (BI 
754091) plus BI 754111. At the data cut -off, there were no DLTs or Grade 5 AEs 
experienced b y any patient on monotherapy  treatment. The overall most common AEs for 
patients treated with monotherap y ezabenlimab (BI 754091) were fatigue, nausea, and 
decreased appet ite. Thirteen of the 56 patients on monotherapy  ezabenlimab (BI 754091)
experienced 
immune related adverse events ( irAEs )of rash, maculo -papular rash, colitis, 
diarrhoea, h ypothyroidism, increased ALT, increased AST, arthralgia, pneumonitis, and 
pruritus. There were one ≥ Grade 3 irAE (Grade 3 increased AST) experienced b y patients in 
the monotherapy population.
For a more detailed description of the e zabenlimab (BI 754091) profile, refer to the current 
IB[c07895879].

MCS -40-106- RD-03(16.0)/Saved on:31Aug 2018In order to be able to address future scientific questions, patients will be asked to voluntarily  
donate biospecimens for banking (refer to Section 5.5). If the patient agrees, banked samples 
may be used for future biomarker research and drug development projects, e.g.to identify  
patients that are more likely  to benefit from a treatment or experience an adverse event (AE) , 
or to gain a mechanistic or genetic understanding of drug effects and thereby  better match 
patients with therapies .Banking will be limited to samples left over after primary  anal ysis.

BENEFIT - RISK ASSES SMENT
1.4.1 Benefits
Most patients with metastatic or recurrent malignancies will succumb to their disease. Thus, 
there is a substantial need for novel therapeutic strategies to improve the outcome for patients 
with advanced or metastatic malignancies.
BI 1387446 in preclinical studies 
has led to shrinkage and complete disappearance of injected 
tumour s in mice, durable antitumour memory , and growth inhibitory  effects on non -injected 
tumour s.Intratumour al activation of the STING pathway  is considered to induce a de novo
anti-tumour immune response, leading to improved priming and activation of tumour -specific 
cytotoxic CD8+T cells and incr eased CD8+ T cell infiltration into the tumour. Thus, STING 
agonists may  be effective to treat tumour s which are primaril y non -responsive to checkpoint 
inhibitors as well as tumour s with acquired resistance to checkpoint inhibitors.
Combination with an ant i-PD1 antibody  is considered indicated in relation to the mode of 
action, i.e. to counteract IFN- mediated PD -L1 expression and maintain CD8+T -cell 
activation .
1.4.2 Risks
BI1387446 is a CDN targeting the STING receptor, which has not been tested in humans 
before. The risks of treatment have been evaluated based on the expected effects of 
 intra tumour al STI NG pathway  activation, the nonclinical in vivo and toxicology  
data, and available clinical data on other compounds targeting the STING pathway .
Based on the mode of action and available non- clinical data for BI 1387446 ,and considering 
the route of administration, the main potential risks associated with this drug are presumed to 
be:
• cytokine release s yndrome
• procedural risks from in tratumour al application
• immune -related adverse events
• decrease in cardiac contractility
Based on non- clinical data, a potential risk is supposed to be: 
eye lens toxicity  
Published clinical data indicate that STING agonists are well tolerated when injected 
intratumour ally into superficial lesions. MK -1454 demonstrated a manageable toxicity  profile 
in patients with advanced malignant tumour s as monotherapy  and combination with

≥10% of patients we re injection site pain, headache and py rexia [R19-0608 ].
General safet y measures for this FIH trial include :
• sequential enrolment of patients into a single cohort ( Section 3.1.1)
• sequential start of cohorts a t the same dose of BI 1387446 ( Section 3.1.1 )
• sequential start of backfill enroll ment ( Section 3.1.1 )
• mandatory  surveillance of patients ( Sections 4.1.4.5 and 4.1.4.6)
The trial will be monitored by  a Safet y Moni toring Committee ( SMC ). The SMC will be 
chaired b y an Investigator with experience in earl y clinical trials, and will be composed of 
Investigator s/delegates from partic ipating investigational sites and the sponsor. For details 
refer to the SMC charter and S ection 8.7 .
Cytokine release s yndrome
Following intra tumour al injection of BI 1387446 in animal models, a ty pe I interferon 
response was elicited in the injected tumour and a transient increase in cy tokines was 
detectable in plasma, with peak values around  post injection. The half life in plasma 
 In ongoing clinical trials with other STI NG agonists, fever was detected as a 
cytokine mediated s ymptom and may  be classified as c ytokine release s yndrome (CRS )grade 
1, but no CRS of higher grade with h ypotension or hypoxia was reported. R isk mitigat ion 
measures include recommendations for prevention, earl y detection and treatment of CRS, e.g.
• guidance to avoid injection into lesions with high risk for accidental intravascular 
administration, e.g.lesions encas ingor infiltrati ngmajor blood vessels ,or 
subcapsular liver lesions (Section 4.1.4.2)
• mandatory  patient surveillance ( Section 4.1.4.5)
• recommendations for management of CRS ( Section 4.1.4.6)
• assessment of adverse events, PK and blood cy tokine data in regular intervals by  
the SMC
Immune -related adverse events
Immune -related AEs as defined in Appendix 10.1 will be captured as AESI and reviewed b y 
the SMC in regular intervals throughout the trial. Recommendations for management are 
included in Appendix 10.1 .2.
Procedural risks associated with intra tumour al application and tumour biopsy
Injection of a drug using a needle is alway s associated with procedural risks. These include 
and are not limited to :
• infection
• bleeding
• injury  to tissues in the needle track, e.g.nerves, vessels, organs
• reactions to local anesthesia if used, e.g.allergy , arrhy thmia
• other events (e.g. possible ulcerations (scarring 
after biopsy ) or compression due 
to swelling)

MCS -40-106- RD-03(16.0)/Saved on:31Aug 2018Risk mitigation measures to address procedural risks are:
• selection of investigational sites with interventional radiology  expertise and/or 
Investigator s experienced in diagnostic biopsies andinjection of dru gsinto tumour
lesions
• risk adapted patient surveillance after intra tumour al injection for earl y recognition 
of complications (Section 4.1.4.5 )
• exclusion of patients in whom the designated lesion for injection has a high risk 
for local compli cations, e.g. bleeding related to encasement/infiltration of major 
blood vessels or contact with liver capsule, compression of vital structures in case 
of swelling of injected lesion ( Section 4.1.4.2)
Decrease in cardiac contractility
In a telemetry  study  in Cy nomolgus monkey s, a decline in contractility  measured as LV 
dp/dtmax was observed at doses from The decline in contractility  was not 
associated with a decline in blood pressure or an in crease in heart rate. 
Risk mitigation measures include
• exclusion of patients with cardiac insufficiency  NYHA grade III or IV or a left 
ventricular ejection fraction of < 50 % from the trial ( Section 3.3.3 ).
• detailed instructions for monitoring of vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure , 
Sections 4.1.4.5 and 4.1.4.6).
• assessment of cardiac biomarkers (e.g. troponin, natriuretic peptide , Section 5.2.3) 
• assessment of cardiac function by  left ventricular ejection fraction ( Section 5.2.4 )
Eye lens toxicity
In a repeated dose toxicity  study  in C57Bl/6 mice , increased i ncidences of diffuse 
subcapsular opacities in the anterior lens region were observed in males at  
cycle and in females at  cycle at the end of treatment. Due to the 
absence of an y histopathological findings in the lenses of all treated animal s
, the fact that 
spontane ous ocular pathologies are well known for C57Bl/6 mice ( R19-0517 ), and taking 
into account that cy tokines may be secondaril y elevated in various inflammatory  ocular 
diseases , but have not been reported to induce direct lenticula r changes, these lens opacities 
arenot considered to be unequivocall y test item -related.
Risk mitigation measures include
Exclusion of patients with absolute contraindications for cataract surgery
Assessment of lens opacity  using slit -lamp by  an ophthalmologist at screening, at 
the 30 -
day safet y follow -up,and at any  time during the treatment period, if clinically  indicated
(refer to 
Section 5.2.6).
BI 1387446 in combinat ion with ezabenlimab (BI 754091)
Combination of ezabenlimab (BI 754091) and BI 1387446 may  lead to an increased rate and 
severit y of irAEs compared to either drug alone, as is documented for combination of 
checkpoint inhibitors. 
Preclinical data suggest that e zabenlimab (BI 754091) does not potentiate BI 1387446

A number of safet y measures to mitigate possible risks are implemented in this trial. Patients 
with advanced and/or metastatic malignancies may possibly  benefit from treatment with 
BI1387446, and possibly even more from the combination of BI 1387446 and e zabenlimab 
(BI 754091) . Possible benefit of trial treatments is expected to outweigh the risk sin patients

MCS -40-106- RD-03(16.0)/Saved on:31Aug 2018Arm A will determine the MTD for BI 1387446 intra tumour ally into superficial lesions as 
single agent. Patients with progressive disease may cross over to Arm B after completion of 
cycle 1, provided that Arm B is open for recruitment. 
Arm B will determine the MTD for BI 1387446 intra tumour ally into superficial lesions in 
combination with ezabenlimab (BI 754091) . 
Arms A andB will investigate the safet y, PK, and pharmacod ynamics of BI 1387446 
monotherap y (ArmA) or BI 1387446 in combination with e zabenlimab (BI 754091) (Arm 
B).
Arms AandB will start in a staggered manner ( refer to Section 3.1.1).
To acquire additional data to more full y inform dose selection, additional patients may be 
enrolled to backfill cohorts at dose levels that have been previousl y cleared (refer to Section 
3.1.1 ).
Dose escalation will be guided by Bayesian logistic regression modelling with overdose 
control : In Arm A and B , dose escalation will be guided by a BLRM using a hierarchical 
modelling approach to jointly  model both arms. The data obtained from both arms will 
determine the MTD estimate per arm based on a BL RM employ ing an escalation with 
overdose control (EWOC) principle [R13-4803].   
The BLRM estimates the MTD by  updating estimates of the probability  of observing a DLT 
in the MTD evaluation period (first treatment cy cleincluding echocardiographic/MUGA scan 
measurements acquired on Day  1 of C ycle 2 and related findings ) for each dose level in the 
trial as patient information becomes available. At any  time in the trial, it will not be permitted 
to escalate to a dose which does not fulfil the EWOC criterion (refer to Section 7).
The trial will be monitored by  a SMC which will convene for each dose escalation decision. 
The SMC will assess for each dose cohort if dose escalation to the next dose level is possible 
based on DLTs in the MTD evaluation period , AEs, and safet y laboratory  data. DLTs and 
AEs reported in later cy cles of patients enrolled in previous dose cohorts will be considered 
in addition. After the patients in a dose cohort have either experienced a DLT or have been 
observed for at least the MTD evaluation period without experiencing a DLT, the BLRM will 
be updated with the newly accumulated data. In particular, during dose escalation, the BLRM 
will be evaluated after the occurrence of each DLT before enrolling any further patients.
The S MC may  recommend stopping the dose escalation after the criterion for MTD ( refer to 
Section 7) is fulfilled. The RP2D will not exceed the MTD and will not exceed the highest 
dose investigated during dose escalation.

declared to be safe by  the SMC at this time. These patients will continue treatment in 
combination by  re-starting treatment at C ycle 1 Day 1 in Arm B. These patients will be 
analysed in Arm A as long as treated with monotherap y. Instead of completing the REP after 
monotherap y, patients may cross over to Arm B without repetition of all 
screening 
procedures , but will have to undergo a limited set of assess ments as specified in Section

Arm A and first dose of e zabenlimab (BI 754091) or BI 1387446 in Arm B. Cross- over 
patients will be included together with other ‘backfill patients’ (patients enrolled to backfill 
cohorts at dose levels that do not exceed the MTD, see Section 3.1.2 for details) in the safet y 
and efficacy  assessment in Arm B , but will not be considered for the main analy sis of the

3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING T HE CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP(S)
Ezabenlimab (BI 754091) is expected to be required for efficacy  due to the upregulation of 
PD-L1 following STING activation. This expectation is supported by  internal and published 
preclinical data as well as clinical data on MK- 1454 as monotherapy  and in combination with 
pembrolizumab. Preclinical data for ADU -S100 indicate that the dose response relationship 
may be non -linear, possibly  resulting in a decline in efficacy  on non-injected lesions at higher 
doses. Thus, earl y combination with ezabenlimab (BI 754091) during dose finding is 
considered important for selection of a recommended dose for further development of BI 
1387446.
In addition, a flexible enlargement of cohorts which have been confirmed to be safe b y the 
SMC, the so called ‘backfill’ concept will be used to generate sufficient data at lower dose 
level s which appear relevant for dose selection and may  only be identifi ed during trial 
conduct .
BI 1387446 b y its mode of action will increase cytokines, and thus has a potential risk to lead 
to cy tokine release s yndrome. Although there has been no increase of cy tokines in preclinical

1387446 alone , the trial design will ensure that a dose of BI 1387446 can only  be tested in 
combination with ezabenlimab (BI 754091) if the same or a higher dose has been confirmed 
safe as monotherap y.
Dose escalati on and cohort size will be determined based on the recommendation of the 
SMC, guided by  a BL RM with overdose control. An escalation with overdose control design 
will increase the chance of treating patients at efficacious doses while reducing the risk of 
overdosing. This design is based on practical experience and is an efficient method due to its 
ability  to identify  the dose with a desired toxicity  rate and its allocation of a greater 
proportion of patients to doses at, or close to, that desired dose [R13-4802, R13 - 4804 , R13-
4805 ].The use of Bay esian models for Phase I studies has also been advocated b y the EMA 
guideline on small populations [R07-4856] and by the FDA [R13- 4881].
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
A total of approximately  78patients may  be treated in this trial, which will be conducted at 
about 6 sites in Europe, the United Kingdom, and the U nited Sta tes. Each site is expected to

A log of all patient s enrolled into the 
trial(i.e.who have signed informed consent) will be 
maintained in the Investigator Site File ( ISF)irrespective of whether they  have been treated 
with investigational drug or not.
If a patient is determined eligible in error (does not meet all inclusion criteria or meets one or 
more exclusion criteria on the day  of enrolment), the sponsor should be co ntacted 
immediately .

combination with BI 754091 ( Arms B and C)as described in Table 4.1.2.3: 1 for Arm A , 
Table 4.1.2.3: 2 for Arm B .
All treatments will be administered in cy cles of duration. 
Patients will continue treatment with the study  drugs until progressive disease (PD) by  
RECI ST, withdrawal of patient consent, an unacceptable toxicity  occurs, or the maximum 
number of cy cles of treatment are reached, whichever occurs first.
PD assessment will be based on itRECI ST and refers to the overall response assessment 
including all injected and non -injected lesions. Overall PD assessment a fter initial 
progr ession iscomparable to iUPD with iRECI ST(the possibility  of iTPD will not be 
considered in this study ).
Treatment bey ond initial radiological progression can only be administered if there is 
objective evidence of clinical benefit, 
absence of s ymptoms and signs (including laboratory  values, such as new or 
worsening h ypercalcemia) indicating unequivocal progression of disease, 
absence of decline in ECOG performance status that can be attributed to disease 
progression, 
absence of tum our progression at critical anatomical sites (e.g., leptomeningeal 
disease) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention, and 
absence of significant, unacceptable or irreversible toxicities related to study  
treatment .
The maximum duration of treatme nt with BI 1387446 is 18 cy cles, unless the patient has a 
partial response, in which case treatment may  continue for cy cles 19 -34 after consultation 
with the sponsor. BI 1387446 has to be paused if there is no lesion suitable for injection an y 
more, but ma y be re -started in the absence of PD if any  lesion becomes suitable for injection 
again.
The maximum duration of treatment with ezabenlimab (BI 754091) (arm B only ) is 34 
cycles.
Patients will be allowed to stay  on treatment in the case of initial radiological PD, if the 
Investigator judges that it is in the patient’s best interest and the patient has signed an 
informed consent describing this circumstance.

a superficial lesion has to be ≥1 cm.
Repeat administration
Upon repeat administration, BI 1387446 should be administered preferabl y into the same 
lesion, as long as the lesion is suitable for injection (independent of size) . In case other 
lesions than the primarily projected or selected lesion appear more suitable for injection than 
the previously  selected lesion, BI 1387446 may  be injected into a different lesion , as long as 
the new lesion is in line with the criter ia as outlined above for screening/initial 
administration. 
If no lesion is suitable for injection, BI 1387446 may be paused and restarted as considered 
indicated if a lesion suitable for injection becomes available in the absence of progression. As 
long as patients continue rece iving ezabenlimab (BI 754091) , BI 1387446 may  be re -started 
independent of the duration of the interruption. In case both trial drugs need to be paused, the 
treatment may  only be resumed if the treatment interruption is ≤12 weeks. 
Initial and repeat administration
If more than one lesion qualify  for injection, t he lesion which is safest to inject should be 
selected first. In case two or more lesions are considered equally  safe by  the Investigator , the 
largest lesion should be selected for injection first. Lesions considered high risk for local 
complications should not be selected for injection ( Section 4.1.4.2).
A single dose should preferabl y be injected into one lesion. The injection volume ( Section 
4.1.2.1.2 ) should be distributed across the tumour volume as much as possible by  moving th e 
needle within the tumour . In case the smallest possible volume as per Table 4.1.2.1.2 : 1
cannot be injected into a single les ion and a second lesion qualify ing for injection in the 
respective treatment arm is available, the dose may be distributed into up to two lesions.
4.1.4.2 Restrictions for lesion selection –BI 1387446
Lesions considered high risk for local complications should not be selected for injection. This 
includes tumour s with 
encasement or suspected infiltration of major blood vessels, 
lesions located adjacent to vital structures which would be functionall y impaired b y 
swelling of injected lesion, e.g.trachea, c arotid artery

Up to 2 dose reductions of BI 1387446 are allowed if the treatment pause due to an AE is ≤12 
weeks and the re exposure is considered clinically  indicated by  the Invest igator .
Dose reductions will be only  permitted to doses previously  explored in lower dose level s. In 
case of re -occurrence or worsening of the same AE upon re -start of BI 1387446 at a lower 
dose, a second dose reduction of BI 1387446 is not permitted and BI 1387446 has to be 
permanentl y discontinued. Re-escalation to higher doses is not permitted. In case a third dose 
reduction would be required, treatment of that patient should be permanently  discontinued. 
Treatment interruptions >12 weeks are onl y permi tted for AEs not considered drug related 
and may  be agreed on a case b y case basis with the Sponsor.
Ezabenlimab (BI 754091)
Dose reductions or escalations of ezabenlimab (BI 754091) are not permitted. In case of 
adverse events, administration of e zabenlimab (BI 754091) should be delayed for up to 12 
weeks to permit recovery from adverse events. Treatment interruptions >12 weeks are onl y 
permitted for AEs not considered drug related and may  be agreed on a case by  case basis with

Infusi
on-related reactions
In the event of an infusion -
related reaction ≤ Grade 2, the infusion rate of ezabenlimab (BI 
754091) may be decreased by  50% or interrupted until resolution of the event and re- initiated 
at 50% of the initial rate until completion of t he infusion. I n patients experiencing infusion -
related reactions ≤ Grade 2, subsequent infusions may  be administered at 50% of the initial 
rate. If an infusion

MCS -40-106- RD-03(16.0)/Saved on:31Aug 20184.1.4.5 Precautions and surveillance for procedural risks from intra tumour al application
Needle insertion into a tumour lesion is associated with procedural risks known from 
diagnostic biops y, e.g.infection, bleeding, injury  to tissues in the needle track ( e.g.nerves, 
vessels, organs), adverse reactions to local anesthesia if used.
BI 1387446 may only be administered b y a ph ysician who is experienced in diagnostic 
biopsy  or intra tumour al injectio n of immunotherapy  drugs (physician, 
radiologist/interventional radiologist, or surgeon) .
In case patient develops symptoms potentially  indicating local complications, adequate 
surveillance and additional diagnostic measures need to be implemented as medi cally  
appropriate. A decline in Hgb b y ≥2.0 g/dL (≥ 20 g/L, ≥ 1.24 mmol/L )must result in 
prolongation of surveillance b y at least 4h including repetition of all assessments as per Table 
4.1.4.5: 1. I maging should be performe d as medically  indicated for diagnosis of a bleed.

In case longer surveillance is mandated on selected visits for other reasons, e.g.risk 
mitigation of cy tokine release s yndrome ( Section 4.1.4.6), the longest duration as defined per 
protocol at a given timepoint will apply .
4.1.4.6 Cytokine release s yndrome
Patients will be closely  monitored for CRS and, in case of suspected or confirmed CRS, have 
to receive appropriate and immediate treatment. All trial sites will have emergency  
resuscitation services and access to intensive care available.
Mandatory  surveillance for CRS
Patients will remain under surveillance for 24 hours after the first adm inistration of BI 
1387446 (STING agonist) on Cy cle 1 Day  1.
Patients will remain under surveillance for at least 8 hours after the second and third 
administration of BI 1387446 on Cy cle 1 
Patients will remain under sur veillance for at lea st 8 hours on Cy cle 2 Day  1.
Patient will remain under surveillance for at least 8 hours in Cy cle 5 Day  1 of Arms A

MCS -40-106- RD-03(16.0)/Saved on:31Aug 2018Patient surveillance may  be shortened on subsequent administrations as medically  
appropriate, considering the minimum duration as defined in Section 4.1.4.5 , provided 
that no cy tokine release sy ndrome was observed in the previo us administration. 
In case a patient suffered from cy tokine related s ymptoms at the previous BI 1387446 
injection, the surveillance at the subsequent administration needs to be prolonged to at 
least 8 hours.
Patients requiring steroids as premedication or requiring medication for s ymptoms of 
any kind (including any  signs/sy mptoms concerning CRS) for any  reason during the 
CRS surveillance periods will stay  for observation and continue to be monitored for 
CRS for at least 24 hours after administration of BI 1387446
Monitoring of as ymptomatic patients will include measurement of bod y temperature, heart 
rate, and blood pressure , at least every  2 hours. Parameters have to be captured in CRF. 
Those parameters will not only  be used to capture the sy mptom sof CRS, but also be 
evaluated for signs of cardiac insufficiency .If more frequent assessments are chosen due to 
clinical sy mptoms, a representative selection of these additional assessments need to be 
captured in the CRF as well. Patients will be assessed for si gns or s ymptoms of CRS ( e.g.
fever, h ypotension, tach ycardia, h ypoxia, nausea, fatigue, headache, m yalgias, and malaise).
Patients will be informed about possible signs and sy mptoms of CRS, and the need to 
immediately  contact or present to the investigati onal site if sy mptoms occur after discharge, 
or in case of urgency  to another, closer hospital.
CRS grading should be performed according to American Societ y for Blood and Marrow 
Transplantation ( ASBMT )consensus grading [R19-0309], organ toxicities in the context of 
CRS should be reported according to Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE ) v5.0. AEs of CRS Grade ≥2 are defined as AESI s. 
Treatment of CRS should be based on published recommendations a
nd gui delines [ R19-0310, 
R19-0311 ], the recommendations for treatment of CRS in Appendix 10.2 should be 
considered b y the investigator as guidance. In general, in case more than s ymptomatic 
treatment is required, corticosteroids should be administered first. IL -6 targeting drugs should 
be used onl y once appropriate doses of corticosteroids did not result in adequate 
improvement or resolution. Pre-emptive administration of anti -IL6-therap y, e.g. use of 
tocilizumab or siltuximab prior to BI 1387446 injection or immediatel y thereafter without 
presence of clinical sy mptoms of CRS, is not permitted.
In patients with clinically manifested CRS, it is recommended to measure cytokines in the
local laboratory  at onset of sy mptoms , approximately  24hours ,and 48 hours thereafter or 
upon discharge from hospitalization (whichever occurs earlier) .
A patient with CRS grade 1 or 2 may  be re -exposed to BI 1387446 and e zabenlimab (BI 
754091) at the subsequent planned administration timepoint provided that all sy mptoms have 
completely  resolved for at least 48 hours.

In Arm A, l ive attenuated vaccines are prohibited during the trial through 30 day s after the 
last dose of BI 1387446. In Arm B, the use of live attenuated viruses has to be delay ed until 
70 day s after the last dose of 
ezabenlimab (BI 754091) or 30 day s after the last dose of BI 
1387446, wh ich ever comes later.
The decision on COVID -19 vaccination of a BI study  patient must be taken based on an 
individual Benefit -Risk Assessment by  the investigator after thorough discussion with the 
patient. This assessment should consider the approved labels of the respective vaccine as well 
as the provisions given in the Clinical Trial Protoco l. Furthermore, there should be a time 
window of at least 3 day s between administration of the vaccine and study  medication. 
COVID -19 vaccination or BI 1387446 may  be postponed considering the patients individual 
risk. COVID -19 vaccination should be considered as concomitant medication and reported as 
such in the CRF.
Considering the mechanism of action of activation of the STING pathway and PD-1 receptor 
blockade, attenuation of vaccine -induced protective immunity  by BI 1387446 and/or BI 
754091, respectiv ely , is not assumed. 
The package insert for approved COVID -19 vaccinations should be carefully  reviewed for 
local guidance considering acute moderate/severe febrile illness, and the risk of an 
anaph ylactic reaction to the vaccine. A diminished response to the vaccine needs to be 
considered for immunocompromised conditions which may  be observed in patients with 
advanced or metastatic solid tumour after prior anti -cancer therapies.
It is important to encourage a patient to continue taking precautions such a s wearing a mask, 
maintaining social distancing and washing hands frequentl y, even after a patient receives a 
COVID -19 vaccine. These precautions will be necessary  until public health experts advise 
otherwise.
Herbal medications
Herbal preparations/medica tions are not allowed throughout the trial unless agreed to b y the

4.2.2.2 Restrictions on diet and life sty le
The usual restrictions on diet and lif e style that were already  applicable for a given patient 
before entry  into the trial, according to his/her medical condition, have to be continued.
4.2.2.3 Contraception requirements
Due to the advanced stage of disease of Phase I trial patient population s and the high medical 
need, females of childbearing potential can be included in this trial provided that they  agree 
to use a highl y-effective contraception method. 
Females not of childbearing potential must have evidence of such b y fulfilling one of th e 
following criteria at screening:
 Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilization by  hysterectom y, bilateral 
oophorectom y, or bilateral salpingectomy
 Post-menopausal: defined as more than 50 years-of-age and amenorrhoeic for at 
least 12 months follow ing cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments
 Women under 50 y ears-of-age would be considered postmenopausal if they have 
been amenorrhoeic for at least 12 months following the cessation of exogenous 
hormonal treatments, and have serum follicle- stimulating hormone and luteinizing 
hormone levels in the postmenopausal range for the institution.
WOCBP (trial participant or partner of a trial participant) must use a highly effective method 
of birth control per ICH M3 (R2) that results in a low failure rat e of less than 1% per year 
when used consistentl y and correctly if their sexual partner is a man able to father a child.
These methods include:
 Total sexual abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifesty le 
of the study  participant (periodic abstinence such as calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, post-ovulation methods and withdrawal are not acceptable 
methods of contraception) , or
 Bilateral tubal ligation, or
 vasectomised partner (with appropriate post -vasectomy  documentation of the 
absence of sperm in the ejaculate and provided that partner is the sole sexual 
partner of the female clinical trial participant), or
 Intrauterine 
device or intrauterine hormone -releasing s ystem.
Women of childbearing potential must follow these methods during the trial and for at least 6 
months after the end of the trial treatment .

control , women of childbearing potential using a contraceptive pill must use an additi onal 
barrier method .
Men (trial participant or partner of a trial participant) must agree to use a condom, unless
vasectomised with documented absence of sperm , and ensure that their female partner of 
childbearing potential is using an additional highly -effective method of birth control, during 
the trial and until at least 6 months after the end of the trial treatment .
Details of contraception m ethods may  be adapted according to local requirements and are

4.3 T REATMENT COMPLIANCE
BI 1387446 and ezabenlimab (BI 754091) will be administered at the sites by  the Investigator
and/or trained site personnel, and dosing will be recorded in the eCRF. Therefore, actual 
dosing is expected to precisely  follow the prescribed drug regimen. Missed or interrupted 
doses will be recorded in the eCRF with the associated reasons. The method of collecting 
dosing information assures that total exposure can be calculated programmatically  taking into 
account an y missing doses.
5. ASSESSMENT S
5.1 A SSESSMENT OF EFFICAC Y
The tumour response will be evaluated according to Response Criteria for Intra tumour al 
Immunotherap y in Solid Tumour s (itRECI ST) (R20-2734). itRECI ST criteria have been 
introduced recentl y and are tailored for solid tumour s and intra tumour al therap y trials. 
itRECI ST criteria incorporate features of RECI ST1.1 (R09- 0262) and iRECI ST(R17- 0923)
with the intent to capture both sy stemic and local effects of intra tumour al therap y. Thus, 
injected lesions remain evaluable for overall response assessment as long as these are integral 
to the intra tumour al treatment regimen. As with RECI ST1.1, the classification algorithm 
follows the quantitative and qualitative assessment of tumour burden and defines the maximal 
number of target lesion (TL ) tumour s using the 
same measuring criteria as with RECI ST 1.1. 
Importantly , the new criteria further categorize the target and nontarget tumour categories 
into injected and noninjected tumour s (i.e., target injected (T
-I), target noninjected (T -NI), 
nontarget injected (NT -I), and nontarget noninjected (NT- NI)). For details please refer to 
Section 10.3 and the recently  published paper by  Goldmacher et al (R20-2734 ).
The assessment b y the Investigator and/or the local radiologist will be the basis for 
continuation or discontinuation of the trial in an individual patient (in addition to safet y). The 
baseline imaging must have been performed within 4 weeks prior to treatment with the trial 
medication and the Investigator will record the target and non -target lesions in the eCRF.
Target lesions will be classified as target injected (T- I) or target non- injected (T -NI).The

5.2.1 Physical examination
Physical examinations will be performed at screening, prior to trial medication administration 
on Day  1 of each cy cle, at the EOT visit, and at the 30 -day safet y follow- up visit. However, 
patients will have an additional abbreviated ph ysical examination (focused on the specific
disease, at the Investigator ’s discretion) as indicated in the Flow C hart.
The phy sical examination will include measurement of height (screening only ) and of body  
weight, and the evaluation of the ECOG performance score. Weight will be measured during 
screening and at each full phy sical examination (not during abbreviated phy sical 
examinations).
The ECOG score will be assessed at screening, on Day  1 of C ycles 1 , 2and 3, on Day  1 of 
every  other cy cle beginning with C ycle 5 prior to trial medication intak e, at the EOT visit, 
and at the 30-day safet y follow -up visit.

are provided in the Laboratory  Manual in the ISF. 
Clinically  relevant abnormal findings as judged by  the Investigator will be reported as 
adverse events (refer to Section 5.2.7 ).
In case the criteria for hepatic injury  are fulfilled, a number of additional measures will be 
performed ( refer to Section 5.2.7.1.4 and the DILI Checklist provided in the eDC s ystem). 
The amount of blood taken from the patient concerned will be increased due to this additional
sampling.
5.2.4 Electrocardiogram
Standard 12-lead (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1 - V6) resting electrocardiograms (ECGs) will 
be digitall y recorded at various time points throughout the trial. The Flow C hartoutline s
which visits will require ECGs, and Blood sampling Flow C hartoutlines which time points 
require triplicate ECGs to be done along with certain PK samples (Arm Aand B
).
All ECGs will be obtained after the patient has been resting supine for at least 5 minutes prior 
to the indicated times. All ECGs should be recorded with the patient in the same physical 
position.
Electrocardiogram machines will be provided for the tri al to facilitate central readings. 
Before stud y start, the study sites will be trained for the proper use of the equipment and 
transfer of the electronic data to the vendor. All ECGs will be transmitted to the central 
vendor for anal ysis. 
ECGs may  be rep eated for quality  reasons and the repeated recording will be used for 
analysis. If necessary , additional ECGs may  be recorded for safety  reasons. 
The ECG recordings must also be anal ysed and checked for abnormality  by the Investigator 
(or designated ph ysician) who will also calculate the QTcF value for each time point as the 
mean of the 3 ECGs.  Particular attention must be paid to T wave inversions. I t is not 
mandatory  to wait for central evaluation of ECGs to make clinical decisions. Clinically  
relevant abnormal findings will be reported either as baseline condition (if identified at the 
screening visit) or otherwise as adverse events and will be followed up and/or treated as 
medically  appropriate. CTCAE Version 5 will be used for the grading of prolonge d QTcF 
intervals.
In case of related ECG changes and whenever the Investigator deems necessary , additional 
ECG monitoring will be performed in the respective and later courses of treatment. The 
ECGs will be recorded using dedicated equipment provided by  a vendor. The ECGs will be 
sent for evaluation by  a central vendor. Data from this central review will be taken for 
retrospective data anal ysis. To allow for a heart rate correction of QT inte rvals the QT

formula QTcF = QT/RR-1/3) and QTcB (Bazett’s formula QTcB = QT/RR-1/2).
In case of QTcF prolongation to >500 ms (mean of 3 ECGs) AFTER receiving therapy , the 
Investigator will initiate further ECG monitoring and diagnostics ( e.g.check electrol ytes and 
check concomitant therapy  that may  be contributing to QTcF prolongation) and if required 
provide adequate treatment according to medical standards. The pat ient will be discharged 
from the investigational site only  after resolution of ECG findings as assessed by  the 
Investigator.
In case of occurrence of sy mptoms suggestive of arrhy thmia related to QTcF prolongation, a 
cardiologic evaluation will be performe d, and treatment will be provided according to 
medical standards at the discretion of the Investigator.
At timepoints when ECG and blood sampling for PK areplanned at the same time, ECG 
should be performed prior to PK sampling . Triplicate ECG sshould be performed within a 
maximum period of 5 minutes prior to blood sampling.  
The centralised ECG evaluation will include the semi- automatic determination of the RR, PR 
interval, QRS complexes, and QT intervals.
All interval measurements in one patient will b e performed on the same lead. The intervals 
will be measured from four cardiac cy cles (beats) in lead II. If lead II shows a flat T wave or 
is not measurable for an y reason, lead V5 will be used, or if that lead is not measurable, then 
lead I will be used for assessment of all ECGs .
Central morphological analyses of the ECGs (cardiologic assessments) will be performed by  
a board -certified cardiologist or equivalent. In case additional (unscheduled) ECGs due to 
safet y reasons are recorded at the study site, all ECGs of this time point including the 
additional ECGs will undergo interpretation. The ECG interpretation will include an overall 
assessment (normal, abnormal, not assessable) as well as assessments concerning rh ythm, 
conduction, presence of my ocardia l infarction, ST segment deviations, T wave morphology , 
and U wave morphology  findings.
Abnormalities detected during centralised ECG evaluation will not necessarily  qualify  as 
AEs. In case of clinically relevant abnormalities ( e.g.heart blocks or large changes in interval 
duration) the ECG core laboratory  may  contact the Investigator and vice versa.
Centrally assessed ECGs will comply  with the ICH E14 guidance document and supplements 
[R05-2311 , R13-0801 , R13-4095 ]as well as the FDA requirements for annotated digital 
ECGs [ R09-4830].
5.2.5 Echocardiography / MUGA scan
Echocardiograph y to assess left ventricular (LV) function needs to be performed at screening 
and in regular intervals as indicated in the Flow C hart.In case trial drugs are administered at 
the respective visit, echocardiography  should be obtained prior to trial drug administration.

relevant abnormal findings may  be reported as baseline conditions/adverse events.
Although echocardiography is the preferred method, MUGA scans are permitted to quantify  
LVEF. The same method should be used in a single patient throughout the trial.
In case the patient develops clinical sy mptoms of cardiac insufficiency , unscheduled 
echocardiograph y should be obtained as soon as possible to quantify  LV ejection fraction and
additional parameters as clinically  indicated.
A clinically  relevant decline in L VEF ,defined as an absolute 
decrease b y at least 10
percentage points, should be confirmed b y a subsequent assessment after 1- 2 weeks. A
confirmed LVEF decline should be reported as adverse event . Upon detection of a clinicall y 
relevant decline in LVEF , BI 1387446 should be paused until L VEF returns to bas eline, and 
should only  be resumed at a reduced dose
. In case of a recurrent decline upon re -exposure at 
a reduced dose of BI 1387446, treatment should be permanently  discontinued.
In case a clinicall y relevant decline in LV EFis observed, patients should be closel y followed 
for signs of cardiac disease th roughout the trial. Results from additional imaging studies 
should be captured in the eCRF.
5.2.6 O ther safety parameters
Assessment of lens opacity
Ocular history  as part of the medical history  will be reviewed at screening. Examination of 
patients for the presence and extent of lens opacities using slit -lamp examination will be 
performed b y an ophthalmologist at screening, at the 30 -day safet y follow and at an y time 
during the treatment period, if clinically  indicated . Lens opacities as seen on clinical slit -lamp 
examination will be graded and documented according to the Lens Opacities Classification 
System III (LOCS III ) (R99-2093).
5.2.7 Assessment of adverse events
5.2.7.1 Definitions of AEs 
5.2.7.1.1 Adverse event
An AE is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessaril y have to have a 
causal re lationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  findin g), symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
The followin g should also be recorded as an AE in the CRF and BI SAE form (if applicable):
Worsening 
pre-existing conditions, excluding disease progression.

are judged clinically  relevant by  the Investigator .
If such abnormalities already  exist prior to trial inclusion ,they will be considered as baseline 
conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only.
5.2.7.1.2 Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an y AE ,which fulfils at least one of the 
following criteria :
-results in death,
-is life -threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might have 
caused death if more severe,
-requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existin g hospitalisation
- results in persistent or signif icant disability  or incapacity ,
-is a c ongenital anomal y /birth defect,
-is deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when based 
on appropriate medical judg ement which may  jeopardise the patient and may  require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
above definitions. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood d yscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospitalisation or development of dependency  or abuse. 
5.2.7.1.3 AEs considered “Alway s Serious”
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency
 initiative on Important Medical Events, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of further AEs, which by  their nature, can alway s be 
considered to be “serious” even though they  may  not have met the criteria of an SAE as 
defined above.
The latest list of “Alway s Serious AEs” can be found in the eDC sy stem. A copy  of the latest 
list of “Alway s Serious AEs” will be provided upon request. These events should alway s be 
reported as SAEs as described above.
5.2.7.1.4 Adverse events of special interest
The term adverse events of special interest (AESI) relates to an y specif ic AE that has been 
identified at the project level as being of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring 
and safet y assessment within this trial, e.g.the potential for AEs based on knowledge from 
other compounds in the same class. AESI sneed t o be reported to the sponsor ’s

Dose limiting Toxicities (DLTs)
All DL Ts are considered to be AESI s, and must be reported as such. The definition of DL T is
presented in S ection 4.1.4.4.
Hepatic injury and drug -induced liver injury  (DILI)
During the course of the trial the Investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver
biochemistry . The Investigator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets the
hepatic injury  definition or potential Hy´s law criteria at an y point during the trial.
The Investigator participate s, together with the Medical Monitor and clinical project 
representatives, in review and assessment of case s meeting potential hepatic injury  and Hy ´s 
law criteria. Hy ´s law criteria are met if there is no alternative explanation for the elevations 
in liver biochemistry  other than a DILI caused by  the investigational product.
The Investigator is responsible for recoding data pertaining to these cases and for reporting 
them as AEs and/or SAE according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with 
standard safet y reporting processes.
Hepatic injury definition :
Ahepatic injury  is defined by  the following alterations of hepatic laboratory  parameters in 
patient s with normal liver parameters at baseline (ALT, AST, and bilirubin within normal 
limits ): 
an elevation of AST and/or ALT >3 fold ULN combined with an elevation of total 
bilirubin >2 fold ULN measured in the same blood draw sample , or in samples drawn 
within 30 day s of each other , or
aminotransferase (ALT, and/or AST) elevations ≥10 fold ULN
For patients with abnormal aminotransaminase levels between >1 and <3 x ULN at baseline:
An elevation of AST and / or AL T ≥3-
fold the baseline value combined with an
elevation of bilirubin ≥2-fold ULN or ≥2 -fold the baseline value (if bilirubin is
elevate d at baseline), measured in the same blood sample, or in samples drawn within 
30 day s of each other; or;
Aminotransferase elevations ≥5-fold the baseline value.
For patients with abnormal aminotransaminase levels between ≥3 x ULN and <5 x UL N at 
baseline:
An elevation of AST and / or AL T ≥2-fold the baseline value combined with an
elevation of bilirubin ≥2-fold ULN or ≥2 -fold the baseline value (if bilirubin is
elevated at baseline); measured in the same blood sample or in samples drawn within
30 day s ifeach other; or;

MCS -40-106- RD-03(16.0)/Saved on:31Aug 2018Hy’s Law cases have the following 3 components:
The drug causes hepatocellular injury , generally  shown by  a higher incidence of 3 -fold or 
greater elevations above the ULN of ALT or AST
Among trial subjects showing such aminotransferase elevations, often with elevations 
much greater than 3 times UL N, one or more also show elevation of serum total bilirubin 
to >2 times UL N, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum ALP)
No other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased aminotransferase 
and total bilirubin, such as viral hepatitis A, B, or C; pre-existing or acute liver disease; or 
another drug capable of causing the observed injury.
These lab findings c onstitute a hepatic injury  alert and the patients showing these lab 
abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the eDC 
system .
In case of clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury  (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy , 
unexplained coagulopathy, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results 
(ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the 
Investigator should make sure these parameters are 
analysed, if necessary  in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of 
hepatic injury  alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be followed .

MCS -40-106- RD-03(16.0)/Saved on:31Aug 2018Immune related adverse events (irAE)
Immune -related AEs are AEs associated with immunotherap y treatments that appear to be 
associated with the immune therap y’s mechani sm of action. These adverse reactions, which 
can be severe, may  involve the gastrointestinal, skin, liver, endocrine, respiratory , renal, or 
other organ s ystems. All immune -relate events are to be reported as AEs. Some irAEs also 
need to be reported as AES Is as defined b y the sponsor in Table 10.1.1: 1. If an Investigator
determines a grade 3 event (not on the list) to be immune -related, the Investigator should also 
report that event as an AESI .
Recommendations for the managemen t of irAEs are presented in Appendix 10.2.
5.2.7.1.5 Intensit y (severit y) of AEs
The severit y of adverse events should be classified and recorded in the CRF according to the 
CTCAE v5.0.
5.2.7.1.6
Causal relationship of AEs
Medical judgement should be used to determine whether there is a reasonable possibility of a 
causal relationship between the adverse event and the given stud y treatment , considering all 
relevant factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -
challenge, confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and 
relevant history . 
Arguments that may  suggest that there is a reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be :
The event is consistent with the known pharmacology  of the drug .
The event is known to be caused b y or attributed to the drug class.
A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re- introduced.
No me dicall y sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event ( e.g.pre-
existing or concomitant diseases, or co -medications).
The event is t ypicall y drug -related and infrequent in the general population not 
exposed to drugs ( e.g.Stevens- Johnson sy ndrome).
An indication of dose -response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is reduced).
Arguments that may  suggest that there is no reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
No plausible time to on set of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g.pre-treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days /weeks 
of drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug 
concerned) .
Continuation of the event despite the withdrawal of the medication, taking into 
account the pharmacological properties of the compound ( e.g.after 5 half -lives).

despite removing the original trigger.
Additional arguments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanation ( e.g.
situations where other drugs or underl ying diseases appear to provide a more likely  
explanation for the observed event than the drug concer ned).
Disappearance of the event even though the trialdrug treatment continues or remains 
unchanged.
5.2.7.2 Adverse event collection and reporting
5.2.7.2.1 AE Collection
The Investigator shall maintain and keep detailed records of all AEs in the patient files.
The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate CRF(s) by  the 
Investigator :
•From signing the in formed consent onwards until the individual patient ’send of trial: 
all AEs (serious and non -serious) and all AESIs.
•After the individual patient’s end of trial: 
the Investigator does not need to activel y monitor the patient for new AEs but should only  
report any occurrence of cancer and trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment 
related AESIs of which the Investi gator may become aware of by any means of 
communication, e.g. phone call. Those AEs should be reported on the BI SAE form (see 
Section 5.2.7.2.2), but not on the CRF.
5.2.7.2.2 AE reporting to the sponsor and timelines
The Investigator must report SAEs, AESI s, and non -serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form immediately  (within 24 hours) t o the s ponsor’s 
unique entry point (country  specific reporting process will be provided in the I SF). The same 
timeline applies if follow
-up information becomes available. In specific occasions, the 
Investigator could inform the sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the 
requirement to complete and send the BI SAE form.
With receipt of an yfurther information to these events, a follow -up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow -up information the same rules and timeline apply  as for initial 
information. All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual patient ’s end of trial must 
be followed up until they have resolved, have been assessed as “chronic” or “stable” , or no 
further information can be obtained.
5.2.7.2.3 Pregnancy
In rare cases, pregnancy  might occur in a clinical trial. Once a patient has been enrolled in the 
clinical trialand has taken trial medication, the Investigator must report any  drug exposure 
during pregnancy  in a trial participant immediately  (within 24 hours) by  means of Part A of 
the Pregnancy Monitoring Form to the sponsor’s unique entry  point.

the event that consent cannot be obtained, information will be collected and reported in 
accordance with regulatory  requirements. The ISF will contain the trial specific information 
and consent for the pregnant partner.
The outcome of the pregnancy  associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy  must be 
followed up and rep orted to the sponsor’s unique entry  point on the Pregnancy  Monitoring 
Form for Clinical Trial s (Part B).
The I SF will contain the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trial s (Part A and B).

5.2.7.2.4 Exemptions to AE/SAE reporting
The occurrence of disease progression is recorded as part of the assessment of trial endpoints
for the analy sis of efficacy . The following rules will be followed for reporting disease 
progression and associated signs and s ymptoms for the anal ysis of safet y;
If the disease progression, or an y associated signs and symptoms, meet stan dard 
seriousness criteria (see Section 5.2.7 .1.2), ‘disease progression’ must be reported as 
an SAE.
If the disease p rogression and an y associated signs and symptoms do not meet 
standard seriousness criteria, ‘disease progression’ is not reported as an AE.
Clinical signs and s ymptoms of disease progression which do not meet standard 
seriousness criteria will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF. If a sign or 
symptom is on the ‘Alway s Serious AE’ list, it will also be reported as an SAE. If 
signs and s ymptoms are attributable to a diagnosis (other than ‘disease progression’), 
reporting the diagnostic term is preferable e .g. pulmonary  embolism rather than 
dyspnoea, intestinal obstruction rather than abdominal pain.
If there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the investigational 
drug(s) and the progression of the underl ying malignancy , the event must be re ported 
as an SAE.
Lab values meeting the poten tial severe DILI definition in Section 5.2.7 .1.4must 
alway s be reported as AESI , even if the most likely  cause is disease progression. No 
exemption to AE reporting applies.
Exempted events are reviewed at appropriate intervals by  the Sponsor and the SMC .

metabolite analysis. The blood samples will be processed in the same way  as the PK samples 
(seeSection 5.3.3 ). However, the plasma obtained (approximately  2 mL) will be transferred 
intopolypropy lene tubes (each containing approximately  1mL, labelled MIST1 and M IST2).
Samples will be stored at approximately  -20°C or below until transfer to the metabolism 
laboratory . At a minimum, the sample tube labels should list BI  trial number, subject number,
visit, planned sampling time and ‘MetID’.
Plasma samples dedicated to met abolism investigation are transferred to:
Only  data related to the parent compound and its metabolites will be acquired. Evaluation of
drug metabolism will be reported separatel y and will not be included in the Clinical Trial 
Report (CTR ). The study samples will be discarded after completion of the experiments but 
not later than 5 years after the CTR has been archived.
5.3.3 Methods of sample collection
Blood samples should not be obtained from the arm used for ezabenlimab (BI 754091)
infusion.  I n case a central venous access is used for infusion, the blood sample can be 
collected from either forearm or central line.  B
lood sampling for BI 1387446 should be 
perfo rmed in anatomical distance from the injection site , e.g.if the right arm is the injection 
site for the tumour , the left arm should be used for PK blood sampling. The actual sampling 
date and time (24 -hour time clock) for each sample has to be recorded accuratel y.
For quantification of analyte concentrations, blood will be drawn for BI 1387446 and 
ezabenlimab (BI 754091) at the time points specified in the PK time schedule in Blood 
sample 
Flow C harts .
Samples may  be used for further methodological investigations, however only  data related to 
this trial, the analy te or bioanaly tical assay  will be generated by  these additional 
investigations ( e.g.using the sample for ADA or biomarker for PK if sample volume allows).  
The trial samples will be discarded after completion of the additional investigations but not 
later than 5 years after the final trial report has been signed.
Details on sample colle ction for BI 1387446 and e zabenlimab (BI 754091) characteristics,

This section refers to exploratory  biomarkers. 
The study  of biomarkers will be hy pothesis -generating and will substantially  contribute to th e 
understanding of the BI 1387446 mode of action. Where possible biomarkers will be used to 
retrospectivel y identify  patient subgroups with differential prognoses and/or responses to 
treatment. The following exploratory  biomarkers may beexamined in this trial:
Immunohistochemical analy sis of immune -oncology  –related markers on tumour cells 
and I mmune cell infiltrates
Peripheral cy tokine secretion
Flow anal ysis of different immune cell subsets in blood 
Gene expression analy sis of immune -oncology -related panel of genes in blood and 
tissue .
Genomic profiling to determine tumour mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite 
status.
Germline STING variants. 
Should other tissue/blood biomarkers become relevant , these may  also be explored. The list 
of biomarkers planned to be studied during the trial may  change based on new information in 
the literature or earl y analy ses.
In the case of premature trial discontinuation due to the reasons specified under section 3.3.4
or 3.3.5 , the sponsor reserves the right to discontinue selected anal yses. Respective samples 
may be used for further investigations as described in 5.4.1, or if  a sepa rate informed consent 
hasbeen given, samples may  be used for biobanking ( section 5.5).
5.4.1 Methods of sample collection
Fresh p re-and on- treatment tumour biopsy  collections for biomarker anal yses will be 
mandatory  from all patients (according to the FlowChart). All samples must be adequatel y 
labelled b y the trial site personnel. For fresh biopsies a lway s use the equivalent of no less 
than two core needle biopsies (18gauge or greater) .
If available additional archival tumour tissue from the most recent time point before study  
entry will be collected during s creening (see Flow Chart) for all patients. Archival tumour
tissue sample should be provided as FFPE -preserved tissue, preferabl y as an embedded block 
and less preferabl y as mounted tissue sections (at least 8 up to 20 sections of 5 μmthickness) 
prepared under RNase free conditions.

performed at an y time according to clinical need.
In the event of force majeure or other disruptive circumstances (e.g. pandemic, war) the 
investigational plan as per this clinical trial protocol may  not be feasible at a site. With the 
consent of the patient, sponsor and investigator may  agree on alternative, back -up or rescue 
methodology  which may  include but will not be limited to virtual patient visits and 
assessments, and home healthcare nurse visi ts. The implementation of these measures will 
depend on patient’s consent, operational feasibility, local law and regulations. If alternative 
methodology  is implemented, the deviations from the original plan will be precisel y

DETAILS OF TRIALPROCEDURES AT SELECTED VISITS
6.2.1 Screening and run -in period(s)
Screening Period
Following informed consent, the patient will undergo screening assessments as indicated in 
the Flow Chart. The assessments must fall within the acceptable Screening visit window but 
do not need to be performed on the same day . Screening assessments may be repeated as long 
as they  fall within the Screening visit window. If more than one screening assessment is 
available, the latest assessment prior to the start of treatment must be used to assess 
eligibility .
Re-screening of patients who have previously  failed screening will be permitted. I n this 
situation patients will be allocated a new patient number.
Patients who cross over from Arm A to Arm B do not have to repeat all screening procedures , 
but a limited set of assessments should be available, i.e.
- Imaging for response assessment (unless available between last dose of BI 1387446 in 
Arm A and first dose of e zabenlimab (BI 754091) or BI 1387446 in Arm B, and not 
older than 28 day s).
-Biopsy  from injected and non -injected lesion (unless performed in Arm A and no 
subsequent treatment with trial drugs in Arm A following the biopsy ) 
-Echocardiograph y, unless performed within the last 4 weeks
These patients will start treatment in Arm B at Cycle 1 Day 1.
Baseline Conditions
Demographics (sex, year of birth, race, and ethnicity  where allowed), information on tobacco 
and alcohol use, and baseline conditions will be collected during the screening visit.
If the patient meets the eligibility  criteria during screening, the first treatment visit should be 
scheduled. Baseline conditions which are present at the Screening visit should be reported in 
the eCRF.

antibodies therap y, immune therap y, and hormone therap y will be reported, including start 
and end dates (month and y ear may  be sufficient), as well as whether therapy  was given as 
neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or palliative therap y. The date of tumour progression after previous 
lines of treatment will be recorded, if known.
Other medical history :
Past diseases and/or diagnoses relevant to patient's safety / trial assessments during the trial as 
judged b y the Investigator will be recorded in eCRF.
Molecular characteristics of the tumour : 
Microsatellite status, Tumour mutational burden (TMB), Expression levels of PD- L1,ER, 
PR, HER2, HPV status and any  available information on tumour mutations will be recorded 
in the eCRF .
Concomitant medication:
Relevant concomitant diagnoses and/or therapies present in the past, at trial entry  and/or 
during screening and relevant to t he patient’s safety during the trial as judged by the 
Investigator will be recorded in the eCRF (see Section 4.2.2 for details on concomitant 
medications). Post- trial therap y for advanced or metastatic disease will also be documented.
6.2.2 Treatment period(s)
Refer to the Flow Chart for a detailed presentation of each visit during the t reatment period.
6.2.3 Follow -upperiod and trialcompletion
The EOT visit will be performed as soon as possible but no later than 7 days after permanent 
discontinuation of the trial medications (BI 1387446 and/or e zabenlimab (BI 754091) ) for 
any reason o r e.g. when the Investigator decided with the patient to permanently  discontinue 
the trial medications or became aware that the trial medications had been terminated.
The assessments of the EOT visit will then be performed instead of at the next planned visit. 
If the patient finishes active treatment without having PD, tumour assessment/imaging must 
be performed at the time of EOT, unless it has been done within the past 3weeks.

7. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF
SAMPLE SIZE
This trial will be performed as an open -label trial. The primary  objectives of this trial are to 
determine the MTD and/or the RD -P2 of BI 1387446 as monotherap y in superficial lesions
(Arm A) andto determine the MTD and/or the RD -P2 of BI 1387446 in combina tion with 
ezabenlimab (BI 754091) in superficial lesions (Arm B) . To determine the MTDs, patients 
are entered sequentiall y into escalating dose cohorts (see Section 3). 
Thedose escalation will be guided b y a Ba yesian 5-parameter l ogistic regression model with 
overdose control [R15-
4233] using a hierarchical modelling approach to jointly  model both
arms and taking into account data available for e zabenlimab (BI 754091) from the ongoing 
trial 1381-0001. Tr ial 1381 -0001 is also a n oncology dose finding trial which comprises a 
similarly  heterogeneous population of patients with solid tumours . A comparison between 
trial 1426
-0001 and 1381 -0001 regarding study  population, DL T definition and treatment 
schedule is presented in Appendix Table 
10. 5: 3. A visualisation of the joint-modelling 
approach is given in Figure 7: 1.

MCS -40-106- RD-03(16.0)/Saved on:31Aug 2018Figure 7: 1 Joint BLRM modelling approach forArmsA and B
The logistic regression model for Arm A and B is defined as follows. Let π 1,d1 be the 
probability  of having a DLT when giving dose d 1 of BI 1387446 as monotherap y, and π 2,d2 the 
probability  of having a DLT when giving dose d 2 of the combination partner ezabenlimab (BI 
754091) as monotherap y, respectivel y. A logistic regression is used to model the dose -
toxicity  relationship for each of these drugs individually :
BI 1387446: logit(π 1,d1) =log(α 1) + β 1log(d 1/d1*)
Ezabenlimab (BI 754091) :logit(π 2,d2) =log(α 2) + β 2log(d 2/d2*)
Here, the doses and d2* = 240 mg represent the reference doses for BI 1387446
andezabenlimab (BI 754091) , respectively .
Assuming no toxicity  interaction between the two compounds, the probability  of a DLT when 
giving the combination dose d 1, d2is obtained as 
π012,d1,d2= π 1,d1+ π 2,d2- π1,d1π2,d
2
with corresponding odds 
odds(π012,d1,d2 )= π012,d1,d2 /(1- π012,d1,d2 )
In order to account for a potential positive (higher toxicity  than expected under 
independence) or negative (lower toxicity  than expected under independence) interaction 
between BI 1387446 and e zabenlimab (BI 754091) , a dose -dependent interaction term -∞<
η<∞ is introduced in the model by  the following definition:
odds(π 12,d1,d2 ) = odds(π012,d1,d2 ) exp(η d 1/d1* d2/d2*)
and π 12,d1,d2 is used in the likelihood
rd1,d2~ Binomial(n d1,d2,π12,d1,d2 )

3)A normal distribution for the interaction parameters η j:
  ~    ,    ,  =1,…, 3
The parameters   , ,   , , and   are the corresponding trial -specific parameters of each trial-

the form
Ψ =             
             
For this hierarchical model, the monotherap y dose -finding in Arm A and the double 
combination therap y dose -finding in Arm B, and trial 1381 - 0001 are assumed to be separate 
trials, with different inter -study  random effects    ,   ,   ,   ,  for the involved 
parameters. The parameters log   ,  and log   ,  (i=1,2; j=1,2,3) are assumed to be 
potentially  correlated with correlation coefficients    , i=1, 2, while the remaining parameters 
are assumed to be uncorrelated. Refer to [ R18-3210 ] for details. 
Since a Bay esian approach i s applied, prior distributions f for each of the parameters 
   ,   ,   ,   ,  ,   ,   ,   ,   ,  and for  , and   need to be specified. Weakl y 
informative prior distributions were chosen for the µ -and ρ -parameters, prior distr ibutions 
for the τ -parameters are chose n to represent a small to moderate between- trial heterogeneity
(see Table 7: 1 ).

The toxicity  probabilities π 1,d1, and π 12,d1,d2 , of a DLT at each dose/dose combination will be 
calculated directl y from the posterior samples regarding the arm -specific parameters, i.e. 
including the respective arm-specific random effects per parameter. They  will be summarized 
per arm using the following intervals:
Under toxicity : [0.00, 0.16 )
Targeted toxicity : [0.16, 0.33 )
Overtoxicity: [0.33, 1.00]
Prior probabilities of DLTs at different dose levels/dose combinations, as well as the 
corresponding probability  of under -, targeted and ove rtoxicity , are shown in Table 7: 2and
Table 7: 3for the initial weakl y informative prior s of the joint model for Arms A and B . As 
can be seen from these tables, the prior medians of the DLT probabilities represent 
reasonable assumptions on toxicity , and the uncertainty  around the medians is large, showing 
the low amoun t of information this prior provides .
Prior probabilities in Arm A show that fulfils the EWOC criterion and is therefore a 
suitable starting dose for the monotherapy dose finding in superficial lesions. Prior 
probabilities for Arm B do not allow to start combination dose finding at

For the determination of the MTD, only  MTD evaluable patients will be considered. For the 
analysis of all other endpoints, all patients in the treated set (i.e. patients treated with at least 
one dose of trial medication) will be included in the anal ysis. Analyses will in general be 
performed b y initial treatment, with the exception of patients who cross over from Arm A to 
Arm B . These patients will be analy sed as part of Arm A as long as they  are treated with 
monotherap y and as part of Arm B when they are treated with combination therap y.
More details and all other patient anal ysis sets will be defined in the Trial Statistical Analy sis 
Plan ( TSAP ). 
No per protocol set will be used in the anal ysis. However, important protocol deviations will 
be summarized. 
7.2.2 Primary endpoint analyses
In order to identify  the MTD, the number of evaluable patients with DLTs during the MTD 
evaluation period at each dose level in each arm must be presented. Replaced patients will be 
excluded from the determination of MTD. 
For Arm A and B, t he main anal ysis of the MTD will use the joint 5- parameter BLRM model 
described above using DLT data from the MTD evaluation period. For this anal ysis, cross -
over patients will only  be included while being treated with BI1387446 monotherapy  in Arm 
A

MCS -40-106- RD-03(16.0)/Saved on:31Aug 20188.3.1 Source documents
In accordance with regulatory  requirements, the Investigator should prepare and maintain 
adequate and accurate source documents and trialrecords that include all observations and 
other data pertinent to the investigation on each trialpatient . Source data as well as reported 
data should follow the “AL COA principle s” and be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, 
original and a ccurate. Changes to the data should be traceable (audit trail).
Data reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source data or the discrepancies must 
beexplained.
The current medical history  of the patient may not be sufficient to confirm eligibility  for the 
trialand the Investigator may need to request previous medical histories and evidence of any  
diagnostic tests. In this case ,the Investigator must make at least one 
documented attempt to 
retrieve previous medical records. If this fails ,a verbal history  from the patient, documented 
in their medical records, would be acceptable.
Copies of tumour assessment scans will be collected by the sponsor for later Radiomics 
assessment. This could include CT/MRI  scans of the chest and abdomen and/or imaging of 
any other known or suspected sites of disease ( e.g.pelvis, brain) using an appropriate 
method. Before sending or uploading those copies, the Investigator must ensure that all 
patient identifiers (e.g. patient’s name, initials, address, phone number, social securit y 
number) have properly  been removed or redacted from any  copy of the patients’ source 
documents before sending them to the sponsor.
If the patient is not compliant with the protocol , any  corrective action e.g. re -training must be 
documented in the patient file.
For theCRF, data must be derived from source documents, for example:
Patient identification : gender, year of birth (in accordance with local laws and 
regulations )
Patient participation in the trial(substance, trialnumber, patient number, date patient was 
informed)
Dates of patient ’s visits, including dispensing of trialmedication
Medical history  (including trialindication and concomitant diseases, if applicable)
Medication history
Adverse events and outcome events (onset date (mandatory ), and end date (if available))
Serious adverse events (onset date (mandatory ), and end date (if available))
Concomitant therap y (start date, changes)
Originals or copies of laboratory  results and other imaging or testing results, with proper 
documented medical evaluation (in validated electronic format, if available)
Completion of patient’s p articipation in the trial”(end date; in c ase of premature 
discontinuation document the reason for it).
Prior to allocation of a patient to a treatment into a clinical trial, there must be 
documented evidence in the source data (e.g. medical records) that the trialparticipant 
meets all inclusion criteria and does not meet an y exclusion criteria. The absence of 
records (either medical records , verbal documented feedback of the patient or testing

Technical information collected on PK sampling day s (e.g.PK sampling times, repeated 
vital signs linked with PK) may  be collected on specific paper PK logs, which will be 
considered as source data for related entries in eCRF and are considered Part of the ISF.
8.3.2 Direct access to source data and documents
The Investigator /institution will allow site trial-related monitoring, audits, IRB /IEC review 
and regulatory  inspections. Direct access must be provided to the CRF and all source 
documents/data, including progress notes, copies of laboratory and medical test results, which 
must be available at all times for review b y the CRA , auditor and regulatory  inspector 
(e.g. FDA). They  may  review all CRFs and informed consents. The accuracy  of the data will 
be verified b y direct comparison with the source documen ts described in Section 8.3.1 .The 
sponsor will also monitor compliance with the protocol and GCP.
In the event of force majeure or other disrupting circumstances (e.g. pandemic, war, please 
see Section 6 ), site access may  be restricted thus limiting the ability  to perform standard site 
monit oring activities on site such as on-site source data review and source data verification. 
Therefore, some of these activities may  be performed remotel y or replaced by  centralized 
monitoring to the extent possible, based on a documented risk assessment and in alignment 
with local regulations.
8.3.3
Storage period of records
Trial site(s):

10.1.2 Management of immune- related adverse events
Regarding management of immune -related adverse events, grading and treatment, up- to-date 
published guidelines should be considered [e.g. P19-00269]. Only  limited guidance on 
management of specific irAEs can be given here.
Please refer to published guidelines (e.g. ASCO guideline, Brahmer [P19- 00269]) for details. 
In gener al, 
-For irAEs listed below , the guidance from Section 4.1.4.3 is not considered applicable 
stating that o nly if a causal relationship to one trial drug can be unequivocally  
established, the other trial drug may  be continued. O ncombination treatment both

exposed together.
-Ezabenlimab (BI 754091) and BI 1387446 should be continued with close monitoring 
in case of grade 1 irAEs, with the exception of irAEs that may  rapidly  evolve into 
severe or fatal conditions (encephalitis of an y grade, my ocarditis of any grade, 
pneumonitis that is grade 1 but shows radiographic evidence of worsening –see 
detailed guidance below). A dose reduction of BI 1387446 may  be considered, but is 
not required for the first occurrence of an irAE grade 1.
-For most Grade 2 irAEs, ezabenlimab (BI 754091) and BI 1387446 should be 
withheld and treatment with corticosteroids is commonly  warranted, usually with an 
initial dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg prednisone / prednisone equivalent dail y. Restart of 
therap y is commonly possible once s ymptoms and/or laboratory  values have resolved 
to grade 1 or less, and on ≤ 10 mg prednisone / prednisone equivalent per day .A dose 
reduction of BI 1387446 should be considered, but is not required for the first 
occurrence of an irAE, but is mandatory  if the same irAE recurs upon rechallenge 
with BI 1387446.
-For Grade 3 irAEs, 
ezabenlimab (BI 754091) and BI 1387446 has to be withheld, and 
treatment with high -dose corticosteroids (1 -2mg/kg/d prednisone / prednisone 
equivalent) is usually  warranted. Upon improvement, steroids should be tapered 
slowly  over 4 -6 weeks. Non- steroidal immunosuppressives (e.g. infliximab, 
mycophonlate mofetil) should be considered if no improvement or worsening occurs 
within the initial 48 to 72 hours. Upon recovery  to grade 1 or less, and on ≤ 10 mg 
prednisone / prednisone equivalent per day ,restarting ezabenlimab (BI 754091) and 
BI 1387446 may be considered for selected irAEs, but c aution is advised, in particular 
in patients with earl y-onset irAEs. Expert consultancy  and agreement with medical 
monitor is recommended prior to restart of therapy. BI 1387446 should be 
administered at a reduced dose.
-Most Grade 4 irAEs warrant permanent discontinuation of ezabenlimab (BI 754091)
and BI 1387446. 
-Restart of therap y is commonly  possible for endocrine irAEs regardless of grade once 
stable hormone replacement has been instituted and sy mptoms have recovered. In 
case of multiple hormone deficiencies, corticosteroid replacement has to precede 
thyroid hormone replacement therapy  by several day s in order to avoid adrenal crisis. 
A dose reduction of BI 1387446 may  be considered, but is not required for the first 
occurrence of an endocrine irA E.
In case of prolonged steroid therap y or treatment with immunosuppressives consider the 
possibility  of opportunistic infections and tuberculosis reactivation. Careful monitoring and
consideration of administration of proph ylactic antibiotics where appro priate are warranted. 
Commonly , referral to experts in the management of organ -specific conditions is highly  
recommended, especially for irAEs grade 3 or grade 4, or irAEs where management is 
complex.

10.3 TUMOUR ASSESSMENTS
Tumour assessments will be performed according to Response criteria for intra tumour al 
immunotherapy  in solid tumour s (itRECI ST) (R20-2734). 
At baseline, tumour lesions and ly mph nodes will first be categorised asmeasurable or non-
measurable. Measurable lesions are then classified as target (selected to be observed 
quantitatively ) or non- target (selected to be observed qualitatively ), and the decision about 
which lesion isto be injected ismade. In this trial, a lesion selected for injection must be 
measurable (seeSection 10.3 .1for details).
At baseline, one lesion projected for injection should be classified as target injected (T -I), 
only in exceptional cases, two lesions may  be projected for injection and thus be classified as 
T-I (refer to S ection 4.1.4.1). Up to 5 lesions can be classified as target non- injected (T -NI). 
All lesions not chosen as target are observed qualitatively  as non -target. See Figure 10.3: 1
for details on the classifications of lesions at baseline. As in this trial, a lesion selected for 
injection must be measurable, lesions selected for injection at baseline can only  be target
(refer to Section 4.1.4.1).

MCS -40-106- RD-03(16.0)/Saved on:31Aug 2018Figure 10.3: 1 Classification of lesions at baseline
Lesions designated as T -I will be used to evaluate the injected lesion response. Lesions 
designated as T -NI should remain non-injected for as long as possible to allow assessment of 
the maximal non -injected lesion response . However, in the case that there isno other lesion 
available for injection, or the T- NI lesions are enlarging, T -NI lesions may  be injected and 
recategorized to T -I, if they  meet the criteria for injection.
Similarly  to T -NI lesions, also NT -NI lesions may be injected and recategorized to NT -I, if 
they meet the criteria for injection (in particular if they  are measurable according to 
Section 10.3.1 ). However, even though measurabl e, these lesions will contribute to the 
overall response only  with their qualitative assessment.
A sum of diameters (SOD; longest diameters for extranodal lesions and short axis for ly mph 
nodes) will be calculated for all target lesions combined and separ ately for T -I and T -NI-
lesions. 
The overall response for each visit will be based on the changes in the SOD of all target 
lesions together (SOD of T -I and T -NI combined versus combined SOD at baseline and at 
nadir), the qualitative assessment of all non- target lesions, and the evaluation for possible 
new lesions .The same response categories and their logical combination as with RECI ST1.1
will be used. The following overall response categories may  be assigned: Complete Response 
(itCR), Partial Response (itPR), Stable Disease (itSD), Unconfirmed Progressive Disease 
(itUPD), and Confirmed Progressive Disease (itCPD). See Figure 10.3: 2 for details.

For the purpose of this trial ,assessment of individual lesions, injected and non -injected, as 
well as the overall response assessment for each visit will be reported in the eCRF, butthe 
injected and non-injected response (including the quantitative best percentage change from 
baseline in size of injected and non- injected lesions) will only  be derived retrospectivel y for 
the final anal ysis. Both, the non -injected lesion response and the injected lesion response, will 
be bas ed on the respective target lesions’ SODs (See Section 7 for details).  
10.3.1 Injected lesions
At screening the Investigator will select a tumour lesion which is projected to be injected. All 
injected tumour lesions need to be meas urable as per RECI ST 1.1, i.e. the longest diameter 
must have a minimum size of
10 mm if measured b y CT scan or MRI (lymph nodes have to be at least 15mm in 
short axis) 
20 mm by  chest X -ray.
The following modifications to RECI ST 1.1 apply according to it RECI ST:
Ultrasound is acceptable to guide injection into any  lesion loca tion for which 
ultrasound guidance is indicated. For tumour assessments ultrasound may  be used for 
measurement of lesions classified as superficial, e.g. soft tissue lesions, which can not 
be effectivel y imaged b y CT scan. However, ultrasound is not acceptable for tumour
assessments of deep/visceral lesions which can be measured on CT or MRI scans. The 
longest diameter of a non -visible lesion measured by  ultrasound must have a 
minimum si ze of 10mm.
All visible tumour lesions potentially  suitable for injection need to be assessed at 
baseline b y digital photog raphy  with the use of a caliper/ digital scale. The longest 
diameter of a visible lesion has to be at least 1 cm to qualify  for injection. The 
injected lesion has to be measured and documented by  digital photograph y with 
caliper/digital scale at each tumour assessment timepoint. I f more than one visible

longest diameter meets the minimum criteria as required per RECI ST 1.1 (see Section 
10.3.2.1 ).
One measurable lesion will be selected for injection at baseline and classified as target 
injected (T -I) according to itRECI ST. Only in exceptional cases, two lesions may  be selected 
for injection and classified as T- I. Each lesion selected for injection will be unequivocall y 
identified in the eCRF. Radiologic images as well as photographic images of visible lesions 
will be collected for central review. If available, additional information, e.g. screenshots or 
marks on imaging studies submitted for central review may
 be considered in addition. Visible 
tumour lesions, e.g. skin lesions, have to be documented by digital photography  with the use 
of a caliper/digital scale. 
Measurable lesions not pre -selected for injection at baseline can be re- categorized as injected 
lesions during the course of the trial if the decision is made to inject them after baseline 
assessment. In case different lesions are injected during the course of the trial, all injected 
lesions need to be identified at baseline or in retrospect on the imaging study or 
photodocumentation at baseline and captured in the eCRF . 
Location of lesions w ill be classified as skin, other connective tissue, l ymph node, liver, other 
organ.
10.3.2 Non-injected lesions
Photodocumentation for visible lesions as outlined in S ection 10.3.1 and ultrasound for 
superficial lesions not measurable on CT may be used for theassessment of non -injected 
lesions too .
Optimal anatomic coverage of imaging studies should encompass all areas of known 
predilection for metastases in the disease under evaluation ,andshould additionally  
investigate areas that may  be involved based on signs and s ymptoms of individual patients. 
Because a lesion later identified in a body  part not scanned at baseline would be considered 
as a new lesion representing disease progression, careful consideration should be given to the 
extent of imaging coverage at baseline and at subsequent follow- up time points. This will 
enable better consistency not only  of tumour measurements but also identification of new 
disease.
10.3.2.1 Target non- injected (T-NI)lesions
Measurable non-injected tumour lesions must be accurately  measured in at least one 
dimension, the longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded with a 
minimum size of 
10 mm by  CT scan, 
10 mm by  caliper measurement by  clinical exam or ultrasound, or 
20 mm by  chest X -ray. 
Malignant l ymph nodes must be ≥15 mm in short axis.

involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at 
all tumour assessment timepoints indicated in the Flow C hart.
Prefer ably, a non -injected lesion which is selected for biopsy  should not be classified as 
target non- injected lesion. 
10.3.2.2 Non-target non- injected (NT-NI)lesions
Non-measurable non- injected lesions, e.g. malignant effusions, ly mphangitic involvement of 
s

be captured as non -target lesions and qualitatively  assessed at the tumour assessment 
timepoints indicated in the Flow C hart.

10.4 P HARMACOKINETIC METHODS AND ANALYSES
Pharmacokinetic analysis
The exploratory  parameters (refer to Section 5.3.1) will be calculated according to internal 
SOPs. All evaluable patients who received at least one dose of BI 1387446 or e zabenlimab 
(BI 754091) and provide at least one plasma concentration value will be included in the PK 
analysis. Patients who are considered as not evaluable will be listed with their individual 
plasma concentrations and individual PK parameters, and will be not included in desc riptive 
statistics for plasma concentrations, PK parameters or other statistical assessment.
The following descriptive statistics will be calculated for all analy teconcentrations as well as 
for all PK parameters: N, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, maximum, 
arithmetic coefficient of variation, geometric mean, and geometric coefficient of variation. 
The data format for descriptive statistics of concentrations will be identical with the data 
format of the respective concentrations.
Handling of missing data
Drug concentration -time profiles
Concentration data identified with NOS (no sample available), NOR (no valid result), NOA
(not anal ysed), and BLQ (below the limit of quantification) will be ignored and not replaced
by zero at any  time point (applies also to the lag phase including the pre- dose value(s)).

Every  effort will be made to include all concentration data in an anal ysis. If not possible, a
case to case -to-case decision is required whether the value should only  be excluded from
half-life estimation or the complete anal ysis.
If a concentration is only excluded from half-life determination, it will be used for all
other calculations ( e.g.descriptive statistics) and for graphical presentation.
If a concentration value is excluded from all calculations, it wil l not be presented

determination. However, the excluded concentration itself will be listed in the CTR
associated with an appropriate flag.

of the trial. The model isintroduced in Section 7, which also specifies the prior sfor the 
model. After patients in each cohort have completed at least one cy cle of treatment, the prior 
distribution will be updated through No-U-Turn sampling procedures (Hamiltonian Monte 
Carlo, [ R21-3791]) with the accumulated DLT data from the MTD evaluation period. 
Posterior probabil ities for the rate of DLTs will be summarised from the joint BL RM for 
Arms A and B . Selection of the next dose in each arm will be based on these probabilities as 
well as on other safet y and laboratory data.
The purpose of this statistical appendix is to present performance metrics (operating 
characteristics) that illustrate the precision of the design in estimating the MTD under various 
dose-toxicity  relationships through computer simulation. These results are summarised in 
Table 10.5: 3.For simplicity  reasons, a cohort size of 3 patients who are all evaluable starting 
at 50 µg (Arms A and B) is assumed f or calculation of the operating characteristics.
In addition, recommendations of the next dose level in each arm by  the 
joint BL RMwith 
overdose control principle are also provided under various hy pothetical outcome scenarios to 
show how it facilitates on -trial dose-escalation decisions (see Table 10.5: 1). 
Hypothetical data scenarios
Hypothetic al data scenarios are shown in Table 10.5: 1for Arms A and B . These scenarios 
reflect potential on -trial data constellations and related escalation as allowed by  the model 
and the 100% escalation limit. For each scenario and ea ch arm, the probability  of overdose 
for the current dose, as well as the next potential dose and related probabilities of under -
dosing, target dose and over -dosing are shown.

MCS -40-106- RD-03(16.0)/Saved on:31Aug 2018Scenarios 6 and 1 0explicitly  show the characteristics of the joint model. I f DL Ts are onl y 
observed in one of the three arms, escalation is also influenced in the other arms. For example 
in Scenario 1 0, although no DL Ts are observed in Arm B, no escalation  
is allowed by  the overdose control implemented in the model since 3 of 6 
patients in Arm A experienced DLTs In Scenario 
6, the DLTs that are observed in 
Arm B result in de -escalation of the dose in Arm A  
although in Arm A no DLTs have been observed. 
Finally , Scenarios 13 and 1 4 illustrate cases where escalation has proceeded up to the highest 
dose  in Arm A and  in Arm B. In both Arms, this dose
(combination) could be declared as MTD as it satisfies the conditions for MTD declaration 
specified in Section 7.

possible cases as follows:
Scenario 1: moderate -toxicity  scenario
Scenario 2: high -toxicity  scenario
Scenario 3: low -toxicity  scenario
Scenario 4: non -logistic dose -toxicity  scenario
Scenario 5: all planned doses in overdose range
For Arms A an d B, two additional scenarios were used to assess the operating characteristics, 
especiall y to assess the effect of the interaction between BI 1387446 and ezabenlimab (BI 
754091)
.

1387446, represented b y a very  flat dose -toxicity  curve (as indicated b y currently 
available data on ezabenlimab (BI 754091) ) that lies in the overdose range (indicating 
a quite toxic behaviour of BI 1387446, contrarily  to the ezabenlimab (BI 754091)
data, which indicate a very  low toxicity  overall)
Scenario 7: Large interaction effect between BI 1387446 and ezabenlimab (BI

MCS -40-106- RD-03(16.0)/Saved on:31Aug 2018Table 10.5: 3 Simulated operating characteristics for Arms A and B
 
In Scenario 1 which reflects the case of a moderate true dose -toxicity , around 29% of trials in 
Arm A have found a
nMTD with true DLT rate in the target interval. In addition to that, 288
trials as MTD, which has an assumed true toxicity  probability  of 0.1 36
which is very  close to the lower boundary of the target interval. In Arm B ,around 82 % of the
simulated trials have declared a dose as MTD that has an assumed true DLT rate in the target 
range.
In Scenario 2 (high -toxicity  scenario), around 41 % of trials in Arm A and around 27% of 
trials in Arm
Bhave been stopped prematurel y due to too toxic doses. This is an expected 
situation for a high -toxicity  scenario. Nevertheless, around 55% of trials in Arm A and 
around 6
1% of trials in Arm B declared a dose as MTD that has an assumed true DLT rate in 
the target interval.
Scenario 3 (low -toxicity  scenario) shows that in Arm A around 63% of trials declared MTDs 
with true 
DLT rate in the target interval. The majority  of the rest of the trials ( 256trials) 
as the MTD, which has a true DLT rate in the underdose interval. In Arm B 
around 90% of tr ials declared a dose as MTD that has an assumed true toxicity  rate in the 
target interval. 
Scenario 4 represents a case where the assumed true dose- toxicity  curve does not follow a 
logistic shape. In this scenario, 40.3% of trials in Arm A determined a dose as MTD which

MCS -40-106- RD-03(16.0)/Saved on:31Aug 2018has a true DLT rate in the target interval. Additionally , 475 trials in Arm A declared  
as the MTD, which has an assumed true toxicity  probability  of 0.112. In Arm B, 67.9% of 
trials declared a dose as MTD which has a true DLT rate in the target interval. I n addition to 
that, 207 trials declared the combination of 240 mg as MTD which has an assumed 
true toxicity  probability  of 0.383, which is close to the upper boundary  of the target interval.
In scenario 5, all specified dose levels have an assumed toxicity  rate in the overdose interval. 
In this case most of the simulated trials stop prematurely  because all specified dose levels are 
too toxic. In all 3 arms several simulated trials ( Arm A: 1 3.8%, Arm B: 1 2.4% ) declare doses 
as MTD with true DLT rate in the overdose interval. Most of these trials choose or 
as MTD. These doses have assumed true toxicity  rates not too far away  from the 
target rate therefore this is still acceptable for such overly  toxic scenarios.  
In scenario 6, the data for 
ezabenlimab (BI 754091) largel y deviates from the data for BI 
1387446. While a flat dose-t oxicity  curve that lies in the overdose range is assumed for BI 
1387446, very  low toxicity  is assumed for ezabenlimab (BI 754091) . This results in high -
toxicity  for the combination arm B: Manyof the simulated trials in Arm B stop prematurel y 
because all specified dose levels are too toxic . Additionally , around 56% of trials in Arm B
declare doses as MTD with true DLT rate in the overdose interval. Most of these trials choose 
 or as MTD. These combinations have assumed true toxicity  
rates not too far away  from the target rate . In Arm A, 51.6% of the simulated trials declare a 
dose a s MTD which has an assumed true DLT rate in the underdose interval. In almost all of 
these cases were chose nas MTD and these dose levels have an assumed 
true toxicity  probability  of 0.099 and 0.136 
In scenario 7 (high interaction between BI 1387446 and e zabenlimab (BI 754091) ), 44.9% of 
the trials in Arm A declared a dose as MTD which has a true DLT rate in the underdose 
interval. 3
14of these trials declared as the MTD which has a true toxicity  probabilit y 
of 0.136 which is close to the lower boundary  of the target interval. In Arm B around 7 4% of 
trials determined an MTD that has an assumed true toxicity  rate in the target interval. 
The mean patient number sin Arm A range from approximately  5.6patients (Scenario 5) to 
17.3 patients (Scenario 3) and the maximum number of patients was 36(Scenario 3 ). 
Similarly , for Arm B, the mean patient numbers range from 5.0 (Scenario 5) to 15.6 
(Scenario 3), with a maximum number of 45 patients in a simulated trial under Scenario 3.
Therefore, the patient numbers are as expected and increase when moving away  from the 
high-toxicity  scenario.
By reviewing the metrics presented in Table 10.5: 3,itcan be seen that the joint model isnot 
sensitive to different scenarios of truth. Even under misspecification results are satisfactory . 
In general, these models are conservative due to the overdose control criteria. In all scenarios, 
the probabilities of recommending a dose with true P(DLT) ≥33% as MTD are much smaller 
than probabilities of recommending a dose with true P(DLT) between 16% and 33% as MTD.

Description of change Revisions to describe postponement of Arm C 
and clarification of handling of cross -over 
patients for MTD analy sis. 
Rationale for change Figure 3.1.1: 1 revised to reflect postponement to 
start of Arm C. 
For the main anal ysis of the MTD, cross -over 
patients will only  be included while being treated 
with BI 1387446 monothera py in Arm A. 
However, cross -over patients will be included in 
the sensitivity  anal yses of the MTD and thus be 
considered in addition. 
Section to be changed Section 3.1.2
Description of change Clarification added regarding the starting dose in 
Arm C and handling of DL Ts in backfill patients. 
Rationale for change The starting dose in Arm C will depend on the 
highest dose determined to be safe for patients in 
Arm B. The starting dose may  be de layed to a 
higher dose level to avoid putting patients at 
procedural risks for doses with lack of activit y.

the EWOC criterion and will be lower than the 
MTD and recommended dose, respectively , 
established f or the combination of BI 1387446 
and ezabenlimab (BI 754091) in superficial 
tumour s. Furthermore, dose escalation in Arm C 
will start at least one dose level lower than the 
recommended starting dose based on the joint 
BLRM.   
Backfill patients who have e ither experienced a 
DLT or have been observed for at least the MTD 
evaluation period without experiencing a DLT 
will be included into the main BL RM at the next 
subsequent SMC meeting. Particularl y, in case 
DLTs are observed in 'backfill' patients, this 
information may affect the magnitude of dose 
escalation or even result in dose de- escalation .
In case of the occurrence of DLTs, the SMC may  
decide about intervals between enrollment of 
patients, if applicable.

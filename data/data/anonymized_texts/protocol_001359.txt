Study Title:  
Phase 2 Placebo -Controlled, Single- Site, Single -Blind Study of Rivaroxaban Reversal 
by Ciraparantag as Measured by WBCT  
Study Num ber: 
PER977-02-012 
Study Phase: 2  
Study Design:  
This study is  a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the 
efficacy and safety of ciraparantag administered to healthy volunteers anticoagulated 
with rivaroxaban  measuring clotting times using Whole B lood Clotting Time (WBCT) .  
All subjects will undergo screening up to 36 days prior to enrollment.  Randomization will take place on Day 3.  
Subjects will be enrolled sequentially.  If the Screening visit takes place within 3 week prior to check -in, the check-in procedures may be modified to exclude redundant 
procedures ( safety laboratory tests,  ECG, and physical examination) at the discretion of 
the Investigator.  There will be a safety review after  completion of treatment in one 
cohort and the initiation of treatment in the subsequent cohort. 
Subjects (n=16 per cohort) will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive ciraparantag or 
placebo (saline for injection).  For dosing scheme, please refer to the figure below.  
All subjects will receive a single dose of 20 mg rivaroxaban  QD in the morning on 
Days 1 -3. Study drug will be administered only to those subjects who have a minimum 
increase in clotting time of 25% (as measured by  WBCT ) above baseline at the pre-
study drug (i.e., 3.75 hours post r ivaroxaban ) time point on Day 3.  Any subject who 
does not have a minimum increase in clotting time of 25% above baseline at the pre-
study drug time point on Day 3 will be discontinued from the study and replaced.  At 4 hours following rivaroxaban  a single  intravenous (IV) dose of study drug (ciraparantag 
or placebo) will be administered.   
Individual subjects may participate in one dose cohort of this study.  Any subject who discontinues prior to completion for reasons other than an adverse event (AE) will be replaced and the replacement subject will receive the same treatment as the original 
subject.  Subjects who discontinue due to an AE that precedes administration of study

AEs that follow administration of study drug will not be replaced.   
A complete schedule of events for Cohort 1-4 is provided. 
Throughout this protocol, the active study drug doses are expressed as active drug 
moiety (ciraparantag) (as opposed to pre viously used ciraparantag acetate salt).  The 
administered dose is based on a concentration of 6 mg/mL ciraparantag (active moiety) and translates to the following dose conversions from previously used dose identifications:  
Ciraparantag Acetate  Ciraparantag  Dose Volume  
600 mg 360 mg  60 mL  
300 mg 180 mg  30 mL  
100 mg  60 mg  10 mL  
50 mg  30 mg  5 mL  
25 mg 15 mg 2.5 mL  
Dose Schema  
 
The goal of the study is to explore the dose range of ciraparantag that reverses the anticoagulation induced by therapeutic doses of rivaroxaban at steady state. The study is intended to establish a dose of ciraparantag that fully reverses steady -state 
rivaroxaban, to evaluate at least one dose above the reversal dose to establish a therapeutic index, and at least one partial or no effect dose.  
Dose Rationale 
A total of four dosing cohorts (Cohorts 1-4) are planned.  The planned doses of 
ciraparantag or placebo (administered as a volume equivalent of ciraparantag) have been evaluated as single and repeat IV doses from 5 mg ciraparantag acetate (3 mg ciraparantag) up to 600 mg ciraparantag acetate (360 mg ciraparantag) in previous protocols (PER977-01-001, PER977-01-002, PER977-01-003, and PER977-02-001).   
Primary Objective(s):  
The primary objectives of this study are: 
• To evaluate the efficacy of ciraparantag in the reversal of anticoagulation 
induced by rivaroxaban 20 mg administered orally  once daily for three days as 
assessed by WBCT.

Confidential  Page 32 of 97 1 INTRODUCTION 
Ciraparantag (PER977) is a small, synthetic water -soluble new molecular entity that 
physically associates with heparins and related anticoagulant drug s (i.e., direct factor Xa  
[FXa] and factor IIa [F IIa] inhibitors) allowing rapid re-establishment of a normal blood 
coagulation state.  This reversal effect is due to direct non -covalent binding to the 
anticoagulant molecule with no binding to blood coagulation factors or proteins in the 
blood. 
1.1 Clinical Problem 
In the United States, the number of patients requiring anticoagulation annually numbers in the millions; upwards of 600,000 patients with thromboembolic events or pulmonary embolism, ( CDC Fast Stats 2012) and over 1 million joint replacement procedures (knee 
and hip), ( CDC Statistics 2010 ) necessitate prophylactic post -operative anticoagulation, 
and most of the 2.66 million patients with atrial fibrillation will also be prophylactically anticoagulated . (CDC Atrial Fibrillation Fact Sheet)  
Anticoagulation is time consuming and problematic for both physicians and patients.  The traditional anticoagulants (heparin and warfarin) have a long history of successful clinical use, with an accepted risk of subs tantial bleeding. ( Palareti G 2011, FDA Safety 
Alert 2012) Due to the incidence of major bleeding associated with the traditional anticoagulants, demand for new therapeutic anticoagulants has been met with the introduction of low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) products and selective oral 
inhibitors of clotting factor IIa and Xa.  Although the new oral anticoagulants ( NOACs ) 
have several advantages including rapid therapeutic effectiveness, ease of dosing, and lack of monitoring requirements, each is associated with risk of major bleeding. ( ISMP 
2012)  
A significant obstacle to adoption of the new FXa and F IIa inhibitors is clinical concern 
regarding the lack of an effective reversal agent (e.g., vitamin K for warfarin, protamine 
for heparin and LMWH [partia l reversal]).  This is germane in cases of overdose, trauma, 
need for emergency or urgent surgery, and in patients undergoing elective procedures 
(cardiac ablations, endoscopies with biopsies, extensive dental surgery) that may require discontinuation, changing, or bridging of anticoagulation.  Current recommendations call for termination of anticoagulants between 2 – 4 days prior to the elective procedures and cautiously keeping a patient off anticoagulation for some period of time after the procedure, especially if a biopsy or invasive procedure has been used. ( McLean 2012) In 
emergency surgeries, where it is desirable to wait until at least 3 half -lives have passed 
before surgical intervention, if possible, patients are at risk of significant bleeding. 
An efficacious reversal agent for the LMWHs and oral FXa  and F IIa inhibitors would 
permit rapid reversal of anticoagulation for emergency purposes, minimize the time

Confidential  Page 33 of 97 patients are off their anticoagulant pre-procedure, and provide a level of confidence 
regard ing restarting the anticoagulant therapy post -procedure.   
Equally germane is the issue of identification of biomarkers for both efficacy and safety monitoring for pro-coagulation signals for drugs under development for reversal of anticoagulants.  Many of the commonly used biomarkers (prothrombin time [PT], activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], anti- factor Xa [anti -FXa], etc.) show 
significant disparity between the biomarker’s indication of a reversal and the lack of bleeding cessation , if there is  reagent interference.  The primary goal of reversing an 
anticoagulant is simply to return the ability of the blood to clot; historical biomarkers have been used for this purpose but they remain surrogate biomarkers. This problem is addressed by WBCT , whic h measures clotting time in fresh whole blood samples. 
1.2 Clinical Development of Ciraparantag  
As of August 15, 2016, ciraparantag (PER977; previously, aripazine) has been evaluated in four clinical studies of single escalating doses of ciraparantag followin g administration 
edoxaban (PER977-01-001; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), unfractionated heparin (PER977-01-002; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), and enoxaparin (PER977-01-003; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), and following anticoagulation and re-anticoagulation with edoxaban (PER977-02-001; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  In this protocol, all doses are listed as the ciraparantag base equivalent.  Both dosing 
formats are utilized in the presentation of clinical data from previous studies.   
In each of the protocols the dosing of active study drug was described based on the drug 
substance ciraparantag acetate (salt).  In accordance with new guidelines, the drug substance content is now labeled as active moiety (ciraparantag).  Throughout this document, the active study drug doses are expressed according to the new convention. 
Com pleted safety and efficacy data from PER977 -01-001, PER977-01-003, and PER977-
02-001 are presented.  
1.2.1 PER977-01-001 
PER977-01-001 was a phase 1, first in human, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
sequential group, two-period, ascending ciraparantag dose study administered alone and in combination with edoxaban in healthy volunteers.  The study consisted of two periods: a single intravenous IV injection of 3 mg, 9 mg, 15 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg, 120 mg or 180 mg ciraparantag, respectively (ciraparantag acetate 5, mg, 15, mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, or 300 mg) alone or placebo with serial pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and safety monitoring.  After a one-week washout, a single dose of edoxaban 60 mg was administered followed 3 hours later by a single dose of ciraparantag or placebo at the same dosage as was administered in the first period, and with serial PK, PD, and safety monitoring.

Confidential  Page 34 of 97 The highest incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in Period 1 
(ciraparantag monotherapy) were in the system organ class (SOC) of general disorders and administration -site conditions (feeling hot; n=14, 24.1%), and in nervous system 
disorders ( dysg eusia; n=8, 13.8%).  Adverse events in placebo subjects comprised feeling 
cold, headache, infusion related reaction and peripheral coldness reported in one subject each.  
The highest incidence of TEAEs in Period 2 was in the SOC of general disorders and administration -site conditions (feeling hot n=11, 17.2%), nervous system disorders 
(dysgeusia n=8, 12.5%), and in injury, poisonings, and procedural complications (contusion n=7, 10.9%).  Adverse events in placebo subjects comprised feeling cold chest discomfort, infusion site coldness, vessel puncture site pain, dysgeusia , headache, 
contusion, infusion related reaction, peripheral coldness, and hematoma reported in one subject each.  
No serious AEs were reported during the conduct of the study, no laboratory results were reported as AEs and there were no clinically significant changes in vital signs.  There were no clinically significant AEs and no dose-related findings occurred with regard to interval prolongations in median of triplicate ECG tracings with regard to HR, P -R, QRS, 
QTcF or R -R intervals.  
The protocol initially designated prothrombin time (PT) and throm boelastography 
reaction time (TEG -R) as the primary PD efficacy variables based on their use in in vitro  
studies.  One of the objectives of the protocol was to assess which biomarkers were the best endpoints for future clinical trials.  In seeking a biomar ker for ciraparantag reversal 
effect on anticoagulants, the fact that cationic ciraparantag exhibits strong binding to anionic citrate, ethylene diaminetetra  acetic acid (EDTA), and oxalate due to charge 
interaction became problematic.  Plasma tubes contain a large molar excess of anions that overwhelm and disrupt the ciraparantag-anticoagulant complex rendering the results of plasma -based assays non-representative of physiologic conditions.  Findings in Cohorts 
1-4 of the study indicated that PT and TEG- R would not be acceptable biomarkers in 
clinical trials due to their insensitivity and high variability.  Whole blood collected in tubes and transported to the laboratory for TEG-R testing were observed to be clotting clinically faster as study drug dose increased, and yet the PT values showed no change and TEG -R showed a high degree of variability between time points and between 
subjects.  Mean PT and TEG-R showed no change over time within cohorts and across escalating dose cohorts.  
Enhanced clotting of ant icoagulated blood was observed beginning in Cohort 2 (30 mg 
ciraparantag [ciraparantag acetate 50 mg]).  Whole blood clotting time (WBCT; referred to as ‘venous clotting time’ or ‘VCT’ in the protocol or Lee- White clotting time where -in 
glass is the only activating agent) was performed on discarded blood samples from a few patients.  This was done in order to assess whether blood was clotting slower than baseline with edoxaban administration (e.g., anticoagulation) and possibly returning to

Confidential  Page 35 of 97 baseline after administration of study drug (i.e., reversal of anticoagulation by 
ciraparantag).  Data from the pilot subjects showed a significant increase in clotting time with edoxaban and agreement between independent observers.  As a result of these observations, mea surement of clotting, glass bead activated clotting time and WBCT 
were added to the study as additional exploratory biomarkers for Cohorts 6-7 (120 mg ciraparantag [ciraparantag acetate 200 mg] and 180 mg ciraparantag [300 mg ciraparantag acetate], respect ively).  
Ciraparantag acetate displayed no pro -coagulant activity as demonstrated by lack of 
effect on WBCT, D-dimer, prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 (F1.2), or tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) when administered alone in doses ranging from 3 to 180 mg ciraparantag (5 to 300 mg ciraparantag acetate).  
When administered following edoxaban, a single IV dose of ciraparantag acetate 30 mg, 60 mg, 120 mg, and 180 mg ciraparantag (50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg ciraparantag acetate) demonstrated reversal of edoxaban -induced anticoagulation versus 
placebo for the full testing period of 24 hours following study drug administration.  Evidence of reversal of anticoagulation was noted 10 - 30 minutes post-study drug administration in subjects administered 30 mg to 1 80 mg ciraparantag (50 to 300 mg 
ciraparantag acetate).  Initial signs of reversal were noted in Cohort 4 (30 mg ciraparantag [50 mg ciraparantag acetate]) and full reversal was confirmed with subsequent increasing dose in Cohorts 5 to 7 (60 to 180 mg ciraparantag [100 mg to 300 mg ciraparantag acetate]).  There was no evidence of significant reversal of WBCT in subjects who received 15 mg ciraparantag (25 mg ciraparantag acetate) in a repeat cohort of new subjects.

A dose of 15 mg ciraparantag (equivalent to 25 mg ciraparantag acetate; see conversion

statistically significantly improvement in change in WBCT (percent change from baseline).  The administration of 30 mg ciraparantag (50 mg ciraparantag acetate) (4 subjects) resulted in numer ical and statistically significant differences from placebo at 
10 minutes and 60 minutes.  The 60 mg ciraparantag (100 mg ciraparantag acetate) dose group showed statistically significant percentage change from baseline compared to placebo at all time poin ts but the 10-minute group.  Average WBCT in subjects who

The designated biomarkers in the protocol (PT and TEG-R) were found to be insensitive and too variable for clinical study use.  Whole blood clotting time was identified as the most sensitive and clinically relevant biomarker in a subset of the cohorts and was targeted for use as the primary efficacy variable in all subsequent studies.  
1.2.2 PER977-01-002 
This was a single -blind, placebo-controlled, sequenti al group, ascending ciraparantag 
dose study in healthy volunteers.  Ten subjects were enrolled in each dose cohort and randomized in an 8:2 ratio to ciraparantag: placebo.  All subjects in all cohorts received UFH 5000u by IV bolus injection followed immediately by 5000u administered by IV infusion over 3 hours (~1667u/hour).   
Six cohorts of 10 subjects had been enrolled and had received 60 mg, 120 mg, 180 mg, 
240 mg, 300 mg, and 360 mg ciraparantag, respectively.  Cohort 4 (240 mg) only was performed as a two -period treatment where each subject received a single dose of 
ciraparantag alone during Period 1 and during Period 2, each subject received UFH followed by a single dose of ciraparantag.  
Perosphere had planned to advance dosing to 480 mg ciraparantag, but the study was closed early for business reasons.  Current clinical study plans involve a return to a protocol investigating the reversal of unfractionated heparin by ciraparantag following completion of studies with edoxaban and enoxaparin.  There wer e no safety concerns that 
lead to the early termination. No dose limiting toxicities or TEAEs of concern were observed.   
Following ciraparantag dosing, over the 60 mg to 360 mg dose levels administered in the 
study, there were no apparent differences in WBCT for the active treatments compared to placebo.  
Ciraparantag  Perosphere Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: PER977 -02-012 02May2019 
 
Confidential  Page 38 of 97 Complete, partial, and no reversal for WBCT were observed at the same rate for all 
PER977 doses combined and placebo group. There were no apparent dose- related 
relationships for any of the reversal categor ies. There were no statistically significant 
differences between geometric least -squares means in ciraparantag treatments compared 
to placebo group for percent of baseline WBCT at most time points and for PD parameters. The WBCT return to baseline was achi eved at similar times, two -hour or 
four-hour time points, across active treatments and placebo group. 
For the secondary endpoints, there were no statistically significant differences for active 
ciraparantag treatments versus placebo in most comparisons for PoC- aPTT and the 
procoagulant biomarkers TEG-R, D-dimer, F1.2, and TFPI. 
Across the 60 mg to 360 mg ciraparantag  dose levels, assessments of relationship 
between dosage and reversal of anticoagulation (complete reversal versus partial or 
reversal) and exp osure response showed no statistically significant correlations. 
The lack of reversal of unfractionated heparin at the ciraparantag doses utilized in the protocol was not unexpected due to the much higher binding ability of unfractionated heparin for ciraparantag compared to the newer oral anticoagulants and the smaller enoxaparin  molecules.  
No deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), or discontinuations due to AEs were reported. 
At least one TEAE was reported for 35 (72.9%) of the subjects who received cirap arantag 
following UFH:  three subjects (37.5%) who received 60 mg ciraparantag, six subjects 
(75.0%) who received 120 mg ciraparantag, six subjects (75.0%) who received 180 mg ciraparantag, six  subjects (75.0%) who received 240 mg ciraparantag following UF H, six 
subjects (75.0%) who received 300 mg ciraparantag, all eight subjects (100.0%) who received 360 mg ciraparantag and these were all considered related to the study drug by the investigator; and seven subjects (87.5%) who received 240 mg ciraparantag without UFH.  At least one TEAE was reported for two subjects (16.7%) who received placebo following UFH – one of them was considered related to the study drug, and one subject  (50.0%) who received placebo without UFH (not related). 
The most common TEAE, feeling hot, was reported for a total of 20 subjects (41.7%) who received ciraparantag following UFH and for two subjects (25.0%) who received 240 mg ciraparantag without UFH.  All of these events were transient and considered to be mild and related to cira parantag by the Investigator.  No event of feeling hot was 
reported for subjects who received placebo.  
All TEAEs were considered to be mild in severity by the Investigator. 
No safety concerns or notable differences were observed in safety laboratory, vital  signs, 
pulse oximetry, ECG, telemetry, and fecal occult blood assessments, when comparing 
active treated cohorts or comparing active treated cohorts and placebo.

PER977-01-003 was a single-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential group, ascendi ng 
ciraparantag repeating -dose study in healthy volunteers who received a single 
subcutaneous (sc) injection of enoxaparin 1.5 mg/kg.  Four dose cohorts of ciraparantag 
(60 mg, 120 mg, 180 mg, and 4 x 15 mg ciraparantag, respectively [100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg and 4 x 25 mg ciraparantag acetate, respectively]) were tested.  In Cohort 1 to 3, additional doses of study drug were allowed in subjects randomized to ciraparantag if PD assessments (WBCT and aPTT) were >120% of baseline value following evaluation of the 60 minute post study drug WBCT assessment.  For the purposes of analysis, subjects with percent of baseline WBCT at the pre- study drug time point ≤120% (i.e.≤20% 
increase following enoxaparin) were considered enoxaparin non-responders and were excluded from PD assessments.  
A total of 40 subjects were enrolled (32 to ciraparantag and 8 to placebo) and completed the study.  In Cohorts 1- 3 (ciraparantag 60 mg, 120 mg, and 180 mg [ciraparantag acetate 
100 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg]) the most commonly AE was flushing, reported in 10 subjects:2 subjects (25%) who received 60 mg ciraparantag (100 mg ciraparantag acetate), 3 subjects (37.5%) who received 120 mg ciraparantag (200 mg ciraparantag acetate), and 5 subjects (50%) who received 180 mg ciraparantag (300 mg ciraparantag acetate).  Flushing was considered study drug-related in 1 subject (12.5%) who received 60 mg ciraparantag (100 mg ciraparantag acetate) and in all of the subjects who received 120 mg and 180 mg ciraparantag (200 mg and 300 mg ciraparantag acetate) who reported flushing.  Other TEAEs reported by the investigator as study drug related were feeling hot and throat tightness (ciraparantag 60 mg [ciraparantag acetate 100 mg]), chills and facial pain (ciraparantag 120 mg [ciraparantag acetate 200 mg] ), and chills and dysgeusia 
(ciraparantag 180 mg [ciraparantag acetate 300 mg]).

percent of baseline E min (0-6h) were observed with single dose ciraparantag 160 mg to

Com plete reversal of enoxaparin anticoagulation, measured as WBCT response, was 
achieved at a single- dose level of 60 mg ciraparantag (100 mg ciraparantag acetate) or 
higher.  Administration of a single-dose of 60 mg ciraparantag (100 mg ciraparantag acetate)  or above had better reversal of enoxaparin anticoagulation effect than the 15 mg

1.2.4 PER977-02-001 
PER977-02-001 was a randomized single-blind sequential group ascending ciraparantag reversal dose stud y in healthy volunteers who received a single dose of 60 mg edoxaban 
in the morning on Days 1-4 followed on Day 3 and Day 4 by a single IV dose of study drug.  Five dose cohorts of 15 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg, 180 mg, and 360 mg ciraparantag (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 300 mg, and 600 mg ciraparantag acetate), respectively were planned and completed.  Any subject who did not have a minimum increase in WBCT of 25% above baseline at the pre-study drug time point on Day 3 was discontinued from the study and replaced.   
The pharmacokinetic results show that following 10- minute IV injection of ciraparantag 
on Day 3 and Day 4, serum PER977 C
max were typically observed at 0.25 hour (i.e., at the 
first postdose time point measured five minutes after the end of the 10- minute inje ction).  
Ciraparantag was then rapidly eliminated, with mean half -life (t 1/2) ranging from 0.207 to 
0.336 hour (12.4 to 20.2 minutes).  Clearance and volumes of distribution remained 
relatively constant across most doses and on both Days 3 and 4.  Over the 24 -fold dose 
range from 15 mg to 360 mg, ciraparantag C max and total exposures ( AUC (0-inf) and 
AUC (0-last)) increased approximately proportionally to the dose increase.  However, the 
Ciraparantag  Perosphere Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: PER977 -02-012 02May2019 
 
Confidential  Page 43 of 97 90% confidence interval (CI) of the slope for Day 4 AUC (0-last) were completely above the 
predefined (0.9298, 1.0702) critical region; and the upper bounds of the 90% CI of the 
slopes for other exposure parameters on Day 3 and Day 4 were just above the upper limit of the critical region.  Dose -proportionality thus could not be statistically concluded.  
Quantifiable concentrations of BAP were measured in serum as early as at the first time 
point, five minutes after the end of ciraparantag 10-minute injection, and C
max was 
reached between 0.42  hour to 0.92 hour after the start of injection.  Elimination of BAP 
was slower than that of ciraparantag and, the mean t 1/2 of BAP ranged from 0.527 to 1.76 
hours.  Available data on Day 3 suggested an increase in t 1/2 at the 360 mg dose level 
compared to lower ciraparantag doses.  M olar rati os of BAP/ciraparantag exposures 
ranged from 0.279 to 0.414 for C max and from 0.538 to 2.49 for total exposures.  With 
ciraparantag administration over the 24-fold dose range, more than proportional increases in serum BAP C
max and total exposures were observed.  The slope estimates  for C max and 
total exposures over the 24- fold dose range were 12% to 48.3% higher than unity and the 
corresponding 90% CIs were completely above the predefined critical region for dose proportionality.   
Urine recovery of ciraparantag dose as unchanged ciraparantag was negligible.  Over the 
12-hour collection interval, the mean overall fraction of dose excreted in urine for analyte over a 12-hour collection (f
e(0-12)) was 0.0377% or less of administered dose.   
The metabolite BAP was excreted in the urine within the first zero to four hour collection interval in most subjects; and overall, mean f
e(0-12) ranged from 0.886% to 17.7%.  More 
than dose proportional amount of BAP was recovered in the urine.  The mean renal clearance (CL
r) increased with escalating doses, and ranged from 1.38 L/h at the 15 mg 
dose level to 9.02 L/h at the 360 mg dose level.  The mean CL r at the 360 mg dose level 
(9.41 L/h) was comparable to the 180 mg dose level.   
Administration of ciraparantag at doses from 15 mg to 360 mg 3 hours after edoxaban 
dosing had no apparent impact on the PK of edoxaban and D21-2393.  Serum profiles and exposures of edoxaban and D21-2393 and recovery of edoxaban in the urine across all PER977 treatments were similar to the place bo group. 
The pharmacodynamics results show that at pre-study drug on Day 3, mean observed WBCT after edoxaban dosing increased to similar levels in the placebo group and ciraparantag treatments.  Over the one to six hours postdose interval (inclusive) aft er the 
first ciraparantag dose, complete reversal for WBCT was achieved in a higher percentage of subjects in the active treatments (82.9% for all doses) compared to the placebo group (60.0%).  Across the 30 mg ciraparantag to 360 mg PER977 treatments, the rate of complete reversal at 30 mg was slightly lower (62.5%) while the rate was similar for 60 mg or higher dose levels (88.9% to 100%).  Both evaluable subjects (100%) in the 15 mg PER977 treatment had partial reversal.  None of the subject s in any of the placebo or 
active treatments had percent -of-baseline WBCT >190% at any time point (i.e., no 
reversal).

second ciraparantag  dose on Day 4, the rates of complete reversal were comparable to

the placebo or active treatments had percent -of-baseline WBCT >190% at any time point 
(i.e., no reversal). 
Treatment comparisons of percent-of- baseline WBCT showed lower values compared to 
placebo following 60 mg to 360 mg cira parantag on Day 3 that were statistically 
significant at most time points between five minutes to three hours after the end of 
injection (geometric least-squares [LS] ratios ranged from 86.52% to 93.70%); and following 30 mg to 360 mg c iraparantag on Day 4 at most time points between five 
minutes to six hours after the end of injection (geometric LS ratios ranged from 84.91% to 95.71%).  On both study days, WBCT at different dose levels in the active ciraparantag treatments returned to baseline within the 0 .083-hour to 0.75-hour time points.  
Post- baseline WBCT in placebo -treated subjects did not decrease to baseline level until 
the 1 -hour (Day 4) to 1.5-hour (Day 3) post-study drug time point. 
Secondary evaluations of ciraparantag effects on whole blood PoC-PT compared to placebo were performed for both Day 3 and Day 4.  On both days, none of the subjects in the placebo or ciraparantag  treatments had complete reversal.  The rates of partial 
reversal across all ciraparantag  treatments were lower than placebo on Day 3 (25.7% 
versus 40.0%), and higher than placebo on Day 4 (45.7% versus 26.7%).  There were no statistically significant differences between ciraparantag  treatments and placebo for 
maximum and minimum percent -of-baseline PoC -PT (maximum value [E
max], minimum 
value [E min], and E min over the partial six -hour interval post study drug [ ciraparantag  or 
placebo] [E min(0 -6h)]), except for E max of 100 mg ciraparantag  on Day 4 (LS ratio of 
85.19%).  A trend for time to reach minimum value achieved earlier in the ciraparantag  
treatments compared to placebo was observed; in which the differences were statistically significant for the time of the minimum value ( tE
min) at 360 mg ciraparantag dose level 
on Day 3 (LS difference of -0.7500 h) and tE min at 30  mg PER977 dose level on Day 4 
(LS difference of -3.705 hours).   
For other secondary endpoints, there were no statistically significant differences versus 
placebo in most comparisons for observed and percent-of- baseline values D -dimer, F1.2, 
and TFPI. 
Results of ex posure- response assessments showed statistically significant differences for 
tEmin achieved earlier with increasing ciraparantag  Cmax (i.e., negative slopes) on Day 3.

Confidential  Page 45 of 97 There were no statistically significant correlations on Day 4.  Similar results were se en 
for BAP.  
Safety analyses showed no deaths or serious AEs were reported during the study.  One 
subject with an AE leading to study discontinuation (due to migraine) was reported 
There was an increase in the number of subjects who reported at least one 
treatment  emergent AE with an increase in the dose of ciraparantag administered  
No relevant trends were observed over time in the mean and median laboratory values between active- treated cohorts and between active -treated cohorts and placebo 
No notable diffe rences were noted in pulse oximetry, ECGs, telemetry, or fecal occult 
blood assessments, when comparing active treatment groups or comparing active treatment groups and placebo. 
In summary, PER977-02-001 concluded the following: 
• Serum ciraparantag C max and total exposures increased in an approximately 
proportional manner for escalating doses from 15 mg to 360 mg; with no dose 
dependent changes in systemic clearance and volume of distribution. 
• BAP is a major metabolite of ciraparantag that exhibits elimination rate limited 
kinetics.  
• Serum BAP C max and total exposures increased more than proportionally to 
ciraparantag doses over the 15 mg to 360 mg range. 
• Fractions of the ciraparantag dose recovered in the urine as BAP and CL r increased 
with escalating doses.  
• Administration of ciraparantag three hours after edoxaban dosing had no apparent impact on the PK of edoxaban and D21-2393. 
• The integrated PD results suggest an anticoagulation reversal effect, as measured by WBCT, at 60 mg ciraparantag dose or above. 
• Single-dose administration of ciraparantag had no impact on re-anticoagulation 
with edoxaban. 
• There were no statistically significant differences versus placebo for any of the analytes (D -dimer, F1.2, and TFPI) measured to detect procoagulation signal. 
• Escalat ing IV doses of ciraparantag (15 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg, 180 mg, and 360 mg) 
administered three hours after a 60 mg edoxaban administration were considered 
well tolerated in the study population.

In PER977-01- 001, c iraparantag and its primary metabolite, 1,4- Bis(3 -aminopropyl) 
piperazine ( BAP ), demonstrate dose-proportional response both with respect to maximal 
concentration (C max) and half- life (t ½).  When administered alone, at the lowest dose of 
ciraparantag administered, 3 mg  (5 mg ciraparant ag acetate), the average C max was 
approximately 172 ng/mL ciraparantag in serum and the average t ½ was approximately 
12 minutes.  At the highest ciraparantag dose analyzed, 180 mg (300 mg ciraparantag 
acetate), the average C max was approximately 10704 ng/m L in serum and the average t ½ 
was approximately 17 minutes ( Figure 3).

3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a randomized, single-blind, placebo- controlled assessment of the efficacy and 
safety of ciraparantag administered to healthy volunteers measur ing clotting times using 
WBCT .  All subjects will undergo screening up to 36 days prior to enrollment.  
Random ization will take place on Day 3  after administration of rivaroxaban .  Subjects 
will be enrolled sequentially into up to four cohorts. 
If the Screening visit takes place within 3 week prior to check-in, the check-in procedures 
may be modified to exclude redundant procedures at the discretion of the Investigator.  There will be a safety review after completion of treatment in one cohort and initiation of treatment in the subsequent cohort. 
Subjects (n=16 per cohort) will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive ciraparantag or 
placebo (saline for injection). Figure 6 depicts the experimental design . 
Figure 6:  Study Schema  
 
Throughout the protocol, “study dr ug” will refer to randomized treatment with 
ciraparantag or placebo.  T he active study drug doses are expressed as active drug 
substance ( ciraparantag).   
The administered dose is based on a concentration of 6 mg/mL ciraparantag and translates to the follo wing dose conversions:  
Ciraparantag Acetate  Ciraparantag  Dose Volume  
600 mg 360 mg  60 mL  
300 mg 180 mg  30 mL  
100 mg 60 mg 10 mL  
50 mg 30 mg 5 mL  
25 mg 15 mg 2.5 mL  
All subjects will receive a single dose of  20 mg rivaroxaban  in the morning on Days 1-3.  
Study drug will be administered only to those subjects who have a minimum increase in clotting time of 25% (as measured by WBCT ) above Day 3 pre- rivaroxaban levels at the 
pre-study drug time point on Day 3 (i.e., 3.75 hours post rivaroxaban ).  Any subject who 
does not have a minimum increase in clotting time of 25% above Day 3 pre -rivaroxaban 
levels  at the pre -study drug time point on Day 3 will be discontinued from the study and 
replaced.  A t 4 hours following rivaroxaban  a single IV dose of study dru g (ciraparantag 
or placebo) will be administered.

Confidential  Page 51 of 97 Individual subjects may only participate in one dose cohort of this study.  Any subject 
who discontinues prior to completion for reasons other than an AE will be replaced and the replacement subject will receive the same treatment as the original subject.  Subjects who discontinue due to an AE that precedes administration of study drug may be replaced at the discretion of the Sponsor.  Only those subjects who discontinue due to AEs that follow administration of study drug (ciraparantag or placebo) will not be replaced.  
3.2 Dose Rationale 
A total of four dosing cohorts (Cohorts 1-4) are planned.  The planned doses of ciraparantag or placebo (administered as a volume equivalent of ciraparantag) have been 
evaluated as single and repeat IV doses from  5 mg ciraparantag acetate (3 mg 
ciraparantag) up to 600 mg ciraparantag acetate (360 mg ciraparantag ) in previous 
protocols (PER977-01-001, PER977-01-002, PER977-01-003, and PER977-02-001).  All 
doses of study drug will be administered by IV injection over a minimum of 10 minutes. 
3.3 Study Duration and Dates 
Expectation of the total duration of the study is approximately 3 months.  Individual subject participation is approximately 50 days inclusive of screening and follow-up.  Subjects enrolled will spend up to four nights admitted to an in- patient facility.

The following dosage forms will be provided for this study: 
• Ciraparantag for IV injection  
• Placebo for IV injection  
• Rivaroxaban  20 mg tablets (commercial formulation  Xarelto®, Baye r/Janssen ) for 
oral administration  
All doses of study drug (ciraparantag or placebo) will be administered by IV injection 
(over a minimum of 10 minutes) e.g. 60 mg ciraparantag (1 0 ml) will be administered at a 
rate of approximately 1 mL/min and  360 mg  (60 ml ) will be administered at a rate of 
approximately 6  mL/min into an indwelling catheter that is not attached to an IV solution 
and will not result in dilution of the study drug.  The indwelling catheter will be flushed with 5.0 mL of sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP before and  after 
administration of study drug.  All doses of study drug will be administered in a single -
blinded-fashion. 
5.2 Treatments Administered 
5.2.1 Ciraparantag  
The investigational drug product is a sterile, isotonic, pH neutral solution for injection containing 6 mg/mL ciraparantag ( 10 mg/mL ciraparantag acetate)  + 6.4 mg/mL sodium 
chloride to be administered by IV injection. 
(See the Ciraparantag Investigator Brochure for complete description of the chemical 
structure)  
5.2.2 Placebo  
Steri le 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP will be administered as the placebo in the 
same method as ciraparantag . 
5.2.3 Rivaroxaban  
All doses of rivaroxaban  (trade name Xarelto
®; Bayer/Janssen ) will be administered  in an 
open-label manner. The ingestion of rivaroxa ban tablets will be witness ed by clinical site 
personnel. Rivaroxaban  20 mg administered once  daily as a single oral tablet for  three  
consecutive days is a standard, FDA approved dose and is considered safe and well -
tolerated in this population.

Confidential  Page 56 of 97 5.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Volunteer Subject 
The doses of ciraparantag utilized in this study were selected based on the cl inical 
findings in PER977-01-001.   
The 20 mg dose for rivaroxaban  is the most common and FDA approved dose considered 
safe and wel l-tolerated in this population. 
All doses of rivaroxaban  will be administered in an open-label manner.  All doses of 
study drugs ( ciraparantag or placebo) will be administered in a single- blind manner 
(study site personnel performing coagulation testing an d subjects will be blinded).   
5.4 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups 
The Investigator will identify all subjects who will meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria 
and who will be enrolled in the study.  Subjects will be enrolled in cohorts of 16 su bjects 
each and will be sequentially assigned Randomization Numbers 1001 to 1016 prior to 
dosing of study drug on Day 3, after confirmation of eligibility .  The next 16 such 
subjects will be enrolled in Cohort 2, and will be sequentially assigned Randomization Numbers 2001 to 2016.  This method of assignment will continue through all four cohorts.  Replacement subjects, if applicable will be assigned the same treatment, using the number of the withdrawing subject +100 (e.g. if subject 1001 withdraws, the replacement subject would be 1101).  
The assignment of treatment will be based on Randomization Schedules to be generated by the CRO .  Each cohort will have a different, independently generated randomization 
schedule.  
5.5 Blinding 
This is a single -blind study in which the subjects will be blinded to treatment of the study 
drug (ciraparantag or placebo) and the study personnel assigned to conducting coagulation testing must be blinded as well.  
5.6 Concomitant Therapy 
Use of concomitant medications (including vitamin,  nutritional and herbal supplements) 
is prohibited as per Exclusion criteria, during screening and for the course of the study.  Acetaminophen up to 1 gram/24 hours may be administered for management of AEs at the discretion of the Investigator. As needed use of over-the- counter antihistamines is 
permitted following screening and prior to admission on Day -1 and following discharge from the clinical site on Day 4.   Use of hormonal contraceptives is acceptable except for 
oral contraceptives .

All study drug will be administered by clinical site personnel by IV injection over a 
minimum of 10 minutes into an indwelling catheter that is not attached to an IV s olution 
and will not result in dilution of the study drug.  Following administration of the study drug, the indwelling catheter will be flushed with 5.0 mL of sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. 
All doses of rivaroxaban  will be administered after breakfast with 240 ml of water under 
the supervision of clinical site personnel.  The ingestion of all doses of rivaroxaban will 
be witnessed by clinical site staff. A mouth and hand check of all subjects will be carried 
out to ensure that the tablets have been swallowed. 
5.9 Dose Escalation/De-Escalation 
Review of  pharmacodynamic,  AEs, clinical laboratory tests, and ECG data will be 
conducted by a group that includes the Principal Investigator, Medical Monitor(s), and 
representative(s) of the Sponsor.  The group will be responsible for the decision to expand a given dose cohort, escalate (or de- escalate) to a different dose from the planned 
dose, or stop the study. All meetings will be documented with minutes.   
The goal of the study is to explore the dose rang e of ciraparantag that reverses the 
anticoagulation induced by therapeutic doses of rivaroxaban at steady state. The study is 
intended to establish a dose of ciraparantag that fully reverses steady -state rivaroxaban, to 
evaluate at least one dose above the reversal dose to establish a therapeutic index, and at least one partial or no effect dose.

6.9 Adverse Events Assessments 
A
ll AEs a nd SAEs w ill be  captured b y electronic data capture ( EDC). 
All AE
s occurring after t he subject signs  the ICF up  to the  time of  the Follow -up phone 
call, whethe
r observed by t
he Investigator or reported by the subject, will be captured.  If 
in the opinion of the Investigator or the sponso
r, an AE meets t he criteria of an S AE it  is 
to be reported.  SAEs occurring up to 30 calendar days post treatment should be reported. 
Any AEs and SAEs that occur after the specifie d reporting period should also be repor ted 
if in the opinion of the investigator , there is a reasonable possibility  for a causal 
association with the study produ
ct.  
Medical conditions (including laboratory values/vital signs that are out of range) that 
were diagnosed or know n to exist prior to Informed Consent will be recorded as part of 
medical history.  All SAEs are to be reported according to the procedures in Section 
6.9.10  SAE Reporting-Procedure for Investigators.  Report diagnosis as the AE or SAE 
term; when the diagnosis is unavailable
, report signs and symptoms as individual entries 
of AE or SAE until the diagnosis becomes available.  For events that are serious due to 
hospitalization, the reason for hospitalization must be reporte d as the serious adverse 
event (diagnosis or symptom requiring hospitalization).  A procedure is not an AE or 
Ciraparantag  Perosphere Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: PER977 -02-012 02May2019 
Confidential  Page 67 of 97 SAE, but the reason for the procedure may be an AE or SAE.  Pre-planned (prior to 
signing the Informed Consent Form) procedure or treatment requiring hospitalization for 
pre-existing conditions which do not worsen in severity should not be reported as S AEs.  
For deaths, the unde rlying or immediate cause of death should always be reported as an 
SAE.  I n addition, any serious, untoward event that may occur subsequent to the 
reporting pe riod that the Investigator  assesses as r elated t o study d rug should al so be 
reporte d and managed as a
n SAE. 
At each vi sit, the Invest
igator will de termine whether an y  AEs have occurred b y 
evaluati
ng the subject.  Adverse events may be directly observed, reporte d spontaneously 
by the subject or by quest
ioning the subject at each study visit.  Subjects should be 
questioned in a general way, without asking about the occur rence of any specific 
symptoms.  All abnormal laboratory values must be appraised by the Investigator as to 
clinical significance.  All abnormal labor atory va lues cons idered cl inically significant  by 
the Investigator must be recorded as an AE on the CRF, and if serious, reported as an 
SAE following the procedures in Section 6.9.10 . 
Investigator should follow subjects with AEs until the event has resolved or the condition 
has stabilized.  In case of unresolved AEs including significant abnormal laboratory 
values at the end of study assessment, these events will be followed until resolution or 
until they be come c linically not  relevant. 
6.9.1 Clinical Laboratory Abn
ormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as 
Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events 
Laboratory abnormalities are usually not recorde d as AEs or SAEs.  However, laboratory 
abnormalities ( e.g., clinical chemistry, he matology, a nd urinalysis) tha t requir e medical 
or surgical intervention or lead to study drug discontinuation must be recorded as an AE, 
as well as an S AE, i f applicable.  In addition, laboratory or other abnormal assessments 
(e.g., ECG or vital signs) that are associated wit h signs and/or symptoms mus t be 
recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet the definition of an AE (or SAE) as described in 
Section 6.9.3 and Section 6.9.4 , respectively.  For AEs associated with laboratory 
abnormalities, the event should be graded on t
he basis of the clinical severity in the  
context of the unde rlying conditions; this may or may not be in agreement with the 
grading of the laboratory abnormali
ty. 
6.9.2 Toxicity Management  
Sub
ject safety will be monitored closely. All clinically significant treatment -emergent 
AEs (TEAEs ) denoted by the Investigator will be brought to the attention of the 
Perosphere medical monitor. All subjects experiencing a TEAE must be monitored 
periodically until symptoms subside or until there is a satisfactory explanation for the AE. Additionally, treatment -emergent abnormal laboratory values should be monitored 
periodically until the abnormality resolves, returns to baseline levels, or is otherwise explained.  At the discretion of the Investigator, assessments and/or clinic visits in 
Ciraparantag  Perosphere Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: PER977 -02-012 02May2019 
Confidential  Page 68 of 97 addition to those scheduled for routine study conduct may be warranted to properly 
monitor the AE or laboratory abnormality. All questions regarding toxicity management 
should be directed to the Perosphere medical monitor. 
6.9.3 Adverse Event (AE)  
An A E is any unt owar d medic al oc currence i n a subject o r clinical i nvestigation s ubject 
administered a pharmaceutica l produc t and whic h does not ne cessaril y have to have a 
causa l relationship with thi s treatment.  An A E can therefor e be an y unf avorabl e and 
unintended sign (includi ng an abnorma l laborator y finding, fo r example), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to  the medicinal product (ICH E2A Guideline, Cl inical Safety Data 
Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Oct 1994). 
It is the responsibi
lity of Investigators, based on thei r know ledge and experience, to 
de
termine, thos e circumstance s or abnorma l lab finding s which should be considered 
adver
se events. 
6.9.4 Seri ous A dvers e Event (SAE) 
Any unt oward m edical oc currence t hat at an y dose: 
•Results in death,
•Is life -threatening,
•Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,
•Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,
•Is a congenital anomaly/b irth defect, or
•Is an impor tant medical event
Note: The term “life -threatening” in the defini tion of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might h ave caused death if it were more severe ( ICH E2A Guideline,  
Cl
inical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, 
Oct 1994). 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize 
the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  Examples include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, and blood 
dyscrasias or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

Confidential  Page 69 of 97 6.9.5 AE Severity  
The following definitions should be used to assess intensity of adverse events: 
Mild: Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated, i.e., does not interfere with 
subject’s usual function. 
Moderate: Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity.  
Severe: Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity, i.e., interferes 
significantly with subject’s usual function. 
Severity should be distinguished from seriousness. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is classified by the criteria based on the regulatory definitions. An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be classified as serious.  
6.9.6 Causality Assessment  
The Investigator should assess causal relationship between an AE and ciraparantag  and/or 
rivaroxaban  (if administered) on the basis or his/her clinical judgment and the following 
definitions.  The causality assessment should be made based on the available information and can be updated as new information becomes available. 
1 = Related:  
The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug administration, 
and cannot be reasonably explained by the subject’s clinical state or other factors 
(e.g., disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medications). 
The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug administration, 
and is a known reaction to the drug under study or its chemical group, or is 
predicted by known pharmacology. 
2 = Not Related:  
The AE does not follow a reasonable sequence from study product administration, or can be reasonably explained by the subject’s clinical state or other factors (e.g., disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medications). 
6.9.7 Action Taken Regarding the Study Drug  
The following definitions will be used to describe action taken regarding study drug: 
1 = Dose Not Changed: No change in study drug dosage was made. 
2 = Drug Withdrawn: The study product was permanently stopped. 3 = Dose Reduced: The dosage of study product was reduced.

Confidential  Page 70 of 97 4 = Drug Interrupted: The study product was temporarily stopped. 
5 =Dose Increased: The dosage of study product was increased. 
6.9.8 Adverse Event Outcome 
The following definitions will be used to describe AE outcomes: 
1 = Recovered/Resolved  
The subject fully recovered from the AE with no residual effect observed. 
2 = Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae 
The residual effects of the AE are still present and observable.  
Include sequelae/residual effects.  
3 = Not Recovered/Not Resolved 
The AE itself is still present and observable.  
4 = Fatal  
5 = Unknown 
6.9.9 Other Action Taken for Event 
The following definitions will be used to describe other actions taken for an AE:  
1 = None. 
No treatment was required.  
2 = Medication required. 
Prescription and/or OTC medication was required to treat the adverse event. 
3 = Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization required. 
Hospitalization was required or prolonged due to the adverse event, whether or 
not medication was required. 
4 = Other.

Confidential  Page 72 of 97 6.9.12 Pregn ancy  
Pregnancy test will be performed at screening and at visits specified in the protocol. 
Subjects with a positive test at screening or during the study period will be excluded from the study. Women of child- bearing potential will be instructed to practice an acceptable 
method of birth control for the duration of the study. However, if subject becomes pregnant during the study, the pregnancy, in and of itself, is not considered an AE unless there is suspicion that the study medication may have interfered with the effectiveness of 
a contraceptive medication or method. 
Any pregnancy diagnosed during the study, or that the Investigator becomes aware of 
within 30 days after stopping study medication, must be reported by the Investigator to the Sponsor using the  Initial Pregnancy Report Form within 24 hours of awareness . The pregnancy should be followed to term by the Investigator and the 
outcome of all such pregnancies, i.e., spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality, should be reported to the Sponsor using the 
 Pregnancy Outcome Report Form.  
All live births must be followed for a minimum of 8 weeks or to the first well- baby visit 
and information reported using the  Pregnancy Follow-Up Report Form. All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous abortions/miscarriages should be reported as an SAE for the study.  
Elective abortion procedures, without complications, will not be considered as AEs. 
6.10 Concomitant Medication Assessments 
Concomitant medication is defined as any medication other than the trial product that is 
taken during the trial including the screening period. 
Details of all medications must be recorded at trial entry.  Any changes in concomitant 
medications must be recorded at each visit.  
The information collected for each concomitant medication includes dosage, route, start date, stop date or continuing and indication.  Concomitant medications will be summarized and tabulated. 
6.11 Removal of Patients from the Trial or Study Drug  
Any subject who discontinues from the study treatment for any reason will have their study treatment discontinuation recorded.

6.11.1 Withdrawal Procedures  
The subject may withdraw  from the study at any time.  Subjects who become pregnant or 
who develop a condition which contraindicates the use of rivaroxaban  during the course 
of the study will be withdrawn.  The subject may be withdrawn from the study at the 
discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor, if judged non-compliant with study procedures or due to safety concerns.  These criteria include: 
• Unwillingness to continue with the study, or because of unwanted effects due to 
study drug  
• Ingestion of interfering substances at times other than those specified in the protocol during the course of the study or,  
• Intercurrent illness or concomitant medication that, in the Investigator’s judgment, may interfere with the conduct of the study. 
• Study drug will be administered only to those subjects who have a minimum increase in WBCT of 25 % from pre -rivaroxaban level on day 3 at the pre- study 
drug (i.e., 3.75 hours post r ivaroxaban ) time point on Day 3.  Any subject who

Confidential  Page 81 of 97 8 QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE  
The Investigator/investigational site will permit study -related monitoring, audits, 
IRB/IEC  review and regulatory inspections by providing direct access to source 
data/documents.  Direct access includes permission  to examine, analyze, verify, and 
reproduce any records and reports that are important to the evaluation of a clinical study. 
8.1 Monitoring and Inspections 
The study monitor or delegate and regulatory authority inspectors are responsible for 
contacting and visiting the Investigator for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, upon request, inspecting the various records of the study (e.g., case report forms, source data, and other pertinent documents). 
The monitor is responsible for visiting site(s) at re gular intervals throughout the study to 
verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; 
and adherence to ICH/GCP and local regulations on the conduct of clinical research.  The monitor is responsible for inspecting th e case report forms and ensuring completeness of 
the study essential documents.  The monitor should have access to subject medical records and other study- related records needed to verify the entries on the case report 
forms.  
The monitor will communicate d eviations from the protocol, Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOPs), GCP and applicable regulations to the Investigator and the Sponsor and will ensure that appropriate action designed to prevent recurrence of the detected deviations is taken and documented. 
The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems 
detected in the course of these monitoring visits are addressed and documented. 
In accordance with ICH/GCP and the Sponsor’s audit plans, this study may be selected 
for audit by representatives from Perosphere.  Inspection of site facilities (e.g., pharmacy, drug storage areas, laboratories etc.) and review of study related records will occur in 
order to evaluate the study conduct and compliance with the protocol, ICH/GCP, and 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
In the event Perosphere elects to conduct an audit onsite, the CRO  will be notified in 
advance, will be given sufficient time to prepare, and will be given an opportunity to participate in the audit.  
8.2 Data Collection 
Case Report Form (CRF) completion should be kept current to enable the monitor to review the subject’s status throughout the course of the study.  Case Report Form will be completed, reviewed and signed off or e- signed by the Investigator.

Confidential  Page 82 of 97 If the study empl oys paper CRFs, the Investigator will sign and date the indicated places 
on the case report form.  These signatures will indicate that the Investigator inspected or 
reviewed the data on the case report form, the data queries, and the site notifications, and agrees with the content.  
If the study employs EDC, the Investigator e -signs according to the study data flow. 
8.3 Data Management 
All data recorded during the study will be available for audit against source data and for compliance with GCP and specific prot ocol requirements. Monitoring of the study 
progress and conduct will be ongoing.  
 
The Principal Investigator will be responsible for the following: 
1. Monitoring study conduct to ensure that the rights of subjects are protected; 
2. Monitoring study conduct to e nsure trial compliance with GCP guidelines; and  
3. Monitoring accuracy, completion and verification from source documents of 
study data.  
8.4 Study Documentation and Storage 
The Investigator will maintain a Signature List of appropriately qualified persons to 
whom he/she has delegated study duties.  All persons authorized to make entries and/or corrections on case report forms will be included on the Signature List. 
Source documents are original documents, data, and records from which the subject’s 
case report form  data are obtained.  These include but are not limited to hospital records, 
clinical and office charts, laboratory and pharmacy records, diaries, microfiches, X- rays, 
and correspondence. 
Case Report Form entries may be considered source data if the CRF is the site of the 
original recording (i.e., there is no other written or electronic record of data).  In this study, CRF pages may be used as source documents. 
The Investigator and study staff are responsible for maintaining a comprehensive and 
centralized f iling system (Trial Master File  [TMF] ) of all study -related (essential) 
documentation, suitable for inspection at any time by representatives from Perosphere and/or applicable regulatory authorities.  Essential documents include: 
• Subject file s containing completed CRFs, ICFs, and supporting copies of source 
documentation (if kept) 
Ciraparantag  Perosphere Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: PER977 -02-012 02May2019 
 
Confidential  Page 83 of 97 • Study files containing the protocol with all amendments, Investigator’s Brochure, 
copies of relevant essential documents required prior to commencing a clinical 
study, and all correspondence to and from the IRB /IEC  and Perosphere. 
• Records related to the Investigational Product(s) including acknowledgment of 
receipt at site, accountability records and final reconciliation and applicable 
correspondence 
• In addition, all original source documents supporting entries in the case report 
forms must be maintained and be readily available. 
8.5 Record Keeping 
Records of subjects, source documents, monitoring visit logs, data correction forms, 
CRFs, inventory of study product, regulatory documents (e.g., protocol and amendments, IRB/EC correspondence and approvals, approved and signed informed consent forms, Investigator’s Agreement, clinical supplies receipts, distribution and return records), and other sponsor correspondence pertaining to the study must be kept in appropriate study files at the site.  Source documents include all recordings and observations or notations of clinical activities and all reports and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical study.  These records will be retained in a secure file for the period required by the institution or site policy.  Prior to transfer or destruction of these records Perosphere must be notified in writing and be given the opportunity to further store such records. 
8.6 Document Retention 
All essential documentation will be retained by the Investigator until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 2 years have lapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product.  These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreem ent with the sponsor.  It is the 
responsibility of the sponsor to inform the Investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. 
No study document should be destroyed without prior written agreement between 
Perosphere and the Investigator.  Should the Investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to another location, he/she must notify Perosphere in writing of the new responsible person and/or the new location.

9.1 General Considerations 
All data collected will be presented in data listings.  Data from subjects excluded from an 
analysis set will be presented in the data listings, but not included in the calculation of summary statistics.  For categorical variables, frequencies, and percentages will be presented.  Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum).  Data will be tabulated by treatment, across active treatment groups when applicable, with all placebo subjects pooled into a single group. 
All evaluable data from subjects in the analysis sets will be included in the analyses.  No 
adjustment or imputation will be utilized for missing values or for subjects who withdraw prior to completing the study, neither will analyses be restricted to subjects with complete 
data.  
Baseline values will be defined as the last assessment prior to investigational product administration and per period if applicable. 
Details of all statistical analys es will be specified in a separate statistical analysis plan 
(SAP)  that will be finalized prior to database lock . 
9.2 Determination of Sample Size  
The study population will consist of healthy male and female adults, age 50-75 years 
(inclusive).  No forma l sample size calculations were performed for this study; sixteen  (16) subjects 
enrolled in each cohort (3:1; active: placebo) is  considered an adequate number of 
subjects to achieve the objectives of the study . 
9.3 Analysis Populations  
The safety analysis set will include all subjects who receive at least 1  administration of 
investigational product.  This set will be used for all safety, demographic, subject and 
disposition summaries.  
The PD analysis set will include all subjects who receive at least 1  administration of 
investigational product, and provide at least one on- treatment WBCT  measurement 
without protocol deviations with potential to affect these measurements. This set will be used for all PD analyses.  
The PK analysis set will include all subjects wh o receive at least 1  administration of 
study drug, and provide sufficient data to estimate at least one PK parameter without 
protocol deviations with potential to affect these measurements. This set will be used for all PK analyses.

9.5 Plasma Rivaroxaban Pharmacokinetics 
Blood samples for determination of rivaroxaban plasma concentrations will be obtained 
at specified times before and up to 28 hours following dose administration of 
rivaroxaban . PK parameters will include C max, Tmax, AUC (0-last), t½, Kel, CL/F and Vz/F, 
if data allow. R ivaroxaban pharmacokinetics will be evaluated by comparison of main 
pharmacokinetic parameters on Day 1 and Day 3. 
9.6 Dose Proportionality  
The dose proportionality of exposure PK parameters for PER977 and BAP (AUC (0-inf),  
AUC (0-last), and C max), over the ad ministered dose range will be investigated using the 
following power model:  
log (PK parameter) = a + b * log (dose)  
where ‘a’ is the intercept and ‘b’ is the slope.  
Dose proportionality will be assessed graphically and stat istically using the above power 
model approach with the logarithm of PK parameters as the dependent variables and the logarithm of the dose as the independent variable for subj ects who receive one dose at a 
given dose interval. The intercept (a) and the slope (b) together with their 90% CI will be 
estimated and presented for each PK parameter. Parameters ‘ a’ and ‘b’ will be estimated 
using an ordinary least -squares approach or the equivalent. Dose proportionality will be 
declared if  the 90% CI for the slope parameter ‘b’ lies entirely wi thin the critical region 
(0.7968, 1.203) using the maximal d ose ratio I = 3 (highest dose/lowest dose), a lower 
equivalence limit of 0.80, and an upper equivalence limit of 1.25. 
Additionally, the geometric means for the primary PK parameters between adjacent dose 
levels will be compared using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model including dose, gender and weight as fixed effect s for subjects who receive one administration a t a 
given dose interval. Geometric mean ratios for adjacent adm inistrations (hig her

Confidential  Page 87 of 97 dose/lower dose) and corresponding 90% CI will be presented. PER977 and BAP 
exposure parameters (C max, AUC (0-inf), and AUC (0-last)) will be plotted versus dose on 
linear and log -log scales for subjects who receive one administration at a  given dose level 
using a scatterplot with individual exposures, regression line and corresponding confidence bands. 
9.7 Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
The contract research organization ’s ( .) SOPs  and Work 
Instructions will be used as the default me thodology if not otherwise specified.  All PD 
computations will be performed using Phoenix® WinNonlin® 6.3, or SAS® Version 9.2 
(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).  Graphics will be prepared with SAS® 
Version 9.2 or SigmaPlot® 12.5.  Actual times will be used in the PD analyses.  
The PD endpoint will be WBCT.   
PD endpoint will be summarized at  observed time  points and change and/or ratio from 
baseline values using descriptive statistics and graphical presentations.  Data handling for PD measurement s below the limit of quantitation ( BLQ ) will be  
specified in  the SAP .  In the actual analysis, BLQ values will be set to the lower limit of 
quantitation ( LLOQ ) for PD data summaries and calculations.   
Change- from -baseline and percent -of-baseline will be calculated for all PD endpoints.  
Baseline for all PD endpoints will be defined as the pre- rivaroxaban sample 
(approximately four hours before PER977 or placebo administration on Day 3).  
The anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban will be evaluated by comparing  WBCT measured 
at pre-PER977 (about four hours post-rivaroxaban on Day 3) versus baseline (pre-
rivaroxaban on Day 3).  For the purposes of the PD analyses, subjects with percent-of-baseline WBCT at pre -PER977 <125% (i.e.,  <25% increase) will be considered as 
rivaroxaban in non- responders and excluded from all PD summaries and assessments.  
Listings of individual PD variable collection times, as well as derived sampling time deviations (where applicable), will be provided. 
Individual observed and baseline- adjusted values at scheduled time points and PD 
parameters will be listed and summarized by treatment. In addition, the nature of reversal 
of anticoagulation ( no effect, partial reversal, complete or complete and sustained) based 
on the definition of reversal of anticoagulation below using WBCT will be listed for each subject and summarized.

Confidential  Page 88 of 97 9.8 Analysis of the Primary PD Endpoint (WBCT) 
Definition of Reversal of Anticoagulation  
• Complete reversal is achiev ed for a treatment group if the mean WBCT is ≤ 110% 
of base line at any post -baseline time point up to and including 1 hour following 
test article administration. Complete reversal is achieved for a subject if WBCT is 
≤110% of baseline at any post -baseline time point up to and including 1 hour 
following test article administration.  
• Complete and sustained reversal of anti- coagulation is achieved for a treatment 
group if the mean WBCT is ≤ 115% of baseline at all time points between 1 and 8 hours (inclusive) following test article administration. Complete and sustained reversal of anti -coagulatio n is achieved for a subject if WBCT is ≤ 115% of 
baseline at all time points between 1 and 8 hours (inclusive) following test article administration. 
 
Statistically Significant Complete Reversal  
• Statistically significant comple te reversal, relative to mean placebo WBCT,  is 
defined as p< 0.05, (one tailed) from the comparison of means between treatment 
and placebo at 15, 30, 45 minutes or 1 hour post study drug administration as measured by one- way Analysis of Variance at study completion.  Distribution 
diagnostics will be performed to assure assumptions associated with using ANOVA are met . Analysis of Means (ANOM) methods will be used to compare 
means and variances across groups. These methods will be appropriate to test if any o f the group means are statistically different from the overall mean or if the 
group standard deviations are statistically different from the  root mean square error 
(RMSE). Tukey HSD multiple comparison procedure will be used to test for all pairwise differ ences among the means (Tukey 1953, Kramer 1956). This test is an 
exact alpha- level test if the sample sizes are the same, and conservative if the 
sample sizes are different (Hayter 1984).  
 
9.9 Pharmacodynamic Parameters 
Pharmacodynamic parameters will be calculated for observed and percent-of- baseline 
values using actual times relative to the start of injection of first study drug (PER977 or 
placebo) dose using Phoenix® WinNonlin® 6.3 or SAS® Version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., 
Cary, North Carolina).  All PD para meters will be derived over the time window from the 
first study drug administration (zero hour) to the last collection (i.e., 24 hours after the 
final administration of the study drug).

Confidential  Page 92 of 97 10.4 Ethical Conduct of the Study 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the ethical principles that 
have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, the ICH consolidated Guideline E6 for GCP (CPMP/ICH/135/95), and applicable regulatory requirement(s) and FDA GCP 
Regulations: Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21, parts 11, 50, 54, 56 and 312 as 
appropriate  
10.5 Patient Information and Consent 
Before a subject’s participation in t he study, it is the Investigator or designee’s 
responsibility to obtain freely given consent, in writing, from the subject after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study and before any protocol-spe cific screening procedures or any study drugs are 
administered.  The written ICF must be prepared in the local language(s) of the potential subject population. 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the Investigator or designee must 
comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, and must adhere to GCP and to the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  The consent form and any revision(s) must be approved by the IRB/IEC prior to being provided to potential subjects. 
The subject’s written informed consent must be obtained prior to his/her participation in the study, and must be documented in the subject’s medical records, as required by 21 CFR Part 312.62.  The ICF should be signed and personally dated by the subject, and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion (not necessarily the Investigator).  The original signed ICF must be retained in accordance with institutional policy, and a copy of the signed consent form must be provided to the subje ct or legal 
representative.  The date and time (if applicable) that informed consent was given must be recorded on the CRF. 
If the subject cannot read, then according to ICH/GCP Guideline, Section 4.8.9, an 
impartial witness should be present during the entire informed consent discussion.  This witness should sign the ICF after the subject or the legally acceptable representative has orally consented to the subject’s participation and, if possible, signed the ICF.  By signing the ICF, the witness attests th at the information in the ICF and any other written 
information was adequately explained to and apparently understood by the subject or the legally acceptable representative and that informed consent was freely given by the subject or the legally acceptable representative.  
Additional consent is required for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

Confidential  Page 93 of 97 10.6 Patient Confidentiality 
The Investigators, the Clinical Research Organization (CRO)  and the Sponsor 
(Perosphere)  will preserve the confidentiality of all subjects taking part in the study, in 
accordance with GCP and local regulations.  
The Investigator must ensure that the subject’s anonymity is maintained.  On the CRFs or 
other documents submitted by  the CRO  or Sponsor subjects should be ide ntified by a 
unique subject identifier as de fined  by the sponsor.  Documents that are not for 
submission to other entities  (e.g., signed ICFs) should be kept in strict confidence by the 
Investigator. 
In compliance with US Federal regulations and ICH/GCP Guidelines, it is required that 
the Investigator and institution permit authorized representatives of the company, of the regulatory agency(s), and the IRB /IEC  direct access to review the subject’s original 
medical records for verification of study- related p rocedures and data.  The Investigator is 
obligated to inform the subject that his/her study -related records will be reviewed by the 
above named representatives without violating the confidentiality of the subject. 
10.7 Regulatory Compliance 
The study protocol, subject information and ICF, the Investigator Brochure, any subject diary card or written instructions to be given to the subject, available safety information, subject recruitment procedures (e.g., advertisements), information about payments and compensat ion available to the subjects and documentation evidencing the Investigator’s 
qualifications should be submitted to the IRB/IEC for ethical review and approval according to local regulations, prior to the study start.  The written approval should identify all documents reviewed by name and version. 
Changes in the conduct of the study or planned analysis will be documented in a protocol 
amendment and/or the SAP.  
The Investigator must submit and, where necessary, obtain approval from the IRB/IEC and/or Sponsor for all subsequent protocol amendments and changes to the informed consent document or changes of the investigational site, facilities or personnel.  The Investigator should notify the IRB/IEC of deviations from the protocol or SAEs occurring 
at the site and other AE reports received from the CRO, in accordance with local procedures. 
As required by local regulations, the Sponsor’s local Regulatory Affairs group will insure 
all legal aspects are provided, and approval of the appropriate regulatory bodies obtained, prior to study initiation, and that implementation of changes to the initial protocol and other relevant study documents happen only after the appropr iate notification of or 
approval by the relevant regulatory bodies.

Study data will be recorded using electronic data capture (EDC).   
10.9 Protocol Violations/Deviations 
The Investigator should conduct the study in compliance with the protocol agreed to by 
Perosphere and, if required, by the regulatory authority(ies), and which was given approval/favorable opinion by the IRB/IEC. 
A deviation to any protocol procedure or waiver to any stated criteria will not be allowed 
in thi s study except where necessary to eliminate immediate hazard(s) to the subject.  
Perosphere must be notified of all intended or unintended deviations to the protocol (e.g., inclusion/exclusion criteria, dosing, missed study visits) on an expedited basis. 
The Investigator, or person designated by the Investigator, should document and explain 
any deviation from the approved protocol. 
If a subject was ineligible or received the incorrect dose or investigational treatment, and 
had at least one administration of investigational product, data should be collected for safety purposes. 
The Investigator should notify the IRB /IEC  of deviations from the protocol in accordance 
with local procedures.  
10.10  Financial Disclosure 
Prior to starting the study, the Principal Investigator and/or institution will sign a clinical 
study agreement with Perosphere.  This agreement will include financial information agreed upon by the parties and full financial disclosure (if applicable) and conflict of 
interest on the part of the clinical investigator, sub-investigator, their spouses and dependent children.  
10.11  Publication and Disclosure Policy 
A study site may not publish results of a study without the written permission of Perosphere and provided that Perosphere has had the opportunity to review and approve the study site’s proposed publication prior to its being submitted. 
10.12  Reimbursement, Indemnity, and Insurance  
Reimbursement, indemnity and insurance shall be addressed in a separate agreement on terms agreed upon by the parties.

INTRODUCTION AND RAT IONALE  
Background  
Adipose tissue is a loose type of connective tissue specialized to store lipids. The majority of lipids 
stored in adipose cells are tri glycerides formed from imported free fatty acids and glycerol.  It is 
not uniformly distributed in the body.  The major adipose depot is subcutaneous (about 80% of 
all body fat).1 In men , it normally represents 15 -20% of body weight and in women, 20 -25% of  
body weight.  A certain amount of body fat is necessary for normal female reproduction and 
health. Subcutaneous adipose tissue helps to shape, cushion and insulate the body and provides 
padding to some organs.  
 
Liposuction is a procedure that can help sculpt the body by removing unwanted fat from specific 
areas.2,3,4 The increasing popularity of this procedure is associated with the evolution of 
techniques and equipment for fat removal, body reshaping and cellulite treatments. Besides the 
traditional su ction -assisted lipoplasty, other options include ultrasound -assisted and external 
ultrasound -assisted liposucti on, power -assisted liposuction and laser lipolysis , as well as low -level 
laser -assisted liposculpture.5  
 
The efforts in the search for alternati ve non -invasive or mini mally -invasive techniques and new 
tools aim mainly at reducing downtime  and facilitating treatment for reduction of the localized 
fatty tissue areas.  New minimally -invasive technologies include subcutaneous injection of 
phosphatidyl choline. This drug was initially used in emergencies and in the treatment of atheroma 
plaques in cardiac diseases.  Recently, it has also been used in the treatment of localized fat 
deposits, with mixed reviews.6

The VelaShape device is a commercial device cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
under 510(k) K071872 indicated for the relief of minor muscle aches and pain, relief of muscle 
spasm, temporary improvement of local blood circulation, temporary reduction in the appe arance 
of cellulite, and for temporary reduction of thighs circumferences.  It combines controlled infrared 
(IR) light and conducted bipolar radiofrequency (RF) energies with mechanical manipulation. The 
VelaShape II, the next generation VelaShape, is a CE -cleared device since 2009, which also 
combines controlled infrared  (IR) light and conducted bipolar radiofrequency (RF) energies with 
mechanical manipulation.  The VelaShape II device has 65W RF energy.  
The VelaShape III, the newest generation VelaShape, is a device based on the  CE-cleared 
VelaShape II  and FDA -cleared Transcend device (K120510). All devices combine controlled 
infrared  (IR) light and conducted bipolar radiofrequency (RF) energies with vacuum.  The 
VelaShape III device is indicated for relie f of minor muscle aches and pain, relief of muscle spasm, 
temporary improvement of local blood circulation, temporary reduction in the appearance of 
cellulite, and for temporary reduction of thighs and abdomen circumference.  
The VelaShape III device has 15 0W RF energy.  
 
The UltraShape® Contour I VER 3.1 is a device cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA 
– K133238) and Health Canada (HC). The UltraShape, the next generation of Contour I VER 3.1, is 
a commercial device cleared by the CE, Health Cana da and by the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA – K141708) , which uses focused ultrasound to produce localized mechanical motion within 
fat tissues and cells for the purpose of producing mechanical cellular membrane disruption. It is 
intended for reduction  in abdominal circumference.  The newest generation UltraShape device, 
UltraShape Power, includes a small transducer (U-Sculpt Power) , and is FDA -cleared ( K170370 ) 
for lipolysis (breakdown of fat) to provide a non -invasive approach to achieve a desired aest hetic 
effect. It is intended for non -invasive reduction in abdominal circumference and fat reduction in 
the flanks and thighs.  
 
Device Descriptions  
VelaShape Device  
The newest generation, VelaShape III, is composed of a console to which two applicators, 
VContour  and VSmooth , are connected via an umbilical cable. Each applicator incorporates an 
operation panel to enable the operator remote control of the system  in addition to the system’s 
touch screen operation panel. Prior  to treatment, the  applicators are fitted with a replaceable 
cap, which keeps the skin from coming in to direct contact with the applicator during the 
treatment . These caps can be cleaned between treatments for reuse for the same subject, since 
multiple treatments are typical . During  treatme nt with the VelaShape III device , the applied

suction repeatedly pulls the skin into a chamber in the middle of the cap . There, the  skin is 
exposed to the combined elōs technology (electro optical synergy - IR light and RF) using gentle 
vacuum  suction with  or without mechanical manipulation.   
 
The VSmooth a pplicator contains rotating elements that create a massaging motion. The system 
enables the user to adjust the RF energy, optical energy and vacuum levels, thereby utilizing the 
optimal treatment paramete rs for each subject/anatomical area .

General:  Tissue selectivity is achieved by a proprietary knowledge of ultrasound parameters 
ensuring specific destruction of the fat ce lls only within the target area. All other types of tissue, 
such as blood vessels, muscles and peripheral nerves remain intact. There are no thermal effects. 
Fat cell destruction is achieved by ultrasound -induced mechanical effects during a very short 
expo sure time.  
The Ultrasonic Transducer : The ultrasonic transducer is an electro -mechanical device that 
converts an electrical signal into mechanical (acoustical) energy. Its functionality is based on  
piezoelectric ceramics that has  the property of changing s ize when a voltage is applied. Thus,  
applying an alternating voltage frequency across such piezoelectric element causes it to oscill ate 
in the same frequency, producing sound waves. The spherical shape of that piezoelectric element 
enables the focusing of the ultrasound waves into a narrow focal region , which is the target 
region. The transducer is comprised of a  Polyethylene membrane , which was approved by 
biocompatibility test ing and in vitro and in vivo verification tests.

Pre-Treatment Procedures  
 It is expected that the screening and baseline procedures will be conducted during the same visit 
as the treatment . All visit procedures should take up to 2 hours.  
Screening  
1. ICF - Prior to any study –related activities , informed consent will be obtained.  When the 
subject fully understands the possible benefits and risks of the study, the subject will be 
asked to sign an d date the informed consent form (ICF).  The subject will be given a copy 
of the signed ICF.  
2. Medical History - A medical history will be obtained to determine if the  subject  meet s the 
study criteria, including a list of all prescribed and over -the-counter medications.   
3. Skin Exam - The subject will undergo a routine skin exam to determine if he/she  meet s 
the study criteria including the presence of fatty tissue deposits in the treatment area.   
4. BMI – the volunteers’ height and weight will be taken for calcu lation of BMI.  
5. Pregnancy Screen – female subjects who can become  pregnant will undergo a urine 
pregnancy test. This will be repeated prior to all treatments, and at the end of the study 
(last FU visit).  If the Screening and Treatment procedures are not co nducted on the same 
day, the urine pregnancy test will be repeated on the treatment day.   
6. Scheduling: Subjects will be scheduled to return for the baseline and treatments visit  
within 14 days followi ng the screening visit. It is preferable that the baseli ne procedures 
and Tx.1 will be conducted immediately after the Screening visit .

Baseline  
1. Subject ID - Prior to treatment, subjects will be assigned a study subject number.  
2. Photography – Baseline photographs will be obtained using a digital imaging system  with 
standardized consistent camera  settings . 
3. BMI – the subject weight and height will be taken if baseline visit is a different day than 
the screening visit.  
Measurements  
Measure the Fat Thickness at the Area to be treated   
The procedure can be per formed only in areas where the fat thickness is ≥1.5 cm as measured by 
a skin fold caliper (or ≥3.0 cm  as measured by a pinch test ), and ≥2.5 cm as measured by a skin 
fold caliper  after strapping.  
Marking Area for UltraS hape Power Treatment  
The mark of the area to be treated should be copied to a transparent template (for each side: 
Right and Left ) to ensure consistent marking of the same area for same patient during the 
subsequent visits.  
During copying the treatment area to the transparent template, th e following signs will be marked 
on transparency according to the following table  (Table 4): 
Table 4- Marking the intended area to be treat by UltraShape  
Step  Thigh Treatment  
1 The thigh area will be marked on the transparency. Each thigh (left 
and right) will be marked separately.  
2 Mark the Subject's identification code on the transparency for each 
thigh (left and right) separately . 
3 Define the thigh (right or left) on the transparency.  
Separate transparency for each side . 
 
At the subsequent treatment sessions, this transparent template will be placed according to these 
signs on the treated area , and the line of treatment area will be re -marked.  
Marking height circumference  and circumference measurement   
Patient s should stand  up straight when arms are placed at the rear of the neck and  the head is 
positioned towards the horizon . Elbows will be positioned in front of the body ( Figure 4).

VelaShape - General Treatment Procedure  
1. Ensure that the subject is in a comfortable position for the procedure.  
2. Remove any jewelry in the treatment area . 
3. Ensure that the treatment area skin is clean . The sk in should be cleaned with water and soap , 
and hair  in the treatment area should  be shaved.   
4. Ensure that the treatment applicator/ applicator cap is clean . If not, it should be wipe d with 
70% alcohol and allowed to dry.

5. Prior to treating the entire area, a test should be performed in a small section within the area 
to assess the skin for unwanted affects.  
6. The choice of treatment settings should take into consideration not only the severity of the 
treated condition (fat layer), but also the subject’s skin type, tendency to bruise, the specific 
anatomical location (i.e. thigh ), and comf ort. 
7. There should be a complete seal between the applicator and the skin  during the treatment 
session .  In curved or bony areas , careful  attention is required when treating. A slight change 
in the orientation of the applicator may solve the problem.  
8. Always hold the applicator perpendicular to the skin surface , so that the compression/contact 
with the skin is consistent for each application.  
9. Full operating procedure, software screens and parameters a re described in the device User 
Manuals . Instructions  will be provided prior to the start of the study.  
10. Always hold the applicator so that both electrodes have equal compression/contact with the 
skin to ensure safe and effective RF delivery.  
11. Before the treatment , app ly a thin layer of the commercial VelaEase  treatment lotion 
(Appendix 5).  You may need to re -apply the lotion, if the indicators on the applicator blink 
continuously for more than a few pulses, indicating bad coupling.  
Treatment Using the VContour Applicator  to the Inner  Thigh  
1. Select the appropri ate zone for treatment of circumference reduction using the  
Medium Cover; define the size of the targeted sub -area, large, medium or small,  
And divide it into segments:  
• Large size sub -area (25 x 20 cm) will be divided into 20 segments.  
• Medium size sub -area  (15 x 20cm) will be divided into 12 segments.  
• Small size sub -area (10 x 20 cm) will be divided into 8 segments.  
 
2. Each segment of the sub -area is the size of the Medium Cover (5 x 5cm).

Figure 5: Sub-Area Divided into Segments  
3. Set the following parameters:  
• The target RF level is level “3”.  If safety concerns arise or if the subject reports too 
much pain, use lower RF levels.  
• The target vacuum level start i s “1” gradually increased to level “2” and then to “3” 
over the treatmen t course.  
• In some cases , the skin is very lax and is pulled deep into the treatment chamber of 
the replaceable cap; to prevent adverse effects, use level  vacuum  “1” in these cases.  
The treatment will be performed with the large Vela Shape applicator size (4 5mm x 
25mm) or the  small VelaShape applicator size with the appropriate tip size .  
4. Cycle 1:  
a. Starting with Section A1 to A20, each segment  will undergo  5 consecutive stacking 
pulses  in a “horizontal snake-like” treatment technique (see illustration below) . 
b. After all segments  are pulsed 5 times , another cycle of 4 consecutive pulses, then 
3 consecutive pulses and then 2 consecutive pulses should performed . 
c. Continue treating each sub -area from A1 to A20 with 2 consecutive stacking 
pulse s until the surface temp erature reaches 450C or the patie nt is unable to 
tolerate more heat,  whichever comes first.

temperature ( 450C), then continue  with the “Vertical Snake -Like” treatment  
technique (see Figure s 4-7) and apply  one pu lse per sub -area until the 10 -minute 
treatment duration for all four cycles is  reached.  
 
8. Treatment time: The large size sub -area (25 x 20 cm) set includes 20 segments (A1 -A20), the  
medium size sub -area (15 x 20 cm) set includes 12 segments (A1 -A12) and the  small size sub -
area (10 x 20 cm) set includes 8 segments (A1 -A8). The 3 -4 consecutiv e cycles should take at 
least 12  minutes  (2 minutes to temperature + 10 minutes treatment time at temperature) . 
Treatment Usin g the VSmooth  Applicator  to the Lateral Thigh  
1. Mark treatment areas that are 20 x 25 cm in size. Within each of these areas mark four 
elliptical overlapping segments according to the following illustration below  
 
Figure 8: VSmooth Treatment Area Segmentation  
2. Attach the Large Electrode cover to the VSmooth applicator.  
3. Select treatment parameters on the screen or on the applicator:  
a. IR = 1  
b. RF =3  
c. Vacuum = 1  
4. It is recommended to maintain the RF level at 3 in all cycles to achieve optimal results.  
5. You m ay increase the IR and Vacuum levels from 1 -> 2 -> 3 based on patient tolerance, and 
only in areas with minimal laxity.  
6. Apply a thin, lightly visible layer of VelaSpray Ease lotion at the beginning of each cycle.  
7. Start treating according to Table 6 below.

a. VelaShape III 
b. UltraShape  Power  
2. Clinical effects - All visible and palpable immediate response will be recorded for the 
entire treatment area using a 4 -point severity scale ( Table 9). 
3. Safety aspect s will be assessed before and after each treatment : 
a. Adverse Events – Record t he number, severity and type of any adverse event 
occurring  before, during  and after treatments.  
4. Subject will also be provided with the following instructions for care of the treated areas 
in the informed consent form.  
a. Temporary skin erythema (redness) and edema (swelling), as well as heat and 
tightening sensations , may occur up to a few hours after the treatment, but 
normally do not last longer. If the subject feels significant discomfort longer than 
that time , cool/cold compress (but not ice packs) may be applied for relief. Over - 
the-counter pain medication such as Tylenol may be used.  
b. On the evening after the treatment , subjects should wash the treated areas 
gently with lukewarm water and avoid very hot or cold water in these areas. 
Generally, subjects may use their regular soaps after treatment, as long as these  
are not scrub soaps or exfoliants.  
c. The treated areas should also not be exposed to potential mechanical damage 
(e.g., kickboxing, massage) at least 48 hours post -treatment.  
d. Tanning of any sort (sun exposure, tanning beds, and artificial sunless tanning 
lotions) is not allowed in the treated areas during the entire course of the study 
since it might cause hyperpigmentation.  
e. Subjects will be instructed to use a high factor sunscreen with SPF of at least 30 
and to protect the treated areas from direct sunligh t for the entire period of the 
study.  
Return Visits  
All subjects will be requested to return to the clinic at the following time -points during the study

Protocol Revisions and/or Deviations  
Except for  emergency situations, no chan ges or deviations in the conduct of this protocol will be 
permitted wit hout the prior approval of the Sponsor.  
The IRB/IEC that granted original approval for the study must be notified of all chan ges in the 
protocol, and will approve any chan ge or deviation that may increase risk to the subject, and/or 
that may adversely affect the rights of the subject or  validity of the investigation.  
 
In the event of an emergency, the Investigator will institute any medical procedures deemed 
appropriate. However, all such procedures must be promptly reported to the sponsor and the 
IRB/IEC.  
ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any adverse change in health or side effect that occurs in a study 
participant during their participation in the study.  
Anticipated Adverse Effects  
Following treatment with the  VelaShape III  and/or  UltraShape Power  the following local adverse 
effects could occur (anticipated):  
➢ Purpura   ➢ Hyperpigmentation  
➢ Blister  ➢ Hypopigmentation  
➢ Bruising  ➢ Soreness  
➢ Bullae  ➢ First -degree burn  
➢ Erosion  
➢ Pain  
➢ Damage to natural skin 
structure (scratching, 
crusting)  ➢ Second -degree burn  
➢ Excessive skin redness (erythema)  
➢ Hair removal ( pulling ) 
 
An adverse event (AE) is any undesired clinical occurrence in a study subject as indicated by signs, 
symptoms, illnesses, events that develop or worsen in severity in association with the study when 
deemed by the Investigator to be related to use of the de vice or study procedures. The 
Investigator will document all adverse signs and symptoms regardless of severity or frequency 
that are either volunteered by subjects or observed during the study that are related to the 
device.  The Investigator will also rec ord adverse experiences of subjects resulting from 
concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states that 
the Investigator deems related to the device. Included in the description will be the nature of the 
sign or symptom, the date of onset, whether the event was serious, the severity, the relationship

to study procedures or investigational device, the action taken, the date of resolution, and the 
outcome. The Principal Investigator will determine the relationship o f the adverse device effect 
to the investigational device.  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
For device studies, part 21 CRF 812.3(s)  uses the term unanticipated adverse device effect  which 
is defined as an y serious adverse effect on health or safety or  any life -threatening problem or 
death caused by, or associated with the  device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application 
(including a supplementa ry plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem 
associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.   
Significant device failure may constitute an adverse event if an undesirable experience occurs.  
This definition includes any event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions 
for use or the deployment of the device, or any event that is a result of a user error.  
 
All unanticipated adverse e ffects will be graded as follows:  
Mild:  Sign or symptom, usually transient, non -life-threatening requiring no special 
treatment and generally not interfering with usual activities.  
Moderate:  Sign or symptom, non -life-threatening which may be ameliorated by simple 
therapeutic measures, and may i nterfere with usual activity.  
Major:  Sign or symptom that is intense or debilitating but non -life-threatening and 
that interferes with usual activities. Recovery is usually aided by 
therapeutic measures and the discontinuation of the study device may be 
required.  
Severe:  Any untoward medical occurrence that at any time results in death or life -
threatening illness, resulting in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.   
 
The relationship of the adverse effect to the study is defined as follows:  
Probable:  An adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to study device, and 
another etiology is unlikely or significantly less likely.  
Possible:  An adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to the study device, 
and an alternative etiology is equally or less likely compared to the 
potential relationship to study device.

Probably not:  An adverse event has little or no temporal relationship t o the study device 
and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
Not related:  An adverse event has no temporal relationship to study device or has a much 
more likely alternative etiology.  
Reporting Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE ) 
Anticipated Adverse Events:  Anticipated adverse events in this study include Purpura , blistering, 
bruising , bullae, erosion, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, soreness , pain, erythema, 
damage to natural skin structure and  burn . If an unanticipated ad verse event occurs at any time 
during or after the use of the VelaShape III and UltraShape device s, the Investigator must report 
it to Syneron.  
The Investigator must report all unanticipated adverse device effects that are serious in nature to 
the clinica l study monitor immediately or within twenty -four  hours by telephone (see below). If 
such an unanticipated adverse device effect is reported after normal working hours, the 
Investigator will leave a voice message at the monitor’s telephone number with acco mpanying

RISK/BENEFIT ANALYSI S 
Risks  
Syneron has determined that the VelaShape III  and the UltraShape Power system s are 
non-significant risk device s. As indicated in the AE section, the anticipated risks associated with 
the use of both of the systems  are: 
➢ Purpura   ➢ Hyperpigmentation  
➢ Blister  ➢ Hypopigmentation  
➢ Bruising  ➢ Soreness  
➢ Bullae  ➢ First-degree burn  
➢ Erosion  
➢ Pain  
➢ Hair pulling  ➢ Second -degree burn  
➢ Erythema  
➢ Damage to natural skin structure 
(scratching, crusting)  
 
Over 2,000 subjects worldwide participated in clinical research and underwent treatment with 
the different VelaShape  or UltraShape  devices . The VelaShape III  and UltraShape  Power  devices 
that will be used in this study were previous ly used in  clinical studies and emitted the same RF or 
acoustic  energy, respectively . To date, no serious adverse events or unanticipated AEs have been 
reported. The reported AEs relate to skin and subcutaneous tissue  confined to the treatment area 
and were all mild or moderate in nature and resolved within the study period.  
Potential benefits to participating individuals and to society  
Subjects may or may not benefit from circumference reducti on, reduction of subcutaneous fatty 
tissue in the treated area  via a non -invasive technique  resulting in body contouring, or from skin 
laxity and  texture improvement .  All subjects in the treatment groups are expected to have some 
benefit from the treatment procedures as would be expected for the commercial device s 
(VelaShape III  and UltraShape  Power ). Subject will receive all treatment procedures at no cost.  
This study will benefit the advancement of medicine by generating data on safety and efficacy 
that will aid in the development of an alternative treatment options to procedures with higher 
potential risks subjects, such as liposuction.  The re sults of this study will help to determine 
whether th is device is  safe and effective for improvement of localized subcutaneous fat.  
Conclusion:  
Considering  the potential benefits of non -invasive circumference and fat reduction  relative to its 
risks, the po tential benefits associated with the use of the VelaShape III and UltraShape Power 
System s outweigh its risks, supporting study initiation.

APPENDIX III - PAIN ASSESSMENT  
 
Immediately after treatment the subject will be asked to rate treatment related pain. Pain will be 
assessed post treatment based on the Numerical Scale  Response  (NSR). The subject  will be 
presented a scale  (below) with words along a horizontal line and asked to make a mark along the 
scale  to rate their pain from no pain to worst possible pain.  A number will be derived by the 
research staff by measuring up to the point the subject has indicated  versus the entire line .

APPENDIX IV  ‐ PHOTOGRAPHY  
At each of the specified time points; photographs of the treated areas should be taken by 
investigator or their designee.  
• Photographs should be taken in a private room or area of the clinic under 
controlled conditions, including the distance from the camera to the subject, 
height of the camera, background, camera positioning, subject's positioning and 
lighting to achieve high -quality before & after sets.  
• Consistent lighting - Lighting s hould be projected from about 45º angle in order to 
emphasize the body appearance.  
• It is important to keep a constant distance between the subject’s feet (use “sticky 
feet” or another way of marking) in order to properly present the effect of the 
treatment . The  recommended distance between the feet is ~20  cm, but the main 
point is not to make this distance too small, so that the thighs touch each other, 
or too large.  
• The disposable underwear should be used for all photographs of treatment areas  
at each stud y visit . 
• For consistency purposes, the same person should ideally take all study 
photographs, particularly  for the same area and subject.  
• Small plain labels (with the date, subject ID, subject initials, Investigator name, 
and identity of the specific area  photographed, if  necessary) should be placed in 
the same location within each frame at each photography time point. The label 
should not cover the treated area . 
• All digital files should follow a consistent standard naming scheme.  
Specific photography deta ils: 
Four  photographs of each thigh (angles below) should be taken at each specified time point : 
• Front  of the thigh  
• 90º from the front (right side of the body)  
• 90º from the front (left  side of the body)  
• Back of the thigh  
Subject s’ arms should remain out of the way; it  is best to either cross them over each other in 
front of the chest or hold them up at a 90° angle to the body, ensuring that the  arms  do not rest 
on the chest or touch the body and that they do not cast a shadow in the photograph.

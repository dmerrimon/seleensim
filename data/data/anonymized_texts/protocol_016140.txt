Drug(S)Ofatumumab
ObjectivesPrimary:
•To determine the overall response rate (ORR), and in particular, the complete remission 
rate (CRR) in previously untreated MCL treated with ofatumumab in combination with aggressive chemo-immunotherapy.
Secondary:
•To determine the High Sensitivity Flow Cytometry (HSFCM) complete remission rate 
(HSFCM-CRR) in previously untreated MCL treated with ofatumumab in combination with aggressive chemo-immunotherapy +/- high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (HDC-ASCT).
•To determine the time-to-progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall 
survival (OS) of patients with previously untreated MCL treated with ofatumumab and aggressive chemoimmunotherapy +/- HDC-ASCT.
•To determine the toxicity profiles of ofatumumab in combination with high dose 
cytarabine chemoimmunotherapy +/- HDC-ASCT.
•To correlate minimal residual disease (MRD) at different time intervals with TTP, PFS, 
and OS.
•To correlate surface CD20 levels, Ki67, and additional cytogenetic abnormalities in 
pretreatment tumor biopsies with respect to ORR, CRR, TTP, PFS, or OS.
•To determine the relationship between proliferation signature and clinical outcome using 
quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
•To determine changes in surface CD20 levels, Ki67, or gain of additional cytogenetic 
abnormalities in relapsed/refractory tumor specimens.
•To correlate serum C3, C4, and CH50 levels measured at baseline and at the end of first 
ofatumumab infusion with ORR, CRR, MRR, TTP, PFS and OS.

Study DesignThis open-label, single-arm, multi-center Phase  II study evaluating efficacy, the safety, and 
tolerability of ofatumumab antibody in combination alternating doses of HyperCVAD and MA in previously untreated MCL administered at every 3 week intervals for 6 cycles followed by HDC-ASCT in eligible patients. 
Patients achieving a high sensitivity flow cytometry complete remission (HSFCM-CR) after 2 
cycles can proceed to autologous stem cell transplant after completing 4 cycles. 
Target 
Accrual and Study DurationA maximum of 37 patients at 2 sites (RPCI and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center) will be enrolled. 
Accrual is expected to take up to 7 years.
It is expected that patients will be receiving treatment on this study for approximately 6 months, 
after which if eligible, patients will receive an autologous stem cell transplant.
Study 
ProceduresAll chemotherapy and immunotherapy drug doses are based on a corrected body weight as follows: 
ideal + 25% of the difference between ideal and actual weight. If the actual weight is less than ideal, use actual weight. For patients whose actual weight is >150% of ideal weight, use 150% of ideal weight as the "actual" weight (i.e., the corrected weight is 112.5% of ideal).

Statistical AnalysisSample Size Justification:  The sample size calculation is based on testing the hypotheses 
concerning the proportion of the population with a response to the treatment:
0: 50%,
: 50%.aHpHp≤
>
This two-stage design requires a potential total of 37 patients in order to achieve approximately 
80% power to detect differences of 20 percentage points (50% versus 70%).
Analysis:
Stage 1: If 12 or less of the first 23 evaluable patients achieves a complete response as measured 
by standard response criteria reported by Cheson et al in 199945, it will be concluded that the therapy is not promising and the study will end. Otherwise, the study will progress to the second stage. Depending on the current complete response rate at the time the last patient in Stage 1 is enrolled, study enrollment may be halted until complete response status is evaluated in all 23 patients.APPROVED RP CI IRB

03/19/18 Page 7 of 109Stage 2:  This study will accrue 14 additional evaluable patients. If 24 or more of the total of 
37 evaluable patients achieve a complete response, it will be concluded that  exceeds 50% and p
that the therapy is efficacious and worthy of further study; otherwise, it will be concluded that there 
is no evidence to suggest that the therapy is associated with acceptable efficacy and is not promising.
With this design, the probability is 4.8% of falsely concluding that the proportion of objective 
responders exceeds 50% and 80% is the probability of correctly concluding efficacy when the true proportion of objective responders is 70% or higher.APPROVED RP CI IRB

1.1 Biology of Mantle Cell Lymphoma
According to last year’s published cancer statistics, approximately 74,030 new cases were 
diagnosed and 21,530 patients died from lymphoma despite currently available treatment.1 
Lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of malignancies with diverse biology, clinical behavior, and prognosis. Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) were defined as a distinct biological and clinical entity in early 1990 and while MCL represents only 6% of the cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) diagnosed in the United States every year, it continues to be a therapeutic challenge for the practicing oncologist.
2
Pathologically, MCL is a mature B-cell lymphoma originating from the mantle zone that surrounds the germinal centers in the lymph nodes.
3 Morphologically, MCL are characterized by 
the monomorphic proliferation of small to medium-sized lymphoid cells with irregular nuclei and concealed nucleoli. Four pathological variants had been recognized: small cell variant, marginal-zone like, blastoid and pleomorphic.
3 The histological diagnosis of MCL can be 
difficult and often requires the use of immunophenot yping and cytogenetic studies. MCL cell are 
characterized by the expression of mature B-cell markers. Immunophenotypically, MCL is characterized by expression of CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a, CD5 and CD43; and the absence of CD10, CD23 and Bcl-6.
4
At the molecular level, MCL is characterized by the deregulation of Bcl-2 family members (Mcl-1, BIM) altering apoptosis, as well as, cell cycle (cyclin D1) regulated in part by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Mcl-1 or cyclin D1 upregulation is the result of the chromosomal translocation t(11:14)(q13:q32), the hallmark cytogenetic abnormality of MCL
5,6. 
Deregulation of cyclin D1 is considered the primary molecular event involved in the pathogenesis of MCL progression. Recent studies using comparative genomic hybridization and array-based genomic studies had demonstrated additional chromosomal changes with genomic loses of tumor suppression genes (i.e., ATM, CDKN2A, TP53) or gains of oncogenic genes (i.e., MYC. SYK or BCL2). Such findings lead investigators to postulate a model of multistep genetic alterations which leads to molecular pathogenesis and progression (i.e., clonal evolution) in MCL.
7
1.2 Clinical Behavior and Management of Mantle Cell Lymphoma
The median age at diagnosis of MCL patients is  63 years with a 2 - 3:1 predominance of males to 
females. Extranodal disease is common and frequently involves bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract.
8 Overall, MCL is associated with a poor prognosis.8,9 MCL is typically 
characterized by an aggressive clinical course and inevitable development of refractory disease despite early intervention that often includes: immunotherapy (e.g., rituximab), multi-agent induction chemotherapy and consolidation with high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (HDC-ASCT) in first remission.
10
Three therapeutic interventions have improved the clinical outcomes of patients with MCL: 1) the addition of rituximab to standard chemotherapy; 2) the use of HDC-ASCT for APPROVED RP CI IRB

03/19/18 Page 23 of 109eligible patients; and recently; and 3) the incorporation of high dose cytarabine in the 
front-line treatment of MCL.10
1.2.1 The Use of Rituximab in the Management of Mantle Cell Lymphoma
In contrast to what has been observed in other subtypes of CD20+ B-cell lymphomas, rituximab 
has a somewhat less impressive activity in MCL. As a single agent, the response rate in both untreated and pretreated MCL patients is approximately 30% and the median duration of response was reported to be only 6 months.
11,12 Lenz et al , demonstrated that the addition of 
rituximab to standard doses of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) prior to HDC-ASCT (< 65 years of age) or interferon maintenance (> 65 year of age) improved the (CRR) (34% vs. 7%), but did not translate into a longer PFS or OS.
13 Other 
investigators have demonstrated higher response rates by adding rituximab to systemic chemotherapy in previously untreated MCL patients.
14,15 A comprehensive systematic review 
and meta-analysis indicated that rituximab plus chemotherapy may be superior to chemotherapy alone with respect to OS in MCL (hazard ratio for mortality, 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.37 - 0.98)
16. However, given significant differences between each clinical trial analyzed in the 
meta-analysis regarding the type of induction chemotherapy, consolidation with HD-ASCT and/or maintenance therapy with biological agents (e.g., interferon); the survival benefit observed by the addition of rituximab might be underestimated.
16 Recently, a retrospective study 
suggested that the use of rituximab in combination with systemic chemotherapy prior to HDC-ASCT resulted in an improved PFS and OS.
17
1.2.2 The Role of High Dose Chemotherapy and Autologous Stem Cell Transplant 
(HDC-ASCT)
In an attempt to increase the clinical outcomes of younger MCL patients responding to first line 
chemotherapy/chemo-immunotherapy, consolidation with HDC-ASCT had been utilized by several academic Institutions. Higher event free survival (EFS) and OS had been observed in MCL patients treated with HDC-ASCT following induction therapy when compared to historical controls in prospective Phase II studies.
18-20 The potential clinical benefit of HDC-ASCT 
consolidation following induction therapy in MCL patients was evaluated in a phase III clinical trial. Dreyling et al randomized 122 MCL patients to HDC-ASCT versus interferon maintenance following induction therapy with CHOP chemotherapy.
21 The use of early consolidation with 
HDC-ASCT resulted in a higher PFS (39 months vs. 17 months) but minimal improvement in OS at 3 years of follow up (83% vs. 77%).
21 Long-term follow-up of patients treated with 
chemotherapy and with/without rituximab follow by HDC-ASCT failed to show a disease-free plateau, suggesting that all patients will eventually relapse.
The Nordic group reported excellent outcomes in MCL patients treated with rituximab-maxi-
CHOP alternating with rituximab high dose cytarabine followed by HDC-ASCT. In this particular study, ex vivo  purging of the stem cells were performed with rituximab.
21,22 The 6-year 
OS, EFS, and PFS were 70%, 56%, and 66% respectively, with no patient relapsing after 
5 years.22 Of interest, correlative studies conducted in this particular trial demonstrated a higher 
number of patients achieving a complete remissi on by standard pathological and molecular 
studies (i.e., PCR) prior to HDC-ASCT. This  study highlighted the importance of: 1) achieving a APPROVED RP CI IRB

contamination by malignant B-cells by in vi vo or ex vivo “purging”; and 3) incorporating high 
dose cytarabine in the induction therapy of MCL.22 Similar findings were observed in 63 patients 
transplanted in complete remission included in bone marrow transplantation registries.23
1.2.3 The Role of High Dose Cytarabine in the Management of HDC-ASCT Eligible 
MCL Patients
Various chemotherapy regimens had been used in the front-line management of patients with 
MCL. In general those regimens follow into 3 categories: 1) multi-agent anthracycline-based regimens (i.e., CHOP); 2) purine analog-based regimens (studied only in non-transplant eligible patients); or 3) dose-intense regimens alternating anthracycline- and cytarabine-based regimens. In general, non-dose-intense regimens had clinical outcomes with complete response rates (CRR) ranging from 7% to 48%, PFS/EFS ranging from 7 months – 21 months and 2 years OS ranging from 45% to 85%.
10
Dose-intense regimens result in higher CRR and longer PFS/OS when compared to historical controls. One of the most highly studied dose-intense regimens is rituximab +/- hyper-fractionated cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and dexamethasone (R-HyperCVAD) alternating with rituximab and high-dose cytarabine and methotrexate (R-MA). Prior to rituximab, Romaguera et al, demonstrated that 4 cycles of HyperCVAD/MA (without rituximab) therapy for in previously untreated (25 points) or relapsed/refractory MCL resulted in an CRR of 38% prior to HDC-ASCT. More importantly, in the subset of previously untreated patients, the EFS following 4 cycles of HyperCVAD/MA and HDC-ASCT consolidation at 3 years was 72%.
18 Subsequently, the same group of investigators evaluated the efficacy and safety of 
rituximab in combination with HyperCVAD/R-MA in previously untreated MCL patients. Eligible patients received up to 8 cycles of R- HyperCVAD/R-MA. Early responder patients (i.e., 
those patients achieving a CR after 2 cycles) r eceived a total of 6 cycles. The response rate to 
such intense regimen was remarkable, with 87% of the patients achieving a CR by standard Cheson criteria after 6 cycles of therapy and 64% of the patients were free of disease at 3-year follow up. On the other hand, hematological toxicity was significant including five deaths due to treatment-related toxicity. In addition, 29% of the patients did not completed the planned 
therapy, 80% of those patients were scheduled to receive 8 cycles of therapy based on response (This is one of the reasons, we propose to administer only 6 cycles of chemo-immunotherapy in this clinical protocol).
14 An updated analysis after 10 years of follow up (median 8 years), 
demonstrated that the median OS for all patients had not been reached and the median time to treatment failure (TTF) for all patients was 4.6 years,  without a plateau in the curves stressing the 
need for novel therapeutic strategies.
24
The initial results from the Nordic group were validated in a randomized Phase III clinical study evaluating the role of high-dose cytarabine in MCL patients. Recently, Dr. Hermine on behalf of the EU-MCL network presented the updated results of a clinical trial that enrolled younger MCL patients. In this particular study, MCL patients randomized to receive a high-dose cytarabine-containing induction and pre-ASCT conditioning chemo-immunotherapy regimen had a higher CRR (60% vs. 41%, P = 0.0003) and longer time to treatment failure (TTF; not reached vs. 49 months) than patients treated with standard R-CHOP for 6 cycles followed by APPROVED RP CI IRB

03/19/18 Page 25 of 109cyclophosphamide based pre-ASCT conditioning regimen. This data further supports the use of 
high-dose cytarabine in the treatment of MCL patients.25
In general, the addition of high dose cytarabine improves the rate and quality of remissions as well as the duration of response. Notably, this is usually associated with higher toxicity (5% of toxic deaths, 15% severe infections and 30% severe thrombocytopenia).
In summary, the incorporation of rituximab, HDCT-ASCT and/or high dose cytarabine in the 
management of MCL has prolonged the median overall survival from 3 – 4 years to 5 - 6 years
14,20,24,26,27. However despite dose intense regimens such as rituximab in combination 
with hyper fractionated cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and dexamethasone (R-HyperCVAD) alternating with rituximab and hi gh dose cytarabine and methotrexate (R-MA) 
+/- HDC-ASCT used in the front-line setting, the median time to treatment failure is 4.6 years for all patients and 5.9 years for those younger than 65 years (without a plateau in the curves with the exception of those patients achieving a molecular remission).
14,24
Relapsed/refractory MCL is usually associated with a significant degree of chemo-resistance, low response rate and/or short duration of respons e to salvage chemotherapy (including targeted 
agents). There is a clinical need to incorporate promising agents into the upfront therapy of MCL in an attempt to further improve clinical outcomes.
There is a growing need to further characterize MCL cells at the molecular level in an attempt to: 
identify biomarkers predictive of response to front-line and salvage therapies; better understand the mechanisms associated with acquired resistance to immunochemotherapy; and identify and develop therapeutic strategies against novel targets and/or pathways.
1.3 Predictors of Clinical Outcome in Mantle Cell Lymphoma: The Importance of 
Achieving a Complete Remission
Several clinical and biological factors predicting the clinical outcome of MCL patients have been 
studied and are included in Section 1.3.1 , Section 1.3.2 , and Section 1.3.3 .
1.3.1 Clinical Markers of Response
A variety of important clinical prognostic features have been identified including poor 
performance status, splenomegaly, anemia and age at diagnosis. The international prognostic index score initially developed for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has been used to predict the clinical outcome in MCL patients with conflicting results. A specific MCL prognostic score (Mantle Cell International Prognostic Index = MIPI) has been proposed. This score, based on the study of 455 MCL patients, identified 4 independent prognostic factors of clinical outcome (age, performance status, l actic dehydrogenase levels, and leukocyte count). 
Based in this score, MCL patients can be stratified into 3 distinct risk groups with an OS of approximately 2 (high risk), 4 (intermediate) and 6 years (low risk).

Biological Poor Prognostic Features include histological subtypes (blastoid variants), the 
presence of p53 mutations, and the proliferation rate as determined by Ki-67 staining (< 30% vs. > 30%).
29-32
The importance of cell proliferation rate in the clinical outcome of MCL was recently confirmed 
by Rosenwald et al.33 In a retrospective analysis, this group of investigators identified, using 
gene expression profiling (GEP) studies, a “cell proliferation” gene signature as being the most powerful prognostic tool in MCL. Patients in the highest quartile for this gene expression signature had a median survival of 0.83 years while those in the lowest expression quartile had a median survival of 6.7 years.
33
This study will study the prognostic significance of abnormalities of cell cycle regulatory members at the time of diagnosis in patients with MCL treated with ofatumumab chemoimmunotherapy with/without HDC-ASCT. In addition, if genetic abnormalities in regulators of the cell cycle occur at the time of relapse following aggressive chemo-immunotherapy.
1.3.3 Kinetics of Response to Therapy as a Surrogate Marker of Clinical Outcome in 
Mantle Cell Lymphoma
Recent observations in clinical trials with dose-intense chemo-immunotherapy have suggested 
that achievement of a complete remission correlates with improve PFS and OS in MCL. Assessment of complete remission using ultrasensitive techniques had shown promising results in identifying patients who are now expected to  sustain long term remission following induction 
and consolidation therapy for MCL.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers directed to the breakpoint regions on 11q13 and 
14q32 was evaluated to detect and monitor MRD disease post-treatment in MCL.
34 While 
detection of MRD by PCR in MCL had been associated with a poor clinical outcome; the high false-negative rate (40% - 60%), cost, and its labor-intensiveness are likely reasons explaining why this assay has not been incorporated into clinical practice.
10
Immunophenotypically, MCL is characterized by expression of CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a, CD5 and CD43; and the absence of CD10, CD23 and Bcl-6.
4 Flow cytometry (FC) analysis had 
been used to detect and monitor MRD in MCL.35,36 Bottcher et al. developed and validated a 
four-color FC assay (also known as high sensitivity flow-cytometry = HSFCM) in MCL capable to detect MRD with similar sensitivity and specificity than IGH-PCR.
35 Using this 4-color FC 
assay, Pott et al. demonstrated that a “molecular” complete remission (mCR) as determined by FC analysis (HSFCM), was an independent pre dictor of clinical outcomes in MCL patients 
treated with rituximab-chemotherapy regimens followed by either HDC-ASCT (< 65 years) or rituximab vs. interferon maintenance (> 65 years).
36 Patients that achieved a mCR had a 
significantly improved duration of remission at 2 years (DR; 87% vs. 61%, P = 0.004). In a multivariate analysis, achievement of a mCR was found to be an independent factor predicting for prolonged DR regardless the type of induction, consolidation or maintenance therapy used. APPROVED RP CI IRB

03/19/18 Page 27 of 109The overall response (ORR) or complete response (CRR) rates in elderly and younger MCL 
patients were similar (99% vs. 96% and 32% vs. 31%, respectively).
More importantly, at the end of the induction therapy, mCR was only achieved in 67% and 48% 
of the elderly and younger patients respectively.36 This finding suggests that sub-clinical disease 
persists in 43% to 52% of MCL patients at the end of induction chemo-immunotherapy and may play a significant role in treatment failure observed following HDC-ASCT. The use of new anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and/or novel targeted agents may lead to higher “molecular” remissions and higher cure rates in patients with MCL.
In summary, the incorporation of: 1) rituximab, 2) early HDC-ASCS, and 3) high-dose 
cytarabine in the management of MCL results in improved clinical outcomes (i.e., ORR, CRR, TTF, PFS or OS). But failure to eliminate MRD may be associated with relapses observed in long-term follow up of MCL treated in clinical trials and stresses the scientific need to evaluated promising novel agents (e.g., ofatumumab). These findings are the basis for the design of this clinical protocol.
1.4 Pre-Clinical Development of Ofatumumab in B-Cell Lymphoma
Ofatumumab, a novel monoclonal antibody targeting CD20, is a human IgG antibody that binds 
to an epitope including the smaller, more membrane proximal loop of the CD20 antigen.
37,38 In 
addition to binding to a different epitope, ofatu mumab appears to bind with a stronger affinity 
due to a slower off-rate.37 Pre-clinical studies have shown ofatumumab to have similar antibody-
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and improved complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) in comparison to rituximab
37. Ofatumumab also prolongs B-cell depletion in comparison 
to rituximab and, slows lymphoma tumor cell growth in murine xenograft models.39APPROVED RP CI IRB

To better define ofatumumab’s activity, pre-clinical studies were conducted in rituximab-sensitive (RSCL) including MCL cell lines, rituximab-resistant (RRCL), ofatumumab-resistant cells (ORCL), primary lymphoma cells, and in a lymphoma xenograft model. Rituximab or ofatumumab resistant cell lines were generated as previously described.

Of interest, the repeated exposure of lymphoma cells to ofatumumab resulted in rituximab but 
not ofatumumab resistance. While the activity of rituximab diminished with CD20 down-regulation in RRCL passages, ofatumumab activity was preserved even at low CD20 levels (Figure 3 ).

ofatumumab (R2 = 0.2525). In the RRCL Raji 2R, the best-fit line for rituximab is essentially a 
flat slope (R2 = 0.0002) demonstrating resistance to rituximab-induced CMC lysis in all cell 
clones at the lowest levels of CD20 density while ofatumumab maintained higher levels of CMC lysis even at the lowest CD20 density with a continued decrease in CMC as CD20 diminished (R
2 = 0.48). Together, this data suggests that in both RSCLs and RRCLs ofatumumab is capable 
of killing lymphoma cells at lower CD20 levels more effectively than rituximab. 
Finally, ofatumumab was more effective in controlling in vivo  lymphoma growth than rituximab 
in a SCID mouse xenograft model. The median survival for animals treated with ofatumumab (10mg/kg/dose) [77 days] was longer than those treated with rituximab [50 days] ( Figure 4 ).
Figure 4. Ofatumumab Was More Effective in Controlling Lymphoma Growth Than 
Rituximab in Lymphoma Xenographs
Figure 4.  Ofatumumab was more effective in controlling lymphoma growth than rituximab in lymphoma xenographs. SCID mice were inoculated via tail vein with 1 x 10

either ofatumumab or rituximab at a dose of 10 mg/kg on Days 3, 7, 10 and 14. Mice were observed for u
p to 90 da ys.
Similar findings were observed when ofatumumab was compared to rituximab at 1 mg/kg/dose (data not shown).
Our data suggest that ofatumumab is more potent than rituximab in rituximab-sensitive 
(including MCL cell lines) or rituximab-resistant models and is less likely to induce biologic resistance to mAbs targeting CD20.
1.5 Clinical Experience with Ofatumumab in B-Cell Malignancies
Ofatumumab had been evaluated in several clinical trials enrolling CD20+ B-cell 
lymphoproliferative disorders. In a Phase I/II dose escalation study in CLL, ofatumumab demonstrated a relatively high objective response rate of up to 50% in a heavily pretreated population and was well tolerated.
41 Similar response rates were noted in a Phase II trial in CLL 
patients when combined with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide.42 Results of a Phase III trial in APPROVED RP CI IRB

early phase clinical trials are currently underway. A Phase I/II trial of ofatumumab in FL patients showed an ORR of 43% and evidence of a dose response relationship with the highest dose 
group achieving an ORR up to 60%
.39 However, a Phase II trial of ofatumumab in a heavily pre-
treated rituximab-refractory follicular lymphoma patient population was associated with limited 
anti-tumor activity.44 Additional Phase II trials of ofatumumab in combination with CHOP and 
other agents in various histologies of B-cell NHL and CLL have been completed or are ongoing.
2 RATIONALE
Up to date clinical data suggests that the clinical outcome of MCL continues to be poor despite 
aggressive therapeutic intervention. TTF, PFS and OS curves do not demonstrate plateaus with currently available treatment (including rituximab and HDC-ASCT). Residual disease at the time of stem cell collection is an important cause for treatment failure.  On the other hand, 
achievement of complete remission, and in particular, complete remission by high sensitivity flow cytometric analysis has been associated  with sustained remissions beyond 5 years in a 
prospective clinical trial. This suggests that achievement of complete remission by HS-FCM may be a surrogate marker for long term survival. Rituximab-based therapy results in a HS-FCM CRR of 48%, therefore, stressing the need to test novel and more potent monoclonal antibodies targeting CD20 (i.e., ofatumumab).
In pre-clinical studies we have demonstrated that ofatumumab was more potent than rituximab in 
eliciting complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) at the doses tested in RSCLs, RRCLs and MCL cell lines. In addition, we have shown that ofatumumab was more active than rituximab in killing primary tumor cells derived from patients with B-cell lymphoma and was more effective in controlling in vivo lymphoma growth in a murine xenograft model. This clinical trial will test if ofatumumab when combined with the most potent chemotherapy regimen available for MCL (i.e., HyperCVAD/alternating with HD-MA) leads to higher CRR, HS-FCM CRR and better clinical outcome post-HDC-ASCT in MCL patients. Ofatumumab will be used at the standard dose/schedule used in prior clinical trials as single agent or in combination with systemic chemotherapy in various subtypes of hematological malignancies.

A maximum of 37 patients at 2 sites (RPCI and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center) will be 
enrolled. Accrual is expected to take up to 7 years.
It is expected that patients will be receiving treatment on this study for approximately 6 months, 
after which if eligible, patients will receive an autologous stem cell transplant.
5 PATIENT SELECTION
This clinical trial can fulfill its objectives only if patients appropriate for the trial are enrolled. 
All relevant medical and other considerations should be taken into account when deciding whether this protocol is appropriate for a particular patient. To maximize eligibility for study entry patient safety, patients will be treated on this protocol only at NCCN-members/approved autologous transplant centers. Physicians should consider the risks and benefits of any therapy and, therefore, only enroll patients for which the agents administered are appropriate. Although they will not be considered as formal eligibility criteria, as part of this decision-making process, physicians should recognize that the following might increase the risk to the patient entering this protocol:
•Other serious illnesses which would limit survival to less than 2 years, or psychiatric 
condition which would prevent compliance with treatment or informed consent.
•Uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, or infection, which in 
the opinion of the treating physician would make this protocol unreasonably hazardous for the patient.
•Known peripheral or autonomic neuropathy which, in the opinion of the treating 
physician, would make the administration of vincristine unreasonably hazardous for the patient.
All patients must be screened for hepatitis B infection before starting treatment Those patients 
who test negative for hepatitis B surface antigen, but HepBc antibody positive + HBV DNA negative should be closely monitored for evidence of active HBV infection and hepatitis during and for several months after ofatumumab treatment, and should be managed as clinically indicated (see Section 5.1 : bullet 5.1.10.3, and Error!

Figure 5. Ofatumumab Infusion Set-Up Schema
•Ofatumumab must be administered by IV infusion through an in-line filter and through a 
well-functioning IV catheter (IV cannula) into a vein in the arm (or other venous access) by an infusion pump.
•NOTE: It is mandatory to use an in-line low protein binding 0.2 micron polyether sulfone 
filter for all IV dosing of ofatumumab drug product.
•DO NOT ADMINISTER AS AN INTRAVENOUS PUSH OR BOLUS.
•Ofatumumab should not be mixed with any other medication. If ofatumumab is to be dosed 
through an in-dwelling catheter, then, any previous medication should be removed by flushing with normal saline prior to dosing with ofatumumab.
•NOTE: The infusion site can be used for blood sampling only if there is no risk of 
contamination of the infusion needle with the saline, infusion solutions, or any other fluid(s). Only a newly inserted needle can be used for the pre-dose blood samples.APPROVED RP CI IRB

03/19/18 Page 43 of 1096.1.9 Toxicity
The most common or serious adverse events associated with ofatumumab include:
•Infusion Reactions:  Infusion reactions occurred in 44% of patients on the day of the first 
infusion (300 mg), 29% on the day of the second infusion (2,000 mg), and less frequently during subsequent infusions. Ofatumumab can cause serious infusion reactions manifesting as bronchospasm, dyspnea, laryngeal edema, pulmonary edema, flushing, hypertension, hypotension, syncope, cardiac ischemia/infarction, back pain, abdominal pain, pyrexia, rash, urticaria, and angioedema. Infusion reactions occur more frequently with the first 2 infusions.
•Tumor Lysis Syndrome:  Tumor lysis syndrome resulting in renal failure has been 
described, and occasional fatalities noted. Tumor lysis syndrome is more likely in patients with high numbers of circulating malignant cells. In patients with circulating mantle cells ≥ 10,000/μL, the first ofatumumab infusion should be reduced or omitted.
•Cytopenias: Neutropenia:  Of 108 patients with normal neutrophil counts at baseline, 
45 (42%) developed ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia. Nineteen (18%) developed Grade 4 neutropenia. 
Some patients experienced new onset Grade 4 neutropenia > 2 weeks in duration.
•Intestinal Obstruction:  Obstruction of the small intestine can occur in patients receiving 
ofatumumab. Perform a diagnostic evaluation if obstruction is suspected.
•Infections:  A total of 108 patients (70%) experienced bacterial, viral, or fungal infections. A 
total of 45 patients (29%) experienced ≥ Grade 3 infections, of which 19 (12%) were fatal. 
The proportion of fatal infections in the fludarabine- and alemtuzumab-refractory group was 17%.
•Fulminant and Fatal Hepatitis B Virus (HBV):  Fulminant and fatal hepatitis B virus 
(HBV) infection can occur in patients newly exposed to HBV following treatment with ofatumumab. In addition, hepatitis B reactivation, including fulminant hepatitis and death, occurs with other monoclonal antibodies directed against CD20. Screen patients at high risk of HBV infection before initiation of ofatumumab. Closely monitor carriers of hepatitis B for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection during treatment with ofatumumab and for 6 months to 12 months following the last infusion of ofatumumab. Discontinue ofatumumab in patients who develop viral hepatitis or reactivation of viral hepatitis, and institute appropriate treatment. Insufficient data exist regarding the safety of administration of ofatumumab in patients with active hepatitis.
•Exacerbation or reactivation of other viral infections has also been reported with 
ofatumumab. Recent reports describe JC virus reactivation leading to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients who were receiving ofatumumab. Patients presenting with new neurologic findings (e.g., major changes in vision, unusual eye movements, loss of balance or coordination, confusion) should be evaluated for PML (see APPENDIX B ).

not eligible for entry on this research study.
Other rare serious adverse events are:
•Brain damage (possible headache, confusion, seizures, weakness on one side and/or 
vision loss), also called PRES or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.
•Very severe blistering skin disease; loss of large portions of skin, also called toxic 
epidermal necrolysis (TENS).
•Another antibody treatment similar to ofatumumab has caused severe skin rashes, 
including the lining of the mouth, gut and lungs. In some cases this was fatal. Severe skin reactions may also be observed in association with ofatumumab, particularly in the setting of cancer.

prefilled syringe should be administered irrespective of the patient’s actual weight.
6.11.4 Toxicity
In a placebo-controlled trial, bone pain occurred at a higher incidence in pegfilgrastim-treated 
patients as compared to placebo-treated patients (pegfilgrastim, n = 467; placebo, n = 461). The incidence of other commonly reported adverse events were similar in the pegfilgrastim and placebo-treated patients, and were consistent with the underlying cancer diagnosis and its treatment with chemotherapy. Those adverse events occurred at rates between 48% and 10% in the pegfilgrastim treated patients and included: alopecia, bone pain, diarrhea, pyrexia (not including febrile neutropenia), myalgia, headache, arthralgia, vomiting, asthenia, edema peripheral, and constipation.
In the active controlled studies, common adverse events occurred at similar rates and severities 
in both treatment arms (pegfilgrastim, n = 465; filgrastim, n = 331). These adverse experiences occurred at rates between 72% and 15% and included: nausea, fatigue, alopecia, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, fever, anorexia, skeletal pain, headache, taste perversion, dyspepsia, myalgia, insomnia, abdominal pain, arthralgia, generalized weakness, peripheral edema, dizziness, granulocytopenia, stomatitis, mucositis, and neutropenic fever.
6.11.5 Laboratory Abnormalities
In clinical studies, leukocytosis (WBC counts > 100 x 10
9/L) was observed in less than 1% of 
932 patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving pegfilgrastim. Leukocytosis was not associated with any adverse effects. In the placebo-controlled study, reversible elevations in LDH, alkaline phosphatase, and uric acid that did not require treatment occurred at similar rates 
in pegfilgrastim- and placebo-treated patients.

03/19/18 Page 51 of 109Rare cases of splenic rupture have been reported following the administration of pegfilgrastim. 
Splenic rupture, in some cases resulting in death, has also been associated with filgrastim, the 
parent compound of pegfilgrastim. Patients receiving pegfilgrastim who report left upper abdominal and/or shoulder tip pain should be evaluated for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture.
Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been reported in neutropenic patients with 
sepsis receiving Filgrastim, the parent compound of pegfilgrastim, and is postulated to be secondary to an influx of neutrophils to sites of inflammation in the lungs. Neutropenic patients receiving pegfilgrastim who develop fever, lung infiltrates, or respiratory distress should be evaluated for the possibility of ARDS. In the event that ARDS occurs, pegfilgrastim should be discontinued and/or withheld until resolution of ARDS and patients should receive appropriate medical management for this condition.
Severe sickle cell crises have been associated w ith the use of pegfilgrastim in patients with sickle 
cell disease. Severe sickle cell crises, in some cases resulting in death, have also been associated with Filgrastim, the parent compound of pegfilgrastim. Only physicians qualified by specialized training or experience in the treatment of patients with sickle cell disease should prescribe pegfilgrastim for such patients, and only after careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits.

Submission of a tissue block is critical for MCL diagnosis confirmation. High quality hematoxylin and 
eosin-stained sections and any required confirmat ory studies (i.e., immunohistochemistry and in situ 
hybridization) may be done most efficiently from the tis sue block in laboratories of the RPCI pathology 
and cytogenetic departments. In this study, additiona l analysis will include baseline Ki-67, cyclin D1 
expression as well as the existence or acquisition of additional cytogenetic abnormalities besides the t(11;14)(q13;q32) (i.e., as P53 deletion, 13q (RB1 and D13S25), 9p (CDKN2A)(p16) loss, ATM deletion, MYC rearrangement).Within 30 days of registration, send a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded block of well-fixed lymphoma tissue c ontaining adequate material for histologic 
confirmation of MCL and for additional studies described above. A block at least 1 cm x 1 cm x 2 cm is preferable, although smaller is acceptable if no other block is suitable. If only 1 block exists, and the tissue is sufficiently large, it is acceptable to split the block into 2 blocks and submit 1 block. Failure to submit pathology materials within 30 days of patient registration will be considered a major protocol 
violation.
7.4 Correlative Science Sample Submission
All investigator- or analyzing-research laboratories housing research samples are required to maintain 
current Temperature Logs and study-specific Sample Tracking and Shipping Logs.  The Principal Investigator/Laboratory Manager must ensure that the stated lab(s) have a process in place which documents the receipt/processing/storage/shipping of study-related sample/specimens.

8.1 Dosing and Administration
Treatment will be administered in an inpatient/outpatient basis. Reported adverse events (AEs) 
and potential risks are described in Section 6. Appropriate dose modifications are described in 
Section 8.7 . No other investigational or commercial drugs or therapies other that those described 
below may be administered with the intent to treat the patient.
8.2 General Guidelines
Prior to initiating therapy, placement of a mediport  or a multi-lumen indwelling Silastic catheter 
is required.
All patients will be given allopurinol 600 mg/day PO the day prior to Treatment 1 (Day 0) and 
then 300 mg/day PO for Day 1 through Day 10 of the first cycle. Allopurinol length of therapy may be extended at discretion of the investigator in the presence of tumor lysis syndrome.
All chemotherapy drug doses in Treatments 1 - 6 are based on a corrected body weight as 
follows: ideal + 25% of the difference between ide al and actual weight. If the actual weight is less than ideal, use actual weight. For patients whose actual weight is > 150% of ideal weight, 
use 150% of ideal weight as the “actual” weight (i.e., the corrected weight is 112.5% of ideal). Ofatumumab will be administered at a fix dose of 1000 mg unless the patient is at risk for tumor lysis syndrome (first cycle only).
Ofatumumab + HyperCVAD (Cycles 1, 3 and 5) alternating with ofatumumab + HD-MA 
(Cycles 2, 4 and 6) will be administered every 21 days.
The following laboratory parameters must be met before starting Cycles 2 to 6:
•Begin subsequent cycles no sooner than Day 22 but no later than Day 29. If treatment is 
delayed for more than 7 days, please contact the Principal Investigator at RPCI.
•ANC ≥ 1000/μL without G-CSF
•Platelets ≥ 75,000/μL or investigator discretion
•Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL
•Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL (unless due to disease involvement with MCL or Gilbert’s 
syndrome). If total bilirubin is > 5 mg/dL (see  Table 8 ).
•If there is a greater than 7 day delay because of these starting rules, please contact the

• In eligible patients, HDC-ASCT will be performed at the participating NCCN institution 
following the individual institution’s standard of care guidelines.
• Eligibility for HDC-ASCT will be assessed according to the Individual Institution’s guidelines.
• The following information will be collected for each patient undergoing HDC-ASCT:
oStem cell mobilization agent utilized.
oFeasibility of stem cell collection following ofatumumab-based chemoimmunotherapy 
(i.e., total of number of stem cell collected and length of time to successful stem cell collection).
oDetection of MCL cells in the final stem cell product by HS-FCM and molecular 
diagnostics.
oDisease status following HDC-ASCT at Day 100.
• Timeline for stem cell collection and HDC-ASCT
oStem cell collection should be attempted within 4 – 6 weeks after the last dose of 
ofatumumab-chemotherapy (after Cycle 6; or, after Cycle 4 for patients who achieve an HSFCM-CR after 2 cycles). Delayed stem cell collections beyond 6 weeks are allowed in those patients experiencing significant treatment related toxicities and/or unsuccessful stem cell collection attempts.
oHDC-ASCT should be performed within 2 – 6 weeks following stem cell collection.
•Recently, the use of rituximab maintenance following HDC-ASCT was found to improve 
not only the progression free survival (PFS) but also the overall survival (OS) of patients with Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).[1]. Because of that, the standard of care for patients with MCL changed recently. The protocol has been modified to reflect changes in clinical practice. 
oLymphoma Study Association group reported last year the results of an important 
randomized phase III study.  A total of 299 MCL patients younger than 66 years of age were randomly assigned rituximab maintenance therapy (N=240) or to undergo observation (N=120) after autologous stem-cell transplantation; 59 patients did not undergo randomization. All patients received the same front line therapy and the same conditioning regimen prior to the autologous stem cell support.  Rituximab maintenance was started 3 months after HDC-ASCT. The primary end point was event-free survival (with an event defined as disease progression, relapse, death, allergy to rituximab, or severe infection) after transplantation among patients who underwent randomization. The median follow-up from randomization after HDC-ASCT was 50.2 months (range, 46.4 to 54.2). The rate of event-free survival at 4 years was 79% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70 to 86) in the rituximab maintenance group versus 61% (95% CI, APPROVED RP CI IRB

8.7 Dose Modifications and Management of Toxicity
8.7.1 Hematologic Toxicity
Febrile Neutropenia:  is expected with Cycles 1 - 6. Prophylactic antibiotics and 
G-CSF/Peg-GCSF are utilized during these cycles. No dose modifications are made in subsequent cycles following an episode of febrile neutropenia.
Monitoring Blood Counts During Cycles 1 - 6: Anemia and thrombocytopenia are expected 
from the agents utilized in this regimen. The use of erythrocyte growth factors (i.e., epogen) is not allowed. Routine blood counts will be performed 3 times per week between Day 9 and Day 20 of each cycle. Blood product support will be provided at discretion of the primary investigator. All blood products should be leukofiltered and irradiated to reduce/prevent alloimmunization and transfusion graft-vs-host disease.
Blood Counts on Day 1 of Cycles 2 - 6:  The following modification will be made based on 
blood counts obtained within 3 days prior to each subsequent cycle (Cycles 2 - 6). Delay treatment until ANC count ≥ 1000/μL and platelet count ≥ 75,000/μL, then begin treatment at 
full dose. If treatment is delayed for more than 7 days, please contact the Principal Investigator at

8.7.3 Neurotoxicity8.7.3.1 Vincristine - Associated Sensory and Motor Neuropathy
The dose of vincristine should only be reduced if the patient develops neuropathy that interferes 
with activities of daily living (see below). Most vincristine associated neuropathy resolves after completion of treatment.
•Sensory Neuropathy:  If Grade 3 toxicity develops, reduce vincristine 25%. If symptoms 
improve to < Grade 2, doses may be increased to previous levels (i.e., 25% for Grade 2 and full dose for < Grade 1). If a patient experiences Grade 4 toxicity, discontinue vincristine.
•Motor Neuropathy:  If Grade 2 toxicity develops, reduce vincristine 25%. If a patient 
experiences Grade 3 toxicity, reduce vincristine 50%. If symptoms improve, doses may be increased to previous levels. If a patient experiences Grade 4 toxicity, discontinue vincristine.
•Vincristine May Produce GI Hypomotility with Constipation or Ileus: Prophylactic 
laxatives according to institutional policies are recommended. Decrease vincristine dose 50% for Grade 3, severe constipation with ileus despite aggressive medical management. Discontinue vincristine for severe persistent GI hypomotility following dose adjustment.APPROVED RP CI IRB

Activation of peptic ulcer will warrant discontinuation of corticosteroid treatment.
8.7.5 Cardiotoxicity
Anthracyclines may result in congestive heart failure (CHF) with fluid retention and shortness of 
breath that may be controllable with medications. Discontinue anthracycline if:
•Persistent arrhythmia Grade > 3 (including, sinus tachycardia with no demonstrable cause).
•CHF appears.

8.8 Ancillary Therapy
Patients should receive full supportive care, including transfusions of blood and blood products, 
some growth factors (see below), antibiotics, antiemetics, etc., when appropriate. The reason(s) for treatment, dosage, and the dates of treatment should be recorded on the flow sheets.
Treatment with hormones or other chemotherapeutic agents may not be administered except for 
corticosteroids given for adrenal failure, as an antiemetic or part of a pre-medication for ofatumumab. Other hormones administered for non-lymphoma-related conditions (e.g., insulin for diabetes) are allowed.
Use of growth factors . 
The following guidelines are applicable unless otherwise specified in the protocol:
•The use of EPO is not permitted in this protocol.
•Prophylactic G-CSF or peg-G-CSF is required by this protocol due to the intense nature 
of protocol treatments.
Subjects who are HBAg negative, anti-HBc positive and HVB DNA negative may be included in 
the study but must undergo HVB DNA monitoring.  Consult with a physician experienced in care and management of subjects with hepatitis B to manage/treat subjects who are anti-HBc positive. Initiate anti-viral therapy if required.  If a subject’s HVB DNA becomes positive during the study, notify the NOVARTIS medical monitor.  For subjects who have not completed planned ofatumumab therapy, discuss with the medical monitor the risks and benefits of continuing or discontinuing ofatumumab before appropriate treatment decisions are made for 
that individual subject.APPROVED RP CI IRB

•Duration of Treatment:  Remove from protocol therapy any patient with rapid disease 
progression. Because protocol-designated, complete restaging is not performed until three months post-stem cell transplant, patients should proceed with all protocol treatment unless clinical events warrant an investigation and subsequent unequivocal documentation of progression. When in doubt as to whether progression has occurred, evaluate with appropriate scans and biopsies and consult the Principal Investigator at RPCI. Document details, including tumor measurements, on flow sheets.
•Extraordinary Medical Circumstances:  If, at any time the constraints of this protocol 
are detrimental to the patient’s health and/or the patient no longer wishes to continue protocol therapy, protocol therapy shall be discontinued. In this event:
oNotify the Principal Investigator at RPCI.
oDocument the reason(s) for discontinuation of therapy on flow sheets.
oFollow the patient for survival, progression, late toxicity, and secondary 
malignancies.
9 EFFICACY EVALUATIONS9.1 Objectives
The primary objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the overall response rate and complete 
response rate to ofatumumab+HyperCVAD/HD-MA in MCL. It is important to evaluate response to therapy using standardized response criteria utilized in previous clinical studies in MCL patients so direct comparisons can be performed with historical controls (i.e., rituximab+HyperCVAD/HD-MA). For this reason response to therapy will be evaluated using the response criteria reported by Cheson et al in 1999 (see Section 9.3 ).
45 However, as medical 
imaging technology advances it is imperative to evaluate prospective differences in response rates when patients treated with a given regimen are evaluated using criteria incorporating novel imaging studies (i.e., PET scan). For this reason this study will also assess response to ofatumumab+HyperCVAD/HD-MA using the modified Cheson criteria published in 2007 (Section 3.2 , last bullet)  (see Section 9.4 ).

9.2 Imaging, Laboratory and Pathological Studies
Imaging, laboratory and pathological studies will be conducted for staging and response 
evaluation at baseline, before Cycle 3, and Cycle 5, within 3 weeks after Cycle 6 (or within 3 weeks after Cycle 4 for patients who achieve an HSFCM-CR after 2 cycles), and in those eligible, on Day 100 post HDC-ASCT. Response to treatment will be evaluated according to: the International Working Group Response criteria as reported by Cheson et al. and the revised Cheson criteria ( Section 3.2 , last bullet).5/14/2018

study-related samples and specimens.
9.3 International Working Group Response Criteria (Original Cheson Criteria)
9.3.1 Complete Response (CR)
Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of target lesions and 
disappearance of all disease-related symptoms if present prior to therapy, as well as normalization of those biochemical abnormalities (e.g., LDH, etc.) definitely assignable to MCL.
All lymph nodes and nodal masses must have regressed to normal size ( ≤ 1.5 cm in their greatest 
transverse diameter for nodes > 1.5 cm prior to therapy). Previously involved nodes that were 1.1 cm to 1.5 cm in their greatest transverse diameter prior to treatment must have decreased to ≤ 1 cm in their greatest transverse diameter after treatment, or by more than 75% in the sum of 
the products of their greatest transverse diameters (SPD).
The spleen, if considered to be enlarged before therapy on the basis of a CT scan, must have 
regressed in size and must not be palpable on physical examination. (No normal size can be specified, however, because of the difficulties in evaluating splenic and hepatic size.) Any macroscopic nodules in any organs detectable on imaging studies should no longer be present. Similarly, other organs considered to be enlarged prior to therapy due to involvement of lymphoma (i.e., kidneys, liver, etc.) must have decreased in size.
If the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma prior to treatment, the infiltrate must be cleared 
on repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy of same site.
9.3.2 Complete Response/Unconfirmed (CRu)
Complete response/unconfirmed will include those patients who have met the criteria in 
Section 9.3  (complete response, paragraphs 1 and 3), but with 1 or more of the following:
A residual node > 1.5 cm in greatest transverse diameter that has regressed more than 75% in the 
product of its diameters. Individual nodes that were previously confluent must have regressed more than 75% in the product of their diameters compared with the size of the original mass.
Indeterminate bone marrow (increased number or size of aggregates without cytologic or 
architectural atypia).
9.3.3 Partial Response (PR)
A decrease of ≥ 50% in the SPD of the six largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. These nodes 
or masses should be selected according to the following features: a) they should be clearly measurable in at least two perpendicular measurements; b) they should be from as disparate APPROVED RP CI IRB

of disease whenever these sites are involved.
No increase in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen.Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by at least 50% in SPD. With the exception of splenic 
and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is  considered assessable and not measurable 
disease.
Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR because it is assessable and not 
measurable disease; however, if positive the cell type should be specified in the report (e.g., large-cell lymphoma).
No new sites of disease.
9.3.4 Stable Disease (SD)
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as 
reference the smallest SPD since the treatment started.
9.3.5 Progression (PD) or Relapse
≥ 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously identified abnormal node for PRs or 
non-responders.
Appearance of any new lesion during or after completion of therapy.
9.4 Modified Cheson Criteria9.4.1 Complete Response (CR)
Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related 
symptoms if present before therapy.
Typically FDG-avid lymphoma: in patients with PET scan positive before therapy, a post-
treatment residual mass of any size is permitted as long as it is PET negative.
Variably FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG avidity unknown: in patients with a negative pretreatment 
PET scan, all lymph nodes and nodal masses must have regressed on CT to normal size (1.5 cm in their greatest transverse diameter for nodes 1.5 cm before therapy). Previously involved nodes that were 1.1 cm to 1.5 cm in their long axis and more than 1.0 cm in their short axis before treatment must have decreased to 1.0 cm in their short axis after treatment.
The spleen and/or liver, if considered enlarged before therapy on the basis of a physical 
examination or CT scan, should not be palpable on physical examination and should be considered normal size by imaging studies, and nodules related to lymphoma should disappear. However, determination of splenic involvement is not always reliable because a spleen considered normal in size may still contain lymphoma, whereas an enlarged spleen may reflect variations in anatomy, blood volume, the use of hematopoietic growth factors, or causes other than lymphoma.APPROVED RP CI IRB

on repeat bone marrow biopsy.
The biopsy sample on which this determination is made must be adequate (with a goal of 20 mm 
unilateral core). If the sample is indeterminate by morphology, it should be negative by immunohistochemistry. A sample that is negative by immunohistochemistry but that demonstrates a small population of clonal lymphocytes by flow cytometry will be considered a CR until data become available demonstrating a clear difference in patient outcome.

Patients who achieve a CR by the above criteria, but who have persistent morphologic bone 
marrow involvement will be considered partial responders.
When the bone marrow was involved before therapy and a clinical CR was achieved, but with no 
bone marrow assessment after treatment, patients should be considered partial responders.
No new sites of disease should be observed.Typically FDG-avid lymphoma: for patients with no pretreatment PET scan or if the PET scan 
was positive before therapy, the post-treatment PET should be positive in at least one previously involved site.

A patient is considered to have SD when he or she fails to attain the criteria needed for a CR or 
PR, but does not fulfill those for progressive disease (see Relapsed Disease [after CR]/Progressive Disease [after PR, SD]).
Typically FGD-avid lymphomas: the PET should be positive at prior sites of disease with no new 
areas of involvement on the post-treatment CT or PET.
Variably FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG-avidity unknown: for patients without a pretreatment PET 
scan or if the pretreatment PET was negative, there must be no change in the size of the previous lesions on the post-treatment CT scan.
9.4.4 Progression (PD) or Relapse
Lymph nodes should be considered abnormal if the long axis in more than 1.5 cm regardless of 
the short axis. If a lymph node has a long axis of 1.1 cm to 1.5 cm, it should only be considered abnormal if its short axis is more than 1 cm. Lymph nodes 1 cm x 1 cm will not be considered as abnormal for relapse or progressive disease.
Appearance of any new lesion more than 1.5 cm in any axis during or at the end of therapy, even 
if other lesions are decreasing in size. Increased FDG uptake in a previously unaffected site should only be considered relapsed or progressive disease after confirmation with other modalities. In patients with no prior history of pulmonary lymphoma, new lung nodules identified by CT are mostly benign. Thus, a therapeutic decision should not be made solely on the basis of the PET without histologic confirmation.
At least a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously involved nodes, or in a single 
involved node, or the size of other lesions (e.g., splenic or hepatic nodules). To be considered 
progressive disease, a lymph node with a diameter of the short axis of less than 1 cm must increase by 50% and to a size of 1.5 cm or more than 1.5 cm in the long axis.
At least a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single previously identified node more 
than 1 cm in its short axis.
Lesions should be PET positive if observed in a typical FDG avidLymphoma or the lesion was PET positive before therapy unless the lesion is too small to be 
detected with current PET systems (1.5 cm in its long axis by CT).
9.4.5 Duration of Overall Response
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for 
CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).

10 SAFETY EVALUATION
Given the expected hematological and non-hematological toxicities from rituximab-HyperCVAD 
alternating with rituximab and high dose Methotrexate/Cytarabine (MA) regimen, close monitoring will be conducted for this proposed ofatumumab-HyperCVAD alternating with ofatumumab-Methotrexate/Cytarabine regimen.
The description and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for adverse events (AE) evaluation and reporting. All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website (http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html  ). All reactions determined to be “reportable" in 
an expedited manner must be reported to the local Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the 
participating Institution, the Principal Investigator at RPCI, RPCI CRS, and to the funding organization (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) and agent provider Novartis. (Reporting of cases of secondary acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) should also be done as described above.
10.1 Adverse Events10.1.1 Definition
An adverse event or adverse experience (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated 
with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. Therefore, an AE can be ANY unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (i nvestigational) product (attribution of ‘unrelated’, 
‘unlikely’, ‘possible’, ‘probable’, or ‘definite’).
An AE is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at 
the specificity or severity that has been observed; or if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan in other study-related documents. 
Events meeting the definition of an AE include:
•Any abnormal laboratory test results (e.g., hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) 
or other safety assessments (e.g., EKGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator.
•Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.APPROVED RP CI IRB

though it may have been present prior to the start of the study.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigational product or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE).
•“Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. However, the signs and symptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE.
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include:
•Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal safety 
assessments that is associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject’s condition.
•The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s condition.
•Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy). The condition that leads 
to a procedure is an AE.
•Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
•Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
•B-cell depletion and hypogammaglobulinemia due to ofatumumab treatment
For the purpose of this study, AE reporting will not be required during the HFC-ASCT portion 
that will follow after the completion of chemo-immunotherapy in eligible patients. After the completion of all therapy, including HDC-ASCT for those eligible, subjects will be followed for disease response, progression and survival only, and research samples and re-staging studies will be done at the defined time points.
10.1.1.1 Diagnosis Versus Signs and Symptoms
If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the CRF rather than individual signs and symptoms 
(e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be clinically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow-up information.APPROVED RP CI IRB

03/19/18 Page 76 of 10910.1.1.2 Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) 
should be identified by their primary cause. For example, if severe diarrhea is known to have resulted in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the CRF.
However, clinically significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated 
in time should be recorded as independent events on the CRF. For example, if a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be recorded separately on the CRF.
10.1.1.3 Abnormal Laboratory Values
Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that require active management will be 
recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF (e.g., abnormalities that require study drug dose modification, discontinuation of study treatment, more frequent follow-up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.).
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 x the upper limit of normal associated with cholecystitis), only the diagnosis (e.g., cholecystitis) needs to be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF.
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the 
abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE  or SAE on the CRF. If the laboratory abnormality 
can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE or SAE. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia”
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should 
not be repeatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF, unless their severity, seriousness, or etiology changes.
10.1.1.4 Preexisting Medical Conditions (Baseline Signs and Symptoms)
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, 
severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. When recording such events on an Adverse Event CRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., “more frequent headaches”).
10.1.2 Grading and Relationship to Drug
The descriptions and grading scales found in the CTEP Version 4 of the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be utilized for AE reporting. CTEPVersion 4 of the CTCAE is identified and located at:
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.html .
AEs not covered by specific terminology listed should be reported with common medical 
terminology, and documented according to the grading scales provided in the CTCAE Version 4.APPROVED RP CI IRB

•A life-threatening adverse event (experience). Any AE that places a participant or 
participant, in the view of the Investigator or sponsor, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred. It does NOT  include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death.
•Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (for > 24 hours).
•A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.
•A congenital anomaly or birth defect.
•Important Medical Event (IME) that, based upon medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
10.2.2 Reporting Serious Adverse Events
All new SAEs occurring from the date the participant signs the study consent until 2 months after 
the last intervention or a new treatment is started, whichever comes first, will be reported. The RPCI SAE Source Form is to be completed with all available information, including a brief narrative describing the SAE and any other releva nt information. All SAE’s assessed as related 
to study participation (e.g., protocol-mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to Novartis concomitant medication, will be reported promptly to the Local IRB, NCCN, and Novartis.
SAEs occurring after the 2 month  follow-up period that the investigator determines to be 
possibly, probably or definitely related to the st udy intervention should be reported to NCCN and 
Novartis. All related SAEs should be followed to their resolution, until the study participant is lost to follow-up, the start of a new treatment, or until the study investigator assesses the event(s) as stable or irreversible. New information will be reported when it is received.
SAEs identified as an Unanticipated Problem by the Investigator must be reported. Please refer 
to Section 10.5  for details on reporting Unanticipated Problems.
•For this study, myelosuppression and its associated complications due to this protocol 
therapy are expected events during treatment. Hospitalizations for the treatment of the following events do not require reporting for SAE’s but should be documented as AEs:

event that meets the above criteria. Forms will be submitted to the CRS Compliance Office via email to CRS Compliance@Roswellpark.org. The Compliance office will send the form to the FDA.
11 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING
The RPCI Data and Safety Monitoring Board will assess the progress of the study, the safety 
data, and critical efficacy endpoints. The DSMB will review the study annually and will make recommendations that include but not limited to; (a) continuation of the study, (b) modifications to the design (c) or termination of the study.
12 STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY
The primary objective of this one-arm Phase II trial is to assess the efficacy of the study 
treatment as compared to historical control. Let  represent the proportion of the evaluable 
p
population of interest who experience a complete response within 18 – 22 weeks of the beginning of treatment. A true complete response rate of less than 50% is considered unacceptable. A complete response rate of more than 70% is considered promising and evidence of such will deem the treatment worthy of further study. The null and alternative hypotheses corresponding to the design are
0: 50%,
: 50%.aHpHp≤
>
A total of up to 37 evaluable patients will be accrued. The evaluable population is defined as 
patients who meet eligibility requirements and complete at least once cycle of treatment. Unevaluable patients will be replaced.  The study design will be a Simon (1989) minimax design that proceeds in two stages and stops early only for futility. At the end of the first stage of accrual (23 evaluable patients), data will be reviewed to decide if the study should be terminated due to inactivity of therapy.
12.1 Primary Analysis
Stage 1:  If 12 or less of the first 23 evaluable patients achieves a complete response as measured 
by standard response criteria reported by Cheson et al in 1999
45, it will be concluded that the 
therapy is not promising and the study will end. Otherwise, the study will progress to the second stage. Depending on the current complete response rate at the time the last patient in Stage 1 is APPROVED RP CI IRB

23 patients.
Stage 2:  This study will accrue 14 additional evaluable patients. If 24 or more of the total of 
37evaluable patients achieve a complete response, it will be concluded that  exceeds 50% and p
that the therapy is efficacious and worthy of further study; otherwise, it will be concluded that 
there is no evidence to suggest that the therapy is associated with acceptable efficacy and is not 
promising.
With this design, the probability is 4.8% of falsely concluding that the proportion of objective 
responders exceeds 50% and 80% is the probability of correctly concluding efficacy when the true proportion of objective responders is 70% or higher.
12.2 Sample Size Justification
The sample size calculation is based on testing the hypotheses concerning the proportion of the 
population with a response to the treatment:
0: 50%,
: 50%.aHpHp≤
>
This two-stage design requires a potential total of 37 patients in order to achieve approximately 
80% power to detect differences of 20 percentage points (50% versus 70%).
12.3 Secondary Analyses
Both activity and toxicity rates will be estimated using simple relative frequencies. The 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the estimated probabilities will be computed using the method proposed in Clopper and Pearson.
48 The association between the endpoints and 
collected predictors, such as surface CD20 levels, Ki67, and additional cytogenetic abnormalities, will be statistically assessed using logistic regression. Wald tests of the model effects will be performed to assess statistical significance. See Hosmer and Lemeshow (2000) for a discussion of such techniques.
49 Alternative parametric models will be considered if model fit 
is found to be inadequate.
The estimated distributions of TTP, PFS, and OS will be obtained using the Kaplan-Meier 
method. Estimates of quantities such as median survival will be obtained. Corresponding confidence intervals using the methodology of Brookmeyer and Crowley will be computed.
50  It 
is assumed a priori that any drop out times will be non-informative in terms of the censoring mechanism. Groups defined by levels of categorical or dichotomized predictors, ex. minimal residual disease, will be compared in regards to  time-to-event distributions using the log-rank 
test. Cox proportional hazards model regression will be utilized for multivariate analyses.
Longitudinal analyses such as those used to determine changes in surface CD20 levels, Ki67, or 
gain of additional cytogenetic abnormalities in relapsed/refractory tumor specimens, will be based on standard techniques. A series of graphical analyses will initially take place including individual subject-level profile plots and overall mean plots used to examining the mean structure.

categorical variable. Since repeated measurements will be obtained from each patient, a random subject effect will be added to the model to incorporate the subject-specific dependence, which may exist. Restricted maximum likelihood estimation will be utilized in the model fitting procedures as implemented by SAS PROC MIXED (version 9.2). Once the model is fit, specific linear contrasts based on the estimated model parameters will be constructed and used to test hypotheses concerning between time point comparisons.
All tests performed during the secondary analyses will be two-sided and tested at a 0.05 nominal 
significance level. Standard diagnostic plots will be used to assess model fit and transformations of variables may be considered in order to meet statistical assumptions.
13 CORRELATIVE STUDIES13.1 Central Hypothesis
Based on pre-clinical data, we postulate that the incorporation of ofatumumab into aggressive 
induction chemotherapy in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) will yield higher complete and HSFCM remission rates at the end of induction chemotherapy and prior to stem cell collection in those patients scheduled to undergo HDC-ASCT. This study will determine if achievement of HSFCM remission translates into improved clinical outcomes. In addition, we propose to study biomarkers that may predict clinical response and/or biological response to ofatumumab.
Specifically, this study will study: 1) the relationship between surface CD20 antigen density in 
MCL and the ex vivo activity of ofatumumab vs. rituximab; 2) if complement activation in vivo can be used as a surrogate marker for the activity of ofatumumab in combination with chemotherapy in patients with MCL; and 3) finally, as complementary data, this study will determine at diagnosis and at relapse, whether changes occur in known predictors of clinical outcome of MCL (i.e., Ki67 proliferation index and the acquisition of additional cytogenetic abnormalities besides the t(11:14) (i.e. as P53, 13q (RB and D13S25), 9p (CDKN2A), ATM, MYC).
13.2 STUDY Material To Be Studied
Correlative samples will be collected for patients enrolled into the clinical trial. Tissue, bone 
marrow (BM), and peripheral blood (PB) will be collected at different time intervals (Section 7.4 ).
•Tissue:  Pretreatment and at the time of disease progression excisional (preferable) or core 
biopsy material from either lymph node or any accessible extranodal mass will be submitted for pathological confirmation of MCL, cytogenetic studies, quantification of CD20 levels, ex vivo testing and measurement of biomarkers. Central review of MCL will be performed at RPCI. 
•Bone Marrow Aspirate at Diagnosis and if Positive for Involvement By Lymphoma: Before Cycle 3, before Cycle 5 and prior to stem cell collection or at the end or therapy for 
non-transplant eligible will be evaluated by standard pathological evaluation, cytogenetic APPROVED RP CI IRB

•Peripheral blood will be evaluated for MRD and collected at baseline, prior to Cycle 3, Cycle 5, prior to HDC-ASCT in transplant-eligible patients, and during the post-transplant/therapy surveillance period (on Day 100 and every 6 months for 3 additional years).
13.3 Methodology13.3.1 Correlation Between Baseline Surface CD20 in Mantle Cell Lymphoma Isolated 
From Patients Enrolled in the Clinical Trial and 
Ex Vivo  Ofatumumab 
Anti-Tumor Activity and Clinical Endpoints
Isolation of Malignant Cells:  Malignant B-cells will be isolated by MACS sorting (negative 
selection) from pretreatment biopsy tissue and bone marrow biopsy obtained from enrolled patients with MCL. Samples from patient biopsy specimens will be procured under Institutional Review Board (IRB) RPCI protocols I42804 and I42904 Tissue biopsies will be disrupted by mechanical disruption. Samples will be then diluted with RPMI 1640-containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and the cell suspension filtered through a 100 μm cell strainer to remove 
large clumps. Mononuclear cells (lymphocytes) will be isolated from either tumor cell suspension or bone marrow aspirates by Histopaque-1077 density centrifugation. MCL cells will be then isolated from normal lymphocytes by MACS separation using a human B-cell Isolation Kit II (Miltenyi Biotec, Gladbach, Germany). B-cell purity was assessed by flow cytometry using antibodies to CD19, CD5 and CD20 (Becton Dickenson, San Jose, CA). Collected cells re-suspended in media and used in corresponding experiments.
13.3.2 Surface CD20 Density Analysis by ImageStream
Surface CD20 density analysis by ImageStream will be analyzed by the ImageStream 
Technology from Amnis Inc., which combines the quantitative power of flow cytometry with high content image analysis, giving the visual information obtained from microscope integrated with population statistics. In brief, 2 x 10
6 cells will be stained with a mouse anti-human CD19 
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled monoclonal antibody (mAb), a mouse an anti-human CD20 allophycocyanin (APC) labeled mAb, or proper isotype control(s) and then fixed by 2% paraformaldehyde. Cells will be then illuminated in the ImageStream system by a bright field lamp and the proper wavelength excitation laser for APC. Data will be analyzed by ImageStream IDEAS image analysis software. Cells will be gated for single, focused populations, which will then analyzed for the mean cell size (by mean surface area) and mean surface CD20 expression 
(by mean CD20-FITC intensity). Mean surface CD20 density will be calculated based on the following formula: Surface CD20 density = mean surface CD20-APC intensity/mean surface 
area (CD20-APC per μm
2).
13.3.3 Ex vivo Activity of Ofatumumab in Primary Mantle Cell Lymphoma Cells

51Cr-labeled cells will be then placed in 96-well plates at a cell concentration of 1 x 105 
cells/well and then exposed to ofatumumab (10 μg/mL), rituximab (10 μg/mL) or isotype 
(10 μg/mL) and human serum (1:4 dilution) for 6 hours at 37°C and 5% CO 2 (final volume 
adjusted to 200 μL/well). 51Cr release will be measured from the supernatant by standard gamma 
counter and the percentage of lysis will be calculated as following:
%Lysis = [Test cpm – Background cpm] / [Maximumcpm – Background cpm]
Individual human serum from each patient will be used as source of complement for CMC 
assays.
13.3.4 Degree of In Vivo  Complement Activation and Clinical or Molecular Responses to 
Ofatumumab-Based Therapy in Mantle Cell Lymphoma
Ofatumumab has been demonstrated to elucidate better complement activation and cell lysis 
when compared to rituximab in pre-clinical studies. Complement activation will be measured by a) Total hemolytic complement (CH50); and b) serum C3 and C4 levels at different time intervals (before and after the first and last ofatumumab infusion) as previously described by Byrd et al.
51 CH50, and C3/C4 levels will be performed locally per institute standards.
13.3.5 Measurement of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) by Eight-Color Flow 
Cytometric Analysis
Peripheral blood and/or bone marrow aspirate specimens will be collected at different time 
intervals to measure MRD as previously described.35 Briefly, washed samples will be adjusted to 
10,000 leukocytes/ μL, incubated with mouse IgG to block Fc receptors and stained with the a 
panel of directly conjugated monoclonal antibodies against κ, λ, CD5, CD19, CD20, CD23, 
CD22, and CD79b for 30 minutes followed by incubation with ammonium chloride lysing solution and 2 washing steps. After an incubation with fixable live dead yellow to exclude dead cells the cells will be fixed in 2% formaldehyde and analyzed within 24 hours. Isotope and autofluorescent controls will be included. Data will be collected by a FACSCanto II using DivA 
software v4.6. Instrument sensitivity and intensity settings will be standardized daily with Cytometer Setup and Tracking beads (CS&T) and compensations will be adjusted using single color controls with automated DiVa routines.
13.3.6 Clonal Evolution in Mantle Cell Lymphoma
The spectrum of clinical behavior observed in MCL patients suggests differences exist at the 
molecular level that impact clinical outcomes. Mantle cell lymphoma histologically has a spectrum of variants, including blastoid and pleomorphic variants with high proliferation rates and more aggressive clinical behavior. Aberrant over expression of cyclin D1 is characteristic of MCL and is the result of the t(11;14) (q13;q32). Cyclin D1 binds with CDK4, CDK6 and phosphorylates RB1 ultimately leading to cell cycle dysregulation at G1-S phase transition.
52
Apart from this hallmark translocation few other lymphogenesis phenomena have been described to be responsible for MCL including ATM, CHK2 and p53, which are important in cellular DNA damage response. On the other hand, it is unclear if emergence of resistant disease is associated APPROVED RP CI IRB

previously reported that are genetically altered in MCL are P53, ATM, CDKN2A (p16), del(q13), MYC, among the others.
53 This study will do a cytogenetic/FISH study at the time of 
diagnosis, as well as at the time of relapse utilizing the fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) technique to determine the presence and/or acquisition of the above listed cytogenetic abnormalities. This study will subsequently correlate the cytogenetic findings with clinical outcomes.

each patient or the patient's legally authorized representative in accordance with ICH-GCP guidelines using the approved informed consent form, before any study specific procedures (including screening procedures) are performed. The informed consent form acknowledges all information that must be given to the patient according to ICH-GCP, including the purpose and nature of the study, the expected efficacy and possible side effects of the treatment(s), and specifying that refusal to participate will not influence further options for therapy. Any additional information that is applicable to the study must also be included. Additional national or institutionally mandated requirements for informed consent must also be adhered to. The patient should also be made aware that by signing the consent form, processing of sensitive clinical trial data and transfer to other countries for further processing is allowed.
The Investigator shall provide a copy of the information sheet and of the signed consent form to 
the patient and the signed original shall be ma intained in the Investigator File. A copy of the APPROVED RP CI IRB

from the study and such a decision will not affect any further treatment options.
15 STUDY RESPONSIBILITIES15.1 Data Collection
Data entry into the database is to be completed in a timely fashion (within 30 days) after the 
patient’s clinic visit. If an AE is considered serious it is captured on both the Adverse Event page 
and the Serious Adverse Event Form, which is handled in an expedited fashion (see Section 10 ).
Data management activities will be performed using eClinical. eClinical is a suite of software 
tools that enables the collection, cleaning and viewing of clinical trial data. CRS data management will design the study-specific database and facilitate its development by the eClinical Information Technology team. Once the database design is approved by the Investigator, Statistician, and Clinical Research Coordinator, the database will be put into production and data entry can begin. Data can be entered and changed only by those with the rights to do so into the eCRFs via the EXPeRT Module). eClinical is compliant with all relevant technical aspects of relevant GCP guidelines.
•The system can generate accurate copies of stored data and audit trail information in 
human readable form.
•System access is limited to authorized individuals through the controlled assignment of 
unique ID and password combinations.
•The system is designed to periodically force users to change their passwords and verifies 
that user ID and password combinations remain unique.
•The system automatically generates a permanent time-stamped audit trail of all user 
interactions.
When data entry is complete, data management will review the data and will query any missing, 
incomplete, or invalid data points for resolution by the Clinical Research Coordinator and Investigator. Once all queries have been resolved, the data can be released to the statistician for analysis.
15.2 Maintenance of Study Documents
Essential documents should be retained per RPCI’s policy for 6 years from the study termination 
date. These documents could be retained for a longer period, however, if required by the applicable local regulatory requirements or by an agreement with RPCI. APPROVED RP CI IRB

03/19/18 Page 100 of 109APPENDIX B Screening for Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy During 
Ofatumumab Treatment in B-Cell Lymphoma Patients
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a viral-induced demyelinating disease of 
the central nervous system usually occurring in the immunocompromised individual. JC virus infection resulting in PML and death has been reported in rituximab-treated patients with hematologic malignancies or with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an indication for which rituximab has not been approved. In the literature, PML has been reported to occur in 0.52% of CLL patients and in approximately 5% of fludarabine-treated B-CLL patients. One case of PML was reported in a very ill CLL patient treated with ofatumumab, previously treated with alemtuzumab and fludarabine and with very low CD4 cell count.
Investigators and nurses should pay careful attention for signs and symptoms consistent with a 
diagnosis of PML. Signs and symptoms of PML include visual disturbances, ocular movements, ataxia, and changes in mental status such as disorientation or confusion. These symptoms are not an exhaustive list and the investigator should exercise judgment in deciding to report signs and symptoms to sponsor promptly.
If a patient develops neurological signs or symptoms consistent with PML treatment should be 
halted and the patient referred to a neurologist for evaluation. At a minimum, blood JCV PCR and/or MRI will be performed and if either is positive perform Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) JCV PCR. If blood JCV PCR and MRI are negative, the investigator will contact the NCCN for appropriate action to be taken. If blood JCV PCR and/or MRI are positive, the patient should proceed to the Follow-Up Period. All such patients will be followed until resolution.  Any patient with a diagnosis of PML will be withdrawn from ofatumumab. There are no known tests that can reliably determine who is at increased risk for developing PML. There are no known interventions that can reliably prevent PML or adequately treat PML if it occurs.
Neurological Symptoms Questions YES NO
1. Does the patient report any new weakness?
2. Does the patient report any new difficulty with coordination or walking?3. Does the patient report any new signs of confusion, impaired memory or attention?4. Does the patient appear apathetic compared to previous contacts?5. Does the patient report any new visual disturbances?
6.Has the patient had any new trouble speaking, either slurring speech, difficulty 
getting out words, difficulty understanding words, or difficulty comprehending 
spoken language?
7.Does the patient have any other new neurological symptoms, including but not 
limited to:
New onset seizure.
New sensory loss.
New emotional liability.
If any of the above are answered “Yes” at any visit, the investigator will refer the patient to a neurologist.APPROVED RP CI IRB

03/19/18 Page 101 of 109APPENDIX C Ofatumumab Liver Interruption/Stopping Criteria for Oncology 
Studies (Updated May 2011)
Based upon SRT discussion and agreement on 16 February 2011 and 03 March 2011, the 
following Liver Interruption/Stopping criteria were established for use in all ofatumumab oncology trials including CRTs. These criteria were initially discussed with Novartis for OMB110911. The criteria are required for all future  ofatumumab oncology protocols (including 
this clinical trial).
CRITERIA 1:  ALT > 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and bilirubin > 2 x ULN (> 35% direct 
bilirubin; bilirubin fractionation required‡). ‡ NOTE: If serum bilirubin fractionation not 
immediately available, study drug should be discontinued if ALT > 3 x ULN and bilirubin > 2 x ULN. Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available. If testing unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick, indicating direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury.
CRITERIA 2:  ALT > 8 x ULN.
CRITERIA 3:  ALT > 5 x ULN for more than 2 weeks.
Liver Chemistry Interruption/Stopping and Follow- up Criteria have been designed to 
assure patient safety and evaluate liver event etiology.  The site investigator in conjunction 
with the Principal Investigator at RPCI will review all events which meet liver chemistry stopping criteria to determine if the event was due to tumor lysis, disease related liver involvement, concomitant chemotherapy or other identified cause and to exclude drug induced liver injury (DILI) due to ofatumumab. If the event is determined to be due to causes other than ofatumumab DILI and improvement is observed after withdrawal of ofatumumab, rechallenge may be attempted if deemed appropriate by the principal investigator and in addition to consent of the patient. 
When any of the liver chemistry stopping criteria is met, do the following:Immediately stop study treatment.Report the event to NCCN within 24 hours of learning its occurrence.Hold ofatumumab for 2 weeks, repeat liver chemistry testing at least twice weekly, and call the 
Principal Investigator at RPCI to discuss the possibility of re-challenging with ofatumumab. Note: The 2 week time point for stopping medication was chosen because it will distinguish from LFT elevations due to tumor lysis, which should have resolved within this time period.  Medication is interrupted and it is a clinical and patient decision if ofatumumab may be re-started.  The risk:benefit ratio is different in an oncology setting and an efficacious therapy may be life-saving.
Report SAE to NOVARTIS within 24 hours.All events of ALT > 3 x ULN and bilirubin > 2 x ULN (> 35% direct bilirubin) (or 
ALT > 3 x ULN and INR > 1.5, if INR measured; INR measurement is not required and the threshold value stated will not apply to patients receiving anticoagulants), termed ‘Hy’s Law’, must be reported as an SAE (excluding studies of hepatic impairment or cirrhosis).APPROVED RP CI IRB

03/19/18 Page 102 of 109NOTE: if serum bilirubin fractionation is not immediately available, study treatment should be 
discontinued if ALT > 3 x ULN and bilirubin > 2 x ULN. Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available. If testing is unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick, indicating direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury.
Liver chemistry follow-up assessments are to be  followed until liver chemistries resolve, 
stabilize or return to baseline values.
Liver Chemistry Follow-up Assessments: (these chemistry tests/ assessments below are to be 
performed at the time of the event and then continued and/or discontinued at the discretion/judgment of the sponsor-investigator; please refer to stopping criteria within this document below).
Viral hepatitis serology including:Hepatitis A IgM antibodyHepatitis B surface antigen and Hepatitis B Core Antibody (IgM)Hepatitis C RNACytomegalovirus IgM antibodyEpstein-Barr viral capsid antigen IgM antibody (or if unavailable, obtain heterophile antibody or 
monospot testing)
Hepatitis E IgM antibodySerum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).Fractionate bilirubin, if total bilirubin > 2 x ULN.Obtain complete blood count with differential to assess eosinophilia.Record the appearance or worsening clinical symptoms of hepatitis, or hypersensitivity, fatigue, 
decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, fever, or rash.
Record use of concomitant medications, acetaminophen, herbal remedies, other over the counter 
medications, or putative hepatotoxins.
Increased alcohol use.The following assessments are required for patients with ALT > 3 x ULN and 
bilirubin > 2 x ULN (35% direct) but are optional for other abnormal liver chemistries:
Anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, and Type 1 anti-liver kidney microsomal 
antibodies.
Liver imaging (ultrasound, magnetic resonance, or computerized tomography) to evaluate liver 
disease.

monitoring.
A specialist or hepatology consultation is recommended.Monitor patients twice weekly until liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, 
bilirubin) resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline values.
For patients meeting Criteria 2 or 3:A repeat of liver chemistries within 24 hours to 72 hours for repeat liver chemistries and liver 
event follow-up assessments.
Monitor patients weekly until liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin) 
resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline values.
After holding ofatumumab for 2 weeks:If the treatment is exhibiting efficacy and the patient wants to continue therapy after being 
informed of the results of liver chemistry testing, then the ofatumumab may be re-started.
Liver chemistries and follow-up assessments should be monitored at a minimum of every 2 
weeks until resolution, stabilization, or a return to baseline values, at which point monitoring should be continued per protocol.
Patients with ALT > 3 x ULN but ALT < 5 x ULN and bilirubin < 2 x ULN without hepatitis 
symptoms or rash, and who may be monitored weekly for at least 4 weeks, then the following actions should be taken:
Patients can continue ofatumumab.Weekly repeat of liver chemistries until they resolv e, stabilize, or return to baseline values, then 
monitor liver chemistries as per protocol assessment schedule.
If at any time the patient meets any of the liver chemistry stopping criteria, then proceed as 
described above.
If after 4 weeks of monitoring, ALT < 3 x ULN and bilirubin < 2 x ULN monitor twice monthly 
until liver chemistries normalize or return to within baseline values.APPROVED RP CI IRB

A3.1  For processing a fresh lymph node or extra-nodal mass biopsy material for pathological 
diagnosis and correlative science experiments .
A3.1.1 Applicable to:
•To be performed in patients that the original biopsy was not sufficient for complete diagnosis or 
patients with accessible lymph nodes consenting for a repeat biopsy to complete correlative studies (i.e. ex vivo testing, as all other studies can be performed from archived material).
•To be performed in all patients with suspected relapsed/refractory disease after ofatumumab-hyper-
CVAD/ofatumumab-HD-MA or during the follow up period (including after HDC-ASCT if eligible).
A3.2.1 Procedure(s):
The pathologist will first make 6 touch preparations  to confirm the presence of representative tissue 
adequate for evaluation. Tissue will then be divided as follows:
1. Sufficient tissue to clinical pathology to be formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded 
for morphology and immunohistochemistry2. Fresh tissue in RPMI 10%FCS for ex vivo studies to the RPCI Lymphoma/Myeloma Laboratory CCC Bldg. 3rd Floor, Rm 304 [RPCI patients only]
3. If sufficient tissue remains, submit fresh in % RPMI 10%FCS to the RPCI 
Cytogenetics Lab.
To isolate B-cells by negative 
selection for
 ex vivo  studies 
(RPCI patients only)

A3.2  For processing archived lymph node or extra-nodal mass biopsy material for pathological 
diagnosis and correlative science experiments  
A3.2.2 Applicable to:
•To be performed in all patients during the registration period (See Section 7.1 ).
•Material to be submitted: tissue block (preferable) or 10 – 20 unstained slides cut at 4 μm on 
positively charged slides for pathological examination.
•If nodal/extranodal fresh tissue is not available, but involved bone marrow at diagnosis with MCL 
specimen had been procured, cytogenetic studies can be performed from such material and must be submitted. FISH can also be performed on unstained FFPE sections from diagnostic sample, cut at 4 μm and placed on positively charged slides.APPROVED RP CI IRB

03/19/18 Page 108 of 109APPENDIX G Reproductive Potential and Contraceptive Methods
Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as all women physiologically 
capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of 
contraception throughout the study and for 6 months after study drug discontinuation. Highly effective contraception methods  include:
•Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.
•Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or 
without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.
•Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients 
on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.
•Combination of any of the two following (a+b or a+c or b+c)
a. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or 
other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate <1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception
b. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)c. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm 
or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository
 In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same 
pill before taking study treatment.5/14/2018

03/19/18 Page 109 of 109Note:  Oral contraceptives are allowed but should be used in conjunction with a 
barrier method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction.
Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they 
have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.
Sexually active males should not father a child unless they use a condom during 
intercourse while taking the drug and 3 months after stopping treatment. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.  Sexually active mails should not donate sperm while taking the drug and 3 months after stopping treatment.APPROVED RP CI IRB

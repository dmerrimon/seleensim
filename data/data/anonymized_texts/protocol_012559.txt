Section 9.4.1 Treatment(s) Administered: Text added to allow for the local
procurement of commercial comparator treatments as necessary .
Appendix 4: To add the standard of care that is recommended by sponsor. 
18 Oct 2018 Amendment 02 : 
Title page: The IND number was added.
Synopsis (Study Design) and Section 9.1:  Clarity was added regarding the 
study design, process of ICF signing, and intention of non -interruption of 
treatment during a subject’ s transitioning from the parent study to Study 
E7080- G000 -604.
Section 9.1 (Figure 1) : The figure was updated to clarify that the screening 
period for the study will overlap with the end of the parent study , and 
accordingly , subjects may remain on the parent study during the screening 
period.   Also,the footnote was updated to state that the Screening Period is 
“Approximately from Day 30 to Day 1).”
Section 9.4.1 :  It was c larified that subjects must not be dispensed more 
than a 3-months (formerly , 2 months) supply of study drug(s) at any 
particular time during participation in this study .
Section 9.5.10 :  Study discontinuation criteria were harmonized with the 
synopsis.
Synopsis (Inclusion Criteria):  The statement “Subjects must be rolled over 
within 30 days of termination from their parent study” was deleted to 
harmonize with inclusion criteria in the protocol, since this was left in the 
previous 
amendment in error.
The ICH definition was updated to match the current ICH definition on the 
title page, abbreviation list, Section 5.2, and investigator signature p age.
25 Jan 2018 Amendment 01: 
The main reason for the protocol amendment is to align the safety data 
collection in the study with the FDA guidance for long -term safety data 
collection for oncology studies.
Accordingly, the protocol has been updated to define that only 
treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events 
(SAEs) will be collected for all patients. 
It has been clarified that all safety related examinations (including vital 
signs, physical examination, electrocardiogram [ECG], 
echocardiogram [ECHO], multigated acquisition scan [MUGA], 
laboratory investigations should be performed as per local standard of 
care or as clinically indicated, and should be reported in the case report 
form (CRF) only if associated with an adverse event (AE/SAE) (ie, 
only the AE should be recorded in the CRF). Accordingly, all

references to these procedures providing specific guidance on conduct 
of these procedures and statistical reporting in the study w ere deleted. 
Routine reporting of concomitant medications in the study CRF has 
been deleted. 
Other global updates were made to the protocol as follows:
The terminology “study” has been used throughout to replace “trial .”
AE has been updated throughout the protocol to TEAE.
Major revisions to individual sections are presented below:
The a bbreviation list was updated.
The a pproximate n umber of sites and investigators initially planned for the 
study was updated from 100 sites and 100 investigators to 50 sites and 
50investigators (Synopsis ).
The primary objective was harmonized between the Synopsis and 
Section 8.1, and the term “Eisai -sponsored lenvatinib studies ”was 
harmonized globally in the protocol .
The definition of “Parent study ”was added in Section 9.1and the 
Synopsis.
Figure 1was updated in Section 9.1to present all criteria for 
discontinuation.
It was emphasized that the subject will not be without study drug during 
transition from the parent study to the roll -over study.  Also ,the timeline of 
30days from termination in the parent study toenrollment in the roll -over 
study was deleted (Synopsis and Section 9.1).”
It was clarified in Section 9.1and Synopsis that the SAE management and 
reporting requirements specific to study drugs will be as per the parent 
study protocol.  It was a lso clarified that ongoing adver se events ( AEs)in 
the parent study will remain ongoing at the time of discontinuation in the 
parent study, and that the roll -over study will only c apture new or 
worsening TEAEs occurring after signing the ICF for the roll-over study.
The numbe r of sub jects expected to initially roll over into the study was 
updated from 200 to 50 in Section 9.3and Synopsis.
Inclusion criterion 2 “Demonstrate compliance with study drug(s), 
treatment visit schedules, requirements and restrictions listed in the consent 
form” in Section 9.3.1 and Synopsis was deleted ,and the following
inclusion criterion was added “Must be able and willing to comply with the
current roll-over protocol requirements .”
All references to parent study protocols being included in the protocol 
appendices for E7080- G000 -604 were deleted since the parent study 
protocols are not included in the protocol appendices for E7080 -G000 -604 
(Section s 9.1.1 ,9.5.9.1 , 9.5.9.2 , and Synopsis).

number )will be recorded in the CRF (Section 9.4.1 and Section 9.4.4 , 
respectively).
Also, the following was added in Section 9.4.1 : Subject must not be 
dispe nsed more than 2 months supply of study drug(s) at any particular 
time during participation in Study E7080- G000 -604.
Recording in the study of all prior medications administered 30 days before 
first dose of study drug, any concomitant therapy until 30 days after the 
final dose of study drug, and any other diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical 
procedures relating to malignancy was deleted , and it was clarified that if 
concomitant medication/therapy is administered for an AE, investigators 
will record that AE on the Adverse Event CRF (Section 9.4.2.4 [Prior and 
Concomitant Therapy] and Synopsis ). 
The prohi bited concomitant therapies and drugs in Section 9.4.2.6 and 
Synopsis were harmonized .  Also, it was clarified that palliative 
radiotherapy of painful pre -existing non -target bone metastases will be 
permitted without being considered progressive dis ease. This is in line with 
the current lenvat inib protocols.
The r equir ement for a copy of the certification and a table of the normal 
laboratory ranges for the reference laboratory conducting the clinical 
laboratory tests required by this protocol was deleted since laboratory tests 
are not mandatory per protocol and will be performed as per local 
standards or only when clinically indicated [Section 9.4.4 (Drug Supplies 
and Accountability]).
Clarified in Section 9.4.1 and Section 9.2that subjects rolling over to the 
study will continue receiving (in addition to lenvatinib or lenvatinib
combination regimen) any othe rcomparator therapy (except placebo).  It 
was a lso added in Section 9.5.7.1 that,for this study ,the study drugs 
include any other comparator therapy (except placebo) (in addition to

Clarified that only TEAEs will be collected in the stu dyand definition of 
TEAE added (Section 9.5.7.1 ).
Specific guidance and details on conduct of laboratory tests (including the 
names of the laboratory parameters [formerly Table 2] ), procedure for vital 
signs and weight measurements, conduct of physical examination, and 
ECG recording was deleted (Sections 9.5.7.5 , 9.5.7.6 , 9.5.7.7 , and 9.5.7.8 , 
respectively , and Synopsis ) and it has been mentione d that these 
procedures and assessments should be performed per local standard of care 
or as clinically indicated.  It was also specified that for vital signs and 
ECG, only changes from screening vital sign s or ECG findings that meet 
the definition of a TEAE will be recorded on the AE CRF (Section 9.5.7.6
and 9.5.7.8 ).
Table 3 (Schedule of Pro cedures and Assessments ; Section 9.5.8.1 ) was 
deleted and replaced with the following statement:

standard of care or as clinically indicated
Reasons for discontinuation of the subjects from the study were 
harmonized between Section 9.1.1 , Section 9.5.10 , Figure 1(Section 9.1) 
and Synopsis.  Additional criterion of pregnancy mentioned inSection 
9.5.10 was d eleted ( as it was added in error ).
Reporti ng for TEAEs and SAEs throughout the protocol was harmonized 
in Sections 9.1, 9.5.7.1 , and Synopsis as follows:
All TEAEs and SAEs, rega rdless of relationship to study drug or 
procedure, should be recorded beginning from the time the subject signs
the roll -over study informed consent form (ICF) for up to 28 days after the 
last dose of stud y drug(s) (or 5 × half -life of the study drug [s], whichever is 
longer).
Statistical analysis:
Thestudy analysis set was updated from the “all treated population” to the 
“Safety Analysis Set” in Section 9.7and the Synopsis ,and the set was 
defined as the group of subjects who received at least 1 dose of study 
drug(s).
It was clarified that only demog raphic characteristics will be reported in the 
study and “other baseline characteristics ” wasdeleted (Section 9.7.1.3 ).
Former Section 9.7.1.3 (Prior and Concomitant Therapy) was deleted since 
this data will not be collected in the study.
Section 9.7.1.6 (Safety Analyses) was modified to reflect that only TEAE 
and SAEs will be summarized.  Laboratory test results, physical 
examination findings, vital signs, and echocardiogram results were deleted 
as these assessments will not be summarized in the study re port (also 
deleted from Section 9.7).

The definition of TEAE was updated in Section 9.7.1.8 as follows:
An AE that emerges during treatment in the roll -over study , having been 
absent before the time the sub
ject signs the roll-over study ICF or
Re-emer ges during treatment in the roll -over study , having been 
present before signing the ICF but stopped before signing the ICF, or 
Worsens in severity during treatment in the roll -over study relative to 
the pre- ICF state, when the AE is continuous.
It was added that for the TEAEs, the incidence, sever ity, duration and 
timing in relation to the start of stud y medication will be summarized.
Since the subjects are not required to adhere to a specific visit schedule, the 
following sentence was deleted from Section 9.5.10 , “All subjects who 
discontinue th e study are to complete the study’s early discontinuation 
procedures indicated in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments found in

Study Design
This is an open -label extension study to roll-over eligible subjects from Eisai sponsored lenvatinib
studies.  The subject can be enrolled in the roll-over study for thepurpose of long-term safety data 
collection .  The subjects may roll-over no sooner than the primary completion dates in their parent 
study or after all study data for primary outcome measure were collected for the parent study .  The 
parent study is defined as the Eisai -sponsored lenvatinib clinical study in which the subject was 
receiving lenvatinib either as monotherapy or as combination therapy or was receiving any other  
comparator therapy.  The subjects willing to participate in the roll -over study have to sign the ICF for 
Study E7080- G000 -604.  The “End of Treatment” assessments in the parent study are to be completed 
and reviewed by the investigator prior to enrollment of the subject into Study E7080- G000 -604.  
Eligibility for the roll-over study is to be established based on meet ing all inclusion and exclusion 
criteria for Study E7080- G000 -604.  The intention is that the subject will not be without study drug 
during transition from the parent study to the roll -over study .  The subjects in Study E7080- G000 -604
should receive the first dose of the study drug the following day after the last dose of the study drug in 
the parent study .  All treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) , 
regardless of relationship to study drug or procedure, should be recorded beginning from the time the 
subject signs the roll -over study ICF for up to 28 days after the last dose o f study drug(s) (or 5 × half -
life of the study drug [s], whichever is longer ).

Eligible subjects from Eisai sponsored studies for lenvatinib will be rolled over to the appropriate 
cohort and continue receiving the study drug(s) as described in the above -mentioned sections.
Dose Modifications
Dose reduction and interruption to study drug(s), will be in accordance with the parent study
protocol.  If a subject is receiving more than one study drug, the investigator will decide the 
probability and causality of the event being related to one or both drugs.  The investigator will also 
decide if dose modification of one or both drugs is required .
Dose reductions will apply to individual subjects only.  Once the dose has been reduced, it cannot be 
increased at a later date unless the dose was mistakenly decreased; in this situation, the sponsor’s 
approval is required to increase the dose.
Details reg arding the management of important identified risks associated with the use of study 
drug(s) will be in accordance with the parent study protocol .
Duration of Treatment
A subject will remain on study drug(s) until 1 or more of the following events occur(s):

INTRODUCTION
Lenvat inibis an invest igational tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI)agent and it has completed 
clinical registrati onstudi esfor the treatment of radio iodine
-refractory  different iated thy roid 
cancer ( RR-DTC )and unresectable Hepatocellular Carcino ma. Moreover, a mult icenter, 
open -label, rando mized, Phase 3 trial is ongoing to compare the efficacy and safet y of 
lenvat inib in co mbinat ion with everolimus or pembro lizumab versus sunit inib alo ne in 
first-line treatment of subjects with advanced renal cell carcino ma(E7080 -G000 -307).  
Based on its efficacy and safet y profile , lenvat inib was granted approval to treat patients with 
progressive, DTC whose disease progressed despit e receiving radioactive iodine therapy
disease (Lenvima approval for DTC ,13 Feb 2015 ).  Mo reover , lenvatinib was approved for 
use in co mbination wit h everolimus (Afini tor®) in the treatment of advanced renal cell 
carcino ma following one pri or anti angiogenic therapy (FDA Approved Drugs ,13 May  
2016) . 
The activit y of lenvat inib for treatm ent of patients with advanced, progressive DTC 
unresponsive to convent ional radio iodine therapy  has been ini tially established in a Phase
2 
trial E7080 -G000 -201, whi ch enrolled 58 patients with RR -DTC ( Cabanillas , et al ., 201 5)
and 59 patients with medullary thyro id cancer.  The primary efficacy endpo int of this study  
was the obj ective response rate (ORR) based on the assessments by the independent imaging 
review using modified Response Evaluat ion Cri teria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ).  In the RR -
DTC cohort, the ORR was 50%; 59% in pat ients wit h prior VEGF/VEGFR -targeted 
treatment and 46% in patients without prior vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF )/
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR )-targeted therapy .  The m edian est imate 
of progressi on-free survival (PFS), at a minimum follow- up of  14 m onths, was 12. 6months.  
The 6 -months PFS rate was 78% and the 12 -months PFS rate was 55%.  The overall survival

Eisai
Final: 10 Mar 202 1Confidential Page 23of 58(OS) rate was 86% at 12 months and was 78% at both 18 and 24 months.  The most 
frequently reported (>40% of all pat ients) treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs) were 
diarrhea, hypertensio n, proteinuria, fat igue, weight decreased, decreased appetite, nausea, 
headache, cough, and dy sphonia.  In the DTC cohort, the most commo nly reported Grade 3 
TEAEs (occurring in approximately 10% of patients) were hy pertens ion, weight decrease, 
diarrhea, and proteinuria. 
The efficacy and safet y of lenvatinib treatm ent has al so been evaluated in the mult icenter, 
rando mized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase 3 trial E7080 -G000 -303 (SELECT trial) 
in patients with RR -DTC w ith docum ented di sease progressi on wi thin 13 m onths.  Pati ents 
were stratified by  age (≤65, >65 y ears), regi on and ≤1 prior VEGFR -targeted therapies and 
rando mized 2:1 to lenvat inib or placebo arms (24 mg a day , 28-day cycle).  The primary  
endpo int was PFS assessed by Independent Radio logic Review; the secondary endpoints 
included ORR (ie, complete response [CR] + partial response [ PR]), OS, and safet y.  A total  
of 392 pati ents (63.0 y ears m edian age; 51.0% male) were randomized at over 100 sites in 
Europe, North and South America, and Asia.  Patients in the lenvat inib arm had a 
significant ly pro longed PFS (hazard ratio = 0.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.14 –0.31; 
P<0001) wi th a median PFS for the lenvat inib arm of 18.3 months (95% CI = 15.1
–not 
evaluab
le) vs the placebo arm: 3.6 months (95% CI = 2.2–3.7).  The lenvat inib arm PFS 
benefit was observed in all predefined subgroups:  median lenvat inib arm PFS for patients 
with prior vs no pri or VEGF -therapy  was 15.1 m onths (n=66) and 18.7 months (n=195), 
respectively; rates (n) of CRs for the lenvat inib arm vs placebo arm were 1.5% (4) and 0, 
respectively; PRs for the lenvatinib arm vs the placebo arm were 63.2% (165) and 1.5% (2), 
respectively .  Median exposure durations for the lenvat inib arm vs the pl acebo arm were 13.8 
months and 3.9 months, respectively; median time to lenvatinib response was 2.0 months.  
Median OS has not been reached; deaths for the lenvat inib arm were 71 (27.2%) and for the 
placebo arm  were 47 (35.9%).  The 5 most commo n lenvat inib tre atment-related adverse 
events (AEs) (any grade) were hypertension (68%), diarrhea (59%), appetite decreased 
(50%), weight loss (46%), nausea (41%).  The most common Grade ≥3 lenvatinib treatm ent-
related AEs ( ≥5%) were hy pertensio n (42%), proteinuria (10%), weight loss (10%), diarrhea 
(8%), and appetite decreased (5%).  The lenvat inib dose was reduced in 78.5% of patients 
and lenvat inib was discont inued due to AEs in 14.2% of patients ( Schlumberger, et al., 
2014) . Based on the efficacy and safet y information to date, patients with RR -DTC m ay 
benefit from lenvat inib treatment. 
In regards to efficacy and safet y in RCC , the Phase 2 porti on of  Study  E7080 -G000 -205
enrolled 153 patients with advanced or metastatic, clear- cell, RCC who had a history  of 
receiving 1 prior VEGF agent. A total of 153 patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 
receive treatment with lenvatinib plus evero limus, lenvat inib (24 mg once d aily [QD]), or 
evero limus (10 mg QD). The safet y profile for l envat inib plus everolimus was consistent 
with the known toxic effects of each individual agent, with no unexpected TEAEs observed. 
The m ost comm on TEAEs of any grade in the lenvatinib plus ever olimus arm were diarrhea 
and fatigue or asthenia. Grade 3 and 4 events occurred in fewer pat ients allocated single -
agent evero limus (25 [50%]) compared with those assigned lenvat inib alo ne (41 [79%]) or 
lenvat inib plus everolimus (36 [71%]).  The most comm on Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs in patients 
allocated lenvat inib plus everolimus was diarrhea (10 [20%]), in those assigned single -agent

was anemia (6 [12%]). Two deaths wer e deem ed rel ated to study  drug ,1 cerebral 
hemorrhage in the lenvat inib plus everolimus group and 1 myocardial  infarcti on wi th single -
agent l envat inib ( Motzer, et al ., 2015a ).
In regards to efficacy and safet y in unresectable HCC, lenvat inib has been evalua ted in the 
Phase 3 study  of “A Mult icenter, Randomized, Open- Label , Phase 3 Trial  to Com pare the 
Efficacy and Safet y of Lenvati nib (E7080) Versus Sorafenib in First -Line Treatment of 
Subjects Wit h Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma ”(E7080 -G000 -304). This was a
non-inferiorit y study  of patients who had unresectable HCC wit h ≥ 1 m easurable target 
lesion, Barcel ona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C, Child -Pugh cl ass A, Eastern Cooperative 
Onco logy Group (ECOG )PS ≤ 1, and with no prior systemic therapy. Among 954 enrolled
patients , 478 patients received lenvat inib while 476 received sorafenib and were rando mized 
1:1 to l envatinib (body weight ≥ 60 kg: 12 mg/day; < 60 kg: 8 mg/day) or the comparator 
arm of sorafenib 400 mg twi ce daily. The efficacy of lenvat inibhas been demonstrated to be 
non-inferior in terms of OS, and achieved statistically  significant and clinically meaningful 
improvements in PFS, time to progression (TTP) and ORR by  modified RECIST as first line 
therapy  for unresectable hepatocellular carcino ma. The TEAEs were consistent with the 
known lenvat inibsafety profile. Most common lenvat inib TEAEs were hypertensio n (42%), 
diarrhea (39%), decreased appetite (34%), decreased weight (31%), and fatigue (30%)
(Cheng ,et al., 2017). As there are patients who are continuing treatm ent from several  
ongoing clinical  studi es of different phases in the lenvat inib program a tEisai, the “roll-over” 
study  will allow those pati ents to continue to receive their treatments of lenvat inib as 
monotherapy  or in co mbinat ion regimen provided that they  are deriving clinical benefit .  
Long -term safet y will be assessed in patients in this study .
STUDY OBJECTIVES
8.1 Primary Objective
The primary  object ive is to assess long -term safet y of study  drug(s) in subj ects who are 
enrolled in Eisai -sponsored lenvat inibstudi es.
8.2 Secondary Objective (s)
Not applicable.
INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This is an open -label extensio n study to roll -over eligible subjects fro m Eisai sponsored 
lenvat inib studi es.  The subject can be enrolled in the roll -over study  for the purpose of 
long-term safet y data collection. Thetransi tion woul d occur after the completion and 
evaluat ion of the primary  endpoint of the parent studies or after all study  data for the primary 
outcom e measure were evaluated for the parent study .  The parent study is defined as the

comparator arm to receive lenvatinib combination therapy in their parent study will continue 
to receive lenvatinib combina tion therapy
Cohort C: Subjects who received comparator treatment in their parent study will continue to 
receive comparator treatment, with exception of subjects receiving placebo*
Discontinuation criteria : progr ession of disease, unacceptable toxicity, subject request, 
withdrawal of consent, termination of study by sponsor, use of non -permitted concomitant 
drugs, unacceptable non -compliance with the protocol, subject lost to follow -up.
Subjects will be permitted to continue study drug(s) beyond initial disease progression as 
long as the treating investigator considers that there is continued clinical benefit after 
discussing with the sponsor and if the subject is tolerating the study drug(s).
* Subjects who received placebo in their parent study and who were either not permitted to 
cross over or who opted not to cross over to active treatment will not be eligible to enroll in 
this study. 
9.1.1 Treatment Phase
During the Treatment Phase, subjects still on treatment will cont inue the same treatment they 
receiv ed upon discont inuat ion of the parent study. Subjects will remain on treatment in 
consecut ive cycles as per the parent study protocol until disease progression, development of 
unaccep table toxicity, subject request, withdrawal of consent, discont inuat ion of Study  
E7080 -G000 -604 by the sponsor , use of non -permitted concomitant drugs, unacceptable 
non-compliance with the protocol, or if the subject is lost to fo llow-up. 
9.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Groups
Subjects will enter the study  at the same doses of study  drug of l envat inib or the combinat ion 
regimen , or any  other com parator therapy  (except pl acebo), upon discontinuation of the 
parent study .  
This is a roll -over open -label study  with no control  group. 
9.3 Selection of Study Population
It is expected that a pproximately 50 subjects willbe init ially rolled over to the study. It is 
anticipated that addit ional subjects may also roll over to the study  in the future.  Subjects 
who meet all of t he inclusio n criteria and none of the exclusio n criteria,with no evi dence of 
progressive disease ,and who have tolerated study  drug(s) in thei r parent study without 
significant toxicitieswill be rolled over to th is study. Subjects with evidence o f disease 
progression but who continue to derive clinical benefit as determined by the invest igator 
woul d requi re discussi on with the sponsor on an individual case -by-case basis prior to 
enrollment inthis study .
9.3.1 Inclusion Criteria
It is requi red for all  subjects currently participating in other lenvat inib studi es to meet the 
following eligibilit y criteria prior to entry  in the study .

Any medicat ion that i s considered necessary  for the subject’s healt h and that i s not expected 
to interfere with the evaluation of or interact with lenvat inib or wi th thelenvatinib
combinat ion regimen as per the parent study  may be cont inued during the study.
Treatment of complicat ions or AEs, or therapy  to ameli orate symptoms (including blood 
products, blood trans fusions, fluid transfusio ns, antibiotics, and ant idiarrheal drugs), may be 
given at the discret ion of the investigator, unless it is expected to interfere with the evaluation 
of (or to interact with ) lenvat inib.
If a subject is receiving treatment with len vatinib and requires surgery during the study, the
stop time and restart time of lenvat inib shoul d be as follows:
For minor procedures: stop lenvatinib at least 2 days before the procedure and restart it at 
least 2 day s after, once there is evidence of adequate healing and no risk o f bleeding.
For m ajor procedures: stop l envat inib at least 1 week (5 half -lives) prior to surgery  and
then restart it at least 1 week after, once there is evidence o f adequate healing and no risk
of bleeding.
Aspirin, nonstero idal anti-inflamma tory drugs (NSAIDs), and low -molecular -weight heparin 
(LMWH) are permissible but should be used with caution.  Granulocyte colony -stimulat ing 
factor (g-CSF) or equivalent may be used in accordance with American Societ y of Clinical  
Onco logy (ASCO), institutional, or national guidelines.  Ery thropoi etin may be used

9.4.1.5 Drug -Drug Interactions
Lenvat inib’s weak in vitro inhibitory and induct ion potential on cy tochrom e P450 enzymes 
(CYP P450) (Study  No. XT063020) suggests a low risk of lenvat inib interference wit h the
PK of other drugs metabolized by CYP P450 enzymes which are co -administered in usual
clinic practice. Nonclinical studies ident ify CYP3A4 as the important CYP isozyme
responsible for human hepat ic met abolism o f lenvati nib. However, clinical studies
conducted showed that co -administration of lenvatinib wit h CYP3A4/P -glycoprotein (P -gp)
inhibitors or inducers is not of clinical concern. The main metabo lic pathways for lenvat inib
in humans were ident ified as enzymat ic (C YP3A and aldehyde oxidase) and non -enzymat ic
processes ( LENVIMA®Package Insert ). Please refer to Appendix 1 and
http://medicine .iupui.edu/clinpharm /ddis/ for the most current informat ion.
For subjects receiving evero limus, drugs or substances (including herbal supplements or
grapefruit juice) known to be poten t inhibi tors of  CYP3A4/P -gp shoul d not be used. Potent
inducers o f CYP3A4/P -gp shoul d not be used unless there is no alternat ive treatment
available. Moderate/ weak inhibitors or inducers or substrates of CYP3A4 and/or P -gp
shoul d be used wi th caution.  Dose reduction of everolimus may  be considered when
coadministering moderate CYP3A4 or P -gp inhibit ors. For further informat ion please refer 
tothe prescribing information.   
No form al pharmacokinet ic drug interaction studies have 
been conducte d withpembro lizumab. Pembro lizumab is a monoclonal ant ibody ; 
pharmacokinet ic interacti onswith lenvat inib (and vice -versa) are not expected.   Strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole may  increase sunit inib plasma concentrations. 
CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin may  decrease suni tinib plasma concentrations. Select ion 
of an al ternate concomi tant m edicat ion with no or minimal  enzyme inhibit ion or induct ion is 
recommended. A dose reduction for sunit inib to a minimum o f37.5 m g daily shoul d be 
considere d if suni tinib m ust be co -administered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. A dose 
increase for sunit inib to a maximum of 87.5 mg daily should be considered if sunit inib must 
be co -administered with a CYP3A4 inducer .  If dose is increased, the patient should be 
monitored carefully  for toxi city.  In regards, to lenvat inib combinat ion regimen, please refer 
to drug -drug interactio ns sect ion in the parent study.

9.5.7.1 Adverse Events
An adverse event ( AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigat ion subject administered an invest igational produc t.  An AE does not necessarily 
have a causal relat ionship with the medicinal product.  For this study , the study  drug (s) is/are 
lenvat inib,or lenvat inib combination regimen , or any  other com parator therapy  (except 
placebo) as per the parent study .
AEs co llected in this study must be treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAE). This is 
defined as an AE that emerges during treatment in the roll -over study , having been absent 
before the time the subject signs the roll-over study ICF or
Re-emerges during treatment in the roll -over study , having been present before signing 
the ICF but stopped before signing the ICF , or 
Worsens in severit y during treatment in the roll -over study  relative to the pre-ICF state, 
when the AE is continuous.
The cri teria for identifying TEAEs in this study  are:
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), 
symptom, or disease tem porally  associated wi th the use of an invest igational product, 
whether or not considered related to the invest igational product
Any new disease or exacerbat ion of an existing disease .

clinical test (eg, ECG or x -ray) that resul ts in symptom s, a change in treatment, or 
discontinuat ion of study  drug
Recurrence of an intermittent medical condit ion (eg, headache) not present pretreatment 
(Baseline)
An abnormal laboratory  test resul t shoul d be considered a TEAE if the ident ified 
laboratory  abnorm ality leads to any  type of intervent ion, withdrawal of study  drug, or 
withhol ding of study  drug , whether pr escribed in the protocol or not
A laboratory  resul t shoul d be considered by  the investi gator to be a TEAE if it:
Results in the wit hdrawal o f study  drug
Results in wit hholding of study  drug pending some invest igational outcome
Results in an intervention, based on medical evaluation (eg, potassium supplement for
hypokal emia
Results in any out -of-range l aboratory  value that in the investigator’s judgment fulfills 
the definit ions of a TEAE with regard to the subject’s medical pro file
Increases in severit y compared to the pre -ICF state by 2 or more CTCAE grades ( Table 1
and Appendix 2 for CTCAE v4.03), with the exception of lymphocy tes, albumin, 
cholesterol , glucose, and phosphate. For these tests, any change of 2 or more grades will 
be evaluated by  the invest igator to determine if it is of clinical significance and, if so, will 
be considered a TEAE
All TEAEs and SAEs , regardl ess of relat ionship to study  drug or procedure, should be 
recorded beginning fro m the time the subject signs the roll-over study  ICF for up to 28days 
after the l ast dose of study drug(s) (or 5half-lifeof study  drug [ s], whichever is lo nger).   
Abnorm al laboratory  values shoul d not be listed as separate AEs if they are considered to be 
part of the clinical syndro me that is being reporte d as a TEAE.  It is the responsibilit y of the 
investigator to review all laboratory  findings in all subjects and determine if they  consti tute a 
TEAE.  Medical and scient ific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an iso lated 
laboratory  abnorm ality shoul d be classified as a TEAE.  Any laboratory  abnorm ality 
considered to constitute a TEAE should be reported on the Adverse Event CRF. 
Abnorm al ECG (QTcF) resul ts, if not otherwi se considered part of a clinical symptom that is 
being reported as a TEAE , should be considered a TEAE if the QTc Finterval  is more than 
450ms and there is an increase of more than 60ms from baseline.  Any ECG abnormalit y 
that the investigator considers as a TEAE should be reported as such.
9.5.7.2 Assessing Severity of Adverse Events
Adverse events will be graded on a 5- point scale according to CTCAE v4.03 Table 1. 
Invest igators will report CTCAE grades for all AEs (for both increasing and decreasing
severit y).

9.5.7.3 Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment (s)
Items to be considered when asses sing the relationship of a TEAE to the study  treatment (s)
are:
Temporal  relati onship of the onset of the event to the init iation of the study  treatm ent(s)
The course of the event, especially the effect of discontinuat ion of study  treatm ent(s)or 
reintroduc tion of  study  treatment (s), as applicable
Whether the event is known to be associated with the study  treatm ent(s)or wi th other 
similar treatments
The presence of risk factors in the study  subject known to increase the occurrence of the 
event
The presence of non-study , treatment (s)-related factors that are known to be associated 
with the occurrence of the event
Classification of Causality
The rel ationship of each TEAE to the study  drug (s)will be recorded on the CRF in response 
to the following quest ion:
Isthere a reasonable possibilit y that the study  drug (s)caused the AE?

9.5.7.4 Serious Adverse Events and Events Associated with Special Situations
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
Results in death
Is life -threatening (ie, the subject was at immediate risk of death from  the adverse event 
as it occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form 
or was allowed to continue, might have caused death)
Requi res inpat ient hospi talizat ion or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talizati on
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect (in the child of a subject who was exposed to the 
study  drug)
Other important medical events that may  not be immediately life- threatening or resul t in 
death or hospitalizat ion but, when based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject or may require intervent ion to prevent one of the outcomes in the definit ion of 
SAE listed above should also be considered SAEs.  Medical and scientific judgment sh ould 
be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situat ions. 
In addit ion to the above, events associated with special situat ions include pregnancy  or 
exposure to study  drug (s)through breastfeeding; TEAEs associated with st udy drug 
overdose, misuse, abuse, or medication error .  These events associ ated wi th special situat ions 
are to be captured using the SAE procedures but are to be considered as SAEs only if they  
meet one of the above criteria.  All TEAEs associ ated wi thspecial  situations are to be 
reported on the CRF whether or not they  meet the cri teria for SAEs.  
All SAEs must be fo llowed to resol ution or, if resolut ion is unlikely, to stabilizat ion.
The fo llowing hospi talizati ons are not consi dered to be SAEs because there is no “adverse 
event” (ie, there i s no untoward m edical occurrence) associated with the hospitalizat ion:
Hospitalizations for respite care 
Planned hospi talizat ions required by the protocol
Hospitalization planned before informed consent (where the condit ion requiring the 
hospi talizati on has not changed afterstudy  drug administrati on)
Hospitalization for administration of study  drug (s)or insertion of access for 
administration of st udy drug (s)
Hospitalization for routine maintenance o f a device (eg, battery  replacement) that was in 
place before study  entry .

reported. Regardless o f the treatment arm, i f an adverse outcome of a pregnancy  is suspected 
to be rel ated to study  drug exposure, this should be reported regardless of the length of time 
that has passed since the exposure to study  treatm ent.
A congenital anomaly, death during perinatal period, an induced abortion, or a spontaneous 
aborti on are consi dered to be an SAE and should be reported in the same t ime frame and in 
the sam e format as all  other SAEs (see Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
[Secti on9.5.9.1 ]).
Pregnancies or exposure to study  drug through breastfeeding must b e reported by  fax or 
email as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours from the date the invest igator becomes 
aware of the pregnancy .  The contact information for the reporting of pregnancies and 
exposure to study  drug through breastfeeding is provided in the Invest igator Study File.  The 
Pregnancy Report Form must be used for reporting.  All pregnancies must be fo llowed to 
outcom e.  The outcom e of the pregnancy must be reported as soon as possible but no later 
than 24 hours from the date the invest igato r becomes aware of the outcome.
A subject who beco mes pregnant must be withdrawn fro m the study . 
9.5.9.3 Reporting of Adverse Events Associated With Study Drug Overdose, Misuse, 
Abuse, or Medication Error
Adverse e vents associated with study drug overdose, misus e, abuse, and medicat ion error 
refer to TEAEs associated with uses of the study  drug outside of that specified by  the 
protocol .  Overdose, misuse, abuse, and medicat ion error are defined as fo llows:
Overdose Accidental  or intent ional use of the study  drug in an amount higher 
than the protocol -defined dose
Misuse Intentional and inappropriate use of study  drug not in accordance with 
theprotocol
Abuse Sporadi c or persi stent intent ional excessive use o f study  drug 
accompanied by harmful physical or psycho logical effects
Medicat ion error Any unintentional event that causes or leads to inappropriate study  
drug use or subject harm while the study  drug i s in the control  of site
personnel or the subject.  
All TEAEs associated with overdose , misuse, abuse , or m edicati on error should be captured
on the Adverse Event CRF and also reported using the procedures detailed in Reporting of 
Serious Adverse Events (Secti on9.5.9.1 ) even if the TEAEs do not m eet seri ous cri teria.  
Abuse is always to be captured as a TEAE.  If the TEAE associated with an overdose, 
misuse, abuse, or medicat ion error does not meet serious criteria, it must still be reported 
using the SAE form  and in an expedited manner but should be noted as nonserious on the 
SAE form and the Adverse Event CRF.

PROCEDURES AND INSTR UCTIONS (ADMINISTRATIVE 
PROCEDURES)
11.1 Changes to the Protocol
Any change to the protocol requires a wri tten protocol  amendment or administrative change 
that must be approved by  the sponsor before implementation.  Amendments specifically  
affect ing the safet y of subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scient ific qualit y of the 
study  requi re sub missio n to health or regulatory  authori ties as well  as addi tional approval  by 
the applicable IRBs/IECs.  These requirements should in no way  prevent any  immediate 
action from being taken by  the invest igator, or by  the sponsor, in the interest of preserving
the safet y of all subjects included in the study .  If the invest igator determines that an 
immediate change to or deviat ion from the protocol is necessary  for saf ety reasons to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to the subjects, the sponsor’s medical mo nitor (or appropriate 
study  team  member )and the IRB/IEC for the site must be notified immediately.  The sponsor 
must notify the health or regulatory authority as required per local regulat ions.
Protocol  amendments that affect only  administrative aspects of the st udy may not require 
submissio n to health or regulatory  authori ty or the IRB/IEC, but the healt h or regulatory  
authori ty and IRB/IEC (or if regionally requi redthe head of the medical inst itution)shoul d 
be kept informed of such changes as required by lo calregulati ons.  In these cases, the 
sponsor may be required to send a letter to the IRB/IEC and the Competent Authorities (or, if 
regionally  required, the head of the medical inst itution) detailing such changes.
11.2 Adherence to the Protocol
The invest igator wi ll conduct the study  in strict accordance with the protocol (refer to 
ICH E6, Section 4.5).
11.3 Monitoring Procedures
The sponsor’s/CRO’s CRA will maintain contact with the invest igator and designated staff 
by telephone, letter, or email between study  visit s. Moni toring visits to each site will be 
conducted by  the assigned CRA as described in the monitoring plan.  The investigator (or if 
regionally  required, the head of the medical inst itution) will  allow the CRA to inspect the 
clinical, laboratory , and pharma cy facili ties to assure com pliance wi th GCP and l ocal 
regul atory  requi rements.  The CRFs and subject’s corresponding original medical records 
(source documents) are to be fully available for review by the sponsor’s representatives at 
regul ar intervals.  These reviews verify  adherence to study  protocol  and data accuracy  in 
accordance with local regulat ions.  All records at the site are subject to inspect ion by the 
local audi ting agency  and to IRB/IEC review.
In accordance with ICH E6, Section 1.52, source documents include, but are not limited to,
the following:
Clinic, office, or hospital charts

after producti on
Recorded data from automated instruments such as IxRS, x -rays, and other imaging 
reports (eg, sonograms, computed tom ography  scans, magnetic resonance images, 
radioactive images, ECGs, rhy thm stri ps, EEGs , polyso mnographs, pulmo nary funct ion 
tests) regardless of how these images are stored, including micro fiche and photographic 
negat ives
Pain, qualit y of life, or m edical history  quest ionnaires completed by  subjects
Records of telephone contacts
Diaries or evaluat ion checklists
Drug distribut ion and accountabilit y logs maintained in pharmacies or by  research 
personnel
Laboratory  resul ts and other laboratory  test outputs (eg, urine pregnancy test result 
docum entati on and urine dip- sticks)
Correspondence regar ding a study  subject’s treatment between physicians or memoranda 
sent to the IRBs/IECs
CRF co mponents (eg, questionnaires) that are completed directly by subjects and serve as 
their own source
11.4 Recording of Data
A CRF is required and must be co mpleted for each subject by  qualified and authori zed 
personnel.  All data on the CRF must reflect the corresponding source document, except 
when a sectionof the CRF i tself is used as the source document.  Any  correcti on to entries 
made on the CRF must be documented in a valid audit trail where the correction isdated, the 
individual making the correct ionis ident ified, the reason for the change is stated, and the 
original  data are not obscured.  Only  data requi red by  the pro tocol  for the purposes of the 
study  shoul d be collected.
The invest igator must sign each CRF.  The invest igator will report the CRFs to the sponsor 
and retain a copy  of the CRFs.
11.5 Identification of Source Data
All data to be recorded on the CRF must reflect the corresponding source documents.  For 
the following i tem(s), the data recorded directly on the CRF are to be considered source data:
Study  drug com pliance (eg, the reason for dose reduction).
Discontinuati on informat ion.
Comments and other informat ion on AEs (eg, severity , relationship to study  drug,

The ci rcumstances of com pletion or terminat ion of the study  notwithstanding, the 
investigator (or if regio nally required, the head of the medical inst itution or the desi gnate d 
representative) is responsible for retaining all study documents, including but not limited to 
the protocol, copies of CRFs, the Invest igator's Brochure, and regulatory  agency registration 
docum ents (eg, Form FDA 1572 ICFs, and IRB/IEC correspondence). The site should plan 
to retain study  docum ents, as di rected by  the sponsor, for at l east 2 y ears after the last 
approval  of a market ing applicat ion in an ICH region and unt il there are no pending or 
contem plated m arketing applicat ions in an ICH region or at least 3 years have elapsed since 
the form al discontinuat ion of clinical development of the invest igational product.
It is requested that at the completion of the required retention period, or should the 
investigator retire or relocate, the invest igator contact the sponsor, allowing the sponsor the 
option of  perm anent ly retaining the study  records.
11.7 Auditing Procedures and Inspection
In addit ion to routi ne monitoring procedures, the sponsor’s Clinical Qualit y Assurance 
departm ent conducts audi ts of clinica l research activi ties in accordance with the sponsor’s 
SOPs to evaluate compliance wit h the principles of ICH GCP and all applicable local 
regul ations.  If a government regulatory  authori ty requests an inspect ion during the study  or 
after its com pletion, the invest igator must inform the sponsor immediately.
11.8 Handling of Study Drug
All study  drug (s)will be supplied to the principal investigator (or a desi gnated pharm acist) 
by the sponsor, or when there is agreement between the PI and sponsor ,the site can so urce 
study  drug if i t is commercially  available in the country  and be reimbursed by  the sponsor .  
Drug supplies must be kept in an appropriate secure area (eg, locked cabinet) and stored 
according to the conditions specified on the drug labels.  The invest igator (or a designated 
pharmacist) must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of the study  
drug in a drug accountabilit y ledger, a copy  of which must be given to the sponsor at the end 
of the study .  An accurate record of the date and amount of study  drug dispensed to each 
subject must be available for inspect ion at any  time.  The CRA will visit the site and review 
these documents along wit h all other study  conduct documents at appropriate intervals once 
study  drug has been received by the site.
All drug supplies are to be used only for this study  and not for any  other purpose.  The 
investigator (or site personnel) must not destroy  any drug labels or any  partly used or unused 
drug supply before approval to do so by  the sponsor.  At the conclusio n of the study  and as 
appropriate during the study , the invest igator (or a designated pharmacist) will return all used 
and unused drug containers, drug labels, and a copy  of the com pleted drug di sposition form 
to the sponsor’s CRA or, when approva l is given by  the sponsor, will destroy  supplies and 
containers at the site.

Lenvatinib
Nonclinical studies ident ify CYP3A4 as a potentially important Cytochrome P450 isozyme
responsible for metabo lism of lenvat inib. Clinical studies were conducted to test these
findings.   Simultaneous CYP3A4/P -glycoprotein (P -gp) inhibit ion by ketoconazo le slight ly 
(15% to19%) increases systemic exposure to lenvatinib ( Shumaker, et al., 2015 ). Since no 
change was observed in half -life, t max, or lag time (t lag), the slight increase in systemic 
exposure is probably  related to a decrease in first pass metabolism. However, since the 
magnitude of change is small, co -administration of lenvat inib wit h CYP3A4/P -gp inhibitors 
is not of clinical concern.   The influence of P -gp inhibit ion on lenvat inib PK has been 
investigated. P -gp inhibit ion was accomplished by co -administering a single dose of rifampin 
with a single dose of lenvatinib.   Preliminary result s suggest P -gp inhibit ion increases 
systemic exposure to lenvatinib 26% to 32%. Thus, co- administration of lenvat inib wit h 
P-gp inhibitors only causes a small increase in lenvat inib exposure.   
The influence of simultaneous P -gp and CYP3A4 induct ion on l envat inib PK has been
investigated. Examinat ion of simulta neous P -gp and CYP3A4 induct ion on l envat inib PK
was acco mplished by  administering rifampin QD for 21 day s (Shumaker, et al., 2014 ). A
single dose of lenvat inib was co -administered with the 15th dose of rifampin. Based on
preliminary data, simultaneous P -gp and CYP3A4 induct ion minimally altered lenvat inib
exposure as mean C max increased about 8% while AUC decreased about 7%. 
Coadministration of lenvat inib wit h CYP3A4/P -gp inducers is not of clinical concern. The 
main metabolic pathways for lenvat inib in humans were ident ified as enzymat ic(CYP3A and 
aldehyde oxidase) and non -enzymat ic processes ( Lenvima® Package Insert ).

(CTCAE) Version 4.03
Commo n Termino logy Criteria f or Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.03, publi shed 14 Jun2010) 
provi des descript ive termino logy to be used for adverse event reporting in clinical studi es. A 
brief definit ion is provided to clarify the meaning of each AE term. To increase the accuracy  
of AE reporting, all adverse event terms in CTCAE v4.03 have been correlated with single -
concept Medical Dict ionary for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) terms.
Commo n Termino logy Criteria f or Adverse Events v4.03 grading refers to the severit yof the 
AE. The Common Termino logy Criteria for Adverse Ev ents grades 1 through 5, with unique 
clinical descript ions of severit y for each AE, are based on this general guideline:
ADL = activities of daily living, CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.
a:Instrumental ADL refers to preparing mea ls, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone,
managing money, etc.
b: Self-care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking
medications, and not bedridden.

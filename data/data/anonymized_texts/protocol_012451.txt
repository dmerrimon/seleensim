Confidential  4 2 SUMMARY OF PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS  
This trial was initiated according to the Final Protocol 1.0 dated 13 December  2016. There were 
4 amendments to the protocol, with subsequent updated protocol versions: 
Amendment No.  Issue Date  Key Changes  
Amendment 1  22 December  2016 . One CTCAE grade 3 event of 
conjunctivitis had already been reported in the GEN702 
trial. Following the cut -off date of 31  May 2016, 
3 additional CTCAE grade 3 events of conjunctivitis and 
1 CTCAE grade 4 event of keratitis were reported with 
tisotumab vedotin. The purpose of this protocol amendment was to modify the dose modification and the mitigation plan for ocular events accordingly, including mandatory preventive eye therapy.  
Amendment 2  27 July 2017 The protocol for one of the base trials, GEN702, had been modified to change the treatment schedule from the 3Q4W administration to that in the GEN701 trial, ie, 2.0  mg/kg 
dose 1Q3W. The change was due to ocular AEs observed with the 3Q4W schedule and, the refore, additional 
measurements were also implemented to the Mitigation 
Plan for Ocular Adverse Events, and a requirement of 
urgent reporting of non- serious grade 2 ocular events to 
the FDA was added. These additional measurements and 
the required reportin g for ocular events were also 
implemented in the GEN701 trial. In order to align with 
the base protocols GEN701 and GEN702, Protocol 
Amendment 2 was also prepared for the GCT1015- 03 
trial. 
Amendment 3  30 November  2017 The main purpose of this Protocol Amendment 3 was to 
align with a recent amendment in one of the base 
protocols: GEN701 Protocol Amendment 14.  
During the conduct of GEN701 no clinically relevant bleeding events had been observed in subjects treated with tisotumab vedotin. As a res ult, the protocol was amended 
in the areas of inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as prohibited medication sections to allow subjects on anticoagulation therapy to enter the trial if all other 
inclusion and exclusion criteria were met. To maintain 
alignment with GEN701, these changes were implemented 
in this amendment for GCT1015 -03.  
Based on the available safety profile for tisotumab vedotin at the time of the protocol amendment, a number of AESIs 
had been defined in the GEN701 Protocol Amendment 14.  
These AESIs were added accordingly in this GCT1015- 03 
Amendment 3.  
Additionally, the safety section was revised to include 
reporting requirements for non- serious grade ≥3 AEs and 
non-serious grade ≥2 ocular AEs, medication errors and/or 
overdose, and pre gnancies.

Confidential  5 Amendment No.  Issue Date  Key Changes  
Amendment 4  24 September  2018 The main purpose of this Protocol Amendment 4 was to 
include the option for an independent central radiology 
review as part of the efficacy assessments, in addition to 
the investigator assessments.  
This was conside red a non -substantial amendment as it did 
not have any impact on subject safety or the scientific value of the trial. In addition, there was no impact on the ICF and the subject’s rights in relation to personal data.  
The first subject was included in this trial when Final Protocol 3.0, incorporating Protocol 
Amendment 2, dated 27 July 2017, was in effect.

1. SYNOPSIS
NAME OF SPONSOR: Genmab A/S PROTOCOL  No.: GCT1015 -03 
NAME OF TRIAL  TREATMENT:  Tisotumab vedotin  
TITLE OF TRIAL : A multi -center, open -label trial investigating the efficacy and safety of continued 
treatment with tisotumab vedotin in patients with solid tumors known to express tissue factor  
TRIAL  CENTERS : The trial will be performed  in Europe and the United States of America, at the sites 
participating in the  base trial s. 
TRIAL  PERIOD : The trial will continue until Market ing Authorization in the 
country of an individual is granted or the sponsor stops the development of 
tisotumab vedotin.  PHASE OF 
DEVELOPMENT : 
Phase  II 
PLANNED TRIAL  DATES:  Until Market ing Authorization or end of clinical development program.  
OBJECTIVES:  
Primary Objective:  
To collect long -term safety data from patients with solid tumors who have been treated with tisotumab vedotin 
and completed any base trial ( i.e., GEN701 or GEN702)  
Secondary Objective :  
To further evaluate the anti -tumor activity of tisotumab vedotin  
TRIAL  DESIG N AND METHODOLOGY: 
This is an open -label, multicenter  trial to collect long -term safety and efficacy data and to provide ongoing 
access to tisotumab vedotin for patients with solid tumors who have completed a tisotumab vedoti n base trial. 
Patients demonstrating clinical benefit but who have been withdrawn from the base tisotumab vedotin  for 
reasons that are not considered critical and unmanageable for the safety of the patients (as evaluated by the 
investigator and/or the sponsor)  can also enter this protocol. For patients who received tisotumab vedotin as a 
single -agent in the base trial, tisotumab vedotin will be given according to the dosing level and schedule 
administered in the base trial at the time of exiting. In the Treatment Phase, investigators will monitor and 
assess the patients for response to treatment and for disease progre ssion. Any serious adverse events ( SAEs ) 
non-serious grade ≥ 2 ocular adverse events ( AEs), non -serious grade ≥ 3 AEs, overdose and/or medication 
errors, and pregnancies  should be r eported to the Safety Clinical Research Organization  by trial site personne l 
within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event. All ( S)AEs should be reported from the time the patient has 
signed the informed consent form  until the End-of-Trial (EOT) Visit, or until the patient withdraws consent or 
starts subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first. 
An EOT  Visit will occur 30 days after the last administration of trial drug. However, if a patient is unable to 
return to the site at that time or if the patient is scheduled to start subsequent treatment, this visit should b e 
performed as soon as possible after the last administration of trial drug.  
TRIAL  POPULATION AND MAIN CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION/EXCLUSION:  
Patients must have completed the base trial and have not received any other anti -cancer treatment prior to 
inclusion in GCT1015 -03, and they must not have experienced radiographic disease progression or clinical 
signs of symptoms of instability requiring u rgent intervention . Screening laboratory samples and computerized 
tomography (CT) -scan do not need to be repeated if these were performed as part of the base trial within the 
required timeframes (21 days and four weeks, respectively , before Cycle 1 Day 1  of the current trial ). 
Inclusion Criteria:  
•Patients must have either:
a)completed the ba se trial and have shown a clinical benefit of stable disease (SD) or better  and have
never met any withdrawal criteria as defined in the tisotumab vedotin base protocol, or

platelet count  ≥ 75 109/L. 
• Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.  
• A negative serum pregnancy test (if female and aged between 18 -55 years old).  
• Patients, both females and males, of reproductive potential must agree to use adequate contraception 
during and for six months after the last infusion of tisotumab vedotin. Adeq uate contraception for women 
is defined as hormonal birth control or an intrauterine device  (safe hormonal contraceptives include 
contraceptive pills, implants, transdermal patches, hormonal vaginal devices or injections with prolonged 
release) . In countri es where two highly effective methods of contraception are required this will be an 
inclusion criterion. Male patients must be willing to use a latex condom during any sexual contact with 
females of childbearing potential during and for six months after th e last infusion of tisotumab vedotin, 
even after having undergone a successful vasectomy. In order to be considered as sterilized or infertile, a

vedotin trials (e.g., GEN70 1, GEN702 ) and has  shown a clinical benefit of SD or better , or not completed 
treatment as defined in the base protocol for reasons that are not considered critical and unmanageable for the 
safety of the patient and the patient clearly showed response of PR or better , and w ho wish es to continue 
treatment with tisotumab vedotin may  participate in GCT1015 -03. It is e stimated that a pproximately 25 patients

will enter the trial.  
TRIAL  TREATMENT(S):  Patients will be treated with the tisotumab vedotin dosing regimen followed by the 
patient in the base trial . Preventive eye therapy should be administered in relation to infusions . Reduced dose 
can be administered in accordance with the mitigation strategies or  at the discretion of the treating physician 
based on individual patient observed toxicity profile and quality of life evaluation , and after consultation and 
agreement by the Genmab Medical Officer.  
Tisotumab vedotin will be administered as an intravenous infusion on Day 1  of each 21 -day cycle ( once every 
three weeks [ 1Q3W ]).  
Each patient’s dose will be calculated based on the patient’s weight (measured at first dosing visit within a 
cycle) rounded to the nearest kilogram, i.e., assigned dose in mg/kg × body weight in kg. For patients whose 
body mass index (BMI) is greater than  30 kg/m2, the investigator should use a weight that, based on the 
patient’s height, corresponds to a maximum BMI of 30.  
DURATION OF TREATMENT: Tisotu mab vedotin will be administered over a minimum of 30 minutes.  
Patients will be treated with tisotumab ve dotin until the investigator determines that the patient is no longer 
benefitting from treatment (i.e., disease progression or unacceptable toxicity has occurred), the trial is 
terminated by the sponsor, the patient withdraws consent, or for other reasons as defined in this protocol.  
TRIAL  EVALUATIONS:   
Primary Variable :  
• Adverse events.  
Secondary Variable : 
• Objective response rate assessed by tumor shrinkage  (according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid 
Tumors version 1.1 [ RECIST 1.1 ]) including change in PSA for patients with prostate cancer or  CA 125 for 
patients with ovarian cancer.  
STATISTICAL METHODS:  Given the low expected number of patients and the heterogeneity between 
patients entering this trial with regards to dosing regimen, indicatio n and response to treatment in the base trial, 
no formal statistical analyses are planned. Instead, all endpoints will only be listed.  All enrolled patients will be 
included in the listings.

6. INTRODUCTION  
Tisotumab vedotin  (HuMax®-TF-ADC ) is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a 
human monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 (subtype κ) targeting tissue factor (TF) 
conjugated via a pr otease cleavable valine citrulline linker to the drug monomethyl auristatin 
E (MMAE), a dolastatin 10 analog (Doronina et al., 2003 ; Hamblett et al., 2004 ; Sun et al., 
2005 ). Dolastatins and auristatins belo ng to a class of chemotherapies that act as microtubule 
disrupting agents.  
6.1 Background  
Human TF (thromboplastin, CD142 or coagulation factor III) is a 43 -47 kDa, single chain, 
transmembrane glycoprotein. Tissue f actor is the main initiator of the extrinsic pathway of 
blood coagulation, which starts when TF binds to serine protease factor VII (FVII) or 
activated factor VII ( FVIIa ). The TF:FVIIa complex initiates blood coagulation by 
proteolytic cleavage of factor X  (FX) to activated factor X ( FXa), and factor IX (FIX) to 
activated factor IX ( FIXa ), eventually leading to thrombin generation and the formation of a 
clot. In addition, the TF:FVIIa complex can initiate an intracellular signaling cascade by 
proteolytic ac tivation of protease activated receptor 2 (PAR -2), resulting in release of pro -
angiogenic factors and pro -inflammatory mediators such as vascular endothelial growth 
factor and interleukin -8. 
Under pathological conditions, membranous TF can be aberrantly ex pressed. TF is present on 
neoplastic cells as well as tumor associated endothelial cells in a variety of solid cancers. 
Indications where tumor cells are known to express TF include gynecological and 
genito -urethral tumors, squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN), lung cancers, 
tumors in the gastrointestinal tract, breast cancer, malignant melanoma and pancreatic cancer 
(Ohta et al., 2002 ; Akashi et al., 2003 ; Khorana et al., 2007 ; Uno et al., 2007 ; Patry et al., 
2008 ; Yokota et al., 2009 ; Cocco et al., 2011 ). 
Expression of TF on tumor cells has bee n associated with negative overall survival or disease 
free survival as described in several indications, including ovarian, bladder and pancreatic 
cancer ( Nitori et al., 2005 ; Han et al., 2006 ; Patry et al., 2008 ). Experimental studies suggest 
that tumor cells may benefit from both TF procoagulant activity and TF -induced PAR -2 
signaling, for example through enhanced metastatic potential, angiogenesis and cell survival 
(Ruf and Mueller,  1996 ; Kasthuri et al., 2009 ). Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies that 
inhibited either TF:FVIIa intracellular signaling or TF procoagulant capacity could reduce 
tumor gro wth in vivo ( Versteeg et al., 2008 ). 
Constitutive TF expression is mostly restricted to sub -endothelial cells (such as pericytes, 
smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts) that only interact with blood borne FVIIa when vascular 
integrity is compromised ( Drake et al., 1989 ). Tissue factor  is expressed in the vessel walls of 
a wide range of organs, with moderate to high levels observed in the brain, heart, intestine, 
kidney, lung, placenta, uterus, and t estes. The expression pattern suggests that TF provides 
additional hemostatic protection to these organs. In addition, TF expression has been 
described in epithelial cells in a number of organs including the skin, kidney and lung 
(Flössel et al., 1994 ; Drake et al., 1989 ; Imokawa et al., 1997 ). Under pathological, 
inflammatory conditions TF is aberrantly expressed, including but not limited to bullous

pemphigoid, urti caria (primarily on eosinophils, Marzano et al., 2009 ; Marzano et al., 2011 ; 
Cugno et al., 2009 ), inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases including Crohn’s disease an d 
ulcerative colitis ( More et al., 1993 ) and lung diseases including acute respiratory distress 
syndrome ( Bastarache et al., 2007 ). 
Broad expression of TF was confirmed in a tissue cross rea ctivity trial. Binding of 
HuMax -TF-ADC was observed on e.g. epithelial cells in organs, including but not limited to 
skin, breast, lungs, gastrointestinal  tract, kidney, liver and eye. Staining in glomeruli, islet 
cells in pancreas, peripheral nerves, card iomyocytes, smooth myocytes (esophagus, stomach 
and prostate) and processes of glial cells in grey matter was also observed . 
Tisotumab vedotin shows excellent anti -tumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Efficient tumor 
cell killing is thought  to rely on tisotumab vedotin binding to TF on the cell surface of tumor 
cells followed by rapid internalization and lysosomal processing of MMAE (GMB1015 -087 
available upon request). Subsequent intracellular release of MMAE results in tumor cell 
killing b y disruption of the microtubule network. In addition, MMAE can exert so called 
bystander toxicity by diffusion to neighboring tumor cells or tumor stromal cells. The 
cytotoxic effect mediated via MMAE release in target cells is believed to be the main 
mech anism of action of HuMax -TF-ADC. In vitro studies demonstrated that tisotumab 
vedotin and unconjugated HuMax -TF also induce antibody -dependent, cell -mediated 
cytotoxicity and inhibition of TF:FVIIa signaling. The contribution of these mechanisms to 
tumor c ell killing remains unknown.

vedotin, refer to the lat est version of the Investigator’ s Brochure for tisotumab vedotin.  
6.2 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
More detailed information ab out the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
expec ted adverse events (AEs) of tisotumab vedotin can be found in the Investigator ’s 
Brochure.  
6.3 Trial Rationale  
Tisotumab vedotin is currently  being developed as a treatment agent for solid tumors know n 
to express TF in the GEN701 and GEN702 trials. The present  trial is designed to collect 
long-term safety and certain efficacy data from patients treated with tisotumab vedotin who 
have completed one of the base trials  and want  to continue treatment with tisotumab vedotin . 
Patients demonstrating clinical benefit but who have been withdrawn from the base 
tisotumab vedotin trials  for reasons that are not considered critical and unmanageable for the 
safety of the patient (as evaluated by the investigator and/or the sponsor)  can also enter this 
protocol . The patient s should have shown continued benefit from tisotumab vedotin 
treatment in the base trial. The present  trial will continue until Market ing Authorization in 
the country of an individual patient is granted or the sponsor stops the development of 
tisotumab vedotin.

8. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
8.1 Overall Trial Design and Plan  
This is an open -label, multicenter  trial to collect long -term safety and efficacy data and to 
provide ongoing access to tisotumab vedotin for patients with solid tumors who have 
completed a tisotumab vedotin base trial . Patients demonstrating clinical bene fit but who 
have been withdrawn from the base tisotumab vedotin trials  for reasons that are not 
considered critical and unmanageable for the safety of the patient (as evaluated by the 
investigator and the sponsor)  can also enter this protocol.  For patients who received 
tisotumab vedotin as a single -agent in the base trial, tisotumab vedotin will be given 
according to the dosing level and schedule administered in the base trial  at the time of 
exiting.  Reduced dose can be administered in accordan ce with  the mitigation strategies 
(Section 9.4 to 9.5.6 ) or at the disc retion of the treating physician based on individual patient 
observed toxicity profile and after consultation and agreement by the Genmab Medical 
Officer.  Patients will be treated with the tisotumab vedotin dosing regimen followed by the 
patient in the bas e trial, until the investigator determines that the patient is no longer 
benefitting from treatment (i.e., disease progression or unacceptable toxicity has occurred), 
the trial is terminated by the sponsor, the patient withdraws consent, or for other reaso ns as 
defined in this protocol.  
In the Treatment Phase, investigators will monitor and assess the patients for response to 
treatment and for disease progression. Timing and assessments are outlined in the Schedule  
of Activities  (Table 1). Any SAEs , non-serious grade ≥ 2 ocular AEs , non -serious grade ≥ 3 
AEs, overdose and/or medication errors , and pregnancies  should be r eported to the Safety 
CRO by trial site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event. All ( S)AEs 
should be reported from  the time the patient has signed the ICF  until the End -of-Trial (EOT) 
Visit , or until the  patient withdraws consent or starts subsequent anti-cancer therapy, 
whichever occurs first. 
An EOT Visit will occur 30 days after the last administration of trial drug. However, if a 
patient is unable to return to the site at that time or if the patient is scheduled to start 
subsequent treatment, this visit should be perfo rmed as soon as possible after the last 
administration of  trial drug.

9. TREATMENT  
9.1 Identity of Investigational Medicinal Product  
Tisotumab vedotin is presented as a lyophilized powder  for reconstitution in water for 
injection and is intended for dosing by the intrave nous route by infusion after dilution in 
physiological saline solution.  
The final composition of the drug product after reconstitution is 10 mg/mL tisotumab vedotin 
formulated in a mixture of histidine, sucrose and mannitol at pH 6.0.  
9.2 Treatment  Administer ed 
The investigator  must ensure that the trial drug  will be used only in accordance with the 
protocol.  
Tisotumab vedotin will be administered as an intravenous infusion on Day 1  of each 21 -day 
cycle (once every three weeks [1Q3W]) .  
Each patient’s dose wil l be calculated based on the patient’s weight (measured at first dosing 
visit within a cycle) rounded to the nearest kilogram, i.e., assigned dose in mg/kg × body 
weight in kg. For patients whose body mass index (BMI) is greater than 30 kg/m2, the 
investigator should use a weight that, based on the patient’s height, corresponds to a 
maximum BMI of 30.  
The dose is calculated according to the following formula if BMI is greater than 30  kg/m2: 
Dose (mg) = x (mg/kg) * 30 (kg/m2) * height (m)  * height (m ) 
Tisotumab vedotin  will be administered over a minimum of 30  minutes. If infusion -related 
events emerge, refer to Section  9.4. The infusion is complete when the in fusion line has been 
flushed with a minimum 15 mL saline. Preventive eye therapy should  be administered in 
relation to i nfusions as detailed in Section  9.5.4 .

9.5.5 Dose Modification for QTcF Changes in the Electrocardiogram  
Prolongation of QTcF interval during the trial should be ma naged as follows:  
 For CTCAE grade  1 QTcF interval prolongation (450 to 480  msec): check electrolytes 
(calcium, magnesium and potassium) prior to next dosing, but no dose adjustment or 
dosing hold is required.  
 For CTCAE grade  2 QTcF interval prolongation (4 81 to 500  msec): hold dosing until 
improvement to grade 1 or lower and check electrolytes (calcium, magnesium and 
potassium) and substitute until normal levels; then dose can be restarted and 
electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) should be performed at least every oth er day.  
If the QTcF interval prolongation is not related to electrolyte abnormality, hold dosing until 
improvement to grade 1 or lower; then next infusions may be restarted at half of the initial 
infusion rate; ECGs should be performed at least every other day.  
 For CTCAE grade  3 QTcF interval prolongation (≥ 501 msec on at least two separate 
ECGs): stop dosing. Then, check electrolytes (calcium, magnesium and potassium) and 
substitute until normal levels; ECGs should be performed at least daily; consid er 
obtaining cardiology consult.  
9.5.6 Dose Modification for Increased Liver Enzymes  
In case of CTCAE grade ≥  3 liver enzymes increase is not resolved (decreased to grade 2 or 
lower) at time of dosing, the site mu st contact Genmab Medical Officer before the next  
dosing of the patient, in order to decide whether there should be any dose adjustment, delay 
or withdrawal of the patient .

10.1.7  Ophthalmological Evaluation   
Ophthalmological evaluations should be performed at screening  and during the trial as 
indicated in the trial flow chart.  
The ophthalmological evaluation should include collection of medical ophthalmological 
history (at screening  only), visual acuity assessment, Shirmer’s test, slit -lamp examination, 
measurement of ocular pressure and funduscopic.  
Patients experiencing ocular symptoms during the trial must be referred to an 
ophthalmologist for prompt review (preferably within 72 hours and no later than within 
one week).  
10.2 Efficacy Asse ssment s 
Investigator assessment of disease control, by CT -scan, will be collected during screening, 
and during the Treatment Period  until disease progression or the EOT Visit, whichever 
occurs first. At screening, t he last CT -scan of the base protocol may be used if it is  performed  
less than four weeks before Cycle 1 Day 1 of the current trial.  Assessments every six weeks  
(at the end of every second cycle) , which are consistent with the schedule for standard of 
care, are recommended (however , based on local standards, disease monitoring can also be as 
frequent as every four weeks or as infrequent as every 12 weeks). Disease response or 
progression should be evaluated by the investigator according to the current published 
RECIST 1.1 ( Eisenhauer et al., 2009 ) and recorded in the eCRF . Scans  may also be sent for 
an independent, central imaging review.  If reduction of target lesions ≥ 30% in size is 
observed, a repeat CT -scan will be performed after four weeks to con firm the response. In 
the case of SD, me asurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at 
a minimum interval (in general not less than six weeks) that is defined in the study protocol . 
Patients with prostate cancer must be clinica lly refractory and resistant to hormone therapy  
(castration -resistant prostate cancer [ CRPC ]) as documented b y progression , and can be 
evaluated based on PSA and/or bone metastases according to the Prostate Cancer Working 
Group Guideline ( Scher et al., 2008 ). Assessment of bone metastases by radionuclide bone 
scan every 12 weeks is recommended, but frequency should be based on local standards.  If 
there is suspicion of progression, another bone scan will be perform ed twelve weeks later.  
Patients with prostate cancer will be evaluated according to RECIST 1.1 in combination with 
PSA. 
For patients with ovarian cancer , blood samples for CA 125 assessment will be drawn for 
local analysis.  Patients with ovarian cancer wil l be evaluated according to RECIST 1.1 in 
combination with CA 125 . 
10.3 Safety Assessments  
10.3.1  Adverse Events  
Adverse event s will be assessed and reported at each visit. Adverse event s will be graded 
according to the NCI-CTCAE  version 4.03  (NCI-CTCAE v4.03, 2010 ). 
Details  on AEs monitoring and reporting are provided in Section 11.

10.3.2  Vital Signs  
Vital signs including temperature, blood pressure and heart  rate should be recorded at each 
visit. Within each visit, preferably the same equipment shall be used for vital signs 
measurements. Vital signs should be assessed just before and no longer than 30 minutes 
before infusion start, and within 30 minutes after the infusions .  
10.3.3  Electrocardiograms  
Single 12 -lead ECG will be obtained as outlined in the Schedule of Activities ( Table 1) using 
a local ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, 
and QTc intervals. ECG results will not be r ecorded in the eCRF  except for clinically 
significant result s that must be reported as an AE.  
10.3.4  Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments  
Laboratory tests should be collected as outlined in the Schedule of Activities ( Table 1) and 
assessed in accordance with local standards. Screening laboratory samples do not need to be 
repeated if these were performed as part of the base trial within 21 days before Cycle 1 Day 1  
of the current trial.  Laboratory  results will not be r ecorded in the eCRF except for clinically 
significant result s that must be reported as an AE . If a laboratory result  is deemed to be an 
AE, this should be reported in the eCRF including the laboratory value and the relevant 
reference range. Retesting is required only if clinical symptoms appear . 
A blood sample for pregnancy test will be drawn at the Screening Visit and at  the start of 
each treatment cycle  from all women of childbearing potential.  
The following safety laboratory tests should be collected:  
Hematology  
Erythrocytes , hemoglobin , hematocrit , leukocytes , neutrophils , lymphocytes , monocytes , 
eosinophils , basophils , neutrophils (abs olute ), lymphocytes (abs olute ), monocytes (abs olute ), 
eosinophi ls (abs olute ), basophils (abs olute ) and r eticulocytes .

11. ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
11.1 Definition s 
11.1.1  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial patient, temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.  
NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal product . 
11.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
An AE that meets one or more of the following criteria/outcomes is classif ied as serious  
(AEs not meeting the below mentioned criteria are classified as non -serious) : 
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
 Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ab ility to 
conduct normal life functions.  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 Medically important.  
 Results in death.  
 Is life -threatening.  
The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious ” refers to an event in which the 
patient was at risk of dea th at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
Elective surgery overnight for convenience or other scheduled hospitalization periods that 
were planned before the patient was i ncluded in this trial are not to be reported as AEs. 
Medical and scientific judgment must be exercised in deciding whether an AE is believed to 
be “medically important”. Medically important events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  
11.1.3  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Based on the currently available safety profile for tisotumab vedotin, the  below listed events 
are regarded as adverse events of special interest (AESIs):  
 Bleeding -related events  
 Neuropathy  
 Ocular events (conjunctivitis, ulceration, keratitis, symblepharon)  
  Protocol No. GCT1015 -03 
Continued treatment with tisotumab vedotin   Final  5.0 (incorporating Amendment 4 ), 24 Sep 2018  
 
 Page 40 of 65 
11.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
The investigator must report all directly observed AEs and all AEs reported by the patient. A 
general type of question should be used similar to “Do you have any health problems?" or 
“Have you had any health problems since your last visit?"  
All AEs must be reported from the time the patient signs the ICF until 30 days after the last 
dose of tisotumab vedotin, or until the patient withdraws consent or starts subsequent anti -
cancer therapy, whichever occurs first.  
Any AE (signs, symptoms and diagnosis) occurring prior to signing the ICF must be 
recor ded in the applicable base protocol eCRF . 
Registration of Adverse Events in the eCRF:  
 All AEs must be recorded  in the eCRF .  
 Grad e 3 and 4 abnormal laboratory test results must  be reported as AEs when these are 
assessed as clinically significant by the reporting investigator. 
Reporting of Adverse Events to the Safety CRO :  
 All SAEs 
 Ocular grade ≥ 2 AEs  
 All non -serious grade ≥ 3 AEs 
 All events of overdose and/or medication errors, independent of intensity, must be 
reported as AEs to the Safety CRO .  
 Any event of pregnancy must be reported as an AE to the Safety CRO.  
Please refer to Section 11.5 for an overview of AE reporting timelines.  
All deaths (including deaths due to disease progression) should be reported as an SAE.  
11.3 Events Requiring Immediate Reporting  
11.3.1  Serious Adverse Events , Non-serious Grade ≥ 3 Adverse Events, 
Non-serious Grade ≥ 2 Ocular Events, Overdose and/or Medication Errors, and 
Pregnancies   
Serious adverse events , non -serious grade ≥ 3 AEs, non-serious grade ≥ 2 ocular AEs , 
overdose and/or medication errors , and pregn ancies  must be reported from the investigational 
site to the Safety CRO  no later than 24 hours following (a) the patient visit at which such AE 
was reported, noted or recognized; or (b) the principal investigator’s or any investigator 
personnel’s receipt o f the test results or other information at, or from which, such 
development was reported, noted or recognized.  
Completed SAE Report Forms, Non-serious Grade 3 Adverse Event Report Forms , 
Non-serious Grade 2 Ocular Adverse Event Report Form s or Pregnancy Forms must 
immediately be forwarded to the Safety CRO .

11.3.2  Overdose and Medication Errors  
An overdose is defined as a patient receiving a dose of the IMP in excess of that specified in 
this protocol. All cases of overdose must be recorded  in the eCRF and reported to the Safety 
CRO  as an AE within 24  hours of  knowledge of the event . 
Medication errors and uses outside what is foreseen in the protocol, including misuse and 
abuse of the product, must be recorded in the eCRF and  reported to the Safety CRO  as an AE  
within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.  
Overdo se, medication errors, misuse and abuse do not automatically make an AE serious, but 
if the consequences are serious, for example death or hospitalizations, the event is serious 
and must be reported as an SAE  (see S ection  11.5). 
Rescue medication to reverse the action of tisotumab vedotin  is not available. In case of 
overdose, medication errors, misuse and/or abuse of the IMP, patients should receive 
supportive car e according to local guidelines, and potential side effects of tisotumab vedotin  
should be treated symptomatically.  
In the event of an overdose, the investigator should:  
i. Closely monitor the patient for any AE and laboratory abnormalities.  
ii. Contact th e Medical Monitor immediately.  
iii. Obtain a plasma sample for PK analysis if requested by the Medical Monitor 
(determined on a case -by-case basis).  
iv. Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose in the 
eCRF.  
11.3.3  Pregnancy  
Any pregnancy that occurs during trial participation must be reported. Pregnant trial patients 
must be withdrawn from treatment immediately, whereas male patients may continue in the 
trial should pregnancy of female partners occur. In this case, a separat e informed consent will 
be obtained from the female partner for collection of information regarding the pregnancy.   
If you have access to a secured email , you may forward completed SAEs, non -serious grade 3 
AEs, non -serious grade 2 ocular events forms or pregnancy f orms to:  
 
If you do not have access to a secured email, please forward completed SAEs, non -serious 
grade 3 AEs, non -serious grade 2 ocular events forms or pregnancy forms to:

Continued treatment with tisotumab vedotin   Final  5.0 (incorporating Amendment 4 ), 24 Sep 2018  
 
 Page 42 of 65 
Each pregnancy must be reported to the Safety CRO  within 24 hours of learning of its 
occurrence using the Pregnancy Form. The pregnancy must be followed up to determine 
outcome (including premature termination) and status of mother and child. The child must be 
followed at least to the age of one month.  
Pregnancy complications and elective terminations for medical reasons must be reported as 
an AE or SAE. Spontaneous abortions must be reported as an SAE. Any SAE occurring in 
association with a pregnancy brought to the investigator’s attention after the patient has 
completed the trial and considered by the investigator as possibly related to the I MP must be 
promptly reported to the Safety CRO . 
11.3.4  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify, as appropriate and according to local 
regulations, both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory ag encies about the safety 
of the product under clinical investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs by the investigator to 
the sponsor is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety 
of patients are met.  
The sponsor will  ensure that all relevant information about Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions (SUSAR s) is recorded and reported as soon as possible, but within a 
maximum of 15  days (fatal or life -threatening SUSARs within a maximum of seven  days) of 
first kno wledge by the sponsor or designee, to the competent regulatory authorities and/or to 
the Ethics Committee according to the applicable local regulatory requirements. Relevant 
follow -up information of fatal or life -threatening SUSARs will be communicated 
subsequently within an additional eight  days.  
The investigator should be aware of local reporting regulations to the IEC/IRB. The Safety 
CRO will either supply the investigator with the reports which should be passed on to the 
IEC/IRB or report directly to t he IEC/IRB depending on local regulations.  
11.4 Reporting of Adverse Events after Termination of Trial Participation  
Any suspected IMP -related SAE, non-serious grade ≥ 2 ocular AEs and non -serious 
grade  ≥ 3 AEs occurring at any time after the patient has terminated trial participation, should 
be emailed to the Safety CRO at  if there is access to a 
secured email , or if there is no acces s to a secured email, faxed to  
.  
11.5 Timelines for Reporting  
The required timeframes and reporting forms for reporting SAEs, non-serious grade ≥ 3 AEs, 
non-serious grade ≥ 2 ocular AEs , overdose and/or medication  errors  and pregnancies are 
presented in Table 3.  
All new information regarding SAEs , non-serious grade ≥ 3 AEs,  non-serious grade ≥ 2 
ocular AEs , overdose and/or me dication errors  and pregnancies  (initial and follow -up) must 
be reported from sites to the Safety CRO  within 24 hours. Sites must respond to follow -up 
queries from the Safety CRO within 3  days.

Time should be filled in if event starts on a dosing day or if the duration of the event is less 
than 24 hours.  
11.6.2  End Date and Time  
End date should be filled in if the outcome of an event is fatal, recovered/resolved, or 
recovered/resolved with sequelae.  
Time should be filled in if the duration of the event is less than 24 hours.  
11.6.3  Diagnosis  
The diagnosis of an AE should be recorded if available. If no diagnosis is available each sign 
and symptom should be recorded as individual AEs.  
Study Disease:  
Signs and symptoms, which according to the investigator are expected and well -known 
consequences of the indication, both in intensity and frequency , should not be reported as 
AEs or SAEs. Any unexpected change in the intensity or frequency should be reported as an 
AE (or SAE , if applicable).  
11.6.4  Information about Infusion -Related Reactions  
Information on whether AEs are infusion -related or not must be rep orted in the eCRF.  
11.6.5  Relationship to IMP  
The investigator must assess whether or not the event is related to the IMP . If the relationship 
changes over time, the last judgment by the investigator should be reported. Relatedness has 
to be assessed and reported  from the first time the AE is being reported.  
11.6.6  Serious Event  
The investigator must indicate whether or not the AE is determined to be “serious”  based on 
what is defined in S ection  11.1. 
11.6.7  Intensity  
The investigator should use the NCI -CTCAE version 4.03 to describe the severity of the AE  
(NCI-CTCAE v4.03, 2010 ). 
The grade assigned by the investigator should be the most severe that occurred d uring the AE 
period.  
11.6.8  Outcome  
The o utcome of the AE must be judged by the investigator by the following terms:  
 Fatal  
 Not recovered/not resolved  
 Recovered/resolved

 Recovering/resolving  
 Unknown  
11.6.9  Action Taken with IMP  
The action taken with the IMP should be recorded as:  
 Dose not changed  
 Dose reduced  
 Dose interrupted  
 Drug withdrawn  
 Not applicable  
 Unknown  
11.7 Follow -up on Adverse Events  
All AEs should be followed until they are resolved or until 30 days after the last dose of  
tisotumab vedotin, until the patient withdraws consent or starts subsequent anti -cancer  
therapy, whichever occurs first. Serious adverse events, related non -serious grade ≥ 2 ocular 
AEs and non -serious grade ≥  3 AEs that are  ongoing after trial participation should be 
followed on a regular basis, according to the investigator’s clinical judgment, until the event 
has been resolved or until the investigator assesses it as chronic and all queries have been 
resolved.  
11.8 Safety Surve illance  
Reported i ndividual SAEs , non -serious grade ≥ 3 AEs  and non -serious grade ≥ 2 ocular AEs  
will be evaluated by the sponsor upon receipt. Analysis of aggregated safety data across trials 
will be performed on an ongoing basis. If new safety issues are  identified, actions will be 
taken as appropriate , including update of the Investigator’s Brochure . Safety data obtained in 
this specific trial will be reported in the D evelopment Safety Update Report.

12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1 Sample Size Estimation  
Since the trial will include all patients willing  to continue on treatment after completing other 
tisotumab vedotin trials  (i.e., GEN701 and GEN702),  no sample size determination can be 
made. It is expected that approximately 25 patients will enter the GCT 1015 -03 trial.  
12.2 Statistical Analyses  
Given the low expected number of patients and the heterogeneity between patients at 
entering this trial with regards to dosing regimen, indication and response to treatment in the 
lead in trial , no formal statistical an alyses are planned. Instead , all endpoints will only be 
listed.  All enrolled patients will be included in the listings.  
12.2.1  Efficacy Analyses  
Anti-tumor activity  endpoints will be listed.   
12.2.2  Safety Analyses  
Safety end points will be listed.   
12.2.3  Other Analyses  
Not applicable.  
12.2.4  Interim Analyses  
As this trial may be ongoing for a very long time , potentially several interim analyses may 
become rel evant. Given that it is an open -label trial with no formal hypotheses , this will not 
require any formal methods such as con trol of the alpha level. It will simply consist of  lists of 
what has been observed so far with tisotumab vedotin during the trial conduct .

13. MONITORING PROCEDURE S/QUALITY ASSURANCE  
The sponsor has ethical, legal and scientific obligations to conduct this tri al in accordance 
with established research principles and ICH GCP guidelines  E6(R2) . As such, in order to 
fulfill these obligations and to monitor trial progress, the sponsor's monitors or 
representatives will visit the investigative sites during the trial  conduct, in addition to 
maintaining telephone and written communication. On -site visits, telephone calls and regular 
review of the eCRFs will be conducted in order to assess patient enro lment, compliance with 
protocol procedures, completeness and accuracy  of data entered on the eCRFs, verification of 
eCRF data against original source documents and occurrence of AEs. The investigator must 
provide the monitor, sponsor representative and auditors/inspectors with full access to all 
source and trial documents.   
13.1 Data Collection  
As part of the responsibilities assumed by participating in the trial, the investigator agrees to 
maintain adequate and accurate case histories for the patients treated under this protocol. 
Case histories include eCRFs and supporting data including, but not limited to, signed and 
dated ICFs, progress notes, hospital charts, nurse’s notes, diary cards or other worksheets 
provided to patients, laboratory reports, ECG readings, etc.  
Patient demographics and key/essential disease baseline chara cteristics thought to affect 
outcome, i.e., stratification variables and other prognostic factors, may be collected, as 
available, for all patients who provide written informed consent. For patients who provided 
informed consent and were not entered into t he trial, the reason the patient was not entered, 
i.e., did not meet one or more inclusion criteria, met one or more exclusion criteria, or other 
(e.g., lost to follow -up, consent withdrawn), may also be collected.  
13.2 Data Management  
Data management will be  performed by . Data collected during the trial will be recorded 
in the patient’s eCRF by the investigational site staff.  
13.3 Trial Monitoring  
Sponsor or sponsor assigned monitors will conduct regular site visits to the investigational 
facilities for the purpose of monitoring various aspects of the trial. The investigator must 
agree to sponsor -authorized personnel having direct access to the clinical (or associated) files 
and clinical trial supplies (dispensing and storage areas) for all trial patients con sidered for 
trial entry for the purpose of verifying entries made in the eCRF, and assist with their 
activities, if requested. Adequate time and space for monitoring visits should be made 
available by the investigator.  
The site must complete the electronic  eCRFs in a timely manner and on an ongoing basis to 
allow regular review by the trial monitor. Further instruction will be provided in the eCRF 
Completion Guidelines.  
The monitor will discuss the conduct and progress of the trial with the investigator and  other 
site staff. The investigator must cooperate with the monitor to ensure that corrective action is 

  Protocol No. GCT1015 -03 
Continued treatment with tisotumab vedotin   Final  5.0 (incorporating Amendment 4 ), 24 Sep 2018  
 
 Page 48 of 65 
taken to resolve any problems noted in the course of the monitoring, and that the preventive 
measures are put into place to prevent recurrence of issues . In cases where compliance is not 
achieved, shipment(s) of the trial drug to the investigator will be discontinued and trial 
participation by that investigator will be terminated.  
13.4 Inspections and Auditing Procedures  
Before, during and after the trial, the  sponsor or its representative may conduct audits at the 
investigative sites including, but not limited to, drug supply, presence of required documents, 
the informed consent process, and comparison of eCRFs with source documents. All medical 
records (progr ess notes) must be available for audit. The investigator agrees to participate in 
audits conducted at a convenient time in a reasonable manner.  
Government regulatory authorities may also inspect the investigator. The investigator or 
designee should contact  the sponsor/  immediately if this occurs. He/she must cooperate 
fully with regulatory authorities or other audits conducted at a convenient time in a 
reasonable manner. The investigator will forward to the sponsor a copy of any inspection 
records receiv ed.

14. TRIAL MANAGEMENT AND MATERIALS  
14.1 Data Collection  
All data entered in the eCRF should be documented at the site. During each trial visit, a 
physician participating in the trial will maintain progress notes in the patient’s medical 
records to document all  significant observations. At a minimum, these notes will contain:  
 That the patient has consented and is found eligible for the trial (as applicable).  
 The date of the visit and the corresponding day or visit in the trial schedule (e.g., 
screening, Day 1, D ay 15, etc.).  
 General condition and status remarks by the patient, including any significant medical 
findings. The severity, frequency, duration and resolution of any reported AE, and the 
investigator's assessment as to whether or not the reported AE is tr ial drug -related.  
 Changes in concomitant medications or dosages.  
 A general reference to the procedures completed.  
 The signature or initials of all physicians making an entry in the medical record (progress 
notes).  
In addition, any contact with the patient via telephone or other means that provides 
significant clinical information will also be documented in the medical record (progress 
notes), as described above.  
Information from the medical records (progress notes)  and other source documents will be 
promptly transcribed to the appropriate section of the eCRF.  
Changes to information in the medical record (progress notes), and other source documents 
will be initialed and dated on the day the change is made by the inve stigator or designee. If 
the reason for the change is not apparent, a brief explanation for the change will be written 
adjacent to the change.  
Details on data validation, data transfers, origin and destination on the data, access to the 
transferred data, t iming of the transfer and any actions that may be triggered by real -time 
review of those data will be documented in the data management plan . 
14.2 Source Documents Maintenance  
Source documents contain the results of original observations and activities of a cli nical 
investigation. Source documents include, but are not limited to, medical records (progress 
notes), clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded 
data from automated instruments, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, 
x-rays, computer printouts, patient files and records kept at the pharmacy, laboratories and 
medico -technical departments involved in the clinical trial. There should only be one source 
defined at any time for any data element.  
All sourc e documents from this trial will be maintained by the investigator and made 
available for inspection by authorized persons. The original signed informed consent for each

 Page 50 of 65 
patient shall be filed with records kept by the investigator and a copy shall be given  to the 
patient.  
14.3 Record Maintenance  
All data derived from the trial will remain the property of Genmab A/S.  
Records must be retained in accordance with the ICH Guidelines on GCP  (R2). All essential 
trial documents including records of patients, source docu ments, eCRFs and trial drug 
inventory must be kept on file.  
USA FDA regulations (21 CFR 312.62[c]) require that records and documents pertaining to 
the conduct of this trial and the distribution of investigational drug, including eCRFs, consent 
forms, labo ratory test results and medical inventory records, must be retained by the 
Principal Investigator for two years after marketing application approval. If no application is 
filed, these records must be kept two years after the investigation is discontinued and the 
USA FDA and the applicable national and local health authorities are notified. The sponsor 
or their representative will notify the Principal Investigator of these events.  
The investigator will not disp ose of any records relevant to this trial without written 
permission from the sponsor, and will provide the sponsor the opportunity to collect such 
records. The investigator shall take responsibility for maintaining adequate and accurate hard 
copy source d ocuments of all observations and data generated during this trial. Such 
documentation is subject to inspection by the sponsor, its representatives and regulatory 
authorities.  
If an investigator moves, withdraws from an investigation or retires , the respons ibility for 
maintaining the records may be transferred to another person who will accept responsibility. 
Notice of transfer must be made to and agreed by the sponsor.  
14.4 Confidentiality  
All information obtained during the conduct of the trial with respect to the patient’s state of 
health will be regarded as confidential. For disclosure of any such information, an agreement 
will be obtained in writing.  
The investigator must ensure that each patient’s anonymity is maintained. On eCRFs and 
other documents submit ted to the sponsor or the CRO, patients must not be identified. 
Instead, patients will only be known by the unique patient number allocated to them in order 
to ensure confidentiality on all trial documentation. Patients will retain this unique number 
throu ghout the trial. The investigator will keep a separate log of these codes.  
In order to comply with government regulatory guidelines and to ensure patient safety, it may 
be necessary for the sponsor and its representative,  personnel, the local research review 
board, or the US A FDA to review patients’ medical records as they relate to this trial. Only 
the patient’s unique number on the eCRFs will identify him/her, but their full names may be 
made known to a drug regulatory authority or other authorized go vernment or health care 
officials, if necessary, and to personnel designated by the sponsor.  
Documents that are not for submission to the sponsor (e.g., consent forms) will be 
maintained by the investigator in strict confidence, except to the extent necess ary to allow 

  Protocol No. GCT1015 -03

monitoring by the sponsor and designee, and auditing by regulatory authorities. No 
documents identifying patients will leave the investigative site and patient identity will 
remain confidential in all publications related to the trial.

15. ADMINIS TRATION PROCEDURES  
15.1 Regulatory Approval  
Genmab A/S or their appointed agents will be responsible for ensuring that appropriate 
regulatory authority approvals are obtained, according to local country requirements.  
No patient may enter the trial until this ap proval has been obtained. A copy of the approval 
(where one is provided, according to local country requirements) will be provided to the 
investigator and to the IEC(s)/IRB(s).  
15.2 Protocol Amendments  
In accordance with ICH Topic E 6(R2) Guideline for GCP, the investigator should not 
implement any deviation from, or changes of the protocol without agreement by the sponsor 
and documented approval from the IEC/IRB of a protocol amendment, except where 
necessary to eliminate an immediate haz ard(s) to trial patients, or when the change(s) 
involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial (e.g., change in monitor(s), 
change of telephone number(s)).  
Any change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. Any potential 
amendment must be approved by the sponsor. A written amendment must be submitted to the 
appropriate regulatory authorities and to the IEC/IRB assuming this responsibility. The 
investigator must await IEC/IRB approval of protocol amendments before implement ing the 
changes, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to patients. In these 
cases, the IEC/IRB must be notified within five days of the change.  
All amendments to the protocol must be approved in writing by both the appropriate 
regulatory authorities and the IEC/IRB, except for administrative amendments, which require 
notification but not written approval. Once approved, the protocol amendment will be 
distributed to all recipients of the original protocol, with instructions to append  the 
amendment to the protocol.  
If, in the judgment of the local IEC/IRB, the investigator and/or sponsor, the protocol 
amendment alters the trial design, procedures and/or increases the potential risk to the 
patient, the currently approved written ICF wil l require modification. The modified ICF must 
also be reviewed and approved by the sponsor, appropriate regulatory authorities, and the 
IEC/IRB. In such cases, repeat informed consent must be obtained from patients enrolled in 
the trial before participatio n continues.  
15.3 Protocol Adherence and Deviations  
The protocol must be read thoroughly and the instructions must be followed. However, 
exceptions will be made in emergency situations when the protection, safety and well -being 
of the patient requires immediate  intervention based on the judgment of the investigator or a 
responsible, appropriately trained and credentialed professional(s) designated by the 
investigator as a sub -investigator.  
In the event of a significant protocol deviation due to an emergency, ac cident or error, the 
investigator or designee must contact the Medical Monitor at the earliest possible time by 
  Protocol No. GCT1015 -03 
Continued treatment with tisotumab vedotin   Final  5.0 (incorporating Amendment 4 ), 24 Sep 2018  
 
 Page 53 of 65 
telephone. This allows for an early joint decision to be made as to whether or not the patient 
should continue in the trial. The investigator, t he sponsor and the Medical Monitor will 
document this decision.  
15.4 Publication Policy  
The sponsor acknowledges the investigator’s right to publish the entire results of the trial, 
regardless of the outcome, in accordance with the Uniform Requirements for Manu scripts 
Submitted to Biomedical Journals of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors 
(http://www.icmje.org/icmje -recommendations.pdf , updated December 2014).  
The international Coo rdinating Investigator will, together with the sponsor, decide on the 
publication strategy and has the right to publish and present the results and methods as first 
author of multicenter publications. Co -authorship will be decided by the sponsor and the 
international Coordinating Investigator and will be limited to a number of persons who have 
contributed substantially in the design, analysis and conduct of the trial or the writing and 
presentation of results. The sponsor will have representation in the lis t of authors.  
Publications are subject to the following conditions:  
 No publication before the completion of the trial at all participating sites without written 
agreement with the sponsor.  
 All proposed publications and presentations, including any modifica tions or amendments, 
shall be submitted to the sponsor for its review at least 30 days before such presentation or 
publication is submitted to any third party.  
 Publications shall not disclose any sponsor confidential information and property (not 
including  the trial results, which can be published as described elsewhere in this section).  
15.5 Contractual and Financial Details  
The investigator (and/or, as appropriate, the hospital administrative representative) and the 
sponsor will sign a clinical trial agreement  prior to the start of the trial, outlining overall 
sponsor and investigator responsibilities in relation to the trial. The contract should describe 
whether costs for pharmacy, laboratory and other protocol -required services are being paid 
directly or indi rectly. Financial Disclosure Statements will need to be completed, as 
requested by FDA CFR 21 part 54.  
15.6 Insurance, Indemnity and Compensation  
Genmab A/S undertakes to maintain an appropriate clinical trial insurance policy.  
Deviations from the trial protoco l - especially the prescription of a dose other than that 
scheduled in the trial protocol, other modes of administration, other indications and longer 
treatment periods - are not permitted and shall not be covered by the statutory patient 
insurance scheme.

 Page 54 of 65 
15.7 Termination of the Trial  
This trial may be terminated by the sponsor. The trial may also be terminated prematurely at 
any time when agreed to by both the investigators and the sponsor as being in the best 
interests of patients, and justified on either med ical or ethical grounds. In terminating the 
trial, Genmab A/S,   and the investigator will ensure that adequate consideration is given 
to the protection of the patients’ interests.  
15.8 Investigator Trial File Management  
The investigator is responsible for assuring that the Investigator Trial File is maintained. The 
Investigator Trial File will contain, but will not be limited to, the information listed below:

17.2 Appendix 2: Highly Effective Methods of Contraception  
For countries where 2 highly effective methods of c ontraception are required, the following 
definitions are provided (ICH M3).  
Highly effective method of contraception / birth control as defined in ICH (M3)  
Methods of birth control which result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when 
used consistently and correctly such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, 
some intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence or vasectomized partner.  
Barrier Contraceptive  
A contraceptive device that physically prevents sperm from entering the endometrial cavity 
and fallopian tubes (e.g., male condom, female condom or diaphragm).  
Acceptable forms of effective contraception include:  
(1) Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception.  (Safe 
hormonal contraceptives  include contraceptive pills, implants, transdermal patches, 
hormonal vaginal devices or injections with prolonged release.) [The decision to allow 
use of hormonal contraceptives should be based on the Investigational Medicinal 
Product’s metabolism and pot ential for interactions, pharmacology and the adverse 
event profile (e.g. vomiting)].  
(2) Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system. [Consideration should be 
given to the type of device or system being used, as there are higher failure rates 
quoted for certain types, e.g. steel or copper wire]  
(3) Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or 
cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository. [The use of 
barrier contraceptives should always be supplemen ted with the use of a spermicide. 
The following should be noted:  
 Failure rates indicate that, when used alone, the diaphragm and condom are not 
highly effective forms of contraception. Therefore the use of additional spermicides 
does confer additional theo retical contraceptive protection.  
 However, spermicides alone are inefficient at preventing pregnancy when the whole 
ejaculate is spilled. Therefore, spermicides are not a barrier method of 
contraception and should not be used alone .] 
(4) Male sterilization (wi th the appropriate post -vasectomy documentation of the absence 
of sperm in the ejaculate). [For female subjects on the study, the vasectomized male 
partner should be the sole partner for that subject].  
(5) True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferr ed and usual lifestyle of the 
subject. [Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception].

 Page 59 of 65 
Two forms of highly effective contraception  
For certain studies, e.g . in the event of teratogenicity or lack of adequate reproductive 
toxicity data, there is a requirement for 2 forms of highly effective contraception. In this 
situation, subjects should be instructed to use 2 different forms of effective contraception 
(e.g. from the list above).

WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI  
Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects  
Adopted by the 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and ame nded by the:  
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 1975  
35th WMA General Assembly, Venice, Italy, October 1983  
41st WMA General Assembly, Hong Kong, September 1989  
48th WMA General Assembly, Somerset West, Republic of South Africa, October 1996  
52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000  
53th WMA General Assembly, Washington DC, USA, October 2002 (Note of Clarification added)  
55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 2004 (Note of Clarification added)  
59th WMA General Asse mbly, Seoul, Republic of Korea, October 2008  
64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013  
 
Preamble  
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research inv olving human subjects, including 
research on identifiable human material and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs 
should be applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  
2. Consistent  with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to 
physicians. The WMA encourages others who are involved in medical research involving 
human subjects to adopt these principles.  
General Principles  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the W MA binds the physician with the words, “The health 
of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics 
declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when providing medical 
care.”  
4. It is the d uty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well -being and rights of 
patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge 
and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty.  
5. Medical progress is  based on research that ultimately must include studies involving 
human subjects.  
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the 
causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and 
therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best proven 
interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, 
efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
  Protocol No. GCT1015 -03 
Continued treatment with tisotumab vedotin   Final  5.0 (incorporating Amendment 4 ), 24 Sep 2018  
 
 Page 61 of 65 
7. Medical research is subject to ethica l standards that promote and ensure respect for all 
human subjects and protect their health and rights.  
8. While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal 
can never take precedence over the rights and interests of indi vidual research subjects.  
9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research to protect the life, health, 
dignity, integrity, right to self -determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal 
information of research subjects. The resp onsibility for the protection of research subjects 
must always rest with the physician or other health care professionals and never with the 
research subjects, even though they have given consent.  
10. Physicians must consider the ethical, legal and regulat ory norms and standards for 
research involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international 
norms and standards. No national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement 
should reduce or eliminate any of the protec tions for research subjects set forth in this 
Declaration.  
11. Medical research should be conducted in a manner that minimises possible harm to the 
environment.  
12. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by individuals with 
the ap propriate ethics and scientific education, training and qualifications. Research on 
patients or healthy volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately 
qualified physician or other health care professional.  
13. Groups that are underrep resented in medical research should be provided appropriate 
access to participation in research.  
14. Physicians who combine medical research with medical care should involve their patients 
in research only to the extent that this is justified by its potent ial preventive, diagnostic or 
therapeutic value and if the physician has good reason to believe that participation in the 
research study will not adversely affect the health of the patients who serve as research 
subjects.  
15. Appropriate compensation and t reatment for subjects who are harmed as a result of 
participating in research must be ensured.  
Risks, Burdens and Benefits  
16. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and 
burdens.  
Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance of the 
objective outweighs the risks and burdens to the research subjects.  
17. All medical research involving human subjects must be preceded by careful assessment 
of predictable risks and burdens to the ind ividuals and groups involved in the research in 
comparison with foreseeable benefits to them and to other individuals or groups affected by 
the condition under investigation.  
Measures to minimise the risks must be implemented. The risks must be continuousl y 
monitored, assessed and documented by the researcher.  
  Protocol No. GCT1015 -03 
Continued treatment with tisotumab vedotin   Final  5.0 (incorporating Amendment 4 ), 24 Sep 2018  
 
 Page 62 of 65 
18. Physicians may not be involved in a research study involving human subjects unless they 
are confident that the risks have been adequately assessed and can be satisfactorily managed.  
When the risk s are found to outweigh the potential benefits or when there is conclusive proof 
of definitive outcomes, physicians must assess whether to continue, modify or immediately 
stop the study.           
Vulnerable Groups and Individuals  
19. Some groups and indivi duals are particularly vulnerable and may have an increased 
likelihood of being wronged or of incurring additional harm.  
All vulnerable groups and individuals should receive specifically considered protection.  
20. Medical research with a vulnerable group i s only justified if the research is responsive to 
the health needs or priorities of this group and the research cannot be carried out in a 
non-vulnerable group. In addition, this group should stand to benefit from the knowledge, 
practices or interventions that result from the research.  
Scientific Requirements and Research Protocols  
21. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific 
principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other rele vant 
sources of information, and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, animal experimentation. 
The welfare of animals used for research must be respected.  
22. The design and performance of each research study involving human subjects must be 
clearly des cribed and justified in a research protocol.  
The protocol should contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and should 
indicate how the principles in this Declaration have been addressed. The protocol should 
include information regarding fu nding, sponsors, institutional affiliations, potential conflicts 
of interest, incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or 
compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the research 
study.  
In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post -trial 
provisions.  
Research Ethics Committees  
23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and 
approval to the concerned research ethics c ommittee before the study begins. This committee 
must be transparent in its functioning, must be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and 
any other undue influence and must be duly qualified. It must take into consideration the 
laws and regulations o f the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as 
well as applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allowed to reduce 
or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide 
monitoring information to the committee, especially information about any serious adverse 
events. No amendment to the protocol may be made without consideration and app roval by

the committee. After the end of the study, the researchers must submit a final report to the 
committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions.  
Privacy and Confidentiality  
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the pr ivacy of research subjects and the 
confidentiality of their personal information.  
Informed Consent  
25. Participation by individuals capable of giving informed consent as subjects in medical 
research must be voluntary. Although it may be appropriate to con sult family members or 
community leaders, no individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in a 
research study unless he or she freely agrees.  
26. In medical research involving human subjects capable of giving informed consent, each 
potenti al subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any 
possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated 
benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail, p ost-study 
provisions and any other relevant aspects of the study. The potential subject must be 
informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to withdraw consent to participate 
at any time without reprisal. Special attention should be give n to the specific information 
needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the 
information.  
After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician or 
another appropriately qualified indiv idual must then seek the potential subject’s freely -given 
informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the 
non-written consent must be formally documented and witnessed.     
All medical research subjects should be  given the option of being informed about the general 
outcome and results of the study.  
27. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician must 
be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the 
physician or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent must be 
sought by an appropriately qualified individual who is completely independent of this 
relationship.  
28. For a potential research subject who is inc apable of giving informed consent, the 
physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorised representative. These 
individuals must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them 
unless it is intended to promote t he health of the group represented by the potential subject, 
the research cannot instead be performed with persons capable of providing informed 
consent, and the research entails only minimal risk and minimal burden.  
29. When a potential research subject w ho is deemed incapable of giving informed consent is 
able to give assent to decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that 
assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorised representative. The potential 
subject’s dissent should be respected.

30. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, 
for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that 
prevents giving informed consent is a necessary ch aracteristic of the research group. In such 
circumstances the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorised 
representative. If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, 
the study may proceed without infor med consent provided that the specific reasons for 
involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent have 
been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethics 
committee. Consent to re main in the research must be obtained as soon as possible from the 
subject or a legally authorised representative.  
31. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to the 
research. The refusal of a patient to particip ate in a study or the patient’s decision to 
withdraw from the study must never adversely affect the patient -physician relationship.  
32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on 
material or data contained in bioban ks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed 
consent for its collection, storage and/or reuse. There may be exceptional situations where 
consent would be impossible or impracticable to obtain for such research. In such situations 
the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics 
committee.  
Use of Placebo  
33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested 
against those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the followi ng circumstances:  
        Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is 
acceptable; or  
        Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any 
intervention less effective than the best p roven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is 
necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive 
any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, or no intervention will not 
be subject to additional risks of serious or irreversible harm as a result of not receiving the 
best proven intervention.  
Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.  
Post-Trial Provisions  
34. In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should 
make provisions for post -trial access for all participants who still need an intervention 
identified as beneficial in the trial. This information must also be disclosed to participants 
during the informed consent process.  
Researc h Registration and Publication and Dissemination of Results  
35. Every research study involving human subjects must be registered in a publicly 
accessible database before recruitment of the first subject.

36. Researchers, authors, sponsors, editors and publ ishers all have ethical obligations with 
regard to the publication and dissemination of the results of research. Researchers have a 
duty to make publicly available the results of their research on human subjects and are 
accountable for the completeness and  accuracy of their reports. All parties should adhere to 
accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. Negative and inconclusive as well as positive 
results must be published or otherwise made publicly available. Sources of funding, 
institutional affiliations  and conflicts of interest must be declared in the publication. Reports 
of research not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration should not be accepted 
for publication.  
Unproven Interventions in Clinical Practice  
37. In the treatment of an ind ividual patient, where proven interventions do not exist or other 
known interventions have been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with 
informed consent from the patient or a legally authorised representative, may use an 
unproven inte rvention if in the physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, 
re-establishing health or alleviating suffering. This intervention should subsequently be made 
the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new 
information must be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available.

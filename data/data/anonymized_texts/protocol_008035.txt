Methodology:  This will be an open -label trial enrolling patients with CTCL (stage IA, IB, or IIA) 
randomized to receive topical HyBryte or topical Valchlor for 12 weeks.  
Patients randomized to HyBryte will apply the drug to all accessible lesions twice per week followed by visible light treatment 21 (±3) hours later starting at 6 J/cm
2 and titrated up at each visit until there is 
evidence of mild erythema of the treated lesions following the light session (Grade 1 erythema on the Erythema Score)  and dropping the light dose if there is Grade 2 erythema. Should the patient have 
Grade ≥3 , treatment will be suspended for 1 week and treatment may be restarted at a 1 J/cm
2 lower than 
the last well- tolerated light dose . 
Patients randomized to Valchlor will receive commercially available drug applied as per the package insert.  
Three to 5 prospectively identified index lesions will be evaluated for mCAILS assessment  and the 
lesions  chosen will be representative of the patient’s overall disease  and, if the patient has both patch 
and plaque lesions, the index lesions should include each type in the approximate same percentage as their total lesions .   
Patients will be treated for a total of 12 weeks, with follow -up visits at Week 13, Week 14, and Week 
16/End of Study. Every three weeks, patients will come to the clinic for an assessment visit (ie, at Week 
3, Week 6, Week 9, and Week 12 ). At these evaluation visits, a cumulative mCAILS, modified Severity -
Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT), Physician Global Assessment (PGA), Skin Adverse Event Questionnaire (SAEQ) will be completed, and Scoring Dermatitis (SCORD) collected. 
For HyBryte patients, these assessments will be done immediately prior to light treatment at the second 
light treatment visit of the evaluation week (ie, Week s 3, 6, 9, 12) .  
Follow -up assessments will be conducted at Week 13 ( 1-week post -treatment), Week 14 (2 weeks post -
treatment), and Week 16/End of Study (4 weeks post -treatment) and will also include mCAILS, 
mSWAT, PGA, SAEQ, and SCORD assessments.  
Physical examinations and safety labs (hematology and chemistry)  will be analyzed at B aseline , at the 
Week 12 assessment visit,  and 4 weeks after completion  of therapy (Week 16/End of Study). AE’s will 
be recorded throughout the study. Vital signs will be collected at Baseline and Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14 and 16.  
Number of patients (planned):  Approximately 10 subjects will be randomized 1:1 ( HyBryte: Valchlor )

1.1 Background  
HyBryte™ (0.25% hypericin) is a chemically synthesized hypericin formulated for 
topical use only for the treatment of early -stage Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL) 
and is intended to be administered only in conjunction with a schedule of controlled doses of visible light. Hypericin is a photodynamic radical generator that has been shown to have anti- cancer effects in the dark with substantial ly more effects after activation by 
light in the 500 to 650 nm wavelength range. More complete information on hypericin is available in the Investigator Brochure. 
1.2 Study Rationale  
The Phase 3 trial, HPN -CTCL -01, demonstrated that HyBryte in combination with 
visible light activation given 2× per week for 6 weeks statistically significantly increased 
the number of patients with a ≥50% improvement in their treated lesions when compared to a concurrent placebo group (Kim 2022). Among those that continued HyBryte treatment for an additional 6 or 12 weeks, a significant and substantial improvement in their response rates was seen. Similar safety and efficacy findings were seen in 9 patients enrolled in HPN- CTCL -02 that treated pa tients for 8 weeks  (NCT 05380635). 
This study is a pilot study to obtain preliminary comparative assessments of the efficacy and safety of Valchlor compared to HyBryte as well exp lore the practical issues involved 
with an open-label HyBryte/ active control group design in early- stage CTCL.  
1.2.1  Pharmacokinetics  
Hypericin was initially developed for the systemic treatment of enveloped viral infections including human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) (Gulick 1999), hepatitis C virus (HCV)  
(Jacobson 2001) and glioma (Couldwell 2011). Following dosing with either intravenous (iv) or oral (po) routes, the only consistently reported adverse events were caused by phototoxicity, the biologic effect that is being exploited and tightly regulated in the topical treatment of CTCL. Minimal blood levels of hypericin were expected to result from low dose topical application of the drug.  
During the Phase 3 trial, serum blood levels of systemic hypericin were assessed at the 
end of the third cycle of therapy (after 5 to 6 weeks of continuous therapy on multiple lesions). Blood samples were taken approximately 24 hours after the application of the drug, the time when the maximal skin effects were seen. Systemic hypericin was not detected in the blood , indicating circulating levels were <5 ng/mL (lower limit of 
detection of the bioanalytical method). 
A subsequent clinical study of 9 patients (HPN- CTCL-02) utilized a modified assay.

achieved steady state by Week 4, as determined with a validated assay with a detection limit of 0.05 ng/mL. Patients within the study had a range of disease involvement (11 to 65% BSA) and average dose application (maximum 1.7 to 10.3 g HyBryte per topical application). Maximum obtained circulating blood concentration was not well- correlated 
with either extent of disease or maximum average applied dose indicating that sys temic 
concentration was likely driven by variability in skin permeability. There was no discernible role of gender or race on the measured systemic concentration. No patient had a blood level >0.5 ng/mL at any timepoint. Blood levels were below detection limit for 7/9 patients by the end of study visit (2 weeks after cessation of dosing), with the remaining 2 patients recording blood concentrations of 0.06 and 0.10 ng/mL. 
In comparison, hypericin levels following oral or iv  administration of the drug in viral 
and cancer trials were up to 10,000-fold higher and the major and dose limiting 
restriction  was photosensitization - the biologic effect being exploited in this CTCL 
treatment.  
1.2.2  Preclinical Pharmacology 
The pharmacology of hypericin has been extensively studied in the literature. Given its unique and highly conjugated structure, hypericin is both extremely chemically stable and easily photoactivated (with visible light in the yellow/red spectrum; 500  to 650 nm). 
While hypericin has been found to have some biological activities in the absence of light, it is between 10- and 100-fold more potent via photoactivated mechanisms, assuming the presence of oxygen. Photoactivation of hypericin contributes to the formation of singlet oxygen and reactive oxygen species (ROS), increasing oxidative stress on the cell (Dąbrowski 2017). Downstream of this oxidative stress, a number of intracellular 
pathways may be activated, depending on the specific characteristics of the cell. Generally speaking, the oxidative stress can drive apoptosis (at lower light/dose concentrations) and necrosis (at higher light/dose concentrations). Malignant cells are generally more sensitive to this oxidative stress condition. 
Hypericin is highly lipophilic, sparingly soluble in aqueous settings, and carries a single 
negative charge at the pHs relevant to the biological milieu. Because of these characteristics, hypericin is rapidly absorbed into the cellular membrane and then redistributed within the cell across all lipoprotein organelles including the Golgi 
apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and lysosomes (de Andrade 2021) .  
In the in vivo setting, hypericin has been found to be tumoritropic, favoring absorption into tumor cells over normal cells. In addition to its increased absorption into tumor cells and potentially other cells lacking E-cadherin, hypericin also has significant necrotic avidity. Indeed, hypericin has been explored as both a photodiagnostic agent (eg, for bladder cancer) and as a radiotherapy (via the use of radioiodinated hypericin).

Amendment 1: 18 September 2023    
Amendment 2: 05 March 2024     The primary mode of biological activity relates to the photoactivation of hypericin, 
forming singlet and triplet hypericin and, upon interaction with oxygen and other intracellular species, generating ROS and driving apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway . The degree of phototoxicity elicited by hypericin is related to its concentration, 
subcellular localization and light intensity  (Jendzelovska 2016). The permeability, 
presence of oxygen and specific intramolecular pathways of the targeted cell will also impact outcomes. Generally, low doses of phototoxicity are associated with apoptosis while higher doses can also result in necrosis (de Andrade 2021). 
Observations in the laboratory of Dr. Alain Rook at the University of Pennsylvania have 
demonstrated a significant antiproliferative effect of synthetic hypericin on activated normal human lymphoid cells upon exposure of the synthetic hypericin- treated cell s to 
visible light (Fox 1998). At concentrations of synthetic hypericin ranging between 0.1 and 0.5 µM, a 20-minute exposure of normal lymphoid cells to fluorescent light resulted in complete inhibition of proliferative responses to the potent mitogens phytohemagglutinin antigen ( PHA) and  concanavalin A  (Con A ). Similarly, malignant T -
cells purified from the blood of patients with Sézary syndrome or the leukemic phase of CTCL  displayed markedly inhibited growth rates in response to T- cell growth factors 
when treated with 0 .3 µM of synthetic hypericin and 20-minute exposure to fluorescent 
light. While the precise mechanism of inhibition of proliferation is unclear, it appears that synthetic hypericin has the capacity to induce a high rate of apoptotic death in both normal and malignant lymphoid cells. The implications of these findings for the use of topical synthetic hypericin to treat CTCL , which is characterized by malignant 
lymphocytic infiltrates in the skin, are significant and serve as the mechanistic basis for the use of HyBryte i n CTCL . 
Selective apoptosis has also been generated for T- cells infected with human T -cell 
leukemic virus type I (HTLV-1), known to be the primary etiologic agent for adult T- cell 
leukemia (ATL). In contrast, primary T-cells were shown to be resistant to apoptosis at similar concentrations and exposure to light between 520 and 750 nm at 11.28 J/cm
2. Cell 
death was partially driven by caspase dependent apoptosis, as demonstrated by the increased concentration of cleaved caspase-3, 7 and 9. Similarly, hypericin  photodynamic 
therapy ( PDT ) was also associated with inhibition of cell cycle progression (arresting 
ATL cells in G2/M phase) and with inhibition of viral genes (Xu 2019). 
Hypericin has been assessed for skin pre-malignancies and malignancies. T opical 
hypericin PDT for actinic keratosis was assessed i n a model in which skin tumors were 
induced in mice by chronic UV irradiation, and antitumor activity of topical hypericin 
(0.1%) kept under occlusion for 24 hours prior to light exposure (587-589 nm, 40 J/cm
2) 
was evaluated by measurement of lesion diameter  (Boiy 2011). Hypericin fluorescence 
accumulated in the stratum corneum prior to irradiation, with greater accumulation in skin that was previously irradiated with UV light to encourage tumor formation and skin with overt lesions. Hypericin PDT groups demonstrated 44% total lesion clearance 3

atypical actinic keratosis cells with normal keratinocytes.  
1.2.3  Potential for Drug- Drug Interactions  
No significant drug-drug interactions are expected due to increased expression or decreased activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes after topical application of HyBryte. 
There are reported interactions between hypericin and cytochrome P450 proteins at 
micromolar dose levels  (Silva 2016). It is unlikely that significant cytochrome P450 
inhibition would occur with the proposed topical application given the very low systemic concentration of hypericin after topical applications. 
1.2.4  Clinical Adverse Event Profile  
The best information on safety comes from the HPN -CTCL -01 Phase 3 study. Treatment 
Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) occurring in at least 3% of patients are shown in 
Table 1, below. In this trial, patients were randomized 2: 1 as HyBryte: placebo and their 3 index lesions were treated 2×/week. In Cycle 1, patients received 6 weeks of treatment with either placebo or HyBryte and in Cycle 2, all patients received 6 weeks of tre atment 
of their index lesions with HyBryte. An optional Cycle 3 was offered that treated all of the patient’s lesions for 6 weeks with HyBryte.

Note:  TEAE was defined as an AE that was new or worsened in severity after the first dose of study drug  
and within 1 month following last evaluation visit. A patient was counted only once f or each AE he/she 
experienced. All AE s were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), 
Version 20.  
Note:  The majority of the AEs  shown were mild, required no intervention or treatment and did not interfere 
with continued use or light therapy and participation in the study. Study drop- out rate during the treatment 
cycles was 1.2% due to AEs.  
1.2.5  Potential Risk to Fetal Development  
Although the available animal data suggest that the risk to pregnancy is low, available 
human data are insufficient to inform the drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Topically applied HyBryte is minimally systemically absorbed and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug. Nonetheless, it is recommended pregnancy be avoided while taking HyBryte and treatments be discontinued immediately if the patient becomes pregnant. 
In a rat developmental t oxicity study, hypericin was evaluated for maternal and 
embryo/fetal toxicity and teratogenic potential when orally administered to pregnant rats 
during the period of organogenesis. There was no evidence of an effect  on in  utero  
growth, survival, or development at any dose level. It is also not known whether HyBryte can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman o r can affect reproductive 
capacity .

4.1 Study Design  
This is a randomized, pilot study assessing outcomes of patients receiving HyBryte 
compared to Valchlor in patients with stage IA, IB, and IIA CTCL. Subjects will be randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with either HyBryte or Valchlor in a 1:1 ratio.  Subjects randomized to HyBryte will apply HyBryte to all accessible lesions followed 21 (±3) hours later by visible light treatment twice per week using the Daavlin 7 Series Phototherapy Device. Treatments will continue twice per week (at least 2 calendar days apart) for a total of 12 weeks of treatment (24 actual treatments). Patients randomized to Valchlor will receive treatment for 12 weeks with Valchlor following the directions in the FDA -approved package insert.  
Patients will come to the clinic for an assessment visit at Baseline, Week 3, Week 6, Week 9, and Week 12. Patients will have mCAILS scores collected on their 3  to 5 index 
lesions, an mSWAT score, PGA, SAEQ completed, and a SCORD score collected.  
For patients randomized to HyBryte, the assessments will be conducted immediately prior to light treatment at the second light treatment visit of the evaluation week  (ie, 
Week 3, 6, 9, 12) immediately prior to the corresponding light treatment. 
Patients will return to the clinic for follow -up visits and have assessments (mCAILS, 
mSWAT, PGA, SAEQ, and SCORD) at Week 13, Week 14, and Week 16/End of Study. Safety laboratory assessment s and physical exams will be done at Baseline, the Week 12 
assessment visit, and the Week 16/End of Study visit. Vital signs will be collected at 
Baseline and Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14 and 16. Adverse events will be collected throughout the study.

6.1 General Instructions  
This is a pilot, randomized, open-label, active comparator, US, single- center trial in 
which patients will be randomized to receive HyBryte or Valchlor in a 1:1 randomization. 
Patients will be treated for 12 weeks and follow-up visits will be conducted 1, 2, and 4 weeks after completion of the treatment phase of the trial.  
Patients randomized to HyBryte will have HyBryte applied twice weekly  and an opaque 
covering applied for 21 (±3) hours followed by the administration of visible light 
encompassing wavelength s of 500 to 650 nm. The light will be administered with a 
precisely calibrated device with a light dose starting at 6 J/cm
2 twice weekly that is 
titrated up  according to the physician’s discretion on subsequent sessions, limited by 
occurrence of Grade 2 erythema  or greater  but targeting a mild, Grade 1 reaction 
immediately following the light treatment. All of the patient’s lesions that are readily available for exposure to the visible light source will be treated . 
Patients randomized to Valchlor will apply a thin film of Valchlor gel once daily to affected areas of the skin  and the dosing will follow the instructions for use in the 
package insert.  
Prior to randomization, each patient will have at least 3 and up to 5 index lesions identified. These lesions should be representative of the patient’s treated lesions and, if the patient has both plaque and patch lesions, include approximately the same distribution as the patient’s other lesions.

7.2 Safety Assessments  
7.2.1  Dermatologic Assessment  Grading  
For patients randomized to the HyBryte treatment arm, immediately prior to and 
approximately 10 to 30 minutes  after  the completion of light therapy, treated lesions and 
surrounding areas will be graded for erythema, pain, pruritus, edema, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, rash, and vesiculation, with the average score recorded. The reaction will be graded using the definitions in Table 4 . 
7.2.2  SCORD Scoring  
The Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) tool is well established in Dermatology to provide a numeric assessment of the degree and severity of dermatitis in atopic dermatitis. Recently, this tool was modified to assess the severity of dermatitis in CTCL patients undergoing mechlorethamine treatment  (Alexander -Savino 2022). This score is 
calculated as:  
• the percent of CTCL lesion showing dermatitis  
• the severity of the dermatitis on a 3 -point scale (0 -none, 1- mild, 2 -moderate, 3-
severe) for redness, oozing/crusting, scratch marks, skin thickening, and dryness 
• the patient’s self -reported assessment of itch  
The scoring form for SCORD is attached in Appendix 20.2 APPENDIX II – SCORD Calculation Worksheet  on page  69.

Amendment 1: 18 September 2023    
Amendment 2: 05 March 2024     9 ADVERSE EVENTS 
Timely, accurate and complete reporting and analysis of safety information from trials is 
crucial for the protection of subjects, investigators and the Sponsor, and is mandated by 
regulatory agencies worldwide. Soligenix has established standard operating procedures 
(SOPs) in conformity with regulatory requirements to ensure appropriate reporting of safety information. All trials that are the responsibility of Soligenix must be conducted in accordance with the procedures as provided below. 
9.1 Definitions  
9.1.1  Adverse Experience (AE)  
Any noxious or unintended event that occurs in association with the use of an 
investigational agent in humans , whether considered related to the investigational agent 
or not. This definition encompasses symptoms or signs reported by the subject or detected by the Investigator or other competent observer, as well as medically important deviations from normality in the results of ancillary investigations. If present at time of first dose of study drug, such AEs must be recorded as part of the medical history. 
9.1.2  Treatment -Emergent AE  
An AE that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency following entry into the study. In addition, any pathological finding on physical examination or diagnostic 
procedure that is new in occurrence or exacerbated in comparison with the subject's status 
at study entry is considered a treatment- emergent AE if it requires any medical or 
surgical intervention whatsoever (including, but not limited to, additional diagnostic procedures or alteration of prescribed therapy). 
9.1.3  Potentially Serious Adverse Experience  
Any AE that is sufficiently severe or alarming as to require any form of significant 
medical intervention. Note: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the SAE definition. 
9.2 Relationship to Study Drug 
The relationship of an AE to the assigned study drug is assessed using the following 
definitions: 
Not Related : The drug experience is clearly related to other factors such as the 
patient’s/subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs. 
Possibly Related:  The drug experience follows a reasonable sequence from the 
time of drug administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the

Amendment 2: 05 March 2024     study drug, but could have been produced by other factors such as the 
patient’s/subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs. 
Related:  The drug experience follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the 
time of drug administration and follows a known response pattern to the study 
drug, and cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as the 
patient’s/subject’s clinical state, the rapeutic interventions or concomitant 
drugs. 
9.3 Severity of Adverse Event  
A clinical determination of the intensity of an AE should be done for all reported AEs. The severity assessment for AEs should be completed using the following definitions as guidelines: 
Mild:  Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated. 
Moderate:  Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity. 
Severe:  Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity. 
Not applicable:   In some cases, an AE may be an “all or nothing” finding, which 
cannot be graded. 
9.4 Recording Adverse Events  
All AEs, whether judged to be related or not to the study drug, should be recorded in both 
the medical record and the CRF. If photographic evidence is available and relevant, it 
may be recorded. The start and resolution dates, the judgment of the severity of the AE, the judgment of the relationship of the AE to the study drug, the action taken for subsequent dose of study drug, and the outcome should be noted.

Amendment 1: 18 September 2023    
Amendment 2: 05 March 2024     10 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  
10.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is any event that meets any of the following criteria:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received study drug 
• Other: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospitalization, may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical inter vention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such events are:  
o Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm 
o Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization 
o Development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
10.2 Definition of Terms  
Life threatening:  An AE is life threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred; ie, it does not include a reaction that if it had occurred in a more serious form might have caused death. For example, drug induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life threatening 
even though drug induced hepatitis can be fatal. 
Hospitalization:  AEs requiring hospitalization should be considered SAEs. 
Hospitalization for elective surgery or routine clinical procedures that are not the result of 
AE (eg, elective surgery for a pre-existing condition that has not worsened) need not be considered AEs or SAEs. If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, that occurrence must be reported as an AE, either 'serious' or 'non-serious' according to the usual criteria.  
In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or

Amendment 1: 18 September 2023    
Amendment 2: 05 March 2024     12 ETHICS AND RESPONSIBILITIES  
12.1 Good Clinical Practice  
The study will be performed in accordance with the ethical principles in the Declaration 
of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practices  (GCPs)  and applicable regulatory requirements.  
12.2 Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
The final study protocol, including the final version of the Subject Information and Consent Forms, must be approved in writing by an IRB that meets the minimum FDA standards before enrollment of any subject into the study. The PI or their designee is responsible for informing the IRB of any SAE and amendment(s) to the protocol as per regulatory requirements. 
12.3 Informed Consent  
The Investigator will ensure that the subject or a legally authorized representative of the 
subject is  given full and adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, 
possible risk and benefit of the study. Subjects must also be notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any time. The subject should be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided. The subject’s signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study specific procedure. The consent form that is used must meet the requirements as outlined in the ICH Guidance on GCPs (E6) and must be approved by both the reviewing IRB and by Soligenix. 
12.4 Subject data protection 
The Subject Information and Consent Form will explain that study data will be stored in a 
computer database, maintaining confidentiality. Subjects in this database will be identified by initials or enrollment code/subject number only. Authorized representatives of a regulatory authority (eg, FDA) may require direct access to parts of the trial site records relevant to the study, including subjects’ medical history for data verification purposes. 
12.5 Financial Disclosure  
The FDA has issued regulations (21 CFR Part 54) that require Sponsors (in this case 
Soligenix) to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements to certify the absence of certain financial interests of clinical investigators and/or dis close 
those financial interests, as required, when clinical studies are submitted to the FDA in support of marketing approval of a new drug application (NDA). These regulations are intended to ensure that financial interests and arrangements of clinical investigators, that

identified and disclosed by the Sponsor. 
Clinical investigators shall be asked to disclose proprietary ( eg, patent, licensing 
agreement) and financial (eg,  stock options, royalty) interests as they pertain to Soligenix, 
prior to participating in the study. In addition, clinical investigators will be required to 
consult with Soligenix before acquiring any financial interest in the company and must disclose an y change in their proprietary or financial interests if it occurs during the course 
of the study and for one year following study completion. Clinical Investigator is defined under Title 21 CFR Part 54 as an investigator or sub-investigator listed on the FDA Form 1572 that is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects. The requirement for proprietary and financial disclosure also includes any ownership by the spouse or any dependent child of the investigator. 
If the FDA determines that the financial interests of any clinical investigator raise serious 
questions about the integrity of the data, the FDA will take any action it deems necessary to ensure the reliability of the data, including: 
• Initiating agency audits of the data derived from the clinical investigator in question; 
• Requesting that the Sponsor submit further analyses of data, eg, to evaluate the effect 
of the clinical investigator’s data on overall study outcome; 
• Requesting that the applicant conduct additional independent studies to confirm the 
results of the questioned study; and/or 
• Refusing to treat the covered clinical study as providing data that can be the basis for 
an agency action.  
If the Sponsor does not include certification or disclosure, or both, if required, or does not certify that it was not possible to obtain the information, the FDA may refuse to file the NDA.

actions concerning the study. 
14.1.3  Monitoring Visits  
Soligenix or their trained designee will perform on -site monitoring visits as frequently as 
it deems necessary. At these visits, the site monitor will compare the data entered into the CRFs with the source documents and check for protocol compliance including a record of 
informed consent, enrollment criteria, all subject assessments, all AE s and all 
concomitant medications. In addition, study drug and supporting records will be 
reviewed. Additionally, they assure that all serious, life- threatening or fatal AE s are being 
reported immediately [and in no case later than twenty -four (24) hours after the event] to 
the Medical Monitor or designee at Soligenix. 
Findings from these reviews will be discussed with the investigator and staff. Completed 
pages of the CRFs will be evaluated at each visit. The dates of the monitoring visits will 
be recorded in a sign -in log that will be kept at the site. The study coordinator and 
investigator are expected to be available for questions, the source documentation readily available, and a suitable environment provided for review of study- related documents.

Amendment 1: 18 September 2023    
Amendment 2: 05 March 2024     15 AMENDMENTS  
Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immediate risk to study subjects, 
may be made only by Soligenix. A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to subjects may be implemented immediately, provided the IRB/IEC is notified within 5 days. 
Any permanent change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. The 
written amendment must be submitted to the IRB/IEC and the investigator must await approval before implementing the changes. Soligenix will submit protocol amendments to the appropriate regulatory authorities for approval. 
If in the judgment of the IRB/IEC, the investigator, and/or Soligenix, the amendment to 
the protocol substantially changes the study design and/or increases the potential risk to the subject and/or has an impact on the subject's involvement as a study participant, the currently approved written informed consent form will re quire similar modification. In 
such cases, informed consent will be renewed for subjects enrolled in the study before continued participation.

Amendment 1: 18 September 2023    
Amendment 2: 05 March 2024     PREAMBLE  
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as 
a statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research on identifiable human material and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should be applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs. 
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to 
physicians. The WMA encourages others who are involved in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles. 
GENERAL PRINCIPLES  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of 
Medical Ethics declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient’s best interest when 
providing medical care.” 
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well-being and 
rights of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician’s knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty. 
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving 
human subjects. 
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand 
the causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best proven interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all human subjects and protect their health and rights. 
8. While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal 
can never take precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects.  
9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, integrity, right to self-determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal information of research subjects. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the physician or other health care professionals and never with the research subjects, even though they have given consent.

Original: 02 August 2023    
Amendment 1: 18 September 2023    
Amendment 2: 05 March 2024     10. Physicians must consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for 
research involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international norms and standards. No national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
11. Medical research should be conducted in a manner that minimises possible harm to the environment. 
12. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by individuals 
with the appropriate ethics and scientific education, training and qualifications. Research on patients or healthy volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician or other health care professional. 
13. Groups that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate access to participation in research.  
14. Physicians who combine medical research with medical care should involve their patients in research only to the extent that this is justified by its potential preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic value and if the physician has good reason to believe t hat 
participation in the research study will not adversely affect the health of the patients who serve as research subjects.  
15. Appropriate compensation and treatment for subjects who are harmed as a result of participating in research must be ensured. 
RISKS, BURDENS AND BENEFITS  
16. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and burdens. 
Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance of 
the objective outweighs the risks and burdens to the research subjects. 
17. All medical research involving human subjects must be preceded by careful 
assessment of predictable risks and burdens to the individuals and groups involved in the research in comparison with foreseeable benefits to them and to other individuals or groups affected by the condition under investigation. 
Measures to minimise the risks must be implemented. The risks must be continuously monitored, assessed and documented by the researcher. 
18. Physicians may not be involved in a research study involving human subjects unless 
they are confident that the risks have been adequately assessed and can be satisfactorily managed.

Original: 02 August 2023    
Amendment 1: 18 September 2023    
Amendment 2: 05 March 2024     When the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or when there is conclusive 
proof of definitive outcomes, physicians must assess whether to continue, modify or immediately stop the study.  
VULNERABLE GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS  
19. Some groups and individuals are particularly vulnerable and may have an increased likelihood of being wronged or of incurring additional harm. 
All vulnerable groups and individuals should receive specifically considered protection. 20. Medical research with a vulnerable group is only justified if the research is responsive 
to the health needs or priorities of this group and the research cannot be carried out in a non-vulnerable group. In addition, this group should stand to benefit from the knowledge, practices or interventions that result from the research.  
SCIENTIFIC REQUIREMENTS AND RESEARCH PROTOCOLS  
21. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, anima l 
experimentation. The welfare of animals used for research must be respected.  
22. The design and performance of each research study involving human subjects must be clearly described and justified in a research protocol. 
The protocol should contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and should 
indicate how the principles in this Declaration have been addressed. The protocol should include information regarding funding, sponsors, institutional affiliations, potential conflicts of interest, incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the research study. 
In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post- trial 
provisions. 
RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEES  
23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and 
approval to the concerned research ethics committee before the study begins. This 
committee must be transparent in its functioning, must be independent of the researcher, 
the sponsor and any other undue influence and must be duly qualified. It must take into consideration the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but these must

Amendment 2: 05 March 2024     not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth 
in this Declaration.  
The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide monitoring information to the committee, especially information about any serious adverse events. No amendment to the protocol may be made without consideration and approval by the committee. After the end of the study, the researchers must submit a final report to the committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions. 
PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the confidentiality of their personal information. 
INFORMED CONSENT  
25. Participation by individuals capable of giving informed consent as subjects in medical research must be voluntary. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or community leaders, no individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she freely agrees.  
26. In medical research involving human subjects capable of giving informed consent, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the research er, the 
anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail, post-study provisions and any other relevant aspects of the study. The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. Special attention should be given to the specific information needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the information. 
After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician or 
another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject’s freely-given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expr essed in 
writing, the non-written consent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
All medical research subjects should be given the option of being informed about the 
general outcome and results of the study. 
27. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician 
must be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed cons ent must 
be sought by an appropriately qualified individual who is completely independent of this relationship.

Amendment 1: 18 September 2023    
Amendment 2: 05 March 2024     28. For a potential research subject who is incapable of giving informed consent, the 
physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorised representative. These individuals must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of bene fit for 
them unless it is intended to promote the health of the group represented by the potential subject, the research cannot instead be performed with persons capable of providing informed consent, and the research entails only minimal risk and minimal burden. 
29. When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable of giving informed 
consent is able to give assent to decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorised represent ative. 
The potential subject’s dissent should be respected. 
30. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving 
consent, for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research   group. In such circumstances the physician must seek informed consent from 
the legally authorised representative. If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the research  must be 
obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally authorised representative. 
31. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to 
the research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw from the study must never adversely affect the patient-physici an relationship. 
32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on material or data contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed consent for its collection, storage and/or reuse. There may be exceptional situations where consent would be impossible or impracticable to obtain for such research. In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  
USE OF PLACEBO  
33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances: 
Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; 
or 
Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any 
intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention

Amendment 2: 05 March 2024     and the patients who receive any intervention less effective than the best proven one, 
placebo, or no intervention will not be subject to additional risks of serious or irreversible harm as a result of not receiving the best proven intervention. 
Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. 
POST- TRIAL PROVISIONS  
34. In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments 
should make provisions for post- trial access for all participants who still need an 
intervention identified as beneficial in the trial. This information must also be dis closed 
to participants during the informed consent process. 
RESEARCH REGISTRATION AND PUBLICATION AND 
DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS  
35. Every research study involving human subjects must be registered in a publicly 
accessible database before recruitment of the first subject.  
36. Researchers, authors, sponsors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the publication and dissemination of the results of research. Researchers have a duty to make publicly available the results of their research on human subjects and are accountable for the completeness and accuracy of their reports. All parties should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results must be published or otherwise made publicly avail able. Sources of 
funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest must be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for publication. 
UNPROVEN INTERVENTIONS IN CLINICAL PRACTICE  
37. In the treatment of an individual patient, where proven interventions do not exist or other known interventions have been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent from the patient or a legally authorised representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the physician’s judgement it offers hope of saving life, re-establishing health or alleviating suffering. This intervention should subsequently be 
made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and  efficacy. In all cases, new 
information must be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available.

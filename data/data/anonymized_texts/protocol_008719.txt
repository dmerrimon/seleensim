Protocol Title A Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel Group, 
Dose-Response Study of Meloxicam in The Treatment of Post-Surgical Dental 
Pain.
Protocol 
NumberMELO-TFZ-2001
Study Sites The study is planned to be conducted at 1 study site.
Study Period 
PlannedThe study is planned to be conducted over a period of approximately 3 months.
Duration of 
Individual 
TreatmentThe duration from screening to follow up is expected to be approximately 
1.5 months.
Subjects will be dosed with study drug twice on Day 1.
End of Study End of study is defined as last subject, last visit.
Background 
and RationaleThe effective treatment of pain is important to both patients and to wider society. 
Inadequately controlled pain negatively affects quality of life and function, and 
in a post-surgical environment it affects the functional recovery, the risk of 
post-surgical complications, and the risk of persistent post-surgical pain.
Finding alternatives to opioids can expand safe and effective options in pain 
management to meet this important public health need and help to reduce the 
public health burden from adverse outcomes related to prescribed opioids.
Meloxicam is a member of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
group of medications that exhibit anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity in 
clinical studies. NSAIDs have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of acute 
pain; however, current oral formulations of meloxicam are not suitable for the 
treatment of acute pain due to a relatively slow absorption. In contrast, an 
intravenous (IV) formulation of meloxicam has recently demonstrated efficacy 
in models of acute pain.
This formulation of meloxicam is being developed to provide a rapid absorption 
of meloxicam from an oral dose. 
This is the first assessment of efficacy of this formulation of meloxicam in 
subjects with acute pain; however, it is anticipated to provide analgesia to these 
subjects due to the rapid absorption demonstrated in Study  
and the efficacy observed for a co-crystal of meloxicam (MECC-SA) that 
demonstrated efficacy in Study MECC-TBZ-2001. The efficacy dose-response 
profile of meloxicam is currently unknown, and the purpose of this study is to 
establish an understanding of the dose-response relationship for this formulation.
The dental pain model is considered an ideal model of post-surgical acute pain 
as it has high assay sensitivity and is predictive of efficacy in later stage models. 
It is also ideal as the surgery, the anesthetic regimen, and perioperative care 
protocols can be standardized across patients. The dental surgical model has 
demonstrated the efficacy of analgesic medications across a range of different 
pharmacology, including NSAIDs and opioids and, more specifically, has 

Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 4 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0 15 February 2022 Confidentialdemonstrated efficacy for an IV formulation of meloxicam.

Methodology This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
dose-response study, randomizing and dosing approximately 108 male or female 
subjects who have had dental surgery (removal of ≥2 third molars) performed. 
Subjects will receive study drug on Day 1.
The study design is consistent with research design recommendations of the 
IMMPACT (Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in 
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 6 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0 15 February 2022 ConfidentialClinical Trials) group for trials involving subjects with short-duration acute pain.
Subjects will attend screening at Visit 1, to occur within 30 days prior to the 
planned dental surgery.
The subjects will have the operation performed on Day 1 using appropriate local 
anesthesia and sedation (performed using nitrous oxide and a local injection of 
lidocaine with epinephrine). Subjects will also receive prophylactic antibiotics 
post-surgically.
Pain Intensity (PI) (using a 0-10-point numeric rating scale [NRS] where 0 is no 
pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable) will be assessed during the 5 hours 
following surgery. If the subject scores an NRS ≥5 and a rating of moderate or 
severe pain on a 4-point categorical pain rating scale (i.e., none, mild, moderate, 
severe) during this time they will be eligible for randomization (eligibility 
assessment). An additional PI assessment will be made immediately prior to 
dosing which will be used as the baseline value; a subject will be dosed only if 
the NRS score of the second assessment is ≥5 (baseline assessment). 
Randomization will take place between eligibility and baseline PI assessment. A 
diary/source document will be used to record the pain scores.
Subjects will be randomized to receive either meloxicam tablets (1.25 mg BID, 
5 mg BID, 15 mg BID) or placebo after the assessment of the subject’s 
eligibility pain score at Visit 2. Thus, randomization will take place between 
eligibility and baseline PI assessment.
Dosing of study medication must be within 15 minutes of the eligible PI score 
assessment (eligibility assessment) and immediately after the pre-dose PI score 
assessment (baseline assessment).
PI scores (NRS) will be measured at 15, 30, and 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, and 24 hours after the first dose of study medication, 
as well as immediately before any rescue medication and/or at the time of early 
termination.
A Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of pain control will be made at 24 hours 
post-dose, rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 to 4, where 0-poor, 1-fair, 2-
good, 3-very good, or 4-excellent and/or at the time of early termination. 
The times to first perceptible relief and meaningful pain relief will be determined 
using the double-stopwatch technique. The time to onset of first perceptible 
relief (time that the first watch is stopped) is defined as the post-dose time at 
which the subject first begins to feel pain relief. The time to meaningful pain 
relief (time that the second watch is stopped) is defined as the post-dose time at 
which the subject begins to feel meaningful pain relief. If a subject takes rescue 
medication prior to recording perceptible or meaningful pain relief, the 
stopwatches will be collected, and no further assessments of these endpoints will 
be collected.
Rescue medication of  will be 
allowed at any time, but subjects will be encouraged to wait until at least 
 post-dose if possible. A PI score assessment will be made immediately 
prior to any rescue medication.
PK samples will be taken pre-dose and 15, 30, and 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 

Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 7 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0 15 February 2022 Confidential6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20, and 24 hours after the first dose at Day 1.
Subjects will be discharged from the clinic following the 24-hour assessments; if 
the subject requires a longer duration of in-patient assessment due to reasons 
associated with the surgery, this is acceptable.
A final follow-up telephone call will occur approximately 5 days after the last 
dose of study drug administration.
Safety will be assessed via recording of AEs, safety laboratory testing, and 
pre-and post-dose 12-lead ECGs and vital signs.
Adverse events of special interest will include those related to gastrointestinal 
(GI) AEs, particularly bleeds and those related to serious cardiovascular (CV) 
events.
Unless consent is withdrawn, subjects who prematurely terminate study drug 
will have discharge procedures performed at that time or at an early termination 
(ET) visit scheduled as soon as possible.
Study 
TreatmentTreatments to be received during the study will include one of the following 
treatment arms:
1. Meloxicam 1.25 mg BID.
2. Meloxicam 5 mg BID.
3. Meloxicam 15 mg BID
4. Placebo BID.
To maintain the blind due to differences in appearance between the tablets, 
subjects will receive in a double dummy design, three tablets when dosed (one 
that is representative of a 1.25 mg tablet, one that is representative of a 5 mg 
tablet and one that is representative of a 15 mg tablet). Due to the 
double-dummy design, neither the subject, nor the Investigator will know what 
treatment a subject receives. Per the clinic procedures, subjects will also be 
blindfolded during dosing.

Planned 
Number of 
SubjectsApproximately 108 subjects (N=27/treatment arm) dosed to give approximately 
100 evaluable subjects for the primary endpoint (N=25/treatment arm).
Statistical 
MethodsIn order to derive the required sample size for the primary estimand,  
for 10 mg 
BID, 15 mg BID and placebo reported from a previous meloxicam study 
conducted by the Sponsor (MECC-TBZ-2001 in dental pain). Simulations were 

Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 11 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0 15 February 2022 Confidentialperformed  
 
 
. The numerical dose 
values were  for, 1.25 mg BID, 5 mg BID, 15 mg BID and 
placebo respectively.
The results of the simulations indicate the following values for power, for 
25 subjects per group, assuming a standard deviation (SD) of : 
Dose Expected Effect Size (versus Placebo) Power
Note tha
t the expected standardized effect sizes (expected effect size divided by 
SD) are approximately  (15 mg BID, 5 mg BID and 
1.25 mg BID, respectively); therefore, the comparisons 15 mg BID vs. placebo, 
5 mg BID vs. placebo and 1.25 mg BID vs. placebo have approximately %, 
% and % power to declare statistical significance for standardized effect 
sizes of , respectively.
To analyze W6LOCF SPID 0-24 hours, a 3-parameter E max model will be fitted 
to the observed mean for each dose and placebo. Effect sizes for each dose 
versus placebo and associated standard errors, p-values and 95% CIs will be 
calculated. Standardized effect sizes will also be estimated from the E max model 
(effect sizes for each dose versus placebo divided by the pooled SD together 
with their 95% confidence intervals. Baseline pain intensity score (PI) will be 
used as a covariate in the E max model. Baseline is defined as the pre-dosing PI 
score. The numerical dose values will be 2.5, 10, 30, and 0 for 1.25 mg BID, 5 
mg BID, 15 mg BID, and placebo, respectively.
If the E max model fails to converge, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will 
be used to assess the difference between treatment groups. The ANCOVA model 
will include treatment as fixed effect and baseline PI score as a covariate. The 
difference between meloxicam and placebo will be estimated from the least 
squares means (LS means) along with the 95% CI and associated 2-sided p-
values. In addition, the standardized effect sizes for each dose will be calculated 
by dividing the differences in LS means for each dose and placebo by the pooled 
standard deviation.
Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for meloxicam (C max, AUC 0-2, AUC 0-4, 
AUC 0-8, AUC 0-12 and AUC 0-24) will also be calculated. The relationship between 
PK parameters and efficacy will explored graphically.

16, 20, and 24 hours after the first dose of study medication.
9All AEs will be recorded from time of consent until the telephone follow up/End of Study 
(EOS) Visit. The Investigator is also responsible for notifying the Sponsor if they become 
aware of any AE after the study period has ended and it is considered related to the study 
medication. When assessing AEs, the subject will be specifically asked regarding the presence 
of any GI symptoms. 
10Pain assessments (Pain Intensity and Categorical Pain Rating) performed for up to 5 hours 
after completion of surgery. Subjects with NRS ≥5 and a rating of moderate or severe pain on a 
4-point categorical pain rating scale (i.e., none, mild, moderate, severe) during this time they 
will be eligible for randomization. Randomization will take place between eligibility and 
baseline assessment.
11Pain assessment (Pain Intensity) performed immediately pre-dosing. The subject will be dosed 
only if the pre-dose PI NRS score is ≥ 5. This pre-dose pain assessment serves as the baseline 
assessment.
12Drug is dispensed at ‘time zero’ and approximately 12 hours later.
13Dosing of study medication must be within 15 minutes of the eligibility pain assessment and 
immediately after baseline PI assessment.

Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidential1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Indication
Acute, post-operative pain.
1.2 Background and Rationale
The effective treatment of pain is important to both patients and to wider society. 
Inadequately controlled pain negatively affects quality of life and function, and in a 
post-surgical environment, it affects the functional recovery, the risk of post-surgical 
complications, and the risk of persistent post-surgical pain [ 1].
Opioids have been used to treat many forms of pain in the US, sometimes unnecessarily or 
inappropriately, leading to extensive misuse of these powerful medications and culminating 
in the current health crisis. It is estimated that 115 Americans die every day from opioid 
induced overdoses and that in 2015 alone, the cost to the US economy of the opioid epidemic 
was $504 billion [ 2]. Opioid related deaths have been hugely problematic for several years 
with an opioid drug overdose rate in 2015 of 10.4 per 100,000 [3], increasing to 14.9 per 
100,000 in 2017 [4]. In 2018, there were 67,367 deaths that occurred due to drug overdose 
with 69.5% involving an opioid [4] and the opioid death rate remained high at 14.6 per 
100,000 [ 4]. Clearly the misuse of opioids has a huge impact both on individual patients and 
their families but also on the wider society. The Centers for Disease Control have also 
determined through a meta-analysis that opioid therapy prescribed to treat acute pain is 
associated with a greater likelihood of long-term opioid use [5]. Therefore, reducing opioid 
use or replacing opioids with alternative drugs would be advisable. Advice from groups such 
as Washington State Agency Medical Directors’ Group is that post-surgical use of opioids 
should be avoided where possible with alternative drugs offered as analgesia or minimized 
[6].
Alternatives to opioids can expand safe and effective options in pain management to meet 
this important public health need and help to reduce the public health burden from adverse 
outcomes related to prescribed opioids. 
Meloxicam is a member of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) group of 
medications that exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic and analgesic activity in clinical 
studies. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment 
of chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis [7] and acute 
pain [8]; [9]. NSAIDs are currently recommended by the American College of Rheumatology 
for the treatment of osteoarthritis [10] and have indications for the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA); however, most recent treatment guidelines for RA have focused on disease 
modification rather than analgesia [11]; [12]. NSAIDs are considered generally safe for 
short-term use with the following exceptions: patients with NSAID-exacerbated respiratory 
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 26 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidentialdisease, patients with prior myocardial infarction who are receiving antithrombotic therapy, 
patients with asthma, and patients with a history of renal disease [13].
The apparent primary mechanism of action of meloxicam, and of other NSAIDs, is the 
reduction of prostaglandin (PG) production through its inhibitory activity against 
cyclo-oxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) [14]. Meloxicam is currently approved in oral 
formulations in the US as a treatment for chronic diseases: osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, 
and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis pauciarticular and polyarticular course (at the 7.5 mg dose 
only in children that weigh ≥60 kg). An IV formulation of meloxicam is currently approved 
in the US for the management of moderate-severe pain. 
Meloxicam is available in tablet form; (MOBIC® [Boehringer Ingelheim] and various generic 
forms and QMIIZ® orally disintegrating tablets [Tersera Therapeutics]) and in capsule form 
(VIVLODEX® [Iroko Pharmaceuticals]). MOBIC is approved at doses of 7.5 and 15 mg once 
per day and VIVLODEX is approved at doses of 5 and 10 mg once per day. Meloxicam has 
been extensively studied in humans as MOBIC and VIVLODEX in chronic pain indications, 
including osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Meloxicam has also been approved by the 
US FDA in an intravenous formulation as ANJESO® (Baudax Bio, Inc) at a dose of 30 mg for 
the management of moderate-severe pain.
Based on the demonstration that meloxicam is effective for the treatment of chronic pain such 
as osteoarthritis at doses of ≥7.5 mg/day and that this effect is mediated by inhibition of 
cyclooxygenase, a concentration of approximately 1090 ng/mL, which is similar to the steady 
state concentration of 7.5 mg meloxicam, would be considered sufficient for mediating an 
analgesic response [15]. Ex vivo assays performed on samples taken from subjects receiving 
7.5 mg meloxicam have demonstrated an 83% inhibition of COX-2 [15].
Gastrointestinal (GI) AEs were the most frequently reported AEs in all treatment groups 
across MOBIC trials, reflective of the safety profile of meloxicam. The most commonly 
reported AEs in both short-term and long-term studies of MOBIC in osteoarthritis are 
summarized in Table 3.

Higher doses of MOBIC (22.5 mg and greater) have been associated with an increased risk of 
serious GI events, however the predicted exposure associated with 22.5 mg MOBIC is greater 
than that observed with this formulation of meloxicam 15 mg in Study .
Furthermore, a recently completed study in dental extraction (MECC-TBZ-2001,

As discussed in the most recent specific Cochrane Review of meloxicam [16] and the general 
review of NSAIDs for the treatment of acute pain [8], current oral formulations of meloxicam 
(e.g., MOBIC and VIVLODEX) are not indicated for, nor are they suitable for, the treatment 
of acute pain due to the delayed absorption of the product. 
Meloxicam however, has demonstrated efficacy in a number of clinical studies using 
intramuscular (IM) and intravenous (IV) formulations, including short-term studies in dental 
extraction [17]; [18] and post-bunionectomy surgery [19]; [20]. Some data are suggestive that 
IM meloxicam has a more rapid onset than oral meloxicam in rheumatoid arthritis pain [21] 
and sciatica [22]. Furthermore, a recently completed study (MECC-TBZ-2001, IND , 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) demonstrated efficacy in a study in dental extraction for an oral co-crystal 
formulation of meloxicam: salicylic acid (MECC-SA). This study demonstrated that 
MECC-SA, at both doses (10 and 15 mg) and regimens (QD and BID) tested, was more 
effective than placebo at reducing subjects’ post-surgical dental pain (Table 5).

It is important to note that for these data using the W2LOCF approach, the rescue medication 
that subjects received (   
), with a recommended dosage of every 4-6 hours) was likely to still be exerting analgesic 
effects at the end of the 2-hour censoring period. In addition, the majority of subjects in each 
dose group received rescue medication within 2 hours after surgery, indicating a longer 
censoring period may be useful to interpret the data considering the likely impact of rescue 
medication use on a large number of subjects. While a clear dose-response relationship was 
not established for any individual endpoint, the overall results (including secondary endpoints 
such as time to perceptible pain relief and rescue medication use) indicated that 15 mg may 
be more effective than 10 mg, and that BID regimens may be more effective than QD 
regimens. 
This formulation of meloxicam is being developed to provide a rapid absorption of 
meloxicam from an oral dose and has been studied in two Phase 1 studies (  
and ) in healthy subjects. The product demonstrated

Table 6: MELO-TFZ-1001 Pharmacokinetic Summary, Fasting Conditions
Comparing the data from Study  to previous studies of MECC-SA and the 
direct comparison between the formulations in , it is estimated that a 
15 mg dose of meloxicam may have more rapid absorption than MECC-SA but with similar 
overall exposure and therefore acute analgesia could be anticipated to be similar or better 
than that observed for MECC-SA in Study MECC-TBZ-2001.
It should be noted that while the C max of meloxicam following dosing with 15 mg meloxicam 
was approximately  than that of 15 mg MOBIC, the overall exposure (AUC) was 
 The combination of similar overall exposure with the anticipated acute use of this 
formulation of meloxicam means that use of 15 mg meloxicam is considered safe, especially 
as ANJESO (IV meloxicam) 30 mg has a reported C max of 7972.5 ng/mL and an AUC inf of 
121437.6 ng.hr/mL.

data from Study , predicted exposure for BID dosing of meloxicam are 
summarized in Table 8.

Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialTable 8: Meloxicam Predicted Exposure After Single Doses, and Twice Daily 
Dosing vs. MECC-SA BID, MOBIC, and ANJESO
The predicted (using data from Study ) exposure for 15 mg BID (i.e., two 
doses over 24 hours) meloxicam will  
, however, the overall exposure and C max (after the second dose) would be  
 and therefore for use in the treatment of acute pain it can be 
anticipated that meloxicam will be well-tolerated. Furthermore, the meloxicam exposure of 
15 mg BID meloxicam is anticipated to be similar to that of  in a study of dental 
extraction (Study MECC-TBZ-2001); as MECC-SA was well-tolerated in that study it can be 
anticipated that meloxicam will also be well-tolerated.
Meloxicam was well tolerated in Studies  and . No 
adverse events were reported during  and only a small number of mild 
adverse events were reported during .
No clinically significant changes in vital signs, ECG parameters, or laboratory safety tests 
(other than mentioned above) occurred, and no SAEs occurred during the studies.
1.3 Investigational Product
This formulation of meloxicam is being developed to provide a rapid absorption of 
meloxicam from an oral dose. 
Considering that meloxicam is a BCS Class II compound, the rate-limiting step for 
meloxicam absorption is solubility. This formulation of meloxicam includes within the 
formulation  for the 15 mg strength,  for the 
5 mg strength and  for the 1.25 mg strength to increase the rate of 
absorption of meloxicam by increasing its solubility and dissolution. The efficacy 

Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 33 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidentialdose response profile of meloxicam is currently unknown, and the purpose of this study is to 
establish an understanding of the dose-response relationship for this formulation of 
meloxicam.
1.4 Ethics and Benefit-Risk Considerations
As discussed in Section 1.2, meloxicam has been extensively studied and subsequently 
prescribed for the treatment of chronic pain associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid 
arthritis, but oral forms of meloxicam have not been used to treat acute pain due to slow 
absorption of the drug. A rapidly absorbing form of meloxicam should demonstrate efficacy 
in the treatment of acute pain and if the drug has a similar overall exposure (and lower than 
that of IV meloxicam) to that of other oral meloxicam products the safety profile should be 
similar. 
This is the first assessment of efficacy of this formulation of meloxicam in subjects with 
acute pain, however it is anticipated to provide analgesia to these subjects due to  
 demonstrated in . It is estimated that a 
15 mg dose of meloxicam would exceed within approximately  of 
dosing, therefore acute analgesia could be anticipated at or around this time. Lower doses of 
meloxicam may not exceed  and may not provide adequate analgesia; however, 
they are needed in this study to fully understand the dose-response profile of meloxicam.
As the meloxicam exposure data for this formulation of meloxicam is similar to MECC-SA it 
is appropriate to use the data from MECC-TBZ-2001 to dose-select for the study of 
meloxicam. Using the data from MECC-TBZ-2001 and an E max model to identify the ideal 
dosing regimen for meloxicam the doses of 1.25 mg BID, 5 mg BID and 15 mg BID have 
been selected. This is on the basis that 1.25 mg BID can be anticipated to be , 
5 mg BID would likely be  and 15 mg BID 
would be approximately . The selection of these doses should enable an exploration of 
the dose-response curve for meloxicam.
Some studies of ANJESO [19]; [20] might indicate loss of efficacy prior to 24 hours whereby 
the confidence intervals for the IV meloxicam and placebo overlap at later timepoints. Data 
from MECC-TBZ-2001 indicates that BID regimes of MECC-SA were more effective than 
QD regimens MELO-TFZ-2001 will study BID doses of meloxicam. The predicted (using 
data from Study ) exposure of 15 mg BID meloxicam is anticipated to 
. However, it is expected that  
 
 (Table 8). 
The administration of meloxicam 15 mg BID should therefore be well tolerated.
As meloxicam will be administered under controlled conditions in a clinic-based study, the 
risks and benefits to individual subjects can be carefully assessed; rescue medication will be 

Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 34 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidentialavailable to subjects (whether taking active or placebo) if the pain associated with the 
surgical procedure is too great post-dose.
The use of placebo and low doses of meloxicam in the study is appropriate to ensure that any 
change from baseline in pain assessments related to the study drug can be adjusted for the 
‘placebo-response’ that is common in pain studies and for an exploration of the dose-response 
of meloxicam. All subjects will be allowed to use rescue medication if the pain associated 
with the surgical procedure is too great post-dose.
Complete information for meloxicam may be found in the Single Reference Safety 
Document, which for this study is the meloxicam Investigator’s Brochure.

3 STUDY DESIGN
3.1 Overall Design
This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, dose-ranging 
study, randomizing and dosing approximately 108 male or female subjects that have had third 
molar dental surgery. Subjects will receive a dose of study drug on Day 1 after surgery and a 
further dose approximately 12 hours later.
3.2 Rationale for Study Design
The study design is consistent with research design recommendations of the IMMPACT 
(Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials) group for trials 
involving subjects with short-duration acute pain [23].
The dental surgical pain model has been in widespread use for over 50 years, is well 
characterized, and is frequently used to investigate the pharmacodynamic properties of 
analgesic molecules (onset/offset, dose response, and potency). Efficacy in the dental model 
is highly predictive of efficacy in later stage models and has a high assay sensitivity [24]. The 
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 36 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidentialmodel is also ideal as the surgery, the anesthetic regimen, and perioperative care protocols 
can be standardized across patients. 
The dental surgical pain model has demonstrated the efficacy of analgesic medications across 
a range of different pharmacology, including NSAIDs and opioids [24] and specifically has 
demonstrated efficacy for an IV formulation of meloxicam [18] recently approved as 
ANJESO and an oral co-crystal formulation of meloxicam: salicylic acid (MECC-SA) – 
Study MECC-TBZ-2001, IND 
Study MECC-TBZ-2001 indicated that a BID regimen was potentially advantageous over a 
QD regime for meloxicam with a similar exposure profile as that for this formulation of 
meloxicam, hence a BID regimen will be explored in this study.
Based on the data from MECC-TBZ-2001, an appropriate censoring period to account for the 
use of rescue medication in the study is needed. Study MECC-TBZ-2001 explored the effect 
of the censoring period on the data and indicated that 2 hours (i.e., a W2LOCF approach) 
would not be sufficient and that a 4-6 hour window would be a better balance of a). 
accounting for the analgesic effect of the rescue medication and b). not censoring a large 
amount of data in placebo or low doses of study medication. For this reason, a W6LOCF 
approach will be adopted for the primary analysis, with pre-specified sensitivity analyses of 
W4LOCF and W8LOCF also explored.
This study will specifically identify if meloxicam has efficacy in a model of acute 
post-operative pain and will enable the identification of the most appropriate dose of 
meloxicam to continue in development.
3.3 End of Study Definition
End of study is defined as last subject, last visit.

Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidential4.2.3 Criteria for Study Drug Termination, Withdrawal from the Study and Study 
Termination
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to 
their future medical care by the Investigator or at the study center.
Every effort should be made to retain subjects in the study. When available, a reason for not 
completing the study will be recorded in the case report form (CRF).
If, a subject discontinues from the study prematurely, due to any reason as provided in the 
below withdrawal criteria, the site should request the subject’s consent for being followed-up 
during further study visits to perform safety and efficacy assessments as per Table 1. 
Subjects must be withdrawn from the study prior to randomization under the following 
circumstances:
The subject withdraws consent.
The subject has a positive pregnancy test at Visit 2 (Day 1) or at any preceding point 
prior to this following Screening (Visit 1).
Despite education/reinforcement, the subject shows persistent inadequate compliance 
with required study visits/procedures, potentially compromising safety monitoring 
while on study drug based on Investigator’s discretion.
The subject takes prohibited treatment presenting a safety concern to dosing with 
study drug.
If it is in the subject’s best interest based on decision of the Principal Investigator or 
Sub-Investigator e.g., due to occurrence of an AE and/or other findings considered to 
present a safety concern prior to dosing with study drug. Specifically, the following 
would mandate withdrawal:
oThe subject experiences a GI bleed or significant CV event prior to Visit 2 
(Day 1). 
oThe subject has significant abnormalities observed (after appropriate repeat 
assessments to confirm the findings) on 12 lead ECGs such as left bundle 
branch block, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, clinically significant 
arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia) or QTcF >500 msec.
A subject will be withdrawn prior to dosing if:
The pre-dose PI values is <5. This pre-dose PI value will be used as the baseline measure; a 
subject will only be dosed if this value is ≥5. 
Note: If a subject has a baseline score of <5 but is dosed in error, the subject should not be 
discontinued from the study for this reason.
A subject may be required to terminate study drug for reasons including the following:
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 41 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialThe subject withdraws consent.
For female subjects, diagnosis of pregnancy or stated intention to become pregnant. 
All efforts should be made by the site to obtain consent from the pregnant women, so 
that they are followed until delivery or termination.

with required study visits/procedures, potentially compromising safety monitoring 
while on study drug based on Investigator’s discretion.
The subject takes prohibited treatment presenting a safety concern to continued 
dosing with study drug.
The subject requires more than 6 tablets/day (equivalent to  
) rescue medication.
At the Investigator’s discretion (it is recommended that the Investigator discusses 
with medical monitor prior to decision), if it is in the subject’s best interest due to 
occurrence of an AE and/or other findings considered to present a safety concern to 
continued dosing with study drug and warrants treatment withdrawal. Specifically, the 
following would mandate withdrawal:
oThe subject experiences a GI bleed or significant CV event.
oThe subject has significant abnormalities observed (after appropriate repeat 
assessments to confirm the findings) on 12-lead ECGs such as left bundle 
branch block, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, clinically significant 
arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia) or QTcF >500 msec.
If the blind is broken for a subject by the Investigator.
The Principal Investigator and/or Mylan reserves the right to terminate the study for any 
reason.
The study will be terminated early if there are significant subject safety concerns that are 
indicative of a change to the risk: benefit profile for the overall study population. In this case 
the IRB will be informed accordingly.
Subjects who prematurely terminate the study will have discharge procedures performed prior 
to leaving the clinic or an Early Termination (ET) visit scheduled as soon as possible.

vasectomies of <6 months are NOT considered protected
Hormonal contraceptives (oral, injected, transdermal, or implanted) with the 
exception of low dose gestagens, i.e., only containing lynestrenol or norethisterone, 
since they do not inhibit ovulation and are therefore not considered as highly 
effective. The subject must remain on the hormonal contraceptive throughout the 
study and must have been on a stable regimen of hormonal contraceptives for an 
adequate period prior to the study to ensure effectiveness (e.g., 3 months)
4.6 Pregnancy Testing
A serum pregnancy test will be performed on all female subjects at Screening. Urine 
pregnancy testing will be performed on all females of childbearing potential at subsequent 
visits as described in the schedule of activities (results will be reviewed and must be negative 
prior to dosing). In the event of a positive test, the subject will be withdrawn from the study 
(or will not enter the study if during screening).
Any pregnancy occurring after randomization to study drug will be followed-up and reported

To maintain the blind, subjects will take in a double-dummy design, three tablets (one that is 
representative of a 1.25 mg tablet, one that is representative of a 5 mg tablet and one that is 
representative of a 15 mg tablet) of study drug or placebo will be administered on one day, 
Visit 2 (Day 1). Due to the double-dummy design, neither the subject, nor the Investigator 
will know what treatment a subject receives. Additionally, per the clinic procedures, subjects 
will be blindfolded during dosing.

Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 44 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialStudy drugs will be administered following randomization and approximately 12 hours 
following the first dose.
5.1.1 Administration of Study Drugs
Study drug (three tablets containing meloxicam or corresponding placebo) will be 
administered in a double-dummy design at the clinic at each dosing time.
Subjects should take the study drugs with approximately 240 mL of water at ambient 
temperature under the supervision of trained study personnel. 
This activity will be followed by mouth and hand check of the subjects to assess compliance 
to dosing.
Study drugs must be swallowed whole and must not be chewed, crushed or divided.
In the event of any significant dosing errors, the Medical Monitor, or Mylan study contact 
should be contacted immediately.
5.2 Drug Inventory
Mylan will supply: 
Meloxicam and corresponding placebo.
The Investigator site will supply:
Medication required for sedation and anesthesia during the surgery.
Rescue medication for pain relief following randomization, 
All materials associated with the surgical procedure.
5.3 Study Medication Complaints
In the event the subject has a complaint/concern during study participation regarding the 
study supplied study medication, they should contact the site.
In the event of a complaint/concern regarding any study medication provided by Mylan for 
this study, as a minimum the following information should be sent by the site via e-mail to 
.

Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 45 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialConfirmation if the complaint caused or resulted in a SAE? If “Yes”, confirmation 
that the SAE has been reported
Additional information and potentially the return of study medication may be requested by 
Mylan in order to investigate the complaint.
5.4 Storage, Disposition of Unused Study Drug and Drug Accountability
The Investigator, or an approved representative, e.g., pharmacist, will ensure that all 
investigational products are stored in a secured area under recommended storage conditions 
and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements while at the Investigator site.
Study drug should be stored in accordance with the drug label. Storage conditions stated in 
the Investigator’s Brochure may be superseded by the label storage.
Temperature of storage facilities should be monitored and recorded on a daily basis using 
validated devices that record maximum and minimum temperatures. Should the storage 
facility experience any excursion of temperature outside of the labelled storage condition this 
must be reported immediately to Mylan or designee. At sites where daily monitoring and 
recording is not possible at weekends, then on the next working day after the weekend the 
temperature record (e.g., max/min thermometers) should be checked immediately for any 
temperature excursions. Devices used for temperature monitoring should be regularly 
calibrated. Affected material must be placed into quarantine until the impact of the excursion 
has been assessed and confirmed by Mylan. 
The Investigator must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other 
disposition of the study drug. If Mylan supply drug accountability forms these must be used. 
Alternatively, Mylan may approve use of standard institution forms. In either case, the forms 
must identify the study drug, including batch or code numbers, and account for its disposition 
on a subject-by-subject basis, including specific dates and quantities. The forms must be 
signed by the individual who dispensed the drug, and copies must be provided to Mylan or 
designee.
At the end of the study, Mylan will provide instructions as to disposition of any unused 
investigational product. If Mylan authorizes destruction at the study site, the Investigator 
must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental 
regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by Mylan. Destruction 
must be adequately documented.
5.5 Randomization 
Assignment of Subject Identification (SID) number, randomization number (where 
applicable) and study medication, as well as site drug inventory control will be managed by 
an automated Interactive V oice/Web Response system (IVRS/IWRS). A manual containing 
complete instructions for internet or telephone access and use will be provided to each site 
prior to study start. At their first clinic visit, the IVRS/IWRS will assign a SID. Each SID will 
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 46 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidentialbe unique and serve as the primary subject identifier throughout all phases of the study. The 
SID must appear on all CRF pages, source documents, laboratory data, ECG, and diary data. 
Subjects qualifying to enter the study drug treatment phase, will be assigned an additional 
“randomization number” by the IVRS/IWRS at randomization. Subjects will be allocated to 
treatment within blocks for the given allocation ratio.
At Visit 2 (Day 1) eligible subjects will be randomized to receive meloxicam (1.25 mg BID, 
5 mg BID, or 15 mg BID) or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio through the IVRS/IWRS after the 
assessment of the subject’s eligible pain score at Visit 2. Thus randomization will take place 
between eligibility and baseline assessment.
5.6 Breaking the Blind
Emergency subject unblinding will be managed by an automated IVRS/IWRS. 
A manual containing complete instructions for internet or telephone access and use will be 
provided to each site prior to study start.
Subject unblinding should be discouraged unless knowing the treatment received by the 
subject would change the way an AE is treated.
The study may be unblinded prior to completion of all pharmacokinetic bioassays.
5.7 Rescue Medication for Relief of Pain
Any use of rescue medication while the subject is in the clinic will be recorded, including the 
dose and time of administration.
5.7.1 Pre-Dose
If a subject requires the use of rescue medication prior to administration of study drug, the 
subject will not be eligible for randomization.
5.7.2 Post-Dose
Rescue medication of  will be 
allowed to treat breakthrough pain. Subjects will be encouraged to refrain from rescue 
medication until  post-dose. A dose of rescue medication will be allowed as 
needed up to once every 2 hours. A maximum of  
 will be allowed; if a subject requires greater than this the 
subject should be withdrawn from the study.
Pain Intensity will be measured immediately before any rescue medication is administered.
5.8 Concomitant Medications
All concomitant medications taken during the study (from signing informed consent to 
post-study follow-up) must be recorded with indication, daily dose, and start and stop dates of 

Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 47 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidentialadministration in the CRF. All subjects will be questioned about concomitant medication at 
each clinic visit and at follow up.
Medications taken prior to dosing with study medication will be documented as a prior 
medication. Medications taken after dosing with study medication will be documented as 
concomitant medications.
Subjects will abstain from all prohibited medications as described in the exclusion criteria 
section of this protocol (Section 4.2.2). Use of prohibited medication during the study will be 
deemed a protocol deviation and such subjects will be assessed by Mylan or designee 
regarding potential need to early terminate study drug (e.g., for safety reasons – see 
Section 4.2.3).
In addition to specifically named medications in Section 4.2.2 the Clinical Protocol 
(Exclusion Criteria 18) excludes subjects taking Strong CYP2C9 inhibitors or inducers within 
28 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the study. To facilitate the identification 
of these drugs a non-exhaustive list is provided in Table 9.

5.9 Recommended Procedure in a Subject Experiencing Adverse Effects Secondary to 
Excessive Pharmacological Effects of Study Drug
Symptoms following acute NSAID overdose are usually limited to lethargy, drowsiness, 
nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which are generally reversible with supportive care. 
Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Severe poisoning may result in hypertension, acute renal 
failure, hepatic dysfunction, respiratory depression, coma, convulsions, cardiovascular 
collapse, and cardiac arrest. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic 
ingestion of NSAID and may occur following an overdose.
Subjects should be managed with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID 
overdose or symptoms suggestive of excessive pharmacological effect. Accelerated removal 
of meloxicam by 4 g oral doses of cholestyramine given three times a day has been 
demonstrated in a clinical trial [ 25].
5.10 Treatment Compliance
Subjects will be dosed in the clinic on Visit 2 (Day 1) of the study. A visual check of the 
subject’s mouth and hands will be made to ensure compliance of dosing.
6 STUDY CONDUCT
Subjects eligible for study recruitment will have the nature, purpose, and risks of the study 
explained to them by the Investigator. They will be provided with a written copy of the 
informed consent form (ICF) for the study and given sufficient time to consider the study’s 
implications before deciding to participate. Subjects agreeing to participate in the study will 
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 49 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidentialsign the ICF and be given a duplicate copy before undergoing any screening or pre-screening 
(if required) procedures. A unique SID will be issued at the time of consent by IVRS/IWRS 
system. 
Once a subject enrolls in this trial the site will make every effort to retain the subject for the 
planned duration of the trial. Clinical trial site staff are responsible for developing and 
implementing support and retention plans. Elements of this plan may include the following.
Thorough explanation of the complete clinical trial visit schedule and procedural 
requirements during the informed consent process and re-emphasis at each clinic visit.
A simple explanation of the key data and key time points that are critical for the trial's 
successful analysis, and the importance of all the treatment groups to the overall 
success of the trial.
Discussion at screening, and subsequent regular review of possible barriers to clinic 
visit attendance and full study participation and compliance.
Collection of contact information at screening (address, phone numbers, email), 
which is regularly reviewed at subsequent clinic visits.
Use of appropriate and timely study visit reminders.
Immediate and multifaceted follow-up on missed clinic visits.
In cases where the subject does not return for the rescheduled visit or cannot be reached to 
reschedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain contact with the 
subject so that they can appropriately be withdrawn from the study. All contact attempts 
should be documented in the subject's medical record. Should the subject continue to be 
unreachable, then and only then will he/she be considered to have withdrawn from the study 
with a primary reason of "Lost to Follow-up." For all other subjects withdrawing from the 
study, an alternative reason for discontinuation should be recorded in the CRF. Regardless of 
site plans to support and retain subjects within the trial, subjects may voluntarily withdraw 
from the trial for any reason and at any time.
For a subject who completes the study and all procedures it is anticipated that the duration of 
study would be approximately 1.5 months. 
For details and timings of assessments, refer to Section 7.
6.1 Screening Procedures
Each prospective subject must agree to participate in screening procedures by signing the 
most recent ICF before any screening procedure is initiated. The Principal Investigator or 
Medical Sub-Investigator will review the inclusion and exclusion criteria to confirm 
eligibility of each subject prior to enrollment.
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 50 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidential6.1.1 Screening (Visit 1)
Subjects will commence screening procedures within 30 days prior to the planned surgical 
procedure and subsequent randomization, to confirm that they meet the selection criteria for 
the study. If the time between screening procedures and potential randomization exceeds 
30 days as a result of unexpected delays, then the subject will need to be discussed with 
Mylan or designee to consider potential for re-screening (if re-screening is agreed, the subject 
will need to be re consented and assigned a new SID via IVRS/IWRS). Re-screening for 
other reasons may be possible following discussion with the Mylan or designee. If 
re-screening occurs this will be clearly documented within the site file.
At Screening (Visit 1), the following will be completed; procedures can be performed in a 
different order, but informed consent must be obtained prior to any procedures and the 
12-lead ECG must be performed prior to vital signs or obtaining blood samples.
Written informed consent. 
IVRS/IWRS screening registration. 
Complete medical history, demographics. 
Complete history of all prescription or non-prescription drugs and dietary 
supplements taken within 28 days prior to consent. History of alcohol or illicit drug 
use.
Record 12-lead ECG – supine or semi-recumbent.
Record vital signs – supine or semi-recumbent blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate 
(PR). 
Measure height and weight.
Serum pregnancy test for all female subjects. 
Blood will be collected for safety laboratory tests. Laboratory tests at screening 
include confirmation of non-childbearing potential in any female who has been 
amenorrheic for at least 2 years, via serum FSH. 
Urinalysis (for blood, protein etc.). Sample to be tested for microscopy/culture if 
positive for blood, protein, nitrites or leukocyte esterase.
Urine drug screen.
General physical examination, including respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, 
musculoskeletal, neurological systems, lymph nodes, skin, extremities, head, ears, 
eyes, nose, and thyroid gland.
Check study inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Review AEs (AEs are to be recorded starting from signature of consent).

6.2.3 Early Termination (ET) visit
Subjects may request termination of study drug or withdrawal from the study at any time, or 
be required to withdraw or terminate study drug by the Investigator or Sponsor for reasons as 
per Section 4.2.3. If study drug is terminated or the subject withdraws or is withdrawn, the 
reason for termination/withdrawal should be established and recorded. If a subject does not 
return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact the subject. In any 
circumstance, every effort should be made to document the outcome of subject contact 
attempt, if possible. The Investigator will contact Mylan or designee in the event that a 
subject fails to complete the study or violates the protocol.
If the subject withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be 
collected. The Sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 55 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialUnless consent is withdrawn, subjects who prematurely terminate study drug will be asked to 
conduct the procedures detailed below prior to leaving the clinic or return to the clinic for an 
ET visit and will have this scheduled as soon as possible after their last dose of study drug.
At the Early Termination (ET) visit (or discharge from the clinic) the following procedures 
will be completed:
General physical examination, including respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, 
musculoskeletal, neurological systems, lymph nodes, skin, extremities, head, ears, 
eyes, nose, and thyroid gland.

Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidential7 TREATMENT PROCEDURES AND ASSESSMENT CRITERIA
Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be 
circumstances, outside of the control of the Investigator that may make it unfeasible to 
perform the test. In these cases, the Investigator or designated representative will take all 
steps necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the subject. When a protocol required 
test cannot be performed the Investigator or designated representative will document the 
reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions which he/she has taken to ensure 
that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The Mylan study team will be 
informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.
Activities specific to this protocol are summarized in Table 1 and expanded upon further 
below.
7.1 Dental Surgery
The dental surgery and related anesthesia, sedation, and prophylactic antibiotics are not 
investigational and will occur regardless of research.
The dental surgery (extraction of ≥2 x third molars, at least 1 of which involves partial or 
complete mandibular bony impaction) will be performed on Visit 2 (Day 1).
The procedure will be performed using appropriate local anesthesia and sedation (performed 
using nitrous oxide and a local injection of lidocaine with epinephrine). Subjects will also 
receive prophylactic antibiotics after surgery.
7.2 Efficacy Assessment
7.2.1 Pain Intensity (NRS)
Pain Intensity (PI) (using a 0-10 point numeric rating scale (NRS) where 0 is no pain and 10 
is the worst pain imaginable) [26] will be assessed during the 5 hours following surgery. If 
the subject scores a NRS ≥5 (and moderate or severe pain on the categorical scale) within 
5 hours following surgery, they will be eligible for randomization (eligibility assessment). 
A further PI assessment will be made immediately prior to dosing. The pre-dose PI value will 
be used as the baseline measure; a subject will only be dosed if both the pre-
randomization/eligibility PI and the pre-dose PI is ≥5. Randomization will take place between 
eligibility and baseline assessment. 
Assessments will be made at 15, 30, and 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 
16, 20, and 24 hours after the first dose of study medication, and immediately before any 
rescue medication and/or at the time of early termination.
Assessments will also be made immediately following the time of first relief and time of first 
meaningful relief.
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 57 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialThe PI will be recorded in a diary.
7.2.2 Categorical Pain Rating
A pain rating using a 4-point categorical rating scale (none, mild, moderate, severe) will be 
used to assess eligibility for randomization. 
Assessments will be made following surgery until a categorical baseline pain is achieved.
If the subject records moderate or severe (and a NRS pre-randomization and pre-dose ≥5) 
within 5 hours following surgery, they will be eligible for randomization. 
The categorical pain rating will be recorded in a diary.
7.2.3 Patient Global Assessment (PGA)
A Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of pain control will be rated on a 5-point scale, ranging 
from 0 to 4, where 0-poor, 1-fair, 2 good, 3-very good, or 4-excellent. 
Assessments will be made at 24 hours after the first dose of study medication or at time of 
early termination if applicable.
The PGA will be recorded in a diary.
7.2.4 Time to First Perceptible Pain Relief
Time to first perceptible pain relief will be assessed using a double stopwatch approach. 
The time to onset of first perceptible pain relief (time that the first watch stopped) is defined 
as the post-dose time at which the subject first begins to feel pain relief. 
If a subject takes rescue medication prior to recording perceptible pain relief, the stopwatches 
will be collected, and no further assessment of perceptible pain relief will be collected.
7.2.5 Time to Meaningful Pain Relief
Time to meaningful pain relief will be assessed using a double stopwatch approach. 
The time to onset of meaningful pain relief (time that the second watch stopped) is defined as 
the post-dose time at which the subject first begins to feel meaningful pain relief.
If a subject takes rescue medication prior to recording meaningful pain relief, the stopwatches 
will be collected, and no further assessment of meaningful pain relief will be collected.
7.2.6 Rescue Medication Use
Rescue medication of  will be allowed at any 
time, but subjects will be encouraged to wait until at least  post-dose if possible. A 
PI score assessment will be made immediately prior to any rescue medication.
The time and dose of any rescue medication taken by a subject will be recorded in the CRF.

Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidential7.3 Safety Assessment
7.3.1 Adverse Event Assessment
If a subject has any symptoms before drug administration, they will be evaluated by medical 
staff and necessary measurements will be performed. The Principal Investigator or Medical 
Sub-Investigator will be notified before dosing to determine the course of action.
Findings from screening procedures, e.g., laboratory tests or physical examinations will be 
recorded as medical history. Clinically significant worsening from the screening procedures 
will be recorded as adverse events.
Subjects will be routinely queried in regard to the presence or absence of AEs using open 
ended questions. When assessing AEs, the subject will be specifically asked regarding the 
presence of any GI symptoms. The clinic will provide documentation of any adverse events 
in the subject’s CRF. The AE source documentation will minimally include the following 
information: date and time of assessment, the outcome of the response, and identification of 
the clinic staff member collecting the information.
7.3.2 Laboratory Safety
The following safety laboratory tests (Table 10) will be performed at Screening (Visit 1) and 
Visit 2 (Day 2).

conducted at the laboratory and if urine is positive for blood, protein, nitrites, or leukocyte 
esterase, will be analyzed via microscopy/culture by a laboratory. 
Additionally, a urine drug test will be performed at Screening (Visit 1) and on admission at 
Visit 2 (Day 1). If a subject has a positive test for amphetamines but is prescribed medication 
such as to treat ADHD, they would still be acceptable at the Investigator’s discretion.
Blood volumes to be collected and blood and urine sample handling instructions will be per 
the local laboratory’s standard procedures. The Investigator will provide collection materials 
for packaging and shipment of samples to the laboratory.
Any clinically significant findings in laboratory safety data should be recorded as an AE. 
Determination of clinical significance and seriousness will be based on the Investigator's 
medical judgment.
7.3.3 Vital Signs - Blood Pressure and Pulse Rate
Blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate (PR) will be measured at Screening (Visit 1), Visit 2 (Day 
1), and Visit 2 (Day 2) at times specified in Table 1 and Section 6. Additional collection 
times, or changes to collection times of blood pressure and pulse rate will be permitted, as 
necessary, to ensure appropriate collection of safety data.
Supine or semi-recumbent BP will be measured with the subject’s arm supported at the level 
of the heart and recorded to the nearest mmHg after 5 minutes of rest. Where possible, the 
same arm (preferably the dominant arm) will be used throughout the study.
The same size blood pressure cuff, which has been properly sized and calibrated, will be used 
to measure blood pressure each time. The use of automated devices for measuring BP and PR 
are acceptable, although, when done manually, PR will be measured in the brachial/radial 
artery for at least 30 seconds. Any clinically significant changes in BP and PR should be 
recorded as an AE. Determination of clinical significance and seriousness will be based on 
the Investigator's medical judgment.
7.3.4 12-Lead ECG
In this study, 12-lead ECGs will be recorded using clinic ECG devices. ECGs should be 
collected at measured at Screening (Visit 1), Visit 2 (Day 1), and Visit 2 (Day 2) at times 
specified in Table 1 and Section 6. All 12-lead ECGs will be single recordings.
All scheduled ECGs should be performed after the subject has rested quietly for at least 
5 minutes in a supine or semi-recumbent position. Pre-dose ECGs should be performed prior 
to commencing blood sampling or vital signs assessments. 
To ensure safety of the subjects, a medically qualified individual at the site will assess ECG 
recordings and make any comparisons to baseline measurements.
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 60 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialAt screening, the QTcF must be ≤470 msec for female or ≤450 msec for male subjects, and 
the ECG must show no clinically significant rate or rhythm abnormalities for the subject to be 
eligible (See Section 4.2.2). 
In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead 
placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality. It is important that leads are placed in the 
same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings. Any clinically 
significant ECG abnormalities measured at screening should be assessed for their effects on 
subject eligibility of the study and recorded in medical history. ECG parameters will not be 
recorded in the CRFs, but any clinically significant changes between the screening and 
subsequent ECGs should be recorded as an AE. Determination of clinical significance and 
seriousness will be based on the Investigator's medical judgment.
7.3.5 General Physical Examination
A full general physical examination will consist of an examination of the abdomen, 
cardiovascular system, lungs, lymph nodes, musculoskeletal and neurological systems, skin, 
extremities, head, ears, eyes, nose, and thyroid gland by trained medical personnel at the site. 
A full physical examination will be performed at Screening (Visit 1) and Visit 2 (Day 2).
Height and weight will be assessed at Screening (Visit 1). 
Physical examination results will not be recorded in the CRFs, but any clinical significant 
finding at Screening (Visit 1) should be recorded under medical history and changes between 
Screening (Visit 1) and subsequent examinations should be recorded as an AE. Determination 
of clinical significance and seriousness will be based on the Investigator's medical judgment.
7.3.6 Blood Volume
Total blood sampling volume for an individual subject is approximately 103.5 mL. Additional 
blood samples may be taken for safety assessments, provided the total volume taken during 
the study does not exceed 500 mL during any period of 30 consecutive days, and the ethics 
committee/IRB is notified of the blood collection.

Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidential7.4 Pharmacokinetics
7.4.1 Plasma for Analysis of Meloxicam
Blood samples will be collected at the following times, with the date and time of each sample 
being recorded in the CRF:
Pre-dose and 15, 30, and 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20, 
and 24 hours after the first dose of study medication.
All efforts will be made to obtain the pharmacokinetic samples at the exact nominal time 
relative to dosing. However, samples obtained within 10% of the nominal time (e.g., within 
6 minutes of a 60-minute sample) for samples prior to ≤8 hours from dosing and ±1 hour for 
samples ≥12 hours from dosing will not be captured as a protocol deviation, as long as the 
exact time of the sample collection is noted on the source document and CRF.
PK sample handling instructions will be provided to the Investigator prior to initiation of the 
study.
Samples will be analyzed using validated analytical methods in compliance with 
Mylan/Viatris standard operating procedures.
As part of understanding the pharmacokinetics of the study drug, samples may be used for 
metabolite identification and/or evaluation of the bioanalytical method. These data will be 
used for internal exploratory purposes and will not be included in the clinical report. 
The study may be unblinded prior to completion of all pharmacokinetic bioassays.
7.4.2 Shipment of Pharmacokinetic Samples
The shipment details and assay lab contact information will be provided to the Investigator 
site prior to initiation of the study.
7.5 Restrictions
Study restrictions include all items listed in the Lifestyle Guidelines (Section 4.4) and the 
concomitant medications as described in the exclusion criteria section of this protocol 
(Section  4.2.2) and will be prohibited throughout the duration of the study. If concomitant 
medications change during the study, a discussion between the Principal Investigator or a 
Medical Sub-Investigator along with Mylan should occur, and a decision to continue or 
discontinue the subject will be made based on the medication’s pharmacology and 
pharmacokinetics.
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study 
will be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be dated and maintained 
by the Sponsor. This document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any 
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 62 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidentialmajor modifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also be 
reflected in a protocol amendment.
8.1 Sample Size Determination
In order to derive the required sample size for the primary estimand,  
 for 10 mg BID, 15 mg BID, and placebo 
reported from a previous meloxicam study conducted by the Sponsor (  in 
dental pain). Simulations were performed  
 
 
 
. The numerical dose values were 2.5, 10, 30, and 0 for 
1.25 mg BID, 5 mg BID, 15 mg BID, and placebo, respectively.
The results of the simulations indicate the following values for power, for 25 subjects per 
group, assuming a standard deviation (SD) of : 
Table 12: Power Calculations for The Primary Estimand
Dose Expected Effect Size (versus Placebo) Power
Note that the expected standardized effect sizes (expected effect size divided by SD) are 
approximately  (15 mg BID, 5 mg BID and 1.25 mg BID, respectively) 
therefore the comparisons 15 mg BID vs. placebo, 5 mg BID vs. placebo and 1.25 mg BID 
vs. placebo have approximately  power to declare statistical significance 
for standardized effect sizes of  respectively.
8.2 Populations for Analyses
8.2.1 Safety Analysis Set
The safety analysis set (SS) will include all subjects who received at least one dose of study 
drug. Data will be summarized according to the treatment a subject actually received.
8.2.2 Intent To Treat Analysis Set
The ITT analysis set includes all randomized subjects who received study drug, including 
subjects who discontinued study treatment or received protocol allowed rescue medication.

Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 63 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialSubjects who were dosed in error but had a baseline PI score <5 will be included in this 
analysis set Data will be summarized and analyzed according to the treatment a subject was 
randomized to receive.
8.2.3 Modified Intent To Treat Analysis Set
The mITT analysis set includes all subjects in the ITT analysis set who, additionally, have 
provided at least one post-baseline pain intensity (PI) score. Subjects who were dosed in error 
but had a baseline PI score <5 will be included in this analysis set. Data will be summarized 
and analyzed according to the treatment a subject was randomized to receive.
8.2.4 Per Protocol Analysis Set
The per protocol (PP) analysis set will include all subjects in the mITT who had no major 
protocol violation that would impact on the primary efficacy endpoint. Significant protocol 
deviations are defined in Section 9.4 and will be further defined in the SAP. In particular, 
subjects who were dosed but had a baseline PI score of <5 will be excluded from this analysis 
set. The list of major protocol deviations will be finalized prior to database lock and 
unblinding as part of the final blinded data review (BDR). Data will be summarized and 
analyzed according to the treatment a subject actually received at randomization.
8.2.5 Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set
The pharmacokinetic analysis set (PK) will include all subjects who receive a dose of study 
medication and who provide at least one post-dose concentration sample for the Population 
PK analysis.
8.3 Intercurrent Events
8.3.1 Impact of Protocol Allowed Rescue Medication Use
For the primary analysis of the primary estimand a 6-hour windowed last observation carried 
forward (W6LOCF) approach will be used whereby the PI score obtained before a given 
rescue medication will be carried forward to replace the PI scores collected at each 
observation timepoint within 6 hours following the rescue dose.
8.3.2 Impact of Discontinuation
Refer to Section 8.4.5.
8.4 Statistical Analyses
8.4.1 Definition of the Primary Efficacy Estimand
The summed pain intensity difference (SPID) over 0-24 hours for meloxicam vs. placebo for 
the modified Intent To Treat (mITT) analysis set under the assumption that rescue medication 
use is managed by a 6h windowed last observation carried forward (W6LOCF) principle.
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 64 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidential8.4.2 Primary Analysis of Primary Estimand
To analyze W6LOCF SPID 0-24 hours, a 3-parameter E max model will be fitted to the 
observed mean for each dose and placebo. Effect sizes for each dose versus placebo and 
associated standard errors, p-values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated.  
Standardized effect sizes will also be estimated from the E max model (effect sizes for each 
dose versus placebo divided by the pooled SD together with their 95% confidence intervals. 
Baseline pain intensity score (PI) will be used as a covariate in the E max model. Baseline is 
defined as the mean of the pre-randomization and pre-dosing PI scores. The numerical dose 
values will be 2.5, 10, 30, and 0 for 1.25 mg BID, 5 mg BID, 15 mg BID, and placebo 
respectively.
If the E max model fails to converge, an analysis of covariance (ANCOV A) will be used to 
assess the difference between treatment groups. The ANCOV A model will include treatment 
as fixed effect and baseline PI score as a covariate. The difference between meloxicam and 
placebo will be estimated from the least squares means (LS means) along with the 95% 
confidence interval (CI) and associated 2-sided p-values. In addition, the standardized effect 
sizes for each dose will be calculated by dividing the differences in LS means for each dose 
and placebo by the pooled standard deviation.
8.4.3 Sensitivity Analyses of Primary Estimand
As a sensitivity analysis of the W6LOCF approach used in the primary analysis of the 
primary estimand, a W4LOCF and W8LOCF will also be used whereby the PI score obtained 
before a given rescue medication will be carried forward to replace the PI scores collected at 
each observation within 4 and 8 hours following the rescue dose.
8.4.4 Supplementary Analyses of the Primary Estimand
As a supplementary analysis of the primary estimand, which is based on the mITT analysis 
set, the primary analysis will be repeated using the PP analysis set. In addition, the sensitivity 
analyses described above will also be repeated in the PP analysis set. If a sufficient number of 
subjects are excluded from the mITT analysis set due to having no post-treatment PI score, 
then these analyses will also be repeated using the ITT analysis set. The decision whether or 
not to conduct the analyses in the ITT analysis set will be made during blinded review of the 
data from the study.
8.4.5 Missing Data
The amount of missing data is expected to be minimal given the short duration of the study.
Missing pain assessments for subjects who discontinued early due to lack of efficacy, 
an AE, or intolerance to study drug will be imputed using a baseline observation 
carried forward (BOCF) approach.
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 65 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialMissing pain assessments due to other reasons for discontinuing will be imputed using 
a last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach.
Subjects with no post-baseline PI score will be included in the ITT analysis set and, if 
this analysis is conducted, a BOCF approach will be used.
Intermittent missing pain assessments between two non-missing scores will be 
imputed using linear interpolation. 
The impact on the primary estimand and the methods for handling missing data may be 
assessed in secondary/sensitivity analyses and any pre-planned analyses will be fully 
described in the SAP. As this is a Phase 2 study, additional post-hoc analyses may be carried 
out in order to more fully understand the data.
8.4.6 Sub-Group Analyses
Subgroup analyses may be specified in the SAP. As this is a Phase 2 study, additional 
post-hoc analyses may be carried out in order to more fully understand the data.
8.4.7 Definition and Analysis of the Secondary Estimands
All hypotheses will be tested at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. Nominal p-values will 
be presented for all secondary endpoints without adjustment for multiple comparisons (since 
this is a Phase 2 study). All analyses will be based on the mITT analysis set.
8.4.7.1 Secondary SPID Endpoints
The SPID endpoints for the time intervals 0-2, 0-4, 0-8, 0-12 and 12-24 hours will be 
analyzed using the E max/ANCOV A model used for the analysis of the primary endpoint.
8.4.7.2 Pain Intensity Differences (PID) Over Time
PID scores over time will be analyzed using a longitudinal mixed model for repeated 
measures (MMRM) with fixed effects for treatment, time, treatment by time interaction and 
baseline PI score. Subject will be fitted as a random effect. Variance estimation will be based 
on an unstructured covariance matrix. Missing data will be assumed to be Missing At 
Random (MAR). Least squares means (LS means) will be plotted by time to show the pain-
relieving efficacy of both meloxicam and placebo over 24 hours.
8.4.7.3 Time to Event Endpoints
The following analysis methods apply to the time-to-event endpoints listed:
Time to perceptible pain relief (PPR).
Time to meaningful pain relief (MPR).
Elapsed time from the start of study medication to first rescue medication 
administration.
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 66 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialTime to event endpoints will be analyzed and plotted using Kaplan-Meier methodology and 
differences between meloxicam and placebo evaluated using the log-rank test. The median 
time to event will be calculated and presented.
8.4.7.4 Responder Endpoints
The following analysis methods apply to the responder endpoints listed:
Proportion of subjects with overall pain reductions from baseline of ≥30% and ≥50% 
within 4 hours following the first dose based on the PI scores. Both these analyses 
will be presented for all methods of handling rescue medication use (W6LOCF and 
W4LOCF and W8LOCF approaches).
Proportion of subjects using rescue medication during 0-24 hours.
Patient’s Global Assessment (PGA) of pain control for 0-24 hours after the initial dose 
scored on the 5-point scale will be dichotomized and the percentage of subjects 
reporting a PGA score of 2 (good) or better defined as a responder.
The number and percentage of responders in each treatment group will be summarized. A 
comparison between meloxicam and placebo will be evaluated with the odds ratio (OR) and 
corresponding 95% confidence interval from a logistic regression model with treatment group 
and baseline PI as a covariate.
8.4.7.5 Frequency of Rescue Medication Use 
The frequency of rescue medication use will be summarized and graphically presented for the 
0-24 hours period after the first dose of study treatment.
8.4.8 Pharmacokinetics
For all pharmacokinetic data analyses, the PK population will be used.
Samples for PK determination of drug concentrations of meloxicam, in plasma will be 
determined by a bioanalytical laboratory using validated bioanalytical methods. Details of the 
validated bioanalytical method used will be provided in a separate bioanalytical report.
The plasma concentration data for meloxicam will be listed, summarized on the basis of time 
intervals, and plotted using a scatter plot with time relative to the preceding meloxicam 
dosing time. Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, number of 
subjects, and coefficient of variation) will be calculated for plasma concentrations for each 
time interval and by treatment group.
Population PK (PPK) analysis of meloxicam concentrations may be performed using 
modeling. The PPK analysis will be conducted and reported separately. Details of the PPK 
model building will be described in a separate PPK analysis plan.
If the dose-response relationship cannot be established in this study (for example, no doses 
are effective, or all doses are equally effective) then exploratory exposure-response analysis 
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 67 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidentialmay be conducted using individual predictions of exposure from the PK analysis in this 
study.
The study may be unblinded prior to completion of all pharmacokinetic bioassays.
8.4.9 Safety Analyses
Analysis of all safety data will be performed on the Safety Population and will be presented 
by the treatment received. 
8.4.9.1 Adverse Events

termination of the study whichever is the later.
10 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SAFETY REPORTING
The adverse event collection period begins at signing of informed consent and continues until 
the telephone End of Study (EOS) Visit. Adverse events occurring during this period need to 
be reported to the Sponsor according to Section 10.5.1. The Investigator is also responsible 
for notifying the Sponsor if he/she becomes aware of any adverse event after the study period 
has ended and it is considered related to the study medication (i.e., an adverse drug reaction). 
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is judged by the 
Principal Investigator to be stable or permanent.
10.1 Definitions
Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily 
have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory or physical findings, symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 72 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialClinically significant changes from baseline in laboratory assessments, vital signs, and 
physical examination are to be recorded as adverse events. Clinically significant 
abnormalities include:
a result associated with accompanying signs/symptoms 
a result that requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
a result that leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy 
a result considered to be an adverse event by the Investigator or Sponsor
Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an adverse event. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does 
not require reporting as an adverse event. 
An abnormal safety assessment (e.g., laboratory, vital signs, ECG) associated with a 
clinical diagnosis that has been recorded as an AE does not require a separate AE 
entry
Events meeting the definition of an AE also include:
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug or drug-food 
interaction.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant medication. (Please refer to the Section 10.2 for further 
details.) 
A symptom or medical complication related to a protocol-mandated intervention, 
including screening procedures
Serious Adverse Event
Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious. A serious adverse event is any AE 
that is: 
fatal
life-threatening
NOTE: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 73 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialNote: In patient hospitalization is defined as 24 hours in a hospital or an overnight stay. An 
elective hospital admission to treat a condition present before exposure to the study drug or a 
hospital admission for a diagnostic evaluation of an AE, does not qualify the condition or 
event as an SAE. Further, an overnight stay in the hospital that is only due to transportation, 
organization or accommodation problems and without medical background does not need to 
be considered an SAE.
oEvents NOT to be reported as SAEs are hospitalizations for the following: 
Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not 
associated with any deterioration in condition 
Treatment, which was elective or pre-planned, for a pre-existing 
condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and did not 
worsen 
Admission to a hospital or other institution for general care due to 
social or economic reasons (e.g., no access to local ambulatory medical 
care) 
Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling 
any of the definitions of serious given above and not resulting in 
hospital admission 
Hospitalization also does not include the following: Rehabilitation 
facilities, Hospice facilities, Respite care (e.g., caregiver relief), Skilled 
nursing facilities, Nursing homes 
results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity
a congenital anomaly or birth defect
an important medical event (medically significant)
oNote: medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether 
it is appropriate to consider other situations serious, such as important medical 
events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or 
hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject and / or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.
oThe seriousness criterion of “medically significant” should only be selected 
when none of the other seriousness criteria apply to the event but the 
Investigator still considers the event as serious.
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 74 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialAll adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as 
non-serious adverse events. 
Adverse Drug Reaction
All noxious and unintended responses to an investigational product related to any dose of the 
investigational product should be considered adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The phrase 
“responses to an investigational product” means that a causal relationship between an 
investigational product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility. All AEs judged by either 
the reporting Investigator or the Sponsor as having a reasonable causal relationship to an 
investigational product will be designated as ADRs.
All AEs, with the causal relationship to the study drug reported as “possible”, “probable” or 
“definite” will be considered ADRs. If the relationship to the study drug is not given, then the 
AE must be treated as if the relationship were “possible.”
Expected/Unexpected Adverse Event
An expected AE is defined as one whose nature, severity or outcome is consistent with the 
applicable reference safety information described of the study drugs. 
An AE is to be considered unexpected if the nature, severity or outcome is not consistent with 
the applicable product reference safety information.
Preexisting Condition
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be 
considered as baseline medical history and not reported as an AE. A baseline or preexisting 
condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the frequency, intensity, or the 
character of the condition worsens during the study period.
General Physical Examination Findings
Any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse 
event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event. 
Post-study Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event
At the last scheduled contact with the subject the Investigator should instruct each subject to 
report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes 
might reasonably be related to participation in this study. The Investigator should notify the 
study Sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has 
discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study. 
The Sponsor should also be notified if the Investigator becomes aware of the development of 
cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has 
participated in this study. 
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 75 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidential10.2 Special Situations
The following situations may by associated with a serious outcome and should be evaluated 
for expedited reporting to the Sponsor.
Any diagnosis of Cancer or Neoplasm is to be reported as a serious adverse event.
Emergency Room Visits:  Events that result in emergency room visits that do not 
result in admission to the hospital are not routinely considered to be serious events; 
however, these events should be evaluated for one of the other serious outcomes (e.g., 
life-threatening, other serious [medically significant] events).
Overdose: Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless this is an 
intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent; this should be 
reported regardless of sequelae. Signs and symptoms associated with accidental 
overdose are to be recorded as adverse events or as serious AEs. If adverse events 
associated with overdose fulfil any of the serious criteria (as defined in section 
‘Serious Adverse Event’), a completed SAE report form is required to be submitted.
Reports of Drug-drug interaction and Drug Abuse and Medication Errors: drug 
interactions or abuse of the study medication must be recorded as AEs. Medication 
errors will be captured as protocol deviations while any associated signs or symptoms 
must be recorded as AEs on the CRF. In addition, any serious consequence of drug 
interactions, drug abuse, or medication error must be reported immediately if these 
fulfil any of the SAE criteria.
10.2.1 Adverse Events of Special Interest
Adverse events of special interest given that meloxicam is an NSAID will include the 
following:
Myocardial Infarction/Unstable Angina
Stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA)
Heart Failure
Cardiac Arrhythmia (Atrial & Ventricular)
Gastrointestinal hemorrhages NEC
Gastrointestinal ulceration and perforation
Any AESI should be reported per the SAE reporting process per Section 10.5.
10.3 Collection and Recording of Adverse Events
During the Adverse Event Reporting Period, the PI will record all adverse events. At each 
contact with the subject, the Investigator must seek information on adverse events by specific 
questioning and, as appropriate, by examination. Information on all adverse events should be 
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 76 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidentialrecorded immediately in the source document, and in the appropriate adverse event module of 
the CRF. Information to be collected includes AE name or term (in standard medical 
terminology) and final diagnosis, event description, time and date of onset, clinician’s 
assessment of severity, seriousness, relationship to study product (assessed only by those with 
the training and authority to make a diagnosis), action taken with the study drug, treatment 
for the event and time (if available) and date of resolution/stabilization of the event.
Any findings from protocol specified safety assessments that are associated with the 
indication being studied are not to be reported as AEs or SAEs, unless judged by the 
Investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject’s condition. 
All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal results of diagnostic procedures should be 
grouped under one diagnosis on the CRF where possible and appropriate.
The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution or stabilization.  
Adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to 
determine the outcome. Any adverse event that occurs after the study period and is related to 
the study treatment or study participation should be recorded; and if serious, the Investigator 
should also immediately report it to the Sponsor.
10.4 Classification of an Adverse Event
10.4.1 Severity
The Investigator will assign a severity rating to each AE. For purposes of consistency, the 
following scale is to be used:
Grade 1 - MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function.
Grade 2 - MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
Grade 3 - SEVERE Interferes significantly with subject's usual function.
It is important to distinguish between severe AEs and Serious AEs. Severity is a classification 
of intensity, whereas an SAE is an AE that meets any of the regulatory specified criteria (see 
definitions, Serious Adverse Event).
10.4.2 Causality
For all adverse events, sufficient information should be obtained by the Investigator to 
determine the causality of the adverse event. The Investigator is required to assess causality 
of each AE.
An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a 
reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE. The 
Investigator must assess the relationship of each AE (serious and non-serious) to the study 
treatment(s) and record this relationship in the CRF.
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 77 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialFactors that need to be considered when making a causality assessment include: Temporal 
relationship, Clinical and pathological characteristics of the event(s), Pharmacological 
plausibility, Exclusion of confounding factors (medical and medication history), Drug 
interactions, De-challenge/re-challenge, Dose relationship.
A suspected relationship (definite, probable, possible) between the events and the study 
medication means, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship. Receipt of additional or clarifying information may warrant reassessment of 
causality. The Investigator is responsible for assessing relationship of AEs to study treatment 
in accordance with the following definitions:
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 78 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialCategory Causality Description
DEFINITE Causal relationship is certain For example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and the adverse event (AE) 
onset/course is reasonable, there is a clinically 
compatible response to de-challenge, other causes 
have been eliminated; the event must be definitive 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a 
satisfactory re-challenge procedure if necessary.
PROBABLE High degree of certainty for 
causal relationshipFor example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and AE onset/course is reasonable, 
there is a clinically compatible response to 
de-challenge (re-challenge is not required), and 
other causes have been eliminated or are unlikely.
POSSIBLE Causal relationship is 
uncertainFor example: the temporal relationship between 
study treatment exposure and the AE onset/course 
is reasonable or unknown, de-challenge 
information is either unknown or equivocal; could 
also be explained by disease or other drugs.
UNLIKELY Causal relationship is 
improbableAnother explanation is more likely such as disease, 
environment, or other medication.
Does not represent a known reaction to study drug.
UNRELATED/NOT 
RELATEDNo possible relationship The temporal relationship between drug exposure 
and the AE onset/course is unreasonable or 
incompatible, or a causal relationship to study drug 
is impossible
For SAEs, if the relationship to the study treatment(s) is considered to be unlikely or not 
related, an alternative suspected etiology should be provided when possible (e.g., 
concomitant medications, intercurrent illness/events, study-related procedure).
10.4.3 Expectedness
The Sponsor or its designated representative will be responsible for determining whether an 
AE is expected or unexpected based on the reference safety information. The reference safety 
information mentioned in the IB will be used in this study for the expectedness assessment of 
SAEs.
10.4.4 Outcome
For all adverse events, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to 
determine the outcome of the adverse event and to assess whether it meets the criteria for 
classification as a serious adverse event requiring immediate notification to Sponsor or its 
designated representative.
The outcome at the time of last observation will be classified as:
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 79 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialRECOVERED/RESOLVED where the subject recuperated and is free of any 
pathological conditions resulting from the prior disease or injury.
RECOVERED WITH SEQUELAE where the subject recuperated but retained pathological 
conditions resulting from the prior disease or injury. 
NOT RECOVERED/NOT RESOLVED (i.e., ongoing) where the subject has not recuperated 
from the condition or injury and the event is still considered ongoing.
RECOVERING where the subject has begun to recuperate from the condition or injury, but 
the event is considered ongoing at a reduced intensity.
FATAL the condition or injury results in the subject’s death. The Investigator should identify 
the principal cause of death and assign Fatal outcome to that event. Other concurrent ongoing 
AE/SAEs present at the time of death would remain Not recovered/Not resolved.
UNKNOWN can be selected if none of the other situations apply or are known. Follow-up 
should be conducted to obtain one of the preceding outcomes.
10.4.5 Action Taken With the Study Treatment
Action Description
Treatment interrupted The treatment was temporarily discontinued
Treatment withdrawn The treatment was permanently discontinued
Unknown Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused
No action taken The AE did not result in any modification of dose or frequency of dosing
Not applicable The AE occurred prior to first dose or following last scheduled dose
10.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Pregnancy Exposures
Investigators and the Sponsor or its designated representative must conform to the serious 
adverse event reporting timelines, formats, and requirements of the various entities to which 
they are responsible. 
10.5.1 Investigator Reporting: Notifying the Study Sponsor
Immediate notification of SAEs by the Investigator to Mylan PSRM is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of subjects are met.
Mylan will comply with country specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting 
to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC) and Investigators.
Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 80 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialSerious adverse events must be reported to the study Sponsor within 24 hours of awareness. 
To report such events, a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report form must be completed and 
signed by the Investigator or designee and forwarded to:
If the initial notification using the completed ‘SAE report form’ is not possible, the 
notification may be made via email/fax or over telephone with the following minimum 
necessary information
Study identifier
Study Center
Subject number
A description of the eventCurrent status (outcome of event-if known 
and whether study medication is continuing)
The reason why the event is classified as 
serious
Investigator assessment of the causality 
between the event and study treatment
The Investigator should provide further information on the event as soon as possible, 
preferably within 48 hours of awareness. This should include a copy of the completed SAE 
Report form, and any other diagnostic information and medical records that will assist in the 
understanding of the event.  
Subject identifying information must not be visible on SAE forms or any supporting 
documentation provided by the Investigator. Any information that could be used to identify 
the subject (e.g., name, address, medical record number) must be de-identified before 
submission to Mylan or its designee. The subject’s study specific ID number should be 
recorded on every page of documentation forwarded to the Sponsor.
The PI should provide the final diagnosis as the SAE term whenever possible in the SAE 
report form and CRF. The signs and symptoms should be provided in the narrative only, not 
as SAE terms. The PI should only list all signs and symptoms as SAE terms if no diagnosis is 
available at the time of report.
10.5.2 Follow-up
New information and any important missing information from prior reports on a serious 
adverse event must be provided promptly to the study Sponsor. In addition, the Investigator 
may be requested by Mylan/designee to obtain specific additional follow-up information in 
an expedited fashion. The Investigator should respond to targeted follow-up requests as soon 
as possible and preferably within 48 hours from receipt of the request. 

Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 81 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 Confidential10.5.3 Investigator reporting: Notifying the Ethics Committee
Investigators are responsible for safety reporting to their local Ethics Committee (LEC) and 
complying with their local EC’s reporting requirements. Copies of each report and 
documentation of LEC notification and receipt will be kept in the investigator’s study file.
10.5.4 Investigator Reporting of Pregnancy: Notifying the Study Sponsor 
All subjects who participate in the study should be counseled on the need to practice adequate 
birth control and on the importance of avoiding pregnancy during study participation as 
detailed in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Pregnancy testing will be conducted 
throughout the study, as detailed in the schedule of assessments.
A subject who is found to be pregnant at the screening visit will be excluded from the study 
and will be a screening failure. 
Subjects who have been enrolled in the study should be instructed to contact the Investigator 
or study staff immediately if pregnancy occurs or is suspected. Early termination visit 
assessments are required as soon as possible after learning of the pregnancy. Pregnant 
females will be discontinued from study treatment by the Investigator. A male that has a 
partner that becomes pregnant during the study will not be discontinued from study treatment. 
Details of the pregnancy should be recorded on the Pregnancy Report form and reported to 
Mylan PSRM within 24 hours of awareness by email  (primary) or 
facsimile from the time of initial awareness, even if beyond the closure of 
the clinical database. 
The Investigator is also responsible for following the pregnancy every 3 months or until 
delivery or termination and informing the Sponsor about its outcome. Reports where the 
embryo or fetus may have been exposed to the study drug(s), should be followed-up in order 
to collect information on the:
outcome of the pregnancy,
outcome for both mother and fetus (malformation/anomalies diagnosed since initial 
report)
development of the child after birth (developmental assessment, infant illnesses, 
hospitalizations, drug therapies, breastfeeding)
Healthy newborns should be followed-up at 1 month after birth to confirm no congenital 
anomalies were subsequently detected (if possible).
While pregnancy itself is not considered an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or an SAE. A 
spontaneous abortion is always considered to be a SAE and will be reported to the Sponsor.

Protocol MELO-TFZ-2001 Page 82 of 84
Protocol Version 1.0  15 February 2022 ConfidentialElective termination (i.e., without medical reasons) of an uncomplicated pregnancy is 
considered an elective procedure and not an AE; nevertheless, Mylan requests the outcome 
(e.g., elective termination) be reported within 24 hours of awareness and sent as a follow-up 
on the Delivery and Infant Follow-up Form). 
Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy brought to the Investigator’s attention 
after the subject has completed the study and considered by the Investigator as at least 
possibly related to the study treatment, must be promptly reported to Mylan PSRM.
If the study center becomes aware of a pregnancy in a female partner of a male subject, study 
personnel should contact their clinical research associate to obtain a partner pregnancy ICF. 
Consent of the pregnant partner must be obtained before any details of the pregnancy can be 
shared with Mylan or its designated representative. If the pregnant partner provides consent 
to have the pregnancy followed, the study center should collect the information specified on 
the Pregnancy Report form and forward the completed form to Mylan PSRM every 3 months 
until the pregnancy outcome has been obtained.

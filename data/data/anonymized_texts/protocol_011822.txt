 1. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE :  
Due to complexity in managing type 1 diabetes (T1D) and hypoglycemia associated with 
intensive insulin therapy, only 30% of patients with T1D are able to achieve desirable glycemic 
goal; HbA1c <7% as recommended by the American Diabetes Association  1,2. Moreover, the 
prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing among patients with T1D  3,4. Insulin 
resistance associated with obesity is also believed to be a contributing factor to inadequate 
glycemic control in T1D  5.  
Hybrid c losed -loop system s (HCL), also known as artificial pancreas, where  an insulin pump 
delivers insulin dose based on continuous glucose monitor (CGM)  glucose values by means of 
controlle r (mathematical ) algorithm  6. Studies with HCL ha ve been shown to improve glycemic 
control and reduce hypoglycemia in children, adolescents , and adults with T1D  7,8,9,10. The HCL 
systems are the most advanced diabetes management tools in the armamentarium of diabetes 
management. The use of the HCL system is increasing among patients with T1D and it is 
becoming a standard of care in the management of T1D. With increasing use of diabetes technologies such as CGM and the HCL and limitation of HbA1c in managing of diabetes, 
diabetes care is now moving from HbA1c centric to CGM -based metrics such as time- in-range 
(TIR ; sensor glucose between 70- 180 mg/dL ), time -below range (TBR ; sensor glucose <70 
mg/dL ) and time -above range (TAR ; sensor glucose  >180 mg/dL )
11-13. Studies have also 
validated TIR as an outcome measure for diabetes clinical trials 14 and there is a strong inverse  
relationship between TIR  and diabetes complications  15-21. International consensus recommends 
TIR>70% with TBR of < 4% as optimal glycemic control for most adults with T1D and type 2 
diabetes  11.  
There are three HCL systems currently available in the US; Medtronic 670 G/ 770G , Tandem  
Control IQ  and Omnipod 5 21-23.  On April 21, 2023, Medtronic 780 G was approved by the US 
FDA for management of T1D . Despite use of these most sophisticated diabetes t echnologies, not 
every HCL user  with T1D  is able achieve the recommended Hb A1c or TIR goal 25-27. This is 
mainly due to inability of the currently available HCL systems to control post -prandial glucose 
excursions  28. Studies have shown improvement in glycemic control (HbA1c and time -in-range) 
due to mainly dramatic improvement in overnight glycemic control  8-10. The daytime control 
V 8.0_8-30-2024   Page 7 of 41 
 between adults with T1D using HCL system and controls using insulin pump and CGM is only 
modestly  different  8-10.  
Semaglutide is once a weekly g lucagon- like peptide -1 receptor agonist (GLP -1RA ). It has been 
approved for the management of type 2 diabetes and has been shown to improve glycemic 
control and is  associated with significant weight loss without increasing hypoglycemia  29-31. 
GLP -1RA  have potential to improve glycemic control in existing HCL uses with inadequately 
controlled T1D by improving daytime  (mainly post -prandial) glycemic control and also may 
reduce insulin requirement due to weight loss. Small pilot studies have documented 
improvement in mean glucose and time -in-range with short -term use of l iraglutide in patients 
with T1D  using HCL  32,33. Moreover, l iraglutide had no effect o n plasma glucagon during mixed 
meal tolerance test 34 suggesting GLP -1RA may not blunt glucagon response during 
hypoglycemia. In addition, Semaglutide has been shown to improve cardiovascular and renal 
outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes  35-38. Since cardiovascular disease is the leading cause 
of death in people with T1D  39-40, there is an interest in exploring effect of GLP -1RA in patients 
with T1D.   Further, as obesity is growing in prevalence among people with T1D, nonalcoholic 
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is of concern in this population.  Semglutide may improve 
biomarkers of NAFLD, including hepatic steatosis index (HSI) and fibrosis score (FIB -4), based 
on easily obtained blood markers.  Further, assessment of NAFLD by magnetic resonance imaging corresponds well to livery biopsy data on steatosis and fibrosis.  Magnetic resonance 
elastrography (MRE) can be used to assess liver stiffness, a measure of fibrosis, and proton 
density fat fraction (PDFF), a measure of steatosis.  
Previous studies with the use of GLP -1RA in patients with T1D using HCL systems were limited 
by small sample size , and shorter duration (only for few days)
 32,33, and therefore, unable to 
provide evidence for long- term efficacy and safety of GLP -1RA in patients with T1D using HCL 
systems. Semaglutide is a long -acting GLP -1RA with a once a weekly administration that makes 
it convenient for patients and shown to have high adherence rate in patients with type 2 diabetes  
41. Weight loss is more pronounced with s emaglutide compared to l iraglutide  42. Therefore, we 
plan to evaluate efficacy and safety of s emaglutide as an add -on therapy in adults with T1D who 
are inadequately controlled despite the use of HCL therapy.

 2. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE  
Primary objective of the study is to evaluate improvement in a composite outcome ( CGM -
measured  TIR>70% with  TBR  of < 4% and reduction in body weight by 5% at  26 weeks with the 
use of once weekly semaglutide in inadequately controlled obese adults with T1D using FDA -
approved HCL therapy.  
 
3. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

3.3 Study design  
• This will be a multicenter  (four centers), double blind, parallel -group, randomized , placebo 
controlled clinical trial in obese T1D adults with suboptimal glycemic control despite 3 
months use of FDA approved HCL technology.  Study design is summarized in the Figure 
below.   
 
Figure: An illustration of study design 

V 8.0_8-30-2024   Page 11 of 41 
 • All participants will be randomized using computer generated block randomization 
and stratified by clinic research center . 
• There are up to 6  clinic visits and 3 phone call visits.  
• CVD assessments will take place at Randomization and at the week 26 visit. Brach ial 
distensibility  will be measured  using the Dynapulse Pathway device at all centers, and 
pulse wave velocity (PWV) , augmentation index by radial artery tonometry, cIMT 
and CMR assessments, along with ectopic fat measures of abdominal and pericardial 
fat, will take place at the BDC and OHSU sites. CVD assessments will be completed 
at an early  discontinuation visit if a study participant drops out. 
• NAFLD assessments will be done in conjunction with CVD assessments, as part of 
the blood tests for all participants and as part of the MRI completed for participants at the BDC and OHSU.  
3.4 Justification for study design  
• HCL therapy is the standard of care managing T1D. Despite HCL use , not all patients 
with T1D are able to achieve recommended glycemic goals  
25-27. Moreover, prevalence of 
obesity is increasing in this population 3-4, which is associated with insulin resistance and 
poor glycemic control  5. Therefore, adjunctive therapies such as GLP -1RA  are needed in 
this population to improve glycemic control as well as improve weight management.  
• We propose a randomized , placebo control led clinical trial, as a well -designed  RCT , will 
provide a high level of evidence for efficacy and safety of semaglutide in obese adults 
with T1D.  
• We will have a 4 week  titration period as recommended by the manufacturer. All subjects 
will be encouraged to titrate up to 1 mg a week. In case of intolerability, the dose will be 
titrated back to pre -tolerable dose and subjects will be encouraged to use max tolerable 
dose of  at least 0.5 mg weekly.  
• This will be a first clinical trial to provide efficacy and safety of semaglutide in 
suboptimal glycemic control despite on optimal therapeutic regiment in adults with T1D.  
• We will try to screen  subjects using different HCL systems (Medtronic 670/770 G /780G , 
Tandem control IQ  and Omnipod 5).   
V 8.0_8-30-2024   Page 12 of 41 
 • With increasing obesity and higher insulin resistance, cardiovascular risk is higher in 
people with T1D  43. Semaglutide has been shown to reduce  Major Adverse 
Cardiovascular Events  (MACE ) in patients with type 2 diabetes with high cardiovascular 
risk 35,44. Therefore, it would be of interest to explore change in cardio- renal and NAFLD 
parameters over 26 week s of treatment with Semaglutide in patients with T1D. Since 
enrolled patients are anticipated to have good glycemic control (due to HCL use) and 
because of the short duration of this clinical trial, we do not anticipate statistically 
significant differences in cardio -renal or NAFLD endpoints. However, these exploratory 
data would be useful for designing future clinical trials to reduce cardiovascular risk in people with T1D.

FDA approved and they will be excluded  for safety reasons.  
 
5.4 Withdrawal criteria  
• Participation in this research is voluntary. Subjects may withdraw at will at any time. 
When withdrawing from the study, the participant should let the research team know that he/she wishes to withdraw. A participant may provide the research team with the 
reason(s) for leaving the study but is not required to provide their reason.  
• If subject is withdrawn after week -10, we will encourage participants to complete V6 
(week -26) or complete V6A/P3A.  
• Participants will be withdrawn from the study if they become pregnant, actively try to 
become pregnant, develop an allergic reaction to semaglutide or at the judgement of investigators due to safety concerns. 
• After withdrawal, the participant will be given instructions on how to safely stop using 
study medications and, eventually, on how to correctly and safely return to the previous 
treatment  regimen. Instructions are also given on who to contact if there are any 
questions or concerns that arise after study withdrawal.  
• At the time of withdrawal, the research participant should let the research team know if 
he/she will allow the use of his/her health  information and collected data by the 
researchers.  
5.5 Subject replacement  
Withdraw n subject s will not be replaced. However, re- screening is allowed within 
recruitment  period at the investigator’s discretion.   
5.6. Reminders  
To minimize loss to follow -up, reminders (text message, phone call or email) will be sent 
to participants prior to each clinic visits.  
V 8.0_8-30-2024   Page 15 of 41 
 6. VISIT PROCEDURES:  
 The details of the study visits and procedures are provided in the  Table below . In brief, there 
are up to six in- person research visits and up to three phone call visits.  
 Before screening takes place, subjects will be provided with written information about the 
trial and the procedures involved. Subjects will be fully informed, both orally and in writing, 
about their responsibilities and rights while participating in the tr ial, as well as about possible 
advantages and disadvantages when participating in this trial. Subjects will have the opportunity to ask questions and have ample time to consider participation. The informed 
consent process will take place before the screeni ng visit. Before signing the informed 
consent, the investigator will make sure that the potential subject has full knowledge of the study processes, and the possibility to withdrawal at any time during the study.  
 Subjects who wish to enroll  in the trial must sign and date the informed consent form for the 
trial before participating in any trial -related procedures. All subjects will be provided with a 
copy of signed informed consent form.

 6.1 Screening   
 The subjects will be assigned a unique subject number, which will remain the same 
throughout the trial. The subject number will consist of 3 digits: first digit is site 
number (e.g. 1) followed by two digit subject number (e.g. 01).  
 All subjects will undergo review of inclusion and exclusion criteria. If any inclusion criteria is answered ‘no’ or any exclusion criteria is answered ‘yes’, the subject is a 
screen failure, and no further assessment will take place.  
 Patients will be told the importance of compliance of the  pre-set study visit time 
schedules  
 All subjects will be assessed and reeducated on diabetes self -management, appropriate 
and safe use of their own diabetes devices, and its trouble shooting, prevention and 
treatment of hypoglycemia and sick day management.  
 All subjects  must use appropriate insulin that is approved for their  HCL system. For 
exam ple, insulin Fiasp is not allowed to be used in Tandem Control -IQ HCL system.  
6.2. Randomization  
 Randomization visit will be done within 2 weeks from screening visit.  
 Subjects will be randomized using computer generated randomization scheme to receive 
either semaglutide or placebo (1:1 randomization). Patients or investigators will be 
blinded to either treatment modalities.  
 A pre -designated study personnel  will be in -charge of allocating study drugs  and 
keeping track of study drug distribution across all the sites.   
 A Directions For Use (DFU)  will be provided by Novo Nordisk and will be given to 
each patient at the first dispensing visit
 (dosing details in Section 6.3)  
6.3. Semaglutide dose, titration,  and insulin adjustment  
 Starting dose of semaglutide is 0.25 mg subcutaneously once a week.  
 All patients will be provided with verbal and written education on the use of semaglutide pen  
 Dose will be titrated after 4 weeks to 0.5 mg/ week and after 8 weeks to 1 mg/week. In case of intolerance to the medication, the dose can be scaled back. All patients will be 
encouraged to use maximally tolerable dose up to 1 mg/week.  
   
 
V 8.0_8-30-2024   Page 19 of 41 
  At randomization, and during drug titration (week 4 and week 8), study i nvestigator or 
designated study personnel must  review  HCL settings, adjust it per the guidance 
provided in the Appendix A , and provide appropriate education to minimize 
hypoglycemia. HCL adjustment will be recorded in the study database  (Redcap) .  
 To achieve desirable glycemic control (>70% TIR and <4% TBR), HCL settings may 
be adjusted by the investigators per the guidance provided in the Appendix C after 
patient has reached the maximum tolerable dose (after week 10 or P2 study visit). HCL 
adjustment will be recorded in the study database (Redcap) .  
6.4. Clinic and phone visits  
 All study procedure s must be conducted as mentioned in the procedure table above.  
 In a situation  where an in-person visit cannot be possible, research visit s (V3 and V4) 
can be conducted remotely.  A s tudy procedure manual will be provided to all sites.  
 If a subject is withdrawn after week -10, participants will be encouraged to complete V6 
(week -26) or complete V6A/P3A  
 
6.5 Un -blinding  
  The s ubject randomization list and IMP dispensation det ails will be stored at the BDC. 
Subject number will be matched with IMP assigned to the subject.  
 The designated independent personnel unbl inded to the study drugs (Sarit Polsky, MD ) 
will perform any un- blinding of study participants. 
 Un-blinding can be performed under the following circumstances:  
• Treatment of an individual in a medical emergency where knowledge of the treatment allocation is required.  
• Treatment of an individual for an AE.  
• In the event of a SUSAR. 
• In the event that the participant's study medication is accidentally taken by a 
member of their household e.g. a child.  
• If required by the DSMB committee or regulatory agencies.

 7.   STATISTICAL PLAN  
7.1 Preliminary data for sample size calculation  
In SUSTAIN 1,  4 and 5 clinical trials , Semaglutide  0.5 mg and 1 mg per week for 30 weeks in 
patients with type 2 diabetes resulted in 2.5- 4.5 kg, and 3.5- 6 kg weight loss compared to 
baseline  44-46. 30-40% of patients  with type 2 diabetes with baseline BMI between 30- 35 kg/m2 
achieved weight loss of >5%  using Semaglutide 0.5 mg weekly compared to comparator and 
45-60% had weight loss >5% using Semaglutide 1 mg weekly compared to comparator  47. 
Based on this data, we conservatively estimated that 30% of patients with T1D  using HCL and 
randomized to semaglutide  with BMI >30 kg/m2 will achieve >5% of weight loss at  26 weeks 
from baseline. None of the clinical trials in T1D demonstrated weight loss with the use of HCL 
therapy  8-10 and therefore, we don’t expect adults with T1D using HCL and randomized to 
placebo to los e >5% of body weight.  
Our previous real -life study of adults with T1D  using Medtronic 670 G had mean percent TIR  
of 67%±1.2%  after 3 months of using HCL . In our clinical experience of using semaglutide  in 
adults with T1D  with mean Hb A1c of 7.7±1.4 at baseline had drop in Hb A1c to 7.2±1.1 after 3 
months  (unpublished data) . Each 5% improvement in TIR approximates reduction in HbA1c by 
0.3-0.4%  48, 49 and therefore, based on our preliminary data, we expect that greater percentage of 
adults with T1D randomized to semaglutide would have improvement in TIR by at least 5% than adults with T1D randomized to placebo. Moreover, most adults with T1D using HCL 
system have TBR <4% and GLP -1 analogs have not found to increase TBR. Therefore, we 
expect that >75% of adults with T1D on HCL and randomized to either semaglutide  or placebo 
would have  TBR < 4%.  
7.2 Sample size calculation  
Using the Fisher’s exact test at an alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 32 per group (intention to treat 
analysis) completing the study is expected to have power close to 80% to detect a 30% difference in the proportion of participants achieving the composite outcome if the proportion in the control group is 5%. If the proportion in the control group is 3 %, then our power level is over 80% to detect a difference between 
groups of at least 29% , as shown in the table below .

Power and Sample Size for secondary endpoints:  
 Power calculations for key secondary outcomes were conducted using PASS v24.02.  Differences in 
each variable from baseline will be calculated and compared by treatment group. We determined the 
detectable mean group difference for each secondary outcome, assuming the null hypothesis of no 
difference between the means.  With a sample size of 32 per group, we have 80% power to detect mean 
differences as shown in the table below, assuming the SD shown in the table.

7.3 Evaluability of subjects 
 We will prepare two data set s for the analysis.  
 Per-Protocol (PP) analysis set: All exposed subjects who complete the 26- week trial 
without significantly violating the main aspects of the protocol. The P er-Protocol set will 
be used for sensitivity analyses.  
 Intention to treat (ITT) analysis set: All randomized subjects exposed to at least one dose 
of trial product. ITT data set will be used for efficacy and safety analysis.  
   
 
V 8.0_8-30-2024   Page 22 of 41 
 7.4 Analyses plan 
Analysis plan is detailed in a separate statistical analysis plan. All statistical analysis plan s were 
finalized prior to the completion of the study and analysis of any data.  
8. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
8.1 Data management

to COMIRB for the approval before the start of any study related activity.  
   
 
V 8.0_8-30-2024   Page 23 of 41 
  Once the protocol is approved by COMIRB for the BDC and the IRBs for the other sites, 
the study team will be allowed to contact potential subjects.  
 Before any trial -related activity, the investigator /study team will give the subject verbal and 
written information about the trial and the procedures involved in a form that the subject 
can read and understand. 
 The subjects will be fully informed of their rights and responsibilities while participating in the trial as well as possible disadvantages of being treated with the trial products.  
 The investigator will ensure the subject is given ample time to come to a decision whether to participate in the trial.  
 A voluntary signed and personally dated informed consent will be obtained from the subject before any trial -related activity.  
 The process of informed consent process will occur in a clinical research place. The subject will sign the informed consent process in the presence of the investigator and witness. The 
confidentiality and HIPAA will be handled per the University of Colorado and local site 
regulatory research policies.  
 
10. STUDY DRUGS AND MATERIALS:

Study medications 
 Injection semaglutide 1.34 mg/mL  
 Injection placebo (Clinic variant of marked product*)  
Packaging and labelling of study medication(s) 
 The BDC will receive study medications from Novo  Nordisk A/S . 
 BDC pharmacist /designated person will distribute the drugs/placebo to other sites.   
 All sites will be provided guidance (study procedure manual) on medication packaging, 
labelling, storage and distribution.  
 All subjects will be provided written and verbal education on taking study medications appropriately.

V 8.0_8-30-2024   Page 24 of 41 
  The temperature log will be monitored at the site and any temperature fluctuation will be 
reported as deviation. 
Auxiliary supply 
 Pen needles will be provided to all subjects.    
 
11. CONCOMITANT ILLNESS(ES) AND MEDICATION(S)  
 Concomitant illness is any illness that is present at the start of the trial (i.e. at the first visit).  
 Concomitant medication is any medication other than the trial product(s) that are consumed during 
the trial.  
 Details of all concomitant illnesses and medication will be recorded per protocol . All sites will be 
provided with source documents and instructions on recording concomitant illnesses and medications.   
* The clinic variant of the cartridge is produced with an army green closure cap compared to a dust green closure cap 
in the marketed Ozempic® product. Ozempic® are marketed in different pen variants for different intended dosing 
regimens. The push button and cartridge holder are light grey, and the pen can be found in both a 1.5 ml and 3 ml variant, dependent on the country. The clinical pen can be found in one variant to support 0.25mg, 0.5mg and 1mg doses in a 1.5 ml variant. The push button and cartridge holder are light brown. Neither closure cap nor the pen is in 
contact with the product and the differences in colours have no impact on the stability of the product.  
 
12. ADVERSE EVENTS  
12.1 Definition  
Adverse event (AE)  Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug 
whether considered drug related or not. AE can be unfavorable symptoms, 
sign (abnormality on physical exam or laboratory findings) or disease temporarily associated with the use of products whether or not related to 
the products.  
Serious adverse event 
(SAE)  
 An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, 
in the view of the investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Results in death, or, 
 Is life -threatening, or, 
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or, 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or,  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, 
 Is a medically important event that may not result in death, be life threatening or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when - based on appropriate medical judgement -they may 
jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
   
 
V 8.0_8-30-2024   Page 25 of 41 
 intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition 
of SAE  
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent should be considered as an 
SAE.  
Adverse Drug Reaction 
(ADR)  An Adverse Reaction is an Adverse Event for which the causal 
relationship between the Product and the Adverse Event is suspected  
Serious Adverse 
Reaction ( SAR)  An Adverse event that fulfil ls both the criteria for a Serious Adverse event 
and the criteria for an Adverse Reaction.  
Medical event of special 
interest (MESI)  
 A MESI is an event, which, in the evaluation of safety, has a special 
focus. A MESI is an AE (SAE or non- serious AE) which fulfils one or 
more of the below defined MESI criteria.  
–Medication errors concerning trial products:  
– Administration of wrong drug 
– Wrong route of administration, such as intramuscular instead of subcutaneous  
– Accidental administration of a lower or higher dose than intended, however the      administered dose must deviate from the intended dose to an extent where clinical consequences for the trial subject were likely to happen as judged by the investigator, although not necessarily did happen.  
Overdose and missed insulin injection resulting in severe hypoglycemia or 
hyperglycemia are considered as AE or SAE depending on severity.  
Suspected Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR)  
 An unexpected adverse reaction (UAR) is an adverse reaction that is not 
consistent with the product information in the summary of product characteristics (SPC, i.e.US prescribing information). The current version or any updated if available during the clinical trial for US prescribing information for study drugs will be used as SPC. If UAR is severe enough 
to define as SAE is called as SUSAR.  
Technical complaint  
 A technical complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication 
that alleges product (medicine or device) defects.  The technical complaint 
may be associated with an AE but  does not concern the AE itself.  
12.2 Reportable AE  for Hypoglycemia and Hyperglycemia/Diabetic Ketoacidosis  
• Hypoglycemia : Hypoglycemia is common in people with T1D. Only severe 
hypoglycemia defined as “hypoglycemia event requiring medical assistance of another 
person due to altered consciousness, and required another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions” is reportable adverse event .  
This 
means that the participant was impaired cognitively to the point that he/she was unable to 
treat himself/herself, was unable to verbalize his/ her needs, was incoherent, disoriented, 
and/or combative, or experienced seizure or coma. These episodes may be associated 
with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or c oma. If plasma glucose 
   
 
V 8.0_8-30-2024   Page 26 of 41 
 measurements are not available during such an event, neurological recovery attributable 
to the restoration of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the 
event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.  
• Hyperglycemic events/Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) : Hyperglycemic event is only 
reportable as an adverse event when one of the following four criteria is met:  
1) The event involved DKA, as defined by the Diabetes Control and Complication 
Trial (DCCT) and described here:   
 Hyperglycemic events are classified as DKA if the following are present (meeting all 4 criteria)  
a) Symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, nausea or vomiting  
b)  Serum ketones >1.5 mmol/L or large/moderate urine ketones  
c) Either arterial PH <7.30 or venous PH <7.24 or serum bicarbonate <15 
d) Treatment provided in a health care facility  
2) Evaluation or treatment was obtained at a health care provider facility for an acute event involving hyperglycemia or ketosis  
3) Blood ketone level ≥ 1.5 mmol/L and communication occurred with a health care provider at the time of the event  
4) Blood ketone level ≥ 2.5 mmol/L even if there was no communication with a health care provider  
12.3 Non -reportable adverse e vents  
 Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia events not meeting above criteria are  not required to be 
reported as an adverse event  
 Patients ’ own devices (e.g. insulin pump, CGM, BG meters) related issues and skin issues 
arise from the use of these devices (such as skin rash due to adhesive or infusion site issues) are  not reportable unless the event meets the definition of an SAE.   
 
 
   
 
V 8.0_8-30-2024   Page 27 of 41 
 12.4 Reporting of adverse events   
 All events meeting the definition of an AE must be collected and reported. This includes 
events from the first trial -related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent 
until the end of the post -treatment follow -up period. 
 Once an AE is identified, assessment for severity (mild, moderate or severe), causality 
(probable, possible or unlikely) and outcome of an AE (recovered, recovering, recovered with sequelae, not recovered, fatal or unknown) must be provided.  Probable is defined as 
good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship. Possible is 
defined as a causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed. Unlikely is defined 
as the event is most likely related to etiology other than the trial product.  
 Since patients are using their own diabetes devices, we do not intend to collect device issues. However, i f a device issue results in SAE, it must be reported.  
 The investigator is responsible for reporting all AE to their IRB within five business days once they are aware of AE.  
 All non- severe and severe AE will be followed until the end of the study 
 Subjects must be instructed to notify the investigator immediately if they become 
pregnant. If a subject becomes pregnant during the study, the subject will be dropped from 
the study and followed until birth for pregnancy outcomes.  Pregnancy will be reported as an AE (or SAE if fulfills the criteria of SAE) . The sponsor -investigator is responsible for  
reporting pregnancy to Novo Nordisk and reporting will occur within same timelines described below . Pregnancy complications will be recorded as an AE  and if the infant has 
a congenital abnormality or birth defect, it will be reported and notified to the IRB  
 Site investigators are responsible to notif y their IRB within 24 hours once they are aware 
of an SAE.  
 Sponsor -Investigators will be responsible for notifying COMIRB , DSMB, the FDA and 
Novo Nordisk of an AE/SAE  within the sti pulated time frame of each of the agencies.  
 Sponsor -investigator will report to NovoNordisk all SAEs, SUSARs and SADRs within 
15 days of  the sponsor -investigator becoming aware of such adverse events. The Sponsor -
Investigator will provide the following information to NovoNordisk: study name, patient 
initials , sex, age, event (probable diagnosis), drug name (Semaglutide/placebo) and 
   
 
V 8.0_8-30-2024   Page 28 of 41 
 reporter identification (name or initials) in addition to  a description of  the AE events such 
as causality and outcome.  
 Follow -up of adverse events: Investigator must provide adequate medical care to study 
subject for any study- related adverse events including clinically significant laboratory 
values related to the study and medical care of the subjects should be provided r egardless 
of their insurance status. AE classified as serious  or possibly/probably related to trial drug 
must be followed until the subject has been recovered and all queries have been resolved. 
For cases of chronic conditions follow -up until the outcome c ategory is “recovered” is not 
required, as these cases can be closed with an outcome of “recovering” or “not recovered”. All other adverse events must be followed until the outcome of the event is “recovering” 
(for chronic conditions), or “recovered” or until the end of the post -treatment follow -up 
stated in the protocol, whichever comes first, and until all queries related to these AEs have been resolved.  
 
13.  Individual  subject stopping criteria   
Study drug administration may be stopped for any of the following reasons:  
1) Two or more episodes of severe hypoglycemia as defined in the section 13.2  
2) Two or more DKA events  not related to device malfunction. Definition of DKA is 
detailed in the section 13.2  
3) Investigator decides that, in the interest of the patient, it is not medically acceptable to continue participation in the study 
 
14. C riteria for suspending or stopping the study  
Greater than 10 cases of severe hypoglycemia or  greater than 5 cases of DKA that are not 
due to device malfunction.  These criteria are based on exceeding the average incidence of severe hypoglycemia (11.8%) and DKA  (4.8%)  in patients with T1D as reported in the Type 
1 Diabetes Exchange Clinic Registry 
50.  
15. Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
A DSBM consisting of three members (two clinicians and one statistician) will independently 
monitor the study, including adverse events and study drug or device issues with potential to 
impact participant sa fety. A meeting will be held at the beginning of the study, and every six 
   
 
V 8.0_8-30-2024   Page 29 of 41 
 months between the study team sBDC and IU investigators) and the DSMB to review any 
adverse events. Following each safety review, a summary of recommendation from the 
DSMB will be collected.  
16. Precautions/over- dosage  
Inappropriate medication  dose can cause severe hypoglycemia or hyper glycemia. The 
education on recognition of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia and its treatment will be provided at screening and as needed during the study. 
17. Risks and Discomforts  
a) Blood Drawing Risks  The risks of drawing blood from a vein include temporary discomfort from the needle stick 
(common), bruising (common), excessive bleeding (unlikely), lightheadedness (rare), 
infection (rare), and fainting (rare).   
 b) Study procedure related discomfort  
The participant may feel some discomf ort during height, weight, waist measurement and 
blood pressure measurements. All care will be taken to reduce discomfort.  
c) Side -effects related to semaglutide  
Semaglutide is a long -acting glucagon like peptide -1 (GLP -1). The most common adverse 
reactions, reported in ≥5% of patients treated with semaglutide are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
abdominal pain, and constipation.  Nausea/ vomiting can sometimes lead to dehydration and 
acute kidney injury. Semaglutide causes a delay of gastric emptying and has the potential to 
influence  the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications, so caution should be 
exercised.  Acute and chronic pancreatitis have been r eported in clinical studies. 
Hypersensitive reactions have also been reported. Semaglutide is contraindicated in patients with a history or family history of medullary thyroid cancer and in patients with multiple 
endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN -2)  
d) Risk of Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar)  
As with any person with diabetes who uses insulin, there is always a risk of having low blood 
sugar (hypoglycemia). GLP -1RA  such as semaglutide is known to improve insulin action and 
   
 
V 8.0_8-30-2024   Page 30 of 41 
 therefore, may increase risk for low blood sugar. Symptoms of low blood sugar can include 
sweating, jitteriness, and not feeling well. There is also the possibility of fainting or seizures 
(convulsions), brain damage, or death with a very low blood sugar. Since we will be closely 
monitoring participants during this study, a serious low blood sugar is less likely to occur in 
any study participant. Even if a low blood sugar does occur, it usually goes away quickly with 
treatment (carbohydrates) that raises th e blood sugar. A severe low blood sugar may require 
that a participant get an injection of glucagon and/or have emergency services to help raise his/her blood glucose level. Hypoglycemia risk mitigation  plan is discussed in the 
Appendi ces.  
e) Risk of Hyperglycemia (High Blood Sugar)  
Hyperglycemia usually does  not cause many obvious symptoms, but participants may become 
thirsty, fatigued, or have a higher level of sugar in their urine. In severe cases of 
hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or coma may occur. Hyperglycemia leading to 
DKA can lead to renal fai lure (kidney failure), cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat), 
myocardial infarction (heart attack), rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown), and even death. A serious effect from hyperglycemia is not expected to occur in any study participant, as we will 
be monitoring blood glucose levels frequently.  
f) Psychosocial Questionnaires  
Answering questionnaires about thoughts, concerns, and distress related to diabetes and general quality of life assessments may result in undesired thought processes and/or emotions. These 
feelings may be transitory, recurrent, or permanent though most ris ks are minimal/transitory.  
g) Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging – during the MRI exam, some participants may 
experience claustrophobia and discomfort, due to being enclosed in a small tube.  In order to 
minimize the risk of this occurring, potential participant s will be screened for claustrophobia or 
prior issues undergoing MRI and excluded if they have experienced claustrophobia or had other negative experiences with MRI.  In addition, participants will be excluded if they have a 
pacemaker, metal implants or aneurysm clips.  
h) Unknown Risks  
   
 
V 8.0_8-30-2024   Page 31 of 41 
 In any study, there may be additional risks that we do not know about at this time. This is not 
likely but is always a possibility. If we become aware of any new risks, participants will be told 
about them. They will be able to decide if they want to conti nue to participate in this study. If a 
treatment or procedure has increased risks because it was not done according to study procedures due to error, participants will be informed, and the necessary steps will be taken to 
care for them.  
i) Confidentiality  
There is a risk of a breach in confidentiality. Thus, a confidential subject database will be 
established to maintain study data. Data will be entered into REDCap (Research Electronic 
Data Capture). REDCap is an internal secure, computerized database syste m at the University 
of Colorado Denver. This system allows data entry, survey/questionnaire building, data exportation to statistical packages, and is HIPAA compliant. Each subject will be assigned an 
identification number, which will be used to code and i dentify all of that subject’s records. 
This will avoid the continual use of subject names. REDCap surveys can be sent to study participants via e -mail for direct input into the database. All study data will be locked in the 
PIs’ offices and all relevant co mputer study files will be input on staff computers, which are 
password protected and contain encryption software. Data storage will be on a secured server 
maintained by the University of Colorado. The server is backed up nightly and a copy of the 
back -up file is kept off site in a secure facility. Data access will be limited to study personnel. 
Study results may be presented in the form of posters, abstracts, oral presentations, or publications at academic meetings or in journals. In all forms of study res ult reporting, subject 
identification will not be disclosed. A study subject may access his/her protected health information at any time by requesting said information in writing of the investigator. The 
investigative team has been trained in IRB and HIPAA  compliance issues and will maintain 
confidentiality and protect health information. The above -stated procedures have been highly 
effective in preventing breaches of patient confidentiality for the prior and current research 
studies in which the PI has bee n and continues to be involved.

 Appendix A: General Guidance on HCL setting adjustments during drug up titration    
• Investigators must train subjects on diabetes self -management principles including 
hypoglycemia recognition, prevention, and treatment. This includes HCL specific 
training on hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia prevention and trouble shooting  
• At randomization  and week 4 and Week 8, based on baseline glycemic control (time in 
range) and risk of hypoglycemia (time below range) , investigators should adjust the HCL 
settings. The general guidance is provided below.  
 
 
 
 
*Each individual with type 1 diabetes is different in terms of response to GLP -1RA and risk for 
hypoglycemia. This is a general guidance and Investigators should adjust settings necessary to reduce the 
risk for hypoglycemia based on patient- related factors and clinical experience.  
#If needed, investigators can reduce the correction factors up to 10% (TIR>50% and TBR < 4%) or 20% 
(TBR> 4%) in addition to changes in basal rate or ICR. Moreover, investigators may recommend patients 
to use temporary manual mode, exercise mode/temporary target if above changes are not sufficient to

 Appendix C: General Guidance on HCL setting  adjustments after Week 10  
 
Glycemic goal for the most patients with T1D is TIR >70% and TBR <4%. Investigators are encouraged to review HCL settings and adjust if patient is not within the glycemic goal.   
 
 
  
*This is a general guidance and Investigators should adjust settings necessary to reduce the risk for 
hypoglycemia and improve glycemic control based on patient- related factors and clinical experience  
#If needed, investigators may strengthen correction factor (for Tandem Control IQ or Omnipod 5) or 
active insulin time (for 670/770G).  
$ Reduce the correction factors up to 10% (TIR>50%  and TBR < 4%) or 20% (TBR> 4%) in addition 
to changes in basal rate or ICR. Moreover, investigators may recommend patients to use temporary 
manual mode, exercise mode/temporary target if above changes are not sufficient to mitigate

Appendix D: General guidance on the management of hypoglycemia  
 
• Follows the guidance provided in the Appendix A -C to adjust HCL settings during drug 
up titration to minimize the risk for hypoglycemia.  
• Each subject must have glucagon product with them as a part of the standards of diabetes 
care. Subject and their caregiver (if any) must be trained on the use of glucagon product.   
• Subject should be advised to follow treatment for hypoglycemia. if glucose <70 mg/dL, take 15 grams of carbs (or less as HCL may have insulin suspension for anticipated 
hypoglycemia) and repeat glucose after 15 minutes till glucose is >70 mg/dL
 
• If patient experience severe hypoglycemia, it  should be reported as AE or SAE (if criteria 
for SAE are met). HCL setting should be adjusted to prevent another episode of 
hypoglycemia

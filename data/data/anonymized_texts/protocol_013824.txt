1.0 Background 
 
1.1 Multiple Myeloma:  Multiple myeloma is a malignancy of the differentiated plasma cells, 
that affect the older patient with a median age at onset of 65-70 years and a slight male 
predominance. Nearly 20,000 patients with myeloma are diagnosed in the United States each year, and despite considerable improvements in therapy remains incurable and 
uniformly fatal with a median overall survival  of around 8 years. Recent improvements in 
therapies have significantly improved the su rvival outcomes, but given the inevitable 
relapses seen in these patients, new approaches to therapy are clearly needed. The highly 
effective drug combinations currently used are beset with a degree of toxicity that 
precludes long-term therapy and also can affect the quality of life metrics. Finally, some 
of these regimens require IV or subcutaneous  administration, which can require frequent 
clinic, visits for patients. The highly eff ective multi-drug regimens currently in use 
typically include a proteasome inhibitor, either bortezomib given IV or SQ or carfilzomib 
given IV.  
1.2 The ubiquitin proteasome pathway in multiple myeloma:  The ubiquitin-proteasome 
pathway is critical to cellular homeostasis, playing a major role in maintaining appropriate levels of different proteins in the cell.
1,2 The ubiquitin-proteasome system is 
responsible for the orderly degradation of cellular proteins involved in virtually all 
aspects of cell growth and proliferation. Th e pathway degrades proteins involved in cell 
cycle regulation, cell survival, and metastasis such as p53, p21, p27 and NFkB. Ubiquitin 
is a 9kd protein that is abundantly present  in the cell and is highly evolutionary 
conserved. Cellular proteins that are mark ed for degradation gets polyubiquitinated; 
where C-terminal glycine residues of the ubiqu itin molecules attach covalently to specific 
lysine residues on the protein molecule. This  three step process sequentially involves the 
ubiquitin activating enzyme E1, an ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 and an ubiquitin 
ligase E3. The first ubiquitin molecule forms the nidus for additional ubiquitin molecules 
to be attached. Once, polyubiquitinated, the protein is targeted by the 26S proteasome for 
degradation, an active energy requiring process that maintains protein levels in the cell. 
The 26S proteasome in the mammalian cells consis ts of a core 20S catalytic complex and 
a 19S regulatory complex. It is a cylindrical structure with an outer ring composed of 7 
alpha subunits and an inner ring that is made  up of seven beta subunits. The 20S catalytic 
portion has chymotryptic, tryptic and peptidyl glutamyl like activities, with the catalytic 
sites located in the inner surface of the cylinder. The ubiquitinated protein is recognized by the 19S subunit, the ubiquitin tags are cl eaved, and the protein is hydrolyzed by the 
proteasome at six different catalytic sites present in the 20S catalytic complex. In vitro studies in a variety of cancers demonstrat e the ability of proteasome inhibitors to 
selectively target the malignant cells supportin g this strategy for cancer therapy. The 
mechanism of selectivity is not clear, but ma y be related to in creased dependency of 
rapidly proliferating cells on the pathway. Bortezomib was the first proteasome inhibitor 
to enter human trials.
3 
 In the setting of MM, several in vitro st udies have shown the ability of proteasome 
inhibitors to inhibit proliferation and i nduce apoptosis of MM cell lines and freshly 
isolated patient MM cells as well as overcome adhesion mediated resistance.
4 They can 
inhibit the paracrine growth of human MM cells by decreasing their adherence to bone 
marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and rela ted nuclear factor B-dependent induction of 
interleukin-6 secretion by BMSCs. The mech anism of anti-MM activity of proteasome 
inhibitors are likely multiple. Transcriptional profiling of MM cells treated with bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor currently in the clinic, demonstrated down-regulation

of growth/survival signaling pathways , and up-regulation of molecules implicated in pro-
apoptotic cascades, as well as up-regulation of heat-shock proteins and 
ubiquitin/proteasome pathway members. In addition, treatment decreased the levels of 
several anti-apoptotic proteins and triggered the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c 
and caspase-9 activation, all contributing to a poptosis of MM cells. One of the key effects 
is thought to be the inhibition of the NFkB  pathway, which is critical to the MM cell 
proliferation induced by growth factors as well as adhesion to BMSC. Other purported 
mechanisms include ( i) activation of classical stress response proteins such as heat shock 
proteins, Hsp27, Hsp70, and Hsp90; ( ii) up regulation of c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase 
(JNK); (iii) activation of extrinsic apoptotic signaling through Bid and caspase-8 cleavage; and ( iv) inactivation of DNA-dependent pr otein kinase (DNA-PK), which is 
essential for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks.  
1.3 Initial therapy of multiple myeloma : The treatment paradigms for multiple myeloma 
have undergone a significant change in the past decade.
5,6 A decade ago, patients who 
were considered eligible for transplant underwent the procedure after a brief duration of 
therapy with a steroid based regimen with or without doxorubicin. Patients ineligible for transplant went on to receive melphalan and prednisone. With these treatment approaches 
patients had a median survival of 3-4 years, with nearly 10-20% of patients dying in the first year after diagnosis. During the last d ecade several new drugs were introduced such 
as thalidomide and its analogue lenalidomide and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and these along with continued use of transp lant has led to improved survival in 
myeloma.
7 In fact, in the recent clinical trials 3-year survival has approached 90% and 1-
year mortality has dropped to under 2%.8 This progress has come through a series of 
investigations examining the efficacy of the new drugs used in various combinations and 
sequences. Initial trials in the relapsed setti ng confirmed significant clinical activity for 
all these new drugs. This was followed by sever al clinical trials that examined the 
combination of novel agents with dexameth asone in the setting of newly diagnosed 
disease. The studies consistently demonstrated superior response rates, deeper responses, 
and improved progression-free survival for patient s undergoing initial therapy with novel 
agents.8-11 The trials examined the role of the new drugs in the context of transplant 
eligible and ineligible patients. This has been followed by three drug regimens that either combined the new drugs together or incorporated an alkylator drug to the novel agent-
dexamethasone combination. These have included combinations of bortezomib and 
dexamethasone with thalidomide (VTD),  lenalidomide (VRd) or cyclophosphamide 
(VCD).
9,10,12,13 
 Of particular interest are the VCd and VR d regimens, both of wh ich have shown high 
efficacy rates and are increasingly used for initial therapy in the community.
9,13 In a phase 
2 study, Reeder et al showed that initial therapy with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and 
dexamethasone is associated with high ra te of deep responses among patients with 
previously untreated myeloma, being considered  for autologous stem cell transplantation. 
Similarly, VRd regimen has been associated with high response rates approaching 100% and deep responses with very good partial r esponse rates and complete response rates of 
over 70 and 40% respectively. It has proven to be a highly effective initial therapy for patients planning stem cell transplantation w ith no significant effect on the ability to 
successfully mobilize stem cells.   In the EVOLUTION trial, patients were randomized to receive bortezomib 1.3 mg/m
2 d 
1, 4, 8, 11 and dexamethasone 40 mg d 1,  8, 15, with either cyclophosphamide 500 
mg/m2 d 1, 8 and lenalidomide 15 mg d 1–14 (VDCR), lenalidomide 25 mg d1-14 (VRd),

cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 d 1, 8 (VCD) or cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 d 1, 8, 15 
(VCD-mod) in a 21 day cycle (maximum 8 cycles).13,14 This was followed by bortezomib 
1.3 mg/m2 (d 1, 8, 15, 22) for four 42-day maintenance cycles in all arms. VGPR or better 
was seen in 58, 51, 41 and 53% (CR rate of 25, 24, 22 and 47%) of patients (VDCR, 
VRd, VCD 8-and VCD-mod arms, respectively); the corresponding progression-free survival (PFS) at 1 year was 86, 83, 93 and 100%, respectively. Common adverse events 
included hematological toxicities, peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, and GI disturbances. 
Overall no substantial advantage was noted with the addition of cyclophosphamide to 
VRd, but the regimen did lead to more hematological toxicities. An important outcome of this trial was the similar results obtained with the VRd and VCd regimens, especially 
considering the cost differen tial between the two regimens. 
  
1.4 Light chain amyloidosis:  Light chain amyloidosis is characterized by light chain 
secreting plasma cells in the bone marrow, usually in small numbers, but leading to formation and deposition of am yloid protein in different organs including the heart, 
kidneys and liver. While therapeutic options  have improved over time and patients with 
AL are living longer, it remains incurable and patients invariably need additional therapeutic options. The median survival of  patients with AL amyloidosis is 18-24 
months with nearly 40% dying within the first year of diagnosis. 1-4. Traditionally, therapies that have appeared to be promisi ng for treatment of patients with myeloma have 
been studied in the context of amyloidosis, given the fundamental similarities in the 
disease.  
 The combination of melphalan and prednisone has been in use for decades and results in 
approximately 20-30% of patients achieving a measurable response 5-7.  Several 
prospective randomized studies have demonstr ated that chemotherapy-treated patients 
have a longer median survival than patients who do not receive chemotherapy 8-10.  The 
median survival of the melphalan- and pre dnisone (MP) treated group of patients in a 
phase III trial conducted at Mayo Clinic was 17 months compared to 8.5 months for those not receiving MP9. Even though this represented a significant improvement, the outcome still remained dismal and patients with signi ficant cardiac disease had a median survival 
of only six months. Patients in this trial who achieved a reduction in their paraprotein 
level had a longer survival compared to those who did not highlighting the importance of 
hematologic response. A similar trial conducte d at the Boston University resulted in 
similar improvements with Me lphalan and prednisone10. Majority of patients fail to 
demonstrate objective evidence of disease regression and ultimately succumb to their disease.  
 
High dose therapy and melphalan with au tologous peripheral blood stem cell 
transplantation has been used for treatment of  amyloidosis, given its efficacy and survival 
advantage in patients with multiple myel oma 11-13.  Case controlled studies have 
demonstrated that high dose therapy improves survival in patients with amyloidosis who 
are eligible to go through the procedure 14. Stem cell transplant results in improvement 
in the organ function in over half of the patients who survive the process13. Many of 
these responses also tend to be durable. However, there remains considerable selection 
bias as case controlled studies have shown that patients eligible for a stem cell transplant have better overall performance status and are lik ely to do better than the average patient 
even with out stem cell transplant15. Moreover,  this modality is not feasible in nearly two 
thirds of AL patients due to poor performance status and advanced organ involvement. The risk of mortality is considerable (20- 40% in different series) and increases with the

degree of individual organ involvement as well as the number of organs involved. So 
alternative, effective and less toxic regimens ar e needed for the majority of patients with 
this disease. 
 More recently, studies have highlighted the role of proteasome inhibitors in the treatment of AL amyloidosis. This agent is of part icular importance given the ability to reduce 
immunoglobulin free light chain levels and the cr itical role of the free light chains in the 
amyloid pathophysiology. Bortezomib has been used in combination with dexamethasone alone or cyclophosphamide or melphalan along with dexamethasone.  Kastritis et al 
reported on 94 patients from three centers tr eated with bortezomib and dexamethasone, 
with nearly 80% of the patients with re lapsed disease.16 A hematologic response was 
achieved in 71%, including 25% complete r esponses. Previously untreated patients had a 
47% CR rate. Hematologic responses were associated with a cardiac response and NT-proBNP reduction. Toxicity was manageable  and mostly consisted of neuropathy, 
orthostasis, peripheral edema, and constipation or diarrhea. Reece et al studied 31 patients in a dose escalation study of bort ezomib given weekly or twice weekly and 
observed hematologic responses in 50% of  30 evaluable patients, including 20% 
complete responses.17 More recently, Venner et al studied 43 patients treated with AL cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone.18 The overall hematologic response rate was 81.4%, including complete response in 42% and very good partial in 51.4%. The estimated 2-year progression-free survival was 66.5% for patients treated upfront and 41.4% for relapsed patients.  
 
Ixazomib is the first oral proteasome inhibitor introduced in the clinic, and is currently 
approved for use in relapsed myeloma. Ixazomib has been evaluated as an oral single agent in phase 1 studies that have included patients with advanced solid tumors, lymphoma, relapse/refractory MM (RRMM), and relapsed or refractory light-chain (AL) 
amyloidosis and demonstrated early signs of activity.19,20 Ixazomib has also been 
studied alone and in combination with dexa methasone in patients with relapsed disease 
not refractory to bortezomib. Thirty-three patients with relapsed multiple myeloma were treated with Ixazomib at 5.5  mg weekly for 3 of 4 weeks. Dexamethasone was added for 
lack of a minor response (MR) by end of cycle 2 or lack of a partial response (PR) by end of cycle 4 or for disease progression at any time. Median age was 69 years; patients had a 
median of two prior therapies (range 1-7) . Dexamethasone was initiated in 22 (67%) 
patients, 17 for not reaching the desired response and 5 for progression. Response ( ⩾PR) 
to single agent was seen in five patients within four cycles of therapy including three 
patients with PR, one patient with complete response (CR) and one patient with stringent 
CR. Six additional patients with either an MR  (2) or SD (4) achieved a PR after addition 
of dexamethasone, translating to an overall response rate of 34%. Ongoing studies 
continue to investigate both single-agent Ixazomib and Ixazomib in combination with 
standard treatments. A recently reported phase 3 trial of Ixazomib in combination with 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone in relap sed myeloma with 1-3 prior treatments 
demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS.  Previously a phase 2 trial of the same 
combination in newly diagnosed myeloma was ve ry effective with high rate of responses, 
deep responses and well tolerated with the ability to administer the drug long term.21 Ixazomib also appear to combine well with cy clophosphamide and has been shown to be 
effective in relapsed and newly diagnosed myeloma.  
 
1.5 IXAZOMIBIxazomib:    Ixazomib, which has been fo rmulated for both intravenous (IV) 
and oral (PO) administration, is a small molecule proteasome inhibitor.  It is the citrate 
ester of the biologically active boronic acid form, MLN2238, which is structurally similar 
 10   MC1382 
Millennium # X16009 
                       MCCC Add 13 
Protocol Version Date:    February 23, 2021  
to bortezomib.  In water or aqueous systems, Ixazomib rapidly hydrolyzes to MLN2238, 
therefore all doses and concentrations ar e expressed as MLN2238.  Nonclinical studies 
were conducted with a solution of either  MLN2238 or MLN2238 in equilibrium with 
Ixazomib.  Similar to bortezomib, MLN2238 potently, reversibly, and selectively inhibits the 20S proteasome.  However in contrast to bortezomib, it has a shorter dissociation half-life (t1/2) that may contribute to incr eased tissue distribution.  Bortezomib has a 
slowly reversible dissociation rate from the red blood cell proteasome, while MLN2238 
demonstrates a more rapidly reversible di ssociation rate from the blood but sustained 
effects on bone marrow and tumor proteasomes suggesting better tissue distribution.  The pharmacologic implications of this difference in binding kinetics and tissue distribution may in turn result in differences in safety and efficacy profiles in a broader range of 
tumors.  In xenograft-bearing mice, the more rapid dissociation rate correlates with an 
increased ratio of tumor proteasome inhib ition to blood proteasome inhibition, and 
Ixazomib shows greater antitumor activity in several xenograft models, both solid tumor and bortezomib-resistant xenografts, than bortezomib.   
 
Nonclinical Pharmacology : MLN2238 refers to the biologically active, boronic acid form 
of the drug substance, Ixazomib.  Ixazomib refers to the citrate ester of MLN2238.  In water or aqueous systems, the equilibrium shifts from Ixazomib to the biologically active boronic acid form MLN2238.  All doses and concentrations are expressed as the boronic acid, MLN2238.  
In Vitro Pharmacology: MLN2238 preferentially binds the β5 site of the 20S proteasome; 
at higher concentrations, it also inhibits the activity of the β 1 and β2 sites.  MLN2238 
inhibits ß5 site 20S proteasome activity in  vitro, with a half-maximal inhibitory 
concentration (IC50) of 3.4 nM.  Potency is reduced roughly 10-fold versus ß1 (IC50  31 
nM) and 1,000-fold versus ß2 (IC50 =3500 nM).  MLN2238 was also tested for inhibition against a panel of 103 kinases, 18 receptors (neurotransmitter, ion channel, 
brain and gut receptors), and 9 serine proteases.  In all cases, the IC50 values were > 10 
μM.  MLN2238 and bortezomib have different β5 proteasome dissociation half-lives 
(t1/2), reflecting differences in their on-off bindi ng kinetics (the β5 proteasome 
dissociation t1/2 for MLN2238 and bortezomib are 18 and 110 minutes, respectively).  Based on these favorable characteristics, Ixazomi b is anticipated to be effective against 
multiple myeloma. (Ixazomib Investigator’s Brochure (IB). Proteasome inhibition results in the accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated substr ates within the cell and leads to cell cycle 
disruption, with concomitant activation of apopt otic pathways and cell death.  Consistent 
with inhibition of ß5 20S activity, MLN2238 demonstrated potent activity against cultured MDA-MB 231 human breast cancer cel ls in the WST cell viability assay.  In 
nonclinical models MLN2238 has activity ag ainst both solid tumor and bortezomib-
resistant xenografts  In Vivo Pharmacology : To determine the activity of MLN2238 in vivo, 
pharmacodynamic studies were performed in immunocompromised mice bearing either CWR22 human prostate or WSU-DLCL2 (human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
[DLBCL]) tumors.  Pharmacodynamic responses in xenograft tumors were analyzed by 
assessing 20S proteasome inhibition and by evaluating levels of accumulated protein markers such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)  damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34) 
and activating transcription factor-3 (ATF-3) as well as measuring growth arrest.  Increased expression of GADD34 and ATF-3 is  indicative of a downstream biological 
response to proteasome inhibition.  After a single dose of MLN2238, a clear dose response was observed in CWR22 xenografts  as seen in both tumor 20S proteasome 
 11   MC1382 
Millennium # X16009 
                       MCCC Add 13 
Protocol Version Date:    February 23, 2021  
inhibition and in changes in GADD34 and ATF-3 expression.  In WSU-DLCL2 
xenografts, greater tumor proteasome inhibition was observed with MLN2238 compared to bortezomib and resulted in increased expression of GADD34 and ATF-3. MLN2238 efficacy experiments demonstrated str ong antitumor activity in 4 xenograft models: 
CWR22 (a human prostate cancer cell line) and 3 human lymphoma cell lines (WSU-DLCL2, OCI-Ly7-7D1-luc, and PHTX-22L).  In the case of the CWR22 xenograft 
model, significant antitumor activity w as seen with both IV and PO dosing, 
demonstrating that this molecule has antitu mor activity when administered via different 
dosing routes.  In all 3 lymphoma lines, MLN2238 demonstrated stronger antitumor 
activity than did bortezomib. In summary, MLN2238, similar to bortezomib, is a dipeptide boronic acid proteasome inhibitor that potently, reversibly, and selectively 
inhibits the proteasome.  There are several features, such as sustained pharmacodynamic effects and activity in a bortezomib-refractory lymphoma xenograft model, that suggest that it may have activity that extends  beyond that seen with bortezomib. 
 
Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics : Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics: 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of MLN2238 were studied in severe combined 
immunodeficient (SCID) mice bearing hum an CWR22 tumor xenografts, Sprague-
Dawley rats, beagle dogs, and cynomolgus m onkeys.  Because of the extensive red blood 
cell (RBC) partitioning of MLN2238, both blood and plasma PK parameters were determined in these studies.  MLN2238 had a very low blood clearance (CLb) and a moderate blood volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss,b) after IV administration.  
The concentration-versus-time curve of ML N2238 displayed a distinct bi-exponential 
profile with a steep initial distribution phase and a long terminal t
1/2 (> 24 hr) in all 
species tested.  MLN2238 had higher plasma  clearance (CLp) and a larger plasma 
volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss, p) than in blood, largely because of the 
extensive RBC partitioning. The PK properties of MLN2238 after oral administration were studied in rats and dogs.  The plasma oral bioavailability (F) was 41% in rats and 
nearly 100% in dogs.  A clinical prototype formulation of the Ixazomib capsule 
demonstrated that MLN2238 had excellent oral  F and an excellent absorption profile in 
dogs.  In addition, interindividual variabi lity, as measured by %CV, in Cmax and AUC
0-
24hr after oral administration was low to moderate, similar to that after IV administration.  
The terminal t 1/2 after oral administration was also similar to that after IV administration.  
Comparison of the PK profiles after IV or PO administration in the dog is reported in 
further detail in the IB. MLN2238 is predicte d to have very low CLb (0.0045 L/hr/kg) 
and a moderate Vss,b (0.79 L/kg) with a long terminal t 1/2 (> 24 hours) in humans.  The 
human efficacious IV dose of MLN 2238 is predicted to be 2.0 mg/m2 (0.054 mg/kg) 
twice weekly. The human efficacious oral dose is predicted to be between 2 and 5 mg/m2 
twice weekly, based on a predicted oral F of between 41% (as seen in rats) and 100% (as seen in dogs).  The efficacious dose projection for once weekly oral would be higher than twice weekly oral (data not provided).  Metabolism appears to be a major route of elimination for MLN2238 and urinary 
excretion of the parent drug was negligible (<  5% of dose).  In vitro in liver microsomes, 
the metabolism of MLN2238 was high in mice and low to moderate in all other species 
studied.  MLN2238 is metabolized by multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes and non-CYP enzymes and proteins.  The rank order of relative biotransformation activity of 
each of the 5 major human CYP isozymes in the in vivo studies was 3A4 (34.2%) > 1A2 
(30.7%) > 2D6 (14.7%) > 2C9 (12.1%) > 2C19 (negligible).

                       MCCC Add 13

MLN2238 is neither an inhibitor of CYP is ozymes 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 (IC50 
> 30 μM, with an estimated inhibition dissociation constant [Ki] > 15 μM) nor a time 
dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 (up to 30 μM).  The potential for Ixazomib treatment 
to produce DDIs via CYP inhibition is inferred to be low. 
 In a Caco-2 cell assay, MLN2238 showed medium permeability with a B-to-A/A-to-B 
permeability ratio of 2.9.  MLN2238 may be a lo w-affinity substrate of para-glycoprotein 
(P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multidrug resistance protein 2 
(MRP2) efflux pump transporters.  MLN2238 is not an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, and 
MRP2 (IC50 > 100 μM).  Consequently, the potential for MLN2238 to cause DDIs with substrates or inhibitors of P-gp, BCRP, and MRP2 is low.   
 
See the IB for further details.  
1.4 Safety Pharmacology : In exploratory safety pharmacology studies, MLN2238 was a 
weak inhibitor of the cloned cardiac potassium (K+) human ether à-go-g o related gene 
(hERG) channel, with an IC50 of 59.6 μM, which exceeds, by approximately 200-fold, 
the plasma Cmax (111 ng/mL [0.3 μM]) predicted to occur in humans at the optimally 
efficacious dose after IV administration. 
 In the GLP-compliant, 1-cycle, repeat-dose, PO toxicology study in beagle dogs, an increase in QTc was seen in male dogs at non- tolerated doses, and a potential increase in 
QTc was seen in male dogs at tolerated do ses.  However, increased  QTc was not seen in 
female dogs at any dose, despite the fact that female dogs had plasma Cmax values 
similar to those of male dogs.  Additionally, in a GLP-compliant, 2-cycle, repeat-dose, IV toxicology study in beagle dogs, no increase in QTc was seen in either male or female 
dogs at any dose, even though dogs in the IV study had higher MLN2238 plasma Cmax 
values than did the male dogs in the PO stud y.  These data suggest that MLN2238 has a 
low potential for prolonging the QT interval in vivo. 
 Toxicology : All studies discussed in this section were  conducted with a solution of either 
MLN2238 or MLN2238 in equilibrium with Ixazomib.  Because Ixazomib was shown to dissociate immediately to MLN2238 upon exposure to plasma in vitro and therefore 
could not be detected in plasma samples in vitro all doses, concentrations, and PK 
parameters noted, here and in the IB, are expressed as the boronic acid, MLN2238. 
 The toxicology studies of MLN2238 were studied in SCID mice bearing human CWR22 tumor xenografts, Sprague-Dawley rats, beag le dogs, and cynomolgus  monkeys.  Details 
of these studies are included in the IB.  In Vitro Toxicology: MLN2238 was not mutagenic in a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames assay).   In Vivo Toxicology: Details of the in vivo toxicology IV dosing and oral dosing studies 
are provided in the IB.  To summarize, the t oxicologic effects seen in the IV and PO 
studies are qualitatively similar to what was pr eviously observed in rodents dosed with 
bortezomib, for which Ixazomib is the next-generation molecule.  MLN2238 did not 
cause significant toxicities that have not been previously observed after dosing with bortezomib.  Therefore, on the basis of the si milarity in the toxicity profile in rats 
between MLN22338 and bortezomib, MLN2238 is  not known to present any additional 
safety risks beyond those that occur after treat ment with bortezomib.  In addition, there

were no significant findings at tolerated exposures in dogs observed after PO 
administration that were not seen after IV administration, and similar exposures were tolerated regardless of the route of administration.  The potential risks identified from nonclinical studies in dogs and rats include: 
• GI toxicity that could result in nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, 
electrolyte imbalance, bleeding, bowel obst ruction including ileus and intussusception, 
and sepsis. • Reduced blood counts manifest as thromboc ytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia.  
Reticulocytopenia was described in animals and may be associated with anemia.  
Reductions in blood counts may predispose to an increased susceptibility to infection, 
bleeding, and anemia. 
• Peripheral nerve ganglia effects that may be associated with peripheral 
neuropathy that includes pain, burning sensa tion, and numbness.  Autonomic and motor 
neuropathy may be observed, as both have been reported for bortezomib. • Lymphoid cell depletion that may be associa ted with increased risk of infection, 
including re-activation of herpes zoster. • Acute phase response that may result in fever and metabolic changes. 
 
All of the effects seen in the GLP-compliant PO toxicology studies in both dogs and rats 
at tolerated doses were reversible/reversing and can be monitored in the clinic with 
routine clinical observations (GI disturbances and infections secondary to lymphoid compromise), clinical pathology assessments (inhibition of erythropoiesis, thrombocytopenia, and inflammatory leukogr am), and neurologic assessment, as are 
commonly done for patients treated with bortezomib.  The neurologic lesions in these studies are similar to what has been described after treatment with bortezomib and are 
believed to be the cause of the peripheral ne uropathy observed in patients treated with 
bortezomib. 
 Further details are presented in the IB.  
Clinical Experience with Ixazomib 
 
As of 30 April 2012, 382 patients have been  treated with Ixazomib across 9 enrolling, 
sponsor-led phase 1 or phase 1/2 studies evalua ting both twice-weekly and weekly dosing 
schedules.  Ixazomib is available as an intravenous and oral formulation. Regardless of 
the route of administration in the twice-weekly dosing schedule, Ixazomib is given on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day cycle; in the weekly dosing schedule, the drug is given 
on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. To date, the development of oral Ixazomib has 
focused on multiple myeloma [relapsed and/ or refractory and newly diagnosed] and a 
different yet related plasma cell dyscrasia, systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis. A clinical pharmacology study looking at drug-drug interactions, the effect of food, and bioavailability also uses the oral formulation.  Details of these trials can be found in 
ClinicalTrials.gov and the Ixazomib IB.         Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism : Clinical IV and PO pharmacokinetic (PK) data 
show that Ixazomib (measured as the biologically active boronic acid form of Ixazomib [MLN2238]) has multi-exponential disposition w ith a rapid initial phase that is largely 
over by 4 hours.  Oral Ixazomib is rapidly ab sorbed with a median time to first maximum 
plasma concentration (T
max) of approximately 0.5 to 2.0 hours and terminal t 1/2 after 
 14   MC1382

                       MCCC Add 13

multiple dosing of approximately 5 to 7 days.15  Results of a population PK analysis (N = 
137) show that there is no relationship be tween body surface area (BSA) or body weight 
and clearance (CL).  Also, based on stochas tic simulations for fixed dose, exposures are 
independent of the individual patient’s BSA.16  Based on these data, a recommendation 
was made for fixed dosing in clinical trials .  An absolute bioavailability of 67% was 
determined for Ixazomib using the population PK analysis.  See the IB for information on 
the PK for IV doses of Ixazomib. 
 Metabolism appears to be the major route of elimination for Ixazomib, with negligible 
urinary excretion of the parent drug (< 3% of dose).  In vitro studies of liver microsomes show that Ixazomib is metabolized by multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) and 
non-CYP enzymes/proteins.  The rank order of relative biotransformation activity of the 
5 major human CYP isozymes is 3A4 (34. 2%) > 1A2 (30.7%) > 2D6 (14.7%) > 2C9 
(12.1%) > 2C19 (< 1%).  Ixazomib is not an in hibitor of CYPs 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 
3A4, nor is it a time-dependent inhibito r of CYP3A4/5.  The potential for Ixazomib 
treatment to produce DDIs via CYP inhibition is inferred to be low; however, there may 
be a potential for DDIs with a concomitant strong CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 inhibitor because 
of the potential for first-pass metabolism when Ixazomib is administered via the PO route 
and because of the moderate contribution of CYP3A4- and CYP1A2-mediated metabolism of Ixazomib in human liver microsomes.  Ixazomib may be a weak substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multidrug 
resistance associated protein (MRP2) efflux pump transporters.  Ixazomib is not an 
inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, and MRP2.  The potential for DDIs with substrates or inhibitors 
of P-gp, BCRP, and MRP2 is, therefore, inferred to be low. 
      
  Clinical Trial Experience Using the Oral Formulation of Ixazomib : 
 
In the 7 studies actively enrolling patients to investigate oral Ixazomib in patients with 
differing malignancies (multiple myeloma, AL  amyloidosis, nonhematologic cancers, and 
lymphoma), a total of 242 patients have been  treated as of 30 April 2012. These patients 
have been treated with different doses of Ix azomib, either as a single agent treatment or 
in combination with currently clinically av ailable treatments. Information regarding the 
ongoing studies, patient populations, and doses investigated are included in Table 1-1.

Overview of the Oral Formulation of Ixazomib 
The emerging safety profile indicates that oral Ixazomib is generally well tolerated with 
predominant toxicities largely reversible, ab le to be monitored by routine clinical 
examinations and manageable by dose reductions, discontinuation, or standard supportive care. From experience from phase 1 through 2 studies the major toxicities can be managed to allow repeat treatment cycles over periods extending beyond 24 months.  
In the 4 ongoing studies (C16003, C16004, C16007, and C16009) investigating single-agent oral Ixazomib in patients with differing malignancies (multiple myeloma, AL amyloidosis, nonhematologic cancers, and lymphoma), a total of 146 patients have been 
treated as of 30 April 2012. These patients ha ve been treated with different doses of 
Ixazomib as they are all phase 1 trials. An ove rview of the most frequent (at least 10%) 
AEs occurring in the pooled safety  population from single-agent oral Ixazomib Studies

In the 3 studies actively enrolling patients to investigate oral Ixazomib in combination  
with standard combination regimens in patie nts with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, 
a total of 96 patients have been treated as of 30 April 2012. These patients have been 
treated with different doses of Ixazomi b in combination with lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone in 2 trials (C16005 and C16008) and with melphalan a nd prednisone in 1 
trial (C16006). The most frequent (at least 10%) adverse events occurring in the pooled

The clinical experience with Ixazomib also shows early signs of antitumor activity as 
evidenced by at least a 50% reduction in disease burden in some patients and prolonged disease stabilization in others across all ongoing  trials. The antitumor activity has been 
seen with single-agent Ixazomib, when combined with established therapies, and across 
the malignancies studied (advanced solid tumors [3], non-Hodgkin’s disease, Hodgkin’s 
disease [4], relapsed and/or refractory multip le myeloma [RRMM; 5; 6], relapsed or 
refractory systemic light chain amyloidosis [RRAL; 7], and newly diagnosed multiple 
myeloma [NDMM; 8; 9; 10]) to date.  Though additional data are needed to characterize the clinical benefit of this drug, the 
emerging data supports the ongoi ng development of Ixazomib. 
 
Of particular relevance to this study (C 16011) is the clinical experience from Studies 
C16004 and C16007 in which single-agent Ixazomib is administered weekly in patients with RRMM or RRAL, respectively.

Relapsed MM: Single-agent, Weekly Ixazomib (Study C16004) :  
Study C16004 is an open-label, dose-escalati on, phase 1 study of Ixazomib administered 
weekly on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle in adult patients with RRMM. Patients 
with MM enrolled in the dose-escalation component of the study have relapsed following 
at least 2 lines  of therapy, which must have included bortezomib, thalidomide (or lenalidomide), and corticosteroids. The dose- escalation phase of the trial has completed. 
In this study, 2 of 3 patients experienced pr otocol-defined DLTs (Grade 3 rash and Grade 
3 nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) at a dose of  3.95 mg/m2. As per protocol, subsequent 
patients were treated at 1 dose level be low (2.97mg/m2) where 1 of 6 patients 
experienced a DLT (Grade 3 nausea, vomiting,  and diarrhea). The MTD of weekly oral 
Ixazomib was determined to be 2.97 mg/m2.  Once the MTD was established, cohorts of  patients representing the heterogeneous 
patient population currently seen  in clinical practice were enrolled in order to further 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynamics of oral Ixazomib. 
The MTD expansion cohorts enrolling are:  1. Relapsed and Refractory expansion cohor t [refractory is defined as disease progression 
while on therapy or within 60 days after the last dose of therapy]; 
2. Carfilzomib expansion cohort 
3. Proteasome Inhibitor-Naïve expansion cohort 4. VELCADE-Relapsed expansion cohort Final study results are not available for this  ongoing trial, but preliminary data suggest 
Ixazomib has antitumor activity in heavily pretreated MM patients, with durable 
responses/disease control, and is generally well to lerated.[11,12] 
 
As of the 30 April 2012 data cut, these patie nts are considered heavily pretreated as 
evidenced by a median number of 4 (range 1–13) prior lines of therapy, with 66% refractory to the last line of therapy. Patients have received a median of 2 cycles of therapy (range, 1- 11). Five patients have ach ieved objective response: 1 patient achieved 
a VGPR and 4 patients achieved a PR. Additio nally, 15 patients achieved durable disease 
stabilization for up to 9.5 months. At data  cut-off, 15 patients remain on treatment; 
discontinuation of treatment was primarily due to progressive disease (69%).  A summary of the safety profile of patients treated in Study C16004 is outlined in Table 
1-4. 
Overall, 92% of patients experienced a TEAE of any grade and of any cause. Peripheral 
neuropathy was limited to Grade 1/ 2 in 6 patients, with 3 patients reporting baseline 
Grade 1 PN at study entry.

Dose reductions required were due to AE s that included rash, neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, hypotension, increase in 
serum creatinine, abdominal pain, ileus, fa tigue, and pneumonia. The AEs reported for 
the 5 patients who were required to discontinue treatment included Grade 2 Ixazomib-related nausea/vomiting in 1 patient treated  above the MTD, Grade 3 Ixazomib-related 
diarrhea in a second patient, related Grade 3 thrombocytopenia, related Grade 2 dyspnea, and notrelated Grade 4 elevation in creatin ine(1 patient each). There were no on-study 
deaths. 
 
Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma (C16005):   
In Study C16005, Ixazomib is given weekly (Days 1, 8, and 15), in combination with lenalidomide (Days 1-21), and dexamethasone (Day s 1, 8, 15, and 22) in a 28-day cycle.  
Enrollment to this study is closed.    Clinical data as of 30 April 2012 is available.  The MTD in Study C16005 was 
determined to be 2.97 mg/m
2 given weekly in a 28-day cycle with LenDex.  The DLTs 
were urticarial rash, dizziness, nausea, orthos tatic hypotension, vomiting, diarrhoea, and 
syncope.  The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) estimation was established following 
evaluation of the available data from the ph ase 1 portion of the trial which included, but 
was not limited to, analyses of efficacy results  and adverse events (Grade 3/4 AEs, SAEs, 
all grades peripheral neuropathy, and treatment discontinuation).  Given that the dose of 
Ixazomib at 2.97 mg/m2 compromised the maximal dosing of lenalidomide and that the 
dose of 2.23 mg/m2 is very tolerable and clinically  active, Millennium designated 2.23 
mg/m2 as the RP2D after evaluation of the data  and discussion with investigators.  The 
RP2D of 2.23 mg/m2 has been translated into a fixed dose of 4.0 mg based on the results 
from the population PK analysis.  Enrollment in this study has been completed; final study results are not available, but prelimin ary data suggests oral Ixazomib given weekly 
plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone in a 28-day cycle appears well tolerated with 
manageable toxicity and encouraging antitumor activity.   
 In Study C16005, 15 of 15 (100%) patients in the dose escalation portion of the study 
experienced at least 1 TEAE irrespective of grade or causality.  At the MTD across all 
dose expansion cohorts 49 of  53 patients (including 3 patients from the dose escalation

cohort [92%]) reported at least 1 TEAE irrespective of grade or causality.  In the MTD 
cohorts, fatigue was the most common AE re ported (38%).  Other common AEs reported 
include nausea (32%), constipation (30%),  upper respiratory infection (23%), and 
peripheral oedema (21%).  Skin toxicity, pr imarily erythematous rash, occurred in 62% 
of patients (of note, rash is an overlapping toxicity with Ixazomib and lenalidomide).  Peripheral neuropathy was repor ted in 13% of patients; Grade 3 in 1 patient.   
 A summary of the overall safety profile of patie nts treated in Study C16005 is outlined in 
Table 1-6.  Overall, 100% of 65 patients expe rienced at least one TEAE of any grade and 
of any cause.

One patient discontinued study drug administra tion due to a TEAE (patient with DLT of 
acute rise in serum creatinine, dyspnea, and cardiac arrest treated at 5.5 mg, as noted 
above). No death has been reported. 
The potential risks reported with Ixazomib use, pooled from all studies using the oral 
formulations, were anticipated based on prec linical data and previous experience with 
VELCADE and are noted in the Ixazomib IB, SMA, and ICF documents. Regardless of whether Ixazomib is administered on the on ce weekly or twice weekly dosing schedule, 
there is consistency among the type of TEAEs reported, despite some differences in the frequency and severity of the reported events . While the predominant potential toxicities 
may be severe in some cases, they are largel y reversible, and can be managed by routine 
clinical monitoring and standard medical interventions, which may include dose reductions and supportive care. Please refer to the Ixazomib IB and SMA for further 
information.

The most common drug-related SAEs repor ted in Study C16005 as of 30 April 2012 
include pneumonia, infection, diverticulitis , localised infection, gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage, respiratory syncytial viru s (RSV) pneumonia faecaloma, pyrexia, 
pneumonia respiratory syncytial viral, non-car diac chest pain, peripheral oedma, asthenia, 
hyponatraemia vomiting, diarrhoea, nausea, ch est pain, dehydration, anemia, dizziness, 
peripheral sensory neuropathy, orthostatic hypotension, embolism, muscular weakness, acute renal failure, blood creatinine increased , maculopapular rash, atrial fibrillation, 
syncope, hypotension, and deep vein thrombosis, and back pain.    As of the clinical data cutoff, 4 patients have discontinued treatment due to TEAEs 
including gastrointestinal haemorrhage, angioedema, syncope, and RSV pneumonia. 
 One death was reported for a patient with RS V pneumonia; the event was deemed by the 
investigator to be related to treatment with Ixazomib.    
1.6  Anti-myeloma activity of Ixazomib :  
 Several clinical trials ha ve been conducted with Ixazomi b in patients with relapsed 
myeloma as well as newly diagnosed myeloma. These have included trials of Ixazomib as a single agent, in combination with dexa methasone, as well as in combination with 
lenalidomide. As mentined before, two diffe rent dose schedules have been explored as 
well; once weekly for 3 out of four weeks and twice weekly for 2 out of 3 weeks.  
 
Ixazomib was studied as a single agent in patients with relapsed and or refractory MM ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).
17 The trial was designed to assess safety, MTD, and response rate with 
twice-weekly oral Ixazomib. Patients with ≥2 prior therapies (including bortezomib, 
thalidomide/lenalidomide, and corticosteroid s) were enrolled and treated with Ixazomib 
on d 1, 4, 8, and 11 of 21-d cycles. At the MTD (2.0 mg/m2), patients were enrolled to 
relapsed and refractory [RR], bortezomib-rela psed [VR], proteasome-inhibitor [PI] naïve, 
and carfilzomib [CZ] expansion cohorts. Fift y-eight patients were enrolled, 38 to the 
expansion cohorts (19 RR, 11 VR , 6 PI naïve, 2 CZ). Patients have received a median of 
3 cycles (range 1-24) to date (data cut-off Dec 1, 2011); 7 (12%) have received ≥13 
cycles. Of 53 response-evaluable patients, 6 have achieved ≥PR, with 1 sCR (PI naïve 
cohort) and 5 PRs (2 in dose-escalation, 1 in RR, 2 in VR cohorts), and 1 VR patient has 
achieved MR, with duration of disease control of up to 18.6 months (Figure 1 below).

 In a very similar trial Ixazomib was admini stered once weekly for 3 weeks in 4 week 
cycles. ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).18 Patients with relapsed/refractory MM who had ≥2 prior 
therapies (including bortezomib, thalidomide/lenalidomide, and corticosteroids) were treated with Ixazomib on d 1, 8, and 15 of 28-d cycles. At the MTD, patients were to be enrolled to relapsed and refractory (RR), bor tezomib-relapsed (VR), proteasome inhibitor 
(PI) naïve, and carfilzomib (CZ) expansion cohorts. Overall, 52 patients have been 
enrolled, 32 in the dose-escalation phase (0.24– 3.95 mg/m2) and 23 to  expansion cohorts 
(12 RR, 5 VR, 5 PI naïve, 1 CZ). Patients have received a median of 2 cycles (range 1–11); 15 patients remain on treatment at last follow up. In 18 response-evaluable patients, 
1 had a VGPR at 3.95 mg/m2, 1 had a PR at 2.97 mg/m2, 2 had a PR in the expansion 
cohorts and 12 have achieved SD durable for up to 9.5 months (Figure 2 below).

Ixazomib shows early signs of antitumor activity as evidenced by at least a 50% 
reduction in disease burden in some patients and prolonged disease stabilization in others 
across all ongoing trials [3,4,5,6,8,9,10]. 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, good clinical practice 
(GCP), applicable regulatory requireme nts, and International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines 
 1.8 Role of maintenance therapy in myeloma : The concept of maintenance therapy has 
been tested mostly in the setting of hi gh dose therapy and autologous stem cell 
transplantation. Patients invariably relapse after initial treatment strategies including SCT 
and various trials have atte mpted to maintain the SCT response through maintenance 
approaches. Initial trials prior to the availab ility of the new drugs have examined steroids 
or interferon, and a small randomized clinical trial of interferon- (3 x 10
6 units/m2) 
subcutaneously 3 times weekly, followi ng initial ASCT, suggested a modest 
improvement in EFS.20 The IFM99-02 trial randomized patients with standard-risk MM 
(Beta 2-microglobulin [B2M] <3, no deletion 13), were: to receive no maintenance, 
pamidronate, or pamidronate plus  thalidomide after tandem SCT.21 Thalidomide was 
associated with higher response rates, impr oved EFS (52% vs. 36% with no maintenance) 
and improved overall survival (4-year estimated  survival from diagnosis with thalidomide 
(87%) compared with no maintenance (77%). At  least 5 different randomized trials have 
examined the role of thalidomide as a maintenance therapy post-SCT.22-24 A meta-
analysis of these trials support the improved progression-free survival, but remains 
equivocal in terms of overall survival improve ment. In addition, high discontinuation rate 
has been noted in all these studies due to t oxicity. In particular the Canadian study 
showed worsening of QoL parameters am ong patients getting thalidomide maintenance.24  
 
A phase 3 study from the IFM enrolled 614 patients < 65 years, with non-progressive disease, within 6 months after upfront ASCT.
25 Patients received 2 cycles of 
consolidation with lenalidomide 25 mg daily for 3 of 4 weeks followed by a 
randomization to lenalidomide 10-15 mg/d un til relapse or to placebo (n=307 in each 
arm). Patients were stratified according to Be ta-2M, del13, and VGPR to initial therapy. 
There was an improvement in the PFS with ma intenance therapy, with a median PFS of 
42 months for lenalidomide vs. 24 months for the placebo. The improvement in the PFS 
was seen in all the subgroups based on stratif ication. With the current follow up, overall 
survival (OS) remains identical in the two gr oups. In a very similar trial, McCarthy and 
colleagues randomized patients 70 years or younger, who attained a stable disease or 
better with their induction therapy and underwent ASCT within one year of diagnosis, to 
lenalidomide (5-15 mg/day) or placebo until relapse.26 Patients were stratified based on 
Beta-2M and use of thalidomide or lenalidom ide therapy during induction. Patients were 
enrolled prior to the ASCT, with 19% of the 568 enrolled dropping out before randomization. As expected, grade 3 and 4 adve rse events were significantly higher in the 
maintenance arm, with hematological toxic ities being the common events. The median 
time to progression was 42 months with lenali domide compared to 21.8 months with the 
placebo, results very similar to the Fren ch study. More recent updates suggest an 
improvement in the overall survival for the lenalidomide arm in the CALGB study. There 
are differences, however, between the two tria ls in terms of the design as well as duration 
of therapy. Patients in the IFM trial received uniform induction therapy unlike the CALGB trial. Patients in the IFM study received 2 cycles of consolidation with 
lenalidomide before starting maintenance. In addition, the IFM trial limited maintenance 
to approximately 24 months based on concerns regarding second malignancies and did

Millennium # X16009 
                       MCCC Add 13 
Protocol Version Date:    February 23, 2021  
not allow cross over. However, the CALGB trial allowed cross over from placebo arm to 
lenalidomide maintenance based on interim analysis and also allowed maintenance until progression. 
 
Very few trials have explored the role of maintenance therapy outside of the context of 
SCT prior to the advent of the new drugs. Thr ee large recent trials have explored the role 
of maintenance therapy in the older patien t population following a defined period of 
initial therapy with 3 or 4 drug combinations. In a recent multicenter phase 3 study (MM-015), Palumbo et al have evaluated the saf ety and efficacy of continuous lenalidomide
 
treatment after MPR (MPR-R; n=152) versus MP (n=154) or MPR (n=153) in 459 newly 
diagnosed transplant ineligible MM patients who were >= 65 years of age.27 The 
treatment schema consisted of melphalan 0.18  mg/kg on days 1-4, prednisone 2 mg/kg on 
days 1-4, with (MPR or MPR-R) or without (MP) lenalidomide 10 mg/day on days 1-21 
for nine 28-day cycles. Following 9 cycles of MPR, patients received maintenance 
lenalidomide (10 mg/day on days 1-21) (MPR-R) or placebo (MPR) until progression; MP patients also received placebo until progression. After a median follow-up of 21 
months, MPR-R compared with MP resulted in a higher overall RR (77% vs. 50%, p < 
.001) and higher rates of
 CR (16% vs. 4%, p < .001). In addition, MPR-R reduced the risk 
of disease progression by 58% compared with MP (HR =0.423, p < .001) and resulted in a 
higher 2-year PFS rate (55% vs. 16%). Adverse events associated with MPR-R and MP 
resulted in treatment discontinuation in 20% and 8% patients, respectively. In another 
trial, patients receiving initial therapy with  bortezomib, thalidomide, melphalan and 
prednisone were continued on maintenance w ith bortezomib and thalidomide, resulting in 
superior PFS compared to the control group of patients receiving VMP.28 Finally, a 
Spanish trial randomized patients to initial therapy with VMP or VTP and then 
randomized all patients at the end of therapy to maintenance with VT or VP and showed an improved PFS in patients getting VT maintena nce. In all these trials patients assigned 
to receive maintenance therapy with an IMiD or bortezomib + IMiD combination appeared to have improvements in the de pth of response and better progression-free 
survival.
29  
 
However, significant questions remain as to  the duration of maintenance therapy with 
different trials sporting different designs in terms of duration of therapy. Given the data 
showing that the rate of second malignanc ies may be higher after 24 months of 
maintenance, and the cost and side effects of  maintenance, it has been suggested that two 
years of lenalidomide maintenance is sufficie nt, and the current IFM/DFCI trial has been 
amended to limit maintenance duration to two years.25 But the major improvement in OS 
seen with lenalidomide maintenance was with therapy until progression. Hence, the issue 
of optimal duration of maintenance is pressing.  
 
1.9   Rationale for the current trial:  Ixazomib is a second-generation proteasome inhibitor, 
with excellent oral bioavailability, that is  currently in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials.30 The 
preliminary data from the phase 1 trials and the expansion cohorts at MTD, using single 
agent MLN 9708, demonstrates excellent tolerability and early evidence of efficacy.31,32 
In combination with lenalidomide in the setting of newly diagnosed myeloma, the combination has shown very high response ra tes and deep responses. Given these results, 
it is only logical to evaluate the effica cy of cyclophosphamide and Ixazomib with 
dexamethasone in the context of newly diagnosed disease. The results of this phase 2 can 
be compared with the historical controls form similar studies that have looked at Rd, 
VRd, and VCd, to give us an estimate of the comparative efficacy. We hypothesize that 
this fully oral regimen will have significant activity in this setting and will provide for a

convenient schedule. In addition, given th e clinical efficacy seen with bortezomib, 
cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone, we hypothesize that the combination of 
Ixazomib, cyclophosphamide and dexameth asone, will be active in light chain 
amyloidosis.

*The study drug should be taken on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or at least 2 hours 
food.  Each capsule should be swallowed separately with a sip of water.  A total of approximately 
240 mL of water should be taken with the capsules 
** Treatment will continue till disease progression, un acceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, 
or if patient and/or physician prefer to discontinue therapy. 
 
 7.2 The doses of Ixazomib used in this st udy are based on data from Millennium’s ongoing 
phase 1 trials. In these trials the dose of Ixazomib was based on BSA. A population PK 
 41   
   MC1382 
Millennium # X16009 
  MCCC Add 12 
 
Protocol Version Date:    February 23, 2021  
analysis was performed for Ixazomib to assess the feasibility of switching from BSA-
based dosing to flat dosing. A population PK model was built using nonlinear mixed 
effects modeling in NONMEM VII software compiled with the Intel Fortran 9.2 
compiler. Data from both the twice-weekly and once-weekly IV dosing regimens were 
used in the analysis (N = 42). Population PK analysis showed that Ixazomib PK can be well described by a 3- compartment model w ith linear elimination. Race, sex, BSA, 
and/or body weight do not appear to signifi cantly affect clearance (CL) and volume of 
distribution (V1) in the central compartment.  Clearance and volume of distribution in the 
central compartment are the PK para meters that will affect AUC and C
max, respectively. 
CL and V1 are primary parameters that are i ndependent of the route of administration of 
drug. Therefore, BSA is not expected to affect C max or AUC after oral dosing, and thus 
flat dosing is appropriate for both oral and IV routes of administration.   
 7.3  Patients should be instructed to swallow Ixazomib capsules whole, with water, and not to 
break, chew, or open the capsules.  The study drug should be taken on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or at least  2 hours after food.  Each capsule should be swallowed separately with a sip of water.  A total of approximately 8 ounces (240 mL) of water should be taken with the capsules.   
 
The prescribed administration of Ixazomib doses in this study is the MTD of Millennium 
study C16004 weekly in a 28-day cycle.  Missed doses can be taken as soon as the patient remembers as long as the next scheduled dose is 72 hours or more away.  A double dose should not be taken to make up for a missed dose.  If the patient vomits after taking a 
dose, the patient should not repeat the dose but should resume dosing at the time of the next scheduled dose.  Drug will be administered only to eligib le patients under the supervision of the 
investigator or identified subinvestigator(s).  Patients may be treated on an outpatient basis, if possible.  The drug will be prepared under the superv ision of a pharmacist, or appropriately 
qualified and trained personnel. 
 
7.4 Cohort A:   
 For cohort A the patient must be evaluated at the consenting institution (Mayo Clinic)  as 
described in the Test Schedule (Section 4).  Treatment by a local medical doctor (LMD) is not allowed.   
  Cohort B (as of amendment 12) 
 For cohort B, the patient must return to the consenting institution for evaluation at least 
every third cycle, provided the drug can be sent to the patient and necessary interval 
evaluations as required by the protocol can be completed remotely or through local 
healthcare facilities 
 7.5 Patients are allowed to collect stem cells any time after 3 cycles of initial therapy. 
Therapy may be interrupted for up to 4 weeks for the purpose of stem cell collection. Stem cells can be collected using standard institutional protocols. Once stem cell

collection is completed, patients will initiate next cycle of therapy and continue as per 
protocol. Any delay beyond 4 weeks should be discussed with the study PI prior to 
reinitiating protocol therapy. Patients can  go off study treatment for stem cell 
transplantation any time after 6 cycles of ther apy. Patients who discontinue therapy for 
stem cell transplantation will go to event monitoring phase of the study and will not get any additional therapy with Ixazomib.

**Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea with maximal supportive treatment(s) 
will be considered dose limiting.  Fatigue  and mouth sores that are considered 
Grade 3 with an attribution of definitely, probably, or possibly related to treatment 
will be reviewed by the study team to de termine if they were due to other causes 
(i.e. disease progression or infection) or treatment.   If it is determined that the fatigue or mouth sores were due to othe r causes they would not be considered a 
DLT and if they were due to treatment they would be considered a DLT. 
 
 
8.0 Dosage Modification Based on Adverse Events  
 
Strictly follow the modifications in this table for the first two cycles, until individual treatment 
tolerance can be ascertained.  Individual drugs  can be dose reduced as per the table below 
depending on the adverse event attribution. Thereafter, these modifications should be regarded as guidelines to produce mild-to-moderate, but not debilitating, side effects.  If multiple adverse 
events are seen, administer dose based on greatest reduction required for any single adverse event observed.  Reductions apply to treatment given in the preceding cycle and are based on adverse events observed since the prior dose.

8.11  Instruction for initiation of a new cycle of therapy  
A new cycle of treatment may begin on the scheduled Day 1 of a new cycle if: 
• The ANC is ≥ 1000/μL 
• The platelet count is ≥  75,000/μL 
• Any other non-hematologic Ixazomib-related adverse event that may have 
occurred has resolved to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline severity . 
If these conditions are not met on Day 1 of a new cycle, dosing should be 
delayed for 1 week. At the end of th at time, the patient should be re-
evaluated to determine whether the cr iteria have been met. If the patient 
continues to fail to meet the above-cited criteria, delay therapy and continue 
to re-evaluate.   
If any drug dosing was halted during the previous cycle and was restarted 
with a one-level dose reduction without requiring an interruption for the remainder of the cycle, then that re duced dose level will be initiated on Day 1 
of the new cycle.  
If any drug dosing was omitted for the remainder of the previous cycle or if 
the new cycle is held due to known hematologic toxicity newly encountered 
on the scheduled Day 1, then the new cycle will be started with a one-level dose reduction.  If a new cycle of therapy cannot be restarted within 4 weeks of the scheduled Day 1 due to non-reso lution of drug related toxicities, the 
patient will be removed from protocol therapy and will go to event 
monitoring.

days  prior to study drug dosing for any dosing day 
9.4 Nausea and/or Vomiting 
 
Standard anti-emetics including 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 serotonin receptor antagonists are recommended for emesis if it occurs once treat ment is initiated; prophylactic anti-emetics 
may also be considered at the physician’ s discretion. Dexamethasone should not be 
administered as an anti-emetic. Fluid deficit should be corrected before initiation of study 
drug and during treatment. 
 
9.5 Granisetron should be given prior to Ixaz omib for prophylaxis. Additional antiemetics 
may be used at the discretion of the attendi ng physician. Dexamethasone should not be 
administered as an anti-emetic. Volume depleti on should be corrected before initiation of 
study drug. 
 
9.6 Blood products and growth factors should be utilized as clinically warranted and 
following institutional policies and recommendations.  The use of growth factors should 
follow published guidelines of the Journal of Clinical Oncology, Vol 24, No 18 (June 20), 2006: pp. 2932-2947 
 
9.7 Patients should receive full supportive care while on this study.  This includes blood 
product support, antibiotic treatment, and treatment of other newly diagnosed or 
concurrent medical conditions.  All blood products and concomitant medications such as antidiarrheals, analgesics, and/or antiem etics received from the first day of study 
treatment administration until 30 days afte r the final dose will be recorded in the 
medical records.  
9.8 Diarrhea:  This can be managed conserva tively with loperamide.  The recommended dose 
of loperamide is 4 mg at first onset, follo wed by 2 mg every 2-4 hours until diarrhea free 
(maximum 16 mg/day). 
 
In the event of Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, the following supportive measures are allowed:  hydration, octreotide, and antidiarrheals.   
 
If diarrhea is severe (requiring intravenous rehydr ation) and/or associated with fever or 
severe neutropenia (Grade 3 or 4), broad-spectrum antibiotics must be prescribed.  
Patients with severe diarrhea or any diarrhea associated with severe nausea or vomiting 
should be hospitalized  for intravenous hydration and correction of electrolyte

• Platelet transfusions to help patients meet eligibility criteria are not allowed within 3 days before study drug dosing. 
• Adjuvant hormone therapy for breast or prostate cancer. 
 
9.9d      Erythematous Rash With or Without Pruritus 
As with bortezomib, rash with or without pruritus has been reported with Ixazomib, 
primarily at the higher doses tested and when  given with agents where rash is an 
overlapping toxicity.  The rash may range from limited erythematous areas, macular and/or small papular bumps that may or may not be pruritic over a few areas of the body, 
to a more generalized eruption that is predominately on the trunk or extremities.  Rash has been most commonly characterized as maculopapular or macular.  To date, when it 
does occur, rash is most commonly reported with in the first 3 cycles of therapy.  The rash 
is often transient, self-limiting, and is typically Grade 1 to 2 in severity.  
Symptomatic measures such as antihistamines or  corticosteroids (oral or topical) have 
been successfully used to manage rash and have been used prophylac tically in subsequent 
cycles.  The use of a topical, IV, or oral steroid (eg, prednisone ≤ 10 mg per day or 
equivalent) is permitted.  Management of a Grade 3 rash may require intravenous 
antihistamines or corticosteroids.  Admini stration of Ixazomib (and/or other causative 
 52   
   MC1382 
Millennium # X16009 
  MCCC Add 12 
 
Protocol Version Date:    February 23, 2021  
agent if given in combination) should be modified per protocol and re-initiated at a 
reduced level from where rash was noted (also, per protocol).   
In line with clinical practice, dermatology consult and biopsy of Grade 3 or higher rash or 
any SAE involving rash is recommended.  Prophylactic measures should also be 
considered if a patient has previously developed a rash (eg, using a thick, alcohol-free emollient cream on dry areas of the body or oral or topical antihistamines).  A rare risk is 
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, a severe and potentially life-threatening rash with skin peeling and mouth sores, which should be  managed symptomatically according to 
standard medical practice.  Punch biopsies fo r histopathological analysis are encouraged 
at the discretion of the investigator. 
 9.9e Thrombocytopenia  
Thrombocytopenia has been reported to date primarily at the higher doses tested.  Blood 
counts should be monitored regularly as outlined  in the protocol with additional testing 
obtained according to standard clinical prac tice.  Thrombocytopenia may be severe but 
has been manageable with platelet transfusi ons according to standard clinical practice. 
Thrombocytopenia nadirs commonly recover w ithout intervention by the beginning of the 
next scheduled cycle. Ixazomib administration should be modified as noted as per dose modification recommendations in Table 6-2 when thrombocytopenia occurs.  Therapy 
can be reinitiated at a reduced level upon rec overy of platelet counts. A rare risk is 
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a rare blood disorder where blood clots 
form in small blood vessels throughout the body characterized by thrombocytopenia, petechiae, fever, or possibly more serious  signs and symptoms. TTP should be managed 
symptomatically according to standard medical practice. 
 9.9f Neutropenia  
Neutropenia has been reported with Ixazo mib.  Blood counts should be monitored 
regularly as outlined in the protocol with  additional testing obtained according to 
standard clinical practice.  Neutropenia ma y be severe but has been manageable with 
G-CSF according to standard clinical practice.  Neutropenic nadirs commonly recover without intervention by the beginning of the next scheduled cycle or with a short delay in treatment.  Ixazomib administration should be modified when neutropenia occurs, as 
noted in the dose modification recommendations in Table 6-2.  Therapy can be reinitiated 
at a reduced level upon recovery of absolute neutrophil counts. 
 9.9g Fluid Deficits 
Dehydration should be avoided because Ixazomib may cause vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration.  Acute renal failure has been reported with Ixazomib.  Fluid deficits should 
be corrected before initiation of study dr ug and during treatment and as needed during 
therapy.  Until further information is available, intake of NSAIDs while on this protocol 
should be avoided.

 9.9h Hypotension  
Symptomatic hypotension and orthostatic  hypotension have been reported with 
IXAZOMIB. Blood pressure should be closely monitored while the patient is on study 
treatment and fluid deficit should be correct ed as needed, especially in the setting of 
concomitant symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or anorexia. Patients taking medications and/or diuretics to manage their blood pressure (for either hypo- or 
hypertension) should be managed according to  standard clinical practice, including 
considerations for dose adjustments of thei r concomitant medications during the course 
of the trial.  
  9.9i Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome  
One case of posterior reversible encephal opathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported 
with IXAZOMIB.  While this case ultimatel y resolved, PRES has also been reported 
rarely with another proteasome inhibitor, VELCADE.  PRES is characterized by headache, seizures and visual loss, as well as abrupt increase in blood pressure.  Prompt 
diagnosis and initiation of antihypertensive and anticonvulsant therapy are important to prevent irreversible  end-organ damage. 
9.9j Transverse Myelitis  
Transverse myelitis has also been reported with Ixazomib. It is not known if Ixazomib causes transverse myelitis; however, because it happened to a patient receiving Ixazomib, the possibility that Ixazomib may have contributed to transverse myelitis cannot be 
excluded.

as serious AE which is defined in the table in Section 10.4. 
 
10.2  Expected vs. Unexpected Events  
 
• The determination of whether an AE is  expected is based on agent-specific 
information provided in Section 15.0 of the protocol and the study specific 
consent form. 
 
• Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the agent-specific information 
provided in Section 15.0 of the protocol and the study specific consent form. 
 
NOTE : “Unexpected adverse experiences” means any adverse experience that is neither 
identified in nature, severity, or frequency of risk in the information provided for IRB 
review nor mentioned in the consent form.  
 
10.3 Assessment of Attribution  
 
When assessing whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or 
procedure, the following attri bution categories are utilized: 
Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the agent(s). 
Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the agent(s). 
Possible - The adverse event may be related to the agent(s). 
Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the agent(s). 
Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the agent(s). 
 
Events determined to be possibly, probably or definitely attributed to a medical treatment suggest there is evidence to indicate a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event .  
 
10.31   AEs Experienced Utilizing Investigational Agents and Commercial Agent(s) on 
the SAME Arm 
 
NOTE:   When a commercial agent(s) is (are) used on the same 
treatment arm as the investiga tional agent/intervention (also, 
investigational drug, biologic, cellular product, or other 
investigational therapy under an IND), the entire combination (arm) is then considered an investigati onal intervention for reporting. 
 Routine Reporting  
 
• Routine AE reporting for Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies using an 
investigational agent /intervention in combination with a commercial agent is stated in the protocol.  See Section 10.6.  
 
 56   
   MC1382 
Millennium # X16009 
  MCCC Add 12 
 
Protocol Version Date:    February 23, 2021  
• Routine AE reporting for Phase 3 clinical studies using an investigational 
agent/intervention and a commercial agent in combination must be 
reported as defined by the general guidelines provided by sponsors, 
Groups, Cancer Centers, or Principal Investigators. See Section 10.6.  
 
Expedited Reporting 
 
• An AE that occurs on a combination study must be assessed in accordance with the guidelines for investigational agents/interventions in Section 10.4, and where indicated, an expedited report must be submitted. 
 
• An AE that occurs prior to administration of the investigational 
agent/intervention must be assessed as sp ecified in the protocol. In general, 
only Grade 4 and 5 AEs that are unexpected with at least possible attribution to the commercial agent require an expedited report.  Refer to Section 10.4 for specific AE repor ting requirements or exceptions. 
 
• Commercial agent expedited reports must be submitted to the FDA via MedWatch 3500A. 
 
• An investigational agent/intervention might exacer bate the expected AEs 
associated with a commercial  agent.  Therefore, if an expected AE (for the 
commercial agent) occurs with a higher degree of severity, expedited reporting 
is required.  The clinical investigator must determine severity.  
 
10.4          Expedited Reporting Requirements for IND/IDE Agents

FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOU S ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312) 
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor ANY Serious Adverse Events, 
whether or not they are considered related to th e investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64) 
 An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death 
2) A life-threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization for ≥ 24 hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substa ntial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious wh en, based upon medical judgment, they may

serious AEs, the investigator must determ ine both the intensity of the event and the 
relationship of the event to study drug administration.  
 
AEs which are serious must be reported to Takeda Pharmacovigilance (or designee) from 
the first dose of study drug through 30 days after administration of the last dose of 
Ixazomib. Any SAE that occurs at any time after completion of Ixazomib treatment or after the designated follow-up period that the sponsor-investigator and/or sub-investigator 
considers to be related to any study drug must be reported to Takeda Pharmacovigilance 
(or designee). In addition, new primary ma lignancies that occur during the follow-up 
periods must be reported, regardless of cau sality to study regimen, for a minimum of 
three years after the last dose of the investig ational product, starting from the first dose of 
study drug. All new cases of primary ma lignancy must be reported to Takeda 
Pharmacovigilance (or designee). 
    
Planned hospital admissions or surgical pr ocedures for an illness or disease that existed 
before the patient was enrolled in the tria l are not to be considered AEs unless the 
condition deteriorated in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery was 
performed earlier or later than planned). All SAEs should be monitored until they are 
resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or 
intercurrent illness(es). 
  Since this is an investigator-initiated study,  the principal investigator, Shaji Kumar, MD, 
also referred to as the sponsor-investigator, is responsible for reporting serious adverse 
events (SAEs) to any regulatory agency and to the sponsor- investigator’s EC or IRB. 
  Regardless of expectedness or causality, all SA Es (including serious pretreatment events) 
must also be reported in English to Takeda Pharmacovigilance (or designee): 
  Fatal and Life Threatening SAEs within  24 hours of the sponsor-investigator’s 
observation or awareness of the event 
  All other serious (non-fatal/non-life-threateni ng) events within 4 calendar days of the 
sponsor-investigator’s observation or awareness of the event 
  See below for contact information for the reporting of SAEs to Takeda 
Pharmacovigilance. 
  The sponsor-investigator must fax or em ail the SAE Form per the timelines above. A 
sample of an SAE Form will be provided. 
    The SAE report must include at minimum: 
• Event term(s) • Serious criteria • Intensity of the event(s): Sponsor-investigator’s or sub-investigator’s determination. 
Intensity for each SAE, including any lab a bnormalities, will be determined by using

10.51 Persistent or Significant Disabilities/Incapacities 
 
Any AE that results in persistent or  significant incapacity or substantial 
disruption of the ability to conduct normal  life functions (formerly referred to as 
disabilities), congenital abnormities or birth defects, must be reported 
immediately if they occur at any time foll owing treatment with an agent under an 
IND/IDE since they are considered to be a serious AE and must be reported to 
the sponsor as specified in 21 CFR 312.64(b). 
10.52 Death 
Any death occurring within 30 days of the last dose, regardless of attribution to 
an agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within 24-hours. 
 
Any death occurring greater than 30 days with an attribution of possible, probable, or definite to an agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within 24-hours. 
 
Reportable categories of Death   
 
• Death attributable to a CTCAE term. 
• Death Neonatal:  A disorder characterized by cessation of life during the 
first 28 days of life.Death NOS:  A cessation of life that cannot be 
attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5. 
• Sudden death NOS:  A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be 
attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5. 
• Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 
“Neoplasms benigh, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) – Other (Progressive Disease)” under the system organ class (SOC) of the same name.  Evidence that the death was a manifestation of 
underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth 
or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should be submitted. 
• Any death occurring within 30 days of the last dose, regardless of 
attribution to the investigational agent/intervention requires expedited 
reporting within 24 hours. 
• Any death occurring greater than 30 days after the last does of the 
investigational agent/intervention requ ires expedited reporting within 24

10.53 Secondary Malignancy 
 
• A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with investig ational agent/intervention, radiation or 
chemotherapy).  A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the 
initial neoplasm. 
 
• All secondary malignancies that occur foll owing treatment with an agent under 
an IND/IDE be reported. Three options  are available to describe the event: 
 
o Leukemia secondary to oncology chem otherapy (e.g., Acute Myeloctyic 
Leukemia [AML]) 
 o Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 
 o Treatment-related secondary malignancy 
 
• Any malignancy possibly related to can cer treatment (including AML/MDS) 
should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each 
protocol.  
 
10.54 Second Malignancy 
 
• A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and 
is NOT a metastasis from the initial mali gnancy).  Second malignancies require 
ONLY routine reporting. 
 
10.55 Procedures for Reporting Drug Exposure During Pregnancy and Birth

 11.0 Treatment Evaluation  
Cohort A (Multiple Myleoma): The International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform response criteria (Rajkumar et al, 2011) will be used to assess response to therapy  
11.1  Terms and definitions 
 
• M-protein: synonyms include M-spike, monoclonal protein and myeloma protein, 
paraprotein, M-component. 
 
Serum M-protein level is quantitated using densitometry on SPEP except in cases where the SPEP is felt to be unreliable.   
• M-proteins migrating in the β-region (usually IgA M-proteins)  
• Cases in which the M-protein is so  large and narrow on agarose (some 
specimens >4 g/dL) that they underestimate the actual immunoglobulin level (by greater than 1500 mg/dL) due to technical staining properties of the agarose gel. 
• Cases in which there are multiple peak s of same M-protein (aggregates or 
dimers) 
 If SPEP is not available or felt to be unr eliable (above examples) for routine M-
protein quantitation, then quantitative immunoglobulin levels derived from nephelometry or turbidometry can be accepte d.  However, this must be explicitly 
reported at baseline, and only nephelometr y can be used for that patient to assess 
response. SPEP derived M-protein valu es and quantitative nephelometric 
immunoglobulin values cannot be used interchangeably.   
 
Urine M-protein measurement is estimated using 24-h UPEP only.  Random or 24 h urine tests measuring kappa and lambda light chain levels are not reliable and are not 
recommended. 
 
 FLC estimation is currently carried out using the serum FLC assay (Freelite, The 
Binding Site Limited, UK).  Patients with kappa/lambda FLC ratio <0.26 are defined 
as having monoclonal lambda FLC and those with ratios >1.65 as having a 
 66   
   MC1382 
Millennium # X16009 
  MCCC Add 12 
 
Protocol Version Date:    February 23, 2021  
monoclonal kappa FLC.  The monoclonal li ght chain isotype is considered the 
involved FLC isotype, and the opposite light chain type as the uninvolved FLC type.  
 
• Response terms:  The following response terms will be used: stringent Complete 
Response (sCR), complete response (CR), ve ry good partial response (VGPR), partial 
response (PR), Minimal Response (MR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease 
(PD).  
 
In addition, for each response category, there will be an “unconfirmed” response 
category, which will be for internal use, for the purpose of guiding decision making and test ordering. These designations will app lied at the time of the first measurement 
at which the quantitative aspect of the response category has been satisfied without the confirmation step having been satis fied. The designation “u” will precede the 
standard abbreviations, and will include usCR, uCR, uVGPR, uPR, uMR, uPD.   
• Measurable disease: Patients who have a measurable serum or urine M-protein.  
 
o Serum M-protein ≥1 g/dl  
o Urine M-protein ≥  200 mg/24 h 
o Serum FLC assay: Involved FLC level ≥  10 mg/dl provided serum FLC ratio is 
abnormal 
o Bone marrow plasma cells ≥  30% 
 
The serum free light chain (FLC) assay is of particular use in monitoring response to 
therapy in patients who have oligo-secretory or non-secretory disease and should be used 
in assessing response only if the baseline serum and/or urine M proteins are not 
“measurable” as above, and the baseline le vel of the involved FLC is “measurable.”  
When using this assay, it is important to note th at the FLC levels vary considerably with 
changes in renal function and in patients with renal insufficiency, the levels of both the 
kappa and lambda may remain elevated, but the ratio normalizes with achievement of CR.  Thus, both the level of the involved and the uninvolved FLC isotype (i.e., the involved/uninvolved ratio or involved-uninvol ved difference) should be considered in 
assessing response.  Patients included on the study on the basis of FLC alone (i.e., no 
measurable serum/urine M-protein) should be the only ones who are evaluated using FLC response criteria.  The others should follow usual criteria and ignore FLC results 
with the exception of defining stringent complete response. 
 
• Evaluable disease : Patients who do not have a “measurable” serum M-protein, 
serum free light chain, or urine M-protein. 
 
• Oligosecretory myeloma:  Patient with multiple myeloma who has NEVER had 
“measurable” serum M-protein or urine M-protein, but has had a detectable M-
protein in his/her serum and/or urine and/or measurable serum free light chain.

1  SPEP, UPEP, Immunofixation studies of both serum and urine, and Bone marrow 
biopsy  are required to document CR regardless of registration values, and in addition 
FLC  measurement and bone marrow immunophenotyping  is required to document 
sCR.  SPEP and UPEP are required to document VGPR regardless of registration values. 
2  For serum measurable patients, 24 hour ur ine does not need to be confirmed (i.e. 
repeated after documented response) for any response category 
3  At a minimum, a bone marrow biopsy should be repeated every 3 months until 
documented response.  Bone marrow biopsy resu lts do not need to be repeated after 
documented response. 
4    If serum M-protein is being followed by quantitative immunoglobulin levels derived 
from nephelometry or turbidometry, qua ntitative immunoglobulins are required.  SPEP 
is only required to document CR or VGPR.  
 
11.3 Confirmed response  
 
In order to be classified as a hematologic response, confirmation of serum M- protein, serum immunoglobulin free light chain (whe n primary determinant of response) and 
urine M- protein (when primary determinant of response) results must be made by verification on two consecutive determinations.

• Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy are only required to document CR or sCR, 
except for patients with evaluable disease only, where a bone marrow is required 
to document all response categories including progression. However, a second 
confirmatory bone marrow is not required to confirm response in any case. 
• Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements; however, if radiographic studies were perfo rmed there should be no evidence of 
progressive or new bone lesions. 
 
Appropriate tests required to document and confirm response are listed in Table 11.2 
 
11.4 Bone progression  
 
Caution must be exercised to avoid rating progression on the basis of variation of radiologic technique alone.  Compression fracture does not exclude continued response and may not indicate progression.  When progr ession is based on skeletal disease alone, it 
should be discussed with the Study Chair befo re removing the patient from the study.

plasmacytoma 
• Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium > 
11.5mg/dL) that can be attributed solely to the PC proliferative disorder 
Stable Disease (SD) Not meeting criteria for sCR, CR, VGPR, PR, MR or PD 
 
a All response categories require two consecutive assessments (sCR, CR, VGPR, PR, MR, PD) made at any time 
before the institution of any new therapy; sCR, CR, VGPR, PR, MR and SD categories also require no known 
evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed. Radiographic studies are not 
required to satisfy these response requirements. Bone ma rrow assessments need not be confirmed. Each category, 
except for stable disease, will have a working subcategory of “unconfirmed” [prefix ‘u”] to designate first time point at which response category MAY have been achieved if confirmed. 
 
b CR patient will need to progress at the same level as VGPR and PR patients to be considered a PD.  A positive 
immunofixation alone is not sufficient. 
 
c If more than one M protein spike meets the criteria for m easurable disease at baseline, then both need to be 
followed for response.  Otherwise,  only follow the measurable M protein spike for response.   
 
d In patients in whom the only measurable disease is by serum FLC levels: CR in such patients indicates a normal 
FLC ratio of 0.26-1.65 in addition to the CR criteria listed above.

e Bone marrow criteria for PD are only to be used in patients without measurable disease by M protein and by FLC;  
 
f A "25% increase" refers to M protein, FLC and bone marrow results and does not refer to bone lesions, soft tissue 
plasmacytoma or hypercalcemia.  The lowest value does no t need to be a confirmed value.  If the lowest serum M-
protein is ≥ 5 g/dL, an increase in serum M-protein of ≥ 1 g/dL is sufficient to define disease progression. 
 
g In the case where a value is felt to be a spurious result per physician discretion (for example, a possible lab error), 
that value will not be considered when determining the lowest value. 
 
h Progressive disease should be confirmed.  However, treatment may be discontinued for progressive disease that is 
unconfirmed per physician discretion.  In this case, an objective status of PD should be entered on the measurement form and progressive disease should be reported on the event monitoring form.  
i Presence/absence of clonal cells is based upon the k/l ratio. An abnormal k/l ratio by immunohistochemistry 
requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis. An abnormal ratio reflec ting presence of an abnormal clone is 
k/l of 4:1 or 1:2.  
Cohort B (light chain amyloidosis)   – The Am yloidosis Consensus Criteria response criteria will be

11.6 Hematologic Response Considerations  
11.61 M-protein: synonyms include M-spike, monoclonal protein and myeloma 
protein, monoclonal paraprotein, M-component. 
 
Serum M-protein level is quantitated using densitometry on SPEP except in cases 
where the SPEP is felt to be unreliable.   
• M-proteins migrating in the β-region (usually IgA M-proteins)  
• Cases in which the M-spike is so large and narrow on agarose (some specimens >4 g/dL) that they underestimate the actual immunoglobulin level (by greater than 1500 mg/dL) due to technical staining properties of the agarose gel. 
 
If SPEP is not available or felt to be unr eliable (above examples) for routine M-
protein quantitation, then quantitative immunoglobulin levels derived from nephelometry or turbidometry can be accepte d.  However, this must be explicitly 
reported at baseline, and only nephelometr y can be used for that patient to assess 
response. SPEP derived M-spike values and quantitative nephelometric immunoglobulin values cannot be used interchangeably.   
 
Urine M-protein measurement is estimated using 24-h UPEP only.  Random or 24 h urine tests measuring kappa and lam bda light chain levels are not reliable

and are not recommended. 
 
FLC estimation is currently carried out using the serum FLC assay (Freelite, The 
Binding Site Limited, UK).  Patients w ith kappa/lambda FLC ratio <0.26 are 
defined as having monoclonal lambda FLC and those with ratios >1.65 as having 
a monoclonal kappa FLC.  The monoclonal li ght chain isotype is considered the 
involved FLC isotype, and the opposite light chain type as the uninvolved FLC 
type. 
 
11.62 Response terms:  The following response terms will be used: stringent Complete 
Response (sCR), amyloid complete resp onse (ACR), very good partial response 
(VGPR), partial response (PR), minimal response (MR), stable disease or no 
response (SD), and progression or relapse (PD) and relapse from CR (RFCR). See Tables for definitions. 
 
In addition, for each response category, there will be an “unconfirmed” response 
category, which will be for internal use, for the purpose of guiding decision making and test ordering. These designations will applied at the time of the first 
measurement at which the quantitative asp ect of the response category has been 
satisfied without the confirmation step having been satisfied. The designation “u” 
will precede the standard abbreviations, and will include usCR, uACR, uVGPR, uPR, uMR, uPD. 
 
11.63 Measurable disease: Patients who have a measurable serum or urine monoclonal 
protein by any of these means.  
• serum M-protein is ≥ 1 g/dL  
• urine M-spike is ≥ 200 mg/24 hours  
•   dFLC 5 mg/dL provided the kappa to lambda free light chain ratio 
is abnormal (primary criteria for response) 
 
The serum free light chain (FLC) assay is the most important parameter of 
response assessment . When using this assay, it is important to note that the FLC 
levels vary considerably with changes in renal function and in patients with renal 
insufficiency, the levels of both the kappa and lambda may remain elevated, but the ratio normalizes with achievement of CR. Thus both the level of the involved and the uninvolved FLC isotype (i.e., the involved/uninvolved ratio or involved-uninvolved difference) should be c onsidered in assessing response.

Neuropathy (any of the following):  Type A. Reduction in the Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) by 10 points. The NIS is based on the neurologic 
examination, and the items 
provide a measure of severity of muscle weakness (scored as 0= normal, 1= 25%, 2= 50%, 3= 75% weak, 4= paralyzed); loss of deep tendon reflexes 
scored as normal (0), decreased 
(1), or absent (2) and sensory loss graded as normal (0), diminished (1), or absent (2).  
 
Type B. Improvement in the Type A. Increase in the Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) by 10 points.   
Type B. Worsening in the 
summated compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude by 2 mv. This value is derived from summated value of compound muscle 
action potential amplitudes of 
the tibial, peroneal and ulnar nerves from the nerve conduction studies.

advance of the planned shipment.  Provide the designated courier with the appropriate account number to be used, if applicable. 
• Samples should be shipped via overnight delivery only on Monday through Wednesday, excluding holidays. 
• Double-bag the frozen samples for each patient in bags that can withstand dry ice conditions. 
• Pack the frozen samples in sufficient quantity of dry ice in appropriate containers, to 
maintain a frozen state for at least 3 days. 
• Avoid direct contact between sample bags and dry ice by separating them with a dry 
ice resistant material (eg, newspaper). 
• For all biological samples, follow the Inte rnational Air Transport Association (IATA) 
regulations for shipment. 
• Ensure that the total package weight does not exceed 27.2 kg (60 pounds). 
• Label the package with the sponsor-i nvestigator name and study number. 
• Include a return address (which includes th e investigator’s name) on the outside of

 Ixazomib that is dispensed to the patie nt for take-home dosing should remain in 
the blister packaging until the point of use.  The investigative site is responsible 
for providing the medication to the patient in units that comprise the correct daily 
dose configurations.  Capsules should remain in the blisters until the point of use.  Ixazomib capsules must be administered as intact capsules and must not be opened or manipulated in any way.  Comprehensive instructions should be 
provided to the patient in order to ensure compliance with dosing procedures.  
Patients will be instructed to store the medication in the refrigerator until the time 
of use. Reconciliation will occur accordingl y when the patient returns for their 
next cycle of therapy. Any extremes in temperature should be reported as an 
excursion and will be managed on a case by case basis.  Returned unused 
capsules should be discarded in a proper biohazard container. 
 
Ixazomib is an anticancer drug. As with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be exercised when handling Ixazomib.  It is recommended to wear gloves and protective garments during pr eparation when dispensed in clinic. 
Please refer to published guidelines regardi ng the proper handling and disposal of 
anticancer agents. 
 
15.14 Administration:   Ixazomib capsules must be admi nistered as intact capsules and 
are not intended to be opened or manipulated in any way.  Capsules should be taken on an empty stomach with approximately  8 oz (1 cup) of water (no food for 
2 hours before and for 1 hour after dosing). 
  Ixazomib should not be taken if the patient  has had a serious allergic reaction to 
boron or boron containing products 
 
15.15 Pharmacokinetic information :  a) Absorption:  After oral dosing, ixazomib is 
rapidly absorbed with a median T
max of 1 hour.  The lack of a discernible 
relationship between BSA and ixazomib clearance over a relatively wide BSA range (1.4-2.6 m
2) indicates that total systemic exposure (AUC) following fixed 
dosing should be independent of the indi vidual patient’s BSA.  A high-fat meal 
decreased both the rate and extent of ab sorption.  Therefore, ixazomib should be 
administered on an empty stomach.   
b) Distribution: The steady state volume of distribution is large and is estimated 
to be 543 L. Ixazomib is 88-94% protein bound. c) Metabolism:  Metabolism is the primary route for elimination of ixazomib by both CYP and non-CYP enzymes. CYP3A4 and 1A2 comprise the major CYP isozymes that contribute to ixazomib metabolism. d) Excretion: The mean terminal half-lif e is 9.5 days.  Renal elimination is a 
minor clearance pathway for ixazomib.  Dosing adjustment is not required in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment in studies. However, in a 
dedicated renal impairment study (C1 6015), unbound AUC0-last was 38% higher 
in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis as compared to patients with 
normal renal function.  Accordingly, a reduced starting dose of ixazomib is 
recommended in patients with severe renal impairment and ESRD requiring 
dialysis.  Unbound systemic exposures of ixazomib are 27% higher in patients 
 86   
   MC1382 
Millennium # X16009 
  MCCC Add 12 
 
Protocol Version Date:    February 23, 2021  
with moderate or severe hepatic impairme nt as compared to patients with normal 
hepatic function.  A reduced starting dose of ixazomib is recommended for 
patients with moderate or severe hepatic  impairment. 
 
     
15.16 Potential Drug Interactions :  The PK of Ixazomib was similar with and without 
coadministration of clarithromycin, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, and therefore no 
dose adjustment is necessary when Ixazomib is administered with CYP3A 
inhibitors. In the population PK analysis, coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors did not affect Ixazomib clearance. Thus, no dose adjustment is required for patients receiving strong CYP1A2 inhi bitors. In a clinical rifampin DDI 
study, Ixazomib Cmax and AUC0-last were reduced in the presence of rifampin by approximately 54% and 74%, respectively. As a result, the coadministration 
of strong CYP3A inducers with Ixazomib should be avoided.  Ixazomib is neither 
a time-dependent nor reversible inhibito r of CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 
2D6, or 3A4/5, therefore the potential for Ixazomib to produce DDIs via CYP isozyme inhibition is low.  Ixazomib did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4/5 activity.  The potential for Ixazomib to cause DDIs with substrates or 
inhibitors of P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, MATE-1, MATE2-K, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, 
and OATPs is low. 
 
Pharmacokinetic parameters for Ixazomib coadministered with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (LenDex) are similar to those observed when Ixazomib is 
administered as a single agent. This sugg ests that there is no readily apparent 
effect of coadministration of LenDex on the clinical PK of Ixazomib. 
 
Ixazomib should not be taken if the patient  has had a serious allergic reaction to 
boron or boron containing products.

Overdose – There is no known specific antidote for Ixazomib overdose.  In 
the event of an overdose in blinded studies, study medication assignment should be unblinded immediately.  Th e clinician should consider admitting 
the patient to the hospital for IV hydration, monitoring for adverse drug reactions, monitoring of vital signs , and appropriate supportive care.  
Gavage may be considered, but it s hould be kept in mind that Ixazomib 
absorption is rapid.  Ixazomib is not readily dialyzable.

16.0  Statistical Considerations and Methodology  
 16.1 Overview:  This is a phase I/II study of a novel regimen of Ixazomib with 
cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone for treatme nt in two cohorts of patients:   initial 
treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients requiring therapy (cohort A) and 
treatment of light chain amyloidosis (cohort B).  The phase I study is designed to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD ) and toxicity profile of Ixazomib in 
combination with cyclophosphamide and de xamethasone in patients with previously 
 93   
   MC1382 
Millennium # X16009 
  MCCC Add 12 
 
Protocol Version Date:    February 23, 2021  
untreated multiple myeloma using the standard cohort 3+3 design. The phase II portion is 
designed to assess the complete plus very good partial response rate associated with 
therapy with Ixazomib in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone, in 
patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma using a single stage phase II study 
design  (cohort A).  As of Addendum 9, a second single stage phase II study design is being added to assess the hematologic response rate of this regimen in patients with light chain amyloidosis (cohort B).    
 
16.11 Endpoint: The primary endpoint of the phase I portion of this trial is to assess the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  For cohort A of the phase II portion of this trial, the primary endpoint is the rate of  complete or very good partial response.  
A success will be defined as a an sCR,a, CR or VGPR noted as the objective status on two consecutive evaluations. For cohort B of the phase II portion, the primary endpoint is the rate of hematol ogic response.   A success will be defined 
as an sCR, ACR, VGPR, or PR noted as the objective status on two consecutive 
evaluations.  Response will be evaluated using the first 12 cycles (induction therapy).  Throughout Section 16.0, sCR, CR, or VGPR (cohort A) or sCR, ACR, VGPR, or PR (cohort B) will be consid ered synonymous with “success” in the 
phase II portion, unless specified otherwise.    
 16.12 Sample Size:  The phase I portion of this study is expected to require a minimum 
of 6 and a maximum of 12 evaluable patients.  The 6 patients treated at the MTD in the phase I portion will also be included in the phase II portion.  A maximum of 35 additional evaluable patients will be accrued at the MTD dose level for a 
maximum of 41 evaluable patients in the phase II portion of this study. We anticipate accruing up to 4 additional pa tients (1 phase I, 3 phase II) to account 
for ineligibility, cancellation, major treatment violation, or other reasons. Therefore, a maximum of 13 patients will be accrued in the phase I portion and a maximum of 38 patients will be accrued to the phase II portion for an overall maximum of 51 patients for the entire study. 
 
As of Addendum 9, 51 patients have been accrued to cohort A and cohort B is being added to the phase II portion of this study.  A maximum of 33 evaluable patients will be accrued to cohort B.  We  anticipate accruing up to 3 additional 
patients to account for ineligibility, cancellation, major treatment violation, or 
other reasons in cohort B. Therefore, a maximum of 36 patients will be accrued 
to cohort B for an overall maximum of 87 patients for the entire study. 
 16.13 Accrual Rate and Study Duration:  The anticipated accrual rate is 3-4 evaluable 
multiple myeloma patients per month.  At this rate, it will likely take about 2.5 
months to enroll, treat, and evaluate ea ch cohort in the phase I portion of this 
study.  The phase I portion is expected to take between 5 and 10 months.  The phase II portion of this study will accrue in the subsequent 1 year.  The maximum total study duration is expected to be approximately 3 years, or until the last patient accrued has been observed for at least 12 months.   
 
As of Addendum 9,    it is anticipated that the accrual rate in cohort B is 3-4 
evaluable light chain amyloidosis patients per month.  It is anticipated that cohort B will accrue in approximately 12 months. The maximum total study duration is 
 94

  MCCC Add 12 
 
Protocol Version Date:    February 23, 2021  
expected to be approximately 2 years af ter Addendum 8 is activated, or until the 
last patient accrued has been observed for at least 12 months.   
  
 
Phase I Portion  
 
16.2 Study Design:  The phase I study is designe d to determine the maximally tolerated dose 
(MTD) and toxicity profile of Ixazomib in  combination with cyclophosphamide and 
dexamethasone in patients with previous ly untreated multiple myeloma using the 
standard cohort 3+3 design. Three patients will be treated at each dose level and observed for a minimum of four weeks (i.e. one full cycle) before new patients are treated.  Doses will not be escalated in any individual patient. 
 
16.21  MTD Definition: MTD is defined as the dose level below the lowest dose that 
induces dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in at least one-third of patients (at least 2 of a maximum of 6 new patients). A total of 6 patients treated at the MTD will be sufficient to identify common toxic ities at the MTD. For instance, those 
toxicities with an incidence of at least  25% will be observe d with a probability 
of at least 82% (1-(1-0.25)
6). 
 
Refer to Section 7.52 for definition of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). 
 16.22 MTD Determination: 
 
Dose Escalation:  The phase I portion of this study will utilize a standard cohort 
of three design.   The dose levels to which patients will be assigned in sequential cohorts are described in Section 7.51.   The first cohort of three patients will be 
treated at dose level 0.  Decisions on when and how to dose escalate are described below. 
 
16.221  Three patients will be treated at a given dose level combination and 
observed for 1 cycle to assess toxicity.  
 
16.222  If DLT is not seen in any of the 3 patients, 3 new patients will be 
accrued and treated at the next higher dose level. If DLT is seen in 2 or 
3 of 3 patients treated at a given dose level, then the next 3 patients 
will be treated at the next lower dose level, if only 3 patients were enrolled and treated at this lower dose level.  
 16.223  If DLT is seen in 1 of 3 patients treated at a given dose level, up to 3 
additional patients will be enrolled and treated at the same dose level. 
If DLT is seen in at least one of these additional three patients ( ≥2 of 
6), the MTD will have been exceeded  and further accrual will cease to 
this cohort. If dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is not seen in any of the 
three additional patients, 3 new patients will be accrued and treated at the next higher dose level.  
 16.224  After enrolling 6 patients on a specific dose level, if DLT is observed 
in at least 2 of 6 patients, then the MTD will have been exceeded and 
 95   
   MC1382 
Millennium # X16009 
  MCCC Add 12 
 
Protocol Version Date:    February 23, 2021  
defined as the previous dose unless only 3 patients were treated at the 
lower dose level. In that case, 3 additional patients will be treated at this lower dose level such that a total of 6 patients are treated at the 
MTD to more fully assess the toxicities associated with the MTD. 
 
16.225  Dose de-escalation: If dose-limiting toxicity meets the stopping 
boundaries set by the above dose escalation algorithm at dose level 0 (for example, more than 1 out of 3 patients or more than 1 out of 6 
patients), the next cohort of three patients will be entered at a dose 
level of -1. If dose level -1 meets the stopping boundaries, the next cohort of three patients will be entered at dose level -2.  Further dose re-escalation will depend on the toxi city profile observed at these dose 
levels, and re-evaluation of the re gimen by the study team may be 
done. 
 16.226  If a patient fails to complete the first cycle of treatment for reasons 
other than toxicity, the patient will be regarded as inevaluable and will be replaced.    
 
16.227  Operating Characteristics for standard cohort of 3 design: The following 
table gives the probability of dose escalation at a single dose level as a function of the true probability of DLT at that level using the cohorts of 3 design described above. 
 
True Rate 
of DLT (%)
  
Probability of Dose Escalation  
10 0.91  
20 0.71  
30 0.49  
40 0.31  
50 0.17  
 
 
 
16.23 Analysis Plans: All the relevant results pertaining to toxicity, MTD, response, 
timed endpoints and laboratory correlates will be examined in an exploratory 
and hypothesis-generating fashion. The sm all sample size and the heterogeneous 
patient population associated with phase I studies restricts the generalizability of 
the results. Any notable statistical result should only be viewed as preliminary 
evidence for further study in Phase II trials rather than a definitive finding in and of itself. 
 
16.231  Adverse Events Profile 
 
The number and severity of all adverse events (overall and by dose-level) will be tabulated and summarized  in this patient population. The 
Grade 3+ adverse events will also be described and summarized in a 
 96   
   MC1382 
Millennium # X16009 
  MCCC Add 12 
 
Protocol Version Date:    February 23, 2021  
similar fashion. This will provide an indication of the level of tolerance 
for this treatment combination in this patient group.  
 
16.232  Toxicity Profile 
 
The term toxicity is defined as adverse events that are classified as either possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment.  Non-hematologic toxicities will be evaluated via the ordinal CTC standard 
toxicity grading. Hematologic toxicity measures of thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia, and leukopenia will be assessed using continuous variables 
as the outcome measures (primarily nadir) as well as categorization via CTC standard toxicity grading.   Overall toxicity incidence as well as toxicity profiles by dose level, 
patient and tumor site will be e xplored and summarized. Frequency 
distributions, graphical techniques and other descriptive measures will 
form the basis of these analyses.  
  
16.233  Response Profile   
 
A response is defined to be a CR, VGPR, or PR noted as the objective status.  Response will be evaluated using all cycles of treatment.  All patients meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a consent form 
and have begun treatment will be evaluable for response.  
 
Responses will be summarized by simple descriptive summary statistics 
delineating complete and partial responses as well as stable and progressive disease in this patient population.  
 
Phase II Portion  
 
16.3  Statistical Design:    
Cohort A (multiple myeloma): 
 
16.31 Decision Rule:    
A combination of lenalidomide plus dexa methasone, an oral regimen, is the 
mainstay therapy for newly diagnosed mu ltiple myeloma.  In a large multi-center 
study, 208 patients were evaluated for response to treatment with lenalidomide plus low dose dexamethasone.
8  Eighty-four patients (40%) achieved a complete 
or very good partial response.  Ixazomi b in combination with cyclophosphamide 
and dexamethasone is anothe r fully oral regimen.  An increase in the rate of 
complete plus very good partial res ponse compared to lenalidomide plus 
dexamethasone would be of interest.    
 
The largest success proportion where the proposed treatment regimen would be considered ineffective in this popul ation is 40%, and the smallest success 
 97   
   MC1382 
Millennium # X16009 
  MCCC Add 12 
 
Protocol Version Date:    February 23, 2021  
proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the proposed regimen in 
this patient population is 60%. The following one-stage binomial design requires 
41 evaluable patients (35 from phase II and 6 from the MTD portion of phase I) 
to test the null hypothesis that the true success proportion in this patient 
population is at most 40%.  
 
 16.311 Final Decision Rule:  If 20 or fewer successes are observed in the first 
41 evaluable patients, we will consider this regimen ineffective in this patient population. Otherwise, if the number of successes is at least 21, 
this will be considered evidence of promising activity and the treatment may be recommended for further testing in subsequent studies.    
16.312 Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, 
the additional patients will not be used  to evaluate the stopping rule or 
used in any decision making process.  Analyses involving over accrued patients are discussed in Section 16.44. 
 
16.32 Power and Significance Level:  Assuming that the number of successes is 
binomially distributed, the significance level is .10, i.e. there is a 10% chance of finding the drug to be effective when it truly is not.  The probability of declaring that this regimen warrants further st udy (i.e. statistical power) under various 
success proportions can be tabulated as a function of the true success proportion 
as shown in the following table. 
 
If the true success proportion is... 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 
Then the probability of declaring that the regimen warrants further 
study is… 0.10 0.26 0.50 0.74 0.90 
 
16.33 Other considerations:  Adverse events, quality/duration of response, and patterns 
of treatment failure observed in this study, as well as scientific discoveries or 
changes in standard care will be taken in to account in any decision to terminate 
the study.  
 
Cohort B (light chain amyloidosis):  
16.34  Decision Rule:    
The largest success proportion where the proposed treatment regimen would be considered ineffective in this popul ation is 30%, and the smallest success 
proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the proposed regimen in 
this patient population is 50%. The following one-stage binomial design requires 33 evaluable patients to test the null hypothesis that the true success proportion in this patient population is at most 30%.  
 
16.341 Final Decision Rule:  If 13 or fewer successes are observed in the first 
33 evaluable patients, we will consider this regimen ineffective in this patient population. Otherwise, if the number of successes is at least 14, 
 98   
   MC1382 
Millennium # X16009 
  MCCC Add 12 
 
Protocol Version Date:    February 23, 2021  
this will be considered evidence of promising activity and the 
treatment may be recommended for further testing in subsequent studies.    
 16.342 Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, 
the additional patients will not be used  to evaluate the stopping rule or 
used in any decision making process.  Analyses involving over accrued patients are discussed in Section 16.44. 
 
16.35 Power and Significance Level:  Assuming that the number of successes is 
binomially distributed, the significance level is .09, i.e. there is a 9% chance of finding the drug to be effective when it truly is not.  The probability of declaring that this regimen warrants further st udy (i.e. statistical power) under various 
success proportions can be tabulated as a function of the true success proportion 
as shown in the following table. 
 
If the true success proportion is... 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 
Then the probability of declaring that the regimen warrants further study is… 0.09 0.24 0.45 0.68 0.85 
 
16.36 Other considerations:  Adverse events, quality/duration of response, and patterns 
of treatment failure observed in this study, as well as scientific discoveries or changes in standard care will be taken in to account in any decision to terminate 
the study. 
 
 
16.4 Analysis Plan  
16.41 Primary Outcome Analyses: 
 
16.411 Definition:  For cohort A, the   primary endpoint in the phase II portion 
of this trial is the proportion of complete plus very good partial responses.  A success is defined as a  sCR, CR or VGPR noted as the 
objective status on two consecutive evaluations.  For cohort B of the 
phase II portion, the primary endpoint is the rate of hematologic 
response.   A success will be defined as an sCR, ACR, VGPR, or PR      noted as the objective status on two consecutive evaluations.  Response will be evaluated using the first 12 cycles (induction therapy). All patients meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a consent form and have begun treatment will be evaluable for response. 
 
16.412 Estimation:  In each cohort independently, the proportion of successes 
will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number 
of evaluable patients. Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true success proportions will be calculated. 
 
16.42 Secondary Outcome Analyses (to be evaluated in each cohort independently) 
 
 99   
   MC1382 
Millennium # X16009 
  MCCC Add 12 
 
Protocol Version Date:    February 23, 2021  
16.421 Survival time is defined as the time from registration to death due to any 
cause. The distribution of survival time will be estimated using the 
method of Kaplan-Meier33.  
 16.422    Progression-free survival is defined as the time from registration to the 
earliest date of documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause. The distribution of progression-free survival will be 
estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier 
 16.423 Adverse Events:  All eligible patient s that have initiated treatment will be 
considered evaluable for assessing adverse event rate(s).  The maximum grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient, 
and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine patterns.  Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study 
treatment will be taken into consideration. 
 
16.424 Cohort B only:  For each disease site (heart, renal, liver, neuropathy), the 
organ response rate will be estimated by the total number of patients who 
have an organ response divided by th e total number of evaluable patients 
who had involvement in that organ at baseline.  Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true organ response rates will be calculated.   
 
16.43   Correlative Analyses  
16.431  Cohort A only:  Individual and m ean plasma concentration data will be 
plotted over time. A summary table will be presented for the plasma concentration data. PK parameters will be estimated using noncompartmental analysis methods . The plasma PK parameters 
calculated for individual plasma Ix azomib concentration-time data will 
include, but are not limited to: Cmax , Tmax, and AUC. PK parameters 
will be summarized using descriptive statistics. 
 16.432 The FACT/GOG neurotoxicity questionnaire will be completed by 
patients at baseline, after each cycle for the first 4 cycles, and then every 
three cycles.  Patients will be evaluated by overall score at each time 
point and changes over time will be calculated.  These measures will be 
correlated with outcome using Fisher’s exact test and Kaplan-Meier methods where appropriate. 
 
16.44 Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the 
additional patients will not be used to ev aluate the stopping rule or used in any 
decision making processes; however, they will be included in final endpoint estimates and confidence intervals. 
 
16.5 Data & Safety Monitoring: 
 
16.51 The principle investigator(s) and the study statistician will review the study at 
least twice a year to identify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint problems 
that might be developing. The Mayo Clin ic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety 
 100   
   MC1382 
Millennium # X16009 
  MCCC Add 12 
 
Protocol Version Date:    February 23, 2021  
Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible  for reviewing accrual and safety data 
for this trial at least twice a year, based on reports provided by the MCCC 
Statistical Office. 
 
16.52 Adverse Event Stopping Rules (includes all phase II patients, including phase I 
patients treated at the MTD to be evaluated in each phase II cohort separately):   The stopping rules specified below are b ased on the knowledge available at study 
development.  We note that the Adverse Event Stopping Rule may be adjusted in 
the event of either (1) the study re-ope ning to accrual or (2) at any time during 
the conduct of the trial and in consid eration of newly acquired information 
regarding the adverse event profile of th e treatment(s) under investigation.  The 
study team may choose to suspend accrua l because of unexpected adverse event 
profiles that have not crossed the specified rule below. 
 
Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we observe 
events considered at least possibly rela ted to study treatment (i.e. an adverse 
event with attribute specified as  “possi ble,” “probable,” or “definite”) that 
satisfy one of the following: 
 
• if 5 or more patients in the first 15 treated patients experience a grade 4 or higher non-hematologic adverse event at  least possibly related to treatment. 
 
• if after the first 15 patients have been treated, 40% of all patients experience a grade 4 or higher non-hematologic adverse event at least possibly related to treatment.  
 
We note that we will review grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed “unrelated” or “unlikely to be related”, to verify their attribution and to monitor the emergence of a previously unrecognized treatment-related adverse event.  
16.6   Results Reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov: At study activation, this study will have been 
registered within the “ClincialTrails.gov” website. The Primary and Secondary Endpoints 
along with other required information for this study will be reported on www.ClinicalTrials.gov. For purposes of timing of the Results Reporting, the initial 
estimated completion date for the Primary Endpoi nt of this study is 2 years after the study 
opens to accrual to cohort B. The definition of “Primary Endpoint Completion Date” (PECD) for this study is at the time the last  patient registered has been followed for at 
least 12 months. 
 16.7 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
16.71 This study will be available to all eligib le patients, regardless of race, gender, or 
ethnic origin. 
 
16.72 There is no information currently availa ble regarding differential effects of this 
regimen in subsets defined by race, gender , or ethnicity, and there is no reason to 
expect such differences to exist. Theref ore, although the planned analysis will, as 
always, look for differences in treatment effect based on racial and gender

groupings, the sample size is not increased in order to provide additional power 
for subset analyses. 
 
16.73 The geographical region served by MCCC has a population which includes 
approximately 3% minorities.  Based on prior MCCC studies involving similar 
disease sites, we expect about 3-5% of patients will be classified as minorities by race and about 33% of patients will be women. Expected sizes of racial by gender subsets are shown in the following table:

1 1. Introduction  
1.1 The treatment for patients with resectable rectal cancer is evolving in the United States and 
Canada. Surgeons have increasingly offered patients preoperative combined 5- FU based 
chemotherapy and radiation to down- stage a patient prior to surgery, increase the possibility of a 
sphincter -sparing surgery, and to reduce combined modality toxicity by removing irradiated tissue 
at the time of resection.  
Many patients, however, continue to receive surgery as their initial treatment intervention and are candidates for postoperative combined modality therapy.  Although there have been a number of trials using preoperative combined modality therapy, particularly in Europe, few have been randomized and few have used conventional radiation doses.  The NSABP (R03) and the Gastrointestinal Intergroup (INT0147) each designed a randomized trial of preoperative versus 
postoperative combined modality therapy for resectable rectal cancer in an effort to employ 
conventional radiation dosing, to determine whether preoperative chemotherapy and radiation improves disease- free and overall survival compared to postoperative therapy, and to evaluate 
local recurrence rates, sphincter preservation, down staging, and quality of life.  Unfortunately, both trials were terminated prior to completion because of inadequate patient accrual.  The 
NSABP has reported on the status of the 267 patients randomized with data one year after 
randomization, suggesting similar disease- free survival (83% versus 78%, p=0.29) with similar 
postoperative complications, although a larger proportion of preoperative patients had sphi ncter -
saving surgery (1).  Grade 4- 5 toxicity was greater in the preoperative arm (34% versus 23%, 
p=0.07).  It is evident that both pre- and postoperative strategies have been embraced in the 
United States, and it remains likely that a preoperative versus  postoperative trial will never be 
completed with sufficient numbers of patients.  Both approaches are now viewed as acceptable 
alternatives de facto.  
The predominant chemotherapy regimens for rectal cancer patients include 5- FU, with or without 
leucovorin, and protracted venous infusion 5- FU.  There also is interest in substituting oral 5- FU 
regimens for protracted venous infusion 5- FU.  The first intergroup rectal trial (NCCTG 86- 47-51) 
showed that protracted venous infusion of 5- FU during pelvic irradiation administered in the 
postoperative setting increased the time to relapse and improved survival compared to those treated with bolus 5- FU(2).  Results from the second intergroup trial (INT0114), with a median 
follow -up of survivors at 7.4 years, suggest that overall and disease- free survival are not 
statistically different among the four treatment groups.  All patients received two cycles of 5- FU-
based chemotherapy followed by pelvic radiation with 5- FU and two additional cycles of 
chemotherapy.  Chemotherapy was bolus 5- FU, 5- FU and leucovorin, 5- FU and levamisole, and 
5-FU, leucovorin, and levamisole (3- 5).  The data do suggest that local recurrence is significantly 
less for lower risk patients (T
1-2 N+ T3N0) compared to high risk (T 3 N+ T4 Nany) with ov erall survival 
and disease- free survival favoring the lower -risk group.  Males also had a poorer outcome.

2 The third intergroup trial (INT0144) is a three- arm, postoperative evaluation of 5- FU by bolus 
injection versus 5- FU by prolonged venous infusion prior to and following combined prolonged 
venous infusion plus pelvic radiation versus bolus 5- FU plus leucovorin plus levamisole prior to 
and following combined pelvic radiation.  The study reached its accrual goal in August 2000 and 
will require at least three more years before analysis can begin. Therefore, pending the analysis of the third Intergroup trial, INT0144, an optimal 5- FU-based regimen has yet to be defined.  
Recent advanced disease colorectal cancer trials have suggested that a regimen of irinotecan, 5-FU, and leucovorin is superior to 5- FU and leucovorin (6 -7).  The intergroup adjuvant colon trial 
(INT0089) has confirmed that 5- FU and leucovorin is the favored regimen (8- 13).  The recently 
completed colon intergroup adjuvant trial (C89803) compares irinotecan, 5- FU, and leucovorin 
versus 5- FU and leucovorin. The results are pending.  The survival advantage of irinotecan, 5- FU, 
and leucovorin in the advanced disease setting justifies further evaluation of the combination, not only in the adjuvant setting for colon cancer but also for rectal cancer patients.  There are limited data describing the use of post -radiation irinotecan, 5- FU and leucovorin for resected rectal cancer 
patients.  In a study of 17 patients receiving post -radiation and post -surgery weekl y irinotecan, 5-
FU and leucovorin for four weeks repeated every six weeks for three cycles, there was no evidence of grade 4 neutropenia or other grade 3- 4 non- hematologic toxicities (14).  Recent 
morbidity and mortality data from advanced disease trials and the intergroup protocol (C89803) suggest that the bolus regimen of irinotecan, 5- FU and leucovorin produces a level of toxicity 
which would warrant dose reductions or alternative schedules (6,15).  An alternative schedule includes infusion regimens of 5- FU combined with irinotecan which have been widely employed in 
Europe and approved by the Food and Drug Administration (7).  A recent report of infusion regimens of 5- FU with irinotecan suggest a median survival of greater than 20 months for 
advanced colorectal cancer patients with acceptable toxicity (16).   
Oxaliplatin (trans -l-1,2-diaminocyclohexane oxalatoplatinum) is a novel antineoplastic platinum 
derivative with a 1,2- diaminocyclohexane [DACH] carrier ligand.  Although the precise mechanism 
of action is unknown, platinum compounds are thought to exert their cytotoxic effects through the formation of DNA adducts that block both DNA replication and transcription. Like cisplatin, oxaliplatin reacts with DNA, forming mainly platinated intra- strand links with two adjacent guanines 
or a guanine adjacent to an adenine (17- 19).  However, DACH- platinum adducts formed by 
oxaliplatin are apparently more effective at inhibiting DNA synthesis (19,20) and are more cytotoxic than cis -diammine- platinum adducts formed from cisplatin and carboplatin (19- 21). 
The safety profile of oxaliplatin was evaluated in a phase I intra- patient escalation study of 44 
patients with advanced cancer, who received 116 courses of oxaliplatin through seven levels, from 45 mg/m² to 200 mg/m² every four weeks (22).  Oxaliplatin was administered without pre-hydration or post -hydration.  Initially, all patients experienced nausea and vomiting.  As a result, 
systematic pretreatment with antiemetics was given to all patients receiving >90 mg/m² oxaliplatin, 
which reduced Grade 3 or 4 nausea and vomiting to 11%.  Diarrhea was mild (primarily Grade 1 
or 2 in 24% of therapy courses).  Hematologic toxicity was moderate.  Grade 1 or 2 
thrombocytopenia was dose related and occurred in 13% of patients receiving from 135 to 150 mg/m², and 28.5% of patients receiving from 175 to 200 mg/m².  Similarly, only Grade 1 or 2 neutropenia was observed, and hemoglobin levels remained unchanged. The dose- limiting side -
effect of oxaliplatin therapy was a transient peripheral neuropathy.  This toxicity usually appeared 
at doses >90 mg/m² and affected up to 75% of patients treated with 200 mg/m².  The 
recommended phase II dose was 135 mg/m² administered over at least 1 hour every four weeks.  
A review of several studies to evaluate overall safety in 682 patients who had received oxaliplatin either as a single agent or in combination with 5- FU was done to delineate the character and 
severity of oxaliplatin- induced neurotoxicity (23).  Grade 3 neurotoxicity presenting as fine 
movement disturbance or moderate sensitive ataxia was observed in 12% of patients at a median 
cumulative dose of 900 mg/m² oxaliplatin.  (Total cumulative doses of 780, 1170, and 1560 mg/m² 
were correlated with an incidence of 10%, 50% and 75% neurotoxicity, respectively.)  The total cumulative dose of oxaliplatin was the most significant prognostic factor for the occurrence of neurotoxicity and inversely related to the likelihood of recovery from toxicity.  Symptoms resulting 
Eastern Cooperative  E3201 
Oncology Group  REVISED  
3 from Grade 1 and 2 neuropathy regressed in 82% of patients within 4 to 6 months, and 
disappeared entirely in 41% of patients within 6 to 8 months.  In summary, all studies reported to date that the neurotoxicity resulting from oxaliplatin treatment was specific, cumulative and, unli ke 
cisplatin -induced neuropathy, reversible in most patients.  
The efficacy of oxaliplatin monotherapy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer was evaluated in five phase II trials, two with 63 previously untreated patients and three with 139 patients w ith 
metastatic disease previously treated with and mostly refractory to 5- FU (23 -27).  The objective 
response rate achieved with oxaliplatin as first -line therapy was approximately 20% while that of 
oxaliplatin as second- line therapy was approximately 10%.  
Two randomized studies have compared the combination of oxaliplatin, 5- FU, and leucovorin to 5-
FU and leucovorin alone as initial therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer.  In one trial oxaliplatin was administered at 125 mg/m² every three weeks with dail y x 5 5 -FU plus leucovorin, and in the 
other oxaliplatin was administered at 85 mg/m² every two weeks with infusional 5- FU/ leucovorin 
on days 1- 2 (28, 29).  Both studies showed improved time to progression (q 2 weeks: 9.0 vs. 6.2 
months, p=0.0003; q 3 weeks: 8.7 vs. 6.1 months, p=0.048) and response rates (q 2 weeks: 
50.7% vs. 22.3%, p=0.0001; q 3 weeks 53% vs. 16% p<0.001) in the oxaliplatin arms.  Although a 
trend in favor of oxaliplatin was reported, there was no statistically significant difference in overall 
survival between the arms.  
In order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of regimens based on the following combinations:  5-FU+ leucovorin + irinotecan; 5- FU+ leucovorin + oxaliplatin; oxaliplatin + irinotecan, in newly 
diagnosed patients with advanced (metastatic) colorectal cancer an intergroup study, N9741, 
(NCCTG, ECOG, CALGB, NCIC- CTG, SWOG) was initiated. Initially, this was a 6 -arm study. 
However, 3 arms (those administering 5- FU for 4 or 5 consecutive days) were discontinued early 
because of  inferior efficacy or excessive toxicity. Recently, preliminary results of a planned interim 
analysis of the 3 remaining arms were released by the National Cancer Institute. The analysis, 
based on 795 patients enrolled in the study between March 1999 and April 2001, showed that 
patients receiving the infusional regimen (oxaliplatin with infusional 5- FU and leucovorin) had 
significantly longer time to disease progression (8.8 months vs 6.9 months; p = 0.0009), 
significantly better overall survival (18.6 months vs 14.1 months; p = 0.002) , a significantly higher response rate (38% vs 29%; p = 0.03) and lower toxicity than patients receiving irinotecan, with bolus 5- FU and leucovorin (IFL) (30, 31).  
Various modifications of the combination of oxaliplatin with 5- FU/leucovorin regimens (FOLFOX 1-
FOLFOX 6) have been evaluated (30- 34). The more recent modifications have simplified the 
schedule of administration and improved patient convenience without compromising the efficacy of the regimen. Maindrault -Goebel et al. reported on a Phase II study of oxaliplatin (100 mg/m
2) 
and leucovorin (400 mg/m2) as a 2- hour infusion on Day 1 followed by bolus (400 mg/m2) and a 
46-hour infusion (2.4- 3 g/m2) of 5- FU every 2 weeks (FOLFOX 6) as second line treatment for 
metastatic colorectal cancer (35). Sixteen of 60 patients treated had a partial response (27%) and 
an additional 45% had stable disease. Median progression- free survival was 5.3 months and 
median survival was 10.8 months. Ryan et al. evaluated biweekly oxaliplatin in combination with a 
modified de Gramont regimen (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 as a 2- hour infusion on Day 1 of each 2- week 
cycle, immediately followed by leucovorin, 500 mg/m2 as a 2- hour infusion followed by bolus FU, 
400 mg/m2 and a 46- hour infusion of 5- FU, total  dose 2.4 mg/m2) in heavily pre- treated patients 
with advanced colorectal cancer. Preliminary data showed a response rate of 7% (36). Updated information reveals a response rate of 11% (5% -22%), all in patients who had received prior 
irinotecan. When only second- line patients are considered, the response rate was 25% (8% -43%).  
1.2 Rectal Function in Patients Treated with Adjuvant Radiation Therapy  
Administration of pelvic radiation therapy is associated with significant potential for both acute and 
long term adverse effects on rectal function. Despite this, no rectal adjuvant trial has prospectively  
undertaken a detailed evaluation of rectal function. In this clinical trial, we plan to prospectively 
evaluate rectal function with validated tools. Information derived in this way can be used in future 
Eastern Cooperative  E3201 
Oncology Group  REVISED  
4 studies on interventions of treatments designed to mitigate the adverse effect of adjuvant 
treatment on rectal function.  
In a clinical trial of postoperative adjuvant pelvic radiation therapy and bolus 5- fluorouracil f or 
rectal cancer, 35% of the patients experienced $ grade 2 diarrhea (37).  The incidence of  $ grade 
3 diarrhea was 20%. Administration of 5- FU by continuous infusion results in a higher rate of 
grade 3 or worse diarrhea than administration by bolus (2). In a randomized comparison of these two approaches  to postoperative adjuvant therapy, grade 3 or worse diarrhea was observed in 
24% of patients during radiation therapy who received concurrent 5- FU by continuous infusion 
compared to only 14% of patients treated with 5- FU by bolus infusion during radiation  therapy. A 
number of randomized trials have been conducted in an effort to identify agents that prevent or 
decrease diarrhea during pelvic radiation therapy. Three trials have assessed the value of 
salicylate preparations (38- 40). Two studies suggested a beneficial effect (38- 40) and one 
NCCTG study suggested a large harmful effect. Two double blind clinical trials evaluated oral sucralfate (41,42). In one trial, sucralfate was associated with a decrease in diarrhea (41). In the other trial, performed by the NCCTG, sucralfate was not associated with a decrease in diarrhea, 
and some gastrointestinal symptoms were exacerbated by the use of this agent (42). A trial 
evaluating cholestyramine provided evidence that this agent can decrease diarrhea, but only at the expense of unacceptable gastrointestinal side effects (43). Taken together, evidence from 
these studies indicates that acute diarrhea is a significant clinical problem in patients receiving pelvic radiation therapy. These studies also indicate that there is no class of agents that 
consistently  demonstrates the ability to prevent diarrhea in these patients with an acceptable 
toxicity profile.  
Long term adverse effects on rectal function as a result of combined postoperative chemotherapy 
and radiation therapy were studied by Kollmorgen and colleagues from the Mayo Clinic (44). Forty -one patients who had received this treatment were contacted and questioned about their 
bowel function, as were 59 patients who had not received this treatment.  Highly statistic ally 
significant adverse effects on bowel function were observed in the irradiated group across a broad 
spectrum of 11 different parameters. For example, 46% of the irradiated patients experienced nocturnal bowel movements, compared to only 14% of the non- irradiated patients ( P<0.001). Fifty -
six percent of the irradiated patients experienced at least occasional incontinence, compared to only 7% of non- irradiated patients ( P<0.001). Protective clothing was used by 41% of irradiated 
patients and 10% of non- irradiated patients ( P<0.001).  Because interviewers were not blinded, 
and because the patients were not randomized to receive or not receive pelvic irradiation, the 
results of this study must be interpreted with caution.  
Lundby and colleagues evaluated rectal function 11 years after completion of a randomized clinical trial comparing adjuvant postoperative pelvic radiation therapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions, with a two week break after 30 Gy) with observation (45).  103 of the 494 patients originally entered onto the trial were alive without recurrence at the time of the evaluation.  The study design called 
for patients to be contacted by phone for a structured interview regarding their bowel function. Eight patients were excluded because of dementia or deafness.   Two could not be contacted.  
The remaining 93 patients, 49 in the radiation group and 44 in the control group, were included in the evaluation of rectal function. Individuals interviewing patients were blinded as to the treatment received at the beginning of the interview.  Blinding was maintained in 89% of the interviews. Findings of this study are strikingly similar to those observed in the Mayo Clinic study.  For 
example, 49% of irradiated patients experienced fecal incontinence, compared to only 5% of  
control patients ( P<0.001).  Protective clothing was used by 26% of the irradiated patients 
compared to none of the control patients ( P<0.001).  Because of the randomized nature of the 
original treatment allocation and because of the fact that interviewers, in the vast majority of 
cases, remained blinded as to the treatment received by the patients, it is unlikely that bias can account for these results.  This study, therefore, provides strong corroboration of the Mayo Clinic 
study and indicates that a very high proportion of patients experience clinically significant, long 
term rectal toxicity following postoperative adjuvant pelvic radiation therapy for rectal cancer.  
Eastern Cooperative  E3201 
Oncology Group  REVISED  
5 A review of the literature on the measurement of bowel function uncovered no standard un iform 
approach or measurement scale.  A number of studies report assessing “bowel function” but 
remain primarily concerned with the number of stools per day or use a varied assortment of 
questionnaire formats (46- 52). 
Prospective assessment of rectal function will be an integral part of this clinical trial, in view 
of the extensive body of research providing unequivocal evidence of both acute and long term adverse effects on rectal function in patients receiving pelvic radiation therapy.  A simple bowel function questionnaire has been developed for assessment of several measures of rectal function, such as stool frequency, continence, “clustering” (the need to 
have a second bowel movement, 30 minutes after defecation), and the ability to defer 
defecation 15 minutes.  The questionnaire is based on the Mayo Clinic study mentioned above, in which bowel function was assessed in a group of patients with resected rectal cancer who either had or had not received adjuvant pelvic RT (44).  As indicated previously, findings from this study suggest that this questionnaire is able to discriminate between 
patients that have received and not received pelvic radiation therapy. For each of the eight 
measures of bowel function addressed by the questionnaire, a highly significant difference 
was noted between the group of patients who had received prior RT and those who had not (44).  Further evidence of the ability of this questionnaire to discriminate between groups of patients may be found in the NCCTG study of sucralfate, whi ch demonstrated statistically 
significant worse outcome in the sucralfate group with regard to fecal incontinence, need for protective clothing, and overall gastrointestinal symptoms (42).  Use of this questionnaire will 
provide more detailed information on long- term bowel function than would be provided by 
common toxicity criteria alone.  
The primary construct we are targeting with the questionnaire is problems  with bowel 
function as perceived by the patient.  This construct is more relevant and precise than asking 
for a simple incidence measure of various bowel function parameters.  If the patient 
perceives that bowel function is a problem, then it is a problem (46, 53). Hence it is important 
to capture this patient -reported outcome as an indicator of treatment efficacy.  
Face validity of the bowel function questionnaire derives from a content analysis of the 
literature and the framework used in the application of the original questionnaire (44, 50- 60). 
We will carry out further psychometric evaluation of the bowel function questionnaire in this study. 
Specifically, we will assess the reliability and validity of the bowel function questionnaire according 
to standard methods (47) and analogous to specific methodology used to validate a tool for 
measuring constipation in cancer patients (46).  
A function questionnaire with a more general quality -of-life (QOL) measure is known as the 
Uniscale (48).  The Uniscale is a single- item visual analogue tool intended to measure overall 
QOL, which has been used successfully in a number of NCCTG trials. These studies have demonstrated that this global measure of quality of life is reliable and valid, and also has some 
advantages over more complex instruments (49).  Discriminant validity will be examined by 
correlating toxicity  incidence with individual items of the bowel function questionnaire.  
We will also use the FACT Diarrhea Subscale, a subscale of FACT -G, to assess bowel function in 
this study. The FACT Diarrhea Subscale is a simple eleven item instrument which covers a range of problems encountered by patients who experience diarrhea related to cancer treatment. A key 
difference between the FACT Diarrhea Subscale and the bowel function questionnaire is that the 
FACT Diarrhea Subscale uses a Likert scale, while the bowel function questionnaire uses a dichotomous scale for most questions. A general description of the extensive measures that have been undertaken to validate the FACT quality of life scales has been reported by Cella and colleagues (61).  
It generally takes patients less than 5 minutes to complete the short twelve- item bowel function 
questionnaire.  We believe this is an efficient means to obtain more detailed bowel function data.  The extra effort should not be overly burdensome to either the patients in terms of  time or the trial 
in terms of cost.  The Uniscale has been added to the end of the bowel function questionnaire for 
Eastern Cooperative  E3201 
Oncology Group  REVISED  
6 the convenience of the patient. Similarly, it will take less than five minutes to complete the FACT 
Diarrhea Subscale. Hence, in total the FACT, Uniscale and bowel function questionnaires require less than ten minutes for the patient to complete the combined 24 items  
1.3 Correlative Studies  
Numerous studies of molecular prognostic and predictive markers have been reported (62- 88), 
but none of the markers has reached routine clinical usage because their value is not proven (89-
91).  As a result of successful clinical trials (92), the current standard of care for rectal cancer patients in stage II and III is pre- or post -operative chemoradiation.  Identification of high- and low -
risk patients within the stage groupings would be helpful.  
In addition, predictive markers for response or resistance to chemoradiation have broad implications for treatment of patients with rectal carcinoma.  Therapy results  in morbidity and 
mortality in some patients, and cancer can progress despite therapy.  Therefore, markers that predict survival are needed (62).  
The sensitivity and resistance of cancers to chemoradiation are complex characteristics affected by pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, tumor biology, radiation biology, and tumor cell phenotypes 
and genotypes.  Recent advances in molecular biology have directed attention at genetic 
pathways involved in control of the cell cycle and apoptosis which are affected by therapeutic agents (93- 95).  In vitro studies suggested that the p53 pathway is important:  responses to most 
agents, including anti -metabolites such as 5- FU, the mainstay of chemotherapy for colorectal 
cancer, and radiation, were in large part dependent on w ild-type p53 (96). Cells with abnormal 
mismatch repair showed resistance to a wide variety of chemotherapeutic agents and radiation 
(97-98).  In addition, genes that encode enzymes involved in metabolism of chemotherapeutic 
agents and repair of their DNA adducts may affect drug efficacy and also serve as predictive 
markers for sensitivity and resistance to the agents (123).  Few studies, however, have addressed markers in clinical trials of chemoradiation.  
In patients who undergo resection of a rectal carcinoma with curative intent, it is the presence of 
undetected residual disease which is responsible for recurrence and ultimately death of the patient 
(99).  These occult metastases are the target of pre- operative neoadjuvant and post -operative 
adjuvant chemoradiation in rectal cancer (100,101).  Patients who have occult metastasis may benefit if the adjuvant chemoradiation is effective, but those patients who lack occult metastasis derive no benefit and are nonetheless subjected to the toxicity of treatment (102).  Ideally, markers for risk -adapted therapy would identify the patients at high risk and low risk, thereby helping to 
guide treatment decisions.  
Improved prediction of outcome by identification of the high- risk minority and the low -risk majority 
of patients would be helpful in both groups of rectal cancer patients to identify appropriate candidates for chemoradiation and those who do not need therapy because of inherently high survival rates.   
Dr. Hamilton’s laboratory was the first to report that 18q allelic loss was an unfavorable prognostic 
marker in stage II colorectal cancer (103), a finding that was confirmed in numerous subsequent 
studies (62, 65, 71, 73, 75, 78, 79).  In a collaborative study with the ECOG of stage III colon cancer, Dr. Hamilton’s laboratory reported that retention of chromosome 18q alleles in microsatellite -stable cancers and mutation of the transforming growth factor beta type II receptor 
gene (TGF beta RII) in cancers with high levels of microsatellite instability were favorable markers 
for disease- free and overall survival.  Therefore, we will evaluate the molecular predictive markers 
identified in our and others’ previous studies (chromosome 18q allelic loss, p53 gene mutation and 
microsatellite instability) in order to evaluate the relative strengths of the markers.  
The cooperative groups and others have conducted a series of retrospective trials correlating expression of key targets of 5- FU-based therapy with response to therapy in the adjuvant setting.  
In rectal cancer, a retrospective analysis demonstrated decreased survival for those patients with 
high thymidylate synthetase (TS) expression, although the patients who received the most benefit 
from chemotherapy had high TS expression (104).  Other investigators have confirmed that high 
Eastern Cooperative  E3201 
Oncology Group  REVISED  
7 TS correlates with worse survival.  However, more recent analyses for metastatic colorectal 
cancer suggest that low TS mRNA expression in tumor tissue is associated with a much higher response to therapy compared to those patients who have high TS mRNA expression.  
Preliminary data suggest that patients who have rectal tumor resection after preoperative 5- FU 
and radiation therapy not only will demonstrate tumor downstaging, but polymorphisms of the repeat sequences in the enhancer region of thymidylate synthase gene promoter may predict tumor downstaging (105, 106). In addition, recent analyses suggest colorectal cancer responding to 5- FU have low gene expression levels of dihydropyrmidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and 
thymidine phosphorylase (TP) (88).  We will evaluate expression of these three enzymes (TS, 
DPD and TP) as potential markers.   
This protocol includes therapy with oxaliplatin in Arm B and Arm E.  Excision repair cross -
complementing 1 (ERCC1), ERCC2 and XPF are enzymes involved in nucleotide excision repair, 
and their activity could affect the ability of tumor cells to remove platinum adducts from their DNA and influence the efficacy of the drug.  Colorectal cancer patients with low levels of ERCC1 expression in their tumor have been reported to have improved survival after oxaliplatin therapy 
(123).  We will evaluate expression of these three genes (ERCC1, ERCC2 and XPF) as potential 
markers.  
1.4 Gender and Ethnicities Statement  
This study is open to both men and women and to all racial/ethnic groups.  The patient enrollment pattern is expected to be similar to that of typical ECOG colorectal cancer studies.  According to the most recent ECOG experience, there is no evidence for outcome to be affected by either race 
or gender.  Thus, the study will not have separate accrual targets for different subgroups.  We will, 
however, conduct subset analyses to assess gender and racial/ethnic effects when possible.  
2. Objectives 
2.1 To compare the overall survival of patients treated with irinotecan, 5- FU and leucovorin versus 
those treated with oxaliplatin, leucovorin and 5- FU versus those treated with leucovorin and 5- FU 
for patients with stage II and III rectal cancer.  
2.2 Secondary endpoints will include sphincter preservation, tolerance of treatment and patterns of 
failure.  
2.3 To prospectively assess rectal function using the Patient Bowel Function/Uniscale questionnaire 
and the FACT Diarrhea Subscale in patients treated with an adjuvant program of pelvic radiation therapy and chemotherapy.  
2.4 To correlate TS, DPD and TP expression (key targets for 5- FU); retention of chromosome 18q 
alleles and MSI with TGFβ1RII mutation (markers for 5- FU efficacy); ERCC1, ERCC2 and XPF 
expression (participants in repair of adducts from oxaliplatin); and p53 gene mutation in tumor tissue specimens with treatment efficacy.   
2.5 To correlate tumor molecular prognostic markers (chromosome 18q allelic loss and MSI) with survival.  
2.6 To determine physician preference in regard to the radiation- chemotherapy sequence in the 
Intergroup.

5. Treatment Plan  
Group I patients will receive concurrent chemotherapy (Section 5.1) and radiation (Section 5.5) prior to surgery. Twenty -one (21) to 56 days post -surgery, patients will be randomized to receive 
irinotecan/leucovorin/5- FU, oxaliplatin/leucovorin/5- FU or  leucovorin/5- FU (Secti on 5.2).  
Group 1 PS patients are registered and randomized 21 to 56 days following surgery. At randomization, patients will receive one of the following: irinotecan/leucovorin/5- FU, oxaliplatin/ 
leucovorin/ 5- FU or leucovorin/5- FU (Section 5.2.).  
Group II patients will be registered and randomized 21 to 56 days following surgery. Upon randomization, patients will receive an initial treatment cycle of irinotecan/leucovorin/5- FU, 
oxaliplatin/leucovorin/5- FU or leucovorin/5- FU.  Concurrent chemotherapy (Section 5.1) and 
radiation therapy (Section 5.5) will then be administered followed by further cycles of irinotecan/leucovorin/   5- FU, oxaliplatin/leucovorin/5- FU or  leucovorin/5- FU. 
5.1 Chemotherapy Regimens Allowed During Radiation Therapy  
NOTE:  All doses are based on actual weight  
Patients will receive concurrent radiation and chemotherapy, which will consist of one of the following regimens, either pre- operatively or post -operatively.  Please note that the radiation

There have been several reports of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) 
associated with oxaliplatin use.  The hemolytic uremic syndrome should 
be suspected in individuals who experience the following unexplained 
severe hemolysis, hemoglobinemia, and renal failure as demonstrated by an increase in serum creatinine.  
Oxaliplatin should be discontinued permanently for any suspected 
occurrence of hemolytic uremic syndrome.  
Patients suspected of experiencing HUS must have the following 
laboratory analyses conducted:  
Creatinine, BUN  
Urinalysis with microscopic evaluation  
CBC  with differential and platelets  
PT/PTT

5.4.3.5  Pulmonary Fibrosis  
There have been reports of pulmonary fibrosis associated with oxaliplatin 
use.  Patients receiving oxaliplatin should be instructed to promptly report 
any respiratory difficulties  
Pulmonary toxicities of  grade 3 or worse will require that oxaliplatin be 
withheld until resolved to grade 1 or less.  Signs and symptoms 
associated with pulmonary fibrosis (cough, dyspnea, rales, hypoxia and tachypnea) should be investigated to rule out pulmonary fibrosis as their cause.  The investigation for pulmonary fibrosis should include (but not be 
limited to): chest radiography, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry or 
arterial blood gas evaluation and pulmonary function testing to include DLCO.  
The diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis will result in the discontinuation of oxaliplatin. These patients may continue to receive fluorouracil and leucovorin.

5.4.5  Management of Gastrointestinal Toxicity (All Patients)  
Patients will be instructed to begin taking loperamide at the earliest signs of a poorly 
formed or loose stool.  Loperamide should be taken in the following manner:  4 mg at 
the first onset of diarrhea, then 2 mg every two hours around the clock until the 
patient is diarrhea- free for at least 12 hours.  Patients may take loperamide 4 mg (2 
capsules) every four hours during the night.  If there is no relief within 24 -36 hours, 
add deodorized Tincture of Opium 4 drops in 1/4 to 1/2 cup of bland liquid or juice every 4 hours around the clock. In addition, begin oral fluoroquinolone and continue 
for 7 days.  
Eastern Cooperative  E3201 
Oncology Group  REVISED  
Revised 11/05, Addendum #4 
24 If diarrhea persists for greater than 48 hours, parenteral hydration is recommended 
(including hospitalization for such). Oral fluroquinolone treatment also s hould be 
initiated for patients who develop an ANC < 500mm3 (even in the absence of fever or 
diarrhea) or a fever that occurs with diarrhea (even without neutropenia). Antibiotics should continue until resolution of diarrhea.  (Refer to Appendix IX, Diarrhea Management Instructions.)  
Diarrhea or abdominal cramping that occurs during or within one hour after receiving irinotecan can be treated with atropine (0.25 to 1 mg IV as indicated).  Patients having recurrent problems with cholinergic symptoms may receive atropine 
prophylactically (SC or IV).   Additional antidiarrheal measures may be used at the 
discretion of the treating physician.  
Patients who experience diarrhea during treatment may benefit from dietary modification and/or consultation with a clinical dietitian.  Examples of foods which may exacerbate diarrhea include milk, ice cream, whole bran bread and cereal, nuts, seeds, fried or fatty foods, fresh and dried fruit, prune juice, raw vegetables, popcorn, 
potato chips, chocolate, coffee, teas, alcoholic beverages and cooked fruits and 
vegetables with seeds or skins such as berries, corn and tomatoes.  Foods which may mitigate problems with diarrhea include fish, poultry and meat that is cooked, broiled or roasted, bananas, apple sauce, peeled apples, white bread, macaroni and noodles, baked, boiled or mashed potatoes, cooked vegetables that are mild, such as asparagus tips, green and waxed beans, carrots, spinach, squash, mild processed 
cheese, eggs and smooth peanut butter.  
5.4.6  Dose Modification for Obese Patients  
There is no clearly documented adverse impact of treatment of obese patients when 
dosing is performed according to actual body weight.  Therefore, all dosing is to be determined solely by (1) the patient’s BSA as calculated from actual weight or (2) 
actual weight without any modification unless explicitly described in the protocol.  
This will eliminate the risk of calculation error and the possible introduction of variability in dose administration.  Failure to use actual body weight in the calc ulation 
of drug dosages will be considered a major protocol deviation.  Physicians who are uncomfortable with administering chemotherapy dose based on actual body weight should not enroll obese patients.  
5.4.7  Interruption of Chemotherapy for Reasons Other Than Toxicity  
Closure of Colostomy: The time for closure of the colostomy will be at the discretion of the surgeon and should be arranged to minimize time off chemotherapy.  Closure of colostomy following completion of chemotherapy is encouraged.  The total number of cycles should be retained.  
5.5 Radiation Therapy  
All patients will receive a total of 50.4 Gy external beam radiation therapy at 1.8 Gy per fraction per day for 28 fractions over a total of 5 1/2 weeks.  Pelvic fields will receive 45 Gy in 25 fractions,  followed by a boost of 5.4 Gy in 3 fractions.  Intraoperative radiation therapy 
and/or brachytherapy are strictly prohibited.  
The Quality Assurance Review Center (QARC) will perform a Final Review at the completion 
of radiation therapy. Please see sections 5.5.11, 12.3 and Appendix IV for the quality 
assurance documentation requirements.  
Standard and conformal techniques will be allowed in this study.  Institutions using conformal techniques must complete a 3D benchmark.  The benchmark materials may be obtained from the QARC website ( www.QARC.org
) and must be submitted to QARC prior to final review.Rev. 11 /05

25 5.5.1  Patient Positioning and Setup/Treatment Planning and Verification  
Multiple fields technique (usually either 3 fields with a posterior and 2 lateral fields 
with wedges or 4 fields with anterior, posterior and 2 lateral fields) is mandatory.  
Custom shielding is mandatory to exclude as much small bowel as possible. Prone 
position is recommended, and “belly -drop” devices should  be considered. It is 
recommended that the buttocks be taped apart to decrease self -bolus effect. It is also 
recommended that patients be treated with a full bladder. They should be instructed to void 1 hour before XRT and immediately drink 16 ounces of a non-caffeinated 
beverage and then not void until after treatment is complete for that day.  All fields 
must be treated daily.  
As part of the treatment planning process, all patients will undergo simulation for all 
fields to be treated with a machine that duplicates the geometry of the actual treatment machine.  Conventional simulation or the use of CT based simulation linked to software that allows "virtual simulation" are both allowed as long as the simulation process provides for duplication of the geometry of the actual treatment machine. It is 
recommended that oral gastrointestinal contrast material be given between 1 and 2 
hours prior to simulation to facilitate definition of the small bowel, so that as much as possible of this normal structure can be shielded. At the time of simulation, barium or other contrast materials should be placed in the rectum. The anal verge should be marked with a radio- opaque marker.  
5.5.2  Target Volume – Initial Fields  
5.5.2.1  Preoperatively Irradiated Patients  
The target volume will include the entire tumor and nodal groups at risk for metastatic disease.  This will include the internal iliac and pre -sacral lymph 
nodes.  The external iliac nodes will be included when tumors extend to the uterus, cervix, vagina, bladder or prostate.  Exclu sion of as much bowel as 
possible through the use of custom shielding is required.  
5.5.2.2  Postoperatively Irradiated Patients  
The target volume will include the entire preoperative tumor and nodal groups at risk for metastatic disease.  Determination of the preoperative tumor volume will be based on findings from preoperative and intraoperative evaluations, including preoperative endoscopy studies, 
preoperative imaging studies (such as CT scans or barium enema), the 
operative note and the pathology report.  Clips placed by the surgeon to mark the tumor bed may also be used for determining the preoperative tumor volume.  This will include the internal iliac and pre -sacral lymph 
nodes.  The external iliac nodes will be included for tumors that extended to the uterus,  vagina, bladder or prostate. Exclusion of as much bowel as 
possible through the use of custom shielding is required.  
5.5.3  PA and AP Fields  
5.5.3.1  PA and AP Fields in Preoperatively Irradiated Patients 
The superior border of the fields will extend at least 3 cm superior to the tumor, and will be no lower than L5 -S1 interspace.  The inferior border will 
be at least 2 cm distal to the tumor.  The lateral border of the fields will be at least 1.5 cm lateral to the greater sciatic notch on each side.  Customized blocking is recommended for all fields.  Blocks will provide at least 3 cm margin around the tumor.  Superiorly, the blocks will be on or lateral to the sacroilliac joints. Inferiorly, the blocks will be on or lateral to a line connecting the ischial tuberosities to the field edge at the widest

in Section 5.5.1, AP fields need not be used in patients treated with PA and lateral fields.  
5.5.3.2  PA and AP Fields in Postoperatively Irradiated Patien ts 
5.5.3.2.1  PA and AP Fields for Postoperatively Irradiated Patients 
Who Have Had An Anterior Resection  
The superior border of the fields will extend at least 3 cm superior to the tumor bed, and will be no lower than L5-S1 interspace.  The inferior border will be at least 2 cm 
distal to the tumor bed.  The lateral border of the fields 
will be at last 1.5 cm lateral to the greater sciatic notch on each side.  Customized blocking is recommended for all fields.  Blocks will provide at least 3 cm margin around the tumor  bed.  Superiorly, the blocks will be on 
or lateral to the sacroiliac joints. Inferiorly, the blocks will 
be on or lateral to a line connecting the ischial 
tuberosities to the field edge at the widest separation of the pelvis at the level of the greater sciatic notch. As outlined in Section 5.51, AP fields need not be used in patients treated with PA and lateral fields.  
5.5.3.2.2  PA and AP Fields For Postoperatively Irradiated 
Patients Who Have Had An Abdominal Perineal 
Resection  
The superior border of the fields will extend at least 3 cm superior to the tumor bed, and will be no lower than L5-S1 interspace.  The inferior border will include the entire 
perineal scar.  It is recommended that the perineal scar 
be identified with radio- opaque markers prior to 
simulation to assist with identification and inclusion in 
the RT field.  The lateral border of the fields will be at last 1.5 cm lateral to the greater sciatic notch on each side.  Customized blocking is recommended for all 
fields.  Blocks will provide at least 3 cm margin around 
the tumor bed.  Superiorly, the blocks will be on or lateral to the sacroiliac joints. Inferiorly, the blocks will be on or lateral to a line connecting the ischial tuberosities to the field edge at the widest separation of the pelvis at the level of the greater sciatic notch.  
5.5.4  Lateral Fields  
5.5.4.1  Lateral Fields For Preoperatively Irradiated Patients 
The superior and inferior borders of the lateral fields will be the same as the AP -PA fields.  The posterior border/blocking will provide for a margin of 
at least 1.5 cm on the anterior sacrum.  The anterior border/blocking will 
extend at least 2.5 cm anterior to the tumor and will also include the 
internal iliac nodes.  In most patients, this will mean that the anterior border is such that the anterior half to one- third of the femoral heads lie 
anterior to the anterior border of the lateral RT field.  In patients at risk for external iliac lymph node involvement, because of involvement of the bladder, prostate, vagina, cervix or uterus, the field will extend to the 
anterior symphysis pubis, to allow for inclusion of the external iliac lymph 
nodes.

Who Have Had An Anterior Resection:  
The superior and inferior borders of the lateral fields will 
be the same as the AP -PA fields.The posterior 
border/blocking will provide for a margin of at least 1.5 cm on the anterior sacrum.  The anterior border/blocking will extend at least 2.5 cm anterior to the tumor bed and will also include the internal iliac nodes.  In most 
patients, this will mean that the anterior border is such 
that the anterior half to one -third of the femoral heads lie 
anterior to the anterior border of the lateral RT field.  In patients at r isk for external iliac lymph node involvement, 
because of involvement of the bladder, prostate, vagina, cervix or uterus, the field will extend to the anterior 
symphysis pubis, to allow for inclusion of the external 
iliac lymph nodes.  
5.5.4.2.2  Lateral Fields For Po stoperatively Irradiated Patients 
Who Have Had An Abdominal Perineal Resection  
The superior and inferior borders of the lateral fields will be the same as the AP -PA fields. The inferior border 
and the posterior border will include the entire perineal scar.   It is recommended that the perineal scar be 
identified with radio- opaque markers prior to simulation 
to assist with identification and inclusion in the RT field.  The posterior border/blocking will also provide for a 
margin of at least 1.5 cm on the ante rior sacrum.  The 
anterior border/blocking will extend at least 2.5 cm 
anterior to the tumor bed and will also include the internal iliac nodes.  In most patients, this will mean that the anterior border is such that the anterior half to one-third of the femoral heads lie anterior to the anterior 
border of the lateral RT field.  In patients at risk for 
external iliac lymph node involvement, because of involvement of the bladder, prostate, vagina, cervix or uterus, the field will extend to the anterior symphysis pubis, to allow for inclusion of the external iliac lymph nodes.  
5.5.5  Target Volume- Boost Fields  
After a dose of 45 Gy is delivered to the pelvic field, the fields will be reduced to include the primary tumor (or tumor bed, for postoperatively irradiated patients) with a minimum 2 cm margin in all directions.  Exclusion with custom shielding of as much of small bowel (defined by oral contrast) as possible is strongly encouraged.  The 
boost fields will be given a dose of 5.4 Gy at 1.8 Gy/fraction. The total cumulative 
dose delivered within the boost fields will be to a total dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions.  
Patients may be treated with opposed fields or a multiple field technique during the boost phase of treatment.   
5.5.6  Equipment  
5.5.6.1  Modality: X -rays with nominal energy of 4 MV or greater.  The minimum 
allowable treatment distance is 80 cm SAD.  Co -60 is not allowed on this 
study.

Oncology Group  REVISED  
28 5.5.6.2  Calibration: The calibration of therapy machines used in this protocol shall 
be verified by the Radiological Physics Center (RPC).  
5.5.7  Target Dose  
5.5.7.1  Prescription Point: The prescription point is at or near the isocenter.  
5.5.7.2  Dose Definition: Dose is specified in cGy to muscle.  
5.5.7.3  Tissue Heterogeneity: Density corrections are not required, however, 
inhomogeneity correction for air or bone attenuation may be applied.  This 
is optional and would typically be in the setting of CT -based treatment 
planning where radiation dose distributions and treatment calculations are 
automatically generated based upon the CT densities of the treatment -
planning scan.  
5.5.7.4  Prescribed Dose and Fractionation: Initial fields will be given 45 Gy at 1.8 
Gy per day.  The boost fields will receive 5.4 Gy at 1.8 Gy per day.  
5.5.7.5  Dose Uniformity : The dose variation in the PTV will be +7% and -5% of the 
prescription point dose. This applies to all photon treatment techniques.  Wedges, compensators, and other methods of generating a uniform dose 
distribution are encouraged.  
5.5.7.6  Therapy Interruptions: Interruptions that are required because of RT or 
chemotherapy -related toxicity or major holidays shall not result in protocol 
violation.  Interruptions that are due to a major intervening illness (for example, myocardial infarction) shall not result in protocol violation.  
Interruptions for other reasons that prolong treatment by 5- 8 days shall 
constitute  a minor protocol deviation, and interruptions for other reasons 
that prolong treatment by 9 or more treatment days shall constitute a major 
protocol deviation.  Because it is not possible to anticipate every interruption that may be required during a cour se of RT, the principle 
radiation therapy investigator will be given discretion to not assess a 
protocol violation for interruptions for toxicity other than those described in section 5.5.8.1, if such interruption is felt to be in the best interest of the patient.  
5.5.8  Radiation Toxocity  
5.5.8.1  Chemoradiation will be interrupted for Grade 3 acute skin, hematologic or 
GU toxicity or diarrhea, as defined in the Common Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0).  
5.5.8.2  In the event of such an interruption, chemoradiation can resume when 
there is recovery to Grade 2 or less toxicity. (See Section 5.4 for 
chemotherapy dose modifications.)  
5.5.9  Normal Tissue Sparing  
As previously described, every effort must be made to limit the dose to the small bowel.  It is expected that portions of the bladder will receive full dose.  
5.5.10  Dose Calculation and Reporting  
If conformal techniques are used to treat patients on this study, a 3D benchmark needs to be completed and submitted to QARC . 
5.5.10.1  Prescription Point: The monitor units required to deliver the prescribed do se 
to the prescription point shall be calculated and submitted.

shall be submitted. The prescription point and the outlines of the planning target volume and critical organs shall be shown. Isodose values must be 
clearly labeled. The effects of shielding blocks shall be included. 
For volume based treatment planning, a color hard copy isodose 
distribution for the total dose plan in the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes, which includes the isocenter of the planning target volume (PTV) must be submitted. If sagittal and coronal planes are not available, then five axial distributions may be submitted (central axis, two superior and two inferior 
planes). These dose distributions must include the following:  
A sufficient number of isodose contours should be shown to determine that 
the dose distribution conforms to the protocol guidelines. These isodoses 
should be superimposed over treatment planning CT or MR images. However, if such hard copy presents difficulty, similar plots without the gray scale image are acceptable if enough critical contours are identifiable 
to verify the dose distribution to target volumes and critical normal 
structures. Specifically, include those volumes for which there are dose volume histograms.

5.6.3  Administration Instructions  
5.6.3.1  The FACT Diarrhea Subscale (FACT -D) is available in Spanish; the Patient 
Bowel Function/Uniscale Questionnaire is not. Patients who do not speak English or who prefer Spanish to English, may be offered a Spanish version of the FACT -D. 
5.6.3.2  Instructions at the top of the questionnaires should be read to the patient. 
Assure patient’s understanding and ask him/her to complete every item without overlooking any items.  
5.6.3.3  If patients are unable to complete the forms independently because 
language, literacy, or physical condition is a barr ier, the form should be 
administered by a trained staff member. Note on the Assessment 
Compliance Form the degree of assistance required and the mode of 
administration: interview or self -administration.  
5.6.3.4  It is very important to review the questionnaires after the patient has 
completed them to be sure that all questions have been answered and that only one answer has been marked for each question. If the patient has 
marked more than one answer for a question, ask the patient which 
answer best reflects how he/she is feeling. If the patient skipped a question, inform the patient and ask him/her to answer the question. Always give the patient the option to refuse and indicate on the measure itself, next to the question that was not answered, that the patient did not 
want to answer the question.

looking at his/her copy of the forms. Please note on the Assessment 
Compliance Form that a telephone interview was conducted. Questionnaire data should be collected within one week of the missed assessment.  
5.6.3.6      While it is preferable for the patient  to complete the questionnaires, it is 
acceptable for them to be completed with the assistance of a family 
member/companion, health care provider or via a phone call to the patient 
by a health care provider or research associate. The 18 -month 
questionnaires may be obtained at the time of a follow -up visit, may be 
mailed in by the patient or completed via a phone call, as described above.  
5.6.3.7      If the patient fails to complete an assessment for any reason, he/she 
should still be asked to complete the remaining scheduled assessments . 
5.6.3.8     The Assessment Compliance Form should be completed and attached to 
the questionnaires each time they are scheduled to be completed. Mail the form to the ECOG Coordinating Center (Reference Records to be Kept, Section 12.0)  
5.7 Surgery  
Prior to randomizati on (for patients registered prior to surgery), patients will be evaluated and 
cleared by the surgeon to determine if their medical condition will tolerate the planned operation.  
The surgeon should determine whether or not the tumor is fixed or mobile, resectable or not, and, if resectable, which operation will be performed should the patient go directly to the operating room (LAR, APR, LAR/coloanal anastomosis).  
Patients with any symptoms suggesting an obstruction should have a diverting colostomy placed prior to beginning preoperative therapy.  
5.7.1  Surgery Schedule  
Surgical resection should occur between 21 -56 days (3 - 8 weeks) after the patient 
completes preoperative 5 -FU and radiation therapy.  
5.7.2  General Operative Evaluation  
All patients will be explored at least for palliative intent even if there is no clinical evidence of tumor regression, because palliation is superior if tumor is resected, providing there is no clinical evidence of metastatic disease. An exam under anesthesia should be performed and evaluation of tumor size and location reported.  At the time of surgery, the procedure should begin with close inspection of the liver and peritoneal surfaces for any evidence of metastatic disease.  Any suspicious 
areas should be biopsied prior to beginning resection of the primary tumor.  If any of 
the biopsies are positive, the patient will be considered to have extensive disease and the surgeon will select the procedure to be performed.  
5.7.3  Surgical Resection  
If the preoperative evaluation demonstrates extrapelvic metastatic disease, a 
palliative procedure may be selected by the operating surgeon to provide the 
maximal control of symptoms for the greatest duration of the patient’s anticipated survival.  In almost all cases, this will be an LAR or APR.  
Eastern Cooperative  E3201 
Oncology Group  REVISED  
34 The choice of  the operative procedure (APR, LAR or LAR/coloanal anastomosis) is at 
the discretion of the surgeon.  It is strongly recommended that the entire mesorectum 
be removed and that the distal rectal margin of 2 cm be obtained for sphincter 
preserving procedures.  The surgical procedure will be determined by the extent of 
the tumor prior to preoperative therapy.  Adjacent organs involved with tumor at the time of pre -registration evaluation should be resected even if there is no evidence of 
residual tumor in those tissues at the time of surgery.  
The pathologist will ink the specimen for evaluation of the radial margin.  
Following the resection of the tumor specimen, when feasible, biopsies will be taken 
from the adjacent tissues near the resection margin and sent s eparately for 
evaluation of the surgical bed for residual tumor.  
When APR is performed, some form of closure of the perineum will be performed 
unless contraindicated.  
If the patient has a diverting colostomy, it should not be closed until after the complet ion of chemotherapy.  During this time, the patient should be seen monthly by 
the surgeon and the anastomosis digitally dilated.  Patients should be followed for at least four weeks after surgery.  
5.8 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
5.8.1  Purpose  
Adverse event  data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every 
clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well 
as those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents. Adverse events are 
reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during a trial (please refer to the E3201 Forms Packet for the list of forms with directions for routine adverse event reporting).  Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner for more timely monitoring of patient safety and care. The following sections 
provide information about expedited reporting.  
5.8.2  Determination of reporting requirements  
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the 
patient has received an investigational or commercial agent; 2) the characteristics of the adverse event including the grade (severity), the relationship to the study therapy (attribution), and the prior experience (expectedness) of the adverse event; 
3) the phase (1, 2, or 3) of  the trial; and 4) whether or not hospitalization or 
prolongation of hospitalization was associated with the event.  
An investigational agent is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational 
New Drug Application (IND). In some instances, the investigational agent may be available commercially, but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved package label.  
Commercial agents are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from a commercial source. The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some occasions distribute commercial agents for a trial.  
When a study arm includes both investigational and commercial agents, the following rules apply.  
Concurrent administration:  When an investigational agent(s) is used in combination 
with a commercial agent(s), the combination is considered to be investigational 
and expedited reporting of adverse events would follow the guidelines for 
investigational agents.  Rev. 11/05

Oncology Group  REVISED  
Revised 11/05, Addendum #4 
35 Steps to determine if an adverse event is to be reported in an expedited 
manner : 
Step 1:  Identify the type of event using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0. The CTCAE provides descriptive terminology 
and a grading scale for each adverse event listed. A copy of the CTCAE  can be 
downloaded from the CTEP home page ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). Additionally, if 
assistance is needed, the NCl has an Index to the CTCAE that provides help for 
classifying and locating terms. All appropriate treatment locations should have access to a copy of the CTCAE.  
Step 2:  Grade the event using the NCI CTCAE. 
Step 3:  Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy 
(investigational or commercial).  Attribution categories are as follows: Unrelated, 
Unlikely, Possible, Probable, and Definite.  
Step 4:  Determine the prior experience of the adverse event . Expected events are 
those that have been previously identified as resulting from administration of the 
agent. An adverse event is considered unexpected, for expedited reporting purposes 
only, when either the type of event or the severity of the event is NOT  listed in:  
• Arm A, C, D, F, and S  – the drug package insert or protocol  
• Arm B and E  – the current NCI Agent -Specific Adverse Event List for the 
investigational agent or package insert/protocol for the commercial agents  
NOTE:  The NCI AgentSpecific Adverse Event List (ASAEL) is included in Section 
5.9 of the protocol. The ASAEL is a list of events that should be considered 
‘expected’ for adverse event reporting purposes. The ASAEL is presented in 
the third column of the Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potential Risks List (CAEPR) and identified with  bold  and italicized  text. 
Step 5:  Review the ”Additional instructions, requirements, and exceptions for 
protocol E3201” table in s ection 5.8.6 and footnote b in Section 5.8.7 for protocol 
and/or ECOG specific requirements for expedited reporting of specific adverse 
events that require special monitoring.   
NOTE:  For general  questions regarding expedited reporting requirements, please 
contact the NCI Medical Help Desk:  301- 897-7497.  
5.8.3  Reporting methods  
Arm A, B, C, D, E, F, and S  – This study requires that expedited adverse event 
reporting use the NCI’s Adverse Expedited Reporting System (AdEERS). The 
NCI’s guidelines for AdEERS can be found at http://ctep.cancer.gov .  For 
questions regarding the use of the AdEERS application, please contact the NCI Technical Help Desk:  301- 840-8202.  
An AdEERS report must be submitted to ECOG and the appropriate regulatory agencies by one of the following methods:  
Electronically submit the report via the AdEERS Web- based application located at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov
 
or 
Fax the completed NCI Adverse Event Expedited Report – Single Agent or Multiple 
Agents paper template located at http://ctep.cancer.gov  to ECOG 
(617- 632-2990), Attention: AE.  In addition, fax the completed AdEERS report to 
the NCI (301- 230-0159) for Arms B and E and to the FDA (800- 332-0178) for 
Arms A, C, D, F, and S.

system is down.  Once the system is restored, a report submitted on a paper template must be entered  into the AdEERS system by the 
original submitter of the report at the site.   
Any supporting or follow up documentation must be faxed to ECOG (617- 632-2990), 
Attention: AE.  In addition, supporting or follow up documentation must be faxed to the NCI (301)  230-0159 for Arms B and E and the FDA (800) -332-0178) for Arms A, 
C, D, F, and S.  
5.8.4  When to report an event in an expedited manner  
Some adverse events require 24- hour notification (refer to Section 5.8.6). Please 
complete a 24- Hour Notification Report via t he NCl AdEERS website 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/adeers.html ) within 24 hours of learning of the 
event.  The full AdEERS report must be completed and submitted via AdEERS within 5 calendar days.   
If the AdEERS system is down, a 24- hour notification call must be made to ECOG 
(617- 632-3610) and to NCI (301- 897-7497).  Once the system is restored, a 24- hour 
Notification Report must be entered into the AdEERS system by the original submitter of the report at the site.   
When an adverse event requires expedited reporting, submit a full AdEERS report within the timeframes outlined in Sections 5.8.6 and 5.8.7.  
NOTE:  Adverse events that meet the reporting requirements in Sections 5.8.6 or 5.8.7 and occur within 30 days of the last dose of protocol treatment must be reported on an expedited adverse event report form (using AdEERS). For any adverse events that occur more than 30 days after the last dose of treatment, only those that have an attribution of possibly, probably, or definitely AND meet the reporting requirements in Sections 5.8.6 or 5.8.7 
must be reported on an expedited adverse event report form (using 
AdEERS).  
5.8.5  Other recipients of adverse event reports  
ECOG will forward AdEERS reports to the appropriate regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical company, if applicable.    
Adverse events determined to be reportable must also be reported by the institution, 
according to the local policy and procedures, to the Institutional Review Board 
responsib le for oversight of the patient.

40f 5.10 Supportive Care (Chemotherapy Toxicity)  
All supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care will be given throughout the 
study.  
Loperamide (Imodium):  Patients will be instructed to begin taking loperamide at the earliest 
signs of a poorly formed or loose stool.  Loperamide should be taken in the following manner:  
4 mg at the first onset of diarrhea, then 2 mg every two hours around the clock until the patient is diarrhea- free for at least 12 hours.  Patients may take loperam ide 4 mg (2 capsules) 
every four hours during the night.  (Refer to Appendix IX, Diarrhea Management Instructions.)  
Atropine:  Diarrhea or abdominal cramping that occurs during or within one hour after 
receiving irinotecan can be treated with atropine (0.25 to 1 mg IV as indicated).  Patients having recurrent problems with cholinergic symptoms may receive atropine prophylactically (sc or IV).  Additional antidiarrheal measures may be used at the discretion of the treating physician.  
Antiemetics :  Patients may receive dexamethasone 10 mg IV as a pretreatment antiemetic 
before irinotecan doses, unless there is a relative or absolute contraindication to 
corticosteroids (i.e., diabetes, known sensitivity to corticosteroids, severe muscle weakness or 
myalgias, etc.).  Other antiemetics may be used in addition to the suggested regimen, if clinically indicated.  As the majority of patients on previous trials have not experienced significant nausea, antiemetics other than decadron are recommended only for those patients who demonstrate nausea and/or vomiting despite treatment with decadron.  
Routine use of antiemetics prior to treatment with standard dose 5 -FU and leucovorin is rarely 
indicated.  It is recommended that patients not be given routine antiemetics for the standard 
arms of the study (Arms C and F) and that antiemetics be prescribed by the treating physician as clinically indicated if a patient develops nausea and/or vomiting.  
Oxaliplatin is emetogenic.  All patients receiving oxaliplatin (Arms B and E) should be pre -
medicated with an acceptable anti- emetic regimen.  
Antibiotics (for patients with persistent diarrhea) : Begin oral fluoroquinolone and continue for 7 
days. If diarrhea persists for greater than 48 hours, parenteral hydration is recommended (includi ng hospitalization for such). Oral fluroquinolone treatment also should be initiated for 
patients who develop an ANC < 500 /mm³ (even in the absence of fever or diarrhea) or a 
fever that occurs with diarrhea (even without neutropenia). Antibiotics should continue until resolution of diarrhea. (15)  Rev. 11/05

Revised 11/05, Addendum #4 
41 Anticoagulants:   Patients who are taking Coumadin may participate in this study; however, it 
is recommended the prothrombin time be monitored carefully (at least weekly).  
Subcutaneous heparin is permitted.  
Hyper sensitivity : Platinum hypersensitivity can cause dyspnea, bronchospasm, itching and 
hypoxia.  Appropriate treatment includes supplemental oxygen, steroids, antihistamines, and epinephrine; bronchodilators and vasopressors may be required.  Platinum hypersensitivity is an extremely rare event and should be treated promptly.  
Oxaliplatin hypersensitivity occurs in approximately 0.5% of patients receiving this investigational agent.  See Appendix VI for the "Comparison of the Symptoms and Treatment 
of Pharyngo- Laryngodysesthesias and Platinum Hypersensitivity Reactions.  
Pharyngo- laryngodysesthesias : Oxaliplatin may cause discomfort in the larynx or pharnyx 
associated with dyspnea, anxiety, swallowing difficulty and is exacerbated by cold.  
Appropriate therapy includes use of anxiolytics, cold avoidance and monitoring.  See Appendix VI for the  "Comparison of the Symptoms and Treatment of Pharyngo-Laryngodysesthesias and Platinum Hypersensitivity Reactions."  
5.11 Duration of Therapy   
Patients will continue to be monitored for toxicity but will discontinue protocol therapy in the following situations:  
5.11.1  Patient experiences unacceptable  toxicity, in spite of dose modifications as outlined in Section 5.4.  
5.11.2  If the patient requests discontinuation of therapy.  
5.11.3  If the patient’s attending physician believes that it is in the patient’s best interest to stop therapy.  
5.11.4  Disease recurrence while on therapy.  
5.11.5  Severe hypersensitivity reaction.  
5.11.6  If a patient is removed from study treatment, that patient should be evaluated for 
continuing radiation therapy +/ - standard chemotherapy or surgery at the discretion of 
the treating physician.  
5.12 Duration of Follow -up 
All patients, including those who discontinue protocol therapy early, will be followed for 
response until progression and for survival until 10 years from the date of registration. All patients must also be followed through completion of all protocol therapy.

46 8. Drug Formulation and Procurement  
8.1 Irinotecan - For more information, please refer to the package insert.  
8.1.1  Other Names   
Camptothecin -11, CPT -11, Camptosar ® 
8.1.2  Classification   
Topoisomerase I inhibitor.  
8.1.3  Mode of Action  
Topoisomerase I is intimately involved in DNA replication and RNA transcription as it 
relieves the torsional strain introduc ed ahead of the moving replication fork.  The 
cytotoxicity of irinotecan results from single and double strand DNA breaks that are produced by the inhibited topoisomerase I during the course of DNA and RNA 
synthesis.  Irinotecan is an inactive prodrug and must be metabolized in vivo  by 
carboxyesterases to the active compound SN -38.    
8.1.4  Storage and Stability   
Undiluted vials are stored at room temperature (15 -30EC), and protected from light.  
Irinotecan diluted with 5% dextrose is stable at refrigerated temperatures for 48 hours 
when protected from light.  
8.1.5  Dose Specifics   
Arms A and D: 180 mg/m2 IV over 90 minutes. Repeat every 2 weeks.  
8.1.6  Preparation  
Irinotecan mus t be diluted before infusion.  The recommended dilutant for short 
intravenous administration of irinotecan is 500 mL of dextrose 5% or a concentration 
range between 0.12 to 2.8 mg/mL.  Stability is less in normal saline.  The diluted 
solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter.  
8.1.7  Administration  
IV over 90 minutes  
8.1.8  Availability  
Irinotecan is a commercially marketed product which has been approved by the FDA 
for the treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum and metastatic 
carcino ma of the colon or rectum where disease has recurred or progressed following 
initial fluorouracil- based therapy. However, its use in patients with advanced (stage II 
or III) rectal cancer is not currently approved by the FDA. When used as directed by this protocol, irinotecan is classified as an “unapproved use of an approved agent” 
and, by definition, considered as an investigational agent. However, while it is not an 
indication currently approved by the FDA, the use of irinotecan in this protocol is 
exemp t from the requirements of an IND, as described under Title 21 CFR 312.2(b).  
Commercially available in 100 mg single dose 5 mL vials and 40 mg single dose 2 ml vials containing 20 mg/mL.  
8.1.9  Incompatabilites  
Solutions other than dextrose 5% or normal saline should not be used for dilution.  
Other compatibility information is not available.  
Eastern Cooperative  E3201 
Oncology Group  REVISED  
47 8.1.10  Drug Interactions  
Dexamethasone when administered concurrently with irinotecan causes increased 
lymphopenia and hyperglycemia.   
Laxative use should be curtailed during irinotecan administration and in the immediate days following irinotecan administration.   
Simultaneous administration of prochlorperazine and irinotecan has increased the incidence of akathesia.   
Diuretic use with irinotecan may exacerbate dehydration induced by diarrhea and chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting.   
St. John’s wort decreases the AUC of SN -38 presumably by induction of CYP3A4 
activity.  
Ketoconazole via inhibition of CYP3A4 signficantly increase exposure of the active metabolite SN -38, which could result in exaggerated toxicity.  Consideration of dose 
reduction in patients on ketoconazole and other agents known to inhibit CYP3A4 should be considered for irinotecan.  
 
8.1.11  Side Effects   
Hematologic: Leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenic 
fever, hemorrhage  
Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, flatulence, stomatitis, dyspepsia, dehydration 
Hepatic: Elevated transaminases  
Cardiovascular:  Vasodilation, hypotension, myocardial infarction, stroke, edema  
Neurologic:  Dizziness, confusion, somnolence, insomnia, back pain  
Respiratory: Pulmonary embolism 
Dermatologic: Alopecia, rash 
Other: Asthenia, thrombophlebitis, sweating, weight loss, chills  
8.1.12  Nursing/Patient Implications   
Premedicate with dexamethasone in anticipation of mild to moderate nausea and 
vomiting. When used in combination with 5- fluroruracil and leucovorin the nausea 
and vomiting will likely be worse.  
Fatalities have been reported with thromboembolic events and neutropenic sepsis in 
patients receiving 5- fluorouracil, leucovorin and irinotecan.  
Monitor for diarrhea. For diarrhea occurring during or immediately after the infusion 
of irinotecan, atropine 0.25 to 1mg can be administered IV or SC (anticipate mydriasis and tachycardia). For more delayed diarrhea, usually beginning 5- 7 days 
after starting treatment, the patient should take 4 mg loperamide orally at the first loose stool. Loperamide dosing should continue at 2 mg q 2h (4 mg q 4h at night) 
until 12 hours after the first formed stool. (NOTE: this loperamide regimen is in 
excess of the labeled “maximum” dose of 16 mg/day.)  
Monitor CBC, platelets, and liver function tests.  
Dose modifications per the protocol or the package insert should be followed for hematologic and gastrointestina l toxicity.

50 8.2.10  Preparation  
• Oxaliplatin for injection :  Reconstitute the lyophilized powder by adding 10 mL 
(for the 50 mg vials) or 20 mL (for the 100 mg vials) of Water for Injection or 
Dextrose 5% in Water to yield a 5 mg/mL solution.  After reconstitution in the original vial, withdraw the required amount of reconstituted solution from the vial(s) and then dilute with 250 mL to 500 mL Dextrose 5% in Water to give an 
oxaliplatin concentration of not less than 0.2 mg/mL. Do not reconstitute or 
dilute oxaliplatin with a sodium chloride solution.  
• Oxaliplatin injection:   Withdraw the calculated dose of the 5 mg/ml solution from 
the vial(s)  and then dilute with 250 mL to 500 mL Dextrose 5% in Water to give 
an oxaliplatin concentration between 0.2 mg/mL and 2.0 mg/mL.  Do not 
reconstitute or dilute oxaliplatin with a sodium chloride solution.    
Do not use administration needles or intravenous infusion sets containing 
aluminum items (risk of degradation of oxaliplatin upon contact with aluminum) for the preparation or administration of either the oxaliplatin for injection or the oxaliplatin injection.  
8.2.11  Incompatibilites (Both Formulations)  
Do not mix or administer with saline or other chloride containing solutions.  Oxaliplatin is unstable in the presence of chloride.  
The infusion line should be flushed with D5W prior to administration of any concomitant medication.   
Oxaliplatin is unstable under alkaline conditions.  Do not mix with alkaline drugs or 
solutions  (in particular 5- fluorouracil basic solution, trometamol and folinic products 
containing trometamol as an excipient ).  When oxaliplatin is administered with 5-
fluorouracil, the oxaliplatin infusion should precede that of 5- fluorouracil.   Ensure the 
infusion lines are adequately flushed with 5% Dextrose between administration of 
the two drugs.  
When oxaliplatin is administered with folinic acid, separate infusion bags and lines 
must be used, with Y -tubing to connect the two lines prior to the single injection site.  
Under these conditions of administration, the two products have been shown to be chemically compatible.    
Do not use components containing aluminum for the preparation or administration of 
oxaliplatin.  There is a risk of drug degradation when in contact with aluminum.

8.2.17  Potential Drug Interactions (Both Formulations)  
In vitro, oxaliplatin is not metabolized by, nor does it inhibit, human cytochrome 
P450 isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or 
CYP2E1.  Metabolically mediated drug- drug interactions of oxaliplatin on co-
administered drugs cleared by these CYP isoforms are not anticipated in humans.  
No significant pharmacokinetic interactions between oxaliplatin and 5- fluorouracil, 
irinotecan, topotecan, or gemcitabine have been observed in patients.  
Since platinum -containing compounds are eliminated primarily through the kidney, 
oxaliplatin clearance may be decreased by co -administration of potentially 
nephrotoxic compounds, although this has not been specifically studied.  
In vitro, platinum was not displaced from plasma proteins by the following 
medications:  erythromycin, salicylate, sodium valproate, granisetron, a nd paclitaxel. 
No plasma protein binding displacement interaction are anticipated in humans.  
8.2.18  Contraindications  
Oxaliplatin should not be administered to patients with a known allergy to other 
platinum compounds.  
8.2.19  Nursing/Patient Implications  
• Premedicate w ith antiemetics (5 HT3 antagonist and steroid) to prevent severe 
nausea and vomiting.  
• Monitor for diarrhea and treat symptomatically.  
• Monitor for neuropathies (parasthesias of hands, feet and toes and pharynx 
and occasionally cramps), if they occur, tend to be brief (less than one week) 
during the first course but longer with subsequent courses. Advise patients to avoid cold exposure and against touching cold objects. Sensory neuropathies develop with continued treatment. Ask patient if changes in ambulatio n, 
swallowing, breathing or fine motor activity have been noted.  
• Prolonging the oxaliplatin infusion time to 6 hours may alleviate acute neurologic toxicities.  
• Monitor for respiratory changes such as shortness of breath.  
 WARNING: The hemolytic uremic syndrome should be suspected in individuals who 
experience the following: unexplained severe hemolysis, hemoglobinemia and renal 
failure, as demonstrated by an increase in serum creatinine. (See section 8.2.16).

LV, LCV.  
8.4.2  Classification   
Tetrahydrofolic acid derivative.  
8.4.3  Mode of Action  
Leucovorin ac ts as a biochemical cofactor for 1- carbon transfer reactions in the 
synthesis of purines and pyrimidines.  Leucovorin does not require the enzyme 
dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) for conversion to tetrahydrofolic acid.  
Leucovorin can potentiate the cytotoxic  effects of fluorinated pyrimidines (i.e., 
fluorouracil and floxuridine).  After 5 -FU is activated within the cell, it is accompanied 
by a folate cofactor, and inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthetase, thus inhibiting pyrimidine synthesis.  Leucovorin increases the folate pool, thereby increasing the binding of folate cofactor and active 5 -FU with thymidylate synthetase.  
8.4.4  Storage and Stability  
All dosage forms are stored at room temperature.  At concentrations of 0.5 -0.9 mg/ml 
the drug is chemically stable for at least 24 hours at room temperature under normal 
laboratory light.  
8.4.5  Dose Specifics

Orally administered prodrug of Fluorouracil which is an antimetabolite  
8.5.3  Mode of Action  
Capecitabine is a prodrug, which is readily absorbed Intact from the GI tract, then converted in the liver by carboxyesterase to  5 -deoxy -5-fluorocytidine, and ultimately 
to 5- fluorouracil by thymidylate synthetase. This enzymatic conversion occurs in all 
tissues, but is higher in colorectal tumors due to increased intratumoral levels of 
thymidylate synthetase. Capecitabine produces plasma concentrations of fluorouracil comparable to equivalent doses of intravenous fluorouracil administered by 
continuous infusion.

60 9. Statistical Considerations 
9.1 Clinical Endpoints  
The main endpoint of this trial is overall survival (OS). We expect OS to be 75% at three 
years for the control arm (5 -FU/LV, Arms C [Group 1]/F [Group 2]) and the study is designed 
to target a hazard ratio of 1.3 (75% vs 80% OS at 3 years; 62% vs 69% at 5 years) in either of 
the experimental arms, Irinotecan/5- FU/LV (Arms A [Group 1]/D [Group 2]) or Oxaliplatin/5-
FU/LV (Arms B [Group 1]/E [Group 2]).  
With all ma jor cooperative groups participating in this study, we expect to achieve an accrual 
rate in the range of 600 patients per year (200 patients per arm per year).  With the expected 
accrual and failure rates given above, the study will have over 82% power to detect a hazard ratio of 1.3 for OS between either experimental arm and control with 3,000 total eligible 
patients (600 eligible patients per year for 5 years) and follow -up of 1.5 years after closure to 
accrual. With an expected ineligibility rate of 5%, this trial may enter 3,150 total registrations. 
This design incorporates 7 interim analyses and one final analysis at 6.5 years post activation for overall survival. One interim analysis will occur every six months corresponding to scheduled ECOG Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) meetings, once the trial achieves 25% 
expected information (142 total failures, at roughly 36 months post activation). Analyses will 
use stratified log rank tests (stratified on the factors listed in section 4.26) with an overall 0.0167 (=0.05/3) one -side type I error. Full information will occur at 564 total deaths.  The 
O'Brien -Fleming group sequential boundary will be used to adjust for the sequential testing 
and the use function methodology of Lan and DeMets will be employed to adjust the boundaries if the actual interim analyses do not correspond with the projected information 
times given here. Group sequential O'Brien -Fleming boundaries for the first three interim 
analyses will be truncated at 0.00033. Simulation studies conducted by the ECOG Statistical 
Center and others (Friedlin, Korn and George) (108) suggest that overall test size is inflated by a negligible factor from the truncation, but there may be a small gain in terms of expected stopping time.  
Assuming one of the experimental arms is no different from the control arm and the other 
experimental arm is active, power for a true hazard ratio of 1.30 to compare the two 
experimental arms using a two- sided 0.0167 level test is 74% (power is 82% for a hazard 
ratio of 1.33). If both of the experimental arms are active (at least 80% OS at 3 years), the power to detect a hazard ratio of 1.30 between experimental arms, using a two- sided 0.0167 
level test is 64% (power is 80% for a hazard ratio of 1.37). Power to compare the 
experimental arms will also be higher with longer follow -up. 
This study will be monitored for early stopping in favor of the null hypothesis using repeated 
confidence interval methodology similar to that described by Jennison and Turnbull (109). At each interim analysis nominal one- sided (1 -alpha) confidence intervals on the overall survival 
hazard ratios comparing the experimental arms to control will be computed, where alpha is the nominal one -sided significance level of the use function boundary at the informati on 
fraction at the particular analyis time. If the confidence intervals do not contain the target alternative of 1.3, the ECOG DMC may consider closing an experimental arm or stopping the trial early for overall lack of a treatment difference. Conversely, if an experimental arm is found to be statistically superior to the control arm at a particular interim analysis before accrual is completed, the ECOG DMC may consider closing the control arm to further accrual.  
Patient follow -up will be completed per section 7.0. All patients will be followed at least yearly 
for survival for a period of 10 years post registration.  
9.2 Laboratory Correlates  
Objectives 2.4 and 2.5 seek to determine the prognostic and predictive significance of TS and other key targets of 5 -FU, E RCC1 and other enzymes involved in repair of oxaliplatin adducts  
and molecular markers (18q allelic loss, MSI and p53 gene mutation) for overall survival in 
Eastern Cooperative  E3201 
Oncology Group  REVISED  
61 rectal cancer. We base power calculations for these endpoints on our previous ECOG 
experience in adjuvant colon cancer with TS and 18q allelic loss. Results in adjuvant colon cancer have shown that roughly 80% of cases showed high levels of expression (2+/3+) and 
20% of patients showed no or low levels of expression (0/1+). Also, we observed an absolut e 
10% difference in OS at 5 years in the colon series, with highly expressing patients exhibiting 
worse survival. Using these figures, we anticipate having at least 85% power to detect an 8% absolute difference in OS at 5 years in this study (from 63% in the highly expressing group to 71% in the low/no expression group; a 35% increase in median overall survival). Calculations are based on the accrual and follow -up assumptions given in the previous section and a two-
sided 0.05 level logrank test for overall survival, assuming 85% of the patients contribute evaluable samples to the correlative component of the trial. If the split between low and high expression groups is more evenly distributed (50% in each group) then the power will be higher to compare these groups, greater than 95%.  We expect that the other targets of 5 -FU 
will have power similar to that described above for TS.  
For molecular marker analysis we use 18q allelic loss to estimate power and expect that other 
molecular markers will have similar power. In our previous adjuvant colon correlative study 
we found that roughly 50% of samples showed 18q loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and 50% showed no loss, with an absolute difference in overall survival at 5 years of 19% (69% for no loss group versus 50% in the LOH group). Assuming that the rectal cases in this study will exhibit similar patterns of LOH, we anticipate that there will be greater than 95% power to detect a smaller difference, 63% versus 73% at 5 years, again assuming that 85% of the 
samples will be available for this analysis. If the 18q LOH split is different from 50:50, say 
25% of cases with LOH and 75% of cases with no loss, then the power will still be high, 
greater than 95%. With 50% of cases showing LOH, there will be 83% power to detec t an 
absolute difference as small as 30% in overall survival (63% versus 70% at 5 years).  
9.3 Bowel Function and Quality of Life Endpoints 
9.3.1  Quality of Life (QOL) Data Analysis  
Analytical processing of the patient bowel function questionnaire (PBF), Uniscale, and FACT Diarrhea Subscale (FACT -D) will be comparable. We will calculate 
summary scores for the PBF and FACT -D as prescribed by the tool authors. The 
PBF will provide a score representing the number of problems experienced by the patient with bowel functioning as well as with individual aspects of bowel function. 
The FACT -D produces a single total score transformed onto a 0- 100 point range. The 
Uniscale is a single -item score from 0- 100. 
Each of the endpoints mentioned in the previous paragraph will be compa red across 
the two treatment groups. The main statistical comparison across treatment arms will 
be the change score from baseline to last assessment (18 month post treatment) in each group. The summated scores from the PBF, FACT -D, and Uniscale will be 
compared via ANOVA and two- sample t -tests (two -sample tests will be performed at 
a two -sided significance level of 0.05/3=0.0167). Supplementary analyses will include 
analysis of covariance modeling of the differences between groups over time in each of the Q OL endpoints while holding constant the various demographic and treatment 
covariates. The proportion of patients that report problems with different aspects of 
bowel function will be compared across groups using equality of binomial proportions 
testing. Fu rther analysis will involve an examination of the clinical significance for 
changes over time by calculating the percentage of patients in each treatment group that report an improvement of more than 10 points on the 0- 100 point scale for any 
QOL endpoint (110-112).  These percentages will be compared via chi- square 
testing. All testing will be done using a two- tailed overall 5% Type I error rate (0.0167 
level for each of three pairwise comparisons).  
Concurrent validity of the QOL measures will be ascertained by calculating the difference in scores between the Uniscale, PBF, and FACT -D values for each patient 
Eastern Cooperative  E3201 
Oncology Group  REVISED  
62 followed by a number of approaches.  First, simple correlational data will be obtained 
via the use of Spearman's rho correlation coefficient with validity being determined to have been established if the monthly correlation coefficients are all within the range 
of 0.5 to 0.75 (113). Simple paired comparison procedures (t -tests, Wilcoxon 
procedures) will be used based on the results of normality testing (114) and the 
measurement comparison procedures of Bland and Altman (115). Equality of trends over time analysis will be carried out by calculating the slope of the QOL scores over time and testing for equality of slopes across the two measures and by subsequently testing for a zero slope for the trend of different scores over time.  Finally, area under 
the curve analysis will be completed by calculating the difference of the area under 
the curves for the two measures and using the same simple univariate tes ts for 
measures of central tendency specified above.  
9.3.2  Power considerations for QOL data  
A two -sample t -test with 1000 patients per group provides over 90% power to detect 
a difference of 20% times the standard deviation. This effect size has been classified 
as small and minimally clinically significant by various authors.  Hence, we will have 
sufficient power to detect all clinically significant differences between individual treatment groups. With 1000 patients per group, we will have over 90% power to detect differences of 10% in the rate of bowel function problems reported between groups by standard equality of binomial proportions testing.  
9.3.3  Handling of Missing QOL Data 
Several approaches to missing data will be employed including alternatives that carry forward the mean, minimum, maximum, last value, and zero value (in the case of 
death) for the purposes of verifying that the results for treatment comparisons are consistent relative to various assumptions and impact of the randomness of the missing data (117, 116). Previous experience with imputation in clinical trials has 
demonstrated that the use of various imputation methods compared to complete 
cases analysis provides evidence of the degree of robustness of the results relative to the assumptions of the analytical procedure (118). We do not expect the amount of missing data to exceed 20% and therefore the results should remain relatively resistant to missing data. We will examine the data for any influence that would be likely to cause data to be missing for any other reason than simple random chance. In 
other words, we will explore the dataset for evidence to suggest that any concomitant 
influence may cause the data to not be missing completely at random.

Five polymorphic dinucleotide markers on 18q (D18S69, D18S64, D18S55, D18S61 and D18S58 from centromere to telomere) and the National Cancer Institute Consensus MSI Panel of two mononucleotide markers (BAT25, BAT26) and three dinucleotide markers (D2S123, D5S346 and D17S250) and the mononucleotide marker in transforming growth factor beta type II receptor are amplified in DNA extracted from tumor and normal control tissue with multiplex PCR and sequenced with the ABI 3700 instrument in the Molecular 
Diagnostics Laboratory by the protocol- assigned technologist, as detailed in our previous 
Eastern Cooperative  E3201 
Oncology Group  REVISED  
68 publication (43).  Peak sizes are quantitated and the chromatogram tracings and quantitative 
data are reviewed with Drs. Hamilton and/or Rashid.  
Mutation of the p53 gene in exons 5 through 8 will be evaluated by PCR amplification from 
tumor DNA and automated sequencing on the ABI 3700 instrument in the Molecular 
Diagnostics Laboratory by the protocol -assigned technologist, as in our previous publications 
(124, 125).  The chromatogram tracings will be reviewed with Drs. Hamilton and/or Rashid.   
Evaluation of TS, DPD, TP, ERCC1, ERCC2 and XPF expression will be carried out in the laboratory of Dr. Robert Diasio.  Drs. Diasio and Soong have laboratory space of 2000 square feet on the sixth floor of the Wallace Tumor Institute located on the School of Medicine 
Campus at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The labs are modern, wet laboratories 
set up for biochemical and molecular studies with space dedicated for cell culture, PCR and biochemical assays. In these laboratories are two kinetic PCR (Roche LightCycler and ABI7700 Sequence Detector) Instruments, an ABI310 Genetic Analyzer for DNA sequencing, a PALM Robot -Microbeam Laser Capture Microdissector, a Pharmacia GeneQuant II 
Spectrophotometer and a WAVE Denaturing HPLC Instrument for the detection of sequence 
variants.   
Dr. Soong will be supervising the entire process from the receipt of samples, the design, 
validation and performance of assays to the compilation of the results. He has extensive expertise in assay design and translational studies and has developed a number of kinetic RT-PCR systems, application kits and quantification concepts used commercially and 
patented by Roche Diagnostics, including those to be used in this study. Dr. Soong has also 
published some of the largest series on the clinical relevance of p53 alterations, 
microsatellite instability and cytokeratin 20 in various cancer types, including colorectal cancer.  
RNA Extraction from Paraffin- Embedded Tissue (PET)  Microdissected PET from 10μm 
sections will be sent to the University of Alabama at Birmingham. RNA will be isolated from 
this tissue using the standardized protocols in the High Pure RNA Paraffin Kit (Roc he 
Cat#3270289, Indianapolis, Indiana). Briefly, tissues are homogenized and digested overnight 
in a buffer containing Proteinase K. The digest is then loaded onto a spin column containing glass fibers that bind nucleic acids. Through successive washing steps, contaminants are removed and eventually nucleic acids are eluted from the column into a 50μl solution. This process also involves incubation with DNase I and a second Proteinase K digestion to 
maximize RNA purity. Using a prototype of this kit, an abi lity to amplify RNA from 
macrodissected paraffin -embedded tissue and a correlation between RNA levels obtained 
from these tissues and immunohistochemical results has been shown previously (126).  
Kinetic RT -PCR Quantification of RNA levels of markers of 5 -fluorouracil and oxaliplatin 
response.  Quantification of DPD, TP and TS RNA levels will be performed by kinetic (or 
“real-time”) RT -PCR on the LightCycler Instrument (Roche, Indianapolis, Indiana) according 
to the assay systems described in the LightCycler  - DPD mRNA Quantification Kit
PLUS (Roche 
Catalog#3302938), LightCycler - TP mRNA Quantification KitPLUS (Cat#3302946) and 
LightCycler - TS mRNA Quantification KitPLUS (Cat#3302954) kits respectively. In these kits, 
10μl of RNA eluate is converted to cDNA in a 30μl reaction including 1x reverse transcriptase reaction mix, deoxynucleotide triphosphates, RNAse inhibitor, a gene specific primer and 
AMV reverse transcriptase; incubated at 25
oC for 10 minutes, 42oC for 60 minutes and 94oC 
for 5 minutes. Four μl cDNA is then submitted to kinetic PCR in a 20μl reaction containing 1 x 
PCR reaction mix, a “hotstart” Taq polymerase and gene- specific oligonucleotide primers and 
fluorescent probes. The incubation times are 95oC for 5 minutes, 40 cycles of 95oC for 10 
seconds, 62oC for 10 seconds and 72oC for 10 seconds before cooling at 40oC for 30 
seconds.  
In kinetic PCR, the addition of fluorescent probes allow monitoring of amplification kinetics 
and hence, determination of a crossing point (CP or “cycle threshold”) at a partial cycle number at which fluorescence becomes detectable above background levels. CP values are 
Eastern Cooperative  E3201 
Oncology Group  REVISED  
69 linearly correlated to gene concentration (127) hence, gene quantities are determined using 
CP values and an algorithm included in the LightCycler Relative Quantification software (Roche). The algorithm calculates equivalent quantities to standard curve methods (120). To 
standardize kits and normalize for sample loading and inter -run variation, final quantities are 
expressed as ratios of target to a reference (or “housekeeping”) gene in the test sample, 
relative to the ratios of target to reference gene in a calibrator sample included in each run. Calibrator samples are included in each kit and production lot -standardized.  
The kits for DPD, TP and TS RNA quantification use the same kinetic RT -PCR system that 
has been validated previously (128). This system had a dynamic range of at least 1000000 
and was able to detect down to a single gene copy for different gene targets. From 27 
individual determinations,  involving 3 different sample concentrations, 3 separate RT 
reactions and 9 individual PCR runs, the co -efficient of variation for the crossing point (CP) 
values of detection was 0.4 -1.2% and the sample quantity was 12% for this system.  
Detection mixes containing oligonucleotide primers and fluorescent probes for DPD, TP, TS and the reference gene, glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), are included in each 
kit. For the quantification of ERCC1, ERCC2 and XPF RNA levels, detection mixes will be designed and validated for analysis in the same kinetic -RTPCR system as the other kits. To 
facilitate amplification from PET, small PCR amplicon sizes will be designed.   
Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of DPD, TP and TS protein levels.  Five μm sections containing areas of normal and tumor tissue and continuous to those used for the analysis of other molecular markers will be sent to the University of Alabama at Birmingham for IHC 
analysis. IHC detection of DPD, TP and TS protein expression will be performed according to 
the protocols in the Anti -DPD Antibody, Formalin -Grade (Roche, Cat #3183645), Anti -TP 
Antibody, Formalin- Grade (Cat#3183653) and Anti -TS Antiserum, Formalin -Grade 
(Cat#3186008) kits respectively. Briefly, aft er deparaffinization and rehydration, sections 
undergo antigen retrieval by steaming for 5 minutes. They are then blocked with 20% normal 
goat serum for 20 minutes before overnight incubation at 4
oC with either DPD, TP or TS 
antibody/antiserum diluted 1:100. Secondary Envision+ peroxidase antibody (Dako Inc., 
Glostrup, Denmark), specifically anti -rabbit for DPD, TS and anti -mouse for TP, are added to 
the sections for 30 minutes before color development with liquid DAB (Dako) for 20 minutes and counterstaining with Mayer’s haematoxylin. For DPD, sections are incubated with rabbit anti-rat immunoglobulins (Dako) diluted 1:100 for 30 minutes prior to the addition of the 
secondary antibody. Between each incubation step, sections are washed twice with 1xPBS for 5  minutes. A negative control section without the addition of DPD, TP or TS -specific 
antibodies/antisera will be included for each IHC run. A positive control section from a tissue with known immunostaining patterns for DPD, TP and TS will also be included with each run and will be examined for consistency of staining.  
Protein expression from the IHC stains will be evaluated using a semi -quantitative scoring 
strategy described previously that takes into account both the intensity and extent of staining (129) . Immunostains are assessed on their intensity on a scale of 0 (no staining) to 4+ 
(strongest intensity). The proportion of cells of each intensity to a total of 100% is determined and the final score obtained by multiplying each intensity with the proportion of cells allotted to it, thus allowing a maximum score of 400 (100% at 4+ intensity). For each section, 8 
individual IHC scores will be determined based on the localization of stains in combinations of 
normal mucosa or tumor, epithelium or stroma and nucleus or cytoplasm. To reduce bias, scores will be determined by two independent investigators and averaged.  
It is recognized that there are additional predictive markers that may be of interest during the accrual period of this study.  The banking of tissue blocks and/or slides (Section 11.4) will provide the necessary flexibility to add additional tumor markers.  The study team and the 
Gastrointestinal Intergroup will consider the addition of future markers for analysis.

70 11.1.1  Tumor Marker Reporting  
11.1.1.1  Chromoso me 18q allelic loss:  Loss of an 18q allele will be determined by 
a >50% reduction in the area under the peak for 1 allele in tumor DNA as 
compared to non- neoplastic tissue for at least 1 of 2 polymorphic 
markers.  The results for each marker will be recorded along with the 
summary interpretation.  (see Section 11.1.1.3 below)  
11.1.1.2  Microsatellite Instability (MSI)  
Microsatellite instability (MSI) status will be interpreted on the basis of shifts in allele size with the criterion of >50% increase in tumor DNA as 
compared to the corresponding peak in mucosal DNA on the 
chromatogram. The 8 dinucleotide and 3 mononucleotide markers will be assessed. Tumors are then classified using criteria from the National Cancer Institute- sponsored workshop on MSI in colorectal cancer (93). 
Results for each marker are recorded in the project database.  
Classification of the tumor is based on the following criteria:  microsatellite-
stable cancers have shift in none of a minimum of eight evaluable markers; 
cancers with low levels of m icrosatellite instability (MSI -L) have shift in less 
than 30% of evaluable markers among a minimum of eight; and cancers with high levels of microsatellite in stability (MIS -H) have shifts in >30% of 
evaluable markers among a minimum of eight. In microsatellite -stable 
cancers, loss of an 18q allele will be determined by a >50% reduction in 
the area under the peak in tumor of at least 1 of the 2 polymorphic 
markers, as compared to non- neoplastic tissue.  
11.1.1.3  Molecular Classification  
Each tumor is classified on the molecular pathway alterations and results of previous correlative studies.  A standardized report form is prepared 
including the list of each marker results and the interpretation of the case 
as: 
Microsatellite -stable with 18q allelic loss  
Microsatellite -stable without 18q allelic loss  
Low level of microsatellite instability (MSI -L) with 18g allelic loss  
Low level of microsatellite instability (MSI -L) without 18g allelic loss

11.2 Specimen Processing for Molecular Analysis  
Upon receipt in Dr. Hamilton’s office, the case is logged into the project database and the stained slide is examined histologically by Dr. Hamilton or Dr. Asif Rashid of the GI Pathology 
Research Laboratory for the presence of tumor and mucosa and for tissue quality for quality assurance/quality control purposes.  The review results are recorded in the database.  Tumor and mucosa tissue areas for DNA extraction are marked on the H&E slide to serve as the 
microdissection guidance slide.  The unstained slides and marked H&E slide are delivered to 
the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory (CLIA -88 approved) at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center 
and logged into the project database.  The demarcated areas are scraped by scalpel (the vast majority of colorectal cancers can be microdissected satisfactorily by scalpel scraping rather than the more time -consuming method of laser capture microdissection) into separate tubes 
by the project -assigned technologist.  For unusual cases with difficult scalpel microdissection, 
Drs. Hamilton or Rashid will carry out laser capture microdissection in the Department of Pathology shared facility and the tubes will then be transported to the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory for DNA extraction.  The microdissected slides and histologic guidance slide are filed in the GI Pathology Research Laboratory (Stan Hamilton, MD, Principal Investigator) for possible future review.  
11.2.1  DNA Extraction and Purification 
The tube of tumor and the tube of mucosa are processed to DNA separately by the project -assigned technologist using standard methods in the Molecular Diagnostic 
Laboratory (MDL).  An aliquot of DNA for marker analysis, an aliquot for collaborator analysis, and an aliquot for backup storage are prepared.   
11.3 Banking  
11.3.1  Tissue blocks and slides  
The residuals tissue blocks and/or slides collected for the correlative studies described in Section 10.0 will be retained at the ECOG Central Tissue Repository for possible use in GI Intergroup approved future studies.

Suggested Patient Consent Form 
 
You are being asked to take part in this study because you have rectal cancer and you may benefit 
from additional treatment.  This is a type of clinical trial (research study).  Clinical trials include only 
patients who choose to take part.  Please take your time to make your decision and discuss it with your friends and family.  
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BE ING DONE
? 
 
This study involves treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery.  This research 
is being done to compare the effects (good and bad) of a combination of che motherapy 
medications.  To date, there have been very few studies of different combinations of 
chemotherapies for patients with rectal cancer, who have already had surgery and radiation.  This study will compare the investigational treatment combinations o f irinotecan/leucovorin/5-
fluorouracil or oxaliplatin/leucovorin/5- fluorouracil with the standard therapy leucovorin/5-
fluorouracil.  
 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THE STUDY ? 
 
About 3000 people in the United States and Canada will take part in this study . 
 
WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THIS STUDY ?   
 
This is a randomized study which means that the three chemotherapy treatment combinations 
are compared with each other to find out if one is better and also to see if the order in which therapies are given will affec t outcome.  If you agree to enter this trial, you will be randomly 
assigned to receive one of the three chemotherapy combinations.  You have an equal chance of an assignment to any one.  This helps to make the results of the research more scientifically 
sound.  Neither you nor your doctor will have a say as to which schedule you are assigned to, 
but both you and your doctor will be informed as to which treatment you will receive.  
Eastern Cooperative  E3201

Appendix I – Page 2 of 18  The majority of patients with newly -diagnosed rectal cancer are treated with a combined 
program of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery; however, the order or sequence in which 
these treatments are given may vary, as may the chemotherapy which is administered during 
radiation.  Patients and their physicians get to choose which of tw o treatment groups they will   
be in.   
There are two treatment groups in this trial.  One group receives radiation therapy combined 
with 5 -fluorouracil chemotherapy before surgery.  The second group receives surgery first, 
followed by one of the combination chemotherapies, followed by radiation therapy with 5- FU, 
followed by more combination chemotherapy.  The radiation will be given Monday through 
Friday for about six weeks.  You and your doctor will have a choice as to how the 5- fluorouracil 
will be administered.  During the chemotherapy, the 5- fluorouracil may be administered by vein 
over several minutes with the leucovorin for four consecutive days of the first and fifth week of radiation OR the 5 -fluorouracil may be administered continuously through a catheter in a large 
vein during the entire course of the combined radiation and chemotherapy (six weeks). If you are participating in a clinical trial (R -04) conducted by the National Surgical Adjuvant Project 
for Breast and Bowel Cancers (NSABP), you are potentially eligible to participate in this study. 
If you enter this study (E3201), you may receive a pill form of 5 -fluorouracil (capecitabine), 
which you will take twice a day during the course of the radiation. The use of capecitabine with radiation is ONLY allowed for patients if they are receiving it by participating in R -04. In effect, 
you will be participating in both studies.  
Whether you receive radiation with 5- FU before or after surgery, there is a rest period of at 
least three weeks (usually four  to eight weeks) until you have recovered adequately from your 
operation.  Group one patients (pre- operative radiation with 5- FU) will have surgery within 
three to six weeks after completing radiation.  All patients will be treated according to one of 
the treatment schedules described below after their surgery.  
[ Please note: If you have received chemotherapy and radiation followed by surgery as 
described in the treatment plan, you may be able to participate in this trial. Your doctor will 
determine if you can join. You, also, will receive treatment according to one of the schedules described below. ]  
Schedule A - this is a two day treatment given every 2 weeks for a total of eight 2 -week cycles.  
Medications are given before chemotherapy to prevent nausea and vomiting.  All of the chemotherapy drugs will be given intravenously (through a vein).  Irinotecan is given over 90 minutes; leucovorin is given over 2 hours, followed by 5- FU (5 -fluorouracil) given as a quick 
infusion, followed by 5- FU given as a constant infusion through a portable pump over the next 
46 hours.   
Schedule B - this is a two day treatment given every 2 weeks for a total of eight 2 -week cycles.  
Medications are given before chemotherapy to prevent nausea and vomiting.  All of the 
chemother apy drugs will be given intravenously (through a vein).  Oxaliplatin is given over 2 
hours; leucovorin is given over 2 hours, followed by 5- FU (5 -fluorouracil) given as a quick 
infusion, followed by 5- FU given as a constant infusion through a portable pump over the next 
46 hours.   
Schedule C - this treatment is given weekly for six weeks followed by a two- week break and is 
given for a total of three 8- week cycles.  All of the chemotherapy drugs will be given 
intravenously (through a vein).  Leucovorin is given over 2 hours; 5- FU (5 -fluorouracil) is given 
as a quick infusion after the start of the leucovorin.

Appendix I – Page 3 of 18  Schedule D - this is a two day treatment given every two weeks for four 2- week cycles, 
followed by combined radiation therapy and chemotherapy.  After  completion of radiation 
therapy, four more 2- week cycles of the chemotherapy will be given.  Medications are given 
before chemotherapy to prevent nausea and vomiting.  All of the chemotherapy drugs will be 
given intravenously (through a vein).  Irinotecan is given over 90 minutes; leucovorin is given 
over 2 hours, followed by 5- FU (5 -fluorouracil) given as a quick infusion, followed by 5- FU 
given as a constant infusion through a portable pump over the next 46 hours.   
Schedule E - this is a two day treatment given every two weeks for four 2- week cycles, 
followed by combined radiation therapy with chemotherapy.  After completion of radiation 
therapy, four more 2- week cycles of chemotherapy will be given.  Medications are given before 
chemotherapy to prevent nausea and vomiting. All of the chemotherapy drugs will be given 
intravenously (through a vein).  Oxaliplatin is given over 2 hours; leucovorin is given over 2 
hours, followed by 5- FU (5 -fluorouracil) given as a quick infusion, followed by 5- FU given as a 
constant infusion through a portable pump over the next 46 hours.   
Schedule F - this treatment is given weekly for six weeks followed by a two- week break.  One 
8-week cycle will be given followed by combined radiation therapy and chemotherapy.  After 
completion of radiation therapy, two more 8 -week cycles of chemotherapy will be given.  
All of the chemotherapy drugs will be given intravenously (through a vein). Leucovorin is given 
over 2 hours; 5 -FU (5 -fluorouracil)  is given as a quick infusion one hour af ter the start of the 
leucovorin  
If you take part in the study, you will have the following tests and procedures. Some of the  
tests required for this study would be done even if you did not participate in the study.   
 
• Female patients will have a pregnancy test.  
• You will receive a complete physical exam and be seen by a physician at the beginning of each cycle of treatment and weekly during the course of radiation.   
• Samples of your blood will be obtained, along with chest x -rays, CT scans or MRI to 
evaluate your health status.  
In addition, you will be asked to fill out brief forms with questions about your bowel function.  This will take about 10 to 15 minutes.  
If you are in the group receiving radiation therapy with 5- FU before  surgery, you will complete 
the questionnaire four (4) times:  
1. Prior to radiation therapy  
2. During the last week of radiation therapy  
3. Immediately prior to surgery  
4. Between 16 and 20 months following completion of radiation therapy  
 
If you joined the study after your surgery, but received radiation therapy with 5- FU prior to 
surgery, you will complete the questionnaire two (2) times:  
1. At registration  
2. Between 16 and 20 months following completion of radiation therapy

Appendix I – Page 4 of 18  If you are in the group receiving radiation therapy with 5 -FU after surgery (and between cycles 
of chemotherapy), you will complete the questionnaire five (5) times:  
1. Prior to surgery (if possible)  
2. Prior to beginning adjuvant postoperative chemotherapy  
3. Immediately prior to starting radiation therapy (RT)  
4. During the last week of RT 
5.  Between 16 and 20 months following completion of RT 
While you are on study, samples of your tissue, blood or bone marrow may be sent to a 
central laboratory to be examined by a central reviewer.  This review is to confirm the results 
of the local laboratory review.  
 
HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THE STUDY ? 
 
The actual treatment period on the study is approximately 8 months.  We would like to keep track of your medical condition for a period of 10 years after entering the study,  to look at the 
long-term effects of the treatment.  You may stop participating at any time; however, we 
encourage you to talk to your doctor first.   
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY ?  
 
While on the study, you are at risk for the following side effects.  The chemotherapy and the radiation may cause some, all or none of the side effects listed.  You should discuss these with 
your doctor.  There may also be other side effects that we cannot predict.  Other drugs will be 
given to make side effects less serious and less uncomfortable.  Many side effects go away 
shortly after the chemotherapy drugs are stopped, but in some cases side effects can be 
serious, long- lasting, permanent or life threatening.  Death is rare, but possible.  
Your physician will check you closely to see if any of these side effects are occurring and routine blood tests will be done to monitor the effects of treatment.

*Diarrhea can occur with most chemotherapy drugs, but it is more common with 
irinotecan. The diarrhea associated with irinotecan can happen at 2 different times. 
First, diarrhea can happen the day that you receive it (by vein), which can be treated with a single injection (shot) of a drug called atropine. The diarrhea can occur again, 
several days after the completion of the chemotherapy, and may last for several days. 
The best way to deal with this second occurrence is to notify your doctor immediately. 
Instructions will be given to you on how to treat the diarrhea.

Reproductive Risks  
 
Eastern Cooperative  E3201 
Oncology Group  REVISED  
Appendix I – Page 9 of 18  If you are pregnant or breast feeding, you cannot take part in this study.  If you are a 
woman who has not gone through menopause, you will take a blood test to see if you are 
pregnant before you start treatment.  If you are sexually active, your doctor strongly 
recommends that you take precautions to avoid the possibility of becoming pregnant 
because this therapy could kill or seriously damage an unborn child.  Sexually active males 
are also strongly advised to use an accepted and effective method of contraception.  For more information about risks and side effects, ask the researcher or contact  
______________________________________________________________ 
ARE THERE BENEFITS TO  TAKING PART IN THE S TUDY ? 
 
If you are taking part in this study, there may or may not be direct medical benefits to you.  If 
you receive study treatment and do not show any benefit, your doctor will discuss alternative 
treatments with you.  You have been told that, should your disease become worse, should side 
effects become very severe, should new scientific developments occur that indicate the 
treatment is not in your best interest or should your doctor feel that this treatment is no longer 
in your best interest, the treatment will be stopped.  Further treatment will be discussed.  
We hope the information learned in this study will benefit other patients with rectal cancer in the future.  
 
WHAT OTHER OPTIONS ARE THERE ? 
 
Instead of being in this study, you have these options: 
• Standard chemotherapy alone 
• Radiation therapy alone  
• Standard chemotherapy with radiation  
• No therapy, with care to help you feel more comfortable. Treatments will reduce 
symptoms, relieve pain, and maximize comfort, diginity and control. Treatment is 
not directed at curing, slowing, or reversing the disease.  
Your doctor can provide information about your disease and will be available to answer any questions about the research study .

Appendix I – Page 10 of 18  WHAT ABOUT CONFIDENTIALITY ?  
 
This study is conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG).  ECOG is a 
cancer group that conducts studies for the National Cancer Institute.  Your doctor is a member 
of ECOG or another group that is participating in this study.  To help protect your privacy, 
ECOG has obtained a Confidentiality Certificate from the Department of Health and Human 
Services (DHHS). 
 
With this Certificate, ECOG cannot be forced (for example, by court subpoena) to disclose 
information that may identify you in any federal, state or local civil, criminal, administrative, 
legislative or other proceedings.  Disclosure will be necessary, however, upon request of DHHS for audit or program evaluation purposes.  
 
You should understand that a Confidentiality Certificate does not prevent you or a member of 
your family from voluntarily releasing information about you or your involvement in this 
research.  Note, however, that if an insurer or employer learns about your participation and 
obtai ns your consent to receive research information, then ECOG may not use the Certificate 
of Confidentiality to withhold this information.  This means that you and your family must also 
actively protect your privacy.  
 
Your identifiable health information is also protected by the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule, which was issued by the Department of Health and 
Human Services. Except as required by law, ECOG will not be able to disclose identifiable health information, expected to be collected in this study to anyone other than you without your 
authorization, by a separate document you have signed or will be asked to sign.  
 
Finally, you should understand that your doctor and ECOG are not prevented from taking 
steps, including reporting to authorities, to prevent serious harm to yourself or others and the 
Certificate does not prevent the review of your research records under some circumstances by 
certain organizations for an internal program audit or evaluation.  Organizations that may 
inspect and/or copy your research records for quality assurance and data analysis include groups such as:  
 
• Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group  
• National Cancer Institute (NCI)  
• Cancer Trials Support Unit (CTSU) – an NCI -sponsored organization designed to 
increase accrula by provideing greater access to phase III trials. 
• Food and Drug Administration 
• Other regulatory agencies and/or their designated representatives  
• Drug manufacturers, and/or their representatives  
• NCI Central Institutional Review Boar d (CIRB)  
• Central laboratories, reviewers, banks

Appendix I – Page 14 of 18  SCIENTIFIC STUDIES  
This study includes laboratory tests  that will analyze small samples of your tissue.  The 
samples will be taken from the biopsy materials and/or the surgery tissue which has al ready 
been collected as a routine part of your diagnostic evaluation and surgical treatment.  If you 
participate in the laboratory studies associated with this protocol, some of the leftover tissue 
will be sent to a research laboratory  for analysis.  Researchers will be performing these 
tests in order to better understand the biology of rectal cancer.  They hope these studies 
will help them better understand this type of cancer.  The results of these tests will not be 
sent to you or your doctor and will not be used in planning your care.  These tests are only for research purposes and have no effect on your medical care.  The researchers have no 
access to your identity.  You and/or your insurance company will not be charged for these 
tests.  
 
 
Making Your Choice  
 
Please read the sentence below and think about your choice.  After reading the sentence, circle "Yes" or "No."  No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care.  You can

WILL ANY OF THE SAMPLES (E.G.  TISSUE ) TAKEN FROM ME BE USED FOR OTHER 
RESEARCH STUDIES ? 
About Using Tissue for Research  
If you participate in the laboratory studies associated with this protocol, some of the tissue 
biopsy material obtained for the clinical study will be sent to a central laboratory for 
analysis.  Slides of your bone marrow and blood may be submitted for central review to 
confirm local laboratory reviews.  
We would like to keep some of the bone marrow and tissue that is left over for future research.  If you agree, this bone marrow and tissue will be kept and may be used in 
research to learn more about cancer and other diseases.  This bone marrow and tissue will 
Eastern Cooperative  E3201 
Oncology Group  REVISED  
Appendix I – Page 15 of 18  only be given to researchers approved by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.  Any 
research done on the bone marrow and tissue must also be approved by the researcher's 
Institutional Review Board.  
Your bone marrow and tissue may be helpful for research whether you do or do not have 
cancer.  The research that may be done with your bone marrow and tissue will probably not 
help you.  It might help people who have cancer and other diseases in the future.  
 
Reports about research done with your bone marrow and tissue will not be given to you or 
your doctor.  These reports will not be put in your health record.  The research will not have 
an effect on your care.  
 
Things to Think About   
The choice to let us keep the left over bone marrow and tissue for future research is up to you.  No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care and you may still take part in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study.  
If you decide now that your bone marrow and tissue can be kept for research, you can 
change your mind at any time.  Just contact your study doctor and let him or her know that 
you do not want us to use your bone marrow and tissue.  Then the bone marrow and tissue will no longer be used for resear ch. It may be retained for diagnostic reviews related to the 
study. Tissue samples will be returned to the institutions upon written request. 
In the future, people who do research may need to know more about your health.  When 
the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group gives them reports about your health, it will not 
give them your name.  
Sometimes bone marrow and tissue are used for genetic research (about diseases that are passed on in families).  Even if your bone marrow and tissue are used for this kind of 
research, the results will not be put in your health records.  
Your bone marrow and tissue will be used only for research and will not be sold.  You will 
not be paid for allowing your leftover bone marrow and tissue to be used in research even 
though the re search done with your bone marrow and tissue may help to develop new 
products in the future.  Similarly there will be no cost to you for any bone marrow and tissue 
collected and stored by the  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group . 
 
It is possible that, at some time in the future, as part of deciding on what therapy to give 
you, a new test might be available that could be performed on some of the bone marrow 
and tissue now thought of as leftover.  This situation is unusual, but it could happen.  In 
order to see that not all the leftover bone marrow and tissue are used up, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group will take care to see that some of your bone marrow and 
tissue are stored for 10 years so that it is available should it be needed by you or your 
doctors .  This will depend upon the amount of left over bone marrow and tissue that is 
submitted for this study; however, there may not be any left over bone marrow and tissue to store.  
 
Eastern Cooperative  E3201 
Oncology Group  REVISED  
Appendix I – Page 16 of 18  Benefits  
The benefits of research using bone marrow and tissue include learning more about what 
causes cancer and other diseases, how to prevent them, how to treat them, and how to 
cure them.  
Risks  
There are very few risks to you from using your bone marrow and tissue for research. One 
is the release of information from your health records.  The Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group will protect your records so that your name will be kept private.  The chance that this 
information will be given to someone else is very small.  
 
Making Your Choice  
 
Please read each sentence below and think about your choice.  After reading each sentence, circle "Yes" or "No."  No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care .  
You can participate in the treatment part of the study without participating in all or part of 
the bone marrow and tissue research studies.  If you have any questions, please talk to

site at http://www.ecog.org . As this  is a personal letter, physicians may elect to further tailor the text to their 
situation.  
This small gesture is a part of a broader program being undertaken by ECOG and the NCI to increase 
awareness of the importance of clinical trials and improve accrual  and follow -through. We appreciate your 
help in this effort.

Cancert Trials Support Unit (CTSU) Participation Procedures 
REGISTRATION/RANDOMIZATION  
Prior to the recruitment of a patient for this study, investigators must be registered members of the CTSU. 
Each investigator must have an NCI investigator number and must maintain an “active” investigator 
registration status through the annual submission of a complete investigator registration packet (FDA Form 1572 with original signature, current CV, Supplemental Investigator Data Form with signature and Financial Disclosure Form with original signature) to the Pharmaceutical Management Branch, CTEP, DCTD, NCI. These forms are available on the CTSU registered member web site or by calling the PMB at 301- 496-5725 
Monday through Friday between 8.30 am and 4.30 pm Eastern time. Each CTSU investigator or group of 
investigators at a clinical site must obtain IRB approval for this protocol and submit all IRB/regulatory 
documents to the CTSU before they can enroll patients. All forms and documents associated with this study can be downloaded from the E3201 Web page on the CTSU registered member Web site (http://members.ctsu.or g). Patients can be registered only after pre- treatment evaluation is complete, all 
eligibility criteria have been met, and all pertinent forms and documents are approved and on file with the 
CTSU.  
Requirements for E3201 site registration : 
• CTSU IRB Certification  
• IRB/Regulatory Approval Transmittal Form  
• IRB-approved consent form  
• Radiation Therapy Facility Inventory Form  
Requirements for patient enrollment  on E3201  
• Patient must meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria should apply.  
• Patient signed and dated consent.  
• All baseline laboratory tests and prestudy evaluations performed.  
• Pathology materials submitted per Section 10.0 (provided patient has given consent)  
• Patient completed baseline QOL forms.  
 CTSU PROCEDURES FOR PATIENT ENROLLMENT  
 The choice of pre- operative chemo/XRT (GROUP I) versus post -operati ve chemo/XRT (GROUP II) is at the 
discretion of the treating physician and must be declared at the time of registration.  The physician must also 
identify the surgical procedure to be performed.  (See Section 5.0 for details.) Please refer to Section 3 for  
explanation of Group I PS.  
 GROUP I patients are registered but not randomized until 21- 56 days from date of total resection.  
GROUP I PS (patients who have received chemotherapy/RT and surgery per protocol) are registered and randomized at the same time.  
GROUP II patients are registered and randomized at the same time. Treatment should start within five (5) working days after registration/randomization.  
 
Registration instructions for Group I (including Group I PS) and II patients and Randomization instructions for 
Group I PS and II patients:  
Contact the CTSU Patient Registration Office by calling 1- 888-462-3009 to alert the CTSU Patient Registrar

REGULATORY  COMPLIANCE AND MONITORING  
Study Audit  
To assure compliance with Federal regulatory requirements [CFR 21 parts 50, 54, 56, 312, 314 and HHS 45 CFR 46] and National Cancer Institute (NCI)/ Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) Clinical Trials Monitoring Branch (CTMB) guidelines for the conduct of clinical trials and study data validity, all protocols approved by NCI/CTEP that have patient enrollment through the CTSU are subject to audit.  
Responsibility for assignment of the audit will be determined by the site’s primary affiliation with a Cooperative Group or CTSU. For Group- aligned sites, the audit of a patient registered through CTSU will 
become the responsibility of the Group receiving credit for the enrollment. For CTSU Independent Clinical Research Sites (CICRS), the CTSU will coordinate the entire audit process.  
For patients enrolled through the CTSU, you may request the accrual be credited to any Group for which you have an affiliation provided that Group has an active clinical trials program for the primary disease type being 
addressed by the protocol. (e.g., NSABP members may only request credit for protocols pertaining to breast 
or colorectal cancers).  Registrations to protocols for other disease sites may still take place through CTSU without receiving credit for your NSABP activities.  Per capita reimbursement will be issued directly from CTSU.  
Details on audit evaluation components, site selection, patient case selection, materials to be reviewed, site 
preparation, on- site procedures for review and assessment, and results reporting and follow -up are available 
for download from the CTSU Operations Manual located on the CTSU Member Web site.  
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)  
The HIPAA Privacy Rule establishes the conditions under which protected health information may be used or 
disclosed by covered entities for research purposes. Research is defined in the Privacy Rule referenced in 
HHS 45 CFR 164.501. Templated language addressing NCI -U.S. HIPAA guidelines are provided in the 
HIPAA Authorization Form located on the CTSU website.  
The HIPAA Privacy Rule does not affect participants from outside the United States. Authorization to release 
Protected Health Information is NOT required from patients enrolled in clinical trials at non- US sites.  
Clinical Data Update System (CDUS) Monitoring  
This study will be monitored by the Clinical Data Update System (CDUS) Version 3.0.  Cumulative CDUS data will be submitted quarterly to CTEP by electronic means. The sponsoring Group fulfills this reporting 
obligation by electronically transmitting to CTEP the CDUS data collected from the study -specific case report 
forms.  Rev. 3/07

Diarrhea Management Instructions  
How to Manage Diarrhea  
 
While you are receiving the chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy, you may experience diarrhea.  In 
some individuals, diarrhea has been severe.  Therefore, it is important that you follow the instructions noted below if you experience diarrhea while being treated.  
 
What Is Diarrhea?  
 
Diarrhea is when your bowel movements are loose or watery and more frequent than is usual for you.  In order to 
help manage the diarrhea that your treatment may cause, you will need to keep track of your bowel movements.  Keeping a diary may be the easiest way to do this.  The diary should record how many bowel movem ents you have 
during the day, when they occur and the consistency of the stool (formed, loose or watery).  Having diarrhea for a long period of time can result in problems such as dehydration.  It is best to treat it early when it first begins.  You 
should contact you doctor or nurse if you begin experiencing this side effect.  
 
What Do I Take To Stop the Diarrhea?  
 
The medication used to treat the diarrhea is called loperamide.  The most common brand of loperamide is Imodium.  Loperamide comes in the form of a 2 milligram (mg) caplet and is available without a prescription 
at most pharmacies and grocery stores in the health and beauty aids section.  
 
The loperamide may cause some side effects.  These side effects are drowsiness, tiredness and dizziness.  It is important to avoid driving motorized vehicles or operating machinery if you experience any of these side 
effects.  
 
When Should I Start Taking the Loperamide and For How Long?  
 At the first sign of diarrhea you will need to begin taking loperamide (Imodium) according to the directions below. (These will differ from the usual instructions found on the label.) If you do not start taking loperamide right away, severe diarrhea can occur that could require hospitalization.  It is also important to stop taking any laxatives (medications to treat constipation such as milk of magnesia, Colace, Dulcolax, or Senakot).  
 
Please follow these instructions carefully : 
 
• Take two caplets (4 mg) at the first sign of any change in your normal bowel movement as 
described above.  
• Continue taking one caplet (2 mg) every 2 hours until you have returned to your normal pattern of 
bowel movements for at least 12 hours.  It is important to continue taking the loperamide even 
during the night.  However, during the night you can take two caplets (4mg) every four hours 
instead of one caplet (2 mg) every two hours.  
• Be sure to drink plenty of fluids each day (several glasses of water, fruit juice, soda, soup, etc).  It is 
important to try to replace fluid that is being lost because of the diarrhea. This will help prevent Rev. 11/05

Appendix IX – Page 2 of 2 dehydration and will not cause more diarrhea.  You should avoid caffeinated beverages (coffee, tea, 
cola), alcoholic beverages and dairy products.  
• Avoid high roughage foods like high- fiber cereals containing bran or whole grain, broccoli, cabbage, 
beans, fresh vegetables or fruit, fried food, chocolate or doughnuts.  
 Please call your doctor or nurse if you have any questions about taking loperamide, if your diarrhea does not improve, or if you experience new symptoms.

Protocol [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Page 3 of 15 1.0 DEVICE DESCRIPTION 
The Hydrus Aqueous Implant is a crescent -shaped implantable device pre -loaded onto a  
hand- held delivery system.  The Implant is delivered into Schlemm's canal by inserting 
the cannula of the delivery system through the trabecular meshwork and advancing the 
implant through the cannula.  Once the implant is in position, the central core wir e of the 
delivery system is retracted, allowing complete detachment of the Hydrus Aqueous Implant.  Upon implantation, the crescent -shaped device provides a support structure, 
serving to dilate and restore the natural aqueous outflow pathway through Schlem m's 
canal, leading to a reduction of intraocular pressure. 
The Hydrus Aqueous Implant is composed of nitinol, a metal alloy composed of nearly 
equal parts of nickel (Ni) and titanium (Ti).   Nitinol has been used extensively in a 
variety of implantable vascular and orthopedic devices for its proven properties of flexibility, strength and biocompatibility.  As a shape memory alloy, nitinol has super elastic properties making it suitable as a support structure in Schlemm's canal.  Its 
flexibility and small size allow delivery of the Hydrus  through torturous, restrictive 
passages with minimal force.  The Hydrus  Aqueous Implant is illustrated in Figure 1, on 
the following page .

2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVE  AND DESIGN  
The objective of this clinical trial is to compare the effectiveness of one Hydrus to two iStents  for lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with mild -to-moderate primary 
open angle glaucoma (POAG) , pseudoexfoliative glaucoma (PXG), or pigmentary 
glaucoma (PG) . 
 
This study is a prospective, multicenter, single masked, randomized, clinical trial in which a total of 160 subjects ( 80 per study arm) will be treated  with either one Hydrus or 
two iStents  for treatment of POAG , PXG, or PG  in subjects with a phakic  lens.  The 
study will be conducted according the Declaration of Helsinki.  All study subjects must sign the Informed Consent prior to initiating participation in the study.  
 
Key inclusion criteria for this study are a diagnosis of POAG , PXG, or PG  based on optic 
nerve neuropathy, an open angle, and elevated IOP  of 23- 39 mmHg  in the absence of 
hypotensive medications .  In order to address the confounding effect of medications on 
the IOP -reducing ability of the devices, a "wash -out" of all glaucoma medications will be 
conducted, and a ‘diurnal’ methodology will be utilized to determine the subject’s 
eligibility .  The duration of wash- out will be determined by the specific medication(s) 
used. 
 
Upon successfully meeting the study inclusion/exclusion criteria, subjects will be 
scheduled for surgery.  Randomization will take place on the day of surgery just prior to treatment.  Randomization sequence will be based on pre -determined computer -generated 
lists. 
 
   
 
Ivantis, Inc.  
Protocol [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Page 5 of 15 Follow up will be continued for 2 years post -surgery, and will i nclude assessments of the 
subject 's IOP, ocular health, and visual acuity status.  Visits will be conducted at 1, 7, 30, 
180, 365, 540, and 730 days.  
 In the event a study subject does  not respond to device therapy, h ypotensive  glaucoma 
medications may be prescribed in order t o reduce IOP to a safe level, as determined by 
the judgment of the attending physician.  Medications of the same type used prior to wash out will be re -started in this event.  Re -medication will not be considered an adverse 
event, but will be monitored.  Neither the Hydrus nor the iStent devices preclude the ability to later perform filtration surgery, in the event medications do not lower pressure adequately  and more invasive therapy is required.  
 
3.0 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
The primary effectiven ess endpoint for this study is  the proportion subjects with IOP 
≤19 mmHg and without the use of ocular hypotensive medications at 12 months , as 
measured by Goldmann tonometry . 
 
Secondary effectiveness endpoints include : 
• The proportion of subjects who are are not using ocular hypotensive medications at 
12 and 24 months , as measured by Goldmann tonometry  
• Mean medication use at 12 and 24 months  
• The proportion subjects with IOP ≤19 mmHg and  without the use of ocular 
hypotensive medications at 24  months , as measured by Goldmann tonometry  
 
Safety endpoints include:  
• Frequency of loss in BCVA of 2 lines or more at 12 and 24 months, 
• Slit lamp and fundus examination findings  at 12 and 24 months, 
• Frequency of complications and adverse events at all follow up periods.  
 4.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  
4.1 Study Hypothesis  
A 20% or greater reduction in the proportion of subjects requiring ocular hypotensive medications to reach a target IOP of 19 mmHg or less is a clinically significant treatment effect.  
 4.2 Sample Size  
The study size is based on the primary endpoint.  
 4.3 Safety Analysis  
Safety data (adverse events, visual acuity  measurements , perimetry,  and ocular health 
findings  based on slit lamp and fundus examinations ) will be evaluated using descriptive 
 
Ivantis, Inc.  
Protocol [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Page 6 of 15 statistics.  F requency tabulations of safety outcomes will be performed for 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 
and 24- month follow up periods.  Safety analysis cohorts will be grouped by actual 
treatment.  The study is not designed to detect differences in safety outcomes.

6.0 STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 Subject Entry, Consent and Enrollment  
Participants will be recruited from the In vestigators’ patient population or referrals.  
Patients that appear to be eligible will be approached for study participation and sign a 
patient informed consent (PIC)  prior to the commencement of study related procedures.  
 The investigator or designee will explain the study purpose, procedures, and subject responsibilities to the potential participant.  The subject should be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided.  The subject’s willingness and ability to meet the follow -up requirements will be determined.  When it 
has been established that the subject is eligible for possible enrollment into the study, written informed consent will be obtained.  One copy of the informed consent form will be retained with the subject’s medical records, an d one copy will be provided to the 
subject.  
 Only one qualified eye per qualified subject may be randomized for treatment .  If both 
eyes qualify for enrollment, the eye with the worse best corrected visual acuity will b e 
designated as the study eye.  
 
 
Ivantis, Inc.  
Protocol [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Page 8 of 15 6.2 Medication Wash Out  
After the subject has successfully completed the preoperative screening exam, he or she will be instructed to discontinue any ocular hypotensive medications in the designated treatment eye for the appropriate washout period, as listed in Table 1, prior to the Baseline Exam.  If upon washout, the subject experiences an IOP elevation to greater 
than 39 mmHg, or requires the reintroduction of hypotensive medications  or a surgical 
intervention during the preoperative period , the subject will be treated appropriately and 
excluded  from the study .  Any subject whose IOP does not fall within 23- 39 mmHg will 
be exited from the study.

6.3 Goldmann Tonometry Procedure  
At the baseline,  IOP will be assessed using d iurnal  Goldmann tonometry , after wash -out 
of hypotensive medications.  In this study, 3 IOP readings will be taken during daylight 
hours as follows:   
o Time 1:  9 :00 AM (± 1 hour)  
 
Ivantis, Inc.  
Protocol [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Page 9 of 15 o Time 2:  4 hours later (± 1 hour) than  Time 1  
o Time 3:  4 hours later (± 1 hour) than  Time 2  
 A minimum of 2 IOP readings are to be taken at each time point.  If the first two IOP 
values at a time point are more than 2 mm apart, then a third reading should be taken.  
 
To calculate the mean diurnal IOP, the mean IOP value from each time point is used to calculate a grand average.  In the event one or more of the time points requires a third IOP reading, then the median IOP of that time point is used for the calculation of the mean diurnal IOP.  
 IOP readings taken at screening and at all other follow u p visits will be taken once during 
the visit at 9 AM ± 2 hour s.  A minimum of 2 IOP readings are to be taken.  The mean of 
these readings will be used for the IOP value at that visit.  If the first two IOP readings are more than 2 mm apart, then a third re ading should be taken. In this case the median of 
the 3 values will be used as the value for the visit. 
 
If the subject meets all criteria at the Baseline visit, he or she will be  scheduled for 
surgery within 21 days of this visit.  On the day of surgery, the subject  will be 
randomized to either the Hydrus group or iStent group.  Computer -generated 
randomization lists will be used, with separate randomizatio n lists for each clinical site.  
The subject will not be informed of the randomization assignment and all study personnel 
will be instructed to maintain the “masking” of the treatment assignments.  
 
6.4 Surgical Procedure  
After the subject’s group is identified, the patient should receive one Hydrus or two iStents  for the study eye .  The surgical procedure to implant either the Hydrus or iStent 
devices should be performed according to the manufacturer’s  Instructions  for Use.  
Surgery may be performed under either local or topical ophthalmic anesthesia.  
 
6.5 Perioperative Medication  
A topic al antibiotic and a topical steroid  will be administered  after surgery.  The 
following dosing regimen is recommended:  
 1. Moxifloxacin 0.5% (Vigamox® or equivalent ), one drop four times per day 
commencing the day of the procedure and continued for approximately one week postoperatively.  
2. Prednisolone acetate 1.0% (Pred Forte®  or equivalent ), one drop four times per day 
for one week; followed by one drop three times per day for one week; followed b y 
one drop two times per day for one week; followed by one drop once per day for one week, then discontinue. 
 
 
Ivantis, Inc.  
Protocol [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Page 10 of 15 Medication to treat transient post -operative spikes in IOP resulting from the use of 
viscoelastic and surgical manipulation may be required in the  immediate postoperative 
period, as described below .  
 6.6 Study Visits  and Examination Schedule  
All subjects will participate in defined follow -up visits through 24 months.  A Case 
Report Form (CRF) shall be completed for each scheduled exam.  Unscheduled or interim visits should also be recorded using the appropriate CRF.  
 
The procedures associated with each study visit are outlined and summarized in Appendix 1 (Schedule of Events and Procedures).  
 
6.7 Unscheduled Visits  
Any visit to the clinic al site, other than those specified in the protocol, at which the 
subject has a complaint regarding the study eye and/or treatment to the study eye is required or changed will be documented as an unscheduled visit .  The Investigator and/or 
qualified invest igational staff will perform the procedures necessary to evaluate the study 
participant at these visits, and will record the visit in the subject’s chart and on an interim CRF.  No specific testing is required at interim visit.  
 
6.8 Postoperative Ocular Hypotensive Medications  
Since the implantation procedure  involves the use of an ophthalmic viscoelastic agent  and 
post-operative  steroids, both of  which are known to cause IOP elevation  in some cases , 
use of glaucoma medications in the first month after surgery is expected .  The first line 
hypotensive medication in the imme diate post -operative period (0 -60 days) should be 
selected from the beta blocker class  (if tolerated) as indicated in the table below .  In these 
cases, additional visits may be p erformed to assess IOP, and medications discontinued if 
the patient’s  IOP allows . 
 
Long term medical therapy (defined as medications prescribed at or after the 90 -day visit) 
may be implemented at the Investigator’s discretion in order to maintain a safe IOP. 
 Patient medication usage (medication class, dose, frequency, and brand, if applicable) will be collected at the time of screening.  The medications should be assigned a  rank 
order for the purpose of potential reintroduction.  If post -operative IOP incr eases to an 
unsafe level , ocular hypotensive medications should be reintroduced one at a tim e and 
following the order indicated at screening.  
 If a medication prescribed in the immediate post- operative period does not match the 
class indicated on the screening list and is continued to the 3 month visit, then the subject should be switched to the pre -surgical medication class and dose if possible. 
 
 
Ivantis, Inc.  
Protocol [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Page 11 of 15 Reintroduction of ocular hypotensive medication will be recorded in the appropriate Case Report Form, along with the clinical rationale for the decision to apply medications.  A  
record of all medications added, discontinued or changed will be documented on the appropriate Case Report Form . 
 Because the use of ocular hypotensive medications to control IOP is a study endpoint, the CRF describing the introduction or discontinuation will be reviewed by the Medical Monitor for appropriateness and consistency acr oss study groups.  The Medical Monitor 
will be masked to the identity of the treatment subject.  
 6.9 Subject Disposition  
Subjects may be terminated (exited) from the study early due to:  
 
• Screen ing failure , 
• A threat to the subject’s health emerges in the course of following study procedures,  
• Inability to continue with the study, and  
• Voluntar y withdrawal.  
 
Subjects who are terminated due to screening  failure will not be followed beyond the date 
of screen ing failure.  For safety reasons, randomized subjects who are terminated should 
receive routine clinical follow up until the planned end of  the study period.  CRF’s will 
not be completed for terminated subjects.  Terminated subjects will not be replaced.  Notification of a subject’s early termination should be made immediately to the sponsor and documented on the appropriate CRF.  
 Completed subjects are those subjects who have not been terminated from the study  prior 
to completion of follow up. 
 7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
All ocular adverse events (AE)  in the study eye must be reported on the adverse event 
CRF.  The Investigator must categorize each AE by degree of harm to the subject (mild, moderate, or severe), and the relationship to study device and implantation procedure (not related, possibly, probably, or definitely).  Since there are no aspects of the study that can affect both eyes, only serious adverse events observed in the fellow eye will be captured on the case report form throughout the course of the study.  
 Ocular conditions or diseases that are chronic bu t stable and meet the inclusion and 
exclusion  criteria should be recorded on the screening CRF under Ocular History.  
Changes in any chronic condition or disease that are consistent with natural disease progression are not considered AEs a nd will not be recorded on an AE CRF.  
 
 
Ivantis, Inc.  
Protocol [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Page 12 of 15 7.1 Anticipated Adverse Events  
Anticipated AEs associated with glaucoma and/or cataract surgical procedures that might reasonably be expected to occur in this study are listed below.  These specific examples of anticipate d AEs include, but are not limited to:  
 
7.2 Intraoperative Adverse Events  
• Hyphema obscuring the surgeon’s view  
• Choroidal hemorrhage or effusion

• Endophthalmitis  
• Persistent hyphema of >2 mm present > 1 week  postoperative  
• Corneal opacification

• Corneal edema persisting >1 month (mild to moderate corneal edema prior to 1 month postoperative is not considered an adverse event)  
• Retinal complications (flap tears, retinal detachment, or proliferative vitreoretinopathy)  
• IOP spike (e levated mean IOP ≥10 mmHg above the qualifying baseline mean IOP 
more than  1 month postoperative ) 
• Events resulting in an unplanned ocular surgical re -intervention (other than 
paracentesis to relieve pressure prior to 1 week postoperative)  
• Phthisis  
• Significant foreign body sensation at or after 3 months postoperative

Ivantis, Inc.  
Protocol [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Page 13 of 15 • A 2-point worsening to 4+ anterior chamber cells or flare at or after 3 months 
postoperative, not associated with a pre -existing condition  
• A 2-point worsening to severe on the slit lamp examination findings (other than cells 
and flare) at or after 3 months postoperative not associated with a pre -existing 
condition 
• A 2-point worsening of ocular symptoms to severe or very severe at or after 3 months 
postoperative not associated with a pre -existing condition  
 
7.4 Recording and Reporting Adverse Ev ents 
To improve the quality and precision of acquired AE data, Investigators should observe the following guidelines:  
 
• Whenever possible, use recognized medical terms when recording AEs on the AE 
CRF.  Do not use colloquialisms and/or abbreviations. 
• For the purposes of reporting infection/inflammation, the following terms and 
definitions should be used:  
 
Iritis:  Presence of inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber, with or 
without anterior vitreous inflammation.   
• The presence of aqueous flare alone will not be considered 
to constitute iritis.  
• For the purposes of this protocol, the term "iritis" will 
encompass b oth cases of iritis without anterior vitreous 
inflammation (iritis) and those with anterior vitreous 
inflammation (iridocyclitis).  
 
Iridocyclitis : Presence of inflammatory cells in both the aqueous and vitreous.  
 
Vitritis :   Presence of active inflammation in the vitreous, as demonstrated 
by the presence of inflammatory cells (trace or greater) involving the 
mid-vitreous cavity.  
• The presence of inflammation involving only the anterior 
vitreous will not be considered to constit ute vitritis because 
it may result from iridocyclitis (see above).  
• Active inflammation in the vitreous should be clinically 
differentiated from cellular debris from prior episodes of 
inflammation, hemorrhage, or other causes.  
• The presence of vitreous flare  alone in the absence of active 
inflammatory cells will not be considered to constitute 
vitritis.  
Endophthalmitis : Diffuse intraocular inflammation predominantly involving the 
vitreous cavity but also involving the anterior chamber, implying a 
suspected underlying infectious cause, if known; record the 
diagnosis (i.e., disease or syndrome) rather than component signs 
and symptoms on AE pages of the CRF.  
 
 
Ivantis, Inc.  
Protocol [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Page 14 of 15 7.5 Grading of AEs  
AEs are to be graded on a three- point scale (mild, moderate, severe) and reported in detail 
on the appropriate AE CRF.  The definitions are as follows:  
 
• Mild:  Discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity  
• Moderate:   Discomfo rt sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity  
• Severe:   Incapacitating with inability to work or perform normal daily activity , and any 
event  resulting in death or  requiring rehospitalization  
 
7.6 Adverse Events Requiring Expedited Reporting  
Investigators must report all SAEs to Ivantis  within 48 hours of observing or learning of 
the event.  For initial SAE reports, investigators should record all case details that can be 
gathered within 48 hours on the adverse event  CRF.   SAEs require expedit ed reporting to 
the Sponsor or designee regardless of relationship to the implanted devices . 
 7.7 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  
An Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) means any serious adverse effect (as 
defined above) on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 Any UADE must be reported in writing  to the Sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of 
that event.  The Spons or wil l be responsible for informing regulatory a uthorities and all 
other Medical Ethics Committees/ IRBs and Investigators participating in the study of the 
UADE.

Protocol Synopsis  
Title:   A Phase 3 Randomized, Double -blind, Placebo -controlled, Parallel -group Study to 
Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Denosumab in Pediatric Subjects With 
Glucocorticoid -induced Osteoporosis  
Study Phase:   3 
Indication:   Glucocorticoid -induced Osteoporosis  
Primary Objective :  To evaluate the effect of denosumab on lumbar spine bone mineral density 
(BMD) Z -score as assessed by dual-energy X -ray absorptiometry ( DXA) at 12  months in children 
5 to 17  years of age with Glucocorticoid (GC) -induced osteoporosis ( GiOP). 
Secondary Objective(s):   To evaluate the effect of denosumab in children 5  to 17  years of age 
with GiOP with respect to:  
 Change in lumbar spine BMD Z -score as assessed by DXA from baseline to 6, 18, 24, 
and 36  months  
 Change in proximal femur BMD Z -score as assessed by DXA from baseline to 6, 12, 18, 
24, and 36  months  
 Incidence of X -ray confirmed long -bone fractures and new and worsening vertebral 
fractures during 12, 24, and 36  months  
 Incidence of improving vertebral fractures at 12, 24, and 36  months  compared to 
baseline   
 Incidence of new and worsening vertebral and nonvertebral fractures during 12, 24, 
and 36  months  
 Change in Childhood Health Questionnaire – Parent Form -50 (CHQ -PF-50) Physical 
Summary Score at 12, 24, and 36  months  
 Change in CHQ -PF-50 Psychological Summary Score at 12, 24, and 36  months  
 Change in Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) Disability Index Score at 
12, 24, and 36  months  
 Change in Wong -Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBFPRS)  at 12, 24, and 36  months  
 Change in growth velocity, determined by calculating age -adjusted Z -scores for height, 
weight, and body mass index (BMI), at 12, 24, and 36  months  
 Serum concentration  of denosumab at 1 and 10  days, and 6, 12, and 18  months 
(additional serum denosumab pharmacokinetics [PK] samples to be collected at day  30 
and month  3 in a PK/ substudy of up to 15 subjects)  
Hypotheses:   The hypothesis of this s tudy is that the change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD 
Z-score following 12 months of denosumab treatment in children 5 to 17 years of age with GiOP 
will be greater than placebo.  
Primary Endpoint:   Change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD Z -score as ass essed by DXA at 
12 months  
Secondary Endpoint(s):   
 Change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD Z -score as assessed by DXA at 6, 18, 24, 
and 36  months  
 Change from baseline in proximal femur BMD Z -score as assessed by DXA at 6, 12, 18, 
24, and 36  months  
 Subject  incidence of X -ray confirmed long -bone fractures and new and worsening 
vertebral fractures during  12, 24, and 36  months  
 Subject incidence of improving vertebral fractures at 12, 24, and 36  months compared to 
baseline

Exploratory Endpoint(s):   
Study Design:   This is a phase  3 multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
parallel group study in pediatric subjects, age 5 to 17  years, with GiOP.  Twenty -four subjects 
including at least 16 evaluable subjects for the primary analysis will be enrolled.  Subjects will be 
randomized in a 2:1  (active:placebo) allocation ratio to receive either denosumab 1  mg/kg body 
weight (BW) (up to a maximum of 60  mg) subcutaneous (SC) every 6  months (Q6M) or matching 
placebo SC Q6M.  Up to 15 subjects  at selected sites will be given the opportunity to participate 
in a PK/  substudy.  The study is comprised of 2  periods, a 24 -month treatment period 
(including a 12 -month placebo -controlled period and a 12 -month open -label period) and a 12 -
month off -treatm ent observation period.  At the end of the first 12  months of the placebo -
controlled treatment period, all subjects will receive open -label denosumab Q6M for 12  months .  
Upon completion of the 24 -month treatment period, the 12 -month observation period will  begin.  
Daily supplements of calcium and vitamin D will be given to all subjects during the 24 -month 
treatment period.  Daily supplements of calcium and vitamin D may also be given to subjects 
during the 12 -month observation period, if deemed medically wa rranted by the investigator.  The 
planned length of participation in the study for an individual subject is approximately 3  years, 
which includes screening (up to 35  days), treatment phase (24  months), and off -treatment 
observation period (12  months).  The  anticipated dropout rate is approximately 10 in the first 
year.   
Treatment Period  
The treatment period will last for 24  months  including 12 -month double -blind and 12 -month 
open -label treatment .  During the first 12  months of the treatment period,  subjec ts will receive 
either denosumab 1  mg/kg BW (up to a maximum of 60  mg) SC Q6M or matching placebo SC 
Q6M.  At the end of the first 12  months of the treatment period, all subjects will receive open -label 
denosumab Q6M for 12  months .  The last dose of study medication will be administered at 
month  18. 
Observation Period  
The observation period will start immediately after the 24 -month treatment period and last 
12 months, during which study subjects will receive no investigational product.  Study subjects 
are to be followed up during the 12 -month observation period according to the following 
guidelines:

Investigational Product  
Amgen Investigational Product Dosage and Administration:  Subjects will be randomized to 
receive denosumab or placebo every 6  months in a 2:1 allocation ratio for the first 12  months.  At 
the end of the initial 12 -month period, all subjects will receive open -label denosumab Q6M for a 
further 12  months.  All subjects will receive investigational product through month 18.  
Denosumab will be administered at a dose of 1  mg/kg BW (up to a maximum of 60  mg).   
Denosumab and placebo will be manufactured and packaged by Amgen Inc.  Denosumab will be 
presented as a 70  mg/mL solution containing 1.7  mL in a 3  mL vial.  Placebo will be presented as 
a solution identical in appearance to denosumab, without the active in gredient.  All subjects will 
receive a SC injection of investigational product every 6  months for 24  months (last injection to be 
administered at month 18).  All SC injections must be administered by authorized site personnel.  
The injection should not be administered in the same arm from which blood is drawn.  
Investigational product should be administered only after all other study visit procedures have 
been completed.  If a subject misses a scheduled dose of denosumab during a study visit, then 
he/she sh ould return to the clinic to receive the missed dose within the visit window allowed for 
that particular visit.  The clinical monitor should be contacted for specific instructions if a subject 
cannot receive his/her dose within the allowed visit window.  
Procedures:   Key procedures for this study involve various imaging techniques.   Bone 
densitometry assessments of the lumbar spine and proximal femur performed by DXA, lateral 
radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar spine, anteroposterior (AP) radiographs of b oth knees (to 
calculate the metaphyseal index Z -score of each knee), and dental radiographs will be used to 
assess GiOP in this pediatric population.  Subjects will also undergo a visual inspection of the 
oral cavity to look for the presence of unerupted m olars.   
Several instruments will be used to assess the subject’s health -related quality of life, physical 
functioning, and pain intensity:  the CHQ -PF-50, CHAQ, and the WBFPRS.

Section  7 and the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2).   
Statistical Considerations:    
Sample Size Considerations : 
The study will enroll 24 subjects.  Assuming that approximately 10  of subjects will not be 
evaluable at month 12 for the primary efficacy endpoint due to dropout, the a nalysis set for the 
primary efficacy endpoint will include approximately 20  subjects.   
Analyses : 
The primary analysis will be conducted at the time of the final analysis.  The final analysis for the 
study, including the analysis of the primary endpoint, w ill be performed when all enrolled subjects 
have had the opportunity to complete the 36 -month follow -up. 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD Z -score at 
12 months and will be analyzed based on the primary DXA analysis set using an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) model including treatment (denosumab vs placebo), baseline age (age at 
informed consent), and baseline BMD Z -score.  Missing baseline and postbaseline BMD Z -scores 
will not  be imputed.  The superiority of denosumab compared to placebo for the primary efficacy 
endpoint will be estimated from the 12 -month least -squares (LS) mean of the treatment difference 
(denosumab – placebo) and the corresponding 95  confidence interval.  
For a full description of stati stical analysis methods, please refer to Section 10.

1.4 Exploratory  
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Disease  
Glucocorticoid (GC) -induced osteoporosis (GiOP) is the most common condition of 
medication -induced bone loss in children (Ward et al, 2010).  Glucocorticoid -induced 
osteoporosis is the result of profound effects of GCs on bone cells, which include 
inhibition of osteoblastogenesis and promotion of osteoblast apoptosis, resulting in 
significant reductions in bone formation, as well as increase in osteoclast -mediated bone 
resorption (Leonard, 2007; Ward, 2005; Canalis et al, 2004; Bianchi, 2002; 
Weinstein  et al, 1998).  Decreased BMD has been described in various pediatric 
disorders that require GCs, such as asthma,  juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory 
bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and organ transplantation 
(Burnham  and Leonard, 2004; Daniels et al, 2003; Leonard and Zemel, 2002; 
Boot et al, 1997).  Some of the detrimental bone effects attribute d to GCs may be 
caused by the underlying inflammatory disease being treated with GCs.  Inflammatory 
cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor -, known to be increased in rheumatoid 
arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and inflammatory bowel disease, suppress bone 
formation and promote bone resorption (Parfitt et al, 1996).  The GC -induced decrease 
in bone mass is associated with an increase in fracture risk.  A population -based study 
reported increased fracture risk (adjusted odds ratio: 1.32; 95  confidence interval:  
1.03, 1.69) in children who required  4 courses of glucocorticoids (van Staa et al, 2003).  
There are currently no widely accepted guidelines for or approaches to the treatment of 
osteoporosis in the pediatric population.  Bisphosphonate s (BP) are not licensed for the 
treatment of osteoporosis in children, but they have been evaluated in exploratory 
clinical studies in the setting of childhood osteoporosis.   Most BP studies in pediatric 
GiOP have shown significant increases in either BMD Z-scores (Inoue et al, 2008; 
Acott  et al, 2005) or lumbar spine BMD (Simm et al, 2011; Bianchi et al, 2000).  

Product:  Denosumab  
Protocol Number:  20140444  
Date:  10 July 2023  Page 21 of 94 
CONFIDENTIAL    
However, based on a 2010  Cochrane review, there is not sufficient evidence to support 
BP use as standard therapy for pediatric GiOP (Ward et al, 2 010).   Thus, an unmet need 
remains in children with GiOP.  
2.2 Amgen Investigational Product Background  
Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and 
specificity to and neutralizes the activity of the receptor activator of nuc lear factor 
kappa - B ligand  (RANKL), preventing activation of its receptor, RANK, on the surface of 
osteoclast precursors and osteoclasts.  Denosumab is currently indicated for the 
treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, treatment of men with 
osteoporosis, treatment of bone loss in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for 
prostate cancer, and treatment of bone loss in women receiving aromatase inhibitor 
therapy for breast cancer.  
2.3 Pediatric Risk Assessment  
This pediatric study involves gre ater than minimal risk, but presents the prospect of 
direct benefit to the subject.  Pediatric subjects treated with denosumab in this study are 
expected to have a risk profile comparable to that observed in adults.  Additional 
information on specific risk s in this pediatric population is provided in Sections 2.3.1  
through 2.3.6 .  The extensive denosumab clinical development program includes pivotal 
phase  3 studies in bone loss settings in adults, ie postmenopausal women with 
osteoporosis (Study  20030216) or low bone mass (Study  20040132); bone l oss 
associated with androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer (Study  20040138) or 
aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer (Study  20040135); men with osteoporosis 
(Study  20080098), and in adult subjects with GiOP (Study  20101217 [Saag  et al, 2018]).  
There is an ongoing study in pediatric subjects with osteogenesis imperfecta 
(Study  20130173).  In addition, denosumab has been studied in adolescent subjects with 
giant cell tumor of bone at a dose of 120  mg every 4  weeks (Study  20062004).  
In clini cal studies to date, there has been a comparable incidence of adverse events 
overall between the denosumab and placebo or active -comparator treatment groups and 
a low incidence of treatment -related adverse events, serious adverse events, 
withdrawals due to  adverse events, and deaths.  Most adverse events have been mild to 
moderate in severity, transient, and considered unrelated to denosumab.  Adverse 
reactions to denosumab include hypocalcemia; hypersensitivity; skin infections, 
predominantly cellulitis, l eading to hospitalization; osteonecrosis of the jaw; atypical 
femoral fracture; eczema (including dermatitis, allergic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, and 
Product:  Denosumab

CONFIDENTIAL    
contact dermatitis); cataracts in males with prostate cancer receiving androgen 
deprivation therapy; p ain in the extremities; and musculoskeletal pain.  Multiple vertebral 
fractures and hypercalcemia may occur following discontinuation of denosumab 
treatment.  
In the bone loss setting, denosumab use is contraindicated in pregnancy, in patients with 
hypocal cemia, and in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of 
the excipients.  
Volumes of blood withdrawn for analysis in association with clinical monitoring will be 
minimized as appropriate for this pediatric population based on body weight (BW) 
(European Union Ethical Considerations, 2008).  
2.3.1  Hypocalcemia  
Skeletal turnover rates vary by age and are higher in children than adults.  These higher 
bone turnover rates expected at baseline in children may increase the risk for 
hypocalcemia an d hypophosphatemia resulting from denosumab -mediated reduction of 
bone turnover.  In addition, recent clinical reports of denosumab administration in 
pediatric patients with disorders of high bone turnover (eg, fibrous dysplasia and juvenile 
Paget’s diseas e) have described disturbances in mineral metabolism, including 
hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia (Grasemann et al, 2013; Boyce et al, 2012).  
To minimize such risk, the following strategies will be employed:  
 Calcium and vitamin D supplementation will be g iven to all study subjects  
 Serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations will be monitored throughout the 
study on a regular basis  
 Subjects will not be eligible to participate if they have evidence of hypocalcemia; 
diseases that increase the risk of hypocalc emia, including, but not limited to, 
malabsorption and chronic kidney disease (as defined by an estimated glomerular 
filtration rate  60 mL/min/1.73  m2); or additional risk factors for detrimental effects of 
hypocalcemia, eg, a history of long QT syndrome  
 Occurrence of severe or symptomatic hypocalcemia will prompt discontinuation of 
study medication and institution of appropriate medical treatment  
2.3.2  Hypercalcemia  in Pediatric  Subject s Receiving Denosumab and 
After Discontinuation  of Denosumab  
In the clinica l trial and  postmarketing setting, clinically significant cases of 
hypercalcemia requiring hospitalization have been observed in patients, including those 
with developing skeletons, at the end of every 3 month s (Q3M ) dosing period or in 
those  who had previ ously received off -label denosumab.  These incidents of 
Product:  Denosumab  
Protocol Number:  20140444  
Date:  10 July 2023  Page 23 of 94 
CONFIDENTIAL    
hypercalcemia  have presented with severe vomiting with or without acute renal failure, 
and have occurred in patients who had used denosumab at higher doses and/or 
frequencies than those being used by the patient population in this study .  In pediatric 
patients with osteogenesis imperfecta , severe life -threatening adverse events of 
hypercalcemia have been reported at or near the end of the denosumab 1 mg/kg 
Q3M dosing period (>  60 days from the previous  dose)  in Study 20130173.  In 
ongoing XGEVA Study  20062004  (in subjects with giant cell tumor of bone), a 19 -year-
old subject developed clinically significant hypercalcemia approximately 8  months after 
the discontinuation of XGEVA dosing (denosumab 120  mg every 4  weeks).  Therefore, 
hypercalcemia , including  off-treatment hypercalcemia, is a potential risk in this 
pediatric population receiving Prolia.

In children, osteoclast activity is necessary to remove the cartilaginous anlagen of bone.  
Genetic deficiency in RANKL leads to osteopetrosis, a disorder of poor bone quality, 
retained cartilage, frequent fractures, and a high bone mass typified by poorly modelled 
bones with widened, club -shaped metaphyses.  Significant reduction of this 
resorpt ion-based modeling can lead to osteopetrosis -like changes with a similar 
abnormal geometry (Whyte et al, 2003).  In nonclinical studies of denosumab, the 
severity of phenotypic changes observed in the growth plate and bone was consistent 
with the rate of l ongitudinal growth in the bone, with limited and reversible effects in the 
adolescent monkey.  The most rapid increase in stature in humans occurs during the 
first 9  or 12  months of life, and head circumference continues to increase sharply over 
the first 2 years of life (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011).  Based on 
these data, the potential for significant alterations of skeletal growth and morphology is 
lower in children  5 years of age, who will be enrolled in this study.  The limited an d 
reversible bone effects of denosumab in the adolescent monkey (the second most rapid 
growth phase), lack of negative biomechanical consequences seen in the infant mice, 
and the radiographic monitorability minimize the risk of denosumab administration in 
pediatric patients whose growth rates approximate that of adolescent monkeys.  
Strategies to assess changes to the skeleton include the following:  
 Physical examination and radiographic assessments will be performed on a regular 
basis throughout the study to  monitor for possible detrimental skeletal changes; such 
assessment will also include evaluation of metaphyseal index via knee X -ray to be 
performed every 6  months throughout the study in subjects with open growth plates 
only, as only in subjects with open  growth plates does the potential risk exist of an 
abnormal rate of increase in metaphyseal width

CONFIDENTIAL    
 Changes in growth plate morphology as observed in the 6  months monitoring 
considered by the investigator to be unexpected and having an adverse clinical 
impac t for the subject during the study will prompt discontinuation of study 
medication and institution of appropriate follow -up 
2.3.4  Tooth Eruption  
RANKL plays an important role in tooth eruption.  In non -clinical studies conducted in 
neonatal rats, osteoprotegerin -immunoglobulin Fc segment complex  and alendronate 
administration impaired the eruption of second and third molars and also reduced incisor 
growth.  These findings were at least partially reversible within 10  weeks of discontinuing 
osteoprotegerin -immunogl obulin Fc segment complex .  In infant monkeys exposed in 
utero to denosumab, there was no effect on tooth eruption, although altered bone shape 
and jaw length led to tooth dysplasia and malalignment.  Such findings were not 
observed in adolescent cynomolgu s monkeys.  These data suggest that the use of 
denosumab in the rapidly growing skeleton carries potential risk for impaired tooth 
eruption.  
To minimize this risk, molar eruption and mandibular shaping will be monitored using 
visual inspection and X -ray a ssessments.  
2.3.5  Serious Infections  
RANKL is expressed on activated T and B lymphocytes and in lymph nodes.  Therefore, 
RANKL inhibition may theoretically increase the risk of infection.  In a clinical trial of over 
7800  women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, the overall incidence of infections, 
including opportunistic infections, was similar between the denosumab and placebo 
groups.  However, serious skin infections leading to hospitalization were reported more 
frequently in the denosumab group than in the pla cebo group.  Subjects on concomitant 
immunosuppressant agents, such as GCs, may be at increased risk of serious 
infections.  
While the completed clinical study of denosumab in adult GiOP 
(Study  20101217  [Saag  et al,  2018]) has not shown an excess risk for s erious infection 
associated with denosumab use, strategies have been implemented in this pediatric 
study to minimize the risk for serious infections and include the following:  
 Subjects who have initiated a biologic agent for the treatment of underlying 
inflammatory disease 4 weeks prior to screening or are on  1 biologic agent for 
the treatment of underlying inflammatory disease will not be eligible for study 
participation  
 Any subject who develops a serious opportunistic infection will permanently 
discon tinue study medication

 Any subject who develops a serious infection during the study and is receiving a 
biologic agent for the treatment of underlying inflammatory disease will permanently 
discontinue study medication  
2.3.6  Multiple Vertebral Fractures Following  Treatment Discontinuation  
Multiple vertebral fractures may occur following discontinuation of denosumab treatment, 
particularly in subjects with a history of vertebral fracture.  Among postmenopausal 
women with osteroporosis who discontinued denosumab dur ing the placebo -controlled 
FREEDOM trial and its open -label active -treatment extension, the incidence of new 
vertebral fracture was higher than in subjects who remained on treatment, but similar to 
the incidence in subjects who discontinued placebo, ie, ha d never been treated.  Among 
subjects who experienced off -treatment new vertebral fractures, a greater percentage of 
those who discontinued denosumab than placebo sustained multiple new vertebral 
fractures.  Prior vertebral fracture before or during treatm ent was the strongest predictor 
of off -treatment new vertebral fracture, including multiple vertebral fractures.  
The current study includes a 12 -month off -treatment observation period following the 
24-month treatment period.  The intent of the observationa l period was to evaluate 
clinical outcomes after investigational product discontinuation.  Discontinuation of 
osteoporosis treatment for subjects who continue to administer systemic GCs for the 
underlying non -malignant condition(s) at the end of the treatm ent period may be 
inconsistent with standard of care, particularly as subjects were required to have a 
clinically significant fracture history to participate.   
With the identified risk for multiple vertebral fractures after denosumab cessation in a 
settin g where study subjects are at high risk for fracture, the mandated observation 
period will be managed as follows:  to minimize the risk of  multiple vertebral fractures 
following treatment discontinuation, subjects who currently are administering systemic 
GC therapy for the underlying non -malignant condition(s) upon completing the 24 -month 
treatment period should transition to osteoporosis treatment per local standard of care 
for an additional 12  months or until systemic GC treatment is discontinued.  Local 
standard of care for pediatric subjects with GiOP may include BP use.  It is recognized 
that BPs are not approved for the treatment of pediatric GiOP, and BP use is considered 
off-label in this setting.  However, BP therapy is often recommended in children  with 
clinically significant fracture history and ongoing risk factors, eg, systemic GC therapy 
(Ward et al, 2016).  Therefore, the decision to use BP in these subjects will be left to the 
medical judgment of the investigator, and BP use would not be prosc ribed by the 
protocol in this situation.

2.4 Rationale  
A non -clinical study in skeletally mature (8 -month -old) human RANKL knock -in mice  
challenged with subcutaneous (SC) slow -release prednisolone pellets showed that 
denosumab treatment fully prevented the red uctions in BMD and strength of lumbar 
vertebrae observed in vehicle -treated mice and was associated with significant 
reductions in bone resorption parameters.   These findings indicate that denosumab can 
prevent loss of bone mass and strength secondary to G C therapy.  
Clinical data currently available with denosumab that are relevant to GiOP include a 
subset of adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were receiving GCs in the 
denosumab phase  2 Study  20040144, in which administration of denosumab 60  mg or  
180 mg every 6  months (Q6M) led to increased BMD at lumbar spine and total hip 
(Dore  et al, 2010).  In addition, denosumab has been investigated in a clinical trial of 
adults with GiOP (Study  20101217  [Saag et al, 2018]).  
This study is part of a Pediatric  Investigation Plan for denosumab (Prolia) that was 
agreed upon with the European Medicines Agency.  The purpose of this study is to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and PK of denosumab (1  mg/kg BW, up to a maximum of 
60 mg, administered SC Q6M) in pediatric  subjects with GiOP.   The selection of the 
1 mg/kg BW Q6M dose is based on the following considerations:  
 The pharmacodynamic effects of denosumab were similar in neonatal and 
adolescent animal models  
 The pharmacodynamic effect of denosumab on inhibition of  bone resorption in 
clinical studies in adult subjects is maintained over the 6 -month dosing interval  
 The PK profile of monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab 
(Erbitux  prescribing  information, 2012), bevacizumab (Glade Bender et al, 2008; 
Gordon et al, 2 001), and infliximab (Fasanmade et al, 2011), is similar in pediatric 
and adult populations  
 The PK of denosumab is not affected by age across all populations studied, with an 
age range of 28  to 87  years (Sutjandra et al, 2011)  
Based on these data, the PK a nd pharmacodynamics of denosumab are expected to be 
similar between the adult and pediatric populations, thus supporting selection of the 
1 mg/kg BW Q6M dose.  This dose is equivalent to the approved 60  mg adult dose for 
denosumab (assuming a 60  kg subject ), which was also the dose investigated in the 
adult GiOP trial (Study  20101217  [Saag et al, 2018]).  In addition, denosumab PK will be 
assessed throughout the study to further characterize exposure/response relationship in 
the pediatric GiOP population.

CONFIDENTIAL    
A feasibility analysis of the study sites has shown difficulties in identifying appropriate 
per protocol patients that meet the diagnostic criteria of GiOP ( International Society for 
Clinical Densitometry  [ISCD], 2019; Bishop  et al, 2014) with a specific in clusion criterion 
for evidence of at least 1 vertebral compression fracture of Genant grade  1 or higher, 
OR presence of both clinically significant fracture history and lumbar spine BMD Z -score 
 -2.0.  This inclusion criteria is the primary reason for a screen failure rate of 70 to 
75 in this study.  
In addition, trends in pediatric GiOP over time using real -world data from 3  different 
databases:  1)  United States (US) MarketScan, 2) United Kin gdom (UK) Clinical Practice 
Research Datalink  (CPRD), and 3)  Germany Electronic Medical Records (EMR) 
supported the findings in the feasibility analysis . 
Based on agreement with regulatory agencies, sample size for this study will be reduced 
to 24  subjects  including at least 16  evaluable subjects for the primary analysis.  
This study will be conducted per local regulatory and ethics committee/investigation 
review board requirements/guidelines, and data from this study may be used to seek 
modification of regi onal denosumab prescribing information.  
2.5 Clinical Hypotheses  
The hypothesis of this study is that the change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD 
Z-score following 12  months of denosumab treatment in children 5  to 17  years of age 
with GiOP will be greater than  placebo.  
3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design  
The overall study design is described by a study schema at the end of the 
protocol  synopsis section.  
This is a phase  3 multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo -controlled, parallel 
group study in pediatric sub jects, age 5  to 17  years, with GiOP.   Twenty -four subjects 
will be enrolled with at least 16 evaluable subjects for the primary analysis .  Subjects will 
be randomized in a 2:1  (active:placebo) allocation ratio to receive either denosumab 
1 mg/kg BW (up to a maximum of 60  mg) SC Q6M or matching placebo SC Q6M.   Up to 
15 subjects at selected sites will be given the opportunity to participate in a PK
substudy.  The study is comprised of 2  periods, a 24 -month treatment period (including a 
12-month placebo -controlled period and a 12 -month open -label period) and a 12 -month 
observation period.   At the end of the first 12  months of the placebo -controlled treatment 

Product:  Denosumab  
Protocol Number:  20140444  
Date:  10 July 2023  Page 28 of 94 
CONFIDENTIAL    
period, all subjects will receive open -label denosumab Q6M for 12  months.  Upon 
completion of the 2 4-month treatment period, the 12 -month observation period will 
begin.  Daily supplements of calcium and vitamin D will be given to all subjects during 
the 24 -month treatment period.  Daily supplements of calcium and vitamin D may also 
be given to subjects during the 12 -month observation period, if deemed medically 
warranted by the investigator.   The planned length of participation in the study for an 
individual subject is approximately 3  years, which includes screening (up to 35  days), 
treatment phase (24  months), and off -treatment observation period (12  months).   The 
anticipated dropout rate is approximately 10 in the first year.  
Treatment Period   
The treatment period will last for 24  months , including 12 -month double -blind and 
12-month open -label treatment .  During the first 12  months of the placebo -controlled 
treatment period,  subjects will receive either denosumab 1  mg/kg BW (up to a maximum 
of 60  mg) SC Q6M or matching placebo SC Q6M.  At the end of the first 12  months of 
the treatment period, a ll subjects will receive open -label denosumab Q6M for 12  months .  
The last dose of study medication will be administered at month 18.  
Observation Period  
The observation period will start immediately after the 24 -month treatment period and 
last 12  months, d uring which study subjects will receive no investigational product.  
Study subjects are to be followed up during the 12 -month observation period according 
to the following guidelines:  
 Subjects who are currently on systemic GC for the treatment of the under lying 
non-malignant condition(s) at the month 24  visit should discontinue investigational 
product and transition to another osteoporosis treatment per local standard of care, 
according to the medical judgment of the investigator, for an additional 12  month s or 
until systemic GC treatment is discontinued (see Section 2.3.6 ) 
 Subjects who are no longer on systemic GC for the treatment of the underlying 
non-malignant condition(s) at the month 24  visit should discontinue investigational 
product and be followed up for an additional 12  months off treatment; however, 
subjects who, during the 12 -month observation period, resume systemic GC therapy, 
experience a worsening of their osteoporosis, or require osteoporosis therapy based 
on the medical judgment of the investigator may resume osteoporosis treatment per 
local standard of care at the discretion of the investigator

sample size.  
3.4 Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who are withdrawn or removed from treatment or the study will not be replaced.  
3.5 Estimated Study Duration  
3.5.1  Study Duration for Subjects  
The planned length of participation in the study for an individual subject is approximately 
3 years, which includes s creening (up to 42  days), treatment phase (24  months), and 
off-treatment observation period (12  months).   The anticipated dropout rate is 
approximately 10 in the first year.  After signing the informed consent form (ICF), 
subjects should be randomized wit hin 35  days.  
3.5.2  End of Study  
Primary Completion :  The primary completion date is defined as the date when the last 
subject is assessed or receives an intervention for the final collection of data for the 
primary endpoint(s), whether the study concluded as planned in the protocol or was 
terminated early.  
The primary completion date is the date when the last subject has completed the 
assessments for month 12.    
If the study concludes prior to the primary completion date originally planned in the 
protocol (ie, early termination of the study), then the prima ry completion will be the date 
when the last subject is assessed or receives an intervention for evaluation in the study 
(ie, last subject last visit).

4. SUBJECT ELIGIBILITY  
Investigators will be expected to maintain a screening log of all potential study 
candidates that includes limited information about the potential candidate (eg, date of 
screening).  This log may be completed and updated via an Interactive Voice Response 
(IVR)/Interactive Web Response (IWR) system.  
Before any study -speci fic activities/procedure, the appropriate written informed consent 
must be obtained (see Section 11.1).  In addition to written informed consent fr om a 
legally acceptable representative, the assent of the child also must be obtained, as 
appropriate if requested by the institutional review board/independent ethics committee 
(IRB/IEC).  
If the subject reaches the age of consent during the duration of th e study, once the 
subject reaches the age of maturation (usually 18 years), the previously acquired 
parental consent is no longer applicable and the participant’s consent must be obtained.  
Per International Conference for Harmonisation (ICH) E11 (R1), dur ing clinical studies 
there is a requirement for obtaining adequate informed consent for continued 
participation from pediatric participants once a child reaches the age of legal consent.  
Local regulations related to confidentiality and privacy of pediatri c participants must be 
followed.

Before subjects begin participation in any study -specific activities/procedures, Amgen 
requires a copy of the  site’s written IRB/IEC approval of the protocol, ICF, and all other 
subject information and/or recruitment material, if applicable  (see Section  11.2).  All 
legally acceptable representatives must personally sign and date the ICF, and subjects 
should sign the subject assent form as applicable by local law before commencement of 
study specific activities/procedures.  
A subject is considered enrolled wh en the investigator confirms that the subject has met 
all eligibility criteria.  The investigator is to document this decision and date in the 
subject’s medical record and in/on the enrollment case report form (CRF).  
Each subject who enters into the screen ing period for the study (defined as when the 
informed consent and subject assent forms are duly signed) receives a unique subject 
identification number before any study -related activities/procedures are performed.  The 
subject identification number will b e assigned by an IVRS/IWRS.  This number will be 
used to identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study 
documentation related to that subject.   
The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical 
study; it must not be changed after initial assignment, including if a subject is 
rescreened.  This number will not necessarily be the same as the randomization number 
assigned for the study.

5.1 Screening  
After signing the informed consent, and assen t if applicable, subjects will be screened in 
order to assess their eligibility for study participation.  The screening window is up to 
35 days.  If a subject has not met all eligibility criteria during or by the end of the 
screening window, the subject wi ll be registered as a screen failure.  Subjects who 
screen fail may be eligible to rescreen per Section 7.2.2 . 
5.2 Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1  allocation ratio to receive either denosumab or 
placebo  respectively, in a double -blind manner.  The randomization will be performed by 
IVR/IWR system .  The randomization date is to be documented in the subject’s medical 
record and on the enrollment CRF.  
5.3 Site Personnel Access to Individual Treatment Assignment s 
A subject’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the 
treatment is essential for the further management of the subject on this study.  
Unblinding at the study site for any other reason will be considered a protocol deviation.  
The investigator is strongly encouraged to contact the Amgen Clinical Manager before 
unblinding any subject’s treatment assignment, but must do so within 1  working day after 
the event.  
6. TREATMENT PROCEDURES  
Subjects will be randomized to receive denosumab or  placebo every 6  months in a 
2:1 allocation ratio for the first 12  months.  At the end of the initial 12 -month period, all 
subjects will receive open -label denosumab Q6M for 12  months .  Denosumab 
administered at a dose of 1  mg/kg BW (up to a maximum of 60  mg) and matching 
placebo are considered to be IPs in this study.  A manual containing detailed information 
regarding the storage, preparation, and administration of investigational product are 
provided separately in the Investigational Product Instruction Manual (IPIM).  
All subjects will receive a SC injection of investigational product Q6M for the first 
12 months.  At the end of the initial 12 -month placebo -controlled period, all subjects will 
receive open -label denosumab Q6M for 12  months  (last injection to be administered at 
month 18).  All SC injections must be administered by authorized site personnel.  The 
injection should not be administered in the same arm from which blood is drawn.  
Investigational product should be administered only after all other  study visit procedures 
have been completed.  If a subject misses a scheduled dose of investigational product 
during a study visit, then he/she should return to the clinic to receive the missed dose

within the visit window allowed for that particular visit  (see Section 7).  The clinical 
monitor should be contacted for specific instructions if a subject cannot receive his/her 
dose within the allowed v isit window.  
The total volume of investigational product, start date/time, and box number of 
investigational product are to be recorded on each subject's CRF.  
Overdose with this product has not been reported.  The highest dose tested in clinical 
trials is 210 mg SC Q6M.  It is possible that an overdose may result in hypocalcemia.  
Hypocalcemia, if severe, should be managed by oral or parenteral calcium replacement, 
as clinically indicated.

treatment of underlying inflammatory disease  
 Serious infection is defined as a s erious adverse event of infection 
that is complicated by multiple organ involvement or sepsis  
 Sepsis is defined by the presence of infection and a severe 
systemic inflammatory response  
If a subject discontinues Amgen investigational product, the investigat or is to discuss 
with the subject the appropriate processes for discontinuation and the options for 
continuation of the Schedule of Assessments and collection of data, including endpoints 
and adverse events, as applicable.  The investigator must document t he change to the 
Schedule of Assessments and the level of follow up that is agreed to by the subject 
(eg, in person, by telephone/mail, through family/friends, in 
correspondence/communication with other physicians, from review of the medical 
records).  
6.3 Non-Amgen Non -investigational Product(s)  
Non-Amgen non -investigational product(s) including calcium and vitamin D supplements 
will also be used in this study.  These therapies are commercially available and are not 
provided by Amgen (except if required by  local regulation) .  The investigator will be 
responsible for obtaining supplies of these protocol -required therapies and will be 
reimbursed.  
The dose, start date, stop date, and frequency for calcium and vitamin D are to be 
recorded on each subject’s CRF.   At screening, the investigator or designee will instruct 
subjects on daily calcium and vitamin D supplementation.

Additional details regarding the product(s) are provided in the IPIM.  
The below clarifies use of the activated form of 1 -25 OH vitamin D (Ca lcitriol):  
Calcitriol is allowed for use when in cases where medically indicated and no other 
exclusionary medical history is present.  Recommended doses in the pediatric 
population are:  
 Children under 1  year:  0.04 -0.08 mcg/kg orally once/day.  
 Children 1 -5 years:  0.25 -0.75 mcg orally once/day.  
 Children over 6  years:  0.5 -2 mcg orally once/day.  
Calcitriol may not be used as an adjuvant treatment for osteoporosis and rationale for 
use must be documented in the CRF.  
6.3.1  Non-Amgen Non -investigational Product:  Ca lcium  
All subjects are required to take daily supplements of 30 to 50  mg/kg BW and not to 
exceed 1000  mg elemental calcium during the 24 -month treatment phase of the study.  
6.3.2  Non-Amgen Non -investigational Product:  Vitamin D  
All subjects are required to t ake daily supplements of at least 800  IU vitamin D during 
the 24 -month treatment phase of the study.  
6.3.3  Dosage Adjustments, Delays, Rules for Withholding or Restarting, 
Permanent Discontinuation  
If a subject becomes hypercalcemic over the course of the stud y, the calcium and/or 
vitamin D supplementation may be discontinued until the serum calcium concentration 
has returned to the normal range.  If a subject becomes hypocalcemic over the course of 
the study, the calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation may be  increased, per medical 
judgment of the investigator.  
In instances where a subject is experiencing tolerability issues with daily elemental 
calcium, the subject should be instructed to try different calcium salt formulations.  If this 
strategy fails, the i nvestigator may document that only a lower calcium supplementation 
dose is tolerated by the subject or that dietary supplementation is required and this will 
be allowed.  Tolerability issues for vitamin D should be managed using the same 
approach as outlin ed for calcium above.  
The reason for dose change of calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation is to be 
recorded on each subject’s CRF.

6.4 Hepatotoxicity Stopping and Rechallenge Rules  
Subjects with abnormal hepatic laboratory values (ie, ALP, AST, ALT, TBL) an d/or INR 
and/or signs/symptoms of hepatitis (as described below) may meet the criteria for 
withholding or permanent discontinuation of Amgen investigational product or other 
protocol -required therapies  as specified in the Guidance for Industry Drug -Induced  Liver 
Injury:   Premarketing Clinical Evaluation, July  2009.  
6.4.1  Criteria for Withholding and/or Permanent Discontinuation of Amgen 
Investigational Product and Other Protocol -required Therapies Due 
to Potential Hepatotoxicity  
The following stopping and/or with holding rules apply to subjects for whom another 
cause of their changes in liver biomarkers (TBL, INR, and transaminases) has not been 
identified.  
Important alternative causes for elevated AST/ALT and/or TBL values include, but are 
not limited to:  
 Hepatobi liary tract disease  
 Viral hepatitis (eg, Hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, Epstein -Barr Virus, cytomegalovirus, Herpes 
Simplex Virus, Varicella, toxoplasmosis, and Parvovirus)  
 Right -sided heart failure, hypotension or any cause of hypoxia to the liver causing 
ischemia.  
 Exposure to hepatotoxic agents/drugs or hepatotoxins, including herbal and dietary 
supplements, plants and mushrooms  
 Heritable disorders causing impaired glucuronidation (eg, Gilbert’s Syndrome, 
Crigler -Najjar syndrome) and drugs that inhibit bilirubin glucuronidation (eg, indinavir, 
atazanavir)  
 Alpha -one antitrypsin deficiency  
 Alcoholic hepatitis  
 Autoimmune hepatitis  
 Wilson’s disease and hemochromatosis  
 Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease including Steatohepatitis  
 Non-hepatic causes (eg, rhabdomylosis, hem olysis)  
Amgen investigational product and other protocol -required therapies, as appropriate, 
should be withheld pending investigation into alternative causes of Drug Induced Liver 
Injury (DILI).  If investigational product(s) is/are withheld, the subject i s to be followed for 
possible DILI.  Rechallenge may be considered if an alternative cause for impaired liver 
tests (ALT, AST, ALP) and/or elevated TBL, is discovered and the laboratory 
abnormalities resolve to normal or baseline.

 AND increased AST or ALT from the relevant baseline value as specified below:   
Baseline AST or ALT value  AST or ALT elevation  
 ULN  3 x ULN  
 AND no other cause for the combination of the above laboratory abnormalities is 
immediately apparent (eg, hepatobiliary tract disease, viral hepatitis, right -sided heart 
failure, hypotension or any cause of hypoxia to the liver causing ischemia, etc)  
Conditional withholding of investigational medicinal product or other protocol -required 
therapies is recommended if all of the following apply:  
 Elevation of either AST or ALT according to the following schedule:

Any  8 x ULN at any time  
Any  5 x ULN but  8 x ULN for  2 weeks  
Any  5 x ULN but  8 x ULN and unable to adhere to 
enhanced monitoring schedule  
Any  3 x ULN with clinical signs or symptoms that are 
consistent with hepatitis (such as right upper quadran t 
pain/tenderness, fever, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice).  
 OR:  TBL  3 x ULN at any time  
 OR:  ALP  8 x ULN at any time  
In subjects with dystrophinopathies, given the well -known occurrence of serum 
transaminase elevation of muscular origin (McMillan et al, 2011), conditional withholding 
of investigational medicinal product or other protocol -required therapies is recommended 
if the above elevations in AST or ALT are:  
 Not accompanied by corresponding CPK elevations  
OR 
 Accompanied by concomitant TBL, ALP, G GT, or PT/INR elevation and/or symptoms 
or signs of hepatic inflammation, such as nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain 
or tenderness, jaundice, or fever, with no other immediately apparent possible cause

6.8 Contraceptive Requirements  
Female of Childbearing Potential  
A female is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal 
unless permanently sterile.  Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, 
bilateral salpingecto my, and bilateral oophorectomy.  
Females are considered of childbearing potential if they have had menarche or are 
Tanner stage  2 or higher.  Female subjects who have had menarche or are Tanner 
stage  2 or higher will need to have pregnancy testing.  
Females in the following categories are not considered of child bearing potential:  
1. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
a. Documented hysterectomy  
b. Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
c. Documented bilateral oophorectomy

Note:  Site personnel documentation from the following sources is 
acceptable:  1) review of subject medical records, 2) subject medical 
examination, or 3) subject medical history interview.  
2. Premenarchal female (unless of Tanner Stage  2 or higher)  
3. Postmenop ausal female  
a. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12  months without an 
alternative medical cause.  A high follicle -stimulating hormone level in the 
postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in 
women not using hormo nal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy 
(HRT).  However, in the absence of 12  months of amenorrhea, a single 
follicle -stimulating hormone measurement is insufficient.  
b. Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to 
use 1 of the non -hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish 
to continue their HRT during the study.  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT 
to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.  
6.8.1  Female Subjects  
Female subje cts of childbearing potential must agree to use 1  highly effective  method of 
contraception  (as described in the table below) during treatment and for an additional 
5 months  after the last dose of protocol -required therapies.   
Highly Effective Contraceptiv e Methods for Female Subjects  
Failure rate of  1 per year when used consistently and correctly.  
 Combined (estrogen and progestogen) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation (oral, intravaginal, or transdermal)  
 Intrauterine device  
 Intrauterine hormonal -releasing system  
 Bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion  
 Vasectomized partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the female subject 
of childbearing potential and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessme nt 
of the surgical success)  
 Sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire 
period of risk associated with the study treatments.  The reliability of sexual abstinence must 
be evaluated in relation to the duration of  the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the subject.)  
If a female subject is suspected of being pregnant, the protocol -required therapies must 
be stopped immediately and may not be resumed until absence of pregnancy has been 
medically confirme d.   
6.8.2  Male Subjects  
Male subjects are not required to use birth control during exposure to denosumab.

Birth control methods that are considered unacceptable  in clinical trials include:   periodic 
abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, postovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus 
interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method.  
Female subjects of childbearing potential must receive pregnancy prevention counseling 
and be advis ed of the risk to fetus if they become pregnant during treatment and for 
5 months  after the last dose of investigational product.

7.2 General Study Procedures  
All on -study visits and dosing should be scheduled from day  1.  It is important to perform 
study assessments and obtain samples at the time points outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table  2). 
When it is not possible to perform the study visit at the specified time point, the visit may 
be performed within the visit window noted in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2).  If 
a study visit is missed, subsequent visits should resume on the original visit schedule.  
Missed assessments at prior visits should not be duplicated at subs equent visits.  
With the exception of screening or rescreening visits, all study procedures for a visit 
must be completed on the same day.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that all procedures are performed 
according to the protocol.  
Details regarding each type of procedure are provided in Section 7.3. 
7.2.1  Screening  
Screening and day  1 visit cannot occur on the same day.  The day  1 visit needs to occur 
within 35  days of the screening date (unless the subject is rescreened).   
The following procedures are to be completed during the screening period at time points 
designated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2): 
 Confirmation that the ICF and Assent form (if applicable) have been signed  
 Demographic data including sex, date of birth, age, race, and ethnicity will be 
collected in order  to study their possible association with subject safety and 
treatment effectiveness.  Additionally demographic data will be used to study the 
impact biomarker variability and PK of the protocol -required therapies.  
 Registration in IVR/IWR system

7.2.2  Rescreening  
Rescreening will be allowed as follows.  A new ICF must be signed unless it has been 
 30 days since the previous ICF signature was obtained.  Subjects may be rescreened 
only once for each of the 2  conditions below (rescreening for serum 25  [OH] vitamin D 
and/or full rescreening for other reasons of screen failure).  Sites will be notified, near 
the end of enrollment for the study, when subjects can no longer be rescreened.  After 
this notification, subjects who do not qualify based on their ini tial tests will be screen 
failed.  
Rescreening for Serum 25(OH) Vitamin D  
For subjects with an initial screening serum 25(OH) vitamin D level  20 ng/mL, 
rescreening will be performed as follows:  
 Enter the subject as a screen failure into the IVRS/IWRS and  enter him/her as a 
rescreen.  Subjects not entered into IVRS/IWRS as a rescreen will not be eligible to 
participate in the study.  
 A new 42 -day screening window will commence at this time.  
 The subject must be repleted for vitamin D, as confirmed by a seru m vitamin D level 
 20 ng/mL obtained by the central laboratory prior to the day  1 visit, to meet subject 
eligibility requirements.  
Full Rescreening  
Full rescreening will be allowed for any subject who has previously failed screening if, in 
the opinion of the investigator, the reason for the initial screen failure has been resolved 
or is no longer applicable.

Physical examination will also include assessment of Tanner stage.  A pelvic, breast, or 
rectal examination is not required unless a specific evaluation is warranted.   
7.3.7  Physical Measurements  
Physical measurements include height and weight.  Height (in centimeters) and weight 
(in kilograms) should be measured without shoes.  Height measurements will be 
performed in the standing position unless it is not possible to do so.  Measurement of

CONFIDENTIAL    
standing height should be made using a wall -mounted stadiometer (calibrated within the 
previous 4  hours), and recorded to the nearest 10th of a centimeter (Food and Drug 
Administration Guidance for Industry, 2007).  In instances where stand ing height cannot 
be measured, measurement of recumbent height will be allowed.  
Body Mass Index should be calculated using the following formula:  
BMI (kg/m2)  weight  (kg)/[height (cm)/100]2. 
7.3.8  Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include temperature, respiration rate, blood pressure, and heart rate 
obtained in the sitting position after the subject has been sitting quietly for at least 
5 minutes.  The temperature location selected for a subject should be the same that is 
used throughout the study and documented on  the vital signs CRF.  
7.3.9  Pregnancy Testing  
Pregnancy tests will be performed from urine samples to be collected at screening, on 
day 1, and at months 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 in all female subjects who are at Tanner 
stage 2 (or higher) or have had menarche.  A negative pregnancy test must be 
confirmed prior to administration of study medication at all scheduled visits 
(as applicable).  
7.3.10  Dual -energy X -Ray Absorptiometry (DXA)  
All subjects will undergo bone densitometry assessments of the lumbar spine and 
proxima l femur performed by DXA at all applicable visits.  DXA assessments of the 
lumbar spine and proximal femur are to be performed in duplicate only at screening and 
day 1, respectively.  All DXA scans will be submitted to a central imaging vendor for 
analysis . 
Only General Electric Lunar or Hologic bone densitometers will be allowed for this study.  
The same DXA machine must be used for all study procedures for a particular subject.  
The left side should be used for proximal femur, unless prohibited (eg, hip i mplant).  If 
the right side must be used or is inadvertently used at screening, then it must be used 
consistently throughout the study.  Lumbar spine scans should include L1 through L4.  
At least 2  lumbar vertebrae from L1 -L4 must be evaluable by DXA.  
After analysis of the scans by the central imaging vendor, the study site may be asked to 
re-acquire a scan, because of poor positioning or other technical reasons.  The 
investigator sites must comply with the requests from the central imaging vendor.

CONFIDENTIAL    
Detail ed instructions for scan acquisition will be in a separate manual provided by the 
central imaging vendor.  
7.3.11  Spine Radiographs  
Lateral radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar spine will be obtained at scheduled 
time-points to determine morphometric fractures.  Baseline lateral spine radiographs will 
be obtained at screening for all subjects, unless an adequate lateral spine radiograph 
has been obtained within the 2  months prior to screening day; in this case the 
radiograph must still be sent to the central imag ing vendor.  All available radiographic 
assessments for evaluation of potential fracture from screening until end of study will be 
submitted to the central imaging vendor for final analysis.  The results from the central 
imaging vendor analysis of the scan  data will be used for determination of eligibility and 
analysis of the final dataset.   
7.3.12  Radiographs for Assessment of Long -bone Fractures  
Long -bone fractures which occurred within 2  years prior to screening should be 
substantiated by radiographs, where av ailable, or with a medical report, in the event of 
unavailable radiographs.  Images and/or radiologic/medical reports for potential 
long-bone fractures will be submitted to the central imaging vendor for reading and 
evaluation.   
7.3.13  Knee Radiograph  
Anteropost erior (AP) radiographs of both knees (unless prohibited by the presence of 
hardware such as implants) will be used to calculate the metaphyseal index Z -score of 
each knee; the score will then be based on the knee with the higher Z -score.  The knee 
for asse ssment of metaphyseal index during the study should be the 1  with the higher 
Z-score at day  1, unless prohibited by presence of hardware, in which case an 
AP radiograph of the contralateral knee may be obtained.  Knee radiographs will be 
submitted to the c entral imaging vendor for reading and evaluation.   
7.3.14  Dental Radiograms  
Lateral Cephalogram  
The lateral cephalogram is a profile X -ray of the skull and soft tissues and is used to 
assess the relation of the teeth in the jaws, the relation of the jaws to the skull, and the 
relation of the soft tissues to the teeth and jaws.  Lateral cephalogram will be performed 
to enable assessment of mandibular shaping.

CONFIDENTIAL    
Panoramic Radiogram  
The panoramic radiogram is a panoramic scanning dental X -ray of the upper and lower 
jaw, which shows a 2 -dimensional view of a half -circle from ear to ear.  Panoramic 
radiogram will be performed to monitor molar eruption at day  1 and end of the study.  
Other Dental Radiograms  
Reflex radiographic assessment (eg, panoramic, bitewing, or periap ical view) may be 
performed in the event a subject is referred to a dentist due to suspicion of unerupted 
molar(s), based on visual inspection.  The choice of technique/view for this reflex 
radiographic assessment (eg, panoramic, bitewing, or periapical vi ew) will be determined 
by the dentist based on his/her professional judgment.  All films resulting from these 
assessments should be submitted to the central reader.  
7.3.15  Oral Visual Inspection  
Each subject will undergo a visual inspection under natural light for the presence of 
molars.  Since third molar eruption normally occurs after age 21, evaluation of third 
molar eruption will not be carried out.  
Oral visual inspection should be performed at the month 12 and 24 visits to assess the 
risk for unerupted mola rs.  The subject should be referred to a dentist to perform 
radiographic assessment of the unerupted molar(s) if:  
 A subject is 7  years of age or older and less than 13  years of age and appears to 
have an unerupted upper or lower first molar (ie, all 4  first molars should be 
visible/detectable)  
 A subject is 13  years of age or older and appears to have an unerupted upper or 
lower (first or) second molar (ie, all 4  first molars and all 4  second molars should be 
visible/detectable)  
7.3.16  Patient -reported Outcomes (P ROs)  
The subject’s health -related quality of life, physical functioning, and pain intensity will be 
assessed using the CHQ -PF-50, CHAQ, and the WBFPRS.  
The CHQ -PF-50 is a generic health -related quality -of-life instrument that is used to 
measure 14  unique physical and psychosocial domains for children from 5  to 18  years of

which consists of 6  hand -drawn faces that range from a smiling “no hurt” face with a 
score of 0  to a cr ying “hurts most” face with a score of 10.   
7.3.17  Pharmacokinetic (PK) Samples  
All subjects receiving denosumab will have PK samples assessed.  Blood sample(s) for 
PK testing are to be collected for the measurement of pharmacokinetic concentrations.   
7.4 Antibody Testing Procedures  
Blood sample(s) for antibody testing are to be collected for the measurement of 
antidenosumab binding antibodies.  Samples testing positive for binding antibodies will 
also be tested for neutralizing antibodies and may be further charact erized for 
quantity/titer, isotype, affinity, and presence of immune complexes.  Additional blood 
samples may be obtained to rule out antidenosumab antibodies during the study.   
Sites will be notified of any positive neutralizing antibody results to denos umab or 
protocol -required therapies.  If results are not provided, no neutralizing antibodies to 
denosumab or protocol -required therapies have been detected.  
Subjects who test positive for neutralizing antibodies to denosumab (eg, Amgen or 
non-Amgen IPs) o r protocol -required therapies at the final scheduled study visit will be 
asked to return for additional follow -up testing.  This testing is to occur approximately 
every 3  months starting from when the site has been notified of the positive result, until:  
(1) neutralizing antibodies are no longer detectable or (2) the subject has been followed 
for a period of at least 1  year ( 4 weeks) postadministration of denosumab (eg, Amgen 
or non -Amgen IPs) or protocol -required therapies.  All follow -up results, both positive 
and negative will be communicated to the sites.  More frequent testing (eg, every month) 
or testing for a longer period of time may be requested in the event of safety -related 
concerns.  Follow -up testing is not required where it is established th at the subject did 
not receive denosumab or protocol -required therapies.  
Subjects who test positive for binding, non -neutralizing antibodies and have clinical 
sequelae that are considered potentially related to an anti -denosumab (eg, Amgen or 
non-Amgen IPs ) or protocol -required therapies antibody response may also be asked to 
return for additional follow -up testing.  Refer to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2), 
as applicable, for specific time points and the laboratory manual for detailed collection 
and handling instructions.

7.5 Optional Substudies  
7.6 Early Termination  
If the subject discontinues the study prior to the month 36  visit, a safety follow -up visit 
will occur within 30  days following the last protocol -required therapy.  
All procedures outlined for the month 36  visit will be performed duri ng this visit with the 
following exception:  
 Procedures involving radiation exposure other than DXA assessment may not be 
performed if  3 months have elapsed since the previous radiographic assessment  
 DXA scans will only be performed if  30 days have elap sed since the previous 
assessment  
 Administration of PROs may not be performed if  1 month has elapsed since the 
previous assessment  
7.7 Sample Storage and Destruction  
Any blood PK sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2) can 
be analyzed for any of th e tests out lined in the protocol and for any tests necessary to 
minimize risks to study subjects.  This includes testing to ensure  analytical methods 
produce  reliable and valid data  throughout the course of the study .  This can also  
include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample 
reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and comparability.  
All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for 
analysis or storage.  Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is assigned to 
the samples for the study.  Results are stored in a secure database to ensure  
confidentiality.    
If permitted by local law and informed consent is provided by the subject’s legally 
acceptable representative(s),  Amgen can do additional testing on remaining samples 
(ie, residual and back -up) to investigate and better understand GiOP , the dose response 
and/or prediction of response to denosumab, and characterize aspects of the molecule 
(eg, mechanism of action/target, metabolites).  Results from this analysis are to be 
documented and maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part  of this study.  
Samples can be retained for up to 20  years.   
Since the evaluations are not expected to benefit the subject directly or to alter the 
treatment course, the results of other exploratory studies are not placed in the subject’s

CONFIDENTIAL    
medical record and are not to be made available to the subject, members of the family, 
the personal physician, or other third parties, except as specified in the informed 
consent.  
The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by 
contactin g the investigator.  Following the request from the subject, the investigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining 
blood samples and any other components from the cells can be located and destroyed.  
Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are completed.  
However, information collected from samples prior to the request for destruction, will be 
retained by Amgen.  
The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or deriva tive materials from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the 
request of the subject through the investigator, at the end of the storage period, or as 
appropriate (eg, the scientific rationale for experimentation w ith a certain sample type no 
longer justifies keeping the sample).  If a commercial product is developed from this 
research project, the sponsor owns the commercial product.  The subject has no 
commercial rights to such product and has no commercial rights  to the data, information, 
discoveries, or derivative materials gained or produced from the sample.  See 
Section  11.3 for subject confidentiality.  
8. WITHDRAWAL FROM TREATMENT, PROCEDURES, AND STUDY  
8.1 Subjects’ Decision to Withdraw  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason 
without prejudice to their future medical care by the physician or at the institution.  
Subject s (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving 
investigational product and/or other protocol -required therapies or procedures at any 
time during the study but continue participation in the study.  If this occurs, the 
investiga tor is to discuss with the subject the appropriate processes for discontinuation  
from investigational product, device or other protocol -required therapies and must 
discuss with the subject the options for continuation of the Schedule of Assessments  
(Table  2) including different options of follow -up (eg, in person, by phone/mail, through 
family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other treating physicians, from the 
review of medical records) and collection of data, including endpoints and adverse 
events .  Subjects who have discontinued investigational product and/or protocol -required 
therapies or procedures should not be automatically removed from the study.  Whenever

CONFIDENTIAL    
safe and feasible it is imperative that subjects remain on -study to ensure safety 
survei llance and/or collection of outcome data.  The investigator must document the 
level of follow -up that is agreed to by the subject.   
Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive 
further protocol -required therapies or pr ocedures, and the subject does not wish to or is 
unable to continue further study participation.  Subject data up to withdrawal of consent 
will be included in the analysis of the study, and where permitted, publically available 
data can be included after w ithdrawal of consent.  The investigator is to discuss with the 
subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study.  
8.2 Investigator or Sponsor Decision to Withdraw or Terminate 
Subjects’ Participation Prior to Study Completion  
The investigator and/or  sponsor can decide to withdraw a subject(s) from investigational 
product, device, and/or other protocol -required therapies, protocol procedures, or the 
study as a whole at any time prior to study completion for the reasons listed in 
Section  8.3.1  and Section 8.3.2 . 
Subjects may be eligible for  continued treatment with Amgen investigational product(s) 
and/or other protocol -required therapies by a separate protocol or as provided for by the 
local country’s regulatory mechanism, based on parameters consistent with 
Section  12.1.

9. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING  
9.1 Definition of Safety Events  
9.1.1  Adverse Events  
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial 
subject.  The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment.  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any adverse events observed by t he 
investigator or reported by the subject are recorded in the subject’s medical record.   
The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre -existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition or underlying d isease 
(eg, diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or 
duration more than would be expected, and/or has an association with a significantly 
worse outcome than expected.  A pre -existing condition that has not worsened m ore 
than anticipated (ie, more than usual fluctuation of disease) during the study or involves 
an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study, 
is not considered an adverse event.   
If the severity of an adverse even t worsens from onset to resolution, a single event for 
each increased level of severity should be recorded on the Events eCRF .  
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject, or subject’s 
legally acceptable representative requests to withdraw from protocol -required therapies 
or the study due to an adverse event, refer to Section  8.1 for additional instructions on 
the procedures recommended for safe withdrawal from protocol -required therapies or 
the study.   
9.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event that m eets at least 1  of the 
following serious criteria:  
 Fatal  
 Life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)  
 Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapa city 
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Other medically important serious event  
Product:  Denosumab  
Protocol Number:  20140444  
Date:  10 July 2023  Page 66 of 94 
CONFIDENTIAL    
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization,” if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).   
If an investigato r considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the 
criterion of “other medically important serious event.”  Examples of such events could 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, DILI (see Appendix  A for 
drug-induced liver injury reporting criteria), or events that neces sitate an emergency 
room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.  
9.2 Safety Event Reporting Procedures  
9.2.1  Adverse Events  
9.2.1.1  Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events That do not Meet Serious 
Criteria  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all ad verse events observed by the 
investigator or reported by the subject that occur after the first dose of investigational 
product through the end of study are reported using the Event s CRF.  
The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  
 Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms) ; 
 Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved) ; 
 Did the event start prior to first dose of investigational product, other 
protocol -required therapies;  
 Assessment of seriousness;  
 Severity (or toxicity defined below);  
 Assessment of relatedness to investigational product or other protocol -required 
therapies ;  
 Action taken; and  
 Outcome of event  
The adverse event grading scale used will be the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events.  The grading scale used in this study is described in Appendix  A.  If the 
severity of an adverse event worsens from onset to resolution, record a single event for 
each increased level of severity.  
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to the  
investigational product(s) and/ or other protocol -required therapies.  This relationship is 
indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  Is there a reasonable possibility 
Product:  Denosumab  
Protocol Number:  20140444  
Date:  10 July 2023  Page 67 of 94 
CONFIDENTIAL    
that the event may have been caused by the investigational product(s) and/or other 
protocol -required thera pies?   
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to any 
study -mandated activity (eg, administration of investigational product, protocol -required 
therapies, and/or procedure (including any screening procedures).  This rela tionship is 
indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility 
that the event may have been caused by a study activity (eg, administration of 
investigational product, protocol -required therapies, and/or procedure)”?  
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory 
findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be 
recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment 
or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applica ble, 
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse 
event.  
The investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or 
reversibility.  
9.2.1.2  Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
The inves tigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by 
the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after signing of the informed 
consent through 30  days after the last day of the dosing interval or end of study, 
whicheve r is a longer period, are recorded in the subject’s medical record and are 
submitted to Amgen .  All serious adverse events must be submitted to Amgen within 
24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event via the Events CRF.    
If the electroni c data capture (EDC) system is unavailable for more than 24 hours to the 
site staff to report the serious adverse event, the information is to be reported to Amgen 
via a paper -based Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form (also referred to as 
the ele ctronic Serious Adverse Event [eSAE] Contingency Report Form) within 24  hours 
of the investigator’s awareness of the event.  See Appendix  B for a sampl e of the 
electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form.  For EDC studies where 
the first notification of a serious adverse event is reported to Amgen via the eSerious 
Product:  Denosumab  
Protocol Number:  20140444  
Date:  10 July 2023  Page 68 of 94 
CONFIDENTIAL    
Adverse Event Contingency Report Form, the data must be entered into the EDC 
system when the system is again available.  
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to 
the investigational product and/or other protocol -required therapies.   This relationship is 
indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  Is there a reasonable possibility 
that the event may have been caused by the investigational product and/or other 
protocol -required therapies ?  Relatedness means that there are facts or reasons to 
support a relationship between investigational product and the event.  
The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events until stabilization 
or reversibility.  
New information relating to a previously reported seriou s adverse event must be 
submitted to Amgen .  All new information for serious adverse events must be sent to 
Amgen within 24  hours following knowledge of the new information.  If specifically 
requested, the investigator may need to provide additional follow -up information, such as 
discharge summaries, medical records, or extracts from the medical records.  
Information provided about the serious adverse event must be consistent with that 
recorded on the Events CRF.  
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from p rotocol -required therapies because of a 
serious adverse event, this information must be submitted to Amgen.  
Serious adverse event(s) should be reported to Amgen (regardless of causality) if the 
investigator becomes aware of a serious adverse event.   
To co mply with worldwide reporting regulations for serious adverse events, the treatment 
assignment of subjects who develop serious, unexpected, and related adverse events 
may be unblinded by Amgen before submission to regulatory authorities.  
Amgen will report serious adverse events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions as required to regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and IRBs/IECs 
in compliance with all reporting requirements according to local regulations and good 
clinical pra ctice (GCP) .  
The investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB/IEC of serious adverse events occurring 
at the site and other adverse event reports received from Amgen, in accordance with 
local regulatory requirements and procedures.

CONFIDENTIAL    
9.2.1.3  Method of Detecting Ad verse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse events and/or serious 
adverse events.  Open -ended and non -leading verbal questioning of the subject is the 
preferred method to inquire about adverse eve nt occurrence.  
9.2.1.4  Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
After the initial adverse event/serious adverse event report, the investigator is required to 
proactively follow each subject at subsequent visits/contacts.  All adverse events and 
serio us adverse events will be followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is 
otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. 
All new information for previously reported serious adverse events must be sent to 
Amgen within 24 hours following awareness of the new information.  If specifically 
requested, the investigator may need to provide additional follow -up information, such as 
discharge summaries, medical records, or extracts from the medical records.  
Information provided about t he serious adverse event must be consistent with that 
recorded on the Events CRF.  
9.2.1.5  Reporting Serious Adverse Events After the Protocol -required 
Reporting Period  
There is no requirement to monitor study subjects for serious adverse events following 
the protocol -required reporting period (as defined in Section 9.2.1.1 ) or after end of 
study.  However, these serious adverse events should be reported to Amgen (regardless 
of causality) if the investigator becomes aware of them.  In some countries (eg, 
European Union member states), investigators are required to rep ort serious adverse 
events that they become aware of after end of study.  If serious adverse events are 
reported, the investigator is to report them to Amgen within 24 hours following the 
investigator’s knowledge of the event.  The investigator should use the paper -based 
Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form to report the event.  
Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol -required reporting period will be 
captured within the safety database as clinical trial cases for the purposes of exp edited 
reporting.   
9.3 Pregnancy and Lactation Reporting  
If a female subject becomes pregnant, or a male subject fathers a child, while the 
subject is taking denosumab  report the pregnancy to Amgen Global Patient Safety as 
specified below.

Protocol Number:  20140444  
Date:  10 July 2023  Page 70 of 94 
CONFIDENTIAL    
In addition to repor ting any pregnancies occurring during the study, investigators should 
report pregnancies that occur within 5  months after the last dose of Amgen 
investigational product .  
The pregnancy should be reported to Amgen Global Patient Safety within 24  hours of 
the investigator’s knowledge of the event of a pregnancy.  Report a pregnancy on the 
Pregnancy Notification Worksheet ( Appendix  C).  Amgen Global Patient Safety will 
follow -up with the investigator regarding additional information that may be requested.  
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study, the investigator should attempt 
to obtain information regarding the birth o utcome and health of the infant.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets a criterion for immediate classification as a 
serious adverse event (eg, female subject experiences a spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, 
or neonatal death or there is a fetal or neonatal  congenital anomaly) the investigator will 
report the event as a serious adverse event.   
If a female breastfeeds while taking protocol -required therapies report the lactation case 
to Amgen as specified below.  
Any lactation case should be reported to Amgen  Global Patient Safety within 24  hours of 
the investigator’s knowledge of event.  Report a lactation case on the Lactation 
Notification Worksheet ( Appendix  C).  Amgen Global Patient Safety will follow -up with 
the investigator regarding additional information that may be requested.  
If a male subject's female partner becomes pregnant, the investigator should discuss 
obtaining information regarding the birt h outcome and health of the infant from the 
pregnant partner.

CONFIDENTIAL    
10.1.2.9  PK Analysis Set  
The PK analysis set includes all subjects in the FAS who have  1 serum denosumab 
reported result.  
10.1.3  Covariates and Subgroups  
10.1.3.1  Covariates  
The following covariates are assumed to have prognostic value with respect to the 
lumbar spine BMD Z -score as assessed by DXA.  The covariate’s association with the 
primary endpoint might be investigated.  
 Sex (Male/Female)  
 Race (White, non -White)  
 Age (years)  
 Baseline lumbar spine BMD Z -score  
 Baseline glucocorticoid dose  
10.1.4  Handling of Missing and Incomplete Data  
Subjects may have missing specific data points for a variety of causes.  In general, data 
may be missing due to a subject’s early withdrawal from study, a missed visit, or 
non-evaluability of a specific clinical measurement at its planned clinical visit.  Missing 
data will not be imputed for this study.  
10.2 Samp le Size Considerations  
The study will enroll 24  subjects.  Assuming that approximately 10 of subjects will not 
be evaluable at month  12 for the primary efficacy endpoint due to dropout, the analysis 
set for the primary efficacy endpoint will include appro ximately 20  subjects.   
10.3 Access to Individual Subject Treatment Assignments by Amgen or 
Designees  
Blinded individuals will not have access to unblinded information until the study is 
formally unblinded at the final analysis.  Unblinding and potentially unblinding information 
should not be distributed to the study team, investigators or subjects prior to the study 
being formally unblinded at the final analysis, except as specified (eg, Section  5.3 and 
Section  9.2.1.2 ).  

Product:  Denosumab  
Protocol Number:  20140444  
Date:  10 July 2023  Page 74 of 94 
CONFIDENTIAL    
Individual subject treatment assignments will be maintained by the IVRS/IW RS.  Any 
unplanned unblinding occurring during the study period will be documented and reported 
in the final clinical study report.  The Independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) 
members and the Independent Biostatistical Group will have access to the tr eatment 
assignments and subject level data from the clinical trial database.  Amgen staff 
members who are involved in randomization, biological sample management, performing 
PK and anti -denosumab antibody assay analysis will have treatment assignment 
information but will not have access to the subject level data from the clinical database.  
10.4 Planned Analyses  
10.4.1  Interim Analyses  
No interim analysis is planned for the study.  
10.4.2  Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)  
An external, independent DMC will be used to oversee progress of the study and make 
recommendations relating to early closure/extension or alteration of the study based on 
ongoing monitoring of the study data.  The DMC will be comprised of members external  
to Amgen.  The DMC members will have access to treatment assignments in order to 
monitor safety and efficacy results to protect subjects.  To minimize the potential 
introduction of bias, the DMC members will not have any direct contact with the study 
team , site personnel, or subjects.  An independent statistical service provider will 
generate unblinded reports for review by the DMC.  If at any time there are safety 
concerns, the DMC will communicate the concerns to a representative from Amgen 
senior manage ment.  A charter specifying the DMC functions will be written with the 
agreement of the DMC members.  Last DMC was in March 2022 as all subjects have 
completed 12 -month double blind treatment period of the study.    
10.4.3  Primary Analysis  
The primary analysis wil l be conducted at  the time of the final analysis .   
10.4.4  Final Analysis  
The final analysis for the study, including the analysis of the primary endpoint, will be 
performed when all enrolled subjects have had the opportunity to complete the 36 -month 
follow -up.

10.5 Planned Methods of Analysis  
10.5.1  General Considerations  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for demographics and subject characteristics, 
efficacy, PROs, and safety data.  Descriptive statistics of continuous measurements will 
include means, medians, stand ard deviations, and ranges, while categorical data will be 
summarized using counts and percentages.  
10.5.2  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD Z -score at 12  months will be analyzed 
based on the primary DXA analysis set using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model including treatment (denosumab vs placebo), baseline age (age at informed 
consent), and baseline BMD Z -score.  Missing baseline and postbaseline BMD Z -scores 
will not be imputed.  The superiority of denosumab compared to placebo for the primary 
efficacy endpoint will be estimated from the 12 -month least -squares (LS) mean of the 
treatment difference (denosumab – placebo) and the corresponding 95  confidence 
interval.   
A sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpo int will be conducted in the 
DXA analysis set, in subjects with baseline and ≥ 1 postbaseline valid DXA 
assessments, using a repeated measures analysis.   Treatment (denosumab vs 
placebo), study visit (6, and 12 months), baseline age, baseline BMD Z -score, will 
be included as fixed effects, and treatment -by-visit included as an interaction.   
Study visit will be treated as a categorical variable.   The 12 -month LS mean of the 
treatment difference (denosumab – placebo) and the corresponding 95% 
confidence interval and associated p -value will be estimated.   Unstructured 
variance –covariance structure will be used for estimation in the repeated 
measures analysis.   Other variance -covariance structure may be substituted if 
convergence problem arises.   
10.5.3  Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
Secondary efficacy endpoints will be assessed without multiplicity adjustment.  
10.5.3.1  Other Change From Baseline in BMD Z -score by DXA  
For each skeletal site (lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck) , change from baseline 
in BMD Z -score wil l be analyzed using the same repeated measures analysis as 
described for the sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint in Section 10.5.2 .

fractures will be summarized by treatment group.  
10.5.3.3  Improved Vertebral Fracture  
The proportion of subjects with improved vertebral fracture will be summarized at each 
time point based on the vertebral fracture analysis set.  
10.5.3.4  Patient Reported Outcomes  
Patient reported outcomes (CHQ -PF-50, CHAQ disability index score, and WBFPRS) 
and their changes from baseline wi ll be summarized at 12, 24, and 36  months based on 
their respective PRO analysis set.  There is no imputation for missing baseline or 
postbaseline data.  
10.5.3.5  Growth Velocity  
Change from baseline in age -adjusted growth velocity endpoints will be summarized at 
12, 24, and 36  months based on the growth velocity analysis set.  There is no imputation 
for missing data.  
10.5.3.6  Serum Denosumab Concentrations  
Individual serum denosumab concentration -time data will be tabulated and presented 
graphically based on the PK analysis set.  A mean concentration -time profile will also be 
provided.  There will be no imputation for missing values.  
10.5.4  Safety Endpoints  
All safety endpoints will be analyzed separately for the 12-month double -blind period,  
24-month  treatment period  and overa ll study period (36 -month) . 
10.5.4.1  Adverse Events  
All adverse events will be summarized based on the respective safety analysis set.  
Subject incidence of all treatment -emergent adverse events and serious adverse events 
will be tabulated by system organ class and  preferred term.  Tables of fatal adverse 
events, adverse events leading to withdrawal from investigational product and 
treatment -emergent adverse events of interest will also be provided.

10.5.4.2  Clinical Laboratory Measurements  
Actual values and changes from bas eline in each parameter will be descriptively 
summarized at each visit.  For serum albumin -adjusted calcium, phosphorus, and ALP, 
summary of the percent change from baseline also will be provided.  
Shifts in laboratory parameters between baseline and the mo st extreme postbaseline 
values will be assessed based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  
v 4.0.  
All laboratory analyses will be based on the safety analysis set.  Subjects with missing 
data for a scheduled visit will not contribute to t he tabulation for that time point 
(no imputation).  
10.5.4.3  Vital Signs  
Descriptive statistics of the actual values and changes from baseline in vital signs (heart 
rate, respiration rate, temperature) will be presented by visit based on the safety analysis 
set.  Su bjects with missing data for a scheduled visit will not contribute to the tabulation 
for that time point (no imputation).  
10.5.4.4  Antidenosumab Antibodies  
The incidence and percentage of subjects who develop antidenosumab antibodies 
(binding and, if positive, neut ralizing) at any time will be tabulated based on the safety 
analysis set.  
11. REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS  
11.1 Informed Consent  
An initial sample ICF is provided for the investigator to prepare the informed consent 
document to be used at his or her site.  Updates to the  template are to be communicated 
formally in writing from the Amgen Clinical Manager to the investigator.  The written ICF 
is to be prepared in the language(s) of the potential patient population.  
Before a subject’s participation in the clinical study, the  investigator is responsible for 
obtaining written informed consent from the subject or legally acceptable representative 
after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential 
hazards of the study and before any protocol -spec ific screening procedures or any 
investigational product(s) is/are administered.  A legally acceptable representative is an 
individual or other body authorized under applicable law to consent, on behalf of a 
prospective subject, to the subject’s participat ion in the clinical study.

CONFIDENTIAL    
The investigator is also responsible for asking the subject if the subject has a primary 
care physician and if the subject agrees to have his/her primary care physician informed 
of the subject’s participation in the clinical st udy.  If the subject agrees to such 
notification, the investigator is to inform the subject’s primary care physician of the 
subject’s participation in the clinical study.  If the subject does not have a primary care 
physician and the investigator will be a cting in that capacity, the investigator is to 
document such in the subject’s medical record.    
The acquisition of informed consent and the subject’s agreement or refusal of his/her 
notification of the primary care physician  is to be documented in the subject’s medical 
records, and the ICF  is to be signed and personally dated by the subject or a legally 
acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the informed consent 
discussion.  The original signed ICF is to be retained in accordance with  institutional 
policy, and a copy of the signed consent form is to be provided to the subject or legally 
acceptable representative.  
If a potential subject is illiterate or visually impaired and does not have a legally 
acceptable representative, the investi gator must provide an impartial witness to read the 
ICF to the subject and must allow for questions.  Thereafter, both the subject and the 
witness must sign the ICF to attest that informed consent was freely given and 
understood.  
In this study, obtaining assent from the child and consent from the parents or legally 
authorized representative, except if the child is very young, as defined by local law will 
apply.  A child is defined as a person who has not attained the legal age for consent for 
treatments or  procedures involved in clinical investigations, under the applicable law of 
the jurisdiction in which the clinical investigation will take place.  The local IRB/IEC will 
determine the process for obtaining and documenting the assent process for pediatric 
subject, but should follow the guidelines established by the Department of Health and 
Human Services Office of Human Research Protections guidelines, which state an 
explanation of the procedures involved in the study should be made in a language 
appropriat e to the child’s age, experience, maturity, and condition.  
11.2 Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
A copy of the protocol, proposed ICF, other written subject information, and any 
proposed advertising material must be submitted to the IRB/I EC for written approval.  A 
copy of the written approval of the protocol and ICF must be received by Amgen before 
recruitment of subjects into the study and shipment of Amgen investigational product.

for all subsequent protocol amendments and changes to the informed consent 
document.  The investigator is to notify the IRB/IEC  of deviations from the protocol or 
serious adverse events occurring at the site and other adverse ev ent reports received 
from Amgen, in accordance with local procedures.  
The investigator is responsible for obtaining annual IRB/IEC  approval/renewal 
throughout the duration of the study.  Copies of the investigator’s reports and the 
IRB/IEC  continuance of a pproval must be sent to Amgen.  
11.3 Subject Confidentiality  
The investigator must ensure that the subject’s confidentiality is maintained for 
documents submitted to Amgen.   
 Subjects are to be identified by a unique subject identification number.   
 Where permit ted, date of birth is to be documented and formatted in accordance with 
local laws and regulations.   
 On the CRF demographics page, in addition to the unique subject identification 
number, include the age at time of signing of informed consent.   
 For serio us adverse events reported to Amgen, subjects are to be identified by their 
unique subject identification number, initials (for faxed reports, in accordance with 
local laws and regulations), and date of birth (in accordance with local laws and 
regulations) . 
 Documents that are not submitted to Amgen (eg, signed ICFs) are to  be kept in 
confidence by the investigator, except as described below.  
In compliance with governmental/International Conference on Harmonisation GCP 
Guidelines, it is required that the inv estigator and institution permit authorized 
representatives of the company, of the regulatory agency(s), and the IRB/IEC  direct 
access to review the subject’s original medical records for verification of study -related 
procedures and data.  Direct access in cludes examining, analyzing, verifying, and 
reproducing any records and reports that are important to the evaluation of the study.  
The investigator is obligated to inform and obtain the consent of the subject to permit 
such individuals to have access to h is/her study -related records, including personal 
information.

interpretation of the study  
 An investigator contributing a high numb er of eligible subjects  
12. ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL OBLIGATIONS  
12.1 Protocol Amendments and Study Termination  
Amgen may amend the protocol at any time.  After Amgen amends the protocol, the 
investigator is to return the signed Investigator’s Signature page confir ming agreement 
to continue participation in the study according to the amendment.  The IRB/IEC  must be 
informed of all amendments and give approval.  The investigator must send a copy of 
the approval letter from the IRB/IEC  and amended protocol Investigato r’s Signature 
page to Amgen prior to implementation of the protocol amendment at their site.  
Amgen reserves the right to terminate the study at any time.  Both Amgen and the 
investigator reserve the right to terminate the investigator’s participation in th e study 
according to the Clinical Trial Agreement.  The investigator is to notify the IRB/IEC  in 
writing of the study’s completion or early termination and send a copy of the notification 
to Amgen.  
Subjects may be eligible for continued treatment with Amge n investigational product(s) 
by an extension protocol or as provided for by the local country’s regulatory mechanism.  
However, Amgen reserves the unilateral right, at its sole discretion, to determine 
whether to supply Amgen investigational product(s)  and by what mechanism, after 
termination of the study and before the product(s) is/are available commercially.  
12.2 Study Documentation and Archive  
The investigator is to maintain a list of appropriately qualified persons to whom he/she 
has delegated study duties.  All persons authorized to make entries and/or corrections 
on CRFs will be included on the Amgen Delegation of Authority Form.  
Source documents are original docu ments, data, and records from which the subject’s 
CRF data are obtained.  These include but are not limited to hospital records, clinical 
and office charts, laboratory and pharmacy records, diaries, microfiches, radiographs, 
and correspondence.  
In this stu dy, the IVR/IWR system captures the following data points and these are 
considered source data:  subject identification number, randomization date, 
randomization number, and treatment group assignment.   
Product:  Denosumab  
Protocol Number:  20140444  
Date:  10 July 2023  Page 81 of 94 
CONFIDENTIAL    
CRF entries may be considered source data if the CRF is the site of the original 
recording (ie, there is no other written or electronic record of data).  In this study, PROs 
may be considered as source documents.   
The investigator and study staff are respo nsible for maintaining a comprehensive and 
centralized filing system of all study -related (essential) documentation, suitable for 
inspection at any time by representatives from Amgen and/or applicable regulatory 
authorities.   
In addition, all original sou rce documents supporting entries in the CRFs must be 
maintained and be readily available.  
Retention of study documents will be governed by the Clinical Trial Agreement.  
12.3 Study Monitoring and Data Collection  
The Amgen representative(s) and regulatory authori ty inspectors are responsible for 
contacting and visiting the investigator for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, 
upon request, inspecting the various records of the clinical study (eg, CRFs and other 
pertinent data) provided that subject confid entiality is respected.  
The Clinical Monitor is responsible for verifying the CRFs at regular intervals throughout 
the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency 
of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the  conduct of clinical research.  The 
Clinical Monitor is to have access to subject medical records and other study -related 
records needed to verify the entries on the CRFs.  
The investigator agrees to cooperate with the Clinical Monitor to ensure that any 
problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in 
completing CRFs, are resolved.  
In accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation GCP and the sponsor’s 
audit plans, this study may be selected for audit by representat ives from Amgen’s Global 
Research & Development Compliance and Audit function (or designees).  Inspection of 
site facilities (eg, pharmacy, protocol -required therapy storage areas, laboratories) and 
review of study -related records will occur to evaluate th e study conduct and compliance 
with the protocol, International Conference on Harmonisation GCP, and applicable 
regulatory requirements.  
Data capture for this study is planned to be electronic:  
Product:  Denosumab  
Protocol Number:  20140444  
Date:  10 July 2023  Page 82 of 94 
CONFIDENTIAL    
 All source documentation supporting entries into the CRFs must  be maintained and 
readily available.  
 Updates to CRFs will be automatically documented through the software’s “audit 
trail.”  
 To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data 
management review is performed on subject dat a received at Amgen.  During this 
review, subject data are checked for consistency, omissions, and any apparent 
discrepancies.  In addition, the data are reviewed for adherence to the protocol and 
GCP.  To resolve any questions arising from the clinical da ta management review 
process, data queries are created in the EDC system database for site resolution 
and subsequently closed by the EDC system or by an Amgen reviewer.  
 The investigator signs only the Investigator Verification Form for this EDC study or 
the investigator applies an electronic signature in the EDC system if the study is set 
up to accept an electronic signature.  This signature indicates that investigator 
inspected or reviewed the data on the CRF, the data queries, and agrees with the 
content.  
Amgen (or designee) will perform self -evident corrections to obvious data errors in the 
clinical trial database.  Self -evident corrections will be documented in the CRF Standard 
Instructions and the CRF Specific Instructions, both of these will be availab le through the 
EDC system.  Examples of obvious data errors that may be corrected by Amgen 
(or designee) include deletion of obvious duplicate data (ie, the same results sent twice 
with the same date with different visit, [eg, week 4 and early termination] ) and updating a 
specific response if the confirming datum is provided in the “other, specify” field (eg, for 
race, reason for ending study).  
12.4 Investigator Responsibilities for Data Collection  
The investigator is responsible for complying with the requirem ents for all assessments 
and data collection (including subjects not receiving protocol -required therapies) as 
stipulated in the protocol for each subject in the study.  For subjects who withdraw prior 
to completion of all protocol -required visits and are unable or unwilling to continue the 
Schedule of Assessments  (Table  2), the investigator can search publically available 
records [where permitted]) to ascertain survival status.   This ensures that the data set(s) 
produced as an outcome of the study is/are as comprehensive as possible.   
12.5 Language  
CRFs must be completed in English.  TRADENAMES (if used) for concomitant 
medications may be entered in the lo cal language.   
All written information and other material to be used by subjects and investigative staff 
must use vocabulary and language that are clearly understood.

12.6 Publication Policy  
To coordinate dissemination of data from this study, Amgen may faci litate the formation 
of a publication committee consisting of several investigators and appropriate Amgen 
staff,  the governance and responsibilities of which are set forth in a Publication Charter .  
The committee is expected to solicit input and assistance  from other investigators and to 
collaborate with authors and Amgen staff as appropriate  as defined in the Publication 
Charter .  Membership on the committee (both for investigators and Amgen staff) does 
not guarantee authorship.  The criteria described bel ow are to  be met for every 
publication.  
Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis 
of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors) Recommendations for the 
Conduct of Reporting, Editing, and Publicati ons of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, 
which states:  
 Authorship credit should  be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception and 
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the 
article or revising it criti cally for important intellectual content; (3) final approval of the 
version to be published; and (4) agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the 
work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the 
work are appropr iately investigated and resolved.  Authors should meet conditions 1, 
2, 3 and 4.  
 When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group should  identify 
the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals 
shoul d fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above.  
 Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research 
group, alone, does not justify authorship.  
 All persons designated as authors should  qualify for authorship, and all those who 
qualify should  be listed.  
 Each author should  have participated sufficiently in the work to take public 
responsibility for appropriate portions of the content.  
Additional information on the current guidelines for pu blications can be found at the 
following location:  http://www.icmje.org/.  
All publications (eg, manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) 
based on this study must be submitted to Amgen for review.  The Clinical Trial 
Agreement among  the institution, investigator, and Amgen will detail the procedures for, 
and timing of, Amgen’s review of publications.

Drug -induced Liver Injury Reporting and Additional Assessments  
Reporting  
To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of DILI, cases of concurrent AST or ALT 
and TBL and/or INR elevation according to the criteria specified in Section 6.4 require 
the following:  
 The event is to be reported to Amgen as a serious adverse event within 24  hours of 
discovery or notification of the even t (ie, before additional etiologic investigations 
have been concluded)  
 The appropriate CRF (eg, Events eCRF) that captures information necessary to 
facilitate the evaluation of treatment -emergent liver abnormalities is to be completed 
and sent to the Amgen . 
Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Section 9.2.1.3 . 
Additional Clinical Assessments and Observation  
All subjects in whom investigational product or protocol -required therapies is/are 
withheld (either permanently or conditionally) due to potential DILI (Section 6.4.1 ) or who 
experience AST or ALT elevations  3 x ULN (except for subjects with 
dystrophinopathies) are to undergo a period of “close observatio n” until abnormalities 
return to normal or to the subject’s baseline levels Assessments that are to be 
performed during this period include:  
 Repeat AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin (total and direct), and INR as clinically necessary 
until laboratory abnormalitie s improve.  
 Obtain pediatric gastroenterologist or pediatric hepatologist consult  
 The diagnostic approach (including blood tests) to investigate alternative causes 
for abnormal liver tests is to be determined in consultation with a pediatric 
gastroenterolog ist or hepatologist.  
 The “close observation” is to continue until all laboratory abnormalities return to 
baseline or normalize and subject’s clinical condition improves.

Study ID: [REMOVED]  
 
Amendment Date:  10 July 2023  
 
Rationale:  
The protocol has been amended to remove specific endpoints that will not be met for 
end of study  and to align with European Medicines Agency/ Paediatric Committee 
(EMA/PDCO ) Modification Summary Report provided by the EMA.   Changes including, 
but not limited to, the following are being incorporated into the protocol:  
 Updated secondary objectives and endpoints:  
o Replaced “from pre -treatment to post -treatment” with “compared to 
baseline” to clarify that the determination of improving vertebral fracture is 
to compare with baseline spine X -ray. 
o Removed language ‘overall among subjects with clinical fracture 
reduction, and amo ng subjects with clinical fracture increase’ as it is not 
statistically meaningful to perform a subgroup analysis in a study that has 
only enrolled globally 24 subjects.  
o Updated language to clarify that new and worsening vertebral and 
nonvertebral fracture s will be used to evaluate the effect of denosumab in 
children with Glucocorticoid (GC) -induced osteoporosis (GiOP).  
 Updated Section 1.3:  Safety to delete the evaluation of metaphysical index and 
Molar eruption and mandibular shaping.  
 Added footnote q stating that after the protocol required reporting period or after 
end of study, serious adverse events will be reported to Amgen.  
 Added language to Section  2.3.2  to clarify that pediatric patients with 
osteogenesis imperfecta, severe life  threatening adverse events of

Q3M dosing period (> 60 days from the previous dose) in Study 20130173 . 
 Updated language in Section 10.4.2 to clarify that the last data management 
committee was i n March 2022 as all subjects have completed 12 -month double 
blind treatment period of the study . 
 Updated language in Section 10.5.2  to add additional language on sensitivity 
analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint . 
 Updated language in Section 10.5.4: Safety endpoints to clarify that safety 
endpoints will be analyzed for the 12-month double -blind period,  24-month  
treatment period  and overall study period (36 -month) . 
 Removed Abnormal Metaphyseal Index Z score, Abnormal Molar Eruption, and 
Abnormal Mandibular Shaping Section 10 .5.4.5 . 
 Administrative, typographical, abbreviations, and formatting changes were made 
throughout the protocol.

EudraCT number 2016 -003083 -39 
NCT number [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Amendment Date:  20 April 2021  
 
Rationale:  
The following changes were made to the protocol dated 20 April 2021 . 
 Updated the nu mber of subjects enrolled in the study . 
 The study was initially designed to enroll 150 p atients, to attain at least 
100 evaluable patients for the primary analysis and has been running since 
June  2017; however , as of December 2020, only 24 patients have  been enrolled 
at 36 cli nical sites activated globally.  
 Following agreement from the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) and the 
European Medicines Agency ( EMA ), Amgen made a decision to end enrollment 
into this study.  The primary reason to re quest FDA and EMA agreement for early 
discontinuation is that there are too few children with the disease or condition to 
study, and this is not due to safety or efficacy concerns.  In order to maximize the 
value of the data from this study in this rare pe diatric population, subjects who 
have been enrolled in the study will be allowed to complete the study , as defined 
in the protocol (ie,  to last visit at 36 months).  As of January 2021, enrolment of 
subjects i nto this study has been closed.  The study is a nticipated to end when 
the remaining su bjects will have reached the 36  months visit.  
 Aligned the protocol with current Amgen protocol template and safety reporting 
language.  
 Administrative and editorial changes were completed as part of this amendment.

Amendment Date:  14 February 2017 
 
Rationale:  
The purpose of this protocol  amendment is to reflect changes in the design of protocol 
20140444 arising from concerns around the acceptabilit y and feasibility of subject 
exposure to placebo for 24 months. Major changes include:  
• Subjects in the placebo arm will transition to open- label denosumab at 12 months 
and continue open- label denosumab for an additional 12 months . 
• Secondary objectives and endpoints have been updated to reflect the change in 
placebo duration . 
• The study schema has been updated to reflect these revisions . 
Statistical revisions:  
• The primary analysis will be conducted at the time of the final analysis . 
• To remain in alignment with the key binding elements in the current PIP  
(Decision P/0058/2016) , the primary analysis has been updated to use an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, replacing the repeated measures 
analysis .  The repeated measures analysis has now been included as a 
sensitivity analysis.  
• Following current guidelines on handling of missing data, the protocol has been 
updated to include imputation rules for analysis of the primary endpoint . 
Other revisions:  
• Language added to clarify the end of  study date.  
• Language regarding the reasons for stopping Amgen investigational product has 
been reorganized to ensure the reasons are mutually exclusive.

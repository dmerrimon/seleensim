Phase 1 Dose Escalation  
Phase 1 is the dose-escalation phase, which will include up to 6 cohorts of subjects treated with 
epacadostat at doses of 25 mg twice daily (BID), 50 mg BID, 75 mg BID, 100 mg BID, and 300 mg BID in combination with durvalumab 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg given on Day 1 of each 14- day cycle.  A minimum 
of 3 subjects will be enrolled and treated in each cohort, and all 3 subjects will be observed for a minimum of 42 days before the subsequent cohort begins enrollment.  Subjects must have received the 
cohort- specific dose of epacadostat for at least 75% of the doses (63 doses) and have received at least 
3 doses of durvalumab during the 42-day dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period, or have 
experienced a DLT to be evaluable for dose tolerability.  Additional subjects will be enrolled in a cohort to achieve the minimum of 3 evaluable subjects if dropouts or dose interruptions/reductions occur that 
result in a subject being n onevaluable for DLTs.  
The dose of epacadostat will be escalated if 0 of the first 3 evaluable subjects enrolled experience a DLT.  
If 1 of the first 3 evaluable subjects enrolled experience a DLT, the cohort will be expanded to include 3 additional evaluab
le subjects.  If 2 or more of either 3 or 6 subjects enrolled experience a DLT, the prior 
dose level will be considered the MTD.  If only 3 subjects were treated at this dose level, the dose will be confirmed as the MTD by evaluation of an additional 3 sub jects before this dose is recommended for 
Phase 2 testing.   
The cohorts and dose levels are shown in the table below. 
Cohort  Maximum Daily Dose of Epacadostat  Dose of Durvalumab  
(Once Every 14 Days)  
1 25 mg BID orally  3 mg/kg IV  
2 25 mg BID orally  10 mg /kg IV  
3 50 mg BID orally  10 mg/kg IV  
4 75 mg BID orally  10 mg/kg IV  
5 100 mg BID orally  10 mg/kg IV  
6 300 mg BID orallya 10 mg/kg IV  
IV = intravenous.  
a Intermediate dose levels may be explored based on emerging PK or pharmacodynamic data.  
Phase 2  
Approximately 140 to 192 subjects with advanced melanoma, NSCLC, SCCHN, TNBC, gastric or 
GE junction cancer, or TCC of the GU tract will be enrolled at the MTD or PAD of epacadostat in 
combination with durvalumab.  The approximate number of subjects needed for the melanoma, TNBC, 
and gastric and GE junction cancer cohorts will be determined using the Simon 2- stage design:  Stage 1 
will be the initial number of subjects per tumor type, and the decision to proceed with Stage 2 will be determined by the response rate observed in Stage 1.   If more than 1 PAD is evaluated, the cohort may or 
may not be repeated for the specified tumor type as indicated in the table below.  The sponsor may limit 
enrollment of a specific tumor type to Stage 1.

Gastric and GE junction cancer  9 11 20 
Under Amendment 6, enrollment of the NSCLC, SCCHN, and TCC of the GU tract cohorts will be 
complete d as expansion cohorts at the 300 mg BID dose level.  The sample size for each cohort will be 
increased to account for the heterogeneity of PD-1 pathway–treated and PD-1 pathway–naive subjects 
within the selected tumor types.  The approximate number of sub jects per tumor type is listed in the table

Protocol INCB 24360- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
below, and the number of PD -1 pathway –treated subjects in each cohort will be limited to 10 in order to 
reduce the risk of any cohort having a significant imbalance between PD-1 pathway–treated and PD -1 
pathway–naive subjects, thereby preserving the predicted levels of baseline efficacy observed with PD -1 
pathway monotherapy.  Subjects enrolled at the 100 mg BID will be analyzed independently.

a Subjects enrolled in the 100 mg BID dose level were enrolled before Amendment 5.  
b All subjects in the 300 mg BID NSCLC, SCCHN, and TCC of the GU tract cohorts enrolled in Amendment 5 or earlier  are 
included in the total sample size.  
The study will consist of 3 periods: 
Screening:   Up to 28 days. 
Treatment Period:   The treatment period will continue every 14 days for up to 12 months as long as 
subjects are receiving benefit from treatment and hav e not met any criteria for study withdrawal.  Once 
subjects complete 12 months of study treatment or permanently discontinue study treatment for any other 
reason, the end-of-treatment (EOT) visit should be conducted, and they should enter the safety follow-up 
period of the study. 
Protocol Amendment 6 (28 JUN 2017) removed the option for subjects to receive epacadostat 
monotherapy once they completed 12 months of combination therapy with durvalumab.  However, 
subjects already receiving epacadostat monotherap y prior to Amendment 6 were allowed  to continue if 
they were receiving clinical benefit and their investigator felt it was in the best interest of the subject.  
These subjects will be allowed to continue epacadostat monotherapy for up to an additional 12 m onths, 
and their maximum overall study treatment duration should not exceed 24 months.  Exceptions for these 
subjects to  contin ue study treatment beyond 24 months will require medical monitor review and approval 
every 3 months. 
Follow -Up Period:   The safet y follow -up visits will occur at 42 days and 90 days after the EOT visit or 
after the last dose of study treatment (if the EOT was not performed).   
Study Drug s, Dosage s, and Mode s of Administration:  
Epacadostat  will be self -administered orally BID without regard to food and continued BID during each 
14-day cycle.  The MTD  or PAD  of epacadostat  defined during Phase 1 will be used for Phase 2. 
All BID doses will be taken morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart.  If a dose is missed by 
more than 4 hours, that dose should be skipped and the next dose should be taken  at the scheduled time.   
If the subject vomits, an additional dose should not be taken.  I ntrasubject dose escalation of epacadostat 
is not allowed. 
Durvalumab  is an investigational agent and will be administered at 3 mg/kg  or 10 mg/kg over 
60 minutes on Day 1 of each  14-day cycle  for up to 12 months .  There will be an observation period of 
3 hours after the first dose of durvalumab  is administered .  Intrasubject dose escalation of durvalum ab is 
not allowed  except as defined in the body of the Protocol. 
Reference Therapy , Dosage,  and Mode of Administration :  Not applicable.  
Duration of Participation:   Subject participation is expected to average approximately 6 months. 
Study Population:  
Subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced  melanoma, NSCLC, pancreatic cancer  
(Phase 1 only) , SCCHN, TNBC, gastric or  GE junction cancer, or TCC of the GU tract  will be enrolled.

Subjects who have received experimental vaccines or other immune therapies should be discussed with 
the medical monitor to confirm eligibility.  
Note:   The exception to this exclusion criterion would be subjects who have received a prior 
anti−CTLA-4 or PD -1 pathway targeted agent for indications in which an anti –CTLA-4 or PD -1 
pathway targeted agent has been approved (eg, melanoma).  In this case, t he subject would be eligible 
to participate in the study. 
• Receipt of an immunologically based treatment for any reason, including chronic use of systemic 
steroid at doses ≥ 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent within 14 days prior to the first dose of study 
treatment.  Use of inhaled or topical steroids or systemic corticosteroids < 10 mg is permitted.

1. INTRODUCTION 
INCB 24360-203 is a Phase 1/2 study of epacadostat  administered in combination with 
durvalumab in subjects with advanced  melanoma, NSCLC, pancreatic cancer  (Phase 1 only), 
SCCHN , TNBC, gastric or  GE junction cancer, and TCC  of the GU tract .  Phase 1 will be an 
open- label  dose escalation to identify the MTD or PAD of epacadostat  in combination with 
durvalumab.  Phase 2 will further explore the safety and efficacy of the MTD  or PAD  of 
epacadostat  in combination with durvalumab det ermined in Phase 1.  Epacadostat represents a 
novel, potent, and selective inhibitor of the enzyme IDO1 in both human tumor cells and human 
DCs.  
Durvalumab is a human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody directed against human PD-L1.  The antibody is composed of 2 identical heavy chains of approximately 49,670 Da each, and 2 identical light chains of approximately 23,390 Da each.  The fragment crystallizable domain of 
durvalumab contains a triple mutation in the constant domain of the IgG1 heavy chain that 
reduces binding to the complement component C1q and the fragment crystallizable  gamma 
receptors responsible for mediating antibody- dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity.  
For a thorough discussion of the pharmacology of epacadostat  and durvalumab, refer to the 
epacadostat  Investigator's Brochure ( iIB) and the current  durvalumab Investigator' s 
Brochure  (mIB). 
1.1. Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background  
The immune system has the innate ability to detect and eliminate aberrant cells, including tumor 
cells.  This occurs through T cells by recognizing the aberrant proteins of malignant cells and 
coordinating an immune response against them.  Tum or cells have been shown to evade the 
immune system by exploiting the immune checkpoint pathways that down regulate the immune 
response to avoid healthy tissue damage ( Davies  2014).  Immune therapies targeting the immune 
checkpoint pathways have recently become an important therapeutic strategy for harnessing the immune system's ability to control malignancy.  The PD -1 pathway and the 
tryptophan- catabolizing enzyme, IDO1 , are 2 components of the checkpoint pathways that have 
been  shown to be present in the tumor microenvironment and appear to be valid immunotherapy 
targets for generating a successful immune response ( Creelan  2014, Spranger  et al 2014).  
1.1.1. Inhibition of PD -1 Signaling as a Target for Cancer 
The PD -1 receptor-ligand interaction is a key component to the immune checkpoint pathway.  
The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T cells under normal conditions, is to down-modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including 
autoimmune reactions.  Similar to CTLA -4, PD- 1 is a surface receptor member of the B7 -CD28 
superfamily.  It has been shown to induce T- cell tolerance by negatively regulating antigen 
receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 and/or PD- L2) ( Talmadge et al 2007, 
Creelan  2014).  The mechanism by which PD-1 down-modulates T- cell responses is similar to 
but distinct from that of CTLA -4, as both mol ecules regulate an overlapping set of signaling 
proteins ( Hiraoka 2010, Nobili et al 2008).  PD -1 has been shown to be expressed on activated 
lymphocytes, including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, Tregs, and natural killer

Protocol INCB 24360- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
cells ( Hodi and Dranoff 2010, Kloor 2009).  The ligands for PD- 1 (PD -L1 and PD- L2) are 
expressed in several cell types, including nonhematopoietic tissues and many tumors 
(Lee et al 2008, Leffers  et al 2009, Nishimura  et al 2000, Hiraoka 2010).  Binding of either PD-1 
ligand to PD-1 inhibits T- cell activation triggered through the T- cell receptor.  PD -L1 is 
expressed at low levels on various nonhematopoietic tissues, most notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD-L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen- presenting cells 
found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  PD-L2 is thought to control 
immune T -cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD-L1 serves to dampen unwarranted 
T-cell function in peripheral tissues ( Hiraoka 2010).  PD -L1 is  expressed in many human tumors 
and has been associated with a poor prognosis ( Thompson et al 200 7, Konishi et al  2004, 
Hamanishi  et al 2007, Nomi et al  2007, Boland et al 2013).  This evidence suggests that the 
PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and that upregulation of this 
pathway contributes to immune tolerance and tumor progression and should be considered as a target for the therapeutic intervention of cancer.  
1.1.2. Inhibition of IDO1 as a Target for Cancer 
Recent interest has focused on the role of IDO1 as a mechanism of immune tolerance in malignancy ( Godin- Ethier  et al 2011).  IDO1 is a heme-containing, monomeric oxidoreductase 
that catalyzes the degradation of the essential amino acid tryptophan to N -formyl -kynurenine.  
Kynurenine can be subsequently metabolized through a series of enzymatic steps to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.  IDO1 is the first rate-limiting enzyme in one of the breakdown pathways of tryptophan. 
The expression and activity profiles of IDO1 are distinct from those of tryptophan dioxygenase, 
an enzyme predominantly expressed in liver that catalyzes the same enzymatic reaction as IDO1 and maintains proper tryptophan balance in response to dietary uptake.  In contrast to tryptophan 
dioxygenase, IDO1 is expressed in a variety of tissues, with particularly high levels found in 
areas of contact with potential sources of immune challenge (eg, gut, respiratory tract, placenta, 
spleen), consistent with a role for regulating tryptophan metabolism in a local microenvironment 
(Mellor  and Munn 2004).  Within the immune system, IDO1 activity is specifically induced in 
cells such as DCs and macrophages at localized sites of inflammation ( Munn and Mellor 2007).  
IDO1 -driven oxidation of tryptophan results in a strong inhibitory effect on the development of 
T-cell mediated responses by blocking T-cell activation and inducing T-cell apoptosis 
(Mellor  et al 2003).  Both the reduction in local tryptophan levels and the production of 
tryptophan catabolites that are inhibitory to cell proliferation contribute to the 
immunosuppressive effects ( Frumento et al 2002).  IDO1 activity also promotes the 
differentiation of naive T cells to Treg s (Fallarino  et al 2006).  Since increased Treg activity has 
been shown to promote tumor growth and Treg depletion has been shown to allow an otherwise ineffectual antitumor immune response to occur ( Zou 2006), IDO1 expansion of Tregs may 
provide an additional mechanism whereby IDO1 could promote an immunosuppressive 
environment. 
A critical role for IDO1 in immune modulation has been confirmed in numerous animal models, 
including models of allograft tolerance, inflammation, and cancer ( Mellor  and Munn 2004).  
While IDO1 inhibition can exacerbate disease in models of autoimmune disorders ( Mellor  and 
Munn 2004), IDO1 null mice show no evidence of susceptibility to developing spontaneous

open- label, dose escalation study of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab, ORR  
(according to the modified World Health Organization criteria) for all subjects in the concurrent regimen group was 40%.  Evidence of clinical activity (conventional, unconfirmed, or immune -related response or SD for ≥ 24 weeks) was observed in 65% of subjects.  In 17 subjects 
treated at the maximum doses that were associated with an acceptable level of AEs, 53% of subjects had an objective response compared with ipilimumab monotherapy (10.9%), all with tumor reduction of ≥ 80%.  Grade 3 or 4 AEs related to therapy occurred in 53% of subjects in 
the concurrent- regimen group but were qualitatively similar to previous experience with 
monotherapy and were generally reversible ( Wolchok et al 2013).  
In the Phase 2 randomized, double-blinded study of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab versus i pilimumab alone in subjects with previously untreated, unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma, the investigator- assessed ORR among subjects  with BRAF wild -type tumors was 
61% (95% CI, 49 to 72) in the combination group versus 11% in the ipilimumab monotherapy group.  A CR was observed in 16 subjects  (22%) in the combination group and no subjects  in the 
ipilimumab  monotherapy group.  In subjects  with BRAF wild -type tumors, median PFS was not 
reached with the combination and was 4.4 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 5.7) w ith ipilimumab  
monotherapy (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.68; p < 0.001).  Among subjects with BRAF mutation 
positive tumors, the ORR  was 52% (12 of 23 subjects) in the combination group.  M edian PFS 
for the combination was 8.5 months (95% CI, 2.8 to not estimable) and 2.7 months (95% CI, 1.0 to 5.4) in the ipilimumab  monotherapy group.   The rate of treatment -related AEs was 91% in 
the combination group and 93% in the ipilimumab monotherapy group.  Drug -related AEs of 
Grade 3 or 4 were reported more frequently in the combination group than in the ipilimumab monotherapy group (54% vs 24%).  Select AEs with potential immunological causes were 
consistent with the Phase 1 study, and most of the events resolved with immune-modulating 
medication  (Postow et  al 2015).  
As described above, IDO1 is another negative regulatory mechanism that contributes to 
tumor-derived immune suppression.  In preclinical models, IDO1 inhibition has been shown to 
synergize with blockade of either anti −CTLA -4 or anti−PD-1/PD-L1 in delaying tumor growth 
and increasing OS (Holmgaard  et al 2013, Spranger  et al 2014).  This effect was shown to be 
T-cell−dependent, leading to enhanced T- cell proliferation and  interleukin-2 production within 
the tumor and to a marked increase in the effector -to-regulatory T- cell ratios in the tumors.  
In an ongoing Phase 1/2  open- label dose- escalation study of epacadostat  in combination with 
ipilimumab (3  mg/kg IV), daily doses of  epacadostat  have been evaluated in 21- day cycles.  In 
the initial Phase 1 dose-escalation portion, 5 of 7 subjects  receiving epacadostat 300 mg BID in 
combination with 4 doses of ipilimumab (3 mg/kg every 3 weeks) developed clinically 
significant ALT elevations; therefore, the study was amended to evaluate lower epacadostat 
doses.  At the 300 mg BID dose level, 6 of 7 subjects had evaluable scans and all showed SD  as 
assessed by irRC .  Enrollment was restarted at 25 mg BID (n  = 8), where 1 subject with 
progression of prior extensive liver metastases had a dose- limiting toxicity ( DLT ; Grade 3 AST 
elevation).  Subsequent cohorts received 50 mg BID continuous, 50 mg BID interm ittent 
(2 weeks on, 1 week off), and 75 mg BID (50 mg every morning/25 mg every evening) in 
combination with 4 doses of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks.  Eighteen subjects were 
enrolled in the 50 mg BID continuous dosing cohort, and 4 DLTs were reported (1 Grade 3

tumor.  Whenever possible, patients should have tumor tissue assessed for the presence of a 
driver mutation that stimulates tumor growth.  These mutations define subsets of patients like ly 
to respond to specific inhibitors ( NCCN  Guidelines ).  Patients with a known driver mutation in 
the EGFR are initially managed with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( Moran  and 
Sequist 2012, Gridelli et al 2012).  Those with an anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion oncogene 
in their tumor are preferentially treated with crizotinib ( Kwak  et al 2010, Camidge  et al 2012, 
Shaw  et al 2013).  Patients without a driver mutation are generally treated with chemotherapy.  
Most patients with advanced NSCLC eventually develop PD and require additional treatment 
after their initial treatment with either chemother apy or targeted therapy.  Currently approved 
cytotoxic chemotherapies for previously treated patients with NSCLC demonstrate few objective responses, which are generally of short duration, with limited impact on PFS and OS. 
Phase 1 studies of anti −PD-1 age nts have demonstrated promising results.  The FDA granted 
approval for pembrolizumab for the treatment of  metastatic NSCLC.  P embrolizumab was 
approved for patients whose tumors express PD- L1 as determined by an FDA -approved test and 
who have disease progression on or after platinum-containing regimens ( Garon  et al 2015 ).  
Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on an 
FDA -approved therapy for these aberrations before receiving pembr olizumab.  In the Phase 1 
study by Garon  et al (2015), an ORR of 19.4% was reported in the 495 NSCLC patients who 
received monotherapy pembrolizumab.  Median duration of response was 12.5 months, median 
PFS was 3.7 months, and OS was 12 months.  Nivolumab was also approved by the FDA and the 
EU for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with progression after 
chemotherapy.  In the U nited States , patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations 
should also have disease progression on an FDA-approved therapy for these agents.  The Phase 3 study comparing nivolumab to docetaxel resulted in an OS of 12.2 months (95% CI, 9.7 to 15.0) 
among 292 subjects in the nivolumab group and 9.4 months among the 290 subjects  in the 
docetaxel group (HR, 0.73; 96% CI, 0.59 to 0.89; p = 0.002).  The response rate with nivolumab 
was 19% as compared with 12% in the docetaxel group (p = 0.02) ( Borghaei  et al 2015). 
In addition to PD-1 inhibition, drugs targ eting PD -L1 have also shown promising data.  
MPDL3280A, a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks PD-L1 from binding to its 
receptors, including PD-1 and B7.1, has shown similar efficacy.  In a Phase 1 study that included 
subjects with both squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC; ORR was 24% (9/37), and at the time of the abstract publication, all responses were ongoing and improving ( Soria  et al 2013).  The 
24-week PFS was 46%.  Analysis of biomarker data from tumor samples demonstrate d a 
correlation between PD -L1 status and efficacy  in both the MPDL3280A and pembrolizumab 
(MK-3475) studies. 
Targeting the IDO1 enzyme has been studied in subjects  with metastatic NSCLC as well in the 
form of vaccination with an epitope derived from IDO1.  In the Phase 1 study, no severe toxicities occurred.  One of 15 HLA-A2−positive subjects treated developed a PR after 1 year of 
vaccine treatment, and SD of ≥ 8.5 months was reported in another 6 subjects.  The median survival was 25.9 months, and long- lasting PR  + SD was seen in 47% of the subjects .  
Express ion of IDO was detected in 9 of 10 tumor biopsy specimens by IHC (Iversen  et al 2014).

1.1.8. Pancreatic Cancer  
Cancer of the exocrine pancreas is a highly lethal malignancy.  Pancreatic cancer is the 13th 
most common form of cancer worldwide, with 279,000 people diagnosed in 2008 ( Ferlay  2008).  
Most die from the disease because it commonly presents in an advanced state.  
Chemotherapy represents the cornerstone of initial therapy for patients with advanced disease.  
Until recently, single -agent gemcitabine or gemcitabine in combination with erlotinib was 
considered the standard of care for most patients in the first- line advanced disease setting 
(Burris  et al 1997, Moore et al 2007).  Two combination regimens have recently emerged as new 
standards of care based on Phase 3 studies in which the combinations were compared to 
gemcitabine monotherapy.  
Subjects treated with gemcitabine in combination with nab-pa clitaxel showed a statistically 
significant improvement in OS compared with subjects  receiving gemcitabine alone (median of 
8.5 months vs 6.7 months; HR 0.72, p = 0.000015).  Based on these results, the combination of 
gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel was ap proved by the FDA for the first- line treatment of 
metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and has emerged as a standard of care for the 
treatment of patients with advanced disease and good performance status ( NCCN  Guidelines ). 
The superiority of FOLFIRINOX (a regimen that combines leucovorin-modulated 5- FU with 
irinotecan and/or oxaliplatin) over gemcitabine monotherapy was initially suggested in a randomized Phase 2 study that showed FOLFIRINOX was associated with a high ORR 
(39% vs 11%) and manageable toxicity ( Ychou et al 2007).  The study was expanded to a 
Phase 3 study in which chemotherapy- naive subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer were 
randomly assigned to gemcitabine alone versus the FOLFIR INOX regimen ( Conroy et al 2011).  
The study was stopped when a preplanned interim analysis demonstrated that the primary endpoint of OS had been met (median 11.1 months vs 6.8 months; HR 0.57; p < 0.001).  These 
data establish FOLFIRINOX as another standard-of-care option in treatment-naive patients with 
advanced pancreatic cancer with a good performance status ( NCCN  Guidelines ). 
The future role of immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer is less clear than t he evidence shown in 
melanoma and NSCLC.  Experience in the clinical settin g with immunotherapies is limited.   A 
Phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy of ipilimumab in subjects with pancreatic cancer.  
Twenty -seven subjects were enrolled, and although no responses by RECIST v1.1 were seen, 
1 subject  did experience a delayed response and regression of the primary lesion and several 
hepatic metastases.  The subject  also had an improvement in tumor markers and performance 
status ( Royal  et al 2010).  P ancreatic cancers have been shown to express PD -L1, which may be 
contributing to immune suppression and evasion.  PD- L1 expression in pancreatic cancer has 
also been shown to be associated with decreased tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes  and poor 
prognosis ( McDermott  and Atkins 2013).  
As there are currently no approved standard of care for patients with pancreatic cancer who have PD despite first- line therapy, guidelines established by the NCCN  in the United States and the 
European Society of Medical Oncology encourage the participation of patients with recurrent or 
refractory advanced pancreatic cancer and satisfactory performance status in clinical studies 
(NCCN  Guidelines , Seufferlein  et al 2012).  Because of  the lack of effective therapies for this 
highly lethal malignancy, it is reasonable to provide an experimental therapy to patients who 
have failed approved first- line therapies in this setting.

1.1.9. Squa mous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck 
In the United States alone, approximately 55,070 people will develop head and neck cancer in 
the next year ( Cancer.net  2014).  Tobacco use and drinking alcohol greatly increase the risk of 
developing head and neck cancer.  In addition, infection with HPV is associated with the 
development of head and neck cancer, and the incidence of HPV- associated SCCHN is on the 
rise.  Many patients present with localized disease that may be treated with either surgery or 
radiation therapy with curative intent ( Vermorken  and Specenier 2010).  Unfortunately, most 
patients will develop local recurrent disease , and about 20% to 30% of these patients will be 
diagnosed with distant metastases.  Treatment for recurrent/metastatic disease is typically not 
considered curative and includes chemotherapy or targeted agents.  Single agents most 
commonly used as monotherapy in this setting (eg, methotrexate, cisplatin , and 5- FU) typically 
have a short duration of response of only approximately 3 to 5 months.  Combination 
chemotherapy may be selected in patients with selected characteristics such as a good 
performance status ( NCCN  Guidelines ).  Response rates of combination therapy are generally 
improved over monotherapy; however, clinical study data have not proven an OS benefit when 
compared to methotrexate, cisplatin , or 5 -FU monotherapy ( Vermorken  and Specenier 2010 ), 
and these combinations may cause a significant increase in toxicity . 
Cetuximab, an agent targeting EGFR, is widely used in the United States  and the EU in the 
setting of recurrent/metastatic disease .  In the U nited States  and EU, cetuximab is approved for 
use in recurrent locoregional or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in combination with platinum- based therapy with 5 -FU.  In the United S tates, cetuximab is also 
approved for patients whose  disease has  progressed after platinum -based therapy.  A study of 
442 first -line subjects  with SCCHN showed that the addition of cetuximab to platinum- based 
(cisplatin or carboplatin) therapy with 5-FU significantly improved OS from 7.4 months to 
10.1 months (HR = 0.80; p = 0.04).  Significant benefits were also seen in PFS and ORR; however, approximately 20% of subjects  in each arm discontinued due to AE s. 
PD-L1 has been shown to be expressed in the tumor microenvironment of SCCHN.  PD- L1 
staining by IHC is seen in both HPV-positive tumors and HPV-negative tu mors , although HPV 
positivity does appear to correlate with a higher probability of PD-L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment ( Lyford -Pike et al 2013).  In early clinical studies , a subject  with metastatic 
SCCHN was tr eated with the anti −PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MDPL3280A experienced a 
response by the second cycle of treatment ( Herbst  et al 2013).   More r ecent data studying the 
anti−PD-1 antibody MK-3475 in subjects  with PD-L1−positive SCCHN  has shown a best ORR  
of 19.6% using RECIST v1.1 ( Seiwert  et al 2014).  Additional studies of anti −PD-1 and 
anti−PD-L1 agents in the setting of metastatic SCCHN are ongoing.  
1.1.10. Triple -Negative Breast Cancer  
Triple -negative breast cancer accounts for approximately 20% of breast cancers diagnosed 
worldwide, or about 200, 000 cases each year ( Swain  2008).   A strong association has been found 
with African -American race, younger age, higher grade, premenopausal status, more advanced 
stage at diagnosis, and positive BRCA mutation status.  More than 75% of tumors displaying a positive BRCA mutation status are triple negative (Bayraktar  et al 2011).  Despite initial 
responses to chemotherapy, TNBC has a poor prognosis as defined by low 5-year survival and high recurrence rates after  adjuvant therapy. 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 33 of 166 
Protocol INCB 24360- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
Triple negative status is defined as tumors that lack expression of the ER and Pg R but express 
HER2  at normal levels .  The ASCO/CAP panel  guidelines for determining ER, PgR, and 
HER2  status were created to improve the accuracy of testing and are commonly us ed in clinical 
practice ( Hammond et  al 2010, Wolff et al 2013). 
Triple -negative breast cancer is described as "paradoxical " because of  the relatively high 
likelihood of response and pathologic CR but poorer overall outcomes.  The risk of distant 
recurrence in TNBC and death peaks approximately 3 years after diagnosis and declines rapi dly 
thereafter ( Liedtke et al  2008).   As compared with ER- positive breast cancers, TNBC has a 
higher rate of relapse and a higher risk for metastases to the lung  and brain  (Lin et al 2012).  
Unfortunate ly, since endocrine therapy and HER2 -directed therapies are ineffective, t he only 
approved option for m etastatic TNBC is chemotherapy , which is associated with a median 
survival of < 1 year. 
Recent studies suggest that PD- L1 is expressed in approximately 2 0% of patients with TNBC 
(Chawla et al 2014), and immunotherapy agents , including the anti- PD-1 antibody 
pembrolizumab, appear to be active in heavily pretreated patients with metastatic TNBC .  In a 
Phase 1b study, subjects with  PD-L1+ metastatic TNBC were treated with monotherapy 
pembrolizumab every 2 weeks.  Approximately 50% of subjects  on study had received ≥ 3 lines 
of therapy.  Of the 27 evaluable subjects , the ORR was 18.5%, median time to response was 
18 weeks, and the median duration of response had not been reached (range, 15- 40+ weeks) .  
Three of 5 responders at the time of analysis were on treatment for ≥ 11 months ( Buisseret  
et al 2015).  Additional  studies of both anti −PD-1 and anti −PD-L1 targeted agents are ongoing . 
1.1.11. Gastric and Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer 
In 2015, an estimated 24,590 and 16,980 patients  will be diagnosed with gastric and esophageal 
cancer , respectively , and approximately 26,310 men and women will eventually succumb to  their 
disease ( NCCN  2015).  The prognosis for both gastric and GE junction cancers remains 
overwhelmingly poor.  Five- year survival rate rates for patients with proximal gastric cancer are 
only 10% to 15%.  Locally advanced unresectable and metastatic gastroesophageal cancers are 
not curable, and typically care is managed through a multidisciplina ry approach including 
surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Cisplatin is o ne of the most active agents for locally advanced metastatic esophageal cancer , with 
single -agent response rates of approximately 20% or higher.  Single- agent activity has also been 
observed with irinotecan, docetaxel, paclitaxel, and etoposide; however, cisplatin in combination 
with fluorouracil is the most commonly used regimen, resulting in response rates of 
approximately 20% to 50%.  Other combination chemotherapy regimens including oxaliplatin, 
carboplatin, mitomycin, and gemcitabine have been evaluated in advanced or metastatic 
esophageal cancer in the clinical trial setting ; however, no consistent benefit was seen for any 
specific chemotherapy regimen  (NCCN  2015).  
Recently, targeted therapies have shown clinical activity in the locally advanced or metastatic setting.  Ramucirumab , a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor -2 antibody, as a single 
agent or in combination with paclitaxel, was  approve d by the FDA and the EU for the treatment 
of patients with advanced gastric or adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction for whom treatment in combination with paclitaxel is not appropriate  or for patients who have progressed 
after therapy with platin um- or fluropyrimidine- based chemotherapy.   In the REGARD trial, 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 34 of 166 
Protocol INCB 24360- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
355 subjects  were randomized to receive best supportive care plus ramucirumab or placebo.  
Median OS was 5.2 months in subjects  treated in the ramucirumab group compared to 
3.8 months for those in the placebo group (p = 0.047) ( Fuchs  et al 2014).  In a second study of 
ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel, the combination resulted in significantly higher 
OS, PFS, and ORR than paclitaxel alone.  The median OS for the combination was 9.63 months 
as compared to  7.63 months in the paclitaxel -alone arm (p = 0.0001) ( NCCN 2015). 
In the near future, molecular characterization of upper GI tumors is expected to lead to  additional 
treatment options for patients with advanced disease.  HER2 -neu testing is currently  
recommended if metastatic disease i s documented or suspected.  In the ToGA study, t he addition 
of trastuzumab to chemotherapy in patients with HER2 -neu overexpression or amplification 
resulted in a significant improvement in OS  (13.8 vs 11.1 months, p = 0.046) ( Bang  et al 2010).  
This study established trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy as a new standard of care 
for patients with HER2 -neu−positive or met astatic gastric and esophagogastric junction 
adenocarcinoma.  
Recent clinical studies suggest that PD -1 and PD-L1 inhibitors may also  have clinical activity in 
gastric and GE junction tumors.  In a Phase 1b study, subjects with metastatic adenocarcinoma of 
the stomach or GE  junction received the anti −PD-1 treatment pembrolizumab every 2 weeks .  
The ORR  was 22% (95% CI, 10-39) by central review and 33% by investigator review.  Median 
time to response was 8 weeks (range, 7-16 weeks ), median duration of response was 24 weeks 
(range , 8+ to 33+ weeks ), and t he 6-month PFS rate was 24% ( Muro  et al 2015 ).  Additional 
studies with immunotherapy agents are ongoing. 
1.1.12. Transitional Cell Ca rcinoma  of the Genitourinary Tract  
Urothelial carcinomas , also referred to as TCC s, are the most common histologic al subtype in the 
United States.  Transitional cell carcinoma  may develop anywhere transitional epithelium is 
present, from the renal pelvis to the ureter, bladder, and proximal two-thirds of the uret hra 
(NCCN  2015).   In the United States, approximately 75,000 new cases and 16,000 deaths occur 
each year due to bladder cancer ( Siegel  et al 2015).  Occupational  and environmental 
carcinogens as well as  tobacco use greatly increase risk of developing bladder cancer .  In 
addition, s everal studies have suggested a relationship between TCC and HPV infection.  
A recent meta-analysis found that approximately 17% of bladder cancers are HPV-positive 
(Li et al 2011).  The life expectancy for patients with metastatic urothelial cancer is poor , with a 
median OS of 12 to 18 months.  Treatment selection for advanced disease is dependent on a 
number of factors, including the presence of medical  comorbidities, cardiac disease, renal 
functional, performance status, and disease extent.  There is no standard second- line therapy for 
patients who have progressed on first -line therapy for metastatic disease.  First-line therapy  for a 
robust elderly pat ient often includes gemcitabine  plus cisplatin or dose- dense methotrexate, 
vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin .  Alternatively , carboplatin, taxane- based regimens , or 
single -agent chemotherapy may be considered as well  (NCCN  2015).  Second- line chemotherapy 
data are highly variable, and treatment choices in this setting largely depend on the patient 's 
first-line treatment.  
More recently clinical activity has been observed with PD-1 and PD- L1 tar geted agents.  In the 
Phase 2 stu dy IMvigor210, subjects  who progressed after  treatment with a platinum- based 
chemotherapy were administered the anti −PD-L1 agent atezolizumab.  The ORR  was 15% 
CONFIDENTIAL

(p = 0.0058) for all subjects on study, 18% (p = 0.0004) for subjects  with PD -L1 expression 
≥ 1%, and 27% (p = 0.0001) in subjects  with PD -L1 expression ≥ 5%.  Median duration of 
response at the time of analysis had not yet been reached ; however, 92% (43 of 47) of responses 
were ongoing at 24 weeks  (Rosenberg et al 2015) .  In a separate Phase 1b study, 33 subjects  with  
PD-L1+ urothe lial tract tumors  of mostly transitional cell histology were administered 
monotherapy pembrolizumab.  The ORR by central review was 24.1% , with 10.3% of subjects  
achieving CRs.  Duration of re sponse was 16 to 40+ weeks (median not reached), with 6 of the 
7 responders ongoing at the time of analysis.  The median PFS was 8.6 weeks and the median OS 
in all subjects  was 9.3 months (6-month OS rate, 58% ; Plimack  et al 201 4).  Several additional 
studies are ongoing to further evaluate the activity of PD-1 and PD-L1 agents in TCC of the GU 
tract. 
1.1.13. Preclinical and Clinical Study  Data  
Refer to the current Investigator' s Brochures for both durvalumab ( mIB) and epacadostat  (iIB) 
for additional preclinical and clinical study data.  
1.1.13.1. Summary of Epacadostat P harmacokinetics  in Humans  
As of 29 OCT 2015, a total of 253 subjects were enrolled and received at least 1 dose of 
epacadostat  in Incyte -sponsored studies, and 47 subjects were enrolled and received at least 
1 dose of epacadostat  in investigator-sponsored studies. 
In Study INCB 24360-101, the multiple-dose PK of epacadostat  was evaluated in subjects with 
refractory solid tumors at doses of 50 mg QD to 700 mg BID.  P harmacokinetic observations 
include the following and are summarized in Figure  1. 
• After oral dose administration in the fasted state, the peak plasma concentration of 
epacadostat was typically attained at 2 hours postdose.  E pacadostat was eliminated 
with a geometric mean terminal disposition half -life of 2.9 hours. 
• Systemic accumulation after BID administration increased the mean epacadostat C max 
and AUC 0-t by 16% and 33%, respectively, suggesting an "effective" half -life of 4 to 
6 hours. 
• Increases in epacadostat C max and AUC 0-t were less than proportional to dose.  The 
slightly lower than dose-proportional relationship was most likely because of the limited rate and/or extent of intestinal absorption for this compound at higher doses. 
• A high -fat meal delayed epacadostat median T
max by 4 hours but did not cause a 
clinically significant change in epacadostat plasma exposures.  Therefore, epacadostat 
may be administered without regard to food. 
• Moderate intersubject variability was observed for epacadostat plasma exposure at the steady state after administration in the fasted state.  
• The highest steady -state mean unbound 0- to 24-hour AUC (2.2 μM∙h) observed in 
this study (700 mg BID dose group) was well below the NOAEL unbound AUC
0-24h 
of 7.9 μM∙h observed in the 28-day GLP toxicology study.

Figure  1: Epacadostat Plasma Concentrations (Mean ± SE) in Cancer Patients 
Receiving Multiple Doses of Epacadostat in the Fasted State 
 
1.1.13.2. Summary of Epacadostat Pharmacodynamics in Humans  
Tryptophan and kynurenine levels were measured in plasma and in stimulated whole blood 
samples from Studies INCB 24360-101, INCB 24360-201, and INCB 24360-210 as pharmacodynamic measures of the inhibition of IDO1 activity by epacadostat.  Whole blood 
samples were stimulated ex vivo with LPS and interferon -γ in order to increase the levels of 
IDO1 expression before measurement of tryptophan to kynurenine levels 24 hours later.  In 
addition, systemic changes in plasma markers of inflammation and lym phocyte subsets were 
monitored. 
Pharmacodynamic observations include the following: 
• Epacadostat administration effectively inhibits IDO1 enzyme activity, which is 
upregulated in many cancers and correlated with poor prognosis. 
• Inhibition of IDO1 is dose-dependent, and at doses at or above 300 mg BID, epacadostat ef fectively achieves maximal inhibition of IDO1 activity at trough, as 
assessed using changes in kynurenine levels.  
• Epacadostat inhibits IDO1 in all subjects, irrespective of cancer type.  
• The elevated kynurenine levels at baseline that are observed in cancer  subjects are 
reduced at first measure after onset of treatment with epacadostat.  The elevated 
kynurenine levels are reduced back to the range noted in normal healthy individuals 
in most subjects.  
• The pharmacodynamic effects of epacadostat are consistent with the PK.  
• No significant changes in peripheral blood immune cell subsets or immune plasma 
proteins have been noted, suggesting that IDO1 inhibition does not elicit global changes in the peripheral immune system.

synergize with blockade of PD-1/PD -L1 in delaying tumor growth and increasing OS 
(Holmgaard  et al 2013).   Many recent clinical results suggest that a common rate -limiting step is 
the expression of PD-L1 as a distal immune modulator expressed in 20% to 50% of human 
cancer ( Hiraoka et al 2010 , Herbst  et al 2013), including but not limited to the ones selected for 
investigation in this study:  advanced or metastatic NSCLC, melanoma, pancreatic cancer  
(Phase 1 only), SCCHN , TNBC, gastric or  GE junction cancer, and TCC of the GU tract .  
Expression of IDO and PD-1/L1 have been found to be increased in NSCLC as the disease progresses, and expression of these markers in tumor cells has been associated with shorter 
subject survival ( Iversen  et al 2014).  Anti−PD-L1 and anti −PD-1 monotherapy response rates of 
approximately 20% have been reported in refractory NSCLC ( Garon  et al 2015 , Brahmer  
et al 2013) with a survival median of approximately  12 months.  In subjects with PD -L1 
expression in at least 50% of tumor cells, the reported response rate was 45.2% with a median 
PFS of 6.3 months.  At the time of analysis, OS had not yet been reached ( Garon  et al 2015 ). 
In APR 2018, the ECHO- 301/KEYNOTE -252 study, a P hase 3 trial evaluating the anti–PD -1 
antibody pembrolizumab in combination with epacadostat vs pembrolizumab with place bo as 
first lin e treatment in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, underwent a 
preplanned eDMC review.  This eDMC review concluded that the co-primary endpoint of 
improvement in progression- free survival was not met (HR  = 1.00; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.21) and that 
the co -primary endpoint of improvement in overall survival was also not expected to reach 
statistical significance (HR = 1.13; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.49).  Based on these results, and on the recommendation of the eDMC, the study was stopped.  The safety profile observed in the 
ECHO- 301/KEYNOTE -252 study was consistent with that observed in previously reported 
studies of epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab. 
1.3. Potential Risks and Benefits of the Treatment Regimen  
1.3.1. Risks From Epacadostat 
In 28-day toxicology studies, C max values have exceeded the 50% inhibitory concentration for the 
IDO1 enzyme in cells (7 nM) by up to 370-fold in the absence of any toxicity, so the risk of unintended pharmacological activity is expected to be low.  In the Phase 1 clinical study in 
subjects with refractory solid tumors (INCB  24360-101), epacadostat  was well tolerated with a 
single SAE of radiation pneumonitis (also considered a DLT)  in a subject with  mediastinal 
metastas is of endometrial cancer , 1 report of asymptomatic and re versible hypopituitarism 
despite continued dosing of epacadostat , and 1 event of Grade 3 fatigue determined by the 
investigator to be related to study drug and considered a DLT.  Preliminary data from study INCB  24360-201 (evaluating the combination of epa cadostat  and ipilimumab) suggest that 
epacadostat  doses ≤ 50 mg BID were well tolerated with ipilimumab .  In the 50 mg BID 
continuous cohort, 4 DLTs (Grade 3 diarrhea, Grade 3 ALT/AST elevation, Grade 3 colitis, and Grade 3 pneumonitis) in  18 subjects  were reported.  Immune- related AEs were reversible with 
appropriate management.  The initial evaluation of epacadostat  300 mg BID in combination with 
ipilimumab was terminated due to the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 ALT/AST elevation in 5 of 
7 subjects treated at this dose.  These AEs were reversible in all subjects upon discontinuation of 
study therapy and institution of corticosteroids based on an established protocol for the 
management of immune toxicities related to ipilimumab therapy.  Treatment -emergent AEs  were 
reported in 100% of subjects administered  25 mg BID, 50 mg BID, 50 mg intermittent, 75 mg 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 40 of 166 
Protocol INCB 24360- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
total daily dose, and 300 mg BID of epacadostat in combination with ipilimumab.  
Treatment -emergent AEs occurring in ≥ 20% of patients overall included fatigue (n = 29 [69%]), 
constipation and nausea (n = 13 [31%] each), decreased appetite and headache (n  = 11 [26%] 
each) , and vomiting (n = 10 [24%]) ( Gibney et al 2015). 
A potential concern of IDO1  inhibition is  an increase in ser otonin levels that could precipitate a 
cluster of AEs termed SS when administered alone or in combination with other serotonergic agents.  This rare syndrome has been associated with some MAOIs and combinations of 
serotonergic drugs ( Boyer  and Shannon 2005).  The clinical manifestations of SS range from 
barely perceptible to lethal; onset is rapid (within 12 hours of drug[s] administration).  Preclinical data suggest that SS is unlikely after treatment with either epacadostat alon e or with 
combination with MAOIs such as linezolid ( Zhang  et al 2016).  As of 27 FEB 2017, 2 subjects 
across the epacadostat program (958 subjects treated) have reported non-serious SS or symptoms of SS, and both were mild in their severity and resolved. 
1.3.2. Risks From Durvalumab 
Risks associated with durvalumab monotherapy and in combination are provided below.  
Additional safety information can be found in the durvalumab Investigator Brochure ( mIB). 
1.3.2.1. Possible  Risks Based on Mechanism of Action 
Durvalumab, an anti −PD-L1 antibody, binds with high affinity and specificity to PD-L1 and 
blocks its binding to PD-1 and CD80, thus promoting antitumor immunity and tumor cell killing.  
Potential risks based on the mecha nism of action of durvalumab and related molecules include 
immune -mediated reactions such as enterocolitis, pneumonitis, dermatitis, hepatotoxicity, 
endocrinopathy, and neuropathy. 
A hypothetical risk exists for agents that activate the immune system by de livering agonistic 
signals through activating receptors, such as CD28 ( Suntharalingam et al 2006 ).  Such agents 
have an increased potential to trigger systemic, nonspecific activation of T cells since they can 
exert their effects in the absence of any antigen -specific T -cell receptor signals.  In contrast, 
agents that act via antagonism of an inhibitory pathway modulate an existing antigen- specific 
T-cell receptor signal and have a limited potential to drive systemic, nonspecific activation of 
T cells.  This is exemplified clinically by molecules targeting CTLA -4 and PD-1, which are not 
associated with acute, severe adverse effects, such as cytokine storm ( Brahmer  et al 2010, 
Berger  et al 2008, Wolchok et al 2010).  Like these molecules, durvalumab antagonizes an 
inhibitory receptor (PD-L1).  As such, in the absence of an antigen- specific T -cell receptor 
signal, inhibition of function of PD- L1 is not anticipated to elicit any response.  This expectation 
is supported by published data showing no effect for anti −PD-L1 antibodies in the absence of a 
T-cell receptor stimulus ( Dong et al 200 2).  To assess directly the potential of durvalumab to 
induce a release of cytokines, cytokine release assays were conducted in human whole blood.  
Durvalumab did not induce release of any cytokine from any donor at any concentration tested.  
These results support that, consi stent with its mechanism of action as a PD -L1 antagonist, 
durvalumab is not expected to induce acute cytokine release in humans.  Nevertheless, the 
durvalumab first -time-in-human study design took into account the unlikely possibility of a 
cytokine release event by having a low starting dose, extensive monitoring, and cytokine 
sampling.  To further mitigate the risk to subjects, vital signs will be monitored every 15  minutes 
CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol INCB 24360- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
throughout the infusion, at the end of the infusion, and 30 and 60 minutes postinfusion.  In 
addition, subjects will be observed for 3 hours following the first infusion of durvalumab.  Thus, 
the target occupancy will be well controlled with ample opportunity for observation, cessation of 
treatment, or intervention, if necessary. 
1.3.2.2. Possibl e Risks Based on Clinical Data  
As of 12 JUL 2015, > 1800 subjects have been treated across the ongoing durvalumab 
(MEDI4736) studies, including sponsored studies and collaborative studies.  The majority of 
subjects have been treated with monotherapy durvalumab (n  = 1279); however, 440 subjects 
have received MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab or other anticancer agents, 
14 received other agents (1 gefitinib, 13 MEDI6383), and 150 subjects were blinded ( mIB). 
The safety profile of durvalumab as monotherapy and combined with other anticancer agents 
was consistent with the pharmacology of the target and other agents in the immune checkpoint inhibitor class.  No tumor types appeared to be associated with unique AEs.  Immune- related  
AEs, which are important risks of immune checkpoint inhibitors, have been observed with 
durvalumab and include colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis/hepatotoxicity, neuropathy/neuromuscular 
toxicity, endocrinopathy, dermatitis, and nephritis. 
1.3.2.2.1. Risks of Durvalumab Monotherapy  
Risks with durvalumab monotherapy include diarrhea, colitis, pneumonitis/ interstitial lung 
disease, endocrinopathies ( eg, hypo - and hyperthyroidism, T ype I DM, diabetes insipidus, 
hypophysitis, and adrenal insufficiency), hepatitis/hepatotoxicity/increases in transaminases, 
neurotoxicities, nephritis/increases in creatinine, pancreatitis, rash/pruritus/dermatitis,  
infusion- related reactions, anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity or allergic reactions, myocarditis , and 
immune complex disease.  
Further information on the identified and potential risks can be found in the current version of 
the durvalumab IB ( mIB). 
In monotherapy clinical studies, very commonly reported (≥ 10% of subjects) AEs of all grades 
are fatigue, nausea, de creased appetite, dyspnea, cough, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, back 
pain, pyrexia, abdominal pain, anemia, arthralgia, peripheral edema, headache, rash, and pruritus.  
Approximately 8% of subjects  experienced an AE that resulted in permanent discontinuation of 
durvalumab, and approximately 5% of subjects  experienced an SAE that was considered to be 
related to durvalumab by the study investigator. 
The majority of treatment- related AEs were manageable with dose delays, symptomatic 
treatment, and , in the case of events suspected to have an immune basis, the use of established 
treatment guidelines for immune -mediated toxicity (see Section  5.6.3).  
A detailed summary of durvalumab monotherapy AE data can be found in the current version of 
the durvalumab IB ( mIB). 
1.3.2.3. Possible Risks Based on Nonclinical Data  
Nonclinical studies have demonstrated that durvalumab partially suppressed the primary 
antibody response to a T- cell−dependent antigen (KLH).  Secondary antibody responses to this 
antigen were normal.  The relevance of this finding with respect to a human immune response is

1.4. Justification for Treatment Regimen  
The goal of the present study is to explore doses of epacadostat  that may synergize or otherwise 
augment the efficacy observed with the PD -L1 inhibitor durvalumab in subjects with advanced 
cancer.  The established regimen of durvalumab ( 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg once every 14 days) will 
be combined with doses of epacadostat  that provide partial and more complete IDO1 inhibition 
based on observations from the Phase 1 study (INCB 24360-101).  The initial dose selected for 
epacadostat  in combination with durvalumab is 25 mg BID with escalation to 300 mg BID.  This 
is based on the preliminary observation that the average kynurenine inhibition for epacadostat  
25 mg BID and 300 mg BID are 66% and > 94%, respectively, and the safety of these doses, as well as doses up to 700 mg BID in the Phase 1 monotherapy study and in combination with 
ipilimumab in INCB  24360-201.  Dose escalation of epacadostat  will evaluate 25  mg BID, 
50 mg BID, 75 mg BID, 100 mg BID, and 300 mg BID.  This dose ra nge will span a range of 
average inhibition of IDO1 from approximately 40% (at 25 mg BID dosing) to 60% (50 mg BID dosing) to 89% (100 mg BID dosing) and 94% (300 mg BID dosing), based on pharmacodynamic testing.  Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic observations from 
Studies INCB 24360-101 and INCB 24360-201 in cancer subjects  support these doses, which 
provide a differential pharmacologic effect.  
The 200 mg dose level of epacadostat  will not be explored in combination with durvalumab 
based on PK and pharma codynamic considerations.  The results from Study INCB 24360-101 
demonstrated that epacadostat displays mildly sublinear exposure-dose response, as shown in Figure  3 and Table 3.  It is likely that there would be significant overlap in exposure at 200 mg 
compared to both 100 mg and 300 mg dose steps.  Furthermore, inhibition of IDO1 is well described by an E
max model that  is fundamentally nonlinear, especially beyond the inhibition 
> 80%.  Any incremental increase in IDO1 inhibition begins to level off and would be insensitive 
to further increased epacadostat concentration.  Our pharmacodynamic model estimates  Iave 
increases from 83% to 89% with dose stepping from 100 mg to 300 mg BID, which justifies not 
exploring the 200 mg intermediate dose in combination with durvalumab.

In general, as single agents, epacadostat and durvalumab have been well tolerated in this study 
population that has significant comorbidities.  
It should be noted that the initial evaluation of epacadostat at  300 mg BID in combination with 
ipilimumab (Study INCB 24360-201) was terminated due to the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 
ALT/AST elevation in 5 of 7 subjects treated at this dose.  These AEs were reversible in all 
subjects upon discontinuation of study therapy and institution of corticosteroids based on an 
established protocol for the management of immune toxicities related to ipilimumab therapy.  The study was subsequently amended , and preliminary data suggest that doses of epacadostat up 
to 50 mg BID are  well tolerated with ipilimumab .  In the 25 mg cohort, 1 DLT of Grade 3 AST 
elevation was observed.  Four DLTs (Grade 3 diarrhea, Grade 3 colitis, Grade 3 pneumonitis, 
and Grade 3 ALT /AST  elevation) have been  observed in the 50 mg BID continuous dosing 
cohort among  18 evaluable subjects,  and 1 occurrence of Grade 3 colitis has been observed in the 
50 m g BID  intermittent dosing cohort (2 weeks on/1 week off) among  9 evaluable patients .  In 
the 75 mg total daily dose cohort (50 mg every morning and 25 mg every evening ), there was 
1 DLT of Grade 3 rash among 7 evaluable subjects.   The most common all- grade irAEs were 
rash ( 52.4%), pruritus (38.1%), diarrhea (33.3%), increased ALT  and AST ( 21.4% and 16.7% ), 
and hypothyroidism (11.9%).  irAEs ≥ Grade 3 occurring in >  1 subject  were AST elevation and 
colitis (n  = 4 [9.5%] each) and ALT elevation (n = 3 [7.1%]).  Other treatment -emergent AEs 
occurring in ≥ 20% of subjects  overall included fatigue (n = 29 [69%]); constipation and nausea 
(n = 13 [31%] each); decreased appetite and headache (n  = 11 [26%] each); and vomiting (n = 10 
[24%]; Gibney et al 2015).  Adverse events reported in this study were consistent with what has been reported previous ly in subjects treated  with ipilimumab monotherapy  (iIB).  Complete 
inhibition of the IDO1 target is not required for maximally effective activity in preclinical 
models.  As monotherapy, maximally effective doses in nonclinical models result in exposures 
that are comparable to doses of 25 to 50 mg BID in humans. 
1.5. Rationale for Endpoints  
1.5.1. Efficacy Endpoints 
The primary efficacy objective of this study is to evaluate activity of study treatment using ORR 
as per investigator assessed response using modified RECIST v1.1 (mRECIST v1.1).  Modified 
RECIST v1.1 will also be used by the local site to determine eligibility and make treatment 
decisions.  Imaging will be collected and held for possible future central imaging vendor assessment.  
Immunotherapeutic agent s such as durvalumab work to enhance antitumor immune responses 
and these response patterns may lead to a clinical benefit ( eg, CR, PR, SD) after an initial 
increase in tumor burden that may be classified as PD by standard RECIST criteria 
(Wolchok et  al 2009).  Standard RECIST criteria may not provide an adequate response 
assessment of immunotherapeutic agents such as durvalumab.  Therefore, RECIST v1.1 will be 
used with the following modification (and defined as mRECIST v1.1). 
Progressive disease should be confirmed a minimum of 4 weeks after the initial radiologic 
indication of PD.  If the confirmation scan shows a decrease in the tumor burden, study treatment 
may be continued or resumed.  If PD is confirmed the subject will be discontinued from study

treatment.  Clinically stable subjects have the option of continuing study treatment per the 
investigator's discretion while waiting for radiologic confirmation of progression. 
Clinically stable for this purpose is defined by t he following criteria:  
• Absence of signs and symptoms indicating disease progression. 
• No decline in ECOG performance status. 
• Absence of rapid progression of disease. 
• Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites ( eg, spinal cord 
compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention . 
Subjects who are deemed clinically unstable are not required to have repeat imaging for 
confirmation of PD .  Additional information regarding mRECIST v1.1 is provided in 
Section  7.4.

3. SUBJECT ELIGIBILITY  
3.1. Study Population  
Subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced  melanoma, NSCLC, pancreatic 
cancer  (Phase 1 on ly), SCCHN , TNBC, gastric or GE junction cancer, and TCC of the GU tract 
will be enrolled.  
3.2. Subject Inclusion Criteria  
The following criteria are required for inclusion in the study: 
1. Male or female subjects, age 18 years or older.  
2. Ability to comprehend and willingness to sign an ICF.  
3. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of melanoma, NSCLC, pancreatic 
cancer  (Phase 1 only) , SCCHN , TNBC, gastric or GE junction cancer, or TCC of the GU 
tract that is locally advanced (not amenable to curative therapy such as surgical resection) 
or metastatic . 
4. Must have failed at least 1 prior treatment regimen for locally advanced or metastatic 
disease or be intolerant to treatment or refuse standard treatment .  Investigational agents 
used in combination with standard therapies are allowed.  Adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or 
chemoradiation regimens given within 6 months of screening would be counted as having received 1 prior systemic regimen and would not require an additional systemic regimen 
for advanced or metastatic disease.  
5. For subjects with metastatic melanoma: 
a. Must have known V600E activating BRAF mutation status or consent to BRAF 
V600E mutation testing during screening.  Testing should be performed in a CLIA certified laboratory.  BRAF mutation status determined as  part of a panel of genetic 
tests performed in gene expression analysis will also satisfy the inclusion criterion for 
BRAF mutation testing.

4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
4.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase 1/2 open-label study of epacadostat  administered in combination with 
durvalumab in subjects with advanced  melanoma, NSCLC, pancreatic cancer  (Phase 1 only), 
SCCHN , TNBC, gastric or GE junction cancer, or TCC of the GU tract .  The dose- escalation 
part of the study (Phase 1) uses a 3 + 3 design to  identify the MTD or PAD of epacadostat  in 
combination with durvalumab.  P hase 2 will further explore the safety and efficacy of the MTD  
or PAD  of epacadostat  in combination with durvalumab determine d in Phase 1. 
The study will consist of 3 periods: 
Screening:   Up to 28 days. 
Treatment Period:   The treatment period will continue  every 14 days for up to 12 months as 
long as subjects are receiving benefit from treatment and have not met any criteria for study 
withdrawal as defined in Section 5.7.1.  Once subjects complete 12 months of study treatment or 
permanently discontinue study treatment for any other reason, the EOT visit should be 
conducted, and they should enter the follow-up period of the study. 
Follow- Up P eriod :  The safety follow -up visits will occur at 42 days (± 7 days)  and 90 days 
(± 7 days)  after the  EOT visit or the last dose of study treatment if the EOT visit is not 
completed . 
4.1.1. Phase 1 Dose Escalation 
Phase 1 is the dose-escalation phase, which will include up to 6 cohorts of subjects treated with 
epacadostat  at doses of 25 mg BID, 50 mg BID, 75 mg BID, 100 mg BID, and 300 mg BID in 
combination with durvalumab 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg given on Day 1 of each 14 -day cycle.   A 
minimum of 3 subjects will be enrolled and treated in each cohort, and all 3 subjects will be 
observed for a minimum of 42 days before the subseq uent cohort begins enrollment. 
Subjects must have received the cohort- specific dose of epacadostat  for at least 75% of the doses 
(63 doses) and have received at least 3 dos es of durvalumab during the 42- day DLT observat ion 
period, or have experienced a DLT to be evaluable for dose tolerability.  Additional subjects will 
be enrolled in a cohort to achieve the minimum of 3 evaluable subjects if dropouts or dose 
interruptions/reductions occur that result in a subject being nonevaluable for DLTs. 
The dose of epacadostat  will be escalated if 0 of the first 3 evaluable subjects enrolled experience 
a DLT.  If 1 of the first 3 evaluable subjects enrolled experience a DLT, the cohort will be 
expanded to include 3 additional evaluable subjects.  If 2 or more of either  3 or 6 subjects 
enrolled experience a DLT, the prior dose level will be considered the MTD.   If only 3 subjects 
were treated at this dose level, the dose will be confirmed as the MTD by evaluation of an additional 3 subjects before this dose is recommended for Phase 2 testing. 
The cohorts and dose levels are shown in Table 4.

a Intermediate dose levels may be explored based on emerging PK or pharmacodynamic  data.  
During the study, dose interruptions and/or dose decreases may be implemented based on 
toxicity as described in Section 5.6. 
For the definition of DLT, see Section 5.5.1. 
All subjects who received epacadostat  and durvalumab in the dose- escalation phase and remain 
on study treatment will be observed for at least 42 days from the first dose prior to enrolling 
subjects in  Phase 2 of the study. 
4.1.2. Phase 2  
Approximately 140 to 192 subjects with advanced  melanoma, NSCLC, SCCHN, TNBC, gastric 
or GE junction cancer , and TCC of the GU tract will be enrolled at the MTD or PAD of 
epacadostat  in combination with durvalumab.  More than 1 PAD may be evaluated in Phase 2.  
The approximate number of subjects needed for the melanoma, TNBC, and gastric and GE 
junction cancer cohorts will be determined using the Simon 2-stage design:  Stage 1 will be the 
initial number of subjects per tumor type, and the decision to proceed with Stage 2 will be 
determined by the response rate observed in Stage 1 (further number of subjects to be enrolled in 
each stage per tumor type is detailed in Table 5).  If more than 1 PAD is evaluated, the cohort 
may or may not be repeated for the specified tumor type as indicated in Table 5.  The sponsor 
may limit enrollment of a specific tumor type to Stage 1.

Under Amendment 6, enrollment of the NSCLC, SCCHN, and TCC of the GU tract cohorts will be completed as expansion cohorts at the 300 mg BID dose level.  The sample size for each 
cohort will be increased to account for the heterogeneity of PD-1 pathway– treated and PD -1 
pathway–naive subjects within the selected tumor types.  The approximate number of subjects 
per tumor type is listed in  Table 6, and the number of PD-1 pathway–treated subjects in each 
cohort will be limited to 10 in order to reduce the risk of any cohort having a significant imbalance between PD -1 pathway–treated and PD -1 pathway–n aive subjects, thereby preserving 
the predicted levels of baseline efficacy observed with PD -1 pathway monotherapy.  Subjects 
enrolled at the 100 mg BID dose level will be analyzed independently.

4.2. Study  Endpoints  
4.2.1. Primary Endpoints  
• Phase 1:  MTD or PAD.  The MTD is defined by the highest dose cohort where no 
more than 1 of 6 subjects experience a DLT,  or the highest Protocol-defined dose for 
each agent in the absence of exceeding the MTD.   Alternatively, the PAD is defined 
as a tolerated dose of epacadostat  (in combination with durvalumab) that produces 
substantial pharmacological target inhibition.   Safety and tolerability will be assessed 
by monitoring the frequency, duration, and severity of AEs, through physical 
examinations, by evaluating changes in vital signs and ECGs, and through clinical 
laboratory blood and urine sample evaluations. 
• Phase 2:  Objective response rate determined by radiographic disease assessments per mRECIST v1.1 described in Section s 1.5.1 and 7.4. 
4.2.2. Secondary Endpoints  
• Phase 1:  Objective res ponse rate determined by radiographic dis ease assessments per 
mRECIST v1.1. 
• Phase 2:  Safety and tolerability of the combination as assessed by monitoring the frequency, duration, and severity of AEs, through physical examinations, by evaluating changes in  vital signs and ECGs, and through clinical laboratory blood and 
urine sample evaluations . 
• Phases 1 and 2:  Durability of response determined by radiographic disease assessment defined as the time from earliest date of disease response until earliest 
date of disease progression  
• Phases 1 and 2:  PFS  determined from the date of randomization until disease 
progression or death. 
• Phases 1 and 2:  The endpoints for assessment of PK of durvalumab and epacadostat  
include individual durvalumab and epacadostat  concen trations and PK parameters. 
• Phases 1 and 2:  The  endpoints for assessment of immunogenicity of durvalumab 
include the number and percentage of subjects who develop detectable ADA s.

5. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS  
5.1. Treatment Groups  and Administration of Study Drug 
Subjects in Phase 1 will receive doses according to cohort enrollment.  Subjects in Phase 2 will 
receive the dose or doses selected by the sponsor upon review of Phase 1 data.  Study treatment 
should begin as close as possible to the date of enrollment. 
5.1.1. Epacadostat 
All BID doses of epacadostat  will be taken orally morning and evening, approximately 12 hours 
apart  without regard to food.  If the morning or evening dose is missed by more than 4 hours, 
that dose should be skipped and the next scheduled dose should be taken at the usual time.  If the 
subject vomits , an additional dose should not be taken.  Doses of epacadostat  will be 
self-administered except the days scheduled to be given at the study clinic ( see Section  7.6).  
Epacadostat  should be taken just prior to beginning the infusion of durvalumab  on days given in 
clinic.  Epacadostat  will be given daily in combination with durvalumab for up to 12 months.  
Intrasubject dose escalation of epacadostat  is not permitted.  
5.1.2. Durvalumab 
The dose of durvalumab will be calcula ted based on the subject's weight in kilograms.  
Durvalumab will be administered in the clinic as an IV infusion of 3 mg/kg or  10 mg/kg once 
every  14 days for up to 12 months.  Intrasubject dose escalation of durvalumab is not permitted  
except as defined in Section 5.6.1. 
5.1.2.1. Durvalumab Treatment Administration  
Durvalumab will be administered as an IV infusion over approximately 60 minutes 
(± 5 min utes).  The IV line will be flushed with a volume of normal saline equal to the priming 
volume of the infusion set used after the contents of the IV bag are fully administered (unless 
prohibited by institutional pract ice).  No incompatibilities have been observed between 
durvalumab and polypropylene, polyethylene, polyolefin copolymers, or polyvinylchloride. 
Since the compatibility of durvalumab with other IV medications and solutions, other than 
normal saline (0.9% [w/v] sodium chloride for injection), is not known, the durvalumab solution 
should not be infused through an IV line in which other solutions or medications are being administered.  The date, start time, interruption, and completion time of durvalumab 
administration must be recorded in the source documents. 
5.1.2.2. Monitoring of Durvalumab Administration  
Subjects will be monitored during and after infusion with assessment of vital signs at the 
beginning of the infusion (± 5 minutes), every 15 minutes (± 5 minutes) during the infusion of 
durvalumab, at the end of infusion (± 5 minutes), and at 30 minutes  (± 5 minutes) and 
60 minutes (± 5 minutes) postinfusion.  Subjects  will be monitored during a 3-hour 
(± 15 minutes) postinfusion period of observation after the first dose of durvalumab only.  For 
subsequent doses, the 3-hour observation period will not be required unless a subject experiences 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 59 of 166 
Protocol INCB 24360- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
an infusion-related reaction.  If the infusion takes longer than 60 minutes, then the vital signs 
assessments should follow the principles as described above. 
In the event of ≤ Grade 2 infusion-related reaction, the infusion rate of durvalumab may be 
decreased by 50% or interrupted until resolution of the event (up to 4 hours) and reinitiated at 50% of the initial rate until completion of the infusion.  In subjects experiencing ≤ Grade 2 
infusion-related reaction, subsequent infusions may be administered at 50% of the initial rate.  Acetaminophen and/or an antihistamine (eg, diphenhydramine) or equivalent medications per institutional standard may be administered at the discretion of the investigator.  If the 
infusion- related reaction is ≥ Grade 3 in severity, treatment with durvalumab will be 
discontinued.  As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible.  Appropriate drugs and medical equipment to t reat acute anaphylactic reactions must be 
immediately available, and study personnel must be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis.  
The study site must have immediate access to emergency resuscitation teams and equipment in addition to the ability to  admit subjects to an intensive care unit if necessary.  
5.2. Treatment Compliance  
Treatment compliance with all study -related medications should be emphasized to the subject by 
the site personnel, and appropriate steps should be taken to optimize compliance dur ing the 
study.  Subjects will bring all unopened, empty, and unused bottles of epacadostat  with them to 
each study visit.  Investigative site staff will perform a count of returned tablets to assess compliance, and this information will be entered into the CRF.  Bottles of study drug, including unopened, partially opened, or empty bottles cannot be destroyed or returned to the depot until a 
monitor reviews and verifies all tablet counts for compliance.  Compliance with durvalumab will 
also be documented in the medical record and monitored by the sponsor or its designee. 
5.3. Randomization and Blinding  
This is not a randomized or blinded study. 
5.4. Duration of Treatment and Subject Participation  
Each subject enrolled in the study will continue receiving combination st udy treatment in 
continuous 14-day cycles for up to 12 months as long as subjects are receiving clinical benefit 
and have not met any criteria for study withdrawal .  When  a subject discontinues all study 
treatment, the treatment period will end , the EOT vi sit should be conducted, and the subject will 
enter the safety follow-up period (s ee Section 6.4). 
Protocol Amendment 6 (28 JUN 2017) removed the option for subjects to receive epacadostat monotherapy once they completed 12 months of combination therapy with durvalumab.  
However, subjects already receiving epacadostat monotherapy prior to Amendment 6 were 
allowed to continue if they were receiving clinical benefit and their investigator felt it was in the best interest of the subject.  These subjects will be allowed to continue epacadostat monotherapy 
for up to an additional 12 months, and their maximum overall study treatment duration should 
not exceed 24 months.  Exceptions for these subjects to continue study treatment beyond 24 months will require medical monitor review and approval every 3 months. 
Study participation is expected to average about 6  months.

5.5. Rationale  for Dose Modification  
The purpose of the dose-escalation portion of the study (Phase 1) is to establish a suitable dose of 
epacadostat  in combination with durvalumab. 
A 42-day DLT window, along with regular internal reviews of safety events, will be used for the 
dose-escalation phase of the study.  While the rules for adjudicating DLTs in the context of dose escalation/cohort expansion are specified in Section 5.5.1, an AE not listed above, or an AE 
meeting the DLT criteria above but occurring outside of the DLT period, may be defined as a DLT after consultat ion between the sponsor and investigator, based on the emerging safety 
profile.  The final recommended dose for the dose-expansion phase will be based on the review 
of the safety and tolerability data, including cumulative toxicity from available cohorts. 
Independent of the determination of tolerability during Phase 1 of the study, subjects may require 
individual modification  or interruption of epacadostat  or durvalumab if necessitated by AEs, 
including irAEs.  Dose adjustments are summarized in Section  5.6. 
5.5.1. Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicities  
Dose -limiting toxicities will be evaluated during the dose -escalation phase.  The period for 
evaluating DLTs will be from the time of first administration of study treatme nt until the planned 
administration of the fourth dose of durvalumab, 42 days from receiving the first doses of 
epacadostat  and durvalumab.  Subjects who do not remain on the study up to this time for 
reasons other than DLT will be replaced with another subject at the same dose level.  Grading of 
DLTs will be ac cording to the NCI CTCAE v4.0.  A DLT will be defined as the occurrence of 
any treatment -related toxicity  described in Table 7  occurring up to and including S tudy Day 42 
(6-week observation period).  Only toxicities with a clear alternative explanation (eg, due to 
disease progression, comorbid conditions, concomitant medications) or transient (≤ 72 hours) 
abnormal laboratory values without associated clinically significant signs or symptoms based on investigator determination can be deemed non -DLT.   Grade 3 irAEs  (excluding ocular, 
pneumonitis, or colitis) that improve to ≤ Grade 1 by appropriate care or corticosteroid therapy 
within 14 days after the initiation of supportive care or corticosteroid therapy will not count as DLTs.   Subjects who may not have experienced a DLT but who experienced intolerable, lower 
grade persistent toxicity determined to be due to study drug or have experienced recurrent dose 
interruptions and/or reductions will be considered in the determination of the study drug doses to be used in Phase 2.

Hematologic Toxicities:  
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia  related to either drug  
• ≥ Grade 3  neutropenia lasting > 5 days related to either drug  
• Grade 4 anemia related to either drug  
• Febrile neutropenia (ANC < 1 .0 × 109/L and fever > 101°F/38. 3°C) related to either drug  
• Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic uremic syndrome, diss eminated intravascular coagulation,

• Any Grade 3 or 4 AST, ALT , or total bilirubin elevation  
• Any other drug-related/immune -relateda Grade 3 toxicity , EXCLUDING:  
− Grade 3 n ausea/vomiting controlled by medical intervention within 72 hours  
− Grade 3 immune -related AEa (other than ocular events, colitis , and pneumonitis) that improves to Gr ade ≤ 1 or 
baseline within 14 days  after the initiation of supportive care or corticosteroid therapy  
− Grade 3 endocrinopathy that is managed with or without systemic corticosteroid therapy and/or hormone 
replacement therapy and the subject is asymptomatic o r minimally or transiently symptomatic based on 
Investigator assessment  
− Grade 3 fatigue lasting ≤ 7 days from onset  
− Grade 3 rash in the absence of desquamation, with no mucosal involvement, that does not require systemic 
steroids, that does not interfere w ith activities of daily living and resolves to Grade 1 by the next dose of 
durvalumab  or 14 days, whichever is longer  
− Any grade vitiligo or alopecia  
• Grade 2 or higher e piscleritis, uveitis, or iritis  
• Grade 2 pneumonitis that does not resolve to ≤ Grade 1 w ithin 3 days of initiation of maximal supportive care  
General:  
• Greater than 2 -week delay in starting Cycle 4 because of  a treatment -related toxicity even if the toxicity does not 
meet DLT criteria defined above.  
• If subjects are unable to receive 75% of epacadostat  or 3 doses of durvalumab  during the DLT observation period 
because of drug -related toxicity, even if the toxicity does not meet DLT criteria defined above.  
• While the rules for adjudicating DLTs in the context of dose escalation are specified abov e, an AE not listed 
above may be defined as a DLT after a consultation with the sponsor and investigators, based on the emerging 
safety profile.  
a Immune -related AEs are defined as AEs of an immune nature (ie, inflammatory) in the absence of a clear alternative etiology.  
In the absence of a clinically significant abnormality, repeat laboratory testing will be conducted to confirm significant 
laboratory findings prior to designation as a DLT.  
5.5.2. Procedures for Cohort Review and Dose Escalation in Phase 1  
Telephone conferences will be scheduled by the sponsor with Phase 1 investigators in order to 
review cohort -specific data, overall safety data from prior cohorts (if applicable), and to agree on 
dose escalation.  For additional safety oversight, this group will review and adjudicate individual 
high-grade AEs as potentially dose- limiting and for guiding the study team on decisions 
regarding dose escalation and cohort expansion.  The same method will be employed for 
reviewing data in Phase 1 to determine the recommended dose for Phase 2.

5.5.2.1. Follow- Up for Dose -Limiting Toxicities  
Subjects whose treatment is discontinued due to a DLT must be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of the DLT event, whichev er comes first.  
5.6. Dose Adjustment  of Study Drug  
5.6.1. Planned Dose Increases  
Cohort dose escalation is described in Section 4.1.1. 
Intrasubject dose escalations of epacadostat  are not permitted.  
Intrasubject dose escalat ion of durvalumab to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks will be allowed only for 
subjects who were enrolled into the study at a dose of durvalumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 
provided that the following criteria are met:  
• The Protocol inclusion criteria are met . 
• The subject  has not experienced related or possibly related toxicity ≥ Grade 2. 
• The next dose level of epacadostat  25 mg BID and durvalumab 10 mg/kg has been 
determined to be safe based on DLT rules (eg, no DLTs during the DLT observation period). 
• The subject is willing to submit to the PK  sampling schedule and 
durvalumab infusion observation as in Cycle 1. 
• In the opinion of the investigator, the subject does not have any concurrent condition or circumstance that would complicate the dose escalation  or PK sampling, or pose 
increased risk to the subject . 
• The intrasubject dose escalation has been approved by the sponsor. 
Note that if a subject dose escalates and experiences toxicity, guidance for dose interruption is provided in Sections 5.6.2 and  5.6.3.  In cases of persistent toxicity, dose de- escalation may be 
considered if approved by the medical monitor. 
5.6.2. Criteria  and Procedures  for Interruption  or Dose Reduction  
In some circumstances, it may be necessary to temporarily interrupt treatment as a result of 
adverse experiences that may have an unclear relationship to study drug. 
Table 8 summarizes the dosing actions for epacadostat  and durvalumab that must be 
implemented with the indicated related AEs.  Additional information related to dose changes and 
AE management for irAEs can be found in Section 5.6.3. 
In general, treatment with both study drugs should be withheld for ≥ Grade 3 irAEs  or non-irAEs  
and may be withheld for ≥ Grade 2 irAEs.   Additional details for irAEs are provided in 
Section  5.6.3. 
If a criterion for dose reduction of epacadostat  is met, re fer to Table 9 to determine the 
appropriate dose for the subject.  There will be no dose reductions of durvalumab allowed for the 
management of toxicities of individual subjects (exception noted in Section 5.6.1).  Dos es of 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 63 of 166 
Protocol INCB 24360- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
durvalumab may be delayed  for toxicity management.  In general, study treatment should be 
discontinued for toxicities that do not resolve to Grade 1 or less within 4 weeks  of onset.  
Exceptions to this must be discussed with the medical monitor.  
Note:  There may be some circumstances where, due to toxicity  attributed to epacadostat , a 
subject may not tolerate the combination therapy but may benefit from monotherapy with 
durvalumab.  These cases must be discussed and approved by the medical monitor before the 
subject may receive durvalumab monotherapy on study. 
Any interruptions of > 4 weeks or for LFT abnormalities must be discussed with the medical 
monitor prior to resuming treatment.  
Except in cases of emergency, it is recomm ended that the investigator consult with the medical 
monitor (or other representative of the sponsor) before temporarily interrupting therapy for reasons other than Protocol-mandated medication hold.  Additionally, the investigator must 
notify the sponsor' s medical monitor and study project manager via email before  restarting study 
drug that was interrupted for > 4 weeks due to  an AE.

5.6.3. Criteria for Subjects Exhibiting Immune -Related Adverse Events  
This section is meant to apply to suspected ir AEs from epacadostat , durvalumab, or the 
combination.  Immune- related AEs may be predicted based on the nature of the durvalum ab or 
epacadostat  compounds, their mechanism of action, and reported experience with 
immunotherapies that have a similar mechanism of action.  Special attention should be paid to 
AEs that may be suggestive of potential irAEs.  An irAE can occur shortly aft er the first dose or 
several months after the last dose of treatment.  
If an irAE is suspected, efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, 
toxin , or other etiologic causes prior to labeling an AE  as an irAE.  Subjects who develop a 
≥ Grade 2 irAE should be discussed immediately with the medical monitor . 
Recommendations for management of specific immune-mediated AEs such as pneumonitis (see Section 5.6.3.1), enterocolitis ( see Section 5.6.3.2), hepatitis ( see Section 5.6.3.3), dermatitis 
(see Section  5.6.3.4), immune- mediated neuropathies (see Section 5.6.3.5), immune- mediated 
endocrinopathies ( see Section  5.6.3.6), immune -mediated nephritis or renal dysfunction 
(see Section  5.6.3.7), and ocular manifestations (see Section 5.6.3.8) are detailed in the sections 
below. 
General recommendations to managing irAEs not detailed elsewhere in this section are detailed 
in Section  5.6.3.12. 
5.6.3.1. Procedures and Guidelines for Pneumonitis  
Subjects with symptomatic pneumonitis should immediately stop receiving durvalumab and 
epacadostat  and have an evaluation.  Subjects should be monitored for signs and symptoms of 
pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease.  The evaluation may include  imaging  (high resolution 
CT scan) , bronchoscopy, and pulmonary function tests such as monitoring of oxygenation via 
pulse oximetry (resting and exertion) and laboratory  work -up to rule out other causes such as 
infection.  If the subject is determined to have study drug −associated pneumonitis, the suggested 
treatment plan is detailed in Table 10.

• If toxicity improves to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline , then 
the decision to reinitiate study treatment will be based on treating physician 's clinical 
judgment  and after 
completion of steroid taper . 
• If toxicity worsens , treat as 
Grade 3 or Grade 4. For Grade 2 ( mild to moderate new 
symptoms ): 
• Monitor symptoms daily and consider hospitalization . 
• Promptly start systemic steroids 
(eg, prednisone 1-2 mg/kg per day 
PO or IV equivalent) . 
• Reimaging as clinically indicated . 
• If no improveme nt within 3 -5 days, 
additional work -up should be 
considered , and prompt treatment 
with IV methylprednisolone 
2-4 mg/kg  per day should be started.  
• If still no improvement within 
3-5 days despite IV 
methylprednisone at 2 -4 mg/kg per 
day, promptly start immun osuppressive therapy such as 
tumor necrosis factor  inhibitors 
(eg, infliximab 5  mg/kg every 
2 weeks). 
Caution:  Important to rule out 
sepsis and refer to infliximab label for general guidance before using infliximab.  
• Once improving, gradually taper steroid s over ≥ 28 days  and consider 
prophylactic antibiotics, antifungal or anti -PCP treatment (refer to 
current NCCN  Guidelines  for

PCP = pneumocystis pneumonia.  
5.6.3.2. Procedures and Guidance for Enterocolitis  
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, 
abdominal pain, mucus or blood in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel perforation (such as sepsis,  peritoneal signs , and ileus).  In symptomatic subjects, rule out infectious etiologies and 
consider endoscopic evaluation for persistent or severe symptoms. 
Subjects should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology (eg, disease 
progressi on, other medications, infections including testing for clostridium difficile toxin, etc) .  
Steroids should be considered in the absence of clear alternative etiology, even for low grade 
events, in order to prevent potential progression to higher grade event.  Use analgesics carefully; they can mask symptoms of perforation and peritonitis.  The recommended approach for 
handling enterocolitis is detailed in Table 11.

5.6.3.5. Procedures for Immune -Mediated Neuropathies  
Subjects  should be evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology (eg, disease progression, 
infections, metabolic syndromes, or medications).  Monitor subjects for symptoms of motor or 
sensory neuropathy such as unilateral or bilateral weakness, sensory alterations, behavior 
changes, headache, nausea, vertigo, or paresthesia.  Consider appropriate diagnostic testing 
(eg, electr omyogram and nerve conduction investigations).  Perform symptomatic treatment with 
neurological consult as appropriate.  Recommendations for the management of immune -mediated neuropathies are shown in Table 14. 
For any grade immune-mediated peripheral neuromotor syndromes, such as Guillain- Barré 
syndrome and myasthenia gravis, the following precautions should be followed: 
• The prompt diagnosis of immune-mediated peripheral neuromotor syndromes is 
important, since certain subjects may unpredictably experience acute 
decompensations that can result in substantial morbidity or, in the worst case, death.  
Special care should be taken for certain sentinel symptoms that may predict a more 
severe outcome, such as prominent dysphagia, rapidly progressive weakness, and signs of respiratory insufficiency or autonomic instability. 
• Subjects should be evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology (eg, disease progression, infections, metabolic syndromes, and medications).  It should be noted 
that the diagnosis of immune-mediated peripheral neuromotor syndromes can be 
particularly challenging in patients with underlying cancer, due to the multiple potential confounding effects of cancer (and its treatments) throughout the neuraxis.  
Given the importance of prompt and accurate diagnosis, it is essential to have a low 
threshold to obtain a neurological consult. 
• Neurophysiologic diagnostic testing (eg, electromyogram, nerve conduction 
investigations, and "repetitive stimulation ," if myast henia is suspected) is routinely 
indicated upon suspicion of such conditions and may be best facilitated by means of a 
neurology consultation. 
• It is important to consider that the use of steroids as the primary treatment of 
Guillain -Barré syndrome is not typically considered effective.  Subjects requiring 
treatment should be started with IVIG, followed by plasmapheresis if not responsive to IVIG.

5.6.3.6. Procedures for Immune -Mediated Endocrinopathies  
Subjects should be monitor ed for clinical signs and symptoms of hypophysitis, adrenal 
insufficiency (including adrenal crisis), and hyper- or hypothyroidism.  Subjects may present 
with fatigue, headache, mental status changes, abdominal pain, unusual bowel habits, and 
hypotension, or nonspecific symptoms that  may resemble other causes such as brain metastasis 
or underlying disease.  Unless an alternate etiology has been identified, signs or symptoms of 
endocrinopathies should be considered immune- mediated.   Consult an endocrinologist. 
Monitor subjects' thyroid function tests and othe r relevant clinical chemistries at the start of 
treatment, every 6 cycles, and as clinically indicated based on symptoms.  In a limited number of 
subjects, hypophysitis was diagnosed by imaging studies through enlargement of the pituitary 
gland.  If a subject experiences an AE that is thought to be possibly of an autoimmune nature 
(eg, thyroiditis, pancreatitis, hypophysitis, diabetes insipidus), the investigator should send a 
blood sample for appropriate autoimmune antibody testing.

• A cardiology consultation should be 
obtained early, with prompt assessment of whether and when to complete a 
cardiac biopsy, including any other 
diagnostic procedures. 
• Initial work -up should include clinica l 
evaluation, BNP, cardiac enzymes, 
ECG, ECHO, monitoring of oxygenation via pulse oximetry (resting and exertion), and additional laboratory 
work -up as indicated.  Spiral CT or 
cardiac MRI can complement ECHO to 
assess wall motion abnormalities when 
needed.  
• Patients should be thoroughly evaluated 
to rule out any alternative etiology (eg, disease progression, other 
medications, or infections) . 
Grade 1  No dose modifications required 
unless clinical suspicion is high, in which case hold study treatment durin g diagnostic 
work -up for other etiologies.  If study treatment is 
held, resume after complete resolution to

2-4 days for clinical symptoms, BNP , 
cardiac enzymes, ECG , ECHO , pulse 
oximetry (resting and exertion), and  
laboratory work -up as clinically 
indicated.  
• Consider using steroids if clinical 
suspicion is high.

myositis/polymyositis (poly/myositis).  
Typically, muscle weakness/pain occurs in 
proximal muscles , including upper arms, 
thighs, shoulders, hips, neck, and back but 
rarely affects the extremities , including 
hands and fingers; also difficulty breathing 
and/or trouble swallowing can occur and progress rapidly.  Increased general feelings 
of tiredness and fatigue may occur, and there can be new -onset falling, difficulty getting 
up from a fall, and trouble climbin g stairs, 
standing up from a seated position, and/or reaching up.  
• Consider, as necessary, discussing with the medical monitor,  
• If poly/myositis is suspected, a neurology 
consultation should be obtained early, with 
prompt guidance on diagnostic procedures.  
− Myocarditis may co -occur with 
poly/myositis; refer to guidance under 
Section  5.6.3.10. 
− Given breathing complications, refer to guidance under Section  5.6.3.1 . 
− Given po ssibility of an existent (but 
previously unknown) autoimmune disorder, consider rheumatology 
consultation.  
• Initial work -up should include clinical 
evaluation, creatine kinase, aldolase, LDH, BUN/creatinine, erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C -reactive prot ein level , urine 
myoglobin, and additional laboratory 
work -up as indicated, including a number of 
possible rh eumatological/antibody tests

Table 20 provides information on the diagnosis and treatment of potential irAEs.  
Table 20: General Guidance for Diagnosis and Treatment of Immune -Related Adverse 
Events (Not Described i n Previous Sections ) 
Subject evaluation to identify any alternative etiology  
In the absence of a clear alternative etiology, all events of inflammatory nature should be considered to be 
immune -related  
Symptomatic and topical therapy should be considered for low -grade events  
Systemic corticosteroids should be considered for a persistent low -grade event or for a severe event  
More potent immunosuppressives should be considered for events not responding to systemic steroids  
In general, both study drugs should be permanently discontinued for clinically significant or 
severe irAEs or for events where the steroid course cannot be tapered below 10 mg /day 
prednisone equivalent to manage symptoms.  Following an irAE where treatment was withheld, 
study treatment may resume when the following conditions are met:  steroid taper  has reached 
≤ 10 mg /day prednisone or equivalent, symptoms have improved to ≤ Grade 1 within 4 weeks of

Study Treatment  
Grade 1  No action . Not applicable . 
Grade 2  Withhold epacadostat  and durvalumab .  If 
toxicity worsens, treat as Grade 3  or Grade 4.  
Subjects  with endocrinopathies who may 
require prolonged or continued steroid 
replacement can be re- treated with study 
treatment on the following conditions:  1) the 
event stabilizes and is controlled, 2) the subject  
is clinically stable as per investigat or or 
treating physician’s clinical judgement, and 3) doses of prednisone are at ≥ 10 mg/day or 
equivalent.  
Consider whether study drug/study regimen should be permanently discontinued in Grade 2 events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or mortality (eg, myocarditis, or other 
similar events even if they are not currently 
noted in the guidelines ) when they do not 
rapidly improve to < Grade 1 upon treatment 
with systemic steroids and following full taper . Resume study treatment at same dose/schedule 
when AE resolves to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline.  
Grade 3  Discontinue  epacadostat  and durva lumab  
(exceptions to this approach allowing study 
treatment to continue after resolution of the AE may be granted only with medical monitor approval) . Not applicable (unless approved by the medical 
monitor) . 
Grade 4  Discontinue epacadostat  and durvalumab . 
Note: There are some exceptions to permanent 
discontinuation of study drug for Grade 4 
events (ie, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, 
Type 1 DM). Not applicable  (unless approved by the medical 
monitor).  
5.6.4. Procedures for Subjects Exhibiting Serotonin Syndrome  
As noted in Section 1.3.1, there is a rare chance that epacadostat  could cause an increase in 
serotonin levels in the brain that might trigger SS ( Boyer  and Shannon 2005) when administ ered 
in combination with other serotonergic agents.  This syndrome has been most closely associated 
with use of MAOIs, meperidine, linezolid, or methylene blue; all of these agents are prohibited during the study ( see Section  5.10.2).  Selective s erotonin reuptake inhibitors and SNRIs are 
permitted during the study.  Serotonin syndrome usually manifests with autonomic changes, 
mental status changes, and neurological findings.  These mild, moderate, and severe sign s and 
symptoms of SS (summarized in  Table 22) should be evaluated in the context of possible 
comorbid conditions as well. 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 89 of 166 
Protocol INCB 24360- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
The following procedures will be implemented if subjects exhibit the signs/symptoms of SS 
described in  Table 22, including tremor, hyperreflexia, and spontaneous ocular or inducible 
clonus together with agitation, fever, diaphoresis, or muscle rigidity:  
• Immediately interrupt study treatment administration . 
• Immediately interrupt any SSRI or SNRI administration . 
• Provide appropriate medical management of the subject until all signs/symptoms are 
resolved ( eg, IV fluids and/or sympathomimetic amines for hypotension, 
benzodiazepines for agitation, administration of 5 -hydroxytryptamine antagonists 
such as cyproheptadine). 
• If etiologies other than SS  are excluded, durvalumab administration may be resumed 
once all signs and symptoms have resolved unless other AE management guidelines 
apply for the specific event  (eg, immune -mediated neurotoxicities) . 
• If the subject chooses to remain in the study, restart dosing with epacadostat  after the 
SSRI or SNRI has been discontinued, no sooner than 5 half- lives have elapsed for the 
specific SSRI or SNRI in question, and after res olution of signs/symptoms of SS.  
The SSRI or SNRI dosing MAY NOT be restarted. 
• If the subject chooses to discontinue the study, or must restart treatment with SSRI or 
SNRI, subject should be scheduled for a follow- up visit.  SSRI or SNRI treatment 
may be initiated 2 weeks after resolution of signs and symptoms of SS. 
• If a subject has experienced moderate or severe unconfounded SS in the opinion of 
the investigator, without concomitant SSRI or SNRI usage or serotonergic 
concomitant medications, epacadostat treatment should be permanently discontinued.  
Durvalumab administration may be resumed with medical monitor approval once all signs and symptoms have resolved.

5.7. Withdrawal of Subjects F rom Study  Treatment 
5.7.1. Withdrawal Criteria  
Subjects must  be withdrawn from study treatment for the following reasons: 
• The subject completes 12 months of study treatment with epacadostat and 
durvalumab , or had completed 12 months of combination treatment (prior to 
Amendment 6 [28 JUN 2017]), and has taken epacadostat monotherapy for an 
additional 12 months (for a total of 24 months of study treatment). 
− Note:   A subject may be granted an exception by the medical monitor to continue 
on epacadostat monotherapy beyond 24 months of overall treatment duration if 
they are clinically stable or clinically improved.   Approvals to remain on 
epacadostat monotherapy will require continuing review every 3 months. 
• In the investigator's medical judgment, further participation would be injurious to the 
subject's health or well -being.  
• The subject becomes pregnant. 
• Consent is withdrawn by subject or legal representative (such as legal guardian).  
• The subject has experienced an unacceptable toxicity as described in Section 5.6 or a 
toxicity that does not recover in 4 weeks.  Investigators who wish to continue 
treatment after a treatment delay of 4 weeks should consult with the sponsor 's medical 
monitor for approval. 
• Confirmed radiographic progression of disease per modified RECIST v1.1.  See S ection 7.4 for details  on subjects with unconfirmed radiographic progression.  
An exception to continue on treatment with confirmed radiographic progression may be granted to clinically stable subjects.  See Section  7.4 for additional details.  
• The study is t erminated  by the sponsor. 
• The study is t erminated  by the lo cal health authority or IRB or IEC. 
• ≥ Grade 3 infusion reaction. 
• Initiation of alternative anticancer therapy including another investigational agent. 
A subject  may be withdrawn from the study treatment  as follows:  
• If subject attains a CR  (see Section  7.4.3), and the decision is made to discontinue 
durvalumab. 
• If, during the course of the study, a subject is found not to have met eligibility 
criteria, the medical monitor, in collaboration with the i nvestigator, will determine 
whether the subject should be withdrawn from study treatment.  See Section  11.3, 
Protocol Adherence.  
• If a subject is noncompliant with study procedures or study drug administration in the opinion of the investigator, the sponsor should be consulted for instruction on 
handling the subject.

Protocol INCB 24360- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
5.7.2. Withdrawal Procedures  
Discontinuation of study treatment does not constitute study withdrawal or completion .  The 
subject will proceed to the safety follow-up period when both study drugs are permanent ly 
discontinued.  In the event that any subject discontinues study drug and subsequently withdraws 
from the study before completion, regardless of reason, reasonable efforts should be made to have the subject return for the EOT  procedures to be completed a s described in Section  6.3. 
If the subject discontinues study treatment and actively withdraws consent for collection of safety follow-up data, then no additional data collection should occur; however, subjects w ill 
have the option of withdrawing consent for study treatment but continuing in the follow-up 
period of the study for safety assessment s.  The date the subject was withdrawn from the study 
and the specific reason for withdrawal will be recorded in the CRF . 
If a subject is withdrawn from study  treatment : 
• The study monitor or sponsor must be notified. 
• The reason(s) for withdrawal must be documented in the subject' s medical record and 
in the CRF.  
• The EOT  visit should be performed. 
• Subjects must be followed for safety until the time of the safety follow-up visits or 
until study drug– related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed 
irreversible, whichever is longer.  
5.8. Study Completion  
5.8.1. Study Completion Criteria  
Subjects will be considered completing the study if they met any of the following criteria:  
• Subject dies and a date of death is available. 
• Subject is known to have died; however, the date of death cannot be obtained (NOTE:   Every effort must be made to obtain the date of death). 
• Subject completes  the 90-day safety follow-up period. 
• Consent is withdrawn for any further contact related to this study. 
− Subjects may choose to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty of 
jeopardizing their health care or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise 
entitled.  Every reasonable effort should be made to determine the reason a subject withdraws prematurely, and this information should be recorded in the 
CRF.  
• The study is terminated by the sponsor. 
• The study is terminated by the local health a uthority or IRB or IEC .

Protocol INCB 24360- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
5.9. Beginning and End of the Study 
The study begins when the first subject signs the informed consent.  The end of the study may be 
designated as the timepoint when all subjects have discontinued the study drug and have 
completed applic able safety follow- up assessments.  
If there are ≤ 5 subjects on study for more than 6 months, a database lock of the study may occur 
to allow the analysis of the study data.  Any remaining subjects may continue to receive study treatment and be seen by the investigator per Protocol.  The remaining subjects are considered to 
be on study until a study completion criterion is met and /or written notification is provided to the 
sponsor. 
In addition, the investigator will be expected to monitor for and report any SAEs , as detailed in 
Section  8.3 (Serious Adverse Events).  The subject is considered on study until such time that he 
or she meets any of the discontinuation criteria and written notification is given to the sponsor. 
5.10. Concomitant Medications and Measures  
All concomitant medications and treatments must be recorded in the CRF.  Any prior medication 
received up to 28 days prior to enrollment will be recorded in the CRF.  Concomitant 
treatments/procedures that are required to manage a subject's medical condition during the study will also be recorded in the CRF.   Concomitant medications administered as treatment 
prophylaxis (eg, for the management of infusion reactions) should also be recorded in the CRF. 
5.10.1. Restricted Medications  and Measures  
• Systemic steroids may be used at doses ≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent with 
medical monitor approval. 
• Use of coumarin-based anticoagulants ( eg, warfarin) is discouraged.  Low-dose 
warfarin (1 mg) is acceptable; however, doses t hat increase the INR are discouraged  
and will require a dose modification.  If an alternative to coumarin -based 
anticoagulants cannot be used, investigators should follow the guidelines in Table 23 
and either closel y monitor or closely monitor and reduce the subject's dose of 
coumarin -based anticoagulant upon initiating therapy with epacadostat . 
Table 23: Warfarin Dose Modification 
Stable Baseline INR  Epacadostat  Dose  
≤ 100 mg BID  200 mg BID  300 mg BID  
INR  ≤ 2.5  Close INR monitoring  Close INR monitoring  Reduce warfarin by ~33% 
and monitor INR  
INR  > 2.5  Close INR monitoring  Reduce warfarin by 
20%- 25% Reduce warfarin by ~33% 
and monitor INR  
• Use of the anticonvulsant carbamazepine (a UGT1A9 inducer) is discouraged.  Because there is a potential interaction that could result in lower epacadostat 
exposures, an alternative to carbamazepine should be used if possible.

5.10.2. Prohibited Medications  and Measures  
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapies during the screening and treatment 
periods of this study unless otherwise noted below: 
• Any investigational medicat ion other than the study drugs. 
• Use of any anticancer medications including chemotherapy or biolog ic therapy other 
than the study medications. 
• Use of any immunological-based treatment for any reason is prohibited.  
(NOTE:   Inhaled or topical steroids are allowed, and systemic steroids at doses 
≥ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent and immune suppressant s are allowed with 
medical monitor approval for treatment of immune -related  toxicities .)  Temporary 
courses of corticosteroids for treatment of underlying or concurrent illness may be 
permitted upon discussion with the medical monitor. 
• Radiation therapy . 
− Note:  Local treatment of isolated lesions for palliative intent is acceptable 
(eg, by local surgery or radiotherapy). 
• Use of any MAOI or drug associated with significant MAO inhibitory activity is 
prohibited from 21 days before  Day 1 through 2 weeks after the final dose of 
epacadostat  has been taken (see Appendix C ). 
• Use of any UGT1A9 inhibitor (see Appendix D ). 
− Note:  Administration  of epacadostat on the morning of a pr ocedure where 
propofol may be administered is permitted ; however, the evening dose after the 
procedure should be held, and subjects may resume regular dosing the following 
day. 
• Administration of live attenuated vaccines is prohibited from 30 days prior to the first 
dose of study treatment through 30 days after the final dose of durvalumab.  
Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following:  measles, 
mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette –Guérin , typhoid 
vaccine, and intranasal influenza vaccines.  
• Administration of  inactivated  vaccines (including the injectable influenza vaccine)  is 
prohibited during the DLT observation period (ie, 42 days after Cycle 1 Day 1). 
6. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
All study assessments will be performed as indicated  in the schedule of assessments 
(see Table 24)  and laboratory assessments ( see Table  25).  The required analytes for each 
laboratory test are shown in Table 26.  The order of assessments is suggested by the order of mention within the schedule of assessments.

h Optional and c an be obtained anytime for safety or with confirmed response or progression.   If a subject consents to an on -treatment biopsy, the sample must be collected at peak 
exposure after the morning epacadostat dose (approximately 2-3 hours after dosing) and a peripheral whole blood sample should be collected at the same time as the biopsy.  
Additionally, one of the subject’s target lesions may be used to collect this sample if it is the most accessible for biopsy  (see Section  7.6.3.2.1). 
i Imaging will be performed every 12 weeks scheduled from C1D1. 
j If a scan was obtained within 4 weeks before the date of discontinuation, then a scan at treatment discontinuation isn't mandatory.  In subjects who discontinue study therapy 
without confirmed disease progression, a radiologic evaluation should be repeated at the time of treatment discontinuation (i e, dat e of discontinuation ± 4 week window).

process 1 time  if the investigator believes there  has been a change in eligibility status 
(eg, followin g recovery from an infection). 
6.2. Treatment Period  
The treatment period with the combination therapy will continue every 14 days for up to 
12 months.  Once subjects complete 12 months of study treatment or permanently discontinue 
study treatment for any other reason , the EOT  visit should be conducted, an d they should enter 
the follow-up period of the study.  Subjects enrolled prior to Protocol Amendment 6 
(28 JUN 2017) who were on epacadostat monotherapy and allowed to continue taking it will be 
allowed to continue epacadostat monotherapy  for up to an additional 12 months.  The overall 
treatment duration for these subjects should not exceed 24 months.  Exceptions to continue on 
epacadostat monotherapy will require medical monitor review and approval every 3 months. 
6.3. End of Treatment  
If a decision is made that the subject will permanently discontinue study drug, the EOT visit 
should be conducted.  If the EOT visit coincides with a regular study visit, the EOT evaluations 
will supersede those of that scheduled visit, and the data should be entered in the EOT page in the CRF.  The EOT visit should be performed within 7 days of the last dose of either epacadostat 
or durvalumab (whichever comes later).  The subject should be encouraged to return for the 
safety follow-up visits. 
6.4. Follow -Up Period  
6.4.1. Safety Follow- Up 
The safety follow -up period is the interval between the EOT visit and the last scheduled safety 
follow-up visit, which should occur 90 days after the EOT visi t (or after the last dose of study 
drug if the EOT visit was not performed).  Safety follow -up visit 1 will be performed 42 days 
(± 7 days) after the EOT visit or the last dose of study treatment (if the EOT visit was not 
performed).  Safety follow-up visit 2 will be performed 90 days (± 7 days) after the EOT visit or 
last dose of study treatment (if the EOT visit was not performed) .  Adverse events and SAEs 
must be reported up until at least 90 days after the last dose of study treatment or until study 
drug-related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible, whichever is longer.  
Reasonable efforts should be made to have the subject return for the safety follow-up visits and 
report any AEs that may occur during this phase. 
If a subje ct initiates a new anticancer therapy within 90 days after the last dose of study 
treatment, reasonable efforts should be made to conduct the next scheduled safety follow-up 
(42-day or 90-day) visit before the first dose of the new therapy.  
6.5. Unscheduled Vis its 
Unscheduled study visits may occur at any time if medically warranted.  Any assessments 
performed at those visits should be recorded in the CRF. 
6.6. Early Termination  
Not applicable.

7. CONDUCT OF STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
7.1. Administration of Informed Consent Form  
Valid informed consent must be obtained from the study subject before conducting any 
study-specific procedures.  The granting of informed consent for study participation must be documented in writing using an ICF that contains all of the element s required by ICH E6, and 
describes the nature, scope, and pos sible consequences of the study  in a form understandable to 
the study subject.  Local and institutional guidelines for ICF content and administration must be followed; a copy of the signed ICF must be provided to the study subject.  Subjects of 
childbearing potential must agree to take appropriate measures to avoid pregnancy in order to 
participate in the study  (see Appendix A ). 
7.2. Demography and History 
7.2.1. Demographics and Medical History  
Demographic data and a complete medical and medication history will be collected at screening 
by the investigator or qualified designee and will  include date of birth, race, ethnicity, medical 
and surgical history, and concurrent illnesses assessed using the NCI CTCAE v4.0 ( NCI 2010).  
Documentation of disease history, including details of malignancy (date of diagnosis, primary 
tumor histology, prior systemic anticancer therapies, surgeries, radiation therapy, and stage of 
cancer ) will a lso be collected at screening.  
7.2.2. Prior  and Concomitant Medications 
Prior and ongoing medications will be reviewed to determine study eligibility.  All prior 
treatments for the subject 's advanced cancer will be recorded in  the CRF.  
The medication record will be maintained  after  enrollment as documentation of concomitant 
medications , including any changes to the dose or regimen.  Concomitant medications include 
any prescription, over- the-counter, or natural/herbal preparations taken or administered during 
the study period. 
7.3. Safety Assessments  
7.3.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be monitored from the time the subject  signs the ICF .  Subjects will be 
instructed to report all AEs during the study and will be assessed for the occur rence of AEs 
throughout the study.  In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects will be asked general, nonleading questions such as "How are you feeling? "  All AEs (serious and nonserious) must be 
recorded on the source documents and CRFs  regardless of the assumption of a causal 
relationship with the study drug .  The definition, reporting, and recording requirements for AEs 
are described in Section 8.

7.3.2. Comprehensive Physical  Examination 
Physical exam ination s must be performed by a medically qualified individual such as a licensed 
physician, Physician 's Assistant, or an advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner, as local law 
permits.  
The comprehensive physical examination will include the following organ or body s ystem 
assessments:   skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; thyroid; lungs; cardiovascular system ; 
abdomen (liver, spleen); extremities ; lymph nodes; and a brief neurological exam ination . 
7.3.3. Targeted Physical  Examination 
A targeted physical examination will be a symptom -directed evaluation.  The targeted physical 
examination will include assessment(s) of the body systems or organs indicated by subject 
symptoms, AEs, or other findings as determined by the investigator or designee. 
7.3.4. Vital Signs  
Vital sign measu rements (blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, body temperature) will be taken 
with the subject in the recumbent, semirecumbent, or sitting position after 5  minutes of rest for 
the baseline measurements .  Weight will be measured at each visit where vita l signs are assessed , 
and height will be measured at screening only.  
Vital sign measurements will also be performed at the following times in regard to infusion of 
durvalumab: 
• At the beginning of the infusion (at 0 minutes ± 5 minutes). 
• Every 15 minutes during the infusion (at 15, 30, and 45 minutes ; all ± 5 minutes) . 
• At the end of the infusion (at 60 minutes ± 5 minutes). 
• 30 and 60 minutes after  the infusion (ie, 90 and 120 minutes from the start of the 
infusion; ± 5 minutes). 
• Followed by a 3-hour period of observation (± 15 minutes) after the first infusion. 
7.3.5. Twelve- Lead Electrocardiograms  
All 12 -lead ECGs will be performed with the subject in a recumbent position after 5 minutes of 
rest for the baseline ECG .  Electrocardiograms  will be obtained as outlined in Table 27 (unless 
emerging PK data suggest alternate timing) .  Electrocardiograms  should be performed before the 
PK blood draw when collected at the same visit .

a At screening, in the event that a single QTc is > 480 msec , the subject may be enrolled if the average QTc for the 3  ECGs is 
< 480 msec.  For subjects with an intraventricular conduction delay (eg, right b undle branch block), JTc <  340 msec  is 
acceptable; however, subjects with a left bundle branch block would be excluded.  
b ECGs must be performed before  PK draws.  
c ECGs should be performed before  durvalumab and epacadostat administration.  
The 12- lead ECGs will be interpreted by the investigator at the site  and will be used for 
immediate subject management.  The decision to include or exclude a subject or withdraw a 
subject from the study based on an ECG flagged as " Abnormal, Clinically Significant " is the 
responsibility of the investigator, in consultation with the sponsor's m edical monitor, as 
appropriate. 
7.3.6. Laboratory Assessments 
A labora tory local to the study site may perform all clinical laboratory assessments for safety 
(including comprehensive chemistry, hematology assessments , and urinalysis).  A central 
laboratory will perform PK , immunogenicity,  assessments.  
7.3.6.1. Chemistry  
A comprehensive chemistry panel will be performed as indicated in  Table 25; required analytes 
for this panel are listed in  Table 26.  
7.3.6.1.1. Liver Chemistry Monitoring  
If analytes are found to be abnormal (Grade 1 or higher) , frequency of monitoring should be 
increased to twice weekly until they have resolved to baseline or corticosteroid treatment has 
begun, at which time monitoring will be performed according to institutional standards or 
approximately weekly, whichever is shorter.  Liver chemistry  monitoring for persistent 
low-grade abnormalities does not need to be monitored twice weekly  indefinitely.  Appropriate 
liver chemistry  monitoring intervals should be discussed with the medical monitor for these 
circumstances.  Required analytes  for liver chemistry monitoring are listed in Table 26. 
7.3.6.2. Hematology 
Hematology assessments will be performed as indicated in  Table 25.  R equired analytes for this 
panel are listed in Table 26. 
CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol INCB 24360- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
7.3.6.3. Coagulation Panel 
A coagulation panel including PT and INR will be measured at screening.  Subjects who are 
taking anticoagulant ther apy should be monitored per local institutional guidelines.   
See Section  5.10.1 for use of coumarin- based anticoagulant guidelines and warfarin dose 
modification.  
7.3.6.4. Endocrine Function Testing  
Endocrine function tes ting will be performed as indicated in  Table 25; required analytes for this 
panel are listed  in Table 26. 
7.3.6.5. Serology 
Serology will be performed at screening to rule out hepatit is infection; required analytes are 
shown in Table 26. 
7.3.6.6. Pregnancy Testing  
A serum pregnancy test will be required for all female subjects of childbearing potential during 
screening .  Subsequent pregnancy tests (either serum or urine) may be conducted as medically 
necessary or as required per local guidelines.  
7.3.6.7. Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will be analyzed as indicated in  Table 25; required analytes for this panel are listed in 
Table 26. 
7.3.7. Chest Radiograph 
A chest radiograph is required at screening.  Subsequent chest radiographs will be conducted 
only as clinically indicated.  
7.4. Efficacy Assessments  
7.4.1. Initial Tumor Imaging 
Initial tumor imaging must be performed within 28 days before the first dose of study treatment.  
The site study team must review prestudy images to confirm the subject has measurable disease per RECIST v1.1.  Images of the chest and abdomen are required for all subjects.  In addition, 
neck imaging is also required for subjects with SCCHN.  Imaging of the pelvis is only required 
for subjects with TCC of the GU tract but is strongly encouraged for all subjects.  Computed tomography or MRI scan of the brain will be performed at screening if there are signs or 
symptoms suggesting that the subject has disease involvement in the central nervous system. 
Scans performed as part of routine clinical management are acceptable for use as the screening 
scan if they are of diagnostic quality and performed within 28 days before the first dose of study 
treatment.  The preferred method of disease assessment is CT with contrast.  If CT with contrast 
is contraindicated, CT without contrast is preferred over MRI.  The same imaging technique 
should be used in a subject throughout the study. 
CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol INCB 24360- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
7.4.2. Tumor Imaging During the Study  
Tumor assessments will be based on RECIST v1.1 guidelines ( Eisenhauer et al 2009) with 
modifications for all subjects and will be performed every 12 weeks from  the first dose of study 
treatment  (see Table 24 ).  This assessment schedule also applies to those subjects who continue 
to receive study treatment beyond confirmed PD (s ee Section  7.4.3.3.4).  Scheduled disease 
assessments should always be calculated from the first dose of study treatment.  Imaging should 
not be delayed for delays in cycle starts.  For those subjects who discontinue study treatment as a 
result of confirmed  PD, disease evaluation will be performed at the EOT  visit if clinically 
appropriate (ie, in the absence of rapidly deteriorat ing clinical status).   Additional disease 
assessments may be performed as clinically indicated.  Images of the chest and abdomen are 
required for all subjects, and neck imaging is also required for subjects with SCCHN.  Imaging 
of the pelvis is only required for subjects with TCC of the GU tract but is strongly encouraged 
for all subjects.  
7.4.3. RECIST v 1.1 
Tumor lesions that  are located i n a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other 
locoregional therapy, should not be selected as target lesions.  Additionally, tumor lesions that  
will be biopsied should not be selected as target lesions.  
7.4.3.1. Tumor Assessments  
• Physical examination: 
− Lesions detected by physical examination will only be considered measurable if 
superficial, eg, skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes.  Documentation by color 
photography including ruler is recommended for estimating the size of skin lesions. 
• CT scan  with contrast of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (plus head and neck if 
applicable) : 
− CT scans should be performed with contiguous cuts in slice thickness of 5 mm or less.  Spiral CT should be performed using a 5-mm contiguous reconstruction 
algorithm.  
• MRI scans : 
− MRI of the abdomen and pelvis (plus head and neck if applicable) is acceptable 
for measurement of lesions provided that the same anatomical plane is used for 
serial assessments.  If possible, the same imaging device should be used for serial 
evaluat ions.  In case of MRI, measurements will be preferably performed in the 
axial (transverse) plane on contrast -enhanced T1 weighted images.  However, 
there are no specific sequence recommendations.

Protocol INCB 24360- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
7.4.3.2. Measurability of Tumor Lesions 
Tumor lesions will be categor ized as follows: 
• Measurable Lesions :  Must be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest 
diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: 
− 10 mm by CT scan (irrespective of scanner type) and MRI (no less than double 
the slice thickness and a minimum of 10 mm). 
− 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam ination  (when superficial).  
− Malignant lymph nodes are considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT s can (CT scan 
slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). 
• Nonmeasurable Lesions :  Nonmeasurable lesions are defined as all other lesions 
(or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis).  Lesions considered truly nonmeasurable include the following:  leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement 
of skin or lung, and abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by 
physical exam ination  that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques. 
• Target Lesions :  All lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of 
2 lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as 
target lesions.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend 
itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. 
• Nontarget Lesio ns:  It is possible to record multiple nontarget lesions involving the 
same organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, "multiple enlarged pelvic 
lymph nodes" or "multiple liver metastases "). 
7.4.3.3. Response Criteria  
7.4.3.3.1. Evaluation of Target Lesions 
• Complete Response :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or nontarget) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm (the sum may not be "0 " if there are target nodes).  
• Partial Response:   At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
• Progressive Disease:   At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum 
must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  The appearance 
of 1 or more new lesions is also considered progression.) 
• Stable Disease:   Neither s ufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study.  
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 106 of 166 
Protocol INCB 24360- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
7.4.3.3.2. Evaluation of Nontarget Lesions 
• Complete Response:   Disappearance of all nontarget lesions  
  All lymph nodes must be nonpathologica l in size (< 10 mm short 
axis).  
• Non−Complete Response/Non −Progressive Disease:   Persistence of 1 or more 
nontarget lesion(s)  
 
• Progressive Disease:   Unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions will be 
defined as the overall level of substantial worsening in nont arget disease such that, 
even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has 
increased su fficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  In the absence of 
measurable disease, change in nonmeasurable disease comparable in magnitude to the 
increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease.  Examples 
include an increase in a p leural effusion from " trace" to " large, " an increase in 
lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread.  
7.4.3.3.3. Appearance of New Lesions  
The appearance of new lesions is cons idered PD according to RECIST v1.1 guidelines.  
Considering the unique response kinetics that have been observed with immunotherapy, new lesions may not represent true disease progression.  In the absence of rapid clinical deterioration, 
subjects may continue to receive study treatment if investigators consider that subjects continue 
to benefit from treatment. 
7.4.3.3.4. Evaluation of Overall Response With Modifications 
Confirmation of PD should be assessed  by a repeat, consecutive assessment no less than 4 weeks 
from the date of first documentation.  Treatment with study treatment will continue betwee n the 
initial assessment of PD and confirmation for PD if they are considered clinically stable as 
defined by the following criteria:  
• Absence of signs and symptoms indicating disease progression. 
• No decline in ECOG performance status. 
• Absence of rapid progression of disease. 
• Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg, cord compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention.  
In addition, subjects may continue to receive study treatment beyond confirmed PD in the 
absence of clin ical deterioration and if investigators consider that subjects continue to receive 
benefit from treatment after consultation with the medical monitor.  For example, subjects who 
are clinically stable with no further tumor increase after the initial scan demonstrating PD may 
be allowed to continue study treatment.  In the absence of clinical deterioration, such modifications to the RECIST criteria may discourage the early discontinuation of study treatment 
and provide a more complete evaluation of its antitumor activity than would be seen with

7.6.1.2. Pharmacokinetic Assessment for Durvalumab 
Subjects will withhold morning dose of epacadostat on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1 before  
PK sample collection .  Pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained in Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the 
study at the visits indicated in Table 30.  After the predose PK sample is drawn, subjects will 
take epacadostat and then begin infusion of durvalumab.  The exact date and time of the PK blood draws will be recorded in the CRF along with the date and time of the last dose of study drug and last meal preceding the blood draw. 
Measurement of durvalumab concentrations in serum will be performed using validated 
immunoassays.  Only subjects who receive at least 1 dose of durvalumab and provide at least 
1 post- treatment sample will be evaluated.  Individual durvalumab will be tabulated by dose 
cohort along with descriptive statistics.  The f ollowing PK parameters after the first and 
steady -state dose will be estimated (as data allow):  C
max, Cmin, tmax, and AUC.  Accumulation to 
steady state will be assessed as the ratio of C max,ss:Cmax and C min,ss:Cmin.  All PK parameters will 
be estimated by noncompartmental analysis.  Descriptive statistics of noncompartmental PK 
parameters will be provided.

7.7.3. Distribution of  Subject Reminder Cards and Diaries  
Subjects will be provided with reminder cards at each vi sit.  The subject reminder cards will 
indicate the date/time of the next visit, and will also remind the subject when they should not take their morning dose of study drug and when they should arrive for the visit after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours or since midnight.  On Day 1 only, subjects will also be given SS 
information sheet for signs and symptoms of SS.  This information sheet also instructs subjects 
to seek immediate medical care if any of these symptoms are observed.  
8. SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING  
8.1. Adverse Events  
8.1.1. Definitions and Reporting  
For the purposes of this Protocol, an AE is defined as the appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing) undesirable sign(s), symptom(s), or medical condition(s) that occur after a subject  
provides informed consent.  Abnormal laboratory values or test results occurring after informed consent constitute AEs  only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically 
meaningful, require therapy (eg , hematologic abnormality that requires trans fusion), or require 
changes in the study drug(s).  
Adverse events  that begin or worsen after informed consent should be recorded on the Adverse 
Events page  of the CRF.  Conditions that were already present at the time of infor med consent 
should be recorded on the Medical History page of the CRF.  Adverse event monitoring should 
be continued for at least 90 days after the last dose of study treatment .  Adverse events (including 
laboratory abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a diagnosi s whenever 
possible rather than  by individual underlying signs and symptoms.  When a clear diagnosis 
cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate AE . 
Adverse events will be assessed according to the CTCAE version 4.0.  The CTCAE severity 
Grade 5 (death) will not be used in this study; rather, information about deaths will be collected as an outcome of the event.  The occurrence of AEs should be sought by nondirective 
questioning of the subject during the screening process after signing the ICF and at each visit 
during the study.  A dverse events may also  be detected when they are volunteered by the subject 
during the screening process or between visits, or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments.  As far as possible, each AE should be evaluated to determine: 
• The severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 to  4). 
• Reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study treatment:  unrelated (no) or 
related (yes).  
NOTE:  Since this is a combination study of epacados tat with durvalumab, the 
relationship to study drug can be assessed for epacadostat  alone, durvalumab alone, 
the combination of epacadostat  with durvalumab, or not related to either epacadostat  
or durvalumab. 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 113 of 166 
Protocol INCB 24360- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
• Start and end dates, unless unresolved at final exam ination . 
• Action taken with respect to study drug  (eg, none, dose adjusted, temporarily 
interrupted, permanently discontinued, unknown, not applicable). 
• Outcome ( eg, not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, recovering/resolving, 
recovered/resolv ed with sequelae, fatal, unknown). 
• Whether it is serious, as per SAE definition provided in Section  8.3.1. 
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special reporting 
requirements, see Section 8.3.2. 
All AEs should be treated appropriately.  If a concomitant medication or nondrug therapy is 
given, this action should be recorded on the AE and Prior/ Concomitant medications  pages of the 
CRF . 
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until it ha s resolved  or until it is judged to be 
permanent;  assessment should be made at  each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any 
changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to 
treat it, and the outcome. 
Disease progression should not be regarded or reported as an AE  itself , unless it is associated 
with a separate AE. 
8.2. Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
8.2.1. Definitions and Reporting  
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an AE  in their own right (are considered clinically 
meaningful, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy, or require changes 
in study drug ), should be recorded on the AE page of the CRF.  Whenever possible, a diagnosis 
rather than a symptom should be provided (eg, anemia instead of low hemoglobin).  Laboratory 
abnormalities that meet the criteria for AEs should be followed until they have returned to 
normal or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.  When an  abnormal laboratory 
test result corresponds to a sign or symptom of a previously reported AE, it is not necessary to 
separately record the lab oratory test result as an additional event.  
Laboratory abnormalities  that do not meet the definition of an AE  should not be reported as AEs .  
A Grade 3 or 4 (severe) AE, as per CTCAE , does not automatically indicate an SAE unless it 
meets the definition of serious, as defined in Section 8.3.1, and/or per the investigator' s 
discretion.  A dose interruption or adjustment for the lab oratory abnormality may be required 
(see Section 5.6) and should not contribute to the designation of a laboratory test  abnormality as 
an SAE . 
8.2.2. Potential D rug-Induced Liver Injury ( or Hy’s Law) 
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver -related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event (also known as Hy’s Law) .  All occurrences 
of potential DILIs, mee ting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 8.3.2 for 
reporting details).

Protocol INCB 24360- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as: 
1. AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times ULN  
AND 
2. Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without initial findings of cholestatis (elevated serum 
alkaline phosphatase), 
AND 
3. No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre- existing chronic or acute liver disease, or 
the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic. 
8.3. Serious Adverse Events  
8.3.1. Definitions  
A SAE is defined as an event that meets 1 of the following criteria : 
• Is fatal or life -threatening (ie, immediate risk of dying) . 
• Results in pe rsistent or significant disability  or incapacity . 
• Constitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect . 
• Is clinically meaningful  (ie, defined as an event that jeopardizes the subject or 
require s potential medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed 
above).  Considered meaningful by the investigator as an important medical event 
that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be 
considered a SAE  when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize 
the subject  or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless hospitalization is a result of : 
− Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication  not associated with any 
deterioration in condition.  Elective or preplanned treatment for a pre -existing 
condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the  ICF. 
− Treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission. 
− Social reasons and respite care, in the absence of any deterioration in the subject 's 
general conditi on. 
− Any SAEs that are expected due to the condition being treated, including if the 
SAE is a primary outcome measure, or where  there has been a clear agreement 
with regulators not to consider these as SAEs, provided the information is 
collected elsewhere.

8.3.2. Reporting  
To ensure subject safety, every SAE, regardless of suspected causality, occurring after the 
subject has signed  the ICF  and up to the last study visit, or up to 90 days after the last dose of 
study treatment, must be reported to the sponsor (or de signee ) within 24 hours of learning of its 
occurrence.  Any SAEs experienced after this period should be reported to the sponsor 
(or designee ) only if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study drug .  Recurrent 
episodes, complications, or progression of the initial SAE must be reported as the follow-up to 
the original episode within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow-up information.  An 
SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a 
previously reported one should be reported separately as a new event.   Previously planned 
(before providing informed consent) surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the 
underlying medical condition worsens over the course of the study. 
Informa tion about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report 
Form.   The investigator must assess and record the relationship of each SAE to each specific 
study drug (if there is more than 1), complete the SAE Report Form in English, and send the 
completed, signed form by fax within 24 hours to the sponsor or its designee .  The investig ator 
must assess if there is a r easonable possibility that the SAE is r elated to the study treatment:  
unrelated ( no) or related  (yes). 
Serious AEs related to unblinded comparator drugs or concomitant medications /drug delivery 
systems are reported directly to the manufacturers of those drugs/devices in accordance with the 
package insert.  
The telephone and facsimile  number of the sponsor's contact persons, s pecific to the study , are 
listed in the investigator folder provided to each site.  The original copy of the SAE Report Form and the fax confirmation sheet must be kept with the CRF  documentation at the study site.  
Follow-up information is sent to the same person to whom the original SAE Report Form was sent, using a new SAE Report Form stating that this is a follow -up to the previously reported 
SAE and giving the date of the original report.  Each recurrence, complication, or progression of 
the original ev ent should be reported as a follow-up to that event regardless of when it occurs.  
The follow-up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and 
how it was treated , and whether the subject continued or withdrew from study pa rticipation , or if 
study drug was interrupted or discontinued. 
If the SAE is not previously documented in the IBs for the study drug s (new occurrence) and is 
thought to be related to the sponsor' s study drug , a sponsor' s associate may urgently require 
further information from the investigator for reporting to health authorities . 
The sponsor or its designee may need to issue an IN to inform all investigators involved in any 
study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported.  Suspected Unexpected Serio us 
Adverse Reactions will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics 
committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC , or as per national regulatory requirements 
in participating countries.  
8.3.2.1. Hepatic Function Abnormalities ( Hepatotoxicity) 
As defined in Section 8.2.2, Hy's law cases must be reported as SAEs.  Additional information regarding hepatic function abnormalities is provided in Section  8.8.

8.4. Emergency Unblinding of Treatment Assignment  
Not applicable. 
8.5. Pregnanc y 
Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that study drug may 
have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication or method.  When a 
pregnancy has been confirmed, the following procedures should occur: 
• The i nvestigator must notify the sponsor or its designee immediately . 
• The s tudy drug must be discontinued immediately . 
• The subject must be withdrawn from the study. 
• The EOT  visit evaluations  must be performed. 
• The i nvestigator must complete and submit the Pregnancy Initial and Follow -Up 
Report forms to the sponsor or its designee.  
• A serum pregnancy test must be performed to confirm the urine pregnancy test result.  
(The serum  test should be performed at the investigative site to ensure the test will be 
performed promptly and the result available immediately for review.) 
If a negative serum test does not confirm the urine pregnancy test result, then: 
• The investigator will use h is or her expert judgment, based on an assessment of the 
potential benefit/risk to the subject, to determine if it is in the subject' s best interest to 
resume study drug and continue participation in the study. 
To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy in a  subject during maternal or paternal 
exposures to study drug  must be reported within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.   
Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safety 
evaluation.  Follow-up to each pregnancy should be conducted to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any 
birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications, by following 
until the first well- baby visit.  Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Study Preg nancy 
Form and reported by the investigator to the sponsor or its designee.  Pregnancy follow-up 
should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the pos sible 
relationship to the sponsor' s study drug of any pregnancy outcome and follow-up to the first 
well-baby visit.  Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported on the SAE 
Report Form and to the sponsor or its  designee. 
8.6. Warnings and Precautions  
No evidence available at the time of the approval of this study P rotocol indicated that special 
warnings or precautions were appropriate, other than those noted in the provided IBs.  Additional 
safety information collected between IB updates will be communicated in the form of INs.  Any 
important new safety information should be discussed with the subject during the study as needed.  If new, significant risks are identified, they will be added to the ICF.

8.7. Data Monitoring Committee  
There will be no formal external Data Monitoring Committee for this open -label study.  
Approximately weekly the sponsor will conduct telephone conferences with investigators in 
order to review cohort-specific data, overall safety data from prior cohorts (if applicable), and to 
agree on dose escalation, de-escalation, and cohort expansion decisions. 
8.8. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse events of special interest include irAEs that are seen with immunotherapy and any other observed autoimmune phenomenon.  Guidance for the assessment, diagnosis, and management 
of irAEs is provided in Section 5.6.3.  I mmune -related AEs will be monitored carefully at each 
cycle and during the safety follow-up period. 
Adverse events of special interest for durvalumab are events of scientific and medical interest 
specific to the further understanding of the durvalumab safety profile and require close 
monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to the sponsor.  Durvalumab AEs of special interest may be serious or nonserious.  The rapid reporting of these AEs of special 
interest  allows ongoing analysis of these events in order to characterize and understand them in 
association with the use of this investigational product.  Durvalumab, an anti −PD-L1 antibody, 
binds with high affinity and specificity to PD-L1 and blocks its binding to PD-1 and CD80, thus promoting antitumor immunity and tumor cell killing.  Potential risks based on this mechanism of action of durvalumab and related molecules include immun e-mediated reactions such as 
enterocolitis, dermatitis, hepatotoxicity or hepatitis, endocrinopathy, neuropathy, and 
pneumonitis.  The class including anti −PD-L1 drugs and other immune checkpoint antibodies 
such as anti −PD-1 or anti−CTLA -4, have a wide spe ctrum of immune -mediated reactions that 
have been considered inflammatory in nature and can affect any organs of the body. 
8.8.1. Pneumonitis  
Pneumonitis has been reported in association with use of anti −PD-L1/anti−PD-1 antibodies 
(Brahmer  et al 2012).  Initial work -up should include a high-resolution CT scan, ruling out 
infection, and pulse oximetry.  Pulmonary consultation is recommended.  Guidelines for the 
management of subjects with immune -mediated events including pneumonitis are outlined in 
Section 5.6.3.1. 
8.8.2. Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Hypersensitivity reactions as well as infusion -related reactions have been reported with 
anti−PD-L1 and anti −PD-1 therapy ( Brahmer et al 2012 ).  As with the administration of any 
foreign protein and/or other biologic agents, reactions following the infusion of monoclonal antibodies can be caused by various mechanisms, including acute anaphylactic (IgE- mediated) 
and anap hylactoid reactions against the monoclonal antibody, and serum sickness.  Acute 
allergic reactions may occur, may be severe, and may result in death.  Acute allergic reactions 
may include hypotension, dyspnea, cyanosis, respiratory failure, urticaria, pruritus , angioedema, 
hypotonia, urticaria, arthralgia, bronchospasm, wheeze, cough, dizziness, fatigue, headache, 
hypertension, myalgia, vomiting, and unresponsiveness. 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 118 of 166 
Protocol INCB 24360- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
Guidelines for management of subjects with hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic reaction) 
and infusion- related reactions are outlined in Section 5.1.2.2. 
8.8.3. Hepatic Function Abnormalities (Hepatotoxicity) 
Increased transaminases have been reported during treatment with anti −PD-L1 (Brahmer 
et al 2012).  Inflammatory hepatitis has been reported in 3% to 9% of subjects treated with 
anti−CTLA -4 monoclonal antibodies (eg, ipilimumab).  The clinical manifestations of 
ipilimumab -treated subjects included general weakness, fatigue, nausea and/or mild fever, and 
increased liver chemistry tests such as AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and/or total bilirubin.  
Hepatic function abnormality is defined as any increase in ALT or AST to > 3 × ULN and concurrent increase in bilirubin to > 2 × ULN (ie, Hy 's law cases).   Concurrent findings are those 
that derive from a single blood draw or from separate blood draws taken within 8 days of each 
other.  Follow- up investigations and inquiries will be initiated promptly by the investigational 
site to determine whether the findings are reproducible and/or whether there is objective 
evidence that clearly supports causation by a disease (eg, cholelithiasis and bile duct obstruction 
with distended gallbladder) or an agent other than the investigational product.  If the underlying 
diagnosis for the hepatic function abnormality is known (including progression of pre- existing 
disease such as primary or metastatic malignancy), the diagnosis should be recorded as an 
AE/SAE.  If the underlying diagnosis for the hepatic function abnormality remains unknown, the 
term "hepatic function abnormal " should be used to report the AE/SAE.  Hepatic function 
abnormality of unknown etiology, or which is considered attributable to investigational product, 
is required to be reported as "hepatic function abnormal " within 24 hours of knowledge of the 
event to the sponsor using the SAE Report Form, even if the event is considered to be 
nonserious. 
The investigator will review the data with the medical monitor.  The investigat or should then use 
clinical judgment to establish the cause based on local standard of care and follow the subject by 
conducting testing as clinically indicated.  
8.8.4. Serotonin Syndrome  
As noted in Section  1.3.1, ther e is a theoretical chance that epacadostat  could cause an increase 
in serotonin levels in the brain that might trigger SS ( Boyer  and Shannon 2005) when 
administered in combination with other serotonergic agents.  This syndrome has been most 
closely associated with use of MAOIs, meperidine, linezolid, or methylene blue; all of these 
agents are prohibited during the study.  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and SNRIs are permitted in the study.  Procedures listed in Section 5.6.4 will be implemented if subjects exhibit 
the signs/symptoms of SS , including tremor, hyperreflexia, and  spontaneous ocular or inducible 
clonus together with agitation, fever, diaphoresis, or muscle rigidity. 
8.9. Product Complaints  
The sponsor collects product complaints on study drugs and drug delivery systems used in clinical studies in order to ensure the safety of study participants, monitor quality, and facilitate 
process and product improvements. 
All product complaints associated with material packaged, labeled, and released by the sponsor 
or its designee will be reported.

The investigator or his/her designee is responsible for reporting a complete description of the 
product complaint and any associated AEs via email or other written communication to the 
Incyte contact.  
If the investigator is asked to return the product for investigation, he/she will return a copy of the product complaint communication with the product. 
9. STATISTICS  
9.1. Study Population s 
Safety Evalua ble:  All subjects enrolled who take at least 1 dose of study drug. 
Pharmacokinetic  Evaluable:   Includes subjects who received at least 
1 dose of study drug(s) and provided at least 1 postdose blood sample for PK  
 assessme n .  The study pharmacokineticist will review data listings of 
subject dosing and sample records to identify subjects to be excluded from the analysis. 
Phase 1 Population:   All subjects enrolled in the Phase 1 portion of the study taking at least 
1 dose of study drug.  
9.2. Selection of Sample Size  
9.2.1. Cohort Size in Phase 1  
The primary objective of the open- label Phase 1 portion of the study is to determine the MTD or 
PAD and DLT of epacadostat  in combination with durvalumab.  The total number of subjects 
will de pend on the number of dose levels tested before the MTD or PAD is established.  Up to 
36 subjects (6 subjects per dose level for 6 dose levels) will be included based on the dose 
escalation.  Dose escalation will follow the 3  + 3 design algorithm as defined in Section 4.1.1.  
Based on this algorithm, which enrolls 3 evaluable subjects in each cohort with a maximum of 
6 subjects at any dose level, the probabilities of dose de-escalation from a given dose level for 
the various DLT rates are provided in Table 32. 
Table 32: Probability of Dose De-Escalation for Various DLT Rates 
True DLT Rate  Probability of Dose De -Escalation  
20% 23.6%  
30% 47.2%  
40% 68.3%  
50% 83.4%  
60% 92.4%  
For example, if the true DLT rate is 50% at a given dose level, there is a 17% chance that the 
dose would be escalated.  Further, if the true DLT rate is 20%, there is a 76% chance that the 
dose would be escalated.

9.2.2. Sample Size for Phase 2  
The sample size for the melanoma, TNBC, and gastric and GE junction cohorts will be guided by 
the Simon 2- stage  design (Simon  1989).  Let P 0 denote a clinically uninteresting response rate 
(eg, for melanoma P 0 = 30%).  In order to determine whether a target response rate ( eg, 55%) is 
likely, an initial number of subjects ( eg, 15) will be treated at first in a cohort (Stage 1).  For 
example, i n a group in which ≤ 5 subjects have responses, it will be concluded that the true 
response rate is unlikely to be greater than or equal to the target rate and no more subjects will be 
enrolled in that group in Stage 2.  Otherwise, in the groups in which at least 6 responses among the Stage 1 subjects is observed, 25 additional subjects will be treated in Stage 2 to estimate the 
response rate.  At the end of Stage 2, if ≤ 16 subjects have responded among a total of 
40 subjects, the drug will be declared nonpromising.  In othe r words, after the study is finished, 
if there is a sufficient number of responses in the 2 stages combined, the study compound is 
considered promising; otherwise it is considered nonpromising.  The detail is displayed in 
Table 33 using a Type I error of 0.05 and power of 90% for estimation.

Under Amendment 6, enrollment of the NSCLC, SCCHN, and TCC of the GU tract cohorts will 
be completed as expansion cohorts at the 300 mg BID dose level.  The sample size for each 
cohort will be increased to account for the heterogeneity of PD -1 pathway– treated and PD -1 
pathway–naive subjects within the selected tumor types.  The approximate number of subjects 
per tumor type is listed in Table 34, and the number of PD-1 pathway–treated subjects in each  
cohort will be limited to 10 in order to reduce the risk of any cohort having a significant imbalance between PD -1 pathway–treated and PD -1 pathway–naive subjects, thereby preserving 
the predicted levels of baseline efficacy observed with PD -1 pathway mon otherapy .  Subjects 
enrolled at the 100 mg BID will be analyzed independently.  The sample size for each cohort expansion is  based on a power of 90% to detect a target ORR of about 20% increase with a 
1-sided alpha of 10% and 10% lost to follow-up.

9.3. Level of Significance  
No formal efficacy hypothes es will be tested.   All CIs will be 95%. 
9.4. Statistical Analyses  
9.4.1. Primary Analyses 
Phase 1:  The safety and tolerability of epacadostat  in combination with durvalumab will be 
evaluated.  See Section 9.4.3 for more de tails.  Descriptive statistics ( eg, mean, standard 
deviation, range) will be derived where appropriate.  Subject enrollment, disposition, 
demographics, and medical history will be summarized at baseline.  The rate of DLTs will be summarized for each cohort.  Dose exposure and density will be calculated for each cohort.  
Safety and disease response data will be compared over time to assess change from baseline, 
during treatment, and follow-up.  Pharmacokinetic  data will be analyzed 
with a ppropriate standard nonlinear analytic software.  
Phases 1 and 2:  The proportion of subjects with objective response by mRECIST v1.1 will be summarized.   A subject is considered an objective responder as assessed by mRECIST v1.1 if he 
or she has an overall  response of CR or PR at any postbaseline visit.  The proportion of 
responders within each treatment group will be estimated with 95% CI s by treatment group.  
Confidence intervals will be calculated based on the exact method for binomial distributions. 
9.4.2. Secondary Analyses 
For objective responders, the duration of response is the time from the first overall response 
contributing to an objective response, to the first overall response of PD (by m RECIST v1.1) 
occurring after the first overall response contribut ing to the objective response.  Median duration 
of response and time to disease progression will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Confidence intervals for median survival time will be calculated using the method of 
Brookmeyer and Crawley ( 1982 ), which is the default method within SAS v9.1. 
Progression- free survival  data will be analyzed by the Kaplan -Meier method, treating subjects 
with no observed death or progression censored at their last date known to be alive and 
progression- free. 
9.4.3. Safety  Analyses 
The principal analysis will be based on the safety evaluable population, according to treatment 
assignment.  
Adverse events will be coded by the MedDRA, and incidences will be tabulated by preferred 
term and system org an class for all events, related events, and events ≥ Grade 3.  Severity of AEs 
will be based on the CTCAE scale as indicated in Section 8.1.1.  Quantitative safety variables 
and their changes from baseline (labo ratory, vital signs) will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics.  Clinically significant abnormal values will be flagged and tabulated based on 
predefined criteria.  
Exposure will be analyzed by describing dose intensity, which is defined as the dose re ceived , 
divided by the dose planned, over a given time interval.  This will be done by cycle as well as overall cycles received for durvalumab + epacadostat  and durvalumab alone.  For each cycle, 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 122 of 166 
Protocol INCB 24360- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
incidences of dose reductions and cycle delays will also be tabulated by reason for the reduction 
or delay.  The percentage of subjects with any delay and/or reduction will also be calculated. 
9.4.4. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
The clinical laboratory data will be analyzed using summary statistic s (eg, means and 
frequencies ).  In addition, distributions of key laboratory parameters (including hemoglobin, 
neutrophils, and platelets) will be plotted over time; these values will also be classified into 
CTC AE toxicity grades and tabulated.  Descriptive statistics and mean change  from baseline will 
be determined for vital signs at each assessment time.  Vital sign results will be reviewed for 
clinically notable abnormalities.  
9.5. Data Monitoring Committee  
Not applicable.  
9.6. Interim Analysis  
An interim safety analysis is planned for Phase  2 after 16 subjects have been enrolled and treated 
for 8 weeks, and then approximately every 3 months thereafter.  If the following is reported 
during these reviews, enrollment of subjects would be suspended until the sponsor determined 
the appropriate co urse of action and notified IRBs and regulatory authorities: 
• ≥ 40% of subjects have experienced an AE ≥ Grade 3 that was attributable to the 
investigational agents. 
No formal interim analysis for futility or efficacy is planned for this study.

APPENDIX A. INFORMATION REGARDING EFFECTIVENESS OF 
CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS  
For Subjects Participating in the Study:  
The following methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used 
consistently and correctly are considered as highly effective birth control methods.  
Such methods include: 
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation1 
− oral 
− intravaginal 
− transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation1 
− oral 
− injectable  
− implantable2 
• Intrauterine device (IUD)2 
• Intrauter ine hormone- releasing system (IUS)2 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion2 
• Vasectomised partner2,3 
• Sexual abstinence4 
 
1  Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the IMP, which may reduce the efficacy of the 
contraception method. 
2  Contraception  methods that in the context of this guidance are considered to have low user dependency.  
3  Vasectomized  partner is a highly effective method provided of avoiding pregnancy that partner is the sole sexual 
partner of the WOCBP trial participant and that th e vasectomized  partner has received medical assessment of the 
surgical success.  
4  In the context of this guidance, sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire per iod of risk associated with the study treatments.  The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.

Amendment (Version) 6 : 28 JUN 2017  
Amendment (Version) 7: 21 SEP 2018  
Amendment 7 (21 SEP 2018) 
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to reduce required study procedures and update 
guidelines on the management of legacy subjects who remained on epacadostat monotherapy. 
This amendment includes the changes to INCB  24360-203 Protocol Amendment 6 
(28 JUN 2017) summarized below. 
1. Synopsis; Section 5.4, Duration of Treatment and Subject Participation; 
Section  5.7.1, Withdrawal Criteria; Section 6.2, Treatment Period; Section 6.2.1, 
Restarting Treatment With Study Therapy After Treatment  Withdrawal; 
Section  7.3.6, Laboratory Assessments; Section 7.3.7, Chest Radiograph; Section 
7.4.2, Tumor Imaging During the Study; Appendix  F, Re-Treatment  
Description of change:   The duration of epacadostat monotherapy treatment for any 
subject taking epacadostat monotherapy at the time of Amendment 6 and allowed to remain on the monotherapy regimen was capped at 12 months, thereby also cappin g 
overall treatment duration maximum for these subjects at 24 months.  Exceptions will 
require medical monitor review and approval every 3 months.  The option for subjects 
who completed 12 months of combination therapy with SD or better, to restart study 
therapy post-progression was removed. 
Rationale for change:   The sponsor has decided to cap the duration of epacadostat 
monotherapy and remove the option to restart combination therapy post-progression 
based on emerging data, from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-252/EC HO-301 study in advanced 
or metastatic melanoma.  
2. Section 1.2, Study Rationale  
Description of change:   Language regarding the results of the ECHO -
301/KEYNOTE -252 study eDMC review was added.

(Table 28:  Sample Collection Windows for Ph armacokinetic Assessments for 
Durvalumab [Phase 1 and Phase 2]);  
Description of change:   Follow-up phases (disease and survival follow-up) beyond the 
90-day safety follow-up visit have been removed from the protocol.  The frequency of 
required endocrine function testing and disease imaging studies has changed from every 8 weeks  (4 cycles)  to every 12 weeks  (6 cycles) .  Study completion criteria have been 
revised to include completion of the 90-day safety follow-up period.  ECOG performance status, durvalumab pharmacokinetic sample collection beyond Cycle 2, soluble PD-1 concentration, , and  whole blood correlative 
assessment have all been removed from the protocol.  The language regarding collection of optional on-treatment biopsies was modified.  The requirement to submit copies of tumor imaging data to a central vendor was removed.  The requirement to confirm radio graphic responses was removed. 
Rationale for change:   The frequency and necessity of study procedures were modified 
based on emerging data from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-252/ECHO-301 study in advanced 
or metastatic melanoma.  
5. Section 5.6.2, Criteria and Procedures for Interruption or Dose Reduction (Table 8 :  
Dose Modification Guidelines of Epacadostat and Durvalumab for Non −Immune -
Related Adverse Events); Section 5.6.3, Criteria for Subjects Exhibiting Immune-
Related Adverse Events

Protocol INCB 24360- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
Amendment 6 (28 JUN 2017) 
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to revise the design and composition of the NSCLC, 
SCCHN, and TCC of the GU tract Phase 2 expansion cohorts.  Additional changes include removal of the optional epacadostat monotherapy treatment period of the study updating 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and including updated safety information for epacadostat and 
durvalumab. 
This amendment includes the changes to INCB  24360-203 Protocol Amendment 5 
(25 MAY 2016) summarized below. 
1. Synopsis; Section 4.1.2, Phase 2; Section 4.4, Number of Subjects; Section 9.2.2, 
Sample Size for Phase 2  
Description of change:   The Phase 2 expansion cohorts for the NSCLC, SCCHN, and 
TCC tumors were revised  from a Simon 2-stage design to single expansion cohorts 
treated at the epacadostat 300 mg BID dose level.  The approximate sample size for each 
cohort was increased, as was the approximate total number of subjects expected to be 
enrolled into the study and the estimated last subject completion date.  The number of prior PD -1 pathway–treated subjects in each cohort was restricted to 10.  Table 6 and 
Table 31 were added to depict the new expansion cohort composition and statistical basis for the sample size.  
Rationale for change:   The design and composition of the NSCLC, SCCHN, and TCC 
cohorts were revised to allow for the full complement of Phase 2 subjects enrolled with these tumor types to be analyzed at the epacadostat 300 mg BID dose level.  The sample size for these tumor types, and subsequently the estimated planned number of total 
subjects enrolled and estimated last subject completed date, were modified to account for 
the heterogeneity of PD -1 pathway–treated and PD -1 pathway–naive subjects within the  
respective tumor types.  Restricting the number of prior PD-1 pathway–treated subjects 
within each cohort was instituted to preserve the predicted levels of baseline efficacy 
observed with PD-1 pathway monotherapy.  
2. Synopsis; Section 4.1, Overall Study Design; Section 5.1.1, Epacadostat; Section 5.4, 
Duration of Treatment and Subject Participation; Section 5.6.2, Criteria and 
Procedures for Interruption or Dose Reduction; Section 5.7, Withdrawal of Subjects from Study Treatment; Section 6, Study Assessments  (Table 21:  Schedule of 
Assessments); Section 6.2, Treatment Period; Section 6.2.1, Restarting Treatment With Study Therapy After Treatment Withdrawal; Section 6.4.2, Follow- Up; 
Section 7.3.6, Laboratory Assessments; Section 7.3.7, Chest Radiograph; Section 
7.4.2, Tumor Imaging During the Study; Appendix F:   Re-Treatment  
Description of change:   The epacadostat monotherapy treatment option was removed 
from the Protocol.  Relevant sections were modified to allow for restarting combination therapy upon evidence of disease progression under certain conditions and to allow for 
subjects to be re-treated with durvalumab monotherapy upon evidence of disease progression if the combination therapy was not tolerated in the initial treatment period

due to a toxicity at tributed to epacadostat, but they completed 12 months of durvalumab 
and had a status of stable disease or better when they discontinued treatment. 
Rationale for change:   Based on emerging data with regard to epacadostat monotherapy 
as well as monotherapy d ata from other agents targeting the IDO pathway, there is no 
clear evidence of antitumor activity with IDO inhibitors as monotherapy in the tumors 
being evaluated in this study.  IDO1 is an interferon response gene and a resistance 
mechanism to PD -1 pathway targeting agents.  Based on Phase 2 studies, augmenting 
activity of PD -1 pathway −targeting agents has been reported in tumor types where PD-1 
pathway−targeting agents have been approved by regulatory authorities.  Thus, 
responders who complete 12 months of treatment and discontinue study treatment may 
resume combination therapy. 
3. Synopsis; Section 3.3, Subject Exclusion Criteria  
Description of changes:  
a. Exclusion criteria 1e and 1f were revised to remove alkaline phosphatase and update 
requirements for aspa rtate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total 
bilirubin. 
b. Criterion 7 was revised to exclude subjects with major surgical procedure within 28 days of starting study treatment OR inadequate recovery from toxicity and/or complications from major  surgery before starting study treatment.  
c. Criterion 9 was revised to include carcinomatous meningitis and define CNS metastases.  
d. Criterion 10 was revised to include additional autoimmune and inflammatory disorders and updated exceptions. 
e. Criterion 23 was revised to include additional requirements for subjects who have received prior immunotherapy.  
f. New criteria 26 and 27 added to exclude subjects with a history of primary immunodeficiency or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.  
Rationale for changes:   To make cri teria consistent with current epacadostat and/or 
durvalumab development program standard protocol language. 
4. Synopsis; Section 1.3, Potential Risks and Benefits of the Treatment Regimen; 
Section 5.6.2, Criteria and Procedures for Interruption or Dose Reduct ion (Table 8); 
Section 5.6.3, Criteria for Subjects Exhibiting Immune- Related Adverse Events 
(including Tables 10 -17 and 19)  Section 5.6.4, Procedures for Subjects Exhibiting 
Serotonin Syndrome  
Description of change:   Safety language with regard to epacad ostat and durvalumab, 
including updated guidelines for the management of certain immune- related adverse 
events, were revised or added. 
Rationale for change:   To align the Protocol with the current safety-related information 
and strategies pertinent to the epacadostat and durvalumab clinical development 
programs.

The primary purpose of this amendment is to provide additional guidance for subjects continuing 
on monotherapy epacadostat and provide guidance for subjects who restart treatment with 
combination therapy after durvalumab has been stopped. 
This amendment includes the changes to the INCB 24360-203 Protocol Amendment 4 
(12 JAN 2016) summarized be low. 
1. Synopsis; Section 3.3, Subject Exclusion Criteria (Criterion #5); Section 5.6.3.9, 
Procedures for Immune -Related Adverse Events Not Specifically Described 
Above; Section 5.10, Concomitant Medications and Measures 
Description of change:   The threshold for systemic steroids was changed from 
≥ 7.5 mg/day to ≥ 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent. 
Rationale for change:   Several recent studies evaluating immune- related adverse 
events (irAEs) and the need for systemic immunosuppression indicate that low doses 
of systemic steroids for the management of irAEs do not impact survival or time to 
treatment failure.  Although the threshold for the study was increased, a maximum dose of 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent is still considered a low dose.  
2. Section 1.1.6, Melanoma; Section 1.1.7, Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer; 
Section  1.1.9, Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck; Section 1.1.11, 
Gastric and Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer 
Description of change:   Updated background information on therapies approved for 
the tre atment of melanoma, non- small cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of 
the head and neck, and gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer.  
Rationale for change:   To provide up- to-date information. 
3. Section 3.2, Subject Inclusion Criteria  
Description of  change:   Inclusion criterion #16 was updated to note that male 
subjects should refrain from sperm donation from screening through 90 days after the 
last dose of study drug. 
Rationale for change:   Male subjects were required to take appropriate precautions  
throughout the study not to father a child, which was inclusive of sperm donation.  
The language seeks to clarify the subject's responsibilities while participating in the 
study.

4. Section 3.3, Subject Exclusion Criteria; Section 6, Study Assessments (Table  21) 
Description of change:   Exclusion criterion #16 and Table 21 were updated to 
specify that subjects with hepatitis B no longer are required to have Hepatitis B 
surface antigen antibody testing.  Subjects with hepatitis C antibody positivity may also en roll if they have completed treatment for hepatitis C intended to eradicate to 
the virus and hepatitis C RNA levels are undetectable.  
Rationale for change:   The availability of highly active treatments for HCV has 
transformed hepatitis C into a curable illness.  Subjects who have undergone antiviral 
therapy and have an undetectable viral load are an important population to consider 
for immunotherapy studies.  In the dose-escalation phase of the study, subjects underwent increased monitoring of liver chemist ry tests weekly for the first 8  weeks 
on study.  There were no cases of hepatitis reported, and no subjects experienced drug-induced liver injury while on study.  A recent case study of 2 HCV+ subjects treated with pembrolizumab alone and pembrolizumab + ipilumumab demonstrated 
that no significant toxicities and no increases in viral load occurred during the course 
of immunotherapy treatment.
1  The safety expansion portion of this 1b study includes 
interim safety analyses approximately every 3 months and of fers a unique opportunity 
to study this population in the clinical trial setting.  For this reason, we plan to allow subjects with previously treated and controlled hepatitis C infections to participate in the safety expansion.  
With respect to hepatitis B,  the Protocol excluded subjects with prior HBV exposure, 
regardless of whether they are immune or have chronic active disease.  The Protocol is modified to allow subjects who by definition of the CDC Guidelines are immune to 
HBV, and those with chronic act ive HBV are still excluded 
(http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hbv/hbvfaq.htm#general). 
5. Section 3.3, Subject Exclusion Criteria  
Description of change:   Exclusion criterion #22 was updated to note that a subject 
with an arrhythmia may enroll if the subject is on anti-arrhythmic medication and is 
in sinus rhythm on the screening ECG. 
Rationale for change:   More than 250 subjects have been administered epacadostat 
monotherapy or epacadostat in combination with other immune-checkpoint inhibitors, 
and no clinically me aningful changes or cardiac trends have been noted.

6. Section 4.1.2, Phase 2 
Description of change:  Revised to indicate that if more than 1 PAD is evaluated, the 
cohort may or may not be  repeated for the specified tumor type.  
Rationale for change:   A higher dose level may be explored based on PK/PD data 
from the Phase 1 portion of the study.  If target inhibition at the 300 mg BID dose 
level is greater than the 100 mg BID dose level, subjects may be enrolled at the 
higher dose level.  If the lower dose level does not meet the threshold for the number of responses required to expand the cohort, the cohort may be enrolled at the higher 
dose level.  
7. Section 5.6.2, Criteria and Procedures for Interruption or Dose Reduction  
Description of change:   In Table 7 (Dose Modification Guidelines of Epacadostat 
and Durvalumab for Non −Immune- Related Adverse Events), "Action with Respect to 
Durvalumab" was revised for infusion-related reactions:  For Grade 1 or 2,  the time 
limit of "up to 4 hours" for temporary interruption of durvalumab was deleted; for 
Grade ≥ 3, a note was added that severe infusion-related reactions should be managed 
per institutional standards (eg, IM epinephrine, followed by IV diphenhydramine and 
ranitidine, and IV glucocorticoid). 
Rationale for change :  To provide additional guidance to investigators regarding the 
management of irAEs . 
8. Section 5.6.3, Criteria for Subjects Exhibiting Immune- Related Adverse Events  
Description of change:   Tables 9 through 15 (Recommended Approach for Handling 
Noninfectious Pneumonitis, Enterocolitis, Hepati tis, Dermatitis, Neuropathies, 
Endocrinopathies, and Nephritis or Renal Dysfunction, respectively) were updated, 
and precautions were added for any grade immune-mediated peripheral neuromotor 
syndromes, such as Guillain- Barré syndrome and myasthenia gravis.  
Rationale for change:  To provide additional guidance to investigators regarding the 
management of irAEs.  
9. Section 5.9, Beginning and End of Study  
Description of change:   Revised to define end of study as when all subje cts have 
discontinued the study drug and have completed applicable follow-up assessments, 
and to indicate that if ≤ 5 subjects are on study for more than 6 months, a database 
lock of the study may occur to allow the analysis of the study data.  Any remaini ng 
subjects may continue on study until a discontinuation criterion is met and/or written notification is provided to the sponsor. 
Rationale for change:   To clarify that the end of study will be declared when all 
subjects have been discontinued the study drug and completed all applicable 
follow-up visits.

14. Section 7.6.1.1, Pharmacokinetic Assessment for Epacadostat 
Description of change:   In T able 24 (Sample Collection Windows for 
Pharmacokinetic Assessments for Epacadostat), the window for the 6-hour and 
optional 8- to 10-hour samples was changed to ± 60 minutes (instead of ± 30 minutes).  
Rationale for change:  Visit windows were lengthened to allow greater flexibility.  
15. Section 9.6, Interim Analysis 
Description of change: The interim analysis was modified to evaluate all ≥ Grade 3 
adverse events attributable to the investigational agents in Phase 2 of the study. 
Rationale for change:   The revis ed criteria for evaluation allows for efficient 
monitoring of safety in a larger sample size.  
16. Section 10.1.1.1, Epacadostat 
Description of change:   The packaging/labeling statement was revised to:  All Incyte 
investigational product labels will be in the local language and will comply with the 
legal requirements of each country.  
Rationale for change:  The study will now include ex- US centers; therefore, the 
language was updated for global compliance.  
17. Appendix A, Information Regarding Effectiveness of Contraceptive Methods  
Description of change:   Appendix A was updated with Clinical Trial Facilitation 
Group's recommendations related to contraception in clinical studies.  
Rationale for change: The study will now include ex- US centers; therefore, the 
language wa s updated for global compliance.  
18. Incorporation of administrative changes.  Other minor, administrative changes have been incorporated throughout the Protocol and are noted in the redline version 
of the amendment.

4. Synopsis; Section 3.2, Subject Inclusion Criteria  
Description of change:   Inclusion criterion #6 was updated to indicate that subjects with 
NSCLC may have received prior treatment with an anti–PD -1 targeted agent.  
Rationale for change:   The PD -1 targeted agents nivolumab and pembrolizumab were 
recently approved for the treatment of subjects with metastatic NSCLC who have disease 
progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.  Therefore, subj ects may have 
received prior therapy with either of these agents.  
5. Synopsis; Section 3.3, Subject Exclusion Criteria  
Description of change:   Exclusion criterion #21 was revised to indicate that subjects 
with a screening QTc interval > 480 msec (instead of > 470 msec) are excluded.  
Rationale for change:   An analysis of QTc interval prolongation and the relationship 
between epacadostat plasma concentration and QTc intervals in Phase 1 and 2 
epacadostat studies was conducted, and no clinically meaningful change s or trends were 
noted. 
6. Section 1.1.5, Combined Immune Checkpoint Inhibition; Section 1.1.6, Melanoma; 
Section 1.1.7, Non −Small Cell Lung Cancer, Section 1.1.13, Preclinical and Clinical 
Study Data; Section 1.3, Potential Risks and Benefits of the Treatmen t Regimen; 
Section 1.4, Justification for Treatment Regimen 
Description of change:   In Section 1.1.5, additional background information was added 
from a study of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab versus ipilimumab alone, and 
updated data were added from the ongoing Phase 1/2 study of epacadostat in combination 
with ipilimumab.  In Sections 1.1.6 and 1.1.7, information regarding recent approvals for 
the treatment of melanoma and NSCLC was added.  Preclinical and clinical study data 
were updated in Section  1.1.13.  Safety data were updated in Sections 1.3 and 1.4. 
Rationale for change:   To provide up- to-date information. 
7. Section 1.3.1, Risks from Epacadostat; Section 6, Study Assessments, Section 7.3.4, Assessment of Serotonin Syndrome Symptoms  
Descript ion of change:   Serotonin syndrome assessment was deleted from the schedule 
of assessments (Table 19) and corresponding sections. 
Rationale for change:  Of the 253 subjects administered INCB24360 to date, no subjects 
have exhibited serotonin syndrome.  Subjects and sites are informed of the signs and symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome; however, the separate serotonin 
syndrome assessment has been removed from the Protocol.

8. Section 5.6.3.3, Procedures and Guidance for Hepatitis; Section 6, Study 
Asse ssments, Section 7.3.6.1.1, Liver Chemistry Monitoring 
Description of change:   The requirement to conduct liver chemistry tests weekly for the 
first 8 weeks on study treatment was deleted.  
Rationale for change:   Because of the low incidence of Grade 3 or greater ALT and 
AST elevations seen on study, weekly monitoring of liver chemistry tests are not required.  Additional monitoring of liver chemistries will occur every cycle while epacadostat is administered as combination therapy.  
9. Section 5.10, Concomitant Medications and Measures  
Description of change:   Text updated to indicate that concomitant medications 
administered as treatment prophylaxis (eg, for the management of infusion reactions) 
should be recorded in the CRF.  A new table was added (Table 18) to provide warfarin 
dose modification guidance. 
Rationale for change:   In the INCB 24360-102 study, PK  modeling 
showed that the observed extent of epacadostat interaction on multiple-dose warfarin PK 
is expected to cause greater INR increases  in subjects on warfarin therapy; therefore, 
detailed coadministration guidance has been provided. 
10. Section 6, Study Assessments, Section 7.3.7, Pulmonary Function Tests 
Description of change:   The requirement for pulmonary function testing was deleted 
from  Tables 20 and 21. 
Rationale for change:   Because of the low incidence of Grade 3 or greater pulmonary 
events, the requirement for pulmonary function testing has been removed.  
11. Section 6, Study Assessments; Section 7.3.5, Twelve- Lead Electrocardiograms  
Description of change:  Timing of ECGs was clarified in Table  19 (footnote c) and a 
new table was added to Section 7.3.5 (Table 22) providing the schedule and timing of 
ECG assessments.  
Rationale for change:   ECGs will be taken in conjunction with the updated timepoints 
for PK assessments.  
12. Section 6, Study Assessments; Section 7.6.1, Pharmacokinetics 
Description of change:   The PK sample collection timing for epacadostat and 
durvalumab PK was updated, and a new table was added (Table 25) providing sample 
collection windows for durvalumab PK assessments. 
Rationale for change:   Pharmacokinetic assessments for the INCB24360 program were 
aligned to collect additional information at predose, C
max, and steady state.

13. Section 7.4, Efficacy Assessments 
Description of change:   The tumor imaging sections were updated to indicate that 
imaging of the pelvis is only required for subjects with TCC of the GU tract but is 
strongly encouraged for all subjects. 
Rationale for change:   Pelvic imaging is considered standard of care fo r TCC of the GU 
tract.

3. Synopsis, Key Inclusion Criteria and Key Exclusion Criteria; Section 3.2, Subject 
Inclusion Criteria; Section 3.3, Subject Exclusion Criteria  
Description of change:   Inclusion criterion 5b and exclusion criterion 4 have been 
updated to allow prior anti–PD -1 therapy for melanoma as well as any tumor type in 
which a PD -1 pathway targeted agent is approved. 
Rationale for change:   PD-1 targeted agents have been approved for use in subjects with 
melanoma and have also been incorporated into the NCCN guidelines as an option for 
first-line treatment in melanoma.  Incyte anticipates additional approvals for anti–PD -1 
and anti–PD -L1 targeted agents in other tumor types during the conduct of this study. 
4. Synopsis, Key In clusion Criteria; Section 3.2, Subject Inclusion Criteria  
Description of change:   Inclusion criterion 7 has been updated to allow subjects with 
exocrine pancreatic neoplasms to enroll in Part 1.  Part 2 subjects must have adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.  
Rationale for change:   The change was updated to allow for a broader population of 
pancreatic subjects to enroll in the study.  
5. Synopsis, Key Inclusion Criteria; Section 3.2, Subject Inclusion Criteria; Section  7.6.3.5, Analysis of Tumor Samples 
Description of change:   Fresh tumor biopsies are still required for all subjects at 
screening; however, subjects may now be enrolled if the tumor tissue is deemed inaccessible by the local interventional radiologist in consultation with the subject's 
treating physician .  This exception requires medical monitor approval.  Archival tumor 
tissue should be submitted if available; however, if archival tumor tissue is not available 
and the subject is able to undergo a fresh biopsy, the subject will be considered eligible. 
Rationale for change:   Subjects with late -stage disease may have had any diagnostic 
archival specimens exhausted or have had their initial diagnosis made by fine- needle 
aspirate that would not be adequate for correlative studies.  Therefore, if these subjects  
are willing and able to submit fresh biopsy samples they will not be excluded from the 
study (Administrative Change 2 dated 31 MAR 2015). 
6. Synopsis, Key Inclusion Criteria; Section 3.3, Subject Exclusion Criteria; 
Section  7.3.6, Twelve- Lead Electrocardiograms  
Description of change:  The average QTc of the 3 ECGs may be used for enrollment if a 
single QTc is > 470 milliseconds.  In addition, subjects with an intraventricular conduction delay (eg, right bundle branch block), JTc < 340 milliseconds is acceptable; 
however, subjects with a left bundle branch block would be excluded. 
Rationale for change:   Additional guidance was requested for situations when one of the 
3 QTc measurements obtained at baseline exceeds > 470 milliseconds and for subjects 
with an intraventricular conduction delay.

7. Synopsis, Study Drugs, Dosages, and Modes of Administration; Section 5.1.1, 
Epacadostat 
Description of change:   Instructions for epacadostat administration have been updated to 
specify that an additional dose should not be t aken if a subject vomits.  
Rationale for change:   Language was added to inform sites how to manage dosing if this 
event occurs in subjects dosed with epacadostat. 
8. Section 1.1, Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background 
Description of change:   New subsections containing background information for 
epacadostat (Section 1.1.3) and durvalumab (Section 1.1.4) have been added.  
Section  1.1.6 (Melanoma) was updated to include NCCN guidance and CHMP approval 
of PD -1 inhibitors for the treatment of melanoma.  Section 1.1.10 (Preclinical and 
Clinical Trial Data) was updated to include a summary of epacadostat pharmacokinetic 
(PK)  data and durvalumab PK data in humans. 
Rational for change:  Therapeutic background section was updated for consistency with 
the most recent information from the Investigator Brochures (IBs) for epacadostat and durvalumab. 
9. Section 1.3.1, Risks From Epacadostat 
Description of change:   Updated to report that in Study INCB 24360-201, 12 of the 
48 subjects enrolled as of 29 OCT 2014 received concomitant treatment with an MAOI 
and epacadostat, and that 0 of the 12 subjects exhibited serotonin syndrome. 
Rationale for change:   Theoretically, inhibition of IDO1 could cause an increase in 
serotonin levels that could precipitate a cluster of AEs termed serotonin syndrome (SS) 
when administered alone or in combination with other serotonergic agents.  This rare 
syndrome has been associated with some monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and combinations of serotonergic drugs.  MAOIs and sero tonergic drugs are prohibited while 
on study however, data from the INCB 24360-201 study indicate that SS was not observed in 0 of 12 subjects who received concomitant treatment with an MAOI and 
epacadostat.  
10. Section 5.6.2, Criteria and Procedures for Inter ruption or Dose Reduction  
Description of change:   The infusion of durvalumab may be interrupted for up to 
4 hours if an infusion reaction occurs. 
Rationale for change:   Instructions in Table 7 were updated to make consistent with 
Section 5.1.2.2. 
11. Section 5 .6.3, Criteria for Subjects Exhibiting Immune- Related Adverse Events  
Description of change:  The recommended approach to managing immune- related 
adverse events was updated.  
Rationale for change:  The update provides additional guidance for supportive care 
measures for pneumonitis, enterocolitis, hepatitis, dermatitis, neuropathies, 
endocrinopathies other than hypothyroidism, and nephritis or renal dysfunction.

12. Section 7.4.3, RECIST v1.1 
Description of change:   Updated to indicate that tumor lesions located in a previously 
irradiated area or in an area subjected to other locoregional therapy should not be selected 
as target lesions.  In addition, tumor lesions that will be biopsied should not be selected as target lesions.  
Rationale for change:  Lesions locat ed in a previously irradiated area or in an area 
subjected to other locoregional therapy may confound the results of the overall response assessment for the subject. 
13. Incorporation of administrative changes and adoption and use of INN generic 
names for INCB 024360 and MEDI4736 have been replaced throughout.  Other 
minor, administrative changes have been incorporated throughout the Protocol and are 
noted in the attached red -line/strike -out version of the amendment.

Amendment 2 (20 FEB 2015)  
Overall Rationale f or the Amendment:  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to allow for the option of intrasubject dose escalation 
to 10 mg/kg for subjects who enroll in the initial dose cohort at MEDI4736 3 mg/kg in 
combination with INCB024360.  This option will only be available when MEDI4736 10 mg/kg has been shown to be tolerable in combination with INCB024360 25 mg BID based on DLT 
rules.  
This amendment includes the changes to INCB 24360-203 Protocol Amendment 1 
(29 SEP  2014) summarized below. 
1. Synopsis, Study Drugs, D osages, and Modes of Administration; Section 5.1.2, 
MEDI4736; Section 5.6.1, Planned Dose Increases  
Description:   Allow the option for subjects enrolled into the initial dose cohort of 
INCB024360 25 mg BID and MEDI4736 3 mg/kg to dose escalate to MEDI4736 
10 mg/kg in combination with INCB024360 25 mg BID if a number of conditions are met. 
Rationale:  MEDI4736 at a dose of 10 mg/kg has been shown to be well tolerated and is being carried forward as the dose in Phase 3 studies.  If 10 mg/kg is found to be tolerable in combination with INCB024360 25 mg BID based on DLT rules, subjects who start at a 
dose of 3 mg/kg will be given the opportunity to escalate the dose to 10 mg/kg at the 
discretion of the investigator. 
2. Synopsis, Key Inclusion Criteria; Section 3.2, Subject Inclusion Criteria  
Description of change to inclusion criterion #4:   Added language to allow 
investigational agents in combination with standard therapies to be considered a line of therapy and also allow adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or chemoradiation regimens given within 
6 months of screening to be considered a line of therapy. 
Rationale:   Reorganization of inclusion criteria already present in the Protocol to clarify 
that these situations may apply to subjects of any disease indication. 
Description of change to inclusion criterion #5:   Clarified that melanoma subjects may 
be treatment -naïve or have received prior anti–CTLA -4 therapy with the exception that in 
Phase 1, subjects with BRAF mutations must have received prior treatment with a 
BRAF  inhibito r. 
Rationale:   A recent update to the NCCN guidelines for melanoma has listed anti–PD -1 
therapy as an option for first-line treatment.  MEDI4736 is an anti- PD-L1 antibody and 
the mechanism of action is similar; therefore, it is reasonable to allow subjects  to 
consider treatment in this study as appropriate first- line treatment.  
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 162 of 166 
Protocol INCB 24360- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
Description of change to inclusion criterion #6:   Removed the requirement for prior 
treatment with a platinum- based therapy.  Clarified the requirement for subjects with 
driver mutations to have received and progressed or be intolerant to a targeted agent, if 
one is available.  
Rationale:   To allow NSCLC subjects who are not eligible for treatment with a 
platinum-based therapy the opportunity to enroll in the study and to clarify that subjects who have tumors with driver mutations should receive appropriate targeted therapy if one is available.  
3. Synopsis, Key Exclusion Criteria; Section 3.3, Subject Exclusion Criteria 
Description of change to exclusion criterion #1b:   Platelet count of <  75 × 10
9/L at 
baseline is now considered exclusionary. 
Rationale:  Heavily pretreated subjects may have persistent low -grade 
thrombocytopenia.  As the risk of myelosuppression with the combination treatment 
given in this study is low, it is reasonable to allow subjects with Grade 1 
thrombocytopenia to enroll. 
Description of change to exclusion criterion #21:   Subjects with a QTc interval of 
> 470 ms are excluded. 
Rationale:   Based on preclinical testing, there is no QTc liability for either INCB024360 
or M EDI4736.  The original QTc interval criterion was too strict in error and has been 
corrected to allow enrollment with a QTc interval of up to 470 msec. Description of change to exclusion criterion #25:   Addition of an exclusion criterion 
that would require a conversation with the medical monitor to determine eligibility for a 
subject requiring ongoing thorocentesis or paracentesis for palliation. Rationale:   Requirements for recurrent thorocentesis or paracentesis may be indicative of 
aggressive end -stage d isease, and cases should be reviewed with the medical monitor to 
determine if the subject is an appropriate candidate for the study. 
4. Section 1.1.4, Melanoma; Section 1.3.2.2, Possible Risks Based on Clinical Data 
Description:   Added information on the recent FDA approval of anti–PD -1 antibodies 
for use in a subset of patients with metastatic melanoma and updated clinical data for 
MEDI4736 to reflect an IB update. 
Rationale:  To provide investigators with the most updated information. 
5. Section 4.1.2, Phase 2 
Description:   Requirement for at least 5 subjects with PD -L1–positive tumors in each 
expansion cohort has been removed from the Protocol. 
Rationale:   This requirement and the caveat to enroll additional subjects that express 
PD-L1 would have compromised the integrity of the Simon 2 -stage design planned for 
Phase 2 of the study.  Therefore, the requirement was removed.

12. Appendix F, Prohibited UGT -1A9 Inhibitors 
Description:   A new appendix was added listing prohibited UGT-1A9 inhibitors.   
Rationale:   The use of UGT -1A9 inhibitors is prohibited while subjects are on st udy 
treatment per Section 5.10.2.  A list of these agents was added as a reference for 
investigators.

Amendment 1 (29 SEP 2014) 
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to address FDA's 25 SEP 2014 clinical comments, 
including clarification and requested changes to the inclusion criteria, updates to the definition of 
dose- limiting toxicities, addition of dose levels to the dose -escalation portion of the study, and 
revision of the observation period for dose- limiting toxicities.  
This amendment includes the changes to the INCB 24360-203 Protocol (dated 18 AUG 2014) summarized below. 
1. Synopsis; Section 1.4, Justification for Treatment Regimen; Section 4.1.1 Phase 1

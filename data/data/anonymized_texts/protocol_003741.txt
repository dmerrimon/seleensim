Title:  A Randomized, Double -Masked, Vehicle- Controlled, Dose Ranging Study to  Assess the 
Efficacy and Safety of Voclosporin Ophthalmic Solution (VOS) i n Subjects with Dry Eye 
Syndrome  
Study Product:  Voclosporin Ophthalmic Solution (VOS)  
Indication:  Dry Eye Syndrome  (DES) 
Phase:  2/3 
Sponsor:  Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
Study Code:  AUR -VOS- 2019- 01 
Objectives:  To assess the efficacy  and safety  of three different concentrations of VOS (0.05%, 0.10 %, 
and 0.20 %) when administer ed twice a day (BID) in both eye s (OU) over 12 weeks 
compared to vehicle in subjects with DES.  
Design:  This is a Phase 2/3, multi- center, randomized, double -masked, vehicle -controlled study to 
assess the efficacy and safety of three different concentrations of VOS when administered 
OU BID over 12 weeks in subjects with mild to moderate DES. Subjects will undergo a 
2-week run -in period in which VOS vehicle will be self -administered OU, BID. Subjects 
will be re -assessed to confirm that all participants meet all of the inclusion criteria and 
none of the exclusion criteria. It is estimated  that the study will enroll approximately 480 
subjects across approximately 9 study centers. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 
1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the following study treatment groups  after the 14 - to 17-day run- in 
period. 
Treatment:  Subjects will be randomized to one of the following treatment groups:  
Investigational product  (IP): one drop 0.05% VOS, OU BID over 12 weeks , one drop 
0.10% VOS OU BID over  12 weeks , or one drop 0.20 % VOS OU BID over  12 weeks.

Primary Endpoint:  • Proportion of subjects with a ≥10 mm increase from baseline in STT at Week 4 
in the study eye . The study eye will be defined as the  eye that achieves the lowest  
STT score at baseline. Should a subject have identical STT scores in both eyes 
at baseline, the eye with the worst FCS score will be used. Should these scores 
also be equal, the right eye will be used.  
Key Secondary Endpoint:  • Mean change from baseline in Eye Dryness VAS at Week 4 in subjects with a 
baseline Eye Dryness VAS score ≥ 60mm. 
Secondary Endpoints:  Secondary Endpoints : 
• Proportion of subjects with  a ≥10 mm increase from baseline in STT at Weeks 
2, 8, and 12 in the study eye.  
• Mean change from baseline in total FCS (NEI/Industry Workshop 0 -15 scale) 
score to Weeks 2,  4, 8, and 12 in the study eye.  
 
AUDREY (AUR -VOS -2019- 01) Protocol, Final Version 1.0 Confidential  
26 July 2019  Page 8 of 73 • Mean change from baseline in F CS score in the 5 regions of the cornea (central, 
superior, inferior, temporal , and nasal) to Weeks 2,  4, 8, and 12 in the study eye.  
• Mean change from baseline in STT score to Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 in the study 
eye. 
• Mean change from baseline in Eye Dryness VAS (0 -100 mm) sc ore to Weeks 2,  
4, 8, and 12 within treatment group.  
• Mean change from baseline in Ocular Discomfort  VAS (0 -100 mm) score to 
Weeks 2,  4, 8, and 12.  
• Mean change from baseline in E ye Dryness , Burning/S tinging , Itching, 
Photophobia , Eye Pain, Foreign Body Sensation , and Blurred Vision  VAS 
(0-100 mm) score to Weeks 2, 4 , 8, and 12. 
• Mean change from baseline of  the sum of Individual Symptom S core (VAS Total 
Symptom Summary Score) to Weeks 2,  4, 8, and 12.  
• Mean change from baseline in Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE) 
frequency and severity scores to Week 2, 4, 8, and 12.  
Safety Endpoints : 
• Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
• Change from baseline in BCVA  over time  
• Changes from baseline in slit-lamp biomicroscopy  over time  
• Changes from s creening in d ilated ophthalmoscopy  over time  
Procedures:  Subjects who have provided signed and dated informed consent will be screened for entry 
into this study. Subjects will be evaluated for eligibility according to the protocol 
inclusion/ exclusion criteria. Eligible subjects will enter a 14- to 17 -day run-in period 
during which time they will receive vehicle drops and will be instructed to instill one drop of vehicle OU BID. Subjects will be re -evaluated for eligibility after the run -in pe riod.  
After the run -in period, e ligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 
one of the four treatment groups: VOS 0.05% BID, VOS 0.1% BID, VOS 0.2% BID , or 
VOS vehicle BID.  
Subjects will self -instill the assigned treatment, one drop OU B ID, over 12 weeks.  
Sample Size:  This study is expected to enroll 480 subjects into 4 treatment arms. A two- group continuity 
corrected Chi square test with a 0.0166 two -sided significance leve l (adjusted for three 
treatment comparisons versus placebo) will have at least 80% power to detect the 
difference between a vehicle response rate of 20% (defined as the percentage of subjects 
with a ≥ 10 mm increase in STT from baseline)  and a VOS response rate of 40% when the 
sample size in each group is 120 (total N=480). Response is defined as an increase of ≥10 
mm in STT from baseline to Week 4.  
While the effect of withdrawals will be investigated, subjects withdrawing prior to Week 
4 STT assessment for any reason will be counted as non- responders in the primary analysis 
and therefore no adjustment of sample size for withdrawals is necessary.  Subjects 
providing insufficient data to determine response at Week 4 (e.g. , early withdrawal) will 
be analysed as non -responders.  
An additional sensitivity analysis will analyse observed responses only.  
This sample size provides greater than 90% power to detect a significant change from baseline within any one of the three active treatment groups in the Eye Dryness VAS 
assuming the standard deviation of changes is 40 mm and the mean change from baseline is 20  mm (two -sided alpha=0.0166).  
 
AUDREY (AUR -VOS -2019- 01) Protocol, Final Version 1.0 Confidential  
26 July 2019  Page 9 of 73 The key secondary endpoint is analyzed within the population of subjects with an Eye 
Dryness VAS ≥60 mm at basel ine. It is expected that this will reduce the sample size for 
this analysis by 25% (from 120 per group to 90 per group). Assuming a standard deviation 
of 30  mm for change in eye dryness score and an improvement of any active arm compared 
to placebo (alpha= 0.0166) of 15 mm, a sample size of 90 subjects per group provides at 
least 80% power to detect a significant difference.  
Statistical 
Methods:  All statistical analyses will be undertaken at study closure and will incorporate all efficacy  
and safety endpoints.  
Analysis Populations : 
The following analysis populations will be considered:  
• Intent -to-Treat Population  – The intent -to-treat (ITT) population includes all 
randomized subjects. Subjects in the ITT population will be analyzed as randomized.  
• Per Protocol Population – The per protocol (PP) population includes subjects in the 
ITT population who do not have significant protocol deviations prior to their primary 
endpoint assessment at Week 4 and who complete the Week 4 STT.  Protocol 
deviations will be assessed prior to database lock and unmasking. The PP population 
will be analyzed as randomized. 
• Safety Population  – The safety population includes all randomized subjects who have 
received at least one dose of randomized study treatment. The safety population will be analyzed for all safety assessments. Subjects in the safety population will be 
analyzed as treated.  
• The run -in population will be used to describe all subjects who entered the run- in 
period.  
Baseline data will be summarized using the safety, ITT, and PP populations. Safety data will be summarized using the safety population, and efficacy analysis will us e the ITT and 
PP populations.  
Methods:  
Efficacy Endpoints:  
Analysis of the primary endpoint, proportion of subjects with a ≥10 mm increase from 
baseline in STT at Week 4 in the study eye, will be conducted on the ITT  and PP  
populations . The response rate for each VOS group compared to vehicle will be 
determined using a logistic regression model including terms for Investigator site, 
treatment group, and baseline STT. Results of this logistic regression will be displayed as 
odds ratios a nd two-sided adjusted 95% confidence intervals (CI) (VOS compared to 
vehicle). The proportion of subjects exhibiting a response at Week 4 will be summarized 
by treatment group.  
The key secondary endpoint of mean change from baseline in Eye Dryness VAS in the subset of subjects with baseline Eye Dryness VAS ≥ 60 mm will be analysed using the ITT 
and the PP populations. Mean change, along with an adjusted 95% CI and p- value, will 
be provided from a General Linear Model including terms for Investigator  site, treatment 
group and baseline Eye Dryness VAS.  
Other proportional endpoints (STT response at alternative time points) will be an alyzed  
and summarized in a similar fashion to the primary endpoint.  
Endpoints measured as continuous data (including VAS scores) w ill be summarized by 
visit for the ITT population only. Mean change from baseline (95% CI) will be provided 
for within treatment group changes and for differences between treatment groups (VOS 
– vehicle).  
 
AUDREY (AUR -VOS -2019- 01) Protocol, Final Version 1.0 Confidential  
26 July 2019  Page 10 of 73 Mixed Effect Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) will al so be used to analyze all 
available data for a given endpoint. The MMRM model will include terms for Investigator  
site, treatment group, visit, treatment- by-visit interaction , and applicable baseline 
measure. Results will be expressed as differences between treatment arms (VOS – 
vehicle) along with associated 95% CIs  and p- values . 
Safety Endpoints:  
Adverse events will be aggregated by System Organ Class and preferred term and 
presented as summary tables. BCVA will be summarized as a continuous endpoint with  
results displayed as mean changes from baseline for each visit. Slit- lamp biomicroscopy 
and dilated ophthalmoscopy will be summarized using frequency counts and shift tables 
from baseline.

26 July 2019  Page 17 of 73 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND  
Dry eye syndrome (DES) (also known as dry eye disease (DED) and keratoconjunctivitis sicca 
(KCS), herein referred to as DES) is a complex disorder of t he ocular surface disease (OSD) 
characterized by tear film instability progressing to tear hyperosmolarity, epithelial damage with inflammation, neurogenic inflammation , and eventual fibrosis of the lacrimal gland with 
reduced tear production [( Boboridis and Konstas 2018)]. The Tear Film and Ocular  Surface 
Society Dry Eye Workshop group defines global DES as a multi -factorial disease of the ocular 
surface  characterized by a loss of homeostasis of the tear film accompanied by ocular 
symptoms. These include tear film instability and hyperosmolarity, ocular surface  
inflammation and damage, and neurosensory abnormalities  [(Craig, Nichols et al. 2017 )]. The 
overall incidence of DES has significant geographic variation, with published data ranging 
from 5%- 34% of US adults over 50 years of age. Given the heterogeneity of patients, a 
retrospective analysis of the US Department of Defense M edical Claims Data demonstrated an 
overall prevalence of 5.3% of adults have DES , impacting twice as many women as  men, and 
increasing in prevalence with age. The 2015 US C ensus estimated that up to 16 million people 
experienced DES in the US [(Dana, Bradley et al. 2019)]. In patients with DE S, tear production 
has been shown to be increased with the use of topical immunosuppressants, including cyclosporine. Symptoms of DES include a sensation of dry eyes, foreign body sensation, 
irritation, burning, tearing, ocular pain, and itching, among others. DES affects quality of life 
and work productivity, and patients with moderate to severe DES may experience reduced 
visual function in addition to ocular dysfunction. Current  therapy includes a stepped approach, 
which starts with over- the-counter ( OTC ) lubricants and artificial tear replacements, and then 
expands to include topical anti -inflammatory therapy and punctal occlusion [( Craig, Nichols 
et al. 2017 )]. There are currently three FDA -approved prescription medications used for DES, 
topical cyclosporine ophthalmic solution 0.05% (Restasis
®, herein referred to as Restasis)  
[(Restasis® 2017)] , lifitegrast ophthalmic solution 5% (Xiidra®, herein referred to as Xiidra)  
[Xiidra® 2017], and cyclosporine ophthalmic solution 0.09% (Cequa ™, herein referred to as 
Cequa)  [(CEQUA® 2018 )]. A significant  number of patients using Restasis experience the 
following adverse reactions: ocular irritation upon instillation, slow onset of response, and limited efficacy  [(Restasis® 2017)] . Adverse reactions with Xiidra include instillation 
irritation, dysgeusia , and reduced vi sual acuity that  occurred in 5% -25% of subjects in clinical 
trials [Xiidra
® 2017] . The most common adverse reactions reported with Cequa were pain on 
instillation of drops (22%  of subjects) and conjunctival hyperemia (6%  of subjects ) 
[(CEQUA® 2018) ]. Despite these approved products, an unmet clinical need remains for 
improved therapeutic options for patients with moderate to severe DED. 
In patients with DES , tear production has been shown to be increased with the use of topi cal 
immunosuppressants, including cyclosporine. It is believed that T-lymphocyte infiltration and 
activation in the lacrimal gland represents an underlying pathogenesis for DES . Calcineurin 
inhibitors reversibly inhibit immunocompetent lymphocytes, particularly T-lymphocytes, in 
the G0 or G1 phase of the cell cycle and also reversibly inhibit the production and release of 
lymphokines [( Granelli -Piperno 1986)]. Calcineurin is a calcium - and calmodulin-dependent 
 
AUDREY (AUR -VOS -2019- 01) Protocol, Final Version 1.0 Confidential  
26 July 2019  Page 18 of 73 serine- threonine phosphatase. Calcineurin inhibitors ( CNIs ) inhibit the ability of calcineurin to 
dephosphorylate the nu clear factor of activated T -cells (NFAT), which is required for 
translocation of NFAT from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, thereby preventing activation of 
various transcription factors necessary for the induction of cytokine genes during T -cell 
activation ( i.e., interleukin- 2, interleukin- 4, tumor necrosis factor -α, granulocyte -macrophage 
colony stimulating factor, and interferon- γ) [(Stepkowski 2000, Wiseman 2016 )]. 
Voclosporin (LX214) is a novel next generation CNI that is currently being evaluated for a 
variety of systemic and topical indications. Voclosporin is structurally similar to cyclosporine 
A (CsA), except for a novel modification of a functional group on the amino acid-1 residue of 
the molecule. This alteration has changed how voclosporin binds  to calcineur in leading to an 
improved potency when compared to CsA. This modification has also changed the metabolic profile of voclosporin by shifting metabolism away from amino acid-1, which is the major site 
of metabolism for CsA. The altered metabolic profile has led to a faster elimination of metabolites resulting in lower metabolite exposure compared to CsA. The combination of 
increased potency and decreased metabolite exposure, for voclosporin compared to CsA, has 
led to better pharmacokinetic/pharm acodynamic predictability.  
1.1 Nonclinical Studies of Voclosporin in  Dry Eye  
Two Good Laboratory Practice  (GCP) toxicology studies  [(S07654 2009, S07655 2009)] have 
been conducted to evaluate the safety of voclosporin ophthalmic solution (VOS) in the eye of 
the New Zealand Whit e (NZW) rabbit and the Beagle dog with dosing for 14 days. Test 
animals were euthanized on Day 15, and recovery animals were sacrificed on Day 29. Animals received two, four, or eight bilateral topical applications of 0.2% VOS within 8 hours daily, 
corresp onding to doses of approximately 0.14, 0.28, and 0.56 mg/eye/day, respectively. 
Control animals received 8 doses of the vehicle within 8 hours daily. Safety was evaluated using macroscopic and microscopic ophthalmologic evaluations;  tonometry; 
electroretin ography (ERG) evaluation; gross and microscopic pathology of the eyes (including 
optic nerve), submandibular lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus ; and hematology, blood 
chemistry, and coagulation parameters. Blood voclosporin concentrations were obtained on Days 1 and 13 at pre-dose and  8, 8.5, 10, and 12 hours after the first VOS instillation.  
In the NZW rabbit study, no VOS ocular treatment -related changes in serum chemistry, 
hematology, coagulation, gross pathology, or organ weights were found at the completion of 
the dosing period or following a 14- day recovery (without treatment). Similarly, no 
treatment -related macroscopic or microscopic ophthalmological changes or effects on 
intraocular pressure associated with the administration of VOS were reported. There were no histologic findings in the spleen, thymus, or rostral and caudal sections of the mandibular 
lymph nodes. A standard battery of bil ateral full -field flash ERGs was performed; sporadic 
statistically significant differences were seen, but as these were all limited to one eye, were not dose- dependent, and were not supported by corresponding changes in related ERG parameters 
(for example,  a change in a- wave implicit time was not accompanied by a change in a- wave 
 
AUDREY (AUR -VOS -2019- 01) Protocol, Final Version 1.0 Confidential  
26 July 2019  Page 19 of 73 amplitude), they were judged to have no significance. The ocular no observed adverse effect  
level (NOAEL) for VOS in NZW rabbits was determined to be 0.56 mg/eye/day. There was 
some accumulation of voclosporin in blood over the course of the study, with mean trough 
levels on Day 13 of 0.028, 0.154, and 0.325 ng/mL for the low, mid, and high dose groups, respectively. The mean maximum blood concentration achieved 1 hour after dosing (high dose 
group) was 2.29 ng/mL on Day 13. 
In the Beagle dog study, similar results were reported for all safety parameters. The ocular 
NOAEL for VOS in Beagle dogs was determined to be 0.56 mg/eye/day. There was some 
accumulation of voclosporin in blood over the course of the study, with mean trough levels on 
Day 13 of 0.017, 0.173, and 0.297 ng/mL for the low, mid, and high dose groups, respectively. 
The mean maximum blood concentration achieved 1 hour after dosing (high dose group) was 
1.178 ng/mL on Day 13. 
In an additional 13- week NZW rabbit study [( S08661 2009) ] no mortality, systemic toxicity , 
or effects on specific ocular indices were observed following daily bilateral topical ocular 
administration of placebo or VOS (0.2% voclosporin) at a frequency of up to eight times daily 
(hourly intervals; ~0.56 mg/eye/day) for 13 weeks or following a 4 -week recovery period. The 
NOAEL for repeat topical ocular admin istration of VOS (0.2% voclosporin) to male and 
female NZW rabbits for 13 weeks was  >0.56 mg/eye/day.  
In summary, the two repeated -dose ocular toxicology studies  [(S07654 2009, S07655 2009)] 
demonstrated that there were no specific ocular indices or histopathology, and no systemic 
toxicity observed in either dogs or rabbits with 14 days of dosing. In addition, there was no mortality, systemic toxicity , or effects on specific ocular indices observed following daily 
bilateral topical ocular administration of placebo or VOS (0.2% voclosporin) at a frequency of up to eight times daily (hourly intervals; ~0.56 mg/eye/day) for 13 weeks or following a 4- week 
recovery period in rabbits. 
In addition to the three repeated dose toxicology studies, the efficacy and safety of VOS 0.2% 
has been evaluated in dogs with naturally occurring KCS  [(S15389- 00 2017)] , diagnosed by 
the Schirmer Tear Test ( STT) of >1 mm/min and <8 mm/min in one or both eyes (OU). Thirty-
five dogs ≥6 months old were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive either VOS (n=25) 
or Optimmune
® Ophthalmic Ointment (n=10) for 28 days BID. Results showed that treatment 
with VOS resulted in a statistically significant within -group increase in mean STT from 
baseline of 4.6 mm/min to each post -treatment visit. Qualitatively, this increase in magnitude 
was higher than seen in the concurrent Optimmune control group. For the Optimmune group, the change from baseline to Visit 2, 3, and 4, respectively, was not statistically significant, 
whereas for the VOS -treated group, each change from baseline was statistically significant 
(p<0.0001), demonstrating that VOS was effective in treating KCS in dogs. 
In order to determine potential melanin binding of  
14C-LX214 (pre-clinical drug product 
formulation) , ocular tissue 14C-LX214- derived radioactivity concentrations were compared 
 
AUDREY (AUR -VOS -2019- 01) Protocol, Final Version 1.0 Confidential  
26 July 2019  Page 20 of 73 between data obtained from albino NZW rabbits  [(S08661 2009)] given a single bilateral 
instillation in a separate study and similarly treated pigmented Dutch -Belted rabbits  (S08662 
2009) . Ocular pigments in Dutch- Belted rabbits are widely spread in multiple structures 
including iris (stroma and epithelium), ciliary body (stroma and one epithelial layer), choroid 
(stroma), retina (epithelium), eyelids , and conjunctiva. The total radioactivity in these ocular 
tissues of Dutch- Belted rabbits was not statistically significantly different from NZW rabbits 
at the six sampling time points. Therefore, there was no evidence of melanin binding of 14C-
LX214 after a single ocular administration. These data were confirmed in an in vitro model.  
1.2 Clinical Studies of Voclosporin in  Dry Eye  
Voclosporin ophthalmic solution has been investigated in one Phase 1 dose -escalation study 
(LX214- 01) in 30 healthy volunteers, followed by an open- label evaluation of VOS in five 
subjects with mild to moderate DE S. In this study, both 0.02% and 0.2% concentrations were 
found to be safe and well tolerated following multiple instillations in healthy subjects. All 
adverse events (AEs) across study cohorts were mild or moderate in severity and all resolved 
completely, most without requiring treatment. Although the sample size was small, results 
from the five subjects with DE S suggested VOS may be beneficial in the treatment of DE S 
and is supported by the Ocular Surface D isease Index scores, which were improved in all 
subjects at all time points  while on study drug. Overall, the results indicated VOS can be used 
safely when administered BID for two weeks [( LX214-01 2009)]. 
Additionally, one Phase 2, Investigator-masked, randomized, parallel -group s tudy was 
conducted in 100 subjects with DE S at 7 treatment sites to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability of VOS compa red to Restasi s [(AUR -VOS -2017- 01 2019 )]. Res ults of  this study 
indicated that VOS was well tolerated at doses up to 0.2% w/v OU, BID for up to 28 days. 
Clinically relevant and statistically superior treatment effects were observed in favor of VOS 
at most time points for the standard signs of DES, namely change from baseline in STT and 
fluorescein corneal staining ( FCS). After 2 weeks of treatment, a benefit of treatment with 
VOS compared with Restasis was observed in these objective signs of DES. This potentially 
indicates a more rapid onset of action and be neficial anti -inflammatory effect for VOS . 
Pre-specified exploratory efficacy analyses also favored VOS, which demonstrated a 
statistically significant difference in the number of subjects achieving a ≥ 10 mm improvement 
in STT at Week 4 in the VOS group (42.9%) compared with the Restasis group (18.4% ) 
(OR=4.40; 95% CI: 1.55, 12.51; p=0.0055).  
There were marked improvements from baseline in symptom severity at Week 1 with sustained 
improvements at Week 4 in both treatment groups, though there were no statis tically 
significant differences between treatment groups. 
Voclosporin ophthalmic solution was well -tolerated over a 4 -week treatment period , and no 
new or unexpected safety signals were observed with the use of VOS in DES , though more 
 
AUDREY (AUR -VOS -2019- 01) Protocol, Final Version 1.0 Confidential  
26 July 2019  Page 21 of 73 AEs were reported in the VOS group. The overall safety profile was consistent with the 
expectations for the class of drug, the patient population, and concomitant therapies. These 
data demonstrated the positive benefit/risk profile for VOS and support the choice of 
proceeding with a dose -ranging clinical study to further explore safety and efficacy over a 
longer duration [( AUR -VOS -2017-01 2019)]. 
1.3 Study  Rationale  
These results from the AUR -VOS -2017- 01 study support the conduct of this dose -ranging 
clinical study (AUR -VOS -2019-01, AUrinia DRy EYe ( AUDREY )) to explore safety and 
efficacy over a longer duration. P lease refer to Section 1.2 of the Investigator ’s Brochu re (IB)  
[(VOS -Investigator's-Brochure  2019)] for additional details  supporting the safety and efficacy 
of VOS in subj ects with DE S.

AUDREY (AUR -VOS -2019- 01) Protocol, Final Version 1.0 Confidential  
26 July 2019  Page 23 of 73 3. CLINICAL HYPOTHESIS  
The clinical hypothesis for this study is  that at least one of three concentrations of VOS ( 0.05%, 
0.10%, and 0.20 %) when administered OU BID  over 4 weeks is significantly different 
compared to vehicle alone for the following DES sign improvement:  
• Proportion of subjects with a ≥10 mm increase from baseline in STT at Week 4 in the study 
eye

This is a Phase 2/3, multi- center, randomized, double -masked, vehicle -controlled study to 
assess the efficacy and safety of three di fferent concentrations  of VOS when administered OU 
BID over 12 weeks  in subjects with mild to moderate DES.  A 14- to 17- day run-in period with 
VOS vehicle will be  included. Subjects will undergo a 2- week run- in period in which VOS 
vehicle will be self -administered O U, BID.  Subjects will be re -assessed to confirm that all 
participants meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. It is estimated 
the study will enroll approximately 480 subjects across approximately 9 study centers. Eligible 
subjects  will be randomized  in a 1:1:1:1 ratio  to one of the following study treatment arms  after 
the 14- to 17-day run-in period:

not using a medically acceptable form of birth control. All women of child-bearing potential must be willing to take a urine pregnancy test at Visit 1 and Visit 6. Details 
surrounding adequate forms of contraception are outlined in Section 5.6. 
12. Have a condition or  be in a situation that  the Investigator feels may put the subject at 
significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere significantly with the 
subject’s participation in the study. 
5.5 Withdrawal Criteria  
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from study participation at any time for any reason. Alternatively, subjects may be withdrawn at the Investigator ’s discretion if it is in the subject’s 
best interest.  
Every effort should be made for subjects who withdraw from the study ( either  voluntarily or 
at the Investigator ’s discretion ) to undergo end-of- study assessments (Visit 6). If possible, the 
subject should also be advised to come  into the site  for the Follow -Up Visit (Visit 7), 7 days  
(±3 days)  after self -instilling the final dose. If a subject refuses end -of-study procedures, the 
reason for refusal should be fully documented in the subject’s source document. It is the 
subject’s right to withdraw from the study without providing a reason. In this case, the sour ce 
 
AUDREY (AUR -VOS -2019- 01) Protocol, Final Version 1.0 Confidential  
26 July 2019  Page 32 of 73 documents and the electronic case report form ( eCRF ) should document the reason for 
discontinuation as “withdrawal of consent.” Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced. 
5.6 Aurinia  Adequate/Effective Contraception  
An adult woman is considered to be of childbearing potential unless she is at least 1 year 
post- menopausal or 3 months post -surgical sterilization. All women of child- bearing potential  
must have a negative urine pregnancy test result at Visit 1  and must not intend to become 
pregnant during the study. Women of child bearing potential  who are not abstinent must have 
been using one of the following acceptable methods of birth control for the times specified:  
1. Intrauterine device in place for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 through Visit 7 
2. Barrier method (condom or diaphragm) with spermicide from  Visit 1  through Visit 7. 
3. Stable hormonal contraceptive for at least 60 days prior to Visit 1 through Visit 7.In a 
monogamous relationship with a surgically steriliz ed (i.e., vasectomized) partner at 
least 6 months prior to Visit 1 through Visit 7.

7.1 Randomization  
All subjects enrolled must be identifiable throughout the study. The Investigator will maintain 
a list of subject numbers and subject names to enable records to be found at a later stage.  
Subjects will be allocated a subject number at screening visit (Visi t 1) and registered with an 
interactive web  randomization system  (IWRS) . Subjects meeting the required eligibility 
criteria will be randomized to treatment at Visit 2 (baseline). The randomization will be 
stratified by Eye Dryness score (<60  mm and ≥60 mm) . The subjects will be randomized in a  
ratio 1:1:1:1 to receive either VOS vehicle, VOS 0.05%, VOS 0.10% , or VOS 0.20%. The 
randomization ratio will be maintained within each study center. A  randomization list will be 
generated and provided by an  unmasked statistician.  
7.2 Masking  
All study personnel and subjects will be masked to the study treatment administered during the 
study. VOS vehicle, 0.05% VOS, 0.10% VOS , and 0.20% VOS will be identical in appearance. 
The treatment gr oup allocated will not b e available to  the study monitor , project statistician , or 
the project team at Aurinia Pharmaceuticals or  the CRO . The site staff, monitors, and study 
subjects will remain masked until the end of the study. In case of emergency, the unmasking 
process below should be followed.  
7.3 Unmasking  
In the rare event that an AE or pregnancy occurs for which knowledge of the identity of the 
study treatment administered is necessary to manage the subject’s condition, the IWRS code 
for that subject maybe broken and the test substance identified. Procedures for unmasking will 
be provided in a separate manual. 
Should unmasking be required, the Investigator should call Medical Monitor before  unmasking 
whenever possible ; however, the Investigator is responsible for the medical care of the 
individual study subject and does not require the agreement of the Medical Monitor  before 
unmasking. In the event that the Medical Monitor cannot be reached, the Investigator should 
contact the Project Manager at  the CRO . The reason for unmasking must be documented. The 
information on study treatment should only be used for decision making in the subject’s further 
treatment. Details on un masked treatment assignments should not be shared with the Study 
Monitor and project team.  Unmasked subjects will be discontinued from the study.

AUDREY (AUR -VOS -2019- 01) Protocol, Final Version 1.0 Confidential  
26 July 2019  Page 37 of 73 also based on nonclinical and clinical studies and on the immunosuppressive mechanism of 
action of the drug. 
8.1.3 Instructions for Use and Administration 
• At the end of Visit 1, qualified subjects will receive a kit with run -in (vehicle ophthalmic 
solution) for OU, BID dosing until Visit 2. Subjects will be instructed to dose in the 
morning and evening. One drop of t he IP will be instilled  in each eye BID. Subjects will 
be instructed to bring all used and unused IP to every clinic visit to conduct accountability. 
• At Visit 2, the run -in kit will be collected from subjects for drug accountability. At the end 
of Visit 2, qualified subjects will be randomized using the IWRS and dispens ed a kit 
containing either VOS 0.05%, VOS 0.10%, VOS 0.20%, or vehicle  for BID dosin g until 
Visit 3 . Subjects will be instructed not to take the morning dose of run- in on the day of 
study randomization (Visit 2). Instructions regarding timing between doses will remain 
identical to instructions given for the run- in period at Visit 1.  
• At Vi sit 3, the study drug kit  will be collected from subjects for drug accountability. 
Subjects will receiv e a new kit of study drug assigned via the IWRS (with the same 
treatment assignment that they were randomized to at Visit 2) for BID dosing until Visit 4. 
• At Visit 4, the study drug kit will be collected from subjects for drug acc ountability. 
Subjects will be dispensed two new kit s of study drug assigned via the IWRS (with the 
same treatment assignment that they were randomized to at Visit 2) for BID dosing until 
Visit 5.  
• At Visit 5, the study drug kit s will be collected from subjects for drug accountability. 
Subjects will be dispensed two new kit s of study drug assigned via the IWRS (with the 
same treatment assignment that they were randomized to at Visit 2) for BID dosing until 
Visit 6.  
• At Visits 6 , the study drug kit s and any leftover IP not previously returned to clinic will be 
collected from subjects for drug accountability.  
• Subjects will be instructed not to take their morning dose of run- in or study drug on the 
day of follow -up visits (Visits 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) prior to the visit . Subjects will be instructed 
to store study drug at home under refrigeration at 2°C- 8°C (36-46°F ) in the kit box.

9.4 Compliance with Protoco l 
Subjects will be instructed on proper instillation and storage of study drug at the end of Visits  1 
through 5 and given written instructions. The subject’s used and unused study drug ampules 
will be collected at each visit from Vis it 2 up to and including Visit 6 to assess dosing 
compliance. Dosing compliance will be based on the unused ampule count. If the subject is 
<80% or >120% compliant with dosing based on the expected number of unused ampules, then 
the subject will be deemed non- compliant and a dosing deviation should be recorded at each 
visit.  
These guidelines will be used by the Investigator for determining the subject’s necessary 
compliance for the study and for recording deviations from this compliance. 
9.5 Subject Disposition  
9.5.1 Completed Subjects  
A completed subject is one who has not been discontinued from the study.

Note: In addition, any subject may be discontinued for any sound medical reason at the 
discretion of the Investigator. 
Notification of a subject discontinuation and the reason for discontinuation will be made to the 
CRO  and/or Aurinia and will be clearly documented on the eCRF. Discontinued subjects will 
not be replaced. 
9.6 Study Termination  
The study may be stopped at any time by the Investigator, Aurinia , and/or the CRO  with 
appropriate notification. 
9.7 Study Duration  
An individual subject’s participation will involve 7 visits over approximately 15 weeks 
(approximately 105 days) from first day of s creening phase, the run-i n period, t reatment phase, 
and follow-up period. 
9.8 Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
During the course  of the study a  monitor, or designee, will make routine site visits to review 
protocol compliance, assess study drug accountability, and ensure the study is being conducted 
according to the protocol and pertinent regulatory requirements. The review of the subjects’ medical records will be performed in a manner that adequately maintains subject 
confidentiality. Further details of the study monitoring will be outlined in a monitoring plan. 
Regulatory authorities of domestic and foreign agencies, quality assur ance and /or their 
designees may carry out on- site inspections and/or audits , which may include source data 
checks. Therefore,  direct access to the original source data will be required for inspections 
and/or audits. All inspections and audits will be carried out giving consideration to data 
protection as well as subject confidentiality to the extent that local, state, and federal laws apply.

SAE S 
10.1 Definitions  
10.1.1  Adverse Event 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and 
which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment is an AE. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease t emporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. 
10.1.2  Adverse Drug Reaction 
In the pre -approval clinical experience with a new medical product or its new usages, 
particularly as the therapeutic dose(s) may not be established, all unintended responses to a 
medicinal product related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reac tions (ADRs). 
The phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility ( i.e., the relationship cannot 
be ruled out). 
10.1.3  Unexpected ADR 
An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., IB for an unapproved investigational medicinal product).  
10.1.4  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An SAE is an untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets one or more of the following 
criteria:  
• Results in death (Note: death is an outcome, not an event) 
• Is life -threatening (Note: the term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the subject 
was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that 
could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more severe) 
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
• Is a medically important event or reaction

26 July 2019  Page 48 of 73 The definitions and reporting requirements of International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) 
Guidelines for Clinical Safety Data Management, Definitions, and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting, Topic E2 will be adhered to. 
Medical and scientific judgment must be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These will also usually be considered serious. 
Hospitalizations for elective or previously scheduled surgery for pre -exist ing conditions, 
which have not worsened after initiation of treatment, will not be classed as SAEs. Previously 
scheduled hospitalizations must be documented in the subject’s source documents before the 
subject signed the ICF.  
10.1.5  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) 
Any ADR that is both serious and unexpected (per the IB) that, based on the opinion of the 
Investigator or Aurinia, is felt to have a reasonable suspected causal relationship to a medicinal 
product is a SUSAR. 
10.1.6  Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) 
Any AE  with an onset date  between the first dose of randomized study treatment and the last 
study visit (Post- Treatment Safety Follow -Up Visit 7  or last visit attended by the subject ). 
10.2 Adverse Event Descriptors  
10.2.1  Intensity/Severity Categorization 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); however, the event itself may be of relatively 
minor medical significance (such as severe headache). T his is not the same as “serious,” which 
is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations. 
In general, the intensity of a particular AE to be recorded is the worst intensity experienced by 
the subject during the course of the event. The medical assessment of intensity will be 
determined by using the following definitions: 
• Mild:  The AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with usual activity. 
• Moderate:  The AE interferes with daily activity, but the subject is still able to function.  
 
AUDREY (AUR -VOS -2019- 01) Protocol, Final Version 1.0 Confidential  
26 July 2019  Page 49 of 73 • Severe:   The AE is incapacitating, and the subject is unable to work or complete usual 
activity . 
10.2.2  Causal Relationship Categorization 
The Investigator will be required to assess the relationship to study treatment (defined as 
vehicle for run- in period and active drug/vehicle for randomized subjects) for each AE as 
related or not related, in addition to the relationship to disease under study (see  Section  10.2.4). 
An AE will not be able to be assessed as related to both disease under study and related to 
study treatment.  
An Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to 
the study treatment and disease under study for each AE and SAE. The Investigator must 
decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, t here is a reasonable possibility that the event 
may have been caused by the study treatment. If there is no valid reason for suggesting a 
relationship, then the AE/SAE must be classified as not related. Otherwise, if there is any valid 
reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting a cause and effect relationship 
between the study treatment and the occurrence of the AE/SAE, then the AE/SAE will be 
considered related. For SAEs, the Investigator must provide a brief comment explaining the 
rationale of his/her assessment of causal relationship on the SAE reporting form. 
The following additional guidance may be helpful: 
Term  Relationship  Definition  
Related  Yes The temporal relationship of the clinical event to study drug administration 
indicates a causal relationship , and other drugs, therapeutic interventions or 
underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed 
event.  
Not related  No The temporal relationship of the clinical event to  study drug administration does 
not indicate a causal relationship , or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or 
underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
 
If the causal relationship between an AE/SAE and the study treatment is determined to be 
“related”, the event will be considered to be related to study treatment for the purposes of 
expedited regulatory reporting. In circumstances where the Investigator ha s not yet provided 
his/her assessment about the relationship, the event will be considered as “related” and qualify for expedited regulatory reporting.  
10.2.3  Outcome Categorization 
Outcome may be classified as recovered without sequelae; recovered with sequelae;  improved; 
worsened; ongoing; fatal; or unknown. If the outcome is reported as recovered with sequelae for an SAE, the Investigator should specify the kind of sequelae on the paper SAE Reporting 
Form .  
 
AUDREY (AUR -VOS -2019- 01) Protocol, Final Version 1.0 Confidential  
26 July 2019  Page 50 of 73 10.2.4  Symptoms of the Disease Under Study 
Symptoms related to DES will not be classified as AEs as long as they are within the normal 
day-to-day fluctuation of the disease. An explanation of these circumstances must be written 
in the source documents. 
Worsening of the symptoms, however, will be recorded as an AE and clearly marked as 
worsening or by the subject’s worst observed intensity.  
10.2.5  Adverse Events of Special Interest including Abuse, Misuse, Overdose and 
Medication Errors 
A clinically significant decrease in visual acuity (defined as an increase of ≥ 0.22 in l ogMAR 
score) from baseline (Visit 1) will be considered an AE of special interest and must be 
documented in the  AE section of the  subject’s eCRF and source documentation. If the AE 
fulfils any seriousness criteria, the event must be reported on a paper SAE  Reporting Form and 
documented as serious in the AE section of the subject’s eCRF and source documentation. 
Special situations including treatment abuse, misuse, overdose and medication errors causing 
or with the potential to cause harm should be reported as an AE. An event that fulfills the 
seriousness criteria should be reported as a SAE. 
10.3 Reporting Procedure for AEs, SAEs, and Pregnancy  
10.3.1  Adverse Events 
All AEs, regardless of causality, will be reported from time of signing the ICF until Post -
Treatment Safety Follow -Up Visit 7 and recorded in the subject's source documentation. This 
applies to all AEs regardless of presumed relationship to the study drug.  
For screen failure subjects  prior to run- in period , any AEs occurring during the screening 
period will be recorded from the time of signing the ICF  in the subject’s source documentation 
only and will not be collected on the eCRF.  
For subjects qualifying for the run-in period all AEs will be recorded  in the AE section of the 
subject’s eCRF and source documentation. This applies to all run- in period events  between 
Visit 1 and Visit 2 whether the subject is subsequently randomized or not.  
For enrolled/randomized subjects, any AEs occurring following first d ose of randomized study 
treatment  and up to Post -Treatment Safety Follow -Up Visit 7 will be recorded in the AE 
section of the subject’s eCRF and source documentation. 
If any AE is reported, the date of onset, relationship to study treatment, relationship t o disease 
under study, any action taken, date of resolution (or the fact that it is still continuing or has 
become chronic), outcome, and whether the AE is serious or not, will be recorded. Use of 
colloquialisms and abbreviations should be avoided. Only one AE term should be recorded in 
 
AUDREY (AUR -VOS -2019- 01) Protocol, Final Version 1.0 Confidential  
26 July 2019  Page 51 of 73 the event field on the AE eCRF. Where possible, the Investigator should report a diagnosis 
rather than signs and symptoms or abnormal laboratory values. However, if a constellation of 
signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at 
the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the AE eCRF. If a diagnosis 
is subsequently established, all previously reported AEs based on signs and symptoms should 
be nullified by the Investigator and replaced by one AE report based on the single diagnosis, 
with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 
Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug must be collect ed. 
Any AEs with an onset date during the study with follow -up/updated outcomes after the last 
study visit (or last study treatment administration) will be recorded as “ongoing” in the eCRF 
at the time of study completion. Adverse events persisting at the time of study completion will 
be followed by the Investigator through contact with the subject until resolution or stabilization 
has occurred (or the subject is lost to follow -up and cannot be contacted) and recorded in the 
source documentation only. If th e subject reports an AE, it is the Investigator ’s responsibility 
to acquire sufficient information in order to assess causality. This may require additional laboratory testing, physical examinations, telephone contacts, etc. In circumstances where the 
Investigator  is unable to contact with the subject, the Investigator must provide a written 
statement to Aurinia confirming that the subject is lost to follow -up. 
In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked a non- leading question, such 
as “How are you feeling?” It is also important to question the subject in a non- leading way 
about changes in their health or concomitant medication usage since their last visit. In addition, 
any symptoms/conditions reported during assessments and deemed to b e clinically significant 
by the Investigator will be considered AEs. 
10.3.2  Serious Adverse Events 
For screen failure subjects  prior to run- in period, any SAEs occurring during the screening 
period (after informed consent) will be recorded on a paper SAE Reporting Form and in the  
subject’s source documentation only and will not be collected on the eCRF.  
For subjects qualifying for the run- in period, all SAEs will be recorded on the paper SAE 
Reporting Form, in the AE section of the subject’s eCRF and source documentation. This 
applies to all run -in period events whether the subject is subsequently randomized or not.  
For enrolled/randomized subjects, any S AEs occurring following first dose of randomized 
study treatment  and up to Post -Treatment Safety Follow -Up Visit 7 will be recorded on the 
paper SAE Reporting Form, in the AE section of the subject’s eCRF and source documentation. 
All SAEs, regardless of causality, will be reported to the Clinical Project Manager and Medical 
Monitor on a paper SAE Reporting Form within 24 hours of the Investigator , designee, or site 
staff’s knowledge of the event. 
 
AUDREY (AUR -VOS -2019- 01) Protocol, Final Version 1.0 Confidential  
26 July 2019  Page 52 of 73 Note that data collection within the electronic data capture ( EDC ) system (Subject eCRF) is 
considered complete at the time of the last study visit according to the protocol schedule of 
assessments. Any S AEs with an onset date during the study with follow- up/updated outcomes  
post the last study visit (or last study treatment administration) will be recorded as “ongoing” 
in the eCRF at the time of study completion . For SAEs, the follow -up/resolution will be 
recorded on a paper SAE Reporting Form, and source documentation. If the Investigator has 
not seen the subject at a clinic visit at the end of the reporting period, the Investigator must 
make reasonable efforts to contact the subject to inquire about SAEs. 
A paper SAE Reporting Form will be available for s ite staff to complete. The Investigator must 
complete, sign, and date the SAE form and verify the accuracy of the information recorded on 
the form with the corresponding source documents . The required contact information for 
reporting SAEs will be provided in the safety manual : 
• Site Staff will contact the Clinical Project Manager (CPM) at the CRO to notify them of 
an SAE via phone or email as soon as the site becomes aware of the event.  
• Site staff will complete a paper SAE Reporting Form and email to the CP M at the CRO 
and the Medical Monitor within 24 hours.  
• If email is unavailable, site staff will call  the CPM at the CRO and Medical Monitor within 
24 hours.  
The Investigator is encouraged to discuss with the study Medical Monitor when the issue of 
seriousness is unclear or questionable. 
In addition to assessing the relationship to study treatment, t he Investigator will also be 
required to assess the relationship to the disease under study for each SAE as related or not 
related. An SAE will not be able to b e assessed as related to both disease under study and 
related to study treatment.  All recorded SAEs, regardless of relationship to study treatment or relationship to disease 
under study, will be followed up until resolution, stabilization, or the subject is lost to follow 
up and cannot be contacted. In circumstances where the Investigator is unable to make contact 
with the subject, the Investigator must provide a written statement to Aurinia confirming that 
the subject is lost to follow -up. 
If the subject died, the paper SAE Reporting Form should include the cause of death as the event term and whether or not the death was related or unrelated to study treatment or disease 
under study, as well as the autopsy findings, if available. Preliminary reports will be followed 
by detailed descriptions , which will include copies of hospital case reports, autopsy 
reports/certificates , and other documents when requested and applicable. 
 
AUDREY (AUR -VOS -2019- 01) Protocol, Final Version 1.0 Confidential  
26 July 2019  Page 53 of 73 Any SAE considered to have a causal relationship (i.e., “related”) to the study treat ment and 
discovered by the Investigator at any time after the study will be reported on a paper SAE 
Reporting Form and documented in the safety database only. A rationale for the assessment of 
a causal relationship must be provided by the Investigator.  
Additional follow -up information must be reported to the CRO on a paper SAE Reporting 
Form, and the AE section of the subject’s eCRF updated (until last study visit, see procedures 
described above ), within 24 hours of awareness following Investigator (or site) awareness of 
the information. The Investigator should not delay reporting an SAE in order to obtain 
additional information. Additional information, when available, should be reported to the CR O 
by the reporting procedures described above. 
An Investigator who receives an Investigational New Drug ( IND) Safety Report describing an 
SAE or other specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAE) from Aurinia  will 
file it along with the IB  and will notify the IRB/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) if 
appropriate, according to local requirements. Aurinia or its representative will be responsible for determining and, in turn, reporting SAEs 
to Regulatory Authorities according to the applicable regulatory requirements. 
10.3.3  Pregnancy 
All pregnancies will be reported from time of signing the ICF until Post -Treatment Safety 
Follow- Up Visit 7 . Pregnancies will be recorded in the subject's source documentation and 
must be reported to the CRO by the reporting procedures described below . 
Pregnancy occurring in a female subject should be reported to the CRO Pharmacovigilance 
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event using a paper Pregnancy Reporting Form. Site 
staff must also enter the available pregnancy in the AE section of the subject’s eCRF within 
24 hours of becoming aware of the event. 
The Investigator should counsel the subject  and discuss the risks of continuing with the 
pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. The  subject must immediate ly inform the 
Investigator if she becomes pregnant during the study. Monitoring of the pregnancy in the 
subject should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  Female subjects  who have a positive pregnancy test during the study will be withdrawn from 
the study treatment and the procedures for withdrawal will be completed. The Medical Monitor 
must be contacted immediately to break the blind (if applicable).  
The outcome of all such pregnancies (including normal births) should be followed up and documented, even if the subject was withdrawn from the study. Every effort should be made 
to gather information regarding the pregnancy outcome until 90 days (or otherwise as 
appropriate) post -partum. It will be the responsibility of Aurinia, together with the appropriate 
support of the Investigator, to obtain this information.

26 July 2019  Page 54 of 73 Complications of pregnancy such as abortion (spontaneous or induced), premature birth, or 
congenital abnormality are considered SAEs and should be reported following the report ing 
procedures as outlined in Section 10.3.2, Serious Adverse Events.  
A paper Pregnancy Reporting Form will be available for site staff to complete. The Investigato r 
must complete, sign , and date the SAE form and verify the accuracy of the information 
recorded  on the form with the corresponding source documents: 
• Site Staff will contact the Clinical Project Manager (CPM) at the CRO  to notify them of a 
Pregnancy via phone or email as soon as the site becomes aware of the event.

26 July 2019  Page 55 of 73 11. STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES AND METHODS OF ANALYSES  
11.1 Analysis Populations  
The following analysis populations will be considered: 
• Intent- to-Treat Population – The int ent-to-treat (ITT) population includes all randomized 
subjects. Subjects in the ITT population will be analyzed as randomized. 
• Per Protocol Population – The per protocol (PP) population includes subjects in the ITT 
population who do not have significant protocol deviations prior to their primary endpoint 
assessment at Week 4 and who complete  the Week 4 STT . Protocol deviations will be 
assessed prior to database lock and unmasking. The PP population will be analyzed as randomized. 
• Safety Population – The safety population includes all randomized subj ects who have 
received  at least one dose of randomized  study treatment. The safety population will be 
analyzed for all safety assessments. Subjects in the s afety population will be analyzed as 
treated.  
• The run-in population will be used to describe all subjects who entered the run-in period. 
Baseline data will be summarized using the safety, ITT , and PP populations. Safety data will 
be summarized using the safety population, and efficacy analysis will use the ITT and PP 
populations.  
11.2 Statistical Hypothesis  
The primary endpoint will be tested under the following hypotheses with statistical 
significance declared for any of the three  comparisons versus vehicle where a p- value <0.0166 
is observed: 
H01: There is no difference between the proportion of subjects with a ≥10 mm change 
from baseline in STT to Week 4 in the study eye for those receiving VOS (0.05%, 0.10%, or 0.20%) versus vehicle. 
H
11: There is a difference between the proportion of subjects with a ≥10 mm change 
from base line in STT to Week 4  in the study eye in for those receiving VOS (0.05%, 0.1%, or 
0.2%) versus vehicle. 
Following a significant result in the primary analysis the three pairwise comparisons for the 
key secondary endpoint will be tested using alpha=0.0166. The hypotheses to be tested are: 
 H 02: In subjects with baseline eye dryness VAS  ≥60 mm, there is no difference between 
the mean change from baseline to Week 4 in the Eye Dryness VAS for those receiving VOS 
(0.05%, 0.10%, or 0.20% ) versus vehicle.  
 
AUDREY (AUR -VOS -2019- 01) Protocol, Final Version 1.0 Confidential  
26 July 2019  Page 56 of 73 H12: In subjects with baseline eye dryness VAS ≥6 0 mm, there is a difference between 
the mean change from baseline to Week 4  in the eye dryness VAS for those receiving VOS 
(0.05%, 0.10%, or 0.20% ) versus vehicle.  
For significance to be declared in the key secondary endpoint analysis, the same treatment 
group should show improvement over vehicle in both the primary analysis and the key 
secondary analysis.  
11.3 Sample Size  
This study is expected to enroll 480 subjects into 4 treatment arms. A two -group continuity 
corrected Chi square test with a 0.0166 two-sided significance level (adjusted for three 
treatment comparisons versus  placebo) will have at least 80% power to detect the difference 
between a vehicle res ponse rate of 20% (defined as the percentage of subjects with a ≥ 10 mm 
increase in STT from baseline)  and a VOS response rate of 40% when the sample size in each 
group is 120 (total N=480). Response is defined as an increase of ≥ 10 mm  in STT from baseline  
to Week 4.  
While the effect of withdrawals will be investigated, subjects withdrawing prior to Week 4 STT assessment for any reason will be counted as non-responders in the primary analysis and therefore no adjustment of sample size for withdrawals is necessary.  
This sample size provides greater than 90% power t o detect a significant change from baseline 
within any one of the three active treatment groups in the Eye Dryness VAS assuming the 
standard deviation of changes is 40 mm and the mean change from baseline is 20 mm (two -
sided alpha=0.0166). 
The key secondar y endpoint is analyzed within the population of subjects with an Eye D ryness 
VAS ≥60 mm at baseline. It is expected that this will reduce the sample size for this analysis 
by 25% (from 120 per group to 90 per group). Assuming a standard deviation of 30 mm for 
change in eye dryness score and an improvement of any active arm compared to placebo 
(alpha=0.0166) of 15 mm, a sample size of 90 subjects per group provides at least 80% power 
to detect a significant difference. 
11.4 Statistical Analysis  
11.4.1  Unit of Analysis 
Safety endpoints will be analyzed for both eyes  using study eye and fellow eye  (non- study eye)  
if appropriate . For efficacy symptom -related endpoints, the unit of analysis is both eyes. For 
efficacy sign- related endpoints, the unit of analysis will be the study eye  as defined by the 
following: 
Study Eye: The study eye will be defined as the eye that achieves the lowest STT score at 
baseline (Visit 2) . Should a subject have identical STT scores in both eyes at baseline, the eye 
 
AUDREY (AUR -VOS -2019- 01) Protocol, Final Version 1.0 Confidential  
26 July 2019  Page 57 of 73 with the worst FCS sc ore will be used. Should these scores also be equal, the right eye will be 
used . 
11.4.2  Multiplicity Considerations 
To maintain an overall alpha of 0.05, statistical significance of the pairwise treatment 
comparisons will be declared at the 0.05/3=0.0166 level. 
11.4.3  Primary Efficacy Analyses 
Analysis of the  primary endpoint, proportion of subjects with ≥ 10 mm increase from baseline 
in STT at Week 4 in the study eye, will be conducted on the ITT  and PP  populations . The 
response rate for each VOS group compared to vehicle will be determined using a logistic 
regression model including terms for Investigator site, treatment group , and baseline STT. 
Results of this logistic regression will b e displayed as odds ratios and two- sided adjusted 95% 
confidence intervals ( CIs) (VOS compared to vehicle). The proportion of subjects exhibiting a 
response at Week 4 will be summarized by treatment group. 
Subjects providing in sufficient data to determine response at W eek 4 (e.g. early withdrawal)  
will be analysed as non-responders. An additional sensitivity analysis will analyse observed responses only. 
11.4.4  Key Secondary Endpoint Analysis 
The key secondary endpoint of mean change from baseline in Eye Dryness VAS in the subset 
of subject s with baseline Eye Dryness VAS  ≥60 mm will be analysed using the ITT and the 
PP populations . Mean change, along with an adjusted 95% CI and p -value, will be provided  
from a General Linear Model including terms for Investigator site, treatment group and 
baseline Eye Dryness VAS . 
Subjects not providing an Eye Dryness VAS at week 4 will not contribute to this analysis.  
11.4.5  Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
STT response at Weeks 2, 8 and 12 will be analysed in a similar fashion to the primary endpoint 
using the ITT population only. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints are measured as continuous data and will be summarized 
by visit using observed scores and change from baseline  using the ITT population. Mean 
changes along with 95% C Is and p- values will be provided both within treatment group and 
for all pairwise comparisons to vehicle.  
Mixed Effect Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) will also be used to analyze all available 
data for each  endpoint. The MMRM model will include terms for Investigator  site, treatment, 
visit, treatment by visit interaction and applicable baseline measure. Overall and by -visit 
 
AUDREY (AUR -VOS -2019- 01) Protocol, Final Version 1.0 Confidential  
26 July 2019  Page 58 of 73 results will be expressed as differences between treatment arms (VOS –vehicle) along with 
associated 95% CIs  and p- values . 
11.4.6  Safety Variables  
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. Frequencies and percentages of 
subjects with TEAEs, serious TEAEs, and TEAEs causing premature discontinuation will be 
provided by treatment group. An AE is treatment emergent if it occurs after the first dose of 
randomized study treatment and up to last study visit. Furthermore, frequencies will be given 
of subjects with TEAEs by system organ class and preferred term; by system organ class, 
preferred term and maximal severity; by system organ cla ss, preferred term for treatment -
related AEs; by system organ class and preferred term for SAEs; and by system organ class, preferred term, and day of onset. Separate analyses will be performed for ocular specific and 
all AEs (including systemic).  
Other sa fety endpoints including visual acuity, slit lamp biomicroscopy, dilated 
ophthalmoscopy ( fundoscopy), will be summarized by treatment group and visit using 
descriptive statistics. Changes or shifts from baseline will also be summarized where appropriate. M ean changes from baseline along with 95% C Is for changes and pairwise 
comparisons to vehicle will be calculated for visual acuity. For assessments performed by eye, study eye and fellow eye will be summarized separately. In addition, shifts from baseline t o 
worst on- treatment value for ocular safety assessments will be summarized.  
11.4.7  Interim Analyses 
No interim analyses are planned for this study

Each site should have a thermometer  in each storage location  that records minimum and 
maximum temperatures daily. Maintenance of a temperature log is mandatory. The log should 
be updated by site personnel during normal working hours. This log must be available for 
review by the Site Monitor during on- site monitoring visits.  
12.5.3  Accountability of Investigational Product 
The Investigator at each site is responsible for IP supplies. The Investigator will ensure that 
adequate records of the receipt, dispensing, and return of the IP are kept and that the IP is used 
only for subjects enrolled in the study. All data regarding the IP must be recorded on the 
relevant forms provided. 
Each study site will maintain a drug inventory/dispensing record for all IP dispensed and 
returned. At the end of the study, one copy of the drug inventory/dispensing record should be 
sent to Aurinia or their designee for the central study file. The original will be kept in the site 
files.  
12.5.4  Return or Disposal of Investigational Product 
After completion of the study, or if it is prematurely terminated , all IP will be returned to 
Aurinia or their designee. The return or disposal of IP will be specified in writing. 
12.6 Aurinia  Recording of Data on Source Documents and Case Reports 
Forms (CRFs)  
All subject data will be captured in the subject source documents , which will be transcribed in 
the eCRFs. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that study data are completely and 
accurately recorded on each subject’s eCRF, source documents, and all study- related materials. 
All study data should also be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original , accurate, and 
complete . Recorded datum should only be corrected in a manner that does not obliterate, 
destroy, or render illegible the previous entry ( i.e., by drawing a single line through the 
incorrect entry and writing the revision next to the corrected data). An individual who has 
corrected a data entry should make clear who made the correction and when, by adding to the 
correction his/her initials as well as the date of the correction.  
Data entry of all enrolled and randomized subjects will use software that conforms to 21 CFR 
Part 11 requirements, and will be performed only by staff who have been trained on the system 
and have access to the system. Data will not be entered for Visit 1 screen failure s with the 
exception of demographics and reason for screen failure . An audit trail will be maintained 
within the electronic system to capture all changes made within the eCRF database. After the 
 
AUDREY (AUR -VOS -2019- 01) Protocol, Final Version 1.0 Confidential

AUDREY (AUR -VOS -2019- 01) Protocol, Final Version 1.0 Confidential  
26 July 2019  Page 67 of 73 Appendix  2 : Examination Procedures, Tests, Equipment, and Techniques  
Visual Acuity Procedures (ETDRS Chart)  
LogMAR visual acuity (VA) must be assessed using an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy 
Study (ETDRS) chart. The procedure used will be consistent with the recommendations 
provided for using the ETDRS eye chart. VA should be evaluated at the beginning of each visit 
in the study ( i.e., prior to slit- lamp examination). VA testing should be done with most recent 
correction. 
Equipment  
The VA chart to be used is the ETDRS chart. If smaller reproduction (18"  by 18", i.e. , from 
Prevent Blindness) wall charts are used, the subject viewing distance should be exactly 10 feet 
(or as specified by the manufacturer). In ALL cases, for purposes of standardizing the testing 
conditions during the study, all sites must use only the 'R' charts, and the right eye should be 
tested first. For reflectance (wall) charts, the chart should be placed frontally and well -
illuminated.  
Measurement Techn ique 
The chart should be at a comfortable viewing angle. The right eye should be tested first. The subject should attempt to read each letter, line -by-line, left to right, beginning with line 1 at the 
top of the chart. The subject should be told that the chart has letters only, no numbers. If the subject reads a number, he or she should be reminded that the chart contains no numbers, and 
the examiner should then request a letter in lieu of the number. The subject should be asked to 
read slowly, so as to achieve the best identification of each letter. He/she is not to proceed to 
the next letter until he/she has given a definite response. 
If the subject changes a response ( i.e., 'that was a "C" not an "O"') before he has read aloud the 
next letter, then the change must be accepted. If the subject changes a response having read the 
next letter, then the change is not to be accepted. The examiner should never point to the chart 
or to specific letters on the chart during the test.  
A maximum effort should be made t o identify each letter on the chart. When the subject says 
he or she cannot read a letter, he or she should be encouraged to guess. If the subject identifies 
a letter as 1 of 2 letters, he or she should be asked to choose 1 letter and, if necessary, to gue ss. 
When it becomes evident that no further meaningful readings can be made, despite encouragement to read or guess, the examiner should stop the test for that eye. However, all 
letters on the last line should be attempted as letter difficulties vary and the last may be the 
only one read correctly. The number of letters missed or read incorrectly should be noted. 
 
AUDREY (AUR -VOS -2019- 01) Protocol, Final Version 1.0 Confidential  
26 July 2019  Page 68 of 73 LogMAR Visual Acuity Calculations 
The last line in which a letter is read correctly will be taken as the base logMAR reading. To 
this value will b e added the number "N x 0.02" where 'N' represents the total number of letters 
missed up to and included in the last line read. This total sum represents the logMAR VA for that eye.  
For Example: Subject correctly reads 4 of 5 letters on the 0.2 line, and 2 of 5 letters on the 0.1 line. 
Base logMAR  = 0.1 
N (total number of letters incorrect on line 0.2 as well as 0.1)  = 4 
N x T (T=0.02) = 0.08 
Base logMAR + (N x T)  = 0.1 + 0.08 
logMAR VA  = 0.18  
Repeat the procedure for the left eye.  
In order to provide standardized and well -controlled assessments of VA during the study, all 
VA assessments at a single site must be consistently done using the same lighting conditions 
and same correction if possible during the entire study. If the same correction cannot be used 
(ie, a subject forgets his glasses), the reason for the change in correction should be documented.  
Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)  
To provide standardized and well -controlled assessments of visual acuity during the study, 
consistently use the same lighting conditions during the entire study. 
Calculations  : logMAR VA = Baseline value + (n x 0.02) 
where:  the baseline value is the logMAR number of the last line read (at least 1 letter read 
correctly in this line), and  
“n” is t he total number of letters missed up to and including the last line read, and   
“0.02” is the value for each letter 
Slit Lamp Biomicroscopy Procedures  
Slit lamp biomicroscopic observations will be graded as Normal or Abnormal. Abnormal 
findings will be categorized as clinically significant (findings that may interfere with study 
parameters or otherwise confound the data as determined by the Investigator ) or not clinically 
significant (NCS). The following will be examined:

26 July 2019  Page 69 of 73 • Cornea  
• Conjunctiva 
• Anterio r Chamber  
• Iris 
• Lens  
• Eyelid  
External magnification and biomicroscopy will be performed using a slit -lamp. Magnification 
will be consistent with standard clinical practice. The subject will be seated.  
Dilated Ophthalmoscopy (Fundoscopy)  
Dilated fundoscopy will be performed using indirect ophthalmoscopy. The Investigator will 
make observations of the vitreous, retina, macula, choroid and optic nerve. 
Observations will be graded as Normal or Abnormal. Abnormal findings that are clinically 
significant (as determined by the Investigator that may interfere with study parameters or 
otherwise confound the data) and those that are not clinically significant will be described. A dilated fundoscopy examination should be performed if retinal disease is detected.  
• Vitreou s: Examination should emphasize the visual axis.  
• Retina, Macula, Choroid:  Include an observation of the retina and its blood vessels. Eyes 
should be excluded from the study if active inflammation is present.  
• Optic Nerve:  Significant damage or cupping to the optic nerve should be noted. 
It is recommended that tropicamide 1% ophthalmic solution be used to dilate subjects. The use 
of cyclopentolate 1% ophthalmic solution is recommended as secondary dilating medication, 
should the need arise. 
Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)  
Subjects will be asked the following questions regarding ocular discomfort (unrelated to study 
drug instillation) at all visits.  
The subject will be asked to rate each ocular symptom due to dry eye syndrome  by placing a 
vertical mark on the horizontal line to indicate the  current  level of discomfort. 0% corresponds 
to “no discomfort” and 100% corresponds to “maximal discomfort.” The linear dimension of the scale is measured in millimeters.  This assessment is a general assessment of both eyes . 
There will not be a question for each individual eye. This assessment sh ould be performed

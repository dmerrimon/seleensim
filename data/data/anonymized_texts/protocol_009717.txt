Seeking to expand on these learnings both in intervention design and associ ated 
outcomes, the  Pivot program is a novel digital health intervention for smoking cessation. 
Pivot comprises a multiphase mobile app, as well as the first Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) -cleared personal carbon monoxide (CO) breath sensor, and 
dedicated human coaching delivered through in -app text messaging. Pivot users may 
learn about and order NRT in the Pivot app and participate in the Pivot online 
community. Pivot is designed for individuals with varying levels of readiness to quit and 
is based on the USCPG  for toba cco cessation.   
In 2018, we reported results of a nine -day study of 41 participants using only the first 
phase of Pivot (which at the time was a six-phase program ), that included Pivot’s FDA -
cleared personal CO breath sensor  and dedicated one -on-one human coaching using an 
asynchronous text messaging interface .[12] The focus of the evaluated program phase 
was to encourage the participant to explore their smoking behavior.  Participants 
completed activities and had the opportunity to log cigarettes and to in teract with a coach 
via text message. More than 80% of participants (34 -39 of 41) took ≥1 CO breath sample 
each day, and more than 55% (23 -27 of 41) took ≥5 samples each day. All 9 in -app 
activities had completion rates ≥80% (33 -40 of 41). Response to coac h-initiated outreach 
was also high, with all contacts receiving ≥73% (30 -39 of 41) response. In matched pair 
analyses, significant positive changes in mean attitudes toward quitting (scale 1 -10) were 
evident from baseline (T1) to study exit (T2), including  increased readiness to quit (T1 
mean=6.1, T2 mean=7.4, P=.005), lower perceived difficulty  of staying quit  (T1 
mean=3.7, T2 mean=5.6, P=.001), and greater expectations of success (T1 mean=4.5, T2 
mean=6.5, P<.001). At exit, 78% (32/41) of participants rep orted decreasing the number 
of cigarettes smoked per day during the study. Participants rated program quality and 
satisfaction very high (mean ≥8 for all items).  
Thereafter, a  prospective cohort study evaluated outcomes in 319 adult smokers 
(intention to t reat or ITT cohort) who underwent the full Pivot program; 272 (85.3%) 
participants completed the end -of-Pivot questionnaire  (mean 4.1 months after enrollment)  
and 288 participants completed the final follow -up questionnaire  three months later 
(mean 7.2 mon ths after enrollment) .[13,14] The Pivot program included the Pivot CO 
breath sensor, smartphone app, and text -based human coaching . The study included 
individuals along the spectrum of readiness to quit; at study entry most (66.5%, 212/319) 
were not thinki ng of quitting smoking in the next 30 days. The study examined 
participant engagement, changes in attitudes toward quitting smoking, and changes in 
smoking behavior during , at the end , and three months after  active participation in the 
Pivot program. On av erage, participants had a mean of 12.4 (SD 7.1) weeks of active 
program engagement (defined as doing at least 1 of the following per week: completing a 
breath sample; logging a cigarette; starting or completing a daily activity, challenge or 
check -in; or m essaging one’s coach). Repeated measures linear mixed model analyses 
demonstrated positive changes in attitudes at the end of the pre -quit portion of the 
program, with increased confidence to quit (4.2 to 7.4, P<.001)  and decreased expected 
difficulty main taining quit (3.1 to 6.8, P<.001).  The quit attempt rate (i.e., those making 
≥1 quit attempt lasting ≥1 day) was 80.6% (232/288 , completer)  at final follow -up. At the 
end of Pivot, 7 -day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) rates were 32.0% (102/319, ITT) 
and 37.5% (102/272, completer)  which increased to 34.5% (113/319 , ITT ) and 39.2% 

Pivot Health Technologies  Inc.

 (113/288 , completer ), respectively, at final follow -up; 30-day PPA rates were 27.6% 
(88/319, ITT) and 32.4% (88/272, completer)  at the end of Pivot , which increased to 
31.3% (100/319 , ITT ) and 34.7% (100/288 , completer ), respectively , at final follow -up. 
Moreover, 30 -day PPA rates were comparable among those ready and not ready to quit in 
the next 30 days at baseline. Of those not achieving abstinence, 25.9% (44/170, 
completer ) achieved ≥50% reduction in cigarettes per day (CPD) at the end of the Pivot 
program.  
2.2 STUDY  RATIONALE  
While the aforementioned data is encouraging, there is an ongoing need to assess the 
performance of Pivot in the context of current standard smoking cess ation programs. 
Accordingly, the present pilot randomized controlled trial compares  user engagement and 
retention, change in attitudes towards quitting smoking, change in smoking behavior and 
participant feedback  in adult smokers randomized either to the P ivot (intervention) or 
QuitGuide  (control)  smoking cessation programs.  
  
 
2.3 POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
2.3.1 Known Potential Risks  
There are minimal  anticipated risks or harms to the participant .  One possible risk is 
breach of confidentiality should a data brea ch occur. Regarding the risk of breach of 
confidentiality, w e, the  study sponsor ( Pivot Health Technologies Inc., formerly Carrot 
Inc.) compl y with HIPAA and state this  risk in our privacy and terms of use on our 
website  regarding use of Pivot . As such , we adhere to HIPAA’s Breach Notification 
Rule should a data breach occur. We take careful measures to prevent a data breach 
including use of encryptions, secure connections, and limited access to data  (see 
section 10.1 “Data Collection and Confidentiality”) . The sponsor  uses appropriate 
safeguards and complies, where applicable, with 45 C.F.R. Part 164, Subpart C with 
respect to Electronic Protected Health Information, to prevent use or disclosure of 
Protected Health Information. Specifically, Pivot Health Te chnologies   Inc. has 
implemented the administrative, physical, and technical safeguards set forth in 45 
C.F.R. §§ 164.308, 164.310, and 164.312 that reasonably and appropriately protect the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of any Protected Heal th Information that it 
creates, receives, maintains, or transmits.  The QuitGuide app is maintained by the U.S. 
Government. It is protected by various provisions of Title 18, U.S. Code. The 
QuitGuide app notes, “NCI complies with requirements for privacy an d security 
established by the Office of Management and Budge t (OMB), Department of Health 
and Human Services (DHHS), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) .”  
Another possible risk is participant anxiety , which could be  related to using the Pivot 
Brea th Sensor  during the study, or completing biovalidation using the Pivot Breath 
Sensor on study videocalls . For regular use of the Pivot Breath Sensor during the 
study, w hile there are suggested breath sampling patterns provided with the breath 
sensor  packa ging, participants will ultimately sample at their discretion.  No medical 

Pivot Health Technologies  Inc.  
 Document No.   
 
 decisions are made based on study data.  For completing biovalidation, participants will 
be fully informed why the biovalidation is being performed, what it tests for, and they 
will b e asked on each applicable videocall if they feel comfortable proceeding with 
biovalidation. Participant compensation is not based on breath sampling frequency or 
results, or on biovalidation results.   
Finally, participants will have the option to select, order and use over -the-counter 
nicotine replacement therapy (NRT ). Participants are provided with on -label 
information about the NRT , and are required to acknowledge their standing relating to 
contraindications for NRT use before  being able to order the NR T. They then select, 
order and use the NRT as they would when purchasing  over-the-counter medications 
in everyday life . The NRT is provided free of charge to study participants who order it. 
Risks associated with NRT use are identified in the  labeling prov ided to study 
participants . 
2.3.2 Known Potential Benefits  
It is possible some participants will quit or reduce smoking . It is also possible that 
some participants  may experience an increased awareness of their smoking behavior , 
increased motivation to quit smoking, or learn  techniques that help them stay quit, or 
reduce or quit smoking in the future .  
2.3.3 Risk Benefit Assessment  
Given the non -invasive nature of Pivot a nd QuitGuide  and study  data collection, there 
are minimal  anticipated risks . These risks  relate to breach of confidentiality in the 
circumstance of a data breach, possible participant anxiety related to using the Pivot 
Breath Sensor or related to performin g biovalidation with the sensor during  videocalls,  
and possible side effects of the use of over -the-counter NRT if the participant chooses 
to use it . These risks have been mitigated to the extent possible through data protection 
measures , through enabling participants to ultimately decide if and when to do breath 
samples , through fully informing participants why the biovalidation is being don e, 
what it tests for  and asking if they would like to proceed with the testing on the  
applicable  videocalls , and thro ugh enabling participants to make an informed decision 
on if they will use NRT and which NRT they will use if they choose to use any at all . 
Breath samples , biovalidation, NRT selection and NRT use are at the participant’s 
discretion  and are not mandated . Indeed, no specific use of Pivot or QuitGuide  overall 
is required. Participants will have the remote support of study staff and customer 
support as they need over the course of the study. Participants  are not required  to 
change their smoking behavior. No medical decisions are made based on study data.  
3. OBJECTIVES  
We aim  to assess  participants’ use of Pivot  (which includes the Pivot Breath Sensor , Pivot 
Health Technologies  Inc.; Redwood City, CA, USA; 510(k) number: K171408 ) and 
QuitGuide . There will be a focus on assess ing use and engagement, changes in attitudes 
towards qu itting smoking and changes in smoking behavior over the course of  the 2-year 
study , as well as  participant feedback on the set -up, design, use experience, and impact of 
each program .

 months of the study . Use of any ordered NRT is at the participant’s discretion.  
5. CONTROL – QUITGUIDE  PLUS NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY  
5.1 QUITGUIDE  
QuitGuide is a product of Smokefree.gov —a smoking cessation resource created by the 
Tobacco Control Research Branch at the National Cancer Institute in collaboration with 
tobacco control professionals and smoking cessation experts and with input from ex -
smokers. A well -established smoking cessation  app, QuitGuide has been used in previous 
randomized controlled trials in which digital smoking cessation programs were 
compared. [10,11] The app focuses on helping users understand their smoking patterns 
and build the skills needed to become smoke -free.[15] QuitGuide helps users focus on 
motivations to quit; prepare to quit through developing a quit plan, identifying and 
planning how to address triggers for smoking, learning about FDA -approved smoking 
cessation medications, and identifying social support; quit smoking by teaching skills to 
address cravings; and stay quit by presenting tips and motivations to stay smoke -free and 
address slips if they occur.   
QuitGuide is used as the control for the fo llowing reasons: the content follows the 
USCPG, it is an app -based smoking cessation program thus avoiding confounding 
treatment content with treatment delivery modality, and the app is non -proprietary and is 
free to the public. The QuitGuide app is compat ible with iOS and Android phones. 
QuitGuide provides technical support to help users download and use the app 
through  smokefreeteam@icf.com . 
5.2 NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY  
Participants in the QuitGuide control arm may order FDA -cleared over -the-counter NRT 
online . Participants are provided with on -label information about the NRT,  must also 
acknowledge understanding of contraindications. They will then complete an online orde r 
form to order their desired NRT. They will be provided a link through which to order 
NRT. The NRT is free of charge to the participant. There is no out -of-pocket payment by 
the participant for the NRT. The types of NRT offered include nicotine patches  (7, 14 
and/or 21 mg) , nicotine gum  (2 or 4 mg), and nicotine lozenges  (2 or 4 mg)  
. Participants may order patches, gum or lozenges alone as mono -therapy, or they 
may order patches + gum or patches + lozenges  . Partic ipants may order 
NRT every 2 weeks for up to a 12 -week course of NRT  over the first 12 months of the 
study.  NRT arrives with written instructions/FDA -cleared labeling . 
6. INTERVENTION - PIVOT  
Pivot is a digital smoking cessation program that includes the Pivo t Breath Sensor  and Pivot app. 
In the Pivot app, users can order NRT and access text -based one -on-one coaching  and the 
moderated Pivot online community discussion foru m. Pivot is based on the USCPG for tobacco 
cessation and is designed as a 12 -month progra m. 
6.1 PIVOT BREATH SENSOR  
The Pivot  Breath Sensor  is part of the Pivot program  and comprises a personal mobile 

Pivot Health Technologies  Inc.  
 Document No.   
 
 breath sensor that measures the level of CO in exhaled breath and displays the exhaled 
breath CO value to the user directly on the device. When pair ed to the user’s smartphone, 
the user’s exhaled breath CO values also populate the Pivot app, where they can be 
accessed by the user. The breath sensor range of CO measurement is 0 -100 ppm.   
The Pivot Breath Sensor  (Figure 1) is portable, battery -powered, and small enough to be 
conveniently carried by the user throughout the day (pocket, purse, backpack). The sensor  
is rechargeable using a micro -USB cable.  The user submits a breath sample by exhaling 
(blowing) into  the sensor mouthpiece.  
6.1.1 Indications for Use  
The Pivot Breath Sensor is a breath carbon monoxide monitor intended for single -user use 
by cigarette smokers to inform the user about how breath carbon monoxide levels are 
affected by smoking behavior.  The dev ice is not intended to be used with other inhaled 
products.

6.3 PIVOT BREATH SENSOR  SUBMITTING A BREATH SAMPLE  (SPECIFIC STEPS ) 
Submitting a breath sample involves the following steps . Instructions can be accessed in 
multiple locations including the Pivot Breath Sensor’s display screen, in the online User 
Manual  , Quick Start Guide , and on the packaging .

 1. User presses any button t o turn on the Pivot Breath Sensor.  
2. User presses and holds the center  button on the Pivot Breath Sensor until the sensor  
beeps once . 
3. User takes a deep breath in and holds their breath for 10 seconds.  
4. After about 10 seconds, the device beeps 3 times , and the user then will exhale slowly 
until the sensor vibrates  at 12 seconds.  
5. The user’s CO level will display on the sensor’s screen.  
A properly submitted breath sample is defined  as one that initiates after the third beep 
prompt and is of at least 6 seco nds duration.  Breath sensor hardware and firmware is 
capable of detecting when a breath sample submission starts and stops.  The suggested 
breath sampling regimen is 4 breath samples per day, with samples spread over the course 
of the day.  
The CO Log scree n on the Pivot Breath Sensor  provides the CO (ppm) value for properly 
submitted breath sample s.  
The computation of concentration of CO (ppm) is performed within  the Pivot  Breath 
Sensor firmware and the data (CO ppm concentration, time and date) are stored  in the 
Pivot  Breath Sensor memory.  This data is also stored  and visible  in the Pivot  app when 
the Pivot Breath Sensor and user’s smartphone are paired  via Bluetooth Low Energy 
(BLE ). Opening the Pivot app syncs the data to its most updated state, which study staff 
and participants may access in real -time.  User’s may also sync their breath sensor data by 
tapping the breath sensor icon in the upper right corner of the Pivot app and then tapping 
“Sync Now’  in the dropdown menu.  
6.4 CO  LOG 
The CO Log  can be accessed from the Pivot Breath Sensor’s display screen and shows  the 
most recent exhaled breath CO value in ppm at the top of the screen.  The user can view 
previous values by scrolling within the log  (Figure  2).   
Values are color coded and can be interpreted by the user with help from the labeling  
(Figure 3).

Figure 3. Labeling to interpret results   
 
CO values are also stored  in the Pivot  app on the participant’s smartphone. When the 
Pivot Breath Sensor is paired to a user’s phone, his/her CO values  and date/time of breath 
samples populate the Pivot  app. 
 
6.5 PIVOT APP 
The Pivot app includes educational content, the ability to log cigarettes, set a quit date, 
create a quit plan, play educational games, watch educational videos, interact with a 
dedicated human coach via in -app text messaging, view CO breath sample values and 
trends, learn about and then order NRT , and access the mode rated online Pivot 

Pivot Health Technologies  Inc.  
 Document No.   
 
 community discussion forum . The educational journey in the Pivot App comprises 4 
tracts : Learn, Reduce, Prepare to Quit, and Maintain My Quit,  and is designed to 
accommodate smokers along the spectrum of readiness to quit. Participants m ay choose 
to focus on building self -awareness and learn more about their smoking behavior, create 
and practice their plan to quit or reduce  smoking , make a quit attempt, focus on staying 
quit, or any combination thereof. Accordingly, p articipants may navigate between tracts  
as desired to access content most relevant to their goals and needs.  
 The Pivot 
app is compatible with iOS and Android pho nes. 
 
6.6 PIVOT COACHING  
Pivot users are assigned a human coach with whom they will work one -on-one over the 
duration of their use of Pivot (up to one year). Communication between coach and the 
Pivot user is via asynchronous in -app text messaging. Pivot coache s are tobacco 
treatment specialists. Coaching is based on cognitive behavioral therapy and uses 
evidence -based techniques in tobacco cessation such as motivational interviewing, with 
the aim to help participants reach their goals related to tobacco use. Pa rticipants may 
reach out to their coach whenever and however often they like. The coach will reach out 
periodically, approximately once per week, during the participant’s active use of Pivot.  
 
6.7 PIVOT NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY (NRT)  
Pivot users may order FDA -cleared over -the-counter NRT through the Pivot app. 
Participants are provided with on -label information about the NRT, must also 
acknowledge understanding of contraindications . The NRT is free of charge to the 
participant. There is no out -of-pocket pay ment by the participant for the NRT. The types 
of NRT offered in Pivot include nicotine patches  (7, 14 and/or 21 mg) , nicotine gum  (2 or 
4 mg), and nicotine lozenges  (2 or 4 mg) . Participants may order 
patches, gum or lozenges alone as mo no-therapy, or they may order patches + gum or 
patches + lozenges. Participants may order NRT every 2 weeks for up to a 12 -week 
course of NRT.  NRT arrives with written instructions/FDA -cleared labeling.  
 
6.8 PIVOT MODERATED ONLINE COMMUNITY  
Pivot users may acc ess the moderated online discussion community through the Pivot 
app. The forum is moderated by a tobacco treatment specialist. The online community 
forum is a place to give and receive support and advice from others going through the 
Pivot program.  
 
7. STUDY DESIGN AND OVERVIEW  
7.1 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a two-arm, parallel -group, non -crossover, single -center pilot randomized 

Pivot Health Technologies  Inc.  
 Document No.   
 
 controlled trial  conducted with IRB approval enrolling up to 180 subjects who report daily 
smoking  of 5 cigarettes or more.  The study wi ll be performed remotely on an ambulatory 
basis .  Participants  will be randomized to use either the Pivot (intervention) or QuitGuide 
(control) app-based smoking cessation program. They will be asked  to setup the ir assigned  
app on their smartphone  and in t he case of being assigned to the intervention arm, also set 
up their Pivot Breath Sensor . Participants will be able to learn about and order up to a 12 -
week supply of NRT at their discretion. Participants may participate in up to four 
videocall bioval idation study visits, depending on the smoking status. During these visits, 
participants provide a breath sample using the Pivot breath sensor, and share their CO ppm 
results in real -time. The study lasts for 2 years (104 weeks). It is estimated that up to  the 
first 6 months will be primarily  focused on active program use and the remaining time in 
the study will be devoted to passive periodic follow -up. Participants  will receive the 
online study questionnaires  via email , from Survey Monkey,  at intervals throughout the 
study .

7.4 PARTICIPANT  RECRUITMENT  AND  INFORMED CONSENT  
Participant s will be recruited  in the United State s through web media (e.g. Facebook, 
Google Ads)  . Potential participants will be asked to provide contact 
information ( first name, phone number, email addres s), and answer questions on 
demographics (gender, age , employment status, location via city and state , race/ethnicity ), 
smartphone ownership , and smoking attitudes and behavior  (Stage of Change and CPD)  
using the Online Screening Form . Study staff will review each potential 
participant’s responses to the eligibility questions . 
Online screening form responses will be reviewed by study staff. Using non -proportional 
quota sampling, p otential participants will be called on a first -come -first-served basis, as 
possible, with the aim  to enroll 40 -60% males, 40 -60% females, no more than 50% of 
participants from any decade -spanning age gr oup (ex. 30 -39 years of age, etc.) , no more 
than 70% of participants in the non -Hispanic white race category  and up to 20% 
unemployed .  The goal s of these non -proportional quota sampling ranges are to ensure 

Pivot Health Technologies  Inc.  
 Document No.   
 
 representation among males, racial/ethnic minori ties, age groups,  and individuals with 
varying socioeconomic status . Regarding the non -proportional quota sampling for 
employment, at the time of protocol design (March  and April , 2021) the unemployment 
rate in the U.S. was 6. 0%.[24] Acknowledging a higher  unemployment rate among people 
who smoke  [25-28], and the desire to include individuals who either do not receive 
payment for their work or are not pursuing employment (stay -at-home parents, caretakers, 
students, retired individuals) we will enroll up to 20% of participants who do not currently 
have employment for which they are compensated.  
During the  screening phone call, potential participants  will be asked  questions to confirm 
study eligibility  . During this call, study personnel will inform the potential 
participant  of the study details and will answer any questions .  
Potential participant s will then determine if they would like to proceed . If they would like 
to proceed, study staff will arrange f or a brief ( 1-2 minute) videocall with the potential 
participant using the HIPAA -compliant study videoconference platform to confirm 
capability on the participant’s behalf.  This call should be completed prior to 
randomization. Study personnel will email th e potential participan t an electronic HIPAA 
Authorization form and an electronic Informed Consent Form  (ICF)  . The 
potential participan t will have ample time to read these forms  and the opportunity to ask 
questions. The participan t will sign the electronic HIPAA Authorization and ICF before 
participating in this study.  The ICF will seek documented confirmation of potential study 
participant ’s readiness to quit smoking in the next 30 days. Once signing the ICF, the 
participant  will be given a unique  identifier  to protect participan t privacy .  
7.5 PARTICIPANT  RANDOMIZATION , STRATIFICATION AND ENROLLMENT  
After signing the ICF, the participant will complete an online Baseline Questionnaire. 
Based on responses to the qu estionnaire, participants will be randomly assigned in a 
computer -generated 1:1 manner to either Pivot or QuitGuide using randomly permuted 
blocks of size 2  and 4, stratified by daily smoking frequency (≤14 vs ≥15 cigarettes per 
day), employment status  (full-time or part -time employment  vs unemployed ), 
race/ethnicity (minority race/ethnicity vs non -Hispanic White), and  expected difficulty 
staying quit ( scale 1 -10; self -reported score of ≤5 vs. ≥6) . After randomization, 
participants  will be emailed the link to access their assigned group . In both groups, 
participants will be able to  access their assigned study app  from the moment of 
randomization and beyond (ie, after the end of the 2-year study  period) .  
Participants will be considered enrolled after completing the following 3 tasks: 
electronically signing the informed consent form, completing the Baseline Questionnaire  
and reporting the date they first logged in to their assigned app . If participants do n ot 
complete all three criteria, they may be removed from the study.  
 
7.6 PARTICIPANT  STIPEND  
Participants are compensated for completing the online questionnaires  (up to $ 365 in total 
for 16 questionnaires) . If participants report 7 -day PPA on the 12 -, 26-, 52- and/or 104-
week questionnaire , they will have the opportunity to do a biovalidation videoconference 

Pivot Health Technologies  Inc.  
 Document No.   
 
 study visit. Participants will be compensated $50 for each biovalidation visit they 
complete  (up to 4 biovalidation visits in total) for up  to $2000. In total, participants may 
earn up to $ 565 over the course of the 2 -year study.  Compensation will be in the form of 
Visa or Mastercard gift cards that are mailed or emailed to their provided address. 
Payments will be bundled as depicted in the Informed C onsent Form  with participants 
receiving up to 6 payments over the course of the study . Bundled p ayments will be 
processed upon completion of the item (s) for which the participant is receiving payment 
and will take 2 -3 weeks to arrive to the participant aft er being processed . Participant s will 
be compensated for each questionnaire they complete, even if they do not complete all 
questionnaires that are included within a payment bundle .  
7.7 SAMPLE SIZE AND JUSTIFICATION  
As this is a  pilot RCT  and first assessment  of Pivot compared to usual care , the study's 
sample size is powered to show differences in engagement, operationalized as the number 
of times participants open their assigned app. Previous clinical studies assessing Pivot 
have reported a mean of 2 4.2-38.7 app opens  (SD range 20.8-25.9)  by 90 days  (data on 
file). In addition, Bricker et al. reported app opens comparing ACT -based smoking 
cessation apps (SmartQuit and iCanQuit)  to QuitGuide . In one study, a t 2-month follow -
up, Bricker et al. reported mean (SD) app opens were 37.2 (46.1) for SmartQuit and 15.2 
(13.6) for QuitGuide. [10] In a subsequent study, at 12 -month follow -up, mean (SD) app 
opens were 37.5 (88.4) for iCanQuit and 9.9 (50.0) for QuitGuide. [11]   
Based on this data, we estimate  mean (SD)  25 (25) app opens in the intervention arm vs. 
15 (19) app opens in the control arm at 12 weeks. To detect a difference of 10 app opens 
or greater between Pivot and QuitGuide with 0.8 power and 0.05 alpha would require 
156.7  participants , which we round up to 1 58. In a previous study, 272/319 (85.3%) 
participants completed the end -of-Pivot questionnaire at a mean (SD) 4.1 (1.4) months 
after enrollment. [13,14] Considering that we will assess our primary endpoint at 3 
months (12 we eks), we are accordingly including an expected 15% attrition  rate, with a 
plan to enroll up to 180 participants (up to 90 in each arm).

8. STUDY PROCEDURE  
8.1 SCREENING  
See section 7.4 Participant Recruitment  and Informed Consent   
8.2 REGISTRATION  
After electronically signing the Informed Consent Form, the participant will complete the 
online Baseline Questionnaire. After completing the Baseline Questionnaire, participants 
will undergo computer -generated randomization  to either the intervention o r control  study 
group, as described in section 7.5 Participant Randomization, Stratification and 
Enrollment . Participants are then emailed a link for their assigned app. Upon opening the 
link, participants will register in their assigned app, providing baseline inf ormation on 
their smoking behavior . While p articipants are encouraged to select a quit date in their app 
that occurs within 30 days of enrollment , this is not required for participation.  
8.3 ACTIVE PROGRAM USE 

Pivot Health Technologies  Inc.  
 Document No.   
 
 The participan t will initiate us e of their assigned program . To be considered enrolled, one 
must : sign the electronic informed consent form, complet e the Baseline Questionnaire , and 
provide  the date they first logged in to  their assigned app . Participants may receive up to 
two text or email messages during the first week of the study reminding them to go into 
their study app and confirm they have done so.  There is no pre -determined time  limit on 
how long a participant can actively engage in the ir app, although it is expected most 
participants will complete engagement by 6 months from enrollment. For individuals 
enrolled in the intervention arm, coaching is available for up to 12 months from 
enrollment . In both arms, p articipants may order up to 12 weeks of NRT, in two -week 
increments  over the first 12 months of the study . Pivot is designed to be a 12 -month 
program.  There is one possible biovalidation videocall visit at 12 weeks during this 
portion of the study  and weekly online questionnaires at the end of weeks 1 through 12.  
8.4 FOLLOW -UP 
As it is expected that  most participants will complete engagement  in their respective 
programs  by 6 months, the study will focus on follow -up at that point and beyond. The 
follow -up period includes t hree possible biovalidation videocall visits at 26 , 52 and 104  
weeks, and online questionnaires at 26, 52 and 104 weeks.  
8.5 BIOVALIDATION  
Biovalidation will be sought at 12, 26 , 52 and 104  weeks in individuals who reported 7 -
day (or greater) PPA on the associated questionnaire  (from 12, 26,  52 or 104  weeks) . A 
videocall will be scheduled for within 7 days  following  the participant’s response to the  
associated questionnaire.  At the beginning of each biovalidation call, participants will be 
asked 7-day PPA  status . Participants will be asked  (yes/no)  if they have smoked any 
other non-cigarette (ex. pipes, cigars, hookah) or combustible materials (ex. cloves, 
marijuana) over the last 24 hours. They will also be asked how many cigarettes they 
currently smoke per day. Participants who indicate they are not at least 7 days abstinent 
(i.e., answer “Yes” to the following question: “In the last 7 days have you smoked any 
cigarettes, eve n a single puff?”) and/or indicate they c urrently smoke cigarettes  will not 
be eligible to undergo further biovalidation testing during the visit. Participants who 
indicate they are at least 7 days abstinent and do not smoke cigarettes will be eligible to 
proceed with the testing. Participants who indicate they have smoked any other 
combustible materials over the previous 24 hours will be eligible to undergo 
biovalidation test, with the option to schedule a follow -up biovalidation test for the 
following day  with instruction to not smoke the previously reported other combustible 
substance (s) over the intervening 24 -hour period.  If a participant is eligible for 
biovalidation and biovalidation is not achieved, the reason will be noted (ex. did not 
complete a bi ovalidation study visit, reported relapse so biovalidation visit was not 
completed, participant’s breath CO sample was 10 ppm or more, etc.).   
If this is the first study biovalidation visit a participant has participated in, the steps of the 
visit and the CO breath sample  will be described in detail, with questions fielded and 
verbal confirmation the participant would like  to proceed obtained before doing the 
biovalidation test. If this is not the first study biovalidation visit a participant has 
participat ed in, the re will be a high -level review of the  steps of the visit and the CO 

Pivot Health Technologies  Inc.  
 Document No.   
 
 breath sample, with questions fielded and verbal confirmation that the participant would 
like to proceed  obtained.  
Biovalidation will be obtained through CO breath sampling. For the 12 -, 26- and 52 -week 
biovalidation visits, p articip ants in the intervention arm will use their Pivot Breath Sensor 
for this test. Participants in the control arm will be mailed a Pivot Breath Sensor prior to 
the visit that has a limited number (10 or less) of samples it can perform. For the 104 -
week bioval idation  visit, all eligible participants who schedule the biovalidation visit will 
be mailed a Pivot Breath Sensor. On the call, p articipants will have the process of giving 
a breath sample described to them. They w ill be offered the chance to ask question s, and 
then study staff will provide an overview of the steps to give a breath sample. When they 
feel ready, they will give a breath sample and hold the breath sensor up to the screen 
immediately after completing the sample so that study staff on the video call can see the 
CO ppm measurement on the breath sensor screen . A CO ppm value of less than 10 will 
be considered consistent with abstinence .[16]   
After their first biovalidation visit, participants in the control arm will be instructed to not 
use the br eath sensor beyond the visit, and to place the sensor in a safe place (for 
example, in the original packaging, in a closet) for use at a future biovalidation visit, 
should there be one. For future biovalidation visits, participants will use their existing 
breath sensor or will be sent a new one (fully functioning breath sensors for the 
intervention arm and sensors limited to 10 breath samples for the control arm  for 12 -, 26- 
and 52 -week visits ; and fully functioning sensor s for all eligible participants for  the 104 -
week visit ) as needed. Participants will keep the breath sensor. While the sponsor will not 
request the sensors be mailed back, participants may mail their sensor(s) back to the 
sponsor if they prefer.  
8.6 REMINDERS  
Over the first 12 weeks of the stu dy, p articipant s will receive an email or text reminder to 
engage with their assigned program  every other week (for a total of 6 reminders). These 
reminders will be sent out during weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11. Two of these communications 
will remind participants of the availability of NRT.  During the first week of the study, 
participants may receive up to an additional two text or email messages  reminding them to 
log into their study app and confirm they have done so.  
Participants will receive periodic reminders from study staff to complete the ir

10. TECHNICAL APPROACH AND  STUDY DESIGN  
10.1 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA  
Data will be accepted if the participant meets eligibility criteria , and complete s the 
electronic informed consent  form , the Baseline Questionnaire  and reports a date they first 
opened their assigned study app . 
10.2 ADVERSE EVENTS  
Participan ts will be asked to detail any issues with the ir assigned smoking cessation 
program  and/or NRT on the 26- and 52 -week  questionnaire s. In addition, participants 
may offer up such issues at any point during the study by reaching out to study staff 
and/or cus tomer service. The study sponsor follows a department operating procedure 
(DOP -1748, Clinical Adverse Event Reporting, ) for adverse event 

Pivot Health Technologies  Inc.  
 Document No.   
 
 reporting. In accordance with the sponsor’s adverse event policy, Quality Assurance will 
be made aware of  these issues. Additional information will be sought from participants 
reporting issues , as needed. Upon collection of adequate information on the issue, or an 
adequate good -faith effort to obtain such information, a determination will be made 
regarding an y associated reporting requirements , in compliance with DOP -1748 and 
Quality Assurance reporting policies . 
10.3 DATA SAFETY MANAGEMENT BOARD  
As the study interventions of app -based smoking cessation programs and over -the-counter 
NRT are standard and low -risk, a  data safety monitoring board is not used. This is aligned 
with a recent RCT with similar design, which assessed web- and social -media based quit 
programs combined with NRT.[2 9] 
11. STUDY  RESULTS  
11.1 DATA COLLECTION AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
The study sponsor follows a department operating procedure (DOP -1749, ) 
for clinical data management. Participant s will be assigned a unique participant  ID which 
will be used for data collection. Data collection will take place on electronic case report 
forms (C RFs) via online questionnaires completed by study participants , through data 
collected in the Pivot  app and on the biovalidation videocalls . The biovalidation videocalls 
will be conducted on a HIPAA -compliant version of a video call platform (Zoom  or 
Google Meet ). CRFs will be reviewed by the study team prior to the end of the study to 
ensure completeness . Based on this review, additional or complete data will be sought 
from participants as needed. Access to electronic CRFs  will be limited to neces sary study 
personnel. Study data will be kept in a secure database by the investigator. This database 
will be accessible only by necessary study personnel. The database will not contain 
personal identifying information; all subject data in the database wil l be associated with 
study identification numbers. The data will be kept for  a minimum of  5 years . The 
data shall be retained for a maximum period of time that is equivalent to the design and 
expected life of the Pivot smoking cessation product  or the dura tion of the study sponsor's 
(Pivot Health Technologies  Inc., formerly Carrot Inc.) existence, whichever is the shortest  
of the two.   
Regarding use of Pivot,  associated data will be accessed by study investigators with the 
Pivot app , including data on the use of the Pivot Breath Sensor . This app is the 
commercially available Pivot app. With regard to the information we will collect, we, the 
study sponsor, associate each logged -in user to a user I D that is a unique identifier which 
is generated randomly on account creation. We will periodically synchronize logs from the 
sensor and upload them based on this user  ID only. The breath samples we collect only 
contain information regarding: sample I D, type, value, and t ime. When we upload this  
breath sample  information, the only additional information included would be the Pivot 
app build information and user’s breath s ensor ID. Through the Pivot app, we are able to 
assess user app engagement characteristics such as time and duration of app openings and 
content accessed. We are also able to assess user inputs into the app such as cigarette 
logging, responses to questions asked during activities, quit dates, and the ordering of 
NRT. We comply with HIPAA and state this in our privacy and terms of use on our 

Pivot Health Technologies  Inc.  
 Document No.   
 
 website . As such we adhere to HIPAA’s Breach Notification Rule should a data breach 
occur. We take careful measures to prevent a data breach including use of encryptions, 
secure connections, and limited access to data.  We use  appropriate safeguards and compl y, 
where applicable, with 45 C.F.R. Part 164, Subpart C with respect to Electronic Protected 
Health Information, to prevent use or disclosure of Protected Health Information. 
Specifically, Pivot Health Technologies Inc. (formerly Carrot Inc.) has implemented th e 
administrative, physical, and technical safeguards set forth in 45 C.F.R. §§ 164.308, 
164.310, and 164.312 that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, 
integrity, and availability of any Protected Health Information that it creates, rec eives, 
maintains, or transmits.  
Regarding use of QuitGuide, we do not have access to automated data from app use. As 
such, use and engagement data will be self -reported on electronic CRFs via online 
questionnaires completed by study participants . The QuitG uide app is maintained by the 
U.S. Government. It is protected by various provisions of Title 18, U.S. Code. The 
QuitGuide app notes, “NCI complies with requirements for privacy and security 
established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Departm ent of Health and 
Human Services (DHHS), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).”  
11.2 ANALYSIS  
In this pilot randomized control study, c hanges in measurements from baseline to intra -
study to exit will be assessed. Participants will serve as their own controls and 
comparisons will be made to no change. One sample t -test will be used for numerical data. 
Fisher’s Exact or Chi square tests will be used for categorical data.  Analyses will be 
conducted to calculate mean (SD) for normally distributed variable s for actual data or 
mean (SE) for modeled data and median (interquartile range) values in instances of non -
normally distributed variables. McNemar test will be used for 2 -category match -paired 
data. Cohen kappa statistic will be used for 3 -category match -paired data. Statistical 
significance is set at P<.05. All deviations from the study protocol will be identified, 
recorded and analyzed . 
11.3 STUDY REPORT  
A final study r eport will be produced at the end of the study; PowerPoint format is 
acceptable. The report  will detail participant characteristics, program  usage, the 
aforementioned outcomes of changes in attitudes towards quitting and smoking behavior 
as well as participant feedback.  
11.4 DEVIATIONS FROM PROTOCOL  
Deviations will be  determined by the study team dur ing the study. Deviations will be 
assessed through a consensus review by the study team. All deviations will be identified, 
recorded and analyzed in the final report.   
11.5 RECORD RETENTION  
Record keeping is performed in accordance with the SOP Control of Quali ty Records ,

of Sr. Director of Clinical Affairs.  These conflicts of interest are mitigated by the following:  
• The risk profile of the study,  specifically, that t here are minimal  anticipated risks or 
harms to the subject.  No medical decisions are made based on study data.  The process of 
setting up and using Pivot is non -invasive, and participants have access to  trained study 
and customer support personnel  for assistance as needed . Use of  Pivot , including 
completing breath samples  with the Pivot Breath Sensor , ordering and using over -the-
counter NRT and otherwise using the Pivot app  are done at the discretion of the study 
participant.  No specific use of Pivot  is required .   
• The role of Pivot Health Technologies Inc. (formerly  Carrot Inc. ) in the study is outlined 
in the study Informed Consent Form; participants will be aware of this role prior to 
providing informed consent.  
• The aim of the study is to assess the performance  of Pivot compared to QuitGuide,  and 
then use this data to inform future studies and optimize  Pivot  as needed. This study will 
inform  resultant improvements made to the Pivot Health Technologies Inc. (forme rly 
Carrot Inc. ) products . As such, it is imperative, and the goal, that the study sponsor uses 
this data to ensure its products are as  user-friendly  and accurate  as possible.

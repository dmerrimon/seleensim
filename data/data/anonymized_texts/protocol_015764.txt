STUDY PHASE  Phase 2/3 
TITLE  A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized-Withdrawal, 
Mult
icenter Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Xyrem  with an Open -
Label Pharmacokinetic Evaluation and Safety Extension in Pediatric Subjects with Narcolepsy with Cataplexy  
LOCATIONS  This study will be conducted globally at app roximately 70 sites  
OBJECTIVES  Primary objectives are:  
1) To evaluate the efficacy of Xyrem (sodium oxybate) oral solution in the treatment of cataplexy in pediatric subjects  
with 
narcolepsy  
2) To evaluate the safety of Xyrem in the treatment of cataplexy in pediatric subjects with narcolepsy for up to one year (and potentially more than one year in some subjects participating in a continuation of the open- label safety evaluation ) 
Secondary objectives are:  
1) To evaluate the efficacy of Xyrem in the treatment of exces
sive daytime sleepiness  (EDS) in pediatric subjects  with 
narcolepsy  with cataplexy  
2) To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Xyrem in ped
iatric subjects  (ages 7 -17 years) with narcolepsy with 
cataplexy   
3) To evaluate the safety of titrating Xyrem in pediatric subjects  
to a
n effective and tolerable dose  
DESIGN  Under Amendment 5, this study is divided into two parts: Part 1 incl
udes one year of treatment , and Part 2 , the Open -Label  
Continuation Period, provides the opportunity to continue treatment for up to an additional 2 years. 
Part 1  
Part 1 of t his study was initially designed as a double-blind, placebo-
controlled, randomized- withdrawal, multicenter study of the efficacy 
and safety of Xyrem  (sodium oxybate) oral solution. As a result of a 
preplanned interim analysis, which demonstrated positive effic acy 
results on the primary efficacy endpoint, the protocol was amended

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 3 of 158 (Amendment 4) to replace  placebo treatment in the Double -Blind 
Treatment Period  with open- label Xyrem treatment. After 
Amendment 4 becom ing effective, all subjects entering the Double-
Blind Treatment Period will receive open -label Xyrem treatment. For 
administrative reasons, the term “Double- Blind Treatment Period” 
will continue to be used throughout the protocol. Following the 
Double-Blind Treatment Period (2 weeks ), this study also includes an 
open-label safety extension allowing subjects to continue Xyrem treatment for up to one year in Part 1 .  
In addition, the PK of Xyrem will be evaluated in a subset of subjects.  
Children and adolescents, diagnosed with narcolepsy with cataplexy who are currently treated with Xyrem or are Xyrem naïve, with or without concomitant stable stimulant use, are eligible to enter the study. For this study, a Xyrem naïve subject is defined as a subject who has never been treated with Xyrem or who was prev
iously treated 
with Xyrem and discontinued Xyrem for at least one month prior to the Part 1 
Screening visit for reasons other than lack of efficacy and/or 
tolerability issues (e.g., lost insurance coverage, could not afford Xyrem, changed prescribers) . 
All subjects will be evaluated for eligibility during the Part 1 
Screening Period (up to 30 days [if needed, additional time may be granted with permission of the Medical Monitor] ). 
Following Part 1 screening, s ubj
 ects who are Xyrem naïve will enter 
the Open -Label Titration Period of up to 10 weeks. Once the Xyrem 
dose has been optimized per the Investigator’s judgment, these subject s may enter the open -label Stable- Dose Period  with that dose. 
Subjects who are on Xyrem at study entry will remain on their stable dose and regimen  (i.e., two equally divided doses or two unequally 
divided doses) of Xyrem and enter the Stable -Dose Period following 
screening.   
Subjects are eligible to enter the Double- Blind Treatment Pe riod if the 
dose and regimen of Xyrem remains unchanged during the Stable-Dose Period and, in the judgment of the Investigator, no clinically 
significant worsening in narcolepsy symptoms or clinically significant 
adverse events due to Xyrem treatment have occurred.  
Subjects entering the Double- Blind Treatment Period prior to 
Amendment 4 becoming effective,  had been  randomized 1:1 to 
receive one of the following two treatments d uring the 2- week 
Double- Blind Treatment Period (randomized- withdrawal) : 
• Xyrem : Active Xyrem will be continued as a double-blind 
treatment at the stable dose  taken  and regimen used in the prior 
2 weeks

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 4 of 158 • Xyrem placebo : Xyrem placebo will be initiated as a double -blind 
treatment at a volume and regimen equivalent to the Xyrem dose 
taken  in the prior 2 weeks. 
Subjects entering the Double- Blind Treatment Period after 
Amendment 4 becom ing effec tive will receive open -label Xyrem  
treatment  in this period. 
Subjects who complete the entire Double- Blind  Treatment Period will 
be eligible to contin ue in the Open -Label Safety Period . The Open -
Label Safety Period will allow subjects to continue Xyrem treatment 
for up to one year in Part 1 . 
In addition, at certain study sites, a subset of subjects on a stable dose 
of Xyrem will participate in an open- label PK evaluation  during 
Part 1. Subjects will be stratified to two age groups: 7 -11 years of age 
and 12-17 years of age. Up to 18 subjects in each of the two age groups will be eligible to participate in the PK evaluation. 
Every effort 
will be made  to ensure a minimum of 12 subjects in each age group 
complete the PK assessments. However, when sufficient data are obtained to characterize the PK profile with adequate precision during the study, as determined by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), or when enrollment of 100 subjects in the study has been 
reached, enrollment in the PK evaluation will stop and existing data will be analyzed and reported. These subjects will have a limited number of blood samples taken while on Xyrem at the clinic  to 
measure sodium oxybate concentrations. Samples will be taken at the following times relative to the first Xyrem dose: 0 (pre -dose), 0.75, 
1.5, 2.5, and 4 hours (pre-2nd dose) to characterize the PK of the first Xyrem dose, and at 4.75 and 8 hours to cha racterize the peak and 
residual exposure associated with the second Xyrem dose (total blood volume for PK samples is 40 mL taken over a minimum of 2 days ). 
Subjects evaluated for 
PK will also undergo all other study procedures 
specified in the protocol. 
Part 2 
Upon approval of Amendment 5, subjects who complete one year in the study (Part 1) will have the opportunity to continue open- label 
Xyrem treatment in Part 2 until the first occurrence of any of the following: 
• Up to an additional 2 years 
• Un
til the  s ubject  reaches  18 years of age  
• Until up to 3 months after the US FDA decision on the addition of 
pe
diatric data to the Xyrem US prescribing information (PI)  
Subject s who have already completed Part 1  m ay re -enroll in Part 2.

2nd nighttime dose. Dose proportionality will be based on the ratio of 
AUC values for each subject. Pharmacokinetics will be summarized 
for the 7 -11 and 12-17 year age groups, and a compar ison to historical 
PK data in adults will also be made.  
STATISTICAL 
ANALYSIS  To address Primary Objective 1 and Secondary Objective 1:  
A tiered approach was planned to control the Type 1 family- wise error 
rate at the 0.05 significance level with all tests  being two- sided for 
testing of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. 
 Due to the positive primary efficacy results from the pre -specified 
interim analyses, the DSMB recommended to stop the Double-Blind Randomized-Withdrawal Period.   T iered testin g on secondary 
endpoints, as defined below, will be conducted with a significance 
level of 0.05, with all tests being two- sided.  
Tier 1: Primary endpoint 
Change in weekly number of cataplexy attacks from the last 2  week
 s 
of the Stable-Dose Period to the 2 weeks of the Double-Blind 
Treatment Period. 
The primary endpoint demonstrated efficacy at the interim analysis 
wit
h a significance level <0.005.  Testing will continue with Tier 2.  
Tier 2: Key s econda ry endpoint #2 
CGIc for cataplexy severity from  the  end of the Stable -Dose Period to 
the end of the Double- Blind Treatment Period  
The testing of this endpoint will be conducted at the 0.05 significance leve
l. If Xyrem is significantly better th an placebo at this level, Tier 3  
tests will be conducted. 
Tier 3: Ke y seconda ry endpoint #3 
Change in the ESS (CHAD) score from the end of the Stable- Dos e 
Period to the end of the Double-Blind Treatment Period  
The testing of this endpoint will be conducted at the 0.05 significance 
leve
l. If Xyrem is significantly better than placebo at this level, Tier 4 
tests will be conducted. 
Tier 4: Other secondary endpoint #4 
CGIc for narcolepsy overall from the end of the Stable-Dose Period to 
the e
nd of the Double-Blind Treatment Period  
The testing of this endpoint will be conducte d at t he 0.05 significance 
level.  If Xyrem is significantly better than placebo at this level, Tier 5 
tests will be conducted. 
Tier 5: Other secondary endpoint #5 
Change in QoL (SF-10) from the end of the Stable-Dose Period to the 
end of t
he Double-Blind T reatment Period

level.  
Exploratory efficacy endpoints will be tested without multiplicity 
adjustments.  For these parameters, nominal p-values will be reported.  
Non-categorical efficacy parameters will be analyzed by non -
parametric analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Ordinal categorical parameters, including CGIc and PGIc, will be analyzed using Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel (CMH) tests for row mean score 
difference.  
Efficacy data in the open -labe
 l phase will be summarized by visit.  
To address Primary Objective 2 and Secondary Objective 3:  
Safety will be summarized using descriptive statistics and reported separ
ately for Part 1 and Part 2  as well as across the entire study 
(Part  1 and Part 2) for select analyses. Adverse events will be assessed 
for subpopulations including Xyrem naïve, subjects on Xyrem at study entry, Ages 7-11, and Ages 12-17, as applicable. When summarizing data across the entire study by subpopulations, subjec ts 
are analyzed according to their initial enrollment status. For Part 1, adverse events will also be summarized b y treatment group and by 
dose. Safety analyses will also include an analysis of the nadir oxygen saturation level at each dose, and number and duration of any confirmed desaturations below 90%, 80%, 70%, 60% and 50% on PSG nights excluding the screening PSG. For Part 2, safety data will 
be summarized by Ages 7-11, Ages 12-17, and overall.  
To address Secondary Objective 2:  
Concentration data for sodium oxybate will be summarized by 
samp
ling time point and by PK parameter using descriptive statistics 
for each age group and overall. Dose proportionality will be assessed from the ratio of AUC and C
max values. The ratios and their 90% 
confidence intervals will be presented. If warranted, regression models will be used to explore the relationship between plasma concentration and dose on a mg/kg basis.  
An ongoing analysis of the PK data will also be conducted to 
chara
cterize the PK of Xyrem in children  and adolescents.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 158 1 INTRODUCTION 
Xyrem (sodium oxybate) oral solution (NDA 21-196) is approved in the United States ( US) 
for the treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy (2002) and for the treatment of 
excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in patients with narcolepsy (2005). Xyrem is also approved in Canada for the treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy (2005) and in the European Union ( EU) for the treatment of cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy 
(2005) and for use in the treatment of narcolepsy with cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy (2007).  Xyrem is currently marketed in the US, Canada, and 20 European countries. 
Xyrem ha s been on the US market for more than 14 ye
 ars. It is a Schedule III controlled 
substance available only through a restricted distribution program managed by the Central 
Pharmacy under a Risk  Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies ( REMS ). Xyrem is a CNS 
depressant and is taken at night  in two equally divided doses. 
Narcolepsy is a life-long neurologic disease for which no cure has been identified. It affects an est
imated 0.02% to 0.067% of the population worldwide and approximately 1 in 2000 
individuals in the United States ( Ohayon 2007, Majid & Hirshkowitz 2010) and 4.7 of 
10,000 (0.047%) individuals in the general population of five European countries (United Kingdom ( UK), Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) ( Ohayon et al. 2002). The 
symptomatology of this condition is  well described in the literature, with consensus on the 
five core symptoms of narcolepsy: EDS, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, sleep -related 
(hypnagogic and hypnopompic) hallucinations, and disrupted nighttime sleep (DN S) 
(Morgenthaler et al. 2007 ), with EDS and cataplexy being the most common symptoms. 
Although the majority of adult patients with narcolepsy had symptoms develop before 15 yea
rs of age —in rare cases before 5 years of age—there are no approved treatments f or 
pediatric narcolepsy/cataplexy ( Dauvilliers et al. 2001 , Okun et al. 2002, Yoss & Daly 1960), 
although all treatments used for the treatment of adults are used to treat children with narcolepsy ( Mignot 2012 ). Modafinil, a commonly used treatment for adult narcolepsy, is not 
approved in children because of safety concerns related to Stevens-Johnson syndrome and, per the US product label and the EU  summary of product characteristics (S mPC), should not 
be used for any pediatric indication ( Provigil US presc ribing information (PI) 2010; Provigil 
SmPC 2012). Dextroamphetamine is the only medication that provides dosing information for pediatric  narcolepsy ( Dexedrine Spansules
® US PI  2010); however, it is not approved for 
the treatment of narcolepsy for children or adolescents in Europe. Other stimulants, which are often used for the treatment of EDS, and antidepressants, which are often used for cataplexy, may provide insufficient benefit and are associated with known risks. Clearly a need exists for safe and effective treatments for pediatric patients with narcolepsy/cataplexy.  
The detrimental effects of narcolepsy on daily functioning and activities, psychosocial 
funct
ioning, quality of life, and work performance as well as effects on personal and public 
safety, given the increased risk of automotive and equipment accidents are well described 
in the literature on adult patients  (Broughton et al. 1981, Ingravallo et al. 2012). The effects 
of narcolepsy on the lives of pediatric patients (children and adolescents younger than 18 
years of age) are less commonly described but equally burdensome. Pediatric narcolepsy is associated with limitations on children’s activities due to EDS and cataplexy, poor

comorbidities including depression (Stores et al. 2006, Peraita- Adrados et al . 2011, Aran et 
al. 2010, Partinen et al. 2012), obesity (Peraita- Adrados et al . 2011, Poli et al. 2013), and 
precocious puberty (Peraita- Adrados et al . 2011, Poli et al. 2013).  
Xyrem has been used to treat narcolepsy symptoms in children and adolescents. Data from 
pub
lished studies in pediatric and adult patients indicate a similar safety profile and 
therapeutic response to Xyrem in the two age groups (<18 and ≥18 years). Post  marketing 
data from nearly 1,500 pediatric patients treated with Xyrem also sugg est a similar safety 
profile in the two age groups, although some non-serious events are reported more commonly in pediatric patients than in adults, and vice versa. 
Jazz Pharmaceuticals is conduct ing 
 this clinical stud y with Xyrem in pediatric patients with  
narcolepsy with cataplexy to generate efficacy, safety , and pharmacokinetics (PK) 
information on Xyrem in the pediatric population.  
1.1 Background and Rationale 
This study is being conducted under the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) pediatric 
Written Request.  
On February 24, 2016, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB )  for this study 
reviewed the results from a pre -planned interim analysis of the primary efficacy results based 
on 35 subjects having completed or discontinued from the Double-blind Randomized Withdrawal Period  of the protocol. The result of this analysis demonstrated positive efficacy 
on the primary endpoint, the c hange in weekly number of cataplexy attacks from the last 
2 weeks of the Stable -Dose Period to the 2 weeks of the Double- Blind Treatment Period at a 
significance level of p<0.005. Based on this analysis, the DSMB recommended that the placebo treatment in the Double-B lind Withdrawal Period  of the trial be stopped and the 
open-label portion of the study be continued, so as not to expose further subjects to placebo treatment. Amendment 4 to this protocol was based on that recommendation. The current amendment (Amendment 5) provides subjects who have completed one year in  the study 
(Part  1) the opportunity to continue treatment for up to an  additional 2 years  or until they 
reach 18  years of age or until up to 3 months after the US FDA decision on the addition of 
pediatric data to the Xyrem US PI, whichever occurs first. 
1.1.1  Clinica
 l Experience  
1.1.1.1  Adult Studies  
The eff ectiveness of Xyrem in treating the two main symptoms of narcolepsy —EDS and 
cataplexy —in adult subjects was demonstrated in three controlled clinical trials with 611 
patients with narcolepsy (398 subjects treated with Xyrem). Adverse events seen with  
frequ encies of ≥ 5% and twice the rate of placebo  in Xyrem -treated patients were nausea 
(20.9%), dizziness (19.7%), vomiting (8.5%), enuresis (6.5%), and diarrhea (5%). Xyrem 
was also evaluated in one Phase 2 and two Phase 3 randomized, controlled clinical trials in 
patients with fibromyalgia; however, Xyrem is not approved for fibromyalgia. Results of those studies indicate a similar safety profile to that seen in clinical trials for narcolepsy

patie nts with moderate to severe slee p apnea was conducted as a post marketing commitment 
(requirement).  Xyrem treatment was not associated with an increase in apnea hypopnea 
index ( AHI) but some clinically significan t desaturations were observed  (George  et al . 2010). 
The PK of Xyrem was extensively characterized in the clinical program that supported use of this
 drug for the indications of EDS and cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy. Xyrem is 
eliminated almost exclusively by metabolism through the Krebs cycle and does not inhibit CYP enzymes ( Xyrem  US PI  2016). Following oral administration, Xyrem is absorbed 
rapidly and consistently across the clinical dose range, with an absolute bioavailability of about 88%. The average peak concentrations (C
max) following administration of each of two 
2.25 g doses given under fasting conditions 4 hours apart were similar. The average time to peak plasma concentration (T
max) ranged from 0.5 to 1.25 hours. Following oral 
administration, the plasma concentrations of sodium oxybate increased more than dose-proportionally, with blood levels increasing 3.7-fold as the total daily dose is doubled from 4.5 to 9 g.  
1.1.1.2  Pediatric Studies  
EFFICACY DATA IN THE LITERATURE  
The effectiveness of  Xyrem in pediatric patients with narcolepsy/cataplexy has been 
described in five published studies: one controlled study and four published retrospective case analyses, with a combined total of 100  patients ( Murali & Kotagal 2006, Aran et al. 
2010, Lecend reux et al. 2012, Mansukhani & Kotagal  2012, Huang & Guilleminault 2009 ). 
Overall, Xyrem was shown to be effective in treating the symptoms of cataplexy, EDS, and DNS in narcolepsy in the scientific literature reporting its effects in children and adolesce nts. 
SAFETY DATA IN THE LITERATURE  
Safety data from Xyrem in children and adolescents with narcolepsy/cataplexy were reported in six  published studies: four retrospective case analyses and two prospective studies, with a 
combined total of 109 patients who took Xyrem for 2 to 90 months (Murali & Kotagal 2006, Aran et al. 2010, Lecendreux et al. 2012, Mansukhani & Kotagal 2012, Huang & Guilleminault 2009, Poli et al. 2012) . The safety profile of Xyrem in children and 
adolescents as reported in the scientific literature is similar to the known safety profile of Xyrem in adults.  
Adverse events reported in these six studies were similar to those seen with adults. Adverse event
s reported by more than 10% of patients in any one study were as follows: weight loss, 
headache, nausea, DNS, irritability, parasomnias, dry mouth, increased awakenings, dizziness, terminal insomnia, groaning, and sleepiness. There were no reports of premature puberty in 11 pre-pubertal children taking Xyrem ( Aran  et al. 2010 ) or adverse effects on 
growth parameters including weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) in a study of 15 children and adolescents (Mansukhani & Kotagal  2012). In these publications, the most 
serious AEs were increased nightmares and suicidal ideation and gesture in a 9- year-old 
patient (Murali & Kotagal 2006).  
Reasons for discontinuations across the six studies included increased nightmares and suic
idal ideation, dissociative feelings, and problems receiving drug shipments ( Murali & 
Kotagal 2006); AEs  (not specified) in 18% of pre-pubertal patients, lack of efficacy in 15%

2010); sleep loss and persistent nausea, each in 2 of 27 (7%) patients (Lecendreux et al. 
2012); nausea, constipation and dissociative feelings in 1 of 15 (7%) patients, and body aches and dizziness in 1 of 15 (7%) patients who later resumed use of the drug (Mansukhani & Kotagal  2012); and nausea in 1 of 9 (11%) patients (Poli et al. 2012). Huang 
& Guillemina ult (2009) did not report discontinuations. These reasons for discontinuation are 
common in adult patients as well.  
PHARMACOKINETIC DATA  
There are no PK data on Xyrem in children under 18 years of age. Although there are no studies examining the PK of sodium oxybate in children, it is known that the gastrointestinal system, which may have direct consequences on absorption bioavailability, clearance, and biotransformation of drugs, is functionally mature by about 1 year of age ( Walthall et al. 
2005). Intrav enous GHB has been used and studied in children at doses of 25 to 50 mg/kg 
(Rousseau et al. 2012) and up to 90 mg/kg for sedation ( Meyer et al. 2003); and at doses up 
to 100 mg/kg for anesthesia ( Hunter et al. 1971). The central nervous system ( CNS ) effects 
were consistent with those obtained with intravenous GHB in adults ( Kleinschmidt & 
Mertzlufft 1995, Solway & Sadove 1965 ), suggesting that post-absorption PK and 
pharmacodynamics are similar in children and adults.  
1.1.2  Post mar
 keting  Safety Data: 2002 through September 30, 2012  
A total of 43,306 US patients have received at least one shipment of Xyrem from product launc
h in 2002 through September 30, 2012. Of those, approximate ly 1,500 patients began 
Xyrem treatment when they were younger than 18 years  old, totaling approximately 
1,150 patient -years of exposure in pediatric patients, with a duration of use up to 7.4 years. 
Overall, the safety profile for frequent AEs reported in pediatric patients on Xyrem is similar to that seen with adults, with nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, somnolence, insomnia, and fatigue among the most common AEs in both patient populations. Enuresis, somnambulism, drug dose omission, nasopharyngitis, drug ineffective, and cataplexy were among the most frequently reported AEs in pediatric patients but these AEs were not as commonly reported in adults. Most of these common pediatric AEs are typically not considered to be serious, and some are related to childhood development and/or the underlying disease. Enuresis, for example, is a typical childhood disorder, and Xyrem likely contributes to its re -emergence by promoting deep sleep.  
Three deaths were reported in children who had received Xyrem treatment: one case of aspi
ration pneumonia in a 3- year-old boy with substantial developmental issues, one 
unconfirmed cause of death in an 11- year-old girl with reported cancer pain, and one 
homicide victim who was a 16 -year-old girl. There is no evidence that Xyrem was abused or 
misused by pediatric patients prescribed Xyrem, although medication errors, primarily from misunderstanding dosing instructions and abuse in one pediatric case associat ed with drug 
diversion from a patient, did occur. There is no signal that pediatric patients are more prone than adult patients taking Xyrem to depression, anxiety, convulsion, depressed level of consciousness, impaired respiratory drive, or psychiatric problems. No completed suicide was reported in pediatric patients. Suicidal ideation was coded in 5 pediatric patients, and suicide attempt was coded in 4 patients (all of whom were 16 or 17 years old); 3 of the

antiepileptic drugs, 2 used SSRIs, and one used an antidepressant (Xyrem IB). 
1.1.3  Drug -Dr ug Interaction  
Several drug -dru g interaction studies in healthy volunteers (Xyrem with zolpidem, 
protriptyline, modafinil, omeprazole, duloxetine, tramadol, lorazepam, ibuprofen, diclofenac, 
and divalproex sodium ) were conducted to evaluate the effects of co -administration of 
medications likely to be used concomitantly with Xyrem. There were no significant PK or pharmacodynamic ( PD) interactions between Xyrem and zolpidem, protriptyline, modafinil, 
omeprazole, duloxetine, tramadol, lorazepam, or ibuprofen. 
• Co-administration of Xyrem with diclofenac showed no significant differences in plasma 
PK or r 
enal excretion of sodium oxybate, and it did not appear to affect the PK of 
diclofenac. However, PD interactions , including reduced impairments to attention, were 
observed in the co- administration of Xyrem with diclofenac.  
• Co-administration of Xyrem with divalproex sodium resulted in an increase in AUC and 
an i
ncrease in renal clearance of sodium oxybate; C max was unchanged. It did not appear 
to affect the PK  of valproic acid.  Pharmacodynamic interactions were also observed 
following co- administration; these included increased impairment to cognitive function 
and increased sleepiness.  
Among adverse events (AEs) occurring in at least 2 healthy subjects in any treatment group 
in the
se studies, the following AEs were seen more frequently with co -administration than 
with Xyrem alone:  
• Zolpidem: dizziness  
• P

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
Under Amendment 5, this study is divided into two parts: Part 1 includes one year of 
treatment, and Part 2 , the Open-Label Continuation Period, provides the opportunity to 
continue treatment for up to an additional 2 years.  
Part 1 of t his study was initially designed as a dou ble-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-
withdrawal, multicenter study of the efficacy and safety of Xyrem (sodium oxybate) oral 
solution. As a result of a preplanned interim analysis, which demonstrated positive efficacy results on the primary efficacy endpoint, the protocol was  amended (Amendment 4) to 
replace the placebo treatment in the Double- Blind Treatment Period  with open- label Xyrem 
treatment . After Amendment 4 becom ing effective, all subjects entering the Double-Blind 
Treatment Period will receive open -label Xyrem treatment. For administrat ive reasons, the 
term “Double-Blind Treatment Period” will continue to be used throughout the protocol. Following the Double-Blind T reatment P eriod (2  weeks), Part 1  includes an open- label safety 
extension allowing subjects to continue Xyrem treatment for up to one year. In addition, the PK of Xyrem will be evaluated in a subset of subjects in Part 1 .  
Part 2 is an open-label continuation period, to provide continued access to Xy rem to
  subjects 
who have completed one year in the study and to monitor the long- term safety of Xyrem. 
Upon approval of Amendment 5, subjects who complete one year in the study (Part 1) may continue in Part 2, which will provide up to 2 years of additional treatment. Subjects who have already completed Part 1 prior to Amendment 5 may re -enroll in Part 2. Subjects will 
have the opportunity to continue open- label Xyrem treatment in Part 2 until the first 
occurrence of any of the following: 
• Up to an additional 2 years  
• U
ntil the subject reaches 18 years of age 
• U
ntil up to 3 months after the US FDA decision on the addition of pediatric data to the 
Xy
rem US prescribing information (PI)  
Children and adolescents, diagnosed with narcolepsy with cataplexy who are cur ren tly 
treated with Xyrem or are Xyrem naïve, with or without concomitant stable stimulant use , are 
eligible to enter the study. For this study, a Xyrem-naïve subject is defined as a subject who

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 30 of 158 3.1.1  Screening Period  
Part 1 Screening  
All subjects will be evaluated for eligibility during a Screening  Period  of up to 30 days . If 
needed, a dditional screening time may be granted with permission of the Medical Monitor. 
However, if it has been more than 45 days since the S creening safety labs pertinent to 
eligibility were drawn, these  labs may need to be repeated as instructed by the Medical 
Monitor. Eligibility screening will be performed prior to the Xyrem Open -Label Titration for 
Xyrem -naïve subjects or prior to the open -label Stable -Dose  Period for subjects already 
taking a stable dose of Xyrem and whos e cataplexy symptoms are stable.  
All subjects who are eligible for Part 1 of the study must be evaluated by polysomnography 
(PSG
) for sleep -disordered breathing during the Part 1 Screening Period.  
Blood volumes drawn during the study should not exceed the amounts recommended in the guid
ance from Seattle Children’s Hospital ( Appendix 4), European Union (EU) Guidelines 
(2008),  or ot
her local regulations. Therefore, for those subjects on Xyrem at study entry who 
have low body weight and are participating in the PK evaluation  during the Stable Dose 
Period , it is recommended that the screening blood draw be performed at the beginning of the 
Part 1 Screening Period and that the Part 1 Screening Period be as cl ose as possible to 
30 days to minimize the amount of blood drawn over 30 days.  
Part 2 Screening  
All subjects who complete Part 1 of the study are eligible to participate in Part 2. Subjects 
who re -e
nroll after completing Part 1 of the study must complete the Part 2 Screening. Part 2 
Screening will occur within 2 weeks before the first drug -dispensing visit; however, 
additional screening time may be granted with permission of the Medical Monitor , if needed . 
Subjects re- enrolling in Part 2 within 2 weeks of Visit 15 will not require clinical laboratory 
tests, urine drug screening, an alcohol test, or a serum pregnancy test at the Part 2 Screening visit (Visit 17). For these subjects, Visit 17 and the first drug -dispens ing visit (Visit 18) may 
occur on the same day. 
3.1.2  Open- Labe
 l Titration Period for Subjects who are Xyrem  naïve (up to 
10 weeks)  
For subjects who are Xyrem  naïve  or who re-enroll in Part 2 and require titration (i.e., have 
been off Xyrem for ≥ 1 month) , Xyrem therapy will be initiated based on the subjects’ weight 
as specified in Table 1. Xyrem doses are administered in two equally divided doses (see 
Secti
on 5.3).    
Subjects will be titrated on Xyrem to achieve a maximum clinical benefit in cataplexy and EDS
 while maintaining tolerability. Dose adjustment during the Part 1 Open- Label Titration 
Period and Part 2 Open -Label  Titration will proceed based on the subject’s weight to a dose 
level no higher than the maximum dose described in Table 1 in 10 weeks. The s tudy drug 
titration rate is ≤ 1 g/night/week for subjects <45 kg, and ≤ 1.5 g/night/week for subjects 
≥45 kg ( Table 1). Each dose must match a printed line on the dosing syringe ( Figure  4). Once 
t
he Xyre m dose has been optimized  per the Investigator’s judgment , the subject may enter 
the open- label Stable -Dose  Period  (for Part 1) or continue in the Open -Label Continuation 
(for Part 2) with that dose.

after bedtime, while the child is in bed, in two equally divided doses 2.5 to 4 hours apart.  
Xyrem  dose reduction is allowed for tolerability reasons at any time, at the I nvestigator’s 
discretion, in any decrement that is a multiple of 0.5 g/night. Stimulant taper and withdrawal 
may be attempted at the Investigator’s discretion during the Open -Label Ti tration Period. 
3.1.3  Open- Labe l Stable -Dose  (Stable -Dose) Period (2- 3 weeks)  
3.1.3.1  For Subjects on Xyrem at S tudy Entry  
Subjects who have been titrated to a stable dose of Xyrem prior to study entry will remain on the stable dose and regimen (i.e., two equally divided doses or two unequally divided doses) of Xyrem, and a stable stimulant dose if applicable, for 3 weeks with the exception of PK nights (if applicable) (see Section 3.1.7) . During the first week of this 3 -w
 eek period, 
subjects and/or parent(s)/guardian(s) will become familiar with methods of recor ding 
efficacy and safety data.   
3.1.3.2  For Xyrem -naïve Subjects  
Xyrem -naïve subjects w ho have been titrated to an optimal Xyrem dose and a stimulant dose 
(if applicable), during the Open- Label Titration Period, will remain on the dose that is 
established at the end of the Open -Label Titration Period for 2 weeks during the Stable -Dose  
Period. S ubjects and/ or parent(s)/guardian(s) will become familiar with the methods of 
recording efficacy and safety data during the Open -Label Titration Period.  
On the last night of the Stable -Dose  P eriod, Xyrem -naïve subjects will be assessed by PSG 
while taking Xyrem ( End of Stable- Dose/ Pre-Randomization PSG Night). [ Note: Subjects 
entering the Double- Blind Treatment Period after Amendment 4 becom ing effective will not 
be randomized, however, f or administrative reasons the terminology for this PSG will retain 
the reference to “Pre- Rando mization” .]

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32 of 158 2. Placebo : Xyrem placebo will be initiated as a double -blind treatment at a volume and 
regimen equivalent to the Xyrem dose taken in the prior 2 weeks. 
During the Double- Blind  Period, subjects will remain on  the same dosing regimen they used 
during the Stable- Dose Period , with the exception of PK nights  (if applicable) when all 
subjects have to take two equally divided doses 4 hours apart. For subjects on concomitant 
stimulant therapy, subjects will remain on the same stable stimulant dose as at the end of the Stabl e-Dose  Period during the Double- Blind  Treatment Period.  
Subjects who complete the entire 2- week D
 ouble- Blind  Treatment Period will be eligible to 
continue in the open- label Xyrem safety evaluation .  
3.1.4.2  Subjects entering the Double- Blind Treatment Period after Amendment 4 
becoming effective 
Subjects entering the Double- Blind Treatment Period after Amendment 4 becom ing effect ive 
will receive open -label Xyrem  treatment during this period. 
3.1.5  Open- Labe l Safety Period (to allow up to 1 year Xyrem exposure)  
Subjects who are eligible to participate in the Open -Lab el Safety Period will participate in 
this period for 47 weeks if they entered the study on a stable dose of Xyrem or for a period of 38-45 weeks if they entered as Xyrem naïve, depending on the duration of the titration period in which they participated (45 weeks assumes that the shortest titration period will be 3 weeks for those subjects who reach an optimal response very quickly during titration).  
All study procedures and assessments will be carried out according to the planned schedule 
(chan
ges in Xyrem dose will generally not affect the schedule).  
All subjects will be seen in the clinic 4  week s after the Open -Label Safety Period begins 
(Visit 5) and then at Weeks 18, 26, 39, and 52 from study entry (Day 1). However, if in the case of subjects who are Xyrem naïve, Visit 5 is within 2 weeks of the Week 18 visit, the first clinic visit of the Open -Label Safety Period will be the Week 18 visit.  
Subjects /parent(s)/guardian(s) will be contacted in the interim by phone at Weeks 16, 22, 30, 
34, 43, and 48 f
rom study entry (Day 1). A final PSG will be performed at Week 52 or the 
Part 1 early termination visit (if the subject who terminates early is willing to participate in another PSG night and if they ar e willing to take Xyrem the evening of the PSG ). The Part 1 
early termination PSG does not apply for subjects who discontinue before entering the Open-Label Safety Period. Clinicians may schedule clinic or phone visits between protocol-specified clinic vis its to ensure subject safety  or to accommodate PK visits  (if applicable) . 
Additional drug dispensing visits may be added as required by local law or at the Investigator’s discretion based on safe drug storage requirements. Stimulants for EDS may be used as  adjunctive therapy throughout the trial, and can be adjusted or discontinued as 
appropriate.   
For subjects who had entered the Double-Blind Treatment Period before Amendment 4 was 
eff
ective, upon entering the Open- Label Safety Period, these subjects will  be started at a dose 
no higher than half the Xyrem dose they received at the end of the Stable-Dose Period or the

their
 optimal dose as tolerated according to the Investigator’s judgment (the maximum dose 
should not exceed the doses defined in Table 1 or the stable dose prior to study entry, whic 
hever is higher, and should not be greater than 9 g/night). Xyrem dose uptitration is 
allowed at no more than 1.5 g/night, and during dose up titration the Investigator must monitor tolerability, which includes AEs observed at night, such as confusion, respiratory depression, sleepwalking and other parasomnias; residual effect and AEs observed during daytime, such as confusion, somnolence, pronounced levels of depressed consciousness, depressed mood and suicidality, anxiety, abuse or misuse of Xyrem, and weight loss. 
Subjects may take two equally divided doses or two unequally divided doses with the 
exc
eption of PK nights (if applicable) when all subjects have to take two equally divided 
doses 4 hours apart. Xyrem dose adjustment due to tolerability and efficacy is permitted. Only doses that match the printed gradations (lines) on the dosing syringe are permitted.  
3.1.6  Safety Follow -up Vi
 sit (2 weeks post Part 1 termination)   
If a subject does not complete Part 1 of the study or does not immediately continue into Part 
2, a s
afety follow -up visit will be conducted 2 weeks following the Part 1 termination visit.   
After participation in Part 1 of the study, subjects will have received up to 12 months (52 w
eeks) active treatment. The duration of Part 1  is at most 54  weeks , including the 2- week 
post-study period before the safety follow-up visit. Subjects will not be given study drug during this 2-week period but are expected to be treated for their cataplexy and EDS with any commercially available medications  as appropriate during this time by their treating 
physicians.   
See Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 for the Schedules of Events. 
3.1.7  Open- Labe
 l PK Evaluation  
At certain st udy  sites  during Part 1, eligible subjects will additionally participate in the PK 
evaluation . Subjects will be stratified to two age groups: 7 -11 years of age and 12-17 years of 
age. Up to 18 subjects in each of the two age groups will be eligible to participate in the PK 
evaluation. Every effort will be made to ensure a minimum of 12 subjects in each age group complete the PK assessments. If the variability of PK data in children and adolescents is 
comparable to that of adults, a sample size of 12 com pleters in each age group is expected to 
provide adequate precision to characterize the PK of sodium oxybate in each age group. However, when sufficient data are obtained to characterize the PK profile with adequate precision during the study, as determined by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board, or when enrollment of 100 subjects in the study has been reached, enrollment in th e PK evaluation  
will stop
 and existing data will be analyzed and reported.   
Eligible subjects will spend two nights in the clinic for the PK evaluation (PK Nights 1 and 
2). P
K evaluation will occur at any  time while subjects are on a stable dose of Xyrem.  
On PK Night 1, s ubj ects will receive one half of their usual and current total nightly Xyrem 
dose (administered as two equally divided doses, given while in bed  at bedtime and 4 hours 
later).  Subjects will return to the clinic for PK Night 2 and will receive Xyrem at their stable, usual dose (administered as two equally divided doses, given while in bed at bedtime and

therefore, if a dose cannot be measured using the lines on the dosing syringe, the dose should 
be decreased to the next lower printed line on the dosing syringe. F or example, if a subject is 
supposed to take a total dose of 4.25 g  on a PK night, then the two equally divided doses 
would be 2.125 g each. There is no printed line for 2.125 g on the dosing syringe. The next lower  line on the syringe would be 2 g (see Figure  4). The subject would then take the t wo 
e 
qually divided doses of 2 g each, which would equal a total nightly dose of 4 g. The actual 
doses taken will be recorded on the CRF.

A limited number of blood samples will be taken to measure sodium oxybate concentrations 
on each  o
f these PK nights . Samples will be taken relative to the first nightly Xyrem dose at 
0 (pre -dose), 0.75, 1.5, 2.5, and 4 hours (pre -2nd dose), to characterize the PK of the first 
dose of Xyrem, and two samples will be taken to characterize the peak and residual exposure associated with  the second dose, at 4.75 and 8 hours after the first dose of Xyrem (total blood 
volume required for PK samples is 40 mL  taken over a minimum of 2  days ). Following the 
PK nights, subjects will resume their usual Xyrem dose and regimen and their stimulant d ose, 
if applicable .  
Subject s taking two unequally divided doses ar
 e eligible to participate in the PK evaluation if 
the subject s are willing  to take two equally divided doses 4 hours apart on PK nights . The 
equally divided doses for these subjects must also match the printed lines on the dosing syringe (see above) .

3.1.8  Open-L abel  Continuation Period (Part 2)  
Upon approval of Amendment 5, subjects who have completed Part 1  in th e study may 
participate in Part 2 of the study. Subjects ongoing in the study when Amendment 5 becomes 
effective may enter Part 2 after completing the Part 1 Open -Label Safety Period, by passing 
the 2 -week Safety Follow -up Period. T hese subjects  will begin Part 2 at Visit 15. Subjects 
who have already completed Part 1 of the study may re -enroll in Part 2 . Subjects who 
re-enroll must complete the Part 2 Screening Visit. Subjects must be on a stable dose of 
Xyrem, or if they have been off Xyrem for ≥1 month, must be titrated to an effective and tolerable Xyrem dose. For subjects who have been off Xyrem for less than 1 month, titration may also be required per the Investigator’s judgment. Subj ects will be titrated to Xyrem as 
described in Section  3.1.2. In Part 2, subjects will have the opportunity to continue open-
labe
l Xyrem treatment until the first occurrence of any of the following:  
• Up to an additional 2 years 
• U
ntil the subject reaches 18 years of age  
• U
ntil up to 3 months after the US FDA decision on the addition of pediatric data to the 
Xy
rem US prescribing information (PI)  
Safety  will be assessed at scheduled visits throughout Part 2. All subjects will be seen in the 
clin
ic at the beginning of Part 2 (Visit 15 for subjects continuing and Visits 17 and 18 for 
subjects re-enrolling) and every 3 months thereafter. Subjects/parent(s)/ guardian(s) will be 
contacted in the interim months by phone. Clinicians may schedule clinic or phone visits  
between protocol- specified clinic visits to ensure subject safety. Additional drug dispensing 
visits may be added as required by local law or at th e Investigator’s discretion based on safe 
drug storage requirements. For subjects turning 18 years of age, the Part 2 Study Termination visit must be scheduled prior to the subject’s  18
th birthday. 
Subjects who re- enr oll and require titration in Part 2 will be titrated on Xyrem to achieve 
clinical benefit in cataplexy and EDS while maintaining tolerability  based on the 
Investigator’s assessment. Following Visit 18 (begin titration), the subject/parent(s)/  
guardian(s) will be contacted by phone at titration weeks T2, T3, T4, T7, T8, and T10 to determine if additional titration is necessary or to follow up after the subject has reached a stable dose. 
3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group 
A double-blind placebo controlled randomized-withdrawal study of Xyrem in adult narcolepsy patients , OMC -SXB -21, was one of the pivotal studies that supported FDA 
approval of Xyrem for the treatment of cataplexy and EDS in patients with narcolepsy. This study design ensures that all subjects are able to receive Xyrem tr eatment and minimize s the 
duration of placebo exposure. This study is being conducted under FDA’s pediatric Written Request , in which the Agency requested a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized 
withdrawal, multicenter study of the efficacy and safe ty of sodium oxybate, combined with 
an open-label evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of sodium oxybate, and an open- label

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 36 of 158 safety evaluation with combined time of sodium oxybate treatment of up to one year (and 
potentially more than one year in some subjects participating in a continuation of the open-label safety evaluation ) in pediatric patients who have narcolepsy with cataplexy. Placebo is 
the only control group used in this study, there are no other medications approved for the treatment of cataplexy.  In this study, the maximal time that any pediatric subject will be 
exposed to placebo is 2 weeks.    
As a result of a preplanned interim analysis, which demonstrated positive efficacy results on the pr
imary efficacy endpoint, the protocol has been amended (Amendment 4) to replace 
placebo  treatment in the Double -Blind Treatment Period  with open- label Xyrem treatment . 
After Amendment 4 becom ing effective, all subjects entering the Double- Blind Treatment 
Period will receive open -label Xyrem treatment during this period.  
Part 2 is an open-label continuation period, to provide continued access to Xyrem to subjects who have
 completed one year in the study and to monitor the long- term safety of Xyrem.  
3.3 Study Duration 
It is anticipated that enrollment in Part 1 will be completed within 2 years. Following the Part 
1 Screening Period of up to 30 days ( if needed, additional time may be granted with 
permission of the Medical Monitor), the expected duration of study participation for each subject in Part 1 will be approxim ately 54 weeks , including a 2- week safety follow -up 
period. Under Amendment  5, subjects may continue on in Part 2, the Open -Label 
Continuation Period, after 52 weeks in Part 1, bypassing the 2- week Safety Follow -up 
Period, or they may re -enroll in Part 2 after completing Part 1 . Subjects may participate  in 
Part 2 for up to an additional 2 years  or until they reach 18 years of age or for up to 3 months 
after the US FDA decision on the addition of pediatric data to the Xyrem US PI, whiche ver 
occurs first . Therefore, a subject’s duration of participation in Part 2 will be up to 2 years. 
4 STUDY POPULATION SEL ECTION  
4.1 Study Population 
The study will enroll pediatric subjects who are diagnosed with narcolepsy with cataplexy, who have provided ass ent, and whose parent(s) or guardian(s) have signed the informed 
consent form  in accordance with local IRB/IEC requirements . At least 100 subjects will be 
enrolled in the study. E very effort will be made to enroll approximately  30 subjects on 
Xyrem at study entry of the anticipated 100 subjects enrolled. O ther subjects enrolled will be 
Xyrem naïve at study entry . 
A subset of the subjects who are taking Xyrem at a stable dose for their narcolepsy symptoms will pa
rticipate in the PK evaluation  during Part  1. Up to 18 subjects in each of the two age 
groups (7-11 year olds and 12-17 year olds) will be enrolled. Every effort will be made  to 
ensure a minimum of 12 subjects in each age group  complete the PK assessments .  However, 
when sufficient data are obtained to characterize the PK profile with adequate precision during the study, as determined by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board, or when

5 STUDY TREATMENT(S)  
5.1 Description of Treatment 
Xyrem® (sodium oxybate) oral solution, 500 mg/mL 
Xyrem Placebo: a sodium citrate solution prepared in equimolar concentration to sodium in 
the 500 
mg/mL Xyrem (sodium oxybate) oral solution and pH adjusted with malic acid  
(Placebo treatment only applicable to subjects who had already entered the Double-Blind Treatment prior to  Amendment 4 becoming effective).  
The bioequivalence of the study drug prepared in a flavored diluent versus prepared in water has b
een evaluated , and bioequivalence has been established . If available, a flavor ant that can 
be added to the water  that is used as diluent will be provided for study drug preparation if 
flavored diluent is requested by the subject/parent/guardian for palatability.  Sucralose in the 
flavorant is equivalent to 28 mg sucralose in 60 mL, or 56 mg per daily intake of Xyrem prepared with flavored diluent. The FDA acceptable daily intake (ADI)  for sucralose  is 
5 mg/kg body weight/day ( Federal Register, Vol. 63, No. 64, 1998) and the European Union 
ADI is 0 – 15 mg/kg body weight ( SCF/CS/ADDS/EDUL/ 190 Final 12/9/2000).  
5.2 Treatment Administered 
Subjects who have been titrated to a stable dose of Xyrem prior to study entry will remain on their stable dose and regimen of Xyrem for 3 weeks during the Stable-Dose Period. 
Xyrem -naïve subjects  en
 tering Part 1 and subjects re-enrolling in Part 2 who have been off 
Xyrem for ≥1 month will be titrated on Xyrem over a period of up to 10 weeks. Xyrem doses 
are administered in two equally divided doses 2.5 to 4 hours apart. Dose initiation and titration will be based on the subject’s weight as described in Table 1. Dose adjustment during
 the Part 1 and Part 2 titration per iods will proceed at a rate of ≤1 g/night/week for 
subjects <45 kg, and ≤1.5 g/night/week for subjects ≥45 kg, to a dose level no higher than the maximum dose described in Table 1. Once the Investigator is satisfied that the Xyrem dose has be
en optimized, the subject may enter the 2- week  Stable -Dose  Period  if in Part 1 of the 
study or continue the Open -Label Continuation Period if in Part  2.   
At the end of the Stable -Dose  P eriod, subjects who had entered  the Double-Blind Period 
prior to Amendment 4 becoming effective were randomized 1:1 to receive either Xyrem or Xyrem placebo during the Double- Blind  Treatment Period as follows:

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 of 158 • Xyrem: Active  Xyrem will be continued as a double- blind treatment at the stable dose 
taken  and regimen used in the previous 2 weeks  
• Placebo: Xyrem placebo will be initiated as a double -blin d treatment at a volume and 
regimen equivalent to that of the stable dose of X yrem taken in the previous 2 weeks.  
During the Double-Blind Period, subjects will remain on the same dosing regimen they used 
during
 the Stable- Dose Period , with the exception of PK nights  (if applicable) when all 
subjects have to take two equally divided doses 4 hours apart. 
Subjects entering the Double-Blind Treatment Period after Amendment 4 becom ing ef fective 
will receive open -label Xyrem treatment during this period. 
During the Part 1 Open -Label  Safety Period and following titration in  the Part 2 Open -Label 
Continuation Period subjects may take two equally divided doses or two unequally divided 
doses with the exception of PK nights, if applicable. Xyrem dose adjustment due to 
tolerability and efficacy  is permitted. Xyrem dose uptitration is allowed at no more than 
1.5 g/night. Only doses that match the printed gradations (lines) on the dosing syringe are permitted . 
Study Drug will be dispensed at clinic  vis
 its and, if applicable, at intervals specified by State 
or local regulations. Xyrem d oses on PSG  and PK nights will be administered by or under the 
supervision of qualified study site personnel. Each Xyrem dose will be diluted with 60  mL of 
water . On PK nights, Xyrem doses will be followed by 180 mL of water. S ubject s will 
continue to take their usual nightly dose of Xyrem on non- PSG and non- PK nights.  
The actual time of dosing for each dose administered on PSG and PK nights will be recorded. 
5.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject 
In the studies reported in the literature, Xyrem doses used in children and adolescents were generally lower than the mean dose reported in adults (7.5 g/night). In one of these published studies, children with pre-pubertal onset of narcolepsy took a lower maximal Xyrem dose than those with peri- or post-pubertal onset ( Aran et al. 2010).  
Data from the Central Pharmacy that dispenses Xyrem in the US also indicate that most chil
dren take lower doses than adults, as would be expected if there were no great differences 
in metabolism between children  and adults and if effective doses were generally based on a 
mg/kg dose.  
Proposed starting doses and titration increments based on weight will be assessed in this 
stu
dy (Table  1).  
So
dium oxybate has a half -li fe of approximately 0.5 to 1 hour. Pharmacologic doses of 
sodium oxybate have clinical sedative effects that typically last 2 to 4 hours. Sodium oxybate in divided nightly doses has been studied in patients with narcolepsy and patients with 
fibromyalgia.  
For this study, doses will be taken twice nightly. Each divided dose must match a printed line 
on the dos
ing syringe that is provided. D oses may be taken  at the following times : 
• When the first dose can be taken at bedtime, the first dose should be taken at bedtime  
whi
le in bed, and the second dose should be taken 2.5 to 4 hours later.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 of 158 • When the first dose cannot be taken at bedtime, the first dose should be taken after 
bedtime  while in bed , and the second dose should be taken 2.5 to 4 hours later.  
Investigators should caution subjects about operating hazardous machinery, including 
autom
obiles or airplanes, or going to school alone until subjects are reasonably certain that 
study d rug does not affect them adversely (e.g., impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills). 
Subjects should not engage in hazardous occupations or activities requiring complete mental alertness or motor coordination, such as operating machinery or a motor vehic le or flying an 
airplane, for at least 6 hours after taking the second nightly dose of study drug. 
On PK Night 1 , subje
 cts in the PK evaluation will receive one half of their usual (stable) total 
nightly Xyrem dose (administered as two equally divided dose s, given at bedtime and 
4 hours later while in bed ). On PK Night 2 , PK subjects will receive the ir usual nightly dose 
(administered as two equally divided doses, given at bedtime and 4  hours later while in bed). 
Subjects whose equally divided dose does not match a line on the dosing syringe will take the 
dose that matches the next lowe r printed line  on the dosing syringe (see Section 3.1.7). Blood 
samp
les for PK assessment collected on these PK nights will allow assessment of dose 
proportionality within subjects.   
5.4 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
At the beginning of the Double- Blind  Treatment  Period , subjects  who enter ed this period 
prior to Amendment 4 becoming effective had been  randomized to either Xyrem at the stable 
dose established in the previous 2 weeks o r to Xyrem placebo at a volume equivalent to the 
Xyrem dose that was established  in the previous 2 weeks.  During the Double-Blind Period, 
subjects will remain on the same dosing regimen they used during the Stable-Dose Period, 
with the exception of PK nights  (if applicable) when all subjects have to take two equally 
divided doses 4 hours apart . 
Subjects who enter the Double- Blind  Treatment Period after Amendment 4 becom ing 
effective will receive open -label Xyrem treatment.  
5.5 Randomization  
Randomization only applies to subjects who had entered  the Double- Blind Randomized-
Withdrawal Perio d prior to Amendment 4 becoming effective. 
Prior to Amendment 4, a statistician selected by Jazz Pharmaceuticals specified a dynamic random
ization algorithm to assign treatments for the double-blind portion of the trial. The 
randomization will balance treatment assignment  for each age group (7 to  11 years and 12 to 
17 years) , for prior Xyrem usage (subjects on Xyrem at study entry and Xyrem- naïve 
subjects), and for location (US and ex- US). 
If emergency unblinding is required, for subjects who entered the double-blind period prior to Am
endment 4 becoming effective, the double- blind treatment assignment will be provided 
to the Investigator by an Interactive Voice Recognition System (IVRS) or I nteractive Web 
Response System (IWRS) . The treatment assignments for approximately 35 subjects were

available to the DSMB upon request to address safety concerns. Al l treatment assignments 
will be generally available upon final unblinding of the double-blind portion of the study.   
5.6 Blinding 
Blinding only applies to subjects who had entered the Double-Blind Randomized-Withdrawal Period before Amendment 4 becoming effec tive.  A double-blind approach had 
been used  during the Double- Blind  Treatment Period  for subjects entering this period before 
Amendment 4 becom ing effective. Xyrem and Xyrem placebo oral solution were matched  in 
volume, flavor, and appearance to ensure adequate blinding.  
5.7 Concomitant Therapy 
In this study, the following medications are prohibited: 
• Benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics/hypnotics/sedatives, neuroleptics, opioi
ds, barbiturates, diclofenac, valproate, phenytoin, and ethosuximide are 
prohibited during the study and must have been discontinued within 2 weeks prior to the beginning of the Stable- Dose Perio d for subjects on Xyrem at study entry and the 
beginning of the Open-Label Titration Period for Xyrem- naïve subjects. 
(Discontinuation for the purpose of study enrollment is only permitted if considered safe by the Investigator and approved by the Medical Monitor.) If a subject undergoes  
short-term out-patient procedures during the study and requires opioids or 
benzodiazepine use, study drug may be held for one night while these drugs are given. If opioid or benzodiazepine use is required for multiple days, the subject should be discontinued from the study.  
• Other anticataplectic therapies (e.g., SNRI, SSRI, or T
 CA) are prohibited during Part 
1 and must have been discontinued within 1 month before Part 1 Screening . 
(Discontinuation for the purpose of study enrollment is only permitted if considered safe by the Investigator and approved by the Medical Monitor.)

administration.  
5.8 Restrictions 
5.8.1  Prior Therapy  
In addition to Xyrem and stimulant treatment at study entry, s ubjec ts may continue 
prescri ption and OTC medications with the exception of the prohibited medications listed in 
Section 5.7. Also, subjects who used any other investigational drug within 30 days or five half- 
lives (whichever is longer) before Part 1 or Part 2 Screening , or plan to use an 
investigational drug (other than the study drug) during the study will not be allowed to enter the study. 
5.8.2  Fluid and Food Intake  
For 
all PSG a nd PK nights, with the exception of the Screening PSG for Xyrem -naïve 
subjects :  
During PSG and PK nights, a ll subjects will be required to eat a light dinner 2 hours before 
dosing and refrain from caffeinated products.  A light dinner may be provided at home or at 
the study site , but must be eaten at least 2 hours before dosing . The light dinners on each 
PSG or PK  night should be of the same or similar content. The Investigator will verify with 
the parent or guardian that a light dinner was consumed by the subject. Subjects will take 
Xyrem  (diluted with 60 mL of  water or flavored diluent  if requested and available ); subjects 
in the PK group will follow the diluted Xyrem with 180 mL of water. Following the light dinner, no food will be allowed until the following morning, approximately 8 hours after the 
first dose of Xyrem . Water is allowed at night, but may not be taken 1 hour before or after 
dosing during the PK nights. If the subject prefers to eat breakfast at  the study center after the 
PSG or PK  nigh t, a breakfast will be provided.

products prior to the Screening PSG. Following the subject’s dinner, no food will be allowed 
until the following morning; however, subjects may drink water during the night if desired. If the subject prefers to eat breakfast at the study center after the PSG night, a breakfast will be provided.  
5.8.3  Subject Activity Restrictions  
Subjects sh ould t
 ake study drug while in bed and lie down immediately after dosing as 
Xyrem may cause them to fall asleep abruptly without first feeling drowsy.  
On PSG and PK nights, all subjects who receive study drug should remain in bed after the 
firs
t Xyrem dose  for at least 8 hours. If it is necessary for subjects to move about during this 
time, they must be assisted.  
5.9 Treatment Compliance 
The number of bottles of clinical study medication dispensed will be recorded on the investigational medicine record by the designated staff member. The volume of solution dispensed and returned will be recorded on the investigational medicine record. In addition, subjects  (if needed, with the help of caregiver) will complete a n electronic Study Drug 
Dosing Diary ( Appendix 12) every  morning throughout Part 1  to doc
 ument that doses of 
study drug were taken overnight and an electronic Stimulant Dosing Diary ( Appendix 13) 
ever
y evening through the Double- Blind Treatment Period to document that their regular 
stimulant dose was taken, if applicable, during the day). Compliance will be assessed throughout the trial based on a subject’s prescribed dose, data recorded in the subject’s Dosing Diaries (Part 1 only), and volume of solution returned. 
On PSG and PK nights, Xyrem will be administered by and taken in the presence of study 
pers
onnel. Compliance with drug adm inistration will be confirmed by watchin g the subjects 
swallowing the solution.  
5.10 Drug Discrepancies 
Study personnel will note if there is a significant difference in the actual volume and/or amount of study drug returned at each visit compared with the volume and/or amount expected to be returned. If such a difference is found, study personnel will take appropriate action, which may include checking the subject’s/parent(s)/guardian(s) dosing technique, re-educating the subject/parent(s)/guardian(s) on proper dosing, and/or addressing potential abuse and/or diversion. 
5.11 Packaging and Labeling 
Jazz Pharmaceuticals will provide the clinical site with a supply of Xyrem (sodium oxybate) oral solution, 500 mg/mL, for use during all phases of the study. Xyrem placebo (sodium citrate oral solution) was  supplied for use during the Double- Blind  Treatment Period  for 
subjects entering this period prior to Amendment 4 becoming effective. The flavorant will

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 47 of 158 also be provided, if available , to the clinical site . The flavored diluent will consist of a 
commercially available flavored unsweetened beverage mix sweetened with sucralose and 
added to water. 
All packaging and labeling operations of Xyrem and Xyrem placebo will be performed 
acc
ording to current Good Manufacturing Practices ( cGMPs) and Good Clinical Practices 
(GCPs).   
5.12 Storage and Accountability  
All study medications will be stored, inventoried, reconciled, and retained or destroyed according to applicable state and federal regulations and  instructions from Jazz 
Pharmaceuticals. Xyrem must be stored according to regulations for a Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA) Schedule III controlled substance  in the US and  according to any 
other regional regulations that apply . Jazz Pharmaceuticals will specify the conditions under 
which drug is stored. 
The Investigator or designated pharmacist will maintain accurate records of receipt of all 
st
udy drugs, including dates of dispensing and receipt. At the study site, s tudy drug supplies 
must be kept in a secure ar ea and dispensed according to the protocol. Unused (or partially 
used) supplies must be accounted for on the drug inventory record. Receipt and dispensing of 
all study drugs must be documented throughout the study and reconciled at study completion. The Investigator must provide a written explanation for any missing study drug. After review 
of study drug accountability logs at study completion, one copy of the drug inventory record will be retained by the site  and the other inventory record will be retained by the sponsor in 
the Study Master File.  
All labels, bottles, and unused Xyrem and Xyrem placebo  must
  be destroyed or returned to 
Jazz Pharmaceuticals according to written instructions from Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its 
designee at the completion of the study for reconciliation and destruction. Used bottles of study drug will be destroyed upon Jazz Pharmaceuticals’ instruction following the review of study drug accountability. The Investigator must provide a written explanation for any missing study drug.  
5.13 Investigational Product Retention at Study Site 
Following study completion and notification by the Sponsor, investigational products (Xyrem and Xyrem placebo) do not need to be retained at the study site for FDA testing purposes. 
6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 Assent and Informed Consent 
All subjects will provide assent and their parent(s) or guardian (s) will give written informed 
consent in accordance with local IRB/IEC requirements  before the performance of any study 
related procedures.

form ( ICF, most current version, if applicable) signed by the parent or guardian for study 
participation , and for PK evaluation if applicable,  attached to it. When the study treatment is 
completed and the CRF has been monitored, the assent documentation and the ICF will be 
kept in the I nvestigator’s central study file.  
6.2 Demographics 
Demographics will be collected at Part 1 Screening. T he date of  the subject’s assent and the 
date the parent or guardian signed the ICF will be collected . The date of the assent/consent 
for PK evaluation will also be collected;  however, it may be after Part 1 Screening as long as 
the assent/consent is obtained before participation in the PK evaluation. Demographi cs will 
include the subject’s age (as indicated by date of birth, month and year of birth, year of birth, 
or age at screening, as required by regional or national regulations), sex, ethnicity, and race.   
Contact information of the parent or guardian will be obtained at Part 1 Screening and 
confi
rmed on admission to the s leep l aboratory on the PSG nights and to the clinic on PK 
nights. Contact information will be updated at Part 2 Screening. This information will not be collected by the Sponsor. 
6.3 Medical History 
The subject’s medical history will be taken at Part 1 Screening to ensure suitability of each 
subject for enrollment. Past (prior to any narcolepsy treatment) and current  symptoms of 
narcolepsy including cataplexy, EDS , hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and DNS  will be 
recorded. The subject’s usual Xyrem regimen, if applicable, including how Xyrem is prepared, usual times taken , and the usual bedtime and awakening time will also be recorded. 
The Investigator will assess the severity of the subject’s cataplexy and narcolepsy overall 
prior to any treatment by completing a clinical global impression of  severity (CGIs) for 
historical narcolepsy overall and a CGIs for historical cataplexy  severity (see Section 6.6.7).  
If a s 
ubject re-enrolls in Part 2, their previously recorded medical history will be reviewed 
and updated. In addition, any new medical history that occurs after the last Part 1 study visit 
(Visit 16 ) and prior to re- enrollment will be recorded.  This would include any new clinically 
significant condition with onset after Visit 16 until assent/consent in Part 2.  
6.4 Physical Examination 
A full review of body systems should be obtained on each subject. Physical examinations will be conducted at the Part 1 Screening Visit, the end of the Double- Blind Treatment 
Period, and at Visit 15 (Week 52 or Part 1 early termination) and will include a full examination of body systems (except a breast and genitourinary examination  other than the 
observational evaluation needed for the Tanner Stage Assessment ; Appendix 5) , a brief 
neur
ological examination, and height and body weight measurements.   
An additional brief neurological exam will be performed prior to allowing the subject to be disc
harged the mornin g after PSG and PK nights  (not applicable for the screening PSG for 
subjects who are naïve to Xyrem) .

A physical examination will also  be co nducted at the Part 2 Screening visit and will include a 
full examination of body systems (except a breast and genitourinary examination), a brief 
neurological examination, and height and body weight measurements. 
6.5 Vital Signs and Pulse Oximetry 
Vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse/heart and respiratory rate, and body temperature) will be monitored and recorded on the CRF after the subject has been resting for at least 5 minutes. Vital signs will be collected at each o nsite visit in both Part 1 and 
Part 2 (Appendix 1, Appendix 2, Appendix 22, Appendix 23, and Appendix 24).   
On P
SG nights, vital signs will be measured at the times specified in the schedules of events 
(Appendix 1.2 [subjects on Xyrem at study entry] and  Appendix 2.3 [Xyrem -naïve 
su
bjects] ). While the subject is being monitored with PSG, the respiratory and heart rate will 
be captured as part of the PSG parameters. At times when the subject is not undergoing PSG , 
the respiratory rate will be  counted by visual inspection of thoracic movement and will be 
assessed over 30 seconds, and the pulse /heart  rate will be taken .  
On PK nights, vital signs will be measured at the time s s pecified in the schedule of events for 
PK nights ( Appendix 3).  
Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry will be measured while the subject is fully awake on room
 air and recorded at Part 1 Screening and on the mornings prior to discharge following 
PSG (excl uding screening PSG for Xyrem- naïve subjects)  and PK nights .  
On PSG n ights , for  subjects receiving study drug, oxygen saturation (SpO 2) will be 
monitored continuously via PSG from the time immediately before  the first dose through 
8 hours after the first dose and will be recorded pre-dose and at 1 h, 2 h, 4 h (pre -2nd dose), 
5 h, 6 h, and 8 h after the first dose  (Appendix 1.2 and Appendix 2.3). During the screening 
PSG
 for subjects who are Xyrem naïve, SpO 2 will be monitored as part of the PSG 
parameters to determine obstruct ive sleep apnea (OSA) status. End tidal CO 2 (EtCO 2) or 
transcutaneous CO 2 (TcCO 2) will be monitored and recorded at sites where monitoring is 
routinely performed and performance will not negatively impact study conduct. 
On PK nights, SpO 2 will be monitored continuously by pulse oximetry from the time 
immediately before the first dose through 8 hours after the first dose and will be recorded at 
the time s specified in the Schedule of Events for PK nights ( Appendix 3).  
6.6 Other Assessments  
6.6.1  Epworth Sleepiness Scale for Children and Adolescents (ESS  [CHAD])  
The ESS is a self - administered questionnaire with 8 questions. It provides a measure of a 
person’s general level of daytime sleepiness, or their average sleep propensity in daily life.  It 
has been validated in narcolepsy and has demonstrated both a high specificity and sensitivity  
(Johns 1991, 2000). In t he ESS  (CHAD) for children and adol escents  (Appendix 6) , the third  
activ
ity was modified to  adapt to a school setting, the fourth activity was shortened from

seventh activity was  modified to  delete the mention of alcohol, and the eighth activity was

aced by the activity of sitting and eating a meal to avoid the redundancy to the fourth 
activity . 
6.6.2  SF-10 Healt h Survey for Children  
The SF -10™ Health Survey for Children ( Appe ndix 7) is a parent -com pleted survey that 
contains 10 questions adapted from the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ). The SF-10 provides coverage across a wide range of domains, and is scored to produce physical and psychosocial health summary measures. This survey is intended for children between the ages of 5 and 18, and is available with a standard 4- week recall period.  
6.6.3  Columbia- Sui
 cide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The C -SSRS is a widely used measure of suicidal ideation and behavior ( Appe ndix 8). The 
inst
rument reliably predicts a potential suicide attempt in those who had previously attempted 
suicide and is able to determine clinically meaningful points at which a person may be at risk for an impending suicide attempt ( Posner et al. 2011). The C-SSRS is available in versions 
for children and adolescents and for use in clinical trials. The C -SSRS Children’s 
Baseline/Screening and the C -SSRS Children’s Since Last Visit versions will b e used in this 
study for subjects under 12 years of age. The Baseline/Screening and Since Last Visit versions will be used for subjects 12 years of age and older (Posner et al. 2011 and personal communication).  
6.6.4  Children’s Depression Inventory 2
nd Edition  Self-Report Short Version 
(CDI 2:SR[S])   
The Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) is a widely used pediatric self- repo rt depressive 
symptoms assessment in clinical trials ( Myers & Winters 2002). It is a comprehensive 
assessment of depressive symptoms in youth ages 7 to 17 years. The second edition of the 
CDI Self -Report (CDI 2:SR) contains 28 items to cover the age-appropriate depressive 
symptoms which cover affective, cognitive, motivational, neuroveg etative, and secondary 
impairment domains. It covers the criterion symptoms of major depressive disorder and 
dysthymic disorder as operationalized in the DSM -IV. The CDI 2:SR[S] ( Appendix 9) is the 
short
 form of CDI 2:SR. It contains 12 items and takes about half the time of the full -
length  version to administer (5 –10 minutes). The short report form covers primarily affective, 
cognitive, and neurov egetative aspects of depression. It has been shown that the Total Score 
of the CDI  2:SR[S ] is highly correlated to  a Total Score on the selected items of the full-
length version ( Kovacs 2011). Due to its brevity, the CDI 2:SR[S] is a suitable screening 
assessment ; however, this scale is not validated in pediatric patients with narcolepsy. Many 
narcolepsy symptoms overlap with items assessed in the CDI 2:SR[S], e.g., feeling tired, not having fun (in order to control cataplexy attacks); therefore, this sc ale is used only as a 
screening assessment for the risk of depression in this study. 
6.6.5  Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children 10-ite
 m (MASC -10) 
The MASC -10, a short version of the MASC, is a multidimen sion al measure with ten items 
that combine the basic anxiety scales from the long version to produce one score that

6.6.6  Cataplexy Frequency Diary  
Th
e subject  (if  needed, with the help of caregiver) will complete a cataplexy frequency diary 
(Appendix 11) daily in the evening during Part 1 to record the daily frequency of the 
sub
ject’s cataplexy attacks ( Appendix 1 and Appendix 2).  
6.6.7  Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGIs) Ques tionnaires  
Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGIs) is a 7 -poin t Likert rating scale  and is a widely 
used assessment in clinical psychopharmacology trials to assess severity of illness.  The 
responses of this investigator- completed scale range from 1 = normal , no signs of illness, to 
7 = among the most extremely ill patients. Using the questionnaires described below, 
Investigators will rate their impression of the severity of the subject’s condition before the subject received any narcolepsy treatment (historical) and the severity of the subject’s current condition at specified times during Part 1 of the study. 
6.6.7.1  CGIs for Historical Narcolepsy Overall Severity Prior to any Narcolepsy 
Treatment  
At Part 1 Screening (Visit 1), Investigators will rate their impression of the severity of the subject’s narcolepsy overall prior to any na rcolepsy treatment ( Appendix 15).  
6.6.7.2  CGIs for Historical Cataplexy Severity Prior to any Narcolepsy Treatment  
At Part 1 Screening (Visit 1), Investigators will rate their impression of the severity of the subject’s cataplexy prior to any narcolepsy treatment ( Appendix 16).  
6.6.7.3  CGIs for Narcolepsy Ove rall (current condition)  
Investigators will rate their impression of the subject’s current severity of narcolepsy overall at the following time points: Part 1 Screening (Visit 1), the start of the Stable -Dose Period 
(Visit 2 [for subjects on Xyrem at study  entry]) or beginning of titration (Visit 1.1 [for

A standard 12-lead ECG will be recorded with the subject resting supi ne for at least 
5 minutes at Part 1 Screening  (Visit 1), the End of the Double- Blind  Treatment Period  
(Visit 4), and the final Part 1 visit (Visit 15) or Part 1 early termination . 
6.8 Polysomnography (PSG) 
A PSG will be performed on PSG nights according to a standard protocol, which will be 
provided in a manual to each site, at the times specified in the schedules of events. The manual will include all parameters to be recorded, methods, and a scoring appendix. Oxygen saturation will be monitored according to the study center’s standard procedures. Cardiac rhythm strips (over 30 seconds), closest to the specified time points with minimum artifact, will be extracted from the PSG data by the core lab.  
Standard PSG parameters will be recorded. The PSG parameters  of int
 erest include: 
• Apnea Index ( AI) a nd Apnea Hypopnea Index ( AHI) 
• SpO 2 (mean and nadir) 
EtCO 2 or TcCO 2 will be recorded at sites where monitoring is routinely performed, provided 
it does not negatively impact participation or PSG data integrity . In addition, c ardiac r hythm 
strips (30 seconds) will be obtained at 1 h, 4 h ( pre-2nd dose), 5 h, and 8 h after the first 
Xyrem dose for subjects on Xyrem during the PSG.  
Study Personnel on PSG Nights : A ph ysician, either the Investigator or a Sub-investigator, 
must be on call and be readily available during PSG nights. An experienced sleep 
technologist must be present to monitor the PSG during PSG nights.  
Multiple Sleep L aten cy Test (MSLT ): If the subject has never been diagnosed with 
narcolepsy with cataplexy and meets all ICSD -3 Type 1 narcolepsy criteria A and B1 at 
Part 1 Screening  other than the MSLT, an MSLT can be conducted during Part 1 Screening , 
with the permission of the Medical Monitor, to confirm the diagnos is of narcolepsy with 
cataplexy . 
The ICSD -3 diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy with cataplexy are as follows (Type 1, the 
I

exceed 3% of the total blood volume during a period of 4 weeks and should not exceed 1% at 
any single time.  Specific guid elines may vary, but a commonly used guidanc e from Seattle 
Children’s Hospital ( Appendix 4) recommends  no more  than 2.5% of total blood volume in 
one blood draw and no more than 5% of the total blood volume in a 30- day period. To ensure 
that the total blood loss (including PK samples , samples for clinical labs, and any procedural 
losses) will not exceed the Seattle Children’s Hospital’s recommendation , EU Guidelines, or 
any particular investigational site IRB or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) eligibility guidelines for pediatric blood draws relevant to that site, the following time periods  should 
be maximized for subjects with low body weight participating in the P K evaluation to 
minimize the amount of blood drawn over 30 days : the Screening Period for subjects on 
Xyrem at study entry , and t he time from Visit 4 to PK Night 1 and from PK Night 2 to 
Visit 15 for all subjects who participate in PK evaluations during th e Open -Label Safety 
Period .  
6.9.2  Sample Collection, Storage, and Shipping  
A l
ocal topical anesthetic agent such as lidocaine/tetracaine (Synera) topical patch, or 
lidoc
aine/prilocaine cream (EMLA) may be applied 20-30 minutes or 60-120 minutes, 
respectively,  prior to venipuncture or placement of an indwelling catheter per the site’s usual 
procedures. If a numbing preparation wi ll be used, the study staff will confirm that the 
subject is not allergic to the preparation prior to the application. Screening blood s amples 
will be obtained by venipuncture. An indwelling catheter for obtaining blood samples for PK assessment will be placed in subjects participating in the PK evaluation  on PK night s. If the 
catheter becomes non-functional (e.g., clogged  or infiltrated) , a second indwelling catheter 
may be placed ; however, if the attempt to insert this second catheter fails , the PK blood 
sample collection for that night will be discontinued.   
6.9.2.1  Clinical Laboratory Test Samples  
The laboratory will supply detailed instructio ns and all containers for blood and urine 
investigations. Blood and urine sample volumes will meet the laboratory’s specifications.  
The actual time of blood collection for all samples will be recorded . 
6.9.2.2  Blood Samples for Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
For s ubject s participating  in the PK evaluation , blood samples (2  mL) to measure plasma 
sodium oxybate concentrations will be colle cted on two  PK nights  (PK Night 1  and PK  
Night  2) at 0 (pre -dose), 0.75, 1.5, 2.5, 4 (pre-2nd dose), 4.75, and 8 hours after the first dose. 
PK samples will be taken within ±5 minutes of the specified time points.  The actual time of 
blood collection for all samples will be recorded .  
Study Personnel on PK Nights:  A p hysician, either the Investigator or a Sub -investigator, 
must be on call and be readily available during PK nights. An individual skilled in pediatric venous catheter placement must be present on PK nights when blood samples will be collected and processed for  PK evaluation. 
To determine sodium oxybate concentrations, blood samples will be drawn according to the tim
e points specified and dispensed into labeled sodium heparin tubes.

start of the Stable -Dose Perio d (Visit 2). For subject who re- enroll in Part 2, study drug will 
be dispensed at Visit 18. Study drug will be dispensed at study visits, excluding phone visits, according to the schedules of events ( Appendix 1, Appendix 2, Appendix 22, Appendix 23, 
and Appe 
ndix 24).  
Study drug doses should be prepared with the dosing dispenser (syringe) that is supplied in the st
udy drug kit (dosing instructions provided by Jazz Pharmaceuticals). Instructions for 
dose administration of the study drug will be provided to subjects /paren t(s)/guardian(s) by 
the site personnel.  
Flavorant will be provided if available for study drug preparation if flavored diluent is 
reques
ted by the subject and deemed appropriate by the Investigator  (excluding PSG and PK 
nights). Instructions for preparation of study drug with flavored diluent will be supplied if flavored diluent is to be used. Additional drug dispensing visits will be made as required by State or local regulations.  
On all PSG  and PK n
 ights , study drug will be administered by  or under the supervision of

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 61 of 158 6.11 Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
The PK profile for two doses of Xyrem will be e valuated over an 8 -hour period in a subset of 
subjects on two PK nights. The PK parameters for plasma sodium oxybate concentrations 
will include, but may not be limited to: the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC), maximum plasma drug concentration (C
max), and time to maximum plasma drug 
concentration (T max), over the first 4 -hour dosing interval. In addition, sodium oxybate 
concentrations at 4.75 hours (0.75 hours after the 2nd dose) and 8 hours (4 h ours after the 
2nd dose) will be measured to estimate peak and residual exposure associated with the second  nighttime dose. Dose proportionality will be based on the ratio of AUC values for 
each subject. Pharmacokinetics will be summarized for the 7 -11 and 12-17 year age  groups, 
and a comparison to historical PK data in adults will also be made. 
The blood sampling schedule and calculation of required number of patients needed to meet 
the o

Any new clinically significant condition  w ith onset after the last Part 1 visit (Visit 16) until 
assent/consent is provided in Part 2 sh ould be recorded as medical history. 
An AE is any untoward medi cal occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans , 
whether or not considered related to study drug or procedure. During the study, clinically significant adverse changes in clinical st atus, ECGs, routine laboratory tests, and physical 
examinations are considered AEs. Any subject complaint associated with such an abnormal finding will also be reported as an AE. Symptoms of narcolepsy are not considered as adverse events unless there is an exacerbation of the symptoms from baseline (Visit 1 for Part 1 and Visit 17 for subjects who re-enroll in Part 2 ). 
Adverse events include, but are not limited to: (1) a worsening or change in nature, severity, or fr
equency of conditions present at baseli ne (Visit 1 for Part 1 and Visit 17 for subjects

illness; (4) drug interaction; and/or (5) abnormal clinically significant laboratory values.  
Subjects should be questioned in a general way, without asking about the occurrence of any 
spec
ific symptom. The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based 
on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
Following questioning and evaluation, all AEs, whether believed by the I nve
 stigator to be 
related or unrelated to the study drug or procedure, must be documented in the subject’s 
medical records, in accordance with the Investigator’s normal clinical practice, and on the 
AE CRF. Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, intensity, seriousness, and causal relationship to the study drug or procedure. An AE is deemed to be a suspected adverse drug reaction  if there is a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by the drug (or 
medicinal product) or study procedure as defined in Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 CFR 312.32 [a] and ICH E2A II.A.2. 
6.12.1.1  Severity  
Adverse events will be classified by the Investigator as mild, moderate, or severe as defined  
below. When the intensity of the AE changes over time, the change in intensity will be  
recorded  on the AE CRF as a new AE . 
Mild  Symptom(s) b arely noticeable to subject or does not make subject 
uncomfortable; does not influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not ordinarily needed for relief of symptom(s) but may be given. 
Moderate  Symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make subj ect uncomfortable; 
performance of daily activities is influenced; treatment for symptom(s) may be needed.  
Severe  Symptom(s) causes severe discomfort; symptom(s) incapacitate or 
significantly affect subject’s daily life; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or subject hospitalized.  
 
6.12.1.2  Relationship to Study Drug or Procedure  
The Investigator’s assessment of an AE’ s relationship to study drug or procedure is part of 
the documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported . The relationship or association of the study drug or procedure in causing or 
contributing to the AE will be characterized using the following classification and criteria:

Suspected to 
be Related to Study Drug or Procedure Some temporal relationship exists between the event and the 
administration of the study drug or procedure and the event is unlikely to be explained by the subject’s medical condition, other therapies or accident.  
The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequen ce from administration of 
the study drug or procedure and at least one of the following instances of clinical evidence:  
• Follows a known or suspected response pattern to the study drug or 
proc
edure. 
• Is confirmed by improvement upon stopping the study drug o r 
proc
edure or decreasing the dose (dechallenge).  
• Reappears upon repeated exposure (rechallenge) if medically appr
opriate. 
There is a reasonable possibility that the study drug or procedure caused 
the ev
ent—i.e., there is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship. In such 
case, the AE is considered an adverse reaction  (AR). A suspected  AR has 
a lesser degree of certainty about causality than an AR.  
Not Related 
to Study Drug or Procedure Event can be readily explained by other factors such as the subject’s 
underlying medical conditions, concomitant therapy, or accident; or there is no temporal relationship between study drug or procedure and the event.  
A reasonable possibility or clinical evidence that the study drug or 
procedure caused the event is lacking.  
 
6.12.1.3  Immediately Reportable Experiences  
The following events may occur during participation in this clinical study and must be 
reported immediately:  
• Death or other serious AE ( SAE )  
• Pregnan cy  of a subject or subject’s partner 
• 3-fold or greater elevation above the upper limit of normal (ULN) of alanine 
ami
notransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) accompanied by an 
elevation of serum total bilirubin greater than two times the ULN  
• Liver enzyme (AST, ALT) value greater than or equal to 5 times the ULN  
The
 events listed above must be reported within 24 hours of first knowledge of the event by 
stu
dy personnel to the appropriate Jazz Pharmaceuticals contact or designee. For immediately  
reportable experiences, the appropriate form (e.g., SAE Report Form, Pregnancy Form ) 
should be completed as thoroughly as possible and signed by the Investigator or his/her 
designee before transmittal to Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Drug Safety and Pharmacovigila nce.

or SAEs, it is important that the Inves tigator provide his/her assessment of causality to 
study drug or procedure at the time of the initial report. If the Investigator’s assessment of 
causality subsequently changes, then a follow-up SAE form must be subm itted with a revised 
causality assessment . 
Jazz Pharmaceuticals Drug Safety is required to expedite to global regulatory authorities 
report
s of Serious Adverse Events, including Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse 
Reactions (SUSARs), as per the US FDA Cod e of Federal Regulations, European 
Commission Clinical Trials Dir ective (2001/20/EC), and other country-specific regulations.   
For the purposes of global expedited adverse event reporting for this clinical trial, the refer
ence safety document for the determination of expectedness is the Investigator’s 
Brochure  for Xyrem (sodium oxybate) oral solution for Pediatric Narcolepsy. 
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
An SAE is an AE that fulfills the following criteria, as per Title 21 CFR 312.32 and ICH E2A.II.B. SAEs must be reported to Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee using the SAE Form. The following are defined as SAEs and must be reported within 24 hours of being notified of the event: 
• Is fatal (results in death)  
• Is
 life-threatening (Note: the term “life -th reatening” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does n ot refer to an event that 
could hypothetically have caused death had it been more severe)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of e xisting hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is
 a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is
 medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above 
•
 Suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product [for EU sites 
only;

Hospitalization is NOT considered an SAE if: 
• It is planned prior to subject entering study 
• It
 is for social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the 
sub
ject’s  general condition 
• It is elective in nature and not related to worsening of an underlying condition 
• The

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 65 of 158 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based on appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above in the definition of an SAE. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, the development of drug dependency or drug abuse, and the occurrence of suicidal ideation. 
PREGNANCY  
If a subject [or male subject’s partner] becomes pregnant any time after the first dose of study drug until 30 days after the last dose of study dr ug, the Pregnancy Form should be used to 
report the pregnancy to Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee. Subject pregnancies must be followed until termination of pregnancy or for a minimum of 6 months following the birth of the child. If the pregnancy resul ts in a child birth, the infant must be followed for a minimum 
of 6 months. The Infant Follow-Up Form should be used to report information regarding the status of the infant. 
6.12.1.4  Adverse Event Recording and Reporting 
Each individual AE is to be listed as a separate entry on the AE CRF. The I nvestigator will 
provide information about dates of onset and resolution, seriousness, severity, frequency, action(s) taken, outcome, and relationship to study medication.  
Documentation of immediately reportable events will follow procedures described in 
Secti
on 6.12.1.3, Immediately Reportable Experiences . 
T
he Investigator must report to Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee all A Es that occur 
during the study after the informed consent has been signed and assent has been given until the final study visit or early termination, regardless  of their relationship to study drug. 
If an Investigator becomes aware of an SAE within 30 days after the last dose of study 
me
dication, the event must be documented and reported as described in Section 6.12.1.3. 
6.12.1.5  Follow -up of Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events  assessed as not related to study drug or procedure, including clinically 
significant laboratory tests, ECGs, or physical examination findings, must be followed until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained, or the final study visit occurs, whichever comes first. A Es and SAEs assessed as related to study drug or 
procedure will be followed for as long as necessary to adequately evaluate the subject’s safety, or until the event stabilizes, or the subject is lost to follow up. If resolved, a resolution date should be provided, and for SAEs, a follow- up SAE form must be submitted indicating 
the resolution date. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow-up includes any supplemental investigations indicated to elucidate the n ature and/or causality of the AE. This 
may include additional clinical laboratory testing or investigations, examinations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals as is practical.

Subjects will be asked to refrain from taking the prohibited medications  specified in 
Section  5.7 from the time of Screening until completion o f the  study. If discontinuation of 
CNS depressants or any medication poses a safety risk to the subject, the subject should not 
be enrolled in  the study. 
All concomitant medications taken during the study will be recorded on the Concomitant Medi
cations CRF  with indication, total daily dose, and dates of drug administration. 
6.14 Removal of Subjects from the Study or Study Drug  
All subjects are free to withdraw from participation in this study at any time, for any reason, and without prejudice. The Investigator must withdraw any subject from the study if the subject or subject’s parent (s)/guardian(s) requests to stop participating in the study.   
The Investigator, Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee may remove a subject from the study 
at an
y time and for any reason.  
If any of the criteria below are met during the study, study drug administration must be stoppe
d and the subject discontinued from the study. 
• Suicide risk reported or assessed by C- SSRS 
•
 Clinically significant depression independent of narcolepsy symp toms  
o
 If the T- s core is ≥ 65 on CDI 2S R[S] , an evaluation of depression by the 
Investigator (if qualified as a mental health professional) or by the Investigator in consultation with a mental health professional must be performed  to exclude clinically significant depression 
• Any PSG parameters  t
 hat indicate , in the judgment of the Investigator, a risk to  the 
subject’s safe continued participation  
• Subject becomes pregnant  
• A
 positive urine drug screen for benzodiazepines or drugs of abuse (if the subject 
ta
kes prescribed amphetamines, a positive result for amphetamines will not exclude 
the subject)  or any suspicion by the investigator of abuse or diversion of study drug 
• A positive alcohol test 
• 3-
fold or greater elevation above the upper limit of normal (ULN) of alanine 
ami
notransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) accompanied by an

•Subject reaches his/her 18th birthday. Subjects who terminate from Part 2 of the study
because they have reached 18  years of age will be considered to have completed the
study.
All subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study shou ld
 have all early termination 
assessments performed (see S ection 6.14.1, Handling of Early Terminations). 
The
 specific reason for the discontinuation should be carefully documented on the 
termina
tion CRF. If assent or informed consent is withdrawn, the specific r eason for 
withdrawing the assent or informed consent should be stated. 
Adverse events resulting in termination will be followed to the satisfactory resolution and 
determ
ination of outcome as ascertained by the Investigator (and/or Jazz Pharmaceuticals or 
its designee). The data will be recorded on the appropriate CRF.  
6.14.1  Handling of Early Terminations  
If a
 subject terminates early from the study, either at his or her request or the subject ’s 
paren
t(s) or guardian(s), or at the Investigator’s discretion, the Investigator will record the 
reason(s) for early termination on the relevant CRF page and notify the Sponsor immediately. The specific reason for the withdrawal should be carefully documented on the CRF. For instance, rather than stating “withdrew informed consent,” the specific reason for withdrawing the informed consent should be stated. All subjects who terminate early from 
Part 1  should undergo all early termination  assessments  in Section 7.4.3. All s ubjects who 
ter
minate early from Part 2 should undergo all study termination assessments in 
Section  7.5.5. Subjects who terminate from Part 2 of the study because they have reached 
18 yea
rs of age will be considered to have completed the study. 
It is vital to obtain follow -up data  on any subject who terminated because of an AE, 
abnormal laboratory test, or ECG finding.  In any case, every effort must be made to undertake safety follow-up procedures. 
6.15 Sponsor’s Termination of Study 
Jazz Pharmaceuticals reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for any reason.  
Such a termination must be implemented by the Investigator, if instructed to do so by Jazz 
Pharmaceuticals in a time frame that is compatible with the subject’s well-being. 
In the situation of a serious issue/event causing study termination, the sudden stop of 
medica
tion may be warranted. In the event the study is terminated for an administrative 
reason, Jazz Pharmaceuticals will provide a reasonable period  to allow subjects  either to be 
discontinued safely, or to obtain replacement medication. “A reasonabl e period” is defined as 
no less than 2 weeks from the time of site notification of impending termination.

The primary efficacy endpoint (change in weekly number of cataplexy attacks) measure, the 
Cataplexy Frequency Diary , is similar  to the measure used in a prior study to establish 
efficacy in adults . Cataplexy frequency data will be collected daily in a cataplexy frequency 
diary. Both the Cataplexy Frequency Diary and the ESS  (CHAD)  have been  evaluated for 
their face and co ntent validity in children with narcolepsy ( Mapi Study JZ13770A) . The 
CGI
c has been used extensively in clinical trials .  
The PK parameters selected to characterize the PK profile of sodium oxybate are the standa
rdized parameters used to characterize the PK profiles of all drugs. The blood 
collections for sodium oxybate concentrations will occur at specified time points up to 8 hours after the first Xyrem dose.  
The parameters selected to assess the safety of the study drug are appropriate since they are 
routine
ly used to assess the safety profile of drugs in clinical studies and pertinent to known 
risks of Xyrem . The C -SSRS, CDI 2:SR[S], and MASC-10 have been validated for use in the 
pediatric population.

Titration is required for subjects who are re-enrolling after completing Part 1 of the study and 
have been off Xyrem for ≥1 month. For subjects who have been off Xyrem for less than 1 month, titration may also be required per the Investigator’s judgment. S ubjects will be 
titrated to Xyrem as described in Section  3.1.2. The Part 2 Titration may last up to 10 weeks. 
Onc 
e it is determined that the subje ct has achieved clinical benefit in cataplexy and EDS 
while maintaining tolerability, the subject may remain on that stable dose through the remainder of the titration period. However, Xyrem dose adjustment due to tolerability and efficacy is permitted per  the Investigator’s judgment.

9 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
9.1 General Considerations 
The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Xyrem in the treatment of cataplexy in narcolepsy in pediatric subjects. Secondary objective s are to 
evaluate the efficacy of Xyrem in the treatment of EDS in pediatric subjects with narcolepsy with cataplexy, to characterize the PK of Xyrem given as two doses to children and adolescents (ages 7 -17 years) with narcolepsy with cataplexy, and to evaluate the safety of 
titrating Xyrem in children and adolescents to an effective and tolerable dose.  
Non-categorical efficacy parameters will be analyzed by non -pa
 rametric analysis of 
covariance ( ANCOVA). Ordinal categorical parameters, including CGIc and PGIc, will be 
analyzed using Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel ( CMH ) tests for row mean score difference. PK 
parameters will be assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) models using natural log -
transformed data. S afety data will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  When data are 
reported by age group, either ages 7 -11 years or ages 12- 17 years , subjects will be 
summarized by age at Visit 2 (start of the Stable -Dose Period) for subjects on Xyrem at study 
entry and at Visit 1.1 (start of the Titration Period) for Xyrem-naïve subjects.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 94 of 158 9.2 Determination of Sample Size 
The study will enroll pediatric subjects who are diagnosed with narcolepsy with cataplexy 
and who are between 7 and 16 years of age, inclusive, to ensure subjects are <18 years of age at the end of Part 1 of the study . At least 100 subjects will be enrolled in the study to assess 
the safety of Xyrem in this pediatric population.   
Prior to Amendment 4, a sample size of 70 subjects was planned to enter the randomized-
wit
hdrawal  (Double- Blind Treatment)  period. This sample size was estimated based on 
repeated resampling of the data with replacement ( bootstrapping) from previous narcolepsy 
trials in adults (GHB -2 and OMC- SXB -15). The analysis showed that a sample of 35 
subjects on Xyrem (sodium oxybate) treatment had at least 40% difference from endpoint to baseline in the mean weekly number of cataplexy attacks, as a percentage of endpoint, over 95% of the time. The present study (13-005) differs from S tudies GHB -2 and OMC- SXB -15 
in that pediatric  subject s will be enrolled instead of adults, the study design is randomized-
withdrawal versus a standard randomized treatment study, and the length of the randomized period is 2 weeks for 13-005 versus 4 weeks for GHB -2 and 8 weeks for OMC- SXB -15. 
Discounting for these factors, a sample of 35 subjects in each arm was expected to have at least 80% power to detect a difference between the two treatment groups of 40% in the percentage change in the mean weekly number of cataplexy attacks during the 2 -week 
Double- Blind Treatment Period  of the study as compared with the mean weekly number of 
cataplexy attacks during the last 2 weeks of the immediately preceding stable-dose period, using a two-sided alpha of 0.05.  
Every effort will be made to enroll approximately 30 subjects on Xyrem at study entry of the 
anti
cipated 100 subjects enrolled. O ther subjects enrolled will be Xyrem naïve at study entry.  
A subset of the subjects who are taking Xyrem at a stable dose for th eir  narcolepsy symptoms 
will participate in the PK evaluation . Up to 18 subjects in each of the two age groups (7 -11 
year olds and 12-17 year olds)  will be enrolled to ensure a minimum of 12 completers in each 
age group. If the variability of PK data in children and adolescents is comparable to that of adults, a sample size of 12 completers in each age group is expected to provide adequate precision to characterize the PK of sodium oxybate in each age group. However, when sufficient data are obtained to characterize the PK profile with adequate precision during the study, as determined by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), or when enrollment of 100 subjects in the study has been reached, enrollment for the PK evaluation will stop and available data will be used for analysis.  
9.3 Analysis Populations  
The Safety Population will consist of all subjects who are dispensed study drug. This population will be used for tables and listings of safety data. This population will also be used to summarize efficacy  data as appropriate.  The Safety Population will be additionally 
categorized by period and by whether the subject took study drug during the different study periods.

Nigh t 1 when subjects receive one half of their usual stable dose. This population will be 
used for listings and descriptive statistics of the half -dose PK data.  
The PK Full-Dose Population will consist of all subjects who have any PK data for PK  
Nigh
t 2 when subjects receive their usual stable  dose. This population will be used for 
listings and descriptive statistics of the full- dose PK data.  
The PK Completer Population will consist of all subjects who have PK data for both PK 
night
s. This population will be used for evaluating within subject dose proportionality.   
The Efficacy Population will consist of all subjects who are randomized to Xyrem or Xyrem plac
ebo and who complete at least 5 days of dosing in the Double- Blind Treatment Pe riod. 
This population will be used as the main analysis population for tables of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints.  
The Randomized Population will consist of all subjects who are randomized to Xyrem or Xyr
em placebo for the Double- Blind  Treatmen t Period of the study. This population will be 
used to summarize exposure to double-blind treatment. This population may also be used for summaries of safety data specific to the Double- Blind  Treatment Period.  This population 
may also be used for an additional analysis of the primary and/or secondary efficacy endpoints. 
The Continued Access Population will consist of all subjects who took study drug in Part 2.  
This
 population will be used for tables and listings of Part 2 data.  
9.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized for the safety population, the 
PK half -dose population, the PK completer population, the randomized population, the 
efficacy population, and the continued access population. The s ummaries of data will include 
numbers and percentages for categorical variables and mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables. Tables for the randomized population and the efficacy population will be by randomized treatment group (Xyrem or Xyrem placebo) and overall. The randomized population tables will include a comparison of the treatment groups, with categorical variables analyzed using a chi-square test and continuous variables analyzed using a one- way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with treatment as the only 
factor.  
9.5 Handling of Dropouts and Missing Data 
The following methods will be used to handle missing efficacy data and data from subjects who discontinue early in the Double-Blind Treatment Period. The weekly  number of 
cataplexy attacks will be computed as the average from days with non -missing data, 
multiplied by 7. School attendance will be calculated as the number of missed days, multiplied by 100, divided by the actual number of school days (not including holidays) up to the point of Part 1 early termination or Double-Blind Treatment Period completion. T he last 
post Stable- Dose Period assessment of all other measures will be used as the end of the 
Double- Blind Treatment Period assessment .

1 Statistical Analysis  
To
 address Primary Objective 1 and Secondary Objective 1:  
A tiered approach was planned to control the Type 1 family-wise error rate at the 0.05 sign
ifican ce level with all tests being two -sided for testing of the primary and secondary 
efficacy endpoints. 
Due to the positive primary efficacy results from the pre- speci fied interim analyses 
(described in Section 9.8), the DSMB recommended to stop the Double- Blind Randomized-
Withdrawal Period.  Tiered testing on secondary endpoints, as defined below, will be 
conducted with a significance level of 0.05, with all tests being two-sided. 
Tier 1: Primary endpoint 
1. Change in weekly number of cataplexy attacks from the last 2 weeks of the Sta ble-
Dose  Period to the 2 weeks of the Double- Blind  Treatment Period. 
The primary endpoint demonstrated efficacy at the interim analysis with a significance level 
<0.005.  T es
ting will continue with Tier 2 .  
Tier 2: Key s econda ry endpoint #2 
2. CGIc for catap lexy severity  from the end of the Stable -Dose  Period to the end of the 
Double- Blind  Treatment Period  
The testing of this endpoint will be conducted at the 0.05 significance level. If Xyrem is sign
ificantly better than placebo at this level, Tier 3 tests will be conducted.  
Tier 3: Key s econda ry endpoint #3

of Double-Blind Treatmen t Period  
The testing of this endpoint will be conducted at the 0.05 significance level. If Xyrem is 
sign
ificantly better than placebo at this level, Tier 4 tests will be conducted.  
Tier 4: Other secondary endpoints #4 
4. CGIc for narcolepsy overall from th e e nd of the Stable- Dose Period to the end of the 
Double- Blind Treatment Period  
The testing of this endpoint will be conducted at the 0.05 significance level. If Xyrem is sign
ificantly better than placebo at this level, Tier 5 tests will be conducted.  
Tier 5: Other secondary endpoint #5 
5. C
hange in QoL (SF-10) from the end of the Stable -Dose  P eriod to the end of the 
Double- Blind  Treatment Period  
The testing of this endpoint will be conducted at the 0.05 significance level.  
Exploratory efficacy endpoints will be tested without multiplicity adjustments. For these param
eters, nominal p-value will be reported.  
Non-categorical efficacy parameters will be analyzed by non -pa rametric analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA). Ordinal categor ical parameters, including CGIc and PGIc, will be 
analyzed using Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel (CMH) tests for row mean score difference.  
Efficacy data in the open -labe l phase will be summarized by visit.  
9.7 Statistical Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Variables 
To addr ess Secondary Objective 2:  Concentration data for sodium oxybate will be 
summarized by sampling time point and by PK parameter using descriptive statistics for each age group and overall. Dose proportionality will be assessed from the ratio of AUC and C
max 
values. The ratios and their 90% confidence intervals will be presented. If warranted, regression models will be used to explore the relationship between plasma concentration and dose on a mg/kg basis. 
9.8 Interim Analysis  
A preplanned interim analysis was conducted  after 35 subjects completed or discontinued 
early from the Double- Blind  Treatment Period . The interim analysis was  performed by a 
statistician not directly involved with the design and analysis of the study. The data were reviewed by a DSMB that recommended  stopping placebo treatment in  the Double -Blind 
Randomized-Withdrawal Period and continue the study as an open- label safety study  because 
of positive efficacy results . 
Considerations for stopping the study early included the following as in
 itially planned. Given 
now the placebo treatment is stopped after the interim analysis review by DSMB, the DSMB will continue to review safety and PK data as outlined below.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 98 of 158 For stopping the study early because of treatment success , so that fewer subjects will be 
exposed to placebo: The O'Brien- Fleming approach will be used with the primary effic acy 
endpoint. This endpoint will be tested at a significance level of 0.005 at the interim analysis. 
If statistical significance is shown, the DSMB may recommend stoppi ng the study 
considering the overall study objectives and subject’s safety. If the study is not stopped, to maintain an overall alpha of 0.05, the final analysis will be conducted at a significance level of 0.048, based on one prior look at the data. 
For s topping the study early because of treatment failure:  In
  the interim analysis, if the 
null hypothesis for the primary efficacy endpoint is not rejected at the 0.005 significance 
level, then a futility analysis will be conducted. The conditional power approach will be used. Assuming the trend in the data observed up to the interim analysis will continue for the data collected between the interim analysis and the final analysis, the conditional power of rejecting the null hypothesis at the final analysis will be calculated. If the conditional power is less than 15%, it will be concluded that the study is unlikely to demonstrate efficacy and the DSMB may recommend stopping the study considering the overall study objectives and subject’s safety. T he study may be  discontinued early due to futility. 
For stopping the study early because of safety reasons:  Saf
 ety data, including the 
incidence of adverse events, will be reviewed by the DSMB at regular intervals. Any serious adverse events or deaths will be given detai led attention. Taking all data reviewed into 
account, the DSMB will determine if the risk to subjects warrants study discontinuation.   
An ongoing analysis of the PK data will also be conducted to determine if a sufficient 
number
 of samples have been colle cted to adequately characterize the PK of Xyrem in 
children and adolescents.  
9.9 Safety Analysis  
Safety will be assessed at time points specified in the schedules of events, as well as throughout the study. Safety assessments will include the following:  
• Adverse event (AE) monitoring

Declaration of Helsinki - Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human 
Subjects,” Fortaleza, Brazil  2013).  
11.5 Subject Information Assent and Consent 
All subjects will provide assent and their parent(s) or guardian (s) will give written informed 
consent in accordance with local IRB/IEC requirements before the performance of any study related procedures.  
Each subject ’s char
 t will have the assent of the subject documented (written or verbal) and 
the ICF signed by the parent or guardian for study  participation , and for PK evaluation if 
applicable,  attached to it. When  the study treatment is completed and the CRF has been 
monitored, the ICF will be kept in the inve stigator’s central study file. Regulatory authorities 
may check the existence of the signed ICF in this central study folder if not having done so during the performance of the study. 
11.6 Subject Confidentiality  
All reports and communications relating to the subjects in the study will identify each subject 
only by his/her initials and by the subject’s study number or as required by regional or 
national regulations. These documents will be treated with strict adherence to professional standards of confidentiality and will be filed at the study site under adequate security and restricted access.  
Portions of the subject’s medical records pertinent to the study will be reviewed by Jazz 
Phar
maceuticals personnel or its designee and possibly by governmental agency personnel to 
ensure adequate source documentation, accuracy, and completeness of the CRFs. The IRB has the authority to review subject records. 
11.7 Protocol Adherence – Amendments 
The protocol must be read thoroughly and the instructions must be followed exactly. 
Any changes in the protocol wi ll req uire a formal amendment. Such amendments will be 
agreed upon and approved in writing by the I nvestigator and the Jazz Pharmaceuticals 
designees. The IRB/IEC will be notified of all amendments to the protocol. Amendments to 
the protocol will not be implemented until written IRB/IEC approval has been received.  
If a coun try or region specific amendment is required based on local regulation, the 
ame
ndment will be submitted to the IRB(s) and competent  authority of that country or region 
only. 
11.8 Required Documents 
The Investigator must provide Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its desig nee with the applicable 
regulatory documents before the enrollment of any subject (copies should be kept by the 
Investigator in the Investigator’s regulatory document binder).

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 104 of 158 11.9 Study Monitoring 
Throughout the course of the study, the study monitor will make frequent contacts with the 
Investigator. This will include tele phone calls and onsite visits. During the onsite visits, the 
CRFs will be reviewed for completeness and adherence to the protocol. As part of the data audit, source documents will be made ava ilable for review by the site. The study monitor will 
also perform drug accountability checks and may periodically request review of the Investigator study file to assure completeness of documen tation in all respects of clinical 
study conduct.  
Upon completion of the study, the study monitor will arrange for a final review of the study 
fil
es after which the files should be secured fo r the appropriate time period. The Investigator 
or appointed del egate will receive the study monitor during these onsite visits and will 
cooperate in providing the documents for inspection and respond to inquiries. In addition, the Investigator will permit inspection of the study files by authorized representatives of the 
regulatory agencies.   
11.10  Protocol Deviations  
All major protocol deviations must be reported to the IRB in an expedited fashion. It is the responsibility of the principal investigator to ensure proper reporting to the IRB. All p rotocol 
deviations (major an d minor) must be reported to Jazz Pharmaceuticals or designee.  
11.11  Retention of Data 
The investigator/institution should maintain the trial documents as specified in Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Trial (ICH E6 Good Clinical Practice) and as required by the 
applicable regulatory requirement(s). The investigator/institution should take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents.  
Essential documents should be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a 
mar
keting application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated 
marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with Jazz Pharmaceuticals. It is the responsibility of Jazz Pharmaceuticals to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
11.12  Publication and Disclosure Policy

additional clinic visit. See Appendix 3 .  
An arrow (               )   indicates that the assessment is continuous.  
Note: A Xyrem naïve subject is defined as a subject who has never been treated with Xyrem or who was previously treated with Xyrem and discontinued Xyrem 
for
 at least one month prior to the Screening visit for reasons other than lack of efficacy and/or tolerability issues (e.g., lost insurance coverage, could not afford 
Xyrem, changed prescribers). 
* Subject s who  enter the Double -Blind Period after Amendment 4 becoming effective will receive open -label Xyrem  during the Double -Blind Period.  
 
a)  All subjects will provide their written informed consent prior to the performance of any study -related procedures. The Screening Visit (Visit 1) 
starts when a subject is assigned a subject number via IVRS/IWRS . If needed, additional screening time may be granted with permission of the 
Medical Monitor.  
b)  Obtain vital signs after  subject has been resting for ≥ 5 min.  
c)  HLA DQB1:0602: Collect blood sample unless previous result available.  
d)  See Table 2. 
e)  Urine drug screen and alcohol test: only for subjects continuing into the Open -Label Safety Period.  
f)  Recorded daily in electronic diary.  
g)  Impression of severity prior to any narcolepsy treatment.

PK evaluation  When the subject is on a stable dose of Xyrem, PK Nights 1 and 2 can be scheduled for a protocol -specified clinic visit or for an additional clinic visit. See  
Appendix 3 . 
An arrow (               )   indicates that the assessment is continuous.  
Note: A Xyrem naïve subject is  def ined as a subject who has never been treated with Xyrem or who was previously treated with Xyrem and discontinued Xyrem 
for at least one month prior to the Screening visit for reasons other than lack of efficacy and/or tolerability issues (e.g.,  lost insurance coverage, could not afford 
Xyrem, changed prescribers).  
a)  Visit 5 will be conducted 4 weeks after the end of the Double -Blind Treatment Period unless Visit 5 is within 2 weeks of the Week 18 visit. Visits 6 -16 
will be conducted at Weeks 16, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 39, 43, 48, 52, and 54 after Day 1.  
b)  If the subject is continuing  directly  into Part 2 , see Appendix 22.  
c)  Do not complete the Safety Follow -up visit for subjects who continue  directly into Part 2  (see Appendix 22 ). 
d)  Recorded daily in electronic diary.  
e)  Obtain vital signs  after the subject has been resting for ≥5 minutes.  
f)  C-SSRS: Use Since Last Visit version for subjects ≥12 years of age and use Children’s versions for children <12 years of age . 
g)  Part 1 Early termination PSG does not apply for subjects who discontinue before entering the Open -Label Safety Period.  
h)  Study drug dispensed at study visits in accordance with protocol and as required by State or local regulation.

 SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these ar e separate events; must ask about all types)  
Lifetime  
Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent 
does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated w ith the act, then it can be consid ered an actual suicide attempt. There does not 
have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigge r while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, 
this is considered an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual deni es intent/wish to die, it may be inferred c linically from the behavior or circumsta nces. For example, a highly lethal 
act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but su icide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if 
someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Did you ever do anything  to try to kill yourself or make yourself not alive anymore? What did you do? 
Did you ever hurt yourself on purpose? Why did you do that? 
Did you______ as a way to end your life?  
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to make yourself not alive anymore when you _____? 
Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____? 
Or did you do it purely for other reasons, not at all  to end your life or kill yourself (like to make yourself feel better, or get 
something else to happen)?  (Self-Injurious Behavior w ithout suicidal intent)  
If yes, describe: 
 
Has subject engaged in Non-Suicidal Self-Injurious Behavior?

Interrupted Attempt:    
When the person is interrupted (by an outside circum stance) from starting the potentially self-injurious act  (if not for that, actual attempt would have 
occurred).

Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by  someone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, 
even if the gun fails to fire, it is an at tempt. Jumping: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hangi ng: Person has noose around 
neck but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so. 
Has there been a time when you started to do something to make yourself not alive anymore (end your life or kill yourself) but

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these ar e separate events; must ask about all types)  Lifetime Past __ 
Years 
Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill 
oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is  any intent/desire to die associated  with the act, then it can be  considered an actual suicide 
attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in 
mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual deni es intent/wish to die, it may be inferred c linically from the behavior or circumsta nces. For example, a 
highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be infe rred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumpin g from window of a 
high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but th ey thought that what they did c ould be lethal, intent may be in ferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt? 
Have you done anything to harm yourself? 
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died? 
What did you do? 
Did you______ as a way to end your life?  
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____? 
Or Did you think it was possible you could have died from_____? 
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better,  
get sympathy, or get something else to happen )?  (Self-Injurious Behavior w ithout suicidal intent)

Interrupted Attempt:    
When the person is interrupted (by an outside circum stance) from starting the potentially self-injurious act  (if not for that, actual attempt would 
have occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pills in hand but is stopped from ingesting.  Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an attempt rather t han an interrupted 
attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is take n away by someone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once 
they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumping:  Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken  down from ledge. 
Hanging: Person has noose around neck but has not ye t started to hang - is stopped from doing so.

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must  ask about all types ) Since Last 
Visit  
Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent 
does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire t o die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not 
have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results , 
this is considered an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circums tances. For example, a highly 
lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but sui cide can be inferred (e.g. , gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). 
Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt?  
Have you done any thing to harm yourself?   
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  
What did you do?  
Did you______ as a way to end your life?  
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____?  
Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____?  
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, g et 
sympathy, or get something else to happen)?  (Self-Injurious Behavior witho ut suicidal intent)

Interrupted Attempt:    
When the person is interrupted (by an outside circums tance) from starting the potentially self -injurious act  (if not for that, actual attempt would have 
occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pills in hand but is stopped from ingesting.  Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an attempt rather  than an interrupted  attempt. 
Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by someone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger . Once they pull the trigger, 
even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumping: Person is poised to jump, is grab bed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around 
neck but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.

less than 20% of body; extensive blood loss but can recover; major fractures).  
4.  Severe physical damage; medical  hospitalization with intensive care required (e.g. , comatose without reflexes; third -degree burns over 20% of body; 
extensive b lood loss with unstable vital signs; major damage to a vital area).

Potential Lethality: Only Answer if Actual Lethality=0  
Likely lethality of actual attempt if no medical damage (the following examples, while having no act ual medical damage, had potential for very serious 
lethality: put gun in mouth and pulled the trigger but gun fails to fire so no medical damage; laying on train tracks with on coming train but pulled away 
before run over).  
 
0 = Behavior not likely to resul t in injury  
1 = Behavior likely to result in injury but not likely to cause death

 STUDY OVERVIEW  
• Eligible patients with 1 -3 painful osseous metastases will receive a consultation 
and subsequently undergo CT simulation, radiation treatment planning, and their 
first radiation treatment on day  1. 
• Patients will receive a total of 2- 5 fractions of high dose palliative radiation 
therapy via helical TomoTherapy consisting of 5- 10 Gray (Gy) per fraction with a 
minimum biologic effective dose (BED) of 25 Gy.  
• Standard patient -specific treatment planning quality assurance will be performed 
on a cylindrical phantom with ion chamber and film measurement.   
• Software provided by TomoTherapy Inc.® will be used to measure the radiation 
exiting the patient and recalculate the dose the patient received.  This calculated 
dose will then be compared to phantom measurements and treatment planning 
calculations to validate the ability of this novel radiation dose verification 
software to verify the accurate delivery of radiation.  This will not replace 
standard qualit y assurance measurements.  
• At the Emily Couric Cancer Center, an in -house developed infrared motion 
tracking system will monitor patients’ positions for any deviation from the 
treatment position.  This is not standard of care but may augment standard safety  
measures with full implementation in the future and does not subject the patient to 
any risks or discomfort. Infrared motion tracking is will be optional and not 
required for patients treated at CRH.  
 
• Contouring (the demarcation of the tumor and critical  structures) will be 
performed in the standard manner for treatment planning.  
• Contouring will also be performed in an expedited, experimental  manner on 
diagnostic image sets which will then be compared to the standard contours.  
Experimental  contouring wil l not replace standard contouring, nor affect 
treatment planning.  
• Patients will complete questionnaires to capture pain scores of the treated 
lesion(s), analgesic use, patient functional status, patient quality of life, and 
patient satisfaction at 1 week, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 
months following treatment.  These scores will be compared to questionnaires 
completed pretreatment.  
• Radiation -induced toxicities will be captured during treatment physical 
examinations and at follow -up physical  examinations at 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 
months, and 12 months . 
 
ELIGIBILITY (see section 3.0)  
• Patient has a biopsy proven diagnosis of cancer.  The osseous metastatic lesions 
do not need to be biopsied. 
• Patients with multiple myeloma are eligible for the stu dy.  
• Patient has 1 -3 major painful osseous metastases (target lesions) from any 
primary cancer or unknown primary cancer.  
• Long bone target lesions must have a Mirels fracture score of ≤ 7 ( See Appendix 
G).

Version/Date: 1.6 / 03.25.2013    
 
vi 
 • Patients with spinal cord compression from verteb ral body metastases are not 
eligible.  
• Target lesions have not previously been treated with external beam  radiation.  
• Radiation oncologist determines that the patient is medically able to undergo 
palliative radiation therapy.  
• Patient has target lesions that are radiographically consistent with metastatic 
disease on CT, MR, or PET CT obtained within 8 weeks of treatment.  
• Persistent distinguishable pain associated with target sites to be treated.  
• Patient average bone pain index ( BPI) pain score for last 72 hours at specified 
location is >  3 (0-10 scale)  
• Patients may have additional non- painful or minimally painful osseous metastases 
(if patient has pain from additional sites, the pain from the additional sites must be 
evaluated as being less intense by at least 2 points on the BPI compared to the 
site(s) treated)  
• The patient may have previously been treated with external beam  radiation 
therapy to other body sites, but not to the target lesions. 
• The patient may have previously or currently be undergoing chemot herapy or 
bisphosphonate therapy. 
• The patient will be able understand English (or a medical interpreter for their 
native language must be available for all study visits).  
• 18 years of age or older.  
• Life expectancy > 12 weeks.  
• Able and willing to answer simple survey questionnaires.  
• Able and willing to keep a logbook of analgesic use (with or without assistance) .  
• Willing to return to clinic for follow -up visit s after treatment . 
• Signed study -specific informed consent form  
 
 
 
TREATMENT (see section 4.0):  
• Patients will receive 2 to 5 palliative radiation treatments prescribed to 5 -10 Gy 
per treatment with a minimum biologic effective dose ( BED ) of 25 Gy.  Radiation 
dose will be determined and prescribed by the treating radiation oncologist based 
on tumor volume, proximity and dose to adjacent critical structure limitations, 
tumor radiosensitivity, whether the patient is receiving systemic chemotherapy, 
and the overall performance status of the patient.

 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Study Synopsis  
   Background:  Osseous metastatic disease causes significant pain, decreased 
functioning, and decreased quality of life. Progressive bone destruction can lead 
to pathologic fractures or spinal cord compression leading to orthopedic surgery, 
paralysis, and/or patients becoming bedridden. Opioids can alleviate pain but have 
neurologic and gastrointestinal side effects that further decrease quality o f life. 
Radiation therapy can effectively reduce pain and opioid use and prevent further 
bone destruction, however, its use is limited because the current workflow 
frequently requires one week for planning and two weeks for delivery. 
Additionally, typical palliative radiation plans for osseous metastases lack 
conformality of dose to the tumor volume, and therefore, result in radiation-
induced toxicity to large volumes of adjacent normal tissue.  Recent software and 
hardware advancements provide the opportunity to revolutionize the palliative 
treatment of osseous metastases. We propose to investigate a novel 
TomoTherapy -based workflow, called STAT RT, which includes same day CT 
simulation, treatment planning, and quality assurance measurements coupled with 
highly conformal treatment delivery for pa tients with osseous metastases in a pilot 
clinical trial.  
   Objective:  The overall goal of this STAT RT proposal is to develop a more 
rapid, convenient, and effective palliative radiation approach for patients with 
osseous metastases that is less toxic and  less expensive than current treatment 
regimens. We have already optimized the conformality of TomoTherapy -based 
radiation doses for osseous metastases, and we have developed a STAT RT 
workflow that condenses standard of care simulation, planning, quality assurance, 
and treatment delivery into 5- 6 hours.  Additional  optimization and integration of 
new radiation therapy computing processes will allow for real time simulation, 
planning, and delivery via a novel Scan -Plan-Treat STAT RT workflow that will 
ultimately require  only  30 minutes.  In this study we will evaluate the 
effectiveness of the current STAT RT workflow , and we will  investigate 
techniques  for further optimization that will be needed to create a 30 minut e Scan -
Plan-Treat STAT RT workflow.  
   Primary Specific Aim/ Hypothesis:    We will quantify the time for pain relief, 
amount of pain relief, opioid use reduction, functional score s, quality of life, and 
satisfaction of patients treated with STAT RT  for os seous metastases.  We 
hypothesize that these patients  will have rapid and significant pain relief, 
improved quality of life, and high patient satisfaction.      
   Secondary Specific Aim/ Hypothesis:   We will optimize the integration o f 
commercially available and in- development software to develop the Scan- Plan-
Treat STAT RT workflow.  Specifically, we will A) optimize rigid and 
deformable co -registration of pre -contoured diagnostic image sets to MVCT 
simulation scans and compare the accuracy to the same pr e-contoured diagnostic 
image sets co -registered to kilovoltage CT (kVCT) simulation images and then

 kVCT simulation to MVCT scan co- registration, B) optimize CT -detector -based 
exit dose measurement algorithms for quality assurance and compare to standard 
of care phantom -based quality assurance, C) explore the options of including an 
in-house real time infrared tracking system for intrafractional patient position 
monitoring to ensure accurate patient treatment.   We hypothesize that these new  
components will provide effective  and efficient methods for  treatment planning, 
quality assurance, and  patient  position monitoring that can be used in a future  30 
minute  Scan -Plan-Treat STAT RT workflow.  
   Study design:  We will recruit 30 cancer patients with 1 -3 painful osseous 
metastatic lesions (target sites) who are candidates for palliative radiation therapy.  
Patients will receive 2- 5 fractions of 5- 10 Gy (minimum BED of 25 Gy) of 
conformal radiation therapy delivered to the target sites via the Helical 
TomoTherapy  system using the STAT RT workflow.  Data will be collected to 
evaluate the effectiveness of our novel image co -registration techniques  and CT-
detector -based exit dose calculations .  These novel  techniques for image co -
registration, radiation dose calculations, and possible patient position monitoring 
will not alter or  replace standard of care techniques. Using validated surveys  we 
will record  patient pain, analgesic use, functi on, quality of life, and patient  
satisfaction prior to treatment and  at 1 week, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 
months, and 12 months after therapy.  Radiation- induced treatment related 
toxicities will be captured during treatment and at the above time points.   
1.2 Disease Background  
1.2.1 Epidemiology of Metastatic Bone Disease  
 The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 1.5 million 
people in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer, and 560,000 will die of 
cancer in 2010 (1). These numbers are projected to increase rapidly in the near 
future due to national demographics with a large number of Americans reaching 
retirement age over the next 15 -20 years, resulting in a doubling of projected new 
cancer di agnoses in 2050 to 3 million (2).  Most cancer deaths involve extensive 
locoregional tumors or metastatic disease to brain, lung, liver, or bone causing 
pain, disability, and decreased quality of life.  As treatments for cancer improve, 
patients are living longer with advanced cancer than ever before, and the 
management of metastatic disease is becoming increasingly more multi-
disciplinary and complex with patients treated simultaneously with systemic 
therapy, surgery and radiation.  
  
 The skeleton is one of the most common sites of metastatic disease and  is 
often the first s ite affected by metastases (3, 4) .  It was estimated that in 2004, 
250,000 cancer patients were afflicted with metastatic bone disease (3).  Bone 
metastases are most common in patients with multiple myeloma, of who m 90% 
develop bone metastases  (5).  Approximately 70% of patients dying of breast and 
prostate cancer have evidence of metastatic bone disease, and bone metastases are 
also common in thyroid, kidney, and lung cancers, occurrin g in 30- 40% of these 
cancers (4).  Metastatic bone disease causes considerable morbidity in patients 
UVA IRB -HSR#:15625

Version/Date: 1.6 / 03.25.2013    
 
3 
 with cancer, resulting in pain, hypercalcemia, pathologic fractures, compression 
of the spinal cord or cauda equina, and spinal instability (4).  
1.2.2 Standard Palliative Radiotherapy Techniques  
 Bone metastases are the most common cause of cancer -related pain (4).  It 
is well documented that cancer -related pain is often inadequately controlled in the 
palliative care setting, and both the pain and opioid medication interfere with 
patient functi on and quality  of life (6 -8).  Radiotherapy is an important tool for 
the alleviation of pain and suffering for cancer patients, and it is used to prevent 
pathologic bone fractures or palli ate tumor -induced obstruction, bleeding, and 
pain that is not well palliated with pharmacologic treatment (9).  Bony metastatic 
lesions in the spine and extra -axial skeleton are often targeted with radiation, 
resulting in prevention of pathologic fractures, reduction in pain, and 
improvement in quality of life  (10-13).  
 
    a) Lack of Dose Conformality  
 For 30- 40 years, standard palliative radiotherapy treatment techniques 
have utilized simple opposed beam arrangements such as treating a patient with 
parallel opposed anterior and posterior beams.  Although simple to plan and 
deliver, such techniques provide poor conformality, and large volumes of organs 
at risk (OARs) may receive the full prescribed dose depending on the level 
treated. See Figure 1.   These OARs may include (skin, lung, esophagus, trachea, 
stomach, small, bowels, rectum, bladder, or genitals) resulti ng in cough, 
dysphagia, odynophagia, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, fatigue, diarrhea, dysuria, 
erythema, and pruritus of the skin and genitals (13, 14) .  Despite being planned 
and delivered on sophisticated systems, these treatments are frequently only 
modestly effective, and cause significant toxicity to an already ill patient 
population wit h a limited life expectancy  (13).  
 
   b) Slow Workflow for Treatmen t Planning and Quality Assurance  
 Conventional simulation and treatment planning is performed over a 
several day process prior to the first delivered treatment.  The patient generally is 
first seen in consultation and scheduled for a CT simulation on a subsequent day.  
During the CT simulation the patient is placed in the position in which they will 
ultimately be treated on a linear accelerator (LINAC) or TomoTherapy unit, and 
immobilization and support devices are fabricated after which they undergo a CT 
scan in the treatment position.  He or she must then wait, sometimes several days, 
for the contouring of the CT simulation images (a process by which the radiation 
oncologist specifies the planning target volume (PTV) of the tumor to be treated 
and the regi onal organs at risk (OARs) or adjacent tissues that may receive 
radiation resulting in toxicity).  Following the contouring of the CT images, 
radiation treatment planning is performed, during which time medical dosimetrists 
and physicians determine the bea m angles and treatment technique to deliver the 
prescribed dose to the PTV while attempting to minimize dose to OARs if 
possible.  Again, for standard osseous metastatic disease palliative techniques 
UVA IRB -HSR#:15625

Version/Date: 1.6 / 03.25.2013    
 
4 
 tend to be fairly simple.  Following treatment planning,  quality assurance 
calculations and/or measurements are performed by medical physicists before 
delivery of the first treatment to ensure accuracy of delivering the planned dose 
and ensure p atient safety.   
  
   c) Inconvenient, Modestly Effective Treatment s 
 Although fractionation schedules in Europe are trending toward 
hypofractionation (fewer treatments) , the most common palliative dose 
fractionation schedules in the USA for osseous metastases vary between 20 and 
30 Gray (Gy) in 5 - 10 fractions delivered over 1 - 2 weeks  (15).  Conventional 
radiotherapy, regardless of fractionation schedule, has been found to be modestly 
effective in palliation of bone metastases, resulting in an improvement in pain in 
only about 60% of patients  (16, 17) .  In a retrospective study of end stage cancer 
patients receiving palliative radiotherapy, Gripp et al found that half of the 
patients received treatment for >60% of their final day s of life  (18).  Thus, these 
often modestly effective treatments subject the patients to repeated visits to the 
treatment center and consume precious time and energy for ill patients and their 
families.  Clearly it is im portant that we design more effective palliative 
treatments that are more efficient to plan and deliver, minimize acute toxicity, and 
require fewer total treatments.   
1.2.3 Costs of Metastatic Bone Disease  
 The treatment of metastatic bone disease is costly.  S chulman and Kohles 
estimated that the mean per patient direct cost for cancer patients after diagnoses 
with metastatic bone disease was $75,329 compared to $31,455 for cancer -
matched controls wit hout metastatic bone disease (3) .  Using this data, the authors 
estimated that the national cost burden for patients with metastatic bone disease 
was $12.6 billion in 2004, which was 17% of the NIH -reported $74 billion dir ect 
medical costs for cancer (3).  These costs will clearly increase with our aging 
population and associate d increase in cancer prevalence (2).  From a societal 
standpoint, looming Medicare financial constraints will likely result in reduced 
reimbursement for palliative services, driving the economic incentive to develop 
the next generation of more clinically efficient palliative radiotherapy workflows.

1.3.1 Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SB RT): A more effective, highly 
conformal hypofractionated palliative radiation technique  
 In the search for more effective and less toxic radiotherapy techniques, 
much attention has been focused on stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).   
SBRT is the use of  hypofractionated, highly conformal, high dose radiation 
delivery that has been modeled after intracranial stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).  
Like SRS, SBRT uses multiple beams that converge on the target volume.  This 
minimizes the volume of tissue receiving high dose to where the beams intersect, 
reducing dose to normal tissue.  This allows for the delivery of ablative doses of 
radiation in a few fractions  with acceptable toxicity  (19, 20) .  SBRT is a proven

 method for treating lung cancer, yielding excellent rates of local control for non -
small- cell lung cancer and resulting in 5 -year survival rates potentially 
comparable to that of surgery  (20, 21) .  In addition, the treatment of liver 
metastases with SBRT has yielded promising results, achieving local control rates 
at 2 years of approximately 70–90% (2 2-24).   
 
 SBRT has also been used in the palliative treatment of bone metastases to 
the spine with remarkable success.  Multiple studies have used SBRT to safely 
deliver high doses of radiation to the spine while significantly limiting dose to the 
spinal  cord and achieving lo cal control rates of > 80% at one year (25 -29).  
Fractionations in these studies have ranged from 1 to 5 fractions delivering 4 - 24 
Gy per individual fraction, with total doses betw een 10 to 30 Gy (25-29).  In the 
largest prospective  study of spine SBRT by Gerszten, 336 cases were treated 
primarily to relieve pain, and they achieved significant pain improvement in 290 
patients (86%).  Nelson, Tsai, Gibbs, and Ryu, have also reported pain reduction 
in greater than 8 0% of patients in th eir studies  (25-30), much improved over the 
60% in c onventional radiotherapy  (16, 17) .  Not only do more people experience 
pain relief, but the pain relief is more durable.  Gagnon demonstrated statistically 
significant improvement in pain scores lasting throughout all 4 years of follow -up 
(31).  Ryu found the median duration of pain relief to be 13.6 months with SBRT 
(30), which is a dramatic improvement compared to the average 3 to 6 months of 
palliation with conventional therapy (13, 32) .  Additionally, spinal SBRT 
treatments have been effective in achieving local control in tumors typically 
resistant to radiotherapy, such as renal cell carcinoma and melanoma, due in part 
to radiation injury to the  tumor vasculature  (25, 28, 30, 31) .   
1.3.2 Adverse Events with SBRT: Minimal Toxicity  
 Though great success is seen in high dose, hypof ractionated therapy, care 
must be taken to avoid incorrectly delivering the high dose radiation to normal 
tissue.  Prevention of damage to normal tissue is ensured through careful patient 
immobilization, co -registration of multiple diagnostic imaging modalities (MRI, 
PET CT, contrast enhanced CT) to the kVCT simulation to accurately define the 
target and OARs, inverse treatment planning with the use of intensity modulated 
radiation therapy (IMRT), patient -specific quality assurance, and CT image 
guidance at  the time of treatment delivery.  Nevertheless, common side effects of 
radiotherapy do occur with SBRT as do other adverse events.  However, the 
advantage of conformal radiation is that it spares radiation dose to normal tissue.  
This has been demonstrated by reports of little to no toxicity in many trials using 
SBRT (25, 31) , and is reinforced by the findings of McIntosh et al, who compared 
conformal helical TomoTherapy with conventional 3D conformal treatment 
techniques on an anthropomorphic phantom and showed that helical 
TomoTherapy significantly improved conformality and reduced dose to r egional 
critical structures (33).

  Most significant adverse event s in spinal SBRT have occurred with 
treatments that used extremely high -doses (>20 Gy) in a single fraction.  Gomez 
et al reported odynophagia and dysphagia in 1 patient who had received 22Gy to 
the esophagus in a single dose, and another patient developed an esophageal ulcer 
and necrosis after receiving 24Gy to hi s esophagus in one fraction (34).  Another 
patient developed bronchial stenosis after receiving 11Gy to a bronchus.  In 
another study with similarly high dos e fractionation schedules, 39% of patients 
treated with 18 to 24 Gy in a single dose developed new or pr ogressive vertebral 
fractures  (35) .  However, their patient selection did not utilize a scoring system to 
identify  patients at high risk for pathologic fracture, such a s the Mirels scoring 
system  (36) .  In contrast, Gagnon et al, using mean doses of 26 Gy in 3 fractions 
in 200 patients, only had 2 patients (1%) develop vertebr al fractures  (31).  Sahg al 
et al reported 5 cases of radiation myelopathy and concluded that for single 
fraction SBRT, up to 10Gy to a maximum point to the thecal sac is safe  (37).  
Dose distributions that cause such severe toxicities described above will not be 
used in this study.  Our study will use doses similar to those used by Gagnon for 
his SBRT studies that reported remarkably low toxicities.  Additionally, to 
minimize the number of patients who develop new or progressive fractures, we 
will use the Mirels scoring system to identify patients at high risk of fracture and 
exclude them from the study  (36).  
1.3.3 Extrapolation of Spinal SBRT -like Dos e Distributions to Non -spine 
Osseous Metastases 
          Given the advances in radiation delivery with SBRT and its success in 
palliation of spine metastases, it is logical to apply these advancements in 
technology to extra -axial bone metastases; however no trials have been published 
to date.  This is due to the fact SBRT is only reimbursed for limited indications 
such as spinal metastases.  It is fair to hypothesize that the extrapolation of SBRT -
like dose distributions to extra -axial bone metastases will  improve pain control 
and that rapid institution of radiation will minimize the time patients are in pain 
and on high dose opioids that place them at risk for iatrogenic medical 
complications.  By applying the concepts of spinal SBRT for palliative treatme nt 
of non- spinal bone metastases, we propose to use highly conformal radiation 
therapy techniques to treat patients that will allow increased dose per fraction and 
fewer total fractions with less toxicity compared to standard non- conformal 
palliative regimens. See Figures 1 -2.

1.3.4 Relative Biologic Effective Dose: a method to compare different dose 
fractionation schedules  
 Based on the linear -quadratic equation, one can calculate the biologic 
effective dose (BED) to compare dose delive ry of different fractionation 
schedules using the equation: BED = nd [1+d/(alpha/beta)], where n = number of 
fractions and d = dose per fraction.  As seen in Table 1 , when compared with 
conventional fractionation schedules for palliative osseous metastases , such as 
30Gy in 10 fractions or 20Gy in 5 fractions, high dose per fraction regimens 
deliver very similar BED to early responding tissues and slightly higher BED to 
late responding tissues.  Our study will deliver a minimum BED of 25 Gy to each 
treatment  target. We anticipate that most patients on this trial will receive 2 -3 
treatments with 8 Gy delivered per treatment, however, the dose per treatment, 
number of treatments, and total dose will depend on patient -specific factors 
including tumor histology, tumor location and proximity to critical OARs, and 
tumor size.  Relative BED provides a method to compare different dose 
fractionation schedules that can be used to correlate the treatment with patient 
outcomes.

 1.3.5 STAT RT: A Rapid Palliat ive Radiotherapy Workflow  
 The University of Virginia Radiation Oncology Department has received 
institutional funding through an institutional   Buchanan Grant  and a CMS 
Innovation Award to fund the technical development of a TomoTherapy -based 
STAT RT pro gram for rapid pain palliation. We have already treated over 30 
patients in the first phase of development of this program with a STAT RT 
workflow that compresses the standard workflow to 6 hours allowing same day 
simulation, treatment planning, and treatment delivery. In the second phase of 
development we will optimize the combination of several recent computing 
advancements to create a Scan -Plan-Treat STAT RT workflow in which CT 
simulation, treatment planning, and treatment delivery with real time quality 
assurance will be performed on a single system in approximately 30 minutes.          
1.3.6 Technologic Rationale For The Choice of The TomoTherapy Platform  
          TomoTherapy delivers highly conformal and homogenous dose 
distributions through modulation of  dose from a bank of 64 binary 6.25 -mm- wide 
collimator leaves capable of pneumatic opening or closing 51 times per revolution 
as the gantry revolves around the patient See Figure 3 .  The system can also treat 
patients with discrete  beam angles ( i.e. the radiation beam not rotating) in a mode 
called TomoDirect.  Due to increased costs for IMRT, this treatment technique is 
not allowable for the treatment of non- spine bone metastases. Although all 
TomoTherapy treatment delivery is technically IMRT, the treatme nt planning can 
be done in either a 3D or IMRT mode allowing highly conformal treatments to be 
billed as 3D and thus used in the treatment of all patients with bone metastases.  
In addition, good preliminary data exists to support the use of the fan beam 
MVCT as a CT simulation image set for treatment planning and the use of CT 
detector -based exit dose methodology for quality assurance, making this system 
an excellent platform to pilot this research.

 1.3.7 STAT RT Workflow: Same Day CT Simulation, Treatment Planning, 
Treatment Delivery  
            As previously stated, we have already developed a STAT RT workflow 
for same day palliation that requires approximately 6 hours, and is a highly 
coordinated conventional workflow with kVCT simulation, treatment planning, 
treatment plan quality assurance, and then delivery of conformal hypofractionated 
radiotherapy.  All treatments are planned and delivered on FDA -approved 
systems.  We have treated over 30 patients to date with this workflow, and 
preliminary results reveal rapid and durable palliation with minimal acute 
toxicity.  This workflow allows patients to receive an entire course of palliative 
treatment from start to finish in 1 to 5 days, a process that conventionally takes 3 
weeks.  Since patients are billed for each individual treatment, requiring fewer 
treatments reduces health care costs  in addition to being more convenient .  With 
the STAT RT program we are now able to offer a unique workflow that delivers 
rapid, effective, and efficient pall iative radiotherapy that is cost effective, less 
toxic, and more convenient for cancer patients and their families.  The dose 
conformality of these treatments is excellent and will not be further optimized.  In 
this pilot clinical trial, for the primary sp ecific aim we will quantify patient 
outcomes following treatment with the current STAT RT workflow in an effort to 
determine its benefits and  risks to patients.  As a secondary aim, we will 
systematically evaluate and optimize the software necessary for th e clinical 
implementation of the more efficient Scan -Plan-Treat STAT RT workflow.  
1.3.8 Scan -Plan -Treat STAT RT Workflow: A Novel and More Efficient 
STAT RT Workflow  
 With recent advances in software and technology, we plan to further 
condense the STAT RT workfl ow into the Scan- Plan-Treat workflow, a 30 -
minute process in which all steps (MVCT simulation, diagnostic image co -
registration, treatment planning, and treatment delivery with real time quality 
assurance) are performed on the TomoTherapy unit.  This advanced workflow 
will eliminate the need for the patients to undergo a kvCT simulation on a 
separate unit as well as make it unnecessary for the patient to leave the treatment 
table between the simulation and treatment.  
1.3.9 Secondary Aims: Requirements For Clinical Implementation of the 
Scan -Plan -Treat STAT RT Workflow  
1) MVCT simulation image acquisition (10 minutes) then rigid or deformable 
image co -registration of existing diagnostic image sets with pre -contoured 
target and OAR volumes to the MVCT simulation scan for contour transfer 
(3-5 minutes).  
2) Rapid inverse treatment planning (3 -5 minutes).  
3) Monte Carlo secondary dose calculation (2- 3 min) 
4) At the Emily Couric Cancer Center location, simple real- time patient motion 
tracking via infrared cameras to ensure accur ate patient setup during MVCT

10 
 simulation and treatment delivery (concurrent).   No data for this aim will be 
collected at CRH.  
5) Patient -specific quality assurance using CT detectors during treatment 
delivery (10 minutes). 
   
 
1. New image co- registration workflow  
 In the conventional workflow, target volumes and OARs are contoured on 
recent diagnostic images (MRI, PET -CT, or diagnostic CT that are already 
available in the patient’s electronic radiology chart).  After the patient undergoes 
a kVCT simulation, the contoured diagnostic images are rigidly or deformably co-
registered to the kVCT simulation images, and the contours are transferred. This 
allows for high resolution diagnostic images to be used for tumor and normal 
tissue identification, which is not a lways possible to differentiate on CT 
simulation scans due to the resolution of standard wide bore CT simulation 
scanners.  Multiple commercial image processing systems are available for this 
image processing, and we are currently using Velocity® (Atlanta,  GA) image 
processing software.  Following treatment planning, the patient then undergoes 
image guided treatment delivery, a process in which a daily MVCT scan is 
obtained on the TomoTherapy unit and co -registered to the planning kVCT scan.  
Patient setup shifts can then be made to ensure accurate patient setup, and the 
patient is treated. Therefore, this is a two image co -registration workflow.  See 
Figure 4 . 
 
            A kVCT simulation scan has historically been used for simulation in the 
conventional workflow for both palliative and curative radiation planning. 
Compared to MVCT scans, it has higher resolution and allows the possibility for 
administration of iodinated IV and/or GI contrast, which makes it easier to 
identify soft tissues and bony anatomy  for treatment planning. However, contrast 
agents are not generally given for kVCT simulations of patients for palliative 
treatment of osseous metastases since the soft tissue and bone windows are 
adequate. MVCT scan soft tissue and bone windows have quite  reasonable 
resolution and can easily be co -registered to higher resolution diagnostic studies 
for contour transfer. MVCT scans are routinely co -registered to kVCT scans for 
image guidance on a daily basis.  Our preliminary data suggests that the 
optimization of this one step image co- registration workflow of diagnostic image 
sets to a MVCT simulation scan is clinically similar to the conventional two 
image co -registration workflow.

 2. Rapid inverse treatment planning on MVCT scans  
            CT image sets are used for radiation treatment planning because the 
electron density of tissues, which is required for calculating dose, is easily 
determined based on the Hounsfield units.  The tissue electron density 
determination is essentially the same for MVCT and kVCT scans.  It has 
previously been reported that as far as the dose calculations are concerned, 
treatment planning on either a kVCT simulation image set or an MVCT 
simulation image set yields treatment plans that are w ithin 1% of each other (38).   
 
           We have recently published that the TomoTherapy STAT RT treatment 
planning module can calculate SBRT and palliative treatment plans in just a few 
minutes (39). The computing speed of radiation treatment planning systems is 
about to take a quantum leap forward with the incorporation of new algorithms 
that will take advantage of the replacement of central processing units with 
graphic processing unit’s whose more rapid and parallel calculating potential can 
improve treatment plann ing speed by 10- 20 times (40, 41) .  Real time inverse 
treatment planning of IMRT or 3D TomoTherapy plans has not been a problem 
for patients treated with STAT RT to date.  We will compare planning times for 
current FDA -approved treatment planning systems as well as for newer, in -
development GPU -based algorithms.    Diagnostic Image  kVCT

3. Fast Monte Carlo based secondary dose calculation  
 Most treatments delivered on a traditional linear accelerator undergo a 
secondary dose calculation before the patient is treated.  The secondary 
calculation is compared to the dose calculated by the treatment planning system 
and must be within agreement before the treatment can be administered.  With the 
addition of Quan Chen to the research team, UVa now has access to a very fast 
secondary dose calculation algorithm specifically designed for TomoTherapy. 
Using this Monte Carlo based software, all treatment plans will be second 
checked for dose calculation accuracy.  
 
4. Optical tracking methods for patient intra- fractional motion monitoring 
 Consistent patient positioning during CT image acquisition and treatment 
is critical to ensure accurate d ose delivery.  Physical immobilization devices such 
as external body frames, aquaplast masks and other body molds, and vac -lock 
vacuum bags are commonly used to ensure patient positioning reproducibility.  X -
ray or CT image guidance prior to radiation deli very on the treatment unit is 
routinely employed in the clinic.  Methods for optical tracking of markers on the 
patient surface or of the patient’s skin surface are available to ensure consistent 
patient positioning after image guidance and during treatment, known as intra -
fractional motion  (42, 43) .  This provides a method without ionizing radiation for 
confirming patient position that can be used real time during the treatment 
process . With th is information, treatment can be paused if the patient’s position 
changes during treatment.   At the Emily Couric Cancer Center, we have 
developed an inexpensive in- house optical tracking system to monitor patient 
positioning real time that we will optimiz e in this protocol. Culpeper Regional 
Hospital does not have this imaging capability and patients treated on this 
protocol at CRH will not have optical surface tracking.  
 
5.  Novel CT -detector -based quality assurance methodology 
 Current standard of care T omoTherapy quality assurance methodology 
requires that each patient -specific treatment plan be delivered to a cylindrical 
plastic phantom with ion chamber and film measurement  or an array of radiation 
detectors  to ensure geometric and dose accuracy to within ± 3%.  However, this 
method does not measure the dose that the patient is receiving during treatment or 
provide full 3D dose verification. It causes another delay in delivering the first 
treatment to the patient as it requires approximately 30 -40 minute s to complete, 
and is generally done by a medical physicist after clinical patient care is finished.  
A methodology to monitor the patient exit dose in real time would increase 
patient safety through verification of daily treatment accuracy as well as expedite 
the treatment workflow.  Clearly, a real -time quality assurance methodology that 
does not require moving the patient off the TomoTherapy treatment couch for 
phantom measurements is essential for the development of a 30- minute Scan -
Plan-Treat workflow.   Current dose verification methodologies measuring dose at 
the time of patient treatment are limited to point measurem ents on the patient 
surface (44) , which is rarely in the target volume or a critical OAR, or though 
UVA IRB -HSR#:15625

Version/Date: 1.6 / 03.25.2013    
 
13 
 expensive implanted dosime ters (45, 46)  which are not practical for most 
palliative patients.  Since there is not a method to directly measure the three 
dimensional dose in the patient, alte rnative approaches are being developed and 
tested in academic clinical settings.  These alternative approaches reconstruct the 
delivered three dimensional dose distribution based on the measurement of either 
entrance or exit dose and back -projecting the me asurements onto simulation or 
image guidance CT image sets.   
 
 The opportunity to reconstruct dose from information collected during 
treatment became available with the incorporation of radiation imaging detectors, 
such as electronic portal imaging devices (EPID) on linear -accelerators and CT 
detector arrays on TomoTherapy.  Dose reconstruction using in- line EPID was 
first described by McNutt et al (47, 48) .  The EPID, when deployed during 
treatment, collects exit fluence from the patient and then back -projects this to X -
ray fluence before entering the patient; then, the dose in the patient is re -computed 
using this entrance fluence and the planning CT images.  However, there are 
many limitations  to EPID -based dose verification.  For example, the EPID was 
originally designed for semi -quantitative portal imaging; and for the purpose of 
dose reconstruction, it suffers from a narrow dynamic range, short life span, non-
linearity in the dose response, ghost artifacts from low temporal resolution, and 
cross -plane scatter photon contribut ion to the measured fluence (49) .  
Investigators are currently working on methods to overcome these challenges.  
 
          The To moTherapy unit has an in- line source -patient -detector geometry with 
CT ion chamber detectors that are used for daily MVCT scan image guidance for 
accurate patient positioning that remain in place during both imaging and 
treatment. See Figure 3 . These CT de tectors can also be used to measure the 
patient exit dose fluence and back -project this onto a planning CT scan for 
volumetric or 3D dose reconstruction. Dose verification on TomoTherapy was 
first studied by Kapatoes et al., who calculated the entrance flu ence from the exit 
dose using a transfer matrix, which is calculated based on the radiological path 
length from th e source to the detector  (50, 51) .  The use of a CT ion chamber 
array has mu ltiple advantages over EPID for exit fluence measurement.  It is more 
durable, and has a much longer life span.  It has a wider dynamic range and 
doesn’t limit treatment positions.  Finally, it is less sensitive to the noise from 
cross -plane scatter photon s that complicate EPI D-based dose reconstruction (52) . 
Our recently published preliminary data  show ed that the current TomoTherapy 
CT-detector based algorithm for dose reconstruction is robust with +/ - 3-5% 
accur acy which is well within the acceptable range for clinical care (53) . We will 
collect clinical data and continue to optimize this in -development software.  
           One drawback from the dose reconstruction method mentioned 
above is that it relies on the accurate knowledge of the patient geometry and 
attenuation at the time of the treatment.  This information may not be fully 
available nor accurate. This leads to the ambiguity in determining whether a 
discrepancy obser ved from the dose reconstruction is real (caused by the 
machine) or merely an artifact caused by the patient such as weight loss or 
UVA IRB -HSR#:15625

14 
 positional changes.  To remedy this, we have developed a method to detect if the 
multi- leaf collimator (MLC) is open or clos e based on the sharp change in the exit 
fluence independent of the patient attenuation (54) . In addition, the LINAC output 
and gantry angles during treatment are measured independently for quality 
assurance.  Combining t hose data, the impact of deviations during the treatment 
delivery can be evaluated through the MCL dose calculation.  The CT detector 
clinical data collected will also be used to optimize this in -development software.  
 
1.4 Preliminary Studies  
          We have performed significant preliminary research into optimizing each of 
the necessary steps for clinical implementation of the Scan -Plan-Treat STAT RT 
workflow as detailed below. Preliminary clinical data will be collected from 
patients treated with STAT RT on  this protocol to optimize the software required 
to develop the more efficient Scan- Plan-Treat STAT RT workflow. A Scan -Plan-
Treat workflow will not  be used on this clinical protocol. 
 
1. Preliminary Clinical Outcomes of Patients Treated with STAT RT  
 We h ave treated approximately 30 cancer patients with a conformal 
hypofractionated STAT RT treatment regimen for a variety of palliative 
indications.  We have treated patients with IMRT and 3D TomoTherapy planning 
modes and have extensive experience using the TomoTherapy planning systems 
for optimizing conformality of the radiation. Retrospective review of these 
patients shows that the majority of them  have had rapid and durable palliation of 
symptoms with minimal toxicity (unpublished data). In general, patien ts are 
extremely satisfied with the speed at which their treatment is initiated and the 
convenience of the hypofractionated regimens.   
 
2.  Preliminary Studies for Scan -Plan -Treat STAT RT implementation  
 
      a) New image co -registration workflow  
 FDA -approved imaging software for rigid and deformable co- registration 
and transference of target and OAR contours from diagnostic image sets to either 
kVCT or MVCT images is commercially available. We are using Velocity® 
image processing software.  Our prelimin ary unpublished data confirms that the 
MVCT scan has sufficient resolution, particularly of bone anatomy, for accurate 
co-registration to contoured diagnostic images and that this one step co-
registration process yields comparable agreement to the conventi onal two step 
image co -registration workflow with +/-  2-3 mm differences.   See Figure 4.  This 
level of agreement is consistent with results reported from image co -registration 
studies performed on a multi -institutional pediatric clinical trial with co -
registration data of 51 patients from 45 institutions using 11 different image 
software systems. They reported an inherent uncertainty of 2 mm for MRI to CT 
co-registration  (55) .  MVCT image guidance scans and kVCT simulatio n co-
registration occurs routinely in the clinic and only takes a few seconds, therefore, 
UVA IRB -HSR#:15625

15 
 we do not believe that this will be a rate limiting step in the clinical 
implementation of the Scan -Plan-Treat STAT RT workflow.   
 
   b) Rapid inverse treatment plan ning on MVCT scans  
 We have shown that accelerated treatment planning software for Helical 
TomoTherapy provides clinically acceptable dosimetry, with conformality and 
homogeneity that is superior to standard LINAC -based 3D conformal planning 
and is only sl ightly inferior to standard He lical TomoTherapy dosimetry (33). We 
have also shown that, with planning times of 2- 5 minutes, this accelerated 
treatment planning software provides levels of dosimetric conformality, 
heterogeneity, and avoidance of organs at risk for simple SBRT treatments that 
are clinically equivalent to those generated with conventional Helical 
Tom oTherapy treatment planning (39). This preliminary data supports t hat 
treatment planning speed in not likely to be rate limiting in the ultimate clinical 
implementation of the Scan -Plan-Treat STAT RT workflow.  
 
c)  Monte Carlo secondary dose calculation   
 We have clinically implemented a validated software second dose 
calculation check that reads TomoTherapy treatment plan information exported 
through DICOM and then performs a Monte Carlo dose calculation in a few 
minutes.  Our preliminary results show a 3D -dose distribution can be calculated 
within 2 -5 minutes (56) .  The software has been used clinically for 8 months on 
all patients treated on TomoTherapy at UVA with excellence results.  
  
   d)  Novel CT -detector -based quality assurance methodology  
Our pre -clinical evaluation of the CT -detector based exit radiation dose 
verification algorithm has been retrospectively studied by Sheng et al using in-
development softwar e (53). We compared with planned and delivered doses with 
the conventional phantom  quality assurance measurements for 24 patients and 347 
treatment fractions.  The concordance of planned to delivered dose calculated by 
the in -development software was show n to be ± 5%  (53) . This tolerance is within 
the standard of care of other current clinically available quality assurance 
methods.  We are also using the CT detector exit dose data to measure the MLC 
leaf opening time and comparing this with the calculated leaf opening time as a 
novel quality assurance  methodology.  
 
   e) Optical tracking methods for patient intra -fractional motion monitoring 
           At the Emily Couric Cancer Center, w e have recently developed an in -
house optical tracking system using multiple OptiTrack FLEX:V100 cameras 
(Natural Po int, Corvallis, OR). See Figure 4 .  The camera utilizes 26 infrared 
light- emitting diodes (LEDs) and a charge coupled device (CCD) to capture the 
reflective light from markers with special coating.  By using multiple cameras, the 
3D position of each reflec tive marker can be determined precisely.  Three 
reflective markers are fixed on a rigid body marker base that can vary in size from 
a few centimeters to much larger and create a “trackable” that can easily be placed 
on a patient’s surface to track their mo tion.  See Figure 5 . The x, y, z, yaw, pitch

and roll of the trackable can be detected by the camera system.  An in -house C 
program was developed to stream the data and display the position of the 
trackable in real time.  Multiple trackables can be placed on a patient and 
monitored simultaneously.  In the lab, localization precision of 0.1 mm was 
achieved (unpublished data).  Through strategic positioning of the trackables, 
movements of the head, neck, and extracranial locations can be closely monitored.  
This optical tracking technology is unique to ECCCC and is not available at CRH 
and patients treated at CRH will not undergo this experimental aspect of the trial.    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.5 Rationale for Study Design  
 As explained in the previous sections, conventional palliative radiotherapy 
for bone metastases offers only often modestly effective treatments that subject 
the patients to repeated visits to the treatment center and consume precious time 
and energy for ill patients and their families.  With the STAT RT workflow, we 
hypothesize  that we can offer more effective palliative treatments that are more 
efficient to plan and deliver, minimize toxicity, and require fewer total treatments.  
We are conducting this  investigator initiated prospective pilot clinical tr ial to 1) 
evaluate the effectiveness and patient satisfaction with STAT RT for patients with 
painf ul bone metastases, and 2) optimize those components of the workflow 
needed to create a 30 minute  Scan-Plan-Treat STAT RT workflow  . Further 
development for t his workflow has federal funding via a three - year 2012 CMS 
Innovation Challenge Award .    
  
 
Primary specific aim : Quantify the time for pain relief, amount of pain relief, 
opioid use reduction, functional scores, quality of life, and satisfaction of pat ients 
treated with STAT RT for osseous metastases.   
  
 The objective of palliative treatment is to relieve pain, improve function, 
and improve quality of life. These will be measured before and after treatment 
with the following endpoints : Figure 4: OptiTra ck Camera  Figure 5: Trackable

 • The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is a proven survey  to evaluate pain levels 
of patient’s with metastatic bone pain and their responses to treatment  
(57). 
• Patients will keep an analgesic use logbook and have their doses converted 
into Ora l Morphine Equivalent Doses (OMED).  In this way we can track 
changes in their opiod requirements. 
• Treatment response will be measured by the guidelines set forth by the 
International Bone Metastases Consensus Group (58) .  They have 
established a method to measure response to palliative R T accounting for 
opiate use.  These responses are categorized as: Complete Response, 
Partial Response, Pain Progression, Stable Pain.  See S ection 6.1.1 for 
details about this categorization.  
• The FACT -G and FACT -BP questionnaires are  proven measure s of 
quality of life for people wi th painful bone metastases  (59) . 
• Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) is a proven measure of functional 
status.  
  
 We hypothes ize that the convenience of the STAT RT workflow will 
result in high patient satisfaction.  The FACIT -TS-BTCSQ  survey has been 
shown to be an effective tool in measuring the satisfaction in patients being 
treated for metastatic bone disease (59).  Therefore, we have modified this tool  to 
suit our patient population, and we will use this survey to measure patient 
satisfaction a t each assessment .  
  
 Toxic ity will be assessed by CTCAE Version 4.0 and RTOG Late  
Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria.   These are common criteria used to asses 
the toxicity associated with radiation therapy.   The CTCAE will assess acute 
toxicity, and the RTOG Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria will asses s late 
toxicity, which is defined as  toxicity that occurs  3 months or more after treatment.  
 
Secondary Specific Aim : Optimize the integration of commercially available and 
in-development software to develop the Scan -Plan-Treat STAT RT workflow.  
 
As described in the background, this optimiz ation will require:  
1) rapid co -registration of diagnostic imag es onto MVCT simulation images for 
accurate contouring and treatment planning  
2) real-time patient- specific quality assurance using CT detectors during 
treatment delivery   
3) real-time patient motion tr acking to ensure accurate patient setup during 
MVCT simulation and treatment delivery.    
 
To implement rapid co -registration of diagnostic images onto MVCT 
simulation images into the workflow, we must first confirm that this image and 
contour -transferring  method is just as accurate as the conventional method.  
Again , the experimental method  requires  rigid and deformable co -registration of 
UVA IRB -HSR#:15625

Version/Date: 1.6 / 03.25.2013    
 
18 
 pre-contoured diagnostic image sets to MVCT simulation scans; and in the 
conventional method, pre -contoured diagnostic image sets are co -registered to 
kilovoltage CT (kVCT) simulation images, and then kVCT simulation images are 
co-registered to the MVCT s can. See Figure 4 .  Contours generated from these 
two different registration flows will be quantitatively compared as de scribed in 
detail in  Section 7.1.  
 
 Earlier  we described the advantages of  using the CT detector on the 
TomoTherapy unit  with  dose verification software  to provide  near real time 3D 
dose verification.  We must confirm that the use of the CT detector and dose 
verification software yields equivalent results to conventional phantom -based 
quality assurance.   Thus, e xit radiation dose measurement s and back- projected 
dose recalculation ve rification software will be compared to standard pretreatment 
phantom quali ty assurance measurements.   If we prove  the doses calculated by 
both methods to be equivalent, we could rely on only the CT detector and dose 
verification software for quality assurance in the future, which would further 
streamline the workflow.   
 
As descr ibed in the background and preliminary studies, our in- house 
infrared tracking system has been developed to monitor patient positioning during 
simulation and treatment delivery.  This  infrared tracking system will be validated 
by 10 healthy volunteers and then used to monitor patient motion during 
treatments  at the Emily Couric Cancer Center . The effectiven ess of the infrared 
tracking system will be determined by comparing its position calculations with 
the position changes  as determined by the position of the  treatment set up  lasers 
with respect to the  patient’s  set up skin marks before and after treatment. Patient 
tracking is an additional experimental quality assurance process that in no way 
affects the patient’s treatment and will not be implemented at C ulpeper Regional 
Hospital at this time.

• This is a n investigator -initiated, prospective, non- randomized, multi- centered 
pilot phase II trial.  The clinical trial will be open to accrual at UVA and CRH 
only.  
• We anticipate that it will take approximately 24 months to accrue 30 patients to 
this pilot study,  and each patient will plan to undergo 1 year follow -up.  
4.2 Treatment Dosage and  Administration : Radiation Therapy  
• Approved and consented patients will receive radiotherapy using the STAT 
RT workflow.   
• The patients will receive H elical TomoT herapy using the Hi Art system 
(TomoTherapy Inc).   
• Patients will receive a total of 2- 5 fract ions of high dose palliative radiation 
therapy consisting of 5- 10 Gy per fraction with a minimum biologic effective 
dose (BED) of 25 Gy.

Version/Date: 1.6 / 03.25.2013    
 
23 
 • Dose specifications:   The planning target volume  (PTV) will be prescribed a 
minimum BED of  25 Gy.  The maximum dose pre scribed will be a BED of 72 
Gy.  
• Variations of dose prescription:  There is a wide acceptable range of doses 
delivered to bone metastases in the palliative setting.  The appropriate dose will 
be determined by tumor histology (whether the tumor is radiosensi tive or 
radioresistant) and location of critical structures (to prevent radiation- induced 
toxicity to adjacent organs at risk).  Dose prescription will be at the discretion of 
the treating radiation oncologist, however will have to be at least a BED= 25 Gy . 
o Beam Energy  6 MV (TomoTherapy only has one beam energy)  
o Beam Shaping   All treatments will be delivered with conformal delivery 
with multi- leaf collimator beam modulation.  
• Localization, Simulation and Immobilization:    All patients will undergo non -
contra st enhanced kVCT simulations with standard immobilization devices:  
aquaplast masks for head, neck, upper thoracic PTVs, Vac -Lok cushions or 
custom headrests, body -fix immobilization system for spinal tumors are all 
permissible. Diagnostic contrast enhance d CT scans, PET CT scans, or MRIs 
from the patient’s PACS chart will be used to guide target and OAR contouring. 
The diagnostic images will be rigidly (MRI, contrast enhanced CT, PET CT) or 
deformably (contrast enhanced CT, PET CT) co -registered to the kVC T 
simulation in Velocity.   Following contour transfer to the kVCT simulation image 
set, the images will be reviewed and approved by a physician and then transferred 
to the TomoTherapy treatment planning station.   
• An experimental  contouring plan will be cr eated to compare to the conventional 
treatment plan but will not be  used in treatment planning .  We will experimentally 
co-register the contoured diagnostic images directly to the MVCT scan and 
generate the PTV and OAR contours using only the MVCT scan wit hout the 
kVCT intermediate .  Contours generated by both methods will then be compared.  
• Treatment planning/Target Volumes:  Dose will be prescribed to a PT V which 
will be a gross target volume  (GTV)  expanded by 0- 10 mm depending on critical 
adjacent structu res.  
• Treatment Planning: TomoHelical (rotational beam delivery) and TomoDirect 
(fixed beam delivery) techniques in either the IMRT and 3D planning modes are 
permissible.

 • Critical Structures  
The following ar e dose limitations to critical structures .   The se are accepted dose 
limitations that have been used in multiple clinical trials of  radiotherapy  (20, 60) .

Total Kidney Volume 
(L+R)  < 35% of volume  <15 Gy  
Stomach  Any point  30 Gy maximum  
Bowel  Any point  30 Gy maximum  
 
• Documentation requirements:  We will provide  a dosimetry form th at specifies 
the dosemetric criteria for the PTVs and OARs have been met  for each study 
subject .  This will ensure dosimetric compliance with PTV and OAR 
specifications .  The treating radiation oncologist must sign this form for the study 
to continue.   
• RT Quality Assurance:  Standard  quality assurance will be performed with all 
treatment plans.  This  involves the placement of a phantom with an array of 
radiation detecting ion chambers called OmniPro Matrixx  on the couch of the 
TomoTherapy unit.  The planned treatment is then delivered to the Matrixx  
phantom, and the ion chamber array  ensure s that the correct point dose and 
geometry is delivered .  This ensures that the patient will get the dose  as it was 
planned.  Then, while the phantom  and then the patient a re irradiated , the fluence  
of the radiation exiting the patient will be measured  by the CT detector.  The exit 
dose verification software will then  back -project this data  collected by the CT 
detector  onto the  planning CT scan for volumetric or 3D dose reconstruction.  
This calculated 3D dose s delivered  will then be compared to the measured dose 
recorded by  the phantom and also compared  to the planned dose.     
4.3 Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications  
Any patient who receives treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity.

Not applicable.  
4.6 Duration of Therapy  
In the absence of treatment delays due t o adverse events, treatment may continue 
for 2 to 5 fractions depending of the clinical situation.  We expect most patients to 
receive treatment s for less than 1 week, however, all treatments will be completed 
within 21 days.  Receiving treatment for > 21 days will be a  major  protocol 
violation.    Remaining fractions will be discontinued if: 
• Inter -current illness that prevent further administration of treatment  
• Unacceptable adverse events  
• The patient decides to withdraw from the study, OR  
• General or specif ic changes in the patient’s condition render the 
patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the 
investigator.  
4.7 Duration of Follow Up  
After removal from study, patients will be followed for 12 months after treatment 
was initiated or until death, whichever occurs first.  Patients removed from study 
for treatment -related adverse events will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of the adverse event.  
4.8 Pregnancy  
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) includes any female who has 
experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful  surgical  
sterilization  (hysterectomy ,  bilateral  tubal  ligation  or  bilateral oophorectomy) 
or is not postmenopausal [defined as amenorrhea  ≥ 12 consecutive months;  or 
women on hormone replacement therapy  (HRT) with documented serum follicle  
stimulating  hormone (FSH)  level  > 35 mIU /mL].  Even women who are using 
oral, implanted or inject able contraceptive hormones or mechanical products 
such as an intrauterine  device  or  barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, 
spermicides) to prevent pregnancy or practicing abstinence or where partn er is 
sterile (e.g., vasectomy), should be considered to be of child bearing potential. 
 
WOCBP  must  have  a  negative  serum  or  urine  pregnancy  test  (minimum  
sensitivity25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG, or in accordance with local 
regulations, whichever is more sensitive) within 7 days prior to the start of study 
treatment or in accordance with local regulations, whichever is of shorter 
duration. 
 
Prior to study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding 
pregnancy during trial  participation and the potential risk factors for an 
unintentional pregnancy.

27 
 All WOCBP MUST have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to first 
receiving study treatment.  If the pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not 
receive investig ational product and must not be enrolled in the study.  
 
In addition, all WOCBP should be instructed to contact the Investigator 
immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late 
menstrual period) at any time during study participatio n. 
 
Male subjects who are actively trying to conceive will be counseled to wait for 6 
months following radiation therapy to allow spermatogenesis to recover.  
4.9 Removal of Patients from Protocol Therapy  
Patients will be removed from study when any of the cri teria listed in Section 4.6 
apply.  Notify the Principal Investigator, and document the reason for study 
removal and the date the patient was removed in the Case Report Form.   The 
patient should be followed- up per protocol.     
4.10 Expected Adverse Events  
Depending on the site of treatment, potential / expected  treatment toxicities 
include Grade 1 to 3 toxicity of the following symptoms , with Grade 3 occurring 
in no more than the following percentages of patients:  
 
Dermatitis   20% 
Nausea  20% 
Fatigue  20%

 5.3 Final Study Visit  
The final study visit will occur at the 12 month visit.  See the Time and Events 
Table for assessments that will be performed.   Patients removed from st udy for 
treatment -related adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization 
of the adverse event  
5.4 Early Termination Visit  
Subjects may withdraw voluntarily from participation in the study at any time.   
At the time of withdrawal, the subject will be requested to provide their opioid 
logbook and complete t he following surveys: BPI, FACT -BP/FACT -G, and 
Satisfaction survey.  
 
Subjects may also withdraw voluntarily from receiving the study intervention for 
any reason.  If th at is the case, they w ill be encouraged to continue regular follow -
up evaluations according to the Time and Events table.  
 
As all of these patients have metastatic cancer and a limited life expectancy, it is 
likely that a reasonable percentage of study participants will choose hospice care 
before the completion of their follow -up.

Version/Date: 1.6 / 03.25.2013    
 
30 
  
OMED = Oral Morp hine Equivalent Dose  
* The total OMED intake over the most recent 72 hours will be 
calculated at each evaluation.  
6.1.2 Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall 
response is measured from the time measurement criteria 
are met f or Complete Response or Partial Response 
(whichever is first recorded) until the first date that Stable 
Pain or  Pain Progression is objectively documented. 
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date 
that Partial Response is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of stable pain:  Stable Pain is measured from the 
start of the treatment until the criteria for Pain Progression 
are met, taking as reference the baseline measurements 
recorded ju st prior to treatment. 
6.1.3 Response Review  
The endpoints in this study are all quantitative based on 
validated surveys and pain scores  that are reported by the 
patients .  Thus, we do not feel that a review by an expert 
independent of the study is necessary or valuable.  
6.2 Toxicity and Safety 
All patients who receive treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity 
using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4 and the  RTOG Late Radiation Morbidi ty 
Scoring Criteria at time  points indicated i n the Time and Events table in Section 
5.1.  
7.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
7.1 Study Design  
 This is a n investigator -initiated,  prospective, non- randomized, single -
centered phase II clinical trial .  This clinical tria l will have a primary aim of 
determining outcomes of patients treated with a conformal hypofractionated 
STAT RT treatment utilizing widely accepted surveys and questionnaires and 
clinical examinations.  The secondary aim is to collect clinical data to optimize 
software integration to develop the Scan- Plan-Treat STAT RT workflow that will 
make the entire process much quicker and efficient for the patient and clinic.  The 
University of Virginia diagnoses almost 3000 cancers annually and we treat 
UVA IRB -HSR#:15625 
PI: Paul W Read  
Version/Date: 1.6 / 03.25.2013    
 
31 
 approximately  80 patients with osseous metastases each year in the Department of 
Radiation Oncology. We anticipate it will take approximately 18 months to accrue 
30 patients to this pilot study.  
 
1) Primary Aim: Evaluation of Outcomes of Patients with Osseous 
Metastases Treated with STAT RT  
 We will recruit 30 cancer patients with 1 -3 painful osseous metastatic 
lesions (target sites) requiring opioid medication who are candidates for palliative 
radiation therapy.  Patients will receive 2- 5 fractions of 5- 10 Gy (minimum B ED 
of 25 Gy) of conformal radiation therapy delivered to the target sites via the 
Helical TomoTherapy system using the STAT RT workflow.  Patient pain, 
analgesic use, function, quality of life, and satisfaction will be recorded prior to 
treatment, at 1 wee k, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks , 6 months, and 12 months  after 
therapy using the following measures:  
a) The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)  
b) Patients will keep an analgesic use logbook and have their doses converted 
into Oral Morphine Equivalent Doses (OMED).   
c) Treatment response will be measured by the guidelines set forth by the 
International Bone M etastases C onsensus Group as described in S ection 
6.1.1.   
d) The FACT -BP and FACT -G questionnaires  
e) Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS)  
f) Patient Satisfaction will be measur ed by a modified  FACIT -TS-BTCSQ 
survey.  
       
 Radiation -induced treatment related toxicities will be captured during 
treatment and at the above time points and graded using the CTCAE Version 4.0 
and the RTOG Late Radiation Morbidity Score Criteria . 
 
2) Secondary Aim: Optimization of Software Integration for Scan -Plan -
Treat Workflow  
Several secondary investigational aims will be studied that will not be 
used in direct patient care but are essential in further streamlining the STAT RT 
workflow.  These compone nts will not subject the patient to any additional 
inconvenience or risk.  Standard patient -specific quality assurance will be 
performed on a Matrixx ion chamber array . 
 
a)  Optimization of  Novel Image Co- registration Workflow  
           The standard two step image co -registration process of contoured 
diagnostic images to kVCT simulation scans and then kVCT simulation scans to 
MVCT image guidance scans will be used to treat all patients. We will then 
experimentally co -register the contoured diagnostic images directly to the MVCT 
scan, and the PTV and OAR contours generated onto the MVCT scan by both 
methods will then be compared.  
To evaluate the conventional and the experimental image registration 
flows, the two registration flows will be compared in the follow ing manner:  
UVA IRB -HSR#:15625 
PI: Paul W Read  
Version/Date: 1.6 / 03.25.2013    
 
32 
 • Gross tumor volumes (GTVs) will be generated from both the 
conventional and experimental image registration flows. The differences 
in volume and the distances between the two centers of the GTVs will 
used to evaluate the similarity of the two G TV contours.  
• Spinal cord contours will also be generated from both registration flows. 
The point of the spinal cord that has the shortest distance to the center of 
the GTV will be identified for each contour.  The distance between the 
points from the two registration flows will be used to evaluate the 
similarity of the two cord contours. The volumes of the two cords will also 
be compared.  
• Quantitative evaluation of the contours will be performed using the Dice 
index.  Dice index is defined as the overlapping volume of two structures 
divided by the average volume of the two.  Clearly, Dice index is 1 if the 
two structures are identical and 0 if they do not share any voxel.  Dice 
index will be calculated in Velocity for contours generated on 
conventional and experimental image registration flows.  Dice indices of 
0.8 or higher are acceptable based on literature (61). 
 
b) Treatment Planning Speeds  
          We will determine the speed of radiation treatment planning with our 
current clinical system and compare this to the speed of planning with newer in-
development algorithms running on next generation computers with graphic 
processing units  (GPUs).  Since h ighly conformal radiation treatments must  be 
routinely calculated in a few minutes for the S can-Plan-Treat STAT RT 
workflow, we will determine if the treatment planning with GPUs is fast enough 
for clinical implementation (i.e. can be done in approximately 5 minutes).  If not, 
we will optimize the planning process in collabor ation with TomoTherapy, Inc to 
increase the speed of planning.  
 
c) Exit Radiation Dose Verification  
         In-development software provided by TomoTherapy Inc.®  will be used to 
measure the exit dose fluence, backproject this fluence as entrance fluence, an d 
then calculate the patient dose on the MVCT scan.  This software will be further 
optimized and refined on this clinical trial.  All patients’ radiation treatment plans 
will undergo standard of care phantom -based quality assurance measurements.  
The phant om exit dose will also be calculated via this software in this 
optimization process.  By comparing the values obtained with the software to the 
calculated treatment plan and phantom measurements, we hope to optimize this 
novel radiation dose verification s oftware to +/ - 3% calculated to delivered dose. 
Preliminary data shows that we are already at +/ - 5% calculated to delivered dose  
(53).  
 
d) Infrared Motion Tracking System  (UVA patients only)  
       An in -house developed infrared motion tracking system will be optimized  at 
the Emily Couric Cancer Center .  The system will initially be validated on 10 
UVA IRB -HSR#:15625 
PI: Paul W Read  
Version/Date: 1.6 / 03.25.2013    
 
33 
 healthy volunteers who will be instructed to lie still on the couch for 10 minutes. 
Following that, a small couch motion of 1- 5 mm will be introduced in the x, y and 
z directions and compared with the motion detected by the infrared cameras.  
After the system is validated with the healthy volunteers, it will then be used to 
monitor the intra -fractional motion of patients treated  on this protocol during 
treatment.   We anticipate having to modify/edit the software code during clinical 
implementation.   
 All patients undergoing treatment at UVA will have “set up” skin marks 
placed as is standard of care for laser alignment of the patient prior to MVCT scan 
image guidance, which is then used for finer (generally millimeter) adjustments of 
internal target volumes.  Following scanning we will note the position of the 
lasers with respect to the set up skin marks, and at the completion of  treatment we 
will again measure the location of the set up marks to the lasers.  With this data 
we can determine if the patient had moved after the image guidance MVCT or 
during treatment, and we will compare this with data from the infrared tracking 
system.  This system does not utilize ionizing radiation, add additional burdens or 
constraints, cause any discomfort or side effects, and is completely noninvasive.  
In reality, an additional layer of safety is added to the STAT RT treatment as any 
unexpected  patient motion will be monitored and reported.  We anticipate that this 
system will be able to accurately track patients with +/ - 2-3 mm of motion 
accurately.  
 
Stopping Rules:  
 
 The study will be suspended for a safety  review if 5 or greater “Probable” 
or “Definite” Serious Adverse Events occur or greater than 5 unexpected 
toxicities of >  Grade 3 occur.  
7.2 Sample Size and Accrual  
We performed  calculations to detect a change in patients’ BPI pain scores 
before and after treatment using the Wil coxon signed- rank test.  U sing the 
software G*Power 3.1.2 (University Kiel, Germany) the following calculations 
were made.  To detect a mean change of 2 units on the BPI scale with a standard 
deviation of 3, and achieve a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05 with 80% power, a sample si ze 
of 21 is needed.  Most studies report a mean improvement in pain scores of about 
3.5.  (32) .  Thus we anticipate an improvement by at least  3 on the BPI in our 
study, which should be adequately powered with 30 patients.  
 
 Since we have had accrual from prior studies of about 20 patients a year 
and this is a pilot study, we thought that a sample size of 30 subjects would be 
realistic for accrual and provide the necessary patient data for optimization of the 
software systems.  We treat approximately 30 patients with osseous metastases 
annually at UVA with palliative radiotherapy.  We anticipate an accrual rate of 20 
cases per year over 18 months.  Since the power analysis requires a sample size of 
UVA IRB -HSR#:15625 
PI: Paul W Read  
Version/Date: 1.6 / 03.25.2013    
 
34 
 21, accrual of 30 subjects would allow for dropouts and still have sufficient 
power.   
7.3 Data Analyses Plans  
 Treatment response as defined by International Bone Metastases 
Consensus Group will be determined for each patient.  As described in S ection 
6.1.1, pain intensity as defined by the BPI and opiate use as quantified by the 
OMED will be used to categorize patients as having: Complete Response, Partial 
Response, Pain Progression, Stable Pain.  At each evaluation, the patient’s BPI 
and OMED at that visit will be compared  to the pre -treatment levels.  The “Worst 
Pain” score from the patient’s BPI will be used to evaluate for treatment response.  
Patient response  does not require a statistical analysis.  The percentage of patients 
in each response category at each evaluatio n will be reported.  
 
 Patient pain will be recorded  using the BPI before treatment and at 
designated evaluations after treatment.  Pain scores before and after treatment will 
be compared using a Wilcoxon signed ranks test to determine if there is a 
statis tically significant difference.  Example: Pre -treatment vs. 1 week, Pre -
treatment vs. 4 weeks, etc.  
 
 Analgesic use will be recorded by requiring each patient to keep a logbook 
of their analgesic intake.  Their opiate intake for the last 72 hours will be 
converted to OMED at each evaluation and used in the categorization of treatment 
response.  The difference between their OMED before and after treatment will be 
compared using paired two- sample t -tests.   
 
 Patients’ functional status will be determined using the Karnofsky 
Performance Scale at each evaluation.  The difference between the KPS before 
and after treatment will be compared using a Wilcoxon signed ranks test.  
 
 Patients’ quality of life will be measured using FACT -BP and FACT -G 
scores at each eval uation.  The difference between the FACT scores before and 
after treatment will be compared using a Wilcoxon signed ranks test.   
 
 Patient satisfaction  will be measured  using a modified version of FACT -  
TS – BTCSQ.   No statistical analysis will be requi red for reporting the results.  
The average scores from the satisfaction survey will be reported.  
 
 To evaluate the CT detector dose calculations, the delivered radiation dose 
obtained using the phantom quality assurance  will be compared to the exi t 
radiation dose quality assurance  calculation .  The calculated dose and delivered 
dose for each patient  will be compared using a paired two- sample t -test, and the 
% difference in dose will be reported.  
 
UVA IRB -HSR#:15625

Version/Date: 1.6 / 03.25.2013    
 
35 
 Contours generated from the conventional and experimental i mage 
registration flows will be compared in a variety of ways  as described in S ection 
7.1.  All comparisons of the contouring measures , including the Dice indices, will 
be performed using paired two -sample  t-tests.  
  
 Toxicity will be recorded using CTCAE 4.0 criteria  and RTOG Late 
Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria .  The incidences of grade 3 or more 
toxicities  will be reported .   
 
 The effectiven ess of the infrared tracking  system  will be determined by 
comparing its position calculations with the positi on of the patient as determined 
by the position of the lasers with respect to the set up skin marks before and after 
treatment.  The position changes calculated by each method will be compared 
using paired two- sample t -tests.   
 
 The average treatment plan ning speed of radiation treatment planning with 
our current clinical system will be calculated and compared the average speed of 
planning with newer in- development algorithms running on next generation 
computers with graphic processing units.  These means will be compared with 
two-sample t -tests.  
8.0 ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING  
The treating physician is required to notify the UVA Data Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB), and the UVA Institutional Review Board (IRB -HSR) of any of 
any serious adverse event (SAE).   
8.1 Definition  
8.1.1 Adverse Event  
An adverse event is any undesirable medical experience occurring to a 
subject who has been given an investigational product, whether or not 
related to the study treatment(s). Medical conditions present before 
starting the investiga tional treatment /intervention will be considered 
adverse events only if they worsen after starting study treatment. The 
following are adverse events:  
  
• All unfavorable, harmful or pathological changes in the 
general condition of a patient. 
• Subjective or objective symptoms (spontaneously offered by 
the patient and/or observed by the Investigator or the study 
nurse).  
• All intercurrent events or exacerbation of pre -existing diseases 
which occurred after the administration of the study treatment.  
• All clinically significant changes in laboratory abnormalities.  
UVA IRB -HSR#:15625 
PI: Paul W Read  
Version/Date: 1.6 / 03.25.2013    
 
36 
 • Any undesirable and unintended effect of research occurring 
in human subjects as a result of the collection of identifiable 
private information under the research.  
 
AEs should be followed to resolution or st abilization, and reported as 
SAEs if they become serious (see below, definition of SAE).  This also 
applies to patient s experiencing AEs that cause interruption or 
discontinuation of investigational product, or those experiencing AEs that 
are present at th e end of their participation in the study.  Such patient s 
should receive post -treatment follow -up as appropriate.  AEs will be 
collected up to 30 days post last dose of study treatment in all cases 
including early study termination.  If an ongoing AE chang es in its 
severity or in its perceived relationship to study treatment, a new AE entry 
for the event should be completed. 
8.1.2 Unexpected Adverse Event  
An unexpected adverse event is any adverse treatment experience where 
the specificity or severity of which is  not consistent with the applicable 
product information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure for an unapproved 
investigational product or package insert/summary of product 
characteristics for an approved product).  
8.1.3 Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event o r experience (SAE)  or serious adverse drug 
reaction (ADR)  is any adverse event temporally associated with the 
subject’s participation in research that meets any of the following criteria: 
 Death;  
 Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred);  
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization;*  
 Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
 Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious 
adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical interv ention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
in the definition.  For reporting purposes, also consider the occurrences 
of pregnancy as an event which must be reported as an important 
medical event.  
 
*Hospitalization for anticipated or protocol specified pr ocedures such as 
administration of chemotherapy, central line insertion, metastasis 
UVA IRB -HSR#:15625 
PI: Paul W Read  
Version/Date: 1.6 / 03.25.2013    
 
37 
 interventional therapy, resection of primary tumor, or elective surgery, 
will not be considered serious adverse events.  
8.2 Attribution Assessment  
The Principal Investigator wi ll evaluate all AEs and assess their toxicity and 
attribution, if any, to study treatment.  The following criteria will define the 
attribution: 
 
Definite:   The AE is clearly relation to the investigational agent.  
Probable:  The AE is likely related to the investigational agent.  
Possible:  The AE may be related to the investigational agent.  
Unlikely : The AE is doubtfully related to the investigational agent.  
Unrelated : The AE is NOT related to the investigational agent.  
8.3 Serious or Unexpected Adverse Event Repo rting Requirements  
This section may need revision if Sponsor or Funding Source of study has specific 
reporting requirements for trial, and/or if study is conducted under an IND.  
  
For any serious or unexpected event which occurs to any patient in the cours e of 
their treatment on this study or within 30 days following cessation of treatment, 
the UVA Study Coordinator must inform:  
• The Principal Investigator verbally within 24 hours. 
• Written report to the UVA Office of Clinical Research, DSMC, 
and IRB within 7  days.  
 
Collection of complete information concerning SAEs is extremely important.  
Thus, follow -up information which becomes available as the SAE evolves, as 
well as supporting documentation (e.g., hospital discharge summaries and autopsy 
reports), should be collected subsequently, if not available at the time of the initial 
report, and immediately sent using the same procedure as the initial SAE report. 
8.4 UVA Cancer Center DSMC AE Reporting Requirements  
All adverse events will be recorded on appropriate cas e report forms. In addition, 
AE Reporting will occur via the UVA Cancer Center clinical trials reporting 
system, C3TO (TABLE Below).

9.0 DATA SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
The Principle Investigator will pr ovide continuous monitoring of patient safety in 
this trial with periodic reporting to the UVA Data Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC).  
9.1 Internal (Investigator) Study Monitoring Plan  
The University of Virginia Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) require s 
the Principal Investigator to review all patient data at least monthly and to provide 
a semi -annual report.  Review of adverse events assessment will be performed by 
the Principal Investigator with study personnel. Minutes of these meetings will be 
maintained and provided to the DSMC with the semiannual review. At these 
meetings the following will be discussed: 
 Participant safety (AE reporting)  
 Data validity, integrity, and completeness  
 Enrollment and retention  
 Protocol adherence  
 
In addition, the DSMC re quires semi -annual auditing by the Vice President of 
Research and Graduate Studies (VPRGS) compliance monitors. The VPGRS 
monitor’s semi- annual audit will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator and the 
DSMC Chair  
9.2 UVA Cancer Center Data Safety Monitorin g Committee  
 The University of Virginia Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC) will provide oversight of the conduct of this study.  The CC DSMC will 
report to the UVA Protocol Review Committee (PRC).  
 
 The DSMC will review the following :

The CC DSMC will meet every month for aggregate review of AE data.  Tracking 
report s of the meetings are available to the PI for review.  Issues of immediate 
concern by the DSMC are brought to the attention of the PI (and if appropriate to 
the PRC and IRB) and a formal response from the PI is requested.   Per the 
Cancer Center NIH approv ed institutional plan this study will be audited 
approximately every 6 months.  
10.0 STUDY MANAGEMENT  
10.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval and Consent  
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in 
accordance with federally  mandated regulations.  The IRB should approve the 
consent form and protocol. 
 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply 
with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) an d to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration 
of Helsinki. 
   
Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full 
explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent 
form. Eac h consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required 
by the FDA Regulations and local or state regulations. Once this essential 
information has been provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that 
the patient understands the implications of participating in the study, the patient 
will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by signing an 
IRB-approved consent form. 
 
Prior to a patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form 
should be signe d and personally dated by the patient and by the person who 
conducted the informed consent discussion. 
10.2 Registration Procedures  
All patients must be registered with the C3TO at the University of Virginia 
Cancer Center before enrollment to study.   
10.3 Adherence to the Protocol  
Except for an emergency situation in which proper care for the protection, safety, 
and well -being of the study patient requires alternative treatment, the study shall 
be conducted exactly as described in the approved protocol.

 10.3.1 Emergency Modifications  
Investigators may implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to 
eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to trial subjects without prior IRB -HSR 
approval/favorable opinion.   
 
For any such emergency modification implemented, a UVA IRB m odification 
form must be completed by study Personnel within five (5) business days of 
making the change.   
10.3.2 Single Patient/Subject Exceptions  
Any request to enroll a single subject who does not meet all the eligibility criteria 
of this study requires the a pproval of the Principal Investigator and the IRB.  
10.3.3 Other Protocol Deviations/Violations  
All other planned deviations from the protocol must have prior approval by the 
Principal Investigator and the IRB.   
 
Protocol Deviations: A protocol deviation is any unplanned variance from an 
IRB approved protocol that:  
• Is generally noted or recognized after it occurs  
• Has no substantive effect on the risks to research participants  
• Has no substantive effect on the scientific integrity of the research plan 
or the value  of the data collected  
• Did not result from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the 
investigator(s).  
 
CRC of record will record the deviation, and report to any sponsor or data and 
safety monitoring committee in accordance with their policies.  D eviations should 
be summarized and reported to the IRB at the time of continuing review.  
 
 
Protocol Violations: An unplanned protocol variance is considered a violation if 
the variance:  
• Has harmed or increased the risk of harm to one or more research 
participants.  
• Has damaged the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study.  
• Results from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the 
investigator(s).  
• Demonstrates serious or continuing noncompliance with federal 
regulations, State laws, or Univ ersity policies.  
 
Violations should be reported by CRC of record to the IRB within one (1) week 
of the investigator becoming aware of the event.

 10.4 Record Retention  
Study documentation includes all Case Report Forms, data correction forms or 
queries, source documents, Sponsor -Investigator correspondence, monitoring 
logs/letters, and regulatory documents (e.g., protocol and amendments, IRB 
correspondence and approval, signed patient consent forms).  
 
Source documents include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical 
activities and all reports and records necessary for the evaluation and 
reconstruction of the clinical research study.  
 
Government agency regulations and directives require that all study 
documentation pertaining to the conduct of a cli nical trial must be retained by the 
study investigator.  In the case of a study with a drug seeking regulatory approval 
and marketing, these documents shall be retained for at least two years after the 
last approval of marketing application in an Internati onal Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH) region.  In all other cases, study documents should be kept 
on file until three years after the completion and final study report of this 
investigational study.  
10.5 Obligations of Investigators  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for the conduct of the clinical trial at the 
site in accordance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations and/or the 
Declaration of Helsinki.  The Principal Investigator is responsible for personally 
overseeing the treatment of all st udy patients.  The Principal Investigator must 
assure that all study site personnel, including sub- investigators and other study 
staff members, adhere to the study protocol and all FDA/GCP/NCI regulations 
and guidelines regarding clinical trials both durin g and after study completion. 
 
The Principal Investigator at each institution or site will be responsible for 
assuring that all the required data will be collected and entered onto the Case 
Report Forms. Periodically, monitoring visits will be conducted and the Principal 
Investigator will provide access to his/her original records to permit verification 
of proper entry of data. At the completion of the study, all case report forms will 
be reviewed by the Principal Investigator and will require his/her final  signature 
to verify the accuracy of the data.

EVALUATING A NOVEL STRATEGY: THE SYNERGY IOL MIXED AND MATCHED WITH THE SYMFONY 
WITH INTELILIGHT  
 
Presbyopia- correcting intraocular  lenses (IOLs) have evolved rapidly in recent years. Such IOLs 
include extended depth of focus (EDOF) and multifocal (MF) IOLs. The goal of these lenses and 
their various iterations over time has been to provide an excellent range of focus at distance, intermediate, and near distances, good quality of vision and contrast sensitivity under different 
lighting conditions, good reading ability, and the minimization of photic phenomena. The TECNIS Synergy IOL is a one -piece presbyopia correcting IOL available in  non-toric and toric versions that 
was introduced to the US market in June 2021.  
 
At our center, we were the first site in the US to implant the Synergy (June 7, 2021) and have 
been using the IOL ever since. This Synergy IOL is part of the TECNIS platform,  which is composed 
of time -tested hydrophobic acrylic material with ultraviolet and violet light absorber, 6 -mm 
aspheric optic, refractive index of 1.47, and continuous 360 ° posterior square edge design. The company boasts that the new Synergy IOL combine s the benefits from the TECNIS Multifocal and 
TECNIS Symfony (EDOF) diffractive designs, and that it delivers a wider range of continuous vision and better near vision in day and night than a leading trifocal IOL.
1  
 
Early reports from many centers across the country and other countries appear to indicate that 
the Synergy IOL implanted bilaterally is yielding very good results at all ranges, particularly at 
near.2-4 Anecdotally, some surgeons have reported excellent near vision with good but not great 
distance vision.  
 Prior to utilizing the Synergy IOL, our center along with many high -volume centers across the 
country, employed a mix and match strategy utilizing th e TECNIS Symfony in the dominant eye 
and the TECNIS Multifocal in the non -dominant eye with good results and high patient 
satisfaction.
5  
 We propose conducting a prospective evaluation of a mix and match strategy incorporating Symfony with InteliLight in the dominant eye and Synergy IOL in the non -dominant eye. The 
Symfony lens, an Extended Depth of Focus (EDOF) lens, known for its superior distance and intermediate vision, has been upgraded to the OptiBlue version  (InteliLight). The Symfony with 
InteliLig ht has an enhanced echelette design and a violet light filter. The upgraded echelette 
design utilizes a high -resolution lathing process that helps reduce light scatter and halo intensity. 
The violet light filter is designed to mitigate halo, glare, and starbursts.  
 
1. OBJECTIVE:  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the visual outcomes, visual disturbances, patient 
satisfaction and spectacle independence of the Symfony wit h InteliLight when implanted in

completed Visit 3 or have been terminated from the study.  
 
6. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
6.1. Sample size  
A total of 4 0 subjects will be enrolled. In order to  calculate the sample size, we need to 
know an accurate estimate of the standard deviation of the outcome measure which we 
do not know; therefore, we consider this study a pilot trial.  When estimating the sample size for a pilot study, the simplest method  is to apply a sample size rule of thumb. 
Browne suggests a general flat rule to ‘use at least 30 subjects or greater to estimate a parameter’.
 
 
6.2. Statistical Analysis  
All data will be collected by the site and entered into a database. Subjects will be assigned an ID number. Data analysis will be performed without patient identification. 
Statistical analysis will be performed using standard descriptive statistics and other tests as deemed appropriate based on the characteristics of the data to be analyzed. A ll 
statistical tests will be two -sided and interpreted at a 5% significance level. Vision 
satisfaction, spectacle independence and visual symptoms will be compared to a historical control of patients implanted bilaterally with Synergy OU . Data analysis will be 
conducted by a third -party consultant.  
 
6.3. Safety Analyses  
The type, severity, duration and frequency of reported ocular adverse events will be tabulated for each group. Adverse events will also be summarized for events that were considered treatment- related. Comparison of treatment groups with respect to the 
prop ortion of study patients reporting adverse events will be made using Fisher’s Exact 
Test.  
 
7. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
 
7.1. Confidentiality  
To ensure confidentiality in this study, records of the participants will be examined only by the principal investigator and research staff involved in the study.  Study records will be kept 
on file.  Any statistical analysis and publication will not include any subject identifiers.  Medical records will be made available only for review by the investigators, Sponsor Company or Research Institution, the IRB, and other State or Federal Regulatory Agencies, if 
necessary.  All information in these records will be kept confidential.

CONFIDENTIAL  CFS 22-001 Version 1. 1 18Aug2022  
7.2. Records Retention  
The PI is accountable for the integrity, retention and s ecurity of all study related data. The 
investigator must maintain accurate, complete and current records relating to the clinical  
study. The investigator must maintain the required records during the investigation and for a 
period of 2 years after the date  on which the investigation is terminated or completed  then 
records will be scanned and kept electronically in a secured server.  
 
8. STUDY MONITORING, AUDITING, AND INSPECTING  
The nature and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that o riginal data 
required to complete the case report forms (CRFs) exist and are accessible for verification.  If electronic source records are maintained, these records must be 21 CFR Part 11 compliant 
and will be printed and certified for verification as nee ded.  
 
Required examination must be recorded on the CRFs. CRFs will be used as source document.  All data reported must have corresponding entries in the source documents. The principal investigator or sub -investigator must review the reported data and cer tify that the CRFs are 
accurate and complete. No subject identifiers should be recorded on the CRFs beyond subject number, subject initials and study specific identifiers.  
 Data from CRFs will be entered into a database. Upon completion of the CRFs, the da ta will 
be reviewed by study designated personnel and statistician for accuracy and completeness. If corrections and/or any additions to the data are deemed necessary, queries will be generated. Designated research staff expected to respond to data queries  in a timely manner 
and ensure that the corrections and changes made to the data in the database are reflected in the subjects’ source documentation. Any changes will need to be initialed and dated by 
the authorized personnel making such changes.  
 
Data will not be sold to third parties.  
 
9. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  
 
9.1. Description  
The Symfony InteliLight IOL (DXR00V or DXW150 –  375 – Toric II IOL) combines an 
echelette design (to create an extended depth of focus) with an achromatic technology (to correct chr omatic aberrations) and a violet -light filter that diminishes the perception 
of visual disturbances such as halo, glare and starburst. The lens has been designed to provide high quality vision up to 26 inches so patients may still need to wear glasses for some activities mainly at near.  
 
The Synergy IOL (DR00V or DFW150 -375 – Synergy Toric II IOL) using TECNIS Simplicity 
Delivery System is a presbyopia correcting IOL designed to improve intermediate and 
 
Soscia W, Sandoval HP   11

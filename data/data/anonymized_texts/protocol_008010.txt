1.0 Background  and Rationale  
 
1.1 Introduction:  
Sarcopenia  increases the risk of a number of deleterious health conditions and represents a 
major financial cost to our healthcare system. Among older adults who are hospitalized, those 
with sarcopenia on admission are 5 -fold more likely to incur higher hospital cos ts than those 
without  (1). The operational definition of sarcopenia is defined as meeting the criteria for all of 
the following: low muscle strength, low muscle quantity or quality, and low physical 
performance. The diagnosis of sarcopenia requires techniq ues that are both expensive and 
operator -dependent. Simple measurements, such as BMI, do not necessarily identify 
sarcopenia. Importantly, current techniques can only identify sarcopenia after a 
physical/functional impairment has occurred. Skeletal muscle amino acid kinetics predict 
muscle health and functionality  (2). Altered amino acid kinetics lead to decrements in muscle

 mass, quality, and performance. Our laboratory, as well as others, have documented that the 
muscle response to circulating essential a mino acids (EAA) determines muscle amino acid 
kinetics  (2). Thus, we propose to characterize skeletal muscle amino acid kinetics to an EAA 
challenge, i.e., an oral amino acid tolerance test (OATT), in order to determine the state of 
muscle health. Analogou s to the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) used to characterize 
alterations in glucose metabolism, the proposed OATT represents a potential low -cost solution 
to classifying patients’ skeletal muscle health. The extrapolation of this work is the 
developmen t of a simple analytical tool that would provide clinicians the ability to discern 
alterations in muscle amino acid kinetics prior to a loss of function.  
 
1.2 Previous research on the topic  
The rate of loss of muscle with aging in any given individual is variable and may be influenced 
by genetic factors, level of activity, amount of protein in the diet, total body weight, and 
occurrence of serious diseases that directly affect muscle mass and  function.  Nonetheless, the 
estimate from cross -sectional data that between 0.5 -1.0 % of muscle mass is lost per year 
after the age of 70 years is reasonable (3). The physiological basis for loss of muscle over time 
results from an imbalance between the ra tes of muscle protein synthesis and breakdown.  
Consumption of dietary protein results in the absorption of amino acids and the activation of 
protein synthetic processes throughout the body, particularly muscle protein synthesis ( 4). 
There is a direct relat ionship between the amount of dietary protein intake and the net gain in 
body protein in young healthy individuals ( 5). Anabolic resistance refers to the circumstance in 
which dietary protein has a diminished stimulatory effect on the net production of new  muscle 
protein.  Critical illness ( 6) or the response to a major burn injury ( 7) provide clear -cut examples 
of anabolic resistance.  In anabolic resistance associated with these pathological conditions, 
the normal linear relationship between dietary protein  intake and net protein synthesis is 
capped, meaning that beyond a certain level of protein intake there is no further gain in net 
protein balance.  For example, beyond a level of protein intake of 1.1 g protein/kg/day there is 
no net gain in body protein i n critically ill patients ( 6). Once the maximal rate of protein 
synthesis is reached, there is no further gain in net protein synthesis, as the rate of protein 
breakdown is not affected by dietary protein consumption in severely catabolic patients.  The

 consequence of exceeding the amount of dietary protein intake that maximizes the net gain in 
body protein is the oxidation of the “extra” amino acids.  As a result of the oxidation of a large 
percentage of dietary amino acids, urea and ammonia production incre ase significantly ( 7). 
Since this clinical population often has multi -organ failure, including impaired kidney function, 
an increase in urea and ammonia production can have adverse physiological consequences.    
Aging -related anabolic resistance is differen t than anabolic resistance associated with critical 
illness.  Differences in the basic metabolic responses of protein metabolism in the two 
circumstances can explain the basis for the different nature of anabolic resistance. In critical 
illness , the loss of  muscle protein is driven by a high rate of protein breakdown, which may be 
as much as 3 fold above normal ( 8). The high rate of protein breakdown flo ods the 
intramuscular pool with free amino acid precursors for protein synthesis, driving up the rate of 
protein synthesis.  As a result, although protein synthesis is significantly less than the 
accelerated rate of breakdown in critical illness, protein synthesis is already driven close to the 
maximum rate without any intake of protein or amino acids ( 8). Since precursor supply is 
already high because of accelerated protein breakdown, provision of dietary protein or amino 
acids in critically ill patients has only a small effect on precursor availability and thus muscle 
protein synthesis.  In healthy elderly indi viduals, basal rates of muscle protein synthesis and 
breakdown are not measurably different from younger individuals.  As a result, protein 
synthesis can be increased by consumption of even small amounts of amino acids ( 9). In 
contrast, o lder adults are less responsive to the anabolic stimulus of low doses of amino acid  
or protein  intake  compared to younger individuals ( 10). Limited responsiveness of muscle 
protein synthesis at lower levels of intake but a similar maximal protein synthetic response 
sugges ts that the slope of the line relating the increase in muscle protein synthesis relative to 
increasing amounts of dietary protein consumption is less in elderly, but ultimately reaches the 
same maximum value as in younger individuals. However, behavior cha nge, in this case 
increasing dietary protein to maximize muscle protein synthesis to blunt age -related losses of 
skeletal muscle, are difficult in elderly adults (11). Therefore, identification of individuals at risk 
for sarcopenia sooner in life are requi red. Considering changes in muscle protein kinetics 
precede functional outcome changes (e.g. muscle strength ), assessment of postprandial 
amino acid metabolism represents a likely solution. The relationship between protein intake

 and muscle protein synthes is has been demonstrated to be driven by the change in plasma 
essential amino acid concentrations ( 2). Stated another way , the changes in plasma essential 
amino acid concentrations following the ingestion of dietary protein drive the increase in 
muscle pro tein synthesis. The analogous parallel to amino acid and muscle is the use of the 
oral glucose tolerance test used to classify individuals with prediabetes and type -2 diabetes. 
Therefore, demonstrating th at the  essential amino acid response to an oral amin o acid 
challenge can differentiate between elderly and young populations is a worthwhile first step in 
developing a new clinical diagnostic test to identify sarcopenia.  
 
2.0 Hypothes es 
 
We hypothesize that plasma amino acid response will be altered in elderly sarcopenic adults 
as compared to young  and elderly healthy  subjects . 
We also hypothesize that the pharmacokinetics of plasma amino acids can be used to 
distinguish sarcopenic elderly from young and elde rly healthy . 
 
3.0 Study  Design  and Procedures  
 
We will enroll up to 35 subjects with a goal to study up to 30 healthy male and females : a 
group of 10 whose age is  between 18 and 30  years,  a group of 10 whose age is 70-89 years  
without the presence of sarcopenia, and a group of 10 whose age is 70 -89 years  with 
sarcopenia . We will use a 5 -hour (one hour prior and 4 hours post -consumption  of an amino 
acid supplement)  period to completely characterize the plasma amino acid response  to 10 
grams of free -form essential amino acids  of which  10% of the leucine content has been 
enriched with L-[1-13C] leucine . The principal end -point will be plasma amino acid response 
over the 4 hours following the consumption of the study product . 
Secondary endpoints include  body composition and total body water measurements. Small 
shifts in fluid from the extracellular to intracellular space likely correspond with EAA 
appearance and disappearance in plasma. BIA is a non -invasive, rapid assessment t hat is 
sensitive to acute shifts in fluid that are associated with disease and malnutrition states, such

 as sarcopenia. As an exploratory analysis, we will measure acute shifts in total body, 
intracellular, and extracellular fluid using multifrequency BIA throughout visit 2 . This will serve 
as preliminary data on a potential non -invasive method to evaluate muscle quality, anabolic 
resistance, and a proxy indicator of sarcopenia . 
 
3.1 Study Visits  
Visit 1: subjects will come to the UAMS TRI for informed consent discussion. Once consent is 
obtained, subsequent study procedures will be performed. A medical history  including allergies  
and list of current medications will be obtained . Females of child b earing capacity will be asked 
to provide a urine sample for pregnancy testing  prior to the DEXA scan . Exceptions will be 
made for women who have recently (past week) or currently are menstruating , have an 
implanted uterine device, or  women who are celibate . Urine samples will be sent to LabCorp . 
Subjects will be asked to perform the following tests and measurements at visit 1:  
Standing height without shoes (in cm),  
Body weight without shoes (in kg),  
Handgrip strength testing of their dominant hand (3 reps, in kg),  
10-meter usual gait speed test,  
5-rep timed chair stand test,  
SARC-F (paper) questionnaire  (older subjects only) . 
 
If subject meets the requirements  (fasted for at least 8 hours, caffeine -free for at least 12 
hours, and did not perform strenu ous exercise during the past 24 hours)  to perform the DEXA 
scan and In Body scan on visit 1, these tests will be performed at that time. If they do not, 
these tests will be performed at Visit 2.  
 
Visit 2 (approximately 1 week after visit 1): Subjects return to the UAMS TRI having fasted for 
at least 8 hours, avoided caffeine for at least 12 hours, and avoided strenuous exercise during 
the past 24 hours. They will be asked about any adverse events since las t visit. The In Body  
and DEXA scan s will be performed if these were not done at visit 1.  Prior to the IV insertion, an 
In Body scan will be performed if not already performed on this visit.

 The study nurse will insert an IV catheter into a vein o f one of the subjects’ arms  to use for 
periodic  blood sampling , warming the arm by means of a heating pad or a heated plastic box . 
After an i nitial blood sample is obtained, a  timer is started and blood samples and In Body 
scans will be obtained according to th e schedule below. The study product  (dissolved in ~ 10 
ounces of water  along with the stable isotope L-[1-13C] leucine ) is served directly after the third 
blood sample . Subjects are asked to consume the drink  within 1 minute.  
Using a mask that covers their mouth and nose, subjects exhaled breath will be collected to 
measure the appearance of the labelled carbon in the leucine isotope in  expired  CO 2. The 
mask will be worn for approximately 2 minutes prior to every blood sample ti me point after the 
initial sample. A 1 -2 minute period of breath analysis will occur at the designated blood sample 
collection times . The mask can remain off between collection periods.  
At the conclusion of 5 hours elapsed time , the IV catheter will be rem oved and the site dressed 
with a bandage. A snack and beverage will be offered to the subject. Subject will then be free 
to leave.

 5.0 Risks and Benefits  
 
There are no direct  benefits for the subjects. Expected risks associated with this protocol are 
described in detail below. All experimental procedures will be performed by appropriately 
trained and credentialed personnel.  
 
5.1 Blood sampling:  
Blood samples will be collected  solely for the purpose of experimentation. The blood will be 
used to measure plasma amino acid concentrations  and possibly stable isotope enrichment , 
glucose, and insulin . The total amount of blood taken will be approximately 60 mL. Subjects 
shou ld have no noticeable effects  from this volume . 
 
5.2 DEXA , In Body scan s: 
The DEXA scan exposes subjects to approximately ½ of the radiation of one chest x -ray. 
Subjects  will undergo 1 DEXA scan.  The In Body scan s do not pose any risks.  
 
5.3 Physical and Functional Testing : 
The primary risk s are fatigue and muscle soreness.  
 
5.4 Study supplement : 
The test composition is a patented mixture of 10 grams of amino acids (total of 17.8 grams of 
commercial product: XS Muscle Multiplier ) dissolved into approximately 10 ounces of water . It 
is a comme rcially available product manufactured by Prino va™ Solutions  (Prinovausa.com) . 
All components of the composition have been ruled as Generally Rega rded as Safe (GRAS) 
by the FDA.  
 
5.4.1 Conflict of Interest  
UAMS and Dr. Ferrando are listed  on the approved patent for this particular amino acid 
supplement. There is an approved COI plan on file for Dr. Ferrando. He will not have access to 
raw data, only a summary of the compiled data.

5.5 Stable Isotope Ingestion : 
There are no known risks of ingestion of the stable isotope  of leucine.  
 
5.6 Confidentiality:  
A potential risk is the loss of confidentiality.  Measures to protect the confidentiality of study 
participants will be implemented as described in the Data Handling and Record  keepi ng 
section below . 
 
5.7 Breath Sampling  
The only risk of breath sampling is potential claustrophobia and subsequent anxiety.  
 
6.0 Data Handling and Recordkeeping  
 
Source documents , paper questionnaires  and consent forms , and CRFs will be stored in a 
secure area of the PI’s laboratory. Access will be limited to study personnel. Documents 
containing identifiers will be destroyed by shredding approximately 7 years after data analysis 
is completed  or publication of data; whic hever is longest . At no time shall Protected Health 
Information be released to non -study personnel.  
The Principal Investigator will carefully monitor study procedures to protect the safety of 
research subjects, the quality of the data and the integrity of the study.  All study subject 
material will be assigned a unique identifying code or number.  The key to the code (the 
instrument associating the data with subject identity) will be kept on a password -protected 
UAMS server, located behind locked  doors in a restricted access area of the UAMS campus.  
The code file will contain subject initials, sex, subject ID, enrollment data, and anthropometric 
data; it will not include any identifiers. Only those individuals listed on the title page of this 
protocol and their research staff members will have access to the code and information that 
identifies the subject in this study.  This file will be deleted approximately 7 years after data 
analysis is completed.

 7.0 Data Analysis  
 
7.1 Statistical Analysis plan 
Means by which experimental data will be analyzed or interpreted: Changes in the plasma 
amino acids area under the curve (AUC), maximal amino acid concentration, change from 
basal to maximal amino acid concentrations, rate to maximal amino acid concentration, and 
the clearance rate of amino acids from the plasma will be assessed with an one -way ANOVA 
with appropriate post hoc testing . Statistical significance will be accepted at an alpha level of p 
≤ 0.05.  
 
7.2 Sample Size Calculation & Power Analysis  
Statistical power and sample size are based on previous studies investigating differe nces in 
plasma amino acids  in younger and older adults following the ingestion of 10 grams of free 
form essential amino acids  (12). For peak EAA concentrations previous studies have 
demonstrated an effect size (Cohen’s D) of 1.6 between health young and individuals with 
incipient sarcopenia. This effect size indicates we need 8 individuals in each group to detect a 
significant differe nce at an alpha level of 0.05 with 80% power.  
 
7.3 Sample Processing and Analyses  
Blood samples will be processed and analyzed as described by PI’s lab ( 2). Blood samples will 
be analyzed via LCMS to determine  the concentration of specific amino acids rel evant to the 
hypothesis.  If performed, glucose and insulin concentrations will be performed using a COBAS 
analyzer. Stable isotope concentrations will be measured using either GC -MS or LCMS 
methods, if performed . Breath samples will be analyzed in real tim e via the collection 
apparatus.  After all data has been analyzed and verified, samples will be discarded into a 
biohazard trash bag and disposed in accordance with UAMS biohazardous waste policy.  
 
7.4 Grouping  
Subjects in the older groups will be divided into either sarcopenic or non -sarcopenic based on 
the results of the handgrip assessment at visit 1  and amount of lean tissue derived from the

 body composition measurements . The thresholds (per the Sarcopenic De finitions and 
Outcomes Consortium) are as follows : 
Men whose value is < 35.5 kg are considered to have low muscle strength  
Women whose value is < 20 kg are considered to have low muscle strength.  
 
8.0 Ethical Considerations  
 
This study will be conducted in accordance with all applicable government regulations 
and University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences research policies and procedures.  This 
protocol and any amendments will be submitted and approved by the UAMS Institutional 
Review Board (IRB ) to conduct the study.  
The formal consent of each subject, using the IRB -approved consent form, will be obtained 
before that subject is submitted to any study procedure.  All subjects for this study will be 
provided a consent form describing this study and  providing sufficient information in language 
suitable for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this study.  The 
person obtaining consent will thoroughly explain each element of the document and outline the 
risks and benefits, alternate treatment(s), and requirements of the study.  The consent process 
will take place in a quiet and private room, and subjects may take as much time as needed to 
make a decision about their participation.  Participation privacy will be maintained and 
questions regarding participation will be answered.  No coercion or undue influence will be 
used in the consent process.  This consent form must be signed by the subject and the 
individual obtaining the consent.  A copy of the signed consent will be offered  to the participant, 
and the informed consent process will be documented in each subject’s research record.  
 
9.0 Dissemination  of Data  
Results of this study may be used  for presentations, posters, or publications. The publications 
will not contain any identifiable information that could be linked to a participant.

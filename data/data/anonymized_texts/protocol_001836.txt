Ketamine for Rib Fractures Study  Protocol Version Date: 13 January 2021 iii ABSTRACT Introduction:  Thoracic trauma creates a significant burden of morbidity and mortality in those suffering from blunt traumatic injuries. Optimal contemporary management of blunt thoracic injury includes intravenous narcotics, epidural analgesia, and both noninvasive and invasive positive pressure ventilation for those patients that progress to respiratory failure. In 2019, the Medical College of Wisconsin published the first randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of a low-dose ketamine infusion on pain scores (primary outcome), opioid analgesic use, epidural rates, and pulmonary complications in adult and elderly patient with 3 or more rib fractures. Their results demonstrated decreased oral morphine equivalents (OME) utilization, but only in severely injured patients (ISS>15). Their results were otherwise equivocal and additional study was recommended. Low dose ketamine therapy has been examined in multiple studies as a therapeutic adjunct for postoperative analgesia (FDA off-label use). In this capacity it has been shown to significantly lower pain scores and reduce narcotic requirements. We hypothesize that low-dose ketamine infusion will decrease narcotic use (OME), improve pain control, and improve pulmonary morbidity in patients who suffer blunt chest trauma.   Objectives:  Primary: Determine if addition of a low-dose ketamine infusion decreases narcotic analgesic use (OME) in trauma patients with ≥ 3 rib fractures. Secondary: Determine if adjunctive low-dose ketamine infusion in trauma patients with ≥ 3 rib fractures results in: improved pain control, fewer pulmonary complications, and decreased hospital (or Intensive Care Unit, if applicable) length-of-stay. Study Design:  • Randomized controlled double-blinded trial: Patients will then be randomized into one of two study groups.  Both groups will receive a normal saline infusion for 48 hours of therapy. The treatment group will have ketamine added to their saline infusion via blinded pharmacy protocol to receive continuous infusion of ketamine at 0.1mg/kg/hour. The control group will receive only normal saline. Administration will occur via piggyback infusion in accordance with nursing policy. Setting/Participants: • North Memorial Health Hospital: patients on 5S – TNICU and 6W – Trauma Floor • 50 people will take part in this study.  25 study subjects will receive an infusion of ketamine and 25 will receive a saline infusion.   • Patients 18 years of age or older with 3 or more rib fractures admitted to North Memorial Health Hospital will be considered for the study. Study Interventions and Measures:  
    
Ketamine for Rib Fractures Study  Protocol Version Date: 13 January 2021 iv • Ketamine low-dose infusion administered at 0.1 mg/kg/hr for 48 hours as an adjunct to standardized rib fracture management interventions as outlined in facility-approved Guidelines for Rib Fracture Management (see Appendix A) • The primary study outcome will be amount of narcotic used over the 48 hour study period (expressed as morphine equivalents).   • Secondary outcome measures will include: need for endotracheal intubation or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, oxygen requirements, daily incentive spirometer values, daily forced vital capacity measurements, and subjective patient pain ratings.   • Other outcomes measured will be Intensive Care Unit stay, total hospital length of stay, and adverse medication effects. 1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RATIONALE Thoracic trauma creates a significant burden of morbidity and mortality in those suffering blunt traumatic injuries.  Thoracic injuries are found in approximately 60% of multiply injured patients1.  In all demographics with blunt chest trauma, pulmonary complications occur in over a third of cases with a pneumonia rate up to 30%2.  Thoracic injury is responsible for 25% of blunt trauma mortalities1,3.  In patients over 65 years old, morbidity and mortality rates are much higher2.  Optimal contemporary management of blunt thoracic injury includes IV narcotics, epidural analgesia, and both noninvasive and invasive positive pressure ventilation for those patients that progress to respiratory failure2,3.  Multi-modal pain control therapies are considered standard of care for these patients4.  However, certain modalities such as use of opioids are well known to have unwanted side effects. Use of epidural catheters, although conditionally recommended as a beneficial treatment, is not always available and may be contraindicated in certain patients4. A single randomized controlled study has been published, in 2019 by the Division of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery at the Medical College of Wisconsin, evaluating the effects of low-dose ketamine infusion on pain, opioid use, pulmonary complications, and epidural use in adult and elderly patients with 3 or more rib fractures. Their results demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in oral morphine equivalent (OME) use in patients with injury severity scores of greater than 158,9. These findings were encouraging but warrant additional study. Low dose ketamine infusion has additionally been examined in multiple studies as a therapeutic adjunct for postoperative analgesia5-7.  In a recent meta-analysis, low dose ketamine infusion for up to 48 hours postoperatively significantly reduced pain scores and decreased opioid consumption by 40% with no major complications6.  In patients undergoing thoracotomy or sternotomy, a randomized study demonstrated 50% lower 
    
Ketamine for Rib Fractures Study  Protocol Version Date: 13 January 2021 v morphine consumption with no major side-effects in those started on a low dose ketamine infusion in addition to a morphine PCA7.   Adequate pain control remains a crucial element in management of blunt thoracic trauma.  By providing effective analgesia, the provider may successfully limit the increased morbidity and mortality inherent in the progression to respiratory failure2.  The postoperative literature, including a study specific to chest surgery, demonstrates a clear effect in improving analgesia and decreasing narcotic usage with no major complications5-7.  We hypothesize that low dose ketamine infusion will improve pain control, decrease narcotic use, and improve pulmonary morbidity in patients who suffer blunt chest trauma.   This study will be conducted in full accordance with all applicable North Memorial Medical Center Research Policies and Procedures and all applicable Federal and state laws and regulations. All episodes of noncompliance will be documented. The investigators will perform the study in accordance with this protocol, will obtain consent and assent, and will report unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others in accordance with North Memorial Health Hospital IRB Policies and Procedures and all federal requirements. Collection, recording, and reporting of data will be accurate and will ensure the privacy, health, and welfare of research subjects during and after the study.  2 STUDY OBJECTIVES The purpose of the study is to determine if adjunctive low-dose ketamine infusion enhances pain control and decreases respiratory complications in adult patients with 3 or more rib fractures. 2.1 Primary Objective Primary: Determine if adjunctive low-dose ketamine infusion results in decreased narcotic usage. 2.2 Secondary Objectives  The secondary objectives are to: • Determine if low-dose ketamine infusion as an analgesic adjunct leads to improved pain control as measured by subjective patient pain ratings  • Determine if low-dose ketamine infusion as an analgesic adjunct leads to decreased pulmonary complications as evidenced by decreased rates of respiratory infections, decreased rates of intubation or use of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, and/or stable to improving pulmonary function testing • Determine if low-dose ketamine infusion as an analgesic adjunct leads to decreased Intensive Care Unit (as applicable) and/or hospital length of stay  
    
Ketamine for Rib Fractures Study  Protocol Version Date: 13 January 2021 vi 3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 3.1 Study Design The study will be conducted as a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study comparing saline infusion with low-dose ketamine, versus saline infusion alone. 3.2 Study Phases 3.2.1 Screening Phase Patients will be identified based on initial Emergency Room documentation, initial imaging studies, and/or admission History and Physical, or initial Consultation by the Trauma Services Provider. Prospective study participants will be selected based on the inclusion/ exclusion criteria below. They will be approached after admission regarding study participation via a face to face contact. Final screening and consent will be conducted by trained personnel from the Trauma Services department. Informed consent will be obtained prior to conducting any study-related activities beyond the typical medical care for the patient’s condition.   3.2.2 Treatment Phase The treatment phase will be initiated as soon as the subject has been identified as meeting inclusion criteria and consented to participate. Pharmacy will be notified of inclusion in the study and the infusion bag prepared based on a pre-determined randomization protocol (see Appendix B, Sample Randomization Schedule). The medication, either normal saline or normal saline with low-dose ketamine, will be administered by the Registered Nurse (RN) following nursing medication administration policy. Nursing staff will reorder infusion bags from the Pharmacy per medication policy as needed. The infusion will be discontinued at the end of the 48 hour period. 3.3 Allocation to Treatment Groups and Blinding Study drug will be ordered within EPIC by selecting “Rib Fracture Study Drug”. The research pharmacist will obtain information about the patient (Name, MR#, and weight) and will then consult the Randomization Schedule to determine whether the 100 mL Saline Infusion Bag will receive 100 mg of ketamine (Ketamine Infusion Subject) or no added medication (Saline Infusion Subject). The Study Drug Bag will be released with a label that includes: Name of Study, Study Subject #, Patient Name, Pt MR#, Pt DOB, and INFUSION RATE. (Note: infusion rate is 0.1 mg/kg/hr and concentration of standard ketamine infusion bag is 1 mg/mL. That is, 100 mg of ketamine added to 100 mL saline). Bags will be labeled as Study Drug (using consecutive numbers, between 1-50, that correspond to the randomization envelope), but the patient, nurses, physicians, and all others caring for the patient will be blind with respect to the contents of the infusion bag. Pharmacy personnel would be the only individuals with knowledge of the infusion bags and would not 
    
Ketamine for Rib Fractures Study  Protocol Version Date: 13 January 2021 vii communicate with caregivers once the medications leave the pharmacy. See unblinding section below for further detail. 3.4 Study Duration, Enrollment 3.4.1 Duration of Study Participation Study subjects will receive the ketamine versus normal saline infusion for 48 hours after identification and enrollment. Information from their entire hospital course will be evaluated as related to the objectives as discussed above. Recruitment will stop when 50 subjects are successfully enrolled.   3.5 Study Population 3.5.1 Inclusion Criteria 1) Males or females 18 years of age or older 2) Diagnosis of 3 or more acute rib fractures related to blunt traumatic chest injury. 3) Able to undergo consent procedure and give valid consent, or availability of family member to provide consent for the study 3.5.2 Exclusion Criteria 1) Age <18 years 2) Cognitively impaired 3) Pregnant or lactating females.  4) Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of ≤ 14 at time of admission 5) Evidence of increased intraocular pressure 6) Presence of acute coronary syndrome 7) Diagnosed moderate to severe traumatic brain injury   8) Evidence of uncontrolled intracranial hypertension 9) History of seizures or stroke 10) History of severe psychiatric disorders 11) Allergy to ketamine 12) Currently being treated, prior to admission, with opiate agonist/antagonist therapy 
    
Ketamine for Rib Fractures Study  Protocol Version Date: 13 January 2021 viii 13) Presence of poorly controlled hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and/or tachycardia on admission 14) Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, may be inappropriate for study participation. Subjects that do not meet all of the enrollment criteria may not be enrolled. Any violations of these criteria must be reported in accordance with IRB Policies and Procedures.  3.6 Subject Completion/Withdrawal Study participation is considered completed when they have received the 48 hours of medication infusion. Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to their care.  They may also be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the investigator and/or attending provider for lack of adherence to study treatment, adverse events, or due to other circumstances in which patient treatment may be impeded by continuation of the study treatment. The providers caring for patients enrolled in the study may withdraw subjects from the study if they have concerns about possible administration of ketamine. Caregivers should make clinical decisions based on the idea that patients are receiving ketamine, since the randomization code will not be broken.    3.7 Safety Evaluation Subject safety will be monitored for adverse events as outlined by the Ketamine, Low Dose for Analgesia, Adult Order Set. This includes monitoring heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate 15 minutes after starting infusion and every 4 hours thereafter while receiving infusion. The ordering provider will be notified if systolic blood pressure is less than 90 or greater than 180, if heart rate is less than 60 or greater than 120, or if the respiratory rate is less than 10 during infusion. Mental status will also be monitored during normal nurse rounding and the ordering provider notified if sedation, hallucinations, cognitive changes, dysphonia, anxiousness, and/or restlessness are observed. 4 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS A power analysis was used to inform the investigators about appropriate sample size. Numerous studies of ketamine infusion for post-op analgesia suggest that the morphine equivalent opiate use is decreased from 17% to 46% (average decrease 34.1%, Pain Medicine 2014;383-403). Assuming a mean baseline narcotic use of 32+10 mg statistical power (alpha = 0.05, 2-tailed test) to detect a 15% decrease in narcotic use is 92.4%. Assuming a similar baseline opioid use there would be an 80.7% chance of observing a 12.5% in morphine equivalents with a 1-tailed analysis. Therefore, the investigators feel confident that the likelihood of a Type II error would be minimal with the proposed sample size of 50.  
    
Ketamine for Rib Fractures Study  Protocol Version Date: 13 January 2021 ix Total narcotic analgesics administered during the 48 hour study period will be abstracted from the electronic medical record and converted to morphine equivalents (with aid of pharmacy or morphine equivalent calculator, for example: http://www.agencymeddirectors.wa.gov/calculator/dosecalculator.htm). Mean + standard deviation morphine equivalents for ketamine and placebo groups will be compared. Descriptive categorical and continuous characteristics of each cohort will be tabulated and compared. Categorical variables (including, gender, age > 55, use of epidural catheter, operative fracture stabilization, and disposition) will be analyzed using Chi-square tests. Continuous variables will be compared using ANOVA, multiple linear regression, or t-tests as appropriate. Continuous variables to be abstracted, tabulated, and compared including: age, ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay, number of fractured ribs, Injury Severity Score (ISS), negative inspiratory force (NIF), and vital capacity (VC). 4.1 Efficacy Analysis The primary analysis will be based on an intention to treat basis (i.e., randomization to study arm and at least 1 hour of study drug infusion) and will include all subjects enrolled into the study. The primary endpoint will be the total dose of all narcotic analgesics (converted to morphine equivalents) received during the 48 hour period after the patient begins study drug infusion. (Note, for the purposes of the study initiation of study drug infusion starts the 48 hour window for narcotic use monitoring).  Secondary endpoints will include examination of hospital, and/or ICU, length of stay, pulmonary function studies (NIF and VC), subjective pain scores (visual analog pain scores from electronic medical record), and the incidence/number of adverse events (e.g., ICU readmission, pneumonia, bronchoscopy, etc.).   4.2 Safety Analysis No specific safety analysis is planned, because ketamine is an approved medication for adjunctive treatment of post-operative and other types of surgical pain. All subjects will be monitored for any adverse events per the usual care parameters. Such events are noted by caregivers, care adapted appropriately if concern related to study drug, and findings and interventions documented in the electronic health record.  4.3 Interim Analysis No interim analysis is planned for this study. All subjects will receive care based on the existing standard of care, as outlined in the Rib Fracture Management Guideline (Appendix A). While it is conceivable that as few as 20 randomized subjects might be sufficient to show statistically significantly decreased opioid analgesic use (Primary Endpoint), it is anticipated that the full cohort of 50 randomized subjects would be desirable to examine the important secondary endpoints relating to resource utilization (hospital and ICU LOS), as well as to better understand the how ketamine improved care. Discontinuation of the study would be considered if greater than 33% of participants suffer adverse events felt to be related to the study drug. 
    
Ketamine for Rib Fractures Study  Protocol Version Date: 13 January 2021 x 5 SAFETY MANAGEMENT 5.1 Clinical Adverse Events Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study and recorded as a secondary study outcome. If concern for adverse events related to study medication administration, providers will manage as if receiving low-dose ketamine infusion. Discontinuation of study drug will be at provider discretion. 5.2 Adverse Event Reporting Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, SAEs are not expected. If any unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others happen during the course of this study (including SAEs) they will be reported to the IRB in accordance with NMHH guidelines. AEs that are not serious but that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will be summarized in narrative or other format and submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing review.  Jouguelet-Lacoste et al. (2015) reviewed five meta-analyses and 39 clinical trials from 1996 to 2013 in which over 1400 patients received low-dose IV ketamine for pain control. No major complications, related to ketamine administration, were reported in this analysis6.  STUDY ADMINISTRATION 5.3 Treatment Assignment Methods 5.3.1 Randomization A randomization schedule (see Appendix B for sample) will be created using Microsoft Excel. The sample randomization schedule includes fictitious names and MR#s. Note: once the schedule is created. In a final document Column C would be hidden and probably Columns A-D would be “locked” (Protected), so that they could not be modified (values in Column D would change, but the formula to create those values could not be changed in a Protected document).  The randomization schedule will be generated (with appropriate instructions) in the pharmacy, who will also be responsible for maintaining and protecting the list, as subjects are enrolled. Neither the PI, Co-investigators, physicians, nurses, or others caring for the patient will be aware of whether or not a given patient is receiving ketamine or placebo infusion.  Once a patient agrees to participate in the study, a licensed physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant will enter an order for Rib Fracture Study Drug in the EPIC electronic record. That caregiver is responsible for insuring that the subject has consented to participate in the study and that a signed consent form resides in the subject’s medical record. Prior to commencing infusion of the any study drug, the nursing staff will also confirm that a signed consent for the subject is present in the patient’s medical record.  
    
Ketamine for Rib Fractures Study  Protocol Version Date: 13 January 2021 xi 5.3.2 Blinding During the duration of the study, the pharmacy personnel will be the only individuals who will have knowledge of study drug assignment. At the completion of the study (enrollment of 50 subjects) this information will be turned over to the study investigators. Under no circumstances should be drug allocation be released to any individuals prior to completion of the study.  5.3.3 Unblinding Since ketamine is an approved medication, this is no specific reason for any caregiver to reasonably request that an individual’s study drug allocation be unblinded. However, it is entirely reasonable that any and all caregivers should consider that all patients enrolled in the study are receiving ketamine and to use that information to make clinical decisions. If a caregiver is concerned that any aspect of a patient’s condition, responses to treatment, etc. might be adversely impacted by possible administration of ketamine, then that clinician may discontinue the study drug at any time.  5.4 Data Collection and Management Data will be extracted from patient records as contained in EPIC electronic health record.  5.5 Confidentiality All data and records generated during this study will be kept confidential in accordance with Institutional policies and HIPAA on subject privacy. The Investigator and other site personnel will not use such data and records for any purpose other than conducting the study.  5.5.1 Risk Assessment Risks are not greater than minimal as discussed above in Section 5.2. Patients will be monitored as previously discussed in Section 3.7 according to Ketamine, Low Dose for Analgesia, Adult Order Set which is an approved NMHH Hospital Order Set. The medication being studied is already approved for use as a pain medication adjunct at NMHH. 5.5.2 Potential Benefits of Trial Participation Potential benefits of trial participation include the benefit to society as related to potentially convincing study results which may sway clinical practice in a manner that brings clinical benefit to those suffering from multiple rib fractures. Additionally, trial participants included in the experimental group may benefit from improved pain control related to the drug therapy. 5.5.3 Risk-Benefit Assessment The risk of participation is related to the possible lack of ketamine infusion, in those that could benefit from its use, in the control group. There is also a very low risk of adverse 
    
Ketamine for Rib Fractures Study  Protocol Version Date: 13 January 2021 xii reaction to those receiving the medication in the experimental group. The benefit is enhanced pain relief those receiving the medication.

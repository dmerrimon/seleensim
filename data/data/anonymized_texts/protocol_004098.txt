 1.0 Background  
Airway management is a critical component of anesthesia care.  Failure to 
provide adequate ventilation and oxygenation can lead to death or 
permanent neurologic disability.  Tracheal intubation provides a secure 
airway that is mandatory for many surgical p rocedures.   Intubation of the 
trachea requires some type of instrument that permits visualization of the 
glottic inlet during insertion of the tracheal tube through the larynx and into 
the trachea.   For many decades, the standard laryngoscope has consisted  of a 
handle and a folding blade.   The blade may be straight or curved.  The 
purpose of the blade is to displace the tongue and sublingual tissue into the 
sub-mandibular space to provide the anesthesiologist with direct line -of-
sight to the laryngeal inle t.  Since the blade exerts pressure and displaces 
tissue, there is some risk of injury to the oral cavity and pharynx .  Difficulty 
with conventional lary ngoscopy can be as high as 13 percent.1   Advances in 
imaging technology promoted the design of new lar yngoscopes that provide 
an image of the larynx with indirect line -of-sight.  The essence of these 
devices is a CCD chip or “miniature camera” that is placed at the tip of the 
laryngoscope.  The image is transmitted to a screen for the anesthesiologist 
to observe.  These laryngoscopes have been termed video  laryngoscopes.   
Video  laryngoscopes reduce pressure on the soft tissue of the upper airway 
and provide a high -resolution, wide angle view of the upper airway and 
larynx.   Video  laryngos copes, consequently , decrease the risk of upper airway 
trauma and improve the ease of tracheal intubation.   The first video  
 
Confidential  Rev3.28.16   4 
 laryngoscope introduced into clinical practice was the Glides cope ( Verathon 
Medical, 2003).2   Since the introduction of video  laryngoscopes most 
anesthesia departments  and critical care departments , including ours, have 
had a steady increase in the use of video  laryngoscopes  in place of 
conventional laryngoscopes.3,4,5   Many anesthesiologists now use video  
laryngoscopes as their standard laryngosc ope.  Video  laryngoscopy is also  
included in current guidelines for  difficult tracheal intubation.6   Other video  
laryngoscopes in clinical use throughout the world include the CMAC ( Kart 
Storz  Imaging ), Tru -View  (Truphatek ), McGrath  (Covidien) , Pentax AWS  
(Pentax) , and the King Vision  (Ambu) .  Some of these devices have pediatric 
sized blades and some do not.  
     Processing,  portability, and cost are important aspects  of video  
laryngoscope selection.  Some devices have patient contact components that 
are disposable, while other devices are reusable and require processing for 
sterilization or high -grade disinfection.   Patient cross -contamination with 
potentially infectious material is an increasing concer n with reusable airway 
devices.7   Cost is always a c oncern.  Some video  laryngoscopes require a 
separate stand and monitor, and reusable blades.   The initial capital outlay 
for such reusable devices can be as high as $35,000.   The initial financial 
outlay for the King Vision is $1500.  
     The King Vision v ideo  laryngoscope was introduced  into clinical practice 
in 2011.  The King Vision video laryngoscope is an FDA Device Class CCW 
instrument that is 510(K) exempt: regulation number 868.5540.  This device 
 
Confidential  Rev3.28.16   5 
 consists of a reusable, imaging  wand that is inserted into a disposable blade 
(size 3).  Published reports have documented the value of the King Vision 
video  laryngoscope  in older children and adults. 8,9   The size 3 blade is 
suitable for intubation of adults and children as young as 8  years.    Ambu 
now m akes  size 1 and 2 blades suitable for intubation of infants and young 
children.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of the 
King Vision v ideo  laryngoscope in younger patients.   Advantages of the King 
Vision scope in clude  a very high success rate of first pass intubation,  
relatively low cost ($11 per intubation) and extreme portability.  
 
2.0 Rationale and Specific Aims  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance char acteristics of 
the King Vision v ideo  laryng oscope in pediatric patients between the ages of 
one month and 10 years of age.  If the performance is satisfactory, this device 
may become a standard laryngoscope for tracheal intubation in elective and 
emergent tracheal intubations.  
3.0 Inclusion/Exclusion C riteria  
Inclusion:  
1. All children between the ages of 1 month to  10 years with a normal 
preoperative airway examination  
2. Scheduled for a surgical procedure that requires tracheal intubation shall 
be included.    
 
 
Confidential  Rev3.28.16   6 
 Exclusion : 
1. Patients that will be excluded are  those with an airway examination or 
previous anesthesia history that suggests difficulty with mask ventilation.  
4.0 Enrollment/Randomization  
100 patients will be enrolled.  Data will be collected from the patients that 
the King Vision Video Laryngoscope is us ed.  As this is not a comparative 
study, there shall be no randomization.  
5.0 Study Procedures  
All procedures shall be routine procedures for the administration of 
anesthesia appropriate for the age of the child and the type of surgical 
procedure.  This is a data collection only study .  
1. The technique of anesthesia induction will be determined  for each patient  
by the  anesthesiologist of record.  
2. After the induction of anesthesia , and when the patient is at an adequa te 
depth of anesthesia , tracheal in tubation will be performed  with the King 
Vision video laryngoscope  by one of the investigators.   
3. Data recorded will include gender, age, and weight of the patient.   
4. Data specific to the device and tracheal intubation include; size and type 
of blade (stand ard vs. channeled), blade tip position, Cormack -Lehane 
score, tracheal tube size, and a subjective scoring of tracheal tube 
delivery.  
5. See the attached data collection sheet.

 6.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems   
Involving Risk to Participants or Others  
We do not anticipate adverse events related to this study.  This is a data 
collections only study therefore there are minimal to no risks to the subjects.  
There is a minimal risk of loss of confidentiality. PHI will be accessed for  
recruitment purposes by the clinical care team and/or research care team.  
All data shared with the sponsor will be  unidentifiable.  
Any reports of adverse events can be made to:  
Nicole Horn , M.D. @ Office number: 317 -944 -9835 or Pager: 317 -312 -2570 
7.0 Stati stical Considerations  
As this is not a comparative study, only descriptive statistics will be applied.  
8.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issue  
Data will be kept secure in a password protected database and all paper 
documentation will be kept in a secure office  of th e Anesthesia department.  
10.0 Follow -up and Record Retention  
There will not be a follow up period for this study.  Records will be kept until 
all data analysis is complete and the study has been completed.

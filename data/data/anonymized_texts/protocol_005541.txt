Project  Goal : The goal  of the project  is to conduct  a pilot  study  to determine  the feasibility  of delivering  a MBSR  plus  
sleep  education intervention  to improve  sleep  and subsequently improve  subclinical  biomarkers  for T2DM  risk among  a 
community  sample  of racially  diverse  adults  (N=20)  with  poor  sleep  quality  and pre -diabetes.   
 
Rationale : T2DM is a growing problem that currently affects more than 30 m illion Americans,1 thereby highlighting the 
need for novel and innovative interventions to reduce T2DM risk. The pathogenesis of T2DM is complex and involves 
both impairments in pancreatic insulin secretion as well as reductions in insulin sensitivity.18 Evidence suggests that both 
the processes of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity are influenced by sleep. Early experimental sleep restriction 
studies noted marked alterations in insulin secretion and glucose uptake after a sleep duration of only four hours, 
indicating decreased glucose tolerance during sleep loss.19 Furthermore, the disposition index which is a product of acute 
insulin response to glucose and insulin sensitivity, was decreased by 37% in a state of sleep deprivation compared to a 
fully rested state,19 thereby indicating that T2DM related metabolic perturbations can occur due to shortened sleep 
duration.     
Inadequate sleep (e.g. short sleep duration, poor sleep quality, sleep disturbances) is a public health burden. One -third of 
US adults ar e not consistently getting adequate sleep.20 In recent years, an increasing number of studies have reported an 
association between sleep duration and T2DM risk. A study following men without T2DM at baseline for 16 years noted that men reporting a sleep duration of 6 hours of sleep per night were twice as likely to develop T2DM compared to those 
who achieved 7 hours.
20  Similarly, a meta -analysis assessing the relationship between sleep and T2DM incidence found 
that those with a sleep duration of 5- 6 hours per night were 1.3 tim es more likely to develop incident T2DM compared to 
those who slept on average 8 hours per night.21  
While the evidence linking sleep loss to T2DM risk is mounting, t raditional T2DM prevention trials have focused 
primarily on weight loss through diet and physical activity interventions.4–7 In the Diabetes Prevention Program 
randomized clinical trial, T2DM incidence was reduced by 58% with intensive lifestyle modification after 3 years. 
However, after 10 years of follow -up the decrease in diabetes incidence was attenuated to 34% between the lifestyle 
intervention group and the placebo group,22 thereby indicating declines in e fficacy over time. Furthermore, attempts to 
translate weight loss focused T2DM prevention trials into real world settings have proven modest at best, in part because of the difficulty in sustaining weight loss over time.
8 Given the challenging nature of translating weight loss based 
interventions, a s well as the association between shortened sleep and T2DM incidence, the translation of interventions to 
improve sleep present a novel method to reduce T2DM risk.  
Racial minorities are disproportionately affected by both inadequate sleep as well as T2DM.12,13,21,23 Data from the Multi -
Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis showed that black, Hispanic and Asian participants had a higher prevalence of short sl eep 
compared to non- Hispanic whites.13 Similar disparities are observed for T2DM.12 Data from the National Health Interview 
Survey indic ate that although suboptimal sleep duration (short and long) were associated with T2DM in black and white 
adults, the prevalence of T2DM was higher at any level of sleep in blacks.24 These results underscore the importance of 
intervening on sleep to reduce T2DM risk, particularly among racial minorities. Although there is a lack of data among racial minorities, studies among general populations have shown that intervening on sleep can improve insuli n sensitivity. 
In fact, a study among a healthy population found that extending sleep was correlated with improvements in insulin levels 
(r = −0.60, P = 0.025), and insulin sensitivity (r = +0.76, P = 0.002).25 More evidence is needed to confirm whether sleep 
improvement impacts subclinical biomarkers for T2DM .

 Psychosocial stressors remain a contributing factor to inadequate sleep,26–29 and intervening on stress may result in sleep 
improvements. Mindfulness -based stress reduction (MBSR) is a evidenced- based intervention that focuses on mindfulness 
mediation, breathing, and other relaxing methods to reduce negative affect and improve vitality and coping. 30,31 MBSR is 
effective at reducing stress levels, rum inative thinking, and anxiety,32 all contributors to poor sleep.33 Results of a systematic 
review indicate that increased practice of mindfulness techniques is associated with improved sleep.17 However more 
research is needed, particularly regarding the uptake of home practice.34 Furthermore, evidence regarding the uptake of 
MBSR among populations most -at-risk for inadequate sleep and T2DM is lacking.    
 
Hypothesis  and Desi gn: Our overarching hypothesis is  that the MBSR intervention  will improve sleep  quality,  extend  
sleep  duration and improve general sleep  complaints  and that that participants who  complete the MBSR plus sleep  
education intervention  will have improvements in  glucose levels,  lipid levels,  blood  pressure,  and biomarkers associated  
with stress  response.  
 
 
Project  Design:  Population : The  target  population is  a racially  diverse  community  sample of adults aged  18 years or older  
who reside  in the Atlanta,  GA area (N=20).  Eligible  participants  will be proficient  in English language, have  a iPhone (for  
the purposes  of the application), a sleep  quality score  >5 on the  validated  Pittsburgh  Sleep  Quality  Index35 and 
prediabetes.  We will initially  screen  for high risk  of prediabetes  using the American  Diabetes  Association  risk screener.36 
Those who  are identified  as high risk will be confirmed  via venous blood test.   Prediabetes  will be defined  as either  
fasting  glucose between  100-125 mg/dL  or HbA1c  between  5.7-6.4%.37 Participants  will be recruited  from  the community  
via advertisements,  community  events and existing  community  partn erships.  Potential participants  will be screened  by 
trained  research  assistants.  Eligible  participants  will be contacted  via phone and  scheduled to  attend  a baseline  visit to 
collect  a blood sample  and attend  a sleep  education session  (see Aim  1). Co-PI, Dr. Johnson has  an extensive experience 
recruiting  from  the community  and will  lead  the recruitment  strategies.     
Overview: We aim  to determine the  feasibility  of delivering  a MBSR plus  sleep  education intervention  to participants  
with prediabetes  and poor sleep  quality. The  primary  outcome  is to improve sleep  quality and duration, and secondarily 
improve subclinical  biomarkers of T2DM  risk such  as glucose,  HbA1c , blood pressure,  and lipids.  For Aim  1: we  propose 
to deliver  sleep  education in  a group settin g, install  MBSR  app on the  phones of participants,  and monitor  sleep  patterns  
using wrist  actigraphy for 7 weeks.  For Aim  2, we  will conduct focus groups among  participants to  determine  usability  of 
the app  as well  as barriers  to obtaining optimal sleep.  For Aim  3, we  will analyze  the biomarkers  collected  at baseline and 
follow-up and explore associations between  stress,  sleep  and T2DM  biomarkers.  Participants  of the proposed  research  will 
receive appropriate incentives (up  to $265).  
 
Determine the  feasibility  of 
delivering  a mindfulness  
based  stress  reduction plus  
sleep  education 
intervention to improve 
sleep  health:   We  propose to 
conduct a 6- week  MBSR 
intervention (See Figure  1). 
Eligible  participants  will be 
invited to a baseline visit at 
the Emo ry University  
Hospital branch of  the 
Atlanta  Clinical and  
Translational Science 
Institute  where  there  will be 
a blood draw,  
anthropometry, 
questionnaires (e.g.  stress,  
sleep,  diet,  exercise,  medical  

Version  2/10/202 1 MINDS  Study                                              Page  3 of 9  
 
 history,  medications)  and a sleep  education session.  Participants  will receive a 1-hour session  on sleep  hygiene, 
highlighting the  important  components  of healthy sleep:  limiting  naps, avoiding  stimulants  close to  bedtime,  exercise,  
establishing  a bedtime  routine, and optimal  sleep  environment  (e.g. bedroom). Dr . Johnson, Co -PI will deliver  the sleep  
hygiene. At  the end of  the session,  participants  will be asked  to download the  free headspace app 
(https://www.headspace.com/headspace -meditation -app). This  app was selected  based  on the following  available 
features:  themed  modules, varying meditation  techniques,  narrator  selection,  mindful  moments,  reminders,  and journey 
tracking  (i.e., run streaks,  time  meditated,  sessions  completed)  The app features guided meditations  on “Stress  and 
Anxiety”  that includes  3 “Basic” courses of  10 sessions each  which  teach  the fundamentals  of meditation  and 
mindfulness; 6 themed  courses of  10 sessions  each  such  as “managing anxiety”  which  helps  transform  anxious  thoughts, 
“letting  go of stress” which  focuses on  reframing  negati ve emotions,  “restlessness”  which  aids in coping with  a restless  
mind,  “transforming  anger”  which  emphasizes  connecting with  our anger  and using  it to train our minds, “navigating 
change”  which  focuses on being comfortable  with  change, and  “reframing  lonel iness” which  aids in feeling  more  
connected  to the world.  The “Stress and Anxiety”  module  also features 3 advice  sessions on  the usefulness  of putting 
down our  phones, how  to forgive  ourselves,  and the concept  of loneliness.  The module  additionally  feature s 6 SOS  
meditation  sessions for  panic  attacks or anxiety,  and 8 additional  single  meditation  sessions for  unwinding, restoration, 
stress,  frustration, breaks, resetting,  fear of flying,  and alone  time . Participants  will undergo short  mindfulness  exercises  
daily  via the app for 6 weeks.   To optimize  resources,  we will implement the  intervention in 4 groups  of 5 individuals. 
Additionally, conducting the intervention  in waves  will allow  us to make  adjustments  based  on participant  feedback. 
Following each  wave,  there will  be a focus  group session  and blood draw  to assess  changes in biomarkers  from  baseline.   
One week  prior  to the baseline  visit,  participants will  receive a  sleep  monitor,  which  will objectively  assess sleep  patterns  
over a 7-week  duration.  A trained research  assistant  will instruct p articipants on wearing  the sleep  monitor  (Spectrum,  
Philips  Respironics,  Murrysville,  PA) on their non-dominant  wrist  for the next 7-weeks,  and concurrently  complete  a brief  
log. Dr.  Johnson, Co -PI, currently  uses  this device and has experience in the collection  and analysis  of the data.39 The key 
sleep  outcomes  are average  nightly  sleep  duration,  sleep  timing  (mid -point, bed  and wake  times),  sleep  efficiency  (sleep  
quality), wake  after  sleep  onset,  and night  to night  variability  in sleep duration and timing  (standard  deviation).  The 
actigraphy data  will be complemented  by validated  sleep  questionnaires. Participants  will receive feedback  reports  and 
information  for clinical  evaluations,  if interested.    
Feasibility : Our main  goals  are to collect  process  measures  that address the feasibility  of the mindfulness  intervention and  
identify  components  (‘ingredients”)  that are  most  effective or  have  best uptake. We will quantify:  recruitment  yields, 
drop- out rates,  adherence with  app, returne d actigraphs  (sleep  monitors), participant  satisfaction  via questionnaire  and exit 
interviews,  and ability  to implement  the intervention.  We will  describe the proportion of missing  data.  For measurements 
with more  than  10%  missingness,  we will interview  staff and participants  to identify  reasons  (e.g., clarity,  burden, etc.).  
 
Conduct  qualitative  research  to understand  the uptake  and usability  of the mindfulness -based stress  reduction  
intervention  for sleep  improvement  
Qualitative  data  collection  will be conducted via a series of  focus  groups  in order  to understand  the uptake  and usability  of 
the mindfulness  intervention for  sleep  improvement.  Focus  group discussions  will be  stratified  by gender  to facilitate  
discussion  and provide  characteristics  for analytic  comparison. We will  conduct  four  focus  group discussions  (2 with  men 
and 2 with  women).  Each  group will consist  of 6-8 participants,  and will comprise  diversity by  race/ethnicity.  Focus  group 
discussions  will be held at a location that is convenient  to the participants such  as a private  conference room  in the clinic  
or a meeting  room  at Emory  University.  
Focus  group discussions  will include  the following  key areas.  
1) Perceived usability of the headspace application: t opics will include ease of use of the application, barriers to use, and 
thoughts about how the application can be improved to increase mindfulness or usability.  
2) Attitudes and beliefs towards sleep; understanding of the importance of healthy sleep practices/sleep hygiene, and 
barriers to following standard sleep health recommendations. We will also assess the impact of sleep -related impairments 
on following healthy lifestyle recommendations.  
3) Facilitators and barriers (including a discussion on stress) to he althy lifestyle practices.

 Data Analysis: Focus group discussions will be conducted in English by a trained moderator -note taker team. The team 
will be designed to match the focus group participant characteristics as closely as possible. This is important  to achieve 
group homogeneity and foster open discussions among participants.40 All focus group discussions will be audio- recorded 
and transcribed. Focus group recordings will be de -identified prior to analysis and transcribed verbatim. The MAXDA 
software will be used for analysis. Employing a thematic analysis, data will be coded separately by two individual coders. 
Codes will be compared between coders for validation, and key themes will be identified from the textual data. Structured 
comparisons between genders will be used to identify relevant issues.  
 
Assess whether improving sleep  through mindfulness -based stress reduction improves subclinical biomarkers 
associated with T2DM risk   
Anthropometric measures will be assessed by trained staff, and fasting blood samples will be drawn by a trained 
phlebotomist. Height, weight, and waist c ircumference will be obtained according to standard procedures. After at least an 
8-hour overnight fast, 100 mL of fasting blood will be drawn from a peripheral vein to measure fasting glucos e, HbA1c , 
C-reactive protein  and lipids. Blood samples will be pr ocessed and stored at - 80 degrees C. Three seated blood pressure 
measurements will be made using an electronic sphygmomanometer. An average of the last two readings will be used to assess systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Smoking and alcohol use will be assessed via self -reported questionnaire. All 
measures will take place at the Emory University Hospital branch of the Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute , and will be conducted at baseline as well as follow up . Participants will receive a $100 gift card at baseline and a 
$150 gift card at follow -up, as well as a detailed health report for their participation at the end of the study.   
Data Analysis : Outcome variables will be the mean change in HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fastin g glucose, HbA1c, 
high blood pressure, and C -Reactive Protein . The means of each measure will be compared at baseline and follow up 
using analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests to assess whether significant changes occurred between pre and post intervention. D r. Gujral (Co -PI) has extensive experience in the analysis of biomarkers related to T2DM risk and will 
conduct all related analyses.   
In secondary analyses, we will test cross- sectional associations between sleep measures and subclinical biomarkers for 
T2DM risk, regardless of intervention adherence. The primary exposures will be average actigraphy defined sleep 
duration and sleep quality. Secondary sleep outcomes include: night to night standard deviation in sleep duration; sleep 
efficiency, sleep mid- point (timing; average and standard deviation of night to night differences); sleep debt (weekend-
weekday sleep duration), and self -reported quality and daytime functioning (using the PROMIS scale). Sub- clinical 
outcomes will include mean changes in fasting glucos e, HbA1c , C-reactive protein, and lipids.

FUTURE  PLANS  
  
This pilot  grant  will serve as  preliminary  data  for an NIH  R-level  application for  translational  research  funding. For  
example, the  National  Institute  of Diabetes and  Digestive  Kidney  Diseases has  an R01 entitled  “Translational  Research  to 
Improve  Diabetes and  Obesity  Outcomes.”  The proposed study will  generate  the information  knowledge  necessary  to 
apply for such  a funding mechanism.  In particular,  the results of  the proposed  study  will help  us to determine  the needed  
sample size for  the larger  study. We  will also gain critical  feedback  regarding  the uptake  of an app-based  intervention.  
The future  study will  incorporate  the focus -group data  to develop  a culturally  relevant  stress reduction  intervention, thus 
allowing us  to explore  racial/ethnic  disparities with  the aim of reducing  the inequity  in diabetes.   
 
PROJECT  AS RELATED  TO T2DM  TRANSLATION  RESEARCH  
An area  of translational  research  includes  the process of applying  discoveries generated  during laboratory  research  or in 
preclinical studies  to the development  of interventions  in target  populations.   Laboratory  studies  have  shown that sleep  
deprivation  can alter insulin  secretion  and resistance,  and sleep  interventions  have  been  shown to improve  subclinical  
markers  of diabetes  risk.  However, these  studies  have  been  conducted in predominantly  white  populations  in controlled 
settings.  The aim of this study  is to translate  these findings  into a mindfulness -based  stress reduction intervention  to 
improve  sleep  and subsequently improve  subclinical  markers  for diabetes  risk in a diverse  sample  of adults  living  in the 
Atlanta  metro  area.   
 
COVID PRECAUTIONS  
 
In response to the unprecedented  COVID- 19 pandemic  and the  resulting  social  distancing guidelines,  the goals, design, 
and procedure  of this study have  changed for  the safety  of all involved.  
Project  Goal : The goal  of the project  is to conduct  a pilot  study  to determine  the feasibility  of delivering  a MBSR  plus  
sleep  education intervention  to improve  sleep  and subsequently improve  subclinical  biomarkers  for T2DM  risk among  a 
community  sample  of racially  diverse  adults  (N=20)  who are  overweight/obese  and experience  poor sleep  quality .   
Hypothesis  and Design:  Our overarching hypothesis  is that the MBSR intervention  will improve sleep  quality,  extend  
sleep  duration and  improve  general  sleep  complaints  and that participants  who  complete  the MBSR  plus  sleep  education  
intervention will  experience  improvements  in blood pressure  and weight.    
Project  Design:  Population : Eligible  participants will  be proficient  in the English  language, have  a iPhone  or Android  
(for the  purposes  of the application),  a sleep  quality score  >5 on the validated  Pittsburgh  Sleep  Quality  Index35 and 
overweight  or obese. Participants  will be  recruited  from  the community  via social  media  advertis ements  and flyer  
advertisements.  Via an online  questionnaire, we  will screen  for overweight  or obesity  defined  by the  CDC  as a BMI  of 
25.0 kg/m2  or greater41. Those  who  are identified  as overweight  or obese  will be contacted  and given  a blood pressure  
cuff and scale (RENPHO Digital Bathroom  Scale).  Consent  will be conducted electronically  for both  participation  in the 
intervention and  focus  group. Participants  will be instructed  on how  to use both  and record  their morning weight  and 
blood pressure reading  before  and after  the intervention.

 Overview : For Aim  1: we propose  to deliver  sleep  education in  a virtual group setting,  ask participants to  install MBSR 
app on their phones, and monitor  sleep  patterns  using wrist  actigraphy for  approximately  35 days.  The sleep  device  
(Actiwatch),  blood pressure  cuff,  and scales  will be delivered to participants  without  contact.  For Aim  2, we  will conduct  
focus  groups  among  participants  to determine  usability  of the app as well  as barriers  to obtaining optimal  sleep.  Focus  
groups  will be conducted over  the phone/secure  video  conferencing  (i.e. Zoom).  For Aim  3, we  will analyze changes  in 
weight  and blood  pressure collected  at the start of the study and at  follow -up and explore  associations between  stress,  
sleep  and T2DM  biomarkers.   
Determine the  feasibility  of delivering  a mindfulness  based  stress reduction plus  sleep  education intervention  to 
improve  sleep  health:  We propose  a 4-week  MBSR intervention  (See Figure  2.1). Questionnaires and sleep  hygiene  
education will  be provided over the phone/secure  video conferencing (i.e.  Zoom).  Eligible  participants  will be provided 
with a blood pressure  cuff, scale,  and Actiwatch.  Particip ants will also  be remotely  instructed  by a  trained  research  
assistant  on how  to wear  the sleep  monitor.  No physical  contact  will be made  with  participants over  the course of  the 
study.

1. OBJECTIVES  
 
The primary hypothesis of this study is that hyper -radiosensitivity (HRS) seen at extremely low doses of 
radiation (80 cGy ) can be exploited to enhance the effect of chemotherapy, and that this effect differs from the 
cellular effect of higher, standard fractions of radiation used in traditional radiation treatment paradigms.   
 
1.1 Primary Objectives  
 Primary:  
 
1.1 To assess the pri mary site complete response rate of patients treated with 2 cycles of induction 
Docetaxel and Carboplatin with low dose fractionated radiation therapy (LDFRT) compared to 
those treated with chemotherapy alone.  
Secondary:  
 
1.2 To assess overall response rate o f patients to 2 cycles of induction Docetaxel and Carboplatin 
with or without LDFRT  
1.3 To assess the toxicity  and quality of life (Q OL) of LDFRT with chemotherapy compared to 
chemotherapy alone in this patient population  
1.4 To assess the 3 -year overall survival  of patients treated with this regimen.  
1.5 To assess measures of DNA repair (gamma- H2AX levels, PARP activation) and DNA repair 
kinetics (Comet assay) in serial mucosal cell samples obtained from the irradiated region of the head and neck (i.e. buccal, t ongue , pharyngeal wall, etc.)  of subjects on this trial. These will be 
collected:  
1.5.1 Prior to therapy  
1.5.2 During  induction therapy and LDFRT  
1.5.3 During the first week  of full-dose radiation  in both groups.  
The outcomes of the proposed research will provide direct validat ion of the hypothesis that LDFRT improves 
response rates of patients with SCCHN to induction chemotherapy, through a different mechanism than standard fractions of radiation.   
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN)  
 
Squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN) comprise 5% of all cancers, with 40,000 new cases 
diagnosed annually.
1 The age- adjusted incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) 
is 13.07 per 100,000 individuals in Kentucky, placing Kentucky third in incidence rate in the United States.1 
Treatment of locally advanced SCCHN consists of aggressive regimens of chemotherapy and radiation with an approximate 5 -year survival of 50%.
2 There are substantial opportunities to improve survival in this disease, 
and one paradigm that has received extensive study is induction therapy, given prior to definitive treatment with radiation or che moradiation.
3  This has shown a survival advantage in SCCHN in recent years,4-7 but 
with the potential for increased toxicity which has kept this promising therapy from wide adoption by clinical 
Protocol # 13-H&N -24

oncologists.  
 
In addition, it is difficult to tease out the effect of induction because its pairing with concomitant chemotherapy and radiation in all of these studies, with response rate (RR) as a surrogate for that effect  The 
synergy between radiation and chemotherapy is well established in vitro and in the field of SCCHN treatment.
8,9 and has become the standard of care for locally advanced SCCHN since initial studies in the 
1980’s . In general, standard doses of radiation cause single - and double -strand DNA damage, which 
accumulates unrepaired and cause global cellular catastrophe and rapid cell death . Radiation recruits more 
cells into active cell cycle , which, in theory, allows a higher percentage of cells to be susceptible to 
chemotherapy agents. The addition of chemotherapy to radiation, in turn, is thought to alter the intrinsic radioresistance of tumor cells . By killing a percentage of cancer cells,  chemotherapy also allows 
reoxygenation of previously hypoxic areas thus enhancing radiotherapy.  
 Because low doses of radiation (1- 100 cGy) do not cause such global cellular injury, the initial slope of the 
radiation cell -survival curve was presumed to be an ineffective dose range for human tumor therapy . 
However, Joiner and colleagues were the first to describe techniques to adequately study low dose radiation and demonstrated an initial phase of hypersensitivity to radiation at doses less than 100 cGy (Figure 1).
10,11 
Termed hyper -radiosensitivity (HRS), this phenomenon was postulated to be exploitable over 20 years ago.  
 This proposal investigates the role of low -dose fractionated radiation (LDFRT) combin ed with chemotherapy 
as induction therapy in a phase II randomized clinical trial in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck . Correlative studies will evaluate the level of DNA repair and DNA repair kinetics in subjects 
prior to and a fter exposure to low -dose (<100 cGy) and standard dose (> 180 cGy) fractions of radiation 
throughout the course of this treatment . This evaluation of DNA damage will help to elucidate the mechanism 
of cell death that occurs  when cells are exposed to radiat ion doses of less than 100 cGy . The outcomes of the 
proposed research will provide direct validation of the clinical hypothesis that LDFRT improves response rates in patients with SCCHN to induction chemotherapy, and will evaluate and elucidate the level of DNA damage and repair kinetics in response to different doses of radiation . This phase II trial will provide the 
evidence needed to test this treatment paradigm in a phase III trial at the national level and will provide preliminary data for independent funding to study the molecular effects of low -dose radiation.   
 2.2 
 Preclinical Studies using LDFRT  
 Until recently, the initial slope of the radiation cell- survival curve (doses of 0- 100 cGy) was presumed to be 
an ineffective dose range for human tumor ther apy. However, as techniques to adequately study low dose 
radiation have improved, quite the opposite effect has been described. Joiner revolutionized thinking about 
low doses of radiation (<100 cGy ) by demonstrating an initial phase of hypersensitivity to radiation using 
doses from 0 to 50 cGy .
10,11 In work from the University of  Kentucky, Ahmed and colleagues12-14 have 
expanded our understanding of this synergy by combining LDFRT and various chemotherapeutic agents . 
Using very low doses of radiation in combination with chemotherapy, they have demonstrated enhanced cell death compared to chemotherapy or radiation alone. More impor tantly, in cell culture, pro- apoptotic 
pathways were enhanced without the induction of pro- survival pathways; both in p53 mutant and wild- type 
cell lines . Significantly, LDFRT avoids the development of one type of radiation resistance (the upregulation 
of pro-survival pathways) seen with higher dose radiation. This may provide one way to overcome radiation 
resistance, a major cause of treatment failure in SCCHN, while still enhancing cell death.  
 
2.3 Clinical Studies using LDFRT  
 
These pre- clinical studies sug gest a unique synergistic effect between LDFRT and taxane -based 
Protocol # 13-H&N -24 
Version Date: 201 8 March 1st       6 
 
chemotherapy. While  Joiner and colleagues were the first to describe the potential of LDRFT as a therapeutic 
modality, our investigative team has explored the synergy of LDFRT and various chem otherapeutic agents 
in vitro.12,14 We found that chemotherapy followed by LDFRT enhanced cell death compared to 
chemotherapy alone. Based on this preclinical work, we designed a strategy to capitalize on this synergy, 
using LDFRT as a  chemotherapy potentiator in the setting of induction chemotherapy in SCCHN.13  Our 
novel induction strategy was successfully translated into two phase II clinical trials ,13,15 and showed less 
toxicity than other induction chemotherapy regimens and similar efficacy . Using four to eight fractions of 
50 to 80 cGy of LDFRT in combination with chemotherapy provided excellent response rates (85%) and 
favorable long -term survival compared to historical controls.15  Our initial trials were the first in humans 
using this approach, but lacked a comparator arm, which is needed to accurately examine the true effect of 
LDRFT with chemotherapy. This randomized phase II trial design, seeks to prove the hypothesis that LDFRT can enhance  the effect of induction chemotherapy in SCCHN, through the phenomenon of HRS that 
exists at very low doses of radiation.  
The application of HRS and LDFRT to clinical cancer treatment was pioneered by our group, who published the first human trials of this novel paradigm. Potentiating the effect of chemotherapy with the lowest doses of radiation had never been shown to be effective in humans prior to our studies . In addition, work by 
University of Kentucky investigators and colleagues at other institutions has advanced the field of knowledge of LDFRT’s a) interactions with a variety of chemotherapies ,
12-15 b) mechanisms of cellular 
injury, and c) role in phase I and II studies in other tumor types.16 
 
2.4 Rationale for Doce taxel and Carboplatin  
 
Docetaxel is an inhibitor of microtubule function and is well established as a radiosensitize r of cancer cell 
lines in vitro .17,18 Combination therapies utilizing Carboplatin a nd Docetaxel have become the standard for 
induction regimens in SCCHN .6,7,19 Taxanes induce G2/M arrest, the most radiosensitive phase of the cell 
cycle, through inhibition of microtubule function,17,18,20 within two hours after administration and this effect 
peaks between 8 and 12 hours .21,22 Multiple in -vitro studies in head and neck cancer cell lines show supra -
additive effect of taxanes and radiation when cells were exposed to taxanes prior to irradiation .17 In vitro 
data with Carboplatin also indicates an additive effect when given prior to irradiation using various cell lines .
23 Additionally , the pharmacokinetics of carboplatin is  not altered by pretreatment with taxanes at 
standard dose s. The combination of Docetaxel and Carboplatin was chosen because of the proof of its 
efficacy in induction therapy in head and neck cancer, as well as the ability to complete chemotherapy infusion in a timely manner to allow for two fractions of LDFRT to be delivered on Day 1. We propose to 
expand our understanding of LD FRT and chemotherapy in a randomized phase II study of Docetaxel and 
Carboplatin with LDFRT as induction therapy in patients with bulky Stage II, Stage III and IV H&N cancer.  
 
2.5 Correlative Studies  
 
In preclinical studies, low dose radiation is thought to e xert its influence in the early G2/M checkpoint 
through the damage response of G2- phase cells . Radiation induces DNA double strand breaks with cellular 
response including phosphorylation of ATM, followed by activation of downstream targets with gamma -
H2AX operating as a damage sensor  
24. In preclinical studies, Krueger and colleagues  25 demonstrated that 
low-dose hyper -radiosensitivity caused a predictable increase in gamma- H2AX within 1 -2 hours after each 
low dose fraction, but this has not been studied in humans to date . To determine the effect of low -dose 
radiation, we will measure the time dependent expression of gamma -H2AX in serial mucosal sampling 
from the irradiated mucosa of these patients . Tissues will be collected pre -therapy and  after the first dose 
of induction chemotherapy and LDFRT, as well as within the first week of definitive,  full-dose radiation, 
as listed in section 5. 4. In addition, assessment of DNA repair kinetics through the use of Comet assays 
Protocol # 13-H&N -24 
Version Date: 201 8 March 1st       7 
 
will allow an estimation of DNA repair when human cells ar e exposed to low doses and full doses of 
radiation. Planned investigation will include the analysis of markers of DNA damage : including 
immunohistochemical staining for PARP (single -strand breaks) gamma- H2AX (double -strand breaks) and 
DNA repair kinetics ( Comet assay) analyzed at multiple time points to assess radiosensitization of cancer 
cells by different doses of ionizing  radiation . Correlative endpoints will provide intra -patient assessment of 
response to DNA damage by low -dose and standard dose radiati on, by direct evaluation within the 
radiation port . This avenue of study is unique  and sampling at different time points will help define the 
different  cellular responses to low -dose (<100 cGy) radiation and standard dose radiation ( >180 cGy) .   
 
2.6 Rationale  
 The primary hypothesis of this study is that hyper -radiosensitivity ( HRS ) seen at low doses of radiation 
(80 cGy) can be exploited to potentiate the effect of chemotherapy, and that this hrs results in DNA  
damage response that is distinct from the DNA damage response caused by traditional doses of 
radiation (> 180 cGy) used in cancer treatment.  
 
3. PATIENT SELECTION  
 3.1 Eligibility Criteria  
 
3.1.1 Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced  head and neck cancer 
of squamous type stage III, IVA and IV B (larynx, oral cavity, oropharynx and hypophary nx or unknown 
primary isolated to the head and neck region) and select Stage II tumors of the BOT (size more than 3 cm), who are appropriate for potentially curative therapy with chemoradiotherapy  or surgical resection , 
as determined by the Multidisciplinary Head and Neck Cancer Clinical Care and Research Team . 
 3.1.2 Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurat ely measured 
in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non- nodal lesions and short axis for 
nodal lesions) as ≥20 mm with conventional techniques or as ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam . See Section 11 for t he evaluation of measurable disease. All disease must 
be assessed within 28 days prior to registration.   
 3.1.3 ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2 (see Appendix A).  
 3.1.4 No prior chemotherapy for the current locally advanced SCCHN . Prior radiation or chemotherapy  for a 
previous head and neck cancer is allowed provided full dose radiation can be delivered to the current treatment and provided the patient remains in remission for greater than 3 years from prior diagnosis.  
 
3.1.5 Age ≥18 years.  
 
3.1.6 Life expectancy of greater  than  3 months  
 
3.1.7 Patients must have normal organ and marrow function measured within 14 days of registration as defined below:  
 
− absolute neutrophil count  ≥ 1,000/mcL  
− platelets  ≥ 100,000/mcL  
− total bilirubin  ≤ institutional upper limit of normal 
− AST(SGOT      ≤ 1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal 
Protocol # 13-H&N -24 
Version Date: 201 8 March 1st       8 
 
− Alkaline phosphatase   ≤ 2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal  
− creatinine  within normal institutional limits  
OR 
− Creatinine  clearance  ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above 
institutional normal.  
 
3.1.8 The effects of Docetaxel, Carboplatin, and LDFRT are known teratogens . For this reason, women of 
child -bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier  
method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry , throughout the duration of active treatment 
and for 4 months after completion of chemotherapy and radiation. Should a woman become pregnant 
or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform 
her treating physician immediately . Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use 
adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of active study treatment , and for 4 months 
after completion of chemotherapy and radiation (both induction and definitive) administration. 
 3.1.9 ity to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.  
3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 3.2.1 Prior chemotherapy for the current SCCHN will not be allowed . Patients with second primary cancers 
of the head and neck  who remain in remission for 3 years from the prior diagnosis are eligible for 
this study, provided they may receive full dose radiation to the current SCCHN cancer.  
 3.2.2 Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.  
 
3.2.3 Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurolog ic and other adverse events.  
 
3.2.4 History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to Carboplatin or Docetaxel.  
 
3.2.5 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symp tomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric 
illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.  
 
3.2.6 Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Docetaxel, Carboplatin, and radiation are 
agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects . Because there is an unknown but 
potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with Docetaxel, Carboplatin and radiation, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated 
with these agents and /or radiation. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this 
study.  
 
Protocol # 13-H&N -24 
Version Date: 201 8 March 1st       9 
 
3.2.7 HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of th e potential 
for pharmacokinetic interactions with Docetaxel, Carboplatin and radiation. In addition, these 
patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow -suppressive therapy . 
Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when 
indicated.  
 3.2.8 No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ  cervical cancer, adequately treated previous Stage I or II canc er 
from which the patient is currently in complete remission or other cancer from which the patient has been disease- free for 3 years.  
 3.2.9 Patients with nasopharynx  or salivary gland primary site will be excluded from this trial.  
 3.2.10 Patients with distant metas tatic disease (M1c) will not be eligible for this study.  
 3.2.11 Patients with grade II or greater peripheral neuropathy will be excluded from study.  
 
Note:  In calculating days of tests and measurements, the day a test or measurement is done is considered 
Day 0 . Therefore, if a test is done on a Monday, the Monday four weeks later would be considered Day 28. 
If Day 28 falls on a weekend or holiday, the test or measurement may be performed on the next working day  
 
3.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
 Both men and wom en of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.  The required table below shows

potential benefits, and the voluntary nature of participation. The informed consent document provides a 
summary of the clinical study and the individual's rights as a research participant. The document acts as a 
starting point for the necessary exchange of information between the investigator and potential research 
participant . Also, research participants and their families may use the consent document as an information 
resource and reference throughout participation in the trial . The informed consent document is often 
considered the foundation of the informed consent process; it does not, however, represent the entirety of the process . Nor is the informed consent document a risk- management tool for the investigator and/or 
institution.  
 The investigator must explain to each subject (or legally authorized representative) the nature of the study, its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, the potential risks,  and benefits involved and 
any discomfort it may entail. Each sub ject must be informed that participation in the study is voluntary and 
that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the treating physician.  
 This informed consent should be given by means of a standard written statement, written in non -technical 
language. The subject should read and consider the statement before signing and dating it, and should be given a copy of the signed document. If the subje ct cannot read or sign the documents, oral presentation may 
be made or signature given by the subject’s legally appointed representative, if witnessed by a person not involved in the study, mentioning that the patient could not read or sign the documents. No patient can enter the study before his/her informed consent has been obtained. The informed consent form is considered part  
of the protocol, and must be submitted by the investigator with the protocol at the time of IRB review.  
Protocol # 13-H&N -24 
Version Date: 201 8 March 1st       11 
 
4.4 Compliance with Laws and Regulations  
 
The study will be conducted in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the Declaration of Helsinki, any applicable local health authority, and Institutional Review Board (IRB) requirements . The PI 
or designee will be responsible for obtaining continuing and not less than annual  IRB re -approval throughout 
the duration of the study . Copies of the Investigator’s annual report to the IR B and copies of the IRB 
continuance of approval must maintained by the MCC CRDM SRF . The PI or designee is also responsible 
for notifying the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee of the MCC and the UK IRB of any significant adverse events that are serious and/or unexpected, as per SOP’s of those entities . DSMC will review all 
adverse events of this IIT as per its SOP.  
 
5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 5.1 Pre-treatment Studies  
  
Prior to any study -required tests, subjects must first provide written informed consent to participa te in this 
study . Within 6 weeks, all patients will undergo a direct laryngoscopy (DL) or indirect laryngoscopy (IDL) 
(if the primary tumor is easily and completely evaluable by IDL). Within  4 weeks  of registration, all patients 
will undergo a history and physical exam, ECOG performance status evaluation,, a CT or MRI scan of the involved area of the head and neck and a CT of the Chest or chest X -ray.  Within 2 weeks of registration, all 
patients will undergo a complete blood count with differential and pla telets, and serum chemistries 
(including sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, total protein, albumin, BUN, creatinine, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin).  
 
5.2 Agent Administration  
 Treatment will be administered on an outpatient or inpatient basis. Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 6. No investigational or commercial agents or therapies other than those described below may be administered with the intent to trea t the patient's malignancy. Carboplatin and Docetaxel are 
FDA approved for this indication and will be administered as below on Day 1 and 22. Radiation will be 
given on Days 1, 2, 22, and 23 of chemotherapy . The first fraction will be given within 1 hour a fter 
completion of Carboplatin while the remaining fractions of each cycle will have at least a 3 -hr interfraction 
interval.

**Anti -emetic regimen per NCCN and institutional guidelines  
 
5.3 Chemotherapy Premedication and Dosing:  
 
All chemotherapy will use actual body weight and will be administered as an i.v. infusion. Docetaxel will be given at a dose of 75 mg/m2 intravenously over one hour on Days 1 and 22. Docetaxel will be dosed to the 
nearest 5mg using a standard body surface area chart. Carboplatin infusion will follow Docetaxel and will be given at a dose of Area under  the Curve of 6 (using Cockcroft -Gault calculation) intravenously over one hour 
on Days 1 and 22.  
 To avoid allergic reactions associated with Docetaxel, the following premedications are recommended:  
 
• Dexamethasone 8mg PO BID 1 day prior to, day of and day after chemotherapy . If a patient fails to 
premedicate on the day prior to chemotherapy, then give dexamethasone 12mg IV  
 Other anti -emetics are per institutional standard and at the discret ion of the treating physician.  
 
5.4 Pre- and Post -Induction Treatment Tissue sampling  
 
Prior to chemotherapy and radiation  and as outlined below , patients will undergo buccal swab sampling  in 
the mouth. Wherever possible this sampling will be  in the area of the radiation  delivery . See Appendix D 
for sampling instructions  
 
Buccal sampling:  
Subjects wi ll first rinse their mouth with water . The mucosa will be swabbed with a cytology brush (which 
is then discarded), subjects will rinse again and the same area will be scraped gently with a wooden spatula 10 times. Specimens are fixed onto uncharged slides and spray fixed.  A second cytology brush is then applied to the area and placed in media for storage as per sample collection instructions (see correlative section 9.0 and Appendix D ). These samples will be collected with a mandatory pre -treatment sample and a 
minimum of 3 samples during induction, and a minimum of 3 samples during definitive radiation as 
described in Appendix D .   
 
5.5 Post-Induction Reassessment  
 
Following two cycles of induction therapy  and at least 2 weeks after the last LDFRT dose, subjects will have 
reassessment by radiographic and clinical evaluation (DL or IDL) to assess primary site and complete RR . 
A panendoscopy will only be performed, if the primary tumor is not easily and completely assessable by 
indirect laryngoscopy . The assessment of tumor response will be made by the otolaryngologist  or oncologist  
performing the procedure . In the case of apparent progressive disease, biopsies of the primary tumor area 
will be taken . This is considered part of routine care of patients und ergoing neoadjuvant therapy . If a subject 
has biopsy or surgical removal, those tissues will also be collected for correlative study (although no surgical 
removal is planned in these patients). Following induction, all subjects will undergo definitive radi ation and 
chemotherapy  or surgery, as per standard of care, as pre -determined by a multidisciplinary review of cases . 
Subjects must have recovered from all study related ( possible, probable or definite ) toxicities to <  grade 2 
(CTCAE v 4.0) as determined by  the treating physician prior to initiation of definite treatment.  Definite 
therapy should occur on or after Day 43 and prior to Day 64 from the start of induction (Day 1). Definitive radiation will incorporate the dose of radiation used during induction into the final dose calculation, with dose adjustments of definitive radiation made at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.  Definitive 
Protocol # 13-H&N -24 
Version Date: 201 8 March 1st       13 
 
surgery will incorporate standard of care surgical removal.  
 
5.6 Dosage and fields Low -Dose Fractionated Radiation (LDFRT)  
 
Doses of 80 cGy per fraction will be administered (to a total of 640  cGy for the entire induction scheme). 
The patient will be treated with shaped fields encompassing gross disease only (including the primary and gross nodal disease) with a maximum 2cm margin . The spinal cord will be excluded from the radiation field 
and CT based treatment planning will be used as needed and as appropriate.   
5.7 Dosage and fields for Standard Fraction Radiation post -Induction  
 
Following induction, dosage and f ields for definitive standard fractionation will be determined by the 
treating radiation oncologist . The accepted standard total dose of radiation used for definitive therapy ranges 
from 66 -72Gy when once -daily RT is used at 1.8- 2.0Gy/fraction and from 74.4- 81.6Gy when twice -daily 
RT is used at 1.2Gy/fraction. In calculating the planned total dose of radiation to be used for subsequent, definitive therapy the radiation oncologist will incorporate the induction dose used into the final calculation for a maxi mum total dose of approximately 74Gy if once -daily fractionation is used or approximately 
82.4Gy if twice -daily fractionation is used. Since the 640 cGy used in the induction regimen is delivered at 
a very low dose/fraction (i.e. 80cGy), it is expected tha t the incorporation of this dose into the calculated 
total doses should not be associated with any significant increase in late radiation damage/effect, as previously described in our non- randomized phase II trials.  
 Management and dose modifications assoc iated with the above adverse events are outlined in Section 6. 
Performance status will be evaluated based on the ECOG Perform ance Status Criteria (Appendix A ). 
Toxicities will be graded  as per section 7.0.   
 
5.8 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
The use of concomitant bisphosphanates, and other supportive medications determined necessary for the health of subjects are allowed, but concurrent cancer therapies other than the treatment regimen of this trial are not allowed . Caution s hould be taken when administering supportive medications that are metabolized 
through the cytochrome P450 system, although this study does not specifically exclude agents known to affect or with the potential to affect selected CYP450 is enzymes .  
 
5.9 Duration of Therapy  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue for 2 cycles  or until one 
of the following criteria applies: 
 
• Disease progression,  
 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatme nt, 
 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
 
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or  
 
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further 
treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
Protocol # 13-H&N -24 
Version Date: 201 8 March 1st       14 
 
 
  
5.10 Duration of Follow Up  
 
Patients will be followed by study team until resolution of side effects from induction therapy to less than or equal to grade 1 toxicity (excluding previously existing conditions, which must return to baseline) AND until the patient  has completed their  definitive chemotherapy and radiation or definitive surgery with follow -
up scans (per institutional guidelines be usually performed within 8 weeks of  last dose of radiation) . Patients 
will be followed for 3 years after completion of the study by the Kentucky Cancer Registry which is required by law to follow all cancer patients diagnosed in Kentucky for their lifetime from the time of diagnosis until death . KCR routinely records overall survival, as well as time of first recurrence and sites of recurrence,  
therefore, is uniquely qualified to follow these patients long -term. At the point three years from completion 
of final subject, and at interim analysis, the KCR will search the database for survival, both overall and progression- free. 
 
5.11 Criteria for Remova l from Study  
Patients will be removed from study when any of the criteria listed in Section 5. 9 applies . The reason for 
study removal and the date the patient was removed must be documented in the Case Report Form. 
  
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE M ODIFICATIONS  
 6.1 Dose Modifications  
 
Cycle 2 of therapy may be administered provided the subject meets all of the following criteria within 2 days 
of Cycle 2 Day 1:  
 
• ANC ≥ 1,000/µL.  
• Platelet count ≥ 75,000/µL.  
• total bilirubin ≤ institutional upper limit of normal 
• AST(SGOT ≤ 1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal

• Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN OR measured or calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min 
using the Cockcroft -Gault.  
 
Assessment for dose modification will be conducted prior to each dose . Dose escalation will not be allowed 
during this study . Chemotherapy doses may be reduced or held for hematological and non- hematological 
effects . If chemotherapy is held, radiotherapy will be held and will restart on the same day as 
chemotherapy based on the parameters for alteration due to toxicity listed below . Radiation doses are 
not decreased. Treatment may be delayed no mo re than three  weeks to allow recovery from toxicity . A 
patient will be allowed a maximum of two dose reductions . Dose adjustments will be made according to the 
following guidelines:

arrhythmia/dysfunction occurs.  
 
7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIS T AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial . The following list of 
AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section 7.2) will determine whether the event requires expedited  reporting (via Medwatch form 3500A ) in addition  to routine  reporting.  
 
7.1 Adverse Events and Potential Risks  
 
7.1.1 Adverse Event List for Docetaxel   
 
Incidence rates of all adverse events associated with Docetaxel are provided in the product package insert . 
Side effects include:

Miscellaneous: Pain, asthenia, flu -like syndrome.  
 
7.1.3 Adverse Event List for Low -dose Radiation  
  
Reversible skin changes and mucositis are expected side effects of radiotherapy . Combined modality therapy 
increases the risk for acute toxicities, bu t with low doses of radiation ( 640 cGy total) minimal toxicity is 
expected, as reported in our prior studies ( 14-16). The total dose of radiation given as definitive therapy after 
completion of induction will take into account this initial dose of radiatio n, and will be at the discretion of 
the attending radiation oncologist.  
 
7.1.4 Other Adverse Event List for Low -dose Radiation 
 There is estimated to be a 1% risk per year of second primary cancers in this population of patients, which is unrelated to treatment.  
 
7.2 Adverse Event Characteristics  
 
• CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found in th e 
revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting . All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE 
version4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
. 
 
• For expedited reporting purposes only:   
- AEs should be reported using  a Medwatch form  only if required by the reporting chart below.  
- Other AEs for the protocol  that do not require expedited reporting are outlined in section 7.3.4. 
 
• Attribution  of the AE:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
  
7.3 Expedit ed Adverse Event Reporting  
 
7.3.1 For MCC Investigator -Initiated Trials (IITs), investigators must  report to the Overall PI any 
serious adverse event (SAE) that occurs after the initial dose of study treatment, during treatment, or within 30 days of the last dose of treatment on the local institutional SAE form. This applies to the following categories : 
• Grade 3 (severe) Events – Only events that are Unexpected and Possibly, Probably or definitely  related  / Associated with the Intervention.

documentation AEs reported through expedited processes (e.g., report ed to the IRB, FDA, etc.) must 
also be reported in routine study data submissions.  
  
8. PHARMACEUTICAL INFOR MATION  
 
A list of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the commercial agents administered in this study can be found in Section 7.1.  
8.1 Commercial Agent:  Docetaxel  
 
(Please refer to the package insert for further information)   
8.1.1 Other Names  
Taxotere, RP 56976, NSC #628503.   
8.1.2 Classification  
 Anti-microtubule agent.  
 
8.1.3  Mode of Action  
 Docetaxel, a semisynthetic analog of taxol , promotes the assembly of tubulin and inhibits microtubule 
depolymerization. Bundles of microtubules accumulate and interfere with cell division.   
8.1.4 Storage and Stability  
 Docetaxel infusion solution, if stored between 2 and 25ºC (36 and 77ºF) is stable f or 4 hours. Fully prepared 
docetaxel infusion solution (in either 0.9% Sodium Chloride solution or 5% Dextrose solution) should be used within 4 hours (including the administration time). Store between 2 and 25°C (36 and 77ºF). Retain in 
Protocol # 13-H&N -24 
Version Date: 201 8 March 1st       20 
 
the original packa ge to protect from bright light. Freezing does not adversely affect the product.  
 
8.1.5 Dose Specifics  
 
Docetaxel will be administered as a 60 minute intravenous infusion. Dose will be calculated based on the patient’s actual body weight.  
 
8.1.6 Preparation  
 Docet axel is a cytotoxic anticancer drug and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be 
exercised when handling and preparing docetaxel solutions. The use of gloves is recommended.  
 If docetaxel concentrate, initial diluted solution, or fina l dilution for infusion should come into contact with 
the skin, immediately and thoroughly wash with soap and water. If docetaxel concentrate, initial diluted solution, or final dilution for infusion should come into contact with mucosa, immediately and thoroughly wash with water.  
 Docetaxel for Injection Concentrate requires two dilutions prior to administration. Please follow the preparation instructions provided below. NOTE: Both the docetaxel for Injection Concentrate and the 
diluent vials contain an overfill.   A. Preparation of the Initial Diluted Solution  
 1. Gather the appropriate number of vials of docetaxel for Injection Concentrate and diluent (13% Ethanol in Water fo r Injection). If the vials were refrigerated, allow them to stand at room temperature for 
approximately 5 minutes.   2. Aseptically withdraw the contents of the appropriate diluent vial into a syringe and transfer it to the appropriate vial of docetaxel for Injection Concentrate. If the procedure is followed as described, an initial 
diluted solution of 10mg docetaxel/mL will result.  
 
3. Mix the initial diluted solution by repeated inversions for at least 45 seconds to assure full mixture of the concentrate and diluent. Do not shake.  
 4. The initial diluted docetaxel solution (10 mg docetaxel/mL) should be clear; however, there may be some foam on top of the solution due to the polysorbate 80. Allow the solution to stand for a few minutes to allow any foam to dissipate. It is not required that all foam dissipate prior to continuing the preparation process. 
The initial diluted solution may be used immediately or stored either in the refrigerator or at room temperature for a maximum of 8 hours.  B. Preparation of the Final Dilution for Infusion   1. Aseptically withdraw the required amount of initial diluted docetaxel solution (10mg docetaxel/mL) with a calibrated syringe and inject into an infusion bag or bottle of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride solution or 5% Dextrose solution to produce a final concentration of 0.3 to 0.74mg/mL. Thoroughly mix the infusion by 
manual rotation.   2. As with all parenteral products, docetaxel should be inspected visually for particulate matter or discoloration prior to administration whenever the solution and container permit. If the docetaxel for Injection, initial diluted solution, or final dilution for infusion is not clear or appears to have precipitation, 
Protocol # 13-H&N -24 
Version Date: 201 8 March 1st       21 
 
these should be discarded.  
 The final docetaxel dilution for infusion should be administered intravenously as per protocol under ambient room temperature and lighting conditions.  Contact of the docetaxel concentrate with plasticized PVC equipment or devices used to prepare solutions for infusion is not recommended. In order t o minimize patient exposure to the plasticizer DEHP (di- 2-
ethylhexyl phthalate), which may be leached from PVC infusion bags or sets, the final docetaxel dilution for infusion should be stored in bottles (glass, polypropylene) or plastic bags (polypropylene, polyolefin) and administered through polyethylene -lined administration sets.  
 
8.1.7 Route of Administration  
 Docetaxel will be administered as a 60 minute infusion in saline or D5W through an administration set that does not contain phthalate plasticizers a long the fluid pathway that is connected to the patient’s vascular 
access catheter.  
 
8.1.8 Incompatibilities  
 Contact of the undiluted concentrate with plasticized PVC equipment or devices used to prepare solutions for infusion should be avoided. Diluted docetaxel solution should be stored in bottles (glass, polypropylene) or plastic bags (polypropylene, polyolefi n) and administered through polyethylene -lined administration sets. 
(See Sec. 8.2.6.b).  
 The metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4, such as cy closporine, terfenadine, ketoconazole, 
erythromycin, and troleandomycin. Caution should be exercised with these drugs when treating patients receiving docetaxel as there is a potential for a significant interaction.

8.2.3 Mode of Action  
 
Like cisplatin, carboplatin binds to DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis, in a cell cycle nonspecific manner. Carboplatin must first undergo activation to produce antineoplastic activity. Bidentate carboxylate ligands of carboplatin are displaced by water forming (aquation) positively charged platinum complexes 
which bind to nucleophilic sites in DNA, such as the O -6 position on guanine. Carboplatin produces 
predominantly interstrand DNA crosslinks rather than DNA -protein crosslinks. Intrastrand crosslinks result 
from the formation of adducts between the activated platinum complexes of the drug and the N -7 atom (not 
exclusively) atom on guanine to produce 1, 2 intrastrand links between adjacent guanine molecules, between 
neighboring guanine and adenosine molecules, or between neighboring guanine molecules. Interstrand 
cross -linking within the DNA helix also occurs. Platinum adducts may inhibit DNA replication, transcription 
and ultimately cell division.   
8.2.4 Storage and Stabili ty  
 Intact vials are stored at room temperature protected from light. The reconstituted solution is stable for at least 24 hours. When further diluted in glass or polyvinyl plastic to a concentration of 10mg/mL with normal saline or 5% dextrose carboplati n is stable for 8 hours at 25 degrees C. Stability with further dilution to 
0.5mg/mL has been reported for up to 8 hours. Other stability data indicate that carboplatin is stable for up to 24 hours and may be refrigerated;  however, the manufacturer recomme nds that reconstituted solutions be 
discarded after 8 hours due to the lack of preservative in drug formulation.   
8.2.5 Dose Specifics  
 Carboplatin will be given by IV at an area under the curve (AUC) dose of 6. Routine premedication should include at least a 5- HT antagonist and dexamethasone. The dose of carboplatin based on target AUC is 
calculated using the Calvert equation:  
Dose (total mg) = Target AUC X (GFR + 25). The patient’s creatinine clearance (GFR) in mL/minute is calculated by the Cockcroft  Gault equation.  
NOTE: When using the Calvert equation, GFR should not exceed 125 mL/min. Thus, the maximum 
carboplatin dose is 6 x (125 + 25), or 900 mg.  
 
8.2.6 Preparation  
 Add 5, 15, or 45 mL sterile water, normal saline, or 5% dextrose to the 50, 150, or 450 mg vial, respectively. The resulting solution contains 10 mg/mL. The desired dose is further diluted, usually in 5% dextrose.   
8.2.7 Administration  
 Infuse over 30 minutes  
 
8.2.8 Incompatibilities  
 Aluminum displaces platinum from the carboplatin molecule, resulting in the formation of a black precipitate and loss of potency. Carboplatin solutions should not be prepared or administered with needles, syringes, catheters, or IV administration sets containing aluminum parts that might be in contact with the drug.

8.2.9 Drug Interactions  
 
Concomitant myelosuppressive drugs or radiation therapy may potentiate the hematologic toxicity of carboplatin.  
Concomitant nephrotoxic drugs may potentiate the nephrotoxicity of carboplatin, particularly when carboplatin is given in high -dose chemotherapy regimens.  
 
8.2.10 Compatibilities  
 
Carboplatin (0.3 mg/mL) is chemically compatible in normal saline or 5% dextrose for 24 hours at room temperature.  
  
8.2.11 Availability  
 Carboplatin is commercially available as a lyophilized powder in 50, 150, or 450 mg vials.  
  
9. BIOMARKER, CORRELATI VE, AND SPECIAL STUDIES  
 9.1 Biomarker Studies  
 
It is well established that radiation doses >  180 cGy causes DNA damage in the form of double -strand and 
single -strand breaks,8,9 which accumulate unrepaired and cause global  cellular catastrophe and rapid cell 
death.8,26 In contrast, DNA damage caused by LDFRT is proposed to differ from higher -dose radiation 
through enhancement of , pro- apoptotic pathways without induction of pro- survival pathways.12,14  We 
propose to explore whether these in vitro findings are replicated in humans, through the study of the effect 
of LDFRT and chemotherapy on human samples obtained during this clinical trial.  This  will be 
accomplished by  evaluating intra -patient variation in DNA damage responses to different doses of radiation 
via: a) markers of DNA damage responses, PARP (DNA single -strand breaks) and γ -H2AX (DNA double -
strand breaks), and b) DNA repair kinetics m easured by Comet assay. The γ -H2AX foci formation is the 
most frequently used marker for cellular DNA damage response to ionizing radiation. However, the benefit 
of using the extent of γH2AX foci as a measure of biodosimetry (or dose -dependent radiation- induced DNA 
damage) during radiation therapy has only recently been described.27,28  PARP (poly(ADP -ribose) 
polymerase) is a marker more specific to DNA single- strand breaks, and PARP activity has been linked to 
both beneficial (DNA repair) and harmful (inflammation caused by PARP over -
activation) pathophysiologic effects. Therefore, mon itoring both biomarkers will 
provide us a unique capability to assess key responses to varying doses of radiation in 
patients.  
 Using buccal swab sampling 
29 30,31  of the 
involved- field of radiation to study DNA 
repair, is novel. In Fig. 2, we assessed the immunost aining procedure with intact buccal 
cells collected from normal volunteers (Fig. 2a&b). As expected, γ -H2AX foci were absent (Fig. 2a) from 
unexposed buccal cells and normal oral keratinocytes OKF4 (Fig. 2c, compare to cells exposed to H
2O2 in

localized in nuclei, demonstrating that the proposed procedure is feasible in human cells.  
 
(c) Approach   
Sample collection:  
Subjects will rinse their mouth, and the mucosa will be swabbed with a cytology brush,  subjects will rinse 
again and the same area will be swabbed gently with a wooden spatula 10 times. Cytology  brush will be 
placed in media and transported to research lab, and spatula s pecimens are fixed onto uncharged slides and 
spray fixed .  A second cytology brush is then applied to the area and placed in media for storage and/or 
subsequent processing for Comet assays (see above).  Following collection, fixed slides ar e then stable until 
staining . Following collection, fixed slides are then stable until staining.  Prior to staining, slides are placed 
in 95% alcohol for removal of the coating fixative. To enable multiple immunostaining experiment on a glass plates, the b uccal spread will be separated by hydrophobic (wax) pen. The samples will be blocked in 
1% BSA solution for 1 h, and then antibodies for γ -H2AX and poly(ADP -ribose) will be applied and 
incubated for 2 h. After washing with 1% BSA, secondary antibodies conj ugated to AlexaFluora488 will be 
applied and incubated for 1 h. If necessary, a positive control (e.g., APE1 antibody) for the staining will be used. The samples will then be washed in 1% BSA, stained with DAPI solution, then mounted on anti -fading 
reagent  and sandwiched on coverslips. Cells will be analyzed using an inverted fluorescence microscope in 
Izumi lab with x40 objective. Cells will be analyzed using an inverted fluorescence microscope in Izumi lab with x40 objective. For counting foci numbers, an  analytical software Image- J (NIH) will be used.

demonst rated that low -dose HRS caused a predictable increase in γ -H2AX within 1 -2 hours after each low 
dose fraction.  To determine the effect of LDFRT and full -dose RT, we will measure the time dependent 
expression of γ -H2AX as well as direct DNA damage in serial mucosal sampling from the irradiated mucosa 
of these patients.  We expect that LDFRT -mediated DNA damage will increase the expression of γ -H2AX, 
but not to the extent seen in full -dose radiation. Preliminary experiments have shown the feasibility of usin g 
γ-H2AX antibody for damage specific foci detection (Fig. 2a&b), including immunostaining procedure for 
buccal cell staining from normal human volunteers (Fig. 2a&b). APE1, an essential DNA repair protein, was 
detected predominantly in the nuclei of the buccal cells when stained with an APE1 antibody (Fig. 2d), indicating our immunostaining protocol can effectively probe for damage/repair proteins.  In this setting, no γH2AX foci were detected because the specimen was unirradiated. The result in Fig. 2c is  still informative 
as it sets the background intensity of γH2AX, and we will elucidate how the signal changes after LDFRT and full -dose radiation. 
Comet assays will determine both damage induction on samples collected immediately after radiation and repair  kinetics on samples collected serially from the same subjects during LDFRT and full -dose radiation. 
After collection or upon removal from storage, buccal cells are washed in PBS, collected by centrifugation, resuspended in low -melting agarose solution, and then immobilized on slides. Immobilized cells are lysed 
and resulting nucleoids (nuclear DNA spheres) are subject to electrophoresis. Subsequently, DNA in these samples is stained with SYBR Gold and visualized by fluorescence microscopy to assess DNA dam age, Sampling schedule for buccal collection (minimum of 3 times points needed for 
kinetics of radiation)

evidenced by migration of DNA away from the nucleoid (head) to form a comet -like tail. DNA damage 
levels are quantified from signal intensity in comet tails relative to the head, from ≥50 cells per sample. 
Electrophoresis under neutral conditions is used to measure radiation -induced DNA double -strand breaks 
while alkaline conditions reveal the sum of abasic sites, single - and double -strand breaks. Fig. 3 shows 
alkaline Comet images of buccal cells untreated or treated ex vivo with H2O2; note the prominent tail 
produced by H2O2 treatment that induces type s of damage similar to that of radiation. Our correlative studies 
(by Orren/Izumi) will be compared to the clinical 
assessment of treatment to assess response to 
treatment, time to progression and survival.  These 
correlations will be exploratory in nature . 
9.2 Correlative Studies (Tumor Biopsy 
and Radiation Port Images ) 
Subjects who have previously collected tumor 
tissue will be asked to give permission for correlative studies on these biopsies.  Participants will not have to undergo any additional biopsies of  their tumor to be on this study, only buccal mucosal samples as 
described in section of the protocol .  De -identified images from radiation treatment planning will also be 
available to investigators for correlation with DNA repair findings and location of the buccal swab in relation to radiation fields.  No identifiers will be given to investigators.

10. STUDY CALENDAR  
Within 6 weeks, all patients will undergo a direct laryngoscopy (DL) or indirect laryngoscopy (IDL) (if the 
primary tumor is easily and completely evaluable by IDL). Within 4 weeks of registration, all patients will undergo a history and physical exam, ECO G performance status evaluation, a CT or MRI scan of the 
involved area of the head and neck and a CT of the Chest or chest X -ray. Within 2 weeks of registration, all 
patients will undergo a complete blood count with differential and platelets, and serum chemistries. Once 
informed consent and enrollment have been completed, subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment 
arms: a) chemotherapy alone or b) chemotherapy plus LDFRT. Treatment will be administered on an

11. MEASUREMENT OF EFFEC T 
 
11.1 Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be evaluated for response to induction after 2 cycles of therapy.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by 
the revised Response Evaluation Cr iteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) ( 34). Changes 
in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
11.1.1 Definitions  
 
Evaluable for toxicity . All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first 
treatment with Docetaxel, Carboplatin, and LDFRT . 
 
Evaluable for objective response . Only those patients who have measurable disease present at 
baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated will 
be considered evaluable for response . These patients will have their response classified according 
to the definitions stated below . (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to 
the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable Non- Target Disease Response. Patients who have lesions present at baseline that are 
evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have receive d at least one cycle of 
therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated will be considered evaluable for non- target 
disease. The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
11.1.2 Disease Parameters  
 
Measur able disease. Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at 
least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥20 mm by chest x -ray or as ≥10 mm with 
CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam . All tumor measurements must be recorded in 
millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Malignant lymph nodes . To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node 
must be ≥15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm) . At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and 
followed. 
 
Non-measurable disease. All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes wit h ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered 
non-measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non -measurable.  
 Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, by 
Protocol # 13-H&N -24 
Version Date: 201 8 March 1st       28 
 
definition, simple cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if 
they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are 
present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
Target lesions . All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions sho uld be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements . It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest 
lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for 
non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for al l target lesions will be calculated and reported 
as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum . The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further 
characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over 
and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non -target lesions and should be recorded at 
baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up.  
 
11.1.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers . All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 to 6 weeks before the beginning of the treatment  (see study c alendar) . 
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
 
Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial ( e.g., 
skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin 
nodules) . In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung . However, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less . If CT scans have slice thickness greater 
than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness . MRI is 
also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body scans).   
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and tempo ral resolution; 
however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image 
Protocol # 13-H&N -24 
Version Date: 201 8 March 1st       29 
 
quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement . Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable 
globally . As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the  technical specifications of the scanning 
sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease . Furthermore, 
as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline and the 
lesions should be me asured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the 
RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases . Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acqui sition 
protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans . Body scans should be performed 
with breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
 
PET- CT  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET -CT is 
not a lways of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements . However, if the 
site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a 
diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of t he PET -CT can be used for 
RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 
Ultrasound  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement . Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for 
independent review later  and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the 
same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next . If new lesions are 
identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised . If there 
is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not 
advised . However, such techniques may be usef ul to confirm complete pathological response when 
biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
 
Tumor markers  Tumor  markers alone cannot be used to assess re sponse . If markers are initially 
above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and 
PSA response (in recurrent prost ate cancer) have been published [ JNCI  96:487- 488, 2004; J Clin 
Oncol  17, 3461- 3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  26:1148- 1159, 2008] . In addition, the Gynecologic 
Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -125 progression criteria which are to be integrated with 
objective t umor assessment for use in first -line trials in ovarian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534- 1535, 2000]. 
 
Cytology, Histology   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses (PR) 
and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell 
tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for respons e or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
FDG -PET  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment 
Protocol # 13-H&N -24 
Version Date: 201 8 March 1st       30 
 
of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease) . New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging 
can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of PD based on 
a new lesion.  
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD . If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow -up 
CT  scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the 
date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal F DG-PET scan) . If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
c. FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases 
where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring . The use 
of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and 
supported by disease -specific medical literature for the in dication . However, it must be 
acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -
PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
 Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater 
than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 
 
11.1.4 Response Criteria  
 
11.1.4.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions . Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have r eduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study) . In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm . (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progressions).  
 
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on stu dy. 
  
11.1.4.2 Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level . All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
 Note:  If tumor markers are initially a bove the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Protocol # 13-H&N -24 
Version Date: 201 8 March 1st       31 
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive D isease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non- target lesions . Unequivocal progression should not normally trump 
target lesion status . It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a sin gle lesion 
increase.     
 
Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of the 
treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by the review pan el (or Principal Investigator).  
 11.1.4.3 Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started) . The patient's best response assignment will 
depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

***      In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non- target lesions may be  
            accepted as disease progression.  
 
Note :  Patients with a global deterioration of  health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration”.  Every effort should be made to document the 
objective progression even after discontinua tion of treatment.

Version Date: 201 8 March 1st       32 
 
11.1.5 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR 
until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
11.1.6 Progression- Free Survival  
 
Progression- free survival (P FS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of 
progression or death, whichever occurs first.  
  
12. DATA REPO RTING / REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event lists, guidelines, and instructions for AE reporting can be found in Section 7.0 (Adverse Events: List and Reporting Requirements).  
 
12.1 Data Reporting  
 
12.1.1 Method 
 
This study will require data submission and reporting via the OnCore Database, which is the official database of the Markey Cancer Center Clinical Research and Data Management Shared Resource Facility (CRDM SRF) . Instructions for submitting data is listed in Study -Specific Data Management Plans created 
by CRDM SRF staff.  
 
12.1.2 Responsibility for Data Submission  
 
Study staff is responsible for submitting study data and/or data forms to OnCore as per the Markey Cancer Center CRDM SRF SOP’s . This trial will be monitored by the MCC Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) on a schedule determined by the Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee at the initial PRMC review . The CRDM SRF staff is responsible for compiling and submitting data for all 
participants and for providing the data to the Principal Inves tigator for review.   
 
 
13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
13.1 Experimental Design  
 
This is a randomized phase II trial of chemotherapy with or without low -dose radiation in locally advanced 
SCCHN.   
Protocol # 13-H&N -24 
Version Date: 201 8 March 1st       33 
 
 
13.2 Accrual and Power Considerations  
The primary endpoint is primary site CR rate, which in our previous study was 60% using LDFRT + 
chemotherapy . We will assume that the control arm of this trial (chemotherapy alone) will provide only a 
30% primary site CR rate . Using a binomial test of two independent proportions with 2 planned interim 
analyses (after 25% and 50% of total patient accrual) with O’Brien -Fleming stopping boundaries for futility, 
34 subjects per group are needed for this phase II based on a two -sided type I error rate of at most 10% and 
80% power . Conservative ly allowing 5% drop out or loss to follow up, we plan to enroll 72 total patients.  
All sample size calculations with corresponding interim analysis rules were conducted using PASS 11.0.32  
  
13.3 Interim Analyses  
 
Using a binomial test of two independent proportions with 2 planned interim analyses (after 25% and 50% 
of total patient accrual) with O’Brien -Fleming stopping boundaries for futility, 34 subjects per group are 
needed for this phase II based on a two -side type I error rate of at most 10% and 80% power. The O’Brien -
Fleming boundaries and alpha spending details are listed in the table and figure below.

13.5 Analysis Plan  
 
Following study completion, the percentage of subjects achieving primary site CR in each group will be 
estimated along with exact 9 0% binomial confidence intervals . A binomial test or Fisher’s exact test will 
also be employed to test for a difference in pr imary site CR rates  between treatment and control groups, with 
p-values < 0.10 considered significant.. All correlative endpoints and secondary endpoints are exploratory 

Protocol # 13-H&N -24

in nature and will be primarily descriptive; however, strategies will include safety incidence  tables, 
differences in QOL scores from baseline to completion of treatment between groups using 2- sample t -test 
or Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests depending on parametric assumptions and, and Kaplan- Meier curves for overall 
survival with corresponding lo g rank tests for comparisons between groups.  
 
13.6 Data Management  
 
All data will be stored in the OnCore  Data Management System of the Markey Cancer Center . Case report 
forms will record all study endpoints and data will be accessed in a secure manner using  this password 
protected, encrypted software. The study statistician, along with staff from the Biostatistics Shared Resource Facility (BSRF), will work closely with the study PI and the CRDM SRF staff on the development of eCRFs for the study . Instructions f or data entry will be listed in Study -Specific Data 
Management Plan created by CRDM SRF staff in conjunction with the study statistician . The OnCore 
database is housed on secure servers maintained by the Cancer Research Informatics Shared Resource Facility  (CRISRF) of Markey Cancer Center. The database is backed up daily . Data will be accessed by 
the study statistician via OnCore on a regularly scheduled basis to perform statistical programming to assess data quality control, study recruitment and to genera te interim reports and analyses. In collaboration 
with the study team, procedures and timelines will be developed for data quality control, resolution of data queries, interim reporting, and final data analysis.  
 
13.7 Reporting and Exclusions  
 
13.7.1 Evaluation of Tox icity 
 
All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment with Docetaxel, Carboplatin, and LDFRT . 
 
13.7.2 Evaluation of Response  
 All patients included in the study must be assessed for response to treatment, even if there are majo r 
protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible . Each patient will be assigned one of the following 
categories:  1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early  death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) 
unknown (not assessable, insufficient data) . [Note:  By arbitrary convention, category 9 usually designates 
the “unknown” status of any type of data in a clinical database.]  
 All of the pat ients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of those who received no 
study medication) should be included in the main analysis of the response rate . Patients in response 
categories 4 -9 should be considered to have a treatment failur e (disease progression) . Thus, an incorrect 
treatment schedule or drug administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate. Precise definitions for categories 4 -9 will be protocol specific.  
 All conclusions should be based on all eligible patients . Subanalyses may then be performed on the basis 
of a subset of patients, excluding those for whom major protocol deviations have been identified ( e.g., 
early death due to other reasons, early discontinuation of treatment, major protocol violations, etc.) . 
However, these subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis should be clearly reported. The 95% confidence intervals should a lso be provided.

APPENDIX D.  BIOASSA Y PROCEDURES  
Buccal  Swab  Procedure  
Use positively charged slides (ex. Snowcoat Leica 3800299) white with frosted end. 
1. Rinse mouth  
2. Using PurFybr cytology brushes, twirl brush against inner cheek or oropharynx as near as possible to  
radiation port, gently but firmly to dislodge cellular materials.  Save brush #. Transfer to 15 ml centrifuge  
tubes containing 2 ml ice -cold Phosphate -Buffered  Saline (PBS) solution and using sharp scissors, cut  
(just enough of) the shaft of the brush and re -cap the tube.  Refrigerate tube in preparation for transport.   
3. Scrape buccal mucosa 10 times firmly, but gently in same region, with wooden spatula  
4. Smear  the cells onto slide 1, then gently spread with slide 2  
5. Immediately spray fix with Fisher Scientific* PROTOCOL* Cytologic Fixative -  50mL (245688)1 
6. Allow slide to dry (can leave like this) and then label slides with subject ID and sample letter once slide   
has dried (i.e. “001- B”), label conical tube with same label number  
7. Place slides in slide box and transport to cc419 for pickup by Izumi lab  
8. Using a second PurFybr cytology brush, twirl brush in same region of the mouth gently but firmly to  
dislodge ce llular materials.  
9. Transfer 2nd brush to 15 ml centrifuge tubes containing 2 ml ice -cold Phosphate -Buffered Saline (PBS)  
solution and Using sharp scissors, cut (just enough of) the shaft of the brush and re -cap the tube. Keep  
tubes on ice for transport to Orren lab.  Call contact number in Orren lab, and if no answer, leave in  
refrigerator in cc419 for pickup. 
1 Coating fixatives are substitutes for wet fixatives. They are either aerosols applied by spraying the cellular samples or a liquid base,  
which is dropped onto the slide. They are composed of an alcohol base, which fixes the cells and wax like substance, which forms a thin  
protective coating over the cells e.g. Carbowax (Polyethylene Glycol) fixative. Most of these agen ts have a dual action in that they fix the  
cells and, when dry, form a thin protective coating over the smear. The coating fixative should be applied immediately on fresh sme ars.  
The distance from which the slides are sprayed 10 to 12 inches (25- 30 cm) i s the optimum distance. Prior to staining, the slides have to be  
kept for 15 minutes  in 95% alcohol for removal of the coating fixative.

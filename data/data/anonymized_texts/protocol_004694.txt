 3 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Study Title  Opaganib, a Sphingosine Kinase -2 (SK2) Inhibitor in COVID -19 Pneumonia: a 
Randomized, Double -blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase 2/3 Study, in Adult 
Subjects Hospitalized with Severe SARS -CoV -2 Positive Pneumonia  
Protocol 
Number  ABC-201  
Sponsor  RedHill Bioph arma Ltd.  
Investigational 
Product  Opaganib (ABC294640)  
Opaganib  Opaganib [3 -(4-chlorophenyl) -adamantane -1-carboxylic acid (pyridin -4-
ylmethyl)amide, hydrochloride salt] is an orally available inhibitor of the enzyme 
sphingosine kinase -2 (SK2) (French, 2010).  SK2 is an innovative molecular 
target due to its critical ro le in sphingolipid metabolism, which is known to 
regulate many cellular functions, including the replication-transcription complex 
(RTC) of +single -strand RNA viruses  
Rationale - 
Preclinical  Opaganib is an investigational product in mid-stage clinical dev elopment with 
anti-viral properties targeting RNA viruses, such as coronaviruses, by inhibiting 
viral replication, combined with anti-inflammatory effects as detailed below.  
Opaganib has been studied in pre -clinical models of RNA viral disease, 
inflammatio n and cancer (see Investigator Brochure). Recent pre-clinical studies 
have demonstrated that opaganib is a potent inhibitor of SARS -CoV -2 replication , 
at concentrations that are achievable in human serum . Inhibition of the enzyme 
sphingosine kinase -2 (SK2) with opaganib has demonstrated a decrease in viral 
titers of influenza virus in an in vitro model system (with an EC50 well within the 
achievable concentrations of opaganib in humans, based on the phase 1 human 
trial) as well as improved survival in a preclinical study of influenza infected mice receiving opaganib daily for two days. Opaganib has also demonstrated a substantial inhibitory effect in a dose dependent manner in a preliminary Ebola 
cell-based inhibition assay with near complete inhibition of Ebola cellular 
infection with the same achievable concentrations of opaganib in humans. 
Targeted knockdown of SK2 also inhibited Hepatitis C virus replication and 
substantially reduced Chikungunya Virus in infected HepG2 cells.  The pre-
clinical effect on C hikungunya Virus is particularly relevant as they also contain a 
+single stranded RNA genome like SARS -CoV -2 and other corona viruses. In 
chikungunya viral infection, SK2 has been shown to be recruited to the viral replication transcription complex by the viral Nsp3 protein, and its inhibition 
substantially reduces viral replication.  
Opaganib has also been shown to inhibit host inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo by blocking the phosphorylation of sphingosine to sphingosine -1-
phosphate (S1P), preventing the pro-inflammatory effects of S1P in a number of 
disease models as well as in a radioprotection model. Opaganib has shown a 
RedHill Biopharma Ltd Protocol ABC -201 Version 5.0 15 April 2021  
 
7 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 decrease in IL -6 levels, in TLR4 expression, NF -κB activation and TNF α-induced 
activation of NF κB pro -inflammatory cytokine/ chemokine (TNF α, IL-1β and 
CXCL -10) production; a decrease in monocyte/ macrophage and neutrophil tissue 
infiltration; blocking of CD4+ T cell infiltration and IFN γ production; abrogation 
of TNF α-induced expression of adhesion proteins and blockade of TNF α-induced 
PGE2 (as a measure of COX -2 activity).  
In an in vivo model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia, opaganib has been 
shown to reduce TNF -alpha and IL -6 concentrations in bronchioloalveolar lavage 
fluid to near non-infected control levels.  
The decision to enroll patients into this study and, in some cases, add opaganib to 
other experimental  medicines, will be at the discretion the study physician, based 
on the pharmacological action, existing data and dosage form described in this 
protocol.  Of note, in patients who ar e unable to swallow capsules, opaganib made 
into a suspension form may be administered via a nasogastric tube (administering 
opaganib suspension via nasogastric tube did not substantiall y alter the 
bioavailability of opaganib after a tube fee d in a healthy volunteer study).  
Rationale - 
Clinical Studies to Date  To date, three clinical trials have been completed with opaganib, a phase 1 food 
and administration route effect study in healthy volunteers, a phase 1b study in advanced solid tumor patients, and a phase 1b/2 study in patients with advanced 
multiple myelo ma. Two additional studies are currently in progress, a phase 2 
study in patients with cholangiocarcinoma and a phase 2 study in patients with castration -resistant prostate cancer. In May 2020 the U.S. FDA approved a Phase 
2a clinical study evaluating opag anib in patients with confirmed moderate -to-
severe SARS -CoV -2 infection.  
Based on the Phase 1b studies, the dose of 500 mg of opaganib every 12 hours was determined as the maximum safe and tolerable dose in treatment in oncology 
patients. This same dose will be utilized in the COVID -19 studies.  
Of note, the dose and duration (exposure) proposed for COVID -19 patients is 
considerably shorter than that in oncology patients, who have received opaganib daily for more than  2 years.  
A Phase 2a Proof -of-Conc ept study has just been completed in the US, 
randomizing hospitalized, hypoxic patients suffering from COVID -19 pneumonia 
to be treated with either opaganib, 500 mg Q12 hours or placebo on the same 
schedule for 14 days  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . The investigational pr oduct was given on 
top of standard of care therapy. The preliminary results demonstrated that 
opaganib as compared to placebo led to improved time to 50% reduction of 
supplemental oxygen requirement; a greater  percent age of patients no longer 
need ing suppl emental oxygen by D ay14 of treatment  and less total oxygen 
requirements during the 14 days of treatment , as measured by Area under the 
curve (AUC). Further evaluations showed a greater percent age of patients on 
opaganib no longer need ed supplemental oxygen by Day 7 and had improved 
time to discharge from hospital , compared to placebo.  In addition, there was no 
substantial safety difference between opaganib and placebo treated patients.

 Compassionate 
Use Experience  
in COVID-19 
Infection   Under an compassio nate exemption, 7 patients with severe COVID -19 infections 
were  treated with opaganib. These results are uncontrolled,  however provide 
important clinical data within the compassionate use context.  
One patient improved 36 hours after initiation of treatment  to room air and was 
discharged from hospital.  Five other patients were treated with opaganib for up to 
14 days.  All patients had clinical improvement and were discharged from 
hospital. Patients treated with opaganib in the compassionate use program did not 
progress to requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.  
Patients receiving opaganib via compassionate use were compared to a matched 
case-control group of 18 patients. Opaganib treated patients had faster 
improvement in lymphocyte counts, decrease d CRP and faster time to being 
weaned off high flow oxygen. Of the 18 matched  controls, 6/18 cases required 
intubation and mechanical ventilation.   
One patient started hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and opaganib within 24 hours and had diarrhea necessit ating withdrawal of all three medications. This 
was the only adverse event thought to be at least possibly related to opaganib.  
Standard of 
Care 
Considerations   As the approval and/or guidance for treating COVID -19 are evolving, for this 
protocol, standard of care will be defined by the recommended schemes of treatment according to the severity of the disease, taking into consideration 
regulatory approvals in one or more regions.  The proven effective therapies for 
the purpose of this protocol will be adjusted as new data emerges and will be documented in a  stand -alone document entitled Approved COVID -19 Therapies , 
and shared with study personnel.  
All other treatments will be considered experimental, pending evaluation and potential future approval. Concomitant use of standard of care, and/or 
experimental treatments in patients enrolled in this study will be guided by the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, prohibited medic ations and precautionary 
medications as outlined in the protocol and the study physician’s discretion.  
Justification for 
Opaganib, 
Population, 
Study Design, 
Primary  
Endpoint  The population to be enrolled in this study will have severe COVID -19 infection, 
be hospitalized and require supplemental oxygen to treat hypoxemia, with or 
without an increased work of breathing. Data from the recently completed Phase 
2a study in the US suggest that opaganib may  be beneficial in this population by 
reducing the need for supplemental oxygen and accelerating the time to discharge 
from the hospital.   
As the primary objective of opaganib therapy is to improve and/or stabilize the 
clinical status of the patient, the primary analysis is based on the proportion of 
patients who  no longer need supplemental oxygen by Day 14 (end of treatment) .  
This outcome will be considered a treatment success . The primary endpoint is 
consistent with achieving a score of 3 or better  (0-3, inclusive) on the WHO 
Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvem ent by Day 14 of treatment . 
The duration of treatment is 14 days, aligning with approved anti -viral treatment 
regimens for COVID -19, such as remdesivir.

Study 
Population  The study population will consist of patients diagnosed with COVID -19 infection 
that is defined as severe based on eligibility criteria to align with current WHO 
Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement level 5  (patients on a non-rebreather or 
reservoir face masks,  which are capable of delivering high concentrations of 
oxygen,  will be considered equivalent to high flow nasal cannulas) . Specifically

10 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 supplemental oxygen by high flow oxygen via nasal cannula or positive pressure 
ventilation . Patients must be hospitalized at least during screening and at Baseline 
(Day 1).  
Study Design 
and Description  This is a phase 2/3 multi -center randomized, double -blind, parallel arm, placebo - 
controlled study with an adaptive design that will utilize a futility assessment. The 
study is planned to be performed  worldwide  in approximately up to 80 clinical sites.  
After informed consent is obtained, patients will enter a screening phase for no 
more than 3 days, to determine eligibility. Approximately 464 eligible patients will 
be randomized and receive either opaganib added to standard of care, or matching 
placebo added to standard of care, in a randomization ratio of 1:1. Treatment 
assignments will remain blinded to the patient, investigator and hospital staff, as 
well as the sponsor.   
Study participants will receive either opaganib 2 x 250 mg capsules (500 mg) every 
12 hours, or matching placebo, in addition to standard of care (pharmacological as 
defined above and/or supportive) at any given institution . Study drug will be 
administered every day for 14 days (Day 1 to Day 14). All participants will be 
followed up for 42 days from  their first dose of study drug.  
Randomization  
and stratification 
Strategy  Subjects will be randomized to receive either opaganib added to standard of care, 
or matching placebo added to standard of care, in a randomization ratio of 1:1.  
As the treatments in the r ecommended schemes of treatment according to the 
severity of the di sease may differ, standard of care administered to patients may 
differ by institution.  
In order to ensure balance of standard treatment regimens in both treatment arms 
as well as with  
regard to patient risk status, randomization will be determined based upon two 
stratification factors:  
a)  Patients will be stratified on w hether SoC treatment has established efficacy (yes 
versus no). The proven effective therapies for the purpose of this protocol will be 
adjusted as new data emerges  and these updates will then be  applied to this 
stratification . 
b) Patients will be stratified based on meeting three or more high risk (out of 
possible 8)  clinical parameters for COVID -19 outcomes at baseline (yes versus no).  
 
The 8 parameters are: 1) age at screening, ≥60 years of age, (yes or no); 2) male, 
(yes or no); 3) HbA1c at screening,  ≥6.5 and/or on active treatment with insulin or 
oral hypoglycem ics (yes or no); 4) hypoxemia without commensurate increased 
work of  breathing (defined as increased respiratory rate, nasal flaring and/or 
increase use of respiratory muscles including the diaphragm [yes or no]; 5) known 
underlying chronic lung disease ( yes or no); 6) known cardiovascular disease or 
hypertension (yes or no); 7) BMI ≥ 28.0 kg/m2 (yes or no); 8) known renal disease 
(yes or no).

 Adaptive 
Interim 
Analysis for 
Futility  An unblinded futility interim analysis will be conducted when approximately 135 
subjects have had the Day 14 evaluation, in order  to determine if it would be 
futile to continue the study. The futility c riteria will be primarily based on the 
primary endpoint, and will further involve key clinical secondary endpoints  such 
that futility can only be declared if the primary AND all key secondary endpoints 
cross the futility boundary. The exact futility boundaries will be  prospectively 
determined and documented i n the final version of the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP) prior to the interim analysis.  The analysis will be conducted by an 
independent statistician reporting only to members of the data safety monitoring 
board (DSMB).  The DSMB members will be notified if the futility boundary has 
been crossed  (yes/no) and will inform the sponsor .  Strict procedures will be 
employed to maintain the confidentiality of the interim results and  will be 
documented in the SAP charter.  
Data Safety 
Monitoring Committee  The DSMB will be convened for the safety oversight of the study  in order to 
assur e safety of the trial participants.  The DSMB meetings to review the safety 
data, will be planned after 25%, 50% and 75% or when approximately 70, 135,  
230 and 3 45 randomized pati ents, respectively, have reached Day 14.  The DSMB 
will also be responsible for conveying the results of the futility analysis conducted 
by an independent unblinded statistician to the sponsor (futile/non-futile) .   
A DSMB charter will be provided as a sep arate document.   
Treatment  and 
Administration  Opaganib 500 mg Q12 hour or matching placebo  
Opaganib or placebo made into a suspension form may be administered by 
nasogastric tube . 
Study Duration  Recruitment period is estimated at 6 months . 
The maximum duration of study participation will be up to 45 days (including up 
to 3 days screening; up to 14 days of double -blind treatment and completion of 
study at Day 42) .

drugs which are substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19 CYP2D6 , CYP3A4, P -gP, BCRP and OATP1B1 should be 
avoided with opaganib.  .Please see Appendix 2.    
• Moderate or strong inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2D6 or P -gP are 
prohibited. Please see Appendix 2.  Warfarin, apixaban, argatroban and

https://www.crediblemeds.org/index.php/drugsearch  
Precautionary 
Medications 
during the 
Study  • Substrates for MATE1 and MATE2-K should be used with caution and 
monitored for safety due the potential for inhibition of this transporter 
protein. As the clinical relevance of these in -vitro interactions hasn’t been 
established, these should be decided in discussion with the Medical 
Monitor on a case -by-case basis.  
• Moderate to strong inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 may influence the 
exposure of opaganib.  
Adverse Events 
of Special 
Interest  Opaganib may cause neuropsychiatric toxicity that may be due to incre ases in 
ceramides.  
In a Phase 1 healthy volunteer food effect study, these toxicities were found to be 
reduced by eating a light to moderate meal prior to each dose administration and 
this was likely due to delayed absorption and reduced Cmax.  
Neuropsychiatric events reported in clinical studies to date include: 
hallucinations, anxiety, insomnia, lethargy, agitation, distress and dysarthria.   
These neuropsychiatric adverse events occurred at higher frequencies at the 
highest dose administered, which is a bove the dose selected ( maximum tolerated 
dose) for the current and future clinical studies.   
For further info rmation , refer to  Section 17.6.3.  
Stopping Rules  At any time during the study, participants will stop study drug if it is determined 
that they have experienced any of the following adverse events (using Grading 
criteria as defined in the revised  NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events 
[CTCAE v.5.0])  
• Any neuropsychiatric adverse event of Grade 3 severity  
• Hallucinations of any severity (any Grade)  
• Nausea of Grade 3 severity  
• Vomiting of Grade 3 severity  
• Any Grade 3 or higher event or laboratory abnormality deemed possibly, 
probably, or definitely related to study drug  
Sample Size 
Estimation  It is planned to enroll approximately 464 eligible patients into the double -blind 
treatment phase, to receive either opaganib added to standard of care (n= 232), or 
matching placebo added to standard of care (n= 232). The sample size calculation 
was based on  powering the study with respect to the primary efficacy endpoint of 
proportions of patients no longer requiring supplemental oxygen for at least 24 
hours by 14 days. It was assumed that the treatment success rate at 14 days in the 
control arm would be 40% and that opaganib is expected to provide absolute 15% 
increase of this rate, to a success rate of 55%. A total of 464 subjects provides 
RedHill Biopharma Ltd Protocol ABC -201 Version 5.0 15 April 2021  
 
18 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 90% power to detect the assumed difference in success  rate, using chi square test, 
at a two -sided α=0.05 level of signi ficance.  
Statistical 
Methods  The primary efficacy endpoint will be based on a success (Yes/No) variable, 
indicating if a subject is no longer requiring supplemental oxygen, for at least 24 
hours by study Day 14 (patient death or subsequent requirement of supplemental 
oxygen or lost to follow -up through Day 42 will be regarded as  failure for the 
primary efficacy endpoint) . Any subject reported as not requiring supplemental 
oxygen on any given study day will be counted as a subject who has not  required 
oxygen for at least 24 hours, based on the instructions to sites to enter the highest 
oxygen requirement for each study day. Subject s who are discharged from 
hospital on supplemental oxygen are expected to be followed up by the study site 
daily and will be considered a s uccess only if for any given study day, the highest 
supplemental oxygen requirement is zero. By definition, death before day 14 will 
be regarded as a failure, even if prior room air has been achieved. If a patient 
initiates a new investigational therapy on a different formal clinical protocol for 
COVID -19 within 14 days  of randomization, the patient will be followed f or true 
outcomes in the primary analysis but be censored at the time that the new therapy 
was initiated  in a sensitivity analysis . 
If a subject discontinues the study prematurely before reaching success, prior to 
Day 14, they will be counted as a failure f or the primary analysis. Sensitivity 
analysis using time to event method will be performed censoring these cases at 
the latest informative time.  
The number and percentages of subjects achieving success (as defined above) will 
be tabulated per treatment gr oup. A 95% confidence interval will be constructed 
for each proportion. A Cochran Mantel -Haenzel (CMH) test will compare the 
proportion of success between the two groups, using the study stratification factors used for randomization, and a corresponding st ratified risk difference 
estimate will be presented with 95% confidence interval.   
The significance level for this test will be two -sided 5%. The primary analysis 
will be based on the modified Intent to treat population (mITT  analysis set ) which 
consists of all patients that were randomized and treated with at least one dose of 
study drug and who met entry criteria #3 ( The patient requires, at baseline, high 
flow supplemental oxygen or positive pressure ventilation, or is receiving oxygen 
via non-rebreathe r mask or reservoir mask , capable of delivering high 
concentra tions of oxygen. Patients who requir e mechanical ventilation or no 
longer requir e supplemental oxygen prior to receiving the first dose  of study drug 
will not be included in the mITT analysis set .

 7 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
7.1 COVID-19 Disease  
COVID -19 is a newly recognized disease caused by a coronavirus virus, SARS -CoV -2.  A flu -like 
illness was first noted in December 2019, in Wuhan, China and was subsequently attributed to a virus 
similar to the SARS coronavirus, which is now designated as S ARS -CoV -2.  While the clinical 
spectrum has not yet been well defined, early reports suggest that SAR -CoV -2 infection ranges from 
asymptomatic infection to pneumonia and Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) with multiorgan failure that may lead to de ath (Zhou, 2020). In the Zhou study, the median duration of viral 
shedding was 20 days, with an interquartile range of 17- 24 days and a maximum of 37 days. Common 
symptoms reported in the Zhou study for 191 patients were fever (94%), cough (79%), sputum 
production and fatigue (each 23%) and myalgia (15%).  Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates were noted in 
75% of patients on chest X -ray. Patients over 65 years and those with significant comorbidities, such 
as diabetes, cardiac or pulmonary disease, appeared to b e more susceptible for developing severe 
infection and had a relatively higher mortality rate compared to younger, otherwise healthy patients.  
The incidence of symptomatic and severe infection, as a proportion of infected patients, is not yet 
known, as te st availability, utilizing Polymerase Chan Reaction ( PCR ) performed on nasopharyngeal 
swabs or other body fluids, has been limited.   
For most individuals testing positive, COVID -19 currently appears to be self -limiting.  The major 
threat to this viral pan demic is spread through a nonimmune population, and to those most at risk of 
severe infection. SAR -CoV -2 is highly contagious, with spread by aerosol and surface contact (van 
Doremalen, 2020) and potential fecal spread ( Chen , 2020).  As this is a newly ide ntified disease, first 
noted in December 2019, and as testing and interpretation of data are in a very early stage, no specific therapy has demonstrated antiviral efficacy.  
7.2 Investigational Product  
Opaganib [3-(4 -chlorophenyl) -adamantane -1-carboxylic acid ( pyridin-4 -ylmethyl)amide, 
hydrochloride salt] is an orally available inhibitor of the enzyme sphingosine kinase -2 (SK2) (French, 
2010).  SK2 is an innovative molecular target due to its critical role in sphingolipid metabolism, which is known to regulate m any cellular functions, including the replication-transcription complex (RTC) of 
+single -strand RNA viruses (Reid, 2015).  
7.3 Preclinical Rationale  
Recent pre -clinical studies in vitro  data demonstrate that opaganib completely inhibits viral replication 
of SARS -CoV -2, at concentrations that are achievable in human serum. . Working in collaboration 
with the University of Louisville Center for Predictive Medicine and Biodefense, opaganib was studied in a 3D tissue model of human bronchial epithelial cells (EpiAirway™, HBEC) which 
morphologically and functionally resembles the human airway and is similar to the model used to 
discover SARS -CoV -2. This study was designed to evaluate the in vi tro efficacy of opaganib in 
inhibiting SARS -CoV -2 infection and included a positive control of remdesivir, a drug with known 
antiviral activity. Results from this study showed a clear and compelling effect of opaganib resulting 
RedHill Biopharma Ltd Protocol ABC -201 Version 5.0 15 April 2021  
 
25 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 in complete inhibition of SA RS-CoV -2 viral replication (Figure 1). Treatment of cells infected with 
SARS- CoV -2 resulted in a dose -dependent inhibition of infectious virus production without 
compromising cell membrane integrity, a measure of cell viability and drug safety, demonstrati ng 
opaganib’s promising potential for treating patients with COVID -19 (Figure 2)  
 
   Figure 1.               Figure 2.  
 
 
Addition aly, preclinical studies demonstrate that opaganib both inhibits host inflammation and has 
anti-viral properties. Using SK2−/− mice and differential gene expression analysis, it was demonstrated 
that SK2/sphingosie -1-phosphate ( S1P) signaling could play a key role in promoting pneumonia via 
promoting inflammation and suppressing other factors that inhibit inflammation and host def ense 
(Ebenezer, 2019).  The results suggested that inhibition of SK2 may both inhibit viral replication and 
decrease pulmonary inflammation, ameliorating lung  injury. Additional evidence for the anti -
inflammatory properties of opaganib is derived from muri ne inflammatory bowl disease  (IBD ) models 
of ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease and rodent models of inflammatory arthritis and liver ischemia 
reperfusion.  Opaganib has been shown to suppress anti -inflammatory responses in -vitro and in-vivo, 
including:  
1) decreased IL -6 levels, TLR4 express ion, NF -κB activation and TNF α-induced activation of 
NFκB pro -inflammatory cytokine/ chemokine (TNF α, IL-1β and CXCL -10) production 
(Liu, 2010, Maines , 2008, Maines , 2010)  
2) decreased infiltration of monocytes/ macrophages and neutrophils ( Liu,  2012)  
3) blocke d CD4+ T cell infiltration and IFN γ production (Liu, 2012)  
4) abrogation of TNF α-induced expression of adhesion proteins and blockade of TNF α-
induced PGE2 as a measure of COX -2 activity (Maines, 2008).  
Several other studies have reported that SK2 regulates cellular gene expression during Chikungunya 
virus (CHIKV) infection (Reid, 2015) and can maintain viral latency for Kaposi’s sarcoma -associated 
herpesvirus (Dai, 2014). SK2 recruitment into the RTC has been demonstrated in CHIKV in the 
Togavirida e family of viruses which contains a non-segmented +single stranded RNA genome 
(COVID -19 is a +single stranded RNA genome). Treatment of infected HepG2 cells with opaganib

 significantly reduced CHIKV infection ( Reid, 2015).  Targeted knockdown of SK2 also inhibited 
hepatitis c virus ( HCV ) replication (Yamane, 2014).  
Inhibition of SK2 with opaganib has also demonstrated a decrease in viral titers of influenza virus in 
an in vitro model system (with an EC50 well within the achievable concentrations of opaganib in 
humans, based on the phase 1 human trial) a s well as  improve d survival in a preclinical study of 
influenza infected mice receiving  opaganib daily for two days (Xia , 2018).  
Opaganib has also demonstrated a substantial inhibitory effect in a dose dependent manner in a 
preliminary Ebola cell-based inhibition assay (RedHill  Biopharma,  unpublished data). The doses that 
displayed near complete inhibition of Ebola cellular infection are also achievable in humans.  
7.4 Prior Clinical Experience  
To date, four clinical trials have been completed with opaganib, a phase 1 food and administration 
route effect study in healthy volunteers, a phase 1b study in advanced solid tumor patients, a phase 
1b/2 study in patients with advanced multiple myeloma  and a Phase 2a s tudy evaluating opaganib in 
patients with moderate -to-severe SARS -CoV -2 infection. . Two additional studies are currently in 
progress, a phase 2 study in patients with cholangiocarcinoma and a phase 2 study in patients with castration -resistant prostate can cer. Based on the Phase 1b studies, described in Section 7 .4.1.1 and 
Section 7.4.1.2, based on safety and tolerability, the dose of 500 mg of opaganib every 12 hours was 
selected for future studies. The duration of treatment in oncology patients has been c onsiderably 
longer than that proposed for COVID -19 patients, with oncology patients receiving opaganib daily for 
more than  2 years.  
7.4.1 Completed Studies  
7.4.1.1 Phase 1b Study in patients with advanced solid tumors (Study No. ABC-101) 
Twenty -two patients were enrolled, of whom 21 were treated with doses from 250 mg QD through 750 
mg BID. All 21 patients were evaluable for pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety. Sixteen were evaluable for efficacy per RECIST 1.1 criteria. Patients received treatment continuously in 28 
day cycles and treatment was given  while  fasting. Mean age of patients entered was 58 years. Seventy 
one percent were male, 67% white. All patients had received prior chemotherapy and approximately 
half had prior surgery and/or radiotherapy. Patients had a variety of concomitant medical conditions 
and were receiving a variety of medications in addition to their antitumor therapy.  
The administered oral dose of 500 mg Q12 hours was the maximum tolerated dose. There were no deaths reported during the administration of opaganib. There were no discontinuations due to adverse 
events (AEs), in 250 mg QD and 250 mg bid cohorts. Common adverse events were nausea (12 
patients, 57%), fatigue (12 patients, 57%), vomiting (8 patients, 38%) and neuropsychiatric effects (14 
patients, 67%) including anxiety, insomnia, agitation and dysarthria.  Of these, only fatigue appeared 
to be dose -related.  Nausea and vomiting were common but not dose -limiting and rarely required 
discontinuation of treatment. Neuropsychiatric effects were seen at all dose levels, though were more 
common and bothersome at the highest dose level, 750 mg Q12 hours, considered an intolerable dose.    
RedHill Biopharma Ltd Protocol ABC -201 Version 5.0 15 April 2021  
 
27 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 There were no consistent trends toward increases or grade shifts in liver function tests, hematologic 
parameters, or other biochemical parameters except for creatinine and lymphocytes. No patient 
developed clinically significant ECG abnormalities on study.  There were no treatment group 
differences noted for the changes from baseline of QTcF . For more detailed data refer to Investigator 
Brochure.  
7.4.1.2 Phase 1b Study in patients with advanced multiple myeloma (Study No. ABC-
103 
Thirteen  patients received  study drug:  3 at 250 mg Q12 hours , 4 at 500 mg Q12 hours  and 6 at 750 mg 
Q12 hours .  Median age of patients was 69 years (range 57 -89), 7 were males, 7 were white and 6 
black.  All patients had received multiple courses of therapy with a median of 7 prior lines of  treatment 
(range 3 -13) excluding stem cell transplantation.  Eight patients had autologous hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation.  
The administered oral dose of 500 mg Q12 hours was the maximum tolerated dose. There were no 
deaths reported during the administration of opaganib. Common adverse events included dyspepsia, 
nausea and vomiting. Eight patients experienced neuropsychiatric effects including altered menta l 
state, confusion, dizziness, hallucinations and insomnia.  All patients experiencing neuropsychiatric 
effects were receiving concomitant narcotic analgesics and several patients were also receiving other 
psychotropic medications. In several patients, afte r adjustment of the narcotic analgesic dosing 
regimen, the symptoms subsided, with maintenance or improvement of pain control. For more detailed 
data refer to Investigator Brochure.  
7.4.1.3 Phase 1a Study  of food and administration route effect study in healthy 
volunteers (Study No, ABC-109)  
A total of 23 subjects participated in the study, 19 each received the drug orally in the fed and fasted 
states, and 21 via nasogastric ( NG) tube. Mean and median ages of the subjects were 48.2 and 50.0 
years, respectively (range 22 -72 years). Of the subjects, 56.5% were males, 78.3% were white, and 
47.8% were Hispanic. Median weight was 75.2 kg (range 52.0-123.3).  
Subjects received a single 500 mg dose of opaganib (two 250 mg capsules) after a large standard meal, 
while fasting, and via nasogastric tube. Overall, 13 subjects (56.5%) experienced at least one 
treatment -emergent event (TEAE). Of these, 9/13 and 4/13 expereienced a Grade 1 and Gr ade 2 
TEAE, respectively.  
 
Overall, the most common TEAEs were nausea (3 subjects, 13%), diarrhea (3 subjects, 13%), 
dizziness (5 subjects, 21.7%) and headache (5 subjects, 21.7%). The drug was better tolerated after 
food as compared to the fasting state,  with double the proportion of subjects experiencing TEAEs after 
fasted administration of opaganib  compared to the fed state.  
Administration with a large standard meal (fed state) resulted in prolongation of absorption, with an increase in time to maximum  concentration by one hour and a 43% decrease in peak plasma 
concentration. Overall bioavailability (AUC0 -inf) was reduced by 17% compared to fasted state. The 
change in bioavailability did not appear to affect pharmacologic activity, as S1P suppression, a

28 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 pharmacologic consequence of SK2 inhibition, was somewhat higher after administration of opaganib 
in the fed state.  
 
Administration of an opaganib suspension by nasogastric tube after tube feeding did not substantially 
alter bioavailability of the drug. Hence, subjects/patients who are unable to swallow capsules may take 
the drug in suspension form and via NG tube. For more detailed data refer to Investigator Brochure.  
7.4.1.4 A Phase 2a (Proof of Concept) Study in patients with moderate to severe COVID-
19 Pneumonia (Study No. ABC- 110) 
A Phase 2a Proof of Concept study was completed in the US evaluating 40 patients (mITT population) 
with moderate to severe COVID -19 pneumonia  (aligning with WHO Ord inal Scale of Improvement 
Scores of 4 and 5)  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . The primary endpoint was a comparison of the AUC for 
supplemental oxygen requirements  in opaganib treated vs. placebo control patients over the 14 day 
treatment period. All participants received 500 mg of investigational product Q12 hours for  14 days, 
unless they were discharged prior to 10 days, in which case they continued treatment to a total of 10 days.  The investigational product, either opaganib 500 mg Q12 hours or matching placebo, was given 
on top of standard of care therapy.  Secon dary endpoint s included several metrics for supplemental 
oxygen requirement, intubation and mortality. The study was intended as a proof of concept study and was not powered to detect a difference in the efficacy measurements.  
 
The preliminary results demonstr ated that opaganib as compared to placebo led to improved time to 
50% reduction of supplemental oxygen requirement; a greater percentage of patients no longer 
needing supplemental oxygen by Day14 of treatment and less total oxygen requirements during the 14 
days of treatment, as measured by Area under the curve (AUC). Further evaluations showed a greater 
percentage of patients on opaganib no longer needed supplemental oxygen by Day 7 and had improved 
time to discharge from hospital, compared to placebo.  
7.4.1.5 Compassionate Use Experience  
Under compassionate exemption, 7 patients with severe COVID -19 infections have been treated with 
opaganib. These results are uncontrolled however provide important clinical data within the 
compassionate use context. One p atient improved 36 hours after initiation of treatment to room air and 
was discharged from hospital.  Five other patients were treated with opaganib for up to 14 days.  All 
patients had clinical improvement and were discharged from hospital. Patients treat ed with opaganib 
in the compassionate use program did not progress to requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.  
Patients receiving opaganib via compassionate use were compared to a matched case-control group of 18 patients  (Kurd, 2020) . Opaganib treated patients had faster improvement in lymphocyte counts, 
decreased CRP and faster time to being weaned off high flow oxygen. Of the 18 match controls, 6/18 
cases required intubation and mechanical ventilation.   
 
One patient started hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and opaganib within 24 hours and had diarrhea 
necessitating withdrawal of all three medications. This was the only adverse event thought to be at 
least possibly related to opaganib.

 8 RATIONALE FOR OPAGANIB IN COVID-19  
Opagan ib has demonstrated substantial anti-viral effects for RNA viruses in pre -clinical models.  
Opaganib has demonstrated the  ability to completely inhibit SARS -CoV -2 infection in a bronchial 
epithelial in vitro  model and has suggested several aspects of clini cal benefit in the ABC -110 clinical 
trial described above.  
   
However, like all other experimental treatments at this time, opaganib has not been proven to be better 
or worse than the currently approved COVID -19 medicines. In this regard, its place among t he 
existing experimental medicines will be at the discretion the study physician, based on the 
pharmacological action described above, existing data and dosage form.  Of note, in patients who are 
unable to swallow capsules, opaganib made into a suspension form (refer to Section 12.6) may be 
administered via a nasogastric tube (administering opaganib suspension via nasogastric tube did not 
substantially alter the bioavailability of opaganib after a tube fee in a healthy volunteer study).  
The population to be  enrolled in this study will have severe COVID -19 infection, be hospitalized and 
require supplemental oxygen to treat hypoxemia, with or without an increased work of breathing. The 
effect of opaganib, as an anti -viral and anti -inflammatory medicine, if eff ective, is likely to provide the 
most measurable benefit at this clinical stage of severity.

11.3  Women of Childbearing Potential Definition  
For the purpose of this protocol, a woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP),  
i.e. fertile, following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless permanently 
sterile. Permanent sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy , bilateral tubal 
ligation  and bilateral oophorecto my. 
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical  
cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be  
used to confirm a post -menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or  
RedHill Biopharma Ltd Protocol ABC -201 Version 5.0 15 April 2021  
 
34 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 hormonal replacement therapy. However , in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH 
measurement is insufficient.  
Highly effective contraceptive measures for WOCBP include:  
a. intrauterine device  
b. vasectomized partner (provided that the male vasectomized partner is the sole sexual partner of the 
WOCBP study participant and that the vasectomized partner has obtained medical assessment of 
surgical success for the procedure)  
c. and/or sexual abstinence.  
Sexual abstinence i s considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drugs. The reliability 
of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of t he clinical trial and the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
d. If combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, 
transdermal) or progestogen-only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) , intrauterine 
hormone -releasing system associated with inhibition of ovulation is utilized then a back -up method of 
highly effective birth control is required, for example condom plus spermicide, cervical cap plus spermicide.  
Periodic abstinence (calendar , symptothermal, post ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus 
interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) are not acceptable methods .

 12 STUDY DESIGN  
12.1  Overall Investigation Plan  
This is a phase 2/ 3 multi-center randomized, double -blind, parallel arm, placebo -controlled  study, with 
an adaptive design that will utilize a futility assessment. The study is planned to be performed 
worldwide  in approximately up to 80  clinical sites .  
After informed consent is obtained, patients will enter a screening phase for no more than 3 days, to 
determine eligibility. Approximately 464 eligible patients will be randomized and receive either 
opaganib added to standard of care, or matching placebo a dded to standard of care, in a randomization 
ratio of 1:1.  Treatment assignments will remain blinded to the patient, investigator and hospital staff, as well as the sponsor.  Study participants will receive either opaganib 2 x 250 mg capsules (500 mg) eve ry 12 hours, or 
matching placebo, in addition to standard of care (pharmacological as defined above and/or 
supportive) at any given institution. Study drug will be administered every day for 14 days (Day 1 to Day 14).  
All participants will be followed up for 42 days after their first  dose of study drug.  The maximum 
duration of study participation will be up to 45 days (including up to 3 days screening; up to 14 days 
of double -blind treatment and completion of study at Day 42).  
12.2 Randomization Strategy  
Randomization will be done centrally, using pre -determined  schedule, and will assign subjects in a 1:1 
ratio to opaganib added to standard of care or matching placebo added to standard of care.  
In order to ensure balance of standard treatment regi mens in both treatment arms as well as with 
regard to patient risk status, randomization will be determined according to two stratification factors:  
a) Whether SoC treatment has established efficacy (yes versus no). The proven effective therapies  
for the pur pose of this protocol  will be adjusted as new data emerges  and will be documented 
in a stand -alone document entitled Approved COVID -19 Therapies which will be updated and 
shared with study personnel regularly.   
b) Patients will further be stratified based on meeting three  or more  high risk clinical parameters 
for COVID -19 outcomes at baseline (yes or no) . 
The parameters are: 1) age at screening, ≥60 years of age, (yes or no); 2) male, (yes or no); 3) HbA1c 
at screening,  ≥6.5 and/ or on active treatment with in sulin or oral hypoglycemics  (yes or no); 4) 
hypoxemia without commensurate increased work of  breathing (defined as increased respiratory rate, 
nasal flaring and/or increase use of respiratory muscles including the diaphragm [yes or no]; 5) known 
underlying chronic lung disease (yes or no); 6) known cardiovascular disease or hypertension (yes or 
no); 7) BMI ≥ 28.0 kg/m2 (yes or no); 8) known renal disease (yes or no).  
 
Should clinical or laboratory changes occur between screening and randomization-or between 
randomization and first dose of study drug- that affect patient eligibility, the patient should not be

 treated. In order to avoid this situation, screening, r andomization and first treatment should preferably 
be accomplished in the shortest time  interval possible.  
12.3  Study Assessments   
The assessments for this study are listed in Section  14.1 
12.4  Patient Discontinuation Criteria  
A patient may be withdrawn from the study treatment or  the study for any of the following reasons:  
• Request of the patient or patient’s representative  
• AEs or adverse device effects (ADEs) based on the judgment of the Investigator  
• The patient has experienced an AE that meets protocol defined stopping criteria (refer to 
Section 12.6.2) 
• The Investigator decides that it is in the patient’s best interest  
• The patient is noncompliant with the protocol  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Death  
If a subject is withdrawn at any time, the reason(s) will be recorded in the relevant section of the 
eCRF.  Patients  who discontinue from study treatment  and remain in the study,  will continued to be 
monitored per the Schedule of Assessments  until Day 14 and the safety follow -up phase to Day 42.   
Patients discontinued due to AEs or ADEs will be monitored until resolution or stability of the event 
based on the judgment of the investigator.

12.5.3 Storage and Handling of Investigational Drug  
Study drug should be stored at 20-25 °C (68-77° F) with excursions permitted to 30° C (86°F). 
12.6 Study Drug Administration  
Study drug will be administered with food (after a light to moderate meal) and followed by 240 mL (8 
fluid ounces) of water. If the patient can only take opaganib through a nasogastric tube, the contents of 
the capsule will be suspended in 20 cc normal sal ine solution and pushed through the nasogastric tube 
and flushed adequately with sterile water. If the patient is being tube -fed, study drug should be 
administered shortly after (approximately 15-30 minutes) a tube feed.  In cases where patient s are discha rged prior to completing their 14 days  treatment, they will continue 
to take the study drug at the same dose and schedule as an outpatient and following the same 
instruction to take each dose after a light to moderate meal.  
12.6.1 Study Drug Dose Modification Plan for Study Drug Suspected Toxicities 
Study drug may be withheld for suspected toxicities . Once suspected toxicities resolve to baseline an 
attempt may be made to re -initiate the study drug, in consultation with the Medical Monitor. Should 
the suspected to xicities re -occur, the study drug should be with drawn  permanently.

 13 PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS   
13.1.1 Standard of Care Considerations  
As the approval and/or guidance for treating COVID -19 are evolving, for the purpose of this protocol, 
standard of care will be continually redefined by the recommended schemes of treatment according to 
the severity of the disease, taking into consideration regulatory approvals in one or more regions. 
These will be documented in a  stand -alone document entitled Approved COVID -19 Therapies which 
will be updated and shared with study personnel regularly.  
 
All other treatments will be considered experimental, pending evaluation and potential future 
approval. Concomitant use of standard of care, and/or experimental treatments in patients enrolled in 
this study will be guided by the inclusion/exclusion criteria, prohibited medications and precautionary 
medications as outlined in the protocol and the study physician’s discretion.  
13.1.2 Allowed Medications  
Necessary supportive measures for optimal medical care will be given throughout the study. 
Additional care may be administered as indicated by the treating physician and patient’s medical need, and after discussion with the medical monitor.  Supportive medications that are not expected to interact 
with opaganib and are allowed  (Table 2) : 
Table 2.  Allowed Supportive Medications  
Class/Pharmacological Action  Allowed medication  
Analgesia  acetaminophen (paracetamol), naproxen, 
ibuprofen1 
Sleeping me dications/anxiolytic  lorazepam  
Anti-coagulant medications  heparin, dalteparin, enoxaparin, tinazaparin and fondaparinux, bilvalrudin  
Monoclonal antibodies  casirivimab, imdevimab, bamlanivimab, etesevimab  
Corticosteroids  dexamethasone2 
Other  baricitinib  
Antiviral remdesivir2

 1Use with caution, opaganib was a borderline inhibitor of MATE -1 in vitro  
2While interactions with opaganib are theoretically possible, the is low potential and/or an expectation that any clinical seq uelae can be 
managed  at the point -of-care.  
The drugs listed in the table above are either weak substrates or not considered substrates for enzymes 
or transporters which are inhibited or induced by opaganib.  
Supportive therapies including supplemental oxygen, plasma treatment  from convalescent patients and 
COVID -19 vaccines are allowed and not anticipated to interact with opaganib.  
13.1.3 Concomitant medications  
Concomitant medications will include all medications that started, or were continuing, during or after 
administration of the study drug. All concomitant medications and supportive therapy administered 
starting Day 1 and until the final off -study drug follow -up visit must be recorded on the appropriate 
eCRF page . 
13.1.4 Prohibited Medications  
The following medications are prohibited during the study, including the safety follow -up period:  
• Medications that are sensitive substrates and narrow therapeutic range drugs which are 
substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 CYP2D6, CYP3A4, P -gP, 
BCRP and OATP1B1 should be avoided with opaganib.  
• Moderate or strong inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2D6 or P -gP are prohibited as they 
may increase the systemic exposure (plasma concentrations) of opaganib.   
• As azithromycin carries a r isk of QTc prolongation and/or t orsades de p ointe, it should not be 
co-administered with opaganib.  
• Warfarin, apixaban, argatroban and rivaroxaban are prohibited due to drug-drug interaction 
based on CYP450 metabolism . The washout periods for these drugs:  
o Warfarin  ~ 1 week  
o Apixaban- 2.5 days  
o Argatroban- 5 hours  
o Rivaroxaban- 2 days  
13.1.5 Precautionary Medications  
• Substrates for MATE1 and MATE2-K should be used with caution and monitored for safety due the potential for inhibition of this transporter protein. As the  clinical relevance of these in -
vitro interactions hasn’t been established, these should be decided in discussion with the 
Medical Monitor on a case -by-case basis.  
Moderate to strong inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 may influence the exposure of 
opaganib.

 16 SAFETY REPORTING   
CRO will notify the sponsor of any SAE and will perform follow -up activities with the concerned site. 
The sponsor will bear responsibility of expedited and periodic reporting to the Health Authorit ies 
according to national requirements. Procedure and timelines for safety reporting are provided in the 
Safety Management Plan as agreed by CRO and the sponsor. The investigator must comply with any applicable site -specific requirements related to the rep orting of SAEs (particularly deaths and suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reactions) to the IEC/IRB that approved the study. Investigators should 
provide written documentation of IEC/IRB notification for each report to the CRO. In accordance with 
ICH GCP, CRO will inform the investigators of findings that could adversely affect the safety of participant, impact the conduct of the study, or alter the IEC’s/IRB’s approval/favourable opinion to 
continue the study, as assessed by the sponsor. In particular a nd in line with respective regulations, CRO 
will inform the investigators of suspected, unexpected, serious adverse reactions (SUSARs). The 
investigator should place copies of Safety Reports in the Investigator Site File. National regulations with 
regard t o Safety Report notifications to investigators will be taken into account. When specifically 
required by regulations and guidelines, the CRO will provide appropriate Safety Reports directly to the 
concerned lead IEC/IRB and will maintain records of these n otifications. When direct reporting is not 
clearly defined by national or site -specific regulations, the investigator will be responsible for promptly 
notifying the concerned IEC/IRB of any Safety Reports provided by the CRO and of filing copies of all related correspondence in the Investigator Site File.  
 
All adverse events should be reported to  the sponsor  on the provided data -capture forms. All serious 
adverse events should be reported within 24 hours of knowledge. If the serious adverse event results in 
a fatal or life threatening outcome, the sponsor and the medical monitor must be notified immediately.  
Complete and fax or email a Serious Adverse Event report form and provide any supporting 
documentation to the Medical Monitor . The relevant forms to be completed as well as all contact 
details, including fax number and email addresses, will be provided in a separate document.  
To discuss SAE with Medical Monitor, contact them directly by phone at the numbers provided in the 
separate document .   
Follow -up information to a serious AEs must be provided to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours of 
investigator awareness in the same manner detailed above.  
These serious adverse event reporting  timelines must be followed  in order for the sponsor  to submit 
the safety  information to the regulatory authority within the safety reporting time regulations.

 17 ADVERSE EVENTS DEFINITIONS  
The following definitions of terms are guided by the United States Code of Federal Regulations (21 
CFR 312.32(a)) and are included here.  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a 
drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  An AE (may also be referred to as an adverse experience) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational or marketed) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal 
(investigational or marketed) product and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
Adverse events will be reported from the first study drug administration . 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in any of 
the following  outcomes :   
• death;  
• is a life -threatening adverse event (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death 
at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe);  
• requires in -patient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization;  
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions;  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• is an im portant medical event.  This is defined as a medical event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or  surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.  Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or  convulsions that do not result 
in hospitalization.  
If either the sponsor or investigator believes that the event is serious, the event must be considered 
serious and be evaluated by the Sponsor for expedited reporting.  
A suspected adverse reaction  means a ny adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the adverse event.  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the specific ity or severity that has been observed.    
A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) is any (suspected) adverse reaction (any 
adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event) that is 
both serious and unexpected.  
17.1 Assessment of Casual Relationship  
The following categories and definitions for assessing the causal relationship of an event to the investigational product(s) are provided as a guide to be used for evaluating adverse events reported in 
RedHill Biopharma Ltd Protocol ABC -201 Version 5.0 15 April 2021  
 
48 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 this study to determine “suspected adverse reactions” that require expedited reported to regulatory 
agencies if they are unexpected.  In addition to the assessment below, the aggregate number of 
occurrences will be considered to decide whether the event is a reportable event and requires an IND 
safety report.  
Table 3.  Relationship of Study Medication to Adverse Events  
Unrelated  The study drug almost certainly (or certainly) did not cause the event.   
Guidelines:  
There is no reasonable temporal relationship of the event to the administration of drug;  
The pattern is inconsistent with that known for the drug; and/or  
There is another obvious etiology.  
Probably 
not related  It is more likely that the event is due to an other etiology than due to the study drug.   
Guidelines:  
There is no reasonable temporal relationship of the event to the administration of drug;  
The pattern is inconsistent with that known for the drug; and/or  
There is another more likely etiology.  
Possi bly 
related  It is approximately equally likely that the event is due to the study drug as it is due to another etiology.  
Guidelines:  
There is a reasonable temporal relationship of the event to the study drug;  
The drug seems as likely as other etiologies to have caused the effect  
Probably related  It is more likely that the event is due to the study drug than due to another etiology.   
Guidelines:
 
There is a reasonable temporal relationship of the event to the study drug;  
The event may be consistent with a known pattern of drug (or drug class) effects;  
The drug seems more likely than other etiologies to cause the effect;  
The adverse event  diminished upon cessation of study drug exposure or reduction in dose; and/or  
The adverse event worsened or recurred upon unintentional re -exposure to the study drug (Intentional 
rechallenge for the purpose of assigning causality should not be performed.)  
Definitely 
related  The evidence is compelling that the study drug caused the adverse event.   
Guidelines:  
There is a reasonable temporal relationship of the event to the study drug;  
The event is consistent with a known pattern of drug (or drug class) eff ects; 
The drug is far more likely than other etiologies to have caused the effect;  
The adverse event diminished upon cessation of study drug exposure or reduction in dose;  
The adverse event worsened or recurred upon unintentional re -exposure to the study drug (Intentional 
rechallenge for the purpose of assigning causality should not be performed.)  
 
17.2 Adverse Event  Grading  
Adverse events will be graded according to the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE version 5.0).   
RedHill Biopharma Ltd Protocol ABC -201 Version 5.0 15 April 2021  
 
49 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 If an AE is not listed in the NCI -CTCAE v.5.0, then the Physician will use the terms: mild, moderate, 
severe, life -threaten ing, or death to describe the maximum intensity of the AE. For purposes of 
consistency, these intensity grades are defined as follows:  
Table 4: Adverse Event Grade Definitions  
GRADE    
1 Mild  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
2 Moderate Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental ADL  
3 Severe  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting 
self-care ADL  
4 
 Life-threatening  Life-threatening consequences;  urgent intervention indicated 
5 Fatal  Death related to AE  
17.3 Handling of Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events classified as serious must be recorded on the AE page of the e CRF and require 
expeditious handling and reporting to the CRO Safety Surveillance, who will notify Redhill 
Biopharma in order for Redhill Biopharma to comply with regulatory requirements.  These SAEs will 
include deaths, regardless of their causal relation ship to investigational product.  All SAEs must be 
reported using the Serious Adverse Event Report form.  To the extent possible, the descriptive 
terminologies and other SAE attributes entered on the SAE report form should approximate similar 
information i n the CRF.  The completed SAE report form with supporting documentation must be 
provided to the sponsor within 24 hours of the study site personnel’s initial notification/awareness of the event.  All telephone communication regarding SAE must be followed by a written report.  Duly 
authorized study site personnel may sign completed SAE report forms; however, it is recommended 
that the investigator sign each final SAE report.  
Collection of complete information concerning SAEs is extremely important.  Thus, follow -up 
information that becomes available as the SAE evolves, as well as supporting documentation (e.g. hospital discharge summaries, additional lab and test results, autopsy reports, etc.), should be collected 
subsequently, if not available at the time o f the initial report, and immediately sent to the CRO using 
the same procedure as the initial SAE report. Information on the SAE must be in sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of causality.  
For ease of analysis, worldwide standardization, and regulatory reporting, the sponsor will code each 
reported adverse event or symptom to its corresponding preferred term and body system/organ class in 
the MedDRA dictionary version adopted for the study.  The principal investigator will be responsible 
for assessing severity based on the intensity of the event as it presented using the criteria listed in 
Section 17.2 Table 4. 
RedHill Biopharma Ltd Protocol ABC -201 Version 5.0 15 April 2021  
 
50 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 All SAE reports must be sent to the CRO, who will notify the sponsor’s medical mon itor and the 
sponsor’s regulatory/clinical affairs contact  provided in a separate document.  
As required, all investigators will be notified of all AE reports that are determined to be serious, 
unexpected, and related (by the reporting investigator or spons or) to the investigational product.  The 
notification will be in the form of a Safety Update (Dear Doctor Letter).  
The notification is considered an addendum to the current Investigator’s Brochure; therefore, upon receiving such notices, the investigator m ust review and immediately submit a copy to the IRB 
according to local regulations.  The notification must be retained within the Investigator’s Brochure.  
The investigator and IRB will determine if the informed consent requires revision.  
17.4 Pregnancy  
Pregnan cy is not an adverse event  but requires emergent reporting to the Sponsor. In case of a patient 
or patient’s partner  becoming pregnant during study participation,  the pregnancy will be followed up to 
confinement and for 6 months after delivery. Corresponding information will be filed with the  source 
documents  at the clinical site. Pregnancy should be reported in the same time period as SAE  using the 
Pregnancy Form. If there are corresponding adverse events, these should be reported as separate AEs .  
17.5 Laboratory Abnormalities  
All new abnormal laboratory findings and those abnormal at baseline which change significantly ( e.g., 
by at least one toxicity grade as defined in the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE] v5.0) are considered AEs.  Laboratory AEs for which there 
is no clinical intervention will be recorded only on the labor atory data pages of the eCRF.  Laboratory 
AEs not listed in the NCI CTCAE v5.0 will be considered as grade 1 (mild) if there is no clinical 
effect or intervention.  Laboratory values outside the normal range for certain parameters will not be 
considered AE s if they are generally not considered as indicating an abnormality; this includes such 
parameters as liver enzymes which are below the normal range.  If there is a clinical sequela or intervention, the laboratory abnormality is to be graded according to t he criteria used for clinical AEs, 
described above.

nce_8.5x11.pdf  
17.6 Other Safety Considerations  
Patients will be followed for at least 28 days after discontinuation of study medication.  When possible, 
the patient will come to the clinic for an in -person assessment.  If not possible for logistic reasons, the 
assessment may be performed by phone contact with a study coordinator.  
All AEs must be recorded and followed until resolution or for at least 28 days after discontinuation of 
study medication, whichever comes first.  
RedHill Biopharma Ltd Protocol ABC -201 Version 5.0 15 April 2021  
 
51 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 Any clinically significant changes noted during interim or final physical examinations, 
electrocardiograms, x -rays, and any other potential safety assessments, whether or not these 
procedures are required by the protocol, should also be recorded on the AE page of the e CRF . 
17.6.1 Serious Adverse Events  
A written report of all SAEs that occur after the administration of study drug and during the study 
(ending with the safety follow -up visit, 28 days  off-study drug) must be submitted to the IRB/ethics 
committee (EC) and the sponsor. SAEs/SUSARs must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours for a 
determination of expedited reporting to applicable regulatory authorities . In all SAE reports, the 
investigator will advise whether or not the SAE is judged to be related to study drug administration. 
All SAEs tha t are judged by the investigator to be at least possibly related to study drug administration 
must be reported to the sponsor regardless of how much time has elapsed since the last exposure to 
study drug. All SAEs must be submitted to the IRB/EC in an annual report per local reporting 
guidelines.  
17.6.2 Overdoses 
Overdoses should be reported as a protocol violation. If an overdose results in an AE, the  AE should 
be reported . If the overdose results in an SAE, then SAE reporting should be followed with overdose 
information entered in the narrative section. All available clinical information relevant to overdose, 
including signs and symptoms, laboratory findings, and therapeutic measures or treatments 
administered, should be summarized and discussed.  
17.6.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Opaganib may cause neuropsychiatric toxicity that may be due to increases in ceramides.  In a Phase 1 healthy volunteer food effect study, these toxicities were found to be reduced by eating a 
light to moderate meal prior to each dose administration and this was likely due to delayed absorption 
and reduced Cmax.  
Neuropsychiatric events reported in clinical studies to date include: hallucinations, anxiety, insomnia, 
lethargy, agitation, distress and dysarthria.   
These neuropsychiatric adverse events occurred at higher frequencies at the highest dose administered, 
which is above the dose selected (best tolerated dose) for the current and future clinical studies.   
The following adverse events are of special interes t. 
Patients who experience either of the following, at the discretion of the investigator, the medical 
monitor must be  notified immediately  (by phone or email) , as feasible, but no longer than 24 hours:  
• a sudden and clinically important increase in oxygen requirements  
• a rapid decline in clinical status leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation  
• clinically important increases in inflammatory markers

 17.6.4 Emergency Unblinding  
Emergency treatment code breaks should only be undertaken when it is essential to treat the participant 
safely and efficaciously. Most often, investigational treatment discontinuation and knowledge of the 
possible treatment assignments are sufficient to treat a study participant who presents with an emergency 
condition. The investigator  is encouraged to contact the medical monitor prior to code break. Emergency 
code breaks are performed using the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). When the investigator 
contacts the system to break a treatment code for a participant, they must provide the requested 
participant identifying information and confirm the necessity to break the treatment code for the 
participant. The investigator will then receive details of the investigational drug treatment for the 
specified participant via IWRS. The system will automatically inform the CRO site monitor and the 
Sponsor that the code has been broken, but no treatment assignment will be communicated.  
It is the investigator’s sole responsibility to break the treatment code in emergency situations and to 
ensur e that there is a procedure in place to allow access to the IWRS in case of emergency. The 
investigator will inform the participant how to contact their backup in cases of emergency when they 
are unavailable. The investigator will provide the protocol numb er, investigational treatment name if 
available, participant number, and instructions for contacting the local entity which has responsibility 
for emergency code breaks to the participant in case an emergency treatment code break is required at a 
time when  the investigator and backup are unavailable.  
17.6.5 Data Safety Monitoring Board  
A data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be convened for the safety oversight of the study in order 
to assur e safety of the trial participants .   
The DSMB meeting s to review  the s afety data, will be  planned after 25%, 50% and 75% or when 
approximately 70, 135, 230 and 345 randomized patients , respectively,  have reached Day 14 . 
 
Assessments will includ e but not be limited to : 
a) all adverse events   
b) all dose reductions  in study drug  
Ad hoc DSMB meetings will convene when clinically significant events  (adverse events of special 
interest Section 1 7.6.3), per physician discretion,  may indicate a potential increase in systemically 
important inflammation in any one patient in the study, ba sed on an increase d and clinically significant 
oxygen requirement , or a precipitous clinical deterioration that leads to intubation and mechanical 
ventilation.  
At each review/meeting the DSMB will determine whether the study should proceed as planned or 
should be terminated.   
No formal efficacy analysis (early stopping for efficacy) will be performed at any DSMB review . 
 
An interim analysis to determine futility will be conducted by an independent statistician and reported 
to the  DSMB.  The DSMB will also be responsible for conveying the results of the futility analysis 
conducted by an independent unblinded statistician to the sponsor (futile/non-futile).

18.1 Investigator Responsibilities  
18.1.1 Compliance with Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practices 
The study will be performed in accordance with the Declara tion of Helsinki (1964) as revised, most 
recently in Seoul (2008), US FDA regulations and the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, 
E6(R1).  The investigator will ensure that all those concerned with conducting the study (such as 
pharmacists, research nurses and co-investigators) are provided with copies of the protocol and all 
safety information prior to the start of the study.  
18.1.2 Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) Review and Approval  
The investigator is responsible for obtaining IRB/E C approval to conduct this study (including 
IRB/EC approval of the Informed Consent form) and for ensuring continuing review as required by the 
IRB/EC.  Written confirmation of this approval and periodic review must be provided to the sponsor 
prior to the start of the study and at appropriate intervals.  
18.1.3 Informed Consent  
The investigator will inform patients as to the nature, expected duration and purpose of the study, the 
administration of the study medication, and the hazards involved, as well as the potential benefits that 
may come from treatment with this investigational drug.  Informed consent must be obtained in 
accordance with US Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR Part 50), and other national regulations, if 
study is conducted at sites outside the US.    
The patient will be informed that his/her medical records will be subject to review by the sponsor and 
possibly by a representative of the Food and Drug Administration, as well as national regulatory 
authorities, for patients treated outside the US.  Su bjects will be informed that they are free to refuse 
participation in this clinical investigation, and if they should participate, it will be made clear to them 
that they may withdraw from this study at any time without prejudicing further care.  Signed wr itten 
informed consent must be obtained from every patient or legal representative prior to study entry.  The 
original will be kept by the investigator and will be subject to review by the sponsor; a copy will be 
given to the patient.  
18.1.4 Patient Anonymity  
The anonymity of participating patients must be maintained. Patients will be identified by a 
pseudonymization of patient initials  and an assigned patient number on the datasheet, and other 
documents submitted to the sponsor, including but not limited to safet y reports. Documents that will 
not be submitted to the sponsor and that identify the patient (e.g., the signed informed consent 
document), must be maintained in strict confidence by the Investigator, except to the extent necessary 
RedHill Biopharma Ltd Protocol ABC -201 Version 5.0 15 April 2021  
 
55 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 to allow auditing by the appropriate regulatory authority, the study monitor, or sponsor 
representatives.  
18.1.5 Confidentiality  
All information provided to the investigator relevant to the study medication, as well as information obtained during the course of the study, will be regarded as confidential.  The investigator and 
members of his/her research team agree not to disclose or publish such information in any way to any 
third -party without prior written permission from the sponsor, except as required by law.  
18.1.6 Source Documentation  
The investigator will allow inspections of the study site and documentation by clinical research and audit personnel from the sponsor, external auditors or representatives of regulatory authorities.   The 
purpose of these inspections is to verify and corro borate the data collected on the case report forms.  In 
order to do this direct access to the subjects’ medical or clinic records is necessary.  The investigator 
will ensure that certain information is contained in the medical or clinic records of the subj ect and that 
the entries are signed and dated, as follows:  
• sufficient data to allow verification of the entry criteria in terms of past and present medical and 
medication histories  
• a note on the day the subject entered the study describing the study number , the drug being 
evaluated, the study number assigned to that subject and a statement that consent was obtained  
• a note of each subsequent study visit including any concerns about adverse events or abnormal 
laboratory data and their resolution  
• notes of all concomitant medication taken by the subject including start and stop dates  
• a note of when the subject terminated from the study, the reason for termination and the subject’s 
general condition at termination  
• a copy of the signed informed consent form should be kept in the medical records of each subject during the clinical phase of the study (thereafter it will be archived with the study file)  
18.1.7 Drug Accountability  
The investigator agrees to supervise the maintenance of records of the receipt, dispensing and return or 
destruction of study material supplied by the sponsor.  Destruction of any material must be witnessed 
and documented in writing.  The dispensing record must make it clear which subject received which 
material.  
18.1.8 Data Monitoring and Collection  
Suitably qualified and trained clinical research personnel of the sponsor will visit the study center at 
regular intervals during the study for monitoring purposes and to assist the research staff with any 
queries they may have.  
RedHill Biopharma Ltd Protocol ABC -201 Version 5.0 15 April 2021  
 
56 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 18.1.9 Case Report Forms, Investigator’s Study File and Record Retention  
All case report forms  and supporting source documentation must be available to the sponsor during 
monitoring visits.  
Prior to review of the case report forms by the sponsor’s representative and forwarding of the case 
report forms to the sponsor, they should be reviewed for completeness and legibility by the 
investigator or a member of the research team.  
The investigator will maintain all records relating to the study (including copies of case report forms) 
for at least  2 years after written notification by the sponsor that the investigational drug program has 
been either completed or terminated, or that a New Drug Application (NDA) has been approved by the 
FDA.  Should the investigator retire, relocate, or for other rea sons withdraw from the responsibility of 
keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a person who will accept that responsibility, 
and the sponsor must be notified in writing of the name and address of said person.  
18.1.10  Non-Protocol Research  
No investigational procedures other than those outlined in this protocol may be undertaken on the 
subjects in this study without the prior written permission of the subject, the sponsor and the IRB.  
18.2 Sponsor Responsibilities  
18.2.1 General  
The sponsor agrees to adhere to US FDA Guidelines on Good Clinical (Research) Practices and with the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, E6(R1).  The sponsor has a legal responsibility to report 
fully to regulatory authorities the results of this study.  It is the sponsor ’s responsibility to obtain 
appropriate regulatory approval to perform the study.  
18.2.2 Case Report Forms  
Case report forms will be provided by the sponsor or, upon agreement with the sponsor, forms 
generated by the investigative site may be used.  If an electro nic data collection system is used, the 
system will be compliant with applicable aspects of 21 CRF Part 11, ICH guidelines, GCP and 
HIPAA.  
18.2.3 Data Monitoring and Collection  
Suitably qualified and trained clinical research personnel of the sponsor will visit t he study center at 
regular intervals during the study for monitoring purposes and to assist the research staff with any 
queries they may have. Case report forms and source documentation will be available for review 
during monitoring visits to the center.  The function of this monitoring is to ensure compliance with 
the protocol, adherence to regulatory and good clinical (research) practice obligations, proper 
maintenance of records including drug accountability records, correct administration of study 
medic ations including storage conditions and accurate reporting of adverse events.   
RedHill Biopharma Ltd Protocol ABC -201 Version 5.0 15 April 2021  
 
57 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 18.2.4 Audit  
The sponsor has an obligation to audit a proportion of studies; this is usually undertaken by a 
department other than the clinical research department.  Therefore the spo nsor, an independent auditor 
or a regulatory authority may wish to audit the study site and documentation and these audits may take 
place as the study is running or up to several years later.  
18.2.5 Confidentiality  
The sponsor will not keep any material on file bearing any subject’s name, and the subject’s 
confidentiality will be maintained at all times.  
18.2.6 Protocol Modifications  
If necessary,  during the course of the study, the protocol may be modified by the sponsor in 
consultation with the investigator.  Except in the case of modifications to resolve an imminent safety 
issue, any protocol modification or revision must be reviewed and approve d by the investigator’s 
IRB/EC prior to implementation.  
18.2.7 Publication  
RedHill Biopharma will provide unblinded data to a publications committee for publication of the 
results of this study once completed and all data have been cleaned and the blind broken.  The 
publications committee will be constituted according to the guidelines developed by the Company.  If 
deemed necessary by the Company for protection of proprietary information prior to patent filing, the 
investigator agrees to delay for 60 days before a ny presentation or publication is submitted.

 19 STATISTICAL METHODS  
This section of the protocol describes the statistical analysis as it is foreseen at the time of planning the 
study. A fully detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be produced and finalized after finalizing 
the protocol  and before breaking the blind of the study.  A supplementary document will provide 
further details regarding the planned futility analysis.  
19.1 Sample Size Considerations  
It is planned to ra ndomize approximat ely 464 eligible patients into the double -blind treatment phase, 
to receive either opaganib added to standard of care (n= 232), or matching placebo added to standard of 
care (n= 232). The sample size calculation was based on powering the study with respect t o the primary 
analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint of proportions of patients no longer requiring supplemental 
oxygen for at least 24 hours by Day 14 (refer to S ection 15.1). It was assumed that the treatment 
success rate at 14 days in the control arm would be 40% and that opaganib is expected to provide 
absolute 15% increase of this rate, to a success rate of 55%. A total of 464 subjects provides 90% 
power to detect the assumed difference in success rate, using chi square test, at a two -sided α=0.05 
level of significance. This sample size calculation takes into account a planned non-binding futility 
analysis to be performed after at least  135 patients in the study have been evaluated for the primary 
endpoint.  
19.2 Stratification  
Randomization will be done centrally, using pre -determined  schedule, and will assign subjects in a 1:1 
ratio to  opaganib added to standard of care or matching placebo added to standard of care.  
In order to ensure balance of standard treatment regimens in both treatment arms as well as with 
regard to patient risk status, randomization will be determined based upon two stratification factors:  
a) Whether SoC treatmen t has established efficacy (yes versus no) . The proven effective therapies 
for the purpose of this protocol will be adjusted as new data emerges  and will be documented 
in a stand -alone document entitled Approved COVID -19 Therapies which will be updated and 
shared with study personnel regularly.  
b) Patients will further be stratified based on meeting three or more high risk clinical parameters for COVID -19 outcomes at baseline (yes or no).  
Refer to Section  12.2 for further details.  
19.3 Populations for A nalysis  
The primary analysis will be based on the modified Intent to treat population (mITT), which consist s 
of all patients that were randomized and treated with at least one dose  of study drug and who met entry 
criteria #3 (The patient requires, prior to first dose of study drug, high flow supplemental oxygen or positive pressure ventilation, o r is receiving oxygen via a non -rebrea ther or reservoir mask , capable of 
delivering high concentra tions of oxygen. Patients who require mechanical ventilation or no longer 
RedHill Biopharma Ltd Protocol ABC -201 Version 5.0 15 April 2021  
 
59 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 require supplemental oxygen prior to receiving the first dose of study drug will not be included in the 
mITT analysis set.   
The primary analysis will also be analyzed using a Per -Protocol (PP) population that will be further 
defined in the S AP and the I ntention -to-treat (I TT) population who consists of all randomized patients.  
In all efficacy analyses, treatment group will be  assigned per randomization assignment.  
Safety analyses will be based on the safety analysis set, which consists of  all patients who received at 
least one dose of study drug and analyzed based on the actual treatment the subject received.  
19.4 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be based on a success (Yes/No) variable, indicating if a subject is 
no longer requiring supplemental oxygen,  for at least 24 hours  by study Day 14 (patient death or 
subsequent requirement of supplemental oxygen or lost to follow -up through Day 42 will be regarded 
as a failure for the primary efficacy endpoint) . Any subject reported as not requiring supplemental 
oxygen on any given study day will be counted as a subject who has not required oxy gen for at least 
24 hours, based on the instructions to sites to enter the highest oxygen requirement for each study day. 
Subjects who are discharged from hospital on supplemental oxygen are expected to be followed up by 
the study site daily and will be co nsidered a success only if for any given study day, the highest 
supplemental oxygen requirement is zero.  
 
If a patient initiates a new investigational therapy on a different formal clinical protocol for COVID -19 
within 14 days of randomization, the patient will be followed for true outcomes in the primary analysis 
but in a sensitivity analysis  the data under t he new therapy  will not be included.  
 
An e arly discontinuation of study before the subject has reached success (e.g . loss to follow up) thus 
preventing continued follow -up for success by Day 14,  will be considered as missing data and  will be 
counted as fa ilure for the primary analysis . Sensitivity analysis using time to event method will be 
performed censoring these cases at the latest informative time.  
 
The number and percentages of subjects achieving success  (as defined above) will be tabulated per 
treatment group. A 95% confidence interval will be constructed for each proportion. A Cochran 
Mantel -Haenzel (CMH) test will compare the proportion of success between the two groups, using the 
study stratification factors used for randomization, and a corresponding stratified risk difference 
estimate will be presented with 95% confidence interval.   
 
The significance level for this test will be two -sided 5%.  
 
The primary analysis will be based on the modified Intent to treat population (mITT)  as defined in 
Section 19.3.  
 Sensitivity and supportive analyses for the primary endpoint analysis will be defined and detailed in 
the statistical analysis plan. These will address at least the following aspects:  
RedHill Biopharma Ltd Protocol ABC -201 Version 5.0 15 April 2021  
 
60 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 • Negation of achieved Day 14 success by a post -day 14 failure event:  in a sensitivity analysis, 
events occurring after day 14 will not impact day 14 success.  
• Negation  of achieved  Day 14 success by any post -success failure: an analysis of endpoint 
targeting achieving any success will be performed.  
• Missing data due to early discontinuation of follow -up before achieving success  (prior to day 
14):  the primary endpoint analysis imputed these cases as Failures, however in this sensitivity 
analysis, these cases will be handled via censoring, using time to event methodology. Kaplan-
Meier method will be used to estimate cumulative incidence of success at day 14.  In this 
analysis death will be censored at 1 4 days.  
• Joining a different clinical trial prior to day 14 while patients do not withdraw consent from 
being followed up under ABC -201 protocol:  a sensitivity analysis will be performed where 
data collected during the patient participation in another clinical trial are not included . 
• A sensitivity analysis of the primary analysis using the subset of patients in the m ITT 
population regardless of meeting inclusion criteria #3 prior to first dose of study drug.  
• PP analysis: Criteria for PP protocol will be bas ed on inclusion and exclusion criteria and 
protocol violations during the study and that confound the interpretation of analyses.  Patients who do not meet PP requirement will be defined blindly before database lock.  
• To account for the possibility of error s in values of stratification factors used for 
randomization, the primary analysis will supportively be repeated using the correct values.  
• Difference between the treatment and control groups when controlling for possible imbalance in important baseline fac tors will be analysed by evaluating a multiple logistic regression 
model. The list of baseline variables will be finalized in the SAP, prior to database lock.  
• To understand the possible impact of any initiation of allowed post -randomization effective 
anti-COVID 19 SOC treatments, descriptive statistics of such usage (frequency and timing of initiation) will be presented for each group.  
• The distribution of patient’s baseline SoC regimen will be summarized and presented by group. Further, opaganib treatment effect will be assessed to confirm comparability of effect across 
these strata.  
19.5 Analysis of the Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
In general, unless otherwise specified in the SAP, binary endpoints where event of interest is of 
improvement/recovery type by a certain time frame (such as the percentage of patients with ≥2 
category improvement on the WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement by Day 14, secondary 
endpoints #1) will be defined using the following rules: a binary success variable (Yes/No) will 
indicate if the subject achieved the success of interest within specified timeframe , or not .  A recorded 
failure (within timeframe ) after success has been achieved , will be followed -up for re -achievi ng of 
success of interest  - at the target timeframe . Comparison of these endpoints between treatment groups 
will employ similar methods as those specified for the primary endpoint . In case there are subjects 
who discontinue the study before achieving success and before timeframe ending , the cumulative 
incidence probabilities at desired  time-point  will be estimated using time to event analysis, censoring 
these subjects  at last valid observation date  . In this analysis, d eath before event of interest will be 
censored at timeframe end , thus taking the highest unfavorable possible outcome for the endpoint .  
RedHill Biopharma Ltd Protocol ABC -201 Version 5.0 15 April 2021  
 
61 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 For the comparison of percent of patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation by day 42,  
this endpoint is aimed to be assessed as a binary endpoint analysis, unless there are subjects who 
discontinue the study before meeting event of interest . Otherwise, c umulative incidence probabilities 
at day 42 time-point will be estimated using time to e vent analysis, censoring these subjects at last 
valid observation date. Death prior to experiencing this progression-type of event will be handled via censoring at date of death.  As mortality is distinct secondary endpoint, this approach to handling 
death  would allow assessing the effect of opaganib specifically on this event.  Sensitivity analysis will 
estimate cumulative  incidence using the nonparametric Aalen -Johansen estimator, where death is a  
competing event.   
Time to event endpoints will be calculate d as the number of days from study day 1 until the event of 
interest or last valid observation time, whichever occurs first  (within endpoint timeframe) . A patient 
for whom event of interest will not be observed will be regarded as right censored. Unless ot herwise 
specified in the SAP, the time frame for primary analysis of these endpoints is from Day 1 until Day 
14. Time to discharge from hospital  will be using end of Day 14 of treatment  as end-of-time frame . 
When event of interest is of Improvement/Recover y type  (such as time to recovery) , death within the 
timeframe for each endpoint, will be addressed corresponding to the highest unfavorable possible outcome for the endpoint , which is censor ing at the end of time frame .  
 
Time to event endpoints will be compared using the stratified Log-rank test and the stratified Cox 
proportional hazards regression model will be used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) along with 95% 
confidence interval, comparing opaganib versus control group. Kaplan-Meier plot by treatm ent arm 
will be presented  and cumulative incidence of events of interest will be estimated along with 95% 
confidence interval for each group at several time points within timeframe.  
 
Mortality endpoint s will be defined per subject as a binary variable s indicating if a subject had died by 
target times (28 and 42)  days from first dose date. Th ese binary endpoint s will be analyzed using the 
same methods specified for the binary endpoints  above .  To note, in case of early discontinuation of 
follow -up, time to event analysis to derive the -days mortality rate will be applied, censoring such 
subjects at their last valid observation date.  
 All secondary endpoints analyses will be based on mITT population and PP population and undergo 
the same sensitivity analyses as the primary analysis , as applicable . 
19.6 Safety Analyses  
The safety and tolerability of opaganib will be determined by reported treatment emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs), physical examinations, vital signs, and laboratory tests. Patients who receive at leas t 
one dose of study drug are considered evaluable for safety (Safety population).  
Detailed specification of the safety analyses will be provided in the SAP.  
RedHill Biopharma Ltd Protocol ABC -201 Version 5.0 15 April 2021  
 
62 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 19.7 Type 1 error control  
The overall study-wise type I error will be 5%. The non-binding futility ana lysis does not increase type 
1 error probability and thus does not impact final analysis significance level (Guidance for Industry on 
Adaptive Designs for Clinical Trials of Drugs and Biologics, November 2019).  
To protect the study from type I error infla tion, the secondary efficacy endpoints will be interpreted 
inferentially only if a statistically significant treatment effect (p -value ≤0.05) is detected in the primary 
endpoint. Type I error will be further controlled by employing Hierarchical Approach wi thin the 
secondary efficacy endpoints: each endpoint will be formally analyzed only in case the previous endpoint will be statistically significant (p -value ≤0.05).  
19.8 Interim Analysis  
An unblinded futility interim analysis will be conducted when approximatel y 135 subjects have had 
the Day 14 evaluation, in order  to determine if it would be futile to continue the study. The futility 
criteria will be primarily based on the primary endpoint and will further involve key clinical secondary 
endpoints such that futi lity can only be declared if the primary AND all key secondary endpoints cross 
the boundary. The exact futility boundaries will be prospectively determined and documented in the 
final version of the SAP prior to the interim analysis  and in the DSMB charter . The analysis will be 
conducted by an independent unblinded statistician who will inform the D SMB of the futility outcome  
(futile/non -futile) . Strict procedures will be employed to maintain the confidentiality of the interim 
results. To safeguard study integrity, the pre -defined details of the stopping rules are documented 
separately from the protocol and will be documented in the SAP .

The primary objective of this study is to estimate the one-year survival of patients undergoing 
umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) after a myeloablative preparative regimen consisting of 
Regimen A: cyclophosphamide (CY), fludarabine (FLU) and fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) 
or Regimen B: cyclophosphamide (CY), fludarabine (FLU), thiotepa and fractionated total body 
irradiation (TBI).  
1.2 Secondary objectives are to estimate the:
Incidence of transplant-related mortality (TRM) at 6 months 
Incidence of neutrophil engraftment at Day 42 
Incidence of platelet engraftment at 6 months 
Incidence of disease free survival at 1 and 2 years 
Incidence of relapse at 1 and 2 years 
1.3 Exploratory objectives are to assess the:
Chimerism at multiple time points
Incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade II-IV and grade III-IV at Day 100  
Incidence of chronic GVHD at Day 100, 1 year and 2 years
Incidence of clinically significant infections at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years 
2.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONALE
Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a standard treatment option for an increasing number of 
malignant and non-malignant disorders.  To reconstitute hematopoiesis after an intensive 
myeloablative therapy, the transplantation of pluripotential hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is 
required.  Such HSCs are typically recovered from the bone marrow of related or unrelated donors 
or the bone marrow or apheresed peripheral blood of the patients themselves [1].  Unfortunately, 
suitable marrow is frequently not available [2].  Either the patient's own marrow is contaminated with 
tumor cells or potential allogeneic marrow donors are unsuitable most often on the basis of HLA 
mismatch.   Human umbilical cord blood (UCB) is an alternative source of HSCs that is capable of 
reconstituting hematopoiesis after intensive myeloablative therapy [3-10].
2.1 Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation (UBCT)
As a result of the early successes with umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) from sibling 
donors, pilot programs for the banking of unrelated donor UCB were initiated in many countries 
around the world.  Known benefits of banked UCB include: 1) rapid availability, 2) absence of donor 
risk, 3) absence of donor attrition, and 4) very low risk of transmissible infectious diseases, such as 
CMV and EBV, and 5) low risk of acute GVHD despite HLA mismatch.  UCB is particularly beneficial 
for patients of ethnic and racial minority descent for whom adult marrow and blood donors often cannot 
be identified.
2.2    UCBT Experience at the University of Minnesota
Single Unit UCBT [11].  
Between 1994 and 2001, 102 consecutive patients (median age 7.4 years) received a single, 
unrelated UCB unit after a myeloablative conditioning for malignant (n = 65; 68% high-risk)

FHCRC 2010.00
Page 4 of 37 Confidentialand non-malignant diseases (n = 37).  Median infused cell dose of UCB was 3.1 x 107 NC/kg 
(range 0.7-57.9), and 2.8 x 105 CD34+ cells/kg (range 0.4-39.1).  Fourteen percent had an 
HLA matched unit and 86% had a 1-3 HLA-match.  Neutrophil recovery occurred at a median 
of 23 Days (range 9-54) after UCBT with cumulative incidence of engraftment of 88% (95% 
CI: 81-95) by Day 42. Speed and likelihood of neutrophil recovery were strongly associated 
with cell dose, with markedly inferior engraftment (72% at a median of 34 Days) in patients 
receiving a CD34+ cell dose <1.7 x 105 cells/kg. 
The incidences of grade II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD were 39% (95% CI: 29-49) and 11% 
(95% CI: 5-17), respectively, at Day 100, with 10% (95% CI: 4-14) of patients having chronic 
GVHD at 1 year. One year transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 30% (95% CI: 21-39) 
which was strongly associated with CD34+ cell dose.  The probabilities of 1 and 2-year 
survival were 58% (95% CI: 49-70) and 47% (95% CI: 36-57), respectively.  Importantly, with 
a graft cell dose >1.7 x 105 CD34+ cells/kg, survival was 70% (95% CI: 49-90) at 1 year.
The principal conclusions of this study were: 1) an adequate cell dose (>1.7 x 105 CD34+ 
cells/kg or >2.5 x 107 nucleated cells/kg) consistently engraft; 2) GVHD is low despite HLA 
mismatch;  3) survival and risk of relapse are comparable to that observed after BMT,  and; 
4) cell dose significantly limits the applicability of UCB, particularly in adult size recipients.
Multi-Unit UCBT [12].  
Since cell dose has been clearly identified as a major limitation, often preventing the 
consideration of UCB for adult recipients, we have explored the possibility of infusing two 
partially HLA matched units to augment cell dose.  Between 2000 and 2005, we have 
increasingly utilized two UCB units rather than one, particularly in adults and adolescents 
who cannot find a suitable single UCB unit.  The underlying hypothesis of the original study 
(MT2000-15) was that the addition of the second unit would enhance the engraftment and 
the speed of hematopoietic recovery.
We have analyzed the results of the first 31 adult and adolescent patients [median age 24 
years (range: 13-53); median weight 73 kg (range: 48-120)] with high-risk hematologic 
malignancy who were transplanted with two partially HLA-matched UCB units after a 
myeloablative conditioning. Patient breakdown by diagnosis was: acute myelogenous 
leukemia (AML, n=15), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL, n=12), chronic myelogenous 
leukemia (CML, n=3) and non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (NHL, n=1). The median total infused 
dose 3.7 x 107 nucleated cells per kilogram (range 1.1-6.3) and 4.9 x 105 CD34 per kilogram 
(range, 0.9-14.5).
In this study, 100% of evaluable patients (i.e., survived for 21 Days [n=29]) engrafted at a 
median of 23 Days (range 14-41).  This compares favorably with a 65-75% incidence of 
engraftment reported for adults [9, 10].  In each case, one unit predominated.  Thus far, no 
factor (nucleated cell dose, CD34+ cell dose, HLA-match, ABO, sex, order infusion) predicts 
which unit will eventually be responsible for long term marrow recovery. The incidence of 
platelet recovery (>50,000/uL) was 73% (95% CI, 51-95) at Day 180. Incidence of grades II-
IV and III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 65% (95% CI, 42-88) and 17% 
(95% CI, 2-32) at Day 100.  Disease-free survival remains 72% at 1 year for patients 
transplanted in CR with no relapse in this cohort (median follow up: 1.2 years).
These data indicate that: 1) double unit UCBT is safe in terms of engraftment (bi-directional 
immune rejection between the units was never observed);  2) one unit always predominates 
within the first 100 Days;  3) >90% of adults will be able to identify two units that are partially 
HLA matched with the patient and each other;  4) incidence GVHD is similar to that observed 
after single UCBT; and  5) survival exceeds that of historical data with a single UCB unit.

Page 5 of 37 ConfidentialAs a result of these promising early data, we plan to extend this trial in order to 1) confirm the 
initial observations and 2) establish survival outcomes and relapse risk for individual disease 
groups.  Validation studies at other centers are in progress.
2.3 REGIMEN
This clinical trial will allow variation in preparative regimen but will have identical regimen for GVHD 
prophylaxis. The protocol-allowed conditioning regimens are: 
1. High-dose TBI + Fludarabine + cyclophosphamide
2. Middle-intensity TBI + Fludarabine + cyclophosphamide + thiotepa
The additional regimen (middle-intensity TBI + Fludarabine + cyclophosphamide + thiotepa) was 
chosen in addition to the more conventional high-dose TBI regimen that was used in our pilot study 
based on the extensive work published by Dr. Juliet Barker at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer 
Center [14].This novel regimen was originally developed as an alternative intensive conditioning 
regimen aimed at reducing the increased risk of lethal regimen-related organ toxicity that has been 
associated with the more conventional high-dose TBI-based regimen used for myeloablative CBT 
(using 13.2 Gy TBI). In fact, the known risk of end-organ toxicity with high-dose TBI has led to 
restriction of this regimen to those 45 years and younger. Although there are nonmyeloablative 
conditioning regimens that have been used in the CBT setting for those patients older than 45 years, 
nonmyeloablative conditioning itself is limited by increased risk of graft rejection and relapse in this 
setting. Thus, there is a significant need to develop a well-tolerated middle-intensity, near-
myeloablative regimen to address the limitations of the high-dose TBI and nonmyeloablative 
regimens. This is particularly true for those patients older than 45 years or younger patients with 
significant pre-existing co-morbidities precluding them from the conventional high dose TBI regimen. 
Dr. Barker published on this regimen for the first time in 2013 which presented results for 30 patients 
with acute leukemia and MDS, with the majority having acute leukemia (n=26) [14].  The median age 
was 56 years (range 18 to 69).  The overall incidence of engraftment was 97% (1 graft failure), with 
a median time to engraftment of 26 days (range, 13 to 43).
Expanding our clinical trial to allow the option of this new conditioning regimen as an alternative to 
the conventional high-dose TBI regimen, with corresponding expanded age range, brings the 
benefits of cord blood transplant to a wider cohort.  The argument for addition of this conditioning 
regimen is strongly motivated by arguments for the importance of generalizability and for the ability 
to pool results.  The use of the same primary and secondary endpoints for both conditioning 
regimens is well motivated by the study’s primary objective to estimate the one-year survival of 
patients undergoing cord blood transplantation. Furthermore, the Barker trial results reveal time to 
engraftment, overall survival and TRM are similar between the cohorts thus supporting the pooling of 
results from the two conditioning regimens.   For these reasons, the inclusion of this new middle-
intensity regimen and the inclusion of patients up to age 65 enables a clinically well motivated 
generalization of the assessment of patients undergoing cord blood transplantation.
The regimen selection for individual patients is flexible to allow for attending physician and site 
preference. There are some absolute criteria, for example, that patients between the ages of 46 and 
65 would have to go on the middle-intensity regimen. However, outside of this, the decision of which 
conditioning regimen would be based on the underlying disease, presence of MRD, age, co-
morbidities and attending preference. Furthermore, there is also a move away from high-dose TBI 
by some physicians/centers in younger patients to avoid the long-term sequelae of high-dose TBI. In 
general, it is anticipated that younger patients would continue to accrue to the high dose TBI 
regimen, especially those with minimal residual disease and the middle-intensity regimen would

      from IV to PO dosing, CSA dosing will be monitored and altered as  
      clinically appropriate.
  Initial cyclosporine dose is calculated using actual body weight except for those 
patients who are greater than 100% ideal body weight in which case calculation of   
dose using adjusted body weight is recommended.
  Patients will receive CSA until Day +100.  If there is no GVHD, the dose will be 
tapered 10% per week beginning on Day 101, to discontinue no sooner than 
6months post-transplant.
Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF)
All patients will begin mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on Day 0, starting approximately 
4 - 6 hours after infusion of the cord blood unit(s) is completed. All patients will 
receive MMF at the dose of 15 mg/kg (based on adjusted weight) every 8 hours with 
a maximum of 1 gram/dose. If actual body weight is < ideal body weight, calculation 
based on actual weight is allowed. Rounding of the dose to the nearest 250 mg 
capsule size is also allowed. 
Use IV route between days 0 and +7; then, if tolerated, may change to PO beginning 
on day +8 three times a day. 
All patients will remain on three times a day as permitted after day 7 for a minimum 
of 30 days. At day +30 or 7 days after engraftment (defined as 1st day of 2 
consecutive days of absolute neutrophil count [ANC] ≥ 0.5 x 109 /L), whichever day 
is later, if there is no evidence of acute GVHD and donor CD3 engraftment is at 
least 50% from one donor , taper MMF to BID. At day +45 (or 15 days after 
engraftment if engraftment occurred > day +30), if there continues to be no evidence 
of acute GVHD and donor engraftment has been achieved (defined as <10% host in 
CD3, CD33 and CD56), taper MMF over the next two to three weeks.   
If there is no donor engraftment, do not stop MMF. If there is no evidence of donor 
engraftment on the day +28 bone marrow biopsy, notify the PI, Ann Dahlberg 
(pager: 206-469-3102) or the research coordinator, Jenna Pedersen ((206) 667-
6013). 
6.3       Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation (UCBT)
Procedures for requesting, receiving and characterizing the cord blood unit for 
infusion will be according to institutional protocol.  
The cord blood unit should be thawed and infused per FHCRC Standard Practice 
Manual. Cord blood products should be infused without delay as soon as the 
product arrives on the unit.  
The thawed product (either one or two units) will be delivered to the patient           
floor/bedside where the product is double-checked by a nurse with the
technologist from the Cellular Therapy Laboratory. Visual inspection of the 
product is also made at this time. The unit(s) is verified according to 1) the 
infusion order sheets, 2) the patient’s identification number on the cell product, 
3) the product (cell) identification number and 4) the patient wrist band. 
If the cord blood unit(s) fails to pass inspection or if there is insufficient 
              information to verify the cell product for the patient, notify
the Cell Therapy Lab ((206) 606-1200) and the PI, Ann Dahlberg ((206) 667-
1959, pager (206) 469-3102) immediately.
The goal infusion time of each cord blood unit is 30 minutes, as clinically 
possible. Pre-medications (if any) prior to cord blood infusion will be at the

Page 12 of 37 Confidentialdiscretion of the attending. Under no circumstances is the cord blood to be 
irradiated. No medications or fluids should be given piggyback through the 
catheter lumen that is being used for cord blood infusion. 
The product is infused via IV drip directly into the central line without a needle 
or pump.
Vital signs should be monitored before beginning the infusion and periodically 
                        during administration. Notify the attending physician, fellow or PA immediately
                        if the patient exhibits signs or symptoms of a reaction. 
Benadryl, epinephrine, and hydrocortisone should be available at the bedside 
for emergency use if necessary. Oxygen with nasal prongs for standby use 
should be present in the room.
If the patient is a double cord blood recipient, the two units may be given 
sequentially with no wait between infusion of the units. However, infusion of the 
second unit will not begin until any acute toxicities from the first unit have been 
controlled. The start and stop time of each unit should be recorded on the 
infusion record. 
6.4 Growth Factor 
All patients will receive G-CSF 5 mcg/kg/day IV (pediatric patients) or SC (adult patients) (dose 
rounded to vial size) based on the actual body weight IV beginning on Day +1 after UCB infusion.  
G-CSF will be administered daily until the ANC exceeds 2.5 x 109/L for three consecutive days and 
then discontinued.  If the ANC decreases to <1.0 x 109/L, G-CSF will be reinstituted and titrated to 
maintain an ANC >1.0 x 109/L.
6.5 Supportive Care
Patients will receive transfusions, infection prophylaxis (bacterial, fungal, CMV), and other therapy 
(including GVHD) according to institutional guidelines (at FHCRC this is the FHCRC Standard 
Practice Manual). FHCRC infection guidelines are provided to outside centers as recommendations.
6.6 Management of Pre-engraftment Immune Reactions 
A well-recognized clinical entity consisting of skin rash, fever, and, often, loose stools and 
respiratory distress has been noted to occur prior to engraftment among cord blood patients, 
generally between Days +7 and +21.  This clinical syndrome likely involves cytokine activation, and 
though clinically similar to acute or hyperacute graft versus host disease, it appears to be a distinct 
entity, “pre-engraftment syndrome.”   This syndrome is often controlled with brief steroid bursts, thus 
avoiding a commitment to extended steroid exposure. Patients should be monitored carefully for this 
syndrome.
If patients have moderate to severe symptoms as described above and alternative etiologies (i.e., 
infection) have been excluded or are being appropriately evaluated, recommendations for 
management are:
1. For patients not on steroid therapy when the syndrome occurs:  methylprednisolone 
should be given at 1 mg/kg IV q day for three days.  If symptoms have abated, 
steroids should be stopped.  If symptoms persist, 1 mg/kg can be continued through 
six days then stopped if symptoms have abated.  If symptoms persist for more than 
six days, the patient should be considered to have acute/hyperacute GVHD and 
should be treated with prolonged steroids as deemed appropriate.
2. For patients already on steroids for other reasons when the syndrome occurs:  
methylprednisolone should be given at a dose of 3-5 mg/kg IV (max dose 500 mg) q

7.4 UCB Engraftment Evaluation
Chimerism studies will be performed on the bone marrow on Days 28, 80 and 1 year. Subsequently, 
if the patient's peripheral blood counts drop after an initial recovery, the peripheral blood and bone 
marrow should again be evaluated unless a cause has been determined (e.g., use of Ganciclovir for 
treatment of CMV).  Patients diagnosed with graft failure as defined in section 10.2 must be reported 
to the Principal Investigator (Ann Dahlberg, 206-667-1959/pgr 206-469-3102).
7.5 GVHD Evaluation
GVHD assessment, done as part of routine care, will be reviewed once weekly through Day 100.

8.   Guidelines for Serious Adverse Event Reporting
8.1 Monitoring the Progress of Trial and the Safety of Participants
This is a Phase 2 clinical trial that is monitored by the principal investigator (PI), Ann Dahlberg, M.D.  
For FHCRC patients, the PI reviews the outcome of the data for each individual patient on an 
ongoing basis. The PI of the study will have primary responsibility for ensuring that the protocol is 
conducted as approved by the Scientific Review Committee and Institutional Review Board. The PI 
will ensure that the monitoring plan is followed, that all data required for oversight of monitoring are 
accurately reported to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee, that all adverse events are 
reported according to the protocol guidelines, and that any adverse reactions reflecting patient 
safety concerns are appropriately reported. The PI will personally review with the Research Nurse 
the clinical course of all the enrolled patients at least twice monthly. 
Until October 2018, this was a multi-institution trial with FHCRC serving as the Coordinating Center.  
In this capacity, the PI obtained copies of all IRB approvals and had the responsibility for receiving 
the information required for adverse event reporting and safety monitoring and disseminating that 
Fred Hutch IRB
Approved 
2/14/2024
FHCRC 2010.00
Page 18 of 37 Confidentialinformation to the appropriate Consortium committees. Written agreements were obtained from all 
participating sites acknowledging their responsibilities for data and adverse event reporting and 
agreement to provide records, files, case report forms or any other documents needed to verify 
compliance.  The PI reviewed outcome data for each individual patient at a minimum of 3 months 
after UCBT.  Clinical outcome data were summarized and transmitted from collaborating centers as 
case report forms (CRFs). When possible, primary source documents regarding patient outcomes 
were collected from the collaborating centers. The CRFs were generated from the collaborating 
centers at defined time points (day 28, day 100, day 180, 1 year and 2 years post-transplant). The 
local PI reviewed the official CRF and primary source documents. When the CRFs were verified, the 
data were entered into a central database managed by the FHCRC Coordinating Center. 
8.2. Reporting of Adverse Events
Adverse Event Definitions
Adverse Event
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a medicinal product; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
study drug administration or usage. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal 
product.
Serious Adverse Event 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an untoward medical occurrence that results in any of 
the following outcomes:
• Death
• Life-threatening situation (i.e., with an immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred but
  not including an event that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused death).
• In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. Inpatient hospitalization       
  comprises formal admission to a hospital for medical reasons, for any length of time, whether or 
  not hospitalization extends overnight. However, hospital admissions for administration of the
  study drug, procedures required by the study protocol, or tumor-related diagnostic procedures
  are not considered serious. Hospitalizations commonly associated with transplant including, but
  not limited, to febrile neutropenia, fevers, infections, and gastrointestinal toxicities will not be
  recorded as serious adverse events as the majority of patients receiving transplants are 
  hospitalized. 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct
  normal life functions.
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect.
• An important medical event that requires intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes.
Unexpected Adverse Event
An unexpected adverse event is defined as an event that has a nature or severity, or frequency that 
is not consistent with the applicable investigator brochure.  “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, 
refers to an adverse drug experience that has not been previously observed and reported rather 
than an experience that has not been anticipated based on the pharmacological properties of the 
study drug.
Fred Hutch IRB
Approved 
2/14/2024
FHCRC 2010.00
Page 19 of 37 ConfidentialRecording an Adverse Event and Grading of the Severity of an Adverse Event
Adverse events will be collected and graded according to the modified (for HSCT) NCI Common 
Toxicity Criteria (Appendix VI). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (or highly unusual grade 2 adverse 
events), which occur from the start of study treatment (pre-transplant conditioning) through Day 
+100 post-transplant will be collected on the Case Report Form (CRF). These adverse events, which 
are observed by the Investigator or reported by the patient, whether or not attributed to the study, 
will be reported on the CRF. Attributes will include a description, date of onset, maximum severity, 
and assessment of relationship to the study agent or other suspect agent(s).
Adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE version 3.0 (Appendix VI). Association or 
relatedness to the study agent will be graded as follows: 1 = unrelated, 2 = unlikely, 3 = possibly 
related, 4 = probably related, and 5 = definitely related.
If a patient experiences relapse or graft failure and goes on to further treatment off protocol, adverse 
events will no longer be collected with the exception of death. The adverse event reporting in this 
clinical trial will comply with current FHCRC reporting policy (see Appendix VII). For patients being 
cared for at the FHCRC, health care providers communicate with the PI, trial coordinator or research 
nurses as events occur triggering subsequent reporting. Toxicities meeting the study stopping rule 
criteria will be reported to the IRB within 10 days of study staff awareness. All other SAEs and 
deaths, not meeting the expedited reporting criteria, will be reported to the IRB as part of the annual 
continuation review report to the IRB. For the purpose of this study, hospitalizations for 
protocol-scheduled procedures, blood product transfusions, or for social reasons (i.e., 
awaiting transport home) will not be considered serious adverse events. Hospitalization will 
be considered a serious adverse event if it is unexpected or the duration of the hospital stay 
is unexpected.
Refer to Appendix III for a list of potential adverse events associated or expected with hematopoietic 
cell transplantation. PI and the research study team have fulfilled all NIH requirements for training in 
human subjects protection.   
8.3. Plans for assuring data accuracy and protocol compliance
For study enrollment, a signed consent form and eligibility checklist with source documents must 
demonstrate study eligibility. Fred Hutch Cord Blood Program research staff review CRFs for 
adherence to the protocol, accuracy, and completeness. The study is monitored under the FHCRC 
Monitoring Plan. The FHCRC Data and Safety Monitoring Plan details the full scope and extent of 
monitoring and provides for immediate action in the event of the discovery of major deviations.  
8.4. Oversight and Review of Safety Monitoring
An annual review of the progress of the study with respect to the monitoring plan will be performed 
by a Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). As part of the annual renewal process, the PI 
will submit an accounting of patient enrollment and outcomes defining the monitoring plan in 
sufficient detail as to permit verification of the report through chart audit. The IRB provides a final 
level of annual review. Approval by the DSMC is a necessary but not sufficient condition for final 
approval by the IRB. The IRB will review the same continuation application and materials that are 
reviewed by the DSMC, and make an independent assessment of the progress of the trial and 
determine whether the perceived risk-benefit ratio continues to be acceptable.

10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Objectives
Primary objective
The principal aim of this study is to estimate one-year overall survival of UCBT after a 
myeloablative preparative regimen for the combined experience of single unit UCB 
transplants and double unit UCB transplants.
Secondary objectives
 Transplant related mortality at 6 months
 Chimerism at multiple time points
 Neutrophil engraftment at Day 42
 Platelet recovery at 6 months
  Acute GvHD
 Chronic GvHD
 Clinically significant infections at multiple time points
 Relapse at one and two years 
 Progression-free survival at one and two years
 Comparison of single unit UCB transplants with historical controls
  Comparison of single unit UCB transplants with double unit UCB transplants
10.2 Statistical Analysis
The primary objective of this study is to gain experience with both double- and single-unit UCBT’s 
and to estimate the one-year overall survival among patients treated on this study.  A non-statistical 
comparison with historical controls will be made for the endpoints survival and progression-free 
survival, and the doubles and singles will be assessed separately for these purposes.  In addition, 
we have added a middle-intensity conditioning regimen as described above, this allowing for 
inclusion of patients > 45 years of age.  In addition to assessing results by double vs. single, results 
will also be examined according to conditioning intensity.  Historically, the survival at two years for 
single-unit UCBT’s has ranged from 26-74% [13].  At FHCRC, patients transplanted for CML, acute 
leukemia, or MDS from an unrelated donor and matched for 10 of 10 alleles have an estimated 2-
year survival of 57%; those matched for 9/10 alleles have an estimated 2-year survival of 49%, and 
those matched for 8/10 alleles have an estimated 2-year survival of 46%.  Based on the numbers, 
we shall use 50% survival at 1 year as the rough benchmark for the current study.  We plan to enroll 
135 patients, and we expect that approximately 2/3 of these will be double-unit UCBT’s.  The first 75 
patients (or so) received the high-intensity regimen, and we expect the remaining 60 to be 
distributed equally between the high-dose and middle-intensity regimens.  This would result in 
roughly 105 high-dose and 30 middle-intensity patients, and approximately 90 double-cord recipients 
and 45 single-cord recipients.  Combining each of these, we expect approximately 70 patients to

receive middle-dose TBI and a double cord, and 10 to receive middle-dose TBI and a single cord.  If 
the observed 1-year survival for a particular arm is at least 10 percentage points better than the 
historical benchmark, that arm will be considered to be worthy of further study.  The table below 
shows the probability of observing a 1-year survival that is at least 10 percentage points higher than 
the benchmark of 50%.  The table contains various sample sizes and various assumed-true 1-year 
survival rates (the varying sample sizes correspond to the expected numbers based on distributions 
conditioning and number of cords).

Graft failure by Day 42 and transplant-related mortality by day 100 will be carefully monitored 
throughout the study, and if reasonable evidence exists suggesting that failure for either of these 
endpoints is excessive, the study will be stopped.  Monitoring will take place separately for the single 
and double UCBT cohorts.  Patients will be considered primary graft failure/rejections provided they 
meet any criteria listed below:
i. Absence of 3 consecutive days with neutrophils ≥500/ul  combined with host CD3 
peripheral blood chimerism ≥ 50% at day 42
ii. Absence of 3 consecutive days with neutrophils ≥500/ul under any circumstances 
at day 55
iii. Death after day 28 with neutrophil count <100/ul without any evidence of 
engraftment (< 5% donor CD3)
iv. Primary autologous count recovery with < 5% donor CD3 peripheral blood 
chimerism at count recovery and without relapse
A true graft failure rate of 15% will be considered excessive, and a true Day 100 TRM rate of 20% 
will be considered excessive, and reasonable evidence will be taken to be a ratio of failures to 
patients treated with a lower limit to the corresponding 80% confidence interval in excess of these 
rates.  These ratios will be assessed after every 5th enrolled patient becomes evaluable and will be 
assessed separately between the four conditioning/cord-number groups.  
Operationally, the stopping limits will be met if any of the following ratios occur:
Graft Failure: 2/5, 3/10, 4/15, 5/20, 6/25, 7/30, 8/35, 9/40, 10/45, 11/50, 11/55, 12/60, 13/65, 
14/70
TRM: 3/5, 4/10, 5/15, 6/20, 8/25, 9/30, 10/35, 11/40, 12/45, 13/50, 14/55, 16/60, 17/65, 18/70
If the true probability of graft failure is 5%, then the probability of stopping the study after 20, 40, or 
60 patients is approximately 0.03, 0.03, and 0.03, respectively.  If the true probability is 25%, these 
stopping probabilities are approximately 0.70, 0.84, and 0.91, respectively.  (It is not expected that 
60 patients will be enrolled in either arm, but theoretically it is possible.)  If the true probability of 
TRM is 15%, then the probability of stopping after 20, 40, or 60 patients is 0.11, 0.12, and 0.13, 
respectively, while a true probability of 30% leads to stopping probabilities of 0.66, 0.81, and 0.89.  
Secondary endpoints listed in Section 10.1 will also be evaluated.  Cumulative incidence estimates 
will be used to summarize the time-to-event outcomes.

Page 22 of 37 ConfidentialWe anticipate that the data from this study will be useful in the design of future studies, these future 
studies hopefully culminating in a Phase III trial comparing UCBT to some other alternative source of 
stem cells.  If the data from this trial suggest favorable outcomes as detailed above, then the 
appropriate groups will be considered for potential inclusion on the clinical trial(s) as appropriate.
10.3 Gender and Ethnicity Statement
This study is open to both males and females and to all racial/ethnic groups. The patient enrollment 
pattern is expected to be similar to that of other hematological malignancy studies. It is not 
anticipated that the outcome will be affected by either race or gender.  The study will not have 
separate accrual targets for different subgroups.

Potential Adverse Events Associated or Expected with Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation
1. Graft versus host disease:  GVHD is a major toxicity associated with the infusion of allogeneic donor 
stem cells.  GVHD may be acute or chronic and may affect multiple organ systems, including the skin, liver, 
and GI tract.
2. Opportunistic infections, including viral and fungal infections, can results in severe pulmonary, neurologic, 
hepatic and other organ dysfunction, and possible death.
3. Gastrointestinal toxicity. Nausea and vomiting can be anticipated during the entire course of ablative 
therapy. Mucositis and diarrhea should be expected. Prednisone can cause GI bleeding.
4. Cardiac toxicity. Cardiac toxicity (congestive heart failure, pericardial effusion, EKG changes) is 
uncommonly associated with the chemotherapy agents and TBI used in the regimen and these sequelae 
may prove lethal.
5. Pulmonary toxicity. Diffuse interstitial pneumonitis of unknown etiology occurs with some regularity after 
BMT and interstitial fibrosis occurs much more rarely. Both are well-described complications of intensive 
chemotherapy and TBI regimens and may prove lethal.
6. Hepatic toxicity. Veno-occlusive disease of the liver is a common toxicity of high-dose chemoradiotherapy 
and may result in death. Cyclosporine may cause elevation of ALT/AST.
7. Renal dysfunction. Chemoradiotherapy may uncommonly cause renal dysfunction. More commonly, 
nephrotoxicity results from cyclosporine and generally responds to dose reduction. Rarely, idiopathic or 
calcineurin inhibitor-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome may occur and may be progressive and fatal. A 
syndrome of moderate renal insufficiency and hemolysis has been seen 5-7 months post HSCT after 
intensive multi-agent conditioning plus TBI.
8. Hemorrhagic cystitis, manifested either as gross or microscopic hematuria, is a common toxicity after 
high-dose chemoradiotherapy, but usually associated with regimens that include cyclophosphamide. 
Hemorrhagic cystitis may predispose to a long-term increased risk of bladder cancer.
9. Central nervous system toxicity. Radiation and chemotherapy can cause CNS toxicity, including seizures, 
depressed mental status, or leukoencephalopathy. Calcineurin inhibitors can cause seizures or other CNS 
toxicity.
10. Marrow aplasia. Severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, is expected to occur for a period 
of 7 to 42 days following infusion of marrow. Transfusion of platelets and red blood cells is expected as 
supportive care. Transfusion of blood products may be associated with acquisition of HIV or a hepatitis 
virus. Neutropenia may increase the risk for acquiring serious infection. Thrombocytopenia may increase 
the risk of life-threatening hemorrhage. Hemorrhagic or infectious complications during the expected period 
of aplasia may result in death.
11. Miscellaneous. Alopecia and sterility are expected complications of the program as a whole. Cataract 
development is possible after TBI and/or steroids. Deficiencies of growth hormone, thyroid hormone, and 
sex hormones are possible after TBI. Calcineurin inhibitors can cause transient gingival hyperplasia, tremor, 
seizure, hypertension, headache, dysesthesia and hirsutism. Steroid therapy can also contribute to fluid 
retention, easy bruising, hypertension, aseptic necrosis of bone and increased susceptibility to infection.

Umbilical Cord Blood Graft Selection 
CB donor selection will be based on institutional guidelines and in general should be selected to optimize 
both HLA match and cell dose. Additionally, CB grafts shall consist of one or two CB donors based on, but 
not exclusively determined by, cell dose (TNC/kg and CD34/kg), HLA matching and disease status and 
indication for transplant. Attending preference will be allowed for single versus double unit as well as the 
degree of mismatching based on patient specific factors, as long as the following minimum criteria are met:
A.HLA matching:
i. Minimum requirement: The CB graft(s) must be matched at a minimum at 4/6 HLA-A, B, 
DRB1 loci with the recipient. Therefore 0-2 mismatches at the A or B or DRB1 loci based on 
intermediate resolution A, B antigen and DRB1 allele typing for determination of HLA-match 
is allowed. 
ii. HLA-matching determined by high resolution typing is allowed per institutional guidelines as 
long as the minimum criteria (#A.i., above) are met. 
B.Selection of two CB units is mandatory when a single cord blood unit does not meet the following 
criteria in the table below.  
Single Unit Allowed for:
Match 
GradeTNC Dose
6/6 ≥ 2.5 x 107/kg
5/6, 4/6 ≥ 4.0 (± 0.5) x 107/kg
If two CB units are used, the total cell dose of the combined units must be at least 3.0 x 107 TNC 
per kilogram recipient weight based on pre-cryopreservation numbers, with each CB unit 
containing a MINIMUM of 1.5 x 107 TNC/kg. 
C.The minimum recommended CD34/kg cell dose should be 2 x 105 CD34/kg, total dose from a 
single or combined double. 
D.The unmanipulated CB unit(s) will be FDA licensed or will be obtained under a separate IND, such 
as the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) Protocol 10-CBA conducted under BB IND-7555 
or another IND sponsored by (1) a participating institution or (2) an investigator at FHCRC or one 
of the participating institutions. 
E.FHCRC only: Up to 5% of the unmanipulated cord blood product (s), when ready for infusion, may 
be withheld for research purposes as long as thresholds for infused TNC dose are met.  These 
products will be used to conduct studies involving the kinetics of engraftment and immunobiology 
of double cord transplantation.
  
UCB Unit Exclusions
1. Any cord blood units with <1.5 x 107 total nucleated cells per kilogram recipient weight.
2. Any cord blood units without full maternal testing and negative results for hepatitis B, C, HIV, and HTLV-1 
viruses. Any additional available virology results on the unit itself will be reviewed but are not mandated, 
complete or always available. Cord blood units are presumed to be CMV negative regardless of serologic 
testing due to passive transmission of maternal CMV antibodies.

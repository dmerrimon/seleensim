treatment of adults with heterozygous fami lial hypercholesterolemia  (HeFH) who require 
additional lowering of low-density li poprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) 
OBJECTIVES: 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of obicetrapib on fasting LDL-C levels 
at Day 84. The secondary objectives of this study include the following: 
 To evaluate the effect of obicetrapib on fas ting apolipoprotein B (ApoB), non-high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C ), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total 
cholesterol (TC), and triglycerid es (TG) at Days 84, 180, and 365; 
 To evaluate the effect of obicetrapib on fasting LDL-C le vels at Days 180 and 365; 
 To evaluate the effect  of obicetrapib on fastin g lipoprotein (a) (Lp[a]) at Days 84 and 365; and 
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of obicetra pib in a representative population o
f 
adult males and females with HeFH, assessed by adverse events (AEs), events of special 
interest (ESIs), vital signs (including blood pressure), elec trocardiogram (ECG) 
measurements, and clinic al laboratory values. 
The exploratory objectives of this  study include the following: 
 To evaluate the effect of  obicetrapib on the following: 
o Number of participants reaching prespeci fied fasting LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and ApoB 
levels at Days 84 and 365; and 
o Fasting apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) at Days 84 and 365.

Version 3.0, 18 May 2022 POPULATION: 
The population for this st udy will comprise participants with  a history of He FH who are not 
adequately controlled by their maximally tolerated lipid-modifyi ng therapy. At least 70% of the 
participants enrolled into this study must be taking high-intensity sta tins (HISs). HISs include 
atorvastatin 40 or 80 mg or rosuvastatin 20 or 40 mg. Participants with a history of HeFH, defined 
by existing confirmation via genetic testing, Worl d Health Organization (WHO) Criteria/Dutch 
Lipid Clinical Network Criteria with a score of >8 points, an d/or Simon Broome Register 
Diagnostic Criteria, will be enrolled. The study a ims to enroll male and female participants 
18 years of age. 
STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION: 
This study will be a multisite, placebo-cont rolled, double-blind, randomized, Phase 3 study in 
approximately 300 participants with a history of HeFH who are not adequately controlled by their 
lipid-modifying therapy to evaluate the efficacy, sa fety, and tolerability of  obicetrapib. Informed 
consent will be obtained from partic ipants before the initiation of  any study-specific procedures. 
Approximately 300 eligible participants will be  randomized in a 2:1 ra tio, respectively, to the 
following treatment groups: 
 Obicetrapib group: One 10 mg obice trapib tablet once daily; or 
 Placebo group: 1 placebo tablet once daily. 
At least 70% of the participants  enrolled into this study must be taking HISs. HeFH diagnosis is 
defined by existing confirmation vi a genetic testing, WHO Criteria/ Dutch Lipid Clinical Network 
Criteria with a score of >8 points, and/or Simon Broome Register Diagnostic  Criteria. Starting on 
Day 1, each participant will self -administer their assigned study drug once daily until Day 365. 
During the Treatment Period, partic ipants will return to the st udy site for efficacy and safety 
assessments. An End of Study (EOS) Visit will be conducted approximately 35 days after the 
participant’s last dose of st udy drug, during which vital si gns; limited serum chemistry, 
hematology, and coagulation pa rameters; pharmacokine tics; concomitant medications; and AEs 
will be assessed. 
The study will be governed by a Steering Committ ee, and a Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
will provide independent oversight of participant safety. The responsibilities, procedures, and workflow fo r these committees will be  defined in separate 
charters outside of the protocol.

STATISTICAL ANALYSES: 
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized before database lock. Any changes to the 
methods described in the SAP will be described and justified as needed in the final Clinical Study 
Report. All study-collected data will be summ arized by treatment group using descriptive 
statistics, graphs, and/or raw data listings. De scriptive statistic s for continuous variables will 
include number of participants , mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum 
values. Analyses of categorical variable s will include frequency and percentage. 
Unless otherwise stated, Baseline values will be the last non-missing measur ements taken prior to 
the participant receiving study drug. 
Analysis populations 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population will include all participants who are randomized into the 
study. Treatment classification will be based on the randomized treatment. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will include all part icipants who are randomized into the study, take 
any study drug, and have at least 1 post-treatment lipid data assessment. Treatment classification 
will be based on the randomized treatment. The Modified ITT (mITT) Population will include a ll randomized participants who receive at least 
1 dose of any study drug and have data for bo th the Day 1 and Day 84 LDL-C assessments. 
Treatment classification will be based on the randomized treatment. The Per-Protocol (PP) Population will include all participants in  the mITT Population who did not 
experience a major protocol deviation that potent ially impacted the primary efficacy endpoint. The 
PP Population, along with the reason for exclusio n, will be finalized prior to study unblinding. 
The Safety Population will include all participan ts who receive at least 1 dose of any study drug. 
Treatment classification will be based on the actual  treatment received. The Safety Population will 
be the primary population used  for the safety analyses.

Version 3.0, 18 May 2022 Efficacy analysis 
The ITT Population will be the primary population fo r the efficacy analysis. Efficacy will also be 
analyzed using the FAS, mITT Population, and PP Population as supportive analyses. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change from Baseline to Day 84 in fasting LDL-C in 
the obicetrapib group compared to the placebo group. The primary endpoint will be analyzed using 
an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model w ith a fixed effect for the treatment group and 
covariate of Baseline LDL-C. The least squares (LS) mean, standard errors, and 2-sided 
95% confidence intervals for each treatment gr oup and for the mean di fference compared to 
placebo will be obtained. Model diagnostics for the ANCOVA mode l will be computed that 
include assessments for homogeneity of variance, nor mality of the residuals, and residual outliers. 
If substantial deviations from th e model assumptions are observed, then supportive analyses, such 
as an ANCOVA model assuming unequal variances  or non-parametric assessments, will be 
considered. 
The primary estimand will correspond to a treatment policy estimand. The target population will 
comprise participants who are randomized into the study. The primary summa ry measure to access 
the treatment effect will be th e LS mean diffe rence for the primary e ndpoint between obicetrapib 
and placebo based on the ANCOVA methodology. Th e primary estimand will be addressed using 
the in-study observation period (ie, including data collected post-treatment discontinuation or 
post-prohibited medication use). 
Missing data will be imputed for the primary effi cacy analysis based on a pattern mixture model 
that uses a multiple imputation technique analy zed with ANCOVA with pre- specified fixed factors 
and covariates. If appropriate, based on the num ber of retrieved dropouts, missing measurements 
of non-retrieved dropouts will be modeled by know n measurements from retrieved dropouts (ie, 
participants who remain in the study after treatme nt discontinuation) in th e same treatment group. 
The imputation model will be fu rther clarified in the SAP. 
Additional sensitivity analyses may be carried out under seconda ry estimands and/or various 
assumptions for missing data. Full deta ils will be provi ded in the SAP. 
In order to control the Type I error rate, a fixed sequential testing procedure will be implemented. 
In a hierarchical step-down manner, the primary endpoint will be tested first, followed by the 
secondary efficacy endpoi nts in a pre-specified order. The pre-specified order of the hypothesis 
testing for the secondary endpoints will be described in the SAP.  No adjustment for multiple 
comparisons will be made for th e exploratory efficacy endpoints. 
Continuous secondary and explorat ory efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using similar methods 
as in the primary efficacy analysis. For the bi nary exploratory efficacy  endpoints, a logistic 
regression analysis will be perf ormed with model covariates of treatment group and Baseline 
LDL-C. Odds ratio and 95% confidence interval  for the odds ratio wi ll be obtained. Nominal 
p-values will be provided when applicable. De scriptive and graphical summaries by treatment 
group will also be presented. 
Full details of the models and analyses to be performed will be provided in the SAP. 
Safety analysis 
The Safety Population will be the primary population for the safe ty analysis. All safety endpoints 
will be summarized descriptively. No statistical in ference will be applied to the safety endpoints.

Version 3.0, 18 May 2022 AEs will be categorized by primary system organ class and preferred term as coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulator y Activities category designations. Summaries of AEs, including 
the number and percentage of participants who experience an AE, will be provided. 
Laboratory values will be summar ized descriptively, including the change from Baseline, by 
treatment group, and overall. In addition, shift tables  will be presented to describe the change in 
laboratory parameter values at post-Baseline vis its using normal range categories (low, normal, 
and high). 
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION: Enrollment of approximately 300 participan ts globally is pla nned for this study. 
Assuming an approximate 5% drop out rate, approxi mately 285 participants will be evaluable for 
efficacy. This sample size of at least 285 evaluabl e participants will provide more than 90% power 
to detect a 30% reduction of LDL-C (standard deviation 15%) levels in the obicetrapib group 
compared to the placebo group at a 1-sided signif icance level of 0.025. This sample size will also 
contribute to sufficient particip ant exposure and safety data. 
SITES:  Approximately 60 study sites globally

Version 3.0, 18 May 2022 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
1.1 Background Information on the Disease to be Treated 
Despite advances in treatment, cardiovascular (C V) disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death 
globally, resulting in over 17 million deaths annually.1 Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
cholesterol (LDL-C) is a major modifiable risk factor for the development of CVD.2,3 Lowering 
LDL-C has been shown to reduce the risk of death or myocardial infarction (MI), and the clinical 
risk reduction is linearly proportional to the absolute LDL-C reduction.4 Approximately 
100 million people worldwide are treated  with lipid-lowering therapie s, predominantly statins, to 
reduce LDL-C and the associated risk of CV even ts. Patients with documented atherosclerotic 
CVD (ASCVD) are at very high risk for events and require intensive pharmacologic intervention.
5,6 For a variety of reasons, many with ASCV D are unable to attain aggressive LDL-C 
treatment goals despite the addition of lipid-loweri ng agents to maximally tolerated statin therapy.7 
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) refers to individuals with extremely elevated LDL-C due to underlying genetic mutations of the LDL recepto r, apolipoprotein B (ApoB), and proprotein 
convertase subtilisin/kex in type 9 (PCSK9). In adult pati ents with heterozygous FH (HeFH), 
LDL-C usually exceeds 190 mg/dL (4.92 mmol/L) and can be as high as 400 mg/dL 
(10.36 mmol/L). HeFH is the most common form of the disease with a prevalence of 
approximately 1 in 300 to 500 persons worldwid e and as high as 1 in 100 persons in some 
populations. HeFH increases the risk of atheroscle rosis leading to CV events. The mean age for 
the onset of CVD is relatively  young, at 42 to 46 years in men and 51 to 52 years in women.
8 The 
National Lipid Association reco mmends that adults with HeFH use statins to achieve 
50% reduction in LDL-C. HeFH patients at an even higher risk for CVD (such as those with a 
history of ASCVD, diabetes, smoki ng, family history, and other risk  factors) have a treatment goal 
of 70 mg/dL ( 1.81 mmol/L). Those unable to achieve th ese treatment goals with maximally 
tolerated statin therapy require additional lipid-lowering therapy a nd still may be unable to reach 
LDL-C treatment goals. 
Lowering LDL-C is the primary therapeutic lipid target in ASCVD and HeFH patients. LDL-C is 
largely accepted as a valid su rrogate endpoint of CV events  by clinicians and regulatory 
authorities.9 Chronic LDL-C elevations lead to progressi ve accumulation of atherosclerotic lesions 
in the arteries that require long-term management. While life style changes are the primary 
intervention, these measures seldom reduce plas ma LDL-C by >15%. Particularly in ASCVD and 
HeFH patients, pharmacologic tr eatments are required to ade quately treat hyperlipidemia.10 
Evidence supporting LDL-C as a therapeutic target  and surrogate for CV  outcomes comes from 
interventional studies with LDL-C-lowering th erapies, epidemiological studies, and genetic 
variants (both gain of function and loss of func tion). Large randomized clin ical studies aimed at 
lowering LDL-C show a consistent, logarithmic- linear relationship betw een LDL-C reduction and 
CV risk reduction, independent of the way LDL-C lowering was achieved based on the mechanism 
of action.10 A published patient-level meta-analysis, including 26 studies and more than 
160,000 participants, showed a co nsistent relationship betw een LDL-C reduction and CV 
outcomes.10 This analysis showed that each 1 mmo l/L (38.61 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C is 
associated with a 22% reduction in the 5-year incidence of major coronary events, revascularizations, and ischemic strokes. Inte nsive statin therapy relative to low- or 
moderate-intensity statin treatment confers a greater benefit in patie nts at high CV risk.
10 
Non-statin therapies may provide additional lo wering of CV risk as demonstrated in the

Version 3.0, 18 May 2022 IMPROVE-IT study adding ezetimibe to statin therapy.11,12 Unfortunately, despite being treated 
with maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy, a substantial number of pa tients still do not reach 
their target guideline goals.11 
Patients with ASCVD and HeFH who require add itional lipid-lowering therapy despite treatment 
with maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy, including maximally tolera ted doses of statins, 
have an unmet medical need. Obicetrapib may offe r a useful option for these patients. Obicetrapib 
has been well tolerated to date and its Phase 2 data demonstrate signific ant LDL-C lowering, thus 
prompting further evaluation in  Phase 3 clinical studies. 
1.2 Background Information on Cholestery l Ester Transfer Protein Inhibition 
Cholesteryl ester transfer protei n (CETP) is a plasma glycoprotein produced in the liver and 
adipose tissue. It circulates in the blood bound primarily to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C) and is involve d in the transfer of cholestery l esters and triglycerides (TG) 
between lipoproteins. In particular , it mediates the transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to the 
ApoB-containing particles, VLDL, and LDL-C, in exchange for TG. 
Inhibition of CETP activity redu ces LDL-C levels and increases HDL-C levels. These effects are 
not only caused by inhibition of CETP-mediated cholesterol transfer from HDL to LDL, but also 
by a decrease in the number of ApoB-containing lipoproteins and an increase in apolipoprotein A1 
(ApoA1)-containing lipoprotei ns. The LDL-C-lowering eff ect, which arises from CETP 
inhibition, will benefit patients with el evated LDL-C and increased CV risk. 
The relative reduction in major adverse CV events (MACEs) 2 years after completion of the 
REVEAL study was nearly double (approximately 18%) than seen  at the end of the 4-year 
treatment period with the CETP inhibitor, anacetrapib (approximately 9%). In addition, 
between-group differences in the risk of coronary death emerged in the later years of follow-up, and, importantly, no safety concerns were desc ribed for non-vascular mortality or morbidity.
13 
1.3 Obicetrapib (TA-8995) 
Obicetrapib (TA-8995) has been sh own to be a selective CETP i nhibitor. Apart from preventing 
the shuttling of cholesterol esters from HDL-C  to LDL-C particles, obicetrapib has several 
additional compound-specific activi ties that are hypothesized to be  beneficial in patients. 
Obicetrapib treatment has recently  been shown to reduce the numb er of ApoB-containing particles 
that constitute LDL-C. Obicetrapib also increases  apolipoprotein E, which leads to removal of 
cholesterol via the liver and also reduces lipop rotein (a) (Lp[a]). Finally, obicetrapib not only 
potently increases HDL-C and the number of ApoA1-containing lipoproteins but has been 
demonstrated to be a potent inducer of choleste rol efflux, which is the main driver of reverse 
cholesterol transport.14 This effect is considered importa nt because it is expected to reduce 
established atheroma burden. 
1.4 Clinical Development of Obicetrapib 
Both single ascending dose (TA-8995-01) and multiple ascending dose (TA-8995-02) studies have 
been conducted in healthy volun teers. A formal thorough QT/heart rate-corrected QT interval 
study (TA-8995-04) has been completed and obicetrapib was shown to have no effect on the 
corrected QT interval by Fridericia. A drug- drug interaction study (TA-8995-05) has also been 
conducted; this study showed no significant effe ct of obicetrapib on P- glycoprotein activity, but 
NewAmsterdam B.V. 
Clinical Study Protocol TA-8995-301 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 21 of 67 
Version 3.0, 18 May 2022 showed that obicetrapib is a mild inducer of  cytochrome P450 3A4. A mass balance study in 
healthy males concluded that obicetrapib is steadily absorbed, and the principal route of excretion was in the feces (TA-8995-07). Finally, bioequivalence between obicetrapib capsule and tablet formulations was investigated (TA-8995-08). 
The first patient study conducted was a Phase 2 clinical study (TA-8995-03) in Denmark and 
The Netherlands where the aim was to evaluate the optimal dose of obi cetrapib alone and in 
combination with statins in pati ents with mild dyslipidemia. This study concluded that a daily dose 
of 10 mg of obicetrapib therapy resulted in an  LDL-C reduction of 45.4%, an HDL-C increase of 
179.0%, an ApoA1 increase of 63.4%, and a significant increase of HDL-C efflux capacity. 
Furthermore, given on top of atorvastatin 20 mg, obicetrapib 10 mg resulted in an additional 50.3% reduction in LDL-C. A second patient study (TA-8995-06) was conducted where the effect of obicetrapib on Lp(a) was inves tigated following 12 weeks of trea tment. There was a statistically 
significant reduction in Lp(a) levels following 12 weeks of treatment; however, the magnitude of 
the changes was not likely to  be clinically relevant. 
Two additional Phase 2 studies of obicetrapi b (TA-8995-303 and TA-8995-201)  have completed. 
The first study, TA-8995-303, evaluated the LDL-lowe ring effects of obicet rapib in combination 
with ezetimibe in participants  with mild dyslipidemia. The second study, TA-8995-201, evaluated 
the LDL-lowering effects of obicet rapib as an adjunct to high-inte nsity statin (HIS) therapy in 
participants with dyslipidemia w ho are on HIS. In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was 
achieved. 
This study is a pivotal Phase 3 study to investig ate the treatment of elev ated LDL-C levels in 
participants with a history of HeFH. This study will include part icipants on maximally tolerated 
lipid-modifying therapy, including max imally tolerated dos es of statins. 
1.4.1 Dose Selection Rationale 
In clinical studies in healthy volunteers, obicetrapib was generally well tolerated in single doses 
up to 150 mg and multiple doses up to 25 mg/day for 21 days. In clinical studies in patients, 
obicetrapib was also well tolerated after daily do sing of 10 mg for 12 week s, both alone and in 
combination with 2 different st atins. Near maximal effects we re observed with the 10 mg 
obicetrapib dose. At this dose leve l, CETP activity was reduced, a nd HDL-C levels were increased 
while LDL-C levels decreased. There were no dose -related adverse events (AEs) identified and no 
clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), or hematology or 
biochemistry parameters in any clinical studies. A statistically significant reduction in Lp(a) levels 
from Baseline was also observed at the 10 mg obicet rapib dose level. Therefore, the present study 
will utilize a dose of 10 mg obi cetrapib in participants with a history of HeFH who are not 
adequately controlled by their maxima lly tolerated lipid-modifying therapy. 
1.5 Rationale 
An alternative to statin use is the use of PCSK 9-targeted therapies. However, there are several 
limitations with this line of therapy, including very high costs and limited long-term success 
relative to statins. Because PCSK9-targeted ther apies are injectable, this  poses a less attractive 
option for patients who pr efer oral medications. 
NewAmsterdam B.V. 
Clinical Study Protocol TA-8995-301 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 22 of 67 
Version 3.0, 18 May 2022 Accordingly, there remains an unmet need for ther apies to reduce elevated LDL-C levels and CV 
risk at an acceptable cost and w ith a favorable safety profile to encourage long-term use and patient 
compliance. 
1.6 Risk/Benefit 
The primary pharmacology in in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo st udies has demonstrated that 
obicetrapib has the ability to i nhibit CETP, decrease LDL-C leve ls, increase HDL-C levels, and 
importantly, reduce the number of atherogenic ApoB-containing partic les in a way that is useful 
in the treatment of dyslipidemia. 
The safety pharmacology studies have demonstrat ed that obicetrapib has no adverse effect on the 
critical physiological systems ( central nervous system, respirat ory system, gastric emptying, 
urinary tract, and steroidal hormonal production [including aldoste rone levels]) at doses up to 
300 mg/kg in rats. In clinical studies in healthy volunteers, obicetrapib was generally well tolerated in single doses 
up to 150 mg and multiple doses up to 25 mg/day for 21 days. In clinical studies in patients, 
obicetrapib was also well tolerated after daily do sing of 10 mg for 12 week s, both alone and in 
combination with 2 different st atins. Near maximal effects we re observed with the 10 mg 
obicetrapib dose. At this dose leve l, CETP activity was reduced, a nd HDL-C levels were increased 
while LDL-C levels decreased. There were no dose-related AEs identified and no clinically 
significant changes in vital signs, ECGs, or hematology or biochemistry parame ters in any clinical 
studies. A statistically significant reduction in Lp (a) levels from Baseline was also observed at the 
10 mg obicetrapib dose level. Therefore, the present study will utilize a dose of 10 mg obicetrapib 
in participants with a history of HeFH who are not adequately controlled by their maximally 
tolerated lipid-modifying therapy. 
1.6.1 Coronavirus Disease 2019 Impacts 
In March 2020, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronaviru s 2, was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health 
Organization (WHO). The COVID-19 pandemic has imp acted clinical studies worldwide due to 
quarantines, site closures, travel limitations, diversion of resources, and/or general in terruptions in 
study-related procedures. This study will be initiated during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
The Sponsor has reviewed guidanc e from regulatory authorities an d reports from th e literature 
while planning study start-up and conduct (ie, European Medicines Agency 2020, Food and Drug 
Administration 2021).
15,16 
The Sponsor will communicate with  sites before study initiation and during the conduct of the 
study concerning the potential impact of COVI D-19 on study-related procedures and overall 
conduct. The Sponsor will continue to monitor COVID-19 activity in the geographic areas and 
institutions where the study will be conducted and conduct an ongoing risk assessment throughout 
the study. The risk assessment will be documente d on an ongoing basis in the Sponsor’s trial 
master file. 
This study protocol includes contin gency measures to ensure partic ipant safety whil e enabling sites 
to generate reliable data and ma intain integrity of the study a nd study data (see Section 3.1.1). The 
impacts of these implemented contingency meas ures on the outcomes of this study, including any

 Placebo group: 1 placebo tablet once daily. 
At least 70% of the participants  enrolled into this study must be taking HISs. HeFH diagnosis is 
defined by existing confirmation via genetic testing, WHO Criteria/D utch Lipid Clinical Network 
Criteria with a score of >8 points, and/or Simon Broome Register Diagnostic Criteria.17,18 Starting 
on Day 1, each participant will self-administer their assigned study drug once daily until Day 365. 
During the Treatment Period, partic ipants will return to the study site for effica cy and safety 
assessments. An End of Study (E OS) Visit will be conducted appr oximately 35 da ys after the 
participant’s last dose of st udy drug, during which vital si gns; limited serum chemistry, 
hematology, and coagulation pa rameters; pharmacokinetics (PK); concomitant medications; and 
AEs will be assessed. 
The study will be governed by a Steering Committ ee, and a Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) will provide independent oversight of participant safety. The responsibilities, procedures, and workflow fo r these committees will be  defined in separate 
charters outside of the protocol. 
3.1.1 COVID-19 Contingency Measures  
In cases of COVID-19 limita tions, it is the Investigator’s respons ibility to assure the safety of 
participants. If necessary, the S ponsor will implement and document mitigation strategies. It may 
be necessary to conduct some study visits virtua lly. At the Investigato r’s discretion, the study 
visit(s) can be conducted in-cli nic or virtually. If conducted vi rtually, the visit will include 
alternative methods for safety, efficacy, and distribution/collection of study drug, including, but 
not limited to, phone/video contact, alternative location for biologic sample co llection, alternative 
secure delivery of study drug, home health care (if available), and a secured way of transferring 
participant data from and to home health services and the site. 
If these contingency measures occur, the Sponsor will document the changes made, communicate 
recommendations about such change s in a timely fashion to minimi ze or prevent disruptions to the 
study, and support sites in implementing these changes. Documentation of these cases and the 
site’s management of participants should be record ed in the Investigator study files. In the absence 
of a COVID-19 impact, it is expected that Inves tigators and participants  follow the protocol 
requirements as set forth.

that many other patients who are unable to tolerate a statin were actually able to tolerate 
a different statin or dose. 
Note: Statin intolerance will be defined as in tolerance due to an adverse safety effect 
that started or increased during statin ther apy and resolved or improved when statin 
therapy was discontinued, resulting in an inab ility to tolerate either 1) two or more 
statins at any dose, or 2) one statin at any dose and either an unwillingness to attempt

4.3 Withdrawal Criteria 
Participation of a participant in this clinical st udy will be discontinued for any of the following 
reasons: 
 Withdrawal of consent; or 
 Termination of the study by the Spons or or the regulatory authority.  
Study drug treatment may be discontinued eith er permanently or te mporarily (although the 
participant should be  encouraged to remain in  the study and to follow up  for study visits) for any 
of the following reasons: 
 Occurrence of any medical conditi on or circumstance that exposes the participant to substantial 
risk and/or does not allow the participant to adhere to the requirements of the protocol; 
 Any serious AE (SAE), clinical ly significant AE, severe laboratory abnormality, intercurrent 
illness, or other medical condition which indi cates to the Investigator that continued 
participation is not in the best interest of the participant; 
 Requirement of prohibited concomitant medication; 
 Pregnancy (permanent discont inuation of study drug); or 
 Participant failure to comply with protocol  requirements or st udy-related procedures. 
Participants are free to withdr aw consent from the study (which means permanent discontinuation 
of study drug and all follow-up assessments) at  any time without pr ejudice. Note that 
discontinuation of study dr ug in and of itself is not  considered withdrawal of consent. 
Every attempt should be made to keep particip ants on study drug throughout the duration of the 
study. Before permanently discontinuing study drug (eit her participant- or I nvestigator-initiated), 
an interruption should be consider ed. Participants who temporaril y discontinue study drug for any 
reason should restart as soon as 
it is medically justified in th e opinion of the Investigator.  
NewAmsterdam B.V. 
Clinical Study Protocol TA-8995-301 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 31 of 67 
Version 3.0, 18 May 2022 All participants who permanently discontinue study drug should continue scheduled study visits. 
In addition, all procedures and laboratory samp les or tests requested for evaluation following 
administration of the study drug should be carried out when possible, whether or not a subject 
continues to receive treatmen t according to the protocol. 
For participants who permanently discontinue from study treatment and who decline continued  
study participation , an Early Termination ( ET) Visit will be schedu led as soon as possible 
followed by an EOS Visit approximately 35 days la ter. The ET Visit procedures are identical to 
the End of Treatment (EOT) Visit procedures. If the discontinuation occurs at a specific onsite 
visit, this visit will become the ET Visit and EOT Visit procedures should be followed. Participants 
who withdraw consent to all follow-up will be as ked about the reason(s) and will be assessed for 
the presence of any AEs. 
If premature withdrawal from the st udy occurs for any r eason, the Investigator must determine the 
primary reason for a participant’s premature withdrawal from the study and record th is information 
in the medical records and on the electronic case report form (eCRF). 
Withdrawn participants will not be replaced. 
4.4 Retesting 
If laboratory abnormalities during Screening are considered by th e Investigator to be transient, 
then the laboratory tests may be  repeated once during Screening. Laboratory samples may also be 
repeated if samples are unable to be tested due to  hemolysis, platelet clum ping, or other processing 
errors. Retesting will be performed by the centr al laboratory. The Inves tigator’s rationale for 
retesting should be documented. If the retest result is no longer exclusionary, the participant may 
be randomized. 
4.5 Rescreening 
Participants who have screen fail ed are permitted to rescreen on ce, following consul tation with the 
Medical Monitor. Rescreening may be scheduled after at least 5 days have elapsed from the 
previous study visit. Rescreened participan ts will be assigned a ne w participant number.

Clinical Study Protocol TA-8995-301 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 32 of 67 
Version 3.0, 18 May 2022 5 STUDY TREATMENTS 
5.1 Treatment Groups 
Approximately 300 eligible partic ipants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio, respectively, to the 
following treatment groups: 
 Obicetrapib group: One 10 mg obice trapib tablet once daily; or 
 Placebo group: 1 placebo tablet once daily. 
All study drugs will be admin istered by the participant orally on Days 1 to 365. 
5.2 Rationale for Dosing 
In clinical studies in healthy volunteers, obicetrapib was generally well tolerated in single doses 
up to 150 mg and multiple doses up to 25 mg/day for 21 days. In clinical studies in patients, 
obicetrapib was also well tolerated after daily do sing of 10 mg for 12 week s, both alone and in 
combination with 2 different st atins. Near maximal effects we re observed with the 10 mg 
obicetrapib dose. At this dose leve l, CETP activity was reduced, a nd HDL-C levels were increased 
while LDL-C levels decreased. There were no dose-related AEs identified and no clinically 
significant changes in vital signs, ECGs, or hematology or biochemistry parame ters in any clinical 
studies. A statistically significant reduction in Lp (a) levels from Baseline was also observed at the 
10 mg obicetrapib dose level. Therefore, the present study will utilize a dose of 10 mg obicetrapib 
in participants with a history of HeFH who are not adequately controlled by their maximally 
tolerated lipid-modifying therapy. 
5.3 Randomization and Blinding 
Participants who meet all inclus ion criteria and none of the ex clusion criteria will be randomized 
on Day 1 (Visit 2) via the  Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system in a 2:1 ratio 
to receive obicetrapib or placebo. 
The study drug blind will be maintained through th e EOS Visit (Visit 8). Pa rticipants, the Sponsor, 
Investigators, and all study site personnel involved in the study, includ ing personnel carrying out 
study procedures, evaluating participants, entering study data, and/or evaluating study data, will 
remain blinded to treatment allocations until all participants have completed the EOS Visit 
assessments and the database ha s been locked for analysis. 
Active and placebo product will be identical. Me dication bottles with a unique code will be 
assigned to participants at various points in the study by the IRT system. 
5.4 Breaking the Blind 
Study drug will be managed using the IRT system. Each user will have a unique username and passcode to access the system. Investigators shal l not break the study blind during the study, and 
Investigators should treat all partic ipants as if they had received obi cetrapib. However, in situations 
in which knowledge of the participant’s study dr ug is necessary for clinical management, the 
Investigator should proceed with unblinding.  
Once a participant’s treatment assignment has been unblinded, the Medica l Monitor or designee 
should be notified within 24 hours of unblinding of the treatment. Information relating to 
unblinding (eg, date and time of the call to the Medical Monitor by the I nvestigator, reason for

Version 3.0, 18 May 2022 5.5.5 Storage and Accountability 
All study drug must be stored below 25°C (77°F) in a secure area with access limited to the 
Investigator and authorized st udy site personnel. Study drug should not be frozen or  refrigerated. 
In accordance with regulatory requirements, the Investigator or designated study site personnel 
must document the amount of study drug dispensed and/or administered to participants, the amount returned by participants, and the amount received from and returned to the Sponsor (or 
representative), when applicable. Study drug accountability records must be maintained throughout the course of the study. The accountability unit for this study is a tablet. Discrepancies 
are to be reconciled or resolved. Procedures for final disposition of unused study drug will be provided in the appr opriate study manual. 
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Medications and/or Procedures 
5.6.1 Excluded Medications and/or Procedures 
Participants who have received tr eatment with other investigationa l products or devices within 
30 days of Screening or 5 half-lives of the previ ous investigational produc t (whichever is longer) 
will be excluded from study participation. 
Participants with a kn own history of alcohol and/or drug abuse with in 5 years prior to 
Randomization will be excluded from study participation.  
Participants who plan to use ot her investigational products or de vices during the course of the 
study will be excluded fr om study participation.  
Participants who are taking gemfibrozil will be excluded  from study participation per 
Exclusion Criterion 13. 
5.6.2 Restricted Medications  and/or Procedures 
Participants receiving lipid-modifying therapies as  described in Section 4. 1 (Inclusion Criterion 4) 
should be on a stable dose for at least 8 w eeks prior to Screening. Participants taking 
PCSK9-targeted therapies should ha ve received 4 stable doses prio r to Screening. There should be 
no planned medication or dose changes for lipid -modifying therapy during study participation. If 
there are changes to lipid-modifying therapy during the study, these da ta will be recorded. 
Participants must agree not to initiate any new lipid-modifying medications (including 
supplements) and not to change the dose of the existing lipid-modifying medications (including 
supplements) during study participation. 
Participants may continue taking very low dose statin therapy throughout the study, provided that 
the dose is stable and well tolerated. Participants are also not required to be  taking statins. Reasons 
for not using statin therapy must be documented (eg, the pa rticipant is statin intolerant). If the 
participant is statin intolerant, written confirmati on will be required of both the participant and the 
Investigator stating that the part icipant was statin intolerant, aware of the benefit of statins to 
reduce the risk of a MACE, and aware that many othe r patients who are unable  to tolerate a statin 
were actually able to tolerate a different statin  or dose. Statin intole rance, as defined in 
Inclusion Criterion 4, should be recorded as intolerance to any dos e of any statin attributed to the

Confidential & Proprietary Page 35 of 67 
Version 3.0, 18 May 2022 statin in question in the source documentation and eCRF  as part of medica l history to confirm 
intolerance to statins.19 
Participants must agree not to dona te blood during study participation. 
5.6.3 Documentation of Prior and Concomitant Medication Use 
All prior and concomitant medications must be documented in the source documents and 
applicable eCRFs. Concomitant me dications will continue to be assessed and recorded at every 
study visit from the time of informed consent until study participation is complete. 
Data from all participants rega rding lipid-lowering medications taken throughout the study will be 
recorded. The number of participants taking a sta tin or PCSK9-targeted therapy during the study 
and the number of participants who discontinue b ackground statin therapy, along with the reasons 
for discontinuation of background statin therapy, will be recorded in th e applicable eCRFs. 
A participant’s maximally tolerated stable statin dose will be determined by the Investigator using his/her medical judgment and ava ilable sources, including the part icipant’s self-reported history 
of lipid-modifying thera py, and recorded in th e applicable eCRFs. 
No more than 10% of participants in this study will be statin intolerant. For any participant not 
taking statin therapy due to statin intolerance (as defined in Inclusion Criterion 4), written 
confirmation will be required of both the participant and the Investigator stating that the participant 
was statin intolerant, aware of the benefit of sta tins to reduce the risk of  a MACE, and aware that 
many other patients who are unable to tolerate a statin were actually able to tolerate a different statin or dose.

An AE is defined as any untow ard medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant 
administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unf avorable and/or unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated  with the use of an 
investigational medicinal product, whether or not related to the in vestigational medicinal product. 
All AEs, including observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded 
on the appropriate eCRF. 
AEs, which include clinical labor atory test variables, will be m onitored and documented from the 
time of signing of informed consen t at Screening until the EOS Visit (approximately 35 days after 
the EOT Visit). Participants should be instructed  to report any AE that  they experience to the 
Investigator, whether or not they think the event is due to study treatment. Beginning at the time 
of signing of informed consent, Investigators s hould make an assessment for AEs at each visit and 
record the event on the appropriate AE eCRF. Wherever possible, a specific dise ase or syndrome rather than in dividual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by  the Investigator and recorded  on the eCRF. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not cons idered a component of a specific disease or 
syndrome by the Investigator, it should be recorded as a separate AE on the AE eCRF. 
Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical  procedure (eg, surgery, endoscopy, 
tooth extraction, or transfusion)  should be recorded as an AE, not the procedure itself.  
Any medical condition already present at Screening should be recorded as medical history and not be reported as an AE unless the medical condition or  signs or symptoms present at Baseline change 
in severity, frequency, or seriousne ss at any time during the study. In this case, it shou ld be reported 
as an AE. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination (eg, EC G) findings that are 
detected during the study or are present at Sc reening and significantly worsen during the study 
should be reported as AEs, as desc ribed below. The Investigator wi ll exercise his/ her medical and 
scientific judgment in decidi ng whether an abnormal laborato ry finding or other abnormal 
assessment is clinically significant. Clinically  significant abnormal laboratory values occurring 
during the clinical study will be followed until repeat  tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no 
longer clinically sign ificant. Abnormal test results that are de termined to be an error should not be 
reported as an AE.  Laboratory abnormalities or othe r abnormal clinical findings (e g, ECG abnormalities) should be 
reported as an AE if any of  the following are applicable: 
 If an intervention is required as a result of the abnormality; 
 If action taken with the study drug is require d as a result of the abnormality; or 
 Based on the clin
 ical judgment of the Investigator.

Version 3.0, 18 May 2022 8.1.1 Adverse (Drug) Reaction 
All noxious and unintended respon ses to a medicinal product re lated to any dose should be 
considered adverse drug reactions. “Responses” to a medicinal product means that a causal 
relationship between a medicinal pr oduct and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, ie, the 
relationship cannot  be ruled out. 
8.1.2 Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction 
An unexpected adverse drug reaction is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of 
which is not consistent with the applicable product information.  
8.1.3 Assessment of AEs by the Investigator 
The Investigator will assess the severity (intens ity) of each AE as mild, moderate, or severe, and 
will also categorize each AE as to its potential relationship to study drug using the categories of 
yes or no. 
Assessment of severity 
Mild – An event that is easily tolerated and generally not interfering with normal daily activities. Moderate – An event that is su fficiently discomforting to interfere with normal daily activities. 
Severe – An event that is incapacitating with inab ility to work or perform normal daily activities. 
Causality assessment 
The relationship of an AE to the administration of  the study drug is to be assessed according to the 
following definitions: No (not related or unlikely to be related) – The time course between the administration of study 
drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE ru les out a causal relatio nship and another cause 
(concomitant drugs, therapies, comp lications, etc) is suspected. 
Yes (possibly, probably, or defin itely related) – The time course  between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE  is consistent with a causal relationship and 
no other cause (concomitant drugs, therapies,  complications, etc) can be identified. 
The definition implies a reasonabl e possibility of a causal relati onship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that there are facts (eviden ce) or arguments to sugge st a causal relationship. 
The following factors should also be considered: 
 The temporal sequence from  study drug administration- 
The event should occur after the study drug is  given. The length of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be  evaluated in the clinical  context of the event. 
 Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases- 
Each report should be ev aluated in the context of  the natural history and course of the disease 
being treated and any other dise ase the participant may have. 
NewAmsterdam B.V. 
Clinical Study Protocol TA-8995-301 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 41 of 67 
Version 3.0, 18 May 2022  Concomitant drug- 
The other drugs the participant is taking or th e treatment the participant receives should be 
examined to determine whether any of them might  be recognized to cause the event in question. 
 Known response pattern for this class of study drug- 
Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate wh ether a particular respon se is likely to be a 
class effect. 
 Exposure to physical and/ or mental stresses- 
The exposure to stress might induc e adverse changes in the recipient and pr ovide a logical and 
better explanation for the event. 
 The pharmacology and PK of the study drug- 
The known pharmacologic properties (absorption, distribution, me tabolism, and excretion) of 
the study drug should be considered. 
8.1.4 Events of Special Interest  
ESIs will be monitored over time by the independent DSMB, as described in the DSMB charter, 
regardless of whether these events were reported as AEs. Any events that qualify as an AE or SAE 
will be reported accordingly (see Sections 8.1, 8.2 , and 8.3). 
ESIs will include the following hepatic abnormali ties, muscle-related ab normalities, new-onset 
diabetes mellitus (NODM) and/or h yperglycemia, renal abnormalitie s, changes to antihypertensive 
medication(s) due to changes in blood pressure, and ophthalmic events (ie,  macular degeneration), 
described as follows: 
 AST or ALT >3  ULN; 
 Bilirubin >2  ULN; 
 CK >5  ULN; 
 NODM or worsening of glycemic control;  
Note: NODM is defined by 1 or more of the following criteria, base d upon information from 
AE, medication, and laboratory data:  o AE indicating new type 1 or type 2 diabetes; 
o Initiation of anti-diabetes me dication with confir mation of the diagnos is of diabetes by 
blinded external review by experts in diabetology; 
o HbA1c 6.5% (0.065 hemoglobin fraction); and/or 
o Two consecutive values of fas ting plasma glucose that are 126 mg/dL ( 7.0 mmol/L). 
Note: Worsening of glycemic control will be  defined as an HbA1c increase from Baseline 
>0.5% (>0.005 hemoglobin fractio n) and/or a new concomitan t medication or increase in 
current antidiabetic therapy in a participant with a Baseline HbA1c 6.5% (0.065 hemoglobin 
fra
ction).

Version 3.0, 18 May 2022  A >25% decrease in eGFR from Base line or an eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, calculated using 
the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaborat ion equation, and/or an increase in serum 
creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL ( 26.5  mol/L) from Baseline; 
 Changes to antihypertensive medication(s) due to changes in blood pressure in those 
participants receivi ng antihypertensive medication(s) treatment at Baseline; and 
 Macular degeneration.  
These ESIs will be monitored through revi ew of the AE and laboratory database. 
8.1.4.1 Guidelines for management of elevated liver enzymes  
Participants with signs or symptoms consistent with liver injury (eg, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, 
fatigue, right upper abdominal pain or discomfo rt) should undergo immediate testing of ALT, 
AST, gamma-glutamyl transferase, bilirubin,  alkaline phosphatase, prothrombin time, and 
international normalized ratio.  
In the absence of clinical symptoms, participants with ALT or AST >3  ULN (if normal at 
Baseline) or >2-fold change (if a bnormal at Baseline) s hould be retested with in 48 to 72 hours for 
the usual serum measurements (ALT, AST, alkalin e phosphatase, and bilirubin) to confirm the 
abnormalities and to deter mine if the associated values are increasing or  decreasing. There should 
also be an inquiry about symptoms at the time of follow-up. 
If the above abnormali ties are confirmed: 
 Repeat liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests 2 or 3 times weekly. The frequency of retesting 
can decrease to once a week or  less if abnormalities stabili ze or the study drug has been 
discontinued and the partic ipant is asymptomatic; 
 Obtain a more detailed history of symp toms and prior or concurrent diseases; 
 Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (i ncluding nonprescription me dications and herbal 
and dietary supplement preparatio ns), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and special diet; 
 Rule out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C,  D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; hypox ic/ischemic hepatopathy; a nd biliary tract disease; 
 Obtain a history of exposure to environmental ch emical agents; 
 Obtain additional tests to evaluate liver functi on, as appropriate (eg, international normalized 
ratio, direct bilirubin); and 
 Consider gastroen terology or hepatology consultations. 
Study drug discontinuati on should occur if: 
 ALT or AST >8  ULN; 
 ALT or AST >5  ULN for more th an 2 weeks; 
 ALT or AST >3  ULN and (total bilirubin >2  ULN or international normalized ratio >1.5); 
or 
 ALT or AST >3  ULN with the appearance of fatigue , nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant 
pain or tenderness, fever, ra sh, and/or eosinophilia (>5%).

Version 3.0, 18 May 2022 8.1.4.2 Guidelines for monitoring and management of CK  
If at any time after Randomization a participant experiences a CK elevation >5  ULN, the 
participant will undergo a repeat confirmatory assessment as soon as is reasonably possible, 
preferably within 3 to 7 days of th e laboratory result becoming available. 
A repeat CK assessment will include query for related symptoms. 
If the repeat CK assessment confirms an unexplaine d (ie, not associated w ith recent trauma or 
physically strenuous activ ity) CK abnormality >5  ULN and the participant is asymptomatic, 
he/she should receive further assessment and inve stigation into the cause, assessment of whether 
there is renal injury, and measurement of CK approximately weekly, or more frequently if 
clinically indicated, unt il resolution. If CK levels continue  to rise, the study drug should be 
discontinued. 
If the participant experien ces a CK elevation >5  ULN and is symptomatic, the following should 
be completed:  Interruption of study drug; 
 Clarification of the nature, duration, and intensity of muscle symptoms; 
 Review of possible predisposing factors, such as unaccustomed exercise, heavy alcohol intake, 
and viral illness (consider  performing serology); 
 Evaluation for additional diagnoses or other conditions which can cause myopathy, including 
muscle tenderness (by physical examination), weakness, rash, m easurement of serum 
creatinine, and/or dipstick urinal ysis with micros copy, if indicated; 
 Measurement of clinical chemistries to asse ss the possibility of  lactic acidosis; and 
 Follow-up of symptoms and CK until the abnormality has resolved. 
If, based on the above evaluation, an alternative explanation is suspected, consideration can be 
given to resuming study drug once CK returns to Baseline levels. 
If no alternative explanation exists , consideration should be given to withdrawing the participant 
from study drug treatment. 
If the repeat CK assessment confirms an unexplaine d (ie, not associated w ith recent trauma or 
physically strenuous activity) CK >10  ULN, the participant should be withdrawn and given no 
further doses of st udy drug, even in the absence of sy mptoms. The signs and symptoms and 
laboratory assessments as outlined above should also be evaluated. The participant should continue 
being followed in th e study for safety. 
Any event of rhabdomyolysis, regardless of CK, should lead to study drug interruption/discontinuation unt il the contribution of obice trapib has been excluded. 
8.1.4.3 Guidelines for monitoring and management of NODM 
Diabetes mellitus may be newly diagnosed duri ng the study as described in Section 8.1.4. If a 
participant is newly diagnosed with diabetes  mellitus during the course of the study, the 
Investigator will recommend referral for initial diabetes education and management by an appropriate healthcare provider (e g, diabetologist, endocrinologist , or primary ca re provider). 
Interventions for management ma y include diet and lifestyle c ounseling, self-monitoring of blood

Version 3.0, 18 May 2022 glucose, oral glucose-lowering medications, injectable medications, or insulin as deemed 
necessary by the treating physician based on the le vel of hyperglycemia and relevant symptoms. 
8.1.4.4 Guidelines for monitoring and management of significant change s in renal function  
If at any time after Randomiza tion a participant expe riences ANY of the follo wing, the participant 
will undergo a repeat confirmatory assessment as s oon as is reasonably possible, preferably within 
3 to 7 days of the laborator y result becoming available: 
 A >25% decrease in eGFR from Baseline, calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation; 
 An eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m
2, calculated using the Chroni c Kidney Disease Epidemiology 
Collaboration equation; and/or 
 An increase in serum creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL ( 26.5  mol/L) from Baseline. 
In consultation with the Medical Monitor and/ or nephrologist, if no alternative etiology is 
determined, the study drug should be discontinued if participants experi ence an unexplained, 
confirmed increase in serum creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL ( 26.5 mol/L) from Baseline or an 
unexplained, confirmed >25% decr ease in eGFR from Baseline. 
If any of these individual labora tory parameters are confirmed, such events of decline in renal 
function should be recorded as an ESI. 
8.1.4.5 Guidelines for monitoring and management of changes to antihypertensive 
medication(s) 
Any changes to antihypertensive  medication(s) due to change s in blood pressure in those 
participants receiving an tihypertensive medication(s) treatment at Baseline will be assessed by the 
Investigator, primary care physic ian, or other appropriate hea lth care provider to assess for 
etiologies of blood pressure change, to confirm clinic al safety of the participant, to assess the need 
for any AE or SAE reporting, and to arra nge for appropriate medical follow-up. 
8.1.4.6 Guidelines for management  of macular degeneration 
In cases of suspected macular degeneration or acute vision loss, participants will be referred for 
an ophthalmological consultation. 
8.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE or adverse reaction is consid ered serious if, in the view of e ither the Investigator or Sponsor, 
it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death; 
 A life-threatening AE; 
Note: An AE or adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening” if, in view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does 
not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe fo rm, might have caused death. 
NewAmsterdam B.V. 
Clinical Study Protocol TA-8995-301 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 45 of 67 
Version 3.0, 18 May 2022  Requires hospitalization or prolonga tion of existing hospitalizations; 
Note: Any hospital admission with at least 1 overn ight stay will be considered an inpatient 
hospitalization. An emergency room or urgent care visit without hos pital admission will not 
be recorded as an SAE under this criterion, nor will hospitalization for a procedure scheduled or planned before signing of informed consent,  or elective treatment of  a pre-existing condition 
that did not worsen from Base line. However, unexpected comp lications and/or prolongation 
of hospitalization that occur during elective su rgery should be recorded as AEs and assessed 
for seriousness. Admission to the hospital for social  or situational reasons (ie, no place to stay, 
live too far away to come for hospital visits, respite care) will not be  considered inpatient 
hospitalizations.  
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions;  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
 An important medical event. 
Note: Important medical events that do not meet any of the a bove criteria may be considered 
an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical ju dgment, they may jeopardize the participant 
and may require medical or surg ical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical events include alle rgic bronchospasm requir ing intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dys crasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalizations, or the development of drug dependency. 
8.3 SAE Reporting − Procedures for Investigators 
Initial reports 
All SAEs occurring from the time of informed co nsent until the end of st udy participation (up to 
35 [±7] days post last dose) will be reported, regard less of the Investigator’s determination as to 
relatedness, to  within 24 hours of the know ledge of the occurrence. After 
the 35-day reporting window, any SAE that the Invest igator considers related to study drug must 
be reported to  or the Sponsor/designee ( ). 
To report the SAE, complete th e SAE form electronically in th e EDC system for the study. If the 
event meets serious criteria and it  is not possible to access the EDC system, send an email to 
 at  or cal l the  SAE reporting 
line (telephone number listed in Section 8.6), a nd fax/email the completed back-up paper SAE 
form to  (contact information listed in S ection 8.6) within 24 hours of awareness. When 
the EDC system becomes available, the SAE information must be entered within 24 hours of the 
system becoming available. 
Follow-up reports 
The Investigator must co ntinue to follow the participant until  the SAE has subsided or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment), or the 
participant dies. 
Within 24 hours of receipt of follow-up information, the Inve stigator must update the SAE form 
electronically in the EDC system for the study and submit any s upporting documentation 
(eg, participant discharge summary or autopsy re ports) to  via fax or 

NewAmsterdam B.V.

Version 3.0, 18 May 2022 email. If it is not po ssible to access the EDC system, refer to  the procedures outlined above for 
initial reporting of SAEs.  
8.4 Pregnancy Reporting 
If a participant becomes pregnant  during the study, the Investigator  is to stop dosing with study 
drug immediately and permanently. However, the participant should be encouraged to remain in 
the study and to follow-up for st udy visits. See Section 4.3 for more details regarding withdrawal 
criteria and discont inuation of study drug. 
A pregnancy is not considered to be an AE or SAE; however, it must be reported to  
 within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.  will then 
provide the Investigator/s tudy site the Exposure In Utero (EIU ) form (Part 1) for completion. The 
Investigator/study site must complete the EIU fo rm (Part 1) and fax/email it back to  
 
If the female partner of a male participant beco mes pregnant while the participant is receiving 
study drug, the Investigator should notify  as described above. 
The pregnancy should be followed until the ou tcome of the pregnancy is known, whenever 
possible. Once the outcome of the pregnancy is k nown, the EIU form (Part 2) should be completed 
and faxed/emailed to . If the outcome of th e pregnancy meets the criteria 
for immediate classification as  an SAE (ie, postpartum comp lication, spontaneous abortion, 
stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly) , the Investigator should follow the procedures 
for reporting an SAE. 8.5 Expedited Reporting 
The Sponsor/designee ) will report all re levant information about Suspected Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) that are fatal or life-threatenin g to the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), applicable Competent Aut horities in all Member States (including all 
Institutional Review Boards [I RBs]/Independent Ethics Committees  [IECs]), and to the Central 
Ethics Committees no later than 7 calendar da ys (CDs) after knowledge by the Sponsor/designee 
of such a case. Relevant follow-up information will subsequen tly be communicated within an 
additional 8 CDs.  
All other SUSARs will be reported to the FDA, a pplicable Competent Authorities in all Member 
States (including all IRBs/IECs) , and to the Central Ethics Co mmittees within a maximum of 
15 CDs of first knowledge by the Sponsor/designee.  
The Sponsor/designee will also report any additional expedited safety reports required in 
accordance with the timelines outlined in country-specifi c legislation.  
The Sponsor/designee will also inform all Inve stigators as required per local regulation. 
The requirements above re fer to the requirements relating to study drug.

20,21 
Aggregate unblinded analysis by the independent DSMB will be conducted in order to identify 
safety concerns, such as potential imbalances in  event rates between the drug treatment and control 
groups. Should the DSMB identify any potential safe ty concerns, they will be able to recommend 
reporting of these findings to the Health Authori ties (HA), Investigators, Ethics Committees, and 
IRBs. Additionally, the DSMB will have the freedom to determine, based on their ongoing review 
of the safety data, if any of the exempted AEs should be changed to become subject to expedited 
reporting from that point on. A safety report will be  submitted if an aggreg ate analysis indicates 
the anticipated SAEs are occurring more frequently  in the treatment group co mpared to the placebo 
group. 
8.6 Special Situation Reports 
Special situation reports include reports of overdose, misuse, abus e, medication error, and reports 
of adverse reactions associat ed with product complaints. 
 Overdose:  Refers to the administration of a qua ntity of a medicinal product given per 
administration or cumulatively (accidentally or  intentionally), which is above the maximum 
recommended dose according to the protocol. Clinical judgment s hould always be applied. In 
cases of a discrepancy in the dr ug accountability, overdose will be  established only when it is 
clear that the participant has taken additional dose (s), or the Investigator has reason to suspect 
that the participant has ta ken additional dose(s).  
 Misuse:  Refers to situations wher e the medicinal product is inte ntionally and inappropriately 
used in a way that is not in accordance with th e protocol instructions or local prescribing 
information and may be accompanied by harmful physical and/or psychological effects.  
 Abuse:  Is defined as persistent or  sporadic, intentional excessive  use of a medicinal product, 
which is accompanied by harmful p hysical or psychological effects. 
 Medication error:  Is any unintentiona l error in the pres cribing, dispensing, or administration 
of a medicinal product by a health care professional, participant, or consumer, respectively. The 
administration or consumption of  the unassigned treatment and administration of an expired 
product are always reportable as  medication errors; cases of participants missing doses of 
investigational product are not considered reportabl e as medication errors. 
 Product complaint:  Is defined as any written, electronic,  or oral communication that alleges 
deficiencies related to the identity, quality, du rability, reliability, safe ty, effectiveness, or 
performance of a drug or device af ter it is released for distribu tion. A special situations form 
will only be completed if a complaint is a ssociated with an adverse drug reaction.  
All special situati on events as described above must be reported on the special situation report 
form and faxed/emailed to  (contact informati on listed below) within 
24 hours of knowledge of the event. All AEs associated with these special situati on reports should 
be reported as AEs or SAEs as well as record ed on the AE eCRF and/or the SAE report form. 
Details of the symptoms and signs,
 clinical ma nagement, and outcome sh ould be provided, when 
available. 

NewAmsterdam B.V. 
Clinical Study Protocol TA-8995-301 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 49 of 67 
Version 3.0, 18 May 2022 and the blinded study team will be informed that random sham aler ts will also be sent to sites, in 
order to maintain the study blind. 
8.7.4 Managing Abnormal and Critical Laboratory Values  
Any laboratory test result abnormality that fulfills the criteria for an SAE will be reported as such 
on the appropriate AE and SAE eCRF. Any treatment -emergent abnormal laborat ory result that is 
clinically significant, ie, meets 1 or more of the following criteria , will be recorded as a single 
diagnosis on the AE eCRF: 
 Is accompanied by clinical symptoms; 
 Leads to a change in study drug (eg, study drug interruption or permanent discontinuation); 
and/or 
 Requires a change in concomitant therapy or  a medical intervention (eg, the addition of, 
interruption of, or discontinua tion of, or any other change in a concomitant medication, 
therapy, or treatment). 
These criteria apply to any protoc ol and non-protocol-specified sa fety and/or efficacy laboratory 
results from tests performed after the first dose of study drug that me et clinical significance criteria. 
These criteria do not apply to any abnormal laborator y test results which fall  outside the laboratory 
reference range, but which do not m eet clinical significance criteria (these will be analyzed and 
reported as laboratory abnormalities) or those which are a result of an AE or an endpoint which 
has already been reported. 
The Investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining whether an 
abnormal value in an individual participant represents a clinical ly significant change from the 
participant’s Baseline values. In general, laboratory abnormalities without clinical significance 
should not be recorded as AEs.  Where applicable, the clinical  sequelae, not the laboratory 
abnormality, should be recorded as the AE.  
Critical laboratory values are values that may wa rrant medical intervention to avoid possible harm 
to a participant. Critical laborator y values will be defined in th e Laboratory Manual  for the study, 
and the Medical Monitor and Investig ator will be notified of the occu rrence of a critical laboratory 
value (critical high or critical low) by a special annotation (flag) in the laboratory reports provided 
to the sites. 
If LDL-C values are confirmed critically high (see Section 8.7.3), OR if TG levels exceed 
500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L), the Investigator may need to take appropriate medical action, which 
could include the following: reinforce/intensify therapeutic lifestyle changes (including diet and physical activity), increase the dose of the present statin thera py, add ezetimibe, or prescribe a 
more potent lipid-modifying therapy to lower LDL-C.  The Investigator should use the best clinical 
judgment for each participant. 
8.8 Vital Signs 
Vital signs (consisting of heart rate  and blood pressure) will be measured in trip licate prior to study 
drug administration at applicable  visits (see Appendix A). On Da y 1 (Visit 2), blood pressure will 
be measured prior to Randomiza tion. When available, an automa ted blood pressure device is 
recommended for collection of blood pressure a nd the result should be recorded to the 
nearest mmHg. 
NewAmsterdam B.V. 
Clinical Study Protocol TA-8995-301 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 50 of 67 
Version 3.0, 18 May 2022 Vital signs will be measured using the following standardized procedures:  
 Participants should not exercise, smoke, or c onsume caffeinated beverages or food 30 minutes 
prior to assessment of vital signs; and  
 Vital signs should be obtained prior to ECG recordings.  
8.8.1 Blood Pressure Monitoring  
Blood pressure specifically will be measured using the following standa rdized procedures:  
 Participants should be seated fo r at least 5 minutes in the examination room with the back 
supported, feet flat on the floor, and the measur ement arm supported so that the midpoint of 
the manometer cuff is at heart level; 
 An appropriately sized cuff should be used with the bladder cent ered over the brachial artery; 
 The cuff size and arm used for the measurement should be recorded; th e same arm should be 
used for all readings; 
 Three seated blood pressure measurements (each measurement 1 to  2 minutes apart) should be 
obtained using the same arm at ea ch site visit. Mean seated blood pressure is defined as the 
average of 3 seated blood pressure measurements at a single site visit; and 
 If the lowest and highest blood pressure meas urements are >15 mmHg apart, additional 
readings should be performed. 
Blood pressure readings, both systolic and diastoli c, will be evaluated over time by the independent 
DSMB, who will monitor unblinded safety data during the study. Changes in blood pressure, as 
well as heart rate, will be compared between trea tment groups with respect to mean and median 
values over time using both actual values and absolute changes from Baseline. In addition, treatment groups will be compared  with respect to the incidence of hypertens ive status and other 
vital sign abnormalities as defined in th e Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
8.9 Electrocardiograms

Version 3.0, 18 May 2022 9 STATISTICS 
9.1 Analysis Populations 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Populat ion will include all participants  who are randomized into the 
study. Treatment classification will be based on the randomized treatment.  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will include all part icipants who are randomi zed into the study, take 
any study drug, and have at least 1 post-treatment lipid data asse ssment. Treatment classification 
will be based on the randomized treatment. The Modified ITT (mITT) Populat ion will include all randomized participants who receive at 
least 1 dose of any study drug and have data fo r both the Day 1 and Day 84 LDL-C assessments. 
Treatment classification will be based on the randomized treatment.  The Per-Protocol (PP) Population will include all participants in the mI TT Population who did not 
experience a major protocol deviation that potentially impacted the primary efficacy endpoint. The 
PP Population, along with the reason for exclusio n, will be finalized prior to study unblinding. 
The Safety Population will includ e all participants w ho receive at least 1 dose of any study drug. 
Treatment classification will be ba sed on the actual treatment receiv ed. The Safety Population will 
be the primary population used  for the safety analyses.  
9.2 Statistical Methods 
An SAP will be finalized before database lock. Any changes to the methods described in the SAP 
will be described and justified as needed in th e final Clinical Study Report. All study-collected 
data will be summarized by treatm ent group using descript ive statistics,  graphs, and/or raw data 
listings. Descriptive statistics for continuous variables will include number of participants, mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values. Analys es of categorical variables 
will include frequency and percentage. 
Unless otherwise stated, Baseline values will be the last non-missing measurements taken prior to 
the participant receiving study drug. 
9.2.1 Analysis of Efficacy 
9.2.1.1 Primary efficacy analysis 
The ITT Population will be the primary population for the efficacy analysis. Efficacy will also be 
analyzed using the FAS, mITT Population, and PP Population as supportive analyses. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent cha nge from Baseline to Day 84 in fasting LDL-C in 
the obicetrapib group compared to the placebo group. The primary endpoint will be analyzed using 
an analysis of covariance (ANC OVA) model with a fixed effe ct for the treatment group and 
covariate of Baseline LDL-C. The least squares (LS) mean, standard errors, and 2-sided 
95% confidence intervals for each treatment gr oup and for the mean di fference compared to 
placebo will be obtained. Model diagnostics fo r the ANCOVA model will be computed that 
include assessments for homogeneity of variance, nor mality of the residual s, and residual outliers. 
If substantial deviations from th e model assumptions are observed, then supportive analyses, such 
as an ANCOVA model assuming unequal variances or  non-parametric asse ssments, will be 
considered.

Clinical Study Protocol TA-8995-301 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 52 of 67 
Version 3.0, 18 May 2022 The primary estimand will correspond to a treatm ent policy estimand. The target population will 
comprise participants who are randomized into the study. The prim ary summary measure to access 
the treatment effect will be th e LS mean difference for the pr imary endpoint between obicetrapib 
and placebo based on the ANCOVA methodology. Th e primary estimand will be addressed using 
the in-study observation period (i e, including data collected post-treatment discontinuation or 
post-prohibited medication use). 
Missing data will be imputed for the primary efficacy analysis based on a pattern mixture model 
that uses a multiple imputation technique analyzed with ANCOVA w ith pre-specified fixed factors 
and covariates. If appropriate, based on the num ber of retrieved dropouts, missing measurements 
of non-retrieved dropouts will be modeled by known measurements from retrieved dropouts (ie, participants who remain in the study after treatment discontinuation) in the same treatment group. 
The imputation model will be fu rther clarified in the SAP. 
Additional sensitivity analyses may be carried out under seconda ry estimands and/or various 
assumptions for missing data. Full deta ils will be provi ded in the SAP. 
9.2.1.2 Secondary and exploratory efficacy analyses 
In order to control the Type I error rate, a fixed sequential testing procedure will be implemented. In a hierarchical step-down manner, the primary endpoint will be tested first, followed by the 
secondary efficacy endpoints in a pre-specified order. The pre- specified order of the hypothesis 
testing for the secondary endpoints will be descri bed in the SAP. No ad justment for multiple 
comparisons will be made for th e exploratory efficacy endpoints. 
Continuous secondary and explorat ory efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using similar methods 
as in the primary efficacy analysis. For the binary exploratory efficacy  endpoints, a logistic 
regression analysis will be perf ormed with model covariates of treatment group and Baseline 
LDL-C. Odds ratio and 95% confidence interval  for the odds ratio will be obtained. Nominal 
p-values will be provided when applicable. De scriptive and graphical summaries by treatment 
group will also be presented. 
Full details of the models and analyses to be performed will be provided in the SAP. 
9.2.2 Analysis of Safety 
The Safety Population will be the primary populati on for the safety analysis. All safety endpoints 
will be summarized descriptively. No statistical in ference will be applied to the safety endpoints. 
AEs will be categorized by primary system organ class and preferred term as coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulator y Activities category designations . Summaries of AEs, including 
the number and percentage of participants who experience an AE, will be provided. 
Laboratory values will be summa rized descriptively, including the change from Baseline, by 
treatment group, and overall. In addition, shift tables will be presented to describe the change in 
laboratory parameter values at post-Baseline vi sits using normal range categories (low, normal, 
and high). 
9.2.2.1 Analysis of ESIs 
Liver-associated enzymes and total bilirubin will be summarized by the value and change from 
Baseline in the value, by treatment group and vi sit. In addition, the number and percent of 
participants with abnorma l values for ALT, AST, and total b ilirubin will be summarized. These 
NewAmsterdam B.V. 
Clinical Study Protocol TA-8995-301 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 53 of 67 
Version 3.0, 18 May 2022 summaries of participants with abnormal values will be performed overall; by normal Baseline; and by abnormal Baseline for ALT, AST, and to tal bilirubin individua lly. Hy’s Law criteria 
(>3   ULN for either ALT or AST, with accompanying total bilirubin >2  ULN) will also be 
applied to the data. Any potential Hy’s Law cases will be listed separately. 
CK levels will be summarized by the value and change from Baseline in value, by treatment group 
and visit. In addi tion, the number and pe rcent of participants with abnormal CK values will be 
summarized. These summaries of participants with  abnormal CK values will be performed overall, 
by normal Baseline CK, and by abnormal Baseline CK. Values of CK from Baseline to EOT will 
be summarized by treatment group and by Baseline eGFR category. 
Cases of NODM will be recorded and summarized us ing the appropriate system organ class. These 
events will be summarized by se verity and relationship to study drug for each treatment group. 
Fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c will be monitored as specified in Appendix A. 
Baseline eGFR will be summarized  by treatment group for actual value and for Baseline eGFR 
categories. Shift tables of eG FR category from Baseline to EO T will be provided by treatment 
group. Shift tables of urine album in-creatinine ratio and urine protein-creatinine ratio from 
Baseline to EOT will be provided by treatment  group. Muscle-related abnormalities will be 
summarized by treatment group a nd by Baseline eGFR category. 
The number and percentage of participants receiv ing antihypertensive medi cation(s) treatment at 
Baseline with changes to antihypertensive medication(s) due to changes in blood pressure will be summarized by treatment group. 
Cases of macular degeneration will be recorded  and summarized using the appropriate system 
organ class. These events will be summarized by severity and relationship to study drug for each 
treatment group. 
9.2.3 Interim Analysis 
No interim analysis is  planned for the study. 
The study will be governed by a Steering Committee.  A DSMB will provide independent oversight 
of participan t safety.  
9.2.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent DSMB will monitor unblinded safe ty data, including blood pressure changes over 
time and the occurrence of  ESIs, during the study. 
Additional information is provi ded in the DSMB Charter.  
9.2.5 Sample Size Determination 
Enrollment of approximately 300 participan ts globally is pla nned for this study. 
Assuming an approximate 5% drop out  rate, approximately 285 partic ipants will be evaluable for 
efficacy. This sample size of at least 285 evaluabl e participants will provide more than 90% power 
to detect a 30% reduction of LDL-C (standard deviation 15%) le vels in the obicetrapib group 
compared to the placebo group at a 1-sided significance level of 0.025. This sample si ze will also 
contribute to sufficient particip ant exposure and safety data.

11.1 Ethical Conduct of the Study 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is an internationa l ethical and scientific quality standard for 
designing, conducting, recording,  and reporting studies that involve human participants. 
Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety, and wellbeing of 
study participants are protected, co nsistent with the principles th at have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and that th e clinical study data are credible. 
11.2 IRB/IEC 
The IRB/IEC will review all appropriate study doc umentation in order to safeguard the rights, 
safety, and wellbeing of participants. The study will only be conducted at sites where IRB/IEC 
approval has been obtained. The protocol, Inves tigator’s Brochure, ICF, advertisements (if 
applicable), written information given to the pa rticipants, safety updates,  annual progre ss reports, 
and any revisions to these documents will be pr ovided to the IRB/IEC by the Investigator in 
countries where submission is carried out by the st udy site to the IRB/IEC. In countries where the 
Sponsor is responsible for submission to regulatory authorities/IRB/IEC, the documents will be submitted by the Sponsor or by desi gnee based on Letter of Authorization. 
Federal regulations and Interna tional Council for Harmonisation (I CH) Guidelines require that 
approval be obtained fr om an IRB/IEC prior to participation of participants in research studies. 
Prior to study onset, the protocol, any protocol am endments, ICFs, advertisem ents to be used for 
participant recruitment, and any ot her written information regarding this study to be provided to a 
participant or participant’s legal guard ian must be approved by the IRB/IEC. 
No study drug will be released to the study site fo r dosing until written IRB/IEC authorization has 
been received by the Sponsor. 
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor or their de signee (ie, ) to obtain the approval of the 
responsible ethics committees according to the nati onal regulations. 
The study will only start at the respective study sites once the respective committee’s written 
approval has been given. 
11.3 Informed Consent 
The ICF and any changes to the ICF made during th e course of the study must be agreed to by the 
Sponsor or designee and the IRB/IE C prior to its use and must be in complianc e with all ICH GCP, 
local regulatory requirements,  and legal requirements.  
The Investigator must ensure that each study pa rticipant is fully informed about the nature and 
objectives of the study and possible risks associated  with participation and must ensure that the 
participant has been informed of  his/her rights to privacy. The I nvestigator will obtain written 
informed consent from each partic ipant before any study- specific activity is performed and should 
document in the source documentation that consen t was obtained prior to en rollment in the study. 
The original signed copy of the ICF must be main tained by the Investigator and is subject to 
inspection by a representative of the Sponsor, their representatives , auditors, the IRB/IEC, and/or 
regulatory agencies. A copy of the signed ICF will be given to the participant.

Version 3.0, 18 May 2022 11.4 Subject Card 
On enrollment in the study, the participant will receive a subject card to be carried at all times. The subject card will state that the participant is part icipating in a clinical research study, type of 
treatment, and contact deta ils in case of an SAE. 
11.5 Study Monitoring Requirements 
It is the responsibil ity of the Investigator to ensure that the study is c onducted in accordance with 
the protocol; Declaration of He lsinki; ICH GCP E6; 21 CFR Parts 11, 50 A and B, 54, and 56; and 
applicable legal and regulatory requirements acco rding to the country of conduct, and that valid 
data are entered into the eCRFs. 
To achieve this objective, the CRA’s duties are to aid the Investigator and, at the same time, the 
Sponsor, in the maintenance of complete, legible, well-organiz ed, and easily re trievable data. 
Before the enrollment of any participant in th is study, the Sponsor or their designee will review 
with the Investigator and study site personnel the following documen ts: protocol, Investigator’s 
Brochure, eCRFs and procedures  for their comp letion, informed consen t process, and the 
procedure for reporting SAEs. The Investigator will permit the Sponsor or thei r designee to monitor the study as frequently as 
deemed necessary to determine that data recordi ng and protocol adherence are satisfactory. During 
the monitoring visits, information recorded on the eCRFs will be verified against source 
documents and requests for clar ification or correction may be made. After the eCRF data are 
entered by the study site, the CRA will review the data for safety in formation, completeness, 
accuracy, and logical consistency. Computer programs  that identify data inconsistencies may be 
used to help monitor the clinical  study. If necessary, requests for clar ification or correction will be 
sent to Investigators. The Investig ator and his/her staff will be expected to cooperate with the CRA 
and provide any missing inform ation, whenever possible. 
All monitoring activities will be reported and archived. In addition, monitoring visits will be 
documented at the study site by signature and date on the study-specific monitoring log.

1. For participants who permanentl y discontinue from study treatment and who decline continued study participation , an ET Visit will be schedu led as soon as possible followed 
by an EOS Visit approximately 35 days later.  The ET Visit procedures are identical to the EOT Visit procedures. If the disconti nuation occurs at a specific onsite visit, this visit 
will become the ET Visit and EOT Visit proced ures should be followed. Participants who withdraw consent to all follow-up will b e asked about the reason(s) and will be 
assessed for the presence of any AEs. 
2. Assessment of laboratory eligibility crite ria will be based on central laboratory values obtained within timeframes defined in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
3. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed for females of child bearing potential only (p erformed locally using central laborato ry kit supplies). FSH will only be performed at 
Screening in females <55 years of age and postmenopausal, defined as 1 year since their last menstrual period. 
4. The physical examin ation should comprise a focused exa mination, which includes general, re spiratory, cardiovascular, abdomin al, and extremities evaluations; ophthalmological 
examination; and recording of weight and height. 
5. Height will be measured at Screen ing only and used to calculate BMI. 
 
6. Vital signs (consisting of heart rate and blood pressu re) will be measured as de scribed in Section 8.8. 
 
7. A single l2-lead ECG will be performed in the supine position after 10 minutes of rest. 
8. Participants must fast for a minimum of  8 hours prior to samples being collected.  
9. Samples should be collected pr ior to study drug administration. 
10. Urinalysis will be performed  locally by dipstick analyses from a sample of mid -stream urine. In case of abnormal results, m icroscopy and other assessments will be performed 
at the local laboratory and the abnormality recorded as an AE. 
11. A PK sample will be collected prior to study drug administration for trough  measurement of obicetra pib in plasma. At Visits  2, 5, and 7, participants should take study drug 
after a trough PK sample has been drawn. 
AE = adverse event; ApoA1 = apolipoprotei n A1; BMI = body mass index; CV = cardiovas cular; ECG = electrocardiogram; EOS = End o f Study; EOT = End of Treatment; 
ET = Early Termination; FSH = follicle-stim ulating hormone; hsCRP = high sensitivity C-reactive protein; Lp(a) = lipoprotein (a ); PK = pharmacokinetic(s); 
TSH = thyroid-stimulating hormone; UACR = urine albumin-creatin ine ratio; UPCR = urine protein-creatinine ratio; V = Visit.

measured for all participants by preparative ultracentrifugation, also referred to as beta quantification. At all other 
scheduled visits, LDL-C will be calculate d using the Friedewald equation unless TG 400 mg/dL ( 4.52 mmol/L) or 
LDL-C 50 mg/dL ( 1.30 mmol/L). If TG 400 mg/dL ( 4.52 mmol/L) or LDL-C 50 mg/dL ( 1.30 mmol/L), then 
LDL-C level will be  measured directl y by preparative ultracentrifu gation.

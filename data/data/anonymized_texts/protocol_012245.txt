BMS-936558 nivolumab
•HPV p16 test result available (performed lo cally or cen trally) for participants with 
oropharyngeal disease
•Patients must be of intermediate or high risk categories *:
•High risk:
Oral cavity, hypopharynx, larynx, oropharynx (p16 negative): St age III/ IV
Oropharynx (p16 positive): Stage  III (T4 any N or T1-3 N3) - irr espective of smoking status.
•Intermediate risk:
−Oropharynx (p16 positive): T3 N0-2 or T1-3 N2 disease if smokin g > 20 pack year history.
*TNM clinical staging according to AJCC version 8
Cohort 1 (cisplatin-ineligible participants) Specific Inclusion  Criteria (Arm A and Arm B)
•Physician assesses participant to be non-eligible for treatment  with platinum based combined 
CRT. This must be for one or more of the following reasons:
−Age ≥70 year s at enrolment
−Creatinine clearance < 60mL/min and > 30mL/min (using the Cockc roft and Gault 
formula– see below**)
−Severe hearing loss (minimal hearing threshold of 80 dB or more  in either ear)
Cohort 2 (cisplatin-eligible participants) Specific Inclusion C riteria (Arm C and Arm D)
•Adequate renal function within 28 days prior to rando mization as follows:
−Creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min. as determined by 24 hour collection or estimated by 
Cockcroft-Gault formula:
CCr={((140–age in years) x weight in Kg)/(72 x serum creatinine in  mg/dL)}
(for females, multiply t he result by 0.85)**
**Participants aged ≥ 70 years may enter either Cohort 1 or 2 d ependent on whether the physician’s assessment is that 
the participant is eligible for cisplatin (Cohort 2) or ineligi ble for cisplatin (Cohort 1) based on their age. It is 
anticipated that in the majority of cases, patients aged ≥ 70 y ears will be considered ineligible for cisplatin and 
enter cohort 1.  If the subject has poor renal function as one of the acceptable inclusion criteria, the subject will 
be enrolled under inclusion criter ia 3) ii) and must meet the req uirement for Cr eatinine clearance < 60 mL/min 
and > 30mL/min (using the Cockcroft and Gault formula) .
Key Exclusion Criteria:
•Carcinoma originating in the nasopharynx or paranasal sinus, sq uamous cell carcinoma that 
originated from the skin and salivary gland or non-squamous his tology (eg, mucosal 
melanoma), squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary
•Clinical or radio logical evid ence of metastatic disease

Therapy (IMRT) starting at w3d1. Alternate fractionation scheme s are not allowed.
Participants who are randomized to a placebo arm do not need to  delay the start  of radiotherapy. 
For subjects randomized to Cohort 1 Arm B, cetuximab may be adm inistered at w1d1 and 
radiotherapy at w2d1. For participants randomized to Cohort 2 A rm B, cisplatin and radiotherapy 
may begin at w1d1.
Imaging will occur at baseline (within 28 days prior randomizat ion. Per Revised Protocol 03, 
subsequent imaging assessments should be performed according to  the timing of local standard of 
care. 
The Follow-up stage begins when protocol specific treatment wit h nivolumab is completed or the 
decision t o discontinue a participant from study therapy is made  (no further treatmen t with study 
therapy). Participants will have the first follow-up visits (FU 1 and FU2) approximately 30 days 
and 100 days, respectively, from the last dose of study therapy  or coinciding with the date of 
discontinuation and AEs will be followed until the toxicities r esolve, return to baseline, or are 
deemed irreversible.
All participants should continue to have tumor scans per local standards of care. .

and cisplatin eligible locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).
The study consists of two independent cohorts: 
•Cohort 1 w ill ra ndomize participants who are ineligible for cisplatin chemother apy based 
either on age (≥ 70 years), and/or poor renal function (Creatinine  clearance < 60 mL/min),
and/or have documented hearing loss (minimal hearing threshold of 80 dB or more in either 
ear) to receive nivolumab in combination with radiotherapy (RT) or  cetuximab in combination 
with RT.
•Cohort 2 w ill ra ndomize participants who are eligible to receive cisplatin base d therapy to 
receive nivolumab or placebo in combination with cisplatin and R T. 
As of 15-Oct-2018, enro llment into the study was closed (see Se ction 3.1.1 ). Participants who have 
signed an informed consent as of 15-Oct-2018 and are in the scr eening period will be able to be 
randomized. All participants receiv ing treatment will have the option to continue treatment under 
the updated Revised Protocol 03. At approval and implementation  of Revised Protocol 03, all 
enrolled participants must be re-consented prior to continuing treatment on the study. Under 
Revised Protocol 03 only safety assessments will be c onducted as part of study procedures.
Participants will be monitored until 100 days post-last dose.

participants with cisplatin ineligible and cisplatin eligible l ocally advanced squamous cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck (LAD SCCHN).
As of 15-Oct-2018, enrollment into the study was closed. At imp lementation of Revised Protocol 
03, the study will be unblinded. Placebo treatments will no lon ger be given. 
For Cohort 1 (cisplatin ineligible), participants must be eithe r age ≥ 70 years, and/or have 
creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min, and/or have documented hearing lo ss (minimal hearing 
threshold of 80 dB or more in either ear). There is no minimum o r maximum number of participants 
that must fulfill any of these criteria. For Cohort 2 (cisplatin  eligible), participants eligible for 
cisplatin based CRT must have cisplatin eligible disease. Participants will be stratified as follows:
•Cohort 1 (cisplatin ineligible), participants will be stratifie d by PD-L1 tumor expression (≥1% 
vs < 1% or indeterminate), risk category (intermediate vs. high  risk), and Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS [0 vs 1]) and randomize d in a 1:1 ratio to one 
of the study arms (Arms A or B). 
•Cohort 2 (cisplatin eligible), participants will be stratified by PD-L1 tumor expre ssion (≥1% 
vs < 1% or indeterminate) and risk category (intermediate vs. high  risk), and ECOG PS [0 vs 
1]) and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the study arms (Arms  C or D). 
HPV p16 testing can be performed locally or centrally and is re quired for entry into the study for 
participants with oropharyngeal disease. For subjects with oroph aryngeal cancer, sites are defined 
in Appendix 11.
After participants sign an informed consent, a tumor sample col lection is mandatory for PD-L1 
testing (shipped to a central lab). Sufficient, recent tumor ti ssue obtained within < 3 months prior 
to enrollment from a primary tumor lesion which has not been previously irradiated (formalin-
fixed paraffin-embedded block or minimum of 25 slides preferred, obtained from core biopsy, 
punch biopsy, excisional biopsy or surgical specimen) must be re ceived by a central lab. If the 
archival tissue is > 3 months old, a fresh biopsy must be obtain ed from core biopsy, punch biopsy, 
excisional biopsy or surgical specimen t o obtain sufficient tissue sample for PD-L1 testing (two
block or minimum of 25 slides preferred). Fine needle aspiration cytology is not acceptable. 
Biopsies of bone lesions that do not have a soft tissue compone nt are unacceptable for submission.
Participants should not have received any systemic anticancer t herapy after the date that the 
submitted tumor tissue was obtained. The PD-L1 analysis must be  processed with an available 
result prior to randomization..
A multidisciplinary case evaluation, including input from radia tion oncology, medical oncology 
and ENT/head and neck surgeon or equivalent functions is require d prior to randomization
(patients should have been seen by each of these groups or disc ussed at a multidisciplinary tumor 
board meeting). For larynx, hypopharynx, and base of tongue pri maries, a laryngopharyngoscopy 
(mirror and/or fiber optic and/or dir ect procedure) prior to randomization is required unless the 
participant cannot tolerate or refuses.

Participants in Cohort 1 (cisplatin ineligible) will be randomized 1:1 to either Arm A o r Arm B:
•Arm A will be administered nivolumab 240 mg for a single dose at w1d1  (C1 of cohort 1) then 
nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks for a total of 3 doses starting at w3d1 (C3, C6, C9 of cohort 
1). Then, participants will be administered nivolumab 480 mg ev ery 4 weeks for a total of 6 
doses.
•Arm B will be administer ed cetuximab 400 mg/m2as a single dose at w2d1 (C2 of cohort 1) 
then 250 mg/m2IV every week for a total of 7 doses starting at w3d1 (C3 to C9 of cohort 1)
with IMRT.
Participants in Cohort 2 (cisplatin eligible) will be randomized 1:1 to either Arm C or Arm D.
•Arm C will be administered nivolumab 240 mg for a single dose at w1d1  (C1 of cohort 2) then 
nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks for a total of 3 doses starting at w3d1 (C2, C3, C4 of cohort

starting at w3d1 (C2 of cohort 2) with IMRT. Then, participants will be administered 
nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks for a total of 6 doses.
•Arm D will be administered cisplatin 100 mg/m2every 21 days for 3 doses starting at w3d1 
(C2 of cohort 2) with IMRT. 
Participants in Cohort 1 (cisplatin ineligible) and Cohort 2 (c isplatin eligible) will receive RT to a 
total dose of 70 Gy in 35 fractions w hich will be administered i n daily doses of 2 Gy, typically on 
a 5 days on / 2 da ys off sche dule as appropriate, over 7 weeks by Intensity Modulated Radiation 
Therapy (IMRT) starting at w3d1. Alternate fractionation schemes  are not allowed. Sites must be 
equipped and qualified to deliver standard of care radiotherapy  in combination to the specified 
systemic agents. Radiotherapy will be subject to a Quality Assur ance (QA) process. This will 
involve site qualification/credentialization and real time revie w of radiotherapy plans with real 
time feedback to sites. On completion of radiotherapy all data must be submitted for final analysis. 
The radiotherapy requirements and QA processes w ill be the subject of a separ ate manual. QA 
services will be provided by  an external vendor. 
After randomizatio n, participants must co mmence syst emic treatm ent within 3 days. Participants 
should not d elay starting systemic tr eatment in order to complete radiotherapy QA. Following 
initial sys temic treatment, sites have 14 days to complete radiotherapy pl anning and QA before 
starting RT at w3d1.
Participants who are randomized to a placebo arm do not need to  delay the start  of radiotherapy. 
For subjects randomized to Cohort 1 Arm B, cetuximab may be adm inistered at w1d1 and 
radiotherapy at w2d1. For participants randomized to Cohort 2 A rm B, cisplatin and radiotherapy 
may begin at w1d1.
Imaging will occur at baseline (within 28 days prior randomizat ion. Per Revised Protocol 03, 
subsequent imaging assessments should be performed according to  the timing of local standard of

All participants should continue to have tumor scans per local s tandards of care. .
5.1.1 Data Monitoring Committee and Other External Committees
5.1.1.1 Data Monitoring CommitteeA Data Monitori ng Committee (DMC) w ill be u tilized to provide general oversight and safety 
considerations for this study, CA2099TM. The DMC will provide a dvice to the Sponsor regarding 
actions the committee deems necessary f or the continuing protection of subjects enrolled in this 
study. The DMC will be charged with assessing such actions in l ight of an acceptab le safety  profile 
for nivolumab. The DMC will act in an advisory capacity to BMS and will monitor subject safety 
data for the study. The DMC will be advisory to the clinical st udy leadership team. The clinical 
study leadership will have re sponsibility for overall conduct o f the study including managing the 
communication of study data. The group w ill be res ponsible for promptly reviewing the DMC 
recommendations, for providing guidance regarding the continuat ion or termination of the study, 
and for determining whether amendments to the protocol or chang es to the study conduct are 
required.
Details of the DMC responsibilities and procedures will be spec ified in the DMC charter.
When required, adjudicated events will be submitted to the DMC and Health Authori ties for review 
on a specified timeframe in accordance with the adjudication do cumentation.
5.1.2 Radiotherapy Quality Assurance
Radiation Therapy (RT) QA for this study consists of 3 component s.  
1) Sites will undergo radiation therapy credentialing prior to e nrolling patients on study. 
2) The RT treatment plans for all patients w ill have a pre-tr eatment central review prior to the 
start of radiation therapy. F eedback will be provided to the tr eating site within 72 hours of 
receipt of the treatment plan.
3) At the completion of radiation therapy documentation of the c ourse of treatment delivered will 
be submitted for central review. A summary of the delivered radi ation therapy and compliance 
with protocol requirements will be provided to BMS for the part icipant record.
Qualification of site for delivery of radiotherapy will be base d on ongoing radiation quality 
assurance activities, including site credentialing and rapid re view of radiotherapy plans. The RT 
QA data submission requirements and protocol compliance criteri a are detailed in the RT QA 
Manual.

The infusion duration of nivoluma b is 30 minutes and for cetuxi mab is infusion duration is over 2 
hours for 400 mg/m2and 1 hour for the 250 mg/m2, see Section 7.1.2 . The start and stop times of 
the infusions should be documented. 
7.1.1 Nivolumab Dosing
Participants should begin study treatment within 3 calendar days  of treatment assignment. 
Participants should receive nivolumab as a 30-minute i nfusion starting on Day 1 Cycle 1 at 240 
mg, then after 2 weeks (-2/+3 day s) 360 mg for 3 doses Q3W (± 3 day s), then at 480 mg for 6 
doses Q4W. Cycles differ between Cohorts. Refer to Table 7.1-2 for Cohort 1 and Table 7.1-3 for 
Cohort 2 when nivolumab is administered by cycle.
There will be no dose escalations or reductions of nivolumab al lowed. Participants may be dosed 
no less than 12 days from the previous dose during Q2W cycles. F or the Q3W (360 mg nivolumab) 
dosing, participants may be dosed no less than 18 days from the  previous dose. For Q4W dosing 
cycles, participants may be dosed within a ±7 day window. Premedications are not recommended 
for the first dose of nivolumab. Refer to Table 7.1-2 for details on dosing schedule for 
administration of nivolumab in Cohort 1 and Table 7.1-3 for Cohort 2.
Participants should be carefully monitored for infusion reactio ns during nivolumab a dministration. 
If an acute infusion reaction is noted, participants should be managed according to Section 7.4.7 .
Doses of nivolumab may be interrupted, delayed ( Section 7.4.1 ), or discontinued ( Section 8.1.1 )
depending on how well the participant tolerates the treatment.
Nivolumab Injection, 100 mg/10 mL (10 mg/mL) and 40 mg/mL (10 m g/mL) is to be administered 
as an IV i nfusion th rough a 0.2-micron to 1.2-mic ron pore size, low- protein binding in-line filter 
at the protocol-specified doses. It is not to be administered a s an IV push or bolus injection. When 
the dose is based on patient weight (i.e., mg/kg), nivolumab in jection can be infused undiluted 
(10 mg/mL) or diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP o r 5% Dextrose Injection, USP 
to protein concentrations as low as 0.35 mg/mL. W hen the dose i s fixed (e .g., 240 mg f lat dose), 
nivolumab injection can be infused undiluted or diluted so as n ot to exceed a to tal infusio n volume

of 120 mL. Nivolumab  infusion must be promptly followed by a s aline flush to clear the line. 
Instructions for dilution and infusion of nivolumab injection m ay be provided in the clinical 
protocol, pharmacy binder, or pharmacy reference sheet. Care mu st be taken to assure sterility of 
the prepared solution as the product does not contain any antimi crobial preservative or 
bacteriostatic agent.
On cycles where nivolumab and cetuximab or cisplatin needs to be administered on the same day,
nivolumab should be administered first using separate i nfusion bags and filter s. The infusion of 
cetuximab or cisplatin s hould occur no ear lier than 30 minutes after the completion of t he 
nivolumab infusion.
7.1.2 Cetuximab
For countries in which BMS is providing packaged/labeled cetuxi mab, please refer to package 
insert, summary of product characteristics (SmPC), or similar d ocument for details regarding drug 
preparation, administration and use t ime.
For countries where local sourcing of cetuximab is permitted, p roduct should be stored, prepared 
and administered in accordance to the package insert, su mmar y of product characteristics (SmPC) 
or similar document.
For participants in Cohort 1, cetuximab init ial dose of  400 mg/m2(over 2 hour infusion) is given 
on Day 1 Cycle 2, then weekly (± 3 days) at 250 mg/m2(over 1 hour infusion) for 7 weeks (C3 to 
C9 in cohort 1). Refer to Table 7.1-2 for when cetuximab is administered by cycle.
7.1.2.1 Cetuximab supportive care
CAUTION: Infusion reactions may o ccur during or following cetux imab administration. 
Most infusion reactions occur with the first infusion of cetuxi mab, but some patients’ first 
infusion reactions have been reported following subsequent dose s. The infusion reaction may 
occur during the infusion or be delayed until any time after th e infusion.
All patients will be pr emedicated with diphenhydramine hydrochloride, 50 mg, (or an eq uivalent 
antihistamine) by IV 30-60 minu tes prior to the first dose of ce tuximab in an effort to prevent an 
infusion reaction. For the initial dose of cetuximab of 400 mg/m2, the dose may be split to observe 
for signs of an infusion react ion. An initial dose of 100 mg/m2may be given and if no signs of an 
infusion r eaction are observed 30 minutes after the end of the infusion, the remaining 300 mg/m2
may be given.
The routine use of systemic steroids for premedication is not nec essary and may interfere with anti 
PD-1 activity. If considered absolutely necessary, systemic hig h dose steroids are allowed as 
premedication for the first dose of cetuximab and only as clini cally indicated for the subsequent 
doses. Topical steroids are acceptable.
For cetuximab, the recommended premedication is with an H1 anta gonist (e.g., 50 mg 
Diphenhydramine) IV 30-60 minutes prior to the first dose; for subsequent doses, premedication 
should be administered based upon clinical judgement and presen ce/severity of prior infusion 
reactions in accordance with local  institutional standard of prac tice.

It is recommended that the medical staff closely observe partic ipants for treatment-related adverse 
events, especially infusion reactions (see Section 7.4.2.4 for management) during the cetuximab 
infusion per local institutional standards.
For subsequent infusions, it is recommended that the participan ts be observed for 1 hour post-
infusion.
Doses of cetuximab may be interrupted, delayed, or discontinued  depending on how well the 
participant tolerates the tr eatment. For more  details see Sectio ns dose delays ( 7.4.2 ), dose 
reductions ( 7.4.2 ), resuming treatment ( 7.4.4 ), and 8.1discontinuation.
Participants should be carefully monitored for infusion reactio ns. If an acute infusion reaction is 
noted, participants should be managed according to Section 7.4.2.4 .
7.1.3 CisplatinFor participants in Cohort 2, cisplatin (100 mg/m
2IV) will begin dosing on Day 1 Cycle 2 and 
then every 21 days (± 3 days); participants are exp ected t o receive 3 doses but must have minimum 
2 doses. Individual investigators  may use institutional guidelin es for the administration of 
cisplatin. Refer to Table 7.1-3 to when cisplatin is administered by cycle.
Doses of cisplatin may be interrupted, delayed, or discontinued  depending on how well the 
participant tolerates the treatment. For more details, see Sections  7.4.3 (dose delays), 7.4.3.1 (dose 
reductions), 7.4.4 (resuming treatment), and 8.1(discontinuation).
7.1.3.1 Cisplatin supportive care
Institutional or National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) gu idelines or local guidance 
should be followed for cisplatin supportive care. Hydration gui delines may be modified at the 
discretion of the treating physician provided adequate pre- and post-cisp latin hydration is achieved, 
and renal function remains adequate. One suggested regimen cons ists of administering cisplatin in 
500 cc to 1000 cc of IV fluids following adequate hydration and the establishment of adequate 
urinary output. It is suggested the pre-cisplatin hydration con sist of NS at 500 cc/hr. x 1 liter and 
post-cisplatin hydration consis t of 1/2 NS + 10 meq KCl/liter +  1 gram magnesium  sulfate/liter + 
25 grams mannitol/liter at 500 cc/hr. for at least one hour, fol lowed by additional hydration at the 
discretion of the investigator.
It is suggested that participants receive antiemetic therapy, ac ute and delayed, including 
dexamethasone, 5-HT3 serotonin receptor antagonists. However, t he specifics of the regimen are 
at the discretion of the treating investigator, provided adequa te control is achieved. One potential 
regimen consists of 20 mg of oral or IV dexamethasone and a hig h dose of oral or IV 5-HT3 
antagonist (such as 2 mg oral  or 10 mcg/kg IV graniset ron, or 32 mg oral or IV ondansetron) on 
the day of cisplatin administration. Followed by additional ant i-emetics consisting of oral 
dexamethasone and scheduled 5-HT3 serotonin receptor antagonist s on days 2-5. For example, 
8 mg orally, twice daily for days 2 and 3, and then 4 mg orally,  twice daily for days 4 and 5, 
especially if an aprepitant is not given. On the day of chemoth erapy administration, the dose of 
dexamethasone must be reduced by 50%, if an aprepitant is given .

For cisplatin, the recommended premedications are dexamethasone (dosing according to local 
standard; an equivalent dose of another corticosteroids may be substituted) and a 5-HT3 receptor 
antagonist (type per investigator discretion and local standard s of care) prior to each dose. 
Additional use of emetics premedication may be employed at the discretion of the investigator. 
Refer to the local product label for more detail.
7.1.4 Radiotherapy
All participating institutions must be credentialed for head and  neck IMRT prior to enrolling 
participants in this study. See Section 5.1.2 for details.
Intensity Modulated Radiation The rapy (IMRT) is mandatory for t his study. Proton therapy is not 
permitted.
IMRT will be given in 35 fractions over 7 weeks beginning at Da y 1 Cycle 3 for Cohort 1 or Day 
1 Cycle 2 for Co hort 2, 5 fractions per week (both corresponding  to (w3d1). 
Full details of radiation therapy are provided in an accompanyi ng radiation therapy manual. 
The first fraction of RT should be delivered on a Monday or Tue sday, but this may vary according 
to local treatment plan. Five fractions should be delivered a we ek. Randomization and dosing 
should be timed such that the first dose of nivolumab occurs 14  ± 3 days prior to the start of 
radiotherapy. 
7.2 Method of Treatment Assignment
All participants w ill be assigned to tr eatment using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT). 
Users will receive log in informatio n and directions on how to access the IRT. Study tr eatment 
will be dispensed at the study vi sits as listed in Schedule of Activities ( Section 2 ).
As of 15-Oct-2018, enrollment in the study is closed. Participa nts with signed informed consent 
as of the 15-Oct-2018 may be randomized to treatment. 
7.3 Blinding
Per approval and implementation of Revised Protocol 03, the stu dy will be unblinded.
7.4 Dosage Modification
7.4.1 Nivolumab Dose Delay 
If adverse events prevent the administration of nivolumab, the participant should continue to 
receive other study therapies.
Nivolumab administration should be delayed for the following:
•Grade 2 non-skin, drug-related adverse event, with the exception  of fatigue
•Grade 2 drug-related creatinine, AST, ALT and/or Total Bilirubi n abnormalities
•Grade 3 skin, drug-related adverse event
•Grade 3 drug-related laboratory abnormality, with the following  exceptions: 
−Grade 3 lymphopenia or asymptomatic amylase or lipase does not require dose delay

BMS-936558 nivolumab
•Grade ≥3 AST, ALT, Total Bilirubin will require dose discontinuation ( see Section 8.1.1 )
•Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illn ess which, in the judgment of 
the investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medicatio n.
Participants who require delay of nivolumab should be re-evalua ted weekly or more frequently if 
clinically indicated and resume nivolumab dosing when re-treatm ent criteria are met.
In case of RT delay due to technical issues (instrument breakdo wn), continue systemic treatment 
as planned.
7.4.1.1 Rescheduling Nivolumab Treatment After Dose Delay
•If nivolumab is delayed during the combined radiotherapy phase,  radiotherapy should 
continue unless there is a specific reason to discontinue both nivolumab and 
radiotherapy. It is anticipated that the majority of immune rel ated AEs that require 
nivolumab delay or discontinuation will not require delay or dis continuation of 
radiotherapy
•If nivolumab is delayed, the criteria for restarting nivolumab should be adhered to 
independent of whether the participant is receiving concurrent radiotherapy
•In the event of delay of nivolumab dosing during combined radio therapy/nivolumab 
treatment, participants should r eceive 480 mg Q4W as soon after completion of radiotherapy 
as possible (at the earliest week 10), i.e., patients may recei ve fewer than 3 doses of 360 mg 
Q3W
•In the event of dose delay during nivolumab maintenance dosing,  all 6 doses of nivolumab 
480 mg Q4W should be given, up to a maximum duration of 40 weeks
•In the event of delay to radiotherapy requiring radiotherapy be yond week 11, 480 mg IV
Q4 dosing should be substituted with 240 mg IV Q2 dosing until the r adiotherapy is 
complete
7.4.2 Cetuximab Dose Modifications and Delay 
If adverse events prevent the administration of cetuximab, the participant should continue to 
receive radiation therapy.
In the event of cetuximab treatment delay, there will be no rel oading cetuximab infusion. Resume 
at the appropriate dose as indicated in Table 7.4.2-1 .

Grade 1: 
Mild transient reaction;
infusion interruption not 
indicated; intervention not

when the drug is restarted. For reactions manifesting only as d elayed drug 
fever, consider administering prophylactic antihistamine medica tions for 
subsequent doses.  Maintain the cetuximab dose.  Acetaminophen or a non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) may be administered pr ior to 
subsequent cetuximab infusions, if not otherwise contraindicate d in 
participants.
Grade 2:
Therapy or infusion interruption 
indicated but responds promptly 
to symptomatic treatment (eg, 
antihistamines, NSAIDS, 
narcotics, IV fluids); 
prophylactic medications 
indicated for ≤ 24 hrsFor moderate infusion reactions, slow the infusion rate for cet uximab by 50% 
when the drug is restarted and consider administering antihista mine 
medications and/or steroidal medications. Maintain the cetuxima b dose.  
Acetaminophen or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)  may be 
administered prior to subsequent cetuximab infusions, if not ot herwise 
contraindicated in participants.

responsive to symptomatic 
medication and/or brief
interruption of infusion); 
recurrence of symptoms

require immediate interruption of cetuximab infusion and perman ent 
discontinuation from further treatment with cetuximab. Appropri ate medical 
therapy including epinephrine, corticosteroids, diphenhydramine , 
bronchodilators, and oxygen should be available for use in the treatment of 
such reactions. Patients should be carefully observed until the  complete 
resolution of all signs and symptoms.
aStudy Therapy Retreatment Following Infusion Reactions: Once a cetuximab infusion rate has been decreased due  
to an infusion reaction, it will remain decreased for all subse quent infusions. If the pa rticipant has a  second infusion  
reaction > grade 2 with the slower infusion rate, the infusion s hould be stopped, and the patient should receive no  
further cetuximab treatment. If a patient experiences a Grade 3  or 4 infusion reaction at any time, the patient should  
receive no further cetuximab treatment. If there is any questio n as to whether an obse rved reaction is an infusion  
reaction of Grades 1-4, the Study Director and Medical Monitor s hould be contacted immediately to discuss and  
grade the reaction.
7.4.2.5 Cetuximab Related Rash
Manifestations: Rash associated with EGFR-inhibitors is a relat ively new dermatologic condition. 
It appears to be “acneiform” but it is NOT considered a form of  acne; rather, it is a form of 
folliculitis. Skin changes may be manifested in a number of way s: erythema; fo llicle based papules, 
which may ulcerate; pain; itchi ng; cosmetic disturbance; and/or  nail dis orders. The rash may 
become infected and transform into cellulitis.
Grading of Cetuximab-induced Rash: According to physician judgm ent, if a participant
experiences ≥ Grade 3 rash (according to either the “outside of  the radiation field” or the “inside 
of the radiation field” definitions below), cetuximab tr eatment adjustments s hould be made 
according to the Cetuximab Dose Modification tables ( Table 7.4.2.5-1 and Table 7.4.2.5-2 ). In 
participants with mild and moder ate skin adverse events, cetuximab should continue without 
adjustment.
NOTE : Rash intensity (i.e., the size and number of papules or the l evel of discomfort and extent 
of erythema) may be an important consideration. However, the ab solute number of lesions, 
without associated physical discomfort , does not necessarily constitute a basis for a dose 
reduction or delay. Rash considered “intolerable” (because of p ain, itching, or appearance) or that 
has failed to respond to symptomatic management may be consider ed Grade 3 and thus prompt 
dose reduction or delay of cetuximab. The clinical judgment of the treating physician is critical 
to grading and will ultimately dictate dose modification.

Acute Skin Changes: 
•Rash Occurring Outside of the Radiation Field: Should be graded  using the following CTCAE, 
v. 4 terms. A rash complicated by secondary infection or cellulitis s hould be graded per 
additional CTCAE terms (see Table 7.4.2.5-1 ).
•Rash Occurring Inside the Radiation Field: Acute radiation derm atitis may be exacerbated by 
cetuximab or chemotherapy. The severity of such rash s hould be graded using CTCAE,  v. 4 
criteria for radiation dermatitis (see Table 7.4.2.5-2 ). 
•Late Skin Changes: A potential late change of interest is conse quential scarring/pock marking 
in or out of the radiation field. This may be reported by using  the MedDRA code, “Skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders - Other, specify” with the followin g protocol-specific grading 
scale as guidance:
−Grade 1: Mild (seen onl y on close inspection)
−Grade 2: Moderate (scarring, intervention or cosmetic coverage/ intervention indicated)

Drug-Related Rash Management: Participants developing dermatolog ic adverse events while 
receiving cetuximab should be monitored for  the development of inflammatory or infectious 
sequelae, and appropriate treatment of these symptoms initiated . Below are suggestions for 
managing cetuximab-induced rash75:
•Antibiotics : The benefit of routine antibiotics in uncomplicated (uninfect ed) rash is unclear, 
though the early use of tetracycline based antibiotics early is  encouraged. Prophylactic used is 
also permissible. R ash complicated by cellulitis should be trea ted with appropriate antibiotics 
based on clinical judgment or microbial sensitivity analysis.
•Antihistamines : Benadryl or Atarax may be helpful to control itching.
•Topical Steroids : The benefit of topical steroids is unclear.
•Retinoids : No data to support use. Use is not advised.
•Benzoyl peroxide : Should NOT be used as th is may aggravate rash.
•Makeup : Rash can be covered with makeup; this should not make it wors e (use a 
dermatologist-approved cover-up, e.g., Dermablend®, or any other type of foundation). 
Remove makeup with a skin-friendly liquid cleanser, e.g., Neutr ogena®, Dove®, or Ivory Skin 
Cleansing Liqui-Gel®.
•Moisturizers : Use emollients to prevent and  alleviate the skin dryness, e.g ., Neutrogena®
Norwegian Formula Hand Cream®or Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Healing Lotion®.
•Sunlight : It is recommended that participants wear sunscreen and hats an d limit sun exposure
while receiving cetuximab as sunlight can exacerbate any skin r eactions that may occur.
•Over-the-counter medications : Over-the-counter acne vulgaris medications (e.g., benzoyl 
peroxide) are not advised. This rash is not like acne vulgaris and these treatments could make 
it worse.
7.4.2.6 Treatment Of Isolated Drug Fever
In the event of isolated drug fever, the investigator must use clinical judgment to determine if the 
fever is related to the study drug or to an infectious etiology .
If a participant experiences isolated drug fever, for the next d ose, pre-treat with acetaminophen or 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (investigator discretion) , repeat antipyretic dose 6 and 12 
hours after cetuximab i nfusion. The infusion r ate w ill remain unchanged for future dose. If a

BMS-936558 nivolumab
participant experiences recurrent isolated drug fever following pre-medication and post-dosing 
with an appropriate antipyretic, the infusion rate for subseque nt dosing should be 50% of previous 
rate. If fever recurs following infusion rate change, the inves tigator should assess the participant’s 
level of discomfort with the event and use clinical judgment to  determine if the patient s hould 
receive further cetuximab.
7.4.2.7 Rescheduling Cetuximab Treatment After Dose Delay
Weekly cetuximab will continue if radiation therapy is being he ld. If cetuximab is omitted for 
more than 4 consecutive infusions for adverse events due to cetu ximab, or for an intercurrent 
illness (e.g., infection) requi ring interruption of therapy, th e participant should be discontinued 
from further cetuximab therapy. If adverse events prevent the a dministration of cetuximab, the 
participant may continue to receive nivolumab/placebo and radiat ion therapy. 
If a dose of cetuximab is omitted, it w ill not be made up or added to the end of tr eatment. The 
omitted dose and the reason for the omission should be recorded  in the site’s source documentation.
7.4.3 Dose Modifications And Delay For Cisplatin
Note: If adverse events prevent the administration of cisplatin , the participant should continue to 
receive nivolumab and radiation therapy.
Cisplatin should be delayed for the following:
•Presence of febrile neutropenia or neutropenia < 1500 cells/mm3for greater than one week 
despite the use of growth factors
•Any Grade > 2 non-skin, drug-related adverse event, except for a lopecia, fatigue or laboratory 
abnormalities
•Any Grade 3 drug-related laboratory abnormality, with the follo wing exceptions:
−Grade 3 lymphopenia does not require a dose delay
−Delay if total bilirubin >1 x ULN or if AST and/or ALT > 1.5 x U LN occurs concomitant 
with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 x ULN
•Any AE, laboratory abnormality or inter-current illness which, in the judgment of the 
investigator, warrants skipping the dose of study medication.
Subsequent dose reductions may be required as per Section 7.4.3.1 . Participants may receive 
growth factors (including G-CSF and eryth ropoieti n) at the discretion of the investigator.
A dose given more than 3 days after the intended dose date will  be considered a dose delay.
A maximum delay of 6 weeks between doses is allowed. Longer del ays may be allowed following 
discussion with the Medical Monitor.
7.4.3.1 Dose Reductions for cisplatin
A maximum of 2 dose reductions are permitted; if additional red uctions are required, cisplatin 
must be discontinued. Once a dose has been decreased, it should remain reduced for all subsequent 
dosing unless dose is further reduced. No dose escalations will be allowed. Participants who

discontinue cisplatin may, at the investigators discretion, conti nue administration of the other study 
drugs in the regimen.  
Recommendations for dose mo difications for cisplatin shoul d be considered with local institutional 
standards. The dose levels for cisplatin are listed in Table 7.4.3.1-1 .

7.4.3.2 Recommended Cisplatin Dose Modifications for Hematologic Toxicity
Dose adjustments are based on nadir blood counts since the prec eding chemotherapy 
administration. Dose level adjustments are relative to that of the preceding administration and are 
described in Table 7.4.3.2-1.

Platelets < 50,000/mm3with significant bleeding or requiring 
blood transfusionDecrease 1 dose level
Grade 4 hemoglobin (< 6.5 g/100 mL) Decrease 1 dose level
aIf considered in the best inter est of the par ticipant, and cons istent with local practice, investigators may decide to  
use supportive measures/treatment, and/or secondary prophylaxis  instead of dose reductions for the next cycle.  
Also, if toxicity can clearly  be attributed to one of the drugs , the investigator may choose to only dose reduce the  
cytotoxic.
7.4.3.3 Recommended Dose Modifications for Non-Hematologic Toxicity
Dose adjustments for non-hematologic toxicity during treatment a re described in Table 7.4.3.3-1 . 
All dose modifications should be made based on the worst grade toxicity per CTCAE v4.0.

7.4.7 Treatment of Nivolumab Related Infusion Reactions
As nivolumab contains only human immunoglobulin protein sequences , it is unlikely to be 
immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensitivity reactions. However, if a reaction occurs, it 
may manifest as fever, chills, ri gors, headache, rash, pruritus, arthralgias, hypotension, 
hypertension, bronchospasm, or ot her allergic-like reactions. A ll Grade 3 or 4 i nfusion r eactions
should be reported within 24 hours to the BMS Study Medical Mon itor and reported as an SAE if 
it meets the criteria. Infusion reactions should be graded acco rding to NCI CTCAE (Version 4) 
guidelines.
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified  based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines, as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptoms : (mild reaction; infusion inte rruption not ind icated; intervention not 
indicated):
•Remain at bedside and monitor participant until recovery from s ymptoms. The following 
prophylactic premedications are r ecommended for future infusion s: diphenhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg  at least 30 minutes before 
additional nivolumab administration.
For Grade 2 symptoms : (moderate reaction required therapy or i nfusion inte rruption but responds 
promptly to symptomatic treatment (e.g., antihis tamines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids); prophy lactic medications indicated for ≤  24 
hours):
•Stop the nivolumab i nfusion, begin an IV infusion of  normal saline, and treat the p articipant 
with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminop hen/paracetamol 325 to 
1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor participant until resolu tion of symptoms. 
Corticosteroid and/or bronchodilator therapy may also be admini stered as appropriate. If the 
infusion is interrupted, then restart the i nfusion at 50% of the original infusion r ate when 
symptoms resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 mi nutes, the rate may be 
increased to 100% of the original infusion rate. Monitor partic ipant closely. If symptoms recur, 
then nivolumab will be not be administered at that visit.
•For future infusions, the following prophylactic premedications are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equi valent) and/or acetaminophen/para cetamol 325 to 1000 mg 
should be administered at least 30 minutes before nivolumab inf usions. If necessary, 
corticosteroids  (up to 25 m g of hydrocorti sone or equivalent) ma y be used.
For Grade 3 or 4 symptoms : (severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [i.e., not rapidly respo nsive to 
symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of symptoms following 
initial im provement; hospi talization indicated for other clinical sequelae (e.g. , renal impairment, 
pulmonary infiltrates). Grade 4: Life-threatening; pressor or v entilatory support indicated):
•Immediately discontinue infusion of nivolumab. Begin an IV infu sion of normal saline and 
treat the participant as follows: Recommend bronchodilators, epi nephrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a

1:1000 solution for subcutane ous administrati on or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution 
injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 5 0 mg IV with 
methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Partici pant should be monitored 
until the Investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will no t recur. Study drug w ill be 
permanently discontinued. Investigators should follow their ins titutional guidelines for the 
treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor partici pant until recovery of the 
symptoms.
In case of late-occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (e.g., appe arance of a localized or generalized 
pruritus within 1 week after t reatment), sympto matic treatment may be given (e.g., oral 
antihistamine or corticosteroids).
7.5 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area a ccording to local regulations. It is 
the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that investiga tional product is only dispensed to 
study Participants. The investigational product must be dispens ed only from official study sites by 
authorized personnel according to local regulations.
The product storage manager should ensure that the st udy tr eatment is stored in accordance with 
the environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity)  as determined by BMS. If 
concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the study treat ment arise, the study tr eatment 
should not be dispensed and contact BMS immediately.
Study treatment not supplied by BMS will be stored in accordanc e with the package insert.
Investigational product documentation (whether supplied by BMS or not) must be maintained that 
includes all processes required to ensure drug is accurately ad ministered. This includes 
documentation of drug stora ge, administration a nd, as applicable, storage temperatures, 
reconstitution, and use of required processes (e.g., required d iluents, administration sets).
Infusion-related supplies (e.g., IV bags, in-line filters, 0.9% sodium chloride injection, 5% 
dextrose injection) will not be supplied by the sponsor and sho uld be purchased locally if permitted 
by local regulations.
Please refer to the current version of the Investigator Brochur e (IB) and/or pharmacy manual for 
complete storage, hand ling, dispensing, and infusion informatio n for nivolumab, cetuximab,
cisplatin, and matching placebo. The pharmacy manual will refer t o the current SmPC for 
non-BMS investigational products. These products may be obtaine d by the investigational sites as 
local commercial product in countries where it is allowed by loc al regulations. Non-BMS 
investigational products s hould be prepared/stored/administered in accordance with the pa ckage 
insert or summary of  product characteristics (SmPC) or accordin g to institutional standards.
Further guidance and information for final disposition of unuse d study treatment are provided in

7.7.2.2 Imaging Restriction and Precautions
Per Revised Protocol 3, imaging will be performed according to local standard of care. 
It is the local imaging facility’s responsibility to determine,  based on participant attributes (e.g., 
allergy history, diabetic history and renal status), the appropriate imaging mo dality and contrast 
regimen for each participant. Imaging contraindications and con trast risks should be considered in 
this assessment. P articipants with re nal insufficiency s hould be a ssessed as to whether or not they 
should receive contrast and if so, what type and dose of contra st is appropriate. If CT is 
contraindicated for a participant because of an iodinated contra st allergy, then a contrast enhanced 
MRI of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis will be performed.
Specific to MRI, par ticipants with severe renal insufficiency ( i.e., estimated glomerular f iltration 
rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73m2) are at increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. MRI 
contrast should not be given to this participant population. Certain surgically-implanted devices 
(pacemaker, deep brain stimula tor, metallic implants, etc.) are  incompatible with MRI imaging. 
The local imaging facility and investigator s hould determine the appropriate precautions or 
guidelines that should be insti tuted for participants with tatt oos, body piercings or other body art.
The ultimate decision t o perform MRI in an individual participant in this study rests with the site 
radiologist, the investigator and the standard set by the local Ethics Committee.
. 
7.8 Treatment After the End of the Study
At the conclusion of the study, participants who continue to de monstrate clinical benefit will be 
eligible to receive BMS supplied study treatment for the maximum treatment duration specified 
in protocol Section 7.1 . Study treatment will be provided via an extension of the stud y, a rollover 
study requiring approval by responsible health authority and et hics committee or through another 
mechanism at the discretion of BMS.
BMS reserves the right to terminate access to BMS supplied stud y treatment if any of the following 
occur: a) the study is terminated due to safety concerns; b) th e development of the nivolumab is 
terminated for other reasons, including but not limited to lack of efficacy and/or not meeting the 
study objectives; c) the participant can obtain medication from  a government sponsored or private 
healt h program. In all cases BMS will follow local regulations.
8 DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA
8.1 Discontinuation from Study Treatment
Participants MUST discontinue  investigational product (and non- investigational product at the 
discretion of the investigator) for a ny of the following reasons:
•Participant’s request to stop study tr eatment. Par ticipants who request to discontinue study 
treatment w ill remain in the study and must continue to be followed for pr otocol specified 
follow-up procedures. The only exception to this is when a part icipant specifically withdraws

consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previou sly authorized by participant to 
provide this information
•Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality or inte rcurrent illness which, in the 
opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued participa tion in the study is not in the best 
interest of the participant
•Termination of the study by BMS
•Loss of ability to fr eely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily inca rceration 
for treatment of eit her a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious disease) illness. (No te: Under 
specific circumstances, a participant who has been imprisoned m ay be permitted to continue 
as a participant. Strict conditions apply and BMS approval is r equired.)
•Documented investigator-assessed progression by RECIST v1.1
Refer to the Schedule of Activities ( Table 2-4 ) for data to be collected a t the time of  treatment 
discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations t hat can be completed.
In the case of pregnancy, the investigator must immediately not ify the BMS Medical 
Monitor/designee of this event. In the event a normal healthy f emale participant becomes pregnant 
during a clinical trial, the study treatment must be discontinue d immediately. In most cases, the 
study treatment will be permanently discontinued in an appropri ate manner (e.g. , dose tapering if 
necessary for participant safety). Please call the BMS Medical Monitor within 24 hours of 
awareness of the pregnancy. If the investigator d etermines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio 
that warrants continuation of study treatment, a discussion bet ween the investigator and the BMS 
Medical Monitor/designee must occur.
All participants who discontinue study treatment should comply with protocol specified follow-up 
procedures as outlined in Section 2 . The only exception to this requirement is when a participant 
withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post-treat ment study follow-up or loses the 
ability to consent freely (i.e., is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either 
a psychiatric or physical illness).
If study treatment is discon tinued prior to the participant’s c ompletion of the study, the reason for 
the discontinuation must be documented in the participant’s medi cal records and entered on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF) page.
8.1.1 Nivolumab Dose Discontinuation
Nivolumab treatment should be permanently discontinued for the following:
•Any Grade 2 drug-related uveitis, e ye pain or blurred vision tha t does not respond to topical 
therapy and does not improve to Grade 1 severity within the re- treatment period OR requires 
systemic treatment
•Any Grade 3 non-s kin, drug-related advers e event lasting > 7 da ys or recurs, with the following 
exceptions for laboratory abnormalities, drug-related uveitis, p neumonitis, bronchospasm, 
neurologic toxicity, hypersensitivity reactions, infusion react ions, and endocrinopathies:
−Grade 3 drug-related uveitis, pne umonitis, bronc hospasm, neurol ogic toxicity, 
myocarditis, hypersensitivity reaction, or infusion reaction of a ny duration requires 
discontinuation

discontinuation regardless of  control with hormone replacement.  
−Grade 3 drug-related laboratory a bnormalities do not require tr eatment discontinuation 
except:
♦Grade 3 drug-related thrombocytopenia > 7 days or associated wi th bleeding requires 
discontinuation
♦Grade ≥3 drug-related AST, A LT or Total Bilirubin requires discontinua tion*
♦Concurrent AST or ALT > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin > 2x ULN
* In most cases of Grade 3 AST or ALT elevation, study drug(s) will be permanently discontinued. 
If the investigator determines a possible favorable benefit/ris k ratio that warrants continuation of 
study drug(s), a discussion between the investigator and the BMS  Medical Monitor/designee must 
occur.
•Any Grade 4 drug-related adverse event or laboratory abnormalit y (including but not limited 
to creatinine, AST, ALT, or Total Bilirubin), except for the fol lowing events which do not 
require discontinuation:
−Grade 4 neutropenia lasting ≤7 days
−Grade 4 lymphopenia or leukopenia or asymptomatic amylase or lip ase
−Isolated Grade 4 electroly te imbalances/abnormalities that are not associated with clinical 
sequelae and are corrected with supplementation/appropriate man agement within 72 hours 
of their onset
−Grade 4 drug-related endocrinopathy adverse events, such as, hyp er- or hypothyroidism, 
or glucose intolerance, which resolve or are adequately control led with physiologic 
hormone rep lacement (corticosteroids, thyroid hormones) or gluc ose-controlling agents, 
respectively, may not require discontinuation afte r discussion with an d approval from the 
BMS Medical Monitor.
•Any event that leads to delay in dosing lasting > 6 weeks from t he previous dose requires 
discontinuation, with the following exceptions:
−Dosing delays to allow for prolonged steroid tapers to manage d rug-related adverse events 
are allowed. 
−Dosing delays lasting > 6 weeks from the previous dose that occu r for non-drug-related 
reasons may be allowed if approved by the BMS medical monitor. 
Prior to re-initiating treatment in a participant with a dosing  delay lasting > 6 weeks, the BMS 
medical monitor must be consulted. Tumor assessments should cont inue as per protocol even if 
dosing is delayed. Periodic study visits to assess safety and l aboratory studies should also continue 
every 6 weeks or more frequently if clinically indicated during such dosing delays.
Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the parti cipant with continued nivolumab dosing.

8.1.2 Criteria to Resume Nivolumab Treatment
Participants may resume treatm ent with st udy drug when the drug -related AE(s) resolve to Grade 
≤1 or baseline value, with the following exceptions:
•Participants may resume treatm ent in the presence of Grade 2 fa tigue
•Participants who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug-related sk in AE may resume treatment 
in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity
•For participants with Grade  2 AST, ALT and/or Total Bilirubin A bnormalities, dosing may 
resume when laboratory values return to baseline and management  with corticosteroids, if 
needed, is complete.
•Participants with combined Grade 2 AST/ALT AND total bilirubin values meeting 
discontinuation parameters ( Section 8.1.1 ) should have treatment permanently discontinued. 
•Drug-related pulmonary tox icity, dia rrhea or colitis must have resolved to baseline before 
treatment is resumed. Participants with persistent Grade 1 pneu monitis after completion of a 
steroid taper over at least 1 month may be eligible for retreatm ent if discussed with and 
approved by BMS Medical Monitor.
•Participants with drug-related endocrinopathies adequately cont rolled with only physiologic 
hormone replacement may resume treatment after consultation wit h the BMS Medical 
Monitor. Adrenal insufficiency requires discontinuation regardl ess of control with hormone 
replacement.
8.1.3 Nivolumab Treatment Beyond Disease Progression
Treatment beyond investigator assessed progression will not be permitted on this study .T h e  
radiotherapy given in combination with nivolumab/cisplatin/cetu ximab are intended to be 
definitive treatment and any recurrence is likely to represent g enuine progression of the disease, if 
that recurrence/progression is non equivocal. In cases where pro gression is equivocal based on 
imaging findings, it is recommende d that a biopsy is performed t o further investigate radiological 
findings.
8.1.4 Cetuximab Dose Discontinuation
Specific details of AEs requiring discontinuation can be found in section 8.1 and Section 7.4.2 . 
8.1.5 Cisplatin Dose Discontinuation
See Section 8.1and Section 7.4.3 for criteria for discontinuation of study tr eatment.
8.1.6 Post Study Treatment Study Follow-up
Per Revised Protocol 03, overall survival follow  up is not required. Par ticipants will be followed 
for assessment of safety through 100 days post last dose of stu dy treatment. 
BMS may request that survival data be collected on all treated/ randomized participants outside of 
the protocol defined window ( Section 2 ). At the time of this request , each participant will be 
contacted to determine their survi val status unless the partici pant has withdrawn consent for all 
contacts or is lost to follow-up.

8.2 Discontinuation from the Study
Participants who request to disc ontinue study treatment will re main in the study and must continue 
to be followed for protocol sp ecified follow-up procedures. The  only exception to this is when a 
participant specifically withdraws consent for any further cont act with him/her or persons 
previously authorized by participant to provide this informatio n. 
•Participants should notify the i nvestigator of the decision to withdraw consent from future 
follow-up in writing , whenever possible.
•The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical rec ords by the 
investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is from further trea tment with study t reatment only 
or also from study proce dures and/or post treatment study follow-up, and entered on the  
appropriate CRF page.
•In the event that vital status (whether the participant is aliv e or dead) is being measured, 
publicly available information s hould be used to determine vital status only as appropriately 
directed in accordance with local law.
•If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future i nformation, the sponsor may 
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a wit hdrawal of consent.
8.3 Lost to Follow-Up
After 15-October-2018, follow-up is restricted to safety assess ments through the 100 days after 
the last day of dosing. 
•All reasonable efforts must be made to locate pa rticipants to d etermine and report their ongoing 
status. This include s follow-up with pers ons authorized by the participant.
•Lost to follow-up is defined by the inability to reach the part icipant after a minimum of three
documented phone calls, faxe s, or emails as well as lack of response by participant to one 
registered mail letter. All attempts should be documented in th e participant’s medical records.
•If it is determined that the participant has died, the site wil l use permissible local methods to 
obtain date and cause of death.
•If investigator’s use of third-party representative to assist i n the follow- up portion of the study 
has been included in the participant’s informed consent, then t he investigator may use a 
Sponsor retained third-party representative to assist site staf f with obtaining participant’s 
contact information or other public vital s tatus data n ecessary to complete the follow-up 
portion of the study. 
•The site staff and representative will consult publicly availab le sources, such as public h ealth 
registries and databases, in order to obtain updated contact in formation.
•If after all attempts, the participant remains lost to follow-u p, then the last known alive date as 
determined by the investigator should be reported and documente d in the participant’s medical 
records.

•All immediate safety concerns must be discussed with the Sponso r immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue 
treatment.
•Adherence to the study design requirements, including those spe cified in the Schedule of 
Activities, is essential and required for study conduct.
•All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to con firm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria before randomization . The investigator will maintain a 
screening log to record details of all participants screened an d to confirm eligibility or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable.
•Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clini cal management (e.g., blood 
count) and obtained before signing of informed consent may be u tilized for screening or 
baseline purposes provided the procedure meets the protocol-def ined criteria and has been 
performed within the timeframe defined in the Schedule of Activ ities ( Section 2 ).
•Additional measures, including non-study required laboratory te sts, should be performed as 
clinically indicate d or to comply with local regulations. Labor atory toxicities (e.g., suspected 
drug induced liver enzyme evaluations) will be monitored during  the follow-up phase via on 
site/local labs until all study drug related toxicities resolve, return to bas eline, or are d eemed 
irreversible.
•If a participant shows pulmonary-related signs (hypoxia, fever) or symptoms (e.g.. dyspnea,

immediately evaluated t o rule out pulmonary toxicity , according to the susp ected pulmonary 
toxicity management al gorithm in the BMS- 936558 (nivolumab) Investigator Brochure.
•Some of the assessments referred to in this section may not be captured as data in the eCRF. 
They are intended to be used as safety monitoring by the treati ng physician. Additional testing 
or assessments may be performed as clinically necessary or wher e required by institutional or 
local regulations.
9.1 Efficacy Assessments
9.1.1 Imaging Assessment for the Study
Per Revised Protocol 03, imaging assessments will be conducted per the schedule of local standard 
of care. Tumor imaging assessments for ongoing study tr eatment d ecisions will be comp leted by 
the investigator using RECIST v1.1 criteria (see Appendix 10)
Screening (baseline) tumor assessments of neck, chest, abdomen,  and pelvis are to be performed 
within 28 days prior to randomization. 
If the investigator assesses there to be progre ssion, study tre atments must discont inue; treatment 
beyond progression is not permitted in this protocol.

9.2 Adverse Events
The definitions of an AE or serious adverse event (SAE) can be found in Appendix 3 .
AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant's legally a uthorized repre sentative). 
Immune-mediated adverse events are AEs consistent with an immun e-mediated mechanism or 
immune-mediated component for which non-inflammatory etiologies (e.g., infection or tumor 
progression) have been ruled out. IMAEs can include events with  an alternate etiology which were 
exacerbated by the induction of a utoimmunity. I nformation suppo rting the assessment will be 
collected on the participant’s case report form.
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detectin g, documenting, and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain resp onsible for following up AEs that 
are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the s tudy, or that caused the participant to 
discontinue before completing the study. 
Contacts for SAE reporting specified in Appendix 39.2.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
The collection of nonserious AE information s hould begin at init iation of study treatment and 
continue during the treatment period and for a minimum of 100 d ays following discontinuation of 
study treatment, at the time point s specified in the Schedule of Activities ( Section 2 ). Nonserious 
AE information should also be collected from the start of a plac ebo lead-in period or other 
observational period intended to establish a baseline status fo r the participants.
All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening peri od and within 100 days of the last 
dose of study treatment. For participants randomized/assigned t o treatment and never treated with 
study drug, SAEs should be c ollected for 30 days from  the date of randomization.
Sections 5.6.1 a nd 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) repr esent the Reference Safety 
Information to d etermine expectedness of serious adverse events  for expedited reporting. 
Following the participant’s written consent t o par ticipate in the study, all SAEs, whether related 
or not related to stud y drug, must be co llected, including thos e thought to be associated with 
protocol-specified procedures.
If applicable, SAEs must be collected that relate to any later protocol-specified procedure (e.g., a 
follow-up skin biopsy).
The investigator must report any SAE that occurs after these ti me periods and that is believed to 
be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure.
•Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatm ent but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded on the appropriate section of the eCRF section.
•All SAEs will be rec orded and reported to Sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as i ndicated 
in Appendix 3. 
•The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponso r within 24 hours of this being 
available.

Date: 16-Nov-2018 83
5.0 Approved 930117157 5.0v
Clinical Protocol CA2099TM
BMS-936558 nivolumab
Investigators are not obligated  to actively seek AEs or SAEs in  former study participants. 
However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a dea th, at any time after a participant 
has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the ev ent reasonably related to the study 
treatment or study participatio n, the investigator must promptly  notify the sponsor.
The method of evaluating, and assessing caus ality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for 
completing and reporting/transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3 .
9.2.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
All nonserious adverse events (not only those deemed to be trea tment-related) should be collected 
continuously during the tr eatment period a nd for a minimum of  100 days following discontinuation 
of study treatment. 
Every adverse event must be assessed by the investigator with re gard to whether it is considered 
immune-mediated. For events which  are potentially immune-mediat ed, additional information will 
be collected on the participant’s case report form.
Adverse events can be spont aneously reported  or elicited  during open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a participant. Care should be take n not to introduce bias when 
collecting AE and/or SAEs. Inquiry about specific AEs should be g uided by clinical judgement in 
the context of known adverse events, when appropriate for the pro gram or protocol.
9.2.3 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
•Nonserious AEs should be follo wed to resolution  or stabilizatio n, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Appendix 3).
•Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause interr uption or discontinuation of 
study treatment and for those present at the end of study treat ment as appropriate.
• All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on  the nonserious AE page of 
the CRF (paper or electronic). Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs 
and/or laboratory abnormalities t hat are reported/identified du ring the course of the study.
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required t o proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and non-serious AEs of  special interest (as defined in 
Section 9.2 will be followed until resolution, until the c ondition stabilizes, un til the event is 
otherwise explained, or until the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 8.3 ).
Further informatio n on follow- up procedures is given in Appendi x 3.
9.2.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
•Prompt notification by the investigator to the Sponsor of SAEs is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a 
product under clinical investigation are met.
•An investigator who receives an i nvestigator safety report desc ribing SAEs or other specific 
safety information (e.g., summary  or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will f ile it al ong with

the Investigator’s Brochure and w ill notify the IRB/IEC, if appropri ate acc ording to  local 
requirements.
Sponsor or designee w ill be reporting adverse events to regu latory authorities and ethics 
committees according to local a pplicable laws in cluding Europea n Directive 2001/20/EC and FDA 
Code of Federal Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320. A SUSAR ( Suspected, Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reaction) is a subset of SAEs and will be repor ted to the appropriate regulatory 
authorities and investigators following local and global  guidelines  and requirements.
All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening peri od and within 100 days of the last 
dose of study treatment. For participants randomized/assigned t o treatment and never treated with 
study drug, SAEs should be c ollected for 30 days from  the date of randomization.
9.2.5 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the study treatment, it is subseque ntly discovered that a participant is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study exposur e, including during at least 
5 half-lives after product adminis tration, the investigator must  immediately notify the BMS 
Medical Monitor/designee of this event and complete and forward  a Pregnancy Surveillance Form 
to BMS Designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event and i n accordance with SAE reporting 
procedures described in Appendix 3 .
In most cases, the study tr eatment w ill be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (e.g.,  
dose tapering if necessary for participant safety). Please call  the BMS Medical Monitor within 24 
hours of awareness of the pregnancy.
Follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, in cluding perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be re ported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study p articipant should be reported to 
Sponsor or designee. In order for Sponsor or designee to collect  any pregnancy surveillance 
information from the female partne r, the fe male pa rtner must si gn an informed consent form for 
disclosure of this information. Information on this pregnancy w ill be collected on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
9.2.6 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities
The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be ca ptured on the nonserious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form electronic, as appropriate. Paper forms  are only intended as a back-up 
option when the electronic system is not functioning.
•Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or me ets the definition of an SAE 
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the partic ipant to have study treatment 
discontinued or interrupted
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the partic ipant to r eceive sp ecific 
corrective therapy

It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than  laboratory term would be used by the 
reporting investigator (e.g., anemia versus low hemoglobin valu e).
9.2.7 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible,  timely confirmation  of initial liver-rel ated laboratory  abnormalities s hould 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occ urrences of potential DILIs, meeting 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 9.2 and Appendix 3  for reporting 
details).
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as: 
1) AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (UL N)
AND
2) Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without init ial findings of cholestasis ( elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),
AND
3) No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation  and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limi ted to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing ch ronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
9.2.8 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physica l examinations, electrocardiogram, 
x-ray filming, any other potential safety assessment required o r not required by protocol should 
also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate,  and reported accordingly.
9.3 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional adminis tration of any dose of a product that 
is considered both excessive and medically important.
In the event of an overdose, the investigator should:
1) Contact the Medical Monitor immediately
2) Closely monitor the participant for AEs/SAEs and laboratory a bnormalities 
3) Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the durat ion of the overdosing in the CRF.
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be  made by the investigator in 
consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical eva luation of the participant/
For details of regardi ng overdose with cetuximab or cisplatin c an be found in the local product 
information.
Overdoses meeting the regulator y definition of an SAE must be re ported as an SAE (see Appendix 
3).

Sample Collection and Storage
All requests for access to samples or data for additional resea rch will be vetted through a diverse 
committee of the study sponsor’s senior leaders in Research and Development (or designee) to 
ensure the research supports appropriate and well-defined scien tific research activities.
•Residual whole blood (DNA), serum, plasma blood, PBMCs, and tum or biopsy collections 
(See Table 9.8.1-1) will be r etained for additional research purposes.
Samples kept for future research will be stored at the BMS Bior epository in Hopewell, NJ, USA 
or an independent, BMS-approved storage vendor.
The manager of these samples will ensure they are properly used  throughout their usable life and 
will destroy the samples at the end of the scheduled storage pe riod, no longer than fifteen (15) 
years after the end of the study or the maximum allowed by appl icable law.
Transfers of samples by resear ch sponsor to th ird parties will be participant to the recipient’s

9.8.2 Tumor Tissue Specimens
Screening Biopsies
The screening tumor biopsy tissue needs to be shipped to the ce ntral laboratory and the PD-L1 
analysis and HPV p-16 testing (if needed) must be processed wit h an available result prior to 
randomization. In the event the tumor sample is deemed unevalua ble due to insufficient tumor 
content, the medical monitor may request the site to send anoth er specimen, if available. The 
presence of either an archival or a fresh biopsy specimen is an  inclusion criterion and hence a 
prerequisite for full eligibility of a participant. An archived  biopsy prior to therapy is acceptable if 
the fresh biopsy cannot be obtained and if the archived tissue m eets the defined criteria as stated 
below.
•Obtained within 3 months of enrollment
•An archived biopsy (block or slides) must contain tumor tissue
•If archived blocks are not available, ≥ 25 slides (preferred) cont aining tumor are available for 
exploratory use .
9.8.2.1 Tumor sample collection details
In revised protocol 03 tumor samples are no longer required to be collected. 
A minimum of 5 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) unstained  sections (preferred) are

COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROTOCOL AND PROTOCOL REVISIONS
The investigator should not imp lement any deviation or change to the protocol without prior 
review and documented approval/favorable opinion of an amendmen t from the IRB/IEC (and if 
applicable, also by local health authority) except where necessa ry to eliminate an immediate 
hazard(s) to study subjects. 
If a deviation or change to a protocol is implemented to elimin ate an immediate hazard(s) prior to 
obtaining relevant  approval/favorable opinion(s) the deviation  or change will be submitted, as 
soon as possible to:
•IRB/IEC for 
•Regulatory Authority(ies), if applicable by local regulations ( per national requirements)
Documentation of approval/favorable opinion signed by the chair person or designee of the 
IRB(s)/IEC(s) and if applicable, also by local health authority  must be sent to BMS.
If an amendment substantially alters the study design or increa ses the potential risk to the 
participant: (1) the consent form must be revised and submitted  to the IRB(s)/IEC(s) for review 
and approval/favorable opinion; (2) the revised form must be us ed to obtain consent from subjects 
currently enrolled in the study if they are affected by the ame ndment; and (3) the new form must 
be used to obtain consent from new subjects prior to enrollment .
If the revision is done via an administrative letter, investiga tors must inform their IRB(s)/IEC(s).
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Investigators must:
•Provide a copy of the consent form and written information abou t the study in the language in 
which the participant is most proficient prior to clinical study  participation. The language must 
be non-technical and easily understood. 
•Allow time necessary for participant or participant's legally ac ceptable representative to 
inquire about the details of the study.
•Obtain an informed consent signed and personally dated by the p articipant or the participant's 
legally acceptable representative and by the person who conduct ed the informed consent 
discussion. 
•Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opinion of the written informed consent form 
and any other information to be provided to the subjects, prior  to the beginning of the study, 
and after any revisions are completed for new information.
If informed consent is initially given by a participant’s legal ly acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the participant subsequently becomes capable of ma king and communicating his or 
her informed consent during the study, consent must additionall y be obtained from the participant.
Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is 
relevant to the participant's c onsent. The investigator, or a p erson designated by the investigator, 
should fully inform the participan t or the participant's legally  acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new information relevant to the 
participant's willingness to continue participation in the stud y. This commun ication s hould be 
documented. 
The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects mus t be protected, respecting the privacy 
and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements , the subjects' signed ICF and, in the 
US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Authorization.
The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and regu latory authorities have direct 
access to p articipant records. 
The rights, safety, and well-being of the study subjects are th e most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.
SOURCE DOCUMENTS
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the source da ta are accurate, legible, 
contemporaneous, original and attr ibutable, whether the data ar e hand-written on paper or entered

CASE REPORT FORMS
An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and  accurate case histories designed 
to record all observations and other d ata pertinent to the investig ation on each individual treated 
or entered as a control in the investigation. Data that are der ived from source documents and 
reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source document s or the discrepancies must be 
explained. Additional clinical information may be collected and  analyzed in an effort to enhance 
understanding of product safety. CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities 
that are reported or identified during the course of the study.
For sites using the Sponsor or designee electronic data capture tool, electronic CRFs w ill be 
prepared for all data collection fields except for fields speci fic to SAEs and pregnancy, which will 
be reported on the electronic SAE form and Pregnancy Surveillan ce form, respectively.  If 
electronic SAE form is not av ailable, a paper SAE form can be used. Spaces may be left blank  
only in those circumstances permitted by study-specific CRF com pletion guidelines provided by 
Sponsor or designee. 
The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects mus t be protected, respecting the privacy 
and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regu latory requirement(s).
The investigator will maintain a signature sheet to document si gnatures and initials of all persons 
authorized to make entries and/or corrections on CRFs. 
The completed CRF, SAE/pregnancy CRFs, must be promptly reviewe d, signed, and dated by the 
investigator or qualified physician who is a subinvestigator an d who is delegated this task on the 
Delegation of Authority Form. Subinvestigators in Japan may  not be delegated the CRF approval 
task For electronic CRFs, review and approval/signature is compl eted electroni cally through the 
BMS electronic data capture tool. The investigator must r etain a copy of the CRFs including 
records of the changes and corrections.
Each individual electronically si gning electronic CRFs must mee t Sponsor or designee training 
requirements and must only access the BMS electronic data captu re tool using the unique user 
account provided by Sponsor or designee. User accounts are not to be shared or reassigned to other 
individuals
MONITORING
Sponsor or designee represen tatives w ill review data centrally t o identify potential issues to 
determine a schedule of on-site visits for targeted review of s tudy records. 
Representatives of BMS must be allowed to visit all study site locations periodically to assess the 
data quality and study integrity . On site they will review stud y records and directly compare them 
with source documents, discuss the conduct of the study with th e investigator, and verify that the 
facilities remain acceptable .Certain CRF pages and/or electroni c files may serve as the source 
documents:

In addition, the study may be evaluated by Sponsor or designee in ternal auditors and government 
inspectors who must be allowed access to CRFs, source documents , other study files, and study 
facilities . BMS audit reports will be kept confidential.
The investigator must notify BMS promptly of a ny inspections scheduled by regulatory aut horities, 
and promptly forward copies of inspection reports to Sponsor or  designee.
RECORDS RETENTION
The investigator (or head of the study site in Japan) must reta in all study records and source 
documents for the maximum period required by applicable regulat ions and guidelines, or 
institution procedures, or for the period specified by BMS or d esignee, whichever is longer. The 
investigator (or head of the study site in Japan) must contact BMS prior to destroying any records 
associated with the study.
BMS or designee will notify the investigator (or head of the st udy site in Japan) when the study 
records are no longer needed.
If the investigator withdraws from the study (e.g., relocation,  retirement), the records sh all be 
transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (e.g., another in vestigator, study site, IRB). Notice 
of such transfer will be given in writing to BMS or designee. 
RETURN OF STUDY TREATMENT
For this study, study treatments (those supplied by BMS, a vend or or sourced by the investigator) 
such as partially used study treatment containers, vials and sy ringes may be destroyed on site. 
If.. Then
Study treatments supplied by BMS (including 
its vendorsAny unused study treatments s upplied by BMS 
can only be destroyed after being inspected and reconciled by the responsible Study Monitor unless study treatments containers 
must be immediately destroyed as required for 
safety, or to meet local regulations (e.g., cytotoxics or biologics).
If study treatments will be returned, the return 
will be arranged by th e responsible Study 
Monitor.
Study treatments sourced by site, not supplied by BMS (or its vendors) (examples include 
study treatments sourced from the sites stock

for proper disposal have been e stablished according to applicab le federal, state, local, and 
institutional guidelines and procedures, and provided that appr opriate records of disposal are kept. 
The following minimal standards must be met:
•On-site disposal practices must not expose humans to risks from  the drug.
•On-site disposal practices and procedures are in agr eement with applicable laws and 
regulations, including any special requirements for controlled or hazardous substances.
•Written procedures for on-site disposal are available and follo wed. The procedures must be 
filed with the site’s SOPs a nd a copy  provided t o BMS upon requ est.
•Records are maintained that allow for traceability of each cont ainer, including the date 
disposed of, quantity disposed, and identif ication of the person disposing the containers. The 
method of disposal, i.e., incinerator, licensed sanitary landfi ll, or licensed waste disposal 
vendor must be  documented.
•Accountability and disposal records are complete, up-to-date, a nd available for the Monitor to 
review throughout the clinical trial period.
It is the investigator’s or designee’s responsibility to arrang e for disposal of all empty containers.
If conditions for destruction cannot be met the responsible Stu dy Monitor will make arrangements

APPENDIX 3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS: 
DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING, 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW UP AND REPORTING
ADVERSE EVENTS
Adverse Event Definition:
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical oc currence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation parti cipant administered study treatment
and that does not necessarily hav e a causal relati onship with t his treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (suc h as an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the us e of study treatment, whether or 
not considered related to the study treatment.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
•Any abnormal laboratory test re sults (hematol ogy, clinical chem istry, or urinalysis) or 
results from other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological sc a n s ,  v i t a l  s i g n s  
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, consi dered clinically significant 
in the medical and scie ntific judgment of the investigator. Note  that abnormal lab tests or 
other safety assessments should only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not 
available. Once the final diagnosis is known, the reported term  should be updated to be the 
diagnosis.
•Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing conditio n including either an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
•New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention a dministration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-d rug interaction.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a s uspected overdo se of either study intervention 
or a concomitant medication. Overdose, as a verbatim term (as r eported by the investigator), 
shoul d not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional  overdose taken with possible 
suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae and 
should specify "intentional overdose" as the verbatim term
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
•Medical or surgical proce dure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): th e condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
•Situations in which an untoward medical occ urrence did not occur (so cial and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).

SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the participa nt was at risk of  death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypotheticall y might have caused death if it were 
more severe)
Requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of ex isting hospitalization (see NOTE 
below)
NOTE: 
The following hospitalizations are not  considered SAEs in BMS c linical studies: 
•a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not result 
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-th reatening event)
•elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
•admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical proce dure
•routine health assess ment requiring admission for baseline/tren ding of health status (e.g., 
routine colonoscopy)
•medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases
•admission encountered for another life circumstance that carrie s no bearing on health status 
and requires no medical/ surgical intervention (e.g., lack of ho using, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason)
•admission for administr ation of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs (a pplies 
to oncology protocols)
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) th at may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based up on appropriate med ical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the participant or may requi re intervention [e.g., medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed i n the definition above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treat ment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or co nvulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization.) Potential  drug induced liver injury (DILI) is  also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 9.2.7 for the definition of potential DILI.) 
Pregnancy and potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) must f ollow the same transmission timing 
and processes to BMS as used for SAEs (see section 9.2.5  for reporting pregnancies).

BMS-936558 nivolumab
Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to  study therapy should be reported 
as SAE (e.g., death is an endpoint, if death occurred due to an aphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be 
reported).
EVALUATING AES AND SAES
Assessment of Causality
•The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship betwee n study intervention and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.
•A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there  are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relat ionship cannot be ruled out.
•The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the re lationship.
•Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to s tudy intervention administration 
will be considered and investigated.
•The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure  (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for mark eted products, in his/her assessment.
•For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical n otes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality .
•There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the in vestigator has minimal 
information t o include in the initial report to Sponsor. Howeve r, it is very important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causality for every e vent before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to Sponsor.
•The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in lig ht of follow-up information 
and send a SAE follow-up report with the updated causality asse ssment.
•The causality assessment is one  of the criteria used when deter mining regulatory reporting 
requirements.
Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
If only limited information is i nitially available, follow- up reports are required. (Note: Follow-
up SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initi ally reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to s tudy treatment or if new 
information becomes available, the SAE report must be updated a nd submitted within 24 hours 
to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmit ting the initial SAE report.
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.

APPENDIX 4 WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL DEFINITIONS AND 
METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until beco ming post-menopausal unless  
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hy sterectomy, bilateral  
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
•Premenarchal
•Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
−Documented hysterectomy
−Documented bilateral salpingectomy
−Documented bilateral oophorectomy
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of  the participant’s medical  
records, medical examinatio n, or medical history interview.
•Postmenopausal female
−A postmenopausal state is defined as 12 months of ame norrhea in a woman over age 45  
years in the absence of other biological or physiological cause s. In addition, females under  
the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle stimulating hormone, ( FSH) level > 40  
mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE FOR FEMALE PARTICIPANTS OF CHILD BEARING  
POTENTIAL
One of the highly effective methods of contraception listed bel ow is required during study duration  
and until the end of relevant systemic exposure, defined as 5 mo nths weeks after the end of study  
treatment. 
Local laws and regulations may require use of alternative and/o r additional contraception methods.
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependent 
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.a
•Combined (estrogen- and progest ogen-containing) hormonal contrac eption associated with  
inhibition of ovulationb

−oral 
−injectable 
Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independent
•Implantable progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of  
ovulationb
•Hormonal methods of contraception including oral contraceptive pills containing a  
combination of estrogen and progesterone, vaginal ring, injectab les, implants and  
intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)c
•Intrauterine device (IUD)c
•Bilateral tubal occlusion
•Vasectomized partner 
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner 
is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed.  
If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
•Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
•It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception whe n complete abstinence is  
elected. 
•WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy  
tests, as specified in Section 2 . 
•Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the  
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abs tinence 
NOTES: 
aTypical use failure rates may differ from those when used consi stently and correctly. Use should be consistent  
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive metho ds for participants participating in clinical studies.  
bHormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with t he study drug, which may reduce the efficacy  
of the contraceptive method.  Hormonal contraception is permiss ible only when there is sufficient evidence that  
the IMP and other study med ications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contracept ion would be  
ineffective or result in increased exposures that could be pote ntially hazardous.  In this case, alternative methods  
of contraception should be utilized. 
cIntrauterine devices and intrauterine hormone releasing systems  are acceptable methods of contraception in the  
absence of definitive drug interaction studies when hormone exp osures from intrauterine devices do not alter  
contraception effectiveness
Unacceptable Methods of Contraception
•Male or female c ondom with or without spermicide.  Male and fem ale condoms cannot be

APPENDIX 10 RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID TUMORS 
GUIDELINES (VERSION 1.1) WITH BMS MODIFICATIONS
1 EVALUATION OF LESIONS
Solid tumors will be evalu ated using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 
(RECIST 1.1) guideline with BMS modifications.1
At baseline, tumor lesions/lym ph nodes will be categorized as m easurable or non- measurable as  
follows:
1.1 Measurable
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
10 mm by CT/MRI scan (scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm) , or ൒2x slice thickness if 
greater than 5mm.
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pat hologically enlarged and measurable, a lymp h node 
must be ≥15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT/MRI scan (scan slice thi ckness recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm).
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet th e criterion of a short axis of 
≥15 mm by CT/MRI scan. Onl y the short axis of these nodes will con tribute to the baseline sum. 
The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by rad iologists to judge if a node is 
involved by solid tumor. Nodal size is normally reported as two  dimensions in the plane in which 
the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the ax ial plane; for MRI the plane of 
acquisition may be axial, sagittal or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. For 
example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 20 mm x 3 0 mm has a short axis o f 20 mm 
and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example,  20 mm should be recorded as the 
node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with shor t axis ≥10 mm but < 15 mm) 
should be considered non-target lesions. Nodes that have a shor t axis < 10 mm are considered 
non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.
Note: Lesions on X-Ray are not to be selected as Target or Non- Target Lesions.
1.2 Non-Measurable
All other lesions are considered non-measurable, including smal l lesions (l ongest d iameter 
< 10mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to < 15 mm short axis) as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non-measurable  include: leptomeningeal 
disease, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal 
masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable by 
reproducible imaging techniques.

Clinical Protocol CA2099TM
BMS-936558 nivolumab
Note: Lesions on X-Ray are not to be selected as Target or Non- Target Lesions.
1.3 Special considerations regarding lesion measurability
1.3.1 Bone lesions
•Bone scan, PET scan and plain films are notconsidered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesions. 
•Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components , that 
can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered 
as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability 
described above.
•Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.
1.4 Baseline Documentation Of ‘Target’ And ‘Non-Target’ Lesions
When more than one meas urable lesion is present at baseline all  lesions up to a maximum of five 
lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) represen tative of all involved organs should 
be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measur ed at baseline (this means in 
instances where patients have only one or two organ sites invol ved a maximum of two and four 
lesions respectively will be recorded).
Note: A maximum of two lesions can be selected per organ system . For example, a maximum of 
two lung lesions can be selected (selected from one lung or one  lesion from each). A maximum of 
two lymph nodes can be selected at baseline, as the lymphatic s ystem is considered one organ.
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (le sions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should b e those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on  occasion, the largest lesion does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstan ce the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected.
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short ax is for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum dia meters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis i s added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize  any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes s hould be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Mea surements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ 
(more details to follo w). In addition, it is  possible to record  multiple non-target lesions involving 
the same organ as a single item  on the case record form (eg, ‘m ultiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ 
or ‘multiple liver metastases’).

2 RESPONSE CRITERIA
2.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions
•Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nod es 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axi s to < 10 mm.
•Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesio ns, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
•Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesio ns, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes th e baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20% , the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of  one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).
•Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient i ncrease to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
•Not Evaluable (NE): If one or more target lesions cannot be measured or adequately assessed 
as either fully resolved or too sm all to measure (due to missi ng or poor quality i mages), and 
the sum of diameters of the remaining measured target lesions ( if any) has not increased 
sufficiently to meet Progressive Disease as defined above. 
2.1.1 Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions
2.1.1.1 Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes identified as target lesions s hould always have the actual short axis measurement 
recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline  examination), even if the nodes 
regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when lymph nod es are included as target lesions, 
the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal 
lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10 mm. Case re port forms or other data collection 
methods may therefore be designed to have target nodal lesions recorded in a s eparate section 
where, in order to qualify for CR, each node must achieve a sho rt axis < 10 mm. For PR, SD and 
PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be inc luded in the sum of target lesions.
2.1.1.2 Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’
While on study, all lesions (nodal and non-nodal) r ecorded at baseline s hould have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). 
However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as  target lesions at baseline 
become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel co mfortable assigning an exact 
measure and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’. Wh en this occurs it is important 
that a value be recorded on the case report form. If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion 
has likely disappeared, the meas urement should be recorded as 0  mm. If the lesion is believed to 
be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a defa ult value of 5 mm should be assigned
as the reference diameter. (Note: It is less likely that this rul e will be used for lymph nodes since

retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be pre sent and is faintly seen but too 
small to measure, a default value of  5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as w ell). This 
default value is derived from the 5 mm CT slice thickness (but should not be changed with varying 
CT slice thickness). The measurement of these lesions is potent ially non-reprodu cible, therefore 
providing thi s default value will prevent false responses or pr ogressions based upon measurement 
error. To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to pro vide an actual meas ure, that should be 
recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
2.1.1.3 Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment
When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the  fragmented portions should be 
added together to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, a s lesions coalesce, a plane between 
them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diam eter measurements of each 
individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such tha t they are no longer separable, the 
vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the m aximal longest diameter for the 
‘coalesced lesion’.
2.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to d etermine the tumor response for the 
group of non-target lesions. While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need 
not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitative ly at the time points specified in 
the protocol.
•Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions. All lymph nodes must b e 
non-pathological in size (< 10mm short axis). 
•Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s)
•Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.
2.2.1 Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non-Target Disease
The concept of progression of non-targ et disease requires addit ional explanation as follows:
2.2.1.1 When the patient also has measurable disease
In this setti ng, to achieve ‘unequi vocal progression’ on the basis of the no n-target disease, there 
must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target  disease such that, even in presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has inc reased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy A modest ‘increase’ in the size of o ne or more non-target lesions is 
usually not sufficient to  qualify for unequivocal progression status. Pleural effusions, pericardial 
effusions and ascites will not be  followed as target or non-tar get lesions and will not contribute to 
response or progression. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in 
non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease wil l therefore be extremely rare.

2.2.1.2 When the patient has only non-measurable disease
This circumstance arises in some trials when it is not a criter ion of study entry to have measurable 
disease. The same general concepts apply here as noted above, h owever, in this instance there is 
no measurable disease assessment to factor into the inte rpretati on of an increase in non- measurable 
disease burden. Because worsening in non-target disease ca nnot be easil y quantified (by definition: 
if all lesions are truly non-measurable) a useful test that can  be applied when assessing patients for 
unequivocal progressi on is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden bas ed on the change 
in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the inc rease that would be required to 
declare PD for measurable disease: ie, an increase in tumor bur den representing an additional 73% 
increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase dia meter in a measura ble lesion). 
Examples include, an increase in lymphangitic disease from loca lized to widespread, or may be 
described as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’. If ‘u nequivocal progression’ is seen, the 
patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that poi nt. While it would be ideal to have 
objective criteria to apply to non-measurable disease, the very  nature of that disease makes it 
impossible to do so; therefore the increase must be substantial .
2.2.2 New Lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progres sion; therefore, some comments 
on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specifi c criteria for the identification of 
new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequi vocal: ie, not 
attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in im aging modality or findings thought 
to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new ’ bone lesions may be simply 
healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). This is particularly  important when the patient’s baseline 
lesions show partial or complete response. For example, necrosi s of a liver lesion may be reported 
on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not.
NOTE: Fluid collections (pleural effusions, pericardial effusio ns, and ascites) will not be 
considered new lesions and will not contribute to response or p rogression. In the event a new fluid 
collection is see n on a post-baseline imaging exam, a comment m ay be made, but the appearance 
of a new fluid collection alone should not result in an assessm ent of Progressive Disease (PD). A 
lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical locatio n that was not scanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progressio n. An example of this is the patient 
who has visceral disease at ba seline and while on study has a C T or MRI brain ordered which 
reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are consider ed to be evidence of PD even if 
he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline. A lesion identif ied on Chest X-Ray that was not 
present in prior CT can be considered a new lesion and will res ult in Progressive Disease (PD).
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued follow-up evaluation 
will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans conf irm there is definitely a new 
lesion, then progression should be  declared using the date of t he initial scan. While FDG-PET 
response assessments need additi onal study, it is sometimes rea sonable to incorporate the use of 
FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of pro gression (particularly

possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET im aging can be identified according 
to the following algorithm:
1. Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at foll ow-up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesion.
2. No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: I f the positive FDG-PET at 
follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT,  this is PD. If the positive 
FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up 
CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the 
date of PD will be the d ate of the initial a bnormal FDG-PET sca n). If the positive FDG-PET 
at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on C T that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.
2.3 Response Assessment
2.3.1 Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from th e start of the study treatment until 
disease progression or th e last response recorded, taking into account any requirement for 
confirmation and censoring rules regarding subsequent therapy. T he patient’s best overall res ponse 
assignment will depend on the findings of both target and non-ta rget disease and will also take into 
consideration the appearance of new lesions. Furthermore, depen ding on the nature of the study 
and the protocol requirements, it may also require confirmatory  measurement.
2.3.2 Time Point Response
At each protocol specified  time point, a response assessment occurs. Table 2.3.2-1 provides a 
summary of the overall re sponse status calculation at each time point for patients who have 
measurable disease at baseline. When patients have non-measurab le (therefore non-target) disease 
only, Table 2.3.2-2 is to be used.

aNon-CR/non-PD is preferred over SD for non-target disease since  SD is increasingly used as endpoint for  
assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this categor y when no lesions can be measured is not advised.
2.3.3 Best Overall Response 
Best response determinati on of complete or par tial res ponse requires confirmation: Complete or 
partial responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a subsequent time point of 
≥4 weeks (28 days) later. In this circumstance, the best overall  response can be interpreted as in
Table 2.3.3-1 . When SD is believed to be best response, it must meet the pro tocol specified 
minimum time from the d ate of first treatmen t or ra ndomizatio n date.
For example, if the first scheduled follow-up imaging visit is Week 6 (± 7 days) for a particular 
protocol, a Best Response of SD can only be made after the subj ect is on-study for a minimum of 
6 weeks (42 days) minus 7 days, for an absolute minimum time on- study of 35 days from the 
reference start date (reference date is considered Day 1 on stu dy).  If the subject is not on-study 
for at least this am ount of t ime, any tumor assessment indicating stable disease before this  time 
period will have a Best Response of NE unless PD is identified.
Special note on response assessment: When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions 
and the nodes decrease t o ‘normal’ s ize (< 10 mm), they may st ill have a measurement reported 
on scans. This measurement should be recorded even though the n odes are normal in order not to 
overstate progression should it be based on increase in size of  the nodes. As noted earlier, this 
means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the case report form (CRF).

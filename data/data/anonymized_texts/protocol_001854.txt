1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
This is a phase  2 study  to obtain  an estimate  of the speed  of neutrophil  recovery  after 
myeloablative  double -unit cord blood  (CB) transplantation  (CBT)  with abrogation  of prolonged  
cytopenia  by the infusion  of T-cell depleted  peripheral  blood  stem  cells  (PBSC)   from  a  haplo - 
identical  family  member.  The CB graft will consist  of one or two (or double)  units from unrelated  
newborn  donors  to be administered  on day +0 (or +1 if needed  for scheduling)  and haplo -identical  
related  donors  will be used  to obtain  PBSC  for infusion  on day 0 or +1. Candidates  for this trial will 
include  patients  aged  2-70 years  with high-risk or advanced  forms  of hematologic  malignancies  
including  acute  myeloid  leukemia  (AML)  or acute  lymphoblastic  leukemia  (ALL),  myelodysplastic  
syndrome  (MDS),  chronic  myeloid  leukemia  (CML),  or lymphoma  for whom  an allogeneic  
hematopoietic  stem  cell transplant  is indicated  and for whom  no suitably  human  leukocyte  antigen  
(HLA) -matched  and readily  available  unrelated  donor  exists.  For the purposes  of analysis  and 
monitoring  of stopping  rules,  patients  will be enrolled  on 2 arms  according  to their risk for early 
transplant -related  mortality  (TRM) or relapse -related  death.  Arm A will include  patients  who are at 
standard  risk of early post-transplant  death  from TRM  or relapse,  and Arm B will include  patients  
who are at high risk of early post-transplant  death.  
 
Patients  must  be suitable  for myeloablative  conditioning  but this can be at high dose  
(cyclophosphamide  120 mg/kg,  fludarabine  75 mg/m2, and total body  irradiation  1375   cGy),   or 
reduced  intensity  using  either  10 mg/kg  or 5 mg/kg  of thiotepa  (cyclophosphamide  50 mg/kg,  
fludarabine  150 mg/m2, thiotepa  10 mg/kg,  total body  irradiation  400 cGy or cyclophosphamide  50 
mg/kg,  fludarabine  150 mg/m2, thiotepa  5 mg/kg,  total body  irradiation  400 cGy) as appropriate  
according  to disease  status,  patient  age, extent  of prior therapy,  organ  function,  and presence  of co- 
morbidities.  Cyclosporine -A (CSA)  and mycophenolate  mofetil  (MMF)  will be used  for graft-versus - 
host disease  (GVHD)  prophylaxis.  CB grafts  will consist  of one or two CB units 4-6/6 HLA-matched  
to the patient  to augment  graft cell dose  and additional  T-cell depleted  PBSC  from a haplo -identical  
donor  will be infused  on day 0 or +1. The aim of the haplo -identical  PBSC  graft is to facilitate  
transient  engraftment  and consequent  abrogation  of the prolonged  cytopenia  normally  associated  
with CBT by providing  a neutrophil  and platelet  bridge  until CB engraftment  occurs.  The haplo - 
identical  natural  killer (NK) cells could  also mediate  additional  anti-leukemia  activity,  especially  in 
myeloid  malignancies.  
 
Patients  will be carefully  monitored  for donor  engraftment  and count  recovery,  donor  chimerism,  
incidence  and severity  of acute  and chronic  GVHD,  serious  infections,  immune  recovery,  TRM,  
length  of hospital  stay, relapse  as well as overall  and disease -free survival.  A total of 26 patients  will 
be accrued  to the standard  risk arm A and 75 to the high risk arm B. Stopping  rules will guard  
against  excess  toxicity  according  to the study  arm. It is anticipated  that the accrual  period  will last 
approximately  3-4 years.  The primary  endpoint  of the study  is the day to neutrophil  recovery.  This 
will be analyzed  in each  arm separately.   Historically,  the median  time to neutrophil  recovery  for 
myeloablative  double  unit CBT patients  is 25 days.  A design  that differentiates  between  population  
median  recovery  times  of 25 days and 15 days will be used  to assess  the neutrophil  recovery rate in 
this trial. The design  has power  equal  to 0.90 if the population  median  neutrophil  recovery  time for 
patients  treated  under  the proposed  approach  is 15 days;  the one-sided  test size is 0.10 when  the 
median  recovery  time is  25 days.  At the conclusion  of the study  a definitive  assessment  as to 
whether  this approach  speeds  neutrophil  recovery  will be possible.  In addition,  a preliminary  
assessment  of platelet  engraftment  and the efficacy  of CBT plus haplo -identical  PBSC  will be made,  
and results  can also be compared  to historical  MSKCC  double -unit CBT controls.

2.1 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
Data from MSKCC  have shown  that double -unit CBT is efficacious  with 2-year progression -free 
survival  comparable  to unrelated  and related  donor  hematopoietic  stem  cell (HSC)  sources1. 
However,  CBT is associated  with delayed  engraftment  as compared  with the transplantation  of adult  
donor  PBSC,  even when  using  CB grafts1. This can contribute  to increased  toxicity,  extended  
hospitalization,  and increased  transplantation  costs.  This protocol  will investigate  a novel  treatment  
strategy  that supplements  the double -unit graft with additional  haplo -identical  PBSC  that have been  
T-cell depleted  with the aim that the haplo -identical  cells will mediate  transient  engraftment  and thus 
form a neutrophil  and platelet  bridge  until sustained  CB engraftment  can be achieved.  NK cells from 
the PBSC  graft could  also provide  additional  anti-leukemia  activity.  
 
The primary  aim of this study  is to obtain  an estimate  of the speed  of neutrophil  recovery  after 
double -unit CBT with a T-cell depleted  haplo -identical  allograft.  
 
Secondary  objectives  include:  
• the incidence  of sustained  cord blood -derived  neutrophil  engraftment;  
• the speed  of platelet  recovery  and incidence  of platelet  engraftment  by day 180; 
• the contribution  of the haplo -identical  PBSC  to initial  and sustained  engraftment  by assessment  
of chimerism  in blood  and bone  marrow;  
• the contribution  of each CB unit to initial  and sustained  engraftment  by assessment  of 
chimerism  in blood  and bone  marrow;  
• the incidence  and severity  of acute  GVHD  at 100 days;  
• the incidence  and severity  of chronic  GVHD  at 1 year;

• the incidence  of day 100 and 180 TRM;  
• the length  of initial  hospitalization  post-CBT;  
• the number  of days hospitalized  from day 0 to day 100 post-CBT;  
• immune  recovery  after transplant;  
• the incidence  of malignant  relapse  at 1 and 2 years;  
• the probabilities  of overall  and disease -free survival  at one and 2 years  after CBT.  
• graft characteristics  potentially  associated  with engraftment.  
 
At study  completion  an estimate  of the efficacy  of CBT with a T-cell depleted  haplo -identical  PBSC  
transplant  in augmenting  the speed  of neutrophil  engraftment  will be possible.  
 
3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
Clinical  Results  with Unrelated  Donor  Double -Unit CBT 
 
HSC transplantation  is now recognized  as an effective  form of therapy  for an increasing  number  
of malignant  and non-malignant  disorders.  To reconstitute  hematopoiesis  after myeloablative  
therapy,  the transplantation  of pluripotent  HSCs  is required.  In the allogeneic  setting  such  HSCs  are 
traditionally  obtained  from the bone  marrow  or peripheral  blood  of related  or unrelated  adult  donors.  
Unfortunately  suitably  HLA-matched  allogeneic  donors  are not available  for many  patients,  
especially  those  from racial  and ethnic  minorities.  A recent  MSKCC  study  has shown  that unrelated  
donor  availability  is limited  in many  patients  of southern  and mixed  European  ancestry,  as well as 
the majority  of patients  of Asian,  Hispanic,  African,  Middle  Eastern  backgrounds  and partial  non- 
European  origins2. 
 
Human  CB is an alternative  source  of HSCs  that is capable  of reconstituting  hematopoiesis  after 
myeloablative  therapy.  Known  benefits  of publically  banked  CB include:  1) rapid   availability,   2) 
absence of dono r risk, 3) absence of dono r attrition, and 4) very low risk of transmissible infectious 
diseases  such as cytomegalovirus  (CMV)  and Epstein -Barr virus (EBV).  Furthermore,  this HSC source  
permits  the expansion  of the available  donor  pool in targeted  racial  and ethnic  minorities.  All published  
studies  to date have indicated  that the level of HLA-match  required  for a successful  unrelated  donor  
CBT is less than that required  for a successful  unrelated  donor  transplant1. Moreover,  a MSKCC  study  
has proven  that CB extends  transplant  access  to racial  and ethnic  minorities  due to reduced  
stringency  of the required  HLA-match  (Figure  1)2.

Single  unit CBT,  however,  has been  associated  with a significant  incidence  of graft failure3,4. 
Double -unit CBT has been  adopted,  therefore,  to augment  graft cell dose  and has been  associated  
with improved  sustained  donor  engraftment  as compared  with historical  single  unit controls  despite  
nearly  all patients  exhibiting  sustained  donor  engraftment  with only one of the two units  of the graft 
(known  as the dominant  unit)5-7. Double -unit transplantation  has also been  associated   with  a 
reduced  incidence  of malignant  relapse  as compared  with single  unit CBT or adult donor  
transplantation8 -11. A study  from MSKCC  has shown  that double -unit CBT is efficacious  with 2-year 
progression -free survival  comparable  to related  and unrelated  donor  transplantation  (Figure  2)1. In a 
recent  series  of 75 patients  transplanted  with double -unit CB grafts  for the treatment  of high-risk 
acute  leukemia  in remission  or myelodysplasia  with < 5% blasts,  the 2 year relapse  incidence  has 
been  very low at 6% in adults  and 9% in children  12. This has translated  to relatively  high rates  of 
disease -free survival  at 2 years  post-transplant  (Figure  3). Importantly,  there  was no difference  in 
the disease -free survival  after high-dose  and reduced  intensity  regimens  supporting  the adoption  of 
reduced  intensity  CBT in patients  unsuitable  for high dose  conditioning  (Figure  4). Thus,  double -unit 
CBT can extend  transplant  access  to racial  and ethnic  minorities  and achieve  very promising  
disease -free survival  in children  and adults.

These  findings  support  double -unit CBT as an important  alternative  treatment  approach  for high 
risk hematological  malignancies.  However,  a limitation  of double -unit CBT is that neutrophil  recovery  
remains  delayed  even with the use of double -unit grafts.  A recent  review  of the engraftment  after 
myeloablative  double -unit CBT (n = 80) at MSKCC  demonstrated  a sustained  donor  engraftment  
incidence  of 94% (95%  CI: 88-100) but at a delayed  median  of 25 days (range  13-43) (J.Barker,  
unpublished  data,  2011).  Platelet  recovery  was also prolonged  with a cumulative  incidence  of 84% 
(95%  CI: 75-92) occurring  at a median  of 48 days (range  30-162).  As patients  do not recover  from 
the toxicity  of the preparative  regimen  until neutrophil  engraftment  occurs,  slow count  recovery  
contributes  to increased  cost of transplantation  from additional  days of hospitalization,  antibiotic  use, 
narcotic  use, total parenteral  nutrition  requirements,  and transfusion  dependence  for red blood  cells 
and platelets.  This delayed  engraftment  also increases  infectious  complications  and exacerbates  
pulmonary  and gastro -intestinal  toxicity.  Most  importantly,  MSKCC  data suggests  there  may be an 
adverse  effect  on survival  from slow engraftment  with TRM  occurring  in 6/32 (19%)  of fast engrafters  
and 9/29 (31%)  of slow engrafters  (J.Barker,  unpublished  data,  2011,  Figure  5).

Other  investigators  have reported  an increased  TRM  in engrafting  patients  with delayed  
neutrophil  recovery10. This protocol  seeks  to improve  the safety  and tolerability  of CBT by testing  
whether  additional  infusion  of T-cell depleted  haplo -identical  PBSC  can abrogate  prolonged  
neutropenia  and thrombocytopenia.  These  cells are capable  of rapid  engraftment,  but are not likely  
to mediate  sustained  engraftment  given  they are T-cell depleted  and will compete  against  the T-cell 
replete  double -unit CB graft.  Thus,  it is hoped  that the T-cell depleted  haplo -identical  PBSC  will 
provide  a neutrophil  and platelet  bridge  prior to the engraftment  of the double -unit CB graft at 3-4 
weeks  post-transplant.  Optimizing  the success  of CBT by such  an approach  is important  as this will 
significantly  broaden  the availability  of allogeneic  transplantation  as a treatment  modality.  
 
Methods  of Improving  Neutrophil  Recovery  Post -transplant  
 
Ex vivo expansion  of CB has been  investigated  as a potential  solution  to the prolonged  
neutropenia  observed  after unmodified  single  or double -unit CBT13,14. However,  this strategy  has 
proven  to be extremely  challenging  from a logistical  standpoint  as expansion  of a portion  of a single - 
unit graft,  or one of the two units of a double -unit graft,  must  commence  prior to the patient‟s 
transplant  admission  date.  Expansion  is also very expensive  due to the cost of supplemental  GMP  
grade  cytokines  and other  reagents.  To date,  no expansion  strategy  has yet proven  to reliably  
mediate  early neutrophil  recovery  or can easily  be applied  in a multi-center  setting.  
 
Fernandez  et al have  investigated  the alternative  approach  of infusing  a T-cell depleted  haplo - 
identical  or third party  donor  graft to supplement  single -unit CBT15. Fifty-five patients  with high-risk 
hematologic  malignancies  (median  age 34 years  and median  weight  70 kg) received  a single -unit 
CBT with a median  infused  total nucleated  cell (TNC)  dose  of 2.39 x 107/kg with mobilized  PBSC  
cells from a G-CSF mobilized  haplo -identical  (n = 38) or third-party  donor  that did not  share  
haplotypes  (n = 17). This graft was T-cell depleted  using  CD34+  cell selection.  Initial  predominance  
of the haplo  or third-party  donor  was seen  with a median  time to neutrophil  recovery  of 10 days post- 
transplant  and a median  time to a platelet  count  of > 20 x 109/l of 32 days.  Subsequently,  50/55  
patients  switched  to CB mediated  hematopoiesis  as would  be predicted  given  the CB graft was T- 
replete.  The 5 year overall  and disease -free survival  were  56% and 47%,  respectively.  
 
More  recently,  van Besien  and colleagues  have investigated  this approach  in 45 patients  with 
advanced  hematologic  malignancies16. The median  age was 50 years  and patients  received  reduced  
intensity  conditioning  with melphalan,  fludarabine,  and anti-thymocyte  globulin  with tacrolimus  and 
mycophenolate  mofetil  immunosuppression.  The median  haplo -identical  CD34+  cell dose  was 3.5 x 
106/kg with 0.7 x 104/kg CD3+  T-cells whereas  the median  infused  TNC dose  of the single -unit CB 
graft was 1.5 x 107/kg. The cumulative  incidence  of neutrophil  engraftment  was 95% (95%CI:  87- 
100) at day 50 with a median  time to neutrophil  recovery  of 11 days.  The cumulative  incidence  of 
platelet  engraftment  was 83% (95%CI:  69-97) with a median  time to recovery  of 19 days.  In the 
majority  of patients,  early  haplo -identical  engraftment  was subsequently  replaced  by durable  CB 
mediated  hematopoiesis  by 100 days post-transplant,  although  in 6 patients  there  was only 
engraftment  of the haplo -identical  donor,  4 patients  had engraftment  with only the CB unit and 4 
patients  had secondary  graft failure.  The percentage  of haplo -donor  chimerism  on day 100 
corresponded  with the infused  CD34+  cell dose  of the haplo -identical  graft.  No grade  IV acute  
GVHD  was seen.  The estimated  1 year overall  survival  was 55% (95%CI:  39-71) and the 
progression -free survival  was 42% (95%CI:  25-79). These  results  represent  promising  preliminary  
data but could  be further  improved  upon.  As no reports  exist of double -unit CBT with a T-cell 
depleted  haplo -identical  graft we will pursue  this strategy  in an attempt  to further  improve  upon  post- 
transplantation  engraftment  and survival.

MSKCC  has a long history  of using  TCD to facilitate  allogeneic  transplantation  with a much  
reduced  risk of GVHD.  Graft  manipulation  with TCD is a routine  procedure  for our Bone  Marrow  
Transplant  Program.  In this protocol,  allogeneic  haplo -identical  G-CSF-mobilized  PBSC  will be T-cell 
depleted  by positive  selection  of CD34+  progenitor  cells using  the CliniMACS  system.  The 
CliniMACS  Fractionation  system  requires  an IND; it positively  selects  CD34+  progenitor  cells from 
PBSC  by immunoadsorption  of cells binding  an anti-CD34+  monoclonal  antibody  to para-magnetic  
beads  which  can then be isolated  by  passage  through  a magnetized  column  and released  by 
removing  the magnetic  field and agitation  of beads.  This approach  has been  successfully  used  at 
MSKCC,  and has provided  CD34+  cell enrichment  with a median  CD3+  T-cell dose  of only 5 x 
103/kg in 74 recipients  of adult donor  allografts   (G.  Koehne,   personal   communication,   October  
2011).  
 
Potential Anti-leukemic Activity of Natural Killer Cells in Haplo-identical Grafts 
 
Haplo -identical  grafts  have the potential  to mediate  anti-malignancy  effects,  even if not 
associated  with sustained  engraftment  of the haplo -identical  donor.  This is highly  relevant  for this 
protocol  as patients  in morphologic  relapse  will be included.  Such  patients  are not usually  
considered  for transplantation  due to their high risk of relapse.  The anti-leukemic  effects  of haplo - 
identical  grafts  are primarily  mediated  by NK cells.  NK cells are tolerant  to cells expressing  self-MHC  
class  I molecules  and cytotoxic  to cells lacking  self-MHC  class  I molecules.  Recognition  of HLA 
class  I ligands  on potential  target  cells occurs  through  surface  inhibitory  receptors:  KIR2DL2/3  
recognize  HLA-C alleles  (HLA -C1 group);  KIR2DL1  recognizes  HLA-C alleles  (HLA -C2 group);  and 
KIR3DL1  recognizes  HLA-A and HLA-B alleles  with the Bw4 epitope.  With expression  of inhibitory  
KIR receptors  for self-class  I molecules,  NK cells are “licensed”  for effector  function  (cytokine  
production  and cytotoxicity),  and become  activated  against  target  cells lacking  self-HLA class  I 
ligands  (“missing  self”)17,18. In HLA-mismatched  HSC transplants,  allo-reactivity  of donor  NK cells 
due to missing  self recognition  in the patient  is the basis  for a marked  reduction  in AML relapse and 
improved  survival19. The activating  KIR2DS1,  which  recognizes  HLA-C2 molecules,  also educates  
NK cells for effector  function,  where  NK cells from HLA-C2/C2  individuals  who are 2DS1 -positive  
exhibit  reduced  functional  capacity20. Therefore,  both inhibitory  and activating  KIR receptors  
contribute  to NK education.  Because  the receptors  are constitutively  expressed  in the NK repertoire,  
licensed  NK activity  and allo-reactivity  can be predicted  based  upon  KIR and HLA genotypes  with a 
high degree  of accuracy.  In this proposal,  to maximize  NK allo-reactivity,  potential  haplo -identical  
donors  will be prioritized  based  on KIR/HLA  where  possible.  
 
We have evaluated  the impact  of donor -recipient  KIR-HLA genotypes  for 1277  AML patients  
transplanted  between  1989 -2008  from 9-10/10  HLA-matched  unrelated  donors  (K. Hsu, unpublished  
data,  manuscript  submitted  2012).  Two activating  KIR genes  exhibited  significant  impact  on relapse.  
Patients  receiving  allografts  from donors  positive  for KIR2DS1  (n = 412) had lower  relapse  (HR 0.76,  
p = 0.02,  Figure  6). Consistent  with recent  in vitro findings  identifying  its role in education  of NK cells 
with an HLA-C1 background,  HLA-C1 donors  positive  for KIR2DS1  had significantly  better  impact  on 
relapse  compared  with HLA-C2/C2  donors  positive  for KIR2DS1  (HR 0.45,  p = 0.002,  Figure  7). 
Notably,  the most  potent  KIR2DS1  effect  was evident  in an HLA-C mismatched  transplant  (HR 0.44,  
p = 0.01,  Figure  8). These  data suggest  that KIR2DS1  provides  a potent  protection  from relapse,  
and have  significant  implications  for donor  selection  algorithms  in that allografts  from KIR2DS1  
positive  HLA-C1 donors  have the highest  anti-AML potency  and that 2DS1  positive  HLA-C2/C2  
donors  should  be avoided.  A clear  algorithm  will be used  for donor  selection  based  on KIR/HLA  
genotyping,  applying  the most  current  findings  in NK biology  to clinical  practice.  To maximize  NK 
alloreactivity,  potential  haplo -identical  donors  will be prioritized  based  on KIR/HLA  genotypes  (see 
section  6.4).

Reasons  to Pursue  Double -Unit CBT with Haplo -identical  Transplant  Versus  Other  Transplant  
Strategies  
 
An alternative  treatment  approach  for patients  with high risk hematologic  malignancies  would  be 
to receive  a T-cell depleted  haplo -identical  transplantation  without  CBT.  However,  haplo -identical  
transplantation  in adults  has been  associated  with a high incidence  of TRM  and relapse  with only 
relatively  small  series  being  published  to date with most  series  showing  no clear  plateau  on the 
survival  curve21. By contrast,  unrelated  donor  double -unit CBT has become  a standard  alternative  
treatment  approach  at MSKCC  and other  centers  in the United  States,  and a comparable  disease - 
free survival  after double -unit CBT and related  and unrelated  donor  transplantation  has been  
demonstrated  in 2 series1,10. 
 
Another  possibility  would  be to perform  a single -unit CBT with haplo -identical  PBSC.  However,  
we have demonstrated  variable  CD34+  cell viability  in CB units from public  CB banks  as shown  in 
Figure  9 with poor viability  units unlikely  to engraft22. In a series  of 44 double -unit CBT recipients  
engrafting  with one unit, using  a threshold  of 75% (mean -2SD),  all but one (43/44)  engrafting  units 
had CD34+  viability  >75% and only 1/16 poor viability  units engrafted  (p=0.0006).  Poor viability  
correlated  with lower  colony -forming -unit content  (p = 0.02).  This raises  the possibility  that one of the 
reasons  why double -unit CBT is effective  is that it increases  the chance  of infusing  at least one unit 
of high quality  and thus with engraftment  potential.  
 
An additional  reason  why double -unit CBT has been  associated  with augmented  engraftment  is 
due to the increased  dose  of total nucleated  cells.  The MSKCC  study  of Avery  et al has shown  that 
the speed  and success  of engraftment  is associated  with the total TNC and CD3+  T-cell doses  of 
both units combined  (Figure  10) as well as the CD34+  cell dose  of the dominant  unit7. This suggests  
that the non-engrafting  unit is facilitating  the engraftment  of the dominant  unit despite  the fact that it 
does not contribute  to engraftment  itself,  and that this effect  is dose  dependent.  Single -unit CBT plus 
TCD haplo -identical  transplantation  has been  associated  with a risk of graft failure  of the CB, and 
patients  with sustained  engraftment  of the haplo -identical  cells or failure  of both stem cell sources  
have a poor prognosis16.

Figure  10. Total  Graft  Cell Dose  & Neutrophil  Engraftment  After  Myeloablative  Double -Unit CBT (n = 61). 
 
Finally,  the most  compelling  reason  to use double -unit CBT is that multiple  analyses  have 
suggested  that double -unit CBT protects  against  malignant  relapse8-11. This is especially  important  in 
adults  who receive  reduced  intensity  conditioning.  It is unknown  whether  such  benefits  would  be 
derived  from single -unit CB with haplo -identical  PBSC  transplantation.  As survival  after double -unit 
CBT has been  comparable  to that of HSC transplantation  from adult donors,  this protocol  will use of 
double -unit grafts  for the vast majority  of patients  and investigate  the addition  of haplo -identical  
PBSC  to abrogate  the prolonged  cytopenia  and potentially  facilitate  an additional  NK-mediated  anti- 
leukemia  effect.  Most importantly,  our approach  will also facilitate  comparison  of the results  with 
those  of MSKCC  double -unit CBT historical  controls.  However,  single  unit CBT plus haplo -identical  
PBSC  infusion  will be considered  in the occasional  pediatric  patient  with a large  well matched  single  
unit from a good  quality  bank  or the rare patient  with only one unit of suitable  match  and dose  
characteristics.  
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
4.2 Design  
 
This is a 2 arm phase  2 study  to obtain  an estimate  of the speed  of neutrophil  recovery  after 
myeloablative  CBT with abrogation  of prolonged  cytopenia  by infusion  of haplo -identical  family  
member  T-cell depleted  PBSC  in patients  with high-risk or advanced  hematologic  malignancies.  101 
patients  will be recruited  over 4 years  and transplant  outcomes  will be assessed  as per Section  2.0. 
Arm A (n = 26) will include  eligible  patients  who are at standard  risk of early  post-transplant  death  
from TRM  or relapse,  whereas  Arm B (n = 75) will include  eligible  patients  who are at high risk for 
early death.  Stopping  rules will guard  against  excess  toxicity  as evidenced  by graft failure,  severe  
GVHD,  and high day 100 death  rates  from TRM or relapse  according  to risk group  (i.e. if in Arm A or 
B, see Section  14). Problems  with engraftment,  severe  GVHD,  TRM,  early  death  due to relapse  and 
other  adverse  experiences  will be carefully  monitored  by the MSKCC  BMT research  data managers  
and reported  to the Principal  Investigator.  Outcomes  will be analyzed  in each  study  arm separately  
and at the conclusion  of the study  the results  of study  patients  can also be compared  to MSKCC  
double -unit CBT historical  controls.

4.3 Intervention  
 
This is a two arm phase  2 study.  In the majority  of patients  the CB graft will consist  of double  
units from two unrelated  newborn  donors.  However,  rare patients  may be able to proceed  with a 
single  CB unit. The CB graft (administered  day 0 or day 0 and +1) will be combined  with a PBSC  
graft obtained  from a haplo -identical  related  donor  and this will be administered  on day 0 or +1. 
Candidates  will include  patients  aged  2-70 years  with high-risk or advanced  hematologic  
malignancies  for whom  an allogeneic  HSC transplant  is indicated  and for whom  no suitably  HLA- 
matched  and readily  available  donor  exists.  Patients  must  be suitable  for myeloablative  conditioning  
but this can be at high dose  or reduced  intensity  as appropriate.  GVHD  prophylaxis  will include  CSA 
and MMF.  CB grafts  will consist  of partially  HLA-matched  CB unit(s)  and additional  T-cell depleted  
haplo -identical  PBSC  will be infused  on day 0 or +1. The aim of the haplo -PBSC  graft is to achieve  
transient  engraftment  that will abrogate  the prolonged  cytopenia  usually  associated  with CBT until 
sustained  CB engraftment  can occur.  The haplo -identical  NK cells could  also mediate  additional  
anti-leukemia  activity.

5.9 Cord  Blood  (CB)  and Haplo -identical  PBSC  
 
CB units are processed  to remove  excess  plasma;  most  banks  also deplete  red blood  cells.  They  
are tested  for sterility,  HLA-typed,  cryopreserved  and stored.  The CB units  will be thawed  in the 
Cytotherapy  Laboratory  as per standard  operating  procedures.  CB units should  be infused  
intravenously  via a central  venous  catheter  according  to standard  MSKCC  Nursing  guidelines.  
Haplo -identical  PBSC  will be collected  from a family  member  after G-CSF mobilization.  TCD will be 
done  by positive  selection  of CD34+  cells using  CliniMACS.  The CliniMACS  Fractionation  system  
requires  an IND; it positively  selects  CD34+  progenitors  by immunoadsorption  of cells to 
paramagnetic  beads.  Cells  are isolated  by passage  through  a magnetized  column  and released  by 
agitation  of the beads.

The criteria  below  determine  eligibility  for the protocol.  
 
Note: protocol  eligible  patients  according  to the criteria  outlined  below  will then be divided  according  
to age, diagnosis,  performance  status,  organ  function,  prior transplantation,  hematopoietic  cell 
transplant  comorbidity  index  (HCT -CI)23, and CB TNC dose  into those  who are at standard  risk (Arm  
A) or high risk (Arm  B) for early post-transplant  death  for the purposes  of applying  stopping  rules  
and outcome  analysis.  
 
Protocol  eligibility  criteria  are: 
 
• Age: 
o 2 - 70 years.  
• Diagnosis  of severe  aplastic  anemia:  eligibility  to be discussed  with PI and Service  Chief.  
Such  patients  will be assessed  in Arm B.

consent  will be obtained  by one of the participating  investigators  authorized  to obtain  consent.  After 
consent  is obtained,  confirmation  of patient  eligibility  will be done  by the Clinical  Trials  Office.  
 
This protocol will take due notice of NIH/ADAMHA policies concerning inclusion of women and 
minorities  in clinical  research  populations.  We expect  that the study  population  will be fully 
representative  of the range  of patients  referred  for transplant  without  exclusion  as to age, gender,  or 
ethnic  background  within  the limits  of transplant  eligibility  and of being  able to identify  a suitable  CB 
graft and a suitable  haplo -identical  related  donor.  Pregnant  women  are excluded  from participation  
in this study.  
 
8.1 PRETREATMENT  EVALUATION  
 
8.2 Pretreatment  evaluation  of the patient  
 
 
1. Standard  clinical  pretreatment  evaluations  
The following  tests  must  be performed  as per Adult  BMT standard  of care:  
 
a. Within  30 days prior to admission:  
i. Complete  history,  review  of systems,  physical  exam  (including  performance  
status).  
ii. CBC  with differential,  comprehensive  metabolic  panel  including  albumin,  LDH,  
PT/ PTT.

appropriate  if patients  with acute  leukemia  are at risk for CNS disease.Red  
blood  cell type and screen  (ABO  blood  type)..  
ii. EKG.  
iii. Echocardiogram  or MUGA  scan  with measurement  of left ventricular  ejection  
fraction.  
iv. Radiographic  studies  if clinically  indicated  for diagnosis.  
v. Chest  CT scan  without  contrast  to exclude  occult  fungal  infection  prior to 
transplant  (unless  CT with contrast  required  for disease  assessment  eg NHL).

Patients  will be admitted  to the Pediatric  or Adult  Bone  Marrow  Transplant  Unit. Patients  will be 
maintained  in reverse  isolation  as per the BMT clinical  care guidelines.  Prior to the administration  of 
the pre-transplant  conditioning,  a double  or triple  lumen  central  venous  catheter  will be inserted.  
The conditioning  regimen  will be selected  based  on the patient  age as well as disease  status,  extent  
of prior therapy,  organ  function  and presence  of significant  co-morbidities.  Note that: 
• Patients  < 30 years  are potentially  eligible  for high dose  or reduced  intensity  regimens  i.e. 
Regimens  A), B) or C) and decision  should  be made  based  on comorbidity  status.  
• Patients  30-59 years  are eligible  for regimens  B) or C) and choice  will be made  based  on 
comorbidity  status.  
• Patients  aged  60 - 70 years  and patients  with HCT-CI score  of 5 or higher  are only eligible  
for regimen  C).

9.3 GVHD  Prophylaxis  
 
All patients  will receive  GVHD  prophylaxis  with 2 drugs  as follows:  
 
Cyclosporine  
 
• Cyclosporine  A (CSA)  will be given  per current  MSKCC  guidelines.  
• It will begin  on day -3 intravenously  in the AM to achieve  therapeutic  levels  per MSKCC  
guidelines.  
• Initial  dosing  will be per the MSKCC  guidelines  of 3 mg/kg  per dose  (adjusted  weight  in 
the setting  of marked  obesity)  starting  day -3 and dose  adjustments  should  be made  on 
the basis  of toxicity  and sub- or supra -therapeutic  CSA levels.  
• Once  the patient  can tolerate  oral medications,  CSA can be converted  to an oral form.  
Page  27 of 
43 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 12 -153 A(14)  
Approval date: 29 -Jan-2018   
  
 
 
• In case of major CSA toxicity (e.g. CNS neurotoxicity documented by MRI), CSA should 
be discontinued.  Patients  may be re-challenged  when  clinically   appropriate   and 
alternative  immune  suppression  should  be substituted  per MSKCC  guidelines.  
• Patients  unable  to tolerate  CSA due to renal  impairment  should  also be considered  for an 
alternative  immunosuppressant  in addition  to mycophenolate  mofetil  as per MSKCC  
guidelines.  
• Standard  patients  will receive  CSA for approximately  5-6 months  in the absence   of 
ongoing  GVHD  requiring  systemic  immune  suppression.  If no history  or  evidence   of 
GVHD,  CSA may be tapered  with monitoring  for GVHD  with the aim to be off 
immunosuppression  by approximately  8-9 months  after transplant.  
• In patients  intolerant  of CSA due to renal  impairment  or other  toxicity  CSA can be tapered  
before  MMF.  This is a reverse  taper  (see guidelines).  
• For patients  with GVHD,  CSA may be continued  for longer  time periods  according  to 
standard  of care guidelines  
• If disease  progression  or persistence  occurs,  or the patient  is considered  to be at very 
high risk of relapse,  early  taper  or cessation  of CSA can be considered  with close  
observation  for GVHD.  
 
Mycophenolate  mofetil  (MMF ) 
 
• Mycophenolate  mofetil  (MMF)  will be given  per current  MSKCC   MMF   guidelines.   It 
should  begin  on day -3 intravenously  in the AM. Standard  dose  for adults  is 15 mg per kg 
per dose  IV q8 hours -see detailed  dosing  instructions  in the 
• Obtain  therapeutic  trough  levels  as per MSKCC  guidelines.  
• In preparation  for discharge,  switch  to oral route  (CellCept  or generic  mycophenolate  
mofetil).  For oral conversion  round  to tablet  size. If possible  ensure  both tablet  strengths  
are given  to patient  to permit  easy taper  in clinic.  On Pediatric  Service  can use liquid  
suspension.  Avoid  suspension  on Adult  Service.  
• No dose  adjustments  for renal  or liver disease  are needed  routinely  unless  severe  organ  
dysfunction.  
• If patient  is > +28 days and without  neutrophil  engraftment,  consideration  can be made  to 
dose  reduce  dosing  after discussion  with PI or co-PI. 
• If no evidence  of GVHD,  MMF  can be tapered  at approximately  60-100 days post- 
transplant.  Taper  at approximately  10-20% decrements.  The aim to be off the drug by 
approximately  5-6 months.  Earlier  tapers  can be considered  if myelosuppression  or high 
relapse  risk with very close  monitoring  for GVHD.  Abrupt  reductions  or cessation  should  
be avoided  due to GVHD  risk. 
• Patients  who are intolerant  of MMF  due to myelosuppression  may require  earlier  taper  at 
the treating  physician‟s discretion.  Do not abruptly  stop the drug unless  life-threatening  
toxicity  is suspected.  
• If the patient  is intolerant  of CSA,  MMF  taper  may be delayed  i.e. do a reverse  taper  
where  CSA tapered  first (see above).  
• If the patient  has acute  GVHD  requiring  systemic  therapy,  MMF  should  only be tapered  if 
control  of GVHD  has been  obtained  
 
9.4 CB Thaw  and Administration  
 
• CB grafts  will be received  at the  MSKCC  Cytotherapy  Laboratory  prior to the start of the 
preparative  regimen.  
• Units  will be thawed  by and released  from the Cytotherapy  Laboratory  according  to curr ent 
standards  of practice  and release  criteria.  As per standard  practice,  ABO blood  group,  total

nucleated  cells (TNC),  CD34+  and CD3+  cell number  and viability,  and sterility   will be 
measured  post-thaw.  
• A small number  of cells (< 0.5%  of the post-thaw TNC of each  unit) may be used  for 
laboratory  research  studies.  
• A sample  of each  unit should  be sent to the American  Red Cross  for chimerism  studies.  
• Units  should  be administered  upon  arrival  to the patient  care unit by IV infusion  by the 
nursing  staff under  supervision  of a BMT attending  physician.  CB infusion  nursing  guidelines  
should  be followed.  
• Pre-medication  as per current  MSKCC  guidelines  should  be given  as appropriate  for patient  
age. 
• IV hydration  per standard  of care.  . 
• Sample  from each  CB unit must  be submitted  to the Diagnostic  Molecular  Pathology  
Laboratory.  
 
9.5 Haplo -identical  PBSC  Collection,  Processing  and Infusion  
 
• Beginning  5-6 days before  the day of transplant,  the haplo -identical  donor  will receive  10 
mcg/kg  of G-CSF administered  subcutaneously  daily for at least 5 days as per MSKCC  
standards  of care.  
• On the 5th (and 6th if needed)  days of G-CSF,  the donor  will undergo  leukapheresis.  
Leukapheresis  will be performed  on a continuous  flow cell separator  according  to institutional  
standards.  Mononuclear  cell fractions  will be pooled.  Isolation  of CD34+  cells will be 
performed  with the CliniMACS  TM System,  Miltenyi  Biotec.  
• Pheresis  will aim for a collection  target  of at least  6 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg  recipient  body  
 
weight  if possible  following  one or two leukapheresis  procedures.  The collection  target  of 6 
million  will permit  the target  of 5 million  CD34+  cells to be reached  post-processing.  There  is 
no cap on CD34+  cell dose  (see below).  
• Bone  marrow  harvest  will not be performed.  
• The apheresis  product  will be first co-incubated  with the CliniMacs  CD34  reagent  (antibody - 
coated  paramagnetic  particles).  After magnetic  labeling  and washing,  the cells are passed  
through  a high-gradient  magnetic  separation  column  in the CliniMACS  clinical  cell selection  
device.  Magnetically  labeled  CD34+  cells are retained  in the magnetized  column,  and CD34 - 
cells flow through  as the effluent  and are discarded.  The CD34+  cells retained  in the column  
are eluted  by removing  the magnetic  field and washing  the cells through  the column.  The 
final CD34+  cell enriched  product  is concentrated  by centrifugation  and tested  before  final 
release.  
• Before  infusion,  the CD34+  cells will be washed  in normal  saline  for intravenous  infusion  
containing  1% human  serum  albumin  and suspended  in a small  but unrestricted  volume  per 
MSKCC  standards.  
• QC testing  is TNC count,  flow cytometry  phenotypic  analyses  of CD45,  CD34,  and CD3,  and 
viability  by 7-AAD,  gram  stain,  and culture.  
• The haplo -identical  CD34+  cell product  can be collected  in advance  of day 0  if  this  is 
required  for scheduling  purposes  and cryopreserved.  The collection  should  occur  after the 
patient  has been  admitted  to guard  against  collection  of haplo -identical  cells for a patient  
whose  transplant  is subsequently  cancelled.  
• On day 0 or +1, patients  will receive  an infusion  of haplo -identical  CD34+  cell-enriched,  T-cell 
depleted  G-CSF-mobilized  PBSC.

IRB Number: 12 -153 A(14)  
Approval date: 29 -Jan-2018   
  
 
• The target  of CD34+  cells  to be infused  as the haplo -identical  graft  is approximately  5 
x 106/kg. Higher  doses  can be given  only if the cap on CD3+  cells  is met. 
• To guard  against  permanent  engraftment  of the haplo -identical  graft,  the CD3+  dose  
will be capped  at a maximum  of 8 x 103/kg. 
• Due to the stringent  T-cell depletion,  no significant  GVHD  from the haplo -identical  cells is 
anticipated.  
• The CD34+  T-cell depleted  PBSC  will be infused  intravenously  over approximately  3-15 
minutes  per standard  of care with close  monitoring  of vital signs.  The patient  will be pre- 
medicated  as for blood  product  transfusions.  
• The following  details  will be collected  about  the haplo -donor:  age, relationship  to patient,  
gender,  weight,  10 allele  HLA-match,  ABO blood  group,  CMV  serostatus,  infused  CD34+  
dose,  infused  CD3+  dose,  day/date  of infusion,  and whether  the product  was administered  
fresh  or cryopreserved/  thawed.  
 
9.6 Growth  Factor  (Filgrastim  or G-CSF)  
 
G-CSF 5 mcg/kg  once -twice  daily IV or once  daily SQ (dose  rounded  to vial size to a maximum  of 
480 mcg)  will be given  to all transplant  recipients  from day +7 until ANC recovery.  
10.1 EVALUATION  DURING  TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
 
10.2 Prophylaxis  Against  Infection  
 
Patients  will be treated  according  to the allogeneic  BMT standard  of care guidelines  and will be 
given  prophylaxis  against  1) Pneumocystis,  2) Herpes  simplex  and Herpes  Zoster,  and 3) fungal  
infections.  Sero-positive  patients  will be closely  monitored  for activation  of  CMV  and  CMV 
viremia  will be treated  according  to the BMT  guidelines.  
10.3 Transfusions  
 
Following  initiation  of the pre-transplant  cytoreduction,  all blood  products  for transfusion  (with  
the exception  of the stem  cell graft)  will be irradiated  as per MSKCC  guidelines.  
 
10.4 Prophylaxis  Against  Menstrual  Bleeding  
 
Post-pubertal  females  will be considered  for hormonal  therapy  to suppress  menses  unless  a 
specific  contra -indication  to estrogen  exists.  
 
10.5 Nutritional  Support  
 
Physicians  will monitor  nutritional  status,  and high-calorie  supplementation  and vitamin  
supplements  will be administered  as clinically  indicated  per standard  practice.  
 
10.6 Correlative  Studies  
 
Laboratory  studies  will be performed  on the CB graft  using  a maximum  of 0.5%  of each  unit on 
the day of thaw investigating  factors  associated  with unit dominance  in patient  engraftment.  The 
correlative  studies  will include:

• Standard  characterization  of each  unit by flow cytometry  (Clinical  Laboratory,  Supervisor  
Katherine  Smith)  including  analysis  of CD34+  and T cells (standard  of care and billable).  This 
can be performed  on < 5 million  mononuclear  cells.  
• Analysis  of the Killer  Ig-like receptor  (K IR) genotype  to assess  if alloreactive  NK cells are 
involved  in unit predominance  (Dr Katherine  Hsu‟s laboratory).  
As a maximum  of 0.5%  of each  unit will be used  for research,  these  studies  may be limited  by 
the number  of cells available.  Studies  will be prioritized  by the Principle  Investigator  according  to 
the cell number  available.  
 
Laboratory  research  studies  will be performed  on the patient  blood  post-transplant . 
• To test if NK alloreactivity  drives  proliferation  supporting  haplo -PBSC  engraftment  we will 
specifically  document  NK expansion  in vivo by following  the phenotypic  and functional NK 
repertoires  at serial  time-points  post-transplant,  and compare  these  to the phenotypic  and 
functional  repertoire  of the donor  and patient  pre-transplant.  Expansion  of NK populations  
can be followed  by 12-14 color  flow cytometry.  Activation  markers  include  intracellular  IFN-γ 
and CD107  (LMP -1, a marker  of cytotoxic  degranulation).  
 
• To test the recovery  of the immune  system.  
 
 
10.7 Post -transplant  Evaluation  
Post-transplant  evaluations  are summarized  in the following  table.  Scheduled  evaluations  
for day 21 should  be performed  +/-2 days,  for day 28 should  be performed  +4/-2 days.  For day 
60, evaluations  should  be performed  +/-7 days.  For day 100, evaluations  should  be performed  
+/- 10 days.  For 6 and 9 months  should  be done  +/-14 days,  and 1 year,  18 months,  2 years  
should  be performed  +/-30 days of the targeted  date.  Immune  studies  will be done  per MSKCC  
standard  of care.  Evaluations  may be with-held at the treating  physicians  discretion  (eg if the 
patient  has  relapsed  or is critically  ill). Also,  additional  tests   will be performed  as  clinically  
indicated.

* If day 21 BM is not possible  or the patient  can be adequately  assessed  from the peripheral  
blood,  peripheral  blood  chimerism  should  be performed  as a substitute.  Also,  if BM studies  are 
done  prior to day 100 for clinical  purposes  and it is thought  that a repeat  is not clinically  
indicated  then day 100 studies  can be done  on blood  only. 
** Immune  function  and NK cell recovery  testing  can be withheld  if the patient  has very low 
circulating  white  blood  cells making  testing  impossible.  Also,  if immune  recovery  studies  are 
done  for clinical  care purposes  and it is thought  that a repeat  is not clinically  indicated  they can 
be withheld.  
During  the first 100 days patients  will be closely  monitored  as  per standard  of care.  Acute  
GVHD  will be assessed  and graded  according  to MSKCC   guidelines.   To  determine   acute  
GVHD  grading,  clinical  data will be collected  weekly  or bi-weekly  for the first 100 days.  
Research  blood  (1-4 tablespoons/  week)  will be obtained  to assess  the recovery  of NK cells as 
indicated  in the Table.  
 
10.8 Evaluation  > 100 Days  Post -transplant  
 
These  should  include:  history  and physical  examinations,  blood  counts  and chemistries  
including  liver function  tests  at a minimum  of approximately  every  6-8 weeks  until 6 months,  
then at a minimum  of approximately  every  three  months  for one year,  and at approximately  3-6 
month  intervals  until 2 years  post transplant  and then at least annually  as clinically  indicated.  
The patient‟s referring  physician,  in consultation  with the MSKCC  transplant  physician,  may 
assist  with follow -up. 
Chronic  GVHD  will be diagnosed  and graded  according  to MSKCC  criteria.  Assessments  
will be obtained  at approximately  day 100, 6, 12 and 24 months  after transplant  and at 
additional  time points  as clinically  indicated.  Patients  who develop  chronic  GVHD  will be treated  
according  to the current  standards  of care.  
Bone  marrow  aspirate  with analysis  for chimerism  and disease  status  should  be performed  
at 6 months  and one year post transplant  if clinically  indicated.  Blood  chimerism  should  be done  
at 6, 12, and 24 months.  Lymphoid  immunophenotyping  per MSKCC  standards  for immune  
recovery  assessment  will be evaluated  as per MSKCC  BMT standard  of  care  guidelines.  
Patients  will be vaccinated  as per MSKCC  guidelines.  Also,  research  blood  (approximately  20 
cc) will be obtained  to assess  the recovery  of NK on days 180 and 1 year.  
11.1 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
11.2 Toxicity  Grading  
Page  32 of 
43 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 12 -153 A(14)  
Approval date: 29 -Jan-2018   
  
 
Toxicities  will be graded  according  to Adult  BMT Guidelines.  
 
11.3 Total  Body  Irradiation  (TBI)  
 
Nausea  and vomiting:  most  patients  will experience  nausea  and vomiting  after irradiation  
which  can be significantly  diminished  with anti-emetics.  Parotitis:  some  patients  may experience  
symptomatic  parotitis  within  the first 24 hours  post radiation.  This resolves  spontaneously  over 
several  days.  Diarrhea:  most  patients  develop  some  diarrhea  in the first week  post irradiation  
which  is treated  symptomatically.  Fever:  low grade  fever  may occur  for 24 hr post irradiation.  
This is treated  symptomatically.  Skin changes:  Erythema  may occur  in patients  within  24 hours  
and resolves  in 2-3 days.  Most patients  will get some  degree  of hyperpigmentation  within  2-3 
weeks.  Alopecia  is always  seen  but is usually  reversible.  Myelosuppression  and immune  
suppression  is a major  toxicity  and is treated  by donor  stem  cell infusion  and supportive  care.  
Mucositis:  most  patients  will develop  moderate  to severe  mucositis  of the oral and GI tracts  
which  will be managed  with aggressive  supportive  care.  High doses  of radiation  in combination  
with high dose  chemotherapy  may contribute  to damage  to vital organs  such  as the lung or the 
liver that is sometimes  associated  with myeloablative  conditioning  but is not attributable  to one 
specific  agent.  Late effects  include  cataracts,  sterility,  growth  retardation,  second  malignancies  
and hypothyroidism.  Cataract  formation  is seen  in < 30% of patients  treated  with 
hyperfractionated  TBI. Sterility  is extremely  common  following  total body irradiation  and 
administration  of alkylating  chemotherapy  with the risk increasing  with the number  of years  
since  puberty.  Hypothyroidism  will be routinely  monitored  post transplant  and treated  with 
hormonal  replacement  as indicated.  
 
11.4 Cyclophosphamide  
 
Nausea  and vomiting:  virtually  all patients  will experience  nausea  and vomiting  after high 
dose  cyclophosphamide.  This can be significantly  diminished  with anti-emetics.  Diarrhea:  most  
patients  develop  some  diarrhea  in the first week  post cyclophosphamide.  This is treated  
symptomatically.  Myelosuppression  and immune  suppression  is a major  toxicity  and is treated  
by donor  stem  cell infusion  and supportive  care.  Mucositis:  most  patients  will develop  moderate  
to severe  mucositis  of the oral and GI tracts  which  will be managed  with aggressive  supportive  
care.  Skin changes:  Transient  skin rashes  have been  described.  Alopecia  is always  seen  but is 
usually  reversible.  Hemorrhagic  cystitis  is a potential  complication,  can be variable  in severity  
and occasionally  can be severe.  The risk of cystitis  will be reduced  by aggressive  supportive  
care.  Fluid weight  gain and edema  is associated  with this fluid flush but is transient  and can be 
treated  with diuretics  if necessary.  A syndrome  of inappropriate  anti-diuretic  hormone  (SIADH)  
causing  hyponatremia  can be seen  but is transient  and will spontaneously  resolve  after drug 
administration.  Cardiomyopathy  has been  described  with cyclophosphamide  but is very rare. 
High doses  of cyclophosphamide  in combination  with high dose  radiation  may contribute  to 
damage  of vital organs  such  as the lung or the liver. This is sometimes  associated  with the 
myeloablative  conditioning  as used  in this study  but is not attributable  to one specific  agent.  
Late effects  include  sterility  and the possibilities  of second  cancers.  
 
11.5 Fludarabine  
Fludarabine  may contribute  to nausea,  vomiting,  mouth  sores,  and diarrhea  which  are 
primarily  due to the high dose  cyclophosphamide  and TBI. Jaundice  and elevations  of liver 
enzymes  have also been  described.  Transient  skin rashes  have been  described.  
Myelosuppression  and immune  suppression  is a major  toxicity  and is treated  by donor  stem  cell 
infusion  and supportive  care.  Effects  on the nervous  system  are not expected  at the doses  used  
in this protocol,  but if they occur  could  include  confusion,  coma,  weakness  or numbness,  loss of 
balance,  difficulty  walking,  or loss of vision  and could  be very serious  or lethal.

11.6 Thiotepa  
 
Side effects  of thiotepa  include:  alopecia,  nausea,  vomiting,  and diarrhea.  Thiotepa  can 
also cause  myelosuppression,  pancytopenia,  sterility  and fevers.  Other  less likely side effects  
include  dizziness  and transient  hepatic  transaminase  elevation.  Rare  but serious  side effects  
include  CNS toxicity  manifested  by headache,  mild cognitive  dysfunction,  disorientation,  
confusion,  irritability,  and bizarre  behavior;  as well as, interstitial  pneumonitis  and renal  failure.  
 
11.7 Mycophenolate  Mofetil  (MMF)  
 
The major  toxicity  of MMF  is immune  suppression  which  leads  to increased  risk  for 
infection.  This is managed  with aggressive  supportive  care with both prophylaxis  and treatment  
of infectious  complications.  Other  potential  side-effects  include  myelosuppression,  headache,  
insomnia,  aches  and pains,  rash,  nausea,  anorexia  and diarrhea.  There  is also a very rare side 
effect  known  as progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy  (PML),  which  is a progressive  
disease  of the nervous  system  that can cause  severe  disability  or death.  A very small  number  of 
cases  of PML have  been  reported  in patients  treated  with MMF.  PML can cause  hemiparesis,  
confusion,  cognitive  deficiencies  and ataxia.  
 
11.8 Cyclosporine -A (CSA)  
 
The major  toxicity  of CSA  is immune  suppression  which  leads  to increased  risk for infection.  
This is managed  with aggressive  supportive  care with both prophylaxis  and treatment  of 
infectious  complications.  Renal  dysfunction  is common  and is treated  with good  hydration  and 
reduction  of the dose  if necessary.  Electrolyte  abnormalities  involving  potassium  and 
magnesium  are also common  and electrolytes  must  be closely  monitored.  Increased  blood  
pressure  is common  and is treated  with anti-hypertensive  medication(s).   Neurological   side 
effects  include  tremor  (common),  seizures  (rare),  confusion,  ataxia,  cortical  blindness  (rare),  
and peripheral  neuropathies  and are usually  reversible  with cessation  of the medication.  While  
mild to moderate  microangiopathic  hemolysis  is relatively  common,  serious  thrombotic  
thrombocytopenic  purpura  (TTP)  is rarely  seen.  Gastrointestinal  side-effects  include  anorexia,  
nausea,  swollen  gums,  and hyperbilirubinemia.  Skin changes  include  hirsutism  and gingival  
hyperplasia.  
 
11.9 G-CSF (Neupogen)  
Side-effects  of G-CSF are generally  mild, include  bone  pain,  headaches,   body  aches,  
fatigue,  edema  and nausea  and are managed  with supportive  care.  Pleuro - or pericarditis  are 
seen  rarely  and are managed  by cessation  of the medication  and corticosteroids  if necessary.  
 
11.10  Mesna  (Mesnex®)  
 
Mesna  has little systemic  side effects;  side effects  that are observed  are usually  due to the 
concomitant  chemotherapy.  Mesna  is an uroprotectant  and is used  with the high dose  
cyclophosphamide.  
 
11.11  Blood  Product,  CB and PBSC  Infusions  
Infusions  of blood  products  may produce  volume  overload  which  can be managed  with 
diuretics.  They  may also induce  allergic  reactions  of variable  severity,  many  of which  can be 
prevented  or mitigated  by pre-medication  with antipyretics,  and antihistamines.  Any donor  or 
blood  product  may also transmit  serious  infections  (e.g.,  CMV,  hepatitis,  HIV).  To circumvent  
this, stem  cell and blood  donors  are screened  according  to AABB  and FACT  guidelines.  CMV  
Page  34 of 
43 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 12 -153 A(14)  
Approval date: 29 -Jan-2018   
  
 
antibody  negative  blood  products  will be used  in CMV  seronegative  individuals  whenever  
possible.  All blood  products  (other  than the stem  cell graft)  are irradiated  to circumvent  the risk 
of GVHD  caused  by contaminating  lymphocytes.  
Toxicities  potentially  associated  with the infusion  of the CB graft include  DMSO toxicity  and 
side effects  from red cells and may include  changes  in heart  rate or rhythm,  changes  in blood  
pressure,  fever,  chills,  sweats,  nausea/vomiting,  diarrhea,  abdominal  cramping,  headache,  
dyspnea,  presence  of DMSO  taste  and odor,  hemoglobinuria,  and acute  renal  failure.  However  
due to the dilution,  hydration,  and pre-medication  these  toxicities  are unlikely.  The process  of 
CB engraftment  can also be associated  with a pre-engraftment  syndrome  characterized  by 
fever  and manifestations  of capillary  leak syndrome.  This process  is highly  responsive  to 
corticosteroid  therapy  and this will be treated  according  to accepted  clinical  practice.  
The definitions and reporting of serious adverse events (SAEs) is defined in Section 17.2. 
 
12.0      CRITERIA  FOR  THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
Clinical  Endpoints  The primary  aim of this study  is to obtain  an estimate  of the speed  of 
neutrophil  recovery  after double -unit CBT with a T-cell depleted  haplo -identical  allograft.  Overall  
survival  and disease  free survival  at one and two years  will be monitored  as secondary  endpoints.  
 
12.1.  Neutrophil  and Platelet  Engraftment  and Graft  Failure  (GF) 
 
Patients  will be monitored  for donor  cell engraftment  as evidenced  by neutrophil  and platelet  
recovery  and donor  chimerism  in the marrow  and blood  at serial  time-points  post-transplant.  
 
The day of neutrophil  recovery  is defined  as the first of 3 consecutive  days in which  the absolute  
neutrophil  count  (ANC)  is > 0.5. The cumulative  incidence  of neutrophil  recovery  will be reported  at 
day 45 post-transplant.  Sustained  neutrophil  engraftment  is neutrophil  engraftment  without  
secondary  graft failure.  
 
The day of platelet  recovery  is defined  as the first of 3 consecutive  days in which  platelet  counts  
are > 20,000  without  requiring  platelet  transfusions  in the previous  7 days.  The cumulative  incidence  
of platelet  recovery  will be reported  at day 180. 
 
Engraftment  of each  CB unit and the haplo -identical  donor  will be defined  tracked  at serial  time- 
points.  
 
Primary  graft  failure  is diagnosed  when  the patient  fails to achieve  an ANC  0.5 within  the 
first 45 days post-transplant.  Infusion  of another  source  of stem  cells as a treatment  of graft failure  
prior to day 45 will also be considered  primary  graft failure.  Patients  who die before  day 45 without  
count  recovery  will be classed  as graft failures  after day 28 and as not evaluable  if death  occurs  
without  count  recovery  between  days 0-28. Should  evaluation  of primary  graft failure  indicate  that 
the patient's  leukemia  has persisted  or recurred  the patient  will be classified  as having  progressive  
disease  or relapse  and not as having  primary  graft failure.  
 
Secondary  graft  failure  is defined  as donor -derived  neutrophil  engraftment  followed  by severe  
neutropenia  (ANC  < 0.5 for more  than 7 consecutive  days unresponsive  to growth  factors  in the 
absence  of relapse),  or an absence  of donor  cells in the marrow  and/or  blood  without  leukemic  
relapse.  Patients  with suspected  graft failure  will be evaluated  with bone  marrow  biopsy  to assess  
hematopoiesis  and to test for residual  or recurrent  leukemia.  Patients  who suffer  graft failure  will be 
managed  per MSKCC  BMT guidelines.

12.2.  Graft -Versus -Host  Disease  (GVHD)  
 
Acute  GVHD  is manifested  by  skin rash,  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea  and ulceration  of the 
intestines,  hyperbilirubinemia  and hepatitis,  and suppressed  or delayed  recovery  of  the 
hematopoietic  and immune  system.  Standard  clinical  criteria,  and histological  grading  of skin, liver or 
gastrointestinal  pathology  where  possible,  will be used  to establish  and grade  acute  GVHD.  In the 
first 100 days after transplant  patients  will be assessed  by a transplant  physician  for the 
development  of acute  GVHD  approximately  weekly.  Data will be collected  as per standard  practice  
of the Adult  BMT service.  Patients  with moderate  to severe  acute  GVHD  (grade  II-IV) will be treated  
as per standard  of care.  Patients  failing  to respond  to steroids  will be considered  for treatment  with 
standard  or experimental  immunosuppressive  agents  Chronic  GVHD  is characterized  to varying  
degrees  by sclerosis  of lacrimal  and salivary  ducts,  scleroderma -like changes  of the skin, chronic  
inflammation  and scarring  of the gastrointestinal  tract with consequent  malabsorption  and diarrhea,  
inflammation  of the liver, suppression  of the immune  system  and occasionally  other  auto-immune  
phenomena  (eg auto-immune  hemolysis)  or involvement  of other  organs   (eg  pulmonary  
involvement).  Chronic  GVHD  will be diagnosed  and graded  according  to  the  MSK  criteria   and 
treated  with standard  or experimental  immunosuppressive  therapy.  Patients  will be assessed  for 
GVHD  at day 100, 6 months,  1, and 2 years.  
 
12.3.  Transplant -related  Mortality  (TRM)  
 
TRM  is defined  as death  at any time from the commencement  of pre-transplant  conditioning  due 
to any cause  other  than malignant  relapse  (with the exception  of accidents  such  as automobile  
accidents).  Stopping  rules  are in place  to consider  cessation  of the study  if TRM  at day 100 is 
excessive  (see Section  14). 
 
12.4.  Relapse  
 
Relapse  of malignancy  is a secondary  endpoint  of this study  and will be defined  by accepted  
clinical  practice  eg an increasing  number  of blasts/malignant  cells of recipient  origin  in the marrow  
over 5%, by the presence  of circulating  peripheral  blasts,  or by the presence  of malignant  cells in 
any extramedullary  site. Cytogenetic  (eg if a diagnosis  of CML)  or flow cytometric  analysis  or 
molecular  studies  of the marrow  and/or  peripheral  blood  may also be obtained  for the diagnosis  of 
relapse.  Isolated  molecular  persistence  or reappearance  of bcr-abl without  cytogenetic  positivity  will 
not be considered  relapse.  
 
 
12.5 Immunologic  Recovery  
 
Immunophenotyping  of T, B, and NK cells,  and T-cell proliferations  in response  to non-specific  
mitogens  will be performed  at serial  time points  after transplant  to measure  immune  recovery  as 
outlined  in section  10.6.  Patients  may be re-immunized  post-transplant  according  to the MSKCC  
guidelines.  Immune  recovery  data will be analyzed  at completion  of study  and interim  analysis  of 
immune  recovery  will be permitted.  
 
13.0CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
Patients  may be removed  from the study  at any point  deemed  appropriate  by the Principal  
Investigator  or if requested  by the patient.  However,  once  the pre-transplant  conditioning  regimen  is 
given,  patients  will continue  on study  until after administration  of their stem  cells and will receive  
supportive  care as appropriate.  Failure  to rescue  the patient  with stem  cells after cytoreduction  
would  most  likely be fatal.

14.0BIOSTATISTICS 
 
Clinical  Endpoints  
 
A phase  2 study  design  will be utilized  to obtain  preliminary  estimates  of clinical  efficacy  and 
safety  of a myeloablative  cord blood  transplant  combined  with a T-cell depleted  haplo -identical  
allograft.  The population  under  study  is pediatric  and adult patients  with high-risk or advanced  
hematologic  malignancies.  At the time of transplant  patients  will be classified  into standard  (Arm A) 
or high (Arm  B) risk groups  (see section  6). A maximum  of 26 evaluable  patients  will be accrued  into 
Arm A (standard  risk for TRM)  and 75 into Arm B (high  risk for TRM).  The accrual  period  will be 
approximately  3-4 years  with an additional  two years  of follow  up after accrual  is completed.  All 
endpoints  in this study  will be assessed  separately  in the two risk groups.  
 
The primary  endpoint  of the study  is the number  of days to neutrophil  recovery.  Historically,  the 
median  time to neutrophil  recovery  for myeloablative  double  unit cord transplant  patients  is 25 days 
with all engrafting  patients  recovering  neutrophils  by day 45. A design  that differentiates  between  
population  median  recovery  times  of 25 days and 15 days will be used  to assess  the neutrophil  
recovery  rate in this trial. A truncated  exponential  maximum  likelihood  test will be used  to test this 
hypothesis.  For the purpose  of the power  calculation,  it is assumed  that the neutrophil  recovery  
times  are exponentially  distributed  and for the anticipated  5% of the patients  that do not recover,  the 
recorded  time will be day 46. This design  has power  equal  to 0.90 if the  population   median  
neutrophil  recovery  time for patients  treated  under  the proposed  approach  is 15 days;  the one-sided  
test size is 0.10 when  the median  recovery  time is 25 days.  
 
In addition,  the time to platelet  recovery  will also be tested  relative  to MSKCC  historical  controls.  
Based  on prior data,  the null hypothesis  is that the median  time to platelet  recovery  is 48 days.  The 
26 patient  study  has power  equal  to 0.90 if the population  median  time to platelet  recovery  is 29 
days in the current  study.  Patients  that do not have  platelet  recovery  will be scored  as day 180. A 
one-sided  0.10 size test will be used  to determine  if platelet  recovery  is improved  relative  to the 
historical  data.  
 
After the initial  18 high risk (Arm B) patients  were  treated  on the protocol  with a haplo -identical  
peripheral  blood  stem  cell graft of 1.0 - 3.0 x 106 CD34+  cells/kg,  the haplo -identical  CD34+  cell 
dose  was increased  to 5.0 x 106/kg due to promising  results  in the initial  experience  with 3 million  
CD34+  cells.  The initial  26 patient  high risk cohort  was completed  and the primary  endpoint  of ANC 
recovery  was met. To further  ascertain  the clinical  efficacy  of the addition  of a higher  dose  of haplo - 
identical  CD34+  cells,  the number  of patients  studied  will be increased.  An additional  49 patients  will 
be added  to Arm B as a high risk patient  extension  cohort  for a total of 75 patients.  The Arm B 
extension  cohort  will utilitize  the same  efficacy  evaluations  as the primary  cohort.  The stopping  rules  
below  for the high risk Arm B have been  amended  to include  the primary  and extension  cohorts.  
 
The study  design  includes  early termination  in the event  of excessive  graft failure,  severe  acute  
GVHD,  or early TRM/  death  from relapse  within  the first 100 days post-transplant.  The power  
calculations  used  to assess  the adequacy  of the treatments  with respect  to these  endpoints  are 
given  as guidelines  in the tables  below.  In the event  that the stopping  boundary  is crossed  in one 
risk group,  the study  will continue  accrual  in the other  risk group.  The stopping  rules for the High 
Risk (Arm  B) cohort  includes  the primary  26 patients  cohort  and the additional  49 patient  extension  
cohort.

Each  patient  will followed  for at least two years  and subsequently  as clinically  indicated.  If the 
study  is not terminated  early due to graft failure,  grade  IV GVHD,  or TRM/early death,  the probability  
of remaining  alive for one year will be assessed.  Arm A includes  patients  with high risk hematologic  
malignancies  but with standard  TRM  risk for CBT.  Arm B includes  high risk patients  not usually  
offered  transplant  or those  considered  at very high risk for TRM.  
 
For the standard  risk group  (Arm  A), a single  stage  design  that differentiates  between  
population  1 year overall  survival  rates  of 0.60 and 0.85 will be used  determine  treatment  activity.  
The treatment  will be considered  insufficiently  active  if the probability  of remaining  alive for 1 year in 
this patient  population  is less than or equal  to 0.60.  If at least 20 of the 26 patients  remain  alive for 
one year,  the treatment  will be considered  successful.  This design  has power  greater  than 0.90 if the 
probability  of overall  survival  at one year is 0.85,  using  a 0.10 one-sided  size test. The high risk 
group  (Arm  B) has a larger  sample  size and survival  will be analyzed  according  to disease  risk and 
patient  comorbidity  scores. , 
 
The use of a one-stage  design  is due to the one-year follow -up time for this endpoint.  For each  
group,  the Kaplan -Meier  estimates  of overall  and disease -free survival  will be computed  over time.  
In addition  to the survival  analyses,  the cumulative  incidence  of neutrophil  and platelet  engraftment,  
grade  2-4 acute  GvHD,  chronic  GvHD,  TRM,  relapse,  and length  of hospitalization  will be computed.  
Kernel  smoothing  will be used  to assess  the level of chimerism,  neutrophil  count,  platelet  count,  NK, 
T cell and B cell populations  over time.  The outcomes  of this study  will also be compared  to MSKCC  
double -unit CBT historical  controls.

15.3 Randomization  
 
Not applicable.  
 
16.1 DAT A M ANAGEMENT ISSUES 
 
A Research  Study  Assistant  (RSA)  will be assigned  to the study  at MSKCC.  The 
responsibilities  of the RSA include  project  compliance,  data collection,  abstraction  and entry,  
data reporting,  regulatory  monitoring,  problem  resolution  and prioritization,  and coordination  
of the activities  of the protocol  study  team.  
 
The data collected  for this study  will be entered  into a secured  database  Clinical  
Research  Database  (CRDB)  and a database  in a secured  Adult  BMT drive.  Source  
documentation  will be available  to support  the computerized  patient  record.  
 
16.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient  accruals  and 
completeness  of registration  data.  Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  
missing  data and inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates  and extent  and accuracy  of evaluations  and 
follow -up will be monitored  periodically  throughout  the study  period  and potential  problems  
will be brought  to the attention  of the study  team  for discussion  and action.  
Random -sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted  by the 
study  team,  at a minimum  of two times  per year,  more  frequently  if indicated.  
 
16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  Plans  (DSM)  at Memorial   Sloan -Kettering   cancer  
Center  were  approved  by the National  Cancer  Institute  in Se ptember  2001.   The  plans  
address  the new policies  set forth by the NCI in the document  entitled  “Policy  of the National  
Cancer  Institute  for Data and Safety  Monitoring  of Clinical  Trials”  which  can be found  at:  
Http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/r  esearchers/dsm/index.html . The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  were  
established  and are monitored  by the Clinical  Research  Administration  The MSKCC  Data 
and Safety  Monitoring  Plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at:  
http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm . 
 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by which  clinical  trials are monitored  for data,  
safety  and quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  
protocol  monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff

education  on clinical  research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus 
there  are two institutional  committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our 
clinical  trials programs.  The committees:  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for 
Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III 
clinical  trials, report  to the Center‟s Research  Council  and Institutional  Review  Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each protocol  will be assessed  
for its level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH 
sponsored,  in-house  sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will be 
addressed,  and the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  
activation.  
 
17.1 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
17.2 Privacy  
 
MSKCC‟s Privacy  Office  may allow  the use and disclosure  of protected  health  
information  pursuant  to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.  The use and 
disclosure  of protected  health  information  will be limited  to the individuals  described  in the 
Research  Authorization  form.  A Research  Authorization  form must  be completed  by the 
Principal  Investigator  and approved  by the IRB and Privacy  Board  (IRB/PB).  
17.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  
hospitalization  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or 
require  hospitalization  may be considered  serious  when,  based  upon  medical  judgment,  
they may jeopardize  the patient  or subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
Note: Hospital  admission  for a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an 
SAE.  
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  signs  consent.  SAE reporting  is required  
for 30-days after the participant ‟s last investigational  treatment  or intervention.  Any events  
that occur  after the 30-day period  and that are at least  possibly  related  to protocol  treatment  
must  be reported.  
 
If an SAE requires  submission  to the IRB office  per IRB SOP  RR-408 „Reporting  of Serious  
Adverse  Events‟, the SAE report  must  be sent to the IRB within  5 calendar  days of the event.  
The IRB requires  a Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE report  be submitted  
electronically  to the SAE Office  as follows:

Studied Period (years):  
Estimated date first subject enrolled: October 2015 
Estimated date last subject completed: April 2018 Phase of Development:  
3b 
Objectives:  
Primary:    
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of peramivir administered intravenously (IV) in elderly subjects 
with acute uncomplicated influenza infection and in subjects with acute uncomplicated influenza 
infection who are at higher risk for influenza complications. 
Secondary:  
• To describe the pharmacokinetics (PK)  of IV peramivir in elderly and high risk subjects with acute 
uncomplicated influenza.  
• To evaluate the effectiveness of IV peramivir in elderly and high risk subjects with acute 
uncomplicated influenza . 
• To evaluate the incidence of influenza complications, specifically otitis media, sinusitis, bronchitis or pneumonia requiring antibiotic use diagnosed after initiation of treatment 
Methodology:  
This is a multicenter, single -arm, open- label study will evaluate the safety, PK and effectiveness of a 
single dose of IV peramivir in elderly subjects (≥ 65 years of age) with acute uncomplicated influenza and 
in subjects with acute uncomplicated influenza at higher risk for influenza complications.  
Subjects m eeting the inclusion/ exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study. Following treatment on 
study Day 1, subjects will undergo in- clinic follow-up assessments on Days 3, 7, and 14.  
All subjects/caregivers will record the following information in a subject diary: 
• Assessment of the presence and severity of each of the 7 symptoms of influenza on a 4-point severity 
scale (0, absent; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe) twice daily through Day 13, and prior to the subject’s 
clinic visit on Day  14; or until eac h symptom is 0 or 1 for 48 hours. 
• Temperature measurements (oral) will be taken with an electronic thermometer provided by the 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-306 
 6 Sponsor, approximately every 12 hours until temperature normalizes for 48 hours ( i.e., temperature 
without antipyretic is <  37.4○C/99.4oF orally for 4 measurements). With the exception of the 
Screening/ Baseline measurement, all temperature measurements will be obtained at least 4  hours 
after, or immediately before, administration of oral acetaminophen or other antipyretic medications, if 
taken.  
• The type, date, and time of medications used for the symptomatic treatment of influenza -related 
symptoms. 
• Assessment of the subject’s ability to perform usual activities using a 0  to 10 visual analogue scale 
once daily through Day 14, where 0 = Unable to perform usual activities at all, and 10  = Able to 
perform all usual activities fully.  
An adequate nasal swab specimen will be collected from all enrolled subjects at Baseline (pre-dose) for virus subtype identification and quantitative virologic assessments and at the follow -up assessments on 
study Days  3, 7 and Day 14.  
Specimens from all subjects yielding influenza virus will also be assessed for susceptibility to 
neuraminidase inhibitors (Day 1 and last specimen yielding influenza viru s on culture). A central 
laboratory will perform all virologic assessments.  
Plasma samples for determination of drug concentration on subjects randomized to peramivir will be drawn as follows: 
Up to 3 blood samples will be drawn, where possible, during the following time periods, beginning from the end of dosing until release from the site:  
• One time point immediately following completion of the infusion 
• One time point from 30 minutes to 1 hour post-infusion 
• One time point from 1 hour to 3 hours post-infus ion  
Adverse events and concomitant medications will be monitored at each scheduled visit from the 
Screening assessment to final study visit. Clinical laboratory investigations (chemistries, hematology, and 
urinalysis) will be collected at Baseline, and  Day 7 visits. Day 14 clinical laboratory investigations will 
only be collected if Day 7 labs are in the opinion of the investigator, significantly abnormal or clinically changed from baseline.  In additional, clinical laboratory investigations may be conducted at any time for patient management / safety reasons.  Safety and tolerability will be evaluated through assessments of 
adverse events, laboratory analyses (clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), vital signs and physical examinations at the time points indicated in the schedule of assessments.  
A subject’s duration of participation in this study is expected to be approximately 14 days and will include up to 4 clinic visits. Subjects will be discharged from this study on Day 14. Additional, 
unscheduled visits may be required for subjects who report symptoms of influenza of moderate or severe 
intensity at Day 14 or have persistent adverse events and/or treatment -emergent laboratory findings that 
require medical monitoring or management.  
Number o f subjects (planned):  
Approximately 120 subjects will be enrolled. A minimum of 80 elderly subjects ( ≥ 65 years) will be 
enrolled . 
Criteria for inclusion:  
Subjects must meet the following criteria to be eligible for study participation:  
1. Male and female subjects age ≥  18 years.  
2. The subject must meet one of the following two criteria: 
a. A positive influenza Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) and/or a Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) -approved polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) test  and at least one clinical sign or symptom 
consistent with influenza (see 2b below) . 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL BCX1812-306 
 7 OR 
b. Clinical signs and symptoms consistent with acute influenza infection consisting of an oral 
temperature ≥100°F (37.8°C) with at least one respirator y symptom of at least moderate severity 
(cough or rhinitis) and at least one constitutional symp tom of at least moderate severity (myalgia 
[aches and pains], headache, feverishness, or fatigue). Note: Enrollment at each site by clinical 
symptoms alone will be approved by the Sponsor at the beginning of each influenza season 
once influenza has been confirmed in the local community. The Sponsor may withdraw 
approval for symptomatic screening for any season based upon trends in influenza surveillance data. Prior to Sponsor approval or after approval is withdrawn, Criteria 2 must be met by a positive influenza RAT test and/or PCR. During the period of approval, 
clinical symptoms alone will be adequate to meet Criteria 2.
 
3. Onset of symptoms no more than 48 hours before presentation for screening. However, due to 
historically delayed presentation for medical care in  the adult population, approximately 20% of the 
elderly population may be enrolled with symptoms starting > 48-hours but ≤ 72-hours prior to 
presentation for screening. Note: Time of onset of illness is defined as either (1) the time when the 
temperature (either oral or rectal) was first measured as elevated (at least one °C of elevated temperature), OR (2) the time when the subject e xperienced the presence of at least one respiratory 
symptom AND the presence of at least one constitutional symptom together. 
4. Either age ≥  65 years AND/ OR presence of one of the following risk factors: 
a. Pregnancy, including women who are up to 2 weeks post-partum   
b. Resident of a nursing home or long-term care facility 
c. History of chronic lung disease including obstr uctive pulmonary disease (COPD), persistent 
asthma or cystic fibrosis 
d. History of heart disease including myocardial infa rction, angina requiring treatment, congestive 
heart failure requiring treatment, arrhythmia includi ng atrial fibrillation and valvular dysfunction 
e. History of blood dyscracias including sickle cell anemia and thalassemia 
f. History of renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] < 50 mL/min as determined by the 
Cockcroft-Gault formula) including patients on dialysis 
g. History of liver disease including cirrhosis 
h. Mild to moderate immunocompromised, includi ng: history of human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) disease on stable highly active antiretr oviral therapy (HAART) with last known CD4+ 
count ≥ 200 cells/µL: known neutropenia with ANC > 500 cells/µL; chronic corticosteroid use of 
< 20 mg/d for any indication.  
i. History of diabetes mellitus (Type I or II) 
j. Morbid obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 40)  
k. American Indian or Alaskan native 
5. Written informed consent 
Criteria for Exclusion: 
Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study: 
1. Subjects who in the opinion of the investigator re quire hospital admission to treat medical condition(s) 
which, in the Investigator’s opinion, co uld represent complications of influenza. Note, 
hospitalization is not an excl usion criterion when it is the usual practice of the treating 
institution to hospitalize el derly patients with acute uncomplicated influenza.  
2. Women who plan to breast-feed for the first 48 ho urs after study drug administration. However, 
women who agree to suspend breast feeding for 48 hours after study administration may participate.

 8 represent complications of influenza. 
6. Current clinical evidence, including clinical signs  and/or symptoms consistent with a bacterial 
infection, including: otitis media, bronchitis, sinusitis  and/or pneumonia, or active bacterial infection 
of any body site that requires therapy with oral or systemic antibiotics 
7. Immunization against influenza with live attenua ted virus vaccine in the previous 14 days 
8. History of alcohol abuse or drug addiction within 1 year prior to admission in the study 
9. Participation in a study of any investigational drug or device within the last 30 days 
10. Previous participation in study BCX1812-305 (p ediatric study) or BCX1812-306 (this study) 
Presence of any pre-existing illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would place the 
subject at an unreasonably increased risk through participation in this study or would make 
the subject unable to comply with the protocol 
Criteria for evaluation: 
Safety: Safety will be evaluated through assessments of Adverse Events (AEs), laboratory analyses (clinical 
chemistry, hematology and urinalysis), vital signs, and physical examinations.  
Pharmacokinetic: 
Plasma peramivir concentrations will be measure d by a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) assay. Concentrations will be utilized in determin ation of population PK 
parameters. 
Effectiveness: 
Clinical: 
 
• Time to alleviation of clinical influenza symptoms 
• Time to resolution of fever 
• Time to resumption of usual activities 
• Incidence of influenza -related hospitalizations 
• Incidence of hospital admission (for any reason) post treatment 
Virologic:  
• Changes in viral shedding measured by quantitative viral titer assay (TCID 50) and/or quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
• Change in influenza virus susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors 
Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration:  
Peramivir solution for infusion is a clear, iso-osmotic, sterile, nonpyrogenic solution in 200 mg per 20 mL 
(10 mg/mL) single-use glass vials. Subjects will receive a single dose of 600 mg peramivir diluted in 0.9 % saline, 0.45% saline, 5% dextrose or lactated Ringe r’s using the technique described in a separate drug 
preparation instruction sheet, administered intravenously over a period of 15 to 30 minutes. The drug product should be stored at room temper ature (excursion permitted to 59° to 86°F) 
Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration:  
Not Applicable 
Duration of Treatment: 
Following single IV dose of peramivir on Day 1, st udy duration for all subjects is expected to be 
approximately 14 days (including all visits). If a subject  has one or more persistent or recurrent symptoms 
of influenza (of the 7 symptoms assessed) of either mode rate or severe intensity at the Day 14 visit (± 2 
days), or if the subject has an unresolved AE and/or treatment-emergent laboratory finding that requires 
further medical management, then the subject may be evaluated in further follow-up visits, at the 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL BCX1812-306 
 9 Investigator’s discretion.  
Statistical methods: 
Sample Size:  
The study is designed to evaluate the safety and PK of IV administration of peramivir in elderly subjects 
(≥ 65 years) with influenza and in subjects with influenza infection at higher risk for influenza 
complications. The sample size is adequate to eval uate these objectives. Formal hypothesis testing will 
not be performed. 
Safety:  
Qualitative analyses will be performed for AE type, frequency and severity, as well as vital sign absolute 
values, clinical laboratory absolute values, and physical examination fi ndings and their respective changes 
from Baseline for all subjects. 
Pharmacokinetics:  
Plasma concentrations and covariates of interest w ill be evaluated in a meta-population analysis using 
mixed effect modeling techniques to estimate population PK parameters in each population ( ≥ 65 years vs 
< 65 years and at a high risk) and to identify pharm acokinetically-relevant covariates. Data will be 
compared to available PK data from other adult studi es of IV peramivir and included in this analysis.  
Effectiveness: 
Clinical and virologic endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics.

 17 5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1. Influenza Overview  
In healthy adults, influenza is usually self -limiting, with resolution of symptoms occurring within 5 to 
7 days because immune defenses shut down viral proliferation and shedding, clearing infected cells 
quickly. In acute uncomplicated influenza, tissue damage is limited, and secondary infections are uncommon. However, influenza is an important cause of morbidi ty and mortality in certain at- risk 
populations, and hospital admissions due to influenza- related illness place a seasonal burden on health 
care facilities. Furthermore, the symptoms of acute uncomplicated influenza are themselves debilitating, with return to normal health and activities delayed for 7 to 11 days ( Treanor, Hayden et al. 2000, Kohno, 
Kida et al. 2010 ). 
The emergence in 2009 of a novel strain of influenza A (H1N1pdm09), reviewed in ( Neumann, Noda et 
al. 2009) , led to the first influenza pandemic since the 1960’s. Severe illness with rapid evolution to 
respiratory failure, often in young adults, was reported from many countries including the United States (US) (Jain, Kamimoto et al. 2009, Louie, Acosta et al. 2009, Louie, Yang et al. 2012), Mexico 
(Dominguez-Cherit, Lapinsky et al. 2009, Perez-Padilla, de la Rosa-Zamboni et al. 2009) , Canada 
(Kumar, Zarychanski et al. 2009) , Chile (Cornejo, Tobar et al. 2011 ), Australia (Investigators, Webb et al. 
2011, Muscatello, Barr et al. 2011) , Italy (Nicolini, Claudio et al. 2011) , South Korea (Jeon, Chung et al. 
2011)  and Hong Kong ( Lee, Chan et al.  2011 ). Analysis of the pattern of morbidity with age showed a 
shift to earlier ages for the rates of severe pneumonia, hospitalization, and admission to intensive care (Chowell, Bertozzi et al. 2009, Dominguez-Cherit, Lapinsky et al. 2009, Jain, Kamimoto et al. 2009 ), as 
well as an increased incidence of ac ute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality in previously healthy 
young to middle- aged adults (Perez- Padilla, de la Rosa -Zamboni et al. 2009 ). In some countries, around 
2% of cases developed severe illness, often with rapid progression to life-threatening pneumonia. Most cases of severe and fatal illnesses reported up to early June 2009 were in adults between the ages of 30 
and 50 years ( World Health Organization [ WHO]). Pregnant women also showed an increased risk of 
hospitalization and death (Siston, Rasmussen et al. 2010) . Globally, the mortality from the pandemic 
through March to December of 2009 was estimated at 123,000 to 203,000, with the majority of patients under 65 (Simonsen, Spreeuwenberg et al. 2013 ). 
The well -documented morbidity and mortality from the 2009 influenza pandemic, and the emergence of 
two avian influenza viruses infecting humans in recent years, A/H5N1 (Writing Committee of the Second 
World Health Organization Consultation on Clinical Aspects of Human Infection with Avian Influenza, 
Abdel-Ghafar et al. 2008)  and A/H7N9 ( CDC 2013 , Gao, Cao et al. 2013) , serve to emphasize the 
continuing threat that influenza poses to public health as a result of emergence of new viral strains 
infecting populations with limited herd immunity. Changes in one or more influenza virus virulence 
determinants [recently reviewed by Tscherne. (Tscherne and Garcia-Sastre 2011 )] . 
5.2. Antiviral therapy for influenza  
Two classes of influenza antiviral agents are currently approved: adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors. Adamantanes are thought to interact with the M2 ion channel virus protein. Adamantanes have no activity against influenza B virus. When administered within 48 hours of illness onset, amantadine and 
rimantadine can reduce the severity and shorten the duration of acute uncomplicated influenza A illness 
among healthy adults. However, in recent years widespread resistance to adamantanes has been described 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-306 
 18 in viruses of the H3N2 sub- type (Bright, Medina et al. 2005) , and the influenza A (H1N1pdm09) strain 
also demonstrated adamantane resistance. This c lass of drugs is currently not recommended by the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for treatment of influenza (Centers for Disease and 
Prevention 2013) . 
Neuraminidase inhibitors are a newer class of drugs with activity against both influenza A and influenza 
B viruses. Approved neuraminidase inhibitors include zanamivir (Relenza® ), administered by inhalation, 
oseltamivir phosphate ( Tamiflu® ), an oral prodrug of the active agent, oseltamivir carboxylate, and 
peramivir (Rapivab ™), administered intravenously ( IV). Influenza neuraminidase is responsible for the 
release of new viral particles from infected cells and may also assist in the spreading of virus throu gh the 
mucus within the respiratory tract. When administered within 48  hours of illness onset, neuraminidase 
inhibitors can reduce the severity and shorten the duration of acute uncomplicated influenza illness among previously healthy adults.  
Peramivir is  a selective inhibitor of influenza viral neuraminidase with potent activity against influenza A 
and B subtypes, including influenza A (H1N1pdm09) ( CDC 2009)  and the recently described novel avian 
influenza A (H7N9) virus ( Cao, Xiao et al. 2013, Gao, Cao et al. 2013) . Although oseltamivir is widely 
used for the treatment of influenza, a need still exists for an effective treatment for influenza patients who 
present in the urgent care and emergency room settings, and in patients for whom compliance with 
effective del ivery of an oral medication is of concern (e.g. , patients with vomiting and diarrhea). 
Peramivir has been studied for the treatment of influenza in 2  settings: as a single dose treatment in acute 
uncomplicated influenza, and as a multiple dose treatment in patients who are hospitalized due to influenza.  
5.3. Previous Experience with Peramivir  
Peramivir hydrate for injection was first approved in Japan on 13 January 2010 under the trade name 
Rapiacta® by Shionogi & Co., Ltd. for the treatment of viral infection with influenza type A and type B. Marketing authorization for the treatment of children and infants ≥  28 days of age was obtained in Japan 
in October, 2010. Peramivir was recently approved in the United States ( US) in 2014 for the treatment of 
acute uncomplicated influenza in patients ≥  18 years and older who have been symptomatic for no more 
than 2 days.  
BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its partner, Shionogi & Co., Ltd have completed a total of ten Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of peramivir in the treatment of influenza. Seven studies exclusively or predominantly enrolled patients with acute uncomplicated influenza , 
including 1 in children. The remaining 3 studies were conducted in subjects who were hospitalized with 
influenza, 2 of which allowed children  or adolescents  to enroll . A thorough QT/QTc study of single IV  
doses of peramivir in healthy  adult subjects (Study BCX1812- 106) demonstrated that intravenous 
peramivir at a therapeutic dose of 600  mg and at a supra-therapeutic dose of 1200 mg was not associated 
with QTc prolongation or other repolarization abnormalities. 
5.3.1.  Clinical Experience in Adults  
5.3.1.1.  Peramivir Efficacy  
The pivotal study for the use of IV peramivir  to treat subjects with acute uncomplicated infl uenza is Study 
0722T0621, a Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose study that enrolled 300 Japanese 
adult subjects with confirmed influenza. Both dosages of peramivir evaluated  (single IV doses of 300 or 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-306 
 19 600 mg) significantly shortened the time to alleviation of influenza symptoms (duration of influenza, the  
primary endpoint) compared with placebo. 
Studies BCX1812-211, BCX1812-311, and BCX1812-212 provide supportive data for the use of single 
parenteral doses of peramivir to treat influenza in the outpatient setting; in these studies, peramivir was administered as a single dose via bilateral intramuscular (IM) injections to subjects with influenza. 
Exposure to peramivir by IM administration is bioequivalent to exposure from IV administration 
(BCX1812 -111 and BCX1812-113). 
Study BCX1812-211 was a Phase 2, randomized study that enrolled 344 subjects with acute, 
uncomplicated influenza who received placebo, 150 mg peramivir or 300 mg peramivir as a single, 
divided IM dose. Study BCX1812-311 was si milar in design and was planned as a Phase 3 study, but was 
terminated early after 82 subjects had enrolled and were randomized 2:1 to receive placebo or 300 mg 
peramivir in a single, divided IM dose. The study was terminated in order to study higher doses using a 
product with a higher concentration in subsequent studies. These 2 studies had almost identical eligibility 
criteria, had identical primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, and were conducted in successive 
influenza seasons. When the results from  studies BCX1812-211 and BCX1812- 311 were retrospectively 
combined in a post-hoc analysis, both primary and secondary endpoints for peramivir- treated subjects 
were improved compared to placebo.  
Study BCX1812-212 was a placebo-controlled study of 405 subjects who were randomized 1:1 to receive 
either placebo or 600 mg of peramivir as a single divided IM dose. This study was conducted during a season in which the dominant circulating strain of influenza A showed reduced susceptibility to 
peramivir, and the r esults showed a non-significant trend favoring peramivir in the primary endpoint of 
time to alleviation of symptoms.  
Three studies are included as additional efficacy studies. Study  0815T0631was a double -blind, 
double-dummy study of 1099 subjects from Japan, Taiwan or South Korea who were randomized to 
receive a single dose of IV peramivir (300 mg or 600 mg) or 5 days of oral oseltamivir twice daily (BID) . 
For the primary endpoint of time to alleviation of symptoms, both peramivir treatment regimens were 
non-inferior to oseltamivir. Study 0816T0632 was a double- blind, non -controlled study in Japan that 
enrolled 42 high-risk inpatients or outpatients with influenza; in this study, subje cts were randomized to 
receive 300 mg or 600 mg peramivir. The duration of influenza illness was shorter among subjects who received 600 mg doses of peramivir compared with those in the 300 mg treatment group, although the 
90% confidence intervals (CI) ove rlapped. Finally, Study 0918T0633 was a non- controlled, open- label 
study conducted in Japan in 117 pediatric subjects with influenza (either inpatient or outpatient). For the 
primary endpoint of duration of influenza illness, no differences were noted betw een the age groups of 
28 days to <  2 years, 2 to < 6 years, 6 to < 12 years, and 12 to < 16 years of age. 
5.3.1.2.  Peramivir Safety  
Safety  of various doses of peramivir in acute uncomplicated influenza has been evaluated in 1453 adults. 
The most frequently observed treatment emergent AEs ( TEAEs ) across all adult subjects with acute 
uncomplicated influenza treated with various doses of peramivir were diarrhea (7.4%), decreased 
neutrophil count (5.5%), and increased blood glucose (5.0%). The only events reported in ≥ 2% of 
subjects treated with peramivir 600 mg and for which the rate was greater than placebo were diarrhea (7.6% vs . placebo 7.0%), decreased neutrophil count (5.7% vs. placebo 0.0%), hyperglycemia (5.3% vs. 
placebo 4.8%) and urine leukocytes (2.8% vs. placebo 1.8%). Adverse event (AE) rates overall were 
similar to placebo and oseltamivir . No safety signals have emerged from these trials.

 20 5.4. Rationale for Study  
There is disagreement on the degree of benefit risk provided by NAIs. A 2012 systematic meta- analysis 
(Hsu, Santesso et al. 2012)  supports the conclusion that early treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors 
such as oseltamivir  is associated with reduced mortality and reduced rates of hospital admission. Another 
independent meta-analysis of 11 randomized clinical trials also found that oseltamivir reduced the risk of 
lower respirato ry tract complications and the use of antibiotics ( Hernan and Lipsitch 2011 ). Mortality 
benefits were supported by a meta-analysis of hospitalized patients with H1N1 pandemic influenza, 
although the benefit was not  seen in children (Muthuri, Venkatesan et al. 2014 ). This is in contrast to 
2 Cochran reviews, one reviewing both oseltamivir  and zanamivir ( Jefferson, Jones et al. 2009 ) and a 
more recent review focused on oseltamivir  (Jefferson, Jones et al. 2014) , that found only modest efficacy 
as measured by time to alleviation of symptoms and no reduction in lower respiratory tract complications. 
The 2014 review indicated that while there was modest efficacy in healthy adults and children, children with asthma did not benefit. There was no change in the hospital admission rate for adults and insufficient 
data in children. While oseltamivir  did appear to reduce the incidence of unverified pneumonia in adults, 
there was no decrease in the incidence for children. The review also asserted that there was no decrease in 
the common complications of influenza such as bronchitis, otitis media and sinusitis.  
The CDC responded (CDC 2014 ) by reiterating their recommendation of the use of antiviral treatment of 
patients with influenza in certain popu lations.  
The CDC recommendation is as follows:  
Antiviral treatment is recommended as early as possible for any patient with confirmed or 
suspected influenza who is hospitalized; has severe, complicated, or progressive illness; or is at higher risk for influenza complications. Persons at higher risk for influenza complications 
recommended for antiviral treatment include: children aged younger than 2 years; adults aged 65 years and older; persons with chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (except hypertension alone), renal, hepatic, hematological (including sickle cell disease), metabolic 
disorders (including diabetes mellitus), or neurologic and neurodevelopment conditions 
(including disorders of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and muscle such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy [seizure disorders], stroke, intellectual disability [mental retardation], moderate to severe 
developmental delay, muscular dystrophy, or spinal cord injury); persons with 
immunosuppression, including that caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; women who are pregnant or postpartum (within 2 weeks after delivery); persons 
aged younger than 19 years who are receiving long- term aspirin therapy; American 
Indians/Alaska Natives; persons who are morbidly obese (i.e., body-mass index is equal to or 
greater than 40); and residents of nursing homes and other chronic- care facilities.  
It is apparent that the definitions of high risk in this context is empirical, and subject to further modifica tions as additional risk factors are identified in seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks.  
There remains a significant unmet need for influenza therapies for patients who are specifically at an 
increased risk of complications. Peramivir has demonstrated  efficacy and safety when used in acute 
uncomplicated influenza in adults in the general population. This study aims to develop additional data on the safety, pharmacokinetics and effectiveness of IV peramivir in patient groups that are at risk of 
complications from influenza. In particular, this study will target elderly  adults ( ≥ 65 years of age) as well 
as other groups at increased risk of complications ( e.g., pregnant women, residents of long term care 
facilities, American Indians and Alaskan Natives) and adults with comorbidities that increase the risk of

1 It is expected that the date of Screening, Baseline, and Day 1 (date of study drug administration) will be the same.   Day 1 consists of pre and 
post- dose assessments.  
2 Vital sign measures will include blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiration rate. Vital signs will be recorded once during Screening, and vital 
signs will be taken once on remaining study visit days.  
3 The investigator will record oral body temperature at Screening. Thereafter, the subject or care giver will record oral body temperature 
approximately every 12  hours in the Subject Diary until temperature normalizes for 48 hours (i.e. temperature without a ntipyretic is < 
37.4oC/ 99.4oF orally for 4 measurements).  
4 Clinical laboratory assessments performed at Screening are for the purpose of establishing a baseline. Subjects may be enroll ed and begin 
treatment with study drug prior to receiving results.   These labs may be done at any visit if necessary  for patient management or adverse event 
monitoring purposes. 
5. Influenza signs and symptoms will be recorded by the study personnel at Screening, then  by the subject or care giver  twice daily beginning on 
Day 1 through Day 13, and prior to the subject’s clinic visit on Day 14 or until each symptom is 0 or 1 for 48 hours. 
6 Perform a targeted physical exam on Day 3 and Day 7  
7  If an influenza related complication ( IRC) is suspected the subject will be instructed  to return to the clinic as appropriate  to confirm the 
presence or absence of IRCs . 
8    A single serum specimen will be collected, where possible, pre-dose on Day 1, Day 3  and on Day 7 for analysis of influenza antibody titers. 
9    Adverse events are to be collected from the time of informed consent through the follow-up period ending on Day 14.

 26 8. SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS 
Subjects must meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria to be eligible to 
participate in the study. 
8.1. Subject Inclusion Criteria 
1. Male and female subjects age ≥ 18 years. 
2. The subject must meet one of the following two criteria: 
a. A positive influenza Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) and/or a FDA-approved PCR test and at 
least one clinical sign or symptom consistent with acute influenza infection as listed in 2b 
below. 
OR 
b. Clinical signs and symptoms consistent with acute influenza infection consisting of an oral 
temperature ≥ 100°F (37.8°C) with at least one respiratory symptom of at least moderate 
severity (cough or rhinitis) and at least one constitutional symptom of at least moderate 
severity (myalgia [aches and pains], headache, feverishness, or fatigue). Note: Enrollment 
at each site by clinical symptoms alon e will be approved by the Sponsor at the 
beginning of each influenza season once influenza has been confirmed in the local 
community. The Sponsor may withdraw a pproval for symptomatic screening in any 
season based upon trends in influenza surveillance data. Prior to Sponsor approval or after approval is withdrawn, Criteria 2 must be met by a positive influenza RAT test 
and/or PCR. During the period of approval, clinical symptoms alone will be adequate 
to meet Criteria 2.  
3. Onset of symptoms no more than 48 hours before presentation for screening. However, due to 
historically delayed presentation for medical care in the adult population, approximately 20% of 
the elderly population may be enrolled with symptoms starting > 48-hours but ≤ 72-hours prior to 
presentation for screening. Note: Time of onset of  illness is defined as either (1) the time when 
the temperature (either oral or rectal) was first measured as elevated (at least one ºC of elevated 
temperature), OR (2) the time when the subj ect experienced the presence of at least one 
respiratory symptom AND the presence of at least one constitutional symptom together. 
4. Either age ≥  65 years AND/ OR presence of one of the following risk factors: 
a. Pregnancy, including women who are up to 2 weeks postpartum 
b. Resident of a nursing home or long-term care facility  
c. History of chronic lung disease including obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), persistent asthma or cystic fibrosis 
d. History of heart disease including myocardial infarction, angina requiring treatment, 
congestive heart failure requiring treatment, a rrhythmia including atrial fibrillation and 
valvular dysfunction 
e. History of blood dyscracias including sickle cell anemia and thalassemia 
f. History of renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] < 50 mL/min as determined by the Cockcroft-Gault formula) ( Cockcroft and Gault 1976 ), including dialysis.

8.2. Subject Exclusion Criteria 
1. Subjects who in the opinion of the investigator require hospital admission to treat medical condition(s) which, in the Investigator’s opini on, could represent complications of influenza. 
Note, hospitalization is not an exclusion crit erion when it is the usual practice of the 
treating institution to hospita lize elderly patients with acute uncomplicated influenza.  
2. Women who plan to breast-feed for the first 48 ho urs after study drug administration.  However, 
women who suspend breast feeding for 48 hours after study administration may participate.

 28 8.3. Withdrawal Criteria  
Participation in the study is strictly voluntary.  Subjects  have the right to withdraw  from the study at any 
time and for any reason.  A sub ject’s particip ation will be terminated:  
 At the subject’s request  •
 If, in the Investigator’s or Sponsor’s opinion, continuation in the study would be detrimental •
to the subject’s well -being 
 If the subject is not able to comply with the study requirements •
 If the Sponsor terminates the study  •
 If a regulatory authority requires that all study activities be halted  •
In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the subject’s medical records (source 
documents). If the reason for subject withdrawal is not known, the subject must be followed to establish whether the reason was an AE, and if so, this must be reported in accordance with the procedures outlined 
in Section  
11.1.2 . Vigorous attempts should be made for follow-up of all subjects who miss a study visit.  
In general, subjects will be encouraged to complete the scheduled procedures. The subject will require an 
Early  Withdrawal  Visit if withdrawn from the study prior to scheduled study completion.  
To the extent  possible, all scheduled end-of-study assessments (including the Early Withdrawal Visit ) 
should be performed on all participating subjects who withdraw from the study before the Day 14 Visit.  
Subjects withdrawn from the study at any time other than during the screening period will not be 
replaced.

 29 9. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS  
9.1. Study Drug Dose Rationale  
Subjects will be dosed with peramivir at the dosage levels currently approved in the US package insert for 
peramivir. The standard dose will be a single IV dose of 600 mg  for subjects with CrCL ≥  50 ml/min and 
reduced for subjects with CrCL < 50 ml/min as described in Section  9.4.  
9.2. Study Drug  
Peramivir solution for infusion is a clear, iso -osmotic, sterile, nonpyrogenic solution in 200 mg per 20 mL 
(10 mg/mL) single -use glass vials fitted with rubber stoppers and aluminum flip- off seals.  The drug 
product should be stored at room temperature (excursion permitted to 59° to 86°F).  
9.3. Study Drug  Preparation and Administration  
The Principal Investigator at each study center will designate a pharmacist (or other qualified study staff 
member) to prepare  IV peramivir . 
Subjects will receive a single dose of 600  mg peramivir (or less if renally impaired) diluted in 0.9% 
saline, 0.45% saline, 5% dextrose or lactated Ringer’s using the technique described in a separate drug 
preparation instruction sheet, administered IV  over a period of 15 to 30 minutes. The calendar date and 
24-hour clock time (start and end of the IV infusion) will be recorded.  
The intravenous line used to administer peramivir  must be flushed prior to and after peramivir 
administration.  No other medications should be administered through the same IV line during peramivir 
administration. 
9.4. Dose Adjustments for Subjects with Renal I mpairment  
Table 2 provides dose adjustments based on creatinine clearance for subjects with renal impairment. In 
subjects with chronic renal impairment maintained on hemodialysis, peramivir should be administered 
after dialysis at a dose adjusted based on renal function as shown in the table below.  
Table 2. Dosage Adjustment for Subjects with Altered Creatinine Clearance  
 Creatinine Clearance (mL/min)a 
 ≥ 50 30 to 49 10 to 29 
Recommended Dose (mg)  600 mg 200 mg 100 mg 
a Calculated using the Cockroft -Gault equation.  
9.5. Study medication accountability  
The Investigator/pharmacist must maintain accurate records of the disposition of all study drug received 
from the Sponsor and administered to the subject (including date and time), and any drug accidentally destroyed. The Sponsor will supply a specific Drug Accountability Form. At the end of the study, 
information describing study drug supplies ( e.g., lot numbers) and disposition of supplies for each subject 
must be provided, signed by the Investigator or designee, and collected by the Study Monitor. If any 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-306 
 30 errors or irregularities in any shipment of study medication to the site are discovered at any time, the 
Sponsor Project Mana ger must be contacted immediately.  
Periodically during the trial and a t the end of the study, all medication that was neither dispensed or 
administered, as well as packaging materials will be collected with supervision of the monitor and returned to the Sponsor or destroyed on site as dictated by the appropriate Standard Operating Procedure 
(SOP) at the participating site  
9.6. Randomization and Blinding/ Masking  
As this is a single-arm, open-label study, randomization and blinding are not applicable. 
9.7. Treatment C ompliance  
Intravenous peramivir will be administered by study staff or other qualified personnel . Details of the 
infusion  (to include date of dose, start time, and stop time) will be reco rded by a member of the study 
staff on Day 1; treatment compliance is expected to be 100% for this study. 
9.8. Overdose and Toxicity Management 
To date there is no experience with overdose of IV peramivir.  If overdose occurs, subjects should receive 
indicated supportive therapy and evaluation of hematologic and clinical chemistry laboratory tests should 
be conducted. Peramivir is cleared by hemodialysis; the decision to use hemodialysis should be addressed 
on a case-by- case basis with the Sponsor. 
9.9. Concomitant Medications 
With the exception of medications used for the symptomatic treatment of influenza -related symptoms, 
administration of any dose of a concomitant medication during the study period must be recorded by the 
study staff within the subject’s study source documents ( e.g., chart). This includes prescription 
medications as well as over -the-counter medications. 
Medications, such as antipyretics and analgesics, used for the symptomatic treatment of influenza- related 
symptoms will be recorded separately. Subjects will record the type, date, and time of symptomatic 
medications in the subject diary supplied by BioCryst including the date and time of administration. 
Study staff will provide diary completion instructions to subjects during their first study visit.  
Use of concomitant medications will be assessed and recorded at Screening , and daily throughout the 
duration of the study through the study completion visit at Day 14 or later. 
9.9.1.  Antipyretics and Analgesics  
Resolution of fever is an important efficacy endpoint for this study. Accordingly, use of any antipyretics 
or analgesics with antipyretic properties mu st be carefully controlled and documented. Antipyretics and 
analgesics may be administered while the subject is enrolled in this study. The names and times of administration of these medications will be recorded by the subject/caregiver in the s ubject diary. To 
avoid the confounding effects of antipyretic medications, temperature measurements recorded by the 
subjects will be taken, whenever possible, at least 4  hours after administration of the antipyretic 
medication. 
Continuation of low dose aspirin for ca rdioprophylaxis is allowed. 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-306 
 31 9.9.2.  Medications for Chronic Diseases/Conditions  
Subjects with chronic medical conditions may continue to receive prescribed treatments during 
participation in this protocol. For example, treatment for cardiovascular conditions, endocrine conditions, rheumatologic conditions, respiratory conditions, dermatologic conditions, and neurologic conditions may 
be continued if not otherwise contraindicated within this protocol . 
9.9.3.  Antivirals  
Subjects must not have received any doses of oseltamiv ir, zanamivir, amantadine, or rimantadine in the 
7 days prior to study drug administration. Concomitant use of oseltamivir, zanamivir, amantadine, and/or 
rimantadine is not permitted during administration of study drug and during the post -treatment  follow-up 
period. Antivirals for other infections such as HIV or herpes simplex may be taken. 
9.9.4.  Antibiotics  
Oral or parenteral antibiotics may be administered at any time after enrollment if medically indicated. If 
such use is a result of proven or suspecte d influenza- related complication, the appropriate assessments 
should be carried out (see Section  10.2.4) . 
9.9.5.  Immunizations  
Subjects must not have received a live attenuated  influenza vaccine in the 14 days  prior to study drug 
administration .  Immunizations of any kind should not be administered during study participation. 
Subjects who are candidates for pneumococcal immunization or other immunization should not receive 
such immunizations during the study period.

 32 10. STUDY CONDUCT  
10.1. Overview  
Approximately 120 subjects will be enrolled in this open-label study (a minimum of 80 elderly subjects 
[≥ 65 years ] will be enrolled) . A subject’s duration of participation in this study is expected to be 14 days 
and will include up to 4 clinic visits. It is expected that most subjects will have the Screening v isit and the 
Day 1 Treatment visit on the same day. Subjects will be discharged  from this study on Day 14. 
Additional, unscheduled visits may be required for subjects who report symptoms of influenza of 
moderate or severe intensity at Day  14 or have persistent adverse events and/or treatment -emergent 
laboratory findings that require medical monitoring or management. 
All subjects will receive a single dose of IV peramivir (600 mg  or reduced for renal impairment). Subjects 
will undergo follow -up clinical assessments on Days 3, 7, and 14.  
An adequate nasal swab specimen will be collected from all enrolled subjects at Baseline (pre-dose) for 
virus subtype identification and quantitative virologic assessments and at the follow -up assessments on 
study Days 3, 7 and 14.  
Specimens from all subjects yielding influenza virus will also b e assessed for susceptibility to 
neuraminidase inhibitors (Day 1 and last specimen yielding influenza virus on culture). A central 
laboratory will perform all virologic assessments.  
Up to 3 blood samples will be drawn to obtain plasma samples for drug concentration determinations, 
where possible, during the following time periods, beginning from the end of dosing until release from 
the site:  
 One time point immediately following completion of the infusion •
 One time point from 30 minutes to 1 hour post-infusion •
 One time point from 1 hour to 3 hours post-infusion  •
Adverse events and concomitant medications will be monitored at each scheduled visit  from the 
Screening assessment to final study visit. Clinical laboratory investigations (chemistries, hem atology, and 
urinalysis) will be collected at Baseline, Day  7 and Day 14 visits. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated 
through assessments of AEs, laboratory analyses (clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), vital 
signs and physical examinations at the time points indicated in the schedule of assessments.  
All subjects/caregivers will record the following information in a Subject Diary:  
 Assessment of the presence and severity of each of 7  symptoms of influenza on a 4-point •
severity scale (0, abs ent; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe) at Screening, then twice daily 
through Day 13, and prior to the subject’s clinic visit on Day 14 or until  each symptom is 0 or 
1 for 48 hours.  Symptoms will be reviewed at each clinic visit.  
 Temperature measurements (oral) will be taken with an electronic thermometer provided by •
the Sponsor, approximately every 12  hours until temperature normalizes for 48 hours (i.e. 
temperature without antipyretic is <  37.4°C/ 99.4°F orally for 4  measurements).  With the 
exception of the Screening/ Baseline measurement, all temperature measurements will be 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

 33 obtained at least 4  hours after, or immediately before, administration of oral acetaminophen 
or other antipyretic medications, if taken.  
 The type, date, and tim e of medications used for the symptomatic treatment of influenza- •
related symptoms.  
 Assessment of the subject’s ability to perform usual activities using a 0 to 10 visual analogue •
scale once daily through Day 14, where 0 = Unable to perform usual activities  at all, and 
10 = Able to perform all usual activities fully.

The Screening Period begins at the time of consent of the study subject. The Investigator will conduct the 
following assessments: 
 Review of inclusion and exclusion criteria  •
 Revi ew and record medical history and concomitant medications  •
 Conduct an a ssessment for IRC; if an IRC is suspected, then the physical examination will •
confirm the actual presence/absence of the IRC. If an IRC is present, the subject meets 
exclusion criteria 6  and is  ineligible for the study. 
 Measure oral body temperature  •
 Conduct a RAT or Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )-approved PCR test for influenza A •
and B on an adequate nasal specimen, in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The subject must have a positive RAT result and/or a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
approved PCR test and at least one clinical sign or symptom consistent with influenza (see 2b below). 
OR have  clinical signs and symptoms consistent with acute influenza infection consisting of 
an oral temperature ≥ 100°F (37.8°C) with at least one respiratory symptom of at least 
moderate severity (cough or rhinitis) and at least one constitutional symptom of at least moderate severity (myalgia [aches and pains], headache, feverishn ess, or fatigue)  (See 
Section 8.1 ). Note: Enro llment at each site by clinical symptoms alone will be approved 
by the Sponsor at the beginning of ea ch influenza season once influenza has been 
confirmed in the local community. The Sponsor may withdraw approval for 
symptomatic screening in any season based upon trends in influenza surveillance data. 
Prior to Sponsor approval or after approval is withdrawn, Criteria 2 must be met by a 
positive influenza RAT test  and/or PCR . During the period of approval, clinical 
symptoms alone will be adequate to meet Criteria 2.  
The subject must have at least 1 respiratory symptom (cough, sore throat or nasal symptoms) of at least moderate severity, in addition to at least 1 constitutional symptom (myalgia, 
headache, feverishness, or fatigue) of at least moderate severity to be eligible for the study

Effectiveness will be evaluated through assessments of body temperature, clinical symptoms of influenza, 
usual daily activities  assessments, incidence of influenza -related complications (see Section  10.2.4) for 
details) , influenza virus titers, and changes in viral sensitivity to other antiviral drugs.  
10.2.1.  Body Temperature 
The Investigator will record oral body temperature at Screening. The baseline temperature will be 
recorded at the Day  1 visit prior to dosing, regardless of whether the subject had recently taken an 
antipyretic. Thereafter, the subject or caregiver will record oral body temperatures approximately every 
12 hours through Day 14 in the subject diary. Subjects or caregivers will measure their oral temperature 
with an electronic thermometer (provided by the Sponsor for the study). With the exception of the 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-306 
 37 baseline measurement, subjects will be instructed to take all temperature measurements at least 4  hours 
after, or immediately before, administration of oral acetaminophen or other antipyretic medications. The 
times of each temperature determination will be recorded in the Subject Diary.  
10.2.2.  Influenza Signs and Symptoms  
Subjects  will be asked to provide an assessment of 7 influenza symptom s (cough, sore throat, nasal 
congestion, myalgia [aches and pains], headache, feverishness, and fatigue) on a 4 -point severity scale ( 0, 
absent; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe) beginning at Screening then twice daily beginning on Day 1 through Day 13, and prior to the subject’s clinic visit on Day 14. Once all symptoms are score a 0 or 1 for 
at least 48  hours the can discontinue recordings. The definitions to be used to assign severity are as 
follows: 
0, Absent  no symptom present (no cough, no sore throat, etc.) 
1, Mild symptom present and slightly uncomfortable 
2, Moderate symptom is very uncomfortable 
3, Severe symptom is intolerable  
The subject diary will be reviewed by study staff at each visit for completion of the record of all required items, with particular emphasis on alleviation of clinical symptoms as well as relapse of symptoms. Study 
staff will not attempt to as k subjects or caregiver to retrospectively complete missing subject diary data 
for any scheduled assessments that have not been completed prior to the clinic visit. However, study staff 
should, however, remind the subject or caregiver to complete the subje ct diary at all scheduled times.  
10.2.3.  Assessment of ability to perform usual daily activities  
If possible, s ubjects /caregivers will be asked to provide a daily assessment of the subject’s ability to 
perform usual daily activities using a 0  to 10 visual analogue scale, where 0  = Unable to perform usual 
activities at all, and 10  = Able to perform usual activities fully. The subject will also assess his/her time 
lost from work, if applicable. The subject/care giver will be asked to record these assessments in the 
subject diary  once daily from Baseline through Day  13 and prior to the subject’s clinic visit on Day 14. 
10.2.4.  Influenza -Related Complicat ions 
Study personnel will evaluate the subject at Screening and Days 3, 7, and 14 for the presence of clinical 
signs and/or symptoms of the following IRC :  
 Sinusitis  •
 Otitis media  •
 Bronchitis •
 Pneumonia  •
Note that subjects with clinical signs and/or symptoms consi stent with bacterial infections, 
including:  otitis media, bronchitis, sinusitis, and/or pneumonia at screening are not eligible for 
enrollment in this study (see exclusion criteria in Section  8.2). 
If an IRC is suspected , then a targeted physical examination will be conducted to confirm the presence or 
absence of the IRC. If the Investigator determines that the subject experiences (or is presumed to 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-306 
 38 experience) an IRC as noted above, he/she will record that assessment and any medication used to treat 
the condition in the source record and  record  the IRC and medications in the case report form (CRF). The 
Investigator will promptly provide appropriate treatment for any suspected or proven IRC. Such information describing IRC signs and/or symptoms should not be reported as AEs . Any reactions at the 
site of the IV drug administration will be recorded as an AE . 
10.2.5.  Hospital Admission  
In the event that a subject  requires admission to a hospital at any time during the study additional 
information on the hospital admission will be collected. See Section 11.1.5 for serious adverse event 
(SAE ) reporting details. 
10.3. Virology Samples 
Bilateral mid -nasal swab specimens will be collected for virologic analysis. Samples will be collected at 
Baseline, Day 3, Day 7 , and Day 14 . 
Virology laboratory tests will include viral sub type characterization from the baseline sample, laboratory 
culture and analysis by log
10 TCID 50, RT-PCR assay,  viral susceptibility to peramivir, oseltamivir, and  
zanamivir, and genotypic ana lysis of primary virus isolates.  
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-306 
 39 11. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
Safety will be evaluated through assessments of AEs, pregnancy outcomes, laboratory analyses (clinical 
chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), vital signs, and physical examinations. 
Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be assessed and recorded at the indica ted time points (see schedule of assessments,  
Table 1). AEs will be recorded on Screening , Day 1, D ay 3,  Day 7 and Day 14/Early Withdraw visits. 
Adverse events will be graded through use of the Division of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome 
(DAIDS ) Tables for Grading Adult and Pediatric Adverse Experiences (see Appendix 16.2 ). Any Grade 3 
and Grade 4 clinica l AEs or laboratory abnormalities  that are judged to be possibly, probably, or 
definitely related to study treatment will be promptly (within 72  hours) reported to the study medical 
monitor unless the event meets criteria for an SAE, in which case they must be reported within 24 hours . 
Influenza- related complications are not considered AEs unless they meet the criteria for SAEs. Full 
details on recording and reporting AEs are provided in Section 11.1.2 . 
11.1.1.  Definitions  
11.1.1.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject. No causal relationship with the 
study drug or with the clinical study itself is implied. An AE may be an unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, syndrome, or illness that develops or worsens during the clinical study. Clinically relevant 
abnormal results of diagnostic procedures including abnormal laboratory findings (e.g. , requiring 
unscheduled diagnostic procedures or treatment measures, or resulting in withdrawal from the study) are 
considered to be AEs. 
Surgical procedures are not AEs but may constitute therapeutic measures for conditions t hat require 
surgery. The condition for which the surgery is required is an AE, if it occurs or is detected during the 
study period. Planned surgical measures permitted by the clinical study protocol and the conditions(s) 
leading to these measures are not A Es, if the condition(s) was (were) known before the start of study 
treatment. In the latter case the condition should be reported as medical history. 
Assessment of influenza symptoms will be documented and analyzed as a measure of effectiveness of the 
study treatment. These symptoms will not be reported as AEs unless the symptom(s) worsen to the extent 
that the outcome fulfills the definition of an SAE, which then must be recorded as such. 
AEs are designated as “ non-serious” or “serious.” 
11.1.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is an adverse event that results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death  •
 Is life -threatening (subject is at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not •
refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
 Requires in -subject hospitalization (formal admission to a hospital for medical reasons) or •
prolongation of existing hospitalization 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL BCX1812-306 
 40 • Results in persistent or significant disability/in capacity (i.e., there is a substantial disruption 
of a person’s ability to carry out normal life functions) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life-threatening, or do not require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in subject 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Hospitalization, as per the institution’s standard of care (SOC) to treat influenza in elderly patients is not considered an SAE and should not be reported as such. Any adverse event that causes a prolongation of an existing hospitalization must be reported as per Section 11.1.5 . 
11.1.2.  Method, Frequency, and Time Period for Detecting Adverse Events and Reporting 
Serious Adverse Events 
Reports of AEs are to be collected from the time th e subject signs the informed consent through the 
follow-up period ending on Day 14. The Investigator or  designee must completely and promptly record 
each AE. The Investigator should attempt, if possible, to establish a diagnosis based on the presenting 
signs and symptoms. In such cases, the diagnosis sh ould be documented as the AE and not the individual 
sign/symptom. If a clear diagnosis cannot be estab lished, each sign and symptom must be recorded 
individually. If a final diagnosis is established durin g evaluation or treatment, the source documents will 
be updated accordingly. 
The Investigator should attempt to follow all unresolved AEs and/or SAEs observed during the study until 
they are resolved, or are judged medically stable, or are otherwise medically explained. 
11.1.3.  Definition of Severity 
All AEs will be assessed (graded) for severity and classified using the DAIDS criteria for grading AEs 
(see Section 
16.2 ). Any adverse events not covered by the DAIDS criteria will be assessed and classified 
into one of 4 clearly defined categories as follows: 
Mild: (Grade 1): Transient or mild symptoms; no limitation in activity; no intervention 
required. The AE does not interfere with the participant’s normal functioning level. It may be an annoyance. 
Moderate: (Grade 2): Symptom results in mild to  moderate limitation in activity; no or 
minimal intervention required. The AE produces some impairment of 
functioning, but it is not hazardous to health. It is uncomfortable or an 
embarrassment. 
Severe: (Grade 3): Symptom results in significant limitation in activity; medical 
intervention may be required. The AE produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation. 
Life threatening (Grade 4): Symptoms causing inability to perform basic self-care functions OR Medical or operative intervention indica ted to prevent permanent impairment, 
persistent disability, or death 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL BCX1812-306 
 41 11.1.4.  Definition of Relationship to Study Drug 
The Principal Investigator or medically qualified designee must review each AE and make the 
determination of relationship to stud y drug using the following guidelines: 
Not Related: The event can be readily explained by  other factors such as the subject’s 
underlying medical condition, concomitant therapy, or accident, and no temporal 
relationship exists between the study drug and the event. 
Unlikely: The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from drug 
administration and is readily explained by the subject’s clinical state or by other modes of therapy administered to the subject. 
Possibly Related: There is some temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the study drug and the event is unlikely to be explained by the subject’s medical condition, other therapies, or accident. 
Probably Related: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from drug administration, abates upon discontinuation of the drug, a nd cannot be reasonably explained by 
the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state. 
Definitely Related: The event follows a reasonable temporal  sequence from administration of the 
medication, follows a known or suspected response pattern to the medication, is 
confirmed by improvement upon stopping  the medication (dechallenge), and 
reappears upon repeated exposure (recha llenge, if rechallenge is medically 
appropriate). 
11.1.5.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
Any SAE must be reported by phone or email to the Sponsor medical monitor and in writing via email or 
fax using the SAE report form within 24 hours of the Investigator’s awareness of the SAE. In addition, all 
SAEs must be recorded on the AE case report form (CRF) in real time. 
All additional follow-up evaluations of the SAE must be reported to BioCryst or its designee as soon as 
they are available.  
The SAE report forms should be sent to the following email addresses or fax numbers: 
Email: safety@biocryst.com and drugsafety@prosarcorp.com 
OR 
Fax: +1 919 226-5888 and +1 866-681-1063 
Immediate reporting should allow BioCryst to take the appropriate measures to address potential new 
risks in a clinical trial. Therefore, the initial report should be submitted by the Investigator within a very 
short period of time and under no circumstances should this period ex ceed 24 hours following awareness 
of the SAE.  
The follow-up report should allow BioCryst to dete rmine whether the SAE requires a reassessment of the 
benefit-risk profile of the study drug in clinical trial,  if the relevant information was not already available 
and provided in the initial report. Any SAEs considered possibly, proba bly or definitely related to tr eatment and not in accordance with 
information in the Investigator’s Brochure will be reported to the FDA and other Regulatory Competent 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL BCX1812-306 
 42 Authorities as applicable via the MedWatch/CIOMS re porting system in accordance with FDA and other 
applicable regulations. 
The Principal Investigator or designee at each site is responsible for submitting the Investigational New 
Drug (IND) safety report (initial and follow-up) or other safety information (e.g., revised Investigator’s 
Brochure) to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)  and for retaining a copy in their files. 
11.1.6.  Pregnancy 
Any pregnancy in an enrolled subject or discovered in  a subject during the course of the trial must be 
reported to BioCryst or designee on the Pregnancy Notif ication Form (to be supplied by BioCryst) in the 
same manner as SAEs (see Section 11.1.5 ). All pregnancies will be followed to an outcome (i.e., 
miscarriage, elective termination, stillbirth, live birth), and the outcome needs to be reported on the 
Pregnancy Outcome Form (to be supplied by BioC ryst). Pregnancy outcomes of miscarriage, elective 
termination, stillbirth or birth defects will be  considered SAEs and should be reported as per 
Section  11.1.5 . 
11.1.7.  Reporting DAIDS Grade 3 or 4 events 
Any DAIDS Grade 3 and Grade 4 clinical AE or laboratory abnormality that is judged to be possibly, 
probably, or definitely related to  study treatment but does not meet seriousness criteria will be promptly 
(within 72 hours) reported to the study me dical monitor via telephone or email. 
11.2. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
11.2.1.  Clinical Chemistry Profiles 
Clinical chemistry profiles will include a Chemistry 20 panel (includes sodium, potassium, chloride, total 
CO 2 [bicarbonate], creatinine, glucose, urea nitr ogen, albumin, total calcium, total magnesium, 
phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotrans ferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total protein, total creatine kinase, and uric 
acid).    
Blood samples for clinical chemistry profiles will be collected at Screening and at Day 7 or early 
termination visit (if the early termination visit occurs  prior to Day 7). Clinically significant results should 
be reported as AEs.  If Day 7 clinical chemistry pr ofiles are, in the opinion of the investigator, 
significantly abnormal or significantly changed from base line at Day 7, they should be repeated at the 
Day 14 visit. 
At screening, creatinine clearance will be calculated by the Cockroft-Gault equation (using actual body 
weight and serum creatinine) (see Appendix 16.1). 
11.2.2.  Hematology Profiles 
Hematology profiles will include complete blood count (CBC) with differential. Blood samples for 
hematology profiles will be collected at Baseline and at Day 7 or early termination visit (if the early 
termination visit occurs prior to Day 7).  If Day 7 hematology profiles are, in the opinion of the 
investigator, significantly abnormal or significantly changed at Day 7, repeat at the Day 14 visit. 
Clinically significant results should be reported as AEs.  
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL BCX1812-306 
 43 11.2.3.  Urinalysis 
Urinalysis will include tests for protein, glucose, ketones, blood, urobilinogen,  nitrite, pH, and specific 
gravity and microscopic evaluation (if initial assessme nt is abnormal) for red blood cells (RBCs) and 
white blood cells (WBCs).  
Urine samples for urinalysis will be collected at Screen ing, Day 7 and/or at early termination visit (if the 
early termination visit occurs prior to Day 7). If a urin alysis result for any analyte is, in the opinion of the 
investigator, significantly abnormal and/or unexplain ed, repeat testing may be obtained at periodic 
intervals as deemed appropriate by the Investigator, and should be repeated during the Day 14 visit. 
Clinically significant results should be reported as AEs.  
11.2.4.  Pregnancy Test (Urine or Serum) 
Females of childbearing potential will be evaluated fo r pregnancy at Screening and at the Day 14 or early 
termination visit (if the early termination visit occurs prior to Day 14) assessment using a urine pregnancy 
test performed locally unless they are already preg nant. If local regulatory guidelines require a serum 
pregnancy test, then this modality should be complete d in addition to the urine test to complete the 
pregnancy test. 
11.3. Vital Signs 
Vital sign measurements (blood pressure , heart rate, respiration rate) will be recorded once at Screening 
and once at each study visit on Days 3, 7,  14 and/or early termination visit. 
11.4. Physical Examination  
The Investigator will perform a full physical examinati on at Screening, including the subject’s height and 
weight, and a targeted physical examination on Day 3 and Day 7 and/or early termination. Examination of 
the breast and urogenital system may be omitted as per th e institution’s/investigator’s clinical routine. At 
each follow-up visit, study personnel will evaluate the subject for the presence of clinical signs and/or 
symptoms of influenza-related complications (see Section 10.2.4 ). If an IRC is suspected, a targeted 
physical exam should be conducted to confirm the absence or presence of the IRC.

 45 13. STATISTICS  
Descriptive statistical methods will be used to summarize the data from this study.  Unless stated 
otherwise, the term “descriptive statistics” refers to number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation 
(SD), minimum, and maximum for continuous data and frequencies and percentages for categorical data. 
All statistical analyses will be conducted with the SAS® System, version  9.1.3 or higher.  
13.1. Data Collection Methods 
The data  will be transcribed from the subjects’ source documents into the Case Report Form ( CRF ) 
approved by BioCryst. The data collection methods may be either a paper CRF or an electronic CRF , at 
BioCryst’s discretion. All documentation supporting the CRF data, such as laboratory or hospital records  
must be readily available to verify entries in the CRF.  
To ensure subject confidentiality, any d ocuments (including laboratory reports, hospital records 
subsequent to SAEs, etc.) transmitted to BioCryst should not carry the subject’s name.  
13.2. Statistical Analysis Plans  
A statistical analysis plan ( SAP) will be created and approved prior to the review of any data. This 
document will provide a more technical and detailed description of the proposed data analysis methods 
and procedures. 
13.3. Study Hypothesis  
There are no hypotheses to be formally tested in this study. 
13.4. Sample Size Estimates  
The study is designed to evaluate the safety , PK, and effectiveness of IV administration of peramivir in 
subjects ≥ 65 years of age with influenza infection and in subjects with influenza infection who are at an 
increased risk of influenza complications . The sample size is not based on statistical considerations, rather 
a sample size of up to 120  subjects is considered adequate to evaluate the stated objectives.  
13.5. Analysis Populations  
The populations defined for analysis will include the intent- to-treat (ITT) population, intent- to-treat 
infected (ITTI) population, safety population, and an exposure-response population. Additional analysis 
populations may be defined to evaluate study results. Any additional analysis populations will be defined 
in the SAP.  
 Intent -To-Treat Population:  The ITT population will include all subjects who are •
randomized. The ITT population will be used for analyses of accountability and 
demographics.  
 Intent -To-Treat Infected Population:  The ITTI population will include all subjects who are •
enrolled, treated, and have influenza confirmed by PCR. The ITTI population will be used for analyses of effectiveness. 
 Safety Population:  The safety population will include all subjects who received any amount •
of study drug. This population will be used for all safety analyses.  
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-306 
 46  Exposure -Response Population:  The exposure -response population will include all subjects •
in the ITTI po pulation who have a quantifiable plasma concentration of peramivir and at least 
1 post- baseline effectiveness assessment. This population will be used for all exposure-
response analyses.  
13.6. End of Study Analysis  
A final analysis is planned  to occur after the last subject completes or discontinues the study, and the 
resulting clinical database has been cleaned, quality checked, and locked.  
13.7. General Issues for Statistical Analysis  
13.7.1.  Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity  
No adjustments are currently planned.  
13.7.2.  Covaria tes 
Not applicable.  
13.7.3.  Planned Subgroups  
Analyses will be displayed  by age group ( ≥ 65 years vs < 65 years) and viral subtype at Screening . 
Additional subgroups based on risk of complication may be evaluated. Subgroups will be defined in the 
SAP.  
13.7.4.  Missing Data  
Every effort will be made to obtain required data at each scheduled visit from  all subjects who have been 
enrolled . In situations where it is not possible to obtain all data, it may be necessary to impute missing 
data. In assessing the time to event endpo ints, subjects who withdraw or never achieve 
resolution/alleviation, missing data will be censored using  the date of subject’s last non -missing 
assessment. Additional details on the handling of missing data will be presented in the SAP. 
13.8. Effectiveness  
13.8.1.  Effec tiveness Endpoints  
All effectiveness  endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics overall, and by age  group and 
study day/time, if appropriate. 13.8.2.  Effectiveness Analyses 
Time to resolution of fever, defined as a temperature <  99.4°F oral with  no antipyretic medications taken 
for at least 12 hours, will be estimated overall  and by each age group using the method of Kaplan- Meier. 
Subjects  who do not achieve resolution of fever will be censored at the time of their last assessment.  
Time to resolution of influenza symptoms, defined as the time from initiation of study drug until the start 
of the 21.5-hour period (24 hours - 10%) where all symptoms of influenza are recorded as none or mild, 
will be estimated overall  and for each age grou p using the method of Kaplan-Meier. Subjects who do not 
experience alleviation of symptoms will be censored at the time o f the last non- missing symptom 
assessment.

 47 Reduction in viral shedding will be assessed as the change from baseline in log 10 TCID 50/mL and 
RT-PCR, and will be summarized overall, by age group , and by study visit.  
Changes in virus susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors between virus cultured at Baseline and the last 
post- treatment sample from which virus can be cultured will be assessed using virology laboratory tests. 
Virology laboratory tests will include phenotypic characterizations of influenza virus recovered 
(hemagglutinin  and neuraminidase) and viral susceptibility to peramivir, and genotypic analysis of 
primary virus isolates. These analyses will be presented  overall, and separately by age group and viral 
subtype. 
13.9. Safety Analyses  
Adverse Events  will be mapped to a Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)- preferred 
term and system organ classification.  The occurrence of treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be 
summarized by age group and treatment group using MedDRA- preferred terms, system organ 
classifications, and severity.  All AEs will be listed for individual subjects showing both verbatim and 
preferre d terms.  Separate summaries of treatment -emergent SAEs and AEs related to study drug will be 
generated.  
Descriptive summaries of vital signs and clinical laboratory results will be presented by age group , 
treatment group and study visit. Laboratory abnorma lities will be graded according to the DAIDS Table 
for Grading Adverse Events for Adults and Pediatrics (Publish Date: December 2004 Clarification, 2009, 
see Section  16.2 ). The number and percentage of subjects exper iencing treatment- emergent graded 
toxicities will be summarized overall and by age group. Laboratory toxicity shifts from baseline to 
post- baseline assessments will be summarized overall and by age group. 
Previous and concomitant medications will be mapped to a WHO preferred term and drug classification.  
The number and percent of subjects taking concomitant medications will be summarized using preferred 
terms and drug classifications.  
The number and percent of subjects experiencing influenza related complications will be summarized 
overall and by age group. 
Subject disposition will be presented for all subjects.  The number of subjects who completed the study 
and discontinued from the study will be provided. The reasons for early discontinuation also will be 
presented.

14.1. Regulatory and Ethical Considerations 
14.1.1.  Regulatory Authority Approvals 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol; Good Clinical Practices ( GCPs ), including 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) of Technical Requi rements for Registration of 
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Guidelines; FDA regulatory requirements and in accordance with the 
ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. In  addition, all applicable local laws and regulatory 
requirements relevant to t he use of new therapeutic agents in the countries involved will be adhered to.  
The Investigator should submit written reports of clinical study status to their IRB annually or more 
frequently if requested by the IRB.  A final study notification will also be forwarded to the IRB after the 
study is completed or in the event of premature termination of the study in accordance with the applicable 
regulations. Copies of all contact with the IRB should be maintained in the study documents file. Copies 
of clinical study status reports (including termination) should be provided to BioCryst. 
14.1.2.  Institutional Review Board Approvals 
Before initiation of the study at each investigational site, the protocol, the informed consent and ass ent 
forms, the subject information sheet, and any other relevant study documentation will be submitted to the 
appropriate IRB. Written approval of the study must be obtained before the investigational medicinal 
product is released to the Investigator and t he study site may be opened for enrollment. Any necessary 
extensions or renewals of IRB approval must be obtained, in particular, for changes to the study such as 
modification of the protocol, the informed consent and assent forms, the written information provided to 
subjects/ caregivers and/or other procedures.  
The Investigator will report promptly to the IRB any new information that may adversely affect the safety 
of the subjects or the conduct of the study. On completion of the study, the Investigator wil l provide the 
IRB with a report of the outcome of the study. 
14.1.3.  Subject Informed Consent  
Signed informed consent must be obtained from each subject  prior to performing any study- related 
procedures. The  informed consent process should take place under conditions where the subject  has 
adequate time to consider the risks and benefits associated with his/her participation in the study. Subjects 
will not be screened or treated until the subject  has signed an approved informed consent form ( ICF) 
written in a languag e in which the subject is fluent.  
The ICF that is used must be approved both by BioCryst and by the reviewing IRB. The informed consent 
should be in accordance with the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki, current ICH and GCP 
guidelines, and Bi oCryst policy.  
The Investigator must explain to potential subjects the aims, methods, reasonably anticipated benefits, and 
potential hazards of the trial and any discomfort it may entail. Each subject will be informed that they are 
free not to participate in the trial and that they may withdraw consent to participate at any time.  They will 
be told that refusal to participate in the study will not prejudice future treatment.  They will also be told 
that their records may be examined by competent authorities a nd authorized persons but that personal 
information will be treated as strictly confidential and will not be publicly available.  
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-306 
 49 Subjects must be given the opportunity to ask questions. After this explanation and before entry into the 
trial, consent should  be appropriately recorded by means of the subject ’s dated signature. The subject  
should receive a signed and dated copy of the ICF. The original signed informed consent should be retained in the study files.  The Investigator shall maintain a log of all su bjects for whom consent was 
signed and indicate if the subject was enrolled into the study or reason for non-enrollment. 
14.1.4.  Payment to Subjects  
Reasonable compensation to study subjects may be provided if approved by the IRB responsible for the 
study at the Investigator’s site.  
14.1.5.  Investigator Reporting Requirements  
The Investigator will provide timely reports regarding safety to his/her IRB as required.  
14.2. Study Monitoring  
During trial conduct, BioCryst or its designee will conduct periodic monitoring visits to en sure that the 
protocol and GCPs are being followed. The  monitors may review source documents to confirm that the 
data recorded on CRFs is accurate. The I nvestigator and treating institution, if applicable, will allow 
BioCryst monitors or its designees and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification. 
14.3. Quality Assurance  
The trial site may be subject to review by the IRB, and/or to quality assurance audits performed by 
BioCryst, or designee, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities. 
It is important that the Investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring 
visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.  
14.4. Study Termination and Site Closure  
BioCryst reserves the right to discontinue the trial prior to inclusion of the intended number of subjects but intends only to exercise this right for valid scientific or administrative reasons. After  such a decision, 
the Investigator must contact all participating subjects immediately after notification. As directed by 
BioCryst, all study materials must be collected and all case report forms completed to the greatest extent possible. 
14.5. Records Retention  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or BioCryst, the Investigator agrees to 
keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link records, 
case report forms and hospital records), al l original signed informed consent forms, copies of all case 
report forms and detailed records of treatment disposition. The records should be retained by the 
Investigator according to local regulations or as specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement, whichever is longer. 
If the Investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the study, the study records may be 
transferred to an acceptable designee, such as another Investigator, another institution, or to BioCryst. The  
Investigator must ob tain BioCryst’s written permission before disposing of any records.

Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-306 
 50 14.6. Confidentiality of Information  
BioCryst affirms the subject’s right to protection against invasion of privacy. Only a subject identification 
number, initials and/or date of birth will iden tify subject data retrieved by BioCryst . However , in 
compliance with federal regulations, BioCryst requires the Investigator  to permit BioCryst’s 
representatives and, when necessary, representatives of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to review 
and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study.  
BioCryst will ensure that the use and disclosure of protected health information obtained during a 
research study complies with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPA A) Privacy 
Rule, where this rule is applicable. The  Rule provides federal protection for the privacy of protected 
health information by implementing standards to protect and guard against the misuse of individually 
identifiable health information of subjects p articipating in BioCryst- sponsored Clinical Trials. 
"Authorization" is required from each research subject  (i.e., specified permission granted by an individual 
to a covered entity for the use or disclosure of an individual's protected health information). A valid 
authorization must meet the implementation specifications under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Authorization 
may be combined in the Informed Consent document (approved by the IRB) or it may be a separate 
document, (approved by the IRB) or provided by the Investigator or Sponsor (without IRB approval). It is 
the responsibility of the I nvestigator and treating institution , if applicable,  to obtain such waiver or 
authorization in writing from the appropriate individual. HIPAA authorizations are required for U S sites 
only. 
14.7. Study Publication  
All data generated from this study are the property of BioCryst and shall be held in strict confidence along 
with all information furnished by BioCryst. Independent analysis and/or publication of these data by the 
Investigator or any member of his/her staff are not permitted without prior written consent of BioCryst. Written  permission to the Investigator will be contingent on the review by BioCryst of the statistical 
analysis and manuscript and will provide for nondisclosure of BioCryst confidential or proprietary information. In all cases, the parties agree to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to all other parties 30 days prior to submission. This will enable all parties to protect proprietary information and to provide 
comments based on information that may not yet be available to other parties.

 DIVISION OF AIDS TABLE FOR GRADING THE SEVERITY OF   
ADULT AND PEDIATRIC ADVERSE EVENTS  
VERSION 1.0,  DECEMBER, 2004; CLARIFICATION AUGUST 2009  
The Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severi ty of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (“DAIDS AE 
Grading Table”) is a descriptive terminology which can be utilized for Adverse Event (AE) reporting. A 
grading (severity) scale is provided for each AE term. 
This clarification of the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric AE’s provides 
additional explanation of the DAIDS AE Grading T able and clarifies some of the parameters.  
I. Instructions and Clarifications 
Grading Adult and Pediatric AEs 
The DAIDS AE Grading Table includes parameters for grading both Adult and Pediatric AEs.  When a 
single set of parameters is not appropriate for grading specific types of AEs for both Adult and Pediatric 
populations, separate sets of parameters for Adult and/ or Pediatric populations (with specified respective 
age ranges) are given in the Table.  If there is no distinction in the Table between Adult and Pediatric 
values for a type of AE, then the single set of parameters listed is to be used for grading the severity of 
both Adult and Pediatric ev ents of that type.   
Note:  In the classification of adverse events, the term “ severe ” is not the same as “ serious.” 
Severity is an indication of the intensity  of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe chest 
pain). The term “ serious ” relates to a participant/event outcome or action criteria , usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a participant’s life or functioning.  
Addenda 1-3 Grading Tables for Microbicide Studies 
For protocols involving topical application of produ cts to the female genital tract, male genital area or 
rectum, strong consideration should be given to us ing Appendices I-III as the primary grading scales for 
these areas. The protocol would need to specifically state that one or  more of the Appendices would be 
primary (and thus take precedence over the main Grading Table) for items that are listed in both the 
Appendix and the main Grading Table. 
• Addendum 1 - Female Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies - PDF 
• Addendum 2 - Male Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies - PDF 
• Addendum 3 - Rectal Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies  -PDF 
Grade 5  
For any AE where the outcome is death, the se verity of the AE is classified as Grade 5.   
Estimating Severity Grade for Parameters Not Identified in the Table In order to grade a clinical AE that is not identified in the DAIDS AE grading table, use the category 
“Estimating Severity Grade” located on Page 3. 
Determining Severity Grade for Parameters “Between Grades” 
If the severity of a clinical AE could fall under either one of two grades (e.g., the severity of an AE could 
be either Grade 2 or Grade 3), select the higher of the two grades for the AE. If a laboratory value that is 
graded as a multiple of the ULN or LLN falls between two grades, select the higher of the two grades for 
the AE. For example, Grade 1 is 2.5 x ULN and Grade 2 is 2.6 x ULN for a parameter. If the lab value is 
2.53 x ULN (which is between the two grades), the severity of this AE would be Grade 2, the higher of the 
two grades. 
Values Below Grade 1  
Any laboratory value that is between either the LLN or ULN and Grade 1 should not be graded.

VERSION 1.0,  DECEMBER, 2004; CLARIFICATION AUGUST 2009  
Determining Severity Grade when Local Laboratory Normal Values Overlap with Grade 1 Ranges 
In these situations, the severity grading is based on the ranges in the DAIDS AE Grading Table, even 
when there is a reference to the local lab LLN. For example: Phosphate, Serum, Low, Adult and P ediatric > 14 years (Page 20) Grade 1 range is 2.50 
mg/dL - < LLN. A particular laboratory’s normal range for Phos phate is 2.1 – 3.8 mg/dL. A participant’s 
actual lab value is 2.5.  In this case, the value of  2.5 exceeds the LLN for the local lab, but will be graded 
as Grade 1 per DAIDS AE Grading Table .

changed from 0.155 to 0.6206 (the most co mmonly used conversion factor).  For grading  Hgb results obtained by an analytic 
method with a conversion factor other than 0.6206, the result must be converted to g/dL using the appropriate conversion factor 
for that lab.

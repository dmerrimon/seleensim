2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Disease (s) 
 
Fibroblast growth factors (FGF) and their receptors (FGFRs) play essential roles in 
mediating cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and survival.1 FGFR belongs to the 
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) receptor family of proteins that also includes epidermal gro wth 
factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) family. FGFR 
family has 5 members (FGFR1 -4 and FGFRL1) and 18 known ligands. The ligand -receptor 
interaction is stabilized by the formation of a ternary complex involving he paran sulfate 
proteoglycans (HSPG) or Klotho proteins.2 Specificity in signaling is afforded based on tissue 
specific expression as well  as interaction of FGFs, FGFRs, HSPGs, and Klotho  proteins . FGFR 
activation leads to phosphorylation of FGFR substrate 2 (FRS2) and recruit ment of growth 
factor -receptor bound 2 (GRB2) resulting in the activation of downstream mitogen activated 
protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI3K)/ Akt pathway. Additionally, 
activation of PKC is carried out independent of FRS2, through p hospholipase C -γ (PLC -γ) 
mediated activation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 -triphosphate (PIP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG).  
 Deregulation of FGF-FGFR signaling has been recognized in multiple solid tumors 
including breast, prostate, bladder, stomach, endometr ial and lung cancers.1 Cancer genomic  
analyses have identified alterations in  FGFR including point mutations, amplifications , and  gene 
fusions . A list of common FGFR  alterations in cancers is shown in Table -1. Mutations in FGFR2  
have been observed in about 10 -15% of endometrial cancers and these have also shown 
sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors.1 FGFR3  mutations are reported in approximately 70% of low 
grade urothelial carcinomas.3 Mutations in FGFR4  are identified in 7 to 8% of 
rhabdomyosa rcomas.4 Approximately, 10% of the patients with breast cancer harbor the 8p11 -12 
amplicon leading to overexpression of FGFR15 in the highly proliferative luminal B breast 
cancers and has been shown to correlate with resistance to hormonal therapy leading to worse 
outcomes.6, 7 Amplification of FGFR2  has also been implicated in 4% of triple -negative breast 
cancer s (TNBC)8, particularly in BRCA2 associated tumors.9 FGFR1  amplification has also been 
5 reported in 22% of squamous lung carcinomas.10 Gene fusions involving FGFR1  have been 
reported in alveolar rhabd omyosarcomas, 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome  and 
glioblastomas.11, 12 FGFR3 -MMSET  fusion resulting from t(4:14) translocation, is seen in 15 to 
20% of patients with multiple myeloma  and is associated with a worse prognosis.13 Recently, the 
Chinnaiyan Lab (Co -Investigator) at University at Michigan identified  novel FGFR2 and 
FGFR3 fusions in diverse solid tumors including biliary, breast, and prostate cancers. They 
further demonstrated that the FGFR  fusions result in constitutive activation of FGFR signaling , 
substantiating that FGFR  fusions could potentially be a clinically important target.14 The 
widespread prevalence of FGFR  activating alterations across multiple cancer subtypes provides 
an excellent opportunity to assess if FGFR inhibitors would lead to meaningful clinical responses 
among patients with activating alterations in FGFR .15-18

2.2.1 Ponatinib (AP24534)  
 
Ponatinib (Takeda Pharmaceutical Company ; Iclusig ) is a FDA -approved oral drug for the 
treatm ent of adult patients  with T315I -positive chronic myeloid leukemia  (CML)  (chronic phase, 
accelerated phase, or blast phase)  or T315I -Philadelphia chromosome positive acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL).  It is also indicated in the treatment of adult patients with 
chronic ph ase, accelerated phase, or blast phase CML or Ph+ ALL for whom no other tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy is indicated .25 In addition to BCR -ABL, it has activity against 
FGFR, KIT, platelet -derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), RET and FLT3 kinases.17, 26  
 
The following information is summarized from the Ponatini b Investigator’s Brochure ( 4.2014) 
and USPI  (12.2013) . 
 
Mechanism of Action  
 
 AP24534 (international non -proprietary name [INN]: ponatinib) is a novel, orally -
available TKI. In addition to BCR -ABL, ponatinib is also a potent inhibitor of members of the 
FGFR  family, which are implicated in a variety of solid tumors. Ponatinib also inhibits other 
kinases, including KIT, RET, VEGFR , PDGFR α, FMS -like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)  receptor 
tyrosine kinase expressed on vascular endothelium (TIE2), and tyrosine kina se homologous to 
the Rous sarcoma virus oncogene protein PP60 (SRC). Taken together, the kinase inhibition 
profile of ponatinib suggests the potential for clinical activity in other hematologic and non -
hematologic malignancies in addition to CML.  
 
Preclini cal data : 
 
FGFR  
 
Ponatinib potently inhibited the in vitro  kinase activity of all 4 FGFRs (IC50: 2 to 18 
nM). In Ba/F3 cells dependent on activated variants of native FGFR1 -4 (via fusion to a TEL 
dimerization domain), ponatinib inhibited viability with IC50s of 14 -47 nM. In Ba/F3 cells 
engineered to express activ ated FGFR1 -4, ponatinib potently inhibited FGFR mediated signaling 
and viability with IC50s <40 nM, with substantial selectivity over parental Ba/F3 cells.  Similar 
potency was observed in human embryonic kidney (HEK -293) cells transiently transfected to 
overexpress full -length FGFR1 -3, as measured by inhibition of FGFR phosphorylation (IC50s 
15-35 nM). In a panel of 14 cell lines representing multiple tumor types (endometrial, bladder, 
gastric, breast, lung, and colon), and containing FGFRs dysregulated by a variety of mechanisms, 
ponatinib inhibited FGFR mediated signaling with IC50s <40 nM and inhibited viability with 
IC50 values of 7 to  181 nM.17 Ponatinib had substantially reduced activity (IC50s>300nM) 
against cells that did not contain a deregulated FGFR. Daily oral dosing of ponatinib (10 to 30 
mg/kg) to mice reduced tumor growth and inhibited signaling in all 3 FGFR -driven models 
examined. These results demonstrate that ponatinib is a potent inhibitor of all 4 FGFR family 
members with activity in multiple FGFR -driven cancer types.  
 
7 The HEK ce ll system was used to further assess  ponatinib’s ability to inhibit  FGFR 
mutations. Of 12 FGFR2 mutants tested, ponatinib inhibited the activity of 10 with high potency 
and 2 with moderate potency. The 10 mutants inhibited most potently (IC50 < 45 nM) included 
the 2 that together account for over half of those observed in endometrial cancer (S252W and 
N550K).  Also included were the mutants located in all 4 functional domains: the LB domain 
(S252W and P253R), the EC domain (Y376C and W290C), the TM domai n (C383R), and the 
KD domain (I548V, N550K, G584W, K660N and R738K). The 2 FGFR2 mutants inhibited with 
moderate potency (IC50: 113 nM to 152 nM) were N550H and K660E.  Ponatinib had moderate 
potency against the FGFR3 -S249C EC domain mutant (IC50: 128 nM) c ommonly found in 
bladder cancer, and did not inhibit the less common K652E KD mutant. Ponatinib potently 
inhibited the FGFR1 -N546K KD mutant found in glioblastoma multiforme (IC50: 18 nM).  
 
 
RET 
 
RET kinase is deregulated by activating mutations or fusion gene formation in 
multiple cancers. RET point mutations are found in 50 -95% of medullary thyroid cancers (MTC) 
and translocations involving RET occur in papillary thyroid cancer.27 Recently, a novel 
translocation that results in formation of a KIF5B -RET fusion oncogene has been identified in 1 -
2% of non -small cell lung cancers (NSCL C).28 Ponatinib inhibits the in vitro kinase activity of 
RET with an IC50 of 0.16 nM. In Ba/F3 cells de pendent on activated RET (activated via fusion 
to the TEL dimerization domain) ponatinib potently inhibited viability with an IC50 of 8 nM. In 
Ba/F3 cells dependent on expression of the most common, naturally -occurring activated variants 
of RET found in MT C and NSCLC, ponatinib potently inhibits viability of RET C634R, RET 
M918T, and KIF5B -RET cells with IC50s of 2, 3, and 11 nM, respectively. Consistent with these 
effects being due to inhibition of RET, ponatinib inhibited RET phosphorylation with similar 
potency in each respective cell line (IC50s of 4, 2, and 9 nM).  
 
PDGFR and KIT  
 
In in vitro  assays, ponatinib has been  shown to inhibit the kinase activity of PDGFRα 
(1.1 nM IC50), as well as PDGFRβ . In Ba/F3 cells dependent on activated PDGFRα, ponatinib  
inhibited viability and PDGFRα phosphorylation with IC50s of 1 and 5 nM, respectively and in a 
cell line containing an activated PDGFRα (FIP1L1 - PDGFRα fusion), ponatinib inhibited 
viability and PDGFRα phosphorylation with IC50s of 0.5 and 0.6 nM, respect ively.  Ponatinib 
also potently inhibited viability of Ba/F3 cells expressing activated PDGFRα containing the 
gatekeeper T674I mutation with an IC50 of 2 nM.29 
Ponatinib has been shown to inhibit the kinase activity of KIT (12.5 nM IC50). In 
cellular assays, ponatinib also inhibited activated variants of KIT and variants  with secondary 
mutations that confer clinical resistance to other KIT inhibitors approved for the treatment of 
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST ), imatinib and sunitinib. Ponatinib potently inhibited 
viability of Ba/F3 cells expressing activated KIT ( exon 11 Δ557 -8), activated KIT with a 
secondary T670I gatekeeper mutation, and activated KIT with the secondary activation loop (A -
loop) mutations D816H, D820A, N822K, and A829P (IC50s <15 nM for all mutants).29 
Ponatinib potency is slightly reduced versus the KIT exon 9 primary mutant (IC50 = 56 nM), or 
when V654A is p resent as a secondary mutation (IC50 = 59 nM). Takeda  is supporting a separate 
8 clinical trial investigating the benefit of ponatinib for the treatment of advanced gastrointestinal 
tumor (GIST) with KIT mutations refractory to two different tyrosine kinase i nhibitors.  
 
FLT3  
 
Ponatinib inhibits the in vitro  kinase activity of FLT3 with an IC50 of 12.6 nM. Studies 
conducted to examine the activity of ponatinib in models of FLT3 -driven AML.30 Ponatinib 
potently inhibited phosphorylation of FLT3 -ITD and viability of MV4 -11 cells with IC50s ≤2 
nM. In contrast, ponatinib inhibited viability of RS4 -11 cells, which express native FLT3, with 
an IC50 >100 nM. MV4 -11 cells were used to test the antitumor activity of ponatinib in vivo. In 
a xenograft model, significant inhibition of tumor growth occurred with daily oral dosing o f 
ponatinib at doses of 2.5 mg/kg and greater. After administration of a single dose of ponatinib, a 
dose-dependent inhibition of FLT3 -ITD phosphorylation in the tumor was observed that was 
associated with the degree of antitumor activity.  In an in vitro k inase assay, ponatinib did not 
potently inhibit FLT3 containing a D835Y activating mutation (IC50: 948 nM).  
 
Pharmacodynamics  
 
In a cell -based assay, ponatinib concentrations of 20 nM (10.65 ng/mL) were sufficient to 
suppress most BCR -ABL mutant clones. However, ponatini b concentrations of 40 nM (21.3 
ng/mL) were required to suppress T315I gatekeeper mutants.  The median and range of steady -
state Cmax and trough (Cmin) concentrations of ponatinib following 29 days of once -daily 
dosing of 15 mg, 30 mg and 4 5 mg are listed below .

Pharmacokinetics  
 
Absorption  
 The AP24534 -07-101 Phase 1 study, evaluated the safety, tolerability, maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) and biologic  properties of ponatinib, using a sequential, dose escalation, 
3+3 design with expansion of some cohorts to provide additional safety data at each dose level 
(2, 4, 8, 15,  30, 45, or 60 mg/day).25 Dose escalation began at 2 mg and exten ded up to 60 mg 
once -daily oral dosing.  The pharmacokinetic profiles of parent ponatinib and AP24567 (a 
CYP3A4/5 -mediated desmethyl -ponatinib metabolite) were characterized on the first day of  
study treatment, Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1), and on Day 1 of Cycle 2 (C2D1).  All patients in the 2, 4, 
8, 15, and 30 mg cohorts were given the capsule formulation. However,  a total of 24 of 50 
patients in the combined 45 and 60 mg cohorts received a tablet formulation  instead of the 
capsule.  In the 45 mg and  60 mg cohorts, there was no evidence  of statistically important 
differences between the tablet  and capsule formulations based on either C max (p=0.53) or AUC0 -
τ (p=0.64). Therefore, the  capsule and tablet pharmacokinetic  data were pooled together in 
summaries by dose in this analysis.  As of 0 6 January 2014, 24 (29.6%) of the 81 enrolled 
9 patients remained on therapy. Median patient age was 55 years; median time elapsed from 
original diagnosis to enrollment was 5.5 years. Prior therapies in CML and Ph+ ALL patients 
included imatinib (97%), dasat inib (89%), nilotinib (55%), and other standard and investigational 
therapies; 94% of patients experienced a failure of 2 or more prior TKIs, while 62% had 
experienced a failure of 3 or more TKIs.  
 
Ponatinib plasma level data indicated that C max occurred 4 to 6 hours after dosing, and  
steady -state t1/2 was between 20 and 29 hours for doses ≥15 mg.  The median t max in the 15 
through  60 mg cohorts was 4 hours.  At 45 mg (the recommended therapeutic dose), steady -state 
geometric mean (GeoMean) C max and minimum plasma concentration (C min) (both ng/mL), AUC 
from time 0 to the end of the dosing period  (eg, 24 hours; AUC0 -τ; h.ng/mL), and t1/2 (hours) 
were 77.41 (145.3 nM; percent coefficient of  variance [%CV] 49.9), 34.22 (64.3 nM; %CV 
45.4), 1296 (%CV 48 .1), and 22 (%CV 55.5), respectively.  The mean steady -state C max and AUC 
appeared to increase in a manner approximately  proportional with increasing dose, particularly in 
the 15 - to 60 -mg dose range.  Cmax of 25.82 ng/mL (48.48 nM) at the 15 mg dose, and st eady -
state trough  concentrations (C trough) of 29.85 ng/mL (56.05 nM) at the 30 mg dose exceeded the 
40 nM  exceeded the concentration (40nM) required for suppression of BCR -ABL . Following 
ingestion of either a high -fat or low -fat meal by 22 healthy voluntee rs, plasma ponatinib 
exposures (AUC and C max) were not different when compared to fasting conditions. The aqueous 
solubility of ponatinib is pH dependent, with higher pH resulting in lower solubility. Drugs that 
elevate the gastric pH may reduce ponatinib bioavailability .  
Distribution  
 Ponatinib was very highly bound to plasma protein of mouse, rat, monkey and human 
(≥99.8%). The blood to plasma partition ratios for ponatinib was 1.20, 1.13, 1.11, and 0.96 
respectively, in mouse, rat, monkey, and human blood. The percent distribution into RBCs was 
49.2%, 48.8%, 48.5%, and 46.8%, respectively in mouse, rat, monkey, and human blood. These 
results show ponatinib is equally distributed into RBCs and plasma.  The geometric mean (CV %) 
apparent steady state volu me of distribution is 1223 liters (102%) following oral administration 
of ponatinib  45 mg once daily for 28 days in pa tients with cancer.  Ponatinib is a weak substrate 
for both P -gp and BCRP  in vitro . Ponatinib is not a substrate for organic anion transpo rting 
polypeptides (OATP1B1, OATP1B3) and organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) in vitro . In vitro, 
ponatinib bound to human plasma proteins (at 145 nM) was not displaced from the binding sites 
by other highly protein -bound drugs: ibuprofen, salicylic acid, propranolol, nifedipine, or 
warfarin.  
 
  
Metabolism  
 Ponatinib was not extensively metabolized in rat and human microsomes, but was 
metabolized to a moderate extent in monkey liver microsomes. The rate of metabolism 
(pmol/min/mg of protein) was 38.7, 83.5,  and 36.2, respectively, in rat, monkey, and human liver 
microsomes. Major biotransformation pathways in liver microsomes were the formation of N -
desmethyl ponatini b (AP24567 ), and ponatinib N -oxide (AP24734 ). Metabolite AP24600 was 
not observed in these i n vitro systems.  Ponatinib was not metabolized by rhCYPs (recombinant 
human CYPs) 1A2, 2C9, and 2E1.rhCYPs 3A5 and 2C19 metabolized ponatinib to AP24567 and 
AP24734, but only to a very low extent of 3% to 5%. At least 64% of a ponatinib dose undergoes 
phase I and phase II metabolism.  Ponatinib was mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (52%), to a 
10 moderate extent by CYP2C8 (30.4%), and to lesser extent by CYP2D6 (14.4%).  Results from 
the CYP -inhibition studies, using isoform -specific chemical inhibitors and inhibito ry monoclonal 
antibodies, show that ponatinib was mostly metabolized by CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent by 
CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP3A5. Since ponatinib is mostly metabolized by CYP3A4/5, it is 
likely to have drug -drug interactions with co -administered CYP3A4/ 5 inhibitors.  Ponatinib  is an 
inhibitor of P-glycoprotein , BCRP, and bile salt export pump (BSEP).  
 
Elimination  
 The excretion of [14C] ponatinib in humans was investigated following a single target 
oral dose of 45 mg/100 μCi. [14C]  Ponatinib (drug powder in capsules) was administered orally 
to each of 6 subjects (age 19 to 45 years) as three 15 -mg capsules (each containing ~36.7 μCi) 
with 240 mL of non -carbonated water in the fasted state. Whole plasma, urine, feces, and toilet 
tissue wipes were collected u p to the time of discharge (10 to 14 days post dose, different for 
each subject).  The mean percentage radioactive dose recovered was 5.38 ± 0.93% and 86.63 ± 
2.37%, in urine and feces respectively.  In human plasma following an oral dose of [14C] 
ponatinib,  ponatinib and metabolite AP24600 were the 2 major radioactive components. The 
levels of AP24600 were 58.4% of ponatinib levels. Urinary metabolites were mostly AP24600 
and its glucuronides. In human feces, all of the metabolites were biotransformation pro ducts of 
intact ponatinib. Ponatinib accounted for 23.7% of the radioactivity in feces and there was 
extensive metabolism of ponatinib in feces. Other metabolites identified in feces were hydroxy 
ponatinib, N -desmethyl ponatinib, and several minor metaboli tes. The geometric mean (range) 
terminal elimination half -life of ponatinib was approximately 24 (12 to 66) hours following 
ponatinib 45 mg oral administration once daily for 28 days in patients with cancer.  
 
Drug Interactions  
 
Ponatinib is a reversible i nhibitor of CYPs, with IC50 in the range of 5.2 to 13.6 μM. 
Ponatinib is unlikely to inhibit CYP -mediated metabolism of concomitant drugs at plasma 
concentrations of ≤ 260 nM. Ponatinib is not a metabolism - or time -dependent inhibitor. The 
major human  plasma metabolite, AP24600, was not an inhibitor of CYPs. Ponatinib did not 
induce expression of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 in the primary human hepatocytes up to a 
concentration of 5 μM.  
 
 Based on in vitro studies ponatinib is a substrate of CYP3A4/ 5 and to a lesser extent 
CYP2C8 and CYP2D6. Ponatinib also inhibits the P -glycoprotein (P -gp), ATP -binding cassette 
G2 (ABCG2) [also known as BCRP], and  BSEP transporter systems in vitro. In a drug 
interaction study in healthy volunteers, co -administration of ponatin ib with ketoconazole 
increased plasma ponatinib AUC 0-inf  and C max by 78% and 47%, respectively, while exposure to 
AP24567 decreased by approximately 70%.  When administering ponatinib  with strong CYP3A 
inhibitors (e.g., boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, indinavir, itraconazole, 
ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole) , the recommended starting dose should be reduced to 30 
mg once daily.  Patients taking concomitant strong inhibitors may be at incre ased risk for adverse 
reactions.  
 
 The phase 1 rifampin study (AP24534 -12-107) was conducted in healthy subjects to  
11 evaluate  the effect of multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampin on the PK of a single oral 45 -mg 
dose of ponatinib  and its CYP3A4 -mediated human metabolite of ponatinib, AP24567 . Overall, 
the rifampin study demonstrated a statistically and clinically relevant effect  of rifampin 
coadministration on relative ponatinib and AP24567 bioavailability. Estimated mean ratios of 
Cmax, AUC0 -t , and AUC0 -∞, indicated decreased exposure to ponatinib by approximately 42%, 
59%, and 62%, respectively. Time to achieve maximal plasma ponatinib and AP24567 
concentrations was not altered.  Estimated mean ratios of C max, AUC0 -t , and AUC0 -∞, indicated 
increased exposure to AP24567 by 222%, 114%, and 93%, respectively. Mean t½ was lower for 
both ponatinib and AP24567.  
 
Co-administration of strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, and St. 
John’s Wort) with ponatinib should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the possible risk of 
ponatinib underexposure. Monitor patients for signs of reduced efficacy.  
 
 Ponatinib displays pH -dependent aqueous solubility in vitro ; as pH increases, 
ponatinib  solubility decreases. These in vitro data suggest that concomitant administration of 
agents that  alter gastric pH, including H2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors, could affect 
ponatinib  absorption and should be avoided  unless the benefit outweighs the possible risk of 
ponatinib underexposure.  AP 24534 -12-108 is a phase -1 study designed to evaluate the effects 
of concomitant multiple doses of lansoprazole on the PK profile of single dose ponatinib in 
healthy subjects. This study demonstrated a statistically significant effect of lansoprazole 
coadministration on ponatinib C max and T max. However, these changes in absorption -related 
parameters did not result in correspon ding changes in overall plasma exposure to ponatinib 
across the 2 treatments or the elimination half -life. Similar observations were observed for the 
main metabolite, AP24600.  Estimated mean ratios of ponatinib and AP24600 C max decreased by 
25%, and the 90 % CIs did not fall within the 80% to 125% required for bioequivalence, 
suggesting the presence of a statistically significant DDI. Time to achieve maximal plasma 
ponatinib and AP24600 concentrations was slightly delayed by 1 and 2 hours, respectively; this  
is not thought to represent a clinically relevant difference. Plasma exposures of ponatinib and 
AP24600 in terms of AUC0 -t and AUC0 -∞ were equivalent after ponatinib dosing either alone 
or with lansoprazole (eg, within the bioequivalence criteria). Mean t ½ was not altered for either 
ponatinib or AP24600.  These minor reductions in plasma ponatinib C max, without corresponding 
decreases in overall plasma exposure, are not believed to be important clinical safety or efficacy 
findings. Ponatinib therefore may b e administered concurrently with drugs that raise gastric pH, 
without the need for a ponatinib dose adjustment or separation of administration.  
 
 In vitro studies demonstrate that ponatinib  inhibits the P -gp and ABCG2 [BCRP] 
transporter systems. The effect  of co -administration of ponatinib  with sensitive substrates of the 
P-gp (e.g., aliskiren, colchicine, dabigatran , digoxin, everolimus, fexofenadine, lapatinib, 
maraviroc, posaconazole, ranolazine, sirolimus, sitagliptin, tolvaptan, topotecan) and ABCG2 
(e.g., methotrexate, mitoxantrone, irinotecan, lapatinib, rosuvastatin, sulfasalazine, topotecan) 
transporter systems on exposure of these substrates has not been evaluated in clinical studies.
  
 
 
Safety Profile  
12  
As of 06 January 2014, 753 patients have rece ived ponatinib therapy through clinical 
studies, and 1312 through global expanded access programs.  Following approval of ponatinib in 
the US and in Europe, more than 900 patients have been treated with ponatinib commercially. 
Ponatinib has a FDA safety label for arterial thrombosis , heart failure  and hepatotoxicity. It is 
likely that some of the adverse effects are specific to myeloproliferative disorders (e.g . 
thrombosis, neutropenia).  A dose intensity safety analysis showed a significant increase in gr ade 
3 or higher adverse reactions (i.e., hypertension, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, rash, ALT 
elevation, AST elevation, pancreatitis, and lipase elevation) with an increase in dose intensity.  
 
 
Phase -1 (AP24534 -07-101) study  
 
In the AP24534 -07-101 phas e-1 study, all the 81% experience d at least 1 adverse event (AE) 
during the study.  Patients in the phase 1 study received a median dose intensity of 30 mg of 
ponatinib daily.  The median dosing period was 308 days (3 to 1799 days).  
 
By System  Organ Class ( SOC), 50 or more patients experienced events in the following 
categories:  
 Gastrointestinal disorders (70 patients, 86.4%)  
 General disorders and administration site conditions (68, 84.0%)  
 Investigations (65, 80.2%)  
 Infections and infestations (64, 79.0%)  
 Nervous system disorders and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (58, 71.6% each)  
 Metabolism and nutrition disorders and Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders  
 (57, 70.4% each)  
 Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (50, 61.7%)  
 
Treat ment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported in more than 25% of patients included:  
 rash (48.1% of patients)  
 nausea (45.7%)  
 abdominal pain and fatigue (44.4% each)  
 headache (42.0%)  
 constipation and arthralgia (39.5% each)  
 vomiting (38.3%)

 peripheral edema, pyrexia, and platelet count decreased (35.8% each)  
 diarrhea (29.6%)  
 dry skin (27.2%)  
 pain in extremity (25.9%)  
 
Sixty -nine (85.2%) patients had events considered by the investigator to be related to ponatinib.  
Treatment -related AEs (TRAEs) of any grade, by preferred term, that occurred in more than 10%  
of patients included:  
 rash (33.3% of patients)  
13  platelet count decreased (29.6%)  
 lipase increased (19.8%)  
 arthralgia, dry skin, and fatigue (17.3% each)  
 pancreatitis (14.8%)  
 nausea, dermatitis acneiform, and headache (13.6% each)  
 abdominal pain, neutrophil count decreased, myalgia, and hypertriglyceridemia (12.3%  
 each)  
 hypertension (11.1%)  
 
Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported for 63 patients. The most commonly reported (≥ 10% of  
patients ) SAEs were:  
 febrile neutropenia (14.8% of patients)  
 pneumonia (13.6%)  
 pyrexia (12.3%)  
 pancreatitis (11.1%)  
 
Twenty -one patients had SAEs that were considered by the investigator to be related to  
treatment, including the following:  
 pancreatitis (9 patients , 11.1%)  
 myocardial infarction (MI) and peripheral arterial occlusive disease (2 patients each,  
 2.5%)  
 abdominal pain, accidental overdose, cardiac failure congestive, cardiomyopathy, 
cerebral infarction, cholecystitis acute, coronary artery disease, dehydr ation, ejection  
fraction decreased, electrocardiogram (ECG) QT prolonged, hypertension, interstitial  
lung disease, intestinal ischemia, LVD, peripheral ischemia, platelet count decreased,  
troponin increased, and visceral arterial ischemia (1 patient each, 1.2%)  
 
Twenty patients died within 30 days of their last ponatinib dose. Time on study for these  patients 
ranged from 11 to 1496 days (4.1 years). One patient in the 8 -mg cohort died 2 days  after 
receiving the last ponatinib dose, from a possibly related c ase of acute ischemic bowel. The 
investigator considered the SAE of acute ischemia bowel to be fatal (Grade 5) in intensity 
(previously reported as life threatening) and possibly related to study drug.  
Since cardiac events have been reported following use of approved TKIs, patients were 
monitored for signs of QT prolongation. Non -corrected QT decreased in both the 30 mg and 60 
mg dose groups between baseline and end -of-study; patients in the 45 mg dose group 
experienced a mean increase of 3.3 milliseconds i n non -corrected QT in the same period.   
Twenty -eight patients in the phase 1 study experienced 1 or more events with preferred terms 
that have been classified as vascular occlusive.  Among these 28 patients, 7 experienced 14 
vascular occlusive events that w ere considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably 
related to ponatinib therapy.  
 
 
 
 
Phase -2 (AP24534 -10-201) study  
14  
In the Phase 2 Study (AP24534 -10-201), for patients who had refractory CML (any phase) or 
Ph+ ALL, and either were resistant to or intolerant of therapy with either dasatinib or nilotinib; 
or had developed the T315I mutation of BCR -ABL , as of 06 January 2014, 172 (38.3%) patients 
remained on treatment, while 277 (61.7%) had discontinued.  Median duration of exposure was 
508 days (ranging from 1 to 1202 days), with an overall median dose intensity of 36.2 mg QD 
(ranging from 3 to 52 mg QD). The majority (291, 64.8%) of phase 2 patients had their dose 
reduced at some point during the study, and 310 (69.0%) had a dose interruption of  at least 3 
days while on study. Eighty -nine (30.6%) of the patients with dose reductions had their  
doses later re -escalated, and all (100.0%) of the patients with dose interruptions of 3 or more 
days resumed ponatinib therapy  . All but 1 patient (448, 99. 8%) experienced at least 1 TEAE, 
419 (93.3%) experienced at least 1 TRAE, 277 (61.7%) experienced at least 1 SAE, and 137 
(30.5%) experienced at least 1 treatment -related SAE.  
 
Treatment -emergent AEs of any grade that occurred in ≥10% of patients overall i ncluded:

Sixty -eight patients (46 CP -CML; 9 AP -CML; 11 BP -CML; 2 Ph+ ALL) discontinued 
participation in the phase 2 study due to a TEAE. Platelet count decreased was the most common 
TEAE leading to discontinuation (17 patients, 3.8%), and was also the most common T RAE 
leading to discontinuation (18 patients, 4.0%). Coronary artery disease, myelodysplastic 
syndrome, and sepsis led to discontinuation of 2 patients each. All other events leading to  
patients withdrawing from the study occurred in 1 patient each, and can generally be grouped 
into vascular occlusive events, other cardiac events, laboratory abnormalities, and general 
conditions (eg, asthenia, pain, headache).  
16  
Fifty -two of 449 phase 2 p atients (11.6%) have died within 30 days of their last ponatinib dose or  
due to a treatment -related SAE. As of 06 January 2014, 5 of these deaths, described below, were  
considered treatment -related due to SAEs of pneumonia, acute myocardial infarction (AMI )/MI,  
pneumonia fungal, gastritis hemorrhagic, and cardiac arrest, respectively.  
 
Phase -2 study of ponatinib in GIST (AP24534 -12-202).  
 
This study was intended to evaluate ponatinib therapy in patients with metastatic and/or 
unresectable GIST, following fa ilure of prior treatment with 1 or more TKIs.  In this study, 
median dose intensity was 45.0 mg QD, ranging from 23.4 to 45.0 mg QD. Twenty -six percent 
of patients required either a dose reduction or an interruption of treatment of 3 days or more.  
 
Rash was  the most frequently reported TEAE (19 patients, 54.3% of patients overall), followed  
by: 
 myalgia and fatigue (16 patients each, 45.7%)  
 dry skin and headache (14, 40.0% each)  
 abdominal pain and constipation (12, 34.3% each)  
 blood alkaline phosphatase incre ased and hypertension (10 each, 28.6%)  
 peripheral edema (9, 25.7%)  
 decreased appetite (8, 22.9%)  
 nausea, pyrexia, AST increased, and cough (6, 17.1% each)  
 vomiting and ALT increased (5, 14.3% each)  
 dyspepsia, lipase increased, dysphonia, dyspnea, and insom nia (4, 11.4% each)  
 
TRAEs affecting 10 or more patients overall included:  
 rash (19, 54.3%)  
 myalgia (16, 45.7%)  
 dry skin and fatigue (14, 40.0% each)  
 headache (13, 37.1%)  
 constipation (11, 31.4%)  
  
All other TEAEs occurred in fewer than 10% of patients, and  no events of pancreatitis were 
reported. There were no grade 4 events. One grade 5 event was reported (preferred term: 
pneumonia, reported as related to ponatinib treatment). Grade 3 TEAEs in more than 1 patient 
included:  abdominal pain and lipase increa sed (3 each) and anemia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, 
and hypertension (2 each) . 
 
Ten patients had at least 1 SAE. Gastrointestinal disorders (5 patients), and Cardiac disorders, 
General disorders and administration site conditions, and Infections and infest ations (2 patients 
each) contributed the majority of SAEs. By preferred term, the most common SAEs were:  
 abdominal pain (4, 11.4%)  
 fatigue, nausea, and vomiting (2, 5.7% each)  
 intestinal abscess, duodenal stenosis, hypercalcemia, hypoxia, MI, pneumonia, and right  
ventricular dysfunction (each in single patients, 2.9% each)  
17  
Seven patients discontinued the GIST study due to development of AEs. Most patients had been  
receiving ponatinib for less than 2 weeks at the time of event onset; most events were cons idered 
at least possibly related to treatment.  
 
A Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks (CAEPR) list using NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) terms is included in Section  7.1 of the 
protocol.  
 
Vascular Occlusion  
 Arterial  and venous thrombosis and occlusions, including fatal myocardial infarction, 
stroke, stenosis of large arterial vessels of the brain, severe peripheral vascular disease, and the 
need for urgent revascularization procedures have occurred  
in at least 27% of  ponatinib -treated patients from the phase 1 and ph ase 2 trials. Ponatinib can 
cause fatal and life -threatening vascular occlusion within 2 weeks of starting treatment. 
Ponatinib  can also cause recurrent or multi -site vascular occlusion.  The median time to  onset of 
the first vascular occlusion event was 5 months.  Ponatinib can cause fatal and life  threatening 
vascular occlusion in patients treated at dose levels as low as 15 mg per day.  Patients with and 
without cardiovascular risk factors, including patien ts age 50 years or you nger, experienced these 
events. Vascular occlusion adverse events were more frequent with increasing age and in patients 
with prior history of ischemia, hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia

 Arterial Thrombosis  
Cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular thrombosis, including fatal MI and 
stroke have been observed in ponatinib -treated patients. Patients with cardiovascular risk factors 
are at increased risk for art erial thrombosis with ponatinib;  therefore, these patients are 
excluded for this protocol.  Monitor patients for arterial thr ombotic events, and consider 
interrupting or stopping ponatinib if these events are suspected.   
 
18 In AP24534 -10-201 (phase -2 trial of ponatinib in refractory CML and ALL),  91/449 patients 
(20%) experienced at least 1 treatment -emergent ischemic  vascular eve nt: 55 (12%) had 
cardiovascular events, 27  (6%) had cerebrovascular events and  36 (8 %) had peripheral vascular 
events.  
 
Overall, 53 patients (12 %) experienced ischemic vascular  SAEs: 28 (6%) had cardiovascular 
SAEs, 18 (4 %) had cerebrovascular SAEs, and 16  (4%) had  peripheral vascular SAEs. The most 
commonly reported SAEs were MI/AMI (14/449: 3%),  CAD (10/449: 2%), and CVA (9 /449: 
2%). Four fatalities were reported due to events in this MedDRA preferred -term search: AMI 
(considered by the investigator to be possibly related to ponatinib), CAD, cerebral ischemia, and 
hemorrhagic cerebral infarction.  Of 22 patients with SAEs of MI/AMI or CAD, 14 developed 
CHF concurrent or  subsequent to the myocardi al ischemic event. Ten of the  18 patients with 
SAEs of cerebrovascular ischemic events developed stenosis of large arterial vessels of the brain 
(eg, carotid, vertebral, middle cerebral artery).  Ponatinib was withdrawn for 7 patients due to 
AEs in this group of preferred terms: CAD, h emorrhagic cerebral infarction, cerebral infarction, 
cerebral infarction with cerebral artery stenosis, CAD and myocardial ischemia with peripheral 
arterial occlusive disease (PAOD), CVA, and peripheral ischemia.  The hemorrhagic cerebral 
infarction (consid ered by the investigator not related) was fatal, and peripheral ischemia and 
CAD/PAOD (considered by the investigator possibly/probably related) were reported as not 
resolved. All other events were reported as resolved.  Most other patients’ SAEs in this li st of 
preferred terms also resolved, either with dose adjustments or no change to the dose. Almost all 
patients with ischemic vascular SAEs had at least 1 risk factor, and most had more than 1.  
 
Peripheral arterial occlusive events, including fatal mesente ric artery occlusion and life -
threatening peripheral arterial disease, have occurred in ponatinib -treated patients. Patients have 
developed digital or distal extremity necrosis and have required amputations. Peripheral vascular 
SAEs were  also reported in t he AP24534 -07-101 trial. Angina pectoris and MI  were reported as 
treatment -related SAEs. One case of cerebral infarction in the expanded access program was 
considered by the investigator possibly related to ponatinib . 
 
 Venous Thromboembolism  
In AP24534 -10-201, venous thromboembolic  events were observed in 5 % (23/449) of ponatinib -
treated  patients, including deep venous thrombosis/veno us embolism/venous thrombosis (11  
patients),  pulmonary embolism (6 patients), superficial thrombophlebitis (3 patients) , retinal vein 
thrombosis (2 patients)  and 1 case each of portal vein thrombosis, and veno -occlusi ve liver 
disease. Consider dose interruption of ponatinib in patients who develop serious venous 
thromboembolism.  
 
Neuropathy  
Similar to vascular occlusion, a p rospectively defined, MedDRA -based search strategy,  
containing nearly 300 preferred terms, was employed in the summ arization of neuropathy events. 
Events were  further classified as peripheral or cranial neuropathy.  
 
Peripheral and cranial neuropathy has oc curred in ponatinib -treated patients. Monitor patients for 
symptoms of neuropathy, such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthe sia, paresthesia, discomfort, a burning 
sensation, neuropathic pain or weakness. Consider interru pting ponatinib and evaluate if 
19 suspected.  
 
In AP24534 -10-201, neuropathy events were observed  in 14% (65/449) of patients (cranial in 
1% (6/449) and peripheral in 13%  (59/449 ). The most common events w ere peripheral 
neuropathy (4%), paresthesia (4%), hypoesthesia (2%), and hyperesthesia (1%). Of t he patients 
who d eveloped neuropathy, 31% (20/65)  developed neuropathy during the first month of 
treatment. One patient discontinued therapy because of neuropathy events (IVth nerve paralysis).  
 
Hepatotoxicity  
Liver function test abnormalities are seen with ponatinib, and hepatic failure has been reported.  
Hepatotoxicity, most commonly manifested by reversible transaminase and alkaline phosphatase 
elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, has been observed in patients taking ponatinib. Fulminant 
hepatic failure leading to death occurred in a patient within one week of starting ponatinib. Two 
additional fatal cases of acute liver failure also occurred.  The fatal cases occurred in patients with 
blast phase CML or Ph+ ALL. Severe hepatotoxicity occurred in all disea se cohorts.  
 
Monitor liver function tests at baseline, then at least monthly or as clinically indicated. Interrupt, 
reduce or discontinue ponatinib as clinically indicated.  
 
The incidence of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation 
was 56% (all grades) and 8% (grade 3 or 4). Ponatinib treatment may result in elevation in ALT, 
AST, or both. ALT or AST elevation was not reversed by the date of last follow -up in 5% of 
patients.  Eight percent of patients had grade 3 or 4 elevation in ALT, 4% had grade 3 or 4 
elevation in AST  and 2% had grade 3 or 4 elevation in alkaline phosphatase.  Two patients whose  
laboratory values met Hy ’s Law criteria for drug induced liver injury had other etiology to 
explain the laboratory results:  one patient  had liver failure due to disease progression and died 
due to progressive CML, and the second patient had underlying possible Gilbert ’s syndrome .  
Acute hepatic failure leading to death was reported in 1 Ph+ ALL patient with decreased cardiac  
function (an ejection fraction decreased to 28% from 54% within the 5 months prior to first dose)  
within one week of starting ponatinib (Japan phase 1/2 trial: AP24534 -11-106). One additional  
case of acute liver failure from the expanded access program was reported. The patient, with  Ph+ 
ALL, had liver failure in conju nction with disease progression.  
 
Congestive Heart Failure  (CHF)  
Severe congestive heart failure (CHF) and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction have been reported 
in patients taking ponatinib. Patients with cardiac disease or risk factors for cardiac disease  
should be monitored carefully and any patient with signs or symptoms consistent with cardiac 
failure should be evaluated and trea ted. Consider discontinuation of  ponatinib in patients who 
develop serious CHF.   
 
As of 6 January 2014, 37 (8.2%) patients had events of cardiac failure; 23 (5.1%) of these were  
serious, with SAEs in 14 patients (3%) considered related to therapy, with 4 f atalities  (cardiac 
failure congestive in 2, and cardiac failure and cardiopulmonary failure in 1 patient each. None 
of the deaths was considered related to ponatinib) . Most patients had advanced CML , and almost 
all had at least 1 cardiac risk factor, with multiple cardiac risk factors in more than half the 
patients.  Twenty -four patients with cardiac failure events discontinued therapy: 6 did so due to 
20 AEs, 7 because of progressive disease/lack of efficacy, 6 by either patient or investigator 
withdrawal or for other reasons, and 5 due to fatal events (4 were cardiac events, discussed 
above; 1 was due to pneumonia, which was considered not related to ponatinib).  The majority of 
patients treated with ponatinib who have experienced cardiac failure AEs have also  experienced 
vaso-occlusive AEs, either with a direct temporal relationship or, less frequently, with timing 
that makes a relationship less clear. Almost all patients who experienced cardiac failure events in 
the absence of vascular occlusive events had a strong history of heart failure, ischemic disease, 
or structural heart disease.  
 
Hypertension  
Patients receiving ponatinib  have experienced hypertension and blood pressure should be 
monitored at each visit . In addition, a home blood pressure assessment wil l be performed twice 
per week for patients starting ponatinib, using blood pressure cuff supplied by the study sponsor, 
Takeda . Patients will be instructed to contact their study doctor and/or study coordinator in the 
event an at -home blood pressure reading reaches  ≥ 160/90. Any hypertensive measurement will 
be confirmed by the study team in clinic. For patients who develop HTN or  worsening HTN 
during study treatment, antihypertensive medication should be initiated or optimized to achieve 
target blood pressure before interruption or dose reduction of the study treatment at the discretion 
of the investigator.  If hypertension is per sistent despite adequate anti -HTN therapy includ ing 
titration of anti-HTN medication or introduction of additional an ti-HTN medications, or if grade 
4 HTN develop s, dose interruption,  reduction  or discontinuation is recommended.  A 
measurement of ≥ 160/100 requires dose interruption.  
 
Treatment -emergent hypertension occurr ed in 67% of patients (300/449) treated with ponatinib. 
In AP24534 -10-201, 9 (2%) patients treated with ponatinib experienced treatment -emergent  
hypertension as a serious adverse reaction a nd one patient (<1%) experienced treatment  
emergent  hypertensive crisis as a serious adverse reaction, and required clinical intervention for  
hypertension associated with confusion, headache, chest pain, or shortness of breath.   
In patients with baseline s ystolic BP<140 mm Hg and baseline diastolic BP<90mm Hg, 78% 
(220/282) experienced treatment -emergent hypertension; 49% (139/282) developed Stage 1 
hypertension (defined as systolic BP≥140 mm Hg or diastolic BP≥90 mm Hg) while 29% 
developed Stage 2 hyperten sion (defined as systolic BP≥160 mm Hg or diastolic BP≥100 mm 
Hg). In 164 patients with  Stage 1 hypertension at baseline, 64% (66/164) developed Stage 2 
hypertension.   No patients discontinued due to AEs of hypertension, although 6 (2.2%) patients 
had dose  reductions or interruptions due to the event. None of the hypertension events were fatal.  
 
 
Ocular Toxicity  
Ocular toxicities have occurred in clinical trials of ponatinib . Serious ocular toxicities leading to 
blindness or blurred vision have occurred in ponatinib -treated patients. Conduct comprehensive 
eye exams at baseline and periodically during treatment.  
 
Retinal toxicities including macular edema, retinal vein occlusion, and retinal hemor rhage h ave 
occurred in ponatinib -treated patients  (3%) . In AP24534 -10-201, adv erse events in the more -
general eye disorders SOC included dry eye s (7%), blurred vision (4%), conjunctivitis (3%), eye 
pain (3%), periorbital edema (2%), blepharitis (2%), and cataract  (2%). Other ocular toxicities 
21 were cataracts, glaucoma, iritis, iridocyclitis, and ulcerative keratitis.  
 
Pancreatitis  
Pancreatitis (symptomatic abdominal pain associated with pancreatic enzyme elevation) and/or 
elevations in lipase and amylase are known AEs associated with ponatinib .  Most cases of 
pancreatitis or elevated pancreatic enzymes occur within the first 2 month s of treatment  with 
ponatinib .  The events are generally uncomplicated and reversible and can be managed with a 
brief interruption of treatment and standard medical management .  Almost all patients are  able to 
continue with ponatinib treatment at the same or a reduced dose once the event has improved to 
grade 1 or resolved.   
 
Patients with low -grade (1 or 2) elevation in amylase can be continued without dose reduction 
but should be monitored closely with serial enzyme level determinations.    
 
Check serum lipase every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter or as 
clinically indicated.  Consider additional serum lipase monitoring in patients with  a history of 
pancreatitis or alcohol use. In patients with pancreatitis, d o not consider restar ting ponatinib until  
patients have complete resolution of symptoms and lipase levels are less than 1.5 × ULN.  
 In AP24534 -10-201, treatment -emergent pancreatitis occurred in 7% ( 30/449) of patients  (25; 
5.6% Grade 3). Pancreatitis resulted in treatment int erruption or dose reduction in 6% of patients  
(26/449). One patient discontinued ponatinib permanently due to pancreatitis. Twenty -three of  
29 patients with pancreatitis had resolution of the events within 2 weeks with dose interruption  
or reduction or wit h no change in dose; 2 patients had resolution within 4 days with the dose  
unchanged. The incidence of treatment -emergent lipase elevation was 41 % (grade 3 or 4: 18%) . 
Pancreatitis was the DLT from AP24534 -07-101and has been reported in the expanded access  
program . 
 
Hemorrhage  
Hemorrhagic events have been reported with ponatinib  (mostly in leukemic patients with grade 4 
thrombocytopenia) .   
 
Treatment -emergent hemorrhagic events occurred in 25.6% (115/449) of patients, the majority  
(87, 19.4%) of which were  grade 1/2. The most common hemorrhagic events were epistaxis  
(7.1%), petechiae (3.1%), and ecchymosis (2.2%).  
 
In AP24534 -10-201, serious bleeding events were observed in 5 .8% (2 6/449) of patients treated  
with ponatinib, including 5 fatalities  (1 event ea ch of subdural hematoma, traumatic intracranial 
hemorrhage, hemorrhagic gastritis, intracranial hemorrhage, and hemorrhagic cerebral infarction. 
One fatality (hemorrhagic gastritis) was assessed by the investigator as possibly related to 
ponatinib . The inc idence of serious bleeding events was higher in patients with accelerated 
phase -CML, blast phase -CML, and  Ph+ALL. The most commonly reported serious bleeding 
events included: gastrointestinal hemorrhage, subdural hematoma (3 patients each, 0.7%); 
cerebral hemorrhage, hemorrhoidal hemorrhage, retroperitoneal hematoma, epistaxis, post -
procedural hemorrhage, traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, gastric hemorrhage (2 patients each, 
0.4%). Three patients had their doses reduced or interrupted due to single events each of ear 
hemorrhage, gingival bleeding, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Two patients had study drug 
22 discontinued following single events each of cerebral hemorrhage and intracranial hemorrhage. 
Interrupt ponatinib  for serious or severe hemorrhage  and evalu ate 
 
Fluid Retention  
Ponatinib is  associated with edema and occasionally serious fluid retention.  Patients should be 
weighed and monitored regularly for signs and symptoms of fluid retention.   An unexpected 
rapid weight gain should be carefully investigat ed and appropriate treatment provided.   Interrupt, 
reduce the dose of, or discontinue ponatinib according to the recommendations for non -
hematologic toxicity.  
 
One or more fluid retention AEs occurred in 125 (27.8%) patients in this study. The most  
common events were peripheral edema (16.7%), pleural effusion (7.6%), and pericardial effusion  
(3.8%).  In AP24534 -10-201, serious fluid retentio n events were observed in 4% (1 8/449) of 
patients  treated with ponatinib. One instance of brain edema in a blast phase -CML patient with 
post-craniotomy  was fatal. Serious fluid retention events in more than 1 patient included: pleural 
effusion  (6/449), pericardial effusion (6 /449, 1%), and ascites (2/449, <1%).   In most cases, 
patients were able to continue ponatinib therapy without dose reductions or interruptions. 
Ponatinib was discontinued for three  patients, due to pericardial effusion in two, and pleural 
effusion in one. 
 
Cardiac Arrhythmias  
Supraventricular  tachyarrhythmias have been reported in p atients treated with ponatinib. 
Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias occurred in 5% (25/449) of ponatinib -treated patients. A trial 
fibrillation was the most common supraventricular tachyarrhythmia and occurred in 20 pa tients.  
All patients with serious atrial  fibrillation had risk factors, confounding events, or both.  The 
other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias were atrial flutter (4 patients), supraventricular 
tachycardia (4 patients), and atrial tachycardia (1 patient) . For 13 patients, the event led to 
hospitalization.  Three patients (0.4%) died due to cardiac arrest. One was assessed as related to  
ponatinib. This patient had a history of sinus bradycardia and left bundle branch  block; the 
cardiac arrest followed a 2 -day history of severe diarrhea and dehydration. The  second patient 
had a past history of MI and died in the setting of an AMI and lobar pneumonia.  The third patient 
had pleural effusions and pulmonary hypertension.  One patient discontinued therapy due to 
grade 3 atrial fibrillation that was considered related to treatment.  Advise patients to report signs 
and symptoms of rapid heart rate (palpitations, dizziness).  
 
Symptomatic bradyarrhythmias hav e also been reported.  Symptomatic bradyarrhythmias that led 
to a requirement for pacemaker implantation occurred in 1% (3/449) of ponatinib treated 
patients. The cardiac rhythms (1 case each) identified were complete heart block, sick sinus 
syndrome, and atrial fibrillation wi th bradycardia and pauses.  Advise  patients to report signs and 
symptoms suggestive of slow heart rate (fainting, dizziness, or chest  pain).   
 
In AP24534 -07-101, SAEs of atrial fibrillation were reported in 7% of patients, with none  
considered treatment related. No cardiac arrest was reported in that trial.  
 
Prolonged QTcF  
A QT assessment was performed in 39 patients with cancer who received 30 mg, 45 mg, or 60 
23 mg ponatinib once daily. No large changes in the mean QTc interva l (i.e.,  > 20 ms) from baseline 
were detected in the s tudy. However, a small increase in the mean QTc interval (i.e., < 10 ms) 
cannot be excluded because of study design limitations.  If a prolongation of QTcF is observed, it 
is important to perform serum electroly te analysis (including potassium, calcium, and 
magnesium) and correct any significant abnormalities with supplements if below normal limits.  
It is also necessary to review all concomitant medications and discontinue medications that are 
known or suspected  to cause QT prolongation.  
 
If no contributing reason is identified and the reason for QTcF prolongation is believed to be due 
to ponatinib, dose interruption and reduction guidelines for general non -hematologic toxicities 
should be followed.  Additionally , weekly ECG monitoring is recommended for 4 weeks upon 
resumption of study drug, then monthly for 6 months, and then every 3 months for the remainder 
of the study, or more frequently as clinically indicated.  Echocardiogram and ECG results for all 
sites wi ll be reviewed by the lead investigator at The Ohio State University  (OSU) . 
 
Myelosuppression  
Neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia have all been commonly reported either together or 
individually in leukemia patients treated with ponatinib .  Ponatinib has not been studied in solid 
tumor patients and whether (or to what extent) myelosuppression will occur in these patients is 
unknown.   While myelosuppression can occur any time during treatment, its onset most 
commonly occurs within the first month on tre atment.  
 
Obtain complete blood counts every 2 weeks for the first 3 months and then monthly or as 
clinically indicated, and adjust the dose as recommended.  
 
In AP24534 -10-201, grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression, reported as an AE, occurred in 52% 
(262/449) of patients treated with ponatinib. The most commonly reported grade 3/4 
myelosuppression AEs were platelet count decrease ( 43.9%), neutrophil count decrease ( 24.9%), 
febrile neutropenia (5.1%) and anemia ( 22.3%). The incidence of these events was gr eater in 
patients w ith advanced disease than in patients with CP -CML  and patients frequently 
experienced multiple occurrences of these events. . SAEs of myelosuppression events occurred in 
10% of patients, with  febrile neutropenia and decreased platelet cou nt the 2 most common SAEs, 
in 3% of patients  each.  In AP24534 -10-201, decreased platelet count led to the discontinuation of 
17 patients,  making i t the most common AE leading to discontinuation. Most patients who 
experienced  grade 3 or 4 decreased platelet  count had their first occurrence within the first 3 
months of  treatment. Most patients recovered from decreased platelet counts with dose 
interruptions or  reductions or with no change to the regimen.  
 
In AP24534 -07-101, the incidences of AEs of myelosuppr ession were similar overall , with 
incidences of SAEs of febrile neutropenia and decreased platelet count were  slightly higher, in 
15% and 5% of patients, respectively.  Myelosuppression events were reported as SAEs in the 
expanded access program . 
 
 
Compromi sed Wound Healing and Gastrointestinal Perforation  
Based on  the mechanism of action, ponatinib could potentially compromise wound healing. 
24 Interrupt ponatinib for at least 1 week prior to major surgery. The decision when to resume  
ponatinib after surgery should be based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing.  
Serious  GI perforation (fistula) was observed in one patient 38 days post -cholecystectomy in  
AP24534 -10-201. No formal studies of the effect of ponatinib on wound healing have been 
conducted.  
 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
Two patients (<1%) treated with ponatinib in AP24534 -10-201 developed serious tumor  lysis 
syndrome  (TLS) . Both cases occurred in patients with advanced  CML. Hyperuricemia occurred 
in 7% (304/449) of patients; the majority had CP CML (19 patients). TLS is likely  specific to 
patients with CML and is unlikely in the solid tumor patients .  
 
Constitutional Symptoms/Joint Pain  
Certain constitutional symptoms such as  myalgia, arthralgia, headache, weakness, fatigue, 
asthenia , and low grade fe ver have been commonly reported with ponatinib.  These  symptoms 
have  been reported mainly at the initiation of treatment,  are typically short lived (<2 weeks) , and 
are seldom, if ever, reported beyond the first month of treatment.  These AEs are most 
commonly low grade ( grade 1 and 2) and are self -resolving without the need for dose 
interruption or dose reduction when they do occur.   Most patients can be maintained on the 
current dose of ponatinib, uninterrupted , and their symptoms can be managed with a short course 
of oral analagesics , corticosteroids, and/or anti -pyretics as clinically indicated.   If dose 
interruption is indicated, patients can resume the same dose of ponatinib typically without 
recurrence of s ymptoms once the original episode has improved or resolved.  
 
Embryo -Fetal Toxicity  
Although no studies have been conducted, ponatinib may cause fetal harm, and women who are  
pregnant should be prohibited from using ponatinib.  Ponatinib showed embryo -fetal toxicity in 
rats at exposures lower than human exposures at the recommended human dose.  Advise women 
to avoid becoming pregnant while taking ponatinib.  
 
Overdosage  
 
Overdoses with ponatinib  were reported in clinical trials.  One patient was accidentally 
administered the entire contents of a bottle of study medication via nasogastric tube. The 
investigator estimated that the patient received 540 mg of Iclusig. Two hours after the overdose, 
the patient had an uncorrected QT interval of 520 ms. Subsequent ECGs  showed normal  sinus 
rhythm with uncorrected QT intervals of 480 and 400 ms. The patient died 9 days after the 
overdose from pneumonia and sepsis. Another patient accidentally self -administered 165 mg on 
cycle 1 day 2. The patient experienced fatigue and n on-cardiac chest pain on day 3. Multiple 
doses of 90 mg per day for 12 days in a patient resulted in pneumonia, systemic inflammatory 
response, atrial fibrillation, and a moderate pericardial effusion.  
 
In the event of an overdose, stop ponatinib, observe the patient and provide appropriate 
supportive treatment.  
 
Ponatinib use in specific populations  
25  
Pregnancy  
Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, ponatinib can cause fetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman. Ponatinib was studied for effects on embryo -fetal 
development in pregnant rats given oral doses of 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg/day during organogenesis. 
At the maternally toxic dose of 3 mg/kg/day (equivalent to the AUC in patients receiving the 
recommended dose o f 45 mg/day), ponatinib caused embryo -fetal toxicity as shown by increased 
resorptions, reduced body weight, external alterations, multiple soft tissue and skeletal 
alterations, and reduced ossification. Embryo -fetal toxicities also were observed at 1 mg/k g/day 
(approximately 24% the AUC in patients receiving the recommended dose) and involved 
multiple fetal soft tissue and skeletal alterations, including reduced ossification.  There are no 
adequate and well -controlled studies with ponatinib in pregnant wome n. Advise women to avoid 
becoming pregnant while taking  ponatinib. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the  patient 
becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to 
a fetus.  
 
Pediatric Use  
The safet y and efficacy of ponatinib in patients less than 18 years of age have not been 
established.  
 
Nursing  
It is unknown whether ponatinib is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious 
adverse reactions in nursing infants from ponatinib, a decision should be made whether to 
discontinue nursing or to discontinue ponatinib, taking into account the importance of the drug to 
the mother.  
 
Geriatric use  
One hundred and fifty -five of 449 patients (35%) in the CML clinical trial of ponatinib  were 65  
years of age and over. For ty-six percent of patients ≥ 65 years had  vascular occlusion events. 
Patients of age ≥ 65 years are more likely to experie nce adverse reactions including vascular 
occlusion, decreased platelet count, peripheral edema, increased l ipase, dyspne a, asthenia, 
muscle spasms, and decreased appetite. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be 
cautious, refl ecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, ren al, or cardiac function, and of 
concomitant disease or other dr ug therapy.  
 
Hepatic Impairment  
The Mass -Balance study (AP24534 -11-104) confirmed that ponatinib elimination in humans 
primarily occurs via the liver . AP24534 -12-109, Phase -1 study compared the PK of 30 -mg 
ponatinib in subjects with chronic hepatic impairment with those of matched healthy subjects. 
The study was designed as open -label, single -dose, parallel -group, and nonrandomized. Eighteen 
subjects w ith hepatic impairment (6 each in Child -Pugh categories A, B, and C, corresponding to 
mild, moderate, and severe impairment, respectively) were matched to 9 healthy subjects . The 
study demonstrated that ponatinib or metabolite AP24600 exposure appeared to be comparable, 
albeit slightly higher, in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh A)  compared to 
healthy subjects. In contrast, lower plasma exposures of ponatinib and AP24600  were observed 
in subjects with either moderate or severe hepatic impai rment (Child -Pugh B and  C, 
26 respectively) relative to healthy control subjects.   PK data alone do not suggest the need for a 
starting dose adjustment for ponatinib in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. 
No clinically meaningful differences were observed in ponatinib PK in subjects with chronic 
hepatic impairment compared to matched healthy subjects. Ponatinib should be used with 
caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.  
 
 
Renal Impairment  
Although renal excretion is not  a major route of elimination, ponatinib has not been studied in 
patients with renal impairment. The potential for moderate or severe renal impairment to affect 
hepatic elimination has not been determined . 
 
 
2.3 Rationale  
 
The FGF -FGFR signaling pathway plays a critical role in regulating physiologic 
processes such as embryogenesis, angiogenesis and cell survival. FGFR  genes are proto -
oncogenes and their activation secondary to genomic alterations such as gene amplification, 
chromosomal translocation, and point  mutation can mediate the development and growth of 
cancers.1 A rapidly expanding list of cancers with genomic FGFR alterations is provided in 
Table 1.  Therefore, inhibition of the FGF -FGFR signaling pathway presents a viable therapeutic 
strategy for multiple malignancies. In addition to their role in inhibiting ang iogenesis and 
tumorigenesis, FGFR inhibitors can also ameliorate resistance to other therapies. Inhibition of 
FGFR has been demonstrated to overcome resistance to endocrine therapy in patients with breast 
cancers.31 They  have also been shown to enhance sensitivity of resistant tumors to 
chemotherapy.32 FGFR inhibitors are purported to be an effective therapeutic option for relapsed 
tumors that have been treated previously with EGFR or VEGFR inhibitors due to secondary 
FGFR activation.11  
Currently FGFR inhibitors, both selective and non -selective are being evaluated as cancer 
therapies . Several  small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have been studied, and they 
share characteristics as ATP -competitive VEGFR2 inhibitors due to structural similarity of 
VEGFR and FGFR kinase domains.  However, potential toxicities associated with pan -
FGFR/VE GFR inhibition have  also led to monoclonal antibodies targeting specific FGFRs (e.g. 
IMC -A1 (Imclone), R3Mab (Genentech)).33, 34 Preclinical as well as early clinical studies have 
demonstrated that genomic FGFR alterations predict sensitivity and response to the use of FGFR 
inhibitors.  Guagnano et al. have shown that genetic alterations in FGFR predict sensitivity to 
BGJ398 (Novartis) , a selective pan -FGFR inhibitor.35  Currently, BGJ398  is being evaluated in a 
Phase 1 study for patients with advanced solid tumors harboring amplifications ( FGFR1/2 ) or 
mutations ( FGFR3 ).36 Dovitinib (TKI258, Novartis), a combined FGFR and VEGFR inhibitor, 
has recently been shown to be effective in patients with FGFR 1 amplified adv anced breast 
cancers.37 Similarly, FGFR2  amplification in gastric cancers predicted sensitivity to selective 
FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 (AstraZeneca)  38, and this agent is being investigated in a phase -2 trial 
in patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma with FGFR2  polysomy or amplification39, 40. 
We propose to evaluate ponatinib ( Takeda ), a pan -FGFR inhibitor, in patients with any 
cancer histo logy and  molecular eligibility with defined genomic FGFR  alterations. Ponatinib is 
FDA approved for the treatment of CML and Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL ) for 
27 whom no other tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy is indicated .25 In addition to BCR -ABL, 
it is also a potent inhibitor of FGFR family members and other kinases including KIT, RET, 
PDGFR α, and FLT3  Gozgit et al.  have shown ponatinib to be more potent (1 to 2 log scale) than 
previous FGFR inhibitors with activity across multiple FGFRs (FGFR 1 -4) and types of genomic 
alterations.17 Also, ponatinib has been shown to have activity against secondary gatekeeper 
mutations that mediated resistance in tyrosine ki nases (e.g. T315I in BCR -ABL; T670I in KIT).25 
We and others (Gozgit et al.)  have shown that ponatinib produces a robust, dose -dependent, 
growth inhibition across multiple cancer cell lines h arboring FGFR  alterations, compared to wild 
type FGFR, supporting these findings. We hypothesize that activating genomic FGFR 
alterations predict response to ponatinib.  In addition, we hypothesize that activating genomic 
alterations in KIT, RET, PDGFRα , ABL1, FLT3  will predict response to ponatinib given the 
activity of this drug in preclinical studies.  
To evaluate this, we propose a single arm phase -2 study of ponatinib in  patients with any 
cancer histology and  molecular eligibility with activating FGFR  alterations (amplifications, 
mutations, translocations) as well as KIT, PDGFRα ,  FLT3, RET, ABL1  alterations. While 
enrollment of multiple tumor subtypes facilitates accrual rate of patients with genetic FGFR  
alterations as these are rare , importantly,  we can assess whether tumor subtypes with FGFR  
alterations would indeed respond to FGFR inhibition.  For instance, BRAF  mutant colon cancers 
did not show sensitivity to BRAF inhibition as melanomas with similar mutation.41 This was 
demonstrated to be due to EGFR -mediated reactivation of MAP kinase pathway, and combined 
EGFR and BRAF inhibition was able to improve response.42 As yet, no tumor specific context 
for FGFR response has been recognized and our trial could help ascertain if there is any.  Further, 
we can compare  primary non -responders versus responders to identify additional pathways that 
render patients resistant to FGFR inhibition despite the  presence of an FGFR alteration.  As stated 
previously, ponatinib has also been demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of o ther kinases altered 
in can cers including PDGFR α, FLT3, RET, ABL1 and KIT.43, 44 Therefore, we plan to evaluate 
the activity of ponatinib in cancers that harbor genomic alterations in these kinases as a separate 
cohort.

4. REGISTRATION PROCEDU RES  
 
4.1 General Guidelines  
 
Eligible patients will be entered on study centrally at the The Ohio State University .  OSU 
patients will be registered by the OSU Clinical Research Specialist/Coordinator.  External 
participating site  patients  will be registered by the OSU Multi -Site Coordinator.  External sites 
should alert the Multi -Site Coordinator by e -mail or phone as soon as a potential patient is 
identified for screening.  The required registration forms can be found in the protocol 
Supp lemental Forms packet . 
 
Following registration, patients should begin protocol treatment within 5 business days. Issues 
that would cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Principal Investigator.  If a 
patient does not receive protocol therapy f ollowing registration, a written explanation 
documenting the reason for delay will be required before proceeding with therapy. The Multi -
Site Coordinator should be notified of any cancellations as soon as possible.   The patient’s 
registration may be cancel led, pending approval by the Principal Investigator who will determine 
whether the patient will be replaced.  
 
32 4.2 External Participating Site Registration Process  
 
External participating site  patients will have eligibility verified and will be centrally regist ered at 
The Ohio State University by the OSU Multi -Site Coordinator. Participating sites  should call or 
email the OSU Multi -Site Coordinator to verify enrollment availability prior to consenting 
patients . 
 
Following registration, patients should begin prot ocol treatment within 5 business days . Issues 
that may cause treatment delays should be discussed with the OSU Principal Investigator and 
OSU Multi -Site Coordinator as soon as possible. The OSU Multi -Site Coordinator must be 
notified immediately if  a patie nt does not receive protocol therapy.  
 
Only patients deemed eligible by the participating site  research team should be submitted for 
eligibility verification and registration by the OS U Multi -Site Coordinator.  
 
To request patient registration, the  documents  below must  be completed by the participating site 
research team  and faxed  to the OSU Multi -Site Coordinator .  The OSU secure e -mail system 
may be used, if needed.  Contact the OSU Multi -Site Coordinator for more information.  Regular 
e-mail must  not be used to send patient registration documents.  
 
Required documents for registration:

 Source documents for every r equired screening item as listed in the Protocol 
Calendar. Screening tests must be within the specified window.  
 Other signed and dated documents used as source documentation  
 
 
The OSU Multi -Site Coordinator will  confirm receipt of the registration documents with the 
participating site contact listed on the Enrollment Form.  If confirmation is not received within 2 
hours, it is strongly recommended that the participating site call the OSU Multi -Site Coordinator 
to confirm registration documents were received.   
 
Registration requests wil l be processed as soon as possible and no later than 1 business day after 
receipt of the registration documents, pending there is no additional information needed to 
complete eligibility verification.  Registration will occur upon OSU confirmation that the  patient 
meets eligibility criteria.   
 
The Multi -Site Coordinator will securely email the participating site  contact listed on the 
Enrollment Form with the registration confirmation and the patient’s assigned study number.  
 
 
 
33 5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Agent Adminis tration  
 
Ponatinib  would  be administered as a single agent at  a starting dose of  45 mg oral once 
daily on an outpatient basis.  In clinical trials involving CML and ALL the starting dose 
of ponatinib  was 45 mg administered orally once daily. However, 59% of the patients 
required dose reductions to 30 mg or 15 mg once daily during the course of therapy. The 
optimal dose of ponatinib in solid tumors has not been identified.   All subjects should 
receive a copy of the Ponatinib Medication Guide (Appendix D). 
 
Reported adverse events and potential risks are described in Section 7 . Appropriate dose 
modifications are described in Section 6 .  Details regarding administration of study 
drugs are detailed in Section 8 . No investigational or commercial agents or therapies 
other than those described below may be administered with the intent to treat the 
patient's malignancy. The patient will be requested to maintain a medication dia ry of 
each dose of medication.  The medication diary will be returned to clinic s taff at the end 
of each course.  
 
Ponatinib at a dose of 45 mg should  be taken orally once daily with or without food for a 
28 day cycle.  Tablets should be swallowed whole.  Patients should not crush or diss olve 
the tablets.  Continue treatment as long as the patient does not show evidence of disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity  (Section 5.3) .    
 
 
Patients treated with ponatinib are recommended to have concomitant thrombo -
prophylaxis with ASA (81 or 3 25 mg daily ), if tolerated . Patients with documented 
allergy to aspirin do not require an alternate agent and are still eligible. ASA should be 
held when platelets drop to 75000 or below.  
 
5.2 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
 Aspirin, at a dose of 81mg once daily, should be taken orally beginning on the first day of 
ponatinib administration as a prophylactic for hypertension.  Aspirin should be 
discontinued when ponatinib is discontinued , unless a clinical indication suggests 
otherwise.  
 
 Nausea/Vomiting – prophylactic pre -medications are not planned as ponatinib is not 
highly emetogenic. However, if patients experience nausea during a treatment cycle, anti -
emetics may be used per institutional guidelines.  
 
 Cytopenias – prophylact ic growth factor s (e.g. G-CSF,  erythropoietin) are not permitted , 
however, if patients require admission for fever and neutropenia and the treating 
physician feels that the administration of growth factors may  be beneficial then they can 
be given according  to ASCO guidelines.  Use of recombinant e rythropoietin is not 
allowed . Platelets and red cell transfusions can be given as necessitated.  
34  
 Short courses (up to a maximum of 3 weeks ) of oral corticosteroids intended to treat 
study treatment related rash or diarrhea are allowed. Oral steroids should be used with 
caution and subjects monitored for steroid -induced hyperglycemia.  
 
 Loperamide or lomotil  is recommended for supportive care of diarrhea.  
 
 The use of bisphosphonates for skeletal metastasis is permitted . 
 
Because there is a low potential for interaction with other concomitantly administered 
drugs through the cytochrome P450 system, the case report form must capture the 
concurrent use of all other drugs, over -the-counter medicati ons, or alternati ve therapies. 
The Principal Investigator should be alerted if the patient is taking any agent known to 
affect or with the potential to affect selected CYP450 iso -enzymes.  
 
5.3 Duration of Therapy  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event (s), treatment may continue until one of 
the following criteria applies:  
 
 Disease progression,  
 
 Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
 
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
 
 Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or  
 
 General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable 
for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
 
5.4 Duration of Follow Up  
 
Patients will be followed every 3 months for 52 weeks  after removal from study or until death, 
whichever occurs first , in order to document time of progression (if patient did not progress 
while on study), survival, and to document subsequent alternate therapy received .  Patients 
removed from study for unacceptable adverse event (s) will be followed un til resolution or 
stabilization of the adverse event.  
 
5.5 Criteria for Removal from Study  
 
Patients will be removed from study when any of the criteria listed in Section 5.3  applies.  The 
reason for study removal and the date the patient was removed must be d ocumented in the Case 
Report Form.  
 
Patients must be discontinued from the trial in the e vent of myocardial infarction,  stroke, 
35 development or progression of arterial disease necessitating revascularization , or other vascular 
occlusive events . 
 
6. DOSING DELA YS/DOSE MODIFICATION S 
 
6.1 Dose Modifications for Ponatinib  
A maximum of two ponatinib  dose level reductions are allowed.  If a third dose level reduction is 
required, treatment will be permanently discontinued . The starting dose for ponatinib is 45 mg 
oral daily.   
 
Patients who experience a vascular (arterial or venous) occlusive event should be immediately 
discontinued from the study and ponatinib should not be restarted.  For serious reaction s other 
than arterial or venous occlusion, do not restart  until the serious event has resolved . 
 
Dose Modifications  
Dose Level  Ponatinib Dose /Schedule  
0 45 mg daily

Dose Modification for Nausea  
Nausea and vomiting are reported with ponatinib .  The use of an antiemetic prophylactically is 
not recommended.  However, if a patient is symptomatic, appropriate antiemetic medications 
may be used as clinically indicated.

Dose Modifications for Hepatic Toxicity  
Hepatotoxicity, most commonly manifested by reversible transaminase and alkaline phosphatase 
elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, has been observed in patients taking ponatinib.  Monitoring of 
hepatic funct ion is recommended and management of laboratory abnormalities should be 
managed with dose interruption and/or dose reduction according to  the dose modification table.

Dose Modifications for Myelosuppression  
 
While myelosuppression can occur any time during treatment, its onset most commonly occurs 
within the first month on treatment.  Ponati nib has not been studied in solid tumor patients and 
whether (or to what extent) myelosuppression will occur in these patients is unknown.

Dose Modifications for Hemorrhage  
Concomitant use of ponatinib with anticlotting agents should be approached with caution in  
patients who may be at risk of bleeding events. Serious bleeding events, including fatalities have 
been reported in patients treated with ponatinib.  Most  hemorrhagic events, but not all, occurred 
in patients with grade 4 thrombocytopenia . Interrupt ponatin ib for serious or severe hemorrhage

Dose Modifications for Pancreatitis / Lipase Elevations  
Pancreatitis (symptomatic abdominal pain associated with pancreatic enzyme elevation) and/or 
elevations in lipase and amylase are known AEs associated with ponatinib .  Most cases of 
pancreatitis or elevated pancreatic enzymes occur within the first 2 month s of treatment  with 
ponatinib .  Patients with low -grade (1 or 2) elevation in enzymes  can be continued without dose 
reduction but should be monitored closely with serial enzyme level determinations.   Patients can 
continue  with ponatinib treatment at the sa me or a reduced dose once the event has improved to 
grade 1 or resolved.  See below  for dose -modification guidelines.

Dose Modifications for Skin Rash  
Skin rashes have been commonly reported in patients taking ponatinib.  The vast majority of the 
skin events are nonserious, either self -limiting or manageable with antihistamines or topical 
steroids, and do not result in discontinuation.  In more severe cases, a short course of oral 
corticosteroids may be used unt il the rash has improved or resolved.  In patients treated with 
ponatinib , the most common skin manifestation s are a diffuse maculo papular rash that is non -
pruritic or an acneiform dermititis.  Occasionally, patients treated with ponatinib have been 
reporte d to have a dry, flaky or exfoliative type of rash or psoriasiform dermatitis.  Rarely, an 
erythema multiforme type of rash has been associated with ponatinib.

Guidelines for Supportive Care of Rash  
Type of Care  Action  
Prevention/Prophylaxis  
  Avoid unnecessary exposure to sunlight.  
 Apply broad -spectrum sunscreen (containing titanium dioxide 
or zinc oxide) with a skin protection factor (SPF) ≥15 at least 
twice daily.  
 Use thick, alcohol -free emollient cream ( e.g., glycerin e and 
cetomacrogol cream) on dry areas of the body at least twice 
daily.  
Symptomatic Carea 
  Pruritic lesions:  Cool compresses and oral antihistamine 
therapies.  
 Fissuring lesions:  Monsel’s solution, silver nitrate, or zinc 
oxide cream.  
 Desquamation:  Thick emollients and mild soap.  
 Paronychia:  Antiseptic bath, local potent corticosteroids in 
addition to antibiotics; if no improvement, consult 
dermatologist or surgeon.  
 Infected lesions:  Appropriate bacterial/fungal culture -driven 
systemic or topical antibiotics.  
41 Guidelines for Supportive Care of Rash  
Type of Care  Action  
a Patients who develop rash/skin toxicities should be seen by a qualified physician and should 
receive evaluation for symptomatic/supportive care management.  
 
 
Dose Modifications for Hypertension  
 
Patients receiving ponatinib  have experienced hypertension and blood pressure should be 
monitored at each visit . In subjects with an initial BP reading within the hypertensive range, a 
second reading should be taken at least 2 minute s later, with the two readings averaged to obtain 
a final BP measurement . The averaged value should be recorded in the eCRF.  
For patients who develop HTN or worsening HTN during study treatment, antihypertensive 
medication should be initiated or optimized to achieve target blood pressure before interruptio n 
or dose reduction of the study treatment at the discretion of the investigator.  If hypertension is 
persistent despite adequate anti -HTN therapy includ ing titration of anti-HTN medication or 
introduction of additional an ti-HTN medications, or if grade 4 HTN develop s, dose interruption,  
reduction  or discontinuation  is recommended . Patients with prior history of hypertension (on 
anti-hypertensive agents) should monitor/record their BP at home while on ponatinib therapy.  
Patients will be provided with a diary to record their at -home assessments.  
 
Patients will obtain blood pressure assessments twice per week at home, using a blood pressure 
cuff supplied by Takeda for purposes of the research study.  Any reading within the hypertensive 
range will be confirmed in clinic.  
 
 
Event  Management Guideline  Dose Modification  
Definitions used in the table:  
- Persistent hypertension :  Hypertension detected in two separate readings during up to three 
subsequent visits.  
- Well -controlled hypertension:   Blood pressure of SBP ≤140 mmHg and DBP ≤90 mmHg in 
two separate readings during up to three subsequent visits.  
- Symptomatic hypertension :  Hypertension associated with symptoms ( e.g., headache, light -
headedness, vertigo, tinnitus, episodes o f fainting) that resolve after the blood pressure is 
controlled within the normal range.  
- Asymptomatic hypertension : SBP >140 mmHg and/or DBP >90 mmHg in the absence of 
the above symptoms.

Dose Modifications for Ocular Toxicity  
Ocular toxicities have occurred in clinical trials of ponatinib. Serious ocular toxicities leading to 
blindness or blurred vision have occurred in ponatinib -treated patients . Patients are required to 
have a standard ophthalmic exam performed by an ophthalmologist at baseline and as clinically 
warran ted. The exam will include indirect fundoscopic examination, visual acuity (corrected), 
visual field examination, tonometry, and direct fundoscopy.  
 
Retinal toxicities including macular edema, retinal vein occlusion, and retinal hemorrhage have 
occurred i n ponatinib -treated patients.

Dose Modifications for reduced  left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ). 
Severe congestive heart failure (CHF) and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction have been reported 
in patients taking ponatinib. Patients should be monitored carefully for  signs or symptoms 
consistent with cardiac failure.  ECHOs must be performed at regular intervals  as outlined in the 
Study Calendar.  The same procedure ( either ECHO or MUGA, although ECHO is preferred) 
should be performed at baseline and at follow -up visit(s).  Consider discontinuation of ponatinib 
in patients who develop serious CHF.

with strong CYP3A inhibitors  (e.g., boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, 
indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, 
ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole).  Patients taking concomitant strong 
inhibitors may be at increased risk for adverse reactions.  
 
 
7. ADVERSE EVENTS  AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS :  LIST AND REPORTING 
REQUIREMENTS  
 
Expected adverse events include the adverse reactions that have at least possible relationship to 
ponatinib and are considered expected in ponatinib clinical studies . To mitigate the inherent risks 
in clinical studies of ponatinib, patients should be  monitored closely  while receiving treatment.  
A list of AEs ( Section 7.2 ) for ponatinib is listed.  
 
 
 
 
 
7.1 Definitions  
 
7.1.1   Adverse Event  
 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
47 relationship with the treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product whether or not considered related to the medi cinal product. Any worsening of 
a preexisting condition, which is temporally associa ted with the us e of the study drug (ie, occurs 
after the first dose of study drug), is also an AE.  
 
AEs include:  
 
 Abnormal test findings  
 Changes in physical examination findings  
 Other untoward medical events, regardless of their relationship to the study d rug, such as 
injury, events that require surgery, accidents, or apparently unrelated illnesses  
 Hypersensitivity  
 
Additionally, AEs may include signs or symptoms resulting from:  
 
 Drug overdose  
 Drug withdrawal  
 Drug abuse  
 Drug misuse  
 Drug interactions  
 Drug dependency  
 Exposure in utero  
 
7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
 
The Investigator will determine the seriousness of an AE based on the following.  
An AE is considered a SAE if at least one (1) of the following conditions applies:  
 
 Death : An AE that results in dea th is any patient death within 30 days of the last dose of  
study drug administration. The cause of death or AE that resulted in a fatal outcome is  the 
SAE.  
 
 Life-threatening AE : An AE that places the patient, in the view of the Investigator or  
Takeda , at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (ie, this does not include 
an event that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death).  
 
 Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to  
conduct normal life functions is defined as any substantial disruption of a person’s ability  
to conduct normal life functions.  
 
 Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization : Hospitalization  
refers to admission of a patient into a hospital for any length of time.  
 
48  A congenital anomaly/birth defect : A fixed, permanent impairment established at or  
before birth.  
 
 Overdose : Any AE associated with an overdose of study drug. An overdose of study  drug 
is defined as an occurrence of administered dose exceeding that which is prescribed  by 
the investigator per protocol.  
 
 Important medical event : Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in  
determining whether an event is an important medical event. An important medical event  
may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization. However, if it is  
determined that the event may jeopardize the patient and/or may require intervention to  
prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above, the importa nt medical  
events should be reported as serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in  
an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or  
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or the development of drug d ependency  
or drug abuse.  
 
AEs reported from clinical trials that require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
are considered serious. Any initial admission (even if less than 24 h ours) to a health care facility 
meets these criteria. Adverse e vents that require emergency room care that do not result in 
hospital admission are not SAEs unless assessed by the investig ator to be an important medical 
event. Hospitalization does not include the following:  
 Hospice facilities  
 Respite care  
 Skilled nursi ng facilities  
 Nursing homes  
 Routine emergency room admissions  
 Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedure)  
 
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating AE is not in 
itself a SAE. Examples include:  
 Social admission (eg, patient has no place to sleep)  
 Protocol -specified admission during a clinical trial (eg, for a procedure required by the  
trial protocol)  
 Optional admission not associated with a precipitating AE (eg, for elective cosmetic  
surgery that was planned prior to study enrollment [appropriate documentation is  
required for these cases])  
 
 
7.1.3 Abnormal Test Findings  
 
Test results meeting ≥ grade 3 CTCAE v4 criteria will be reported to the principal investigator 
and will be reported as  adverse events.  
 
7.2 Adverse Reactions for Ponatinib  
 
49 The following adverse events and reactions described in this section can be found described in 
further detail in the prescribing information for ponatinib.  
 
 Vascular  Occlusion   
 Heart  Failure   
 Hepatotoxici ty 
 Hypertension   
 Pancreatitis   
 Neuropathy   
 Ocular  Toxicity   
 Hemorrhage   
 Fluid  Retention   
 Cardiac  Arrhythmias   
 Myelosuppression   
The adverse events described in this section were identified in a single -arm, open -label, 
international, multicenter trial in 449 patients with CML or Ph+ALL who disease was 
considered to be resistant or intolerant to prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy 
including those with the BCR -ABL T315I mutation.  All patients received a starting dose of 45 
mg ponatinib once daily.   At the time of analysis, the median duration of treatment with 
ponatinib was 337 days in patients with CP -CML, 362 days in patients with AP -CML, 89 days 
in patients with BP -CML, and 81 days in patients with Ph+ ALL.  The median dose intensity 
was 37 mg o r 83% of the expected 45 mg dose.  The events  of arterial  ischemia,  cardiac  failure,  
and peripheral  neuropathy  reported  in the tables below  include  data from  an additional  13 
months  of follow -up (median  duration  of treatment  CP-CML:  672 days,  AP-CML:  590 days,  
BP-CML:  89 days,  Ph+ ALL:  81 days).  
Adverse reactions reported in more than 10% of all patients  treated  with ponatinib  in this trial are 
presented  in the table  below . Overall,  the most  common  non-hematologic  adverse  reactions  (≥ 
20%)  were  hypertension,  rash,  abdominal  pain,  fatigue,  headache,  dry skin,  constipation,  
arthralgia,  nausea,  and pyrexia.

53 7.3 Adverse Event Characteristics  
 
 CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Ad verse Events (CTCAE) version 
4.0 will be utilized for AE  reporting.  All appropriate treatment areas should have access 
to a copy of the CTCAE version 4 .0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4 .0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP web site 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
If the AE is not defined in the CTCAE, the Investigator will determine the severity of the 
AE based on the following definitions:  
 
Mild (Grade 1) : The AE is noticeable to the patient, but does not interfere with routine  
activity. The AE does not require discontinuing adminis tration or reducing the dose of the 
study drug.  
 
Moderate (Grade 2) : The AE interferes with routine activ ity, but responds to 
symptomatic therapy or res t. The AE may req uire reducing the dose, but not 
discontinuing administration of the study drug.  
 
Severe (Grade 3) : The AE significantly limits the patie nt’s ability to perform routine 
activities despite symptomatic therapy. In addition , the AE leads to di scontinuing 
administration or reducing the dose of the study drug.  
 
Life Threatening (Grade 4) : The AE requires discontinu ing administration of the study 
drug. The patient is at immediate risk of death.  
 
Death (Grade 5) : The patient dies as a direct result  of the complication or condition 
induced by administration of the study drug.  
 
 Attribution  of the AE:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
 
The Investigator must provide attribution for all AEs (serious and non-serious).  In addition, if the 
investigator determines a Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ) is associated with trial procedures, the 
investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and on the SAE form, 
and report such an assessment in accordance wi th the SAE reporting requirements.  
 
7.4 Exchange of Safety Information  
 
a) From The Ohio State University  to Takeda : 
 
 Serious adverse events, as defined in FDA regulations 21 CFR 312.32 are to  be reported 
54 to Takeda  or Takeda ’s designee no later than at time of  submission to the FDA per the 
time frames outlined in 21 CFR 312.32.   
 OSU  will provide a copy of any aggregate safety reports which have been submitted by 
the institution to the appropriate regulatory authorities in accordance with Applicable 
law, within 7 calendar days.  
 Reports of pregnancies in female subjects and female partners of male subjects and 
pregnancy outcomes  will be promptly provided to Takeda (no more than 10 calendar 
days after PI awareness).  
 Study i nstitution will promptly respond to Takeda  queries on SAE  and make available 
Medical Records or Study Data as Takeda  may deem necessary to investigate and/or 
report on an adverse event.  
 Reports of non -serious adverse events will be routinely collected during the course of the 
trial in an appropria tely configured  database and provide d to Takeda  with dedicated 
outputs.  
 Provide Takeda  with a list of any / all events within a reasonable timeframe of Takeda ’s 
request to support Takeda ’s management of the product safety profile (e.g. investigation 
of a p otential new signal) . 
 Submit a final study report to Takeda , to include, when applicable, a list of all adverse 
events and special situation reports, when available, but within no more than 1 year of 
study completion. If study involves a publication, OSU  will provide draft publication to 
Takeda  at least 1 month prior to submission of final publication . 
 OSU will provide reports of all vascular occlusive events to Takeda  or Takeda ’s designee 
within 2 business days of awareness of the vascular occlusive event.  OSU should expect 
follow -up queries from Takeda  that will need a response. OSU will respond to Takeda  
queries as soon as possible after additional information is known at OSU, or made 
available by external participating sites.   
 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs)  
Vascular occlusive events have been identified as AESIs for ponatinib. These include arterial 
and venous thrombotic and occlusive adverse events that meet the criteria for SAEs (cross -
refer to the section where the serious criteria are described and define d) and those adverse 
events that do not meet the SAE criteria. AESIs require ongoing monitoring by investigators 
and rapid identification and communication by the investigator to the study sponsor. All 
AESIs, whether SAEs or not, must be reported within 2 business days of the study sponsor 
awareness to Takeda . Takeda  has determined that the events listed below (whether considered 
serious or non -serious by investigators) should be considered AESIs:  
A. Myocardial infarction: Defined by t he Third Universal De finition of Myocardial 
Infarction  
B. Angina (newly diagnosed or worsening of existing angina or unstable angina)  
C. Coronary artery disease (CAD) (newly diagnosed or worsening of existing CAD) or 
symptoms that may reflect cardiovascular disease  
D. Cerebrovascular ischemic disease including ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, vascular 
stenosis, transient ischemic accident (TIA), cerebrovascular occlusive disease 
documented on diagnostic neuroimaging, or symptoms that may reflect cerebrovascular 
diseas e  
55 E. New onset or worsening of peripheral artery occlusive disease (eg, renal artery, 
mesenteric artery, femoral artery) or symptoms that may reflect peripheral vascular 
disease  
F. Retinal vascular thrombosis, both venous and arterial  
G. Venous thromboe mbolism where significant compromise of organ function or other 
significant consequences could result (eg, pulmonary embolism, portal vein thrombosis, 
renal vein thrombosis) or symptoms that may reflect venous thrombosis  
 
Takeda  may request additional inf ormation to the study sponsor on observed AESIs and this 
information should be provided in a timely fashion (ie, within 2 business days of the study 
sponsor awarene ss). All serious adverse events  whether “reportable” as defined in this 
protocol or not, mus t be reported to Takeda . All expedited (7/15 day) reports will be sent to 
Takeda  simultaneously or within 24 hours of study sponsor’s submission to the competent 
authorities. Non -expedited SAE reports (except for AESIs) can be batched by the study 
sponsor and sent to Takeda  on a monthly basis. Also, any event of a vascular occlusive nature, 
either serious or non -serious, must be reported to Takeda  within 2 business days of the study 
sponsor’s awareness.

7.5 Serious Adverse Event Reporting Procedures  
 
7.5.1 Serious Adverse Event Reporting Period  
 
The Ohio State University will be solely responsible for reporting serious adverse events to the 
OSU IRB, FDA, and Takeda . Participating sites are only permitted to report directly to OSU and 
must report serious adverse events to the OSU PI and Multi -Site Coordinator within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event. Serious adverse events are to be reported to the OSU IRB (per policy), 
FDA (per 21CFR312.32), and  Takeda  Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance or its designated 
representative beginning from  the time the p atient is first administered investigational product  
56 through and including 30 days after permanent discontinuation of the investigational product.  
Any SAEs occurring any time after the reporting period must be promptly reported to the OSU 
IRB (per policy),  FDA (per 21CFR312.32) and Takeda  Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance or 
its designated representative if a causal relationship to the investigational product is suspected.  
When expedited reporting applies, OSU  will provide Takeda  with the submitted report o f any 
expedited report  concurrent to agency submission (no more than 1 business day/3 calendar days 
after the submission) . 
 
Patients must be followed for all AEs from the date the patient  is first administered 
investigational product  until at least  30 Days  after the End of Treatment, and for all serious or 
study drug -related toxicities until the  AEs are resolved or until patient contact discontinues.  
 
7.5.2 Immediate Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
 
NOTE:  External participating sites  are NOT permitted to repo rt directly to the FDA or 
The Ohio State University Office of Responsible Research Practices  (ORRP [OSU IRB]) . 
All reports must be sent to the OSU Principal Investigator and Multi -Site Coordinator for 
review and submission to the FDA and ORRP.  Sites must a lso report to their IRB 
according to their institutional guidelines.  
 
The Investigator or designee must notify the OSU PI and Multi -Site Coordinator within 24 hours 
of knowledge of an SAE . OSU will then notify the OSU IRB (per policy), FDA (per 
21CFR312.31 ) and Takeda  Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance or its designated representative. 
A complete SAE report using the FDA MedWatch 3500A Mandatory Reporting Form must be 
submitted to OSU within 3 business days.  Additional or follow -up information on a SAE must  
also be reported immediately (ie, within 24 hours of new SAE information ) and on the 
MedWatch 3500A form . Should the FDA , OSU IRB, or Takeda  require additional data on the 
event, the Investigator will be asked to provide those data to OSU in a timely fash ion. 
 
All SAE s should be reported to the OSU IRB using the most current version of the Event 
Reporting Form ( available at http:// go.osu.edu/Buck -IRB) and within time frames outlined in the  
IRB policy . SAEs reported from participating institutions will be reported to the IRB by the 
Multi -Site Coordinator. Participating institutions are responsible for reporting to their local IRB 
per their institutional guidelines.  
 
7.5.3 Information to be Provided by the Investigator for a Serious Adverse Event  
 
SAEs are to be reported using the FDA MedWatch 3500A Mandatory Reporting Form.  
Information  abou t the SAE that must be provided includes (refer to the SAE Cover Sheet in the 
Supplemental Forms packet ): 
 
 Investigato r identification  
 Patient identification (eg, study assigned sequence ID ) 
 Information on study drug and concomitant therapies (eg, start/stop date, dose and 
frequency of study drug)  
 Description of event  
57  Severity of the SAE  
 Relationship of the SAE to the study drug , the patient’s disease, or other contributing 
factors  
 Outcome of the SAE  
 
7.5.4 Follow -up information on a Serious Adverse Event  
 
Appropriate diagnostic tests should be performed and the rapeutic measures, as medically 
indicated, should be instituted. Appropriate consultation and follow -up evaluations should be 
carried out until the event has resolved or is otherwise explain ed by the Investigator. For all 
SAEs, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide inform ation to the OSU PI . In addition, 
an investigator may be requested by the OSU PI to obtain specific information in an exp edited 
manner. This information may be more detailed than that captured on the  SAE form. In general, 
this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to all ow for a  complete medical 
assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality . Information on other 
possible causes such as concomitant medication and illnesses must be provided.  
 
7.5.5 Required Follow -up for Serious Adverse Events  
 
There  should be routine follow -up for 30 days after permanent d iscontinuation of study drug in 
all patients in order to monitor for the occurrence of SAEs. If an  SAE continues after the 30 -day 
evaluation period, then the patient must be followed until the ev ent resolves or stabilizes. The 
medical monitor may specify a longer period of time, if requi red to assure the safety of the 
patient.  
 
7.5.6 Takeda  Responsibility for Expedited Safety Reports  
 
Takeda  will notify investigators of all reportable SAEs. This notification will be in the form of 
an expedited safety report. The OSU Multi -Site Coordinator will distribute safety reports to the 
external participating sites.  Upon receiving such notices, the inv estigator must review and retain 
the notice with other study -related documentation. The OSU PI  and Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The investigator should also 
comply with the IRB procedures for re porting any other safety information.  
Suspected serious adverse reactions and other significant safety issues reported from the study 
shall be reported to the relevant competent health authorities in all concerned countries according 
to local regulations ( either as expedited safety reports and/or in aggregate reports), by Takeda  or 
its designated representative.  
 
7.5.7 Pregnancy and other safety issues  
 
Females of childbearing potential and fertile males will be informed as to the potential risk of 
conception whi le participating in this study and will be advised that they must use effective 
contraception during the dosing and for a period of at least 4 months  thereafter. A pregnancy test 
will be performed on each pre -menopausal female of childbearing potential prior to the first dose 
of study drug. A negative pregnancy test must be documented prior to administration of study 
drug.  
58  
If a patient is confirmed pregnant during the trial, study drug administration must be 
discontinued immediately. Information regardi ng a pregnancy must be immediately forwarded to 
the OSU PI, who will report the information to Takeda  Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance or its 
designated representative.  OSU will n otify Takeda  of any pregnancy (patient or partner) while on 
drug (no more th an 10 calendar days after PI awareness).  
 
The Investigator must immediately report follow -up information to Takeda  Drug Safety and 
Pharmacovigilance  regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal 
outcome, regardless of whether the patient has discontinued participation in the study. If the 
pregnancy results in the birth of a child, additional follow -up information may be requested. If 
the pregnancy results in spontaneous abortion or stillbirth, the event should be reported as an 
SAE . Pregnancy outcomes must be collected for the female partners of any males who took 
study drug in this study. Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes 
should be obtained from the female partner.  
 
7.5.8 Adverse error monitoring and report ing  
 
Adverse effects related to ponatinib will be monitored using a custom database and aggregate 
reports of AE (including type, CTCAE grade,  duration,  attribution  and outcome ) will be reported 
to the OSU DSMC, per policy.  
 
OSU will n otify Takeda  of any safety findings that the PI determines may impact the 
risks/benefits of the drug (no more than 1 business day/3 calendar days after determination).  
 
7.5.9 Data safety monitoring plan  
 
Continuous evaluation of safety, data quality and data timeliness w ill be carried out. The PI  will 
conduct continuous review of data and patient safety at their regular disease group meetings (at 
least monthly) and the discussion will be documented in the minutes. The PI of the trial will 
review toxicities and responses of t he trial where applicable at these disease group meetings and 
determine if the risk/benefit ratio of the trial changes. Frequency and severity of adverse events 
will be reviewed by the PI and compared to what is known about the agent/device from other 
sources; including published literature, scientific meetings and discussions with  Takeda , to 
determine if the trial should be terminated before completion.  
 
Serious adverse events and responses will also be reviewed by the OSUCCC –James Data and 
Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). The PI will also submit a progress report ( quarterly ) that 
will be reviewed by the committee per the DSMC plan. All reportable serious adverse events will 
also be reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of record as pe r the policies of the IRB.  
 
A mandatory monthly trial and safety review teleconference will be held for all participating 
sites. It will be expected that representatives from all participating sites be present for each call. 
Meeting minutes will document t he attendance and discussions. Safety related information and 
data completion status will be minimally reviewed each month.

9. BIOMARKER AND  CORRELATIVE  STUDIES  
 
Integral  
The primary hypothesis of the correlative component is that genomic alterations in 
FGFR (as well as KIT, RET, PDGFRα , ABL1 and FLT3)  predict sensitivity and response to 
ponatinib . To corroborate the hypothesis, patients will have mandatory research biopsie s and 
tumor  sequencing  to detect genomic alterations in these genes as well as the rest  of the exome 
and t ranscriptome.  Research biopsies and genomic sequencing are supervised and carried out in a 
companion tissue collection study, OSU precision study (OSU -13053 /2013C0152 ), PI: 
Roychowdhury) , or University of Michigan precision study  (HUM00055952 , Determining 
feasibility of dissemination of molecular profiling data to patients with cancer. IRB 
FWA00004969), PI: Dr. Arul Chinnaiyan . These IRB approved tissue collection and cancer 
profiling studies enroll  eligible patients who have advanced or refractory metastatic cancer , to 
undergo mandatory tumor  biopsy, integrated sequencing , bioinformatics analysis, and return of 
clinically significant sequence result s to the treating oncologists and patients . An outline of the 
Precision Cancer Study process is shown in Figure 2 . Importantly, the study includes CLIA -
certified gene testing for  the top ~200 cancer genes so that these results can be utilized for 
clinical -decision making such as trial eligibility. Patients with targetable molecular alterations 
can subsequently be treated with agents that target the respective genomic alterations.  
The pilot version of the Precision Cancer Study opened at University of Michi gan’s 
Comprehensive Cancer Center in April 2011, under the direction of Dr. Roychowdhury and Dr. 
Chinnaiyan, and has enrolled 200 adult patients with advanced cancer to date.45 The success rate 
for tumor biopsy was 89%, and there we re no significant procedural complications (expected 
complic ation rate is <1 %).46, 47 Therefore, the Precision Cancer Study would screen and identify 
candidate patients with tumors that harbor activating genomic alterations in FGFR  (mutations, 
amplifications, fusions) or other genomic alterations ( KIT, RET, PDGFRα , ABL1  and FLT3 ) for 
the Phase 2 ponatinib therapeut ic trial.  OSU -13053 has been enro lling up to 4 metastatic cancer 
patients (any histology) every 2 weeks, scaling to 4 every week later this spring.  To enable a 
clinically pertinent and feasible approach we use a CLIA -certified customized cancer gene panel 
(220 genes) that captures targetable genetic alterations such as point mutations (e.g. BRAF  
V600E mutation), copy number variations (e.g. ERBB2  ampl ification) and gene fusions (e.g. 
ALK). In addition, patients will also undergo parallel “ research sequencing ” that entails whole 
“exome” and “transcriptome” sequencing.    
A similar precision study is in place at University of Michigan (MI -ONCOSEQ / 
HUM0006 7928 ; PI- Arul Chinnaiyan) that supervises  research tumo r biopsies,  genomic 
sequencing strategies, and return of results .  This study would screen and identify patients with 
tumors that harbor activating genomic alterations in FGFR  (mutations, amplificatio ns, fusions) 
and other genomic alterations ( KIT, RET, PDGFRα , ABL1  and FLT3 ), and is mandatory  for 
enrollment into the trial at University of Michigan (sub -site).   
61  
Integrated  
Patients who have activating genomic alterations in FGFR, KIT, RET, PDGFRα , 
ABL1 or FLT3 would be treated with ponatinib until disease progression. Eligible patients can 
undergo repeat tumor biopsies at the time of disease progression, and their tumors would be 
subjected to genomic (exome and transcriptome) and proteomic (RPPA) analysis and compared 
with pre -treatment analyses to evaluate for candidate mechanisms of resistance.  
 
      
Figure -2: Precision cancer study process is shown. Patients with advanced or refractory metastatic 
cancer would undergo tumor biopsy and integrat ing sequencing. Patients with targetable alterations can 
subsequently be enrolled in trials that target the respective genomic alterations.  
 
 
9.1 Collection of Specimens  
 
Biospecimens will be collected at the beginning of the study. Consent and tissue managem ent is 
supervised by the OSU Precision Cancer Study ( OSU -13053, PI: Roychowdhury).  Biospecimens 
included in this protocol may be fresh, frozen or fixed. Biospecimens may be collected through 
The Ohio State University outpatient and inpatient facilities. Ge nerally, most procedures will 
occur through the Department of Radiology (Interventional procedures). However, some 
procedures could occur through other areas such as dermatology (skin biopsy) or operating 
rooms (undergoing a standard of care procedure that  is anticipated to yield excess tissue). 
Previously collected tissue blocks, can also be used for sequencing. For complete details, please 
refer to the Precision Cancer Study protocol  (OSU -13053) . The Precision Cancer Study uses a 
secure Custom D atabase /LIMS  to catalog, store, and track specimens.  
 
9.1.1  Blood and Tissue Procurement:  
 
A) Blood  

62 Where possible , blood samples will be drawn from patients scheduled to have venipuncture for 
routine clinical purposes. When this is not possible, blood draws will occur at times other than 
those needed for routine clinical care. Generally, blood draws for research purposes will be 4 
tablespoons of blood (amounts to 4 -5 10mL tubes). Exception includes patient with 
hematological malignancies who require leukapher esis procedure as part of their routine clinical 
care, the leftover leukapheresis product may be collected and banked for the study  
Blood Processing: Generally, the processing and storage of blood samples will involve the 
following: blood will be drawn int o one or more tubes that contain EDTA, heparin or citrate for 
the collection and stored as serum, white blood cells or whole blood. To preserve patient and 
donor confidentiality, samples are given a specimen ID number. Serum and white blood cells 
will be s eparated from other cellular components by centrifugation, allocated into tubes, 
catalogued, and frozen at –80° C or viably in liquid nitrogen freezers. Samples may be processed 
for DNA, RNA, and/or protein.  
  
B) Buccal smear  
Buccal smears are a source of  normal tissue for comparison to tumor samples. Three buccal 
smears will be obtained at the time of diagnosis or at routine follow -up evaluations. Samples are 
given a specimen ID number.  
Buccal Smear Processing: Swabs will be processed for nucleic acid and /or protein and stored at -
20° C or -80° C respectively.  
 
C) Previously collected and processed biospecimens  
Fixed or frozen specimens may also be obtained from participants. In some cases, patients 
referred to The Ohio State University clinics with a can cer diagnosis from outside hospitals will 
bring hematoxylin and eosin stained slides for routine review by pathologists. To preserve 
patient and donor confidentiality, samples are given a specimen identification number which will 
be entered into the sample  database. Authorized study personnel will contact the institution 
where tissue was already obtained and request the appropriate sample. A copy of the informed 
consent will be provided to such institutions to allow release of the tissue or cut slides for 
research purposes. To preserve patient and donor confidentiality, samples are given a specimen 
ID (generated in Custom Database/LIMS ) which will be entered into the sample database.  
 
D) Tumor tissue biopsy  
Tumor tissue or fluids will be collected from pati ents through the least invasive approach. 
Patients will receive informed consent detailing risks and benefits of the specific procedure. The 
list of possible procedures includes but is not limited to: percutaneous needle biopsy (liver, lung, 
breast, soft t issue mass), lymph node biopsy, bone marrow biopsy and aspirate, thoracentesis for 
pleural fluid and paracentesis for peritoneal fluid. When patients undergo tumor biopsy, they will 
receive a routine clinical consent as provided by the health care professi onal who performs the 
procedure. Generally, this will be staff from the Department of Radiology. This consent process 
will describe the procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives.  
 
Tissue Biopsy Processing. Freshly excised tissue will be placed in OCT me dium and frozen 
immediately at -80 C. An H&E slide will be prepared for review by an OSU pathologist. To 
preserve patient and donor confidentiality, samples are given a specimen ID number. Patients 
who have progression of their cancer may choose to be re -consented for additional tissue 
63 procurement including tumor biopsy and other samples. This is subject to the same eligibility 
and consent requirements.  
 
Some clinical sites may not be completing pretreatment tumor biopsy due to resource limitations. 
These s ites will provide the most recent archival tumor specimen available.  
 
9.2 Laboratory Correlative Studies  
 
Genome and Transcriptome Sequencing  
 
Pretreatment t umor biopsy or archival specimen will undergo sequencing would as 
part of the OSU Precision Cancer Study  (OSU -13053), a companion study to this trial. This  
study supervises collection of research tumor biopsies /archival specimens , germline tissue 
collection (blood, buccal swabs), genomic sequencing strategies, and return of results . This study 
shares data and samples for patients who subsequently participate in a therapeutic study such as 
this Phase 2 ponatinib trial. An integrative sequencing strategy, clinical and research would be 
utilized for this study. C linical sequencing would be performed in CL IA-certified lab 
(Roychowdhury Lab) for a custom cancer panel of 220 genes . Research sequencing includes 
whole exome and transcriptome sequencing (RNASeq) of tumor to identify potentially 
informative mutations, amplifications, or gene fusions  to evaluate f or biomarkers of sensitivity 
and mechanisms of resistance . The custom can cer panel includes assessment of both DNA and 
RNA for 220 oncogenes (including FGFR1 , FGFR2 , FGFR3 , and FGFR4 ) and tumor 
suppressors and is designed to detect point mutations, copy nu mber changes, and gene fusions. 
The list of genes is shown in Figure 3.  
A similar study is in place at University of Michigan (MI -ONCOSEQ / 
HUM00067928 ; PI- Arul Chinnaiyan) that supervises  collection of research tumo r 
biopsies /archival specimens , genomic s equencing strategies, and return of results .  This study 
would screen and identify patients with tumors that harbor activating genomic alterations in 
FGFR  (mutations, amplifications, fusions) and other genomic alterations ( KIT, RET, PDGFRα , 
ABL1  and FLT3 ) for enrollment at University of Michigan.  
 CLIA  Sequencing : Targeted gene sequencing is accomplished by solution -based 
hybridization capture with custom baits (Agilent) of both tumor (biopsy  or archival specimen ) 
and normal DNA (Blood). This is used to generate somatic point mutations and copy number 
changes using published tools (Varscan2, MuTect)45, 48. Targeted gene sequencing from RNAseq 
libraries is utilized to identify gene fusions involving FGFRs and analyzed using published 
fusion tools (Tophat2, Chimerscan)49, 50. All sample collection, processing, sequencing, and 
analysis will be completed i n Dr. Roychowdhury’s CLIA -certified lab.  
 
 Research Sequenc ing: For research sequencing, we would  use Agilent’s SureSelect 
whole exom e capture and Illumina’s TruSeq RNA protocols to prepare libraries for sequencing as 
previously described.45 Libraries will be submitted to a vendor for sequencing on an Illumina 
HiSeq2000 instrument (Beijing Genomics Institute). Bioinformatic s analysis will be performed 
in the lab to derive annotated singl e nucleotide variation, copy number alterations, and gene 
expression using existing tools as previously described (Exome: BWA, Varscan2, MuTect; 
RNAseq: Tophat2, Cufflinks) .45

Reverse Phase Protein Assay (RPPA)  
 
In addition to genome and transcriptome sequencing we wo uld also perform RPPA to assess 
protein expression and modifications that characterize canonical pathways in cancers. This assay 
will be run at MD Anderson Cancer Center RPPA -Functional Proteomics  Core Facility.  
Sections of the OCT embedded core biopsies /archival tumor specimens  will be evaluated by a 
pathologist to verify tumor content.  Tissue will then be cut out of the OCT and protein will be 
extracted using standard methods.  The protein will be denatured, diluted and arrayed on 
nitrocellulose coated s lides.  The slides will be probed with a set of over 200 validated antibodies 
and spot density determined by MicroVigene software.  Samples will be normalized for protein 
loading and concentrations will be determined using the Super Curve Fitting program.  
Supervised and un -supervised hierarchical clustering analysis will then be performed.  Some of 
the proteins of interest that are included in this assay are; PI3KCA, total and phosphorylated 
forms of Akt, mTOR, Cyclin D1, ERK, MEK, p70 -S6 kinase etc. RPPA data at the time of 

65 disease progression to ponatinib would be compared with data prior to treatment with ponatinib 
to evaluate for putative mechanisms of resistance to FGFR targeting.  
 
Data Integration : Using the exome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing , and RPPA, we can  
systematically characterize candidate mechanisms of resistance in the FGFR pathway at the time 
of disease progression with ponatinib.  Putative changes of interest would likely include splice 
variants in FGFR, increased FGFR gene expressi on, point mutations or copy number variation in 
FGFR signaling pathways (PI3 -kinase or MAP  kinase).  
 
 
9.3 Specimen Storage and Disposal  
 
Specimens will be stored in designated and secure facilities at The Ohio State University. The 
Precision Cancer Study uses a secure Custom D atabase /LIMS  to catalog, store, and track 
specimens. The Study stores specimens in monitored and locked freezers tha t are in a secure 
facility.  
Generally, frozen tissue will be stored in secured -80ºC freezers. Storage and retrieval of fixed 
and paraffin embedded specimens will be handled using routine procedures of the Pathology 
Department affiliated with the hospital at which the specimen was collected. Disposal of 
biospecimens will be considered under certain circumstances including but not limited to 
reduced specimen integrity, exhausted capacity or insufficient funds for long -term maintenance 
or storage of low prior ity biospecimens. Determination of the integrity and priority of 
biospecimens is at the discretion of study personnel. The discarding of research specimens is also 
subject to any institutional policy and the informed consent under which the specimen was 
obtained.  
  
9.4 Sites Performing Correlative  Studies  
 
 Integrated sequencing analysis (exome and transcriptome sequencing) would be performed at 
The Ohio State University (Dr.Roychowdhury Lab) and University of Michigan (Dr.Arul 
Chinnaiyan’s Lab). Methodologies f or exome and transcriptome sequencing are identical.  
 
 The RPPA assay will be performed by MD Anderson Cancer Center RPPA -Functional 
Proteomics Core Facility.  
 
 
9.5 Potential risks and procedures for minimizing risks  
 
9.5.1 Risks of blood draws  
 
 All blood draws will  be performed by trained personnel that use standard sterile 
techniques.  Infection is unlikely since stringent aseptic techniques are followed during all 
venipuncture procedures.  
 
9.5.2 Risks of biopsy   
 
66  The risks of this study relate primarily to the risk of a biopsy. In general, these 
procedures are associated with a small risk of pain, bleeding, infection, and damage to adjacent 
organs.  The magnitude of this risk depends somewhat up on the site of the procedure.  Potential 
risks according to site are:  
 
Risks  of core breast biopsy : 
 Likely: local discomfort and minor bleeding.  
 Less likely: moderate or major bleeding, need for blood transfusion, 
hospitalization due to bleeding or other complications, infection, pneumothorax, 
damage to adjacent organs.  
 
Risks of  skin/chest wall punch biopsy : 
 Likely: local discomfort and minor bleeding.  
 Less likely: moderate or major bleeding, or infection  
 
Risks of lymph node or soft tissue core needle biopsy : 
 Likely: local discomfort and minor bleeding.  
 Less likely: moderate o r major bleeding, need for blood transfusion, 
hospitalization due to bleeding or other complications, infection, pneumothorax, 
damage to adjacent organs.  
 Additional risks may be present if i.v. conscious sedation is required.  
 
Risks of liver core needle bi opsy : 
 Likely: local discomfort and minor bleeding  
 Less likely: moderate or major bleeding, need for blood transfusion, 
hospitalization due to bleeding or other complications, infection, bowel 
perforation or damage to adjacent organs  
 Additional risks may be  present if i.v. conscious sedation is required.  
 
Lung biopsy core needle biopsy : 
 Likely: local discomfort and minor bleeding  
 Less Likely: moderate or major bleeding, need for blood transfusion, lung 
collapse, hospitalization due to bleeding or other complications, infection, damage 
to nearby organs, allergic reaction to the numbing medicine  
 
Bone Marrow Biopsy:  
 Likely: local discomfort and minor bleeding  
 Less Likely: Nerve injury, blood collection at the site  
 
In order to minimize the risk of a biopsy, only qualified personnel will perform these procedures.  
Prior to the procedure, the physician performing the procedure will discuss the risks with each 
study participant, answer any questions, and obtain separate  procedure consent.  For biopsies of 
lesions that are not superficial and clearly palpable, imaging studies such as CT, ultrasound, or 
MRI will be used to guide the biopsy in order to minimize the risk of damage to adjacent 
structures. After lymph node bio psies, patients will be observed for approximately 2 hours (range 
2-4 hours) after the procedure, or per institutional standard guidelines.  After liver biopsies, 
67 patients will be observed for approximately 4 hours (range 4 -6 hours) after the procedure, or  per 
institutional standard guidelines.  Less than the goal quantity of tissue is acceptable for each type 
of biopsy, and will be left to the clinical judgment of the physician performing the procedure.   
 
All grade 3 or 4 events attributable to any of the  study procedures will be reported to the 
Principal Investigator within 24 hours of occurrence.  Adverse events will be reported by the PI 
to the IRB consistent with standard procedures.   
 
9.5.3 Anesthesia Risk  
 
Risks of local anesthesia  
 
All biopsy procedures require local anesthesia using lidocaine, xylocaine, or related compounds.  
There is a small risk of an allergic reaction associated with these drugs.  
 
In order to minimize the risk of local anesthesia, only qualified personnel will perform the biopsy 
procedure.  Patients will be queried if they have had previous allergic reactions to local 
anesthetics.   
 
Risks of intravenous conscious sedation  
 
Certain biopsy procedures, such as lymph node or liver biopsies, may require intravenous 
conscious sedation (IVC S).  IVCS is a minimally depressed level of consciousness that retains 
the patient’s ability to maintain a patent airway independently and continuously and respond 
appropriately to physical stimulation and verbal commands.  
 
The risks of intravenous conscious sedation include: inhibition of the gag reflex and concomitant 
risk of aspiration, cardiopulmonary complications (myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, 
hypoxemia), and allergic reactions to the sedative or analgesic medications.  These risk s are 
small but real; for example, in a prospective study of 14,149 patients undergoing IVCS during 
upper gastrointestinal endoscopies, the rate of immediate cardiopulmonary events was 2 in 1000. 
The 30 -day mortality was 1 per 2,000 cases.  In this study, there was a strong association 
between lack of monitoring and use of high -dose benzodiazepines with adverse outcomes.  There 
was also an association between the use of local anesthetic sprays to the oropharynx and the 
development of pneumonia.  
 
In order to  minimize the risk of intravenous conscious sedation, only qualified personnel will be 
responsible for conscious sedation as per institutional protocols.  A minimum of two individuals 
will be involved in the care of patients undergoing conscious sedation —the physician performing 
the biopsy procedure, and the individual (M.D. or R.N.) who monitors the patients and his/her 
response to both the sedation and the procedure, and who is capable of assisting with any 
supportive or resuscitative measures.  The room where the procedure utilizing IVCS takes place 
will have adequate equipment to provide supplemental oxygen, monitor vital signs, and maintain 
an airway should this be necessary.  An emergency cart will also be immediately accessible to 
the room where the p rocedure is to take place, and emergency support services will be available 
on page.  Patients will be screened and evaluated for their fitness to undergo conscious sedation 
68 by a trained physician. Following the procedure, patients will be observed closely  in the recovery 
room according to standard institutional guidelines.  
   
9.5.4 Risk of imaging studies  
 
Some biopsy procedures require imaging studies, either to plan or guide the procedure.  Imaging 
studies that may be used in obtaining tissue samples include CT scans and ultrasound.  CT scans 
will expose study participants to controlled amounts of radiation.  The total dose of radiation 
from these tests is not anticipated to cause any adverse effects.  There is also a risk of an allergic 
reaction to the intrav enous contrast dye used during CT imaging, as well as a risk of 
experiencing feelings of anxiety or claustrophobia while undergoing a CT scan.  There are no 
anticipated risks with the use of ultrasound.  
In order to minimize these risks, patients will be qu eried, as per standard institutional practice, 
regarding their history of reactions to intravenous contrast dye.  If a patient has had such a 
reaction, she/he will be premedicated, or dye will not be used, as per standard institutional 
practice.  If a pati ent has previously experienced anxiety or claustrophobia while undergoing a 
CT scan, anxiolytics may be considered as indicated.  
  
69 10. STUDY CALENDAR  
 
Baseline evaluation must be conducted within 2 week s prior to start of ponatinib therapy.  
Imaging studies  must be done <4 weeks prior to the start of therapy. In the event that the 
patient’s condition is deteriorating, laboratory evaluations should be repeated within 48 hours 
prior to initiation of the next cycle of therapy.   Appropriate delays in study treatment  or 
procedures are allowed to adjust for holidays or weekends.  Each cycle is 28 days.

progress while on study), survival, and to document subsequent alternate therapy received. For 
patients with resoluti on of toxicity to protocol therapy , telephone follow -up is permitted . 
  
 
11. MEASUREMENT OF EFFEC T 
 
11.1 Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re-evaluated for response every 8 weeks.  In 
addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained 8 weeks following initial 
documentation of objective response.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by the  revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline 
(version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228 -247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph 
nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
11.1.1  Definitions  
 
Evaluable for toxicity .  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their 
first treatment with ponatinib  
71  
Evaluable for objective response.   Only those patients who have measurable disease 
present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease 
re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response.  These patients will have their 
response classified accor ding to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit 
objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 wi ll also be considered 
evaluable ) 
 
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response .  Patients who have lesions present at baseline 
that are  evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at 
least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered 
evaluable for non -target disease.  The response assessment is based on the presence, 
absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
11.1.2  Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease .  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥20 mm by chest 
x-ray or as ≥10 mm with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam.  All tumor 
measurements must be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area may be considered 
measurable.   
 
Malignant lymph nodes.   To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non -measurable.  
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) 
since they are, by definition, simple cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be consid ered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -
cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
72 lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the long est diameter), be representative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself 
to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be 
measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -
nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baselin e sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, 
then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used 
as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable 
dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions a re not required, but 
the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow -up.  
 
11.1.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to  characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
 
Clini cal lesions   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm diameter as 
assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  If CT scans have 
slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be 
twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body 
scans).   
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved  in MRI, which 
73 greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the 
technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimiz ed for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at 
follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of th e RECIST 
guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scan s.  Body  scans 
should be performed with breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
 
PET-CT  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurement s.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interch angeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over 
time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which 
may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 
Ultrasound   Ultrasound  is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their 
entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it 
cannot be gua ranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one 
assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the 
study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised.  If there is concern about radiation 
exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biop sies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 
Tumor markers   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper nor mal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered 
in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published 
[JNCI  96:487 -488, 2 004; J Clin Oncol  17, 3461 -3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  26:1148 -1159, 
2008].  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -125 
progression criteria which are to be integrated with objective tumor assessment for use in 
first-line trials in ov arian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534 -1535, 2000].  
 
Cytology, Histology   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where kno wn residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
74 The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease is mandatory to differentiate b etween response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
FDG -PET  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis 
of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive FDG -
PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD.  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow -up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal 
FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing 
site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, thi s 
is not PD.  
c. FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy 
in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or 
scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be prospectively  
described in the protocol and supported by disease -specific medical literature for the 
indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false 
positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
 
Note:   A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
11.1.4  Response Criteria  
 
11.1.4.1.  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline s um diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative i ncrease of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  
the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  
 
75 Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
 
11.1.4.2.  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesi on(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  
should not normally trump targ et lesion status.  It must be representative of overall 
disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion 
of the treating physician should prevail in such circums tances, and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal 
Investigator).  
 
11.1.4.3.  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until dise ase progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.

11.1.5  Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recor ded) until the first 
date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time me asurement criteria are first met 
for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as  reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
11.1.6  Progression -Free Survival  
 
PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or 
death, whichever occurs first. 
 
77 11.1.7  Response Review  
 
All responses will be reviewed by an expert(s) independent of the study at the study’s 
completion.  Simultaneous review of the patients’ files and radiological images will 
occur.  
 
 
 
 
 
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
 
12.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
With the advent of genomic profiling and targeted therapies, focusing on patients with a specific 
target (or genomic alteration) of interest regardless of disease type or histology is a new 
paradigm that cancer research is beginning to adopt. This is a Pha se-2, “basket”  study for 
patients with advanced cancers (stage 4, any histology) who have disease progression w ith at 
least one prior regimen, identified with predefined genomic alterations.  Two separate cohorts 
will be accrued in parallel, defined by geno mic FGFR , as well as KIT, PDGFRα , ABL1, RET, 
and FLT3  alterations.  
Cohort A  will consist of patients identified with activating mutations or fusions in FGFR  as well 
as patients with FGFR  amplifications . 
Cohort B will consist of patients identified with rar e gene targets ( KIT, PDGFRα , RET, ABL1, 
and FLT3 alterations ) for whom there may be downstream targeting and efficacy associated with 
ponatinib.  
Our goal is to assess efficacy outcomes in these two cohorts when treated with ponatinib.  
 
(a) Definition of primary outcome/endpoint:  
The primary endpoint for each of the cohort in this study is overall response . Overall response is  
defined as the number of patients who achieve any response in the first 6 cycles of treatment.  All 
eligible patients, selected by a CLIA approved assay, who have re ceived at least one dose of  
ponatinib  will be evaluable for response.  Response for tumors would be assessed using the 
RECIST 1.1 criteria (using CT scans or calipers by clinical exam) wh ere response will be 
defined as a partial or complete response.   
 
 (b) Definition of secondary outcomes/endpoints:  
-Toxicity is defined as adverse events that are classified as either possibly, probably, or definitely 
related to study treatment per NCI CTCAE v4.0  
-Overall survival is defined as the time from treatment initiation to death.  
-Progression -free survival defined as the time from treatment initiation to progression or death  
 
12.2 Analysis of Primary  Objectives  
 
Cohort A : FGFR  mutations , fusions or amplifications  
 
78 This cohort will utilize a two -stage Simon minima x phase II study design. In the 
relapsed/refractory setting for the multiple eligible  disease types who have an FGFR  mutation , 
fusion or amplification  given the targeted nature of this regimen  and preliminary data that 
support its u se in those with FGFR  mutations, fusions  or amplifications , a true ORR  of at least 
20% would be considered promising in this patient population.  Therefore, this study is designed 
to detect an ORR of at least 20% vs. the null hypothesis that the true ORR is at most 5%, 
representing a response by chance alone.  Based on preclinical data, we expect that those with 
FGFR  amplification may not be as susceptible to the targeting effects of ponatinib as those with 
FGFR  mutatio n/fusions. We also expect that those patients identified with FGFR  amplifications 
will be much more prevalent than those identified with FGFR  mutations/fusions. To 
accommodate the possible confounding scenario of ac cruing a large majority of FGFR 
amplifica tion only patients vs. mutations/fusions, we will stratify accrual, with planned 
enrollment of an equal number of FGFR  amplification only and of FGFR mutation/fusion 
patients.  Also, no more than 10 patients would be enrolled for a specific tumor type.  
 
 
Decision Rule:  The largest response rate where this treatment regimen would be considered 
ineffective in this population is 5%, and the smallest response rate that would warrant subsequent 
studies with this proposed regimen  in this patient population is 20 %. The following two -stage 
Simon minimax phase II study design requires a maximum of 30 evaluable patients to test the 
null hypothesis that the true response rate is at most 5%.  
 Constraining the Type I error rate to 5% and with at least 80% power, this two -stage Simon 
minimax study design will require 30 evaluable patients to test these hypotheses regarding the 
ORR with ponatinib in this patient population. As described above, to address possible 
confounding that could result from accruing a large majority of FGFR  amplification only 
patients, a subpopulation that may not be as susceptible to the targeting of ponatinib, we will 
restrict accrual of the FGFR amplification only patient s to 15, and accrue 15 patients identified 
as having FGFR mutations/fusions.  No more than 10 patients would be enrolled for a single 
tumor type regardless of FGFR alteration.  
 Under this design, the first stage will enroll 10 evaluable patients.  If we obs erve at least one 
response in the first stage, the study will proceed to the second stage and enroll an additional 20 
evaluable patients. Given the expected greater prevalence rate of the  FGFR  amplification s, we 
expect that it is  not un likely that the firs t 10 patients accrued in this cohort will be all 
amplification only patients. If this is the case and no responses are observed, then we will 
consider this adequate  early evidence that the regimen is not sufficiently active in the FGFR  
amplification only p atients. At this point, we would keep accrual open, but only to the FGFR  
mutation/fusion patients. An interim decision rule would not be implemented in this subgroup of 
patients.  If there are 0 responses in the first  10 all amplification patients, accrual of patients with 
FGFR amplifications would cease. Subsequently, 20 patients would be enrolled and enrollment 
would be restricted to patients with FGFR mutations and fusions.  
 In the final analysis, if we see at least 4 patients who have a response to trea tment out of the 
30 evaluable patients, we will consider this sufficient evidence that this combination regimen has 
promising activity in this patient population. Otherwise, if 3 or fewer patients have a response in 
the first 6 cycles of therapy, we will c onsider this regimen to not be sufficiently active in this 
population.   
 
79 Analysis Plan:  As described above, the proportion of responses for the purposes of this decision 
rule will be calculated out of all eligible patients who receive any treatment. Assum ing the 
number of responses is binomially distributed, 95% binomial confidence intervals will also be 
calculated for the estimate of the proportion of responses.  
 
Cohort B: KIT, PDGFR α, RET FLT3, ABL1  alterations  
 
Design Summary:  As mentioned above, this cohort will consist of patients identified with rare 
gene targets for whom there may still be downstream targeting and efficacy associated with 
ponatinib; these patients will include those identified with KIT, PDGFRα , RET, ABL1, and FLT3  
alterations. Given the variable types of genetic alterations that may be accrued to this cohort in 
addition to the multiple disease types, this cohort will be a pilot evaluation without a 
corresponding formal decision rule. This cohort will be open to accrual for the timeframe that 
Cohort A is open to accrual, with up to a maximum of 15 patients being accrued to this cohort. 
Our analyses for this cohort will be largely exploratory and descriptive, focusing on identifying 
the composition of patients w ho enrolled to this cohort in terms of their genetic alteration and 
disease type along with biomarker evaluations and clinical outcomes. While this cohort does not 
have specific endpoints  associated with it, it provides a mechanism to make ponatinib availa ble 
to those with rare genetic alterations and collects valuable preliminary data for ponatinib single 
agent therapy in the various types of patients who may be enrolled.  
 
 
 
12.3 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
This trial would be conducted at two institutions  to accrue up  to 45 patients across all cohorts: 30  
for Cohort A, and up to 15 for Cohort B. We have a Precision Cancer Study (Ohio State) that 
evaluates a pool of 400 patients per year  with metastatic cancer through research tumor biopsies 
and comprehensive clinical tumor sequencing. From this pool, we would enrich patients with 
FGFR  alterations. We expect to see actionable FGFR alterations in approximately 5% of 400 
patients screened a year (200 this year) with advanced solid tumors with any histology.  Similar 
precision trial is in place at University of Michigan (MI -ONCOSEQ), screening 400 patients a 
year. By combining screening from OSU and UM, we expect to see approximately 40 patien ts 
enrolled per year (5% of 800 screened). Quarterly review of accrual at each site would be carried 
out to identify the number of patients enrolled for therapy. Accrual should be complete in 1 2 to 
18 months.  
 
12.4 Analysis of Secondary Objectives  
 Frequency and  severity of adverse events and tolerability of the regimen will be collected and 
summarized by descriptive statistics.  As per NCI CTCAE v4.0, the term toxicity is defined 
as adverse events that are classified as either possibly, probably, or definitely r elated to study 
treatment. The maximum grade for each type of toxicity will be recorded for each patient, 
and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine toxicity patterns for each of the cohorts 
as well as across cohorts. In addition, we will review al l adverse event data that is graded as 
3, 4, or 5 and classified as either “unrelated” or “unlikely to be related” to study treatment in 
the event of an actual relationship developing. The incidence of severe (grade 3+) adverse 
events or toxicities will be  described. We will also assess tolerability of the regimen through 
80 assessing the number of patients who required dose modifications and/or dose delays. In 
addition, we will capture the proportion of patients who go off treatment due to adverse 
reactions o r even those who refuse further treatment for lesser toxicities that inhibit their 
willingness to continue participation on the trial. All patients who have received at least one 
dose of any of the therapeutic agent will be evaluable for toxicity and toler ability.  
 Overall and Progression Free Survival as time -to-event outcomes.  Kaplan -Meier curves will 
be used to estimate the survival distributions of overall survival and progression -free survival 
for each cohort. Each of these variables is measured from t he date of study registration to the 
date of event (ie, death and/or disease progression) or the date of last follow -up if no event 
has occurred.  
 Clinical benefit rate (CBR) at 6 months. The 6 -month CBR will be calculated by the number 
of patients who hav e achieve a response and/or are progression -free and alive at 6 months 
divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals 
for CBR will be calculated.   
 Correlative  markers will be explored in this trial in relation to clinical outcomes of interest, 
and in particular in relation to the primary endpoint of overall response. Given the limited 
overall sample size as well as the relatively limited expected proportion of responses, these 
analyses will be largely exploratory and hypothesis -generating in nature. Correlative gene 
and protein markers will be summarized univariately in a quantitative manner and also 
summarized by clinical outcome group (e.g. response vs. no res ponse). Graphical analyses 
will be largely used to assess potential patterns and relationships; e.g. side -by-side boxplots 
to assess differences in continuous marker levels between those with vs. without the clinical 
improvement (e.g. response vs. no respo nse). Overall, hypothesis testing will largely be 
avoided given the sample size limitations but we will still obtain important preliminary data 
that can inform future studies and help better understand the mechanisms of this treatment 
regimen in this patie nt population.  
 We would also evaluate and summarize the logistical aspects of the trial, including the rate of 
participation and enrollment of those screened and identified with the eligible genetic 
alterations. Also, of those enrolled, we will characteriz e the composition of the cohorts. 
Disease group -specific outcomes will also be summarized and described, although we will 
not be powered for any formal evaluation within a disease or histology subset. Still, these 
will be used as valuable preliminary data for hypothesis generation and designing future 
trials with this regimen and/or this treatment approach.  
 
12.5 Reporting and Exclusions  
 
12.5.1  Evaluation of T oxicity  
 
All patients would  be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment with 
ponatinib.  
 
12.5.2  Evaluation of R esponse  
 
All patients included in the study must be assessed for response to treatment, even if there 
are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible.  Each patient will be 
assigned one of the following categories:  1) comp lete response, 2) partial response, 3) 
81 stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early 
death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, 
insufficient data).  [Note:  By arbitr ary convention, category 9 usually designates the 
“unknown” status of any type of data in a clinical database.]  
 
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of those 
who received no study medication) should be included  in the main analysis of the 
response rate.  Patients in response categories 4 -9 should be considered to have a 
treatment failure (disease progression).  Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug 
administration does not result in exclusion from the ana lysis of the response rate.  All 
conclusions should be based on all eligible patients.  Subanalyses may then be performed 
on the basis of a subset of patients, excluding those for whom major protocol deviations 
have been identified ( e.g., early death due t o other reasons, early discontinuation of 
treatment, major protocol violations, etc.).

APPENDIX C INFORMATION ON POSS IBLE DRUG INTERACTIO NS 
 
Information on Possible Interactions with Other Agents for Patients and Their Caregivers 
and Non -Study Healthcare Team  
 
The patient ____________________________ is enrolled on a clinical tri al using the 
experimental agent ponatinib . This clinical trial is sponsored by Takeda . This form is addressed 
to the patient, but includes important information for others who care for this patient.   
 
The agent ponatinib  can interact with many drugs that are processed by your liver.  Because of 
this, it is very important to tell your study doctors about all of your medicine before you start this 
study.  It is also very important to tell them if you stop taking any regular med icine, or if you 
start taking a new medicine while you take part in this study.  When you talk about your 
medicine with your study doctor, include medicine you buy without a prescription at the drug 
store (over -the-counter remedy), or herbal supplements su ch as St. John’s wort.  
 
Many health care prescribers can write prescriptions.  You must also tell your other prescribers 
(doctors, physicians’ assistants or nurse practitioners) that you are taking part in a clinical trial. 
Bring this paper with you and k eep the attached information card in your wallet .  These are 
the things that you and they need to know:  
 
Ponatinib  interacts with (a) certain specific enzyme(s) in your liver.  
 The enzyme(s) in question are CYP3A4, CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 . CYP 3A4 is responsible 
for breaking down ponatinib in your liver.   
 Ponatinib  must be used very carefully with other medicines that need these liver enzymes 
to be effective or to be cleared from your system.  
 Other medicines may also affect the activity of these enzymes.   
o Substances that increase the activity of CYP 3A4 (“inducers”) could reduce the 
effectiveness of ponatinib  and should be avoided , while substances that decrease 
this enzyme’s activity (“inhibitors”) could result in high levels of the act ive drug, 
increasing the chance of harmful side effects.  
o Co-administration with drugs that block acid production (e.g. antacids, proton 
pump inhibitors can reduce the absorption of ponatinib . They should be avoided 
unless the  benefit s outweigh the possible  risk. 
 
 You and healthcare providers who prescribe drugs for you must be careful about adding or 
removing any drug in this category.  
 Before you start the study, your study doctor will work with your regular prescriber to 
switch any medicines that are cons idered “strong inducers/inhibitors or substrates of 
CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP 2D6, BCRP , and p -glycoprotein . 
 Your prescribers should look at this web site 
http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis /table.aspx  or consult a medical reference to see 
if any medicine they want to prescribe is on a list of drugs to avoid.   
 Please be very careful!  Over -the-counter drugs have a brand name on the label —it’s 
usually big and catches your eye.  They also have  a generic name —it’s usually small and 
1 
located above or below the brand name, and printed in the ingredient list.  Find the 
generic name and determine, with the pharmacist’s help, whether there could be an 
adverse interaction.   
   Be careful:  
o If you take acetaminophen regularly:  You should not take more than 4 grams a 
day if you are an adult or 2.4 grams a day if you are older than 65 years of age.  
Read labels carefully!  Acetaminophen is an ingredient in many medicines for 
pain, flu, and cold.  
o If you dr ink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit:  Avoid these until the study is over.  
o If you take herbal medicine regularly: Avoid these until the study is over. You 
should not take herbal supplements including, but not limited to, St. John’s wort, 
kava, ephedra (ma huang), gingko biloba, yohimbe, saw palmetto, or ginseng. You 
should abstain from taking any herbal and dietary supplements for at least 2 weeks 
prior to the first dose of the study drug.  
 
Other medicines can be a problem with your study drugs. You sho uld check with your doctor or 
pharmacist whenever you need to use an over -the-counter medicine or herbal supplement.  
Your regular prescriber should check a medical reference or call your study doctor before 
prescribing any new medicine for you.

 INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE DRUG INTERACTIONS  
You are enrolled on a clinical trial using the agent  ponatinib .  This 
clinical trial is sponsored by Ariad Pharmaceuticals. Ponatinib  can 
interact with drugs that are processed by your liver.  Because of this, 
it is very important to:  
 Tell your doctors if you stop taking regular medicine or if you start 
taking a new medicine.  
 Tell all of your prescribers (doctor, physicians’ assistant, nurse 
practitioner, pharmacist) th at you are taking part in a clinical trial.  
 Check with your doctor or pharmacist whenever you need to use 
an over -the-counter medicine or herbal supplement.  
 
  
  Ponatinib  interacts with specific liver enzymes called  CYP3A4, 
CYP2C8, CYP2D6  , and must be used very carefully with other 
medicines that interact with these  enzyme s.  
 Before you start the study, your study doctor will work with your 
regular prescriber to switch any medicines that are considered 
“strong inducers/inhibitors or substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, 
CYP3A or BCRP .” 
 Before prescribing new medicines, your regular pre scribers should 
go to http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx  for a 
list of drugs to avoid, or contact your study doctor.

2 APPENDIX D  PONATINIB  MEDICATION  GUIDE  
Ponatinib - (ponatinib hydrochloride  tablet ), film coated   
Takeda , Inc.  
What is the most important information I should know about ponatinib?  
Ponatinib  can cause serious side effects, including:  
Blood clots or blockage in your blood vessels (arteries and veins). Blood clots or b lockage in 
your blood vessels may lead to heart attack, stroke, or death. A blood clot or blockage in your 
blood vessels can prevent proper blood flow to your heart, brain, bowels (intestines), legs, eyes, 
and other parts of your body. You may need emergen cy surgery or treatment in a hospital. Get 
medical help right away if you get any of the following symptoms:  
 chest pain or pressure  
 pain in your arms, legs, back, neck or jaw  
 shortness of breath  
 numbness or weakness on one side of your body  
 trouble talking  
 headache  
 dizziness  
 severe stomach area pain  
 decreased vision or loss of vision  
Blood clots or blockage in your blood vessels can happen in people with or without risk factors 
for heart and blood vessel disease, including people 50 years of age or  younger. Talk to your 
healthcare provider if this is a concern for you.  
Heart problems. Ponatinib  can cause heart problems, including heart failure which can be serious 
and may lead to death. Heart failure means your heart does not pump blood well enough. 
Ponatinib  can also cause irregular slow or fast heartbeats and heart attack. Your healthcare 
provider will check your heart function before and during your treatment with ponatinib . Get 
medical help right away if you get any of the following symptoms: shortness of breath, chest 
pain, fast or irregular heartbeats, dizziness, or feel faint.  
Liver probl ems. Ponatinib  can cause liver problems, including liver failure, which can be severe 
and may lead to death. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests before and during your 
treatment with ponatinib  to check for liver problems. Get medical help right aw ay if you get any 
of these symptoms of liver problems during treatment:  
 yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes (jaundice)  
 dark "tea -colored" urine  
 sleepiness

7 APPENDIX E COVID -19 PRECAUTIONS  
 
Due to the emerging pandemic for SARS -CoV -2 virus, it has become necessary to enact social 
distancing and limit hospital and outpatient facility interactions and visits for vulnerable patient 
populations. Patients receiving active therapy to control their metastatic cancer are particularly 
vulnerable.  
 
This study involves patients receiving an oral targeted therapy that can either control cancer growth 
(stable disease) and shrink cancer disease (partial or complete responses), there by prolonging life 
and maintaining quality of life. It is vital that these patients continue to receive these therapies, but 
also important that we mitigate the risk of virus transmission for patients, providers, and family 
members. In the coming weeks and  months, as governments manage the SARS -CoV -2 virus 
pandemic, it is quite possible that travel between states and cities may be limited, or that cities may 
have curfews. This amendment seeks to mitigate risk and enable ongoing care as feasible.  
 
This appe ndix proposes the following changes for this investigator -initiated trial:  
 Convert whenever possible all outpatient office visits to tele -medicine (video and phone) 
as necessary to continue monitoring, care, and treatment. Patients with concerning 
symptoms  or labs from tele -medicine visits may be escalated to in -person evaluations as 
needed in the appropriate setting. This will serve to triage patients based on needs versus  
risk.  
o For example, some patients on this study may be on a well -tolerated and effec tive 
therapy dose for 6 to 30 months, and have little need to be seen in -person in the 
clinic if the re are no changes or new issues . 
 Patients will continue to have necessary blood work and scans to monitor for toxicities and 
disease status. Basic study pro cedures such as blood draws, radiographic scans, ECHO, 
ECG can be done by patients’ local providers . These results will be reviewed by the Study 
Team centrally.  
 ECHO and ECGs are for data collection , but are not expected to find rare abnormalities.  
These c an be deferred unless prompted by symptoms or clinical concern.  
 We will provide the option for oral therapies to be shipped to patients from our 
Investigational Drug Pharmacy or patients/family members could pick them up.  
 Depending on circumstances, local  healthcare providers in another city may be required to 
assess and evaluate patients, and the PI will communicate with these providers to facilitate 
care as it relates to study treatment.  
 On-treatment biopsies , as well as  post-progression studies or biop sies, may be deferred 
depending on the availability of resources in the healthcare system.  
 
Our Team has over 5 years of experience treating and managing patients with this oral therapy, 
and we are confident that this will ensure ongoing therapy that is be neficial and safe.  
 
Time Frame:  This amendment  is expected to span a duration of 6 months, and will re -assess the 
clinical situation prior to the end of this period.

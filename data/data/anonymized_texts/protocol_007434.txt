 1.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
At the present, the most widely -utilized analgesic intervention for patient receiving ankle and foot 
surgeries at HSS is the peripheral nerve block known as the popliteal nerve bloc k which is 
performed. The popliteal block is performed on the sciatic nerve at the level of the popliteal fossa. 
Since the sciatic nerve provides sensory and motor functions to the majority of the lower leg, the 
popliteal block is a good choice for use dur ing ankle and foot surgeries. However, the main 
disadvantage with this block is that because it’s done on the sciatic nerve which is responsible for 
motor function of most of the lower leg, the block prevents motor function of the ankle and foot for 
some t ime after surgery. Many studies have shown that patients participating in physical therapy 
(PT) after surgery had short hospital stays, faster ambulation and lower chances of 30 -day 
readmissions. Since most patients who receive foot and ankle surgery canno t move their foot/ankle 
after surgery they will be unable to participate in PT for some time. Thus, there is an incentive to 
investigate the potential benefits of a block that would provide a s similar level of analgesia while 
allowing patients to particip ate in PT which will likely aid their recovery.  
 
The idea for the mid -calf block (MIDCAB) came from previous work and studies done on 
ultrasound -guided ankle blocks that have been modified. Currently these ankle blocks under 
ultrasound -guidance is performe d distally, at the level of the ankle joint and foot. With this approach 
the block coverage is limited to the mid distal foot, the ankle block does not cover surgeries 
performed on the ankle joint. Instead of this, the MIDCAB block is performed proximally on the 
same nerves that are targeted with the ankle block but instead of performing it distally, it will be 
done proximally at the level of the mid -calf on the patient’s leg. Moving the probe more proximal on 
the leg will provide analgesia on the ankle joi nt and foot while also creating an advantage compared 
to the current standard of care at HSS, the popliteal block.  
 
MIDCAB is defined as a group of ultrasound guided distal nerve blocks at the level of the individual 
branches. The probe is placed mid -calf between the popliteal fossa and the ankle.  The nerves to 
be blocked are the tibial nerve, superficial and deep peroneal nerves, sural and saphenous. Unlike 
the popliteal block, MIDCAB can provide the necessary analgesia to the foot and ankle of the 
patient  while allowing them to preserve motor function of the foot. Right after surgery patients 
should be able to move their foot once the standard epidural has worn off and they should be able 
to participate in a PT sooner thus aiding their recovery. With this pilot study we are hoping to inform 
a subsequent randomized control trail (RCT) that would compare the pain scores, recovery and 
duration of the popliteal block to MIDCAB.

2.0 OBJECTIVE(S)  OF CLINICAL  STUDY  
This is a pilot observational cohort study aiming for a future randomized clinical -controlled 
trial with the objective of seeing if this MIDCAB block is a better alternative to the current 
standard of care  popliteal block. We will mainly be assessing the duration of the MIDCAB 
block  in patients who  are undergoing foot and ankle surgery at HSS.   
The majority of patients undergoing foot and ankle procedures are given a popliteal for 
analgesia afterwards, however that block prevents patients from moving their ankle and foot 
for sometimes after surgery . The hope with MIDCAB is that patients will be able to move their 
foot after surgery while having pain relief at the same time, allowing for earlier physical 
therapy to take place and thus faster recovery time.  
We will aim to look at the following primary outcome:  
1. Block Duration (PACU, POD1, POD2 & POD7). The primary outcome will be block 
duration, how long the MIDCAB block provides analgesia. This will be measured via 
questionnaires of pain scores given to patients post surgical discharge (in PACU ), 24h 
post-surgical discharge, 48 hours post -surgical discharge, and 1-week  post-surgical 
discharge. Pain scores will be measured via NRS pain scale; the NRS (numeric rating 
scale) is a questionnaire that measures pain on a numeric scale, 0 (no pain) to 1 0 
(worst pain imaginabl e). We will also measure the time that pain began and the times 
that sensation of the foot returned for patients.  
We will also be looking at the following secondary outcomes :  
1. Motor Function (Measured in PACU). The return of the pat ient's foot/ankle motor 
function which will be measured by whether the patient can dorsiflex/plantarflex at 
the ankle or have flexion/extension of the toes.  
2. Opioid Use (PACU, POD1, POD2 & POD7). Cumulative opioid consumption in 
morphine equivalents will be  recorded post -surgical discharge (in PACU), 24h post -
surgical discharge, 48 hours post -surgical discharge, and 1 -week post -surgical 
discharge.  
3. Presence of Paresthesia/Numbnes s & Skin Irritation/Wounds  (POD7). Patients will 
be asked if they have any residu al numbness , skin irritation or wounds at site of 
surgery/block.  
4. Nausea & Vomiting (PACU, POD1, POD2 & POD7). The questionnaire used asks 
patients if they have experienced any nausea and vomiting, they are asked how 
many episodes of each have occurred. Pa tients are also asked on a scale from 0 -10 
(0 being not severe and 10 being the worst severity) how severe their nausea was. 
This will be measured post -surgical discharge (in PACU), 24h post -surgical 
discharge, 48 hours post -surgical discharge, and 1 -week post-surgical discharge

 3.0 STUDY  HYPOTHESES  
This is a pilot study aiming to assess the feasibility  of MIDCAB to provide acceptable analgesia 
for foot/ankle surgery while still allowing the patient to preserve motor function of the foot and 
ankle.  We hy pothesize that the duration and analgesia of MIDCAB block will be non -inferior to 
the currently standard popliteal while being superior in terms of preserving motor function

6.0 PROCEDURES  
 
6.1 Intraoperative  Protocol  (update with detailed procedure)  
 
Following patient transfer to the operating room, neuraxial anesthesia (spinal or combined  
spinal epidural (CSE) with up to 60mg  mepivacaine 1.5%  or up to 60mg of chloroprocaine 
2%. Sedation  will be provided  intraoperatively with midazolam (up to 5mg) , ketorolac (up to 
30mg ), famotidine (up to 20mg), along with ondansetron (4mg), dexamethasone ( 4mg) and 
propofol  (titrated  to effect).  Tranexamic  acid (TXA)  will be dosed  per surgeon  request.  Patient 
will be placed on a supine position with the anesthesiologist on the same side to be blocked.  
The MIDCAB block will be administered with ultrasound -guidance via a 25-gauge  needle ; 
30ml bupivacaine 0.5% and 4mg preservative free dexamethasone will be divided into the 
following five nerves:  
- Posterior Tibia l nerve: probe placed posterior to the medial malleoli. Posterior tibial artery 
and posterior tibial nerve are identified. Move the probe proximally following both artery 
and nerve to the level of the mid -calf. Using a 25 G needle, 10cc of local  anesthetic  is 
administered with careful visualization of the local anesthetic  surrounding  the nerve.    
- Saphenou s nerve: Located the saphenous vein at the level of the medial  malleoli  Pay 
attention to place a very gentle pressure on the probe to not collapse the vein. Follow the 
vein proximally to the level of the mid-calf. The nerve is lateral to the vein usually n ot seen. 
A perivascular injection at the level of the mid -calf is performed.  5 cc of local anesthetic is 
administered  
- Deep peroneal Nerve: Probe moves medially towards the medial border of the tibia 
between the medial and lateral maleolli. The dorsalis ped is artery is easily identified next 
to the tibia. The probe moves as proximally as possible keeping the artery in view. The 
deep peroneal nerve is most commonly found laterally to the artery at this level.  5cc of 
local anesthetic is used paying attention t o perform a perivascular injection.  
- Superficial peroneal  nerve: Moving the probe laterally the fibula is identified. Along with 
the Extensor digitalis muscle medially and the peroneus brevis laterally. The superficial 
peroneal nerve is located between the two muscles. Follow the nerve proximally to the 
mid-calf. Pay  careful attention, the nerve is very superficial just deeper  of the muscle 
fascia. 5cc of local anesthetic is delivered to surround the nerve.     
- Sural Nerve:  Move the probe lateral and posterio r. Identified the peroneus brevis and the 
achilles tendon. The short saphenous vein is also  identified  between the 
peroneus  brevis  and the achilles tendon. The sural nerve is usually located lateral to the 
vein.  Follow the sural nerve proximally to the le vel of the mid -calf. 5 cc of 
local anesthetic  is administered.  
Postoperatively, all patients will receive oral dexamethasone 10mg every 8 hours (3 doses),  
intravenous ketorolac 15mg (7.5 if under 50kg) every 6 hours, and oral acetaminophen  
1000mg  every  6 hours until discharged.  For pain not controlled  on this regimen,  patients  will 
be offered oral oxycodone, and intractable pain will be treated at the discretion of the  provider. 
After 24 hours, patients will be transitioned to and discharged on oral meloxic am 7.5mg every 
6 hours and oral acetaminophen 1000mg every 8 hours for thirty days. The PA        or fellow 
working with the surgeon will place a discharge order for 42 oxycodone 5mg with  no refills. 
Patients will be discharged with Mobic 15mg (7.5 if under  50kg) and  acetaminophen  500mg.  
NRS pain scores (numeric scale 0 -10) will be assessed along with motor function of the foot 
in the PACU.  Additional pain score, nausea/vomiting and medication usage assessments will 
be performed on  postoperative days 1, post operative day 2 and  postoperative day  7.

Background:  
 
 
 
 
Objectives:  New combinatorial  therapeutic  strategies  are needed  to overcome  resistance  to 
immune  checkpoint  inhibitors  in a number  of malignancies.   We hypothesize  
that manipulation  of the innate  immune  system  by targeting macrophage  
activity  will assist  in reversing  local  immune  suppression  and overcome  
resistance  to PD -1/PD -L1 inhibition. 
Phase  1 Objectives  
Primary  • To assess  the safety  and tolerability  of APX005M  in combination  with  
cabiralizumab  
• To assess  the safety  and tolerability  of APX005M  in combination  with  
cabiralizumab and nivolumab 
• To determine the recommended phase  2 dose (RP2D)  of APX005M  in 
combination  with a fixed  dose of cabiralizumab  and nivolumab 
Secondary • To determine the adverse  event  (AE)  profile  of this combination 
Exploratory • To characterize  the pharmacokinetic  (PK)  profile  of APX005M  when 
administered  in combination  with  cabiralizumab  and nivolumab 
• To characterize  the pharmacodynamic  (PD)  profile  of APX005M  when  
administered  in combination  with  cabiralizumab and nivolumab 
• To further  characterize  the PD profile  and immunogenicity  of APX005M  in 
combination  with cabiralizumab and nivolumab  by analyses  of pre- 
treatment  and on-treatment  tumor  biopsies  and blood  collection  
Phase  1b Objectives  
 
CA025 -007 Version  10  21 Mar -2022 
Confidential  Page  3 of 135 
  
 Primary  • Determine  the objective  response  rate (ORR)  using RECIST  v1.1 to  
APX005M  in combination  with cabiralizumab and nivolumab  in patients  
with advanced  melanoma,  non-small  cell lung cancer  (NSCLC),  and renal  
cell carcinoma  (RCC)  whose  tumors  are resistant  to anti-PD-1/PD -L1 
therapy 
• Evaluate  the safety  and tolerability  of the RP2D of  APX005M  in 
combination  with cabiralizumab  and nivolumab 
 
Secondary  
• To determine the progression -free survival  (PFS)  of patients  with  
melanoma,  NSCLC or  RCC treated  with  APX005M  in combination  with 
cabiralizumab  and nivolumab  whose  tumors  are resistant  to anti-PD-1/PD - 
L1 therapy.  
• To determine the overall  survival  (OS)  of patients  with  melanoma,  NSCLC  
or RCC treated  with  APX005M  in combination  with  cabiralizumab  and 
nivolumab  whose  tumors  are resistant  to anti-PD-1/PD -L1 therapy.  
• To assess  the association  of selected biomarker  measures and clinical  
efficacy  measures  using pre-treatment  and on -treatment  tumor  biopsies  
Exploratory • To identify  immune  correlates  that are associated  with clinical  response  or 
resistance  to the triple  combination.   Biomarker  analyses  will include  study  
of pre -treatment  and on-treatment  biopsies  as well as analyses of  select  
serum  and PBMC markers.

Study  Design   
This trial is a phase  1/1b study  to evaluate  the safety,  efficacy,  and tolerability  
of APX005M  in combination  with  nivolumab  and cabiralizumab.   The phase  1 
dose escalation  portion  will enroll  patients  with  advanced  solid tumors  
(melanoma,  NSCLC,  and RCC)  to determine  the RP2D  of APX005M.  The 
phase 1b dose  expansion  portion  will study the triple  drug combination  in three  
disease  cohorts.  APX005M  is a humanized  IgG1  agonistic monoclonal  
antibody  that binds  CD40. Nivolumab  is a humanized IgG4  monoclonal  
antibody  directed  against  PD-1. Cabiralizumab  is a humanized IgG4  
monoclonal  antibody  directed  against  CSF1R.

Phase  1: Dose  
Escalation   
Patients  with  advanced  solid  tumors  will be sequentially  enrolled  in 6 cohorts  
using a standard  3 + 3 dose escalation  design  to determine  safety,  characterize  
the AEs,  and establish  the RP2D of  APX005M  in combination  with  nivolumab  
and cabiralizumab.   A minimum  of 48 hours observation  will be required  after 
each patient  is enrolled  in cohorts  1-6, before  a subsequent  patient  can be 
enrolled. Approximately  3 patients  will be enrolled per  cohort.  Cohorts  1, 3, 
and 5 will  include  cabiralizumab  at 4 mg/kg  and dose escalation  of APX005M.  
Cohorts  2, 4, and 6 will include  nivolumab  at 240 mg, cabiralizumab  at 4 
mg/kg, and dose escalation  of APX005M.  Each  cycle  will be 14 days with  
anticipated  dosing  as follows:

If none of the  first 3 evaluable  patients  in a dose cohort  experience  a dose- 
limiting  toxicity  (DLT)  in the first two cycles,  then the next 3 patients  will be 
treated  at the next higher  dose  cohort. If 1 of 3 patients  within  a cohort  
experiences  a DLT  in the first two cycles,  then 3 additional  patients  will be 
added to that cohort.  If a second  patient  experiences  a DLT  at that dose level  
in the first two cycles,  the next  cohort  will not be initiated,  and the dose of one 
or more  drugs  will be de-escalated.   Patients  at each dose  level  will be 
evaluated  for at least  4 weeks  from  the start of treatment  before  additional  
patients  can be treated  at a higher  dose level.   If DLTs  are observed in 2 or 
more  patients  within  a cohort, the maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  will have  
been exceeded  and no further  patients  will be treated  at that dose  level.   At 8 
weeks,  imaging  studies will be performed  to assess for  response.   Of note,  2 
sets of cohorts  will be conducted  simultaneously:   Cohorts  2 and 3, and 
Cohorts  4 and 5, as  depicted  below.

Dose  escalation  will be based  on the number  of DLTs  experienced  during  the 
DLT  evaluation  interval  as determined by  dose escalation  meetings  attended  
by the PIs  and Industry  Collaborators  (see Secti on 3.1.2.1.1  for DLT  criteria).  
The DLT evaluation  interval  begins  on the first day of treatment  and continues  
for 28 days.

Phase  1b Study  Once  a specific  dose regimen  is determined to be  safe as determined  by the 
Sponsors  and Industry Collaborators,  the phase  1b portion  will follow and will  
enroll  additional  patients  in three  disease -specific  cohorts, all of whom  who 
have progressed  on prior  PD-1/PD -L1 therapy:  advanced  melanoma,  NSCLC,

and RCC who  have progressed  on prior  PD-1/PD -L1 therapy.  Patients  will be 
treated  at the estimated  APX005M  RP2D in combination with nivolumab 240 
mg IV and cabiralizumab  4 mg/kg  on day 1 of each 14-day cycle.  
 
 
Number  of Patients   In the Phase  1 dose escalation  portion,  at least  3 patients  with  advanced solid  
tumors  will be enrolled  per cohort  using a standard  3+3 design.  There  are a 
total of 6 cohorts.   In the Phase  1b portion,  a Simon’s  two-stage  design  will be 
used to study 3 disease  cohorts:  advanced  melanoma,  NSCLC,  and RCC.   The  
null hypothesis  that the true response  rate is 10%  will be tested  against  a one- 
sided  alternative.  In the first stage,  13 patients  in each  disease  cohort  will be 
accrued.   If there  are 1 or fewer  responses  in these  13 patients,  the enrollement  
in that disease  cohort  will be stopped.  Otherwise,  21 additional  patients  will be 
accrued  for a total of 34 patients  per disease  cohort.  The null hypothesis      
will be rejected  if 6 or more  responses  are observed  in 34 patients.  This design  
yield  a type I error  rate of 0.1 and a power of 80%  when  the true response  rate 
is 25%.

1. Introduction and Study  Rationale  
1.1 Introduction  
Immunotherapies  including PD-1/PD -L1 inhibitors  have become effective  standard  therapies  in 
several  advanced  cancers.  Objective  response rates (ORR) for advanced  melanoma  patients  
treated  with dual (ipilimumab  and nivolumab) or single  agent  (nivolumab) immune  checkpoint 
inhibitors have reached  up to 57.6% and 43.7%, respectively  [1-4].  However,  not all patients  
respond and after 2 years  of monotherapy, approximately half of the responders have progressed. 
Similarly,  in advanced  non-small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC)  patients  with greater  than  50% tumor 
PD-L1 positivity,  pembrolizumab is used in the front -line setting  with a 44.8% response rate [ 5]. 
Nivolumab and atezolizumab  are also approved for NSCLC  patients  who have progressed on 
platinum- based  chemotherapy  and who are not candidates  for EGFR  or ALK inhibitors  [6, 7]. 
Additionally,  nivolumab is approved in second -line treatment of advanced renal  cell carcinoma  
(RCC)  with a 25% ORR  [8]. In the absence of targetable  driver mutations,  limited  treatment  
options exist for next- line therapy  in patients  who do not initially  respond to or who develop  
acquired  resistance  to PD-1 inhibitors.  New combinatorial therapeutic strategies  are needed  to 
overcome this resistance.  
 
P
roposed mechanisms  for resistance to anti-PD-1/PD -L1 therapy  include lack of or inactivation  of 
T cells,  T cell exhaustion,  loss of  antigen  presentation,  or expression of other immunosuppressive  
molecules.  Tumor -associated  macrophages (TAMs)  comprise up to 30% of innate  immune cells 
in the tumor microenvironment [ 9] and can serve  as both negative (M1)  and positive (M2)  
regulators  of tumor growth. M2 macrophages  are anti-inflammatory  and secrete  
immunosuppressive growth factors  that negatively impact  cytotoxic  T-cell capabilities  [10-13] and 
promote  tumorigenesis,  invasion, and metastasis  [14, 15]. We hypothesize that manipulation  of 
the innate immune  system  by targeting macrophage activity will assist  in reversing  local  immune  
suppression and  overcome resistance to PD -1/PD -L1 inhibition. 
 
1.2 Rationale for  Combination  of APX005M with nivolumab  and cabiralizumab  
Immunotherapies  including CSF1R  inhibitors  (CSF1Ri)  and CD40  agonists  (CD40 α) target  innate 
immune  cells.  Researchers  including  those  at Yale  have shown  these  agents  to suppress poorly T- 
cell infiltrated  melanomas  in a T- cell independent  fashion.  Macrophage colony- stimulating  factor  
1 (CSF -1) is chemotactic  signal that stimulates  monocyte tumor infiltration  and differentiation  into 
M2 macrophages  [10, 16] an d  elevated  expression of CSF-1 and CSF1R  is associated  with poor 
prognosis [ 17]. For example,  in a melanoma  mouse model,  CSF1Ri  improved efficacy  of adoptive 
cell therapy  by increasing  T-cell tumor infiltration  and decreasing  immunosuppressive 
macrophage infiltration  [18]. CD40  is similarly  expressed  on macrophages  and other antigen  
presenting  cells,  and interacts  with  its ligand, CD40L,  on T cells.  CD40 α have also been  shown  to 
increase tumoricidal activity  of macrophages  and stimulate  maturation  of antigen presenting cells.  
In a pancreatic mouse model, combination  PD-1 blockade  and CD40 α improved anti-tumor  
immunity  compared  to either  agent  alone [ 19]. Clinical trials  of CD40 α have shown  activity  in 
melanoma,  including durable responses [ 20]. 
 
Pre-clinical  studies  at Yale in the Kaech  and Bosenberg  laboratories have supported the notion that 
TAMs  may confer  resistance  to PD-1/PD -L1 inhibition [ 21]. Using  the BrafV600E/Pten-/- 
genetically  engineered  mouse melanoma  model (GEMM),  we have generated  a series  of cell lines

(YUMM  for Yale University  Mouse Melanoma)  and irradiated  derivatives  (YUMMER  for Yale 
University  Mouse  Melanoma Exposed to UVB  Radiation). These  models are unique in that they 
are driven by mutations  relevant  to human melanomas  and can be studied  in immune  competent  
mice.  YUMM  tumors  tend to be resistant  to PD-1/PD -L1 inhibitors,  while  the YUMMER  tumors  
are less  resistant,  but do develop resistance over time,  mimicking  primary  and acquired  resistance 
seen in humans.  We have  found that the 
predominant immune population present  in tumors with poor cytotoxic T cell infiltration  are 
TAMs.  TAMs  are particularly  in abundance relative to CD8+ T cells in YUMM  tumors,  with the 
inverse being observed   in  YUMMER   tumors  
(Figure 1).  
 
Tumor infiltrating  neutrophils (TINs)  and CD4  T cells  are present as well,  but mostly  at the tumor 
margin.  Tumor  growth  in this model  is not responsive to anti-PD-1/PD -L1 treatment  alone,  but 
combination  therapy  with CSF1Ri  slows  tumor growth  significantly  compared  to the control (data 
not shown). Treatment  with combined  CSF1Ri/CD4 α slows  tumor growth more than  either agent  
alone  (Figure  2 upper panel).  The combination  therapy  also resulted  in increased  tumor infiltrating  
immune  cells,  clearly  impacting  the TAM  population (Figure 2 lower panel).

to PD-1/PD -L1 inhibitors,  but develops  resistance 
over time.  TAM  content  is abundant  in the former,  
whereas  more  CD8 cells are infiltrating  the latter.

Additional  detailed  mechanistic studies  have been conducted supporting the combination of 
CD40 α and CSF1Ri  in these animal  models  and their  role in activating  the innate immune 
system  (Perry  CJ et al, submitted).  Combined  treatment  with  CD40 α and CSF1Ri alters  the 
composition of TAMs,  increases  Type I inflammation and  chemokine expression, and  enhances 
CD8  T-cell infiltration  and PD -1 expression. 
 
As shown in the flow plots  in Figure 3 for example,  the expression TNF -α on TAMs  significantly  
increases  with  combined CSF1Ri/CD40 α. 
 
 
Figure  2. Upper  panel:  Groups  of 12 mice  were treated  with control  vehicle,  CD40  agonist  alone,  CSF1R  inhibitor  
alone,  or the combination 30 days  after tumor  induction.  The combination  resulted in significant  inhibition of tumor  
growth compared  with either  drug alone.  
 
Lower  Panel:  Treatment  of mice  with CD40  agonists,  CSF1R  inhibitors  or the combination  thereof  impacted  tumor  
infiltrating  immune  cells,  particularly tumor  associated  macrophages  (TAM)  and neutrophils (TAN).

Inflammatory  cytokines including TNF α and IFNγ appear  to be necessary  for anti-tumor  immunity  
provided by combined  CSF1Ri  and CD4 α therapy.  As shown in  the Kaplan -Meier  curves  (Figure 
4 upper panel) and the associated  log-rank p values  (Mantel -Cox)  (Figure  4 lower  panel), TNF α 
and IFNγ blocking therapy actually  interferes  with tumor growth  suppression from  combined  
CSF1Ri  and CD40 α therapy. Data are from  one experiment  (n=3 -6), representative of three 
independent experiments  (total n=6-15). 
 
 
 
 
 
In pilot experiments, we  have shown that mice  (n=11) treated  with  the triple  combination  of anti - 
PD-1/CSF1Ri/CD40 α had superior survival compared  to treatment  with  anti-PD-1/CSF1Ri  or 
anti-PD-1/CD40 α (Figure 5).  
Figure  3. Treatment  with CSF1Ri  and CD40α in combination alters  the macrophage  content  to a greater  degree 
than either  drug alone.  
Figure  4. Kaplan  Meier  survival  curves  (upper  panel)  and associated  statistical  comparisons  (lower  panel)  show  
that TNF α and IFNγ are necessary for anti-tumor  immunity provided  by combined  CSF1Ri  and CD40 α therapy,  as 
blocking  them interferes  with the inhibition  of tumor  growth by these drugs.

Thus, based  on the above pre-clinical  data,  we hypothesize that addition  of CSF1Ri/CD40 α to PD- 
1 blockade may further  disengage T cell suppression and potentiate  the anti-tumor  immune  
response. We therefore  propose a phase I/Ib clinical trial of the CD40 α APX005M  in combination  
with cabiralizumab  (CSF1Ri)  and nivolumab  in advanced  solid  tumors  including  melanoma,  
NSCLC,  and RCC.  Our preliminary  data from  immune profiling of murine tumors  treated  with 
CSF1Ri  and CD40 α indicate  that biomarkers of response include TNF α, IL-6, CCL3,4,5 and 
CD8+  T cell/neutrophil  recruitment.  We aim to identify  immune  correlates  that are associated  
with clinical  response to the triple  combination  and to develop biomarkers  of response using 
mandatory pre-treatment and on-treatment  biopsies. 
 
Seeing  that APX005M  and cabiralizumab  have not been  used in combination,  and both drugs 
activate macrophages, we propose an initial cohort  of the APX005M and cabiralizumab.  This 
cohort will be followed  by the addition of fixed  dose nivolumab. APX005M  will then be slowly  
dose escalated  in combination  with cabiralizumab,  with and without nivolumab, to establish  safety  
and to establish  the RP2D  of APX005M in combination  with  nivolumab  and cabiralizumab.  
 
1.3
 Target Receptor Background  
 
1.3.1 Tumor -Associated Macrophages and Colony  Stimulating  Factor 1 Receptor  
Macrophages  are myeloid -derived cells that carry  out a variety  of functions in the human  body. 
They  can colonize tissues and  tumors  through two distinct  mechanisms:  hematogenous seeding  
from  circulating  monocytes or local  self-renewal  in the form  of tissue -resident  macrophages  
[22]. Recent  studies  have shown that  macrophages  exert  their physiologi cal effect  within,  and 
play roles unique to, the tissues in which  they  are active [ 23]. Macrophage regulation  is complex 
as these cells actively  secrete and  respond  to multiple  cytokine and chemokine gradients  within  
their local environment. 
Figure  5. YUMM  1.7 bearing mice  were  treated  with control  vehicle,  CD40  agonistic antibodies (CD40α),  
CSF1R  inhibitors  (CSF1Ri)  or anti-PD-1/L1.  These  tumors  are resistant  to any of the three  
monotherapies,  and survival  was clearly superior  with triplet  therapy compared  with doublets  of CSF1Ri  
or CD40α and PD-1 axis inhibitors.  
 
CA025 -007 Version  10  21 Mar -2022

Macrophages  are among the most abundant immune  cell types  in the tumor microenvironment.  
Based  on their opposing functions, macrophages  can be classified  into two  major phenotypes, 
M1 and  M2. M1 macrophages  are immunostimulatory  and tumor suppressive, while M2  
macrophages  are immunosuppressive and tumor promoting. Substantial  evidence suggests  that 
tumor -associated  macrophages  (TAMs)  are polarized towards  an anti-inflammatory  M2 
phenotype [ 24]. Consistent  with  this, increased  levels of  TAMs  are associated  with  a poor 
prognosis in the majority  of cancers  [25]. Based  on their tumor -promoting  phenotype TAMs  
have become an  attractive therapeutic target.  
 
Colony stimulating  factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling  plays a fundamental  role in the 
differentiation,  maintenance,  and function of macrophages [ 26]. There are two  ligands for 
CSF1R:  CSF1  and IL34. These agonists  bind to overlapping regions  of CSF1R with  similar  
affinity  (reviewed  in Masteller and  Wong [27] ). Mice lacking  CSF1R,  CSF1, or IL34  have 
deficiencies  in macrophages, underscoring the essential  role of the CSF1R  pathway  in the 
biology of this cell  type [ 27, 28]. Pharmacologic treatments  that block  CSF1R in cancer settings  
are expected  to reduce or reprogram  M2 TAMs  and reduce immune  suppression. Following 
treatment  with  anti-CSF1R  agents, the remaining  macrophage compartment may  be repolarized  
from  an M2 immunosuppressive state to an  M1 anti-tumor state,  which  would support T- cell 
responses.  This conversion associated  with  concurrent treatment modalities,  such as anti-PD-1 
treatment,  could  have an  increased  effect  on reduction of tumor growth  [29]. 
 
Support  for targeting  CSF1R  in cancer comes from animal  studies  in which  antibody or small  
molecule inhibition of CSF1R  decreases  M2 TAMs resulting  in decreased immune suppression 
and a more  robust cytotoxic T -cell response [ 30-32]. Cabiralizumab  is a recombinant,  humanized  
immunoglobulin G4  (IgG4) monoclonal  antibody that binds to human  CSF1R.  The interaction  of 
cabiralizumab  and CSF1R antagonizes the binding of both CSF1  and IL34  to CSF1R,  thereby 
preventing  receptor  activation.  In vitro , cabiralizumab  inhibits CSF1  and IL34 -induced 
proliferation  and survival of peripheral blood monocytes.  In vivo,  cabiralizumab  inhibits the  
survival  of subsets of monocytes  and macrophages.  
Taken  together,  these and other emerging  data suggest  that blocking CSF1R with  cabiralizumab  
treatment  may  reduce immunosuppression in the tumor environment generated  by TAMs  and 
enhance the efficacy  of immune- based  anti-cancer  therapies.  
 
1.3.2 Programmed  Cell  Death -1 (PD -1; CD279)  
PD-1 is a  cell surface signaling  receptor  that delivers  inhibitory signals to regulate the balance 
between  T-cell activation  and tolerance by interacting  with its ligands, PD -L1 (CD274;  B7-H1) 
and PD-L2 (B7-DC/CD273).  It is a 55 kDa type I transmembrane protein that is a  member of the 
CD28  family  of T- cell costimulatory  receptors,  which also  includes inducible co -stimulator  
(ICOS),  cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA -4), and B- and  T-lymphocyte attenuator  
(BTLA) [ 33]. PD -1 contains  an intracellular membrane proximal immunoreceptor tyrosine  
inhibitory motif  (ITIM)  and a membrane distal immunoreceptor tyrosine -based  switch  motif  
(ITSM).  PD-1 is primarily  expressed  on activated  T cells,  B cells,  and myeloid cells  [34]. Its  
l
igands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, have been shown to  down -regulate T -cell activation  upon binding to 
 
CA025 -007 Version  10  21 Mar -2022 
Confidential  Page  32 of 135 
  
  
 
PD-1 in both murine and human systems  [35, 36]. PD -1 delivers a negative signal by the 
recruitment  of Src  homology region 2 domain -containing  phosphatase-2 (SHP -2) to the 
phosphorylated tyrosine residue in the ITSM  in its cytoplasmic  region  [37, 38 ]. 
 
Evidence for a negative regulatory role of PD-1 comes from  studies  of PD-1-deficient  mice,  
which  develop various autoimmune phenotypes, including dilated  cardiomyopathy and a lupus- 
like syndrome with  arthritis  and nephritis [ 39-41].  The emergence of these  autoimmune 
phenotypes is dependent on the genetic background of the mouse strain; many  of these 
phenotypes emerge at  different  times  and show variable penetrance.  In addition to the 
phenotypes of null mutations,  PD-1 inhibition by antibody- mediated  blockade in several  murine 
models has  been  found to  play a role in the development of autoimmune diseases  such as 
encephalomyelitis, graft-versus -host disease,  and type I diabetes  [42-44]. Taken  together, these 
results  suggest  that PD-1 blockade has the potential to activate anti -self T- cell responses,  but 
these responses  are variable and  dependent  upon various  host genetic factors. Thus,  PD-1 
deficiency  or inhibition is not accompanied  by a universal  loss of tolerance to self -antigens. 
 
The PD -1 targeting agent, nivolumab  has been  investigated  clinically  in several  tumor types  
including non- small  cell lung  cancer  (NSCLC),  melanoma,  and renal  cell carcinoma (RCC),  
Classical  Hodgkin  lymphoma, squamous cell  carcinoma of the head  and neck, and  urothelial 
carcinoma as  a single agent or in combination  with  other treatments. A selection of  efficacy  data 
is described in the Nivolumab Investigator’s Brochure) .. As a single  agent, nivolumab shows  
remarkably  durable efficacy  in responding patients.  
 
Nivolumab is currently  approved in the  US for the following indications  [45]: 
 
• BRAF  V600  wild-type unresectable or metastatic  melanoma,  as a single  agent.  
• BRAF  V600  mutation -positive  unresectable or metastatic melanoma,  as a single agent.  
• Unresectable or metastatic melanoma,  in combination  with ipilimumab.  
• Metastatic non -small  cell lung cancer  and progression on or after platinum -based  
chemotherapy.  Patients  with EGFR  or ALK  genomic tumor aberrations  should have 
disease  progression on FDA -approved therapy  for these aberrations.  
• Advanced renal  cell carcinoma for patients  who  have received  prior anti -angiogenic  
therapy. 
• Classical  Hodgkin  lymphoma (cHL) that has  relapsed or  progressed after autologous  
hematopoietic stem cell  transplantation (HSCT) and post- transplantation  brentuximab  
vedotin or 3 or more lines of therapy  that includes autologous HSCT.  
• Recurrent  or metastatic squamous cell  carcinoma of the head  and neck  with disease  
progression on or after  a platinum- based  therapy.  
• Locally  advanced  or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who:  
– have disease progression during or following platinum- containing  chemotherapy

– have disease progression within  12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant  treatment  with  
platinum- containing  chemotherapy. 
 
 
 
1.3.3 CD40  
Apexigen has  developed the mAb  APX005M,  which  binds and  activates  CD40, a costimulatory  
molecule expressed  by antigen  presenting cells (APC).  As such, APX005M  is a CD40  agonistic  
antibody. The  cell surface  molecule CD40,  a member  of the tumor necrosis  factor receptor  
(TNFR) superfamily,  plays  an important role  in induction  of tumor apoptosis and  regulation  of 
immune  activation,  especially  in crosstalk  between  T cells  and APCs  [46]. CD40  is expressed  by 
dendritic cells  (DC),  B cells, monocytes, and some  non-lymphoid  cells [ 47]. The natural  ligand 
(CD40L) for CD40 is CD154, which  is expressed on activated  T cells and provides  a major  
component of T cell “help” for immune response. Agonistic CD40 antibodies can  substitute  for 
the function of CD154  on T cells  to boost immunity.  Signaling through  CD40 on APCs,  
including dendritic  cells  (DCs),  monocytes,  and B cells,  can, in turn, enhance the T cell response  
via improvement  in antigen  processing and  presentation and  through the release of cytokines 
from  activated  APCs  [48, 49]. Therefore,  an agonistic CD40  antibody can activate and  stimulate  
both innate and  adaptive immunity.  
 
CD40  is also  expressed  on many  tumor cells and  can mediate a direct  cytotoxic effect.  In 
addition  to B cell lymphoma,  CD40  expression  has been  reported  in 30−70%  of primary  human 
solid tumor samples  including melanoma  and carcinomas  [50]. Activation  of CD40  on tumor 
cells results  in tumor cell  apoptosis  and inhibition of tumor growth [12]. Due  to its action  on both 
immune  and tumor cells,  CD40  has been  studied  as a target  for novel cancer  immunotherapy;  
agonistic anti- CD40  antibodies  have been demonstrated  to be potent  stimulators  of tumor 
immune  responses in both animal  models  and cancer subjects [ 50-53].  
 
The potential mechanisms  of action  for an  agonistic  anti-CD40  antibody,  depending on its 
isotype, include stimulation  of immune response by  activating  antigen  processing and 
presentation,  recruitment  of immune  effectors  such as  natural  killer (NK) cells and  macrophages,  
and direct  cytotoxic effects  on tumor cells.  Thus,  the desired  therapeutic CD40 agonist antibody 
should have these functionalities.  
 
1.3.4 Product  Development Background  
 
1.3.4.1 Mechanism  of Action  
 
1.3.4.1.1 Cabiralizumab  
Cabiralizumab  is a recombinant, humanized  IgG4  monoclonal antibody that binds to human  
CSF1R.  Cabiralizumab  contains a single  amino  acid substitution  in the hinge region to prevent 
hemi -dimer exchange.  Binding of cabiralizumab  to CSF1R  antagonizes its natural  ligands, CSF1  
and IL34,  thereby  preventing activation  of CSF1R.  
 
CA025 -007 Version  10  21 Mar -2022 
Confidential  Page  34 of 135 
  
  
 
Cabiralizumab  inhibits both  CSF1  and IL34 -induced CSF1R  phosphorylation  in a cell  line 
engineered  to overexpress  CSF1R  (CHO -CSF1R), demonstrating that cabiralizumab  blocks the 
activation  of ligand-induced CSF1R  signaling  pathways.  Cabiralizumab  also inhibits CSF1  and 
IL34 -induced proliferation  and survival of peripheral  blood monocytes  in vitro , demonstrating  
that cabiralizumab  inhibits not only the initiation  of CSF1  and IL34  signaling  pathways,  but also 
the subsequent ph ysiologic responses of primary  human monocytes  to these  ligands. 
 
CSF1R  is expressed  on cells  of the monocyte/macrophage lineage and  signaling  through CSF1R  
via its ligands, CSF1  and IL34, supports differentiation,  maintenance,  and function of 
monocytes,  macrophages, and  osteoclasts.  TAMs  are among the most abundant immune cell  
types in the tumor microenvironment. Substantial  evidence suggests that TAMs  are polarized  
towards an  anti-inflammatory  phenotype (M2  TAMs)  and through both cell surface inhibitors 
and soluble factors,  such  as immunosuppressive cytokines, play  a major  role in inhibiting anti- 
tumor immune  responses  [24]. CSF1  is a major survival factor  for TAMs  and targeting CSF1R  
through cabiralizumab  should reduce TAM -mediated  immune  suppression resulting  in 
strengthening the anti -tumor response to immunotherapy. Therefore,  a drug that inhibits CSF1R  
should limit the immune -suppressive influence of TAMs  on the tumor microenvironme nt and 
could be complementary  and augment current  cancer  therapies.  
 
1.3.4.1.2 Nivolumab  
Cancer immunotherapy rests on the premise that  tumors can  be recognized  as foreign  rather than  
as self and  can be effectively  attacked  by an activated  immune system.  An effective immune  
response in this setting  is thought to rely  on immune surveillance of tumor antigens expressed  on 
cancer cells that  ultimately  results  in an  adaptive immune  response and  cancer cell death.  
Meanwhile,  tumor  progression may depend upon acquisition  of traits  that allow cancer cells  to 
evade immuno -surveillance and  escape effective innate  and adaptive immune  responses [ 54-57].  
Current  immunotherapy efforts  attempt to break  the apparent  tolerance of the  immun e system  to 
tumor cells  and antigens by either  introducing cancer  antigens by therapeutic vaccination  or by 
modulating  regulatory checkpoints  of the immune  system.  
 
T-cell stimulation  is a complex  process involving the integration  of numerous positive as  well as 
negative co -stimulatory  signals in addition  to antigen  recognition  by the T- cell receptor (TCR)  
[58]. Collectively,  these signals govern the balance  between  T-cell activation  and tolerance.  PD- 
1 signaling has been shown to inhibit CD28 -mediated  upregulation  of IL2, IL10, IL13, 
interferon -γ (IFN -γ) and  Bcl-xL. PD-1 signaling has also  been  noted  to inhibit T- cell activation, 
and expansion of previously activated  cells.  Evidence for  a negative regulatory role of PD-1 
comes  from  studies  of PD -1 deficient  mice,  which develop a variety  of autoimmune phenotypes  
[59]. These results  suggest that PD-1 blockade has  the potential  to promote anti -self T -cell 
responses,  but these responses are variable and  dependent upon various host genetic factors.  
Thus,  PD-1 deficiency  or inhibition is not  accompanied  by a universal loss of  tolerance to self 
antigens.

In vitro , nivolumab  binds to PD -1 with  high  affinity  (EC 50 0.39-2.62 nM),  and inhibits the 
binding of PD-1 to its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2 (IC 50 ± 1 nM).  Nivolumab binds specifically  to 
PD-1 and  not to related  members  of the CD28  family  such as  CD28,  ICOS,  CTLA -4 and  BTLA.  
Blockade of the PD-1 pathway  by nivolumab results in a  reproducible enhancement  of both 
proliferation  and IFN-γ release in a mixed lymphocyte reaction  (MLR).  Using  a cytomegalovirus 
(CMV) re -stimulation  assay  with human  peripheral  blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs),  the effect  
of nivolumab  on antigen -specific recall  response is  indicative of nivolumab -augmented  IFN-γ 
secretion  from CMV -specific memory  T cells in a  dose-dependent manner  versus  an isotype- 
matched  control.  In vivo blockade of PD-1 by a murine analog  of nivolumab enhances  the anti - 
tumor immune  response  and results  in tumor rejection  in several  immunocompetent mouse tumor  
models (MC38,  SA1/N,  and PAN02) [ 60]. 
 
1.3.4.1.3 APX005M  
The agonistic  CD40  mAb,  APX005M,  a humanized  IgG1 mAb  with a mutation  in the Fc portion, is  
engineered  to enhance  interaction  with  Fc receptors  to mediate  antibody  crosslinking.  APX005M has 
demonstrated  biological  activity  in human subjects  and a  favorable  toxicity  profile  when  given  IV at 
doses up to 1 mg/kg  body weight. 
 
Recently,  Zippelius and co-authors [61] showed  in preclinical  models that  CD40  engagement  with  an 
agonistic  mAb  leads to a  T cell  and IFN -γ dependent  upregulation  of PD-L1 on tumor infiltrating  
monocytes and macrophages,  thereby feeding  into a  negative  feedback  loop, which  hampers CD40 
induced  T-cell responses.  This resistance  mechanism  was successfully  circumvented  by co- 
administration  of PD-1/PD -L1 blocking  antibodies.  
 
Similarly,  other groups showed in preclinical  models of pancreatic  cancer  that CD40  activation  drove  
T-cell immunity  and reversed the complete  resistance  of pancreatic  tumors to  checkpoint  blockade.  
Combining a CD40 agonistic  antibody  with PD-1/PD -L1 blockade  enhanced anti-tumor immunity  
and improved  overall  survival  versus either  monotherapy [19, 62, 63]. 
 
Studies elucidating  the mechanism  of APX005M action showed  that it activates the CD40  signaling  
pathway, leading  to APC  activation,  as seen  in increased  CD80, CD83, and CD86  expression  and 
release  of cytokines from  human lymphocytes and monocytes.  In particular, APX005M induced 
interleukin  (IL)-12 p(70), TNF-α and IL -6 secretion  from DCs.  The CD40-agonistic  activity  of 
APX005M can be further  enhanced  by a toll-like receptor  (TLR)  4 agonist.  In comparison  with  3 
other CD40 -agonistic  antibody  analogs (CP- 870,893,  SGN -40, and ADC -1013), APX005M is  the 
most  potent  CD40  agonist.  APX005M’s CD40 -agonistic  activity  depends on its ability  to bind  
FcγRs. In in vitro cultures  with T cells and DCs,  APX005M was able to enhance  antigen-specific  T- 
cell proliferation  and promote  IFN- γ secretion.  In combination  with  an antibody  against  programmed 
cell death  ligand-1 (PD-L1),  APX005M synergistically  enhances antigen -specific  T-cell responses. 
Upon  binding to CD40- expressing  tumor cells,  APX005M was capable  of inducing ADCP and tumor  
cell apoptosis.  APX005M did not appear  to have  a substantive  effect  on normal human  DC and T- 
cell counts,  but could partially  reduce B- cell counts in  vitro [64].

1.3.5 Preclinical  Summary  
 
1.3.5.1 Cabiralizumab  
The PK profile of cabiralizumab  is complex  and characterized  by nonlinear  clearance that is  
likely  mediated  by binding to CSF1R  on cells.  As monocyte  and macrophage cells  are dependent  
on CSF1R  for viability,  these target -bearing  cells are reduced in number following cabiralizumab  
treatment,  resulting  in a decrease of target -mediated  clearance.  As target -mediated  clearance  
becomes  saturated  at high or  repeat  doses,  cabiralizumab clearance is similar to other human  IgG 
antibodies. 
 
Three PD biomarkers  correlate with  cabiralizumab  exposure in nonclinical studies: CSF1  serum  
levels,  circulating  CD16 -positive peripheral  blood monocytes  (CD16+ monocytes),  and serum  
markers  of bone resorption (Trap5b  and CTX).  CSF1 serum  levels  rapidly rise and  CD16+ 
monocyte levels rapidly  fall in a  dose -dependent manner that  correlates  closely  with 
cabiralizumab  plasma concentration.  Saturation  of the PD  response is achieved at  a low dose of 
cabiralizumab  (3 mg/kg  weekly) in cynomolgus monkeys.  The half-maximal response (IC 50) for 
reduction of CD16+ monocytes occurs at  a serum concentration  of approximately 3 µg/mL and 
the maximal response occurs  at approximately 10 µg/mL.  The level  of CD16 -negative (CD16–) 
monocytes  does not change with  exposure to cabiralizumab.  
 
In the in  vivo toxicology studies  in cynomolgus monkeys, cabiralizumab  was generally  well 
tolerated.  The most prominent clinical  observation was reversible periorbital edema,  seen  after 
prolonged exposure to cabiralizumab.  The onset  of the edema did not show a clear relationship  to 
exposure levels,  but edema resolved  after systemic  clearance of the drug. Periorbital edema is a  
known side effect  of drugs affecting  the CSF1  pathway  [31, 65]. The main  hematologic  change 
was a reversible decrease  in circulating  CD16+ monocytes,  which  was considered  a PD  effect.  
 
Cabiralizumab -related  clinical  chemistry  effects  included reversibly  increased ALT,  AST,  CK,  
and LDH serum levels.  These  laboratory abnormalities  were not associated  with  any 
histopathological evidence of liver,  cardiac,  or muscle  tissue  injury. Additionally,  cardiac 
troponin,  skeletal  troponin  (SkTnI),  myoglobin,  and aldolase did not show  any changes  further 
confirming the lack of any  liver or muscle injury.  The increased  serum levels are attributed  to 
diminished  clearance of ALT,  AST,  CK, and LDH molecules  from  serum due  to a reduced  
number of liver Kupffer cells.   Kupffer cells are the normal clearance mechanism for these serum  
enzymes  so a loss of macrophages leads to an  elevation  of these serum  enzymes  [66]. 
Accordingly, ALT,  AST,  CK,  and LDH elevations are considered  non-toxic and  an indirect  PD 
effect  of cabiralizumab exposure. 
 
One histopathological finding was the reversible expansion of the submucosal  collagen  fibers  by 
clear space and  varying amounts of a blue,  granular extracellular matrix  (ECM) in a variety  of 
tissues.  This  change was  neither associated  with  inflammatory  cells nor with any  sign of 
degeneration  or other  alteration  of the collagen  fibers,  fibroblasts,  or the smooth muscle cells  
within  the area of expansion. Because it was not associated  with  clinical  signs  and was 
 
CA025 -007 Version  10  21 Mar -2022

reversible,  it was  deemed  to be a non -adverse event. A similar observation  was also seen in 
op/op mice that lack  functional CSF1.  The reduction of tissue  macrophages  is the  likely  cause of 
the observed accumulation  of ECM  due to a decreased  clearance of glycosaminoglycans, 
especially  hyaluronic acid, that  are prominent  in connective tissue  and are normally  catabolized  
by macrophages [ 67]. This  change is also  considered  to be an  indirect PD  effect  of 
cabiralizumab.  
 
The no-observable-adverse- effect  level  (NOAEL)  for cabiralizumab  was determined  to be 
100 mg/kg  when  administered  for 13 weekly  doses to cynomolgus  monkeys, which  provides a 
32-fold safety  factor based on body surface  area calculation  for the starting dose  of 1 mg/kg in  
humans.

1.3.5.2 Nivolumab  
Nivolumab has  been  shown to bind specifically to the human  PD-1 receptor  and not to related  
members  of the CD28  family,  such as  ICOS,  CTLA -4, and  BTLA(Nivolumab  Investigator’s 
Brochure) . Nivolumab inhibits the interaction  of PD-1 with  its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, 
resulting  in enhanced T- cell proliferation  and IFN-γ release in vitro [68] (Nivolumab 
Investigator’s Brochure). Fluorescent -activated  cell sorter (FACS) analysis confirmed  that 
nivolumab  binds to transfected  Chinese hamster  ovary (CHO)  with  human  or cynomolgus  
monkey PD-1, but not to rat  or rabbit  PD-1 molecules. Nivolumab has  also been shown  to bind 
to PD -1 on activated  human T cells  expressing  cell surface PD -1 or on virus- specific CD8+ T 
cells from  chronically  infected  hepatitis C virus  patients  [69, 70].  
 
PD-1 inhibition in an  MLR  resulted  in a reproducible concentration -dependent enhancement  of 
IFN-γ release in the  MLR up to 50 µg/mL.  No effect  was observed with a human IgG4  isotype  
control or CD4+ T cells  and dendritic cell  (DC)  controls [ 71]. 
 
In intravenous repeat -dose toxicology studies  in cynomolgus monkeys,  nivolumab  was well  
tolerated  at doses  up to 50 mg/kg, administered  weekly  for 5 weeks,  and at doses up to 50 mg/kg,  
administered  twice weekly  for 27 doses. Nivolumab -related  findings  were limited to a  reversible 
decrease of 28% in triiodothyronine  (T3) among the females  administered  27 doses of 50 mg/kg  
nivolumab.  No corresponding  changes in the level  of thyroxine (T 4), thyroid- stimulating  
hormone (TSH),  or histologic  changes in the thyroid were observed.  While  nivolumab  alone was  
well tolerated  in cynomolgus  monkeys, combination studies  have highlighted the potential for 
enhanced  toxicity  when combined with  other immunostimulatory  agents[ 45]. 
 
Ipilimumab  (BMS -734016),  an anti-CTLA -4 monoclonal antibody that blocks the 
downregulation of T- cell activation,  was used  in combination with  nivolumab  to investigate the 
effects  of concurrent inhibition of the PD-1 and CTLA -4 receptors  in nonhuman primates[ 68]. 
Although  gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity  has not been observed in cynomolgus monkeys treated  
with nivolumab  alone,  dose -dependent GI  toxicity  was evident in cynomolgus monkeys  treated  
 
CA025 -007 Version  10  21 Mar -2022 
Confidential  Page  38 of 135 
  
  
 
weekly  for 4 weeks  with a combination  of nivolumab  and ipilimumab  at combinations  of 
10 mg/kg  and 3 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg  and 10 mg/kg,  respectively.  GI effects  have also  been  
observed at  a low incidence after ipilimumab  administration  [68]. 
 
In addition, an  enhanced  pre- and  post -natal  development (ePPND) study in pregnant 
cynomolgus  monkeys with nivolumab  was conducted [ 68]. Administration  of nivolumab  at up to 
50 mg/kg  every  2 weeks  was well  tolerated  by pregnant monkeys;  however, nivolumab  was 
determined  to be a selective developmental toxicant when  administered  from the  period of 
organogenesis to parturition at  ≥ 10 mg/kg  (area under the concentration -time curve [AUC]  from  
time zero  to 168 hours [AUC (0-168 h)] 117,000 µg•h/mL). Specifically,  increased  developmental 
mortality  (including late gestational  fetal losses  and extreme prematurity  with associated  
neonatal mortality)  was noted  in the absence of overt maternal  toxicity.  There were no 
nivolumab -related  changes  in surviving  infants tested throughout the 6-month postnatal period. 
Although  the cause of these pregnancy failures  was undetermined, nivolumab -related  effects  on 
pregnancy maintenance are  consistent  with  the established  role of PD-L1 in maintaining  
fetomaternal  tolerance in mice [ 72].

Investigator’s Brochure. 
 
1.3.5.3 APX005M  
Preclinical  experiments  with APX005M  showed that  it activates  the CD40  signaling pathway,  
leading  to APC  activation,  as demonstrated  by an increased  expression  of CD80, CD83,  and 
CD86  and by expression and release of cytokines from human DCs  and lymphocytes. As  a result  
of APC  activation,  APX005M  enhances T- cell proliferation  to alloantigen,  triggers production of 
IFN-γ in response to viral antigens, and  enhances  T-cell response to tumor  antigens. APX005M  
combined  with  a TLR  4 agonist or an  antibody against programmed  death ligand 1 (PD -L1) 
synergistically  enhances T- cell responses. 
 
In c
omparison with  other  CD40 -agonistic antibodies,  such  as CP-870,893, SGN- 40, and ADC - 
1013 analogs,  APX005M  is the  most potent  CD40  agonist. APX005M  did not appear to have a 
substantive effect  on normal human DC  and T-cell counts,  but could  partially  reduce B cell 
counts in vitro.  The potential for APX005M  to induce expression  of cytokines  was evaluated  
with peripheral  blood mononuclear  cells  (PBMC)  obtained from  normal humans and  treatment  
naïve cynomolgus  monkeys, including anti CD3  antibody as a positive control. Cytokine  
secretion  differed  significantly  between species  with much  less secretion  from  monkey PBMCs  
compared  with  human  PBMCs. These data suggest that  APX005M  is a strong CD40 -agonistic  
antibody that can activate APCs  (DCs,  B cells,  and monocytes) and in turn stimulate T -cell 
response.

1.3.6 Clinical Summary  
 
1.3.6.1 Cabiralizumab  
 
1.3.6.1.1 Clinical Study  Summary  of Cabiralizumab  
The clinical  summary  is based  on three  clinical  studies: 
 
1. Study FPA008 -001 evaluated  the safety  of cabiralizumab as  single or dual escalating  
doses in 48 healthy volunteers  (36 cabiralizumab  and 12 placebo). This study  also 
evaluated  the safety  and efficacy  of cabiralizumab  administered  as two or three  doses, 14 
days apart,  in 18 rheumatoid arthritis  patients.  This  study has been completed.  
 
2. Study FPA008 -002 is evaluating  the safety  and efficacy  of cabiralizumab  monotherapy 
for six  months in approximately 40 patients with pigmented  villonodular synovitis 
(PVNS).  
 
3. Study FPA008 -003 is evaluating  the safety  and efficacy  of cabiralizumab as  monotherapy 
and in combination  with  nivolumab  in approximately 295 patients with  advanced  cancers.  
 
1.3.6.1.2 Clinical Pharmacology Summary  (Pharmacokinetics,  Immunogenicity,  and 
Pharmacodynamics) of Cabiralizumab  
The available PK,  ADA,  and nonclassical  CD16+  monocyte status  following  cabiralizumab  
treatment  with  either monotherapy or in combination with  nivolumab  were characterized  in three 
trials: FPA008  001, FPA008-002, and  FPA008-003. The PK,  ADA,  and nonclassical  CD16+ 
monocyte data from Study  FPA008 -003 are summarized  below; data from Studies  FPA008 001 
and FPA008 -002 are presented in the cabiralizumab  IB. 
 
The PK profile of cabiralizumab  is characterized  by linear  and nonlinear clearance pathways,  
with the latter likely  mediated  by binding to CSF1R on cells.  As monocyte  and macrophage cells  
are dependent on CSF1R  for viability,  these target -bearing  cells  are reduced in number following 
cabiralizumab  treatment,  resulting  in a decrease of target -mediated  clearance.  Once target  
mediated  clearance is saturated  at high or repeat doses, cabiralizumab  clearance is similar to  
other human IgG antibodies.  
 
1.3.6.1.3 Clinical Safety  Summary  of Cabiralizumab  
1.3.6.1.3.1 Study  FPA008 -001 – Healthy Volunteers  and Rheumatoid Arthritis  
Thirty  six healthy  volunteers  and 18 RA subjects  received  cabiralizumab  in Study FPA008  001. 
No dose -limiting  toxicities  (DLTs) were reported  and no unexpected  treatment  related adverse 
events  (AEs) have been reported  from  RA subjects treated  with  three doses  up to 6 mg/kg.

1.3.6.1.3.2 Study  FPA008 -002 – Pigmented  Villonodular Synovitis  
Study FPA008 -002 is currently  ongoing and is evaluating cabiralizumab  as monotherapy in 
subjects  with  PVNS.  Details  relating  to safety  are included in the latest version of the 
cabiralizumab  IB (FivePrime,  2017). 
 
1.3.6.1.3.3 Study  FPA008 -003 – Advanced Cancers  
As of August  1, 2017, cabiralizumab -related  AEs  were reported  in 169 of 195 subjects  (87%) 
treated  Q2W  in Phase 1b of Study FPA008 -003. The AEs  reported in more  than  10% of the 
subjects  included:  CK increased  (77 subjects, 40%);  periorbital edema (73 subjects,  73%);  AST 
increased  (65 subjects,  33%); fatigue (61  subjects, 31%); ALT increased  and pruritus (32  
subjects  each,  16%); amylase increase and  rash (30 subjects  each,  15%); lipase increase (29  
subjects,  15%); nausea (27 subjects,  14%); and  LDH incr eased  (20 subject, 10%).  
 
Cabiralizumab -related  Grade 3 AEs  in Phase 1b were predominantly enzyme elevations  of CK 
(14 Grade 3 and  14 Grade 4 events),  LDH (one  Grade 3 and  one Grade 4 event),  Alkaline  
phosphate ([ALP] two Grade 3 events), ALT  (two  Grade 3 events),  and AST (10  Grade 3 
events).  Other  related  AEs that  were Grade 3 and  reported  in 2 or subjects  included 13 events  of 
amylase increased  (12 Grade 3 and  one Grade 4), 15 events  of Grade 3 lipase  increased  (14 
Grade 3 and one Grade 4), 11 events  of Grade 3 Fatigue, and three events  of Grade 3 
hypertension. 
 
T
wenty -six of 195 subjects  (13%) experienced  a cabiralizumab -related  SAE  in Phase 1b. The  
SAEs  reported  in two or more subjects  included: CK  increased  (three subjects,  3%),  brain  
edema,  pneumonitis, hyponatremia (two  subjects each,  1%). Also  SAEs  included one event of 
Grade 4 CK increased  (related  to cabiralizumab  and nivolumab), one event  of Grade 3 
autoimmune colitis  (related  to nivolumab), and  one event  of Grade 3 hypopit uitarism (related  to 
cabiralizumab  and nivolumab). 
 
Two Grade 5 SAEs  prior to study treatment  discontinuation have occurred in Phase 1a of Study 
FPA008 -003: one subject  had a Grade 5 pulmonary embolus (not  related)  and a Grade 5 
pneumonitis (related  to both drugs; refer  to Appendix 7 for management  recommendations  in 
cases  of pneumonitis) and  the other subject  had a Grade 5 hypoxic respiratory  failure secondary  
to pneumonia (not related).  Six Grade 5 SAEs  prior to study treatment discontinuation were 
reported  in Phase 1b of this study. These included 1 sudden cardiac death (unrelated), 1 death  
due to tumor thrombus  blocking a major blood vessel (unrelated),  2 patients  with respiratory  
failure (unrelated), 1 patient with  acute respiratory  distress  (related),  and 1 patient with acute 
respiratory  failure (related).  
Data from  the Phase 1 dose escalation  study of cabiralizumab  +/- nivolumab in advanced  solid  
tumors  was presented  at the Society  for Immunotherapy  of Cancer’s  2017 Annual Meeting.  
Cabiralizumab  administered  at 4 mg/kg  every  2 weeks  depleted  circulating  non- classical  
monocytes  and had a tolerable safety  profile when  administered  with or without nivolumab.  The 
most common  treatment -related  adverse events attributed  to cabiralizumab  were elevations  in 
LDH,  CK, and serum  transaminases  without  elevation  of bilirubin.  Grade  3-4 serum  enzyme  
elevations  occurred  in 9/24 (38%) patients on the cabiralizumab  monotherapy arm and  in 40/205

(20%) patients  on the cabiralizumab  plus nivolumab  arm.   All cases  of periorbital  edema except  
for one was  grade 1-2, occurring in 5/24 (21%) patients on the cabiralizumab  monotherapy arm 
and in 84/205 (41%) patients on the cabiralizumab  plus nivolumab  arm.   In heavily  pre-treated  
patients  with  pancreatic cancer,  durable clinical benefit was  observed in 5/31 (16%) patients with  
a confirmed ORR  of 13%.   All confirmed  responses occurred  in patients  with MSS disease who  
historically  have not received  benefit  from  anti-PD-1/PD -L1 agents  and a study of cabiralizumab  
plus nivolumab  with  or without chemotherapy  in pancreatic cancer  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is planned. 
 
 
1.3.6.2 Nivolumab  
 
1.3.6.2.1 Clinical Pharmacology Summary  of Nivolumab  
The pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of nivolumab  was studied in subjects  over a dose  range of 0.1 to 
20 mg/kg  administered  as a single dose or as  multiple  doses  of nivolumab  every  2 or 3 weeks.  
Based  on a population pharmacokinetic (PPK) analysis  using data from  patients with  various 
tumor types, including melanoma,  NSCLC,  and RCC and  a time  varying  CL model, nivolumab  
clearance was  shown to decrease over time,  with  a median  maximal reduction  from  baseline 
values  of approximately 25% resulting  in a geometric mean  steady  state clearance (CLs s) 
(% coefficient  of variation [CV%]) of 8.2 mL/h  [53.9%]. The decrease in CLss is not considered  
to be clinically  relevant. The geometric mean [CV%] volume of distribution  at steady  state (Vss)  
is 6.8 L (27.3%),  and elimination  half-life (t1/2) is  25 days (77.5%). Steady -state concentrations  
of nivolumab  were reached  by approximately 12 weeks  when administered  at 3 mg/kg  every  2 
weeks,  and systemic  accumulation  was approximately  3.7-fold. The  exposure to nivolumab  
increased  dose proportionally over the dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg  administered  every  2 
weeks.  The clearance of nivolumab  increased  with  increasing  body weight.  The PPK  analysis  
suggested  that the  following factors  had no clinically  important effect  on the  CL of nivolumab:  
age (29  to 87 years),  gender,  race,  baseline LDH,  PD-L1 status,  solid tumor type,  baseline tumor 
size, and  hepatic impairment.  
The effect  of renal  impairment on the CL  of nivolumab  was evaluated  in subjects with  mild  
(GFR  < 90 and ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73  m2; n=379), moderate (GFR  < 60 and  ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73  m2; 
n=179), or severe (GFR  <30 and ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73  m2; n=2) renal impairment  compared  to 
subjects  with  normal  renal  function  (GFR  ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73  m2; n=342) in the  PPK  analysis.  No 
clinically  important differences  in the CL  of nivolumab were found between subjects  with  mild  
or moderate renal  impairment and  subjects  with  normal  renal  function. Data from  subjects  with 
severe renal  impairment are too limited  to draw conclusions on this population [ 45]. 
 
1.3.6.2.2 Safety  Summary  of Nivolumab  
Overall,  the safety  profile  of nivolumab  monotherapy as well  as combination  therapy  is 
manageable and  generally  consistent  across  completed  and ongoing clinical  trials  with  no 
maximum tolerated  dose (MTD) reached  at any dose tested  up to 10 mg/kg. There was no pattern  
in the incidence,  severity, or causality  of AEs  to the  nivolumab  dose level.  Most AEs  were low - 
 
CA025 -007 Version  10  21 Mar -2022 
Confidential  Page  42 of 135 
  
  
 
grade (Grade  1 to 2) with  relatively  few related  high -grade  (Grade 3 to 4)  AEs.  Most high-grade 
events  were manageable  with the use of corticosteroids or hormone replacement  therapy  
(endocrinopathies) as instructed  in the management algorithms  provided in the Nivolumab 
Investigator’s Brochure. 
 
A total of 39 and  306 patients with  selected  recurrent  or treatment- refractory  malignancies  have  
been  treated  in a completed Phase 1 single -dose study (CA209001) and  an ongoing Phase 1 
multi- dose study (CA209003), respectively.  As the safety  profile  from  CA209003 to date is  
consistent with  that observed  for CA209001, only data from  the larger  and more recent  study,  
CA209003,  are presented  below. 
 
In CA209003 (n=306, including 129 patients  with  NSCLC),  as of the 05- Mar-2013 database 
lock,  drug- related  AEs  of any  grade occurred  in 75% of patients.  The most frequent  drug- related  
AEs occurring in at least 5% of patients  included fatigue (28%),  rash  (15%), diarrhea (13%), 
pruritus (11%),  nausea (9%),  decreased  appetite  (9%),  decreased  hemoglobin (6%),  and pyrexia 
(6%).  The majority  of events were low grade, with  Grade 3/4 drug- related  AEs  observed  in 17% 
of patients.  The most common Grade 3/4 drug- related  AEs  occurring in at  least  1% of patients  
were fatigue (2%),  pneumonitis (1%),  diarrhea (1%),  abdominal  pain (1%), hypophosphatemia 
(1%),  and lymphopenia (1%).  Drug -related  SAEs  occurred  in 14% of patients; 8%  were Grade 
3/4 including pneumonitis (1%) and  diarrhea (1%). The spectrum,  frequency, and severity  of 
drug- related  AEs were generally  similar across  the dose levels  tested.  A review of the safety  data 
by tumor type (RCC,  NSCLC,  metastatic castration -resistant  prostate  cancer  [mCRPC],  
colorectal  cancer [CRC],  and melanoma)  also did not show  any clinically  meaningful  differences  
in the proportion of patients with  AEs  noted  across  tumor type. 
 
Select  AEs  with  potential  immune -related  causality,  previously termed  “immune -related  adverse 
events” or “adverse events of special  interest”  were also  analyzed  taking into account  multiple  
events,  with rates  adjusted for treatment  duration. Most events  occurred  within the first  6 months  
of therapy; cumulative or novel toxicities were not observed with prolonged drug exposure. 
Nineteen  of 306 patients (6%) experienced Grade 3/4 treatment- related  select  AEs.  Fifty -two of 
230 patients  (23%) with  drug- related  AEs required management with  systemic  glucocorticoids 
and/or other immunosuppressive agents. Twenty -one of 52 (40%) resumed  nivolumab  therapy  
after toxicity  resolved,  while  the others  discontinued  therapy. 
 
Although  tumor progression was  the most common  cause of mortality,  there were 3 drug- related  
deaths  associated  with  Grade 3/4 pneumonitis. Pneumonitis (any  grade) occurred  in 12 of 
306 patients  (4%),  and Grade 3/4 pneumonitis occurred  in 4 patients  (1%),  with  clinical  
presentations  ranging from asymptomatic radiographic abnormalities  to progressive, diffuse  
pulmonary infiltrates  associated  with  cough,  fever, and/or dyspnea. No  clear relationship  
between  the occurrence of  pneumonitis and  tumor type, dose level,  or treatment duration was  
noted. In 9 of 12 patients, pneumonitis was  reversible after treatment  discontinuation and/or with 
immunosuppressive t herapy (glucocorticoids, infliximab,  or mycophenolate).

1.3.6.3 APX005M  
 
1.3.6.3.1 Clinical Pharmacology Summary  of APX005M  
APX005M is an  IgG1  humanized mAb  with  the S267E mutation  at the Fc region.  APX005M  
binds with  high affinity  to human CD40  (Kd = 1.2 × 10-10 M)  and monkey CD40  (Kd = 3.5 × 
10−10 M),  but does  not cross -react  with mouse or rat  CD40.  APX005M  blocks  the binding of 
CD40  to CD40L.  The APX005M binding epitope has been  mapped to 2 specific regions  on 
CD40.  These are 92TSEACESCVLHRSCSP107  and 125PCPVGFFSNVSSAFEKCHPW144.  
The region 92TSEACESCVLHRSCSP107  is known  as a CD40L binding domain. It has been  
shown  that CD40L -blocking antibodies  tend  to have more potent CD40  agonistic activities  than 
CD40L -non- blocking  antibodies [ 73]. 
 
The direct  cytotoxicity  effect  and the antibody effector functions  such as Antibody -dependent 
cellular phagocytosis  (ADCP)  of APX005M  were  determined  in CD40  positive human  
lymphoma xenograft  models in mice.  In human lymphoma Ramos  models, APX005M was  
capable of inhibiting  tumor growth in a dose -dependent manner, and  eradicated  established  
tumors  at 3 mg/kg  and 10 mg/kg.  A significant  anti-tumor effect  was also observed  in the 
rituximab -resistant  Namalwa model  [64]. These data suggest  t hat APX005M, as  a single agent, 
can induce potent growth inhibition of CD40 -expressing human  tumors.  
 
Preliminary  human  data shows that  APX005M  induces  a dose -dependent activation  of APCs  (as 
demonstrated  by increases  in expression  of activation  markers  such  as CD54, CD70,  CD80,  
CD86,  HLA -DR),  T cell activation  and increases  in circulating  levels  of IL12, INF-γ, TNF -α and 
IL6. 
 
1.3.6.3.2 Pharmacokinetics of APX005M  
Nonclinical pharmacokinetics  (PK) of APX005M were determined  in a Good Laboratory 
Practice (GLP) repeat -dose toxicology study using cynomolgus  monkeys. Weekly  intravenous 
(IV) administration  of 5 doses of APX005M  was well  tolerated  at 0.3, 3, and 30 mg/kg.  The PK  
properties  of APX005M  are typical  of other mAbs and comprise low clearance (average range of 
0.401–7.27 mL/h/kg),  small volume  of distribution  (average range of 57–80.1 mL/kg),  and long 
terminal half-life (average >66  hours at  3 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg).  Positive  anti-drug antibodies  
(ADA) titers  were observed  in all  animals  in the low-dose group (0.3 mg/kg) but not in the high - 
dose group (30  mg/kg) [16]. Based  on these  results,  the no observed  adverse effect  level  
(NOAEL)  was considered 30 mg/kg. 
 
There are limited  human  PK data with  APX005M  at this time.  Exposures  to APX005M at  dose 
levels  of 0.03 mg/kg  or less were for the most part below the limit of  quantitation  (BLOQ).  IV 
administration  of APX005M  at doses  between  0.1 and  1 mg/kg lead to rapid increase in serum  
concentrations,  reaching  a maximum just  after the end  of the infusion. Levels  declined  rapidly 
thereafter and  were for the most part  BLOQ between  24 and  168 hours after  the start  of dosing.

Increases  in the dose of APX005M (0.1  mg/kg  to 1 mg/kg) led  to approximately dose- 
proportional increases  in maximum serum  concentration  (Cmax)  and area under the curve at  the 
last measurable time  point (AUC0 –t). No accumulation of APX005M was  observed with every  
21 days dosing. 
 
1.3.6.3.3 Safety  Summary  of APX005M  
Study APX005M -001 is a first in human  phase 1 dose escalation  study of APX005M with  8 pre - 
planned  dose levels.  APX005M was  administered  to study subjects  at doses up to 1 mg/kg.  At 
the 1 mg/kg  dose level, 1 out of 6 dose limiting  toxicity  (DLT) -evaluable subjects experienced  a 
DLT  (grade 4 cytokine release syndrome). Two  additional subjects  at the 1mg/kg dose level  
experienced  serious adverse events  (SAE) in later cycles  (Grade 3 cytokine release syn drome  
and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia). On  May  2, 2016 Apexigen decided  to discontinue dose 
escalation  and enroll  up to 6 subjects  in dose level  0.6 mg/kg  (originally  designed as  an 
intermediate de -escalation  dose level) and  an additional 3 subjects  at the previously completed  
dose level  0.3 mg/kg  to better  characterize the safety  and pharmacodynamics (PDn) of 
APX005M and  to help  establish the  single agent recommended  phase 2 dose (RP2D).  The RP2D 
for APX005M as  a single  agent  every  21 days is 0.3 mg/kg  body weight. 
 
As of the data  cutoff  date of 14 April  2017, 432 AEs have been reported  in the 30 subjects enrolled  in 
Study APX005M -001. The majority  of AEs (371/432 [85.9%]) were  mild or moderate  (≤ Grade  2) in 
severity,  44 events (10.2%)  were  reported  as Grade  3, and 8 events (1.9%)  were  reported  as Grade  4. 
No Grade  5 events have  been reported. 
 
As of 14 August 2017, 17 SAEs had been reported  in 6 subjects.  With  the exception  of cytokine  
release  syndrome  and thrombocytopenia,  all SAEs were  considered  unrelated  to APX005M.  
Cytokine  release  syndrome  is an expected  on-target  side effect  of CD40  agonists.  No 
thromboembolic  or bleeding  events have  been reported  to date for APX005M. 
 
APX005M demonstrated  a dose-dependent activation of APCs  (as demonstrated  by increases  in 
expression of activation  markers  such  as CD54,  CD70, CD80,  CD86,  HLA -DR),  T cell  
activation  and increases  in circulating  levels  of IL12, INF-γ, TNF -α and IL6. 
 
For further details on the APX005M- 001 study please refer to latest version of the APX005M  
Investigator’s Brochure [ 64]. 
 
Symptoms  associated  with cytokine  release syndrome (including  but not limited  to flushing,  
itchiness, chills,  fever,  rash, tachycardia,  hypotension, hypertension, rigor,  and myalgia) after  
administration  of APX005M  are possible and  have been  observed in some of  the subjects  
receiving  APX005M.  Guidance for monitoring and management of cytokine release syndrome  
are includ ed in this protocol and  in the APX005M  Investigator’s Brochure. 
 
Transient  transaminase elevations  (≤ Grade 2) have  been  observed  in several subjects  with liver 
metastases,  which  were not associated  with a particular dose of APX005M. Six  subjects  with  
 
CA025 -007 Version  10  21 Mar -2022 
Confidential  Page  45 of 135 
  
  
 
liver metastases  enrolled  in the study experienced  a transient increase in total bilirubin.  Liver  
function test abnormalities  tend  to resolve to baseline within  7 days from  APX005M  
administration.  
 
Transient  decreases  in peripheral  blood lymphocyte count in general  and B-cell count in  
particular have been observed for  APX005M as  well as  for other CD40 -agonistic mAbs  and are 
believed  to be a PDn effect.  Transient decreases  in platelet counts were observed  for some of the 
subjects  receiving  higher doses of APX005M  but were not associated  with  bleeding or other  
clinical  manifestations.  
 
Other symptoms might also  occur, including allergic reactions,  which  could  be severe,  
pulmonary edema,  and rarely,  thromboembolic events, myocardial  infarction and/or death. 
In the ongoing Phase 1 study APX005M-001, APX005M demonstrated  a dose-dependent 
activation  of APCs,  T cell activation  and increases  in circulating  levels of  cytokines. 
 
The biological  effects  and the overall tolerability  of APX005M up to 1mg/kg body weight  
suggest a best in class  profile  for APX005M and  the possibility  of a safe and tolerable  
combination  with  other immunomodulatory antibodies such  as nivolumab. 
 
1.4 Clinical Experience Involving  Serum  Enzyme  Elevations  
 
The safety  and preliminary  efficacy  of cabiralizumab  is currently  being evaluated in 3 clinical  
trials.  A common  feature observed across  the clinical  trials  is an elevation  of AST,  CK, and LDH 
after the administration  of cabiralizumab.  These alterations  are the consequence of the direct  
effect  of anti -CSF1R  antibodies on the Kupffer cell in the  liver that  results  in a depletion  of these  
cells.  Depletion  of Kupffer cells  allows  the enzymes,  which  are released  following  normally  
occurring  liver cell turnover,  to enter  circulation  (where they  are measured  by routine laboratory 
assessment) rather than being  absorbed by the Kupffer cells.  Elevated  liver  enzymes,  thus, 
represent  a PD marker rather  than  a safety  signal.  The observed elevations  were asymptomatic  
not permanent  and not associated  with  clinical  sequelae.  Similar effects  have been  observed  
across  other CSF1R  targeted agents  (see cabiralizumab  IB for additional details).  There is a  
significant body of evidence from the cabiralizumab  preclinical  and clinical  experience as  well  
as from  others  in the field that  suggest elevations  of serum  enzymes  caused by inhibition of the 
CSF1R  pathway  are reversible and  are not associated  with  clinical  sequelae [ 66, 74-78 ]. 
 
1.4.1 Serum  Enzyme Elevations with  Cabiralizumab  
In Study FPA008 -003, 34 subjects  have been dosed as  part of Phase 1a dose  escalation  (24 in 
cabiralizumab  monotherapy and 10 in cabiralizumab  + nivolumab  combination therapy) and  195 
subjects  have been dosed as part of Phase 1b dose expansion as  of 1 August 2017. In Phase 1a,  
CK was elevated  in 11 of 34 subjects  (32%),  and 3 events  (1%)  were Grade 3 or higher. AST  
was elevated  in 16 of 34 subjects  (47%),  and 10 events (29%) were  Grade 3 or higher. ALT was  
elevated  in 4 of 34 subjects (17%),  and none of these  were Grade 3 or higher. In Phase 1b, CK  
was elevated  in 82 of 195 subjects  (42%),  and 29 events (15%) were Grade 3 or higher. AST was  
elevated  in 76 of 195 subjects (39%),  and 14 events (7%) were Grade 3 or higher. ALT was  
 
CA025 -007 Version  10  21 Mar -2022 
Confidential  Page  46 of 135 
  
  
 
elevated  in 39 of 195 subjects (20%),  and five events (3%) were Grade 3 or higher. 
The serum  enzyme elevations for Studies  FPA008 -001 and  FPA008 -002 follow  a similar pattern.  
 
Please refer to the  cabiralizumab  IB for more detailed information  about these  serum  enzyme 
elevations.  
 
1.4.2 Serum  Enzyme Elevations with  Nivolumab  
 
The hepatic  enzyme changes  caused  by cabiralizumab  and nivolumab  are due  to different  
mechanisms  that should not be  additive. For  cabiralizumab,  the elevations  are hypothesized  to be 
due to the on- target  effect  of Kupffer cell  reduction and  not to liver cell  toxicity.  Hepatic AEs,  
including possible drug induced liver injury (DILI)  cases,  have been managemable using an  
established  management algorithm  and thus do not meaningfully  alter the benefit/risk  of 
nivolumab  in the advanced  malignancy  populations.  Guidelines for managem ent and safety  
assessments focused  on the liver can  be found in  Section  4.8 and  Section  4.9. 
 
1.4.3 Serum  Enzyme Elevations in APX005M  
Transient  transaminase elevations  (≤ Grade 2) with APX005M administration  have been  
observed in several  subjects with  liver metastases,  which  were not associated with a particular  
dose of APX005M. Six  subjects with  liver metastases  enrolled  in the study experienced  a 
transient increase in total  bilirubin.  Liver  function test abnormalities  tend to resolve to baseline 
within  7 days from APX005M  administration.  Elevations of ALT,  AST,  CK, and  LDH were not 
associated  with  signs  or symptoms  of hepatic or muscle injury as demonstrated  by concurrent 
normal total bilirubin,  INR,  aldolase,  and troponin levels.  
 
Please refer to the  APX005M  Investigator’s Brochure for more  detailed  information about serum  
liver ezyme elevations  and their management, as outlined in Section  4.8 and  Section  4.9. 
Additional  laboratory abnormality  management algorithms  are included to  help  manage 
elevations  of CK  in Section  4.8 and  Section  4.9.

3. Investigational  Plan  
3.1 Study  Design  and Duration  
This study is a Phase 1/1b, open- label,  single institution, dose escalation  and dose expansion 
study to evaluate the efficacy,  safety,  and tolerability  of APX005M in combination with  
nivolumab  and cabiralizuma b in patients  with  advanced melanoma,  NSCLC,  and RCC.  
Nivolumab is a  fully  human monoclonal antibody  directed  against PD-1. Cabiralizumab  is a 
humanized  monoclonal antibody directed  against  CSF1R.  APX005M  is a humanized  IgG1  
agonistic monoclonal  antibody that binds CD40. 
 
Patients  will be sequentially  enrolled  in the phase 1 dose escalation  portion in 6 cohorts using a 
standard 3 + 3 design to  determine safety,  characterize the adverse events, and establish  the 
MTD of APX005M in combination with  cabiralizumab  and nivolumab. A minimum of  48 hours 
observation will  be required  after each  patient  is enrolled  in cohorts 1-6, before a subsequent 
patient  can be enrolled.  Approximately 3 patients will be enrolled  into each  cohort. Cohorts 1, 3, 
and 5 will  include cabiralizumab  at the fixed RP2D of 4 mg/kg  and dose escalation  of 
APX005M.  Cohorts 2, 4, and  6 will  include nivolumab at 240 mg, cabiralizumab  at 4 mg/kg,  
and dose escalation  of APX005M. 
 
All study drugs will  will be given  on Day 1 of each 14- day treatment cycle.   Pre-medications  will 
be given  before nivolumab.  Nivolumab will  be administered  as an IV infusion over 30 minutes  
first followed by a 30-minute break  and then cabiralizumab will  be administered  as an IV 
infusion over 30 minutes.  After another 30 -minute  break,  APX005M  will be administered  as an 
IV infusion over 60 minutes.  Patients  must remain  near the vicinity  of a hospital with  rapid  
access  to an  intensive care unit setting  during the initial 48 hour period  after treatment  for the 
first two treatment cycles.  
 
Dose escalation  will be based  on the number of DLTs  experienced  during the DLT evaluation  
interval as  determined  by the PI  and Industry Collaborators (see Sec tion 3.1.2.1.1 for DLT  
criteria).  The DLT  evaluation interval begins on the  first day of treatment  and continues for 28 
days. 
 
The phase 1b portion will  enroll  patients  in three cohorts (advanced  melanoma,  NSCLC,  and 
RCC)  to study the RP2D  of APX005M in combination with  nivolumab  and cabiralizumab.  
 
3.1.1 Screening  Period  
All screening  evaluations must be completed  and reviewed  by the Investigator for the enrollment  
process  to confirm  that patients  meet  all eligibility  criteria before  the first  infusion of study drug. 
Written  informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained  before performing  any 
study specific screening  tests or  procedures. Screening  assessments  will be performed  within  28 
days prior to the first  dose of study drug unless  otherwise specified.  
 
The Investigator may  repeat  qualifying lab tests and vitals/ECGs  prior to enrollment if a non- 
qualifying finding is considered  an error or an  acute finding is likely  to meet  eligibility  criteria  
upon repeat  testing.

 Study procedure- related  AEs  that occur after signing of the ICF and before  administration  of the 
first study drug dose will  be collected  during this period. 
 
3.1.2 Treatment  Period  
 
3.1.2.1 Phase 1 Cohorts  and Combination  Dose Escalation  Cohorts  
Phase 1 consists  of three dose escalation  cohorts of  APX005M  in combination  with  
cabiralizumab  alone,  and three dose- escalation  cohorts of APX005M in combination with  
nivolumab  and cabiralizumab.   A minimum of  3 patients  will be enrolled  in each  cohort. The  
planned  dose levels  and schedules  for the Phase 1 dose escalation  cohorts are as  follows  in Table

A minimum of  48 hours observation will  be required  after each  patient  is enrolled  in cohorts 1-6, 
before  a subsequent patient can  be enrolled.  As depicted  in Figure 6, accrual  to cohorts 2 and  3 
will only start after the last patient  in cohort 1 has been  observed  for toxicity  for at  least  two 14- 
day cycles  (28 days  in total); accrual  to cohort 4 will commence when  the last patients  on cohorts 
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  52 of 135 Confidential  
  
  
 
2 and  3 have been observed for at  least two  14-day cycles,  accrual  to cohort 5 will  commence  
only after the last  patient  on cohort 3 has  been observed for at  least two 14 day  cycles,  and 
accrual  to cohort 6 will accrue once the last patients on cohorts 4 and  5 have been  observed  for at  
least two 14-day cycles.  Doses  will be de- escalated  as determined by toxicities.  
 
Figure 6  
 
 
 
All dose  escalation  decisions will  be based  on assessment  of toxicity,  overall safety,  and 
tolerability.  Dose  escalation  decisions will be agreed  upon by the PIs  and study collaborators.  
Prior to initiating  each new  dose level  or expanding an existing  dose level,  a safety  
teleconference will  be held wherein  the PIs and study  collaborators  will review patient  data,  
including but not limited  to the available demographics,  dosing,  concomitant medications,  
hematology, serum chemistry,  and AEs; and  confer  and document  agreement that  dose escalation  
or expanding an existing  dose level  is considered appropriate. If the PIs  collectively  agree,  
following review of safety,  PK, and PD data (if available),  that a different  dose  escalation  
scheme should be used than the one outlined, this will be permitted.  Review of safety,  PK, and 
PD profiles may  inform decisions  to add  cohorts with alternative dose levels or  dose regimens  
(e.g., less  frequent  dosing) in order to reach  an optimal target  exposure. 
 
For the purpose of dose escalation,  we will require a 28 day observation  period  from  the 
time the last patient in a given cohort was treated.  For the purpose of calculating  the MTD,  
we will require a minimum  of 28 days of observation for  each  patient.  
 
Dose escalation  in Phase 1 will  proceed  as follows:  

 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  53 of 135 Confidential  
  
  
 
If none of the first  3 evaluable patients  in a dose  cohort experience a DLT in  the first  two cycles,  
then the next 3 patients  will be treated  at the next higher dose cohort.  If 1 of 3 patients  within  a 
cohort experiences  a DLT  in the first  two cycles,  then 3 additional patients  will be added to that 
cohort.  If a second patient experiences  a DLT  at that dose level in the first  two cycles,  the next 
cohort will  not be initiated,  and the dose of one or more drugs will be de- escalated.  Patients  at 
each dose level will  be evaluated  for at  least 28 days from  the start  of treatment before  additional 
patients  can be treated  at a higher dose  level.  If DLTs  are observed in 2 or more patients  within  
a cohort, the maximum tolerated  dose (MTD) will have been  exceeded  and no further patients  
will be treated  at that dose level.  
 
DLT  evaluation  and enrollment  decisions  will follow the guidance in Table 3.

an intermediate  dose level.  
1/6 Open  next cohort  
 
>2/6 Stop enrollment.  Enter  3 more  patients  at the lower  
dose level  at an intermediate  dose level.  
 
 
Dose escalation  will continue until either the MTD or maximum planned  dose  of APX005M is  
reached,  with a minimum of  3 patients  enrolled  in each  cohort. 
 
The MTD is defined  as the highest dose associated with  DLTs  in less  than  or equal to 33% of 
patients  receiving  APX005M in combination  with  cabiralizumab  or with cabiralizumab  and 
nivolumab,  administered  during the DLT period.  This will  normally  be the dose recommended  
for further study;  however, based  on review of safety,  PK, and PD (if available) data,  the RP2D 
could be lower than  the MTD.  If the MTD is not reached,  and the highest evaluated  APX005M  
dose in combination  with  cabiralizumab  and nivolumab  is well  tolerated,  the data will  be 
reviewed  to assess whether further dose escalations of  APX005M are warranted.  
 
In order to  calculate the  MTD and RP2D, every  patient  included in this calculation  must have 
received  at least 2 doses of study drugs and  have been  monitored for at  least 2 full  cycles  (28 
days).  If a patient does not receive 2 doses of study  drugs and does not complete  safety  
assessments (e.g., safety  lab and/or AE reporting) in the first  28 days for reasons other than drug-

related  AEs  (e.g., disease progression or withdrawal  of consent), then  an additional patient  will 
be enrolled  into the cohort so that  the cohort has at least  3 patients  evaluable for 28 days. All 
such discussions  and decisions will  be documented as  part of the dose escalation decision- 
making  process.  
 
3.1.2.1.1  Dose Limiting  Toxicity  
A DLT is defined as any of the following  AE (graded using National  Cancer  Institute [NCI]  
Common Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse Events [CTCAE]  v5.0), which  occurs  during the first  
28-days of cabiralizumab/APX005M  or nivolumab/cabiralizumab/APX005M  administration  
that is not clearly  due to  a cause other  than  the study  medication  (e.g.,  disease under study, car 
accident).  
 
1. Grade 4 neutropenia or grade 4 thrombocytopenia lasting  ≥ 7 days  
2. Neutropenic fever of any  duration 
3. Grade > 3 thrombocytopenia if  associated  with:  
a. Clinically  significant bleeding  or requirement  for platelet transfusion,  or 
b. A life-threatening  bleeding  event  which  results  in urgent  intervention and admission  to 
an Intensive Care Unit  
4. Any grade ≥3 non -hematologic toxicity  (not laboratory) with the exception  of: 
• Grade 3 tumor flare  (defined  as local  pain, irritation,  or rash  localized  at sites of  
known or suspected  tumor)  
• Grade 3 joint pain  
• Grade 3 fatigue lasting  less than  1 week  
• Serum  elevations  of CK  > 15X ULN and  < 20X ULN that  last for < 7 days  
• Grade 3 or Grade 4 electrolyte abnormalities  that are not complicated  by associated  
clinical  adverse experiences,  last less than 72 hours and  either resolve spontaneously 
or respond to conventional  medical  intervention  
• Grade 3 nausea,  vomiting,  or diarrhea lasting  less than 72 hours, and either  resolves 
spontaneously or responds to conventional medical  intervention  including  adequate 
anti-emetics  or other  supportive care  
• Grade 3 or grade 4 elevation  of amylase or lipase  not associated  with clinical  or 
radiographic evidence of pancreatitis  
• Grade 3 fever not associated  with  hemodynamic compromise (eg,  hypotension, 
clinical  or laboratory evidence of impaired  end-organ perfusion) 
• Grade 3 endocrinopathy that is well  controlled  by hormone replacement  
• Grade 3 infusion reaction that  returns  to Grade 1 in  < 6 hours 
 
 
5. Any Grade ≥ 3 non- hematologic laboratory value if:  
a. Immune suppression other than corticosteroids  is required  to treat the subject, or 
b. The abnormality  itself so ley leads to hospitalization,  or 
c. The abnormality  persists for >1 week. For AST/ALT > 12x ULN, DLT is defined as 
not improving after >7 days or the value increases  by more  than 5X ULN over 72 hours; 
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022

 e.g. if an AST of 300 rises to 500 in 72 hours, where  AST  36 is ULN,  a rise of 200 is 
greater than  5X ULN (180) and  would  be considered  a DLT  
6. Any Grade ≥  3 AST/ALT elevation  combined with total bilirubin  >2x ULN (for patients  with 
Gilbert’s  syndrome, use bilirubin  > 2X baseline)  or INR > 1.5 not on warfarin  
7. Failure  to recover  from  a treatment -related  AE to baseline or ≤ Grade  1 within  12 weeks  of last 
dose of investigational product (except  Grade 2 alopecia and  Grade 2 fatigue)  
8. Any death  not clearly  due to the underlying malignancy  or extraneous causes  (e.g. car accident)  
9. Recurrence of Grade 4 rash,  or other Grade 3 immune -related  AE (irAE),  or Grade 4 infusion- 
related  AE. Recurrent  grade 3 infusion reactions  should be discussed  with  the study PI. 
10. Any toxicity requiring   dose  reduction  of  APX005M  or  permanent  discontinuation  of 
any of the study drugs. 
 
irAE is defined as  a clinically  significant AE that  is associated  with  study drug exposure, with  the 
exception  of AEs  related  to cytokine release,  attributable to APX005M,  and is consistent with   
an immune -mediated  mechanism.  
 
 
Certain  toxicities, even if  already  resolved,  will make it unacceptable to advance to subsequent 
cohorts as  planned,  including but not limited  to: 
 
• Grade 4 myocarditis;  Grade 3 myocarditis  will need to be discussed  with  the study PI 
• Grade 3 neurotoxicity with the exception  of peripheral  neuropathy 
• Grade 4 pneumonitis 
• Bone marrow  aplasia  
 
 
3.1.2.2 Phase 1 Dose Escalation  Extended  Treatment  Period  
 
Patients  from  the Phase 1 dose escalation  combination cohorts are allowed  to continue to receive 
APX005M in combination  with  nivolumab  and/or cabiralizumab  at the same  dose levels  until 
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity,  or other reason  for treatment discontinuation. 
 
If a complete  response (CR)  is achieved,  patients  will be allowed  to continue on therapy until 
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity,  or other reason  for treatment discontinuation. 
 
3.1.2.3 Phase 1b Expansion Cohorts  
To further characterize safety  and efficacy  of APX005M  in combination  with  nivolumab  and 
cabiralizumab,  Phase 1b will  enroll  patients  of 3 advanced cancer types:  melanoma,  NSCLC,  and 
RCC. Enrollment  in Phase 1b will  begin  when an  RP2D for APX005M  has been  identified  based  
on overall safety,  tolerability,  PK, and PD (if available) data.  
 
During enrollment  of any  expansion cohort, if  the observed number of responses makes  it 
unlikely to achieve a target response rate for that  indication, then further recruitment  to that 
cohort may  be suspended or terminated.  
 
3.1.3 End-of-Treatment  Follow -up Period  
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  56 of 135 Confidential  
  
  
All patients  should return  to the clinic 28 (±7) days and  100 (±7) days  from  their last dose of 
study drug to complete the  End-of-Treatment  Follow -up Period,  irrespective of whether a patient  
is discontinued from  the study drug at a planned visit or  mid-cycle.  AEs  will be  assessed  until 
resolution,  return  to baseline,  or are stabilized  per treating Investigator’s assessment.  Adverse 
event  reporting  will continue until 100 (±7) days  after the last  dose of study drug or until 
initiation  of subsequent  anti-cancer therapy.  
 
3.1.4 Long -Term Follow -up 
Patients  should continue onto Long -Term  Follow -up after  completing  the End -of-Treatment  
Follow-up Period.  
 
Patients  will be followed  every  12 weeks  for survival, or more frequently as needed.  Patients  
who discontinue treatment  while showing  clinical  benefit  (CR,  partial  response [PR], or stable  
disease [SD]) should have tumor assessments during these  visits for duration of response.  
 
Long -term Follow -up for survival may  be conducted  by telephone,  rather than by an in-person 
visit, once tumor progression is determined  or use of subsequent  anti-cancer  therapy  has been  
initiated.  During  the Long -Term  Follow -up Period, if the patient  undergoes local  therapy  (e.g., 
resection,  radiation) or new  systemic therapy  is initiated, this should be documented. 
 
3.1.5 Study  Duration  
Patients  who  receive study  drug(s) may  continue as long as they  experience clinical  benefit in the  
opinion of the Investigator or until unacceptable toxicity  or symptomatic deterioration  attributed  
to disease progression as  determined  by the Investigator after an  integrated  assessment  of 
radiographic data, biopsy results  (if available),  and clinical  status,  or withdrawal  of consent. The  
maximum time allowed  time on study treatment  will be  up to 2 years  unless the study is 
terminated  sooner by the Sponsor. 
 
3.1.6 Stopping  Rules  
 
3.1.6.1 Stopping  Rules  for All Cohorts  
Management  of drug-related  toxicities and  laboratory  abnormalities  will follow the guidelines 
outlined in Section  4.8 and  Section  4.9. 
 
The Sponsor will  discuss  such cases  with the Industry Collaborators  as appropriate to determine 
further enrollment.  IRBs  may be notified  by the Sponsor of all  cases  and decisions regarding  
continued enrollment,  according  to applicable  regulatory requirements  or institution procedures. 
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  57 of 135 Confidential  
  
  
3.1.6.2 Treatment Beyond Progression  
Accumulating clinical  evidence indicates  that the  emergence of objective responses  to agents that 
activate anti -tumor immune  responses may  follow delayed  kinetics  of weeks  or months, and  can 
be preceded  by initial apparent  progression of disease with  the appearance  of new lesions  or 
some enlarging of lesions while certain  index  lesions  are regressing  (“mixed response”).  
Therefore,  it is reasonable  to allow patients  who  experience apparent  progression to continue to  
receive treatment  until progression is confirmed at  the next imaging  assessment.  These  
considerations should be balanced  by clinical  judgment  as to whether the patient is clinically  
deteriorating and unlikely to receive any  benefit  from continued treatment.  
 
Such  deterioration will  be assessed  to have occurred  after a clinical  event  that,  in the 
Investigator’s opinion, is attributable to disease progression and  is unlikely to reverse with  
continued study treatment and  therefore indicates  that the patient  is not benefiting from study 
treatment  and cannot be managed  by the addition of supportive care.  The decision to continue 
treatment  should be discussed with  the PI. 
3.2 Study  Population  
3.2.1 Planned  Number of Patients  
 
In the Phase 1 dose escalation  portion of the trial, we will  enroll at  least  3 patients per cohort. 
There are a total of 6 cohorts.  In the Phase 1b portion, a Simon two stage design  will be used.  
At least  13 patients  per each  disease cohort (advanced  melanoma,  NSCLC,  and RCC)  will be 
enrolled  in the first  phase and  in the second  phase,  an additional 21 patients  per disease cohort, 
for a maximum of  34 patients  per disease cohort, are expected  to be enrolled, for a total of 102 
subjects.

loco-reginal  therapy,  are not considered  measurable unless there has been  demonstrated  
progression in the lesion. 
15. Prior focal  radiotherapy must be  completed  before  first dose of study drug administration,  
although palliative  radiation  may be allowed  on treatment  (see permitted  concomitant 
therapies  below). Radiation  to pulmonary or intestinal sites must  be completed  at least 4

corticosteroid  replacement therapy  for adrenal  or pituitary  insufficiency, etc.)  is not 
considered a form  of systemic  treatment.  
 
9. Pregnancy  or breast  feeding.   Should a woman  become pregnant  or suspect  she is pregnant  
while participating  in this study, she should inform her treating  physician immediately.  
Because there is an  unknown but potential risk  for adverse events in nursing infants 
secondary  to treatment  of the mother with  nivolumab, cabiralizumab  or APX005M, 
breastfeeding  must be discontinued if the mother is  enrolled  on this trial.

menarche and  who  have not undergone surgical  sterilization  (hysterectomy, bilateral  tubal  
ligation,  or bilateral  oophorectomy), and  who are not post -menopausal. Post-menopause is 
defined  as: 
• Amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive months without another cause,  and a documented serum  
follicle stimulating  hormone (FSH) level >35  mIU/mL,  or 
• Women with  irregular menstrual  periods and  a documented serum  FSH level

practicing  abstinence or who have a sterile  (e.g., vasectomy) partner should be  considered to be  
of childbearing  potential  [79, 80].  
 
3.3 Concomitant Medications  
All medications  taken  within 28 days  before the administration  of the first  dose  of any  study drug 
and all concomitant therapy  administered  during the study until 100 (±7) days after last dose of 
any study drug (or until initiation  of subsequent anti -cancer therapy) will  be collected.  All 
subsequent  anti-cancer therapy  will be collected  in the Long- Term  Follow -up Period.  
 
Information on all  prior treatments  indicated  for advanced cancer,  including chemotherapy,  
biochemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation,  surgery,  biologic,  and experimental  therapy  will be 
collected.  
 
No concomitant  medication  information  will be collected  following  patient  discontinuation  from  
the study except  for concomit ant medication  use associated  with  study drug- related  AEs or AEs  
that lead  to discontinuation  from  the study. 
 
3.3.1 Prohibited  and/or Restricted  Treatments  
The following medications are prohibited  during the study (unless utilized to  treat  a drug- related  
AE or specified  in the eligibility  section):  
• Immunosuppressive agents 
• Immunosuppressive doses of systemic  corticosteroids  
• Vaccines  except  as noted  in Sec tion 3.3.2  
• Statins  for treatment  of hypercholesterolemia.  Statins  will be allowed  only if the patient  is 
on a stable dose for over 3 months prior to the study  and has a stable status  without any  
CK elevations  
• O ther therapies  including biologic,  immunotherapy,  extensive non -palliative radiation  
therapy, standard treatments, or  investigational agents or devices  
 
3.3.2 Permitted  Therapy  
Patients  are permitted  to use of topical,  ocular,  intra-articular,  intranasal,  and inhaled  
corticosteroids  (with  minimal  systemic absorption). Adrenal replacement  steroid doses  >10 mg  
daily  prednisone are permitted. A  brief (less  than 3 weeks)  course of corticosteroids  for 
prophylaxis  (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of  non- autoimmune  conditions 
(e.g., delayed -type hypersensitivity reaction caused  by a contact  allergen) and also  for the 
treatment  of tumor -related  AE is permitted.  
 
Concomitant  palliative and  supportive care for disease- related  symptoms (including 
bisphosphonates and  RANK -L inhibitors) is allowed.  Transfusions are permitted as  needed.  
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  63 of 135 Confidential  
  
  
 
The inactivated  seasonal  influenza vaccine can  be given to patients  while on therapy  without 
restriction.  Influenza vaccines containing live virus or other clinically  indicated  vaccinations  for 
infectious diseases  (i.e., pneumovax, varicella,  etc.)  must be discussed  with the  Investigators and  
Industry Collaborators.  In general,  live vaccines are prohibited  within  30 days  prior to start of 
study drugs and  within  the first 12 cycles  on study. 
 
Palliative radiation  or metasta sectomy  is allowed;  these lesions  will are not subsequently be 
included for tumor measurements.  
 
Concomitant  use of statins  will be allowed  only if the patient  is on a stable  dose  for over 
3 months prior to the study  and is in stable status  without any  CK elevations. 
 
3.4 Long -Term Follow -up 
Patients  who  discontinue treatment  while still receiving  clinical  benefit  (i.e., CR, PR or SD) 
should get  follow-up tumor scans  every  12 (±2) weeks  until disease progression or use of 
subsequent  anti-cancer therapy  to determine the duration of response, unless  consent  is 
withdrawn. 
 
Long -Term  Follow -up for  survival may  be conducted by telephone,  rather than by an in-person 
visit, once tumor progression is determined  or use of subsequent  anti-cancer  therapy  has been  
initiated.

4.3 Method  of Assigning  Patient Identification  
Patients  must be able to provide written  informed consent and  meet  all eligibility  criteria.  No 
waivers  of inclusion or exclusion criteria will be granted  by Sponsor or its  designee for any  
patient  enrolled  in the study. Before enrolling a patient, all  eligibility  criteria must be satisfied.  
 
See Section  4.4.1 and  Figure 6 for dosing schema.   Patients  who  qualify for Phase 1 dose 
esclation  of the study will be enrolled  as follows:  
• Cohort 1 will  be enrolled  first and these patients  will be  followed  one 14- day cycle.  
• Once the DLT  follow -up period of 28 days is cleared  for Cohort  1, simultaneous  
enrollment  to Cohort 2 and  Cohort 3 will  occur.  Patients  in these cohorts will be  treated  
for a total of one 14- day cycle.  
• Simultaneous  enrollment into Cohort 4 and  Cohort 5 will  proceed  once the 14- day DLT  
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  67 of 135 Confidential  
  
  
 
period for dose escalation  is cleared  in the preceeding  Cohorts 2 and  3. 
• Once the DLT  period of 28 days for dose escalation  is cleared  Cohorts 4 and 5, 
enrollment  to the final  Cohort 6 will  occur.  
• The MTD will  be calculated  for patients  who have received  at least 2 cycles  (at least 28 
days) of study drug. 
• Dose escalation  into sequential  dose levels  of APX005M in combination  with  
cabiralizumab  and nivolumab  may  proceed until DLTs  are observed either in  the 
cabiralizumab/APX005M  doublet  therapy  cohorts 1, 3, and  5 or in the 
nivolumab/cabiralizumab/APX00 5M triplet therapy  cohorts after discussion  and 
agreement  between  the PIs and Industry Collaborators. 
 
In Phase 1b, a maximum of  34 patients  will be enrolled  per disease- specific  cohort (advanced  
melanoma,  NSCLC,  or RCC). Enrollment will  be open for all  cohorts in parallel  and will 
continue until the  enrollment  target  is reached.  Once  a disease cohort is filled,  further enrollment  
will be restricted  to the  cohort(s) that  have not been filled.  A total of approximately  102 patients  
will be enrolled  in the Phase 1b arm  of the study. 
 
4.4 Study  Drug  Dosing  and Dose Modification  
 
4.4.1 Dosing  
 
Dosing  calculations  should be based  on the body weight  assessed  at Cycle  1 Day  1 prior to the 
first dose of study drug administration.  It is not necessary  to recalculate subsequent doses if the 
patient’s  weight  is within  10% of the weight  used  to calculate the previous dose. All  doses 
should be rounded to the nearest  milligram.  
 
Patients  should be carefully  monitored  for infusion reactions  during study drug administration.  If 
an acute infusion  reaction is noted,  patients  should be managed  according to the guidelines in  
Section  4.8 and  Section  4.9.  Patients  must remain  near the vicinity  of a hospital with rapid  
access  to an  intensive care unit setting  during the initial 48 hour period  after treatment  for the 
first two treatment cycles.  
 
All vials are for single use only. Further instructions  on study drug preparation and  
administration  are provided in the Pharmacy  Manual.  
 
Please refer to the  study schema for dosing as  follows:  
 
• Phase 1 Dose Escalation  (Dosing  on Day  1 of each  14-day cycle):  
 
o Cohort 1:  Cabiralizumab  4 mg/kg  + APX005M  0.03 mg/kg  
 
o Cohort 2:  Nivolumab 240 mg + Cabiralizumab  4 mg/kg  + APX005M  0.03 mg/kg  
 
o Cohort 3:  Cabiralizumab  4 mg/kg  + APX005M  0.1 mg/kg

o Cohort 5:  Cabiralizumab  4 mg/kg  + APX005M  0.3 mg/kg  
 
o Cohort 6:  Nivolumab 240 mg + Cabiralizumab  4 mg/kg + APX005M  0.3 mg/kg  
• Phase 1b (Dosing on Day 1 of each  14-day cycle):  
 
o ALL  patients:  Nivolumab  240 mg + Cabiralizumab  4 mg/kg  + APX005M  at the  
RP2D 
 
4.4.1.1 Nivolumab Dosing 
The following patients on the trial will  receive nivolumab as  follows:  
 
• Phase 1: 
o Cohorts 1, 3, and  5: will NOT receive nivolumab  
o Cohorts 2, 4, and  6: nivolumab  240 mg IV  
 
• Phase 1b: 
o All patients  will receive nivolumab  240 mg IV  as the first  drug in sequence  
Nivolumab will  be dosed  as a 30- minute  IV infusion on Day 1 of each  14-day treatment  cycle as  
above. 
 
Routine premedication  administered  30 minutes  prior to nivolumab  should include: 
 
• H1 antagonist  (e.g.  Benadryl 25 mg  PO) 
• Oral or IV  H2 antagonist  (e.g., ranitidine 150−300 mg, cimetidine 300−800  mg, 
nizatidine  150−300 mg,  and famotidine 20−40 mg) 
• Oral nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drug (may  comprise ibuprofen 400 mg  or 
equivalent) 
• Acetaminophen  650 mg  
If a grade 1-2 infusion reaction  is observed during the proposed  infusion rate of nivolumab 240 
mg over 30 minutes,  the infusion rate will be extended  to 60 minutes .  Nivolumab should be 
held for a grade 3 infusion reaction and retreatment should be discussed with study PI.  
Nivolumab should be discontinued for a grade 4 infusion reaction. 
 
There will  be no dose escalations  or reductions of nivolumab  allowed.  Refer to the Pharmacy  
Manual for nivolumab  preparation  instruction s. 
 
4.4.1.2 Cabiralizumab  Dosing 
All patients  in all  cohorts of the trial will receive cabiralizumab.  
 
Cabiralizumab  will be administered  as a fixed dose of 4 mg/kg  given  over 30 minutes  by IV 
infusion.  In phase 1 dose escalation  cohorts 1, 3, and 5, cabiralizumab  will be given  first 
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  69 of 135 Confidential  
  
  
 
followed by APX005M.   In this case,  premedications  outlined  in Section  4.4.1.1  should be given  
30 minutes  prior to cabiralizumab  on Day 1 of each  14-day treatment  cycle.  
 
In phase 1 dose  escalation  Cohorts 2, 4, and  6, and in all  patients  on the  phase 1b portion of the 
trial, cabiralizumab  will be administered  30 minutes  after the end of the nivolumab  infusion, on 
Day 1 of each  14-day treatment cycle.  
 
If any Grade 3 or higher infusion reaction  is observed  during the proposed infusion rate of 
cabiralizumab  4 mg/kg  over 30 minutes,  cabiralizumab should be discontinued permanently. For 
further management of  infusion reactions, please see Section 4.8 and  Section  4.9. 
 
A research  pharmacist (or other responsible personnel) will  prepare the solution for 
administration.  After calculating  the number of vials, based  on the patient’s  weight,  the study 
drug product will  be diluted  with  0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.  Prepa red cabiralizumab  
should be administered  within  6 hours after preparation  (ambient  temperature).  The IV 
administration  setup  for cabiralizumab  infusion must contain  a 0.2 or 0.22 µm in -line filter or a 
0.2 or 0.22 µm syringe filter.  Cabiralizumab  will be administered  under medical  supervision as  a 
30 minute (±  5 minutes) IV  infusion via a peripheral vein  or central  venous catheter.  No 
incompatibilities  between  cabiralizumab  infusion and  polyvinyl  chloride (PVC),  
ethylene/propylene IV components, or glass  bottles have been  observed. 
 
4.4.1.3 APX005M Dosing  
All patients  in all  cohorts of the trial will receive APX005M as  follows:  
 
•
 Phase 1: 
o Cohorts 1 and  2:  APX005M  0.03 mg/kg  
o Cohorts 3 and  4:  APX005M  0.1 mg/kg  
o Cohorts 5 and  6:  APX005M  0.3 mg/kg  
 
• Phase 1b: 
o At the determined  RP2D 
 
APX005M is administered  on Day 1 of each  14-day treatment cycle approximately 30 minutes  
following cabiralizumab  using a 60 minute IV  infusion. A window between  -5 minutes  and +10 
minutes  is permitted  (i.e., infusion time  is 55 minutes  to 70 minutes).  
 
Premedication  should have already  been  administered  30 minutes  prior to first dose of study 
drug, as described  in Section 4.4.1.1.  When the time between  premedication  and scheduled  
APX005M administration  exceeds  4 hours, patients may  receive an  additional course of 
premedication prior to APX005M administration.  
 
The APX005M  infusion can be interrupted  in the  case of a grade 1-2 infusion reaction  (see 
Section  4.8 and Section  4.9). Once symptoms resolve, infusion should be  restarted  at 50% of the 
initial infusion rate (e.g.,  from  50 mL/hr  to 25 mL/hr).   For a grade 3 infusion reaction, APX005M 
should be held and the investigator should dose reduce with the next cycle.  Grade 4 infusion 
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  70 of 135 Confidential  
  
 reactions require discontinuation of APX005M.  
 
The Pharmacy  Manual contains specific instructions for the preparation  of the APX005M  
infusion and  administration  of infusion solution. 
 
4.5 Blinding/Unblinding  
This is an  open- label  study  and there will  be no blinding or unblinding of patients during this 
study.  
 
4.6 Dose Modifications,  Delays or Discontinuation  
Doses  of study drugs may be interrupted,  delayed,  or discontinued depending on how the patient  
tolerates  the treatment.   Dose reductions for nivolumab and cabiralizumab  are not permitted.  
Dose reduction  for APX005M is permitted  as per Section 4.8 and  Section  4.9. 
 
If there is  an infusion reaction  or other unforeseen delay  that makes  dosing of  APX005M 
impractical  on the same day  as nivolumab  and cabiralizumab, the patient may  be infused with  
APX005M the following  day at the discretion  of the  Investigator. 
 
Administration  of nivolumab, cabiralizumab  and/or APX005M combination  therapy  should be 
skipped for the following reasons : 
• The treating physician determines that the patient would benefit from a break in 
treatment due to non- life threaten ing grade 1-2 toxi cities such as fatigue, 
arthralgias or edema.  
• Any drug- related  laboratory abnormalities would  not require a dose delay  unless 
clinically  indicated  or specified  in the protocol or abnormal laboratory management 
guidelines (see Section  4.8 and  Section  4.9). Please discuss with  the PI  as needed.  
• For dose delays  or modifications  for all  other AEs  please refer  to the AE management  
guidelines in Section  4.8 and  Section  4.9. 
 
If the  causality  of the AE  requiring a dose delay  is confirmed to be due to one of three study 
drugs, then the non-offending drug may be continued per protocol taking  into account  the safety  
and clinical  benefit to the  patient.  
 
4.7 Criteria  to Resume Treatment with  APX005M, Cabiralizumab  and Nivolumab  
Patients  may  resume treatment with  APX005M,  cabiralizumab  and/or nivolumab when  the drug- 
related  AE resolves  as noted in Section  4.8 and  Section  4.9. 
 
A new treatment cycle should be initiated  only  if all toxicities  are ≤ Grade 1 except:  
• Grade 2 neuropathy lasting  shorter than  28 days (hold nivolumab  only) 
• Grade 2 alopecia 
• Grade 2 rash or other skin toxicity 
• Grade 2 hypophysitis/endocrinopathies  
• Grade 2 fatigue 
• Grade 2-3 neutropenia/lymphopenia 
• CK increase up to 15x ULN  
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  71 of 135 Confidential  
  
 • AST/ALT ≤ 12x ULN for ≤ 7 days  with  bilirubin  <2x ULN 
 
If a subject  fails  to meet  these retreatment  criteria then the treatment  cycle should be skipped . 
The PI  can be contacted  at any time if further clarification  is needed.  
 
4.8 Management of Adverse Events  and Supportive Care  Guidelines  
Immuno -oncology  agents  are associated  with  AEs  that can differ in severity  and duration 
compared  to AEs  caused  by other therapeutic classes.  APX005M,  cabiralizumab  and nivolumab  
are considered  immuno -oncology agents  in this protocol. Early  recognition  and management  of 
AEs associated  with  immuno -oncology agents  may  mitigate severe toxicity. Subjects  should 
receive appropriate supportive care measures  as deemed  necessary  by the treating Investigator. 
Suggested  supportive care measures  for the management of  AEs  with potential  immunologic  
etiology  are outlined  below. These treatment  guidelines are intended to be applied when  the 
Investigator determines the  events  to be related  to the APX005M + cabiralizumab  ± nivolumab  
combination  and should not substitute  for investigational  product dose delays and/or 
modifications.  Additional  guidance for management of  AEs  with potential immunologic etiology 
is provided in the  APX005M,  cabiralizumab  and nivolumab Investigator’s Brochures. 
 
If after evaluation  the event is determined  by the Investigator not to be  related  to investigational 
products, the Investigator does not need  to follow the  treatment  guidance outlined in this section.  
 
For each  disorder, attempts should be made to rule  out other causes  such as  metastatic disease,  or 
bacterial/viral infection, which  might  require additional supportive care.  
 
Steroid  tapering  may be necessary  for prolonged exposures to corticosteroids,  or if symptoms  
worsen  when  the corticosteroid  dose is decreased.  
 
Diarrhea/Colitis  
Subjects  should be carefully  monitored  for signs  and symptoms  of enterocolitis (such  as diarrhea,  
abdominal pain,  blood or mucus in stool, with  or without fever) and  of bowel perforation  (such  
as peritoneal signs  and ileus).  All  subjects  who  experience diarrhea/colitis  should be advised  to 
drink liberal  quantities of clear  fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid  intake is not feasible,  fluid  and 
electrolytes  should be substituted via  IV infusion. For Gra de 2 or higher diarrhea, consider GI  
consultation and  endoscopy to confirm  or rule out  colitis.  
• Grade 1-2: for subjects  developing Grade 1–2 diarrhea loperamide (2  mg every  2 hours) 
is strongly recommended  at the first  onset  of symptoms. For subjects  with persistent  
diarrhea despite the use  of loperamide (>7 days or recurrent) or Grade 2 colitis, the use of 
oral corticosteroids  (0.5–1 mg/kg/day  methylprednisolone or oral  equivalent) is  
recommended.  Other  antidiarrheal  agents  (e.g. octreotide) may  be used if necessary.  
When symptoms  improve to Grade 1, steroids may be tapered as  deemed  appropriate by 
the investigator. If steroids are administered  for over  weeks,  consider prophylactic 
antibiotics  for opportunistic infections.  If symptoms worsen  or persist >5  days despite 
steroids treatment,  treat  as grade 3 -4. 
• Grade 3-4: treat with  corticosteroids  (1–2 mg/kg/day  methylprednisolone  or IV 
equivalent) followed by  oral corticosteroids  until symptoms  improve to Grade 1 or less. 
Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections  and consider lower  endoscopy. 
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  72 of 135 Confidential  
  
  
 
If persist  or recurs  continuously after improvement,  consider infliximab 5mg/kg (unless  
sepsis  or perforation is detected).  
 
Creatinine Elevation  
• Grade 2-3: treat with corticosteroids (0.5–1 mg/kg/day  methylprednisolone or oral 
equivalent) until symptoms  improve to Grade 1 or less. Consider renal  biopsy with 
nephrology consult.  If persist >  14 days treat as grade 4. 
• Grade 4: treat  with  corticosteroids  (1–2 mg/kg/day  methylprednisolone or IV  equivalent) 
followed by oral corticosteroids until symptoms  improve to Grade 1 or less . Consider 
renal  biopsy and consult  nephrologist. Add prophylactic antibiotics  for opportunistic 
infections. If worsen  consider clinical  referrals  as needed.  
 
Pneumonitis  
• Grade 2: Treat  with  IV or oral corticosteroids  until symptoms  improve to Grade 1 or 
less. Consider prophylactic antibiotics  for opportunistic infection. Consider 
bronchoscopy, lung biopsy and hospitalization.  If does not improve after 2 weeks  treat as 
grade 3 -4. 
• Grade 3-4: Consider pulmonary or infectious disease consults.  Hospitalize and  treat  
immediately  with IV corticosteroids  (2–4 mg/kg/day  methylprednisolone or IV 
equivalent). Add  prophylactic antibiotics  for opportunistic infections. Consider 
bronchoscopy and lung biopsy.  If does not improve after 48h or worsens,  add additional 
anti-inflammatory  measures  (e.g.  cyclosporine, IVIG,  mycophenol ate mofetil)  
 
Liver Function  Tests  
• Grade 3 transaminitis: Monitor liver function  tests more frequently until returned  to 
Grade 2 or less.   Start  oral or IV corticosteroids  if transaminitis  > 5 to ≤ 12x ULN persists  
for > 7 days.   Continue steroids  until returns  to Grade 1 or less.  If the first  transaminase 
value is 12X ULN or greater,  start steroids immediately.  
 
• Grade 4 ALT  and/or AST  elevations, or grade 4 bilirubin  increase: Treat with  IV 
corticosteroids  for 24-48 hours followed  by oral corticosteroids until improvement  to 
Grade 1 or less.  If worsening in 3-5 days, administer additional immunosuppressive 
measures  (e.g.  mycophenolate mofetil), as  needed. Consider adding prophylactic 
antibiotics  for opportunistic infections.  Consult gastroe nterologist. 
 
• Grade ≥2 transaminitis  (>3x ULN) and total bilirubin  >2x ULN: Treat  with  IV 
corticosteroids  (1–2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or IV equivalent) followed  by oral 
corticosteroids.  Consider adding prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections. 
Consult gastroenterologist.  Continue steroids  until symptoms  improve to  Grade 1 or less.  
If worsening in 3-5 days, add  mycophenolate mofetil 1g  BID.  If no improvement 
consider additional immunosuppressive measures  per local  guidelines. 
 
Endocrinopathy  
• Asymptomatic TSH elevation: monitor fT4  if TSH is <0.5  x LLN,  > 2 x ULN or 
consistently  out of range  in two  subsequent measurements.  
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  73 of 135 Confidential  
  
  
 
Symptomatic endocrinopathy: evaluate endocrine function. For  abnormal laboratory 
results  initiate hormone repletion. 
• Suspicion  of adrenal  crisis: rule out sepsis,  administer  IV fluids, treat  as for 
symptomatic endocrinopathy.   Otherwise,  administer stress  dose  of IV steroids with  
mineralocorticoid  activity.  
 
Skin Adverse Events.  
• Grade 1-2: symptomatic treatment (e.g.  antihistamines,  topical steroids).  If unresponsive, 
consider steroid burst.  If worsens treat as grade 3-4. 
• Grade 3-4: Consider skin biopsy. Treat  with steroids  as deemed  appropriate by the 
treating  physician (1–2 mg/kg/day  methylprednisolone or IV equivalent). 
 
Infusion  Reaction/Cytokine Release Syndrome  
Precautions  should be observed  during the administration  of APX005M,  nivolumab  and 
cabiralizumab.  Emergency  agents including oxygen, oral  and endotracheal  airways,  intubation  
equipment  epinephrine, antihistamines,  and corticosteroids should be available and  used if 
required  at the Investigator’s discretion.  
 
Subjects  should be instructed  that symptoms  associated  with  cytokine release syndrome/infusion 
reaction  can occur  within  48 hours following the administration  of the investigational  products, 
and if such symptoms develop while they  are at  home, they should contact  the Investigator 
and/or seek  emergency  medical  care if appropriate. 
 
• Grade 1: decrease infusion  rate as  per protocol 
• Grade 2: Stop infusion and  treat  symptoms  following guidelines in Table 4. If symptoms  
resolve within  two hours, the infusion may  be restarted  at 50% of the original  infusion  
rate (e.g.,  from  100 mL/hr to 50 mL/hr).  
• Grade 3-4: stop infusion and  treat  symptoms following  guidance in Table 4.   If subjects 
resume study treatment  after previously having a grade 3 infusion- related  reaction  and/or 
cytokine  release syndrome, a 48-hour inpatient observation  period  is mandatory after the 
infusion to perform  frequent vital  sign checks.   If grade > 3 infusion- related  
reaction/cytokine release syndrome does not recur  upon rechallenge,  further cycles  may  
be administered  in the outpatient setting.  
 
Table 4: Guidelines  for Management of Cytokine Release/Infusion Reaction  Symptoms

• Symptoms  or clinical  findings  requiring  aggressive  
intervention, such as: 
o O2 requirement  ≥ 40%  
o Hypotension requiring high dose or multiple  
vasopressors 
o Ventilator support  required  
• CTCAE v5.0 Grade ≥3 organ toxicity • All of the above  
• Monitor cardiac and  other  organ 
functions closely  
• Corticosteroids if  not resolving 
with measures  above 
• Tocilizumab  if not responsive to 
steroids and  other measures  
 
Neurological  Toxicity 
• Grade 2: symptomatic treatment per local  guidelines.  Consider steroids (0.5 –1 
mg/kg/day  methylprednisolone or PO equivalent).  If worsen  treat as grade 3-4. 
• Grade 3-4 or grade 2 for  >28 days: obtain  neurological consult and  treat  symptoms  per 
local  guidelines. Administer corticosteroids  (1–2 mg/kg/day  methylprednisolone or IV  
equivalent). Add  prophylactic antibiotics  for opportunistic infections. Continue steroids  
until symptoms  improve to Grade 2 or less.  If symptoms worsen  or for atypical 
presentation  consider IVIG,  high  doses  steroids (e.g.  1g methylprednisolone) or other  
immunosuppressive measures  per local  guidelines. 
 
Periorbital  Edema:  
• Grade 1: Monitor edema  
• Grade 2-4: Consider IV or oral  corticosteroids  until symptoms  improve to Grade 1 or 
less. Consider adding eye  drops, or analgesics  as needed.  Seek ophthalmologic consult  if 
needed.  
Uveitis: 
• Grade 1: Watch  for worsening of symptoms including visual disturbances, light 
sensitivity,  decrease vision, monitor weekly. 
• Grade 2-4: Treat  with  IV or oral  corticosteroids  until symptoms  improve to Grade 1 or 
less. Consider additional immunosuppressive agents if  not responsive (such as  
infliximab). Consider adding prophylactic antibiotics  for opportunistic infections and  
seek ophthalmologic  consult. 
CK Increase:  
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  75 of 135 Confidential  
  
  
 
• CK > 10x ULN: Consider measuring  CK isoenzymes as  clinically  indicated.  If CK 
isoenzymes  are abnormal consider measuring troponin levels  and other assessments  
(including uromyoglobin) as  clinically  indicated.  If CK  isoenzymes  are normal monitor 
CK level  as clinically  indicated.  
• CK > 15x ULN:  If clinically indicated, measure CK isoenzymes and  test more 
frequently until returned  to Grade 2. If CK isoenzyme panel  is normal  continue 
monitoring  the subject. If  CK isoenzyme panel  is abnormal then consider measuring  
troponins. 
 
4.9 Criteria  for Holding, Discontinuing,  or Modifying  Study  Drug  
Management  of suspected  adverse drug reactions  may  require temporary  treatment hold (until  re- 
treatment  criteria are met), reducing the dose of APX005M, or discontinuation of some or all  
investigational products as  per Table 5. If a subject experiences  several toxicities, the  
recommended  dose modification  should be based  on the highest grade toxicity. 
 
Up to two  dose reductions are permitted  for APX005M. There are no dose reductions for 
cabiralizumab  or nivolumab.

4.11 Treatment  Discontinuation  Criteria  
Subjects  must discontinue receiving  investigational products for any  of the following reasons:  
• Withdrawal  of informed  consent (patient’s  decision to withdraw for  any reason) 
• Toxicity  requiring  discontinuation of all  investigational products as  outlined  in the dose 
modification  guidelines 
• Any clinically  significant  AE, abnormal laboratory test results,  or intercurrent  illness  
which, in the  opinion of  the Investigator, indicates  that continued  participation  in the  
study is not in the best interest  of the patient  
• Failure to recover  from  a disease or treatment -related  AE to baseline or ≤ Grade 1 within  
12 weeks  of last dose of investigational product (except Grade 2 alopecia and Grade 2 
fatigue),  unless  the subject is benefiting  from  therapy  and after discussion  with  and 
approval by the PI  
• Failure to recover  within  4 weeks  of last dose of investigational  product if AE is related  
to infusion reaction/cytokine release  
• Inability  to reduce corticosteroid  to 10 mg or less of prednisone or equivalent per day  
within  12 weeks  of last dose  of investigational product 
• Patients  who  are required  to have prohibited concomitant  medications  
• Pregnancy  
• Termination  of the study by the Sponsor 
• Loss  of ability  to freely  provide consent through  imprisonment or involuntary 
incarceration  for treatment of a psychiatric or physical  (e.g.,  infectious  disease) illness  
• Documented  disease progression or clinical  deterioration  while receiving  active study 
therapy  
• R equirement  for alternative therapy  
• Non-compliance with  study  procedures, including use of prohibited medications  
• Subject  is lost to follow -up 
• Death  
For comprehensive discontinuation rules,  refer to the Table 5 in Section  4.4. The PI  can be 
contacted  at any time if further clarification  is needed. 
 
Other treatment  discontinuation  not specifical ly listed  in Table 5 (Section  4.4) may  include: 
 
• Any event  that leads  to delay  in dosing lasting  > 6 weeks  from the  previous  dose requires  
discontinuation, with  the following exceptions:  
– Dosing  delays  to manage drug- related  adverse events are allowed  for up to 12 weeks  
between  doses.  Prior to re-initiating  treatment  in a patient with a dosing delay  lasting  
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  82 of 135 Confidential  
  
  
 
> 6 weeks  from  the previous dose, the PI  must be consulted. Tumor assessments 
should continue as per-protocol even  if dosing is delayed.  Periodic study visits to  
assess safety  and laboratory studies  should also  continue per protocol, or more  
frequently if clinically  indicated  during such dosing delays or per  the Investigator’s 
discretion.  
– Dosing  delays  lasting >  6 weeks  from the  previous  dose that  occur for non-drug- 
related  reasons  may  be allowed  if approved  by the PI.   Prior to re -initiating  treatment  
in a patient  with  a dosing delay lasting  > 6 weeks,  the PI  must be consulted. Tumor  
assessments should continue per protocol every 8 weeks  for the first  4 months and  
every  12 weeks  (±7 days) thereafter,  even if dosing is delayed.  Periodic study  visits to  
assess safety  and laboratory studies  should also  continue per -protocol or more  
frequently if clinically  indicated  during such dosing delays or per  the Investigator’s 
discretion.  
• Any AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent  illness  which,  in the opinion of the 
Investigator, presents  a substantial clinical  risk to the  patient  with  continued  APX005M,  
cabiralizumab  and/or nivolumab dosing. 
All patients  who  discontinue study treatment  should comply with protocol  specified  follow - 
up procedures  as outlined in Section  5. The only  exception  to this requirement  is when  a 
patient  withdraws  consent for all  study procedures  or loses  the ability  to consent freely  (i.e., 
is imprisoned or involuntarily  incarcerated  for the treatment  of a psychiatric  or physical 
illness).  
If a patient was discontinued,  the reason  for discontinuation must be entered  on the 
appropriate CRF. The  date  and reason  for cessation  of nivolumab,  cabiralizumab,  and 
APX005M will  be documented,  and the Investigator must make every  effort to perform  the 
End-of-Treatment  Visits.  Adverse event  reporting  will continue until 100 (±7) days after the 
last dose of study drug or until initiation  of subsequent anti-cancer therapy.  Patients  with  
ongoing SAEs  will be followed until resolution  or stabilization.  
 
4.12 Infusion  Delays  and Missed  Doses  with Nivolumab,  Cabiralizumab  and APX005M  
In case an  infusion cannot be administered  at a scheduled visit, it must be  administered  as soon 
as possible. If the delay  is more than two  days, the infusion at  the originally  scheduled  visit will  
be considered a missed  dose  and the procedures at  the next visit should be performed.   There  
must be at  least 12 days between study drug administration.  
 
4.13 Treatment Beyond Progression  
Accumulating evidence indicates  a minority  of patients treated  with  immunotherapy may derive 
clinical  benefit despite initial evidence of progressive disease [ 60]. 
 
Patients  treated  with  nivolumab,  cabiralizumab  and APX005M combination  therapy  will be 
permitted  to continue treatment beyond initial RECIST v1.1 defined progressive disease, 
assessed  by the Investigator, as long as  the following criteria are met:  
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  83 of 135 Confidential  
  
  
 
• Patients  who  will be treated  beyond  disease progression must review and  sign  an ICF 
before  continuing on study drug 
• The patient  demonstrates  investigator- assessed  clinical  benefit,  and do not have rapid  
disease progression 
• Tolerance of study drugs 
• No decline in current  ECOG  performance status  
• Treatment  beyond progression will  not delay  an imminent intervention  to prevent  serious  
complications  of disease  progression (e.g., CNS  metastases)  
• Absence of signs,  symptoms, and  worsening laboratory values  that would  indicate  rapid  
disease progression 
 
A radiographic assessment/scan  should be performed  approximately 8 weeks  (±7 days) after  
initial Investigator- assessed  progression to determine whether there has been a decrease in the 
tumor size or continued  progressive disease.  The assessment  of clinical  benefit  should be 
balanced  by clinical  judgment  as to whether the patient is clinically  deteriorating and  unlikely to 
receive any  benefit  from  continued treatment with  investigational products. 
 
If the  Investigator feels  that any patient receiving  nivolumab,  cabiralizumab  and APX005M  will 
obtain clinical  benefit by continuing treatment,  the patient  may  remain  on the trial and  continue  
to receive monitoring according  to the time  and event schedules  per protocol. 
 
For the patients who  continue nivolumab,  cabiralizumab  and APX005M  study  therapy  beyond 
progression, furth er progression is defined as  an additional 10% increase in  tumor burden from  
time of initial  progression. This  includes an  increase in the sum of  diameters  of all  target  lesions  
and/or the diameters  of new  measurable lesions  compared  to the time  of initial  progression. 
APX005M, cabiralizumab  and nivolumab  treatment should be discontinued permanently  upon 
documentation of further progression. 
 
4.14 Treatment  Compliance  
Study drug will be administered  by qualified  trained site  personnel in the clinical  facility.  The 
Investigator or their designated study personnel will maintain  a log (Drug  Accountability  Log) of 
all study drugs received  dispensed  and destroyed. The  Investigator and  the study personnel will 
ensure that  each  patient receives  the calculated  dose  of the study drug based on body weight. 
 
Drug  supplies will  be inventoried  and accounted  for throughout the study. The Drug  
Accountability  Log will be reviewed  by the PI  during site visits and at the completion  of the 
study. Any  discrepancy  should be brought to the attention of the Sponsor. Records  of study 
medication  administration  (date,  start and stop time, and  dose administered  relative to time  of 
preparation) will be recorded  on the patient’s  CRF.  
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  84 of 135 Confidential  
  
  
 
4.15 Destruction  of Study  Drug  
Any unused study drugs can only be destroyed  on site  after being inspected  and reconciled  by the 
responsible site monitor unless study drug vials must be immediately  destroyed  as required  for 
safety,  or to meet  local regulations (e.g., cytotoxics  or biologics). 
 
• On-site destruction  is allowed  provided the following minimal  standards  are met:  
• On-site disposal  practices  must not expose humans  to risks  from  the drug. 
• On-site disposal  practices  and procedures  are in agreement  with  applicable laws  and 
regulations,  including  any special  requirements  for controlled  or hazardous substances.  
• Written  procedures for on -site disposal are available  and followed. The  procedures must 
be filed  with  the site’s  Standard  Operating  Procedures  (SOPs) and  a copy provided to the 
Sponsor upon request.  
• Records  are maintained  that allow for traceability  of each  vial, including  the date 
disposed of, quantity disposed, and  identification  of the person disposing of the 
containers.  The method of disposal (i.e.,  incinerator,  licensed  sanitary  landfill, or licensed  
waste disposal  vendor) must also  be documented. 
• Accountability  and disposal  records  are complete,  up-to-date,  and available  for the PI to 
review throughout the clinical  trial period. 
 
If conditions for destruction cannot  be met,  the responsible PI  will make arrangements  for return  
of study drug (Sec tion 4.16).  
 
It is the  Investigator’s responsibility  to arrange for disposal of all  empty  containers,  provided that  
procedures  for proper disposal have been established  according  to applicable federal,  state,  local,  
and institutional  guidelines  and procedures and provided that  appropriate records of disposal are 
kept. 
 
4.16 Return  of Study  Drug  
If study drug will not be destroyed  on site upon completion or termination  of the study, all 
unused and/or partially  used study drug that was  supplied must be returned. The return  of study 
drug will be arranged  by the responsible PI.

Patients  who  have fully  consented  to participation  in the study will undergo screening  
assessments within  28 days  (4 weeks) prior to administration  of the first  infusion of APX005M,  
cabiralizumab,  and/or nivolumab (unless  otherwise stated).  To determine if  the patient  meets  all 
inclusion criteria and  does not violate any  exclusion criteria,  the following procedures  will be 
performed  (Appendix A ). 
 
• Written,  signed  informed  consent  must be collected  prior to any  study -specific 
procedures  
• Collection  of a formalin  fixed, paraffin -embedded  (FFPE) tissue  block  and/or a fresh  
tumor biopsy from  an accessible site  will be mandatory, unless the Investigator deems  
that the subject  does not have tumor in a site  amenable to biopsy. Tumor  biopsy 
collection  will be performed  at least  24 hours prior to dosing (as in Appendix D ). 
• Complete medical and  disease history 
• Demographic  and baseline characteristics  
• Complete physical  examination  including  height and weight  
• V ital signs  (blood  pressure,  pulse,  respiratory  rate, and temperature in resting  position

.2.2.7 End of  Treatment  Follow -up Period  
See Section  5.2.1.11 
 
5.2.3 Long -Term Follow -up for All  Patients  
Patients  should continue onto Long -Term  Follow -up after  completing  the End -of-Treatment  
Follow-up Period.  
 
Patients  will be followed  every  12 (±2) weeks  for survival. Patients  who  discontinue treatment  
while showing clinical  benefit (complete  response [CR], partial  response [PR], or stable disease  
[SD]) should have tumor assessments during these visits for duration of response.  
 
Long -Term  Follow -up for  survival may  be conducted by telephone,  rather than by an in-person 
visit, once tumor progression is determined  or use of subsequent  anti-cancer  therapy  has been  
initiated.  
 
During the Long- Term  Follow-up Period,  if the patient  undergoes local therapy  (e.g., resection,  
radiation) or new  systemic therapy  is initiated,  this should be documented. Patients  should be 
followed until death, loss to follow -up, withdrawal of consent,  or study termination  by the 
Sponsor. 
 
5.3 Study  Assessments  
 
5.3.1 Safety  Assessments  
At baseline,  a medical  history will be obtained  to capture relevant  underlying conditions.  The 
baseline examinations  should include weight, height, ECOG Performance Status (Appendix  ), 
ECG,  blood pressure,  heart  rate, temperature,  and oxygen saturation  by pulse oximetry  at rest 
(also  monitor amount  of supplemental oxygen, if  applicable) within 28 days prior to first dose. 
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  98 of 135 Confidential  
  
  
 
Safety  assessments including serum  hematology,  chemistry,  ECOG,  weight  and other  
assessments including ECG  (if clinically  indicated)  will be done as  part of standard care during 
each visit prior to dosing as note d in Appendix  A, Appendix  B, and Appendix C . Serum  
chemistry  labs will  be checked  at screening  and any abnormalities outside of the normal range 
will be followed  closely  with evaluation  of symptoms  and follow -up laboratory data. Patients  
will also be monitored  for any  infusion- related  AEs during dosing and followed  up accordingly 
based  on protocol guidelines. Pre-medications  including steroids,  antihistam ines or other  
treatments  will be given prior to future dosing if a patient develops infusion reactions  per 
protocol  guidelines. 
 
Any patient who  has received  study drug will be evaluated  for safety.  Toxicity  assessments  will 
be continuous during the treatment  phase and  End-of-Treatment  Follow -up Period  clinic visits.  
Once patients  reach the Long- Term  Follow -up Period (and  tumor progression  has been  
determined  or use  of subsequent anti -cancer therapy  has been initiated),  documented  telephone 
calls or email  correspondence to assess the  patient’s  status  are acceptable.  
 
AEs and laboratory values will  be graded according  to the NCI  CTCAE v5.0. 
 
Oxygen saturation  by pulse oximetry  at rest (also the amount  of supplemental  oxygen, if  
applicable) should be assessed  at each  on-study visit prior to dosing.  If a patient shows  changes  
on pulse oximetry  or other  pulmonary- related  signs (hypoxia, fever) or symptoms (e.g.  dyspnea, 
cough, fever) consistent  with  possible pulmonary AEs,  the patient  should be immediately  
evaluated  to rule out pulmonary toxicity,  according  to the suspected  pulmonary toxicity  
management guidelines in  Section  4.8 and  Section  4.9. 
 
Physical  examinations are  to be performed  as clinically  indicated.  If there are any  new or 
worsening clinically  significant changes  since the last  exam, report changes on the appropriate 
non-serious  AE or SAE page.  
 
Additional  measures,  including non-study required laboratory tests,  should be  performed  as 
clinically  indicated  or to comply with local  regulations. Laboratory  toxicities  (e.g., suspected  
drug-induced liver  enzyme evaluations) will  be monitored during the follow -up phase via  
on-site/local  labs until all  study drug-related  toxicities resolve,  return  to baseline, or are deemed  
stable.  
 
Additional  testing  or assessments may  be performed  as clinically  necessary  or as  required  by 
institutional  or local  regulations. 
 
5.3.2 Efficacy  Assessments 
 
5.3.2.1 Primary  Efficacy Parameters  
The primary  efficacy  parameter is the  objective  response rate (ORR; number of patients  with  
confirmed response of CR or PR, divided  by the total  number of treated  patients who  are 
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  99 of 135 Confidential  
  
  
 
evaluable for a response). Tumor response status  will be assessed  using RECIST v1.1 by 
investigator review. 
 
Board -certified  radiologists  will determine radiographic response and/or progression following 
enrollment  in according  to RECIST v1.1. 
 
5.3.2.1.1  Tumor Assessment  
Tumor assessments will  be performed  at Screening  (within 28 days  prior to first  dose),  then  
every  8 weeks  (± 7 days) for a total of 2 sets  of imaging  studies,  followed  by every  12 weeks  (+ 
7 days) thereafter.  Imaging will include an  initial  MRI  of the brain with  and without contrast  as 
well as body imaging  with either PET CT,  CT scans, or MRI.   If an MRI  of the brain  is 
contraindicated,  a head CT  with  and without contrast  should be performed.  Brain  imaging  can 
be performed  every  6 months unless  clinically  indicated  in shorter intervals,  such as in patients  
with metastatic melanoma.   All patients  should have tumor response parameters  assessed  at the 
End-of-Treatment  visit unless  a tumor  assessment  has been  performed  within  8 weeks  prior to an  
End-of-Treatment  Visit or  if tumor progression was previously determined.  Patients  who  enter  
Long -Term  Follow -up while  showing clinical  benefit should have tumor assessments  every  12 
weeks  (±7 days) for duration of response.  The same  measuring  modality  should be preferably  
used by the site  to maintain  consistency  across  the study. 
 
Response will  be evaluated  using RECIST v1.1. 
 
5.3.2.2 Additional  Efficacy  Parameters  
Additional  efficacy  parameters  may include the following: Overall  Survival (OS, 1-year OS,  and 
median  OS), progression- free survival  (PFS),  and duration of response (DOR) for those patients  
with confirmed  responses, based  on RECIST v 1.1. 
 
CT or MRI  will be performed  at screening,  during treatment,  and at the End-of-Treatment  Visit 
per protocol. Measurements  of change in tumor  burden must be  reviewed  and documented after 
each measurement.  
 
5.3.2.3 Tumor Biopsy for Fresh  Tumor Tissue  Collection  
Biopsy at the primary  tumor site  or metastatic site  will be collected  prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 and  
on-treatment  (within  7 days prior to Cycle 5, Day 1, and  at least  24 hours prior  to dosing) for all  
patients.  Patients  may also have on- treatment biopsy  upon documented  tumor response and  post- 
treatment  biopsy upon documented tumor progression, as  deemed  safe and  accessible by the 
Investigator ( Appendix  E). If available,  tumor  tissue  obtained from  post-treatment procedures 
such as surgery  may also be collected.  
 
Biopsied  lesions  may  become inflamed,  bleed,  or change dimensions, which could  result  in 
inaccurate tumor measurements.  Therefore,  it is recommended  not to use the  biopsied lesion  as a 
target  lesion  when  assessing  the response by RECIST v 1.1 criteria when possible.

5.3.3 Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood  samples  for the PK  evaluation of APX005M will  be collected  from  all patients  in the 
Phase 1 dose escalation  component, as  described  in Section  5 and  in Appendix A and  Appendix 
D. 
 
Blood  samples  will be collected  and processed  for serum  according  to the instructions  provided 
in the Laboratory Manual.  
 
5.3.4 Biomarker Assessments  
A variety  of factors  that could potentially  predict  clinical  response to the combination of 
APX005M, cabiralizumab  and nivolumab  will be investigated in peripheral  blood and  in tumor  
specimens  collected  from  patients  prior to and  during treatment.  Data  from  these  investigations 
will be evaluated  for associations  with  response and/or safety  (AE) data.  In addition, analyses  of 
markers  between  the treatment  arms  will provide the  necessary  data to identify  and validate  
biomarkers  with  predictive vs prognostic value. Complete  instructions  on the collection,  
processing, handling and shipment  of all  samples  described  herein  will be provided in a 
Laboratory Manual.  
 
5.3.4.1 Tumor Tissue  Specimens  
Mandatory tumor tissue  specimens  in the form  of a paraffin  embedded  block, and/or fresh  frozen  
tissue,  will be submitted.  These biopsy samples  should be excisional, incisional or core needle as  
fine needle aspirates  or other cytology specimens  are insufficient  for downstream  biomarker  
analyses.  Patients  undergoing core needle biopsy will be required  to provide a minimum of  two 
cores.  Tissue samples  are being collected  to evaluate the PD  effect  of study drugs on the tumor 
microenvironment.  These  samples  may  also undergo RNA sequencing to determine the effect  of 
study drugs on gene expression, single cell RNA -seq, CyTOF  and quantitative 
immunofluorescence.   These  analyses  may  help predict future  response to treatment.  A summary  
of analyses  to be performed are described in Appendix D . 
 
Tumor biopsy specimens  will be obtained  before treatment  and on-treatment  to examine immune  
infiltrates  and expression  of selected  tumor markers. Tumor biopsies  may  be obtained upon 
documentation of tumors  that have responded and/or progressed  on or after  treatment  to 
understand mechanisms  of resistance.  
 
Samples  may  be assessed  for the expression  of immune or disease related  genes  and/or proteins, 
as well  as for the presence of immune  cell populations using a variety  of methodologies  
including but not limited  to immunofluorescence,  CyTOF,  bulk RNA- seq, and single  cell RNA  
Seq. 
 
Blood  samples  for exploratory serum biomarker analyses  will be drawn  at the time  points  
indicated  in the  Schedule of Assessments  (Appendix A , Appendix  B, and Appendix C ). Blood  
samples  will be processed  to collect  serum  and PBMCs. and  stored  frozen prior to analysis.  In 
addition  to the PK  analyses  mentioned above, serum samples  will be analyzed  to determine the 
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  101 of

PD effect  of study drugs on cytokines,  CSF1R  ligand, and  CD40  ligand concentrations. Whole 
blood will  be collected,  spun and  stored  to profile PBMCs  by methods such as CyTOF  or single  
cell RNA -seq. Samples  may  be also  assessed  by multiplex  ELISA,  seromics,  and/or other  
relevant  multiplex -based  protein  assay  methods. Serum  marker analyses  may also help  establish  
a biomarker signature that may  predict  benefit  or correlate  with  efficacy  that can  be used  to 
inform this and  future studies. Timings  of sample  collection  are listed in Appendix C  and 
analyses  to be performed  are described  in Appendix D . 
 
5.3.4.2 Flow  Cytometry  
Pre-treatment  and on-treatment whole blood and  PBMC  samples  will be analyzed  by flow 
cytometry  to study the effects  of APX005M,  cabiralizumab and  nivolumab  on various peripheral  
blood immune cell  subsets.  Timing  of sample collection  is listed in Appendix C  and analyses  to 
be performed  are described  in Appendix  D.

6. Adverse Events  
An Adverse Event  (AE) is  defined as  any new untoward medical  occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting  medical  condition in a clinical  investigation, patient -administered  study drug and that 
does not necessarily  have a causal  relationship  with  this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any  
unfavorable and unintended sign  (such as  an abnormal laboratory finding),  symptom,  or disease  
temporally  associated  with the  use of study drug, whether or not  considered  related  to the study 
drug. 
 
The causal  relationship  to study drug is determined by an investigator and should be used  to 
assess all  AEs.  The causal  relationship  can be one of the following:  
• Definitely  related  
• Possibly related  
• Unlikely  related  
• Not related:  There is not  a reasonable causal  relationship  between  study drug 
administration  and the AE.  
 
AEs can be spontaneously reported  or elicited  during open-ended questioning, examination, or 
evaluation  of a patient. (In order to prevent reporting  bias, patients should not be questioned 
regarding  the specific occurrence of one or more  AEs.)  
 
6.1 Collection  of Adverse Events  
Any new symptoms, injury or worsening of symptoms  that occur following signing of the 
informed consent form (ICF) but prior to first  infusion (Cycle 1 Day 1) will be considered  
pretreatment  events and  reported  on the Medical  History  page of the electronic case report form  
(eCRF),  unless  they directly  correlate to a study -related  procedure. Adverse  event  reporting  will 
continue until 100 (±7) days  after the last  dose  of study drug or until initiation  of subsequent  
anti-cancer therapy.  
 
6.2 Serious  Adverse Events  
A Serious  Adverse Event  (SAE)  is any  untoward medical  occurrence that  at any dose: 
• Results  in death.  Death  may  occur  as a result of the underlying disease process. All  
events  other than  progression of underlying disease that  result  in death  during the 
reporting period up to 100 (±7) days after the last  dose of study drugs  or until initiation  
of subsequent  anti-cancer therapy , whichever comes first,  must be treated  as an SAE and  
reported  as such. 
• Is life-threatening  (defined as  an event in which  the patient  was at risk of death at  the 
time of the event)  
• Requires  inpatient  hospitalization  or causes  prolongation  of existing  hospitalization  (see 
NOTE below)  
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  103 of 135 Confidential  
  
  
 
• Results  in persistent  or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital  anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical  event (defined  as a medical event  that may  not be immediately  
life-threatening or result  in death  or hospitalization  but, based  upon appropriate medical  
and scientific judgment,  may  jeopardize the patient or may  require intervention [e.g.,  
medical,  surgical]  to prevent  one of the other  serious outcomes  listed  in the definition  
above.]). Potential DILI is also  considered  an important medical  event.  (See  Sectio n 6.7 
for the definition of potential DILIs.)  
• Suspected  transmission  of an infectious  agent  (e.g.,  pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the 
study drug is an SAE.  
 
Although  pregnancy and potential drug-induced liver injury ( DILI),  are not always  serious  by 
regulatory definition, these  events must be handled as SAEs  and reported within the SAEs 
timeline  (See Section  6.2.1 for reporting pregnancies).  
 
Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to study therapy should be reported 
as an SAE (e.g., death is an endpoint, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be 
reported).  
 
Note : The following hospitalizations are not cons idered  SAEs  in this clinical  study:  
• Visit  to the emergency  room or other hospital  department  <24 hours, that  does not result  
in admission  (unless  considered  an important medical  or life -threatening event) 
• Elective surgery,  planned prior to signing  consent 
• Admissions  as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical  procedure 
• Routine health  assessment  requiring  admission  for baseline/trending of health status  
(e.g., routine colonoscopy)  
• M edical/surgical  admission other than to remedy  ill health  and planned prior  to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required  in these cases.  
• Admission  encountered  for another life circumstance that  carries  no bearing on health 
status  and requires  no medical/surgical intervention  (e.g., lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy, caregiver  respite,  family  circumstances, administrative reason).  
• Admission  for administration  of anti -cancer therapy  in the absence of any  other SAEs  
• Hospitalization  for an  event  solely  related  to disease progression or for an  elective  or 
planned  procedure to treat a  pre-existing  condition 
• Admission  to hospice or care facility  to support activities  of daily  living  
 
6.2.1 Serious  Adverse Event  Reporting  
 
The Investigator should report  any SAE that  occurs after the first  study drug dose and  until 
100 (±7) days after the last dose of study drug or until initiation  of subsequent anti -cancer  
therapy, whichever comes first . Protocol- specified  procedure related  SAE  will be collected  
following signing of ICF.  
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  104 of 135 Confidential  
  
  
An SAE report should be completed  for any  event  where doubt exists regarding  its seriousness.  
 
If the  Investigator believes that  an SAE is not related  to study drug, but is potentially  related  to 
the conditions of the study  (such as  withdrawal  of previous  therapy  or a complication  of a study 
procedure),  the relationship  should be specified  in the narrative section  of the SAE Report Form.  
 
• SAEs,  related  or unrelated to study drug, and  pregnancies  must be reported  to the PI  
within  24 hours of becoming aware of the event. SAEs  must be recorded  on the SAE  
Report  Form,  and pregnancies must be recorded  on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form  
(paper  forms).  SAE and  pregnancy data reporting must be done on the paper  
SAE/Pregnancy  Surveillance Forms  provided by the Industry Collaborators. They  are to  
be transmitted  via email  or fax  to the Yale DSMC.  If related  to study drugs, SAEs  will be 
reported  to the  HIC  within  48 hours. 
 
Yale Safety Reporting:  
 
The PIs  and IND holders will monitor  the clinical  trial for safety.   The PI  will assess all 
expedited  adverse events  and will periodically  review all  adverse events observed on the  trial.  
Yale Cancer Center  standard  operating procedures (SOPs) for assessment  and reporting of 
adverse events  are followed  which  are in compliance with  21 CFR  312.32 and 312.22. 
The clinical  trial data consisting  of all  required  observations, AEs,  and laboratory data are 
entered  into a computerized  database in a timely  manner.  The accuracy  and completeness  of the 
database,  timely  submission of SAEs  and compliance with  the protocol, is  assured  by periodic 
auditing  conducted  by the Yale Cancer Center  Office  of Protocol Review  and Monitoring, which  
reports to the  Yale  Data Safety  & Monitoring Committee  (DSMC).  Safety  data will  be 
submitted  to the DSMC  at least  once  yearly  or more  often  as required  by the DSMP.  The DSMC  
will conduct an  internal audit of the study every  6-12 months, per institutional requirements.  On 
a regular interval  basis, status reports of all  laboratory parameters,  AEs  and SAEs  are reviewed  
by the PI  to view  composite data across  subjects.   Regular meetings  are held to discuss ongoing 
patient  treatment  and adverse events.  
 
E
xpedited SAE reports submitted  by the Investigator to FDA are also  copied to the HIC  and 
other relevant institutional  safety  committees  within the timeframes  required by Yale.  These will 
also be copied  to BMS  and Apexigen.   The Principal  Investigator will distribute manufacturer - 
provided safety  reports and updated Toxicity  Lists  to the institution’s  HIC  and all relevant  
personnel involved in the conduct of the study. The Toxicity  List, in addition  to the 
Investigator’s Brochure, will  be used as a reference for reporting any new SAE.  
Possible actions  taken  by the PI  or the Yale DSMC  if a new unexpected  toxicity  is identified  
from  the above safety  review,  or if  the periodic review of all  adverse events  and laboratory data 
indicates  a pattern  of incidence or severity  of toxicity  that raises  a safety  concern,  can be to: 
1. Revise consent  form  
2. Amend  the protocol 
3. Suspend the protocol 
 
All AEs found to be expected  or non- serious,  will be included in the Annual Report.

SAE  reporting  to BMS  and Apexigen : 
• All Serious  Adverse Events (SAEs) that  occur  following  the subject’s  written  consent  to 
participate in the study through  100 (+7) days of discontinuation of dosing or until 
initiation of subsequent anti- cancer therapy, whichever comes first,  must be reported to  
BMS  Worldwide Safety  and to Apexigen Safety, whether related  or not related  to study 
drug. If applicable,  SAEs  must be collected  that relate to any  later pro tocol- specified  
procedure (eg,  a follow- up skin biopsy). 
• Following the subject’s  written  consent  to participate in the study, all SAEs,  whether  
related  or not related  to study drug, are collected,  including those thought to be  associated  
with protocol- specified  procedures.  The investigator should report any  SAE  occurring  after  
these aforementioned  time periods, which  is believed  to be related  to study drug or 
protocol -specified  procedure.  
• An SAE report should be completed  for any  event  where doubt exists regarding  its 
seriousness;  
• If the  investigator believes  that an SAE is not related  to study drug, but is potentially  
related  to the conditions of the study  (such as withdrawal of previous therapy or a 
complication of a study procedure ), the relationship  should be specified  in the narrative 
section  of the SAE Report Form.  
 
A Medwatch  SAE  form  will be used to report  SAEs to BMS  and Apexigen. 
 
• Worldwide.Safety@bms.com  
• drugsafety@apexigen.com 
• For studies with long- term follow -up periods in which safety data are being reported, include 
the timing of SAE collection  
• The Sponsor will reconcile the clinical database AE cases (case level only) transmitted to 
BMS Global Pharmacovigilance ( Worldwide.Safety@bms.com ) and to Apexigen Safety 
(drugsafety@apexigen.com) 
o The Investigator will request from BMS GPV&E, aepbusinessprocess@bms.com  the 
SAE reconciliation report and include the BMS protocol number every 3 months and prior to data base lock or final data summary. 
o The Investigator will request from Apexigen Safety, drugsafety@apexigen.com  a 
CA025-007 specific listing of SAEs and include the Apexigen protocol number on an ever 3 -month basis and prior to data base lock or final data summary  
o GPV&E and Apexigen Safety will send the investigator the report to verify and confirm all SAEs have been transmitted to BMS GPV&E  and Apexigen Safety. 
o The data elements listed on the GPV&E reconciliation report will be used for case identification purposes. If the Investigator determines a case was not transmitted to BMS GPV&E  and Apexigen Safety, the case should be sent immediately to BMS 
(Worldwide.Safety@bms.com ) and Apexigen (drugsafety@apexigen.com).  
• In addition to the Sponsor Investigator’s responsibility to report events to their local health 
authority ( HA), suspected serious adverse reactions (whether expected or unexpected) shall 
be reported by BMS and by Apexigen to the relevant competent health authorities in all concerned countries according to local regulations (either as expedited and/or in aggregate reports).  
• In accordance with local regulations, BMS and Apexigen will notify sponsor investigators of 
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  106 of 135 Confidential  
  
 all reported SAEs that are  suspected (related to the investigational product) and unexpected 
(i.e., not previously described in the IB). An event meeting these criteria is termed a 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR). Sponsor investigator notification of these eve nts will be in the form of either a SUSAR Report or a Semi-Annual 
SUSAR Report.  
o Other important findings  which  may  be reported  by BMS or by Apexigen as  an 
Expedited Safety  Report  (ESR) include:  increased  frequency  of a clinically  significant 
expected  SAE,  an SAE considered associated  with study procedures  that could modify 
the conduct of the study, lack  of efficacy  that poses  significant hazard to study subjects,  
clinically  significant safety  finding from  a nonclinical (eg,  animal)  study, important 
safety  recommendations  from a  study data monitoring committee,  or sponsor decision 
to end  or temporarily  halt a clinical  study for safety  reasons.  
o Upon receiving an ESR from BMS or Apexigen, the investigator must review and retain the ESR  with the IB. Where required by local regulations or when there is a central 
IRB/IEC for the study, the sponsor will submit the ESR to the appropriate IRB/IEC. The investigator and IRB/IEC will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC procedures for reporting any other safety information. 
 
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS 
and Apexigen within 24 hours \ 1 Business Day of becoming aware of the event. SAEs must be recorded on either CIOMS, MedWatch, or approved site SAE for m. 
 
Pregnancies must be reported and submitted to BMS and to Apexigen. Investigator will perform 
due diligence follow-up using the BMS Pregnancy Form which the investigator must complete.

- If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required  
 
If only limited  information  is initially  available,  follow-up reports are required. (Note:  Follow -up 
SAE reports  should include the same investigator term(s) initially  reported.) 
 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity  or relationship  to study drug or if  new information 
becomes  available,  a follow -up SAE report should be sent  within  24 hours \ 1 Business  Day  to 
BMS  and Apexigen  using  the same procedure used for transmitting  the initial  SAE report. 
 
All SAEs  should be followed  to resolution  or stabilization.  
 
The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all 
adverse events (AE). The causal relationship can be one of the following: 
 
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and the AE.  Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and 
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  107 of 135 Confidential  
  
 the AE . 
 
The term “reasonable causal relationship” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship.  
 
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open-ended questioning, examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)   Non-Serious Adverse Event  
 
• Non-serious Adverse Events (AE) are to be provided to BMS and to Apexigen in aggregate 
via interim or final study reports as specified in the agreement or, if a regulatory requirement [e.g., IND US trial] as part of an annual reporting requirement.  
• Non-serious AE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead -in 
period or other observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects.  
  Non-serious Adverse Even t Collection and Reporting  
 
The collection of non-serious AE information should begin at initiation of study drug. All non-serious adverse events (not only those deemed to be treatment- related) should be collected 
continuously during the treatment period and for a minimum of 100 (+7) days following the last 
dose of study treatment or until initiation of subsequent anti- cancer therapy, whichever comes first .  
 Non-serious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious. Follow-up is also required for non-serious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of study drug and for those present at the end of study treatment as appropriate. 
 
Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
 
All laboratory test results captured as part of the study should be recorded following institutional procedures. Test results that constitute SAEs should be documented and reported to BMS as such.
 
The following laboratory abnormalities should be documented and reported appropriately:  
• any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE  
• any laboratory abnormality that required the participant to have study drug discontinued or interrupted any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to receive specific corrective therapy. 
 
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by the 
reporting investigator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).  
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  108 of 135 Confidential  
  
  
 
Pregnancy  
If, following initiation  of the investigational product, it is subsequently discovered that a study 
participant  is pregnant  or may have been pregnant at  the time  of investigational product  
exposure, including  during at least 5 half -lives  after product administration,  the investigational 
product will be permanently  discontinued  in an  appropriate manner  (eg, dose tapering  if 
necessary  for participant). 
 
The investigator must immediately  notify Worldwide.Safety@bms.com  of this event  via either  
the CIOMS,  MedWatch  or appropriate Pregnancy  Surveillance Form in accordance with  SAE  
reporting procedures. 
 
Protocol- required  procedures  for study discontinuation and  follow -up must be  performed  on the 
participant.  
 
Follow-up information regarding  the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and  neonatal  
outcome and, where applicable,  offspring  information must be reported  on the CIOMS,  
MedWatch,  BMS  Pregnancy Surveillance Form,  or approved site  SAE  form.  A  BMS  Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form may  be provided upon request. 
 
Any pregnancy  that occurs  in a female partner  of a male study participant should be reported  to 
BMS.  Information on this pregnancy will be collected  on the Pregnancy  Surveillance Form.  In 
order for Sponsor or designee to collect  any pregnancy  surveillance information from  the female  
partner,  the female partner must sign  an informed consent form  for disclosure of this  
information. 
 
Overdose 
An overdose is defined as the accidental  or intentional  administration  of any  dose of a product 
that is considered  both excessive and  medically  important.  All occurrences  of overdose must be 
reported  as an SAE.  
 
Other Safety  Considerations  
Any significant worsening  noted  during interim or  final  physical  examinations, 
electrocardiograms,  X-rays,  and any other potential safety  assessments,  whether or not these  
procedures  are required  by the protocol, should also  be recorded  as a non-serious or serious  AE, 
as appropriate, and  reported accordingly.  
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022

Adverse Events that are routinely collected according to GCP shall be submitted to BMS every three 
(3) months by the last working day of the third month.   
The Adverse Event information required to be sent to BMS is noted in the ‘ Bristol- Myers Squibb 
Early  Asset Investigator Sponsored Research (ISR) Import Plan’ which describes the method of 
collection and submission to BMS via the mailbox:   MG -RD-GPVE -
PHARMACOVIGILANCE@bms.com   
 
When the file is submitted  to BMS,  it must be  noted  whether the file contains: 
 
All Non Serious Adverse Events (only adverse events not previously submitted to BMS within 
the 3 months)  
 
 
6.3 Non-Serious  Adverse Events  
A non -serious  adverse event  is any  AE not classified  as serious.  
 
6.3.1 Non-serious  Adverse Event  Reporting  
 
Non-serious  AEs  should also  be followed  to resolution or stabilization,  or reported  as SAEs  if 
they become serious (see Section  6.2.1 ). Follow -up is also  required  for non- serious  AEs  that 
cause interruption  or discontinuation of study drug and  for those present at  the end-of-study 
treatment,  as appropriate. All identified  non-serious  AEs  must be recorded  and described  on the 
appropriate AE page of the  CRF.  
 
Completion  of supplemental  CRFs  may be requested  for AEs  and/or laboratory abnormalities 
that are reported  during the course of the study. 
 
6.4 Laboratory Test Result  Abnormalities  
The following laboratory test result  abnormalities should be captured  on the appropriate CRF  
page or SAE Report  Form  as appropriate: 
• Any laboratory test result that  is clinically  significant  or meets  the definition of an  SAE  
• Any laboratory test result abnormality that required  the patient  to have study  drug 
discontinued or interrupted  
• An y  laboratory test result abnormality that required  the patient  to receive specific 
corrective therapy.  
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  110 of 135 Confidential  
  
  
 
It is expected  that wherever possible,  the clinical  rather than  laboratory term would  be used by 
the reporting Investigator (e.g., anemia versus low hemoglobin  value).  
 
6.5 Pregnancy  
 
If, following initiation  of the investigational product, it is discovered  that a study patient is  
pregnant or may  have been pregnant at the time  of investigational product exposure, including  
during at least 5 half -lives after product administration,  the investigational product will  be 
permanently  discontinued in an  appropriate manner. 
 
The Investigator must immediately  notify the Industry  Collaborators of this event  and complete  
and forward  a Pregnancy  Form  to the  Sponsor (or designee) within  24 hours and  in accordance  
with SAE reporting  procedures described  in Secti on 6.2.1. 
 
Follow-up information regarding  the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and  neonatal  
outcome and, where applicable,  offspring  information, must be reported  on the Pregnancy  
Surveillance Form. 
 
Any pregnancy  that occurs  in a female partner  of a male study participant should be reported  to 
the Sponsor.  Information  on this pregnancy will be collected  on the Pregnancy  Surveillance 
Form.  
 
6.6 Overdose 
 
Any dose of study drug in excess  of 50% of the dose  level  specified  in the protocol  is considered  
to be an  overdose.  Signs  and symptoms  of an  overdose that  meet  any SAE  criterion  must be 
reported  as an SAE in  the appropriate time  frame  and documented  as clinical  sequelae to  an 
overdose. There is no known antidote for a drug overdose to either  cabiralizumab  or nivolumab. 
In the event  of an  overdose,  patients  should be closely  monitored and given  appropriate 
supportive treatment.  
 
6.7 Potential  Drug  Induced  Liver Injury  
 
Wherever possible,  timely  confirmation  of initial  liver-related  laboratory abnormalities  should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential  drug-induced  liver injury  (DILI)  event. All  occurrences  
of potential DILIs,  meeting  the defined criteria, must be reported  as SAEs.  
 
Potential  drug induced  liver  injury is defined  as: 
 
1. ALT  or AST elevation  >3x ULN  
and 
2. Total  bilirubin  >2x ULN  (> 2x baseline in patients  with  Gilbert’s  syndrome) without  initial  
findings  of cholestasis  (elevated  serum  alkaline phosphatase) or  INR > 1.5 xULN (in  the 
absence of anticoagulation) 
and 
3. No other immediately  apparent  possible causes  of aminotransferase elevation and  
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  111 of 135 Confidential  
  
 hyperbilirubinemia including, but not limited  to viral  hepatitis,  pre-existing  chronic or 
acute liver disease,  or the  administration  of other drugs  known to be hepatotoxic.

7. Statistical  Considerations 
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
 
The primary  endpoint  of safety  and MTD of APX005M in combination  with  cabiralizumab  and 
nivolumab  will be determined  by a 3+3 dose escalation design  as described  above.  In this first  
phase, patients  will be enrolled  regardless  of disease  (melanoma,  NSCLC,  and RCC).  The 
maximum tolerated  dose (MTD) will  be estimated  independently of cohort. Upon completion  of 
this determination, we will proceed  to three parallel two -stage designs, separately  for each  of the 
three disease cohorts using  the MTD.  Patients  exposed to the MTD in the dose  escalation  phase 
will be carried  over to the appropriate two- stage design.  
 
Simon’s  two-stage design will  be used in the phase 1b portion of the trial which will  include 3 
separate and  parallel  disease -specific cohorts (melanoma,  NSCLC,  and RCC).  For each  of the 
three tumor types,  an immune therapy  regimen  which is modestly  active in  patients  whose  
disease had  progressed  on PD-1/PD -L1 inhibitors  would  have a response rate  (RR) of 10%. The 
null hypothesis that  the true  response rate is 10% will  be tested  against a one -sided  alternative.  
A regimen  worthy of further investigation in any  of the three tumor types  will have a RR of  25%.  
In the first  stage,  13 patients of each  cancer will  be accrued.   If there  are 1 or fewer responses  in 
these 13 patients,  that cohort will  be stopped. Otherwise,  21 additional  patients of the same  
disease cohort  will be accrued  for a maximum total  of 34 patients  per disease cohort. Each of  the 
three null hypotheses will be rejected  if 6 or more  responses are observed in  34 patients  for each  
cohort.  This design  yields  a type I error rate of 0.1 and a power of 80% when the true response 
rate is 25% in each  of the three cohorts. There  will not be a correction  for multiplicity  across  the 
three separate cohorts. 
 
7.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic data, medical  history, other baseline characteris tics, concomitant  disease,  and 
concomitant medication  will be summarized  by cohort and  overall.  To determine whether the 
criteria for study conduct  are met,  corresponding tables and  listings  will be provided. These  will 
include an  assessment  of protocol  deviations,  study  drug accountability,  and other data that may  
impact  the general  conduct of the study. 
 
7.3 Efficacy  Analyses  
For each  disease type, response to treatment will be summarized  for all  treated  patients  for ORR,  
defined  as the ratio  of the number of patients  that achieve an  objective  response (a  BOR  of CR or  
PR) to total number of patients  who  are evaluable for a response,  which  may  include patients  
who die or for  which  clinical  progression has occurred  even if  a post -treatment  scan has not been  
performed.  Exact  confidence interval  will be constructed for the response rate.  Overall  Survival, 
survival  at 1 year,  and median survival will  be estimated  by the Kaplan -Meier method.  The 
corresponding confidence interval  will also be presented.  
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  113 of 135 Confidential  
  
  
 
7.4 Safety  Analyses  
Safety  analyses  will be performed  for all  treated  patients.  Incidence of AEs, clinical  laboratory 
information, vital  signs,  ECOG performance status,  weight,  and ECGs  will be tabulated  and 
summarized.  
 
Incidence of AEs  will be summarized  overall and  with  separate summaries  for SAEs,  AEs  
leading  to discontinuation, AEs  leading  to death,  and NCI -CTCAE v5.0 Grade 3 or higher AEs.  
 
Weight  and vital  signs  will be  summarized  descriptively  (n, mean, standard  deviation, median,  
minimum, and  maximum).  ECOG performance status will  be summarized  categorically  and 
descriptively.  
 
Shift  tables  displaying patient counts and  percentages  classified  by baseline grade and  maxi mum 
grade on treatment will  be provided for  laboratory data by cohort and  overall. A marked  
laboratory change is defined  as a shift from a  baseline Grade 0 to Grade 3 (non- hematologic) or 
Grade 4 (hematologic) on  treatment,  or a shift from a  baseline Grade 1 to Grade 4 on treatment.  
The number and percentage of patients  with marked  laboratory changes  will be tabulated  by 
cohort and  overall.  
 
7.5 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Individual and  mean serum concentration of APX005M  versus  time  data will be  plotted  by dose 
level.  Summary  statistics  will be tabulated  for the serum  concentration- time data and  estimated  
PK parameters  of APX005M, as  appropriate.   For  APX005M, PK parameters  including  Cmax, 
AUC,  Cmin, CL, and Vss will be estimated.  
 
7.6 Biomarker Analyses  
To assess  the PD  effects  of APX005M, cabiralizumab  and nivolumab  on various  exploratory 
biomarkers  (such as  soluble factors,  peripheral  blood immune cell  subsets,  and other markers  as 
assessed) summary  statistics for these markers  and their changes (or percent changes) from  
baseline will  be tabulated  by visit and  dose.  In addition, the time  course of exploratory biomarker  
outcomes will  be investigated  graphically  by summary  plots or individual patient  plots over time.  
Patterns  of change in these biomarker values over  time  and how the patterns  differed  among dose 
levels  may  be additionally investigated  using appropriate modeling, for example, by linear  mixed  
effects  models.  
 
Possible associations  of biomarker measures  with  clinical  efficacy  measures including OS will 
be investigated  based  on data availability. Methods such  as, but not limited  to, logistic regression  
may be used  to further investigate such associations.  
 
If at the time  of database lock for the primary  and secondary  endpoints, biomarker data related  to 
the exploratory objectives are not available,  these  biomarker results may  not be included in the  
clinical  study report (CSR) but  reported  separately.  
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022

Selected  serum  markers: Analyses  are descriptive in nature and  intended to examine the 
distribution  of expression  and assess potential associations  between  expression and  efficacy  
measures.  If there is an  indication  of a meaningful association,  future work  will evaluate 
expression as  a predictive biomarker,  including selection  of an  optimal expression cut-off to  
classify  patients as  positive or negative.  See Appendix D.

8. Ethical  Considerations 
8.1 Good  Clinical  Practice  
The procedures  set out in this study protocol are designed  to ensure that  the Sponsor and  
Investigator abide by GCP guidelines of the ICH  and the Declaration  of Helsinki [81] . The study 
also will be carried  out in compliance with  local  legal  requirements.  
 
The study will be conducted in compliance with  the protocol.  The protocol and  any amendments  
and the Informed  Consent Form  (ICF) will  receive  Institutional Review  Board/Independent 
Ethics  Committee (IRB/IEC) approval/favorable opinion prior to initiation  of the study. 
 
All potential  serious  breaches  must be reported  to the Sponsor immediately.  A serious  breach  is a 
breach  of the conditions and  principles  of GCP  in connection with the study  or the protocol, 
which  is likely  to affect,  to a significant degree,  the safety  or physical or mental integrity  of the 
patients  of the study or the scientific value of the study. 
 
Personnel  involved  in conducting this study will be qualified  by education, training,  and 
experience to perform  their  respective tasks.  
 
This study will not use the  services  of study personnel where sanctions have been  invoked or 
where there has been  scientific  misconduct or fraud  (e.g., loss of  medical  licensure,  debarment).  
 
8.2 Institutional  Review  Board/Independent Ethics  Committee  
Before study initiation,  the Investigator must have written  and dated approval/favorable opinion 
from  the IRB/IEC  for the protocol, ICF, patient  recruitment  materials  (e.g.,  advertisements), and 
any other written  information to be provided to patients.  The Investigator or Sponsor should also  
provide the IRB/IEC with a  copy of the IB or product labeling information  to be provided to  
patients  and any updates. 
 
The Investigator should provide the IRB/IEC  with reports, updates and other information (e.g., 
expedited  safety  reports, amendments,  and administrative letters) according to regulatory 
requirements  or institution procedures.  
 
8.3 Informed  Consent  
All information about the clinical  study, including patient  information  and the ICF, is prepared  
and used for the protection of the human  rights  of the patient  according  to ICH GCP  guidelines 
and the Declaration  of Helsinki [81] . 
 
The ICF,  prepared  by the Investigator with the assistance of the Sponsor, must be approved 
along  with the study protocol by the IEC/IRB  and be acceptable to the Sponsor. Before  each  
patient  is enrolled  on the study, written  informed  consent will  be obtained according to the 
regulatory and legal  requirements.  A copy of the signed ICF will be retained by the patient and  
the original will  be filed  in the Investigator’s site  file, unless otherwise agreed. The  Investigator 
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  116 of 135 Confidential  
  
  
 
will not undertake any  investigation  specifically  required  only for the clinical  study until valid  
consent has been obtained. The terms  of the consent and  when  it was  obtained must be 
documented  in the source documents and  in the CRF.  
 
If a protocol amen dment  is required,  the ICF  may need  to be revised  to reflect  the changes to the 
protocol. If the ICF is revised, it must be  reviewed  and approved  by the appropriate IRB/IEC,  
and signed  by all patients  subsequently enrolled  in the study as well as  those currently  enrolled  in 
the study. 
 
All signed and  dated  ICFs  must remain  in each  patient’s  study file and must be available for 
verification  by PIs at any time.  
 
The rights, safety,  and well -being of the patients  are the most important considerations and  
should prevail over interests  of science and  society.

9. Study  Management  
9.1 Compliance  
 
9.1.1 Compliance with the Protocol  and Protocol Revisions  
The study shall be conducted  as described  in this approved protocol. All  revisions will  be 
approved by the sponsor. Investigators should not implement any  deviation or  change to the 
protocol  without prior review and documented approval of the HIC of an  amendment,  except  
where necessary  to eliminate an  immediate hazard(s)  to Patients.  
 
If a deviation or change to a protocol  is implemented to  eliminate an  immediate hazard  prior to  
obtaining HIC approval, as  soon as  possible the deviation or change will  be submitted  to: 
• HIC for review and  approval 
• BMS  and Apexigen 
 
If an amendment substantially  alters  the study design  or increases  the potential risk  to the patient: 
(1) the consent  form  must be revised  and submitted to the HIC  for review and approval; (2) the 
revised  form  must be used to obtain  consent from  patients  currently  enrolled in the study if they  
are affected  by the amendment;  and (3) the new  form must be used  to obtain  consent from  new  
patients  prior to enrollment. 
 
9.1.2 Yale Safety Reporting  and Monitoring  (DSMP)  
The PI  and IND holders will  monitor  the clinical  trial for safety.  The PI  will assess all expedited  
adverse events  and will periodically  review all  adverse events observed  on the trial.  Yale Cancer  
Center standard  operating procedures (SOPs) for  assessment  and reporting  of adverse events  are 
followed which  are in compliance with  21 CFR  312.32 and  312.22. 
 
The clinical  trial data consisting  of all  required  observations, AEs,  and laboratory data are 
entered  into a computerized  database in a timely  manner.  The accuracy  and completeness  of the 
database,  timely  submission of SAEs  and compliance with  the protocol, is  assured  by periodic 
auditing  conducted  by the Yale Cancer Center  Office  of Protocol Review  and Monitoring, which  
reports to the  Yale  Data Safety  & Monitoring Committee  (DSMC).  Safety  data will  be 
submitted  to the DSMC  at least  once  yearly  or more  often  as required  by the DSMP.  The DSMC  
will conduct an  internal audit of the study every  6-12 months, per institutional requirements.  On 
a regular interval  basis, status reports of all  laboratory parameters,  AEs  and SAEs  are reviewed  
by the PI  to view  composite data across  subjects.   Regular meetings  are held to discuss ongoing 
patient  treatment  and adverse events.  
 
Expedited SAE reports submitted  by the Investigator to FDA are also  copied to the HIC  and 
other relevant institutional  safety  committees  within the timeframes  required by Yale.  These will 
also be copied  to BMS  and Apexigen.   The Principal  Investigator will distribute manufacturer - 
provided safety  reports and updated Toxicity  Lists  to the institution’s  HIC  and all relevant  
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  118 of 135 Confidential  
  
  
 
personnel involved in the conduct of the study. The Toxicity  List, in addition  to the 
Investigator’s Brochure, will  be used as a reference for reporting any new SAE.  
 
Possible actions  taken  by the PI  or the Yale DSMC  if a new unexpected  toxicity  is identified  
from  the above safety  review, or if  the periodic review of all  adverse events  and laboratory data 
indicates  a pattern  of incidence or severity  of toxicity  that raises  a safety  concern,  can be to: 
1. Revise consent  form  
2. Amend  the protocol 
3. Suspend the protocol 
 
All AEs found to be  expected  or non- serious,  will be included in the  Annual Report.  AEs 
considered to be  serious will be communicated  to the  industry collaborators Bristol -Myers 
Squibb and  Apexigen  within  24 hours. 
During the study, the DSMC  will perform  routine monitoring  visits to review protocol 
compliance,  compare CRFs and  individual patients’  medical  records,  assess drug accountability, 
and ensure that the  study is being conducted according  to pertinent  regulatory requirements.  CRF  
entries  will be verified  with source documentation. The review of medical  records  will be 
performed  in a manner  to ensure that  patient  confidentiality  is maintained.  
 
Yale University  will take particular  care in ensuring that original imaging source  data (images,  
echo  images,  etc.)  are maintained  and accessible for  monitoring, and  that these  original source 
data are then  archived  on a long -term basis  in compliance with  ICH GCP  (Section  9.1). These  
images  must be  stored in a  secure location  until the  Sponsor (or designee) authorizes their  
destruction, and  must be retrievable by study patient number in the event  of an  audit. 
 
9.1.2.1 Source Documentation  
All data obtained during this study should be entered  into the CRFs  promptly. All source 
documents  from  which  CRF  entries  are derived  should be placed  in the patient’s  medical  
records.  CRF fields  for which source documents will typically  be needed  include laboratory 
assessments,  physical exam reports, nursing notes, ECG recordings, hospital records,  and CT or 
MRI  reports.  
 
The CRFs  for each  patient will  be checked  against  source documents  at the study site by the Site 
Monitor. 
 
Instances  of missing  or uninterpretable data will  be discussed  with the Investigator for resolution. 
 
9.1.3 Investigational  Site Training  
The Sponsor or designee will provide quality  investigational  staff training prior to study 
initiation.  Training  topics  will include but are not limited  to: GCP,  AE reporting,  study details  
and procedure,  CRFs,  study  documentation,  informed consent, and  enrollment  of WOCBP.  
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  119 of 135 Confidential  
  
  
 
9.2 Records  
 
9.2.1 Records  Retention  
The study site will maintain  a study file, which  should contain,  at minimum,  the Investigator’s 
Brochures, the protocol and any amendments,  the protocol  for tissue  sampling,  drug 
accountability  records,  correspondence with  the IEC/IRB  and the Sponsor (or designee), and  
other study- related  documents. 
 
The Sponsor agrees  to keep records  and those documents that  include but are not limited  to the 
identification  of all  participating  patients,  medical  records,  study- specific source  documents, 
source worksheets, all  original signed and  dated  ICFs,  copies  of all  eCRFs,  query responses,  and 
detailed  records  of drug disposition to enable evaluations  or audits  from  regulatory authorities  
and FivePrime or its designees. 
 
The Sponsor shall  retain  records  required  to be maintained  for a period of 5 years  following the 
date a marketing  application  in an  ICH region is approved for the drug for the indication  for 
which  it is being investigated  or, if no application  is to be filed  or if the application  is not 
approved for such indication, until at  least 5 years  after the investigation is discontinued. 
However,  these documents should be retained  for a longer period if required by the applicable 
regulations  or if needed  by the Sponsor.  In addition, the Investigator must make provision for the 
patients’ medical  records  to be kept for the same period of time.  
 
No data should be destroyed  without the agreement  of the Sponsor. Should the Investigator wish 
to assign  the study records to another party  or move  them  to another location, the Sponsor must 
be notified in writing  of the  new responsible person and/or the new location.  
 
Patients’ medical  records  and other original  data will  be archived  in accordance with  the 
archiving regulations  or facilities  of the investigational site. 
 
9.2.2 Study  Drug  Records  
It is the  responsibility  of the Investigator to ensure that  a current  disposition record  of each  study 
drug is maintained  at each study site where study drugs are inventoried and dispensed. Records  
or logs  must comply  with applicable regulations and guidelines and  should include: 
• Amount  received  and placed  in storage area  
• Amount  currently  in storage area 
• Label  identification  number or batch number 
• Amount  dispensed  to and  returned  by each patient,  including unique patient  identifiers  
• Non-study disposition (e.g., lost, wasted)  
• Amount  destroyed at  study  site, if applicable  
• Amount  returned  to designated  parties  
 
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  Version  10 21-Mar-2022 
Page  120 of 135 Confidential  
  
  
 
• Dates  and initials  of person responsible for  Investigational Product 
dispensing/accountability as per the Delegation  of Authority Form.  
 
9.2.2.1 Case Report  Forms  
An Investigator is required  to prepare and maintain adequate and  accurate  case histories  designed 
to record  all observations and other data pertinent  to the investigation on each  individual  treated  
or entered  as a control  in the  investigation. Data that are derived  from source  documents  and 
reported  on the electronic CRF  (eCRF) must be consistent with  the source  documents  or the 
discrepancies  must be explained.  
 
eCRFs  will be prepared  for all data collection  fields  except  for fields  specific to SAEs  and 
pregnancy, which  will be reported  on the paper  SAE  form  and Pregnancy  Surveillance form, 
respectively.  Spaces  may  be left  blank  only in those circumstances  permitted  by study -specific  
CRF  completion  guidelines. 
 
The confidentiality  of records that  could  identify  patients must be  protected, respecting  the 
privacy  and confidentiality  rules  in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
The Investigator will  maintain a  signature sheet to document  signatures and  initials  of all  persons 
authorized  to make entries  and/or corrections  on CRFs.  
 
The completed CRF , including any paper  SAE/pregnancy report  forms,  must be promptly 
reviewed,  signed, and  dated by the Investigator or qualified  physician who  is a subinvestigator 
and who  is delegated  this task on the Delegation  of Authority Form.  For eCRFs, review  and 
approval/signature is completed  electronically  using the Yale electronic data  capture tool.  
 
The PI  must retain  a copy  of the CRFs including  records  of the changes and corrections.  Each  
individual electronically  signing eCRFs  must meet the  PI’s training  requirements  and must only 
access  the PI’s electronic  data capture tool using the unique user  account  provided by the PI.  
User accounts  are not to be shared  or reassigned  to other individuals.

Notes  for Phase  1 Dose  Escalation  Schedule  of Assessments 
a. Unless  specified,  prior to  infusion  procedures are to be completed  within  24 hours  of scheduled  time point  and to be synchronized with administration  of assigned  study  drug.  Any clinical  
assessment, laboratory  study,  or additional non- specified  tests may be obtained at any time,  if clinically  indicated.  
b. Each  cycle will be 14 days long, with administration  of cabiralizumab,  APX005M,  + nivolumab on Day  1; a ± 2 day window  is allowed  for Day 1starting  with Cycle 3. 
c. Standard  physical examination  will be performed  as determined  by the Investigator,  particularly  to follow  physical  findings  to resolution.  Targeted  physical  exams  should be conducted at any time 
to follow  up on AE reports.  A symptom -directed  physical exam  can be performed  for days 2, 3, and 8 of Cycles  1 and 2. 
d. Height  is only required  to be recorded  at screening. Weight  is required  to be recorded  at Day 1 of each cycle. Dose  will be adjusted  only if weight change  is >10%  from  first dose  on Cycle 1 Day 1. 
e. Vital  signs  include  pulse, respiratory  rate, blood pressure,  and temperature in the resting position  (sitting  or supine).  Measure prior to  dose and after completion  of each IV infusion for all cycles.  
For Day 1 of Cycles  1 and 2 only,  additionally  measure  vital signs  4 hours  (+ 30 min) post -APX005M  infusion.  Pulse  oximetry  is performed  at rest prior  to dosing for day 1 of each cycle and 
otherwise  as clinically  indicated.  At the Investigator’s  discretion, vital sign  monitoring may be extended  beyond  the time points  specified.  Additional measures  should be performed  as clinically  
indicated.  
f. Patient ECOG  Status  assessments are to be performed  within  72 hours  prior to  dosing  (Day  1 of each cycle).  
g. Screening  labs include  serology for Hepatitis  B (HBsAg)  and Hepatitis  C (HCV antibody).  
h. Clinical Safety  Labs:  
Hematology including CBC with differential,  platelets,  hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC,  and RBC indices 
Chemistry  includes  CK (creatine  kinase),  AST  (aspartate transaminase),  ALT  (alanine  transaminase), alkaline  phosphatase,  bicarbonate,  bilirubin, (direct  and total), BUN (blood  urea nitrogen),  
calcium,  chloride,  creatinine, glucose,  LDH (lactate  dehydrogenase),  phosphorus,  potassium,  sodium, and, if applicable,  serum  pregnancy.  Albumin,  amylase,  lipase,  thyroid panel includes  TSH,   
Free T4, PT/INR,  and PTT (aPTT)  perform at Screening  and as indicated.  If CK elevation  is clinically  significant,    obtain  troponins  (cardiac and skeletal), CK isoenzymes,  aldolase,  and ECG;  
repeat CK and these additional  tests within  48 hours  or other  interval as clinically  indicated,  until resolved    or stable.  If either  AST  or ALT  is elevated,  obtain total  serum  bilirubin,  alkaline  
phosphatase; repeat within  48 hours  or other  interval, as clinically  indicated,  until resolved  or stable. Additional  tests may be obtained  at any time,  if clinically  indicated.  
Urinalysis : Urine  dipstick will only be done  at screening,  and when  clinically  indicated.  
i. Obtain  ECG records at Screening  and the  Day 28 post  last infusion  End-of-Treatment  Visit.  Additional ECGs  should  be obtained at any  time,  if serum  CK or cardiac troponin is elevated;  if 
abnormal (excluding sinus  tachycardia),  ECGs  should  be obtained  (if clinically  indicated),  until the abnormality  is resolved  or clinically  stable. Additional ECGs  may be obtained at any time, if 
clinically  indicated.  ECGs  for each  patient should  be obtained from  the same  machine  whenever possible. To minimize  variability, it is  important that patients  be in a resting  position  for at least  
5 minutes  prior  to each ECG  evaluation. Body  position  should  be consistently  maintained  for each ECG  evaluation  to prevent changes  in heart  rate. Environmental  distractions  (e.g., television,  
radio,  conversation)  should be avoided  during  the pre-ECG resting  period  and during  ECG recording.  
j. P ET CT, CT scans  or MRI of the Tumor  sites and MRI  brain  measured  as per Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in Solid  Tumors  (RECIST  v1.1).  If patient  terminates  prior to  scheduled  CT or MRI  
scans,  patient should  have scans  done  at End-of-Treatment  Visits  (does  not need to be repeated  if performed  within  8 weeks  prior to  End-of-Treatment Visits  or if tumor  progression was previously 
determined).  Patients  who enter Long -Term  Follow -up while  showing clinical  benefit  should  have  tumor  assessments q12w  for duration  of response. The same  measuring modality  should be used 
by the site to maintain  consistency  across  the various  time points. (Documentation of skin lesions  by color photography, including a ruler to  measure  the size  of the lesion, is  suggested and should 
follow  the CT or MRI  schedule.) If there  is a contraindication  to brain  MRI, CT  head with and without contrast can be performed.  
k. Performed  every  8 weeks  (±7 days)  from  the first dose for the first 4 months  for patients  who remain  on treatment and  every  12 weeks  (±7 days)  thereafter and 28 days  (± 7 days)  after the last dose 
of study treatment. The  exception  is MRI  of the brain,  which  can be performed every  6 months  in patients  with NSCLC  and RCC, unless  clinically  indicated  to be done  in shorter intervals.  CT or 
MRI  scans do not need to be repeated  if performed  within  8 weeks  prior  to the End-of-Treatment Visits  or if tumor  progression was previously determined.  
l. Al l  women  of childbearing  potential will have a serum  pregnancy test at screening, and urine  pregnancy  test on Day  1 of each cycle and at  the End-of-Treatment Visits.  
m. Biopsy  at primary  tumor  or metastatic tumor  site will be collected  at screening  [at least 24 hours  prior  to dosing]  and prior  to Cycle 5 Day 1 [within  7 days prior to Cycle 5 Day 1 and at least 24 
hours  prior  to dosing]. It is recommended  that patients  who have documented  response  receive another biopsy within  28 (±14)  days post tumor  assessment and/or patient  who have progression 
receive  another  biopsy  at the final End-of–Treatment  visit. The post-response  and post-progression biopsies  are optional. Collect an  FFPE tissue  block  or 10 slides  of archival tumor  sample  at 
Screening.  
n. Serum  PK for APX005M  and ADA samples  will be collected  as indicated  in Appendix C. 
o. Samples will be collected  for PD and biomarker  analyses for correlative studies.  
p. Biomarker  blood sample  collection  will be collected  on Day 1, 2, 3, and 8 of Cycles  1 and 2, and on Day 1 of every  cycle thereafter.  See Appendix C and D for further information.  
q.Nivolumab and cabiralizumab  will both  be administered  by IV infusion over 30 minutes  (± 5 minutes). APX005M  will be administered  by IV infusion over 60 minutes. Nivolumab will be given  
CA025 -007 Clinical  Protocol  31-Mar- 2020 
Page  126 of 135 Confidential   
  
 
first (in Cohorts  2, 4, and 6), with a 30- to 60-minute  rest, followed  by cabiralizumab  as a 30-minute  infusion.  APX005M  will be administered  30 minutes  after cabiralizumab  and will be given for 
a 60 minute  infusion  period.  For Cohorts  1, 3, and 5, cabiralizumab  will be given first, followed  by APX005M with  the same  parameters as above.  
r. Cabiralizumab  and APX005M  will be administered  every  2 weeks  in 14-day cycles for cohorts  1, 3, and 5. Nivolumab, cabiralizumab,  and APX005M will  be administered  every  2 weeks  in 14-day 
cycles for cohorts  2, 4, and 6.  The dosing  may continue  until PD or unacceptable  toxicity.  
s. These  assessments are to be performed  prior to  each dose (with  the exceptions  noted  in Appendix C) for those  patients  who continue  treatment without signs  of progressive  disease  or toxicity.  
t. Patients  should be contacted  every  12 (±2) weeks  for survival status.  Patients  should  have  tumor  scans  every  8 weeks  for the first 4 months  on study  drugs,  followed  by every12 (±2) weeks 
thereafter, if tumor progression was not previously  determined  and/or  use of subsequent anti -cancer therapy  has not been initiated. Any new anti-cancer therapy  should be documented.

Exploratory endpoints will include description  of antitumor  activity  of APX005M administered  
in combination  with  nivolumab  and cabiralizumab  as measured  in mandatory serial  tumor  biopsy 
and blood collection  specimens.   Biopsies  will be taken  pre-treatment  (at least 24 hours prior to  
dosing), before Cycle 5 Day  1 (within  7 days and at least  24 hours prior to  dosing), and  at time  of 
disease progression, if  this occurs.   PBMCs  (for CyTOF  and single  cell RNA Seq) and  plasma  
(for ELISA  cytokine panel)  samples  will also be collected  at the same time points. These  
samples  will be used  to study biomarkers to assess for prediction  of response or resistance to 
therapy  and to search  for pharmacodynamic indicators  of anti -tumor activity.   Tumor  assessment  
will include the following: 
• Routine histologic examination  
• Quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF)  
• Flow cytometry  by CyTOF  
• Single cell  RNA -seq studies  
 
QIF utilizing  formalin -fixed  paraffin  embedded  (FFPE) tumors  will be profiled  for: 
 
Marker  expression  will be analyzed  in responders  versus  non-responders.   Assays for the 
biomarkers  listed  in the  table above have already  been  developed. 
 
Flow cytometry  by CyTOF  will be performed  on tumor infiltrating  immune  cells  and PBMCs  to 
explore and  potentially  validate  the markers  outlined  for QIF.  We will  profile  shifts  in TAM  
types from pre -treatment  to post -treatment initiation  and will also measure production of TNF -α, 
IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-12, p40, CCL3,  CCL4,  and CCL5.  Cell sorting by FACS  will be performed  for 
CD3,  CD4,  and CD68.  We aim  to determine the functional properties of the immune  infiltrates  
in promoting or inhibiting  tumor growth. 
Biomarkers of effect  for cabiralizumab  include: 
• Peripheral  blood changes  in CD14+/CD16hi non-classical  monocytes 
Biomarkers of effect  for APX005M include: 
• Peripheral  blood analysis  for antigen presenting cell activation  using flow cytometry: Cell 
surface immune  markers that will be examined  include but are not limited  to: CD19,

CD123,  CD11c, CD86,  MHC  class  I and II, CD70, CD54. 
 
Please note  that patients  undergoing core biopsy will be required  to provide two  cores  for these 
analysis  – one snap frozen and  one paraffin  embedded. 
 
All samples  will be banked  at Yale in the Kluger laboratory.

Appendix  E:  Biopsy Requirements 
 
Biopsy  at primary  tumor  or metastatic tumor site are mandatory and will be collected  at: 
• At time of screening  
o At least 24 hours  prior to dosing 
 
• Prior  to Cycle 5 Day  1 
o Within  7 days  prior to Cycle  5 Day  1 and  at least  24 hours  prior to dosing 
 
It is recommended that patients  who  have documented  response receive another  biopsy within  28 (±14)  
days post tumor  assessment  and/or  patients  who have progression receive another  biopsy at the final 
End-of–Treatment visit.  The post-response  and post-progression biopsies  are optional. 
 
If available,  patients  will be required  to provide an archival  FFPE  tissue  block as  well at screening.  
Patients  undergoing  core  biopsy for the study will be required  to provide two cores  for these analysis – 
one snap  frozen  and one paraffin  embedded.

ZOLL Pittsburgh 1. INTRODUCTION 
ZOLL has released (CE marked) its latest softwa re version of the LifeVest 4000, modified for 
the collection of data relevant to the heart failure patient population.  Like all wearable 
defibrillators, this version also monitors for VT /VF, notifies the patient if VT/VF occurs and 
instructs them to press response buttons.  If the patient is unresponsive to the alarms, the 
LifeVest delivers defibrillation therapy. Versions of the LifeVest have been used commercially in the United States and Europe since 2002, with over 100,000 patients having 
worn the device.  There are many published ar ticles regarding clinical performance of the 
LifeVest (Appendix A). The LifeVest general use and performance data are published 
regularly on the commercial website www.zoll.com . 
This software version has modification s that include but are not limited to: 
 Body position data collection 
 Activity data collection 
 The ability to perform a health survey 
 The ability to guide patients through a walk test  
 
2. DEVICE DESCRIPTION 
A complete description of the operation and management of the LifeVest is given in the 
Operator Manual (20B0048). 
2.1 Description of Heart Trends modifica tion for heart failure monitoring 
2.1.1 Body Position : This metric uses the acceleromete r in the LifeVest belt node to 
measure body position trends.  It is reporte d as a percent time of day at lying flat, 
reclined (and at what degree), or standing.   This may be used to indicate body 
position during sleep.  Fluid buildup in the lungs often causes patients to add 
pillows or sleep in a reclining chair to alleviate their symptoms.  Changing body 
angle during sleep is an established indicator of worsening heart failure. 
2.1.2 Body Orientation:   This metric uses the accelerome ter in the LifeVest belt node 
to measure sleeping position.  It is repo rted as a percent time of day at lying 
supine, prone, left or right.   
2.1.3 Activity Trends : The patient activity metric uses  the accelerometer in the belt 
node to measure patient movement.  It is reported as hours active per day and 
total number of steps taken.  
Decreases in activity may represent an in crease in heart failure symptoms, while 
an increase in activity may represent posi tive effects of the patient’s medical 
treatment. 
2.1.4 Heart Rate Trends : The heart rate (HR) metric uses the existing HR software to 
provide a moving average of HR.  It is reported as minimum, maximum, and 5 
minute averages.  This information may be useful in heart failure diagnostics, as 
high resting HR has been associated with increased mortality, and effective 
therapy generally lowers HR. 
2.1.5 Walk Test:   A six-minute walk test (6MWT) is a valuable tool used by physicians 
to measure subject’s functional capacity.  It is intended to be performed in an 
ZOLL Document Number:  90D0120 Page 5 of   20 
LifeVest Trends Validation Protocol B 
 ___________________________________________________________________________________________  
 
     
ZOLL Pittsburgh outpatient setting by having subjects wa lk a premeasured path as long and fast 
as they can within a 6-minute timeframe.  The distance walked in relationship to 
the length of time is used to make a determination regarding improvement or 
decline in functional capacity.  A similar test has been added to the LifeVest, but 
is patient-initiated, and is conducted in the patient’s home.  The program reports 
HR and step count during the test, as we ll as the recovery period. The LifeVest 
can also calculate the distance covered by the patient if an average stride length 
is entered. 
2.1.6 Health Survey:   The health survey is a short questionnaire that is administered 
via the LifeVest Monitor.  It can be co nducted daily or weekly, and the physician 
can customize which questions should be asked.

3. OBJECTIVES 
The primary objectives are to document the pr ecision of the HF metrics measurements, and 
to demonstrate that they are comparable to results from other traditional methods of 
measurement. The specific primary objectives are: 
3.1 To observe the relationship of the step count  and distance measure of the LifeVest walk 
test as performed by patients with heart fa ilure by comparison to distance measure of 
the medically supervised six-minute walk test, and  
3.2 To observe the accuracy of daily heart rate, a ctivities, and body position in patients with 
heart failure by comparison to patient da iries of activity and sleeping position. 
Secondary objectives are to obse rve patient interactions with the Trends user interface. The 
specific secondary objectives are: 
3.3 To observe compliance with answering quest ions regarding health through a wearable 
defibrillator, and  
3.4 To observe compliance with instructions gi ven through a wearable defibrillator in the 
performance of a Walk Test, and  
Further secondary objectives are to observ e patient interactions with the wearable 
defibrillator itself. The specific tertiary objectives are: 
3.5 To observe compliance with wearable defibr illator use during the study period, and 
3.6 To observe patient-device interactions during  a ventricular arrhythmia, if any should 
occur during the study period.

ZOLL Pittsburgh  
5.8 Shock Event Case Report Form 
If any subject receives a shock while usin g the WCD, a Shock Event Case Report Form 
must be completed. The data for the form may be acquired by phone or chart review, 
and does not require an additional subject visit. 
 
6. EVALUATION OF RESULTS 
Comparisons will be made between six minute wa lk as performed using the standard method 
with medical supervision, the Walk Test pr ompted by the WCD in the same (clinical) 
environment, and the Walk Test prompted by  the WCD outside the clinic. Distance will be 
used to compare the standard method with the WCD method performed within the same 
environment. Step count will be used to compare WCD methods. Odd and even numbered 
subjects will have outpatient WCD results anal yzed separately and combined. Paired or 
independent t-test methods w ill be used as appropriate. 
Patient Diaries will be qualitatively compared to the position, orientation, and activity 
metrics recorded by the WCD, as well as to the results of the Health Survey. 
Health Survey results will be qualitativel y and quantitatively correlated (Pearson or 
Spearman as appropriate) to the position, orient ation, and activity metrics recorded by the 
WCD. Health Survey results will also be compar ed to the position, orientation, and activity 
metrics recorded by the WCD. 
Heart Rate metrics will be evaluated by compar ison (t-test) with a random and non-random 
sampling of ECG data recorded by the WCD. At a minimum, one random sample per week 
will be compared to the Heart Rate metrics. 
All data will be analyzed and reviewed for intervariable trends and correlations.  
 
7. RISKS AND BENEFITS 
Since subjects are selected from patients al ready wearing a WCD for medical reasons, the 
risks of the study relate entirely to the perfor mance of the Walk Test and the data collection 
involved. 
Some subjects may not be accustomed to walkin g for six minutes at a time. The extra exercise 
may result in sore muscles. A few subjects ma y experience cardiac ischemia while walking. 
Subjects are advised not to perform the Walk Test  or stop the test if they feel any cardiac 
symptoms.  If the patient does not adhere to th ese directives, it is possible that a myocardial 
infarction may occur, with pain, hospitalization or even death as a result.  
Although subjects will not receiv e direct personal or health benefits from taking part in this 
study, the study may be helpful to future pa tients by providing information about using 
certain features of WCDs.  
 
8. SUBJECT CONSENT AND CONFIDENTIALITY 
ZOLL Document Number:  90D0120 Page 10 of   20 
LifeVest Trends Validation Protocol B

ZOLL Pittsburgh Each subject will be informed of the purpose of the investigation as well as the potential risks 
and benefits prior to their enrollment in the stud y.  The subject must freely sign the Informed 
Consent Form prior to subject enrollment. 
Each subject will receive a unique subject iden tification number.  The subject's name and 
identity will be known to the Investigator  and ZOLL (the “Sponsor”) but will be kept 
confidential.  Authorized personnel from the et hics committee and regulatory authorities may 
have access to original subject records. 
 
9. STUDY SIZE 
A minimum of 150 subjects and a maximum of 250 will be enrolled using five to twenty 
clinical centers.  
 
10. FORMS AND DATA HANDLING 
As with any study, accurate and timely comp letion of documentation is essential for the 
successful completion of the trial.  The Invest igator will be responsible for obtaining and 
maintaining Informed Consent Forms and Case  Report Forms (90D0120-CRF).  A copy of the 
signed Informed Consent Form will be given to  every subject.  A copy of each Case Report 
Form will be sent to the Sponsor, with th e originals maintained by the Investigator. 
 
11. ADVERSE EVENTS 
If a subject or person associated with the s ubject reports or otherwise indicates an adverse 
event occurred due to the performance of the st udy, specifically while performing the Walk 
Test or Health Survey, an Adverse Event Form must be filled out.  
Serious adverse events should be reported to  ZOLL immediately.  The reviewing ethics 
committee must also be noti fied within 10 working days. 
Muscle soreness or other activi ty-related symptoms due to the performance of a Walk Test 
are anticipated to occur in some subjects. 
All questions, complaints, or concerns regard ing anything other than the performance of the 
Walk Test or completing the Heath Survey shou ld be referred to customer support. These are 
not to be reported as adverse events. 
 
12. DATA ANALYSIS PLANS 
Data from all patients enrolled in the study that wear the WCD will be considered and/or 
analyzed and may be correlated with arrhyt hmias and other events recorded by the 
institution's monitoring system and patient cha rts.  The data stored in the monitor includes: 
 Automatically stored ECG recordings (including true arrhythmias and false 
arrhythmia declarations). 
 Manually stored ECG recordings. 
 Duration of time that the WCD was worn. 
 Noise, arrhythmia, and other internal event flags. 
ZOLL Document Number:  90D0120 Page 11 of   20 
LifeVest Trends Validation Protocol B 
 ___________________________________________________________________________________________  
 
     
ZOLL Pittsburgh  Device actions during a treatment se quence; i.e., transthoracic impedance 
measurement, energy delivered and outcome. 
 Patient device interactions, including patient use of the response buttons. 
The stored data will be analyzed and correlated to data recorded through Case Report Forms. 
The data will also be analyzed to determine frequency of noise events, frequency of false 
arrhythmia events, and percentage of subject wear time.  The results obtained will be 
compared with the results of commercial LifeVest use.  
 
13. ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITIES 
ZOLL, the Sponsor, is responsible for study ad ministration and providing devices and related 
materials for the study.   
The Sponsor will designate one or more approp riately trained and qualified individuals to 
monitor the investigation.  These individuals will conduct at least one pre-investigation on-
site visit and one on-site visit during the invest igation to verify the adherence to procedures 
specified in the protocol, and verify mainte nance of required subject and data records.  
Monitoring activities will be conducted accordin g to ZOLL's Monitoring of Clinical Studies 
Standard Operating Procedure (ZOLL 90D0013) and will be documented. 
The Investigator is responsible for obtaining and maintaining ethics approval of the study 
protocol.  The Investigator is responsible for obtaining patient consent, and maintaining 
Informed Consent Forms and Case Report Forms for each subject.  The Investigator is 
responsible for maintaining records of study protocol deviations and amendments and all 
correspondence relating to the study.  The Sp onsor will provide an Inve stigator Notebook for 
this purpose.  At the conclusion of the stud y, the Investigator will provide a report to the 
Sponsor and the ethics committee. 
If the device malfunctions or fails to function  as expected, the Investigator must report the 
incident to ZOLL immediately. 
Patient identities will be kept confidential; ho wever, ZOLL may provide study results to the 
USA’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory agencies.

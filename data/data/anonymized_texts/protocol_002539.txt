Protocol Body
1.0 Objectives
1.1To determine  the efficacy and toxicity of radiation therapy alone  in treating stage 1 and 2 MALT lymphoma for newly 
diagnosed patients and for the patients who failed other treatment modalities.  
2.0 Background
2.1Rationale- MALT lymphoma is a relatively  recently described  entity which is also known  as extranodal  marginal zone 
lymphoma (1)(2)(3)(4).  It was initially  recognized in gastrointestinal  tract with the majority arising from the stomach. 
Nowadays, however, about 30 to 40% of the MALT lymphomas are  thought  to be of  non-gastrointestinal origin according 
to the M.D.  Anderson Cancer Center lymphoma data base  and others (5). Though MALT  lymphoma constitute  about 7 to 
8%(6) of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, prospective  clinical trials are  scarce and optimal  treatments still remain to be defined. 
It is generally considered to be a low grade lymphoma at early state  (7)(8) having a very favorable prognosis even after 
localized treatments such  as radiation therapy of surgical resection alone (9)(10). Most of  the data on the treatments of 
MALT lymphoma come from experiences in gastric MALT  lymphoma (11)(12)(13). There have been multiple  
retrospective series suggestive of favorable outcome for these patients. However, the first report on a prospective clinical 
trial in managing Ann Arbor stage  1 and 2 gastric MALT  lymphoma with  radiation therapy  alone was published in 1998 
and has been  recently updated (14)(15). Twenty nine patients  were treated with a median  dose of 30 Gy (range 22.5 to 
43.5) delivered  at 1.5 Gy per fraction  to the stomach and adjacent lymph  nodes. At a median follow-up of 30 months, 94 
% remain disease free. Non-gastric MALT  lymphomas (16) (3)(5) have been reported  in sites such as bowel (17) lung 
(18), breast (19)(20), skin (21), thyroid gland  (22), bladder (23)(24),  liver (25) dura (26)(27), esophagus (28) ocular 
adnexa (29)(30)  along with other head  and neck series  limited by a small  number of patients  treated in a variety of 
different ways  including  any combination of chemotherapy, radiation  therapy and surgery,  thus yielding no significant 
insights into the optimal treatment except for the impression  that most of them are very localized  disease with  favorable 
prognosis probably  comparable to that of gastric MALT lymphoma (7). Therefore, we propose to prospectively study the 
efficacy and toxicity of radiation treatment for patients with stage  1 and 2 non-gastric MALT lymphoma  as well as to verify 
the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center data on gastric MALT lymphoma. Of note,  a recent  publication from the 
Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma  Classification  Project reported  an overall failure free survival of about  70% or  higher if the 
International Prognostic Index is less than 4 in their retrospective analysis  of 72 patients  with stage 1 to 4 MALT 
lymphoma (33). Zinzani et al reported  5 year treatment failure  rate of  70% for  their review of  47 patients with stage 1 and 
2 non-gastric MALT lymphoma(16). Based on the failure free survival curves presented in these  studies, we believe  it is a 
very reasonable hypothesis to test 75% or higher relapse  free survival  at 5 years with the majority of the relapses 
occurring within the first 5 years in our group of patients.
The data on the outcomes  of the patients  who relapse after initial  treatment are  lacking.  The same statistical analysis 
and stopping rule will apply to the patients  who are enrolled in this protocol after failure  to initial treatment, though this 
may be very stringent  criteria  for this patient population. 
2.2Preliminary Data- We have recently reported  our experience with 39  consecutive  patients with MALT lymphoma with 
supradiaphragmatic presentation  seen at M.D. Anderson  Cancer Center between  1991 and  1997 (34). Ten of them were 
treated with radiation  therapy alone.  Two of them had stage  2 disease. The median dose was 39.6 Gy  at 1.5 to 2.0 Gy 
per fraction. Everyone achieved a clinical complete response. At a median  follow-up of 26 months, everyone is alive. Two 
patients experienced recurrence. Both of the recurrences were  in the stomach. They were successfully salvaged, 
rendering every patient free of disease  at the last follow-up. Of note is six of  these 10  patients had primary conjunctiva 
lymphoma making  the scope of this experience quite limited.  We now propose  to extend radiation treatment  as the only 
modality to stage 1 and 2 non-gastric MALT lymphomas in general.
3.0 Background Drug Information
Cytotoxic drugs are not a planned  part of treatment in this protocol.
4.0 Patient Eligibility
4.1Inclusion Criteria
4.1.1 Patients with newly diagnosed  stage 1 and 2 MALT lymphoma are  eligible for this study. 
4.1.2 Patients with H. pylori positive gastric MALT lymphoma are recommended to have 
treatments with antibiotics prior to enrollment  to this protocol. 
4.1.3 Patients who failed other  treatment  modalities (e.g. chemotherapy, antibiotics therapy  etc) are also 
eligible as far as they never  had stage 3 or 4 disease during the course  of the disease or disease progression to the 
opposite side of the diaphragm. (As the time course of the response to  antibiotic therapy can be  very variable among  
patients, sometimes requiring more than one year for complete response, failure to  antibiotic therapy  can be very 
variable among  patients, sometimes  requiring more than one  year for complete response,  failure to antibiotic  treatment  
will be defined  as no response or progression of the disease documented by endoscopy and biopsy.) 
4.1.4 Patients who have had stage 4 diseases due to  bilateral parotid gland  or ocular/ocular adnexal  
involvement or due to multiple sites within  Waldeyer’s ring will still be eligible.
4.2Exclusion  Criteria
4.2.1 Patients who had previous  radiation  dose to the site of the current primary  disease which would lead to 
violation of known radiation tolerance limit of that particular site if treated again.
4.2.2 Patients with MALT lymphoma of the skin whose  lesions are separated  by more than 5 cm  will be ineligible.
4.2.3 Previous or concurrent  malignancy  in any form would not be an  exclusion criterion. However, patients who 
receive chemotherapy  for concurrent  malignancy  will be  excluded from statistical analysis.
4.2.4 Low blood cell counts would  not be exclusion criteria as far as the patient  is willing to accept supportive 
measures such  as transfusions, filgrastim  and epoetin.
5.0 Treatment  Plan
5.1 Radiation  treatment will consist  of involved field radiation therapy to primary site and adjacent lymphatics  (if 
indicated). Initial fields to encompass the tumor  site and  the suspected microscopic  disease will be taken to 30 to 30.6 Gy. 
Boost to the gross disease  to 36 is indicated in some patients when tumor  is larger than 5 cm. The only exception  would be  
orbital or ocular  adnexal lymphoma which  may be treated to the final dose of 30 Gy or 30.6 Gy.
a) CT Planning is required for every  patient unless it is technically not feasible.  The only exception would be  MALT  
lymphoma of the skin which may be treated  with electron beams.
b) Though  involved field radiation  therapy  to stomach only is recommended for stage 1 gastric MALT lymphoma, 
generous fields to encompass  the peri-gastric  and celiac  lymph nodes are recommended  if the patient presents with 
recurrent or refractory  disease after chemotherapy. Every attempt  needs to  be made to preserve the function of the left 
kidney by using oblique  fields  after the initial AP-PA fields are  taken to the kidney  tolerance. The gastric fields  need to be 
simulated and treated with empty stomach  for optimum reproducibility. 
6.0 Pretreatment  evaluation  
See Appendix  A
6.1 A complete  history and physical examination including performance status (Appendix B)
6.2 Laboratory studies will include  a CBC with differential, platelet count, electrolytes, biochemical survey,  TSH (if  
indicated due to the site of the disease), and beta-2 microglobulin. Imaging studies will include PA and lateral chest 
roentgenograms, CT of the neck,  chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Esophogogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) needs to be done for 
every patient. If EGD is positive, colonoscopy along with small bowel series  will be  performed. Unilateral bone marrow 
biopsies will be obtained prior to initiation  of therapy.
6.3 Location, type and size of all measurable  lesions  must be recorded  prior to treatment.
7.0 Evaluation During and After Treatment
(See Appendix A)
7.1 Patients will be followed while  on treatment  with CBC with differential  and platelet  count only as clinically indicated. 
These will be also obtained  at the follow-up visits.
7.2 A biochemical  survey will be performed  before radiation therapy and at  the follow-up visits.
7.3 All initially abnormal imaging studies  and endoscopies will be performed 3 months  after completion of radiation 
therapy and yearly thereafter. Additional studies will be  obtained only if indicated by the interval  history and physical 
examination.
7.4 The follow-up visits will be done  between 6 weeks to two months, and  then every 3-4 months  for the first year, every 
4-6 months for the second year,  every 6 months  for the third  & fourth year, and once a year thereafter or  as per physician’s 
discretion.
Please note:  The post-treatment lab test and follow-up visits  can be  done less often (than previously stated) depending  on the 
clinical judgment of the physicians.
8.0 Criteria for Response and Toxicity
(See Appendices  C and E)
8.1 Tumor Measurements
a. Lesions will be measured in centimeters prior to the course of  therapy.
b. The longest diameter and its perpendicular  will be measured  for bi-dimensionally measured lesion.  Size will be 
reported as the product of the diameters.
c. Measurements should be made  and recorded by the physician.
d. An estimate of overall objective  and subjective response  will be  made and recorded at each  visit.
e. Endoscopy findings will be mapped out.
8.2Response Definitions
a) Clinical responses- The guidelines from the ‘Report of an  International Workshop to Standardized Response Criteria 
for Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma’  will be followed (35). (See Appendix E for Summary of Response  Criteria for Non-Hodgkin’s 
Lymphoma)
CR – 1) Complete disappearance  of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of disease  and disappearance  of all 
disease-related symptoms if present before  therapy, and  normalization of  the biochemical abnormalities (eg, lactate 
dehydrogenase [LDH]  definitely assignable to lymphoma).
2) All lymph nodes and nodal masses  must  have regressed  to normal size (< 1.5 cm in their greatest transverse diameter  for 
nodes >1.5 cm before  therapy.) Previously involved nodes that were 1.1 to  1.5 cm in their  greatest transverse diameter before 
treatment must have decreased to < 1 cm in their greatest  transverse diameter  after  treatment, or by more than 75% in  the sum 
of the products of the greatest  diameters  (SPD).
3) Any macroscopic  nodules in any organs detectable on imaging techniques should no longer be present.
4) Flow cytometric, molecular, or cytogenetic studies are not considered  part of routine  assessment to document persistent 
disease at the present time. 
CR/unconfirmed (Cru)  – 1) Those patients who fulfill criteria 1 and  3 above, but with one or more of the following features: 
A residual lymph node mass greater than 1.5 cm in greatest transverse diameter  that has regressed by more than 75% in  the 
SPD. Individual nodes that were  previously confluent must have regressed by more than 75% in their SPD compared  with the 
size of the original mass.
PR – 1) > 50% decrease in SPD of the six largest dominant nodes or nodal  masses. These  nodes or masses should  be 
selected according to the following features:  (a) they should  be clearly measurable in  at least two  perpendicular  dimension, (b) 
they should be from as disparate regions of the body as possible, and  (c) they should be included mediastinal  and 
retroperitoneal areas  of disease whenever these sites are involved. 
2) No increase in the size of the nodes, liver, or spleen. 
3) No new sites of disease.
Stable disease is defined as less than a PR (see above) but is not progressive disease  (see below).
Relapsed disease (CR, Cru) – 1) Appearance  of any  new lesion  or increase by >50% in the size of previously involved  sites. 
2) >50% increase  in greatest diameter of any previously identified  node greater than 1 cm its short axis or in the SPD of more  
than one node.
Progressive disease  (PR, nonresponders)  – 1 >50%  increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously  identified abnormal  
node for PRs or nonresponders.  2) Appearance  of any new lesion during or at the end of  therapy.
b. Response Assessment
Response is assessed on the basis  of clinical radiologic,  and pathologic (i.e, bone marrow) criteria.  CT scans remain 
the standard  for evaluation  of nodal disease.  Thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic  CT scans  are recommended even if those 
areas were not initially involved  because  of the unpredictable pattern of recurrence.
A bone  marrow  aspirate  and biopsy should only be performed to confirm a CR if it is clinically indicated  by new  
abnormalities in the peripheral blood counts or blood smear.
c. Response durations  are measured from the time of response  (not the beginning  of treatment)  until there  is evidence 
of progressive disease. Progression free survival will be measured from protocol entry.
8.3 Frequency of Response Determination:  All lesions must be  measured at baseline  and then as per section 7.4
8.4 Survival Durations: The survival  of patients will be measured from entry into protocol. 
8.5 All toxicities encountered during the study will be evaluated according to  the grading system (0-4) in Appendix C. 
Duration and treatment will be recorded. Life-threatening toxicities should be  reported immediately to the study chairman 
who in turn must notify the IRB. Should  this occur, it will mandate  closure of the protocol  to patient entry for investigation as 
to the reasons for this and a decision  can be taken as to whether the protocol can remain open  or should be  closed.
9.0 Criteria for Removal from the Study
9.1Progressive  disease during radiation therapy  which encompasses all known tumors.
9.2The development of unacceptable  toxicity defined as unpredictable, irreversible, or Grade 4.
9.3Non-compliance by patient with protocol  requirements.
9.4Patient refusal.
10.0 Data and Protocol Management
10.1 Protocol  Compliance: The attending physician must see each patient prior to the start of irradiation and at each 
follow-up visit post-treatment. All required  interim  and pretreatment data should be  available and the physician  must  
make a designation as to tumor response and toxicity grade.
10.2 Data Entry: Data must  be entered into the Protocol  Data Management system  before therapy can be given. A 
brief explanation for required  but missing data should be recorded as a comment.
10.3 Accuracy of Data  Collection : The study chairman will be the final arbiter of  response or toxicity should  be a 
difference of opinion  exist.
11.0 Statistical Considerations and Stopping Rules
This is a trial to estimate the relapse-free  survival rate (RFS) of patients with gastric and non-gastric  MALT  lymphoma treated 
with radiation therapy alone. Patient  accrual  is expected to  be 10 – 15 per year for gastric and 5 – 10 per year for non-gastric 
MALT lymphoma at initial  presentation. Accrual  of less than 5 patients per year  for either  gastric or non-gastric MALT lymphoma 
is expected for presentation upon  failure of other treatment modalities. The patient accrual and  outcome analyses will be done 
separately in the following 4 groups: Gastric vs non-gastric MALT at initial presentation vs upon failure to  toher treatment(s).
Accrual goals
The accrual goals for the patients at initial presentation are 40 for gastric and 35 for non-gastric MALT lymphoma. Based  on the 
expectation that the relapse rate after radiation  therapy alone will be 25% and that 70% of the relapsing patients will fail within 5 
years, these  numbers  will provide  a 95% confidence bound  of +/- 5.9% for estimating  the 2-year RFS. This calculation assumes 
that RFS follows an exponential distribution  and we  will follow all patients  for at least  2 years.
Stopping Rules for patient accrual  at initial  presentation
Based on the expectation  that the relapse rate after radiation  therapy alone will be 25% or less, RFS will be evaluated in each of 
the two subgroups of previously untreated patients and accrual stopped in RFS is  < 70% after the first 15, 30, or  45 patients 
have been followed  for a minimum of 2-years.  Assuming that 70% of the relapsing patients will fail within 5 years,  computer 
simulations indicate that this stopping rule will terminate patient accrual in both the gastric and  non-gastric arms of  the trial with 
a probability of 1% if the relapse  rate is 25% with a 17% probability  if the relapse rate is 50%, and with a probability of 60% if the 
relapse rate is 75%. 
Stopping Rules for patient accrual  upon  failure  to other treatments
When the accrual goals  of both gastric and non-gastric MALT lymphoma patients at  initial presentation  are met, the data for the 
patients who presented upon failure  to other  treatments will be analyzed. Decision  regarding  continued accrual of the patients 
will be made on the RFS outcome  and patient accrual rate at that time.
As toxicity of 3 or higher  is not expected, we do not have a stopping rule based on  toxicity. However, any toxicity of 4 or 5 will be 
immediately investigated (see 12.1)
12.0 Reporting Requirements
12.1 Any life-threatening and/or unexpected and serious (Grade 4 or 5) toxicity  will be  reported immediately to the 
study chair who in turn must notify the Surveillance Committee.

Title: Testing  a medication risk communication and surveillance strategy: The EMC2 Trial
Investigator: Michael  Wolf, PhD, MPH
Supported by: The National  Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)
Introduction: My  name is _______________. I am a research assistant working on behalf of 
_________________ (site) and Northwestern University, inviting you to participate in a research study.
This is  why the research is being done
We are  doing a research study to evaluate different ways to give patients information on medications 
that might have important safety messages. We are also testing different ways to follow up with patients 
to see how they are doing once they have been taking the medicine for a while. 
Here is why  you are being asked to take part in this research study
We are  inviting you to participate because you were recently prescribed one or more of the medicines 
that we are studying. 
If you  say that “Yes, you want to be in this research,” here is what will happen
If you  choose to participate, you will be assigned to one of two groups, based on the clinic you visited 
to get your prescription. If you are in the usual care group, you will receive the current standard of care. 
If you are in the intervention group, you will receive text or phone prompts to call into an automated 
phone system, which will ask questions about how your medicine is working for you. That call will take 
about 5 minutes. If you respond to the system that you are having any issues with your medicine, it will 
send a note to the clinic through your electronic medical record. The clinic staff would then follow up 
with you if they thought it was necessary.
Regardless of  the group you are assigned to, we will ask you to complete up to three phone interviews, 
each lasting 15 to 20 minutes. During these interviews, we will ask you questions about the medicine 
you were just prescribed, your response to treatment, how you understand health information, and some 
general information about you. We would try to schedule the first interview in the next few days, if 
possible. Based on your answers, you may be eligible to complete two more interviews at 1 and 3 
months after the first. . 
This is  what you should know about being in a research study 
Whether  or not you choose to take part is up to you. 
If  you decide not to participate, it will not be held against you or affect your right to any present or 
future medical treatment. You will not be penalized or lose any benefits to which you are entitled. 
If  you do choose to participate, it’s ok to change your mind later. You are free to leave the study at 
any time, for any reason. We will keep all data collected until the time you change your mind.
You  can ask all the questions you want before you decide.
Here is how being  in this research could be bad for you
Your participation  in this study does not involve any physical or emotional risk to you beyond that of 
everyday life. You may skip any questions that make you feel uncomfortable.  
This is  what will happen to the information collected for this research
Efforts will  be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information. We cannot promise 
complete secrecy, but your privacy and the protection of your PHI, or protected health information, is 
very important to us. The PHI for this study includes your name, phone number, address, birth date, the 
name of your clinic and doctor, the name of the medicine you were prescribed and the date it was 
IRB #: STU00201638-CR0003 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 8/14/2018 through 8/13/2019.

prescribed on.  To protect your PHI, we will follow federal and state privacy laws, including the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The following persons or groups may use and/or 
disclose your PHI for this study:
The  Principal Investigator and the research staff 
Boston  Medical Center (BMC): The automated phone system is managed by our research partners 
at BMC. If you are in the intervention group, we would be sending them your name, phone number, 
birth date, the name of your clinic and doctor, the name of the medicine you were prescribed, and 
the date it was prescribed on so that they could set the call up. The data would be encrypted before 
sending; the only people who would see it would be the Northwestern study personnel and the 
programmer at BMC. Your information would be deleted once the automated call was completed. 
The  sponsor, monitors, auditors, the IRB, the Northwestern University Office for Research Integrity, 
the US Office of Research Integrity, the US Office for Human Research Protections, and the US 
Food and Drug Administration may be given direct access to the information you provide as part of 
their work to oversee the research. By consenting, you are authorizing this access. We may publish 
the results of this research, but will keep your name and other identifying information confidential.
After the  study is finished, a dataset that includes your responses but that cannot identify you will be 
kept indefinitely for future analyses.  Only authorized research personnel will have access to these data.  
You may  revoke your authorization at any time by calling the Principal Investigator, Dr. Wolf, or by 
writing to: Dr. Michael Wolf, MPH, PhD, Professor, Division of General Internal Medicine and Geriatrics. 
750 N Lake Shore Drive, 10th Floor, Chicago, IL 60611.

Here is some  other information that is useful for you to know
If you  agree to take part in this research study, you will be paid $40 for completing all study interviews.

Study Design This study is a Phase 1a and 1b, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK, and PD 
of cabiralizumab  as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab in 
patients with selected advanced cancers. Cabiralizumab  is a humanized 
monoclonal antibody directed against CSF1R and nivolumab is a fully human 
monoclonal antibody directed against PD -1. For the combination arms of the 
study (e xcept for the 3 -week dosing regimen cohort -Cohort 1aD ), 
cabiralizumab  and nivolumab will be given on Day 1 of each 14- day treatment 
cycle. For cohort 1aD, cabiralizumab and nivolumab will be administered on 
Day 1 of each 21-day treatment cycle. Nivolumab will be administered as an 
IV infusion over 30 minutes followed by a 30- to 60- minute rest, and then 
cabiralizumab  will be administered as an IV infusion over 30 minutes.  
The study include s Phase 1a and Phase 1b. Patients will be enrolled into either 
Phase 1a or Phase 1b of the study.  
Phase 1a consists of 7 dose escalation cohorts, one  3-week dosing regimen 
cohort . Phase 1a may also include u p to 40 additional patients that will be 
enrolled  for further exploration of safety and PK.  
Phase 1b consists of 7 tumor -specific expansion cohorts across 6 cancer types.

Phase 1a: Dose 
Escalation  In Phase 1a, a modified 3 + 3 + 3 design will be used to assess the safety of cabiralizumab  in monotherapy and  in combination with nivolumab.   
Dose escalation will be based on the number of DLTs experienced during the DLT evaluation interval as determined  by the Investigators and Medical 
Monitor (see Section 3.1.2.1.1
 for DLT criteria). The DLT evaluation interval 
begins on the first day of treatment and continues for 28 days. Patients who receive at least 2 doses of study drug during the 28-day evaluation interval or 
patients who discontinue study treatment for drug-related AEs before receiving 2 doses of study drug will be considered evaluable for DLT determination. In 
consultation with Investigators, the Sponsor has the option to investigate dose 
levels different than those defined in the protocol.  
 Dose escalation in Phase 1a proceed s as follows:  
• If none of the first 3 evaluable  patients in a dose cohort experiences a DLT 
within the DLT evaluation interval, then the next 3 patients will be treated 
at the next higher dose cohort.  
• If 1 of the first 3 evalu able patient s in a cohort experiences a DLT within 
the DLT evaluation interval, then 3 additional patients will be treated in that dose cohort.  
− If no more than 1 of the first 6 evaluable patient s experiences a DLT 
during the DLT evaluation interval, then the next 3 patient s will be 
enrolled at the next higher dose cohort.  
− If 2 of the first 6 evaluable patient s in a cohort experience a DLT, that 
cohort will be expanded to 9 evaluable patients.  
• If 2 of the first 3 evaluable patient s experience a DLT within  the DLT 
evaluation interval, then 6 additional patient s may be treated in that dose 
cohort, upon approval of Investigators and the Medical Monitor.  
• If the incidence of DLT is > 33% in the overall population up to 9 patients , 
that dose level has exceeded the MTD and dose escalation will be 
terminated.

Phase 1a: 3 -Week 
Dosing Regimen  An alternative dosing regimen cohort (1aD) with 10 patients has been added to 
characterize the PK and safety of cabiralizumab in combination with nivolumab when administered at a 3-week dosing schedule. In this cohort, 4 
mg/k g cabiralizumab in combination with 3 mg/kg nivolumab will be 
administered intravenously every three weeks until disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, or other reason for treatment discontinuation. Patients 
who enter this cohort will follow eligibility criteria for Phase 1a. Patients will not be evaluated for DLT as the dose frequency is less than Cohort 1aC3 
which has cleared the DLT window at the time of this amendment.  
Phase 1a: 
Exploration Cohort  Based on emerging clinical and translational data, up to 40 patients will be included in Phase 1aE to further explore safety, PK, and PD at alternative dose 
levels or dosing schedules  which have already successfully cleared their 
respective DLT periods. In  each cohort, cabiralizumab either as monotherapy 
or in combination with nivolumab will be administered until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other reason for treatment 
discontinuation. Patients who enter Phase 1aE will follow eligibility cr iteria for 
Phase 1a.  
Phase 1b: Dose Expansion  
 Seven cohorts consisting of approximately 30 patients each in specific tumor types will characterize the safety and evaluate the efficacy at the RD of cabiralizumab in combination with nivolumab. In each cohort, 4 mg/kg 
cabiralizumab in combination with 3 mg/kg nivolumab will be administered intravenously every 2 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, 
or other reason for treatment discontinuation . 
 Notable Aspects of Study Conduct:  
Study Hist ory 
• Cohort 1aM1 (2 mg/kg cabiralizumab  monotherapy) was enrolled first, 
followed by enrollment  of a cohort of 3 new patients in the 1 mg/kg 
cabiralizumab  and nivolumab combination cohort (1aC1 ).  
• Cohort 1aM2 (6 mg/kg cabiralizumab  monotherapy) was opened after the 
DLT period cleared in the 2 mg/kg cabiralizumab  monotherapy cohort 
(1aM1). 
• Cohort 1aM3 (4 mg/kg cabiralizumab  monotherapy) was opened after DLTs 
were observed in Cohort 1aM2.  
• Cohort 1aM2 (6 mg/kg cabiralizumab monotherapy) was re-opened after the 
DLT period cleared in the 1aM3 (4 mg/kg cabiralizumab monotherapy) 
cohort (See Section 1.4  for the rationale for re -opening Cohort 1aM2)

 Page 9 of 176 Confidential  Study Design  
(cont.)   
Phase 1b: Dose 
Expansion (cont.)  • Cohort 1aC2 ( 2 mg/kg cabiralizumab  and nivolumab combination) was 
opened after the DLT period cleared in the 1 mg/kg cabiralizumab  and 
nivolumab combination cohort and 2 mg/kg cabiralizumab  monotherapy 
cohorts (1aC1 and 1aM1, respectively).  
• Cohort 1aC3 (4 mg/kg cabiralizumab  and nivolumab combination) was 
opened after the DLT period clear ed in the 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg 
cabiralizumab  and nivolumab combination cohorts (1aC1 and 1aC2 
respectively) and in the respective monotherapy cohorts.  
 Study Plan  
• At least 3  patients will be enrolled into each dose escalation cohort .  
• Upon completion of the DLT period, approximately 4 0 additional patients 
may be enrolled  in Phase 1aE to further characterize safety , PK, and PD. 
• Alternative dose levels of cabiralizumab  may be tested based on safety, PK 
and biomarker data.  
• Patients in the combination cohorts can be treated beyond disease 
progression in accordance with protocol specific guidelines  
(see Section 4.3.8 ). 
• Tumor biopsies will be performed in at least 10 patients in each  Phase 1b  
dose expansion cohort (optional for cohort 1b7 GBM) before treatment, at 1 
month post -treatment  
• Skin biopsies will be performed in all Phase 1a patients before treatment, at 1 month post -treatment.  
• Post-disease response and/or progression tumor biopsy and skin biopsy will 
be optional for all patients. 
 
Dosing and Cohorts  For patients in the monotherapy cohorts, cabiralizumab infusion will be 
administered as a 30 -minute IV infusion on Day 1 of each 14-day treatment 
cycle. Patients in combination therapy cohorts will receive nivolumab infusion first at a dose of 3  mg/kg as a 30 -minute IV infusion, with a 30  to 60 -minute 
rest, followed by 30 -minute IV infusion of cabiralizumab , on Day 1 of each 
treatment 14- day cycle. Patients in 3-week  dosing r egimen cohort (1aD) will 
receive the nivolumab and cabiralizumab  infusion  on Day 1 of each 21-day 
treatment cycle.  
If any Grade 3 or higher infusion reaction is observed during the proposed infusion rate of nivolumab 3 mg/kg over 30 minutes, the infusion rate will be extended to 60 minutes for all current and subsequent patients for the duration 
of this study.

3.1 Study Design and Duration  
This study is a Phase 1a and 1b, open- label, multicenter, dose escalation a nd dose expansion 
study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of cabiralizumab  as monotherapy 
and in combination with nivolumab in patients with selected advanced cancers. Cabiralizumab  is 
a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CSF1R, and nivolumab is a fully human 
monoclonal antibody directed against PD-1. For monotherapy arms of the study, cabiralizumab  
will be given on Day 1 of each 14- day treatment cycle. For the combination arms of the study, 
cabiralizumab  and nivolumab will be given on Day 1 of each 14- day treatment cycle  (except for 
the 3-week dosing regimen cohort). Nivolumab will be administered as an IV infusion over 30 minutes followed by a 30 to 60- minute rest, and then cabiralizumab  will be administered as 
an IV infusion over 30 minutes. If any Grade 3 or higher infusion reaction is observed during the proposed infusion rate of nivolumab 3 mg/kg over 30 minutes, the infusion rate will be extended to 60 minutes for all current and subsequent patients for the duration of this study.  
The study will include a Phase 1a dose escalation , Phase 1a 3- week  dosing regimen, Phase 1a  
exploration and a Phase 1b dose expansion. Phase 1a dose escalation consists of 3 cabiralizumab  
monotherapy cohorts (1aM1,1aM2  and 1aM3) and 4 cohorts of cabiralizumab  in combination 
with nivolumab (1aC1, 1aC2, 1aC3 and 1aC4). Phase 1 a 3-week  dosing regimen (1aD) consists 
of 1 cohort which will administer cabiralizumab in combination with nivolumab every three 
weeks instead of every two weeks. The Phase 1a exploration is designed to further evaluate the 
safety, PK, and PD of cabiralizumab as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab. Phase 
1b consists of 7 cohorts (1b1 through 1b7) across 6 cancer types. Patients will be enrolled into 
either Phase 1a or Phase 1b of the study. The study design is shown in Figure 2. 
The study will consist of 3 periods including screening (up to 28 days), treatment, and follow-up.

 Page 66 of 176 Confidential  3.1.1 Screening Period  
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed by the Investigator following the 
procedure noted in the Study Reference Manual for the enrollment process to confirm that patients meet all eligibility criteria before the first infusion of study drug. Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before performing any study specific screening tests or procedures. Screening assessments will be performed within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug unless otherwise specified.  
Study procedure-related AEs that occur after signing of the ICF and before administration of the first study drug dose will be collected during this period. 
3.1.2 Treatment Period  
3.1.2.1 Phase 1a Monotherapy Cohorts and Combination Dose Escalation Cohorts  
Phase 1a consists of three  cabiralizumab  monotherapy cohorts and four dose -escalation cohorts 
of cabiralizumab  in combination with nivolumab with a minimum of 3 patients enrolled in each 
cohort. The planned dose levels and schedules for the Phase 1a cohorts are as follows:  
• Cohort 1aM1: 2 mg/kg cabiralizumab , q2w  
• Cohort 1aM2: 6 mg/kg cabiralizumab , q2w  
• Cohort 1aM3: 4 mg/kg cabiralizumab , q2w  
– (Dose was de-escalated to 4 mg/kg after DLT observed in 1aM2 (See Section 1.9) 
• Cohort 1aC1: 1 mg/kg cabiralizumab  + 3 mg/kg nivolumab, q2w 
• Cohort 1aC2: 2 mg/kg cabiralizumab  + 3 mg/kg nivolumab, q2w 
• Cohort 1aC3: 4 mg/kg cabiralizumab  + 3 mg/kg nivolumab, q2w 
• Cohort 1aC4: 6 mg/kg cabiralizumab  + 3 mg/kg nivolumab, q2w 
The 2 mg/kg cabiralizumab  monotherapy cohort (1aM1) was enrolled first, followed by 
enrollment in the 1 mg/kg cabiralizumab  and nivolumab combination cohort (1aC1). Both 
cohorts cleared without any DLTs. The 2 mg/kg cabiralizumab  and nivolumab combination 
cohort (1aC2) started after the DLT period cleared in the 1 mg/kg cabiralizumab  and nivolumab 
combination cohort and 2 mg/kg cabiralizumab  monotherapy cohort. 
The 6 mg/kg cabiralizumab  monotherapy cohort (1aM2) opened after the D LT period cleared  in 
the 2 mg/kg cabiralizumab  monotherapy cohort (1aM1). There were two DLTs in patients treated 
in the 1aM2 cohort, both due to laboratory abnormalities. Subsequently, the dose was de-
escalated and Cohort 1aM3 (4 mg/kg cabiralizumab  monotherapy) was opened. There were two 
DLTs in the 1aM3 monotherapy cohort and the protocol was subsequently amended to allow higher cutoffs for these laboratory values (see Section 1.8.1 ). Additional patients were added to 
the 1aM3 cohort to evaluate the DLT period under the new criteria.  
FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 67 of 176 Confidential  The 4 mg/kg cabiralizumab  and nivolumab combination cohort (1aC3) was  opened after the 
DLT period clear ed in the 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg cabiralizumab  and nivolumab combination 
cohorts and in the respective cabiralizumab  monotherapy cohorts.  
The 1aM2 cohort was also re- opened with the new DLT criteria . Upon successful completion of 
the DLT period the 6 mg/kg cabiralizumab and nivolumab combination cohort (1aC4) may be 
opened. 
Depending on the outcome of the cohorts described above, alternative dose cohorts may be 
opened. All dose escalation decisions will be based on assessment of DLTs, overall safety, and tolerability. Dose escalation decisions will be agreed upon between the Investigators and Sponsor. Prior to initiating each new dose level or expanding an existing dose level, a safety teleconference will be held wherein the Investigators and Sponsor will review patient data, including but not limited to demographics, dosing, concomitant medications, hematology, serum chemistry, and AEs; and confer and document agreement that dose escalation or expanding an existing dose level is considered appropriate. If the Investigators and Sponsor collectively agree, following review of safety, PK, and PD data (if available), that a different dose escalation scheme (e.g., an alternative dose of cabiralizumab  monotherapy or in combination with 
nivolumab) should be used than the one outlined, this will be permitted. Review of safety, PK, and PD profiles may inform decisions to add cohorts with alternative dose levels or dose regimens (e.g., less frequent dosing) in order to reach an optimal target exposure. 
Dose escalation will be based on the number of DLTs experienced during the DLT evaluation 
interval as determined by the Medical Monitor and Investigators (see Section 3.1.2.1.1 for DLT criteria). The DLT evaluation interval begins on the first day of treatment and continues for 28 days. Patients  that receive at least 2 doses of study drug during the 28-day evaluation interval or 
patients who discontinue study treatment for drug- related AEs before rece iving 2 doses of study 
drug will be considered evaluable for DLT determination. In consultation with Investigators, the Sponsor has the option to investigate alternative dose levels to those defined in the protocol.  
Dose escalation in Phase  1a will proceed as follows: 
• If none of the first 3 evaluable patients in a dose cohort experiences a DLT within the DLT evaluation interval, then the next 3 patients will be treated at the next higher dose 
cohort.  
• If 1 of the first 3 evaluable patients in a cohort experiences a DLT within the DLT evaluation interval, then 3 additional patient s will be treated in that dose cohort.  
– If no more than 1 of the first 6 evaluable  patients experiences a DLT during the DLT 
evaluation interval, then the next 3 patient s will be enrolled at the next higher dose 
cohort.  
− If 2 of the first 6 evaluable patients  in a cohort experience a DLT, that cohort will be 
expanded to 9 evaluable patients .  
FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 69 of 176 Confidential  If the MTD is not reached during the Phase 1a combination dose escalation, or subsequent cycles 
of treatment in cleared Phase 1a combination cohorts provide additional insight on the safety profil e, an RD may be selected based on overall tolerability, safety, PK, and PD (if available).  
Sponsor has the option to expand any cohort previously established to be safe in order to obtain additional data  or to investigate alternative dose levels to those d efined in the protocol.  Upon 
completion of the DLT period, up to 40 additional patients may be enrolled in Phase 1aE  to fully  
characterize safety , PK, and PD. 
If a patient in Phase 1a monotherapy does not receive 2 doses of study drug and does not complete safety assessments and if a patient in one of the Phase 1a combination cohorts does not receive 2  doses of each study drug and does not complete the safety as sessment (e.g., safety lab 
and/or AE reporting) in the DLT period for reasons other than drug- related AEs (e.g., disease 
progression or withdrawal of consent), then an additional patient will be enrolled into the cohort so that the cohort has at least 3  patients evaluable for the DLT period. All such discussions and 
decisions will be documented as part of the dose escalation decision -making process.  
Upon completion of the DLT period, Phase 1a patients may participate in an Extended Treatment Period following the guidelines in Section 3.1.2.2 .  
3.1.2.1.1 Dose Limiting Toxicity  
A DLT is defined as a study drug- related ≥  Grade 3 AE (using National Cancer Institute [NCI] 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] v 4.03) occuring during the first 28-days, excluding: Grade 3 tumor flare (defined as local pain, irritation, or rash localized at sites 
of known or suspected tumor), Grade 3 rash, Grade 3 immune- related adverse event (irAE) that 
resolved to a Grade 1 or less within 14 days, or a transient (resolving within 6 hours of onset) Grade 3 infusion- related AE. Any recurrence of Grade 3 rash, Grade 3 immune- related AE, or 
Grade 3 infusion- related AE will be considered a DLT. An irAE is defined as a clinically 
significant AE that is associated with study drug exposure, of unknown etiology, and is consistent with an immune -mediated mechanism.  
In the absence of cl inical symptoms and other accompanying changes in bilirubin or ALT (as 
noted in appendices F, G, and H), serum elevations of AST /ALT  > 12 xULN and ≤ 20 xULN 
that last for < 7 days will not be considered a DLT and serum elevations of CK and/or LDH >  15 xULN and ≤  20 xULN that last for < 7 days will not be considered a DLT.  
Upon the first occurrence of a delayed DLT in any patient enrolled in Phase 1a (defined as any DLT  that occurs between 4 to 6 weeks after administration of study drug), all ongoing and 
subsequent DLT periods will be expanded to 42 days for all remaining and subsequent patients enrolled in Phase 1a dose escalation. If no patient experiences a delayed DLT, the DLT window will remain at 28 days for all patients.  
FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 70 of 176 Confidential  3.1.2.2 Phase 1a Extended Treatment Period  
Upon completion of the DLT period, patients from the Phase 1a monotherapy and combination 
cohorts may participate in an Extended Treatment Peri od.  
Patients from the Phase 1a monotherapy cohorts are allowed to continue to receive cabiralizumab  monotherapy at the same cabiralizumab  dose level and patients from the Phase 1a 
combination cohorts are allowed to continue to receive cabiralizumab  in com bination with 
nivolumab at the same dose levels until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other reason for treatment discontinuation. 
3.1.2.3 Phase 1a 3- week  Dosing Regimen Cohort  
In protocol amendment 4, a 3- week  dose regimen  cohort (1aD) is added to characterize the PK 
profile and safety of cabiralizumab in combination with nivolumab when administered a s an 
alternative dosing schedule. This Phase 1a 3- week  Dosing Regimen consists of one cohort 
evaluating 4 mg/kg cabiralizumab  in combination with 3 mg/kg nivolumab, administered 
intravenously every three  weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other reason 
for treatment discontinuation.  
3.1.2.4 Phase 1a Exploration Cohorts 
The Phase 1a exploration consists of up to 40 additional patients to  further evaluate the safety, 
PK, and PD of cabiralizumab as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab.  
3.1.2.5 Phase 1b Expansion Cohorts  
To further characterize safety and efficacy of cabiralizumab  in combination with nivolumab, 
Phase 1b will enroll up to 7 expansion cohorts in 6 advanced cancer types  (1b1 through 1b7). 
Enrollment in Phase 1b will begin when an RD has been identified based on overall safety, 
tolerability, PK, and PD (if available) data.  
During enrollment of any expansion cohort, if the observed number of responses makes it unlikely to achieve a target response rate for that indication, then further recruitment to that cohort may be suspended or terminated. 
After initiation of Phase 1b, the dose may be changed based on data from continued dose 
exploration in Phase 1a. There will be no intra-patient dose modification and any alteration in 
dose for Phase 1b will only apply to newly enrolled patients in Phase 1b. 
3.1.3 End-of-Treatment Follow- up Period 
All patients should return to the clinic 28 (±7) days and 100 (±7) days from their last dose of 
study drug to complete the End-of- Treatment Follow -up Period, irrespective of whether a patient 
is discontinued from the study drug at a planned visit or mid -cycle. AEs will be assessed until 
resolution , return to baseline , or are stabilized per treating Investigator ’s assessment. Adverse 
FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 71 of 176 Confidential  event reporting will continue until 100 (±7) days after the last dose of study drug or until 
initiation of subsequent anti- cancer therapy . 
3.1.4 Long -Term Follow -up 
Patients should continue onto Long- Term Follow -up after completing the End -of-Treatment 
Follow-up Period. 
Patients will be followed every 12 weeks for survival, or more frequently as needed. Patients 
who discontinue treatment while showing clinical benefit (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], or stable disease [SD]) should have tumor assessments during these visits for duration of response.  
Long- term Follow -up for survival may be conducted by telephone, rather than by an in-person 
visit, once tumor progression is determined or use of subsequent anti -cancer therapy has been 
initiated . During the Long- Term Follow -up Period, if the patient undergoes local therapy (e.g., 
resection, radiation) or new systemic  therapy is initiated, this should be documented. 
3.1.5 Study Duration  
Patients who receive study drug(s) may continue as long as they experience clinical benefit in the 
opinion of the Investigator or until unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression as determined by the Investigator after an integrated assessment of radiographic data, biopsy results (if available), and clinical status, or withdrawal of consent.  
3.1.6 Stopping Rules  
3.1.6.1 Stopping Rules for All Cohorts  
Management of drug- related toxicities will follow the adverse event management tables 
(Appendix F  and Appendix G ). Management of drug- related laboratory abnormalities will follow 
the management tables in Appendix H . 
The Sponsor will discuss such cases with the study Investigators as appropriate to determine further enrollment. IRBs may be notified by the Investigators of all cases and decisions regarding continued enrollment, according to applicable regulatory requirements or institution procedures.  
3.1.6.2 Stopping Rules for Clinical Deterioration  
Accumulating clinical evidence indicates that the emergence of objective responses to agents that activate anti -tumor immune responses may follow delayed kinetics of weeks or months, and can 
be preceded by initial apparent progression of disease with the appearance of new lesions or some enlarging of lesions while certain index lesions are regressing (“mixed response”). Therefore, it is reasonable to allow patients  who experience apparent progression to continue to 
receive treatment until progression is con firmed at the next imaging assessment. These 
FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 72 of 176 Confidential  considerations should be balanced by clinical judgment as to whether the patient is clinically 
deteriorating and unlikely to receive any benefit from continued treatment. 
Such deterioration will be assessed to have occurred after a clinical event that, in the 
Investigator’s opinion, is attributable to disease progression and is unlikely to reverse with continued study treatment and therefore indicates that the patient  is not benefiting from study 
treatment and ca nnot be managed by the addition of supportive care. The decision to continue 
treatment should be discussed with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or designee. Examples of events that may, in the Investigator’s opinion, indicate a lack of clinical benefit inclu de but are 
not limited to the following: 
• Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score increase of at least 2 points from baseline (e.g. from 0 to 2). 
• Habitual changes such as changes in activities and symptoms including reduction in appetite and/or sleep, altered awareness, and increased pain -related symptoms due to 
cancer.  
• Progression of disease confirmed by the treating Investigator. 
• Any setting where the initiation of new anti- neoplastic therapy has been deemed 
beneficial to the patient even in the absence of any such documented clinical events.  
3.2 Study Population  
3.2.1 Planned Number of Patients and Study Centers  
The total number of patients planned for this study is estimated to be 295 in North America. By the end of the study, approximately 85 patients in P art 1a (approximately 20 in monotherapy

3.4 Disc
ontinuation of Patie nts following any Treatment with Study Drug  
Patients must  discontinue study drugs for any of the following reasons: 
• Withdrawal of informed consent (patient ’s decision to withdraw for any reason) 
• Any clinical ly significant AE, abnormal laboratory test resu lts, or intercurrent illness 
which, in the opinion of the Investigator, indicates that continued participation in the 
study is not in the best interest of the patient  
• Patients who are required to have prohibited concomitant medications 

FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 83 of 176 Confidential  • Pregnancy 
• Terminatio n of the study by the Sponsor 
• Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntary 
incarceration for treatment of a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious disease) illness  
• Documented disease progression or clinical deterioration  while receiving active study 
therapy 
• Non-compliance by the patient 
All patients who discontinue study treatment should comply with protocol specified follow-up procedures as outlined in Section 5.2.4. The only exception to this requirement is when a patient withdraws consent for all study procedures or loses the ability to consent freely (i.e., is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment of a psychiatric or physical illness).  
If a patient was discontinued, the reason for discontinuation must be entered on the appropriate CRF.  The date and reason for cessation of cabiralizumab  and/or nivolumab will be documented, 
and the Investiga tor must make every effort to perform the End -of-Treatment Visits. Adverse 
event reporting will continue until 100 (±7) days after the last dose of study drug or until initiation  of subsequent anti- cancer therapy . Patients with ongoing SAEs will be followe d until 
resolution or stabilization.  
3.5 Long -Term Follow -up  
Patients who discontinue treatment while still receiving clinical benefit (i.e., CR, PR or SD) 
should get follow -up tumor scans every 12 (± 2) weeks until disease progression or  use of 
subsequent anti- cancer therapy  to determine the duration of response, unless consent is 
withdrawn.  
Long- Term Follow -up for survival may be conducted by telephone, rather than by an in-person 
visit, once tumor progression is determined or use of subsequent anti -cancer therapy has been 
initiated . 
FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 84 of 176 Confidential  4. Study Drugs  
In this study, both study drugs, cabiralizumab  and nivolumab, are considered Investigational 
Medicinal Products (IMP).  
4.1 Investigational Products  
An investigational product, also known as investigational medicinal product in some regions, is 
defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical study, including products already having  a marketing authorization but 
used or assembled (formulated or packaged) differently than the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form. In this protocol, the investigational products are cabiralizumab  and nivolumab. 
4.2 Handling and Dispensing  
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that investigational product is only dispensed to Patients. The investigational product must be dispensed only from official study sites by authorized personnel according to local regulations. 
The applicable site personnel should ensure that the study drugs are stored in accordance with 
the environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity) determined by the Sponsor. If concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the study drugs arise, do not dispense the study drugs and contact the Sponsor or designee immediately.  
Study drug documenta tion including all processes required to ensure drug is accurately 
administered must be maintained. This includes documentation of drug storage and administration and, as applicable, storage temperatures, reconstitution, and use of required processes (e.g.  required diluents, administration sets).  
4.2.1 Cabiralizumab   
The investigational supply of cabiralizumab  will be provided to the study centers by the Sponsor 
(or designee) and will be administered to patients in the clinical study by a trained healthcare professional.  
Cabiralizumab drug product is supplied for IV administration as a sterile, aqueous, colorless to 
pale yellow liquid, clear to slightly opalescent pyrogen -free solution in 5 mL glass vials 
stoppered with coated stoppers, and equipped with aluminum seals. Light (few) particulates (consistent in appearance to proteinaceous particles) may be present. Each vial contains a minimum of 5  mL of a 20  mg/mL solution of cabiralizumab (approximately 100 mg per vial).  
Storage Conditions: 2–8°C (36–46°F). The vials will be provided in a carton. Both vials and cartons will be labeled per local regulations.  Refer to the pharmacy manual for more specific 
information on the drug product . 
FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 86 of 176 Confidential  treatment cohort. If any Grade 3 or higher infusion reaction is observed during the proposed 
infusion rate of nivolumab 3 mg/kg over 30 minutes, the infusion rate will be extended to 60 minutes for all current and subsequent patients for the duration of this study.  
There will be no dose escalations or reductions of nivolumab allowed. Patients may be dosed no 
less than 12  days from the previous dose. There are no premedications recommended for 
nivolumab on the first cycle. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for nivolumab preparation instructions.  
4.3.1.2 Cabiralizumab  Dosing  
For patients in the combination therapy cohorts, the cabiralizumab  infusion will be administered 
30 minutes IV infusion, after the end of the nivolumab infusion and a 30- to 60- minute rest , on 
Day 1 of each 14 or 21day treatment cycle  depending on treatment cohort. For patients in the 
monotherapy cohorts, the cabiralizumab  infusion can be initiated at any time as a 30 -minute IV 
infusion on Day 1 of each 14- day treatment cycle.  
Cabiralizumab  dosing may be modified based on toxicities noted during the treatment period. If 
necessary, the dose will be adjusted  
) and Sections 4.3.2, 4.3.4, 4.3.5, and 4.3.10. 
A research pharmacist (or other responsible personnel) will prepare th e solution for 
administration. After calculating the number of vials, based on the patient’s weight, the study 
drug product will be diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Prepared cabiralizumab  
should be administered within 6 hours after preparation (ambient temperature). The IV administration setup for cabiralizumab  infusion must contain a 0.2 or 0.22 µm in- line filter or a 
0.2 or 0.22 µm syringe filter. Cabiralizumab  will be administered under medical supervision as a 
30 minute (± 5 minutes) IV infusion via a peripheral vein or central venous catheter. No incompatibilities between cabiralizumab  infusion and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), 
ethylene/propylene IV components, or glass bottles have been observed. 
4.3.2 Dose Delay for Cabiralizumab and Nivolumab  
Administration of cabiralizumab  and/or nivolumab in combination therapy should be delayed for 
the following: 
• Any Grade 3 fatigue which does not resolve to Grade 1 or baseline before the next 
treatment visit  
• Any drug-related laboratory abnormalities would not require a dose delay unless clinically indicated or specified in the protocol or abnormal laboratory  management table  
(Appendix H ). Please discuss with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or designee as needed.  
  
 

FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 87 of 176 Confidential  Patients who require a dose delay of cabiralizumab  or cabiralizumab  /nivolumab should be re-
evaluated weekly or more frequently if clinically indicated and resume study drug dosing when 
re-treatment criteria are met.  
If a patient experiences an infusion reaction to cabiralizumab , or nivolumab, or both study drugs, 
the infusion reaction should be treated following the infusion reaction treatment guidelines  
 
If the causality of the AE requiring a dose delay is confirmed to be due to one of the study drugs 
of the combination therapy, the non-offending drug may be continued per protocol taking into account the safety and clinical benefit to the patient.  
4.3.3 Criteria to Resume Treatment with Cabiralizumab  and Nivolumab 
Patients may resume treatment with cabiralizumab  and/or nivolumab when the drug- related AE 
resolves  
The Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or designee can be 
contacted  at any time  if further clarification is  needed. 
4.3.4 Dose Reduction with Cabiralizumab and Nivolumab 
Dose reduction for cabiralizumab  and nivolumab are not permitted .  
4.3.5 Dose Discontinuation Criteria for Cabiralizumab  and Nivolumab 
Discontinuation rules may be different for monotherapy and combination therapy and not all 
rules will apply to both arms of the  study.  
 
Treatment of cabiralizumab  in monotherapy or cabi ralizumab  in combination with nivolumab 
should be discontinued in the following cases unless otherwise specified: 
• Any Grade 3 or higher uveitis or  any Grade 2 drug-related uveitis, eye pain, or blurred 
vision that does not respond to topical therapy and does not improve to Grade 1 within the second re -treatment period or that requires systemic treatment  
• Any Grade 3 or higher infusion- related reactions and hypersensitivity requiring 
discontinuation. Any re- initiation of therapy in this circumstance would require 
consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or designee. 
• Any Grade 3 non- skin, drug-related AE lasting >7 days, including drug- related uveitis, 
pneumonitis, hypoxia, bronchospasm, and endocrinopathies with the following excep tions:

 Page 88 of 176 Confidential  discontinuation except: 
 Grade 3 drug -related thrombocytopenia >7 days or associated with Grade ≥2 
bleeding requires discontinuation  
• Any drug- related liver function test (LFT) abnormality that meets any one of the 
following criteria requires discontinuation:  
– ALT or AST >3x ULN and total b ilirubin >2x ULN  or INR > 1.5 xULN (in the 
absence of anticoagulation) . 
  
– ALT or AST >  20x ULN (with or without concurrent liver metastases)  
– Total bilirubin >3x ULN (>5x ULN with concurrent liver metastases) 
• Any Grade 4 drug- related AE or laboratory abnormality, except for the following events 
which do not require discontinuation: 
– Grade 4 neutropenia <7 days 
– Grade 4 lymphopenia or leukopenia <7 days 
– Isolated Grade 4 amylase or lipase abnormalities that are not associated with 
symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis. The Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or designee should be consulted for Grade 4 amylase or lipase abnormalities. 
– Isolated Grade 4 electrolyte imbalances/abnormalities that are not associated with 
clinical sequelae and are corrected with supplementation/appropriate management 
within 72 hours of their onset 
– Grade 4 drug- related endocrinopathy AEs, such as adrenal insufficiency, 
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency, hyper- or hypothyroidism, or glucose intolerance, whi ch resolve or are adequately controlled with physiologic 
hormone replacement (corticosteroids, thyroid hormones) or glucose-controlling agents, respectively, may not require discontinuation after discussion with and approval from the Sponsor’s Medical Moni tor or designee.  
– Grade 4 CK up to 20 xULN (in the absence of clinical sequelae)  
• Any event that leads to delay in dosing lasting > 6 weeks from the previous dose requires 
discontinuation, with the following exceptions: 
– Dosing delays to manage drug- related adverse events are allowed. Prior to re-
initiating treatment in a patient with a dosing delay lasting >  6 weeks from the 
previous dose, the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or designee must be consulted. Tumor assessments should continue as per -protocol even if d osing is delayed. Periodic study 
visits to assess safety and laboratory studies should also continue per protocol, or more frequently if clinically indicated during such dosing delays or per the Investigator’s discretion.  

FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 89 of 176 Confidential  – Dosing delays lasting > 6 weeks fr om the previous dose that occur for non-drug-
related reasons may be allowed if approved by the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or 
designee. Prior to re- initiating treatment in a patient with a dosing delay lasting >  6 
weeks, the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor must be consulted. Tumor assessments should continue per protocol every 8 weeks (±7 days) even if dosing is delayed. Periodic study visits to assess safety and laboratory studies should also continue per-protocol or more frequently if clinically indicated during such dosing delays or per the Investigator’s discretion.  
• Any AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the opinion of the Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the patient with continued cabiralizumab  and/or nivolumab dosing 
• Any drug- related  Grade 3 or higher neurological toxicity  
• Any Grade 3 or higher periorbital edema and persistent Grade 2 periorbital edema requiring 2 missed doses unless approved by Sponsor’s Medical Monitor 
• Any Grade 3 or higher drug- related diarrhe a or colitis, which does not resolve to Grade 1 
or baseline within 28 days. 
• Any Grade 4 skin toxicity 
• Any Grade 4 renal toxicity 
• Any drug- related Grade 3 or higher pulmonary toxicity 
If the causality of the adverse event requiring discontinuation is confirmed to be due to one of the study drugs in the combination therapy, the other drug may be continued per protocol schedule under the following scenarios: 
• Timely resolution of the adverse event based on the treatment modification table  
• Clinical benefit is shown by the patient based on Investigator assessment  
4.3.6 Infusion Delays and Missed Doses with Cabiralizumab  and Nivolumab 
In case an infusion cannot be administered at a scheduled visit, it must be administered as soon 
as possible. If the delay is between 1 and 7 days, the procedures at the original scheduled visit should be performed. If the delay is more than 7 days, the infusion at the original scheduled visit will be considered a missed dose and the procedures at the next visit should be performed. If the delay is longer than 7 days, subsequent visits will follow a 2- week (or 3- week in Phase 1a 3-
week  dosing regimen cohort ) dosing interval. If the delay is less than 7  days, the original dosing 
schedule should be follo wed. The time between two treatment cycles should be no less than 12 
days. 
Patients may miss up to up to 6 weeks between doses and may resume the study drug if the event 
returns to baseline or ≤  Grade  1 within 6 weeks of treatment interruption. Omission of additional 
dosing longer than 6 weeks for AEs will necessitate the patient’s discontinuation from the study unless allowed by the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or designee. Patients may miss doses in the 
FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 90 of 176 Confidential  course of participation in the study, including missed doses for scheduled vacations or other 
personal reasons as needed, but not more than 6 weeks unless approved by the Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor or designee.  
4.3.7 Intra -Patient Dose Escalation with Cabiralizumab  and Nivolumab 
Intra -patient dose escalation is not allowed for nivolumab or cabiralizumab . 
4.3.8 Treatment beyond Disease Progression with Cabiralizumab  and Nivolumab 
Accumulating evidence indicates a minority of patients treated with immunotherapy may derive clinical benefit despite initial evidence of progressive disease  
Patients treated with cabiralizumab  and nivolumab combination therapy will be permitted to 
continue cabiralizumab  and nivolumab treatment beyond initial RECIST v1.1 defined 
progressive di sease, assessed by the Investigator, as long as the following criteria are met:  
• Patients who will be treated beyond disease progression must review and sign an ICF before continuing on study drug 
• The patient demonstrates investigator- assessed clinical bene fit, and do not have rapid 
disease progression  
• Tolerance of study drugs 
• Stable performance status  
• Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent serious complications of disease progression (e.g., CNS metastases)  
A radiogra phic assessment/scan should be performed approximately 8  weeks (±7 days) after 
initial Investigator- assessed progression to determine whether there has been a decrease in the 
tumor size or continued progressive disease. The assessment of clinical benefit should be balanced by clinical judgment as to whether the patient is clinically deteriorating and unlikely to receive any benefit from continued treatment with cabiralizumab  and nivolumab. 
If the Investigator feels that any patient receiving cabiralizumab  and nivolumab will obtain 
clinical benefit by continuing treatment, the patient may remain on the trial and continue to receive monitoring according to the time and event schedules per protocol. 
For the patients who continue cabiralizumab  and nivolumab study therapy beyond progression, 
further progression is defined as an additional 10% increase in tumor burden from time of initial 
progression. This includes an increase in the sum of diameters of all target lesions and/or the diameters of new measurable lesi ons compared to the time of initial progression. cabiralizumab  
and nivolumab treatment should be discontinued permanently upon documentation of further progression. 

FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 91 of 176 Confidential  4.3.9 Dose Modification Algorithms for Immuno -Oncology Agents 
Immuno -oncology agents are associat ed with AEs that can differ in severity and duration 
compared to AEs caused by other therapeutic classes. Cabiralizumab  and nivolumab are 
considered immuno-oncology agents in this protocol. Early recognition and management of AEs 
associated with immuno -oncology agents may mitigate severe toxicity. Management algorithms 
have been developed to assist Investigators in assessing and managing the following classes of AEs:  
• Gastrointestinal  
• Renal  
• Pulmonary 
• Hepatic  
• Endocrinopathy 
• Skin 
• Neurological 
• Infusion reaction  
• Periorbital edema  
• Uveitis  
• Laboratory abnormalities  
 
  
4.3.10 Treatment of Cabiralizumab and Nivolumab- Related Infusion Reactions 
Cabiralizumab  and nivolumab may induce infusion or hypersensitivity reactions. If such a 
reaction were to occur, it may manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruritus, arthralgia, hypo- or hypertensi on, bronchospasm, or other symptoms.  
Infusion reactions should be graded according to CTCAE v4.03 guidelines. Any Grade 3 or Grade  4 infusion reaction should be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor 
or designee, and reported as an SAE i f it meets the criteria.  
The nivolumab 30- minute infusion will be administered first, with a 30 - to 60- minute rest, 
followed by the cabiralizumab  30-minute infusion. It may be unclear if an infusion reaction is 
due to cabiralizumab , nivolumab, or to both study drugs. Therefore, one set of treatment 
recommendations (based on the most conservative treatments for infusion reactions due to either study drug) is provided below and may be modified based on clinical judgment, local treatment standards and guideli nes, and/or specific symptoms, as appropriate:  

FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 92 of 176 Confidential  For Grade 1 symptoms : Mild reaction (e.g., localized cutaneous reactions including mild 
pruritus, flushing, rash), requires infusion rate to be decreased; intervention may be indicated. 
• Decrease the rate of th e study drug infusion until recovery from symptoms. 
• Remain at bedside and monitor the patient’s vital signs until resolution of symptoms. 
Diphenhydramine 50 mg may be administered at the discretion of the treating physician. 
• When symptoms resolve, restart the infusion at the original infusion rate.  
• If a patient has an infusion reaction with nivolumab, cabiralizumab  can be given (without 
prophylactic medications) if the infusion reaction resolves within 3 hours. For scheduling purposes, cabiralizumab  infusio n may be given the next day. Prophylactic pre- infusion 
medications should be given prior to all subsequent nivolumab infusions. 
• If a patient has an infusion reaction with cabiralizumab , prophylactic pre-infusion 
medications should be given prior to all subsequent cabiralizumab  and nivolumab 
infusions. 
• The following prophylactic pre- infusion medications are recommended prior to future 
infusions of cabiralizumab  and nivolumab: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) 
and/or paracetamol (acetaminophen) 325 to 1000 mg at least 30 minutes before additional study drug administrations. 
For Grade 2 symptoms : Moderate reaction (i.e., any symptom not listed above [mild 
symptoms] or below [severe symptoms] such as generalized pruritus, flushing, rash, dyspnea, hypotension with systolic blood pressure >80 mmHg), requires infusion interruption but responds promptly to symptomatic treatment (e.g., antihistamines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, IV fluids); prophylactic pre -infusion medication s 
indicated for ≤24 hours.  
• Interrupt the study drug infusion. 
• Begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the patient with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol (acetaminophen) 325 to 1000 mg. 
• Remain at bedside and monitor the pa tient’s vital signs until resolution of symptoms. 
Corticosteroid therapy may be administered at the discretion of the treating physician.  
• When symptoms resolve, restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of the original infusion rate.  
• Monitor the patient closely. If symptoms recur, immediately discontinue the infusion; no further study drug will be administered at that visit. Administer diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, and remain at bedside and monitor the patient until resolution of symptoms.  
• If a patient has an infusion reaction with nivolumab infusion, cabiralizumab  infusion can 
be given (without prophylactic medications) if the infusion reac tion resolves within 3 
hours. For scheduling purposes, the cabiralizumab  infusion may be given the next day. 
FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 93 of 176 Confidential  Prophylactic pre-infusion medications should be given prior to all subsequent nivolumab 
infusions. 
• If a patient has an infusion reaction with cabir alizumab , prophylactic pre-infusion 
medications should be given prior to all subsequent cabiralizumab  and nivolumab 
infusions. 
• The following prophylactic pre- infusion medications are recommended prior to future 
infusions of cabiralizumab  and nivolumab: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) 
and/or paracetamol (acetaminophen) 325 to 1000 mg should be administered at least 30 minutes before additional study drug administrations. If necessary, corticosteroids (up to 25 mg of SoluCortef or equivalent) may be used. 
• The amount of study drug infused must be recorded.  
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms : Severe reaction such as bronchospasm, generalized 
urticaria, systolic blood pressure <80 mmHg, or angioedema; Grade 3 symptoms including prolonged symptoms, which requi re 6 or more hours to respond to symptomatic medication 
and/or discontinuation of infusion; recurrence of symptoms following initial improvement; hospitalization indicated for other clinical sequelae, such as renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates; Grade 4: life -threatening; pressor or ventilation support indicated. 
• Immediately discontinue the study drug infusion. No further study drug will be administered. The amount of study drug infused must be recorded on the CRF. 
• Begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the patient as follows: Recommend bronchodilators, epinephrine 0.2 to 1.0 mg of a 1:1,000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. 
• Remain at bedside and monitor the patient ’s vital signs until recovery from symptoms.  
• The patient should be monitored until the Investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur.  
• Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis.  
In the case of late -occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (e.g., appearance of a localized or 
generalized pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic trea tment may be given (e.g., 
oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids).  
4.4 Method of Assigning Patient Identification  
Patients must be able to provide written informed consent and meet all eligibility criteria. No waivers of inclusion or exclusion criteria will b e granted by Sponsor or its designee for any 
patient enrolled in the study. Before enrolling a patient , all eligibility criteria must be satisfied.  
Patients who qualify for Phase 1a dose e sclation of the study will be enrolled as follows: 
FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 94 of 176 Confidential  • The 2 mg/kg cabi ralizumab  monotherapy cohort was enrolled first, followed by 
enrollment to the 1mg/kg cabiralizumab  /nivolumab combination cohort. Patients in these 
cohorts will be treated for a total of two 14 -day treatment cycles within the DLT period. 
• Enrollment into the 4 mg/kg cabiralizumab  monotherapy cohort will proceed once the 
DLT period is cleared in preceding monotherapy cohorts .  
• Dose escalation into increasing dose levels of cabiralizumab  in combination with 
nivolumab may proceed until DLTs are observed either in the cabiralizumab  
monotherapy or the cabiralizumab  in combination with nivolumab cohorts after 
discussion and agreement by the Cohort Review Committee. 
In 3- week  dosing r egimen  Cohort ( 1aD), approximately 10 patients will be enrolled into the 4 
mg/kg c abiralizumab  in combination with nivolumab  cohort. These patients will receive study 
treatment every three weeks.  
The Phase 1a exploration consists of six  cohorts of approximately 10 patients each. These 
cohorts are further evaluating the safety, PK, and PD of cabiralizumab as monotherapy and in 
combination with nivolumab. 
In Phase 1b, approximately 30 patients will be enrolled per cohort. Enrollment will be open for 
all cohorts in parallel and will continue until the enrollment target is reached. Once a cohort is filled, further enrollment will be restricted to the cohort(s) that have not been filled. A total of approximately 210 patients will be enrolled in the Phase 1b arm of the study. 
The Investigator may repeat qualifying lab tests and vitals/ECGs prior to enrollment if a non -
qualifying finding is considered an error or an acute finding is likely to meet eligibility criteria 
upon repeat testing.  
4.5 Blindin g/Unblinding  
This is an open -label study and there will be no blinding or unblinding of patients during this 
study. 
4.6 Treatment Compliance  
Study drug will be administered by qualified trained site personnel in the clinical facility. The 
Investigator or their designated study personnel will maintain a log (Drug Accountability Log) of all study drugs received dispensed and destroyed. The Investigator and the study personnel will ensure that each patient receives the calculated dose of the study drug based on body weight. 
Drug supplies will be inventoried and accounted for throughout the study. The Drug 
Accountability Log will be reviewed by the study monitor during site visits and at the completion of the study. Any discrepancy should be brought to the attention of the Sponsor. Records of study medication administration (date, start and stop time, and dose administered relative to time of preparation) will be recorded on the patient ’s CRF.  
FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 95 of 176 Confidential  4.7 Destruction of Study Drug  
Any unused study drugs can only be destroyed on site after being inspected and reconciled by the 
responsible site monitor unless study drug vials must be immediately destroyed as required for safety, or to meet local regulations (e.g., cytotoxics or biologics). 
• On-site destruction is allowed provided the following minimal standards are met:  
• On-site disposal practices must not expose humans to risks from the drug. 
• On-site disposal practices and procedures are in agreement with applicable laws and 
regulations, including any special requirements for controlled or hazardous substances. 
• Written procedures for on -site disposal are available and followed. The procedures must 
be filed with the si te’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and a copy provided to the 
Sponsor upon request. 
• Records are maintained that allow for traceability of each vial, including the date disposed of, quantity disposed, and identification of the person disposing of the containers. The method of disposal (i.e., incinerator, licensed sanitary landfill, or licensed waste disposal vendor) must also be documented. 
• Accountability and disposal records are complete, up- to-date, and available for the Study 
Monitor to review throughout the clinical trial period.  
If conditions for destruction cannot be met, the responsible Study Monitor will make arrangements for return of study drug ( Section  4.8). 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to arrange for disposal of all empty containers, provided that procedures for proper disposal have been established according to applicable federal, state, local, and institutional guidelines and procedures and provided that appropriate records of disposal are kept. 
4.8 Return of Study Drug  
If study drug will not be destroyed on site upon completion or termination of the study, all 
unused and/or partially used study drug that was supplied must be returned. The return of study drug will be arranged by the responsible Study Monitor.

FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 118 of 176 Confidential  5.2.4 Long -Term Follow -up for All Patients  
Patients should continue onto Long- Term Follow -up after completing the End -of-Treatment 
Follow-up Period. 
Patients will be followed every 12 (±2) weeks for survival, or more frequently as needed. 
Patients who discontinue treatment while showing clinical benefit (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], or stable disease [SD]) should have tumor assessments during these visits for duration of response.  
Long- Term Follow -up for survival may be conducted by telephone, rather than by an in-person 
visit, once tumor progression is determined or use of subsequent anti -cancer therapy has been 
initiated.  
During the Long- Term Follow -up Period, if the patient undergoes local therapy (e.g., resection, 
radiation) or new systemic therapy is initiated , this should be documented. Patients should be 
followed until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or study termination by the 
Sponsor.  
5.3 Study Assessments  
5.3.1 Safety Assessments  
At baseline, a medical history will be obtained to capture relevant underlying conditions. The 
baseline examinations should include weight, height, ECOG Performance Status ( Appendix I ), 
ECG, blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry at rest (also monitor amount of supplemental oxygen, if applicable) within 28 days prior to first dose.  
Safety assessments including serum hematology, chemistry, ECOG, weight and other 
assessments including ECG (if clini cally indicated) will be done as part of standard care during 
each visit prior to dosing as noted in Appendix A , Appendix B , and Appendix C . Serum 
chemistry labs will be checked at screening and any abnormalities outside of the normal range will be followed closely with evaluation of symptoms and follow -up laboratory data. Patients 
will also be monitored for any infusion -related AEs during dosing and followed up accordingly 
based on protocol guidelines. Pre- medications including steroids, antihistamines or other 
treatments will be given prior to future dosing if a patient develops infusion reactions per protocol guidelines.  
Any patient who ha s received study drug will be evaluated for safety. Toxicity assessments will 
be continuous during the treatment phase and End-of- Treatment Follow -up Period clinic visits. 
Once patients reach the Long -Term Follow -up Period (and tumor progression has been 
determined or use of subsequent anti -cancer therapy has been initiated), documented telephone 
calls or email correspondence to assess the patient’s status are acceptable.  
AEs and laboratory values will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v 4.03. 
FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 119 of 176 Confidential  Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry at rest (also the amount of supplemental oxygen, if 
applicable) should be assessed at each on -study visit prior to dosing. If a patient shows changes 
on pulse oximetry or other pulmonary-related signs (hypoxia, fever) or symptoms (e.g. dyspnea, 
cough, fever) consistent with possible pulmonary AEs, the patient should be immediately evaluated to rule out pulmonary toxicity, according to the suspected pulmonary toxicity management table in Appendix G . 
Physical examinations are to be performed as clinically indicated. If there are any new or worsening clinically significant changes since the last exam, report changes on the appropria te 
non-serious AE or SAE page. 
Additional measures, including non-study required laboratory tests, should be performed as 
clinically indicated or to comply with local regulations. Laboratory toxicities (e.g., suspected drug-induced liver enzyme evaluations ) will be monitored during the follow -up phase via 
on-site/local labs until all study drug- related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed 
stable.  
Additional testing or assessments may be performed as clinically necessary or as required by institutional or local regulations.  
5.3.2 Efficacy Assessments  
5.3.2.1 Primary Efficacy Parameters  
The primary efficacy parameter is the objective response rate (ORR; number of patients with confirmed response of CR or PR, divided by the total number of patients who are evaluable for a response). Tumor response status will be assessed using RECIST v1.1 by investigator review .  
An Independent Radiology Facility will also  be established to evaluate imaging data of trial 
subjects in a central and independent fashion. Board- certified radiologists will determine 
radiographic response and/or progression following enrollment in according to RECIST v1.1 and/or RANO for Cohort 1b7. R esponse assesssments by independent review will be a secondary 
endpoint.  
5.3.2.1.1 Tumor Assessment  
Tumor assessments will be performed at Screening (within 28 days prior to first dose), then 
every 8 weeks (± 7 days) from the first dose, for the first 12 months, and then every 12 weeks (±7 days) thereafter. All patients should have tumor response parameters assessed at the End -of-
Treatment visit unless a tumor assessment has been performed within 8 weeks prior to an End -
of-Treatment Visit or if tumor progression was  previously determined. Patients who enter Long-
Term Follow -up while showing clinical benefit should have tumor assessments every 12 weeks 
(±7 days) for duration of response. The same measuring modality should be preferably used by 
the site to maintain con sistency across the study. 
FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 120 of 176 Confidential  Response will be evaluated using RECIST v1.1 for measurable disease. Clinical lesions will only 
be considered measurable when they are superficial and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers. For the case of skin lesions, docu mentation by color photography including a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion is suggested. As previously noted, when lesions can be evaluated both by clinical exam and imaging, imaging evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and m ay also be reviewed at the end of the study. These assessments will follow the 
same schedule as the radiological assessments.  
5.3.2.2 Additional Efficacy Parameters  
Additional efficacy parameters may include the following: Overall Survival (OS, 1 -year OS, and 
median OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and duration of response (DOR) for those patients with confirmed responses, based on RECIST v 1.1.  
CT or MRI will be performed at screening, during treatment, and at the End -of-Treatment Visit 
per protocol. Measurements of change in tumor burden must be reviewed and documented after 
each measurement.  
5.3.2.3 Tumor Biopsy  or Fresh Tumor Tissue Collection  
Biopsy at the primary tumor site or metastatic site will be collected at screening (at least 24 hours prior to dosing) and also on- treatment (prior to Cycle 3, Day 1, within 7 days prior to 
Cycle 3 Day 1 and at least 24 hours prior to dosing) for all Phase 1a patients and 10 pat ients per 
cohort in Phase  1b (optional for patients in the GBM  cohort). Patients may  also have on-
treatment biopsy upon documented tumor response and post-treatment biopsy upon documented tumor progression. The post-response and post-progression biopsies will be optional for patients in Phase 1a and Phase 1b ( Appendix E ). If available, tumor tissue obtained from post- treatment 
procedures such as surgery may also be collected.  
Biopsied lesions may become inflamed, bleed, or change dimensions, which could result in inaccurate tumor measurements. Therefore, it is recommended not to use the biopsied lesion as a target lesion when assessing the response by RECIST v  1.1 criteria. 
5.3.2.4 Skin Biopsy Tissue Collection  
Skin Biopsy will be collected at screening (at least 24 hours prior to dosing) and on-treatment 
(prior to Cycle 3, Day 1, within 7 days prior to Cycle 3 Day 1 and at least 24 hours prior to dosing) for all Phase 1a patients . Patient s may  also have on -treatment skin biopsy upon 
documented tumor response and post- treatment skin biopsy upon documented tumor 
progression. The post- response and post -progression skin biopsies will be optional for patients in 
Phase 1a ( Appendix E ). It is recommended to biopsy in an area of skin that is devoid of disease 
(e.g. inflam mation, rash, urticaria) .

 Page 121 of 176 Confidential  5.3.3 Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood samples for the PK evaluation of both cabiralizumab  and nivolumab will be collected 
from all patients.  
Patients enrolled in Phase 1a and Phase 1b will have blood drawn for measurement of serum 
cabiralizumab  concentration. Blood samples will be collected during Cycle 1 and Cycle 8 on 
Days 1, 2, 4, and 8 as well as both before and after infusion for Cycle 2 , 3 and 4. In addition, 
blood samples will be collected before the infusion on Cycles 5, 9, 13, and 21, then every 6 cycles while on treatment . A blood sample will also be collected for PK analysis during the End-
of-Treatment Follow -up Period (28 [ ±7] days and  100 [ ±7] days post- last dose).  
Patients enrolled in the 3-week  dosing r egimen cohort (1aD) will have additional blood sample 
drawn on Day 1 5 of Cycles 1 and 8. See Appendix C  for specific collection time points.  
Patients enrolled in Phase 1a and Phase 1b combination cohorts will have blood drawn for measurement of serum nivoluma b concentration. Blood samples will be collected both before 
and at the end of infusion for Cycle 1 to C ycle 4 . In addition, blood samples will be collected at 
the end of the infusion for Cycle 8 and before the infusion on Cycles 5, 9, 13, and 21. A blood sample will also be collected during the End-of- Treatment Follow -up Period. 
Standard PK parameters will be determined based on serum cabiralizumab  concentration -time 
data, as appropriate. Nivolumab accumulation will be evaluated as appropriate. 
5.3.3.1 Pharm acokinetic Collection and processing  
Blood samples will be collected and processed for serum according to the instructions provided 
in a Laboratory Manual. 
5.3.3.2 Pharmacokinetic Sample Analysis  
Cabiralizumab  concentration in serum will be determined in serum us ing a validated ELISA 
method. Nivolumab concentration in serum will be determined in serum using a validated  ECLA 
method. 
5.3.4 Immunogenicity Assessments  
Blood samples will be collected before the infusion on Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 13, and 21, and at 
the 28 ( ±7) days and 100 ( ±7) days End-of-Treatment Visits to measure ADA for cabiralizumab  
and nivolumab. ADA for cabiralizumab  in serum will be measured by a validated bridging 
ECLA that utilizes Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) technology. ADA for nivolumab in serum will be measured by a validated ECLA method.  
5.3.5 Biomarker Assessments 
A variety of factors that could potentially predict clinical response to the combination of cabiralizumab  and nivolumab will be investigated in peripheral blood and in tumor specimens

5.3.5.4 Flow
 Cytometry  
Pre-treatment and on- treatment whole blood and PBMC samples will b e analyzed by flow 
cytometry to study the effects of cabiralizumab  and nivolumab on various peripheral blood 
immune cell subsets. Whole blood samples will be assessed to confirm the predicted PD effect of 
cabiralizumab  on the reduction of CD16+ monocytes. PBMC samples will be analyzed to 
determine whether blockade of PD -1 combined with CSF1R targeting will impact peripheral T-
cell levels and activation status.  
 Timi ng of sample collection is 
listed in Appendix C  and analyses to be performed are described in Appendix D . 
  
 
 
 

FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 124 of 176 Confidential  6. Adverse Events 
An Adverse Event  (AE)  is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation, patient -administered study drug and that 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefor e be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. 
The causal relationship to study drug is determined by an investigator and should be used to 
assess all AEs. The causal relationship can be one of the following:  
• Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and the AE.  
• Not related: There is not a reasonable causal r elationship between study drug 
administration and the AE.  
The term “reasonable causal relationship” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship.  
AEs can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open-ended questioning, examination, or 
evaluation of a patient. (In order to prevent reporting bias, patients should not be questioned 
regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)  
6.1 Collection of Adverse Events  
Any new symptoms, injury or worsening of symptoms that occur following signing of the informed consent form (ICF) but prior to first infusion (Cycle 1 Day 1) will be considered pretreatment events and reported on the Medical History page of the electronic case report form (eCRF), unless they directly correlate to a study -related proc edure. Adverse event reporting will 
continue until 100 (±7) days after the last dose of study drug or until initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy .  
6.2 Serious Adverse Events 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death. Death may occur as a result of the underlying disease process. All events other than progression of underlying disease that result in death during the reporting period up to 100 (±7) days after the last dose of cabiralizumab  (or unt il 
initiation of subsequent anti- cancer therapy) must be treated as an SAE and reported  as 
such. 
• Is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the 
time of the event)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization (see 
NOTE below)  
FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 125 of 176 Confidential  • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical 
and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention  [e.g., 
medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasia s or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization.) Potential drug -induced liver injury (DILI) is also 
considered an important medical event. (See Section 6.7 for the definition of potential DILIs.)  
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (e.g., pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study drug is an SAE.  
Although pregnancy and potential DILI are not always serious by regulatory definition, these 
events must be handled as SAEs. (See Section  6.2.1 for reporting pregnancies). 
Note : The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs in this clinical study:  
• Visit to the emergency room or other hospital department <24 hours, that does not result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)  
• Elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent 
• Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure 
• Routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health s tatus 
(e.g., outine colonoscopy)  
• Medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into the study. A ppropriate documentation is required in these cases.  
• Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason).  
• Admission for administration of anti -cancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs  
• Hospitalization for an event solely related to disease progression or for an elective or planned procedure to treat a pre- existing condition  
• Admission to hospice or care facility to support activities of daily living  
FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 126 of 176 Confidential  6.2.1 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
The Investigator should report any SAE that occurs after the first study drug dose and until 
100 (±7) days after the last dose of study drug or until initiation of subsequent anti -cancer 
therapy. Protocol-specified procedure related SAE will be collected following signing of ICF.   
An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness.  
If the Investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to 
the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy or a complication of a study procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form. 
• SAEs, related or unrelated to study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report Form, and pregnancies must be recorded on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form (paper forms). SAE and pregnancy data reporting must be done on the paper SAE/Pregnancy Surveillance Forms provided by the Sponsor (or designee). T hey 
are to be transmitted via email or fax    
  
  
  
If only 
limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. 
Note : Follow -up SAE reports should include the same Investigator term(s) initially reported.  
If an ongoing SAE changes in intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to the Sponsor (or 
designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.  
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
6.3 Non-Serious Adverse Events  
A non- serious adverse event  is any AE not classified as serious.  
6.3.1 Non-serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Non-serious AEs should also  be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if 
they become serious (see Section 6.2.1). Follow- up is also required for non -serious AEs that 
cause interruption or discontinuation of study drug and for those present at the end-of-study 
treatment, as appropriate. All identified non -serious AEs must be recorded and described on the 
appropriate AE page of the CRF.  

FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 127 of 176 Confidential  Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities 
that are reported during the course of the study. 
6.4 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities  
The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be captured on the appropriate CRF 
page or SAE Report Form as appropriate: 
• Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE  
• Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the pati ent to have study drug 
discontinued or interrupted 
• Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the patient to receive specific corrective therapy.  
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by the reporting Investigator (e.g., anemia versus low hemoglobin value). 
6.5 Pregnancy  
If, following initiation of the investigational product, it is discovered that a study patient  is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of investigational product exposure, including 
during at least 5 half- lives (90 days) after product administration, the investigational product will 
be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner. 
The Investigator must immediately notify the Sponsor’s (or designee’s) Medical Monitor of this 
event and complete and forward a Pregnancy Form to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours and in accordance with SAE reporting procedures described in Section  6.2.1. 
Follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome and, where applicable, offspring information, must be reported on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.  
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant should be reported to 
the Sponsor. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.  
6.6 Overdose  
Any dose of study drug in excess of 50% of the dose level specified in the protocol i s considered 
to be an overdose. Signs and symptoms of an overdose that meet any SAE criterion must be reported as an SAE in the appropriate time frame and documented as clinical sequelae to an overdose. There is no known antidote for a drug overdose to eit her cabiralizumab  or nivolumab. 
In the event of an overdose, patients should be closely monitored and given appropriate supportive treatment. 
FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 128 of 176 Confidential  6.7 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury  
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver- related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential drug- induced liver injury (DILI) event. All occurrences 
of potential DILIs, meeting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs.  
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as:  
1. ALT or AST elevation >3x ULN 
 and  
2. Total bilirubin >2x ULN without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase) or INR > 1.5 xULN (in the absence of anticoagulation) 
 and  
3. No other immediately apparent possible causes of aminotransferase elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia including but not limited to viral hepatitis, pre -existing chronic or acute 
liver disease, or the administration of other drugs known to be hepatotoxic.

The number and percentage of patients with marked laboratory changes will be tabulated by cohort and overall. 
7.4.4 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Individual and mean serum concentration of cabiralizumab  and nivolumab versus time data will 
be plotted by dose level. Summary statistics will be tabul ated for the serum concentration -time 
data and estimated PK parameters of cabiralizumab , as appropriate.  
For cabiralizumab , PK parameters including C
max, AUC, C min, CL, and V ss will be estimated. 
Other PK parameters as well as inter -patient variability, c abiralizumab  accumulation, and dose 
proportionality will be evaluated when data are available. Nivolumab accumulation will be 
evaluated as appropriate. PK data ( cabiralizumab  and/or nivolumab) collected from this study 
may be used in combination with other studies for exposure-response or population PK modeling, which will be part of a separate report.  
7.4.5 Immunogenicity  
A listing will be provided of all available immunogenicity data for both cabiralizumab  and

9.1 Good Clinical Practice  
The procedures set out in this study protocol are designed to ensure that the Sponsor and 
Investigator abide by GCP guidelines of the ICH and the  The 
study also will be carried out in compliance with local legal requirements.  
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol. The protocol and any amendments and the Informed Consent Form (ICF) will receive Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) approval/favorable opinion prior to initiation of the study.  
All potential serious breaches must be reported to the Sponsor immediately. A serious breach is a 
breach of t he conditions and principles of GCP in connection with the study or the protocol, 
which is likely to affect, to a significant degree, the safety or physical or mental integrity of the patients of the study or the scientific value of the study.  
Personnel in volved in conducting this study will be qualified by education, training, and 
experience to perform their respective tasks.  
This study will not use the services of study personnel where sanctions have been invoked or where there has been scientific miscond uct or fraud (e.g., loss of medical licensure, debarment). 
9.2 Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
Before study initiation, the Investigator must have written and dated approval/favorable opinion from the IRB/IEC for the protocol, ICF, patient recruitment materials (e.g., advertisements), and any other written information to be provided to patients. The Investigator or Sponsor should also provide the IRB/IEC with a copy of the IB or product labeling information to be provided to patients an d any updates.  
The Investigator should provide the IRB/IEC with reports, updates and other information (e.g., expedited safety reports, amendments, and administrative letters) according to regulatory requirements or institution procedures. 
9.3 Informed Consen t 
All information about the clinical study, including patient information and the ICF, is prepared 
and used for the protection of the human rights of the patient according to ICH GCP guidelines and the  
The ICF, prepared by the Investigator with the assistance of the Sponsor, must be approved along with the study protocol by the IEC/IRB and be acceptable to the Sponsor. Before each patient is enrolled on the study, written informed consent will be obtained according to the regulatory and legal requirements. A copy of the signed ICF will be retained by the patient and the original will be filed in the Investigator’s site file, unless otherwise agreed. The Investigator 

FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 138 of 176 Confidential  will not undertake any investigation specifically required only for the clinical study until valid 
consent has been obtained. The terms of the consent and when it was obtained must be documented in the source documents and in the CRF.  
If a protocol amendment is required, the ICF may need to be revised to reflect the changes to the 
protocol. If the ICF is revised, it must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate IRB/IEC, 
and signed by all patients subsequently enrolled in the study as well as those currently enrolled in the study. 
All signed and dated ICFs must remain in each patient’s study file and must be available for 
verification by study monitors at any time.  
The rights, safety, and well- being of the patients are the most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.  
FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 139 of 176 Confidential  10. Study Management 
10.1 Compliance  
10.1.1 Compliance with the Protocol and Protocol Revisions  
The study shall be conducted as described in this approved protocol. All revisions to the protocol 
must be discussed with, and be prepared by, the Sponsor. The Investigator should not implement any deviation or change to the protocol without prior review and documented approval/favorable opinion from the IRB/IEC of an amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to Patients.  
If a deviat ion or change to a protocol is implemented to eliminate an immediate hazard prior to 
obtaining IRB/IEC approval/favorable opinion, as soon as possible the deviation or change will be submitted to: 
• IRB/IEC for review and approval/favorable opinion 
• Sponsor 
• Regulatory Authorities, if required by local regulations  
Documentation of approval signed by the chairperson or designee of the IRB(s)/IEC(s) must be sent to the Sponsor. 
If an amendment substantially alters the study design or increases the potential risk to the patient: 
(1) the consent form must be revised and submitted to the IRB(s)/IEC(s) for review and approval/favorable opinion; (2) the revised form must be used to obtain consent from patients currently enrolled in the study if they are affected by the amendment; and (3) the new form must be used to obtain consent from new patients prior to enrollment.  
If the revision is an administrative letter, investigators must inform their IRB(s)/IEC(s).  
10.1.2 Monitoring  
During the study, a monitor will pe rform routine site visits to review protocol compliance, 
compare CRFs and individual patients’ medical records, assess drug accountability, and ensure that the study is being conducted according to pertinent regulatory requirements. CRF entries will be verified with source documentation. The review of medical records will be performed in a manner to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained.  
Representatives of the Sponsor will review data centrally to identify potential issues to determine a schedu le of on -site visits for targeted review of study records.  
All participating centers should take particular care in ensuring that original imaging source data (images, echo images, etc.) are maintained and accessible for monitoring, and that these original source data are then archived on a long- term basis in compliance with ICH GCP 
FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 140 of 176 Confidential  (Section  10.2.1) . These images must be stored in a secure location until the Sponsor (or 
designee) authorizes their destruction, and must be retrievable by study patient number in the 
event of an audit.  
10.1.2.1 Source Documentation  
All data obtained during this study should be entered into the CRFs promptly. All source documents from which CRF entries are derived should be placed in the patient’s medical 
records. CRF fields for which source documents will typically be needed include laboratory assessments, physical exam reports, nursing notes, ECG recordings, hospital records, and CT or MRI  reports.  
The CRFs for each patient will be checked against source documents at the study site by the Site Monitor.  
Instances of missing or uninterpretable data will be discussed with the Investigator for resolution.  
10.1.3 Investigational Site Training  
The Spo nsor or designee will provide quality investigational staff training prior to study 
initiation. Training topics will include but are not limited to: GCP, AE reporting, study details 
and procedure, CRFs, study documentation, informed consent, and enrollment of WOCBP.  
10.2 Records 
10.2.1 Records Retention  
The study site will maintain a study file, which should contain, at minimum, the Investigator’s Brochure, the protocol and any amendments, the protocol for tissue sampling, drug accountability records, correspondence wi th the IEC/IRB and the Sponsor (or designee), and 
other study- related documents.  
The Investigator agrees to keep records and those documents that include but are not limited to the identification of all participating patients, medical records, study -specif ic source documents, 
source worksheets, all original signed and dated ICFs, copies of all eCRFs, query responses, and detailed records of drug disposition to enable evaluations or audits from regulatory authorities and FivePrime or its designees.  
The Inve stigator shall retain records required to be maintained for a period of 5  years following 
the date a marketing application in an ICH region is approved for the drug for the indication for 
which it is being investigated or, if no application is to be filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until at least 5 years after the investigation is discontinued. However, these documents should be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulations or if needed by the Sponsor. In addition, the Investigator must make provision for the patients’ medical records to be kept for the same period of time.  
FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 141 of 176 Confidential  No data should be destroyed without the agreement of FivePrime. Should the Investigator wish 
to assign the study records to anothe r party or move them to another location, FivePrime must be 
notified in writing of the new responsible person and/or the new location.  
Patients’ medical records and other original data will be archived in accordance with the 
archiving regulations or facil ities of the investigational site.  
10.2.2 Study Drug Records  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that a current disposition record of each study drug (supplied by FivePrime) is maintained at each study site where study drugs are inventoried and dispensed. Records or logs must comply with applicable regulations and guidelines and should include: 
• Amount received and placed in storage area 
• Amount currently in storage area 
• Label identification number or batch number 
• Amount dispensed to and returned by each patient, including unique patient identifiers 
• Non-study disposition (e.g., lost, wasted) 
• Amount destroyed at study site, if applicable  
• Amount returned to designated parties 
• Dates and initials of person responsible for Investigational Product 
dispensing/accountability as per the Delegation of Authority Form. 
The Sponsor will provide forms to facilitate inventory control if the investigational site does not have an established system that meets these requirements.  
10.2.2.1 Case Re port Forms  
An Investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each individual treated or entered as a control in the investigation. D ata that are derived from source documents and 
reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. 
For sites using the electronic data capture tool, eCRFs will be prepared for all data collection 
fields except for fields specific to SAEs and pregnancy, which will be reported on the paperSAE form and Pregnancy Surveillance form, respectively. Spaces may be left blank only in those circumstances permitted by study -specific CRF completion guidelines provided by the Sponsor. 
The confidentiality of records that could identify patients must be protected, respecting the privacy and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s). 
FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017 
 Page 142 of 176 Confidential  The Investigator will maintain a signature sheet to document signatures and initials of all persons 
authorized to make entries and/or corrections on CRFs. 
The completed CRF, including any paper SAE/pregnancy report forms , must be promptly 
reviewed, signed, and dated by the Investigator or qualified physician who is a subinvestigator 
and who is delegated this task on the Delegation of Authority Form. For eCRFs, review and approval/signature is completed electronically using the Sponsor’s electronic data capture tool.  
The Investigator must retain a copy of the CRFs including records of the changes and 
corrections. Each individual electronically signing eCRFs must meet the Sponsor’s training requirements and must only access the Sponsor’s electronic data capture tool using the unique user account provided by the Sponsor. User accounts are not to be shared or reassigned to other individuals.

 Page 149 of 176 Confidential  Notes for  Phase 1a Schedule  of Assessments  
a. Unless specified,  prior to infusion procedures are to be completed  within  72 hours  of scheduled  time point and to be synchronized with administration of assigned study drug.  Any clinical  
assessment, laboratory  study,  or additional  non-specified  tests may be obtained  at any time,  if clinically  indicated.  
b. Each cycle will be 14 days long, with administration of cabiralizumab ± nivolumab on Day 1. In Cohort 1aD, each cycle will be 3 weeks long, with administration of cabiralizumab and nivolumab 
on Day 1. The first day of treatment in Cycle 1 is defined as Day  1; a ± 2 day window is allowed for Day 1 in subsequent cycles.  
c. Day 15 Assessments (Physical Examination, Vital Signs and Clinical Safety Lab) will apply to patients in Cohort 1aD only  
d. Standard physical examination will be performed as determined by the Investigator, particularly to follow physical findings to resolution. Targeted physical exams should be conducted at any time 
to follow up on AE reports.  
e. Height is only required to be recorded at screening. Weight is required to be recorded at Day 1 of each cycle. Dose will be adjusted only if weight change is >10% from first dose on Cycle 1 Day 1.  
f. Vital signs include pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and temperature in the resting  position (sitting or supine) . Measure prior to dose and after completion of each IV infusion at the following 
time points: 10  (±5) minutes, 30 (±10) minutes, and 60 (±15) minutes, 168 hours (±24 hours) [Cycle 1 only] post cabiralizumab  administration; 10 (±5) minutes post nivolumab administration. 
Pulse oximetry is performed at rest prior to dosing for the combination cohorts only.  
g. Patient ECOG Status assessments are to be performed within 72 hours prior to dosing (Day 1 of each cycle).  
h. Screening labs include serology for Hepatitis B (HBsAg), Hepatitis C (HCV antibody), and test for latent TB  (e.g. T-SPOT, Quantiferon ).  
i. Clinical Safety Labs : 
Hematology including CBC with differential,  platelets,  hemoglobin,  hematocrit,  RBC,  and RBC indices  
Chemistry  includes CK (creatine  kinase), AST (aspartate transaminase), ALT  (alanine transaminase), alkaline phosphatase, bicarbonate, bilirubin,  (direct  and total),  BUN  (blood urea nitrogen), 
calcium,  chloride, creatinine, glucose, LDH (lactate dehydrogenase),  phosphorus,  potassium, sodium,  and, if applicable,  serum  pregnancy.  Albumin, amylase, lipase, thyroid panel includes TSH, 
Free T3 and Free T4, PT/INR, and PTT (aPTT) perform at Screening and as indicated. If CK elevation is clinical ly significan t, obtain troponins (cardiac and skeletal),  CK isoenzymes,  aldolase,  
and ECG;  repeat  CK and these additional  tests within 48 hours  or other  interval  as clinically  indicated,  until resolved  or stable.  If either  AST or ALT is elevated,  obtain  total serum  bilirubin,  
alkaline phosphatase;  repeat  within 48 hours  or other interval, as clinically  indicated, until resolved or stable.  Additional tests may be obtained at  any time,  if clinically  indicated. If a patient is 
being followed for a tumor marker (e.g. CA-125, or others), a sample for the tumor marker should be obtained at screening and every other cycle, or if clinically indicated during the study 
Urinalysis: Urine dipstick  will  only be done at screening,  and w hen clinically  indicated.  
j. Obtain  ECG  records  at Screening and the Day 28 post last infusion End- of-Treatment Visit (after  PK blood draw,  record  exact time).  Additional ECGs should be obtained  at any time,  if serum CK  
or cardiac troponin is elevated;  if abnormal  (excluding  sinus  tachycardia), ECGs should be obtained  (if clinically  indicated),  until the abnormality  is resolved or clinically  stable. Additional  ECGs 
may be obtained at  any time,  if clinically indicated. ECGs for each patient should be  obtained from  the same machine whenever  possible. To  minimize variability,  it is important  that patients  be in a 
resting  position for at least  5 minutes prior to each  ECG  evaluation. Body position should be consistently maintained  for each ECG  evaluation to  prevent  changes  in heart  rate. Environmental  
distractions  (e.g., television, radio,  conversation)  should be avoided during the pre-ECG  resting period and during ECG  recording.  
k. CT or MRI of the Tumor sites measured as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). If patient  terminates prior to scheduled CT  or MRI scans,  patient should have scans  
done  at End- of-Treatment  Visits (does not need to be repeated if performed within 8 weeks prio r to End- of-Treatment Visits or if tumor progression was previously determined). Patients who enter 
Long- Term Follow -up while showing clinical benefit should have tumor assessments  q12w for duration of response. The same measuring modality should be used by the site to maintain 
consistency across the various time points. (Documentation of skin lesions by color photography, including a ruler to measure  the size of the lesion, is sugg ested and should follow the CT  or MRI 
schedule.)  Brain scans will be required only if CNS metastasis is suspected, based on Investigator clinical judgment (except for patient s in cohort 1b7).  
l. Performed every 8 weeks (±7 days) from the first dose for the fi rst 12 months for patients who remain on treatment (and every 12 weeks (±7 days) thereafter) and  28 days  (± 7 days)  after the last 
dose of study treatment.  CT or MRI scans  do not need to be repeated if performed  within  8 weeks  prior to the End -of-Treatment  Visits or if tumor  progression was previously determined. 
m. All women of childbearing potential will have a serum pregnancy test at screening, Cycle 1 Day 1 and every 8 weeks during treatment, and at the End -of-Treatment Visits.  
n. Biopsy at primary tumor or metastatic tumor site and skin biopsy from a site devoid of disease (e.g. rash or urticaira) will be collected at screening [at least 24 hours prior to dosing] and prior to 
Cycle 3 Day 1 [within 7 days prior to Cycle 3 Day 1 and a t least 24 hours prior to dosing]. It is recommended that patients who have documented response receive another biopsy within 28 (± 14) 
days post tumor assessment and/or patient who have progression receive another biopsy at the final End -of–Treatment visit . The post -response and post -progression biopsies are optional. If 
available, collect an FFPE tissue block or 10 slides of archival tumor sample at Screening.  
o. Samples will be collected for PK, PD, and ADA analyses. Not all visits will require collection of all three – see  Appendix C  for collection schedule.  
p. Blood will be collected to evaluate Cmax and/or Cmin on Day 1 of study drugs on Cycles 1, 2, 3,  4, 5, 8, 9, 13, 21, then every 6 cycles while on treatment and End- of-Treatment Follow up Period. 
Cycles 1 and 8 will have additional samples on days 2, 4, and 8 (and day 15 for patients in Cohort 1aD) . 
q. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) samples will be collect ed prior to dose at Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 13, 21, then every 6 cycles while on treatment and at End -of-Treatment Visits. Additional ANA reflex 
samples may be collected upon requested or as clinically indicated. Testing by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) will be performed as clinically indicated. If the titer is positive, erythrocyte 
FPA008 -003 Clinical Protocol  Version 5 – Amendment 4  7 June 2017  
 Page 150 of 176 Confidential  sedimentation rate (ESR) and C -reactive protein (CRP) will be tested to confirm the result.  
r. Cabiralizumab  and nivolumab will both be administered by IV infusion over 30 minutes (± 5 minutes) . If any Grade 3 or higher infusion reaction is observed during the proposed infusion rate of 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg over 30 minutes, the infusion rate will be extended to 60 minutes for all current and subsequent patients for the duration of this study. Nivolumab will be given first, with a 30 - 
to 60- minute rest, followed by cabiralizumab  as a 30 -minute infusion.  
s. Cabiralizumab  ± nivolumab will be administered every 2 weeks in 14 -day cycles. Patients in Cohort 1a D, cabiralizumab  and nivolumab will be administered every 3 weeks . The dosing may 
continue until PD or unacceptable toxicity.  
t. These assessments are to be performed prior to each dose (with the exceptions noted in Appendix C ) for those patients who continue treatment without signs of progressive disease or toxicity.  
u. Patients should be contacted every 12 (±2) weeks for survival status. Patients should have tumor scans every 12 (±2) weeks, if tumor progression was not previously determined and/or use of 
subsequent  anti-cancer therapy has not been initiated. Any new anti -cancer therapy should be documented.

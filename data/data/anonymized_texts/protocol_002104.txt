 4. Background/Rationale  
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is among the most common medical diagnosis 
among Veterans. 1,2 Approximately half of those who carry a diagnosis of COPD are prescribed 
inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) despite having no role among those patients without fixed airflow 
obstruction (AFO) and a limited role among those who do.3  Guidelines explicitly state that ICS 
should be limited to patients with frequent exacerbations  despite long -acting bronchodilators .4  Even 
this benefit comes at a cost, as ICS use has been shown in multiple randomized control trials to 
increase rates of pneumonia.5-7 After prolonged exposure, ICS is also associated with higher fracture 
risk,8 cataracts9,10 and poor diabetes control.11 Among patients without disease  or with low risk of 
exacerbation, ICS have no demonstrated efficacy, but retain the risk of harm.  For this reason, 
evidence -based guidelines specifically recommend against their use.4 We propose to improve the 
delivery and safety of care by de -implementing the ineffective use of ICS among Veterans with a 
diagnosis of COPD who otherwise lack a clinical indication for the medication.   Framed in the 
context of the de -implementation QUERI, we will compare a substitution approach using a 
proactive patient -tailored electronic consult (E -consult) to usual care. Primary care providers 
assigned to either treatment arm will also receive  a single -session academic detailing intervention, 
which represents a non -intensive unlearning approach.  
In collaboration with patient aligned care teams (PACT), we propose to challenge the current referral -
dependent provision of specialty care by having pulmonologists assume responsibility for 
supporting a population of patients with COPD. Understanding how to deploy specialists to improve 
access, timeliness, and quality of care, using a PACT -Veteran -centric approach, is a high priority for 
VA and the Office of Specialty Care Services, just as decreasing ineffective medication use is a high 
priority for the Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Services.  Using a parallel cluster randomized 
trial design grounded in the Chronic Care Model and evaluated using the RE -AIM framework,12-15 we 
propose to test an intervention that retools concepts of specialty care access and existing clinical 
infrastructure to align with VA operational goals to improve safety and value for Veterans with 
COPD.  
 
5. Specific Aims   
 
Primary Aim:  
Among patients with  a clinical diagnosis of COPD who have had spirometry and are receiving 
inappropriate inhaled corticosteroids:  
1. Evaluate a multi -faceted intervention that seeks to decrease inappropriate use of ICS. The 
intervention uses a proactive E -consult approach to l everage the VA’s integrated healthcare and 
informatics system to facilitate specialist support of primary care teams to de -implement ICS 
among patients with no clinical indication for the medication. Our primary outcome  is the 
percentage of patients that r emain off inhaled corticosteroids at six months  (index date + 180 
days) .

Secondary Aims:   
1. Assess whether the intervention is associated with:  
▪ Unchanged rates of  COPD exacerbation at 6 months  [defined as (index date + 1 day) to (index 
date + 180 days) ] 
▪ Decreased rate of pneumonia at 6 months  [defined as (index date + 1 day) to (index date + 180 
days) ] 
▪ Decreased mortality at 6 months . [defined as (index date + 1 day) to  (index date + 180 days) ] 
▪ Acceptance of substituted recommendation s (Intervention group only) . 
▪ Number of patients for whom recommendations were made.  
▪ Number of patients recommended to stop inhaled corticosteroids.  
▪ Proportion of recommendations accepted by primary care provider s within 6 months  
(index date + 180 days) . 
▪ Percentage of patients where recommendations to stop inhaled corticosteroids are accepted but 
restarted by 6 months  [defined as (index date + 1 day) to (index date + 180 days) ] 
2. Assess the effect of the interventio n on primary care provider (PCP) burnout, professional efficacy, 
and perceptions of evidence for the use of ICS.  
3. Assess acceptability of the intervention to PCPs and Veterans.  
4. Assess implementation costs of the intervention.  
 
6. Setting  
 
The study will be conducted within primary care clinics located at the  VA Puget Sound Health Care 
System (Seattle, WA) and the Edith Nourse Memorial VA Medical Center (Bedford, MA). Sites of 
primary care include clinics located at both academic medical centers  and their associated 
community -based outpatient clinics (CBOCs).  
 
7. Design  
We will utilize a parallel cluster randomized trial design , with initial randomization occurring at the 
level of the primary care patient -aligned care team (PACT) team.  Following stu dy start, the unit of 
randomization will be the PCP, as described in Section 8.3.  Data will be collected at the individual 
patient level.

8.2. Recruitment  and Consent  
Primary Care Providers :

 Intervention : This project was designated as a quality improvement (QI) initiative by the VA Office of 
Specialty Care Services . We will attempt to reach all PCPs at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System 
and Edith Nourse Memorial VA Medical Center. PCPs will not be provided an opportunity to opt -out 
of this QI initiative, though they can choose to participate or not in the survey and  qualitative 
portions of the study.   
▪ Prior to study start, we will query CDW to create a list of all primary care PACT teams and 
eligible providers, this list will be updated on a regular basis  to identify PCPs that have left as 
well as newly eligible PCPs .  
▪ All eligible PCPs will be included in the intervention study.  
Quantitative Surveys : We will invite  all eligible PCPs to participate in baseline and follow -up surveys 
that will provide information regarding their perception of inhaled corticosteroid use,  efficacy and 
adverse effects.  
▪ Approximately 1 week prior to survey recruitment start, the primary care directors at each site 
will send an introductory email to all eligible PCPs that includes an explanation of the project 
and purpose of the anticipated survey.  
▪ PCPS will be recruited via email invitation 1 -2 months prior to their planned entry into the 
trial (baseline survey) , again at 12 months , and at study end  (follow -up survey s). The email 
invitation will include a unique link to the online survey.  
▪ Following the initial emailed invitation, we will mail out up to 4 additional reminder emails at 
1-week intervals. The final reminder email will be accompanied by a personalized message by 
one o r more o f the study investigators.  
▪ PCPs who do  not respond after the final reminder email will be assumed to not want to 
participate in that survey.  
▪ PCPs who do not respond to the baseline surve y will still be eligible to complete the follow -up 
survey s unless they specifically request no further cont act. 
Qualitative Interviews : In a similar manner, we will invite eligible PCPs to participate in telephone 
interviews in 3 separate waves.  We will attempt to recruit and interview equal numbers of providers 
at both sites. However, we anticipate that more V A Puget Sound providers will participate due to the 
significantly higher number of providers at this site.  
▪ Wave 1: We will invite PCPs to participate in baseline interviews prior to  intervention start.   
▪ Wave 2:  
o Intervention PCPS : PCPs who have been “exposed” to the intervention, defined as 
having received 3 or more pulmonary E -consult interventions, will be invited to 
participate in “post -exposure” interviews.  PCPs do not have to have “accepted” 
intervention recommendations in order to be eligible fo r these interviews. We will 
email interview invitations to PCPs withing 1 -2 weeks after meeting the exposure 
criteria.  
o Control PCPs : PCPs randomized to the control group will be contacted to complete 
interviews using an interview guide derived from the bas eline interview guide. PCPs 
assigned to this group who already participated in the baseline interviews will not be 
contacted again.  
DISCuS COPD PROTOCOL                                       12/1/2021    
12 
 ▪ Wave 3: All PCPs who have completed post -exposure interviews will be invited via email to 
participate in a “maintenance” tel ephone interview, timed 18 -26 months following a 
provider’s site entry date. This timeline may change based on findings from Wave 2 and/or to 
meeting project needs.  
Patients:   
Randomized Intervention Trial : The DISCuS intervention is a variant of usual -care with no direct 
patient interaction. All recommendations made by the intervention  team for patients assigned to 
intervention providers are acted upon directly by the patient’s primary care clinician. As a result, 
there will be no attempt to consent patients to participate in the quality improvement initiative.  
▪ Once weekly, we will que ry CDW to create an updated list of all eligible patients and twice 
weekly identify patients with appointments in the next 1-3 weeks  with a participating PACT 
provider .  
▪ Among the eligible patients, if there are greater than 6 patients in the intervention arm, then 
each patient will be assigned a randomly generated number (via SQL ) and only the 6 lowest -
numbered intervention patients will be included in the study at that time. These patients will 
be assigned an index clinic date and have their charts review ed at that week’s collaborative 
review meeting(s) . The remaining patients  will re -enter the  pool of eligible patients . 
 
Qualitative Interviews : Patients of intervention -exposed PCPs will be purposively sampled and 
recruited to participate in qualitative interviews  timed approximately 3 months post -intervention.   
▪ To be eligible, patients : 1) will need to  be identified by the DI SCuS collaborative review team 
for the deprescribing intervention ; 2) have had an order to de -implement ICS signed by their 
PCP ; and 3) have attended their targeted clinic appointment.   
▪ Patients will be excluded from interview recruitment after chart review if there is 
documentation in the medical record of active suicidal or aggressive behavior, cognitive 
issues, homelessness, current inpatient hospitalization, or co -occurring interventions (i.e. 
current enrollment in COPD research).  
▪ Patient interview recruitment will be evenly spaced throughout the year to control for seasonal 
factors that may affect COPD sym ptoms.  
▪ Patients will be mailed invitations. Patients not returning an opt -out card will be contacted by 
phone to determine interest in completing the interview.  
 
8.3. Randomization  
The unit of randomization will be at the level of the  primary care PACT team . Randomization will 
occur at the team level to help avoid issues with contamination across study arms. At study start, we 
will stratify PACT teams (composed of 1 or more PCPs) into eight separate strata  (Figure ). These 
strata will b e defined by site (Seattle vs. Bedford), provider type (physician vs. advanced practice 
provider), and into “small” or “large” teams based on the median number of eligible patients 
identified.  If the number of eligible patients for a PACT team is equal to  the median, then the team 
will be randomly assigned to either the “small” or “large” stratum to help ensure balance across the 
eight strata. Within strata, PACT teams will then be randomly assigned in blocks of 4 to either the 
DISCuS COPD PROTOCOL                                       12/1/2021    
13 
 intervention arm or the usua l care arm of the study.  These blocks will be determined using randomly 
generate d sequences (i.e. ICIC, IICC, CIIC, etc ., where I=intervention and C=usual care arm).  
 
If a provider belongs to multiple PACT teams, their randomization will be based on their team with 
the most eligible patients. If there are equal number of eligible patients across their PACT teams, then 
the PACT team with the greatest panel size will be used for randomization. The providers’ other 
teams will assume the same study arm. After s tudy launch, the level of randomization will move to 
the level of the individual provider, and their randomization assignment will differ depending on 
situation.  
i. If a previously randomized PCP moves to a new PACT team, they will retain their original 
rand omization assignment.   
ii. If a new PCP joins an existing PACT team that has been previously randomized, that PCP 
will be assigned to the same study arm as the existing PACT team providers.  
iii. If a PACT is provider -less (e.g. when a PCP leaves VA), then the PACT will be re -
randomized based upon the correct strata when a new PCP is assigned (i.e. defined by 
location, provider type and eligible patient count). The PCP (and his/her associated 
PACT( s)) will be added to the next available pre -randomized slot that will be created by 
the study biostatistician at the time of initial randomization.  
iv. If a new PACT team is created for a new PCP , we will determine the correct strata for that 
PCP based upon t heir location, provider type and eligible patient count. The PC P (and 
his/her associated PACT (s)) will then  be added to the next available pre-randomized slot 
that will be created by the  study  biostatistician at the time of initial randomization.

 9. Index Clinic Date 
 
Eligible p atients with a qualifying  appointment as of the time of the weekly collaborative team 
meeting will be  assigned an index clinic date . For patients  assigned to intervention PCPs , this index 
clinic date corresponds to the date of their  scheduled  primary care visit following receipt of the 
intervention.  Patients assigned to PCPs in the usual care arm with an upcoming primary care 
appointment in the same week as the collaborative review meeting will also be assigned an index 
clinic date. Patients who are assigned to either arm who subsequently cancel, re -schedule or no -show 
to their clinic appointment will retain this original index date.  
 
10. Intervention  Arm  
 
10. 1 Non -intensive unlearning:  
Prior to study start, the Collaborative Review Team will attend a primary care staff meeting and 
provide a 10 -15 minute academic detailing session that includes information about: 1)  evidence for 
the use of inhaled corticosteroids to reduce exacerbations a nd symptoms among specific groups of 
patients with COPD ; 2) risks associated with their use, and 3) distinguishing appropriate from 
potentially inappropriate use of ICS among patients with COPD.  
 
10.2 Recommendations for  discontinuation of inappropriate ICS : 
Each week, for eligible patients identified with an upcoming appointment with an intervention 
primary care provider, we will perform the following:  
 
Chart abstraction : A project  coordinator will copy pertinent sections of the EHR into an abstraction 
template ( Appendix 2 ). These abstractions will include smoking status, lists of current medications, 
discharge summaries, notes from primary care, pulmonary, and the emergency departm ent, as well 
as the results of pulmonary function tests, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.  
 
Clinical review : The collaborative review team (consist ing of pulmonologists and project  coordinators) 
will meet t o review the chart abstraction, discuss the patient’s history, determine if the patient is 
inappropriately prescribed an inhaled corticosteroid, and formulate recommendations for  any 
changes to the patient’s inhaled therapies  (e.g. discontinuation of ICS and substitution of inhaled 
long -acting bronchodilators) .  
 
Recommendations to the patient’s inhaled therapies will be categorized as followed:  
1) “Recommendations ” will be made when the review team feels that there is sufficient history 
available to endorse a specific inhaled medication reg imen for a particular patient. These 
recommendations will be accompanied by unsigned orders for the clinician to sign/modify/or 
discontinue as they see fit (described below).  
 
  
DISCuS COPD PROTOCOL                                       12/1/2021    
15 
 a. A recommendation will be considered “conditional” if it is dependent upon a sp ecific 
criteria being met (e.g. the teams’ understanding that the patient has not had any recent 
exacerbations of their COPD).  
2) “Considerations” will be made in circumstances when the review team feels they are unable to 
strongly endorse a  specific inhaled medication regiment for a particular patient. Examples of 
these circumstances may include scenarios where there is insufficient history available in the 
chart to identify if the patient  has an indication to remain on an ICS, or  if a change is not 
necessari ly appropriate now , but may be it the future.  
a. A consideration may be considered “conditional” if it is dependent upon a specific 
criteria being met (e.g. after a period of continued stability with no further 
exacerbations, it may be appropriate to disconti nue the patient’s ICS at a later date).  
 
The team may also make a dditional recommendations relevant to the patient’s pulmonary condition. 
For example, for patients found to have no evidence of COPD, the team may include 
recommendations for additional work -up or pulmonary consultation . 
 
Entering recommendations with or without orders into the EHR : We will provide the PCP with 
recommendations in the form of an E -consult timed to coincide with the patient’s upcoming index 
clinic visit ( Appendix 3 ). The E -consult will be performed/signed by one of the study team 
pulmonologists and include : 
1) A brief introduct ory paragraph that identifies the clinical  team members, the intervention, and 
instructions on how to contact the study team with any questions or concerns.  
2) Specific recommendations for changes to the patient’s inhaled therapies and the rationale and 
evidence behind those recommendations.  
3) Links to evidence -based guidelines that support the recommended changes to the patient’s 
inhaled therapies.  
 
The patient’s PCP will be added as an additional signer on the E -consult note, prompting a view alert 
than ensures that they receive  the recommendations. If the patient has a pulmonologist they will be 
included as an additional signer on the E -consult note as well.  Clinicians will be encouraged to reach 
out to the study team with questions or concerns.  
 
At the same time that the E -consult is placed in the EHR, we will enter unsigned orders on behalf of 
the PCP that correspond to recommendations contained within the E -consult. These unsigned orders 
will prompt an additional view alert to the PCP. These orders can then  be signed, modified or 
discontinued by the PCP as appropriate based on their personal knowledge of the patient’s clinical 
condition. This process ensures tha t the PCP maintains autonomous care of the patient. As noted 
above, if additional clinical context is needed prior to making a recommendation, we will instead 
offer only “considerations” and will not enter any  related  orders on behalf of the PCP.  
 
10.3 Titration to wean off Inhaled Corticosteroids  
Patients prescribed budesonide 160/formoterol 4.5 mcg (the most commonly used LABA/ICS in the 
formulary) will be  provided with a titration plan to taper off inhaled corticosteroids by initiating a 
DISCuS COPD PROTOCOL                                       12/1/2021    
16 
 once daily do se of mometasone 220 mcg for one month.17 Note: as of March 2017, additional data has 
emerged that this is potentially not necessary .18 As a result, we will now tape r inhaled corticosteroids 
on a case by case basis  (e.g. for patients with recent exacerbations and/or high respiratory symptom 
burde n) 
 
11. Usual Care Arm  
Providers assigned to the usual care arm will attend the academic detailing session described above. 
We will not perform chart abstraction or formulate recommendations for patients assigned to usual 
care providers. Patients assigned to usual care PCPs will continue to receive inhaled medications and 
management of their COPD from their PCPs and/or pulmonologists.  
 
12. Blinding  
The investigators and participants will be unblinded as to intervention arm. This decision was made 
based on several factors, including: 1) Blinding is impractical as intervention /clinical  staff and 
physician investigators must know the patient and provider names in the intervention group in order 
to access the electronic medical record to input orders an d notes. Clinician participants can also not 
be blinded because receiving an unexplained intervention would not be acceptable in a clinical 
setting. 2) This is an operations project that is designed to deliver evidence -based care previously 
shown to be eff ective and the majority of our resources should be used to implement the intervention.  
Data collection to assess outcomes in CDW will occur in a blinded fashion using SQL queries that do 
not incorporate intervention arm. This allows an unbiased assessment  of our primary and secondary 
outcomes  across the two arms. Chart abstraction will be utilized to collect data on the subset of 
outcomes that will be collected only among the intervention arm. This data collection will necessarily 
occur in an unblinded fas hion.  
 
13. Outcomes  
 
13.1 Primary Outcome Measure:   Percentage of patients with discontinued, or expired and not  
renewed, ICS that remain off at 6 months ( index date + 180 days).  
▪ We will assess this measure using detailed prescription data extracted from the VA 
Corporate Date Warehouse (CDW). All patients who no longer have an active ICS order at 6 
months (defined as index date + 180 days), will be considered to be “off” ICS.   
o Percentage of patients that remain off ICS at 6 months will be calculated for each 
study arm as: (# of patients off ICS/# of patients) *100.  
▪ Patients who died prior to end of follow -up are considered to be “off” ICS  
 
13.2 Secondary Outcome Measures:

o Mortality will be assessed for each study arm as  a percentage :  total # deaths /# of 
patients  *100 . 
o Mortality will be determined by the presence of a date of death occurring between the 
(index date + 1 day) and (index date + 180 days)  
 
Among patients in the intervention arm only : 
▪ Among intervention patients who meet entry and exclusion criteria (collecte d at time of 
recommendations/order entry):  
o Number of participants receiving recommendations  
o Number of participants receiving recommendation to stop ICS  
 
▪ Percentage of recommendations accepted by PCPs within 6 months ( index date + 180 days)

Additional secondary outcomes:  
Maintenance (to be assessed post -project intervention):  
1. Assess whether PCPs prescribe ICS appropriately for new patients with COPD who do not 
receive our direct intervention.

intervention period.  
ii. Patients with COPD already  under care of a study PACT/PCP that become 
eligible following the intervention period.  
b. Assess for temporal changes in the control group (measuring contamination).  
 
Using a combination of surveys and qualitative interviews, the following implementation out comes 
will also be assessed among PCPs: 1) burnout; 2) professional efficacy; 3) perception of evidence to 
support the use of ICS among patients with COPD; and 3) acceptability of the intervention. Among 
patients, acceptability of the intervention will als o be assessed.  
Adoption:  The qualitative team will examine factors related to adoption , including patient and 
operational barriers and the fidelity of the implementation . 
Implementation Costs :  The economic core will develop budget impact analyses  and as sess the 
implementation costs of the intervention.  
 
14. Additional Assessments  
14.1 Baseline Characteristics  
We will utilize CDW to identify the following sociodemographic information for PCPs:  
▪ Provider type (MD vs advanced practice provider)  
▪ Associated PACT team and location  
We will utilize CDW to identify/calculate the following for eligible patients:  
▪ Sociodemographic information (age, race, gender)  
▪ Height, weight and body mass index  
▪ Elixhauser Comorbidities: Collected for the year prior to the index date  
DISCuS COPD PROTOCOL                                       12/1/2021    
20 
 ▪ Prior inpatient and outpatient COPD exacerbations (defined above) in the year prior to index 
date  
▪ Prior inpatient and outpatient pneumonia events (year prior to index date)  
▪ Hospitalizati ons within the year prior to index date: including length of stay, ICU status, and 
use of non -invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation  
▪ Health factors: Most recent smoking status known prior to the index date.  
▪ Detailed prescription data for inhaled medic ations in the year prior to the index date  
▪ Pulmonary clinic visits in the year prior to index date  
In addition, w e will utilize a combination of CDW and EHR chart abstraction to identify spirometry 
performed in the 5 years prior to index date.  
14.2 Qualitative Interviews  
We will utilize a semi -structured guides  to interview primary care providers  by telephone  at 
different 3 timepoints: 1) baseline, prior to planned intervention activities (Appendix 4) 2) after 
“exposure” to the intervention, with “exposure” defined as receipt of 3 pulmonary e -consult ations 
(Appendix 5) and 3) in the maintenance phase  (Appendix 6), 18-26 months following a provider’s 
site entry date.  The interview guides are intended to explore PCP’s experiences with prescribing ICS 
for COPD, familiarity with evidence and guidelines for prescribing ICS, and views on 
discontinuation of ICS.  The interview g uides are informed by the de -implementation and 
implementation literature, and include key constructs such as understanding the evidence for and 
against a clinical practice,  19-21 psychological reactance,22,23 and organizational context that support 
clinical change.19-22 
We will similarly utilize semi -structured guides to interview patients assigned to intervention PCPs 
at a single time point, approximately 3 months post -intervention ( Appendix 7). 
The interview guides for PCPs and patient participants include open ended -questions and semi -
structured probes to assure uniform data collection of key topics while allowing exploration of 
emerging unanticipated themes.  All interviews will be audio -recorded and transcribed verbatim for 
analysis.  
14.3 Quantitat ive Surveys  
Quantitative surveys will be administered to participating PCPs via REDCap at baseline ( Appendix 
8), 12 months following inclusion in the intervention trial ( Appendix 9), and at the end of the study 
(Appendix 10 ). The survey s will be used to elicit clinician perspectives on their experience with ICS 
to treat patients with COPD (e.g. frequency of use, efficacy, and adverse effects), perceptions of 
discontinuing ICS in mild -moderate COPD, as well as their intention for use of IC S in the following 
6 months to treat patients with COPD.  Additional information will also be collected about 
leadership and management behaviors, job -related feelings, turnover intentions, and demographics. 
Select questions from the Maslach Burnout Invent ory will be adopted,24 in order to assess trends and 
DISCuS COPD PROTOCOL                                       12/1/2021    
21 
 direct future q uality improvement initiatives. We will have all necessary employee unions review 
and approve the survey instrument and interview guides prior to administration.  
15. Analytic Approach  
Analysis overview :  This is a cluster -randomized trial with patients nes ted within individual 
provider who are nested within teams.  This type of design invalidates many of the standard 
approaches to assess patient -level randomized trials because of the correlation that exists between 
patients cared for by one clinician within  a team.  It is reasonable to expect that patients within a 
physician’s practice are likely not to be independent of one another. This effect, depending on intra -
physician correlations,  means that naïve model -based standard errors that assume independence 
between patients will be incorrect. As a result, confidence intervals and p -values based on those 
standard errors would not be valid .  Hierarchical modeling methods, using generalized linear mixed 
model (GLMM), will be necessary to assess the effect of the  intervention  while taking into account the 
potential correlation between patients seeing the same physician .  The primary hypothesis to be 
tested is that the intervention will lead to a decrease in the inappropriate use of inhaled 
corticosteroids (ICS).   
Statistical analysis will occur in two phases.  First, provider level descriptive profiles will be 
constructed on primary and secondary outcome variables to assess trends and identify potential 
outliers . Second, we will  fit GLMM models and  conduct hypothesis testing analyses for the specific 
aims as described below.  
15.1. Baseline Analysis and Descriptive Statistics  
Equivalence of participants and providers in the intervention and control arms will be assessed on 
demogra phic and clinical variables, including outcomes, health status, co -morbidity, and utilization 
variables. Because this is a randomized controlled trial, no systematic bias is anticipated. However, 
we will adjust for the covariates where a  statistically sign ificant difference is found and related to the 
primary and secondary outcomes. We will report summary statistics for all baseline covariates and 
outcomes (means, standard deviations, and quartiles for continuous variables; frequencies and 
percentages for b inary variables) by randomized treatment group.  
Data Analysis: The primary outcome measure for this study will be whether or not a patient 
remains off ICS at 180 days post targeted PCP visit (index date) . The important factors in the study 
design are: Trea tment Group, PACT Team, PCP , and Patient.  Initial randomization will occur at the 
level of the PACT, with an anticipated 1:1 relationship between PACT and PCPs. Following study 
start, the unit of randomization will move to the level of the PCP. PCPs with more than one PACT 
will have all PACTs assigned to the same study arm. For these reasons, it is clustering of patients 
within provider that we will be primarily concerned with in this analysis, as grouping by PACTs 
would not provide additional meaningful i nformation.  We will use the patient as the unit of analysis, 
and use generalized linear mixed effect model (GLMM) to account for clustering of patients within 
PCP.  
DISCuS COPD PROTOCOL                                       12/1/2021    
22 
 GLMM is an extension of traditional regression techniques that accounts for the effect of clustering as 
well as for important confounding factors found to not be balanced between the treatment and 
control groups at baseline.  A GLMM approach will allow us to estimate the effect of the 
randomization group on patient outcome.   
A multivariable mo del will be constructed based on the outcome of whether the given patient was 
not on ICS at 180 days after the targeted PCP visit, with randomization group and any variables 
found to be imbalanced across arms as adjustment covariates (mixed -effects logisti c regression 
model).  The intervention will be considered statistically significant if the indicator variable for the 
intervention group is significantly associated with a change in the odds of a patient being off ICS at 
180 days after the PCP visit.  The GLMM model for this analysis:  
  
ln(𝜋𝑖𝑗
1−𝜋𝑖𝑗)=𝛽0+𝛽1treatment j+γ𝑗(1) 
  
Where𝜋𝑖𝑗 is the probability of patient i within the jth provider staying off ICS at 180 days after the 
targeted PCP visit, 𝛽1 is an indicator variable equal to 1 if provider j is in the intervention group and 0 
if the provider is in the control group, and γ𝑗 corresponds to the random intercept  for the jth 
provider. The random intercepts  are assumed  to be identically distributed independent draws from a 
mean -zero Normal distribution with unknown variance.   
15.2 Sensitivity Analyses  
In addition to the primary analyses, sensitivity analyses will be conducted  using Generalized 
Estimating Equations (GEE) which account for clustering within the data by allowing for the 
specification of a correlation structure if the assumptions of GLMMs are not met.  
15.3 Missing data analyses  
All appropriate efforts  will be made to avoid missing data. For example, accruing data will be 
monitored for the presence of missing values, and the study manager and coordinators will 
investigate causes and/or remedies for missing data. For key analysis variables that have 15% or more 
missing values, we will analyze patient and clinical factors that are associated with having a missing 
value. We will then perform our primary analyses using multiple imputation to impute these key 
variables to allow analysis for all subjects and r educe any bias associated with the missing data.  
15.4 Secondary Analyses  
Summary statistics (counts and percentages) will be computed for the following outcome variables 
that will be collected following baseline:  
1. Number and percentage of patients that meet entry criteria  
a. Number and percentage of patients that meet entry criteria overall  
DISCuS COPD PROTOCOL                                       12/1/2021    
23 
 b. Number and percentage of patients that meet entry criteria and are recommended to 
stop ICS  
2. Number and percentage of patients for whom the substituted recommendations are  accepted.  
3. Number and percentage of patients where ICS recommendation accepted but restarted by 180 
post index visit  
Further data analysis will also be performed for secondary outcome measures.  The procedure that is 
outlined above for the analysis of the primary outcome variable will be followed for the binary 
secondary outcome measures listed below.  For each variable listed, model (1) will be modified to 
instead include the listed secondary variable as the outcome variable in the model.  
1. COPD exacerbation  within 180 days  
2. Pneumonia within 180 days  
3. Mortality within 180 days  
We will perform additional sensitivity analysis assessing number of COPD exacerbations using 
mixed -effects zero -inflated Poisson regression models and time -to-COPD exacerbation and 
pneumo nia using mixed -effects Cox proportional -hazards regression models.  
Further secondary analysis will include summary statistics used to evaluate PCP burnout, 
professional efficacy, perceptions of evidence for the use of ICS, acceptability of the interventio n to 
PCPs, implementation costs, and maintenance of the intervention.  
 
15.5 Sample Size and Power  
For a cluster randomized control trial, the hypothesis that will be tested is 𝐻𝑜: 𝑃1=𝑃2, where 𝑃1 and 𝑃2 are the 
population success rates in the experim ental group and control groups, respectively.  According to Friedman  2010,25 the 
total number of subjects required for the study is  
 
𝑛=2[𝑍𝛼/2√2𝑃̅(1−𝑃̅)+𝑍𝛽√𝑃1(1−𝑃1)+𝑃2(1−𝑃2)]2
[1+(𝑚−1)𝜌]

where 𝜌 is the intracluster correlation, 𝑚 is the number of individuals in each cluster randomly assigned either the

 Assuming the total number of patients is ~700 , two variables can vary, 𝜌 the intracluster correlation and k the number of 
clusters.  We see in the all scenarios  ( 𝜌 varying between 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) and with 𝑃1=1, 𝑃2=.5, 𝛼= .05 and k = 
120, 60 or 30, that the power exceeds 99.9%.  
 
Assuming 130 (80%) participating providers, ~700 patients,  a conservative estimate of 50% of patients remaining off ICS 
in the intervention group, α of 0.05  , and a coefficient of variation of 0.1, we estimate our power to be in excess of 95%.  
 
 
15.6. Mixed -methods Analysis: Quantitative Survey and Qualitative Data Analysis  
We will utilize sequential mixed methods using qualitative interview findings to inform subsequent 
development of quantitative surv ey questions. Qualitative analysis of baseline interviews will be 
conducted using iterative deductive and inductive content analysis methods.26 Deductive analysis 
will involve application of a priori codes based on key construct definitions from the de -
implementation literature and the interview guide questions.19-22 Inductive content analysis will 
consist of open and unstructured coding to capture data that does not fit into a priori  categories. 
Emergent codes will be added throughout the analysis, allowing us to identify emergent and 
previously unidentified or unexpected themes. Broad themes will be i dentified based on 
representative interview responses and grouped to describe distinct aspects of patient’s experiences. 
The qualitative team will meet weekly to discuss data and reach consensus on interpretation of 
themes and findings. Findings will then inform adaptation of the PCP surveys.  
Following survey data collection, we will use convergent mixed methods to identify qualitative data 
(from both patient and clinician interviews) that enhances our understating of the survey findings or 
indicates potent ial generalizability of the qualitative findings.27  
 
16. Protection of Human Subjects  
16.1 Quality Improvement Designation  
This project was designated as a quality improvement (QI) initiative by the VA Office of Specialty 
Care Services.  As such, we will not obtain informed consent from primary care providers or their 
patients  as part of the clinical trial.  
16.2 Data and Safety Monitoring  
Adverse events: As this was a quality improvement intervention, we will not systematically assess 
for all adverse events. We will assess relevant safety outcomes of exacerbations (inpatient, outpatient, 
and combined), pneumonia events (inpatient, outpatient, and combined) , and mortality.  
16.3 Recommendation fidel ity 
At study start, all participating pulmonologists will attend joint review meetings and discussion and 
reach consensus about wording of recommendations, orders, and standardized language to use for 
the intervent ion. We will ensure that coordinators have detailed instructions on how to enter notes 
DISCuS COPD PROTOCOL                                       12/1/2021    
25 
 and/or orders into the EHR for intervention patients. We will require coordinators to consult with a 
study clinician before entering any information in the EHR about whi ch they have any questions.  
16.4 Data management and confidentiality  
This project requires the creation, maintenance, and analysis of a large, multivariate, database that 
includes a variety of measures from multiple sources.  Recognizing that the success of this study 
critically depends on the quality of the data collected, systematic data collection, quality control, and 
data management procedures, we will implement: 1) specification and use of concise protocols; 2) 
rigorous training, certification, and p eriodic re -training of study personnel, with on -going monitoring 
of adherence to data collection and handling protocol; 3) validation and verification of all data, and 4) 
regular meetings and progress reports to provide specific, well -documented feedback to project 
personnel concerning potential difficulties as well as follow -up to ensure that problems are resolved 
quickly.   
 
We will assign all participants a unique stud y ID. The master list will be stored separately from the 
data and accessible only by study staff.  For clinical note abstractions, we will not remove identifiers 
because that material is copied verbatim, making it difficult to ensure that any reference to names, 
location, and dates were removed. We believe it is safer to acknowledge that identifiers will be 
present, and to carefully adhere to our strict protocol to store the abstracted notes on a secure server 
accessible only by authorized  staff.  Chart abs tracted notations will not be entered into the study 
database.  
 
We will store data in strong password protected environment on the secure VA network server.   
 
For provider on -line surveys, we will e -mail a link that populates data on the VA secure server.   Data 
will be secured at the database level, using a role -based and record -level security model.    
 
We will store data on paper in secure, locked file cabinets within secure offices. Any communications 
between study staff and provider participants regardi ng patient care will occur via encrypted e -mail.

 18. Summary of Changes from Original Protocol  
 
▪ 07/19/2016: Patient exclusion criteria: diagnosis of asthma  
o Clarified that asthma diagnoses identified in intervention patients at the time of chart 
review (in problem list or from chart abstraction) will not exclude them from the 
intervention; This change was made in order to ensure that patients assigned to 
providers in both arms are treated the same.  
▪ 09/13/2016: Change in treatment of clinic cancellations/no -shows  
o Previously planned to not assign an index date for patients that cancelled/no -showed 
their clinic appointments after the collaborative review meeting, but follow them for   
six additional months to determine if had eligible c linic visit before permanently 
excluding them; Changed to assigning these patients an index date corresponding to the 
planned visit that was cancelled/no -showed. This change is consistent with an 
intention -to-treat approach, as intervention patients would have already had a 
note/unsigned orders placed in the chart.  
▪ 09/20/2016: Clarification of categorization of recommendations  
o Clarified categorization of recommendations for outcome assessment into 
“recommendations” and “considerations”, each with potential to also be “conditional.”  
▪ 10/18/2016: Frequency of data pulls and team reviews  
o Changed from interrogating EHR for upcoming primary care appointments for eligible 
patients from once to twice weekly.  
▪ 12/05/2016: Patient eligibility criteria  
o Patients can be targeted for an index visit if they are found to have a scheduled 
appointment at least 7 days prior to the occurrence of an appointment  
▪ 12/06/2016: Patient eligibility criteria  
o Patients assigned to intervention PCPs previously were noted to be eligible to 
participate in interviews 3 months following their index date. Eligibility criteria clarified 
to ensure that patients interviewed included only those who had had their ICS de -
implemented.  
▪ 02/01/2017: Patient eligibility criteria: Definition of fixed air flow obstruction  
o The definition of fixed airflow obstruction was changed from post -bronchodilator 
FEV1/ FVC <0.70  to post -bronchodilator FEV1/VC <0.70, indicating that for the 
denominator, either the post -bronchodilator FVC or SVC could be used, whichever i s 
greater.  
▪ 02/07/2017: Number of eligible patients each week  
o Changed from maximum of 3 patients per arm each week to be assigned an index date 
to a maximum of 6 patients per arm; increased meetings of collaborative team from 
once to twice weekly.  
▪ 03/14/201 7: Change in recommendations to taper off ICS  
DISCuS COPD PROTOCOL                                       12/1/2021    
28 
 o Based on re -evaluation of available evidence, Investigators decided to no longer 
routinely recommend tapering off inhaled corticosteroids due to its complexity and lack 
of known efficacy. Case by case basis use d to decide if tapering appropriate (e.g. if 
patients had recent exacerbations and/or high respiratory symptom burden, etc.)  
▪ 05/11/2017: Patient eligibility criteria  
o ICD-9 Diagnostic code 493.2x (chronic obstructive asthma) was added to the list of 
exclusi onary ICD -9 codes (previously missed); exclusionary code now written as 493.X  
▪ 05/23/2017: Change in patient eligibility criteria for qualitative interview  
o Prior to this date, intervention and control patients were considered to be possibly 
eligible to part icipate in qualitative interviews. Criteria were changed so that only 
patients assigned to intervention PCPs were to be interviewed.  
▪ 05/26/2017: Templated E -consult note change  
o Templated text changed to include a request that PCP discuss any medication cha nges 
with their patients at their upcoming appointment. This change was prompted by 
instances of orders/notes being signed by PCP and patients not being made aware of 
change.  
▪ 11/28/2017: Clarification: PCP Survey Eligibility  
o Clarified that all active PCPs are eligible to receive follow -up surveys (not just those 
that received baseline surveys).  
▪ 01/03/2018: Clarification of randomization process  
o Clarified that if a PCP/PACT has a number of eligible patients equal to the median # of 
eligible patients identified for a PACT that they would be randomly assigned to “small” 
or “large” stratum.  
▪ 5/21/2018 : Patient eligibility criteria  
o Changed exclusion criteria to FEV1 <30% predicted from <50% predicted based on 
updated GOLD guidelines (severity of a irflow limitation alone no longer an indication 
for prescription of inhaled corticosteroids; team decided to still exclude those with very 
severe airflow obstruction).  
o Updated background section of protocol to reflect most recent evidence  
▪ 10/16/2020: Outco me assessment and Analyses  
o Decided to supplement CDW data with EHR abstraction to ensure data quality of 
recommendation acceptance and assess non -pharmacologic recommendations  
o Changed outcome assessment period for secondary outcomes from (index date + 180 
days) to (index date + 1 day) to (index date + 180 days)  
o No longer plan to stratify exacerbation rates by presence or absence of airflow 
obstruction  
o No longer plan to account for clustering of PCPs within PACT team within GLMM 
analysis. This decision was m ade because at the initial randomization there was 1:1 
relationship between PCPs and PACTS (making them synonymous) and following 
initial randomization the unit of randomization was the PCP. This means that 
DISCuS COPD PROTOCOL                                       12/1/2021    
29 
 accounting for clustering within PCP sufficiently  accounts for clustering within PACT 
team as well; and adding the PACT team to the analysis would not add additional 
meaningful information.  
o We initially planned a primary analysis restricted to participants who complete the 
study and have fully observed outcomes and covariates (complete case analysis). 
However, after finding an imbalance in smoking status between groups, smoking status 
was included as an additional covariate in our GLMM analysis. Due to ~ 5% 
missingness of this covariate, we performed our  primary analysis using multiple 
imputation with chained equations.  
o Additional sensitivity analyses added to account for counts of COPD exacerbations 
(using mixed -effects zero -inflated Poisson regression models ) and time -to-COPD 
exacerbation and pneumonia (using mixed -effects Cox proportional -hazards regression 
models ). 
▪ 12/1/2021: Made correct ions to protocol to clarify secondary outcomes  
o Rate  of exacerbation: deno minator changed to reflect “participant time” rat her than 
“number of participants”  
o Rate of pneumonia: removed reference to events/patient and left only correct definition 
of rate  (inpatient or outpatient pneumonia events/participant time since index) . 
o Mortality: incorrectly labeled as rate rather than percentage; corrected.

 Appendix 3 : E-Consult Note Template  
Pulmonary Non -visit E -Consult Note  
 
 
As part of an ongoing quality improvement initiat ive (DISCuS COPD) within pulmonary, our team has reviewed your 
patient's medical record to review their use of inhaled corticosteroids.  Our team from pulmonary medic ine includes Drs. 
David Au (VAPSHCS), Laura Feemster (VAPSHCS), Renda Wiener (Bedford VA) , and Seppo Rinne (Bedford VA) .  
 
We have entered any recommendations as orders for you to review, modify as you see fit and sign, if agreeable.  If you 
have questions, please feel free to contact us by encrypted e -mail (VHAPUGSVCICS@va.gov), CPRS, Pulmonary SCAN -
ECHO, or E -Consult.  
 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS:  
1. [enter recommendation to stop inhaled corticosteroid if not indicated  (may include taper off of ICS) ] 
2. [enter recommendation for substitution of long -acting bronchodilator(s) if indicated ] 
3. [enter any additional recommendations ] 
 
Please discuss any medication changes that you make with this patient in their upcoming visit with you.  
 
 
 
RATIONALE:  
[provide summary of patient’s history and current inhaled medic ation regimen ] 
 
[provide rationale for recommended changes in inhaled therapies ] For example:  Recent guidelines advocate that i n the  
absence of frequent exacerbations (defined below) patients with COPD should be treated primarily with long -acting 
bronchodi lators and to reserve the addition of inhaled corticosteroids for patients with frequent exacerbations.  Inhaled 
corticosteroids have been shown i n multiple randomized trials to increase the risk of pneumonia  among patients with 
COPD.    
 
 
Frequent exacerb ations are defined as 2 or more outpatient exacerbations in the past year AND/OR  1 or more inpatient 
exacerbations  in the past 1 year. For patients with COPD that are not controlled with one long -acting bronchodilator, 
combination LABA/LAMA is preferred th erapy over LABA/ICS combinations.

AND THEIR DE RIVATIVES 
Abbreviation  Compound 
name  Comments  
TDF Tenofovir 
disoproxil 
fumarate  This is the inactive, oral formulation of tenofovir (trade name: Viread). The ester form enhances oral absorption and 
bioavailability. TDF is rapidly metabolized after dosing to the de-
esterified pro- drug, tenofovir (TFV), which is also inactive.  
TFV Tenofovir  This is the inactive, de -esterified form of TDF. This is the form of the 
drug that is measured in serum, blood, other body fluids, and tissue 
samples.  
TFV-DP Tenofovir 
diphosphate  This is the active, phosphorylated form of tenofovir that is 
generated in cells. This is the form of the drug that is measured in cells (e.g., PBMCs). It is rapidly dephosphorylated to the inactive 
form outside of cells, and has a very short half -life outside of cells in 
tissue.  
FTC Emtricitabine  This antiretroviral drug is co -formulated with TDF in Truvada® 
(TDF/FTC). FTC is an inactive pro -drug that is activated in cells by 
phosphorylation. This is the form of emtricitabine that is measured in serum, blood, other body fluids, and tissue samples.  
FTC-TP Emtricitabine 
triphosphate  This is the active, phosphoylated form of FTC that is generated in 
cells. This is the form of the drug that is measured in cells (e.g., 
PBMCs).  
Truvada ® Tenofovir plus 
Emtricitabine  This is the co -formulated drug produced by Gilead Sciences, Inc. 
Each pill contains 300 mg of TDF and 200 mg of FTC.  
MRV  Maraviroc  This is the a ctive oral formulation of maraviroc (Selzentry®).   
DTG  Dolutegravir  This is the active oral formulation of Dolutegravir  (Tivicay ®)

Description of Study Phases  
Screening :  Participants  will be recruited from a variety of advertisements, and pre- screened using a 
telephone IRB -approved questionnaire.  If p articipants  are interested and pass the initial screening, a 
screening s tudy visit in the research center  will be scheduled.  This visi t should take approximately 90 
minutes, during which full physical examination and medical history will be obtained, as well as physical 
diagnostics to assess for eligibility.  This visit must be completed within the 28 days prior to enrollment.  
Phase 1:  Consists of a 28- day study period, with a single dose of study product on Day 0 (maraviroc,  
tenofovir/emtricitabine, or dolutegravir ).  Day 0 can be scheduled on either Mondays or Tuesdays, and 
once eligibility is confirmed on the day of enrollment, a wit nessed dose of study product will be 
administered.  Participants  will return to the clinic for hair and blood sampling on Days 3/7/14/21/28 days 
post-dose.  Adverse events will be assessed at every visit.  Safety labs will be drawn at the midpoint  and 
at the end of the study phase, and at any time indicated due to suspected adverse events.  These visits 
should last less than 30 minutes.  
Phase 2: Consists of a 28- day study period, with each subject receiving a single daily observed dose of 
study product begi nning on Day 0.  Day 0 can be scheduled on either Mondays or Tuesdays, once 
continued eligibility is confirmed.  Target scheduling will have Phase 2 begin within 2 weeks of completing 
Phase 1, but could be extended up to 28 days as clinic availability dict ates.  Participants  will return to the 
clinic daily for dosing, and for hair and blood sampling on Days 3/7/14/21/28 days post -dose.  Adverse 
events will be assessed at every visit.  Safety labs will be drawn at the midpoint , and at the end of the 
study phase, and at any time indicated due to adverse events.  These visits should last less than 30 
minutes.   Dosing only visits should last less than 5 minutes.  
Phase 3:  Consists of a 28- day study period, with three randomized drug- dosing schemas.  Day 0 can be  
scheduled on Mondays, Tuesdays or Fridays, once continued eligibility is confirmed.  Target scheduling 
will have Phase 3 begin as soon as possible after completing Phase 2, on a Monday/Tuesday/Or Friday within the week.  On Day 0, p articipants  will be ran domized to one of 3 potential dosing schemes:  
 a—No further doses  
 b—One dose weekly (Day 0, 7, 14, 21) 4 doses  
 c—Three Doses weekly (Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays)  
(Days 0, 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, 18, 21, 23, 25) 12 doses  
15 
  
Participants  will return to cli nic for observed dosing as scheduled, and for hair and blood sampling on 
days 3/7/14/21/28).  Safety labs will be drawn at the midpoint , at the end, and at any time indicated due to 
adverse events.  These visits should last less than 30 minutes.  Dosing onl y visits should last less than 
five minutes.  
Follow -Up:  Within 2 weeks of the final sampling visit, all p articipants  will return to the clinic for a final 
safety visit.  Updated exam and medical history will be obtained as indicated, as well as vital signs and adverse events assessments. Safety labs and EKG will be collected.

1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1 The Need for Quantify Antiretroviral Adherence  
 Adherence to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy is critical for achieving HIV RNA suppression in HIV -infected 
patients and for preventing HIV acquisition in uninfected individuals using pre- exposure prophylaxis 
(PrEP). Yet a high level of adherence is challenging for HIV -infected individuals on life -long ARVs, and for 
HIV-negative individuals using daily PrEP who are not at daily risk for HIV acquisition. Poor adherence 
was primarily responsible for a lack of drug effectiveness in multiple recent double- blind, placebo-
controlled PrEP studies. These studies found that counting product returns and using patient self -report 
significantly over predicted adherence as measured by ARV concentrations in blood plasma, dried blood 
spots,  or cells.  
Since the consequences of poor or intermittent adherence are significant, valid measures of adherence 
are critical for optimizing  the effectiveness of both HIV treatment and prevention, in both the clinic al and 
research settings. Measuring drug concentrations is a more accurate measure of adherence than is self -
report.  Blood plasma or intracellular concentration monitoring have been  considered the “gold standard” 
for determining if an ARV has been ingested, and is a common marker for therapeutic drug monitoring or clinical trial adherence monitoring. However, this approach has its own set of limitations, including being invasive, requiring advanced processing or storage (e.g. intracellular measures), being a short -term 
measure of drug taking behavior (depending on the half -life of the analyte), and requiring long turn-
around times or substantial sample processing prior to analysis. Up per layer packed cells (ULPC) and 
Dried blood spot (DBS) analysis have been used as alternatives to plasma.  DBS was  generated as a 
less invasive, simple, and validated alternative to traditional venous sampling.  The advantages are that it can involve mor e minimally invasive sampling, even with a small finger prick.  Most analytes are more 
stable in DBS than in frozen sample, which also translates to convenient storage and transport.  Since blood plasma, ULPC,  and dried blood spot analysis are valid indust ry standards to assess patient 
adherence, we will use them both in this research as comparators to hair concentrations.   
We propose the use of infra- red (IR) matrix -assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization (MALDESI) 
technology for mass spectromet ry imaging (MSI) to visualize and quantify ARV concentrations in hair. Our 
hypothesis is that IR -MALDESI MSI can rapidly quantify ARV concentrations, provide evidence of drug 
ingestion non- invasively and longitudinally, and allow for clinician/researcher and patient/study participant 
feedback on adherence performance. We were awarded a grant from the NIH to begin to evaluate the 
feasibility and acceptability of this technology.  Three specific aims of our grant are proposed: 1) Develop 
IR-MALDESI MSI hair p rotocols for high sensitivity and accuracy to quantify 11 ARVs in 5 therapeutic 
17 
 drug classes, 2) Conduct 3 structured dose proportionality studies to develop mathematical benchmarks 
for real -time IR -MALDESI hair adherence monitoring in both PrEP and HIV tr eatment applications, and 
validate the benchmarks with a Phase 2 PrEP study, and 3) In the setting of REAL TIME clinical 
monitoring, investigate the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of using hair IR -MALDESI MSI to 
provide HIV+ patients with feedback regarding longitudinal patterns of medication adherence. The goal of 
this work is to develop a simple, noninvasive, longitudinal depiction of ARV adherence that will provide 
high clarity feedback for both clinicians and patients.  
 
In AIM 1, over t he last year we have completed collection of numerous hair samples from p articipants  of 
different genders, races, and evaluated the effect of hair treatments (i.e. coloring, chemicals, etc.) to 
facilitate formulating this protocol in the most informed way.  In our AIM 1 work, we assessed the ability of 
the technology to see drug in hair of all genders, races and ethnicities.  We also evaluated if any treatments to hair, such as bleach, dye or other chemicals, affected the quality of the data obtained from 
hair.  Both of these evaluations helped us delineate our inclusion and exclusion criteria for our AIM 2 
work. This protocol is to cover the work necessary in AIM 2, to further the investigation into the use of hair 
as measure of drug adherence.  
 1.2 Ratio nale 
It is important to identify if someone is taking a medication regularly and as prescribed, to optimize their 
health and well -being.  Sometimes, patients have trouble remembering if, and when, they miss doses; 
other times, even though patients are taki ng their medication, it is not getting into the body in the correct 
amount.  Quickly monitoring medications in 5- 10 hair strands using our novel imaging technology called 
IR-MALDESI will allow patients and their doctors to see how much medicat ion they are exposed to over 
one or more months, and help identify challenges to taking medication in both research and clinical 
settings.  This proposal will optimize and explore the accuracy and feasibility of using IR -MALDESI for 
monitoring medications in hair in comparison to the current industry standards.  
1.3 Dose Proportionality
 
 
Dose proportionality occurs when an r fold increase in dose results in an r fold increase in exposure, 
which is typically measured by C max or AUC (Hummel et al. 2009).  Dose proportionality is important when 
considering how to predict the change in drug exposure and its corresponding biologic response with a 
change in dose.  We are concerned with the proportionality between dose and the corr esponding 
concentration in the hair.  In order to reliably predict hair exposure, confidence in dose proportionality is 
necessary.   Our goal is to prove this dose proportionality relationship in order to develop mathematical 
benchmarks for real -time IR -MADLESI hair adherence monitoring in both PrEP and HIV treatment 
applications.   
1.4 Background  (See Appendix III)  
Tenofovir Exhibits Modest Dose -Proportionality in Hair with LC -MS/MS Analysis Data from Liu et al 
(88; Figure 5 ) determined that a log- linear r elationship can be seen between TFV dose and hair 
concentrations, with an estimated 76% (95% CI 60- 93%) increase in hair level per 2- fold dose increase. 
However, the between- patient variability is large. Assuming this relationship holds for other ARVs, thi s 
precludes the use of LC -MS/MS methods in determining, with precision, <3 fold differences in weekly 
drug dosing. Our preliminary data with IR MALDESI MSI suggest that we may be able to reduce variability 
and increase the power to detect differences betwe en dose frequencies.  
18 
 Tenofovir, Emtricitabine, Maraviroc and Dolutegravir Can Be Visualized by IR -MALDESI MSI Our 
preliminary data in Aim 1 demonstrate our ability to detect ARVs in hair with a linear response. We 
propose to conduct three dose- proportional ity investigations utilizing these ARVs representing distinct 
physicochemical properties across 3 drug classes. These investigations are described in detail below, and will be based on directly observed dosing.  
Experience with Healthy Volunteer Studies and Observed Dosing We have extensive experience in 
conducting ARV pharmacokinetic investigations in healthy volunteers, and have over 5 years of experience investigating the pharmacokinetics of these ARVs in parti cular (3,25,37,63,113).  We also 
have experience with enrolling and retaining healthy volunteers in observed dosing studies: our participation in HPTN066 successfully enrolled and followed 19 (60% of total enrolled) patients with the following dosing strategies for the fixed dose combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) + FTC: 1 tablet weekly, 1 tablet twice weekly, 2 tablets twice weekly, and 1 tablet daily for 35 days ( 68). 
Multi -compartment Pharmacokinetics and Dose Proportionality Investigation s In this aim, we will 
conduct population PK modeling of IR MALDESI MSI data in hair with multiple dosing strategies using a 
multi -compartmental approach (plasma, PBMCs [for intracellular TFVdp and  
FTCtp], and hair). We have significant experience modeling complex systems. Recently, we have 
developed models to predict ARV active metabolite exposure, based on  
dose, in mucosal tissues ( 174,35; Figure 6 ). This model was based on dose proportionality investigations 
we recently completed for TFV, TFVdp, FTC, FTCtp, and MRV in plasma, PBMCs, and tissues (35-
35c,174).  Finally, the Kashuba laboratory is participating in HPTN 069 (NEXT -PrEP, [Novel Exploration of 
Therapeutics (NEXT) for Pre- Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)]), performed to evaluate the safety and 
accept ability of 4 different drug combinations of TFV, FTC, and MRV when used as PrEP by men who 
have sex with men and women. 600 participants > 18years are being enrolled to one of 4 arms and will 
be required to take 3 pills (active + placebo) for 1 year. A num ber of substudies are planned, including an 
analysis of  ARVs in hair, provided by the UCSF Hair Analytical Laboratory and led by Dr. Monica Gandhi. 
To date, 145 men and 126 women have had hair samples (~200 strands/collection) collected at weeks 24 
and 48 of the study ( personal communication, Dr. Roy Gulick, Protocol Chair, March 18 2015). We have 
been approved by the HPTN leadership and Dr. Gandhi ( see attached memorandum from Drs. El -Sadr 
and Cohen, and letter of support from Dr. Gandhi ) to analyze hair s trands from these Participants . The 
Hair Analysis Laboratory has recently developed a method to measure TFV+FTC+ MRV in hair resulting 
in more than adequate numbers of hair strands available for IR -MALDESI MSI.  
 
 
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN  
 
2.1 Identification of Study Design  
 This will be a single center open- label 3 -arm pharmacokinetic study of the hair and blood  concentrations 
of four antiretrovirals, measured after a single dose and multiple doses .  Each phase is divided into three 
dosing groups , with twelve participants  per dosing group.  In Phase 1, a single dose of study product will 
be administered on Day 0, and then samples will be collected over a 28- day post -dose period.  In Phase 
2, participants  will take the same study product once dai ly for 28 days straight, with samples of plasma 
and hair collected at set intervals over that subsequent month.  Participants  will immediately follow into 
Phase 3, where they will be randomized to one of 3 dosing schemas including: no further doses, a sing le 
dose once weekly, and three doses per week.   
Participants  will return to the clinical research center during all 3 phases, on days 3/7/14/21/28 post -dose 
to provide blood and hair samples.  Vital signs and safety laboratory assessments will be obtained as 
19 
 noted in the schedule of events.  Adverse events will be assessed at every visit, with the participants  
encouraged to contact study staff at any time as needed.  
The participants will be sequentially assigned to one of three dosing groups: Maraviroc, 
Tenofovir/Emtricitabine, and then Dolutegravir .  After participant education, informed consent, and 
screening for study eligibility, participants will be evaluated at baseline (before the dose).  
Within 2 weeks of the final study sampling, all p articipants  will return to the clinic for a final safety visit and 
assessment.   
2.2 Study Sampling  
 
The following samples will be collected during all three phases , in all study arms , on Days 3, 7, 14, 21, 
and 28 days  post dose:  
• Blood (Plasma, ULPC,  and Dried Blood Spot s) 
• Hair 
• PBMCs (In the Tenofovir arm ONLY)  
 2.3 Study Experience  
The UNC Chapel Hill Center for AIDS Research has considerable prior experience with the conduct of 
intens ive blood and hair sampling studies. Most recently, in the study generated during AIM 1 of this 
grant, the study team obtained 84 hair samples from cli nic patients within 9 months. These were 
performed successfully and there were no adverse eve nts or unanticipated problems. As part of the 
screening and informed consent process, every participant will receive a detailed description of the procedures involved and the intensity of the protocol.  
 
2.4 Summary of Major Endpoints  
2.4.1  Primary Endpoints: 
• Plasma, ULPC, and dried blood spot  concentrations of FTC  (and FTC -TP), TFV  (and TFV -DP), 
MRV, and DTG  to generate preliminary P K parameters  
• Hair imaging of FTC (and FTC -TP), TFV (and TFV -DP), MRV, and DTG  to generate preliminary  
parameters  
2.4.2  Secondary Endpoints: 
• Blood plasma concentrations of FTC, TFV, MRV, and DTG

3. STUDY POPULATION  
 
This study will consist of 36 healthy volunteers of any race or gender between the ages of 18- 70.     
Participants will be selected for the study according to the criteria described in this protocol .   
 
3.1 Selection of the Study Population  
 
3.1.1 Recruitment  
 
Our study Participants  will be recruited from the Chapel Hill -Raleigh- Durham area (an area with a 
population of approximately 3 million).  We will use the following recruitment strategies:   
• Placing IRB approved advertisements in the university -based (Daily Tar Heel) and two local 
newspapers (Chapel Hill News, and Daily News and Observer)  
• Posting IRB approved flyers around the UNC -CH campus  
• Sending IRB approved emails to the UNC -CH campus listserv 
• Posting IRB -approved text to ResearchMatch.org  
• Contact a list of Participants  who have expressed interest in any of our previous healthy volunteer 
studies  
Potential Participants  are given an email address or a phone number to call if they are interested, and the 
study coordinator conducts a brief initial IRB -approved screening interview over the phone in a private 
area to determine further eligibility.  If the subject is potentially eligible, a screening visit is scheduled; if 
one or more of the basic inclusion criteria are not met, the subject is informed that they are not eligible.  
 
3.1.2 Subject Withdrawal  
 
There is a low chance of participant w ithdraw from the study.  However, if a subject does withdraw before 
completion of at least four of the five sampling visits per phase, it will be necessary to replace the subject 
21 
 in order to have a complete set of data.

investigational drug within 3 months preceding the first dose of trial medication or have participated in a clinical trial involving hair samples within 3 months precedi ng the first dose of trial medication.   No 
participants may co- enroll in other studies that collect hair samples while enrolled here, nor may they 
enroll in any other study that would exceed the NIH recommended 8 week blood draw limit of 550mL.   
 
4. STUDY TREATMENT/PRODUCT/ INTERVENTION  
4.1 Study Product (s) Description  
Maraviroc 300mg tablets (commercially available) / “Medication A”  
Dolutegravir 50mg tablets (commercially available)  / “Medication B”  
Tenofovir /Emtricitabine 300mg/200mg (commercially available)  “Medication C”  
 
4.2 Administration   
 Participants  will remain on the same assigned study product throughout all phases of the study.  Drugs 
will be coded as Medication A, B or C, to increase patient confidentiality, as per our standard practices with Investigational Drug Services. All participants  will know the medication they are receiving, but we will 
23 
 label the bottle with Medication A, B, or C to protect their confidentiality.  They will take their first dose in 
the clinical research center on Day 0 of Phase 1, observed and monitored by study staff.  All p articipants  
will be closely monitored post -dose, and wil l be followed for sampling over  the subsequent month.  Phase 
2 will require daily observed dosing at approximately the same time window during each 24 hour period 
(ideally within the same 6 hour window each day) .  The exact time of the doses will be recorded on the 
study records and will include the signatures of the witnesses.  Participants  will be randomized to their 
dose frequency for Phase 3.  All doses will still be observed by study staff with close observation of study participants.  
 4.3 Supply and Accountability   
The medications will be provided by the Investigational Drug Service at UNC Hospitals.  Prescriptions for 
study product will be ordered electronically via the UNC Chapel Hill electronical medical records system, 
with paper copies of prescriptions as back up.  All prescriptions will be filled for one week increments at a 
time.  All participants will be given a 2- dose take- home supply of their assigned study product for 
emergency  purposes during Phases 2 and 3.  Situations in which the emergency supply may be utilized 
would be in the case of severe weather or other emergencies that would prevent a participant from 
traveling to the clinic. Attempts will be made to witness dosing in these extreme circumstances via 
telephone or internet video chat.  Only a max of 3 doses during Phase 2, and two doses in Phase 3 can 
be unwitnessed and have the patient still be evaluable. At the end of each Phase, the emergency supply 
will be collected and returned to IDS.   Once all study dosing has been completed, remaining drug will be 
disposed of per standard institutional procedures.  
 4.4 Directly Observed Therapy  
 Drug adherence is an essential component of this study design.  DOT is defined as directly observed therapy. A person identified by the research site must observe and document the doses of study products 
taken by the study participant.  Participants randomi zed to all arms will have all doses (as per randomized 
study arm) observed and documented.  The method by which DOT is to occur should be discussed at 
length with the participant at study screening. Participants and coordinators will formulate a well -
descr ibed plan for DOT prior to entry.  
Study product can be picked up on behalf of the study subject from the Investigational Drug Pharmacy 
from any coordinator , study physician or other designated study staff at the enrollment visit and as 
indicated throughout  the three phases.  The prescription will be cross -checked with the dosing scheme 
prior to dispensing by at least two people, such as study phy sicians, mid- level providers, coordinator  or 
research center nurses and staff.  
• For Phase 1 Dosing, participants w ill be sequentially assigned to receive one of the study 
products.  On the morning of enrollment, study staff will obtain a single dose dispensed from the 
UNC Investigational Drug Services (IDS).  Study product will be dispensed in clinic , and 
witnessed in person by study staff.  
• For Phase 2 and 3 d osing, all participants will receive 28 straight days of dosing, which will 
include dosing on some days on which study samples will not be collected.  Study product will 
remain the same as in Phas e 1, and will be dispensed by IDS.  Doses can be observed in many 
preselected locations, by any approved study staff member.  Study -related staff including: 
physicians, mid- level providers, research coordinators, research assistants, nurses, residents or 
fellows, social workers, community health promoters, mobile health unit staff, pharmacists, 
interns, and volunteers.  All study staff will have completed HSP, GCP and HIPAA training per 
24 
 unit SOPs.  Campus locations may include the hospital pharmacy, medical  clinics, research 
centers, or other pre- selected hospital locations.   Off campus locations may include the 
participant’s place of residence or business, community research or health centers, health 
departments, public libraries, mobile health units, internet based video chat, or pre- selected other 
public locations.   
• Participant identification will be a top priority for all visits.  Upon presentation to the research 
clinic, in a HIPAA controlled area, the participant will verify personal health informatio n to verify 
their identity, such as full name and date of birth.  For any out of clinic dosing visits, the patient will give their HIPAA code word, instead of PHI, to the study staff member prior to dosing.  The dosing HIPAA code word will be selected at t he screening visit.  
 4.5 Toxicity Management  
 
Participants will be dosing in the UNC Clinical and Translational Research Center where study staff will be able to monitor for and immediately address allergic reactions or anaphylaxis. Laboratory tests will be 
taken before study drug administration to look for baseline abnormalities and these will be compared to 
the laboratory tests to be taken at the follow -up visit after study drug exposure.  Any side effects will be 
managed symptomatically on a case -by-case  basis. Participants  will be asked to contact study staff if an y 
adverse effects occur and to seek medical attention as they see appropriate.  Additional study visits or 
safety assessments may be needed to evaluate toxicity, as deemed appropriate by the study medical 
team.

6. SAFETY MONITORING AND ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
6.1 Clinical Data and Safety Review   
A multi- tiered safety review process will be followed for the duration of this study.  The study site 
investigators are the first layer of this tiered system and are responsible for the initial evaluation and 
reporting of safety information at the participant level, and for alerting the Protocol Safety Review Team 
(PSRT ) if unexpected concerns arise.   The PSRT will consist of the following study site investigators: 
Angela Kashuba, PharmD (Principle Investigator), Cindy Gay, MD (Study Physician), Heather Prince, PA -
C (Study Physician’s Assistant), Amanda Poliseno (Research Coordinator) along with the Biostatistician.  
During the trial, the PSRT will review safety reports ( all AEs included, independent of determination of 
relatedness to study products)  and conduct calls to review the data as appropriate.  The content, format 
and frequency of the safety reports will be agreed upon by the PSRT in advance of study implementation. 
In addition to these routine safety data reviews, the PSRT will convene on an ad hoc basis to make 
decisions regarding the handling of any significant safety concerns. If necessary, ex perts external to the 
protocol team,  representing expertise in the fields of microbicides, biostatistics, and medical ethics may be 
invited to join the PSRT safety review.  
30 
 6.2 Adverse Events Definitions and Reporting Requirements   
An adverse event is defi ned as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical research participant 
administered an investigational product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the 
investigational product.  As such, an AE can be an unfavorable or unintende d sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the product.  This definition is applied to all the 
study groups, and is applied to all groups beginning from the time of sequential assignment . The term 
“investigational product” for this study refers to all study products listed in this protocol . Study participants 
will be instructed to contact the study site staff to report any AEs they may experience at any time between 
screening  and follow -up.  In the case of a life- threatening event, they will be instructed to seek immediate 
emergency care. Where feasible and medically appropriate, participants will be encouraged to seek evaluation where the study clinician is based, and to request that the clinician be contacted upon their arrival. Sites will obtain written permission from the participant to obtain and use records from non- study 
medical providers to complete any missing data element on a CRF related to an adverse event.  All 
participants reporting an untoward medical occurrence will be followed clinically, until the occurrence resolves (returns to baseline) or stabilizes.  
The site physicians will determine AE resolution or stabilization in their best clinical judgment, but may seek 
PSRT medical consultation regarding follow -up or additional evaluations of an AE.  Study site staff will 
document in source documents all AEs reported by or observed in enrolled study participants regardless 
of severity and presumed relationship to study product. Study staff also will record all AEs on case report forms.  
 6.3 Serious  Adverse Events  
 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be defined by the Manual for Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events 
to DAIDS (Version 2. 1, dated March 2017) as AEs occurring at any dose that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect    
• Requires inpatient hospit alization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
 
The following are examples of hospitalization that will not be considered 
to be AEs:  
  
• Protocol -specified admission (e.g. for procedure required by 
study protocol)  
• Admission for treatment of target disease of the study, or for pre-existing condition (unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospital admissions as judged by the c linical 
investigator)  
• Diagnostic admission (e.g. for a work -up of an existing condition 
such as persistent pretreatment lab abnormality)  
• Administrative admission (e.g. for annual physical)  
31 
 • Social admission (e.g. placement for lack of place to sleep)  
• Elective admission (e.g. for elective surgery)  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require hospitalization may 
be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above.   
Study staff will report all AEs that meet serious adverse event (SAE) reporting requirements according to 
the DAIDS -defined “standard” reporting requirements.  Information on all AEs will be included in reports to 
the US FDA, and other applicable government and regulatory authorities.  Study staff will report information on all AEs and SAEs to the IRB in accordance with all app licable regulations and 
requirements.   
6.4 Adverse Event Relationship to Study Product   
The relationship of all AEs to study product will be assessed per the Manual for Expedited Reporting of 
Adverse Events to DAIDS (Version 2. 1, dated March 2017). Per t he Manual for Expedited Reporting of 
Adverse Events to DAIDS (Version 2.1, dated March 2017), the relationship categories that will be used for 
this study are:  
 
Related: There is a reasonable possibility that the AE may be related to the study agent(s)  Not related: There is not a reasonable possibility that the AE is  related to the study agent(s)  
 
6.5 Grading Severity of Events  
 
The Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 1.0, December 2004 (Clarification  dated August 2009), Addenda 1 and 3 (Female Genital and Rectal Grading Tables for Use in Microbicide Studies) will be the primary tools for grading adverse events for this protocol.  Adverse events not included in those tables will be graded by the DAIDS AE Grading Table Version 1.0, December 2004 (Clarification dated August 2009). In cases where an AE is covered in all tables, the DAIDS 
AE Grading Table, Version 1.0, December 2004 (Clarification dated August 2009), Addendum 1 (Vaginal 
Gradi ng Table for Use in Microbicide Studies) ,and Addendum 3 (Rectal Grading Table for Use in 
Microbicide Studies) will be the grading scale utilized.  
6.6 Pregnancy and Pregnancy Outcomes   
Pregnancy -related data will be collected using the pregnancy CRFs for all pregnancies detected during the 
study.  Pregnancy outcomes will not be expeditiously reported to DAIDS,  unless there is an associated 
adverse event in the pregnant participant that meets expedited reporting criteria or the pregnancy results 
in a congen ital anomaly meeting the Manual for Expedited Reported of Adverse Events to DAIDS (Version 
2.1, March 2017) guidelines for expedited reporting.  Fetal losses without congenital anomalies or maternal 
complications that require expedited reporting will not be expeditiously reported but data will be captured via the pregnancy CRFs.    
After the participant’s follow -up study visit, the study team will make every attempt to follow the participant 
32 
 until an outcome of the pregnancy can be ascertained to allow reporting of these outcomes meeting EAE 
criteria.  P regnancy outcomes that meet criteria for EAE reporting as described above (e.g., maternal 
complications, congenital anomalies) occurring among participants known to be pregnant at the Final Study Visit wi ll continue to be expeditiously reported.  
 6.7 Social Harms Reporting   
 
Although study sites make every effort to protect participant privacy and confidentiality, it is possible that 
participants' involvement in the study could become known to others, and that social harms may result .  For 
example, participants could be treated unfairly or discriminated against, or could have problems being 
accepted by their families and/or communities. Social harms that are judged by the Investigator of Record to be serio us or unexpected will be reported to the responsible site IRB at least annually, or according to 
their individual requirements. In the event that a participant reports social harm, every effort will be made 
by study staff to provide appropriate care and counseling to the participant, and/or referral to appropriate 
resources for the safety of the participant as needed.  While maintaining participant confidentiality, study sites may engage their CABs in exploring the social context surrounding instances of social harm.  
 
7. CLINICAL MANAGEMENT  
In general, the site investigator has the discretion to discontinue study product at any time if she feels that 
continued product use would be harmful to the participant or interfere with treatment deemed clinically necessary.  Unless otherwise specified below, the investigator should immediately consult the PSRT for further guidance regarding permanent discontinuation.  
The site investigator or designee will document all discontinuations on applicable case report forms.  
7.1 Dose Modification Instructions  
Study doses will not be modified on this protocol.  
7.2 Discontinuation of Study Product(s) in the Presence of Toxicity  
 
Stopping rules have been created to protect the health and safety of study participants.  If a single subject 
experiences a Serious Adverse Event, enrollment will be held while the protocol undergoes review.  If 2 or 
more participants  experience Grade 3 or Grade 4 adverse events, enrollment will be held while the 
protocol undergoes  review.  If 5 or more p articipants  experience Ser ious Adverse Events or Grade 
3/Grade 4 adverse events deemed by the study physician to be related to the drug under study, the study 
will be stopped while the safety concerns of using these variable doses o f study medication are reviewed.  
Any Grade 3 or 4 or serious adverse event related to a study intervention (blood draw, biopsy) or the 
study drugs (tenofovir, maraviroc, emtricitabine, Dolutegravir ) will result in subject discontinuation. 
Participants  who are withdrawn for safety reasons will complete a follow -up visit within 14  days of 
discontinuation.  
7.3 Pregnancy  
Pregnant and lactating women are excluded from this study.  Routine serum pregnancy testing is being 
performed at the screening visit and r outine urine testing is being performed at every study visit  and prior 
to the administration of study medication. If a participant becomes  pregnant at any time during the course 
33 
 of the study, the participant will remain in the study and will continue with follow -up visits and safety lab 
assessments.   
Pregnancy -related data will be collected using the pregnancy CRFs for all pregnancies detected during the 
study. The study team will make a very strong attempt to maintain contact with the pregnant participant until 
the outcome of the pregnancy is determined or it becomes clear that it will be impossible to obtain outcome 
information.  The protocol team will prepare and provide to DAIDS  a quarterly repor t on all pregnancies and 
their outcomes.  
 
7.4 Criteria for Early Termination of Study Participation  
Participants may voluntarily withdraw from the study for any reason at any time.  The site investigator also 
may withdraw participants from the study to pr otect their safety and/or if they are unwilling or unable to 
comply with required study procedures, after consultation with the PSRT. Participants also may be 
withdrawn if the study sponsors, government or regulatory authorities (including the Office of Human 
Research Protections), or site IRBs terminate the study prior to its planned end date.  Every reasonable 
effort is made to complete a final evaluation of participants who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study 
prior to completing follow -up.  Study st aff members will record the reason(s) for all withdrawals in 
participants’ study records.  In the event that participants  who voluntarily withdraw from the study wish to 
re-join the study, they may resume product use (if applicable) and follow -up through t heir originally 
scheduled study exit date.  
 
8. DATA MANAGEMENT AND RECORDKEEPING  
8.1 Data Management Responsibilities  
The study site will maintain source data/documents in accordance with Requirements for Source 
Documentation in DAIDS Funded and/or Sponsored Clinical Trials 
(http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/LabsAndResources/resources/DAIDSClinRsrch/PDF/Source DocPolicy.pdf ).  
The investigator will maintain, and store securely, comp lete, accurate and current study records throughout 
the study. The investigator will retain all study records for at least  three years following the completion of 
the study, unless directed otherwise by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Study records must be 
maintained on site for the entire period of study implementation.  
8.2 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
The study site will conduct quality control and quality assurance procedures in accordance with 
Requirements for Clinical Quality Management Plans at DAIDS Funded and/or Supported Clinical Research Sites available at: 
(http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/resources/DAIDSClinRsrch/PDF/QMPPolicy.pdf
).  
8.3 Study Coordination  
34 
 All procedures, documentation, subject contact, data management, clinical monitoring, personnel training 
and regulatory requirements will be performed in accordance to policies governed by the University of North Carolina Clinical Pharmacology and Analytic al Chemistry Laboratory . These  policies are located in 
department SOPs . 
 
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
The Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) Biostatistics Core is collaborating with us for our statistical plan on 
this grant.  
 9.1 Statistical Analysis Plan   
 
Linear mixed models with random intercepts will be used for multivariable analyses of predictors of hair 
MSI output. Inter - and intra- subject variability will be determined from these models. Dose proportionality 
will be assessed by employing a power model of the form 
{} ) log( ) log(1 0 dose y E ββ+= , where 𝑦𝑦 
denotes drug (ARV) concentration and 11β=corresponds to perfect dose proportionality. The power 
model will be fit and the 90% confidence interval (CI) for 1β will be compared to a pre- specified critical 
region. If the CI falls within this critical region, then the data support dose proportionality. This critical 
region is 


+ +)ln() ln(1,)ln() ln(1r rU Lθ θ where r is the ratio of the highest dose to the lowest dose, 80.0=Lθ , 
and 25.1=Uθ .  
 
9.2 Power and Sample Size Calculation:   
 
Through a series of simulation studies conducted using R -project, it was determined that 12 participants 
per ARV treatment group will be sufficient to achieve > 99% power to establish dose proportionality (i.e., 
assuming 11β=). For these simulation studies, we assumed dose levels ranging from 1 dose per 28 
days to 1 dose per day over the three phases of study, yielding 28r= .  Concentrations where no drug 
is given (0 doses per day)  cannot be used when fitting the power model described above. To account for 
the same individual contributing repeated observations (corresponding to the three 28 day phases of 
observation), a mixed effects power model was used in the empirical power simul ations. Values for the 
between-  and within -individual variability were assumed based on a natural -log transformation of pilot IR -
MALDESI response per voxel data from participants taking efavirenz. The estimated within- individual 
standard deviation [SD] was  0.10 and estimated between- individual SD was 0.52.  
 
9.3 Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan  
Initial data exploration will be utilized to produce descriptive statistics and exploratory plots. Nonlinear 
mixed effects modeling with NONMEM (ICON plc, Ireland) will be used to construct population PK models 
describing the pharmacokinetics of TFV, FTC, MVC, and DTG in plasma, PBMC, and hair (101,102). The 
structural model will consist of a compartment for each matrix, with possible transit compartments from 
plasma to hair. Linearity will initially be assumed yet will be subsequently assessed. If the PK r elationship 
35 
 is found to be nonlinear, saturation terms can be added to the model parameters. Various structural 
models will be explored with Berkley Madonna software (University of California, Berkeley) to generate plausible candidate models (80). The best  model will be chosen depending on the objective function and 
model performance diagnostics such as visual predictive checks. Bayesian analysis (83) using existing published PK models (12, 29,159,162) can also be added to model parameters if necessary for uncertain 
parameters such as drug uptake into hair (5, 38) and clearance. Once the base model is constructed, 
demographic covariates such as weight, BMI, creatinine clearance, age, gender, and race will also be 
tested for significance one at a time. Scient ific input and previous research findings will be used to inform 
selection of a multivariable model. Monte Carlo simulations will be performed with the model to generate prediction intervals to both explore other possible dosing regimens and for adherence assessments in HPTN 069. (Aim 2b) In addition, localized drug concentrations within a hair strand will also be modeled using partial differential equations (e.g., via Matlab). This physiologic -based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) 
modeling approach has previously b een done to characterize localized drug concentrations in tumor. (31, 
42). This will enable a more granular estimation of dosing history from continuous drug concentration 
distribution within a hair strand. Initially, various models will be explored and on e with the most 
physiologic relevance will be fit to the data. Variance will also be added to various parameters to describe 
the data on a population level. Monte- Carlo simulations can be performed to generate prediction intervals 
of drug concentration alo ng the length of the hair under various dosing regimens.
 
  
10. HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTIONS  
The investigators will make efforts to minimize risks to participants. Volunteers and study staff members 
will take part in a thor ough informed consent process. Befor e beginning the study, the investigators will 
have obtained IRB approval . The investigators  will permit audits by the NIH/DAIDS , the FDA or any of their 
appointed agents.  
10.1 Institutional Review Board   
This protocol, along with the informed consent, will be submitted for approv al by the UNC IRB.  Subsequent 
to initial review and approval, the IRB will review the protocol at least annually.  The Investigator will make 
safety and progress reports to the IR B at least annually and within three months of the study termination or 
completion.  These reports will include the total number of participants enrolled in the study, the number of participants who completed the study, all changes in the research activity , and all unanticipated problems 
involving risks to human p articipants  or others.   
10.2 Risks  
• Blood Draws:  Risks associated with blood draws include bleeding, discomfort, feelings of 
dizziness or faintness, and/or bruising, swelling and/or infection.   
 
• Hair Collection: There are no known associated risks with collection of hair.  
 
• STI Screening/Reporting:  Disclosure of STI status may cause sadness or depression in 
volunteers.  Partner notification of STI status may cause problems in their relationships w ith their 
sexual partners. Additionally, participants could misunderstand the current experimental status of 
the study medication and as a result increase their HIV risk behaviors while in the study.  The 
following STIs are required by law to be reported to the NC State Department of Health if positive: 
36 
 HIV, Syphilis, gonorrhea, Chlamydia,  Hepatitis B and C . 
 
• Unknown Risks:  There are always a potential for unknown problems to arise.  Participants will 
be encouraged to contact study staff any time they expec t a problem.   
 
• Confidentiality:  Participation in clinical research includes the risks of loss of confidentiality and 
discomfort with personal nature of questions. Although the study site makes  every effort to protect 
participant privacy and confidentiality, it is possible that participants’ involvement in the study 
could become known to others, and that social harms may result.  
  
 
• Study Medications  
The known toxicities for a single dose of these ant iretrovirals in this protocol .  Listed below are 
the pregnancy categories for the medications.  
 
- Tenofovir:  TDF is a pregnancy category B medication.  No controlled human studies of 
TDF among pregnant women have been conducted.   Animal studies have shown 
decreased fetal growth and reduced fetal bone porosity.  No increased risk of overall birth defects has been observed following first trimester exposure according to data collected by the antiretroviral pregnancy registry (Lexi -Comp).  
 
- Emtricitabine: FTC is a pregnancy category B medication.  No controlled human studies 
of FTC among pregnant women have been conducted.  Adverse events were not 
observed in animal studies and no increased risk of overall birth defects has been observed according to data collected by the antiretroviral pregnancy registry (Lexi -
Comp).  
 
- Dolutegravir : Dolutegravir is a pregnancy category B .  There have been no animal 
studies that have documented fetal risk, and no studies testing Dolutegravir in pregnant women.  
 
- Maraviroc: Maraviroc is a pregnancy category B.  Adverse fetal effects were not seen in 
animal studies, however, there have been no studies testing maraviroc in pregnant women.   
 
10.3 Benefits  
Participants in this study will  experience no direct benefit . Participants and others may benefit in the future 
from information learned from this study.   Additionally, participants will be referred for treatment for any 
incidental findings detected during screening and other examinations.    
10.4 Informed Consent Process   
The investigators will obtain informed consent from each subject before starting any  study procedures 
according to the standards set forth in the ICH Good Clinical Practice guidelines and per unit SOPs. The 
process will including reviewing consent forms with potential p articipants  in a confidential setting and 
explaining all risks and benefits associated with participation of the study. This involves reading over the 
37 
 IRB-approved consent form with the subject in a private space, soliciting questions from the subject, 
allowing the s ubject ample time alone to review the form, soliciting questions again, and then offering the 
subject the opportunity to sign the consent form.  To ensure understanding, study staff may ask questions 
of the participants  regarding study procedures.  The consent forms will use language that is sufficiently 
simple for lay persons to comprehend. Participants  will not be coerced into participating. Children under the 
age of 18 years, decisionally impaired adults and non- English speakers will not be enrolled in t his study.  
Each subject will be provided with a photocopy of all documents that she signs. The informed consent process will cover all elements of informed consent required by research regulations. In addition, the 
process specifically will address the fo llowing topics of import ance to this study:  
• The unknown safety and unproven efficacy of the study products  
• The need to practice safer sex behaviors regardless of study treatment group  
• The importance of participants in all four study groups to the success of the study  
• The importance of adherence to the study visit and procedures schedule  
• The potential medical risks of study participation (and what to do if such risks are experienced)  
• The potential social harms associated with study participation (an d what to do if such harms are 
experienced)  
• The real yet limited benefits of study participation  
• The distinction between research and clinical care  
• The right to withdraw from the study at any time  
 
The informed consent process will include an assessment  of each potential participant’s understanding 
prior to enrollment and sequential assignment of concepts identified by the protocol team as essential to 
the informed consent decision.  Participants who are not able to demonstrate adequate understanding of key concepts after exhaustive educational efforts will not be enrolled in the study.     
10.5 Participant Confidentiality  
Confidentiality will be maintained by storing all specimens for current and future use with a unique identifying number, which will b e linked to the subject’s name, social security number, address, telephone 
number, and hospital medical record (MR) number.  The principal investigators and study staff will be the 
only people with access to the identifying information.  Any information pr ovided to other people working 
on this study will be given with the study ID number, not other identifying information.  The records will be secured in a locked file cabinet in the principal investigator’s office.  
All electronic data for this study will be stored on a dedicated University server which contains extensive 
protections and securities.  
 
10.6 Special Populations  
 Children under the age of 18 years, decisionally impaired adults and non- English speakers will not be 
enrolled in this study.    
 
10.6.1 Pregnant Women  
 Women who test positive for pregnancy at the screening visit or prior to study drug administration,  will not 
be eligible to participate in this study. A serum pregnancy test will be performed at the screening visit and 
urine pregnancy test s at all study  visits, and additionally if clinically indicated .  During the informed consent 
38 
 process, women will be informed that none of the study products are methods of contraception and about  
the current knowledge of effects of these pr oducts on a developing human fetus.    
 
10.6.2 Children  
  
The NIH has mandated that children be included in research trials when appropriate. This study meets “Justifications for Exclusion” criteria for younger children as set forth by the NIH. Specifically, “insufficient data are available in adults to judge pot ential risk in children” and “children should not be the initial group 
to be involved in research studies.” This study does not plan to enroll children under 18 years old.  
10.7 Compensation  
Pending IRB approval, participants will be compensated for their  time and effort in this study.  Stipends 
will be offered which are consistent with industry standards.  UNC Hospitals parking deck tokens will be 
offered to all participants for their time on campus for study appointments.   
 10.8 Communicable Disease Rep orting  
  
Study staff will comply with all applicable local requirements to report communicable diseases including 
HIV identified among study participants to local health authorities. Participants will be made aware of all 
reporting requirements during the study informed consent process  
10.9 Access to HIV -related Care  
Participants found to be HIV -infected will be referred to available sources of medical and psychosocial 
care and support, and local research studies for HIV -infected adults.  
10.10 HIV Counseling and Testing  
HIV test -related counseling will be provided to all potential study participants who consent to undergo HIV 
screening to determine their eligibility for this study, and to all enrolled participants at each follow -up HIV 
testing t ime point. Counseling will be provided in accordance with standard HIV counseling policies and 
methods at the  site and additionally will emphasize the unknown efficacy of the study products in preventing 
HIV infection. In accordance with the policies of the US NIH, participants must receive their HIV test results 
to take part in this study.   
 10.11 Care for Participants Identified as HIV -Infected  
 Participants will be provided with their HIV test results in the context of post -test counseling.  Participants 
found to be HIV -infected will be referred to available sources of medical and psychosocial care and support, 
and local research studies for HIV -infected adults.  
 10.12 Study Discontinuation  
This study may be discontinued at any time by NIAID /DAIDS , the US FDA, the OHRP, or the site IRB.

12.2 Appendix II: HAIR STANDARD OPERATING  PROCEDURES  
 
G. SUPPLIES NEEDED FOR HAIR COLLECTION  
A few basic supplies will be needed to collect and correctly store the hair sample: hair clips, scissors, 
aluminum foil, dessicant bags, and ziplock bags.  
o Aluminum foil can be ordered from Quill Diagnostics . The product is called Handy Foil 
Standard Aluminum Foil , catalogue number 035- 11205: 12 inches x 100 feet, $39.99. 
Alternatively, the foil can be purchased locally, if sites can find a better price. Aluminum 
foil should be cut into squares approximately 5cm x 5cm and folded into quarters.  
o Dessicant bags should be ordered from U -Line. Phone: 1- 800-295-5510; fax: 1- 800-295-
5571. The product is called 1/2 g Silica Gel Desiccants , catalogue number S -8032: 1 pail 
(6000 bags/container), $133.00.  
o Scissors can be purchased locally.  
o Hair clips can be purchased locally.  
o Ziplock bags should be small and can be purchased locally.   
 
 H. HAIR COLLECTION PROCEDURE   
 
1. Clean the blades of a pair of scissors with an alcohol pad and allow blades to completely dry prior to 
use.  
2. Unfold the piece of aluminum foil and have it ready, along with a small label for labeling the hair once cut  
3. Lift up the top layer of hair from th e occipital region of the scalp. A hair clip can be used to keep this 
top layer of hair out of the way. Isolate a small thatch of hair from underneath this top layer of hair 
from the occipital region.  
4. 20-30 fibers of hair at least 1 centimeter long should be isolated and cut.  
5. Cut the small hair sample off the participant’s ahead as close to the scalp as possible.  
6. Lay the small hair sample onto the piece of unfolded aluminum foil and place a small label with the 
participant’s Study ID over the distal end of the hair thatch (affixing the hair sample to the tin foil in the 
process). The distal end is the portion furthest from the scalp. It is very important to place the label at 
the distal end as this will distinguish the scalp end from the distal end.  
7. Refo ld the foil over to completely enclose the thatch of hair.  
8. Place a StudyID label on outside of the folded piece of foil.  
9. Place the folded piece of foil inside a Ziplock bag with a dessicant bag in it and seal the Ziplock bag.  
43 
 10. The pair of scissors used t o collect the hair samples should be cleaned prior to using on each 
participant. Reclean the blades of the scissors with an alcohol pad and allow blades to completely dry 
prior to reuse.  
11. Hair samples should be kept at room temperature and in a dark place prior to pickup.  
                
Each packet of hair is to be folded to approximately 3” x 3” and labeled with the StudyID and visit 
on the upper portion of the packet.

Material Required: Scissors, piece of tin foil, patient labels (2), ziplock bag, alcohol swabs, dessicant 
pellet (optional)  
Suggest making these “hair kits” ahead of time  
   
 
Step 1: Clean the blades of a pair of scissors with an alcohol pad and allow blades to completely dry  
Clean off blades of scissors between patients  
 
Step 2: Lift up the top layer of hair from the occipital region of the scalp. Isolate a small thatch of hair (20‐
30 strands) from underneath this top layer

Step 4: Keep your fingers on the part of the hair that was FURTHEST away from the scalp and put the 
hair sample down on an unfolded piece of tin foil  
 
Step 5: Put a thin label over the end of the hair sample that was FURTHEST away from the scalp  
 Step 6: Refold the foil over to completely enclose the hair and plac e a study ID label on the folded piece 
of foil  
 
Step 7: Place the folded piece of foil inside the plastic (e.g., Ziplock®) bag (dessicant pellet in the bag is 

48 
 optional) and seal the bag; Hair samples should be kept at room temperature and in a dark place at each 
site prior to pickup

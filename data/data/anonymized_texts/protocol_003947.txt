A. SPECIFIC AIMS___________________________________________________________________________  
 
The primary aim of this study is to compare two commonly used anesthetic techniques (propofol and sevoflurane) 
during atrial fibrillation ablation cases.  Of greatest interest is to compare the time to awaken the patients after the 
procedure.  Also of interest is the duration of the ablation procedure.  The hypothesis  of this investigation  is that 
patients who receive propofol will require a longer time to removal of the endotracheal tube after the end of the 
procedure than patients anesthetized with sevoflurane.  
 
B. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE_________________________________________________________  
 
The incidence and prevalence of atrial fibrillation continues to rise in our country. Currently, the incidence is 
predicted to double from 1.2 million cases in 2010 to 2.6 million cases in 2040.  Atrial fibrillation prevalence is 
projected to increase from 5 .2 million in 2010 to 12.1 million in 2030. 1 As the rates of atrial fibrillation  cases 
increase , treatments such as catheter -based ablation will also increase.   
Ablation procedures require the administration of general anesthesia.  A wide variety of general anesthesia 
techniques have been used since the inception of the ablation procedure, but there are few comparative studies 
of anesthetic techniques.  The lack of evidence comparing two widely  used anesthetic techniques means that 
choice of a primary anesthetic is based on personal preference or local custom.  In a recent review of Ablation 
Procedures and Anesthetic implications the authors state: “ The literature regarding the best choice for anesthetic 
technique in ablative procedures is still scarce and the decision ultimately depends on the patient’s clinical 
condition, the anesthesiologist’s judgment, and the electrophysiologist’s comfort level.”2  For this reason a study 
comparing two of the commonly employed techniques is warranted.  
Propofol is a sedative hypnotic agent used as an infusion as a general anesthetic  at a recommended dose of 
between 100 and 200 mcg/kg/min.  In a continuous infusion, the distribution half -life of propofol is 1 to 3 hours in a 
2-compartment model and 30 to 70 minutes in a 3 -compartment model.  The context -sensitive half time for 
infusions of up to 8 hours is 40 minutes. 1 
Propofol produces myocardial depressant effects and decreased systemic vascular resistance; these are both 
dose and concentration dependent.  Propofol has also been found to alter the baroreflex mechanism, which 
causes a smaller increase in heart rate for a given decrease in blood pressure.  
Propofol is commonly used as a general anesthetic agent for many different types of surgical procedures, 
including atrial fibrillation ablations.  Propofol is used as a general anesthetic for cardiac ablation procedures 
because it has no known effects on the cardiac conduction system.  Medical University of South Carolina

Sevoflurane is a volatile anesthetic, which is administered via inhalation.  A concentration of 2% is typically used 
as a general anesthetic dose of sevoflurane.  Sevoflurane undergoes very little metabolism by the body, rather 
once the vaporizer is turned off and the patient breathes off the gas, the anesthetic effects are gone.  Like other 
inhaled anesthetics, sevoflurane is very rapid acting.  This ability to quickly increase or decrease anesthetic levels 
as necessary aids in efficiency and also increases the margin of error for this drug.  
Sevoflurane, and other volatile anesthetics, are the most commonly used general anesthetic agents in use today , 
both for their confirmed safety profile and also the ease of titrating the drugs.  Sevoflurane is used in some 
centers  for ablation procedures.  Our institution has also used Sevoflurane for atrial fibrillation ablations in the past 
when there has been a shortage of propofol.  
At our institution a total intravenous anesthetic (TIVA) with propofol is used during atrial fibrillation ablation cases.   
Sevoflurane is used at other centers , such as UCLA .  Due to sevoflurane’s shorter half life and the fact that it is 
not metabolized as much as propofol by the body, patients may have the breathing tube removed in a shorter 
period of time after the procedure is over and also be more awake and alert in the recovery room than if they had 
undergone the procedure using propofol as the primary anesthetic.  Propofol has been shown to have no effect on 
cardiac conduction4 and preliminary evidence shows that sevoflurane may similarly have no effect .3  Because 
shorter wake -up time could reduce hospital costs and improve efficiency, it is important to compare these two 
techniques focusing on time for extubation.   
There have been no head to head comparisons of total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA)  versus sevoflurane for 
ablation procedures.  By conducting a randomized blinded study of these two anesthetics , new and important 
knowledge can be generated for this increasingly commonly performed procedure .   
A side effect of other  volatile anesthetics , such as isoflurane and desflurane , is enhanced automaticity , accounting 
for secondary atrial pacemakers . 5  Volatile anesthetics also have varying effects on the AV node and His -Pukinje 
system .6  These agents also prolong the QT interval6  and, f or this reason , volatile anesthetics  as a group  have at 
times been avoided for atrial fibrillation ablation.  However, sevoflurane does not seem to have the effects shown 
for other volatile anesthetics on cardiac conduction , based on preliminary evidence .3  Sharpe, et al suggested with 
results from a 15 patient study that Sevoflurane had no effect on the refractoriness of the normal or accessory 
atrioventricular pathway and also no clinically significant effects on sinoatrial node function or intraatrial 
conduction.3  Though the aforementioned study’s population  consisted of  patients with Wolff -Parkinson -White 
(WPW) syndrome, the concerns with how the anesthetic drugs  affect the conduct ion system are the same with 
WPW as they are for atrial fibrillation cases.   Some institutions , such as UCLA,  now use sevoflurane as the 
primary anesthetic for atrial fibrillation ablation cases.   
This study,  a partnership between anesthesia and electrophysiology cardiologists, will be the first study to 
compare these two commonly used anesthetic techniques.  The primary end -point of this study is the time interval 
from the end of the procedure to tracheal extubation.  We will also measure  the length of procedure , any 
differences in hemodynamics,  patient alertness  in the immediate postoperative period, as well  as the rate of 
postoperative nausea and  vomiting to see if there is a difference between the two anesthetics.  At 3 month and 6 
months , medical records will be examined  to see if there is any difference in the recurrence of atrial fibrillation.   
Although our study is not powered for this, we will examine for this due to the theoretical risk of recurrence with 
Sevoflurane.  
The significance of this study is that it will be the first study to compare two commonl y used anesthe tic techniques 
in the setting of atrial fibrillation ablation.  There is currently no comparative evidence available to determine which 
technique is superior in this setting and as a result clinical practice is based on custom and familiarity rather than 
evidence of superiority.   
 
C. PRELIMINARY STUDIES___________________________________________________________________  
There have not been any blinded randomized studies comparing volatile anesthetics to TIVA for atrial fibrillation 
ablations.  By performing this study, we can demonstrate if one anesthetic is superior to another for time of 
extubation and note any other differences in measured variables including  the patient’s satisfaction in the 
immediate post - operative period.   
 
D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS (including data analysis) __________________________________  
 
Version 4_6-28-23   3 of  7 
Patients with persistent and paroxysmal  atrial fibrillation, undergoing their first ablation, will be  invited  to 
participate in the study during their pre-operative visit if the patient is scheduled for one, but otherwise during their 
pre-operative anesthesia work up in the holding room. Once informed consent is obtained , the participant will be 
randomized via computer -generated randomization  into one of two groups.  Group A will receive propofol  100-
150mcg/kg/min ; Group B will receive sevoflurane  2% end tidal concentration  as their primary, general anesthetic 
for the procedure.   Doses of each drug will be titrated to effect in order to obtain general anesthesia.   The 
electrophysiologist performing the procedure will be blinded as to which drug the patient is receiving.  Data will be 
collected from the patient’s electronic medical record  postoperatively .  Our primary endpoint is time from 
procedure end until the time that the endotracheal tube  is removed (wake -up time .)  Data will be analyzed using 
an independent 2 -sample t -test.   
 
We will also measure and compare  duration of the procedure,  postoperative nausea and vomiting, hemodynamic 
differences during the case, and patient alertness postoperatively  using a short questionnaire to be filled out on 
the morning of POD 1 by a trained study team  member .  Following their first clinic visit with their cardiologist  and 
for a total of 6 months postoperatively , we will view their medical record to look for recurrence of atrial fibrillation .   
 
 
Analysis plan, sample size and power:  
 
The primary outcomes are procedure duration and time to extubation.   Both outcomes will be analyzed using an 
independent 2 -sample t -test.   
Propofol infusion is the most common primary anesthetic at MUSC for patients undergoing cardiac ablation for 
atrial fibrillation.   The primary  outcome  is time from procedure end to extubation between the two groups that will 
be compared using a two -sample t -test approach.   Sixty -three  patients per group (126 total) provides 80% 
detect ion an effect size of 0.5 between the two groups using a two -sided t -test at significance level α = 0.05.  The 
statistical assumptions will be checked graphically and the non -parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used if 
assumptions are violated.

a.  Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics  
 
To account for a 6% attrition rate, w e plan to enr oll 134 participants who are ages  18 and over  and have 
paroxysmal  atrial fibrillation undergoing their first ablation.

*The “Ethnic Category: Total of All Subjects” must be equal to the”Racial Categories: Total of All Subjects”.  
All eligible participants who volunteer for the study will be enrolled regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity.  It is 
difficult to estimate the proportion of gender or ethnicity representation in the study population as this is 
Version 4_6-28-23   4 of  7 
predetermined by the surgical schedule, but every effort will be made to enroll participants from both genders and 
a variety of racial/ethnic backgrounds. The only reason for exclusion based on ethnic category is the inability to 
speak English. Our interpretters’ services are limited in time and availability.  
 
b.  Sources of Materials  
 
Once informed consent is obtained , the participant will be randomized via computer -generated randomization into 
one of two groups.  Group A will receive propofol as their primary, general anesthetic for the procedure and Group 
B will received  sevoflurane as their primary, general anesthetic for the procedure.   
 
The following data will be obtained from the participant’s electronic medical record: overall length of procedure, 
time from procedure end to extubation, side effects (nausea, vomiting, hemodynamic differences during the case ) 
and patient alertness .   
 
Upon enrollment, subjects will be assigned a randomized numerical identifier for the remainder of the study.  This 
number will be used to label charts and paperwork associated with the subject.  An electronic enrollment log will 
link patient name and MRN with his/her study ID number.  All paper information will be kept in a locked cabinet in 
a locked office.  All electronic data will be kept on MUSC's password protected server.  
 
c.  Potential Risks  
 
The two anesthetics that could be given are both commonly used and investigators are familiar with both . Side 
effects of each drug are typically only seen when the medications are given, or in the immediate postoperative 
period.   However, the risk associated with each medication is as follows:  
Propofol Risks:   
Less Than 5%:  
Slower heart rate    Decrease in muscle tone                  Muscle pain 
Breathing difficulty    Temporary loss of feeling/sensation    
Allergic reaction     Increased saliva  
Fainting      Rash 
Changes in heart rhythm   Cloudy urine   
Transient d ecrease in vision  in the immediate postoperative period  
Less Than 20%:  
Burning or stinging at IV site  
Low blood pressure  
Sevoflurane Risks:  
Less Than 5%:  
Low blood pressure     Slower heart rate  
Tightening of airway     Holding breath  
Increased in saliva  
Version 4_6-28-23   5 of  7 
Less Than 20%:  
Agitation    Cough  
 
 
Although both medications may cause patients to stop breathing, this is not a concern in these procedures as 
patients have a breathing tube inserted and are on a ventilator for the duration of the procedure when the drugs 
are being administered.  
 
The risk of decreased efficacy of the ablation procedure is theoretical, however if one medication would cause the 
ablation to be less efficacious, a repeat ablation may be necessary.  
 
There is a risk of loss of confidentiality, as we will be accessing the medical records of patients.  However, all 
paper information will be kept in a locked cabinet in a locked research office and all electronic data will be kept on 
MUSC’s password protected server.  The research team will decrease this risk as much as possible by following 
confidentiality standards.  
 
Randomization risk: Participants will be assigned to a general anesthetic medication by chance. The anesthetic 
that is in turn given, may prove to be less effective or to have more side effects than the other study medication.  
 
2.  ADEQUACY OF PROTECTION AGAINST RISKS  
 
a.  Recruitment and Informed Consent  
 
Inclusion Criteria:   All patients who are 18 years of age  or older , have persistent and paradoxical atrial fibrillation, 
and are undergoing their first ablation will be invited to participate in the study during their pre -operative 
anesthesia work up in the holding room.    
 
Exclusion Criteria: Patients will not be eligible for the study if they are unable to speak English or if the patient is 
cognitively incapable of providing their understanding of and consent for the study.  
 
Patients who have contraindications to either study drug, such as an allergy or history of malignant hyperthermia, 
will also be excluded from the study.  
 
Once the patient agrees to  enroll in the study he or she will be asked to sign a written informed consent .  An 
anesthesia study team member will obtain the consent . The participant will be given time to read the consent and 
have any questions answered about their procedure and the study.  
 
b.  Protection against Risk  
 
All participants  will be monitored during the procedure per MUSC’s policy.  
 
All paper information will be kept in a locked cabinet in a locked office.  All electronic data will be kept on MUSC's 
password protected server.  
 
3.  POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH TO THE SUBJECTS AND OTHERS  
 
The participant may or may not benefit from the study procedures. The knowledge gained from this study could 
help future patient’s undergoing this procedure have the best anesthesia treatment.  
 
4.  IMPORTANCE OF THE KNOWLEDGE TO BE GAINED  
 
The study may demonstrate whether one anesthetic provides any benefit over another for this relatively long 
procedure.  If the study shows no difference, or the superiority of sevoflurane, patient outcome and overall cost 
may decrease.   This is the first comparative study of these two techniques and will provide anesthesiologists with 
evidence regarding the choice for one or the other.  
 
5.  SUBJECT SAFETY AND MINIMIZING RISKS (Data and Safety Monitoring Plan)  
 
Version 4_6-28-23   6 of  7 
Data and safety monitoring will be performed by the research study committee in the Department of Anesthesia 
and Perioperative Medicine on a  annual  basis.  The committee is comprised of  an MUSC Professor of 
Anesthesia  (Dr. Orin Guidry) , an emuritus dean of medicine  (Dr. Gerald  Reves) , Professor Kenneth Catchpole & a 
Research Instructor Kent Armeson .  Any adverse effect on the time of the ablation will also be closely assessed 
during DSMB meetings.   The study will not go on if there has been prolongation of this procedure that is believed 
to be study related. Furthermore, if there are any identified study related complications, participants will be 
switched to receive standard treatment for the duration of the case. Though adverse events are not anticipated , 
any adverse events will be reported to the DSMB committee in real time  for evaluation , as well as to MUSC's IRB , 
per protocol.  Of note, these adverse events are no different than what could be seen clinically.   The possibility of 
decreased ablation efficacy via the use of sevoflurane is purely theoretical.

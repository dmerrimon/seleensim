Page 8of 18530 mg nemolizumab (with 60 mg loading dose at baseline) or placebo every 4 
weeks (Q4W) . Subjects w eighing ≥90kg at baseline will receive either 60 mg 
nemolizumab or placebo Q4W (no loading dose at baseline ).
Subjects’ participation in the study will be up to 36 weeks. The study consists of 
a screening period (up to 4 w eeks) , a 24- week tre atment period ,and an 8 -week 
follow  up period (12 w eeks after their last study drug injection). Refer to
Figure 1for an overvie w of study design.
Follow ing provision of w ritten informed consent, subjects with PN will be 
screened for enrolment in the study. Eligible subjects will return for a baseline 
visit where, following randomization, they will be administered either a dose of 
60 mg nemolizumab or placebo via 2 subcutaneous ( SC) injections. Thereafter, 
study drug will be administered Q4W at Week 4 ,8, 12 , 16 and 20 by either a 
single SCinjection of either nemolizumab 30 m g or placebo for subjects 
weighing <90kgat baseline or by tw o SC injections of either nemolizumab 30 
mg or placebo for subjects w eighing ≥90kg at baseline. Refer to Table 1for an 
overview of the study therapy. Efficacy and safety assessments will be 
performed at visits throughout the screening and treatment period, as outlined in 
the Schedule of Assessments (Table 5).
At the end of the 24-week treatment period , consenting subjects may be eligible 
to enter an active treatment /long-term extension (LTE) study
(RD.06.SPR. 202699). Subjects who participate in the LTE are not required to 
complete the follow -up visit. Subjects who do not participate in the LTE will 
return for a follow -up visit at Week 32(12 w eeks after the last study drug 
injection ). 
Subjects who prem aturely discontinue the study drug will be asked to continue 
participation in the study and return for all remaining visits and assessments 
(including daily assessment sof pruritus andsleep disturbance). Subjects who 
discontinue study drug due to req uired rescue therapy may be eligible to 
participate in the LTE study follow ing completion of study visits through Week 
24. Subjects who discontinue the study prem ature ly should complete an early 
termination (ET) visit and a follow -up visit 12 w eeks after t he last study drug 
injection.
An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will review and monitor 
subject safety throughout the study, and an independent adjudication committee 
(IAC) will review all asthma -related events throughout the study. TheIDMC

Rescue therapies
If deemed to be medically necessary by the investigator (eg, to control 
intolerable signs/symptoms of PN ), rescue therap ies can be prescribed to the 
subjects at any time during the study except during the screening period.

Page 19of 185Subjects receiving rescue therapies during the screening period are not eligible 
to participate in the study. 
As a general guideline and per individual investigator judgment, rescue therapy 
should not be prescribed w ithin the first 4 weeks after baseline to allow  a 
minimum time for study drug exposure.
Investigator assessments of efficacy should be performed before initiating rescue 
therapy. Subjects requ iring rescue therapy between scheduled visits should 
return to the clinic (unscheduled visit) for investigator assessment of efficacy 
before starting rescue therapy.
Whenever possible, investigators should first use topical medication or oral 
antihistamine s as rescue therapy before escalating to other systemic therapies. If 
subjects receive topical treatments, oral antihistamines, or ultraviolet B (UVB) 
phototherapy as rescue therapy, study drug administration should be continued 
unless there is a concern a ccording to the investigator’s judgment. If subjects 
receive systemic rescue therapy (other than oral antihistamines) ,intralesional 
corticosteroids ,or oral psoralen + ultraviolet A (PUVA) treatment, the study 
drug administration must be perm anently disco ntinued. See Section 9.10.2 for a 
complete list of allow ed rescue therapies.
Subjects requiring rescue medication (with or w ithout study drug
discontinuation) may be eligible for LTE participation . These subjects must 
continue with study visits through Week 24to be considered for LTE 
participation . 
Treatm ent 
Duration :The expected duration of each subject’s participation in the study is up to 36
weeks, including a screening period (up to 4 w eeks) , a 24- week treatment
period, and an 8 -week follow -up period (12 -weeks after the last study drug
injection).
Subjects who rollover into the LTE are not required to complete the follow -up 
visit.

Statistical Methods 
and Planned 
Analyses:The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all randomized subjects. The 
safety population will include all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 
dose of stu dy drug. The Per-Protocol (PP) population will consist of all subjects 
in the ITT population who have no major protocol deviations that w ould have a

be the primary populatio n for all efficacy analyses, and all safety data will be 
summarized based on the safety population. The PP population will be used as 
the population for sensitivity analyses of the primary and key secondary efficacy 
endpoints. 
Prim ary Efficacy Endpoints:
There are 2 p rimary efficacy endpoint s
-The proportion of subjects w ith at least 4 points of improvement in PP
NRS at Week 16.
-The proportion of subjects reporting success on the IGA at Week 16, 
defined as an IGA response of 0 [Clear] or 1 [Almost clear] and a ≥ 2-
point reduction from baseline. 
Both primary endpoints will be analyzed using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel 
(CMH) test adjusted for randomized stratification variable analysis center and 
baseline body weight (< 90kg and ≥90kg). The estimate of the treatment 
difference (nemolizumab minus placebo) , p-value and 2 -sided 95% confidence 
interval will be presented .Missing data at Week 16, and any data for subjects in 
receipt of rescue medication up to Week 16, w ill be regarded as a non -responder 
for the prim ary analysis of the endpoint .
A number of sensitivity analyses are included for the primary endpoints, as per 
Section 15.4.3 .
Key Secondary Endpoints:
All binary key secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed as per the primary 
endpoint. 
Additionally, sensitivity analyses using multiple -imputation assuming missing at 
random (MAR) and observed case (OC) analysis will be performed for key 
secondary endpoints as outlined in Section 15.4.4 .
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints :
Binary secondary endpoints will be analyzed in the same manner as the p rimary 
endpoint; missing values will be imputed as non -responder. 
Continuous secondary endpoints (except EQ -5D, HADS )will be analyzed using 
multiple -imputation assuming MAR andusing mixed effect model for repeated 
measure ( MMRM )approach, including analysis center as factor and baseline as

endpoint at each visit will be displayed in the summary of statistical analysis 
together with the 95% CIand associated p -value. EQ-5DandHADS endpoints 
will be analy zedusing analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA )including analysis 
center as factor and baseline as covariate . All secondary endpoints will be 
presented descriptively using OC. 
Further details will be provided in th e Statistical Analysis Plan .
Multiplicity :
To control the type I error at 5%, a fixed sequential testing approach will be 
implemented. For testing purposes both primary endpoints will be tested first in 
a predefined order (as listed in Section 15.4.1 ) at 5% significance level, and 
testing of key secondary endpoints will start only if both primary endpoints are 
successful at 5% level of sign ificance. Key secondary endpoints will be tested in 
an order listed in section 15.4.4 , stopping when a non-significant result (p> 0.05) 
is found.
Safety Analyses:
The incidence of TEAEs, vital signs, laboratory values and ECG will be 
summarized by treatment groups. 
Pharm acokinetics (PK):
Summary statistics will be used to describe the PK profile of nemolizumab. 
Individual and mean serum concentration versus time curves w ill be presented 
for both linear and semi -log scales. Descriptive statistics of the serum 
concentrations versus time will be presented as w ell as for the PK parameters. 
Sample size:
In order to ach ieve at least 90% pow er for both prim ary endpoint at 5%
significance level, 270 (180 nemo lizumab , 90 placebo) subjects will be required 
to detect the following difference in both primary endpoints betw een treatment 
groups with 2:1 randomization, assuming 15% dropout rate during treatment 
period. 
NRS responders ( ≥4 point reduction from baseline): Based on phase 2a data, it is 
expected that the NRS response at Week 16 would be 50% in Nemolizumab 
group and 20% in placebo.
IGA response (0/1): It is expected that the IGA response at Week 16 w ould be 
30% in Nemolizumab group and 10% in placebo.

BACKGROUND ON PRURIGO NODULARIS
Prurigo nodularis (PN) is characterized b y the presence of multiple (up to hundreds), 
symmetrically  distributed, highl y pruritic, h yperkeratotic, erosive or crusted nodules and 
papules.1Chronic itching is believed to induce and maintain the characteristic PN skin 
lesions through an itch -scratch cy cle.2This leads to an impaired quality  of life (QoL) and 
high burden due not only to the severe itch but also the chronic skin lesions and lack of 
treatment options.3
Limited data exist about the incidence and prevalence of PN in the general population, 
but it seems to be more frequent and intense in females and the elderl y
.4,5
The phy siopathology  of PN is still not fully  understood; however, the interactions 
between cutaneous nerve fib ers, neuropeptides and immune cells seem to play  an 
important role in the onset o f PN.6The etiology  of PN is associated with a subclinical 
small fibe r neuropathy  based on the observed reduction of intraepidermal nerve fib er 
densi ty in patient biopsies and the epidemiological association of PN with various 
etiologies of peripheral neuropathies.7,8,9Further supporting this theory  is the observation 
of a positive response in some patients to gabapentin and pregabalin ,commonly  utilized 
treatment sforpain and neuropathy .10PN also has a neuroinflammatory  component as 
changes in the morphology  of skin nerve fibers andincreased dermal neural hy perplasia 
are associated with concomitant inflammation caused by T l ymphocy tes, eosinophil s, 
granulocy tes and mast cells.6
As itch is the hallmark symptom of PN, a role for neural sensitization followed b y lesion 
appearance and development of a chronic itch -scratch cy clehas been suggested
. 
A large spectrum of underly ing conditions thatinduce chronic pruritus can be associated 
with PN ,including dermatological (eg ,atopic dermatitis), sy stemic (eg ,chronic kidney  
failure), neurological (eg ,brachioradial pruritus), and psychiatric or mixed orig in 
disorders .11

Page 36of 185Only  a few studies have described the incidence and the strength of association of 
different co -morbidities in a representative cohort of patients with PN.4A large stud y of 
PN patients at a major academic center in the United States noted associations of PN with 
chronic kidney  disease, Ty pe II Diabetes, and HIV.12Further, data from US claims 
databases confirmed these associations.5A subset of patients with PN also have a 
concomitant atopic diathesis , occurring in nearl y half of subjects with PN in a small 
European stud y in a predominantly  Caucasian population. A topic diathesis was also 
found to predict a significantly  earlier age of onset (median age of 19 years) compared to 
non-atopic patients (median age of 48 years).13
Psychosocial disorders are also significantly  associated with PN. Rowland Pay ne et al.,14
found that more than 50% of their PN patients had a history  of depression or anxiety  
requiring medical intervention.
The goal of PN treatment is to break the itch -scratch cy cle and allow the skin to heal. 
However, t reatment of PN is notoriously  challenging and frustrating for both 
dermatologists and patients ,as the response to current therapy  options is typically limited 
or associated with adverse events (AEs). There are no standardized or approved therap ies
for PN to date and evidence from controlled studies is limited.10The difficulty  in treating 
this disease is reflected in the wide range of treatments proposed in the literature.
The current treatment recommendations for PN include identification and treatment of 
any underl ying disease, moisturizers and antipruritics, topical therapies (corticosteroids, 
calcineurin inhibitors) , and oralantihistamines as first -line agents.15Phototherap y, oral or 
intra-lesional steroids, topical vitamin D3 (calcipotriol), capsaicin, cry otherapy  and 
antidepressants (amitripty line, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors) are used as 
second -line therapies with variable efficacy . In third -line, s ystemic treatments such as 
cyclosporine,16antiepileptic drugs (gabapentin, pregabali n)17and thalidomide18showed 
moderate -to-good response in pruritus reduction after several months of administration, 
but their use is limited by  their unfavorable safet y profile. Other off -label therapeutic 
options proposed for pruritus based on limited evidence include opioid receptor agonists 
and antagonists (naltrexone),19NKR1 -antagonists (aprepitant),20and antibiotics 
(roxit hromy cin, ery thromicin).21

Page 37of 185The T- cell -derived cy tokine interleu kin-31 (IL -31) has been suggested to be a key  play er 
in the development of pruritus in PN. Skin biopsies from PN patients with an atopic 
background showed a 50 -fold upregulation of IL -31 mRNA compared to skin from 
healthy  individuals and a 4.5 -fold upregul ation compared to skin from atopic dermatitis 
(AD) patients.22A significantly  higher level of IL -31 mRNA was also observed in PN 
patients with unknown AD background compared to normal skin.23
IL-31 is preferent ially produced b y T helper 2 ( Th2)cells, following induction by  IL-4.24
The IL -31 receptor A (IL -31RA) has been found to be expressed in several tis sues 
including the dorsal root spinal ganglia, where the cell bodies of cutaneous sensory  
neurons reside
,22as well as keratinocy tes. IL-31 binds to IL -31RA, forming a 
heterodimer with Oncostatin M receptor ( OSMR ), which activates the down -stream 
JAK/STAT signaling pathway  and transmits signals into the cell.25, 26
Taken together, IL -31 seems to be an important cy tokine for the regulation of PN and a 
potential therap y target.
BACKGROUND ON NEMOLIZUMAB
Nemolizumab is a humanized anti-human IL -31 receptor A (RA) monoclonal modified 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) 2 antibody  comprising a structure of 2 H-chains (445 amino 
acid residues) and 2 L-chains (214 amino acid residues) connected b y 16 disulfide bonds.
Nemolizumab inhibits the binding of IL-31 to IL -31RA and subsequent signal 
transduction.
Nonclinical Studies
Non- clinical studies in mice, cy nomolgus monkeys, and dogs have demonstrated a role 
for IL -31in pruritus models that were inhibited b y administration of anti -IL-31 or anti -
IL-31RA monoclonal antibodies.27-31The I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) contains detailed 
information on nonclinical studies. 
Clinical Pharmacokinetic Profile and Immunogenicity
Nemolizumab PK profile was extensively  assessed in subject s with AD in Phase 1, 2, and 
2b studies (Studies CI M001JP, CI M003JG, and RD.03.SPR.114322, respectively ) and

Page 38of 185after repeated doses and in subjects with PN ( Phase 2 study , RD.03. SPR.115828) . 
Similar nemolizumab sy stemic exposure was observed in subjects w ith AD and in 
subjects with PN when treated with the same dose (0.5 mg/kg). 
The similarity  in nemolizumab exposure between the PN and AD subjects was also 
confirmed using popPK modelling.  Overall pharmacokinetic assessment safter 
subcutaneous (SC) inject ions of weight -based ( 0.1 to 3 mg/kg )or flat (10 to 90 mg) doses 
showed a dose proportional increase of nemolizumab serum concentrations after a single 
(mg/kg) injection and a less than proportional increase after repeated (mg/kg and flat) 
administrations. The terminal elimination half -life of nemolizumab was around 2 weeks 
after single and repeated administrations. Steady state concentrations were achieved from 
week 16 of treatment following single SCinjections and from W eek 4 of treatment when 
a loading (flat 2x) dose was administered at the baseline injection. L imited sy stemic 
accumulation was observed after repeated administrations.
The IB contains additional detailed information on nemolizumab pharmacokinetics.
Immunogenicit y results showed nemolizuma b to have a very  low potential of inducing 
ADA in subjects with AD or in subjects with PN . Only  one treatment related ADA-
positive subjects was reported out of the 34 subjects with PN receiving the treatment. No 
subjects had positive ADA that included IgE and no subjects developed neutralizing 
antibodies (NAb) .
Clinical Studies
One phase 2 stud y with nemolizumab has been completed in PN subjects. Additional 
studies have been completed in healthy subjects, subjects with AD, and subjects with 
uremic pruritus.  Results of phase 2 studies in PN and AD subjects are summarized 
below. The IB contains additional detailed information on clinical studies conducted with 
nemolizumab.

Phase 2a Safety and Efficacy Study: Prurigo Nodularis
The phase 2a study (RD.03 .SPR.115828) was a randomized, placebo- controlled, double -
blind, parallel -group, multicenter study  to evaluate the safety  and efficacy  of 
nemolizumab in subjects suffering from PNover a 12- week treatment period . 
A total of 70 subjects were randomized: 36 subjects were randomized to placebo and 34 
subjects were randomized to nemolizumab 0.5 mg/kg. Sixty  subjects (85.7%) completed 
the study . Demographic characteristics were similar in both treatment groups. Disease 
characteristics at b aseline were similar in both treatment groups, with the exception of the 
Prurigo Activity  Score (PAS) at b aseline, which was slightly  higher in the placebo 
compared with the nemolizumab group, and more subjects in the nemolizumab group had 
a severe Investigator Global Assessment ( IGA)score compared with the placebo group.
The primary  efficacy  endpoint was percent change from baseline in Peak Pruritus 
Numeric Rating Scale (PP NRS) to Week 4 (weekly  average of the peak). Nemolizumab 
was clinicall y and statistically significantly  superior to placebo in reducing the PP NRS 
scores at Week 4 (difference between treatment groups -38.0%; 95% confidence interval 
[CI] -51.0, - 25.0; p< 0.001). 
The proportion of subjects with I GA success, a secondary  endpoint, was higher in the 
nemolizumab group compared with the placebo group at Week 12 and at a follow -up visit 
at Week 18, and the differences were statistically  significant (Week 12: difference 17.2%; 
p=0.020; Week 18: difference 32.0%; p=0.001).
Secondary  endpoints also incl uded PP NRS scores at other time points, Average P ruritus 
(AP) NRS ,PP and AP Verbal Rating Scale ,Dynamic Pruritus Scale ,and PAS . 
Improvements were statistically  significantl y greater in the nemolizumab group than in
the placebo group at all time points for pruritus endpoints and at or before Week 12 for 
PAS endpoints .
The most frequentl y reported treatment -emergent adverse event ( TEAE )was 
nasophary ngitis, the incidence of which was similar in the nemolizumab group (5 
subjects, 14.7%) and the placebo gro up (4 subjects, 11.1%). The incidence of 
neurodermatitis was higher in the placebo group (5 subjects, 13.9%) compared with the

Page 40of 185nemolizumab group (2 subjects, 5.9%). The incidence of atopic dermatitis was higher in 
the nemolizumab group (3 subjects, 8.8%) c ompared with the placebo group (0 subjects). 
The percentage of subjects with severe TEAEs was higher in the nemolizumab group (5 
subjects, 14.7%) compared with the placebo group (1 subject, 2.8%). The incidence of 
TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of the study  drug was similar between the 
nemolizumab and placebo group s.
The incidence of treatment- emergent SAEs was similar between the nemolizumab group 
(4 subjects, 11.8%) and the placebo group (3 subjects, 8.3%). Neurodermatitis was the 
most frequen tly reported treatment -emergent SAE, for which all subjects were in the 
placebo group (3 subjects, 8.3%). One subject in the nemolizumab group had a treatment -
emergent SAE related to study  drug (dermatitis psoriasiform). There were no deaths 
reported durin g the stud y.
Phase 2b Dose -Ranging Study: Atopic D ermatitis
The phase 2b stud y (RD.03.SPR.114322) was a randomized, placebo- controlled, double -
blind, parallel -group, dose-ranging stud y to evaluate the efficacy ,safet y, and 
pharmacokinetics of various doses of nemolizumab in moderate -to-severe AD subjects 
with severe pruritus (PP NRS ≥7).
A total of 226 adult subjects were randomized: 57 subjects were randomized to placebo 
and 169 subjects were randomized to nemolizumab arms (55 subjects to 10 mg, 57 
subje cts to 30 mg, and 57 subjects to 90 mg). Overall, all demographic and baseline 
disease characteristics were similar in all treatment groups.
The primary  efficacy  endpoint was percent change from baseline in Eczema Area and 
Severity  Index (EASI) to Week 24. At the Week 24 visit, a greater percent change 
reduction in EASI was observed with the nemolizumab 30 -mg dose (least squares mean
difference v ersusplacebo = 16.7%) and the difference was statisticall y significant (95%
CI = -30.2, - 3.2; p = 0.016 ) compare d to placebo. The nemolizumab 10-mg dose showed 
a marginall y statistically  significant difference v ersusplacebo (least squares mean
difference = 13.6%; 95% CI  = -27.3, 0.0; p = 0.05 1). However, the difference between
the nemolizumab 90 -mg dose and placebo did not achieve statistical significance.

Page 41of 185The PP NRS responder (PP NRS improvement ≥ 4) rate was statistically significant (p <
0.05) f or allnemolizumab doses at all timepoints from Week 2. 
All doses of nemolizumab were associated with a slightly  higher incidence of TEAEs 
when compared to placebo. There was no increase in the incidence of skin infections in 
the nemolizumab compared to the placebo groups, although there was a higher incidence 
of non- skin infections with nemolizumab (mainly  rhinophary ngitis and upper respiratory  
tract infections). There was a dose- dependent increase of asthma flares (1 [1.8%], 2 
[3.6%], 7 [12.3%], and 10 [17.5%] in placebo, 10 mg, 30 mg, and 90 mg, respectivel y) in 
subjects with pre -existing asthma. Events were mostly  mild or moderate (1 severe event 
with thehighest dose), manageable, and reversible under treatment with study  drug. 
Local and s ystemic injection -related reactions (I RRs) occurred more frequently  in the 
placebo group compared to the active treatment groups. Fin ally, there was a low 
incidence of peripheral edema, with no serious cases and no imbalance with the placebo 
arm. There was a comparable percentage of subjects discontinuing treatment due to 
TEAE in the placebo and active treatment arms.
There was 1 non -related AE with a fatal outcome (82 -year-old subject treated with the
10-mg dose died due to non –study  drug related aspiration pneumonia and
cardiopulmonary  arrest). Three suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions
(SUSARs) were recorded in the study : exacerbation of AD (10- mg dose, withdrawal
from study ), septic shock (90-mg dose, sepsis, Staphylococcus aureus–positive blood
culture, recovered/resolved without sequelae), and phlegmon/cellulitis of the right cheek
(30-mg dose, recovered/resolved without sequelae). All doses of nemolizumab were
associated with a slightly higher incidence of serious TEAEs (1 [1. 8%], 3 [5.5%], 2 
[3.5%], and 2 [3.5%] in placebo, 10 mg, 30 mg, and 90 mg, respectivel y) but not severe 
TEAEs (6 [10.7%], 3 [5.5%], 5 [8.8%], and 2 [3.5%] in placebo, 10 mg, 30 mg, and 90 
mg, respectivel y) when compared to placebo. 
The safet y and efficacy  data generated in the p hase 2b dose -finding study  supported the
selection of the 30 -mg dose as the treatment dose for the phase 3 studies in AD .

CLINICAL RISKS/BENEFITS OF NEMOLIZUMAB
Pruritus is the cardinal s ymptom in PN, and is often difficult to treat with current 
therapies. Chronic itching is believed to induce and maintain the characteristic PN skin 
lesions through an itch -scratch cy cle. Theref ore,the goal of PN treatments target pruritus 
remission in order to allow skin healing and improvement in patients’ QoL .
Results from a previous clinical stud ywith nemolizumab demonstrated a marked effect 
on PN and pruritus. The decrease in itching sensation was rapid, within the first week 
following the first injection and improved with subsequent administrations. This 
improvement in the signs and sy mptoms of PNwas consistent with the observed 
improvement in QoL  (evaluated using the D ermatology  Life Quality  Index [DL QI]).
Continuous treatment with nemolizumab also led to an improvement in the overall 
severit y of PN, which was evaluated with various validated scales (ie ,IGA, PP NRS, and 
PAS).Based on the results of the phase 2a stud y (RD.03 .SPR.115828) nemolizumab was 
clinically  and statistically significantl y superior to placebo in reducing the weekl y 
average of PP NRS scores at Week 4 (difference between treatment groups -38.0%; 95% 
CI -51.0, -25.0; p<0.001) . Improvements in IGA success and PAS ob served in the 
nemolizumab group were also statistically  significantly  greater than those observed in the 
placebo group.
According to the currently  available information on nemolizumab and the risks 
associated with biologic agents in general, the important potential risks for nemolizumab 
include I RRs (including local injection site reaction as well as s ystemic injection 
reaction), newl y-diagnosed or worsening of asthma, skin and non -skin infection s,and 
exacerbation of AD. The following specific risk -minimization and safet y follow -up 
measures have been planned in this clinical study :
a.In the phase 2b dose -ranging study  (RD. 03.SPR.114322) in AD, a dose -dependent 
increase of asthma flares in subjects with pre -existing asthma was observed. The 
protocol will exclude subjects with asthma exacerbation requiring hospitalization in 
the preceding 12 months before screening, subjects whose asthma ha s not been well 
controlled (ie, s ymptoms > 2 day s per week, nighttime awakenings 2 or more times 
per week, or some interference with normal activities) during the last 3 months before

Page 43of 185the screening visit, Asthma Control Test (ACT) score ≤ 19, and subjects with peak 
expiratory  flow (PEF) below 80% of the predicted value. At all visits, all subjects will 
be asked about respiratory changes and a respiratory examination will be performed. 
Peak expiratory  flow measurements will be performed for all subjects at s creening ,
baseline , and at intervals throughout the study . For subjects with a history  of asthma, 
PEF measurements and ACT will be administered at all visits. Subjects diagnosed 
with de novo asthma will perform PEF and ACT assessments at all visits startin g with 
the visit in which the diagnosis was confirmed. Subjects with a medical history  of 
asthma will be referred to the phy sician managing their asthma if ACT ≤ 19, PEF < 
80% of the predicted value, and/or unexpected worsening of asthma is observed or 
reported. Subjects without a medical history  of asthma will be referred to a 
respiratory  specialist if respiratory  changes suggestive of asthma are observed or 
reported. An independent adjudication committee (IAC) will review all asthma AEs 
reported during the course of the study . 
b.The exclusion criteria of this clinical study  (ie, restricting entry  of subjects with 
recent/current infections or known/suspected immunosuppression or unusually  
frequent, recurrent, severe, or prolonged infections) will prevent non -eligible patients 
from receiving nemolizumab. As no data are available in pregnant or breastfeeding 
women, these patients are not eligible for this study . Patients who have recently  
received live or non- live vaccines may  be considered for enrollment after an 
appropriate time has elapsed before baseline/Day  1. Administration of live vaccines is 
prohibited during the study . Administration of non-live vaccines is prohibited with 
the except ion of seasonal ,emergency , and COVID -19vaccinations.
c.A slight trend of dose -dependent increase of peripheral edema was reported in the 
nemolizumab phase 2a study  (CIM003JG) for AD. Most events were mild (11 of 21), 
no case was serious, and none resulted in premature treatment discontinuation; no 
case was ass ociated with renal or cardiac AEs. The EASI values and thy mus and 
activation -regulated chemokine levels were relatively  higher in subjects with 
peripheral edema indicating that peripheral edema might be related to more severe 
AD. There were a few subjects reporting peripheral edema in the phase 2b 
(RD. 03.SPR.114322) study  (2 [3.6%], 2 [3.6%], 4 [7%], and 2 [3.5%] in placebo, 10-

Page 44of 185mg, 30 -mg, and 90 -mg groups, respectively ). Peripheral edema will be followed as an 
AE of special interest (AESI ) in this study .
d.Anindependent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will monitor the safety data 
regularl y throughout the study, including AESIs, which were defined based on the 
currentl y available safet y information on nemolizumab and the risks associated with 
biologic agents 
in general. AESI s for this study  are:
IRRs
oAnaph ylactic reactions
oAcute allergic reactions requiring treatment
oSevere injection site reaction (ie, lasting > 24 hours)
Newl y diagnosed asthma or worsening of asthma
Infections
oAny severe infection or any  infection requiring treatment with parenteral 
antibiotics or with oral antibiotics/antivirals/antifungals for > 2 weeks
oAny confirmed or suspected coronavirus disease ( COVID)- 19 infection
Peripheral edema: limbs, bilateral
Facial edema
Elevated ALT or AST (> 3 × ULN) in combination with elevated bilirubin (> 2 × 
ULN)
In conclusion, when taking into consideration the currentl y available data of
nemolizumab and the risk- minimization approaches to be implemented, the benefit/risk
ratio of nemolizumab is considered to be favorable in this study .
DOSE SELECTION RATIONALE
The dose was selected based on the phase 2 stud yresults contained in PN subjects
(RD.03.SPR.115828 ). PN subjects enrolled in the phase 2 study  received a 0.5 mg/kg 
weight -based dose, administered every  4 weeks ( Q4W) , and successfully  demonstrated 
efficacy  in the treatment of PN with an acceptable safet y profile. The same weight -based 
dose was administered in the phase 2a stud y CIM003JP in AD subjects, all owing a direct 
comparison between the two populations. Similarity  in the PK profiles between subjects

Page 45of 185with AD and subjects with PN was established, and no effect of disease on nemolizumab 
systemic exposure was identified.
This phase 3 stud ywill utilize a flat dose. This fixed dose is considered safer and more
efficient as it avoids errors that could be made in calculating, preparing, and 
administering a weight -based dose. 
The switch from a bod y weight -based dose to a flat dose was supported b y previous 
observed clinical data in subjects with AD. During the phase 2b study  
RD.03.SPR.114322 in AD subjects ,a 30-mg flat dose (with 60- mg loading dose) 
administered Q4W provided the best benefit/risk ratio and produced a similar exposure 
compared to the 0.5 mg/kg dose used in the AD phase 2a study  CIM003JG.
The switch from mg/kg to a flat dose was further supported by  popPK and PK/PD 
modeling and simulation tools. PK/PD modelling was conducted using the two prima ry 
clinical efficacy  endpoints, ie, PPNRS responder and IGA 0 -1 success.
-The PK/PD model for PP NRS were initially  developed based on data from AD 
subjects, tested against observations of stud
yRD.03.SPR.115828 and considered 
suitable to be used for modelling and simulation in PN populations. 
-Conversel y,due to the difference in IGA scale between the two indications ( ie,PN 
and AD), a PN -specific model was built based on data from stud y 
RD.03.SPR.115828. 
Overall, the PopPK and PK/PD models were used to select a flat dose that produce 
similar systemic exp osure and efficacy  results than the ones observed in the phase 2 stud y
RD.03.SPR.115828 .
Dose for subjects with a body weight below 90kg:  The popPK and PK/PD modeling 
demonstrated that similar exposure and similar clinical efficacy are expected in this s ub-
population after a 30 -mg dose administered Q4W (with a loading dose of 60 mg at 
baseline ) compared to the dose regimen used in the phase 2 stud y (0.5 mg/kg Q4W). 
Dose for subjects with a body weight superior or equal to 90 kg: The switch from a 
body  weight-based dose (0.5 mg/kg) to a flat 30 mg dose (with a loading dose of 60 mg
Galderma S.A./Galderma R&D, LLC RD.06.SPR. 202685
Nem olizumab (CD14152) Version 5.0

Page 46of 185at baseline ) will produce a lower systemic exposure in the heavier subjects. The clinical 
relevance of this lower systemic exposure was assessed using PK/PD models. 
-Simulations showed that no differences in PP NRS efficacy  endpoint is expected for 
those subjects.
- S imulations with the PN -specific model for the IGA endpoint showed a lower 
responder rate for th ose subjects after administration of the 30 -mg dose with a 60-mg 
loading dose. The PK/PD model confirmed that IGA responder rate would be
comparable to that observed after 0.5 mg/kg administration when using a flat 60 -mg 
dose without a loading dose . 
For this reason, a 60-mg dose without a loading dose will be used f or subject s with a 
body  weight superior or equal to 90 kg, in order to guarantee an IGA responder rate 
comparable with thatobtained in the overall population in study  RD.03.SPR.115828.
Of note, for subjects with a body  weight superior or equal to 90kg, PopPK simulation 
showed that a 60-mg dose will provide similar nemolizumab exposure with respect to 
thatobserved with the 0.5 mg/kg dose. Based on the similarity  in sy stemic exposure 
between the 2 doses, no major change in the drug safet y is expected in adults. 
Loading dose : Subcutaneous administration of nemolizumab results in slow absorption 
with peak serum concentrations achieved after 4 to 9 day s. Plateau s ystemic exposure 
levels are achieved after at least 16 weeks of repeated monthly  administrations. 
Therefore, loading doses are necessary  to rapidl y achieve targeted s ystemic levels, and to 
ensure a fast onset of action. Rapid inhibition of pruritus in PN is an important treatment 
goal in itself and is also expected to contribute to breaking the itch -scratch cy cle and th us, 
to improve the skin condition in PN subjects. These outcomes were achieved in a phase 
2b study  in AD subjects using a 60-mg loading dose (ie, 2 doses of 30 mg nemolizumab) 
at the baseline visit. No loading dose will be used for the subjects with a body weight 
superior or equal to 90 kg.

DESCRIPTION OF OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN
This phase 3, multicenter, double -blind, placebo- controlled, randomized, parallel -group
study  is designed to evaluate the efficacy  and safety  of nemolizumab in subjects with PN.
Considering a screen failure rate of 35- 40%, 415-450subjects will be screened so that 
approximately  270adult subjects with PN will be randomized 2 :1 to receive either 
nemolizumab (CD14152) or placebo. Subjects weighing < 90kg at baseline will receive 
either 30 mg nemolizumab (with 60 mg loading dose at baseline) or placebo Q4W. 
Subjects weighing ≥90kg at baseline will receive either 6 0 mg nemolizumab or placebo 
Q4W. Subjects will be stratified b y study  center and baseline bod y weight (< 90kg and ≥
90kg).Subjects will be enrolled in approximately  70study  centers in Europe ,North 
America , and Asia Pacific .
Subjects’ participation in the study will be up to 36weeks. The stud y consists of a 
screening period (up to 4 weeks), a 24- week treatment period ,and an 8 -week follow up 
period (12 weeks after the last study  drug injection). Refer to Figure 2for an overview of 
study  design.
Following provision of written informed consent, subjects with PN will be screened for 
enrolment in the study . Eligible subjects will return for a baseline visit where, following 
randomization, they  will be administered either 60 mg of nemolizumab or place bo via 2 
SCinjections. Thereafter, study  drug will be administered Q4W at Weeks 4,8, 12, 16, 
and 20 by a single SC injection of either nemolizumab 30 mg or placebo for subjects 
weighing <90kg at baseline or by  two SC injections of either nemolizumab 30 mg or 
placebo for subjects weighing ≥90kg at baseline . Refer to Table 3for an overview of the 
study  therapy .Efficacy  and safet y assessments will be performed at visits throughout the 
screening and treatment period, as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5).
At the end of the 24-week treatment period, consenting subjects may  be eligible to enter 
an active treatment/long -term extension (L TE) study  (RD.06.SPR.202699). Subjects who 
participate in the LTE are not required to complete the follow -up visit . Subjects who do

Page 52of 185not participate in the LTE will return for a follow- up visit at Week 32 (12 weeks after the 
last study  drug injection).
Subjects who prematurely discontinue the stud y drug will be asked to continue 
participation in the study  and return f or all remaining visits and assessments (including 
daily  assessment of pruritus andsleep disturbance). Subjects who discontinue study  drug 
due to required rescue therap y ma y be eligible to participate in the LTE study following 
completion of study  visits through Week 24. Subjects who discontinue the study  
premature ly should complete an earl y termination (ET) visit and a follow -up visit 12 
weeks after the last stud y drug injection.
An IDMC will review and monitor subject safet y throughout the stud y, and an IAC will 
review all asthma -related events throughout the study . The IDMC and IAC charters 
provide details on the IDMC and IAC, including the plan of analy sis for outputs; the 
composition of the committee s;and procedures, roles, responsibilities and 
communications.

DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN
This study  will evaluate the safet y and efficacy  of nemolizumab (CD14152) in adult 
subjects with PN. The rationale for the general study  design is based upon the prior phase 
2a study  design conducted in adult subjects with PN. The rationale for the nemoliz umab 
dose/dose regimen is provided in Sections 5.2and 5.4.
Eligible subjects for this clinical study  will be adults with a clinical diagnosis ( ≥ 6 
months) of PN, manifested by pruriginous nodular lesions on the trunk and/or limbs, and 
at least 20 nodules bilaterally  distributed on the entire body . The inclusion criteri onfor 
IGA isconsistent with the disease severit y targeted in the study : An IGA of 3 or 4 
corresponds to moderate or severe PN, respectively . Severe pruritus will be defined b y 
PP NRS scores within the past 24 hours at screening and the mean PP NRS score during 
the previous week at baseline. Subjects with chronic pruritus due to other active 
condition sor unilateral pruriginous lesions are ineligible. Further, subjects must under go 
specific required washout periods from restricted topical and s ystemic treatments before 
enrolling in the stud y. The study  population is selected based on the current unmet need 
in the management of PN , the mode of action of nemolizumab (CD14152), and the need 
to understand the efficacy  and safet y of nemolizumab (CD14152) in the adult population
with PN .
As no approved medicine for PN exists with which to compare nemolizumab, a placebo -
controlled design was i mplemented in thisstudyto allows blinding, randomization, and 
identical administration procedures to control for human bias or other influences on the 
disease (eg, natural disease course) ,while enabling demonstration of differences in 
clinical effect and safet y profile of investigational treatment , if present. All subjects will 
have access to rescue medication to minimize risk and for ethical considerations. It is the 
position of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that, where 
ethical and feasible, a placebo control arm should be included in the pivotal trial(s) used 
to support marketing authorisation application .
A 16-week treatment period is considered adequate to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of 
nemolizumab based on the results of the phase 2 astudy  (RD.03.SPR. 115828) in subjects 
with PN . Afurther 8 -week treatment period is included to provide additional data as 
Galderma S.A./Galderma R&D, LLC RD.06.SPR. 202685
Nem olizumab (CD14152) Version 5.0 
CONFIDENTIAL
Page 55of 185requested by  the European Medicines Agency  for chronic disease s such as PN. All 
subjects who complete the treatment period (Week 24visit) can be considered for L TE 
study  eligibility .A 2-to-1 randomization is selected to minimize the number of subjects 
exposed to placebo for an extended period of time. 
Although the path ophysiology  of PN is still not fully  understood, t he efficacy endpoints 
selected for the phase 3 trial are relevant to the underly ing manifestations associated with 
the disease under study (ie, skin lesions , chronic itch, sleep disturbance, and quality  of 
life impairment ). The selected endpoints for assessing the safet y and PK of nemolizumab 
(CD14152) are in accordance with current standards. Blinding subjects and the 
designated study  team to the treatment assignment(s) helps ensure objectivity  and 
minimize bias. Randomization through the Interactive Response Technology  (IRT)
guards against sel ection bias.
The study  includes an 8 -week follow -up period (ie, 12 weeks after the last study  drug 
injection) for subjects who decline or are not eligible to enroll in the L TE study . The 
duration of the follow -up period from the final nemolizumab dose (12 weeks) 
corresponds to approximately  5 half -lives of nemolizumab, which is considered adequate 
to ensure subject safet y. The follow -up visit is not required for subjects who participate in 
the L TE, where the primary  objective is long -term evaluation of safe ty.
Differences may  be detectable during the study  drug reconstitution process between 
active study  drug and placebo but appear similar after reconstitution is complete 
(approximately  10 minutes). Throughout the study , a pharmacist (or other qualified 
personnel) will prepare study  drug for injection, including confirmation of complete 
reconstitution, prior to delivery  of study  drug for injection. The pharmacist (or other 
qualified personnel) preparing stud y drug should not be involved with any  study  
assessm ents and should not discuss any  aspects of study  drug reconstitution with the 
subject or study  staff involved in subject interviews or study  assessments.
The placebo -control leddesign includes a provision for rescue therapy  for pruritus, based 
ontheinvestigator ’sclinical judgment. Subjects requiring rescue therap y may be eligible 
for the LTE stud y but will be required to continue scheduled study visits until the Week 
24visit before LTE eligibility  will be assessed.

If a subject is withdrawn from the study  for an y reason, the date and the reason for study  
withdrawal must be recorded on the electronic case report form (e CRF ). 
Subjects who 
have been enrolled and treated will not be replaced by another subject. Once a subject is 
withdrawn from the study, the subject may not re- enter the stud y.
Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study should undergo final study 
assessme nts and attend an E arly Termination (ET) visit. Subjects should also complete a
follow -up visit 12 weeks after the last study  drug administration.
Subjects who prematurely discontinue stud y drug will be encouraged to complete all 
remaining visits and assessments (including dail y assessment of pruritus and sleep 
disturbance) . 
Subjects requiring rescue medication (with or without study  drug discontinuation) may  be 
eligible for LTE participation , following completion of study  visits through Week 24. 
Reasonable efforts will be made to contact subjects who are lost to follow -up. These 
efforts must be documented in the subject’s file.
In the event that a subject discontinues prematurely from the study because of a TEAE or 
serious TEAE, the TEAE or seriou s TEAE will be followed up until it resolves (returns to 
normal or baseline values) or stabilizes, or until it is judged b y the investigator to no 
longer be clinicall y significant.
Additionally , the Sponsor may stop the study  at any  time for safet y, regul atory , legal, or 
other reasons aligned with GCP . This study  may  be terminated at the discretion of the 
Sponsor or an y regulatory agency. 
Pregnancy
Subjects will be instructed that known or suspected pregnancy occurring during the stud y 
should be confirmed and reported to the investigator. If a subject becomes pregnant, 
the investigator must withdraw the subject from the study without delay. The 
subject must not receive any further injection(s) of the study drug.

Monitor and record the progress of the pregnancy  until its outcome. Contact the 
subject’s regular ph ysician (general practitioner or gy necologist) or hospital staff 
to obtain further details and ask for regular follow -up information.
Provide tri -monthly  updates until the final outcome of the pregnancy . If the 
subject can no longer be reached ( lost to follow -up), documentation of the non -
response/contact with 2 phone calls and a letter (certified with return receipt) is 
required.
If the pregnancy  leads to an abortion (ie, voluntary abortion, spontaneous 
abortion, or therapeutic abortion), in ute rodeath or congenital anomal y, follow 
the procedure for declaration of/reporting an SAE (Section 12.7.4 ). 
The investigator should also be notified of pregnancy  occurring during the study  (and 
within 12 weeks [± 5 days] after the last dose of study  drug) but confirmed after 
completion of the stu dy. In the event that a subject is subsequently  found to be pregnant 
after inclusion in the study , any  pregnancy  will be followed to term, and the status of 
mother and child will be reported to the Sponsor after delivery .
Full details will be recorded on the withdrawal page (exit form), or an SAE report will be

PACKAGING AND LABELING
All packaging and labeling operations will be performed according to Good 
Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products in the local language, national 
regulations/guidelines, and the relevant regulatory requirements, specifying that the drug 
is for use in a clinical study . Each DCS will be packaged in an individual carton, 
including a 27G 1/2” needle and a plunger rod (not assembled), and will be identified by  
a unique kit number. Local adaptation of the kit design may be required; specific details 
for eac h country  are provided in the pharmacy  manual.
STUDY DRUG PREPARATION
A pharmacist (or other qualified personnel) will prepare study drug for injection 
according to the instructions for use and instructions provided in the current version of 
the pharmacy  manual. Study  drug preparation should be conducted in a secured and clean 
area with limited access to only  designated personnel at the time of the preparation. Good 
hygiene practices and clean techniques must appl y at all times.
Differences may  be detectabl e during the study  drug reconstitution process between 
active and placebo ,but active and placebo appear similar after reconstitution is complete 
(approximately  10 minutes). Throughout the study , a pharmacist (or other qualified 
personnel) will prepare study  drug for injection, including confirmation of complete 
reconstitution, prior to delivery  of study  drug for injection. The pharmacist (or other

Page 71of 185qualified personnel) preparing the study drug should not be involved with any stud y 
assessments and should not discuss any  aspects of study  drug reconstitution with the 
subject or study  staff involved in subject interviews or study
 assessments.
The study  drug does not contain preservatives. From a microbiological point of view, the 
preparation of the stud y drug ha s to be done as close to subject administration as possible, 
and the study  drug should be used immediatel y (less than 1 hour) after reconstitution. I f 
not used immediately , the study  drug has to be used within 4 hours maximum after 
reconstitution stored at room temperature (below 30°C) and only  if the preparation has 
taken place appl ying strictly  good h ygiene practices and clean techniques to ensure 
controlled aseptic conditions.
STUDY DRUG INJECTION/ADMINISTRATION
All study  drug injections will occur at th e study center, following instructions provided in 
the instructions for use and the current version of the pharmacy manual. After confirming 
that the study  drug is fully  reconstituted, the pharmacist (or other qualified personnel) 
will deliver the DCS to the investigator or other qualified personnel, for SC injection in 
the subject’s abdomen or an alternative injection site. A different injection site should be 
selected for each injection. Refer to the current version of the pharmacy  manual and the 
instructions for use for further details. The site of injection should be recorded in th e 
subject’s treatment record as well as the e CRF at each time point.
For subjects willing and able to self -inject, stud y center staff will provide training on 
study  drug injections. Subjects will be allowed to inject medication following appropriate 
traini ng and under supervision by study  center clinic staff (with DCS preparation 
including reconstitution performed b y the pharmacist or other qualified personnel and 
delivered for injection after reconstitution is complete). Study center/clinic staff can 
perfo rm all injections if the subject does not wish to perform injections. The eCRF will 
record who performed study  drug injection at each visit.
After stud y drug administration, subjects will be monitored closely for any signs or 
symptoms of hy persensitivity  reaction before being discharged. For the first 2 visits

STUDY DRUG MANAGEMENT
Storage of Study Drug
All DCS units mus t be stored together in a safe and secure area with restricted access. 
Upon receipt, the DCS must be removed from the shipping cooler, kept in the outer 
carton until use , and stored in a refrigerator between 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F), protected 
from light ,and protected from freez ing.
The refrigerator must be monitored daily , and if a temperature excursion occurs, the 
designated personnel should promptly  inform the study  monitor, as specified in the 
current version of the pharmacy  manual.
Study Drug Accountability
Study  drug will be provided to the investigational site and site personnel will 
acknowledge receipt of the study  drug using IRT to confirm the shipment condition and 
content. If a damaged shipment is received and/or a temperature excursion h as been 
experienced, he/she will notify  the Sponsor/ contract research organization ( CRO )and 
follow the guidelines according to the current version of the pharmacy  manual.
The designated personnel will also maintain accurate records of the stud y drug 
throughout the clinical study , including the inventory  delivered to the stud y center, the 
use by  each subject, the reconciliation of all delivered and received DCS units, and the 
return /destruction of unused study  drug as specified in the current version o f the 
pharmacy  manual. No unauthorized use is permitted. Used DCS units will be properl y 
documented in drug accountability  records. Unless a product technical complaint (PTC) 
is detected or an event occurs before, during, or just after the injection, the u sed DCS can 
be disposed in an appropriate sharps container and according to waste regulation(s) in the 
country . A DCS involved in a malfunction or an investigator or subject complaint must 
be retained on site and designated personnel must proceed as define d in the current 
version of the pharmacy  manual. Refer to Section 9.6for product technical complaints.

designee) has correctl y documented the amount of the study  drug received, dispensed, 
and returned/destro yedon the dispens
ing log that will be provided. A full drug 
accountability  log will be maintained at the study center at all times. The study  monitor 
will arrange collection of any unused study drug not destroy ed by  the site . The study  
monitor will also perform an inventor y of study  drug at the close -out visit to the study  
center. All discrepancies must be accounted for and documented.
Dispensing and Return of Study Drug
All study  drug preparation must be appropriatel y performed and documented by  the 
designated personnel. Any  error in the preparation of dosing solution must be reported to 
the study  monitor promptly  and be properly  documented. At the end of the study , the 
reconciliation/ return /destruction process for all unused study  drug will be conducted 
according to the si tes’ SOPs, local regulations, and best practices, as described in the 
current version of the pharmacy  manual . If the site does not have the capability  to destro y 
drug, then the unused study drug will be returned to the CRO/drug depot for destruction.
PRODU CT TECHNICAL COMPLAINTS
All DCS units, including the needle and plunger rod, must be inspected prior to 
preparation/injection by  the persons performing the preparation/injection to ensure 
absence of visual defects that could lead to a DCS PTC. I n case of d oubt, the DCS should 
not be used, and the deficiency  must be reported as defined in the pharmacy  manual .
All PTCs should be reported to the S ponsor/designee b y filing the relevant forms 
available in the Investigator Site File and the pharmacy  manual and as required by  local 
regulations. A PTC is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges 
deficiencies related to the identity , qualit y, reliability , safet y, durability, effectiveness, or 
performance of a drug or delivery  system. Examples may include but are not limited to 
appearance issues, discoloration, odor, broken/cracked s yringe, missing parts, damaged 
stoppers, and foreign matter in lyophilized powder or diluent. These complaints may  or 
may not represent a potential risk to the subj ect. For these t ypes of events, a form must be

MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: STUDY TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT 
AND BLINDING 
Method of Study Treatment Assignment
Upon confirmation of eligibility  for a given subject to participate in the study, a unique 
randomization number will be assigned to that subject via Interactive Response 
Technology  (IRT). 
The randomization number for a given subject will be used to identify the treatment arm 
the subject will be assigned to.
Subjects will be randomiz ed in a 2 :1 ratio to receive treatment of either nemolizumab 
(CD14152) or placebo. The randomization scheme will be stratified by  the study  site and 
baseline bod y weight (< 90kg and ≥90kg) using the I RT sy stem.  
Study Blinding
All attempts will be made to keep the stud y center staff and subjects blinded throughout 
the study . Members of the study  center staff, including those responsible for DCS 
preparation, will not have access to the randomized treatment assignment.
To ensure double -blind administratio n of study  drug ,the stud y center pharmacist(s) or 
other qualified personnel will prepare all nemolizumab (CD14152) or placebo treatments, 
according to the current version of the pharmacy manual and assigned DCS provided by 
the IRT sy stem.
As there may  be detectable differences between active and placebo during the 
reconstitution process, the DCS is delivered for injection after the reconstitution is

Page 75of 185complete. The pharmacist (or other qualified personnel) preparing study  drug should not 
be involved with an ystudy  assessments and should not discuss any  aspects of study  drug 
reconstitution with the subject or study  staff involved in subject interviews or study  
assessments.
To maintain the integrit y of the study  blinding, the bioanaly tical laboratory  staff who 
process/anal yze the PK/anti -drug antibody  (ADA) /pharmacod ynamic (PD)/ 
pharmacogenomic (PGx) samples will not provide any  information to the Sponsor, CRO, 
or investigational stud y center personnel directly involved with the ongoing conduct of 
the study  that may lead to unblinding during the ongoing study . PK and ADA results will 
released b y the bioanal ytical laboratory  after data base lock. 
Unblinding of a subject’s individual treatment code should occur onl y in case of a 
medical emergency  or in the event o f a serious medical condition that necessitates 
identification of the study drug for the welfare of that subject, as judged b y the 
investigator . The emergency  unblinding process utilizes I RT to allow the investigator to 
have unrestricted, immediate, and di rect access to the subject’s individual study  
treatment. When possible (ie, when the health of the subject is not immediately  at risk) , 
the investigator or sub -investigator is encouraged to consult with the medical monitor and 
the Sponsor before breaking t he blind.
If emergency  unblinding is required:
•Only  the investigator will make the decision to unblind the treatment assignment.
•Only  the affected subject will be unblinded.
•The I RT sy stem will provide the treatment assignment to the investigator.
Refer to the Randomization and Trial Supply  Management (RTSM) User Guide for 
information on the steps for breaking the blind in the I RT s ystem.
When the blinding code is broken, the reason must be fully  documented. If the code is 
broken b y the investigator, the su bject must be withdrawn from the study  and must also 
be appropriatel y followed for a minimum of 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug.
The reporting requirements for unblinding are the same for reporting an SAE. See also 
Section 12.7.4 .

Page 76of 185The randomization code will remain blinded to all study  sites and stud y team members 
until completion of the study and after the study database has been locked.
The IDMC will review data at periodic intervals throughout the stud y as defined in the 
IDMC charter. The IDMC charter will specify  the procedures for unblinding to ensure
treatment assignment remains undisclosed to all individuals involved in the direct 
execution and management of the study  until the final database is locked .
DOSAGE MODIFICATION
Dose modification of the study drug will not be permitted during the clinical study .
Any inadvertent dose modification(s) should be reported to the Sponsor/CRO and 
documented in the eCRF .
In the event of a missed dose (ie, temporary  discontinuation of the study  drug), it will be 
documented in the eCRF that the drug has not been administered at the study  visit, 
together with the reason (eg, for safet y). Subjects will be asked to return to the study  
centers for all remaining visits and complete all study assessments and procedures as 
described in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 5).
Dosing frequency  is scheduled for Q4W, based on the baseline/Day  1 visit date. If a 
study  visit occurs outside the visit window defined in the Schedule of Assessments
(Table 5), study  drug can still be administered provided there is a minimum of 3 weeks 
but not more than 5 weeks since the last injection . If bey ond 5 weeks, the nextinjection 
should then occur at the next planned visit. Future visits should be scheduled as soon as 
possible and within the required windows based on the baseline/Day  1 visit date, while 
maintaining the minimum 3 -week interval between 2 injections.
TREATMENT COMPLIANCE
Treatment compliance will be assessed through the treatment records and drug 
dispensation logs.
As study  drug is administered in the clinic, treatment compliance will be overseen and 
documented b y the investigator and stud y staff (using the treatment records and drug 
accountability records). At a minimum, date, time, dose, injector (subject or site staff),

treatment was properl y administered.
PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT THERAPY
Prior therapies are defined as therapies that have been stopped within the 3 months before 
the screening visit, unless relevant to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Whenever possible, 
all prior therapies for PN should be documented.
Concomitant therapies/medications are defined as follows:
Any existing therapies ongoing at the time of the screening visit,
Any changes to existing therapies (such as changes in dose, formulation or 
application frequency ) during the course of the study , or
Any new therapies received by  the subject since the screening visit
The following 2 categories are to be considered for prior and concomitant therapies:
Drugs/Therapies include but are not limited to :prescription, over -the-counter, 
birth control pills/patches/hormonal devices, vitamins, moisturiz ers, sunscreens, 
herbal medicines/supplements, and homeopathic preparations.
Medical and surgical procedures (eg, phototherapy , exodontia, etc); procedures 
whose sole purpose is diagnosis (non -therapeutic) are not included.
Prior and concomitant therapies for drugs/therapies or for medical/surgical procedures are 
to be recorded in the appropriate e CRF.
Concomitant therapies are to be recorded, reviewed, and updated at each visit.
At each visit, investigators should also confirm concomitant therapies for con traception.
See Appendix 1 for details. Contraceptive counseling should occur at screening.
Any new concomitant therapy or modification of an existing therap y ma y be linked to an 
AE. In such cases, a corresponding AE form should be completed to account for the new 
therap y orchange in therapy , except in some cases such as an inadvertent dose

CONFIDENTIAL
Page 78of 185modification (see Section 9.8 ), in which case the therapy /medication will be linked to an 
item in the subject’s medical history .
Permitted Concomitant Therapy
Unless specified as prohibited therapies (see Section 9.10.3), all therapies are authorized, 
including basic skin care (cleansing and bathing), moisturizers, bleach baths, and topical 
anesthetics.
Starting from the screening visit, subjects can use their daily  moisturizer, if it does not 
contain an y compound with known anti -itch effect ( eg,menthol, polidocanol ,etc.). 
Subjects should not chang eemollients or moisturizers or apply  products for itching relief 
during the course of the study .
Sedatives and antidepressants as described in Table 4are allowed if they  have been 
administrated for at least 3 months at a stable dose before screening baseline and dose 
changes are not planned during the stud y.
The formation of cy tochrome P450 (CYP450) metabolic enzy mes can be altered by  
increased levels of certain cy tokines (eg, IL -1, IL -6, IL -10) during chronic inflammation. 
Treatment with a biologic agent with an anti -inflammatory  effect such as nemolizumab
may indirectly  upregulate CYP450 expression by  decreasing cy tokine levels. Although 
there is no k nown evidence suggesting that IL -31 affects the level or activity of CYP450 
enzy mes, the impact of nemolizumab (CD14152) on such enzy mes has not been studied. 
Therefore, investigators should consider observing forclinical or laboratory signs that 
might indicate a potential effect of nemolizumab (CD14152) in subjects using 
concomitant therapies that are CYP450 substrates , particularl y those with a narrow 
therapeutic index. Typical examples of substrates with a narrow therapeutic range include 
warfarin, drug s that may  cause torsade de pointes, almost all cy totoxic antineoplastic 
drugs, and aminogly coside antibiotics. A list of representative CYP450 substrates with 
narrow therapeutic index can be found in Appendix 3 .

Rescue Th erapy
If deemed to be medically necessary  by the investigator (eg, to control intolerable PN
signs/sy mptoms), rescue therapies can be prescribed to the subjects. 
Rescue therap y must not be prescribed during the screening period.
As a general guideline and per individual investigator judgment, rescue therapy  should 
not be prescribed within the first 4 weeks after baseline to allow a minimum time for 
study  drug exposure.
Rescue therapies include:
Topical corticosteroids
Topical calcineurin inhibitors
Oral antihistamines
Systemic or intralesional corticosteroids
Biologics (including their biosimilars)
Systemic nonsteroidal immunosuppressants/immunomodulators
Phototherapy
Gabapentinoids
Whenever possible, investigators should first use topical medication or oral 
antihistamines as rescue therap y before escalating to other sy stemic therapies. If subjects 
receive topical treatments, oral antihistamines, or ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy  as 
rescue therap y, stud y drug administration should be continued unles s there is a concern 
according to the investigator’s judgment. If subjects receive s ystemic rescue therap y 
(other than oral antihistamines) ,intralesional corticosteroids, or oral p soralen + 
ultraviolet A ( PUVA ) treatment, the study drug administration mus t be permanently  
discontinued. In the event study  drug administration isdiscontinued due to receipt of 
systemic rescue therap y, subjects will be encouraged to complete the remaining 
scheduled stud y visits according to the Schedule of A ssessments in Table 5.Subjects who 
complete the Week 24visit may  be eligible to participate in the LTE if screening criteria 
are met.

Note: Subjects should not interrupt ongoing treatment with medications important for the subject’s health 
for the sole purpose of participating in this study.
If a prohibited therap y becomes necessary for the safet y of the subject, the investigator 
should notify  the medical monitor and discuss possible alternatives. If a subject receives a 
prohibited therap y during the clinical study  (eg, inadvertent short -term use), the 
investigator should also notify the medical monitor and discuss whether or not it is 
acceptable for the subject to continue receiving the study  drug.
Specificall y, the use of systemic corticosteroids d uring the stud y is prohibited except 
when used as rescue therapy  for PN (in accordance with the instructions in 
Section 9.10.2 ). If the use of s ystemic corticosteroi ds becomes necessary  for the safet y of

Page 93of 18511EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS
The Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table 5) outlines the efficacy  assessments to be performed 
throughout the stud y and their timing .Whenever possible, t he same evaluator should 
perform all assessments for the same subject in order to reduce intra -subject variability . 
INVESTIGATOR GLOBAL ASSESSMENT
The IGA is a 5 -point scale used b y the investigator or trained designee to evaluate the 
global severit y of PN. The Investigator will review the subject’s skin and give a score of 
0 (Clear), 1 (Almost clear), 2 ( Mild), 3 ( Moderate) ,or 4 ( Severe). Treatment 
response/success is defined as 0 ( Clear) or 1 ( Almost clear) and a ≥ 2 -point improvement
from baseline (seeAppendix 4 ).
PRURIGO ACTIVITY SCORE
The Investigator or designee will use the PAS as an evaluation of the disease . This 
includes a count of the number of lesions in a representative area and a calculated staging 
(stage 0 to stage 4) based on the percentage of lesions with excoriations/crusts and healed 
lesions compared to all lesions. 
A cop y of the PAS can be found in Appendix 5.
NUMERIC RATING SCALES
Itch/Pruritus Numeric Rating Scales
Two NRS srelating to itch/pruritus (average and maximum intensity ) will be completed 
by the subject once daily  in the evening (seeAppendix 6 ).32Each NRS will ask for a unit 
score on an 1
1-point scale (0 to10) where 0 is “no itch ”and 10 is the “ worst itch 
imaginable ”. The 2 questions asked will be:
For average itch intensity (AP NRS): “On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being “no 
itch” and 10 being the “worst itch imaginable ”, how would y ou ra te your itch 
overall during the previous 24 hours?”

Page 94of 185For maximum itch intensity  (PP NRS): “On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being “no 
itch
”and 10 being the “worst itch imaginable ”, how would y ou rate y our itch at 
the worst moment during the previous 24 hours?”
If a subject do esnot complete the NRS assessments in the evening before a scheduled 
visit, the subject will be allowed to complete the assessment the following day at the 
clinic visit. Site staff will be asked to ensure that the answer to the second question (PP 
NRS) is equal to or higher than the answer to the first question (AP NRS). If it is not ,
then further explanation will be given to the subject.
Sleep Disturbance Numeric Rating Scale
An NRS relating to sleep disturbance will be completed by the subject once daily  in the 
morning and if possible, within 1 hour of getting out of bed, to report the degree of their 
sleep loss related to PN (see Appendix 7) . Each NRS will ask for a unit score on an 11-
point scale (0 -10). The question asked will be “On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being “no 
sleep loss related to the symptoms of myskin disease (prurigo nodularis) ”and 10 being 
“I did not sleep at all due to the symptoms of my skin disease (prurigo nodularis) ”,how 
would y ou rate y our sleep last night? ”
If a subject do esnot complete the SD NRS in the morning before a scheduled visit , the 
subject will be allowed to complete the assessment at the clinic visit.
SUBJECT SLEEP DIARY
Subjects will be given a morning sleep diary  to record the qualit y of their sleep. See
Appendix 8. The subject sleep diary is a modification of the consensus sleep diary ,33and 
is designed to gather information about the subject’s sleep pattern and how symptoms 
related to PN (eg, itching
, burning ) affect their sleep. Subject sleep diary  items used to 
derive sleep parameters (eg, sleep onset latency, WASO) are defined in Appendix 8 .
Subjects will be instructed to complete the sleep diary (Questions 1 to 11) once dail y in
the morning (ie, within 1 hour of getting out of bed), with the daily SD NRS
(Appendix 7). If a subject do esnot complete the sleep diary  in the morning before a 
scheduled visit , the subject will be allowed to complete the assessment at the clinic visit.

PAIN FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY 
Subjects will be asked to report the frequency and intensity  of pain they  endure related to 
their skin disease (prurigo nodularis) (see Appendix 9 ). Subjects will rate the frequency 
of their pain on a 6- point scale (0 -5)in response to the following question:
“How often would y ou say  that y ou experience pain from y our skin disease (prurigo 
nodularis)?” 
Subjects will rate the intensity  of their pain using an 11- point NRS (0-10) in response to 
the following question:
“On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being “no pain ”and 10 being “the worst unbearable 
pain”, how would y ou rate the pain associated with y our skin disease (prurigo 
nodularis) at the worst moment during the past week?”
PATIENT -REPORTED OUTCOMES ASSESSMENTS
Patient Global Assessment of Disease 
For the PGAD, subjects will be asked to rate their overall impression of their skin disease 
(prurigo nodularis) severity  using a 5 -point scale from “clear” to “severe” ( see
Appendix 10). Subjects will be asked the following question:
“Overall, how would y ou describe y our skin disease (prurigo nodularis) right 
now?”
The PGAD will also serve as an anchor for the patient- reported outcome (PRO) 
psychometric validation.
Patient Global Assessment of Treatment 
The PGAT utilizes a 5 -point L ikert scale for subjects to rate the way  they  feel their skin 
disease (prurigo nodularis) is responding to the study  treatment. See Appendix 11 .
Subjects will be asked the following question:

Patient Global Impression of Severity -Pruritus
For the PGIS -P, subjects will be asked to rate their impression of their overall itch 
severit y during the last week using a 5- point scale from “none” to “very  severe”
(Appendix 12) . Subjects will record their PGIS -P scores in the evening after completing 
the Pruritus (PP and AP) NRS (Appendix 6) . If a subject do esnot complete the PGI S-P in 
the evening before a scheduled visit , the subject will be allowed to complete the 
assessment the following day at the clinic visit .The PGI S-P will serve as an anchor for 
the PRO psychometric validation. 
Patient Global Impression of Change - Pruritus
The PGI C-P utilizes a 5- point L ikert scale (from “much better” to “much worse”) for 
subjects to rate their impression of how their overall itch has changed since beginning 
study drug. See Appendix 13 .Subjects will record their PGI C-P scores in the evening 
after completing the Pruritus (PP and AP) NRS (Appendix 6) . If a subject does not 
complete the PGI C-P in the evening before a scheduled visit , the subject will be allowed 
to complete the assessment the following day at the clinic visit . The PGI C-P will serve as 
an anc hor for the PRO psychometric validation. 
Patient Global Impression of Severity -Sleep Disturbance
For the PGIS -SD, subjects will be asked to rate their impression of the severity of their 
sleep disturbance due to the symptoms of PNduring the past week using a 5 -point scale 
from “none” to “very  severe” ( SeeAppendix 14 ). Subjects will record their PGI S-SD 
score in the morning after completing the SD NRS and Subject S leep D iary(Appendix 7
andAppendix 8, respectively ). If a subject does not complete the PGI S-SD in the 
morning before a scheduled visit , the subject will be allowed to complete the assessment

Safety  assessments (vital signs, phy sical examinations, ECG recording, AEs, respiratory  
examination and assessments ,andclinical laboratory  results [routine hematology  and 
biochemistry ])are to be performed at protocol -specified visits, beginning at the screening 
visit (upon signing the ICF),as specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 5).
VITAL SIGNS
Vital signs will be evaluated at allvisits, as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 5). Vital signs will include pulse rate, s ystolic and diastolic blood pressure (after 
the subject has been sitting for at least 5 minutes), and b ody temperature. All abnormal 
values at the screening visit identified as clinically significant b y the investigator will be 
recorded in the medical history form . Any clinically  significant changes from the 
screening visit ( and onwards )will be recorded as an AE. 
HEIGHT AND WEIGHT
Height and weight will be measured according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Complete phy sical examination should be performed at the screening, baseline, and 
specified subsequent scheduled visits, according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 5). A complete phy sical examination will include assessments of the head, ears, 
eyes, nose, throat, neck (including th yroid), skin/integumentary  system, cardiovascular 
system, respiratory  system (for additional respiratory assessments, s ee Section 12.6), 
gastrointestinal s ystem, musculoskeletal sy stem, ly mph nodes, nervous system , and 
extremities.
The investigator should assess all ab normal findings for clinical significance. All 
clinically  significant abnormal findings at the screening visit will be recorded in the 
medical history  form. Any  clinically  significant changes from the screening visit will be 
recorded as an AE.

12-LEAD ELEC TROCARDIOGRAM
A 12 -lead, resting ECG will be performed and read centrally  according to visits indicated 
in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5)using the ECG machine provided. ECGs for 
each subject should be obtained using the electrocardiograph machine provided for the 
study . ECGs will be performed in the supine position and before any scheduled vital sign 
measurements and blood draws. Subjects should be monitored for potentially  clinicall y 
significant ECG results (refer to the current version of the central laboratory manual). 
Tests with abnormal results that are deemed clinically  significant should be repeated to
ensure reproducibility  of the abnormality . ECG abnormalities present at screening should 
be recorded in the medical history  form. Any abnormalities considered b y the 
investigator to be clinically  significant after the scre ening visit are to be recorded as AEs 
and discussed with the medical monitor, as needed.
CLINICAL LABORATORY EVALUATION
The hematology  laboratory  anal yses, clinical chemistry  laboratory  anal yses, and 
urinaly ses will be performed at a central laboratory . Reference ranges will be supplied by  
the central laboratory  and used by  the investigator to assess the laboratory  data for 
clinical significance and pathological changes.
The investigator or medically  qualified sub -investigator must review and evaluate 
laboratory  values for each subject in a timely  manner. Study  centers should refer to the 
current version of the laboratory  manual for laboratory  values outside of normal limits. 
For each out -of-range laboratory  result, the investigator or designee will evalua te whether 
he/she considers it to be clinically  significant, defined as meeting at least 1 of the 
following conditions:
The abnormalit y suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity , or 
The abnormalit y is of a degree that requires additional active management, eg, 
discontinuation of the drug, close observation, more frequent follow -up 
assessments, or further diagnostic investigation.

Page 101of 185If the investigator observes a clinicall y significant laboratory result, the test will be 
repeated as soon as possible and the su bject will be monitored until the value returns to 
normal and/or an adequate explanation for the abnormality  is found.
Investigators will also be allowed to repeat specific laboratory  test(s) or procedure(s) 
where the investigator suspects an inaccuracy  orfalse result and that may impact the 
safet y of the subject or the interpretation of the trial results .This should occur only after 
discussion with medical monitor .
All clinically  significant out -of-range laboratory  values at the screening visit will be 
recorded in the medical history  form (report a diagnosis rather than the laboratory  value 
whenever possible). All clinically  significant out -of-range laboratory  values after the 
screening visit are to be reported as an AE if this abnormality was not present at the 
screening visit or is assess ed as having worsened since the screening visit (ie, changed 
significantl y from the screening visit). Whenever possible, the investigator should 
provide a diagnosis of an AE when reporting the abnormal laboratory  value. See Section 
12.7 for details. 
Subjects should be reminded to be well h ydrated before all visits for phlebotomy 
purposes. Subjects should fast for at least 8 hours before the visits whe n blood chemistry  
testing is planned, except for the screening visit. The screening visit laboratory  values 
must be available before the baseline visit. Laboratory  testing conducted in a nonfasting 
state will not be a protocol deviation.
Total blood volume s to be drawn at each visit are provided in the clinical laboratory  
manual. Additional samples may  be required if medically  indicated (eg, at unscheduled 
visits for safet y reasons, when an abnormal laboratory  value is observed and requires a 
re-test).
Laboratory  assessment samples are to be obtained at designated visits as detailed in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5).

no study  drug should be administered pending the serum pregnancy  test result. Subjects 
with a positive serum pregnancy  test result during the trial must discontinue treatment 
and be withdrawn from the tria l.
Virology
Virology  including HBsAg, HBcAb, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus 1, and 
human immunodeficiency virus 2 antibodies will be assessed at the screening visit. 
Subjects with a positive HBcAb and a negative HBsAg will also be assessed for h epatitis 
B surface antibody .Subjects with positive HCV antibodies will have a confirmatory  test 
for HCV ( eg, PCR).
Tuberculosis Testing
Immunosuppressant biologic treatments have been shown to increase the risk of TB 
infection or to cause conversion from latent to active TB in some circumstances. Subjects 
will be screened for active or latent TB before entry into this study .
12.5.6.1 Tuberculosis Definitions
Active TB is a disease caused by  Mycobacterium tuberculosis in any  part of the body  and 
that is in an active state as determined b y either a smear or culture taken from any source 
in the person’s bod y which tests positive for TB or by radiographic evidence. Individuals 
with active TB are s ymptomatic, depending upon the location of the disease (most 
commonly  in the lungs but also possibly  in the brain, kidney s, spine, or elsewhere), and 
can spread the infection to others.
Latent TB is said to exist when an individual is infected with M tuberculosis, as 
evidenced b y a positive Interferon Gamma Release Assay36such as QuantiFERON- TB 
Gold, but is asy mptomatic and has no evidence of active infection on screening pathology  
or radiographic tests. Such individuals do not pass the disease to others and should 
commence a course of prophy lactic antimy cobacterial treatment to eliminate the infection 
and commit to completing the course of treatment.

Page 104of 18512.5.6.2 Tuberculosis Screening
Ideally, as part of the medical history, the subjec t should be asked if they  have presented 
with active or latent TB in the past and whether they  have received a bacillus Calmette -
Guérin (BCG) vaccination. They  should also be asked if they  have been in contact with 
any individuals known to have active TB o r been placed in an y circumstances that may  
have exposed them to an increased risk of TB infection, such as travel to TB endemic 
regions, close contact with persons with active TB, or workplace risk (eg, prison, 
hospitals).
A subject who tests positive for latent TB (with a positive QuantiFERON -
TB Gold test) 
should be referred to the subject’s treating ph ysician for appropriate follow -up, unless the 
subject hasa documented history  of completion of an appropriate TB treatment regimen 
with no history  of re -exposure to TB since their treatment was completed. If the result is 
indeterminate, the test may  be repeated once. If confirmed indeterminate, the subject 
should then be managed as though he/she has a positive test result.
RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENTS
At screeni ng, the investigator should specifically  question all subjects about any  medical 
history  of asthma and their respiratory  health (eg, wheezing, coughing, allergies, and 
infections). Subjects with a history of asthma will be questioned about the seasonality of 
their asthma and known triggers, such as allergens. Newl y-diagnosed asthma or 
worsening of asthma during the stud y will be reported as an AESI.
Asthma Control Test
Subjects with a medical history  of asthma will take the ACT at visit s according to the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5)before questioning and phy sical examination by  the 
investigator. Subjects with a new (de novo) diagnosis of asthma will take the ACT 
beginning at the visit the diagnosis was first confirmed and thereafter, at all subsequent 
study  visits. Subjects with an ACT score ≤ 19 willbe referred to the ph ysician managing 
their asthma.

Page 105of 185The ACT is an assessment to determine if a subject’s asthma s ymptoms are well 
controlled. The ACT is designed for adults and adolescents 12 y ears or older, and is 
composed of 5 questio ns. For each question, the subject will choose the best answer out 
of 5 possible answers. The test provides a numerical score ranging from 5 to 25 to assess 
asthma control; a higher score indicates better asthma control while a score of 19 or less 
indicate s the subject’s asthma may  not be under control. A cop y of the ACT can be found 
inAppendix 19
.
Respiratory Examination
A respiratory  examination will be required to be performed for all subjects at all 
scheduled visits, according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5). The ACT will also 
aid the investigator ’s questioning of subjects with a medical history  of asthma and should 
be completed before the clinical questioning. All subjects will be asked non- leading 
questions about any  respiratory  changes. The investigator or designee will then perform a 
respiratory  examination of all subjects at all visits. 
Subjects with a medical history  of asthma willbe referred to the ph ysician managing their 
asthma if unexpected worsening of asthma is observed or reported. Subjects without a 
medical history  of asthma who experience respiratory  changes (exam findings or newl y-
reported signs and/or s ymptoms suggestive of asthma) willbe referred to a respiratory  
specialist.
Peak Expiratory Flow
All subjects will undergo PEF testing at screening ,baseline , and specified visits 
according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5). For subjects reporting a medical 
history  of asthma, PEF testing will be conducted at allvisits. 
In the event that PEF is < 80% of the predi cted value at screening in patients without any  
history  of asthma or in patients with history  of asthma but with the ACT score > 19, PEF 
testing can be repeated once within 48 hours.
Subjects with a new (de novo) diagnosis of asthma will undergo PEF testing at all visits 
after the diagnosis is first made according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5).

supervision of qualified study  personnel. Peak expiratory  flow measurements should 
consist of 3 good efforts, with the best result documented. I t is preferable that the PEF 
measurement be performed before noon or at the same time during each study  visit 
whenever possible. 
Obtained PEF values will be compared to predicted values based on 
the subject’s age, sex and height.37,38
To avoid interference with PEF measurements, a ttempts should be made to withhold 
asthma medication on study  visit day s until after PEF testing is complete; to the extent it 
does not pose an undue risk to the subject. 
Subjects 
with a medical history  of asthma with a PEF < 80% of the predicted value will 
be referred to the ph ysician man aging their asthma .
Respiratory Referrals
Subjects with a medical history  of asthma willbe referred to the ph ysician who manages 
their asthma when:
PEF < 80% of the predicted value
ACT score ≤ 19 because an ACT score ≤19 convey s asthma that may  not be 
adequatel y controlled
Unexpected worsening of asthma is observed or reported at an y time during the 
study
At any study  visit, subjects without a medical history  of asthma willbe referred to an 
appropriate specialist physician whenever:
Signs and/or s ymptoms suggestive of asthma are newly  observed or reported.
Respiratory  assessment s (ie, examination, PEF) suggest a decline in the subject ’s 
respiratory  health.

ADVERSE EVENTS
Adverse Events
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study  subject 
administered a medicinal product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated 
with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not it is related to the 
medicinal (investigational) product. This includes an exacerbation of pre -existing 
conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, drug interaction, or the significant worsening 
of the indication under investigation that is not recorded elsewhere in the eCRF under 
specific efficacy  assessments. 
Note(s): 
Any new sign or s ymptom reported b y the subject that appears after accidental or 
intentional overdose or misuse should be reported as an AE.
Whenever possible, a diagnosis should be reported on the AE form, instead of 
signs, s ymptoms, or abnormal laboratory  values. 
Pregnancy  is not to be considered an AE; however, it must be monitored and 
reported as describ ed in Section 12.7.7.
Each worsening of a chronic disease from the screening visit should be reported 
as a new AE.
The investigator or designee will report all AEs that occur from the time the I CF is signed 
until the end of the study. The sponsor/CRO should be informed if the investigator 
becomes aware of an y safety  information that appears to be drug related, even after the 
subject has completed the clinical study.
At each post enrollment visit, the investigator (or sub- investigator) will question the 
subject about AEs using an open non persuasive question to elicit reporting of AEs (for 
example, “Have you noticed an y change in your health since the last visit?”). Directed 
questioning and examination will then be performed as appropriate. 
Galderma S.A./Galderma R&D, LLC RD.06.SPR. 202685
Nem olizumab (CD14152) Version 5.0 
CONFIDENTIAL
Page 108of 185Any AE occurring during the AE reporting period, whether it is related to the study  
drug(s) or not, will be recorded immediatel y in the source document and described on the 
Adverse Event Form (“AE Form”) along with the date of onset, severit y, relationship to 
the study  drug(s), and outcome, without omitting any requested and known information. 
Additional information will be requested under certain circumstances.  
Adverse events assessed as related to the treatment or study  procedure will be monitored 
until they have resolved or reached a stable condition. Other AEs will be monitored until 
the last visit if they  have not resolved or reached a stable condition. 
The investigator will obtain and maintain in the subject’s files all pertinent medical 
records, information and medical judgment from colleagues who assisted in the treatment 
and follow up of the subject. If necessary , the investigator will contact the subject’s 
personal ph ysician or hospital staff to obtain further details.
Assessment of Severity
Each AE will be assigned a category  by the investigator as follows:
Mild: An AE that is easily  tolerated by  the subject, causes minimal discomfort, 
and does not interfere with every day activities.
Moderate: An AE that is sufficiently  discomforting to interfer e with normal every day 
activities; intervention may  be needed.
Severe: An AE that prevents normal every day activities; treatment or other 
intervention usually  needed.
If there is a change in severity  of an AE, it must be recorded as a separate event.
Assessment of Causality
The investigator is to determine whether there is a reasonable causal relationship between 
the occurrence of the AE, and exposure to the study  drug (ie, nemolizumab or placebo) 
and/or study  procedure (eg, injection, blood sample col lection). Medical judgment should 
be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant factors including the

CONFIDENTIAL
Page 109of 185pattern of the reaction, temporal relationships, relevant medical history , and confounding 
factors such as co- medication or concurrent d iseases.
The expression “reasonable causal relationship” is meant to convey  in general that there 
are facts or arguments to suggest a causal relationship (I CH E2A, Section IIIA 1).
The relationship assessment for an AE is to be completed using the following definitions 
as a guideline for all AEs occurring during this clinical study :
Reasonable possibility:
According to the reporting investigator, there is a reasonable possibility  (ie, suggestive 
evidence or arguments) that there is a causal relationship irrespective of the dose 
administered:
Between the stud y drug (nemolizumab) and the AE, and/or
Between the clinical study protocol procedure (eg, injection, blood sample 
collection) and the AE
No Reasonable Possibility:
No suggestive evidence or arguments can be identified regarding a causal relationship 
between the study drug or the clinical stud y protocol procedure and the AE.
Action Taken
The investigator will describe the action taken in the appropriate section of the eCRF, as 
follows:
None
Study  drug stopped
Study  drug temporarily  interrupted
Concomitant medication (an y additions or discontinuations)
Other, specify

Page 110of 185Follow -up of Adverse Events
All investigators should follow -up with subjects with AEs until the event is resolved or 
until, in the opinion o
f the investigator, the event is stabilized or determined to be 
chronic. Details of AE resolution must be documented in the eCRF.
Subjects should be followed up for 12 weeks (± 5 days) after receiving the last dose of 
study  drug, and an y AEs that occur dur ing this time should be reported according to the 
procedures outlined above.
Documentation and Reporting of Adverse Events
Adverse events should be reported and documented in accordance with the procedures 
outlined below. All AEs occurring during the study must be documented on the relevant 
eCRF pages. The following data should be documented for each AE:
Description of the s ymptom event
Classification of “serious” or “not serious”
Severity
Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable)
Action taken
Causal relationship
Outcome of event (unknown, recovered, not y et recovered, recovered with 
sequelae, death [with date and cause reported])
Adverse Events of Special Interest
An AESI  is a noteworthy treatment -emergent event for the study  drug that should be 
monitored closely  and reported promptly . See Section 12.7.5 for reporting procedure(s). 
An AESI  can be either serious or nonserious.

Serious Adverse Events
An S AE is any  untoward medical occurrence, in the view of either the investigator or 
Sponsor , that :
results in death
is life -threatening
results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
results in persistent o r significant disability /incapacity
is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
Other important medical events that may  not be immediately  life-threatening or result in 
death or hospitalization, based upon appropriate medical judgment, are considered SAEs 
if they are thought to jeopardize the subject and/or require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes defining an SAE. 
Hospitalization may  not constitute sufficient grounds to be considered as an SAE if it is 
solely  for the purpose of diag nostic tests (even if related to an AE), elective 
hospitalization for an intervention that was already planned before subject enrolment in 
the clinical trial, admission to a day  care facility , social admission (eg, if the subject has 
no place to sleep), or administrative admission (eg, for a y early examination).
SAEs are critically  important for the identification of significant safet y problems; 
therefore, it is important to take into account both the investigator’s and the Sponsor’s 
assessment. If either t he Sponsor or the investigator believes that an event is serious, the 
event must be considered serious and evaluated b y the Sponsor for expedited reporting.
Procedure for Reporting Serious Adverse Event s
For an y SAE occurring during the clinical study, re gardless of whether or not related to 
the study  drug and/or pro cedure, the investigator must:

Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions
AEsthat meet all of the following criteria will be classified as SUSARs and reported to 
the appropriate regulatory authori ties in accordance with applicable regulatory  
requirements for expedited reporting:
serious
unexpected (ie, the event is not consistent with the safet y information in the IB)
there is at least a reasonable possibility  that there is a causal relationship between 
the event and the stud y treatment
The investigator will assess whether an event is causally related to stud y treatment. The 
Sponsor (or Sy neos Health) will consider the investigator’s assessment and determine 
whether the event meets the criteria for being reportable as a 7 -day or 15 -day safety  
report. SUSARs that are fatal or life -threatening must be reported to the regulatory  
authorities and the IEC/IRBs (where required) ≤ 7 day s after the Sponsor (or Sy neos 
Health) has first knowledge of them, wit h a follow -up report submitted within a further 8 
calendar day s. Other SUSARs must be reported to the relevant regulatory  authorities and 
the IEC/I RBs within 15 calendar day s after the Sponsor (or Syneos Health) first has 
knowledge of them.

Procedures for Reporting Pregnancy
Women of childbearing potential ( WOCBP )must have a neg ative pregnancy  test at 
screening. Following administration of study  drug, any  known cases of pregnancy  in 
female subjects will be reported until the subject completes or withdraws from the study . 
Any pregnancy  occurring during clinical studies where the fetus could have been exposed 
to the study  drug must be monitored until its outcome in order to ensure the complete 
collection of safety data. If a subject becomes pregnant, the investigator must:
1.Withdraw the subject from the clinical study . The subject m ust not receive any  
injection of the study  drug.
2.Complete as fully  as possible the Pregnancy  Surveillance Form –Part I : History  and 
Start of Pregnancy . Send by  email or fax along with the exit form within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information, to the Sy neosHealth Safet y and Pharmacovigilance group. 
Refer to Section 12.7.4.
Note : Immediate pregnancy  reporting is required by the investigator if it occ urs during 
the clinical study  or within 12 weeks (± 5 day s) of receiving the last dose of study  drug, 
whether or not the event is considered to be related to the investigational product.
3.Monitor and record the progress of the pregnancy  until its outcome. C ontact the 
subject’s regular ph ysician (general practitioner or gy necologist) or hospital staff to 
obtain further details and ask for regular follow -up information.
4.Provide tri -monthly  updates until the final outcome of the pregnancy , by completing 
the Pre gnancy  Surveillance Form –Part II: Course and Outcome of Pregnancy . For 
all additional follow -up evaluations, send the form by  email or fax to the 
Syneos Health Safet y and Pharmacovigilance group within 24 hours of receipt of the

Surveil lance Form – Part II : Course and Outcome of Pregnancy . Print and send the 
form by  email or fax to the Sy neos Health Safety  and Pharmacovigilance group 
within 24 hours of receipt of the information.
6.If the pregnancy  leads to an abortion (ie, voluntary abortion, spontaneous abortion, or 
therapeutic abortion), in utero death or congenital anomaly , follow the procedure for 
declaration of/reporting an SAE (see Section 12.7.4 ).
Overdose
Study  drug overdose is the accidental or intentional use of the drug in an amount higher 
than the dose being studied. The investigator must immediately  notify  the Sponsor of an y

PHARMACOKINETIC SAMPLING
Blood Samples
Blood samples for PKanaly sis of nemolizumab levels will be collected at the time points 
indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 5)and the clinical laboratory  manual to 
determine the PK profile of nemolizumab. At each sampl ing time point for PK 
assessments, the collected blood will be placed to clot at room temperature (no more than 
60 minutes after collection) and then centrifuged. The serum will be collected into 
storage tubes.
As a guideline, PK samples should be collec ted at approximately  the same time of day  
throughout the study, to the extent possible, before study drug injection (pre -dose 
samples). The date and the time of each sample collection will be recorded in the e CRF, 
together with the time of study  drug injection at the same visit (or missed injection if 
applicable).
CD14152 Quantification in Biological Sampling
Concentration of nemolizumab (CD14152) in the serum will be determined by  the 
designated CRO using a validated enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay  method. Details 
related to the processing of serum samples and the assessments of nemolizumab will be 
described in the bioanal ytical plan, which will be finalized before the beginning of 
sample anal ysis. Results will be described in the bioanaly tical repor t, which will be 
included as an appendix in the final clinical study report.
PKparameters , PopPK and PK/PD analyses 
Population PKparameters of nemolizumab (CD14152) will be derived ,by a designated 
CRO ,using a non- linear mixed effect modeling approach with NONMEM software. A 
pre-specified P opPK model based on existing information from previous studies in adults 
(first -order absorption and a 1- compartment distribution model) will be updated with the 
nemolizumab serum concentrations obtained in this study .

PHARMACOGENOMICS
Pharmacogenomic testing (DNA anal ysis) is optional for this study , and will apply  to 
subjects who provide written consent for this procedure. Subjects are not required to 
participate in the DNA analy sis sub -study  in order to enroll in the main study .
DNA a nalysis will be performed using a blood sample collected at baseline . If 
inadvertentl y not collected at baseline, the sample may be collected at a post -baseline 
visit.
Samples will be stored by the S ponsor or designated CRO for up to 15 y ears after the end
of the study . Candidate sequences in DNA anal ysis may  include but are not limited to 
genes that encode IL -31 and its receptor (IL -31RA). DNA anal ysis will be conducted for 
the purpose of understanding inter -individual variability  in nemolizumab (CD14152) 
efficacy , safet y, and PK.
These data may  be used or combined with data collected from other studies to identify 
genomic markers that may  predict response and elucidate mechanisms of disease. 
Analy ses may  include sequence variation or single nucleotide pol ymorphism 
identification within candidate genes and surrounding genomic regions. Genome -wide 
studies may  also be performed.
It is the intent of the Sponsor to assure that PGx information obtained remains 
confidential. The S ponsor maintains rigorous confidentiality  standards for clinical studies 
by “coding” (ie, assigning a unique subject ID number at the investigational study center) 
for all subjects enrolled in the study. All samples taken for DNA anal ysis will undergo a 
second level of “coding” (each sampl e will receive a double -coded ID), according to the 
International Council for Harmonisation ( ICH)-15 standards. Records will exist to trace 
double -coded samples to individual subjects for destruction if a subject provides a written 
request to withdraw thei r sample for DNA anal ysis. The data from samples that have 
alread y been anal yzed will not be destroy ed.

IMMUNOGENICITY 
Blood samples will be collected at the time points indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 5)and the clinical laboratory  manual to assess anti -nemolizumab 
ADA.
TheADA will be determined by  the designated CRO using a validated 
electrochemiluminescence immunoassay  (ECLIA) . The serum concentration will be 
assessed using a multi -tiered approach.
Details related to the processing of serum samples and the assessments of ADA will be 
described in the bioanal ytical plan, which will be finalized before the beginning of 
sample anal ysis. Results will be described in the bioanaly tical report, which will be 
included as an appendix in the final clinical study report.
If serum circ ulating ADA is detected, presence will be confirmed and characterized (eg, 
for titer and neutralizing potential). Incidence of positive ADA results will be 
summarized (absolute occurrence and percent of subjects).
PHARMACODYNAMIC BIOMARKERS
Blood and strat um corneum (D -Squames) samples will be collected from approximately  
100 subjects at selected sites to investigate the effect of nemolizumab (CD14152) on 
selected RNA and protein biomarkers, including but not limited to IL -31. Optional s kin 
biopsies for RNA and immunohistochemistry  analy ses will be collected from 
approximately  30 subjects atselected sites who sign the additional consent form. Samples 
will be collected according to Table 5. 
The details of the procedures for PD samples and storage conditions are further described 
in the clinical laboratory  manual. Samples will be shipped to the designated CRO for 
biomarker asse ssment, unless otherwise specified. Samples will be stored by  the sponsor

DATASETS OR STUDY POPULATIONS ANALYZ ED
Screened Population
The Screened population comprises all subjects who signed the ICFand have screening 
data entered into the database. This population includes screen failures and randomized 
subjects. Screen failed subjects are defined as those subjec ts who fail to meet inclusion 
criteria or meet exclusion criteria and discontinue the study prior to randomization. 
Subjects that are re -screened will only  be counted once, under the subject ID assigned for 
the repeat screening.
Intent -to-Treat Population (ITT)
The ITT population will consist of all randomized subjects. The ITT population will be 
the primary  population for efficacy  anal yses. All anal yses under the ITT population will 
be anal yzed under the treatment group as randomized.
Per-Protocol Population (PP)
The PP population will consist of all subjects in the ITT population and have no major 
protocol deviations that would have a significant effect on the efficacy of the study 
treatment. Onl y primary and key secondary endpoints will be analy zed using the PP
population , under the treatment group as randomized . For further information on protocol 
deviations ,please refer to Section 15.9.
Safety Population (SAF)
The SAF will consist of all randomized subjects who received at least 1 administration of 
study  drug. The treatment group assignment in this population will be defined by the 
treatment actually  received. This population will be used fo r the anal yses of safet y.
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis Population (PKAP )
The PK APwill consist of all subjects included in the SAF, with at least one measurable 
post-baseline PK assessment. Similar to SAF, t he treatment group assignment in this 
population will be defined by  the treatment actually  received. This population will be 
used for the descriptive analy ses of PK parameters.

SUBJECT DISPOSITION
The number of subjects screened and randomized in each anal ysis population will be 
presented. The number of subjects that discontinue the study  and the reasons for 
discontinuation will be summarized. I n addition, subjects’ status with regard to study  
treatment and follow -up will also be summarized.
DEMOGRAPHICS AND OTHER BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS
Demographic and other baseline characteristics ( eg, age, sex, race, height, body  weight, 
body  mass index, and applicable disease baseline characteristics) will be summarized for 
the ITT, PP, and SAF populations. Medical history, plus prior and concomitant therapies 
(including prohibited therapies) will be summarized for the SAF population .
EFFICACY ANALYSIS
Unless otherwise stated, all efficacy  analy ses will be performed on the ITT population .
Primary Efficacy Endpoints
The primary  endpoint sinclude the following endpoints:
1.The proportion of subjects with an improvement of ≥ 4 from baseline in PP NRS 
atWeek 16.
2.The proportion of subjects reporting success on the IGA at Week 16, defined as 
an IGA response of 0 [Clear] or 1 [Almost clear] and a ≥ 2- point reduction from 
baseline ;
For both primary  endpoint s, any  subjects with missing data at Week 16will be regarded 
as a non- responder for the respective endpoint. If a subject is in receipt of rescue 
medication at an y point on or prior to Week 16, data after receipt of rescue medication 
will be set to missing, and subsequently regarded as a non -responder for respective 
primary  endpoint based on the same imputation m ethod as for purel y missing data. 
Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoints
The statistical hy potheses associated with the primary anal ysis of improvement in PP 
NRS ≥ 4 from baseline at Week 16 using treatment difference is, similarly:

Page 127of 185H0: PPP NRS nemo - PPP NRS Pla = 0;
H1: PPP NRS nemo - PPP NRS Pla ≠ 0,
where P PP NRS nemo and P PP NRS Pla are the proportion of subjects categorized as having a PP 
NRS improvement from baseline to Week 16of ≥4, for nemolizumab and Placebo, 
respectivel y.
The statistical hy potheses associated with the primary anal ysis of IGA success at Week 
16 using treatment difference is:
H0: PIGA nemo -
PIGA Pla = 0;
H1: PIGA nemo - PIGA Pla ≠ 0,
where P IGA nemo and P IGA Plaare the proportion of subjects categorized as success under 
IGA at Week 16for nemolizumab and Placebo, respectively .
Both primary  endpoints will be anal yzed using a Cochran -Mantel- Haenszel (CMH) test 
adjusted for the randomization strata analysis center and baseline body  weight cut-off(<
90kg and ≥90kg), in order to test the difference between nemolizumab and placebo for 
the proportion of subjects achieving success in each endpoint. The estimate of the 
treatment difference and corresponding 2
-sided 95% CIand p -values will be presented. 
The confidence intervals will be based on Wald statistic controlling for stratification 
variables. Strata -adjusted proportion differences will be obtained using weighted average 
of stratum -specific proportion using CMH. This primary  anal ysis will be conducted on 
the ITT population. To control ty pe I error at 5% significance level, a fixed sequential 
testing approach, as described in Section 15.4.5, will be implemented.
Sensitivity Analyses of the Primary Endpoint
Sensitivity  analy ses for both primary  endpoints will be conducted in order to test for the 
robustness of the primary anal yses. The following sensitivity  anal yses will be conducted: 
PP population
To assess the robustness of non -responder anal ysis, a tipping point anal ysiswill 
beperformed b y converting non-responders due to missing data to responders in 
successive increments ( ∆)for both treatment groups .The value of ∆ that 
overturns ( ie,non-significant) the primary  results will represent the tipping point.

Multiple I mputation (MI) met hod for missing data (or where rescue medication is 
received), assuming all missing data are Missing at Random (MAR)
The MI imputation will be carried out as follows: 
Imputation Phase:
1. A 50 imputed datasets with a monotone missing pattern will be created using 
SAS MI  procedure based on the observed data (Markov- Chain- Monte -Carlo 
method, MCMC). The seed to be used is 202685 (the Protocol number). 
Pattern of missing data will be evaluated and it is expected that the pattern of 
missing data will be monotonic. For non -monotone missing data patterns, 
MCMC method of MI  procedure will be used to impute enough data so that 
the remaining missing data is monotone.
2. Each of the imputed datasets will be used to generate 50 complete datasets, 
using following approaches:
a.A logistic regression method to impute the ordinal IGA missing data, 
including treatment, randomization strata, and assessments from 
earlier time point sas covariates. IGA responder variable will be 
derived using these imputed data. 
b.For PP NRS endpoint, a linear regression model including treatment, 
randomization strata, and assessments from earlier time point sas 
covariates will be used to impute the weekl y average score. PP NRS 
responder variable will be derived using these imputed data. 
Analysis Phase:
3. The complete datasets will be modelled for the endpoint using CMH method 
as per anal ysis described in S ection 15.4.2 . Proportion of responders in each 
treatment arm, difference and standard error will be calculated.

Nem olizumab (CD14152) Version 5.0 
CONFIDENTIAL
Page 129of 185Pooling Phase:
4.The results from the CMH analys is of the multiple imputed datasets will be 
combined using the Rubin (1987) and Li et al (1991) approach to produce 
pooled CMH stat istics and p- value. Proportion of responders in each treatment 
arm, difference and standard error will be combined using the MIANALYZE 
procedure in SAS.
Pattern -mixture model under assumption Missing Not at Random (MNAR) 
controlled- based pattern imputation . MI-based imputation will be applied as 
described above. Under MNAR assumption, a controlled based pattern imputation 
where onl y observation in placebo treatment group will be used to impute. 
Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) imputation method for missing data 
(or where rescue medication is received)
Observed Case (OC) - No data will be imputed. For this analy sis, if an y rescue 
medication is received, and data are collected post rescue receipt, data post -rescue 
will be anal yzed as observed ( ie, not set to missing) by ignoring the use of rescue 
medication
Sensitivity  analy ses may  be performed to evaluate the imp act COVID -19 deviations. 
Further details will be provided in SAP.
Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
The following key  secondary  endpoints are to be anal yzed, in order:
1.Proportion of subjects with an improvement of ≥ 4 from baseline to Week 4 in PP 
NRS;
2.Proportion of subjects with PP NRS < 2 at Week 16
3.Proportion of subjects with an improvement of ≥ 4 from baseline in SD NRS at 
Week 16
4.Proportion of subjects with an improvement of ≥ 4 from baseline in SD NRS at 
Week 4
5.Proportion of subjects with PP NRS < 2 at Week 4

Page 132of 185Binary  secondary  endpoints will be analy zed in the same manner as the primary  
endpoint; missing values will be imputed as non -responder. 
Continuous secondary  endpoints (except EQ -5D, HADS) will be anal yzed using 
multiple -imputation assuming MAR and using mixed effect model for repeated measure 
(MMRM) approach, including analy sis center and baseline bod y weight cut -off(<90
kg 
and ≥ 90kg) as factor and baseline as covariate where applies. The estimated treatment 
difference for each endpoint at each visit will be displayed in the summary of statistical 
analysis together with the 95% CI and associated p -value. EQ- 5DandHADS endpoints 
will be anal yzedusing ANCOVA including analysis center and baseline body  weight cut -
off (<90kg and ≥90kg) as factor and baseline as covariate. All secondary  endpoints 
will be presented descriptively using OC. 
Further details will be provided in the SAP.
Handling of s mall study sites
A small center is defined as a center which randomizes less than 12 subjects. Small 
centers will be pooled prior to anal yses. First, centers will be sorted b y country, number 
ofrandomized subjects (descending order) and center number (asc ending order). Pooling 
will start with combining the largest of the set of small centers with the smallest center 
within that country . If there is a further need to combine data (the size of the pooled 
centers includes less than 12 subjects), the next smal lest center will be combined with the 
next largest of the small centers, until the criterion of a minimum of 12 subjects is met. 
The process will continue until all pooled centers have a minimum of 12 subjects within 
the country . Any remaining centers will be pooled with the last pooled center within the 
country . The pooled centers will be referred to as ‘anal ysis centers’ in the statistical 
analyses.
Subgroup Analysis
Descriptive summary  and anal ysis for primary  and key  secondary  endpoints will be 
produce d for the following subgroups:
Region ( Europe, North America, Asia -Pacific)
Age groups (18- 65, and > 65)

APPENDIX 1:CONTRACEPTION GUIDELINES
Women of childbearing potential ( WOCBP) must use at least 1 effective method of 
contraception during the study  and for 12 weeks after the last dose of stud y treatment. 
A woman is considered to be a WOCBP (fertile) following menarche and until becoming 
postmenopausal, unless she is permanentl y sterile. Permanent sterilization methods 
include hy sterectomy , bilateral salpingectomy , and bilateral oophorectomy. A 
postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal 
range may  be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therap y. However, in the absence of 12 months of 
amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. 
A man is considered fertile after pubert y unless permanently sterile b y bilateral 
orchidectom y.
Adequate methods of contraception include:
combined (containing estrogen and progestogen) hormonal contraception 
associated with inhibition of ovulation (administrat ionmay be ora l, intravaginal, 
or transdermal)
progestogen-onl y hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation
(administration may be o ral, injectable, or implantable)
intrauterine device
intrauterine hormone -releasing s ystem
combination of male condom with cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide
(double barrier methods)
bilateral tubal ligation or occlusion

All subjects will be strongl y advised that they should not become pregnant wh ile on study  
treatment or for 12weeks (3 months) after the last dose. A female subject will be advised 
that she must report immediatel y to the study site for pregnancy testing and appropriate

Page 148of 185APPENDIX 2: SPECIFIC GUIDANCE FOR STUDY CONDUCT AND SUBJECT 
SAFETY DURING THE COVID -19 PANDEMIC
This guidance applies during the COVID- 19 pandemic, as defined by  regional and/or 
local authorities. The updates summarized below are relevant to the referenced sections 
of the protocol.
Section 5.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment
During the COVID -19 pandemic, additional risks to participants may  exist, including 
generalenvironmental risks (e .g.being outside the home, possible contact with 
unsanitized surfaces) and study -related activities (e .g.interaction with study  staff). 
Potential new subjects with known or suspected COVID -19 infection are ineligible for 
study  enrolment until the infection has resolved. Furthermore, potential new subjects in a 
high-risk population for COVID -19 (e.g. 60 y ears and older or with comorbidities), 
should be temporaril y deferred until the COVID -19 risk has subsided at the location of 
the enrolling site, according to investigator judgement. Risk mitigation measures to be 
implemented for enrolled subjects and for new subjects during the COVID -19 pandemic 
are detailed in Additional Measures for Subjects Amidst COVID- 19 Pandemic below. 
Subjects with a known or suspected COVID -19 infection will immediately discontinue 
study  drug; instructions for resuming treatment are described in Section 8.4.2 . Known or 
suspected COVID -19 infection will also be followed as an AESI.
New Subsection to Section 7.1, Overall Study Design and Plan:
Additional Measures for Subjects Amidst COVID- 19 Pandemic
All investigational sites should act according to applicable site regulations, to 
guidelines and restrictions implemented by  local authorities, and to best practices 
for conducting clinical research during the COVID- 19 pandemic. 
-Guidance for New Subjects:
Best practices currently in place must be followed when evaluating eligibility  of 
subjects to participate in the study  during the COVID -19 pandemic.
For potential subjects in a high -risk population for COVID -19 as defined by  the 
American Academy  of Dermatology  (AAD)1(e.g. 60 years and older or with

CONFIDENTIAL
Page 149of 185comorbidities) or local guidelines, deferring participation in the study  should be 
considered. Deferment of enrollment is based on the potential risk posed by 
general environmental risks (e.g. being ou tside home, possible contact with 
unsanitized surfaces) and study -related activities (e.g. interaction with study  
staff).
For potential subjects in the low- risk population for COVID -19 (e.g. less than 60 
years of age and without comorbidities), the risks a nd benefits of participation in 
the study  should be assessed on a case by  case basis. 
If at the time of screening, in the opinion of the Investigator, the subject will not 
be willing and able to reach the investigational site and comply  with all of the 
time commitments and requirements of the clinical study protocol, the subject 
should not be considered for enrolment. The subject may  be rescreened at a later 
time.
Pre-screening phone calls should be conducted to exclude potential 
candidates/subjects who di splay  possible s ymptoms of COVID -19 or are at high 
risk of having been exposed to COVID-19.
-Guidance for Enrolled Subjects:
If the local situation allows for subjects to reach the clinical investigational site 
and complete all study  procedures, the fol lowing measures should be taken:
-Implement and document in the subject records regular 
communication with the subject between visits to attempt to ensure 
early detection of potential signs/s ymptoms of COVID -19 infection, 
and provide adequate advice, as per local medical practice and publi c 
health guidelines for suspected COVID -19 infection. Please refer to 
the Centers for Disease Control (CDC; https://www.cdc.gov/ 
coronavirus/2019 -ncov/sy mptoms -testing/s ymptoms.html)/European 
CDC (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid- 19/questions-
answers )/local disease prevention agency  and applicable local 
guidelines for assessment of subjects’ COVID -19 status.
- Following the same guidelines, implement and document in the 
subject records an additional communication to the subject just before 
the scheduled v isit.

Page 150of 185-Discontinue study  drug administration in case of confirmed or 
suspected COVID -19 infection until the infection is resolved. See 
Section 8.4.2 .
-Report an y COVID -19 infection (confirmed or suspected) as an AE :
if any  seriousness criterion is met, also report as an SAE
(see Section 12.7.4).
if it occurs during the clinical study  following the first 
dose of study  drug administration, also report as an AESI  
(see Section 12.7.5).
-Implement preventive infection control measures against COVID -19 
infection following local guidelines (e. g.good h ygiene practice, clean 
techniques, and use of personal protective equipment such as gl oves, 
goggles, and masks) .
-Implement preventive measures in handling all subject -facing study -
mandated assessment devices and parts: 
PEF meter device bod y is to be cleaned after each use, with 
recommended wipes, as per user manual 
PEF meter flow sensor is to be disposed of after each set of 
measurements is taken
Approved bacterial/virus filters may  be used; if used, they  
must be disposed of after each set of measurements is taken
Offer protective gloves to subjects for use while filling out 
assessments on a tablet and provide training on h ygienic 
removal and disposal of gloves
If the local situation allows for subjects to reach the investigational site and 
complete only  some study  procedures where visit duration needs to be limited, 
the above measures a lso apply . All assessments should be conducted if possible. 
Subject -reported assessments that would usually be collected on the site tablet

exposure to COVI D-19, the site considers tha t:
-The study  drug subcutaneous injection can be performed at the 
investigational site according to the instructions in the protocol, 
pharmacy  manual and instruction for use, including preparation of 
study  drug b y an independent pharmacist or other qualified personnel.
-ACT (f or subjects with a medical history  of asthma )and PEF (for all 
subjects) can be performed according to the protocol. 
Exceptionally , if sites cannot perform PEF safel y on site, the 
subjects should perform it at home prior to the onsite visit, on 
the same day . See section below for remote PEF testing 
instructions.
-All other safet y assessments are to be performed as per protocol: 
physical exam, vital signs, ECG, laboratory  assessments, pregnancy  
test, monitoring of AEs and concomitant medications. 
-All missing assessments should be appropriatel y documented with 
COVID -19 recorded as the reason, where applicable.
If the local situation does not allow for subjects to reach the investigational site:

PEF results
Note: For remote PEF measurements the following should be 
done:
-To prepare subjects to do remote PEF measurement at 
home in case it is needed during the course of the study , 
all subjects should be previously  trained onsite. 
-During the remote visits, subjects can re ceive additional 
support (if needed) over the phone or video call b y site 
staff when performing PEF 
-If a subject has a PEF <80% of the predicted value:
Site staff can try  to evaluate whether this is due to 
poor technique and ask the subject to repeat the set 
of measurements
If the subject’s best PEF measurement is still 
<80% of the predicted value or if there are other 
concerns regarding the subject’s respiratory  health, 
refer to appropriate ph ysician and report an AESI 
(see Section 12.7.5)
-All laboratory  samples should be collected at the site and anal yzed at 
the central lab. Only  in exceptional situations when subject safet y 
cannot be assured otherwise and subject cannot reach the site, a local 
laboratory test (i.e. hematology , blood chemistry , urinaly sis) can be 
performed and reported, based on investigator judgement. 
-Subject -reported assessments that would usually  be collected on the 
site tablet (e.g. ACT, PGAD, PGAT , EQ-5D, DLQI , and PN-
associated pain frequency  and intensit y) may  be completed over the 
phone, as available. (See Appendix 20for EQ -5D remote version.)

Page 153of 185If a subject misses a dose of study drug due to the COVID -19 pandemic, study drug 
administration may  be continued. The following dosing schedules appl y. 
For subjects with a missed dose(s) during the treatment period, study  drug administration 
can be continued based on one of the following scenarios (see also Diagram 1, below ):
1) Subject has missed one or more doses between Baseline and Week 16 but can 
come to the clinical site at Week 16 (see also Diagram 2a):
- Subjects who complete theWeek 16 visit may be eligible to enroll in the 
long-term extension (L TE) study  RD.06.SPR.202699 after the Week 24 
visit is complete .
-Subjects who required rescue therap y before Week 16 may be considered 
for the LTE stud y but will be required to continu e with study  visits until 
Week 24 visit is due.
2) Subject has no missed doses through Week 12 but cannot reach the clinical site at 
Week 1 6 (see also Diagram 2b):
-The Week 16 visit can be delay ed by up to 4weeks from the originally  
planned date . A remote Unscheduled visit should be planned between 
Week 12 and the delay ed Week 16 visit for safet y follow -up. W eek 20 and 
Week 24 visits should be delay ed by the same amount of time as the W eek 
16 visit.
oSubjects who complete the rescheduled Week 16 visit may be 
eligible to enroll in the LTE study after the Week 24 visit is 
complete .
-If the subject still cannot come to the delay ed Week 16 visit within 4
weeks of the originally  planned date, the delay ed Week 16 visit should be 
performed remotel y at the rescheduled date as an earl y termination visit. A 
remote Unscheduled visit should be planned between Week 12 and the 
delay ed Week 16 visit for safet y follow -up. The Week 20 and Week 24 
visits will be cancelled. Thesubject may  be considered for rollover into 
the L TE study  after the Week 24 timepoint is reached .
3) Subject has missed one or more doses between Baseline and Week 16 and cannot 
reach the clinical site at Week 16:

Page 154of 185-For subjects who cannot come to the clinical site at week 12 but with an 
administered dose at Week 8 (with or without Week 4), the Week 12 visit 
can be delay ed up to 3 weeks, and the Week 16 visit can be delay ed up to 
4 weeks from the rescheduled W eek 12 v isit(see also Diagram 2c). Week 
20 and W eek 24 visits should be delay ed by the same amount of time as 
the W eek 16 visit.
- For subjects with an administered dose at week 12 but with a missed dose 
at Week 4 and/or Week 8, the Wee k 16 visit can be delay ed by up to 4 
weeks from the originally planned date (see also Diagram 2d).
oSubjects who complete the rescheduled Week 16 visit may  be 
eligible to enroll in LTE study after the Week 24 visit is complete .
- For subjects with a missed dose at week 12, the Week 16 visit will be 
performed remotel y at W eek 16 ( cannot be delay ed) as an earl y 
termination visit. The Week 20 and Week 24 visits will be cancelled. T he 
subject may  be considered for rollover into the LTE study  after the Week 
24 timepoint is reached (see also Diagram 2d).
In all scenarios, study  drug can be administered provided that there is a minimum 3 -week 
interval between injections. If a subject cannot come to a planned visit due to COVI D-19, 
the vis it should be conducted remotel y according to Additional Measures for Subjects 
Amidst COVID -19 Pandemic . If a subject misses 3 consecutive doses of study  drug, an 
early termination visit should be conducted. Subject may  still be eligible to participate in 
the LTE.Enrolment of subjects into the L TE study  must be done in accordance with the 
LTE stud y protocol. Subjects who decline or are not eligible to enter into the LTE study  
will complete a follow -up visit 12 weeks after the last study  drug injection.
16.5 Monitoring
On-site interim monitoring visits may  not be feasible during COVID -19 restrictions; 
therefore, remote monitoring will be completed until on- site monitoring can be conducted 
again. Site monitoring activity  will compl y with the processes doc umented within the 
COVID -19 Site Management Risk Assessment Form.

Protocol Title:
Open -Label Continuation Treatment Study with Levodopa -Carbidopa Intestinal Gel in Subjects wit h 
Advanced Parkinson's Disease and Severe Motor -Fluctuations Who Have Exhibited a Persistent and 
Positive Effect to Treatment in Previous Studies
Study Center(s) (Planned):
Approximately 70
Study Duration:
The protocol duration is planned until the finished product is available commercially in the respective 
countries where subjects are participating in the study.  The expected protocol duration w ill continue 
through successful NDA and subsequent approval (approximately 4 years).  The protocol durati on will 
be extended 4 years in the UK from the approval date of Amendment 3.01.  If it is deemed necessary to 
continue treatment after 4 years in the UK, either an amendment will be made to the current protocol 
or a new protocol will be submitted.
Objecti ves:
The primary objective is to provide continued access to subjects who would like to continue 
Levodopa -Carbidopa Intestinal Gel (LCIG), after completion of an open -label study (S187.3.003 or 
S187.3.004).
The secondary objectives are to assess the long -term safety and tolerability of the LCIG therapeutic 
system, and to assess the maintenance of efficacy using data collected from US subjects.
Methodology:
This is a Phase 3B, open -label, multi -center, study.  Subjects w ill be provided w ith LCIG, if judged 
medically indicated and if it is not commercially available.  Data collected w ill be for evaluation of safety 
and efficacy, and for periodic assessment of the continued appropriateness of the subject's participation in 
the study.  The decision to continue is based on the Principal Investigator's clinical judgment.
Number of Subjects (Planned):
It is anticipated that approximately 275 subjects who had participated and completed one of the 
open -label LCIG clinical trials w ill be eligible for this continued treatment with LCIG, until it is 
commercially available.

Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:
In order to be eligible to participate in this study, subjects must meet the following criteria:
1.The subject should have completed participation in Stud y S187.3.003 or S187.3.004; and, in the 
opinion of the Principal Investigator, w ould benefit from long -term treatment with LCIG.  For 
Canada, subjects w ill be allowed to participate in the S187.3.005 study with a minimum of 
6months of exposure to LCIG in the S187.3.004 study.
2.The subject must be able to understand the nature of the study and must provide w ritten informed 
consent prior to the conduct of any study related procedures.  If the subject does not have the 
capacity to provide informed consent, full informed consent must be obtained from the subject's 
legally authorized representative.  Consenting will be performed according to local regulations.
Main Criteria for Exclusion:
Subjects meeting any of the exclusion criteria listed below  at Baseline must be excluded from 
participation in the study. 
1.Medical, laboratory, psychiatric, or surgical issues deemed by the Investigator to be clinically 
significant, and which could interfere with the subject's par ticipation in the study.
Investigational Product, Dose and Mode of Adm inistration:
LCIG is a homogenous suspension of levodopa (20 mg/mL) and carbidopa monohydrate (5 mg/mL) in an 
aqueous intestinal gel (carboxymethylcellulose).  LCIG (levodopa [20 mg/mL] and carbidopa 
monohydrate [5 mg/mL]) is delivered to the proximal small intestine through a jejunal extension tube 
inserted via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG -J).  The intestinal gel is dispensed in a 
medication cassette reservoir of 100 mL, des igned to be connected to a portable subject -operated pump.  
LCIG infusion is administered over a full 16 -hour period.  The gel will be administered as one morning 
dose, follow ed by  continuous infusion for the remainder of the 16 -hour period.  In addition t o the 
morning dose and the continuous infusion, subjects w ill be allow ed to self -administer additional doses of 
LCIG to address immediate subjective needs, such as the deterioration of motor function.  It is 
recommended that no more than five extra doses a re given per day.  If subjects find it necessary to 
self-administer an increasing number of extra doses (> five/day) of LCIG, they will be instructed to 
contact their physician for appropriate follow -up care (adjustment of continuous infusion) as needed.  At 
night, after disconnecting the pump, the tubing is flushed with potable w ater.
Duration of Treatm ent:
In countries where LCIG is not commercially available, the treatment will be made available to subjects 
who complete participation in either LCIG open -label Study S187.3.003 or S187.3.004.  Such product 
will be made available by the Sponsor in accordance with all local regulations as long as such is 
warranted by the therapeutic benefit.  The latter w ill be determined in consultancy with the responsible 
neurologist, the subject and the Sponsor.  Subjects who continue to receive study drug will be evaluated 
at least semi- annually by the Investigator.  In cooperation with the investigational site, all necessary 
support w ill be provided by the Sponsor's loca l representatives.
Reference Therapy, Dose and Mode of Adm inistration:
Not applicable.

5.0 Introduction
The combination of levodopa/carbidopa continues to be a mainstay  in the treatment of 
Parkinson's disease (PD).1-4  Levodopa relieves s ymptoms of PD following 
decarbox ylation to dopamine in the brain.  Carbidopa, which does not cross the blood 
brain barrier, inhibits the extracerebral decarbox ylation of levodopa, which means that a 
larger amount of levodopa becomes available for transportation to the brain and 
transformation into dopamine.  Without the simultaneous administration of carbidopa, 
much larger amounts of levodopa would be required to achieve the desired effect.
In advanced stages of PD, patients treated with oral levodopa may  develop s evere motor 
fluctuations characterized by  unpredictable swings from mobility  to immobility  ("on -off" 
phenomenon) leading to significant difficulties in disease management.  Patients with 
advanced PD continue to experience significant s ymptoms despite an in crease in the dose 
or frequency  of oral administration of levodopa; likely , this is a combined result of the 
short half -life of levodopa and the unpredictable variability  of gastric empty ing.  Patients 
can also experience troublesome involuntary movements or dy skinesias during "On" 
periods so that they  cycle between on periods with dy skinesia and "Off" periods with 
Parkinsonism.5  Accordingl y, patients with advanced disease suffer severe disability  
despite current levodopa treatment.  However, there is increasing evidence that continuous 
infusion of levodopa can reduce both off time and dyskinesia.1,6
The motor fluctuations and dyskinesias after oral intake of levodopa may  be explained by  
an underl ying progression of the disease with gradual disappearance of dopaminergic 
Levodopa -Carbidopa

16
neurons in the brain.  When approaching a certain threshold of degeneration of 
dopaminergic and other neurons, an individuals' capacit y to store dopamine in the brain 
and ability  to respond to levodopa becomes increasingl y unstable.  It has been 
hypothesized that the therapeutic plasma levodopa concentration window becomes 
increasingl y narrow over time.  As a result there is an insufficient response 
(Parkinsonism) when the levodopa concentration is below the window, and troublesome 
dyskinesias occur when the concentration increases above an upper threshold for the 
individual.  The inciden ce of motor fluctuations and dy skinesias among patients treated 
with oral levodopa/carbidopa varies between 20% and 50% of the patients in different 
studies.3,4
Various approaches have been taken to cope with the increasingl y unstable levodopa 
response.  Manipulations of levodopa dose are t ypically  not effective.  Dopamine agonists 
may be of some value, but are not adequate in advanced cases.  Oral formulations of 
levodopa are often prescrib ed in combination with long -acting dopamine agonists and 
catechol -O-methy ltransferase (COMT) inhibitors.7  However, de spite individually  
optimizing treatment with these conventional medications, patients with advanced PD 
often do not experience adequate control of their motor performance.  Therefore, 
additional treatment strategies are needed for these patients.  A number of approaches 
have been explored and utilized with vary ing degrees of success; they  include the 
continuous intravenous (IV) administration of levodopa1,8-10and deep brain stimulation 
(DBS).11  Due to issues of te chnical and logistic feasibility , continuous administration of 
intravenous (IV) levodopa has not received wide application.  DBS has been used in the 
treatment of advanced PD patients and has demonstrated improvement of motor 
fluctuations in this patient p opulation, but severe complications have been reported in a 
substantial number of patients; the procedure is not available in all settings, it is 
expensive, and not all PD patients are candidates for brain surgery.12
Almost three decades ago, it was clearl y demonstrated that constant -rate delivery  
(infusion) of levodopa to the blood markedl y stabilized motor performance in advanced 
PD patients.9,10,13

LCIG is a suspension of levodopa:carbidopa (4:1) in an aqueous gel 
(carbox ymethylcellulose) with a viscosity  that permits homogeneous distribution of 
micronized substan ce particles.  On upper -intestinal administration, the compounds are 
dissolved in situ and levodopa is rapidly  absorbed by  an active carrier mechanism 
localized in the proximal small intestine.  L CIG provides continuous rather than 
intermittent stimulation of the dopaminergic receptors in the brain by permitting plasma 
concentrations of levodopa to be kept within the individual's therapeutic window.  When 
delivered via continuous intestinal infusion therapy, LCIG reduces the motor fluctuations 
and increases the "On" -time for patients with advanced PD who have received oral tablet 
treatment with levodopa/decarbox ylase inhibitor for many  years.  The motor fluctuations 
and hy per-/dyskinesias are reduced when plasma concentrations of levodopa are kept 
within the individual therapeutic window.  Therapeutic effects on motor fluctuations and 
hyper-/dyskinesias are often achieved during the first treatment day .
The delivery  of LCIG directly to the proximal small intestine is anticipated to result in the 
following:1,2,13,14
●Continuous delivery  of levodopa -carbidopa
●Avoidance of the effects of pulsatile gastric empt ying
●Reduced variability  in plasma -levodopa concentrations
●Decreased motor fluctuations and dy skinesias
LCIG is d elivered to the proximal small intestine through a catheter inserted via 
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostom y –with jejunal extension tube (PEG -J).  The LCIG 
is dispensed in medication cassette reservoirs.  The contents of the medication cassette 
reservoir are delivered via continuous administration as illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Levodopa -Carbidopa Intestinal Gel Infusion System
The principle aim of LCIG treatment is to continuously  infuse levodopa and carbidopa 
directly  into the proximal small intestine (the duodenum and/or jejunum), where it is 
absorbed b y a carrier -mediated mechanism.  Absorption problems related to erratic gastric
empty ing, earl y metabolism, and competitive inhibition of intestinal absorption by large 
neutral amino acids will be markedly reduced allowing levodopa to be rapidly absorbed 
into the bloodstream.  I t has been demonstrated that an upper -intestinal infusio n of 
levodopa is associated with reduced variability in plasma levodopa concentrations as 
compared to oral formulations of levodopa/carbidopa.13
The efficacy  of upper -intestinal administration of levodopa has been demonstrated in 
clinical investigations b y decreasing motor fluctuations compared to standard oral 
therap y.  Results of a 3 -week open -label cross -over study  (NPP-001-02), with blinded 
assessments of efficacy , demonstrated clinical and statistical superiority  of L CIG 
compared to standard oral therap y with regard to motor fluctuations.2,15  Patients also 
reported significantly  improved scores in two Quality  of Life (QoL) instruments, the 
Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ -39) and EuroQol Quality  of Life Scale 
(EQ-5D).2
This open -label, multi -center, Phase 3B study  will provide continued treatment with 
LCIG to subjects who have alread y participated in an open -label treatment study  with the 
same treatment (S187.3.003 or S187.3.004).  In countries where L CIGis not y et available 

Levodopa -Carbidopa
S187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2008 -001329 -33
19
commerciall y, the treatment will be made available by the Sponsor in accordance with all 
local regulations as long as such is warranted b y the therapeutic benefit.  The latter will be 
determined in consultancy with the responsible neu rologist, the subject and the Sponsor.  
Subjects who continue to receive study drug will be evaluated at least semi -annually  by 
the Investigator.  In cooperation with the investigational site, all necessary  support will be 
provided b y the Sponsor's local r epresentatives.  Additionally , the study will allow for 
observation of the long -term safety, tolerability, and maintenance of efficacy of L CIG 
administered for several years in a more naturalistic treatment environment.
6.0 Study  Objectives
6.1 Primary  Objective
The primary  objective of this study  is to provide, under well -controlled conditions, 
continued access to L CIG treatment to subjects who have alread y participated in an 
open -label efficacy  and safety trial with the same treatment (Stud y S187.3.003 or 
S187.3. 004), and in whom the need for such continuation is indicated, as confirmed b y 
periodic evaluation, until the product is commercially  available.
6.2 Secondary  Objectives
To assess the long -term safet y and tolerability of the L CIG therapeutic s ystem, and to 
assess the maintenance of efficacy using data collected from US subjects.
Safety  and tolerability  will be assessed b y the following:
●Physical examination, including weight
●Neurological examination
●Vital signs
●Resting ECGs
●Columbia Suicide -Severity  Rating Scale (C -SSRS)
●Clinical laboratory  assessments including biochemistry , hematology , 
urinaly sis, and special labs to monitor for vitamin deficiencies
Levodopa -Carbidopa
S187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2008 -001329 -33
20
●Concomitant medication usage
●Adverse event monitoring, including for the developmen t of sleep attacks,  
melanoma, or excessive impulsive behavior
●Monitoring complications of the infusion device
●Tolerability  assessed b y number of subjects who complete the study
Maintenance of efficacy  will be assessed b y evaluating the mean change from b aseline in 
the following:
●Off time, On time with troublesome dyskinesia and On time without 
troublesome dy skinesia as measured by  the Parkinson's Disease Diary
●UPDRS total score, Parts I , II, III and IV scores, and dy skinesia item score
●PDQ -39 summary  index and domain scores
For the anal ysis of change from baseline in efficacy measures, each subject's baseline will 
be their baseline measure in the first L CIG study  in which they  participated 
(e.g., Study S187.3.001, S187.3.002 or S187.3.004).
7.0 Study  Design
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan Description
This is a Phase 3B, open -label, multi -center stud y of the long -term safet y and tolerability 
of LCIG in the continuation of treatment of approximately  275 advanced Parkinson's 
disease subjects with a good therape utic response on L CIG with regard to the treatment of 
persistent severe motor fluctuations.  The study  will be conducted at approximately  
70centers.  In addition, maintenance of efficacy  will be evaluated at approximately  28 US 
sites.
Only  subjects who ha ve completed Study  S187.3.003 or S187.3.004 will qualify  for 
enrollment in this study .  Following informed consent, subjects will have their 
inclusion/exclusion criteria assessed prior to beginning treatment in this study.  Subjects 
are allowed to have a c aregiver, if appropriate, assist them with study  requirements,

S187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2008 -001329 -33
21
i.e.,care of the pump and tubing, etc. and the caregiver will have been trained 
accordingl y.
The initial L CIG dose will be identical to the dose that the subject was receiving at the 
end of th e previous open -label L CIG study .  Subsequent dose adjustments will be made as 
clinically  indicated by  the Investigator.
In this open -label stud y, a recommendation will be made to Investigators to withhold 
concomitant PD treatments if deemed medically  safe and clinically  appropriate.  The 
initiation of additional PD medication may  be medically  indicated and is allowed at the 
discretion of the Investigator.  Also, the dosages of these other PD medications can be 
adjusted upward or downward as needed based on the status of the subject's condition or 
the development of adverse effects; resumption of discontinued PD medications may also 
be necessary .
In addition to the morning dose and the continuous infusion, subjects will be allowed to 
self-administer addition al doses of L CIG to address immediate subjective needs, such as 
the deterioration of motor function.  If subjects find it necessary to self -administer an 
increasing number of extra doses (> five/day) of LCI G, they  will be instructed to contact 
the Investig ator for appropriate follow -up care (adjustment of continuous infusion) as 
needed. 
Subject visit day s should ideally  match the target clinic visit day s; however, a 14 -day visit 
window will be allowed as necessary .  Attempt should be made to bring the subj ect back 
on the target visit day .
The final visit in the previous open -label LCIG study  will provide baseline assessments 
for the S1878.3.005 study.  Subjects will be reassessed every  6 months for the 
appropriateness of the continuation of treatment with L CIG.  If the subject is deemed 
inappropriate for continued treatment b y the Investigator, the subject would be 
discontinued from treatment and the PEG -J will be removed, with a follow -up visit

22
occurring 1 week later.  For subjects who elect not to continue LCIG treatment, the PEG -J 
will be removed, and a follow -up clinic visit will occur 1 week later.
Safety  assessments should include phy sical examination, neurological exam, orthostatic 
vital signs, weight, adverse event monitoring, assessment of impulsive behavior and sleep 
attacks, melanoma check, electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical hematology , biochemistry , 
special labs to monitor for vitamin deficiencies, and urinaly sis.
The following efficacy assessments will be completed at US sites: 
●Parkinson's Disease Diary©assessment of motor state completed for the 
3consecutive day s prior to each clinic visit (excluding the drug dispensation 
visits),
●Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), and 
●Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire -39 (PDQ -39).
At each visit, complications or adverse events with the infusion device (i.e., the tubing 
system and the pump) will also be recorded and reported.  Tube placement will be 
checked b y radiograph y if there is a clinical indication that the tube has been displaced.  
The tube will be repositioned, if needed, to the original placement site just beyond the 
ligament of Treitz.  At each visit the tube insertion site, including the stoma, will also be 
inspected.  On a yearly basis, at a minimum, an assessment will be made of the need for a 
replacement of the PEG -J.  The frequency  of replacement should be in accordance with 
local practice.
The protocol duration is planned until the finished product is available commerciall y in 
the respective countries where subjects are partic ipating in the study .  The expected 
protocol duration will continue through successful NDA and subsequent approval 
(approximately  4 years).  The protocol duration will be extended 4 years in the UK from 
the approval date of Amendment 3.01.  If it is deemed necessary to continue treatment 
after 4 years in the UK, either an amendment to the current protocol will be made or a 
new protocol will be submitted.

9.0 Removal of Subjects from Therapy  or A ssessment
All subjects are free to withdraw from participation in the study at an y time, for an y 
reason, specified or unspecified, a nd without penalty  or loss of benefits to which the 
subject is otherwise entitled.
The Study  Termination eCRF must be completed for all subjects who have entered the 
study  (i.e., have signed informed consent form), including those subjects who drop out 
prior to study  drug administration.
In case of earl y termination of the subject from the study, the primary reason for this earl y 
termination is to be indicated according to the following definitions:
●Adverse event:  Discontinuation due to an y AE with a corre sponding entry 
reflected on the Adverse Events eCRF.
●Lack of efficacy :  Subject fails to continue to respond to the study  drug at an 
acceptable level, where the subject or the Investigator feels it is in the best 
interest of the subject to seek another treatment.
●Lost to follow -up:  The subject fails to return for scheduled visits and does not 
respond to telephone or written attempts to contact.
●Withdrew consent:  Subject decides to stop his/her participation in the study 
for an y reason other than an AE, or is unable to complete the study  as 
described in the clinical study  protocol (e.g., subject is relocating).
●Administrative:  The Sponsor decides to terminate an individual subject or 
decides to discontinue the study (either at the study site or the entire study ),
(e.g., general safet y problems leading the Sponsor to stop the study  entirel y).
●Protocol violation:  Any thing which is in direct violation of the protocol 
(e.g., inclusion/exclusion violation).  All protocol violations are to be 
discussed with the Sponsor prior to the subject being discontinued from the 
study , or as soon as possible in case urgent safety  reasons prohibit such 
discussion.

10.0 Treatments
Study  drug and devices will only  be shipped to Investigators who have provided the 
Sponsor (or an authorized representative) with all required documents, including IEC/IRB 
approval, and have signed a Clinical Trial Agreement.
10.1 Treatment to be A dministered
Subjects will self -administer Levodopa Carbidopa I ntestinal Gel (LCIG).  In countries 
where LCIG is not y et available commercially, the treatment will be made available by  
the Sponsor in accordance with all local regulations as long as such is warranted by the 
therapeutic benefit.
The chemical nomenclature for levodopa is ( -)-3-(3,4-dihydroxy phen yl)-L-a lanine.  The 
chemical name for carbidopa is ( -)-L-α- hydrazino -3,4-dihydroxy-α-methy lhydrocinnamic 
acid monohy drate.  LCIG for upper -intestinal infusion is a suspension of 
levodopa:carbidopa in an aqueous gel (carbox ymethylcellulose).
10.1.1 LCIG
LCIG is supplied as a homogeneous suspension of levodopa (20 mg/mL) and carbidopa 
(5mg/mL) in an aqueous intestinal gel (carbox ymethycellulose).  The intestinal gel is 
dispensed in a medication cassette reservoir of 100 mL , designed to be connected to a 
portable subject-o perated pump.  L CIG is administered over approximately  16 waking 
hours.  At night, after disconnecting the pump for sleeping, the tubing is flushed with 
potable water.
The total daily  dose of infusion will be composed of three components:  the morning dose , 
the continuous maintenance infusion dose, and extra doses given as needed.
10.1.2 Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy
The gastric port of the PEG -J is not to be used for the delivery  of nutrition and/or other 
medications unless judged medically necessary follow ing consultation with the Medical 
Levodopa -Carbidopa

26
Monitor.  I f the tube must be used for nutrition and/or other medications, it is imperative 
that they  are delivered only  through the gastric port and not the jejunal port.  The gastric 
port must be properl y flushed and mai ntained if it is used for this purpose.
There may  be a need to replace the PEG -J tube during the stud y.  The frequency of 
change will depend on the condition of the tube and local clinical practice.
10.1.3 Maintenance of LCIG Infusion Sy stem
Refer to the Study  Reference Manual for a detailed description of the care and 
maintenance of the pump, the PEG -J, and the stoma site.
10.1.4 Removal of the PEG -J
Institutional standards for follow -up care after removal of the PEG -J should be followed.  
To remove the tube, the tube s hould be cut at skin -level.  The internal disc and the 
remaining tube must be retrieved b y endoscope.
10.2 Packaging and Labeling
The medication will be packaged in accordance with the applicable local and federal 
regulations and Good Manufacturing Practices (G MP).
The medication cassette reservoirs of LCIG and the box containing seven (7) medication 
cassette reservoirs will be labeled with all information as required b y local regulations.  
All labels must remain affixed to the primary  and secondary  packaging ma terial.
10.3 Ordering, Storage and Dispensing of Medication and Device
All clinical drug supplies are to be stored at each investigational site in a secure, 
limited -access area according to the label storage conditions.  The I nvestigator or 
pharmacist/designee will maintain accurate records of the receipt and disposition of all 
clinical medication supplies received during the study.  These records shall include the 
amounts of drug supplies and the dates on which drug supplies were received from the 
Sponsor (or a n authorized representative), dispensed to the subject, returned by  the subject 
Levodopa -Carbidopa
S187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2008 -001329 -33
27
and returned to the Sponsor (or an authorized representative).  If errors or damages in the 
clinical drug supply  shipments occur, the Investigator or pharmacist/designee must 
contact the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) immediatel y.
All clinical devices (e.g., pumps and tubing) are to be stored in a secure, limited -access 
area.  The Investigator will maintain accurate records of the receipt and disposition of all 
clinical device supplies received during the study.  These records shall include the number 
of clinical devices and the dates on which devices were received from the Sponsor (or an 
authorized representative), dispensed to the subject, returned b y the subject and returned 
to the Sponsor (or an authorized representative).  If errors or damages in the clinical 
device shipments occur, the Investigator must contact the Sponsor (or an authorized 
representative) immediately .
Subjects will receive study medication at the Baseline visits, and regular 6 month clinical 
visits.  I n addition, subjects do need to come into the clinic or pharmacy  for clinical 
supply  visits every  6 weeks (± 7 day s), so that there is no risk of medication expiring.  
Other assessments may  be comple ted during these visits if required.  When scheduling the 
6 weekl y drug dispensing visits, the site should always refer back to the baseline visit.  
Every  attempt should be made to bring the subject back on the original targeted dates 
(±7days).
At the dis tribution depots, the cassettes with the suspension can be stored in the freezer 
(between –15°C and –25°C) for up to 2 y ears.  After thawing, the suspension can be 
stored in a refrigerator (between 2°C and 8°C) for up to 15 weeks.  Thawed L CIG 
suspension s hould notbe refrozen.  All stud y medication should be used within 16 hours 
after removal from the refrigerator.
10.4 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
All subjects will receive LCIG.

EudraCT 2008 -001329 -33
28
10.5 Selection of Doses in the Study
Subject dosing will be indivi dually  optimized.  The L CIG infusion is expected to infuse 
over 16 hours with a rate of infusion within the range of 1 to 10 mL /hour (20 to 200 mg of 
levodopa/hour) in most instances.
10.6 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Initial subject dosing will be based on the dosing regimen that the subject received during 
the previous open -label LCIG study .
The timing (time of day , interval) of dosing and specific instructions to subjects about 
when or how to take the dose(s) are described below.  No restr ictions are given with 
relation to the time of dosing relative to meals.
10.6.1 LCIG Infusion
The total dose/day  of LCIG is composed of three individually  adjusted doses:  the 
morning dose, the continuous maintenance dose and extra doses 
The infusion dose will c ontinue to be individually  optimized for each subject during the 
study , by the Investigator, based on response and potential adverse events.  The rate of 
infusion is expected to be within the range of 1 to 10 mL /hour (20 to 200 mg of 
levodopa/hour) in most instances.  The infusion will run over approximately 16 hours.  
The PEG -J is to be disconnected from the infusion pump at bedtime.  Extra doses of 
LCIG can be used to help control fluctuations in the subject's PD symptoms.
Morning Dose:
The morning dose i s administered as a bolus infusion by  the pump to fill the dead space of 
the intestinal tube and rapidly  achieve the therapeutic dose level (within 10 to 
30minutes).  The total morning dose is usuall y 5 to 10 mL , corresponding to 100 to 
200mg levodopa.
Levodopa -Carbidopa
S187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2008 -001329 -33
29
The total morning dose will usually  not exceed 15 mL  (300 mg levodopa).  However, 
there may  be some exceptions to these recommendations based on the Investigator's 
clinical judgment.
Continuous Maintenance Dose:
The maintenance dose is adjustable in steps o f 2 mg/hour (0.1 mL/hour).  When 
supplementary  medicines are discontinued or added to the treatment regimen, the L CIG 
dose should be adjusted.  The continuous maintenance dose is adjusted individually .  It 
should be kept within a range of 1 to 10 mL/hour ( 20 to 200 mg levodopa/hour) and is 
usually  2 to 6 mL /hour (40 to 120 mg levodopa/hour).  In exceptional cases, a higher dose 
may be needed based on the I nvestigator's clinical judgment.
Example:
Daily  intake of levodopa as L CIG:  1640 mg/day
Morning dose: 140 mg = 7 mL
Continuous maintenance dose thereafter:  1500 mg/day
1500 mg/day  at 20 mg/mL = 75 mL  LCIG per day
The intake is calculated over 16 hours:  75 mL /16 hours = 4.7 mL /hour.
Extra Infusion Doses:
Subjects will be allowed to self -administer extra doses of L CIG to address immediate 
medical needs, such as the rapid deterioration of motor function.  Extra doses may be 
given as required if the subject becomes h ypokinetic during the day.  The extra dose 
should be adjusted individually , normall y 0.5 to 2 .0 mL .  In rare cases, a higher dose may  
be needed.  If the need for extra doses exceeds five per day, consideration should be given 
to increasing the maintenance dose.  Additionally, fine adjustments of the morning dose, 
the maintenance dose and extra dos es can be made as needed.
During treatment, Investigator consideration should be given to instances in which 
deterioration of treatment response occurs.  In the absence of pump alarm notifications, a 
sudden deterioration in treatment response with recurrin g motor fluctuations could be the

EudraCT 2008 -001329 -33
30
result of the distal part of the tube becoming displaced from the upper intestine into the 
stomach.  The location of the tube should be determined radiographically.  If necessary, 
the end of the tube can be repositioned to the proximal small intestine and the new 
placement confirmed radiographicall y.
The tube insertion site, including the stoma, should be inspected at each Study Visit.
10.6.2 Post LCIG Infusion Night -Time Treatment
Following the discontinuation of the 16 -hour LCIG infusion, subjects will be permitted to 
self administer their t ypical night -time regimen of levodopa -carbidopa tablets (ty pical 
evening and night -time doses of oral levodopa -carbidopa that they  take on a regular 
basis).   
10.6.3 Oral Rescue Medication
Oral levo dopa -carbidopa medication may  only  be used to supplement treatment at night 
and should NOT be used during the day , except as rescue medication in case of acute 
deterioration presumabl y caused b y failure of the LCIG s ystem such as tubes and/or the 
pump or t he onset of an acute illness.  Extra doses of L CIG should be utilized for these 
symptoms during the L CIG infusion.
Subjects should have a supply  of oral levodopa -carbidopa IR if for some reason they  are 
unable to administer their L CIG infusion.
Oral doses of levodopa -carbidopa taken after the discontinuation of daily  LCIG infusion 
(typical evening and night -time doses of oral levodopa -carbidopa taken on a regular basis) 
will not be counted as rescue medication, as long as the number of tablets taken during 
that period does not exceed what the subject routinely takes during those hours.  If the 
subject requires additional oral doses beyond the routine number of tablets of 
levodopa -carbidopa that are needed as part of the subject's t ypical night -time regimen, 
these additional oral doses should be considered rescue doses.

10.7 Blinding and Treatment Code Information
Not applicable.  The study has onl y one treatment arm.
10.8 Prohibited/Concomitant Medication
Concomitant administration of non -selective MAO inhibitors is no t permitted.  
Furthermore, concomitant administration of selective MAO type A inhibitors is not 
permitted.
Caution is needed in concomitant administration of L CIG with the following medicinal 
products:
Antihy pertensives
Symptomatic postural hypotension has occurred when combinations of levodopa and a 
decarbox ylase inhibitor are added to the treatment of subjects alread y receiving 
antihy pertensives.  Dosage adjustment of the antihy pertensive agent may  be required.
Antidepressants
There have been rare reports of adverse reactions, including h ypertension and dyskinesia, 
resulting from the concomitant administration of tricyclic antidepressants and 
carbidopa/levodopa preparations. 
Anticholinergics
Anticholinergics may  act sy nergistically  with levodopa to decrea se tremor.  However, 
combined use may  exacerbate abnormal involuntary  movements.  Anticholinergics may  
decrease the effects of levodopa by delaying its absorption.  An adjustment of the dose of 
LCIG may  be needed.
Levodopa -Carbidopa
S187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2008 -001329 -33
32
COMT I nhibitors (tolcapone, entacapone)
Concomitant use of COMT (Catechol -O-Meth yl Transferase) inhibitors and L CIG can 
increase the bioavailability  of levodopa.  The dose of L CIG may  need adjustment.
Other Medicinal Products
Dopamine receptor antagonists (some antipsy chotics, e.g., phenothiazines , buty rophenons 
and risperidone and antiemetics, e.g., metoclopramide), benzodiazepines, isoniazide, 
pheny toin and papaverine can reduce the therapeutic effect of levodopa.  Subjects taking 
these medicinal products together with L CIG should be observed car efully for loss of 
therapeutic response.
LCIG can be taken concomitantly  with the recommended dose of a selective MAO t ype B 
inhibitor (for instance selegiline -HCl).  However, concomitant use of selegiline and 
levodopa -carbidopa has been associated with se rious orthostatic hy potension.
Amantadine has s ynergic effect with levodopa and may increase levodopa related adverse 
events.  An adjustment of the dose of LCIG may  be needed.
Sympathicomimetics may  increase cardiovascular adverse events related to levodop a.
Levodopa forms a chelate with iron in the gastrointestinal tract leading to reduced 
absorption of levodopa.
10.9 Treatment Compliance
The Investigator (or designee) must document the amount of study drug dispensed to the 
subject and returned from the subject in the ClinPhone Drug Accountability  (CDA) 
System and on the eCRF.  I n case of discrepancies in the actual amount of study  drug 
returned versus what should have been returned, the subject will provide the Investigator 
(or designee) with an explanation, an d the explanation must be recorded in the CDA 
system and in the source notes.

Drug Accountability
The Investigator (or designee) is accountable for all clinical drug supplies shipped to 
his/her study  site for the duration of the study .  Previously  complete d paper drug 
accountability  logs will not be completed any more, but need to be kept on -site in the 
investigator site file for further reference.  An overall accountability of the study drug will 
be performed and verified by the site and designated monitor throughout the study  and at 
the site close -out visit.  After verification of drug accountability  using the CDA sy stem, 
all clinical drug supplies must be inventoried, accounted for and returned to the drug 
destruction depot.  A final accounting of the clin ical drug supplies will be required at the 
completion/termination of the study .  The Investigator (or designee) is required to provide 
written explanation for any  discrepancies.  All used and unused clinical drug supplies will 
be inventoried and returned to the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) by the site or 
by a designated monitor.
Device Accountabilit y
The Investigator (or designee) is accountable for all investigative devices (e.g., pumps, 
tubing) that were shipped to his/her site for use in the study  (ancillary  supplies).  
Previously  completed paper accountability  logs for ancillary  supplies will not be 
completed an ymore, but need to be kept on -site in the investigator site file for further 
reference.  An overall accountability  of the ancillary  supplies will be performed and 
verified b y the site and monitor throughout the study and at the site close -out visit.  After 
verification of device accountability  using the CDA sy stem, used or expired unused 
devices, with the exclusion of pumps, will be di scarded per the site's institutional policy , 
unless it has been requested to be returned for investigation.  If a device (i.e., tubing, 
cassette, pump) is requested to be returned for further investigation, instructions will be 
provided.  All pumps will be returned using instructions provided.

11.0 Study  Assessments (Criteria for Evaluation) and 
Flow  Chart
Final assessments from the previous open -label LCI G study  will serve as the baseline 
assessments for this study.  All assessments must take place within a win dow of ± 14 day s 
from the scheduled visit day  unless otherwise noted.
In the event a stud y subject transfers to L CIG commercial product, all assessments under 
termination assessments in the Flow Chart of Assessments must be completed prior to 
transferring to commercial product, with the exception of the removal of the PEG tube 
which will remain in place.
11.1 Safety  Assessments
11.1.1 Adverse Events
Adverse events will be recorded at each visit.  Requirements for collecting, recording and 
reporting of AEs are described in Section 13.0.  Each subject is to be evaluated at the 
Early Termination/End of Study visit.  Should any AE be identified at this visit, the 
Investigator will co ntinue to follow the subject as described in Section 12.1.2 .
11.1.2 Sleep A ttacks
To prospectivel y monitor for the possible development of sleep attacks the following 
question will be asked of subjects at the times indicated in Table 2:
Since y our last visit or last time this question was asked, have you experienced an y events 
in which you fell asleep suddenly or unexpectedl y, including while engaged in some 
activity  (e.g., eating/drinking, speaking, or driving) or a rest, with or without any previous 
warning of sleepiness?
●If yes, what specifically happened?
● How man y times did you expe rience such events?
● What were you doing at the time of each event?
Levodopa -Carbidopa
S187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4

●Prior to each event did you experience an y sleepiness or drowsiness?  I f yes, 
please explain/clarify .
●How long did each event last?
●Did y ou suffer any  "bad" outcome/problem from each fallin g asleep event?
11.1.3 Assessment for Melanoma
A comprehensive assessment for the presence of melanoma must be performed at yearl y 
intervals, including at the Earl y Termination/End of Study, b y a dermatologist 
experienced with the diagnosis of the condition.  If a suspicious lesion is present, a biops y 
should be obtained for proper diagnosis and subjects should be referred to appropriate 
follow -up treatment, if necessary .  Subjects who have a melanoma present at the start of 
the study , or who develop a melanoma d uring the course of the stud y should be 
discontinued from participation and referred for proper follow -up care.
11.1.4 Assessment of Impulsive Behavior
To monitor for the development of intense impulsive behavior, the Minnesota I mpulsive 
Disorders Interview (M IDI) will be administered at 6 month intervals during the course of 
the subject's involvement in the study , and at the time of the subjects' termination from the 
study .  In addition, the Investigator should ask the subjects to inform him/her immediatel y 
if they experience new or increased gambling urges, increased sexual urges, or other 
intense urges while taking LCIG.
If the subject's impulsivity is judged to be clinically significant, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, the subject will be discontinued from participation in the study  and referred 
for appropriate follow -up care.
The General Information and Background Module sections of the MIDI do not need to be 
completed.

11.1.5 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)
The Columbia -Suicide Severit y Rating Sc ale (C -SSRS)16is a sy stematically  administered 
instrument developed to track suicidal adverse events across a treatm ent study .  The 
instrument is designed to assess suicidal behavior and ideation, track and assess all 
suicidal events, as well as the lethality of attempts.  Additional features assessed include 
frequency , duration, controllability , reason for ideation, an d deterrents.  The C -SSRS is 
considered a low -burden instrument, as it takes less than 5 minutes to administer.  Raters 
will receive instruction on the administration of the C -SSRS assessment scales prior to 
administration of the scales.  The C -SSRS will b e administered at the times outlined in 
Table 2.
Subjects expressing suicidal ideation with plan, either b y answering "yes" to questions 4 
and/or 5 to the suicidal ide ation portion of the C -SSRS or via clinical interview, will be 
evaluated immediatel y by the Investigator or another medicall y qualified individual 
(M.D., D.O.).  The Medical Monitor must be notified and the subject will be discontinued 
from participation i n the study .  The subject will be referred for appropriate psy chiatric 
follow -up treatment, if necessary , per the judgment of the Investigator or the medicall y 
qualified individual.  The Medical Monitor will also be notified.  In addition, if the subject 
expresses suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior at any time during the course of the stud y, 
the subject should be discontinued from participation in the study  and referred for proper 
psychiatric follow -up care.  The Investigator and the Medical Monitor sho uld be notified 
immediately  as well. 
Under no circumstances should a subject who has positively endorsed or expressed 
suicidal ideation or behavior be left alone, be allowed to exit the site, or go home 
before a qualified medical professional has evaluated the subject's risk.
The "Alread y Enrolled Subjects" C -SSRS will be the first assessment scale administered 
to the subject.  At each subsequent assessment, the "Since Last Visit" C -SSRS scale 
should be administered.

If the subject has previously  completed the "Already  Enrolled Subjects" scale in the 
S187.3.003 study , the subject should complete the "Since Last Visit" scale at all 
scheduled time points outlined in Table 2in this study .  For subjects with a C -SSRS 
completed at their S187.3.003 final visit, that S187.3.003 final visit C -SSRS assessment 
will be considered baseline for the S187.3.005 study .  For all other subjects, the 
firstC-SSRS assessment completed in t his study  will serve as baseline.
11.1.6 Vital Signs
Orthostatic vital signs including pulse, blood pressure, and bod y temperature will be 
measured at the times indicated in Table 2.  Temperature measurements should be 
assessed b y a consistent method (e.g. all oral or all ear [tympanic membrane] 
measurements) and b y the same method as baseline, if baseline is available.  Weight will 
be measured at the times indicated in Table 2.
Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and pulse rate are to be 
measured while the subject is supine (after 3 to 5 minutes) and standin g (after 2 minutes).
11.1.7 Physical Examination
A phy sical exam as per usual practice will be performed at 6 month intervals, and at the 
time of the subjects' termination from the study .  Any  relevant findings are to be recorded 
on the Adverse Events Form in the eCRF.
11.1.8 Neurological Examination
A Neurologic Examination including light touch and pinprick sensation, vibratory 
sensation, deep tendon reflexes, and strength assessments will be performed at the times 
indicated in Table 2.  The Neurologic Examination will be done during "On" time.
Any abnormalities or s ymptoms identified during treatment will be recorded as adverse 
events.

eCRF and a ttached to the ECG form along with comments on the clinical significance of 
any abnormalities.  Any  change from the previous ECG will be noted on the eCRF in the 
Comments section.  I f clinically  significant abnormalities in the ECG are found, the 
subject's ECG will be repeated at medically  appropriate intervals until it stabilizes or 
returns to acceptable levels.
11.1.11 PEG -Site
The tube insertion site, including the stoma, will be inspected at each Stud y Visit.
11.1.12 Radiological Check of Tube Placement
Tube placement will only  be checked if there is a clinical indication that the tube has been 
displaced.  The tube will be repositioned to the original placement as needed.  I t is 
required that women of childbearing potential should have a negative pregnancy test 
immediat ely prior to the radiological examination to check tube placement.
11.1.13 Complications of the Infusion Device
The tube insertion site, including the stoma, will be inspected at each Stud y Visit.  Details 
surrounding complications related to the infusion device ( e.g., tubing kinks, tubing 
displacement, tubing connector problems, and pump technical difficulties) will be 
collected with regard to the inner tube, outer tube and the pump.  Product Quality 
Complaints concerning devices and cassettes should be recorded o n the Product Quality  
Complaint Form and the source documents.  Product Quality  Complaints must be reported 
immediately  (within 24 hours of the study site's knowledge of the event ) by fax to 
Quintiles Pharmacovigilance (Pharmacovigilance fax numbers are fo und in 
Section 12.2.1 ).
11.1.14 Yearly  Check of PEG Site by  Gastroenterologist

11.2 Efficacy  Measurements
Efficacy  will be assessed using the Parkinson's Disease Diary©, UPDRS, and the PDQ -39.
Appropriate stud y site personnel must be trained on the use of all scales used in this study .
11.2.1 Parkinson's Disease Diary  (Symptom Diary)
The core of the Parkinson's Disease Diary  (PD Diary ) is the tool that the subject will u se 
to record Parkinsonian s ymptoms.  The subject and/or caregiver will be prompted to 
answer the PD Diary  whether the subject has been "ON," "OFF," or "ASLEEP" and what 
has been the severit y of the dyskinesias (troublesome or not troublesome).  On PD Diary
recording day s, subjects will be instructed to make an entry  upon waking and every  
30minutes during their normal waking time.
Study  site staff should make a call to the subjects in advance of their clinic visit to review 
with them the need to complete th e PD Diary  for the visit.
The PD Diary  is to be recorded at the times indicated in Table 2.
Subject Training Requirements
During the initial L CIG study  the subject and caregiver, if applicable, were required to 
have diary  training which included training o f how to understand PD s ymptomatology  and 
how to complete the PD Diary .  A refresher training will be provided to the subjects and 
their caregivers.
Site personnel should emphasize the importance of completing the PD Diary at half -hour 
time points in real time during waking hours to ensure true evaluation of the subject's 
condition.
11.2.2 UPDRS
The United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is an I nvestigator -used rating tool 
to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's disease.  To be qualified b y the S ponsor, 
Levodopa -Carbidopa
S187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2008 -001329 -33
42
all raters must have participated in the Rater Training and have a current valid Rater 
Certificate.  The UPDRS is made up of the following sections:
●Part I  –Mentation, Behavior, and Mood
●Part II –Activities of Daily  Living
●Part III –Motor Examination
● Part IV – Complications of Therap y (including d yskinesias)
●Part V –Modified Hoehn and Yahr Staging
● Part VI – Schwab and England Activities of Dail y Living Scale
Some sections require multiple grades assigned to each extremity .  UPDRS total sc ore 
ranges from 0 to 176, with 176 representing the worst (total) disability , and 0 no 
disability .  Additionall y, Questions 32, 33, and 34 on UPDRS will be totaled to evaluate 
dyskinesias.  
The complete UPDRS (all sections) should be completed at the time s indicated in Table 2.
The complete UPDRS will be done within 1 to 4 hours after the first morning dose of trial 
medication during LCIG treatment.  
UPDRS Rater Trai ning
The UPDRS assessments will be administered only b y individuals qualified by the 
Sponsor and rater training vendor.  
Prior to administration of respective scale(s), designated raters (Investigator or an 
experienced and medically qualified stud y site d esignee (e.g., RN, NP, PA, DO, MD, or 
PhD) assigned b y the Investigator) must be certified in the use of the UPDRS.  The 
objective of this certification/training is to ensure uniformity across sites in the 
administration and scoring of these assessments. 
AbbVie, in conjunction with the rater training vendor, will determine the minimum rater 
qualifications for the rating scales.  All raters must meet these qualifications prior to 
Levodopa -Carbidopa
S187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2008 -001329 -33
43
participation in the training process.  The qualifications of the raters will be verified 
through the training vendor.  Qualified raters will be certified or re -certified based on 
prior L CIG study  training.  Individual exceptions to these requirements must be approved 
by the Sponsor via the training vendor.
Only  those persons who ha ve been trained and certified as raters for this study  may  rate 
the subjects.  Raters who become involved in the study  after the initial training will not be 
permitted to perform study  ratings until they  have satisfactoril y completed an 
individualized trai ning program designed b y the rater training vendor, approved by 
AbbVie, and supervised by  the Investigator or his/her designee.  Raters may  be reassessed 
periodicall y throughout the study.
11.2.3 PDQ -39
The Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ -39) is a disease -specific instrument 
designed to measure aspects of health that are relevant to subjects with PD, and which 
may not be included in general health status questionnaires.  The PDQ -39 is a 
self-administered questionnaire that comprises 39 items address ing the following 
eight domains of health that subjects consider to be adversel y affected b y the disease:
●Mobility  (e.g., fear of falling when walking)
●Activities of daily  living (e.g., difficult y cutting food)
●Emotional well -being (e.g., feelings of isola tion)
●Stigma (e.g., social embarrassment)
●Social support
●Cognition
●Communication
●Bodily  discomfort
The PDQ -39 summary  index ranges from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate a better 
perceived health status.  Higher scores are consistently  associated with the more severe 
symptoms of the disease such as tremor and stiffness.  In addition to the summary index, 
Levodopa -Carbidopa
S187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2008 -001329 -33
44
the results can be presented as eight discrete domain scores.  The PDQ -39 will be 
completed at the times indicated in Table 2.
11.3 Other A ssessments
Informed Consent
Voluntary  written informed consent must be obtained from each subject (and if 
appropriate, their caregiver) prior to performing any stud y-related procedure s (see 
Section 4.3).  If the subject does not have the capacity to provide informed consent, full 
informed consent must be obtained from the subject's legally autho rized representative.  
Consenting will be performed according to local regulations.
Concomitant Medication
Concomitant medication will be recorded at each study  visit.  All medication taken b y the 
subject during the study  (from signing the Informed Consent form through post -study  
follow -up) is to be recorded on the Concomitant Medication eCRF form, except for stud y 
drug.
Determination of Continued Benefit
A standard neurological exam should be performed every 6 months to evaluate the 
subject's condition.  T he decision to continue on LCI G treatment is based on the Principal 
Investigator's clinical judgment.
Daily  Dosing Diary  (US sites only )
Subjects will complete a Daily Dosing Diary  on the day s indicated in Table 2.  The diary  
will include the date and actual clock time of all levodopa -carbidopa intestinal gel 
infusions (including pump start time, pump stop time and the time of an y extra dose 
administration) and all oral levodopa/carbidopa doses.

* This visit needs to be performed only if PEG -J is removed, or if the subject does not continue to receive drug 
after termination.
** Collection of adverse events is an ongoing and continuous process, not only occurring during site visits.
*** The decision to continue subjects on LCIG treatment will be dependent upon Princip al Investigator's clinical 
judgment.
**** On a yearly basis, the LCIG system check needs to be evaluated by the study gastroenterologist; frequency of 
replacement should be in accordance with local practice. 
***** For subjects deemed inappropriate for con tinued treatment by the Investigator, or for subjects who elect not to 
continue LCIG treatment, the PEG -J will be removed, and a follow -up clinic visit will occur 1 week later.
a. The final assessment in the previous open -label LCIG study will serve as the ba seline assessment for this item.
b. Will be done as clinically indicated.
c. For women of childbearing potential.
d. Assessment performed once yearly.
e. Clinical supply visits should take place every 6 weeks ± 7 days.  These visits may take place at the hospital 
pharmacy and are for the purpose of dispensing clinical study drug and ancillary supplies.  Other assessments may 
be completed during these visits if required.  When scheduling the 6 weekly drug dispensing visits, the site should 
always refer back to the b aseline visit.  Every attempt should be made to pick up drug on the original targeted dates 
(±7 days).
f. The "Already Enrolled Subjects" C -SSRS is to be the first assessment scale administered to the subject.  At each 
subsequent assessment, the "Since Las t Visit" C -SSRS scale should be administered.  If the subject has previously 
completed the "Already Enrolled Subjects" scale in the S187.3.003 study, the subject should complete the "Since 
Last Visit" scale at all scheduled time points outlined in Table 2in this study.  For subjects with a C -SSRS 
completed at their S187.3.003 final visit, that S187.3.003 final visit C -SSRS assessment will be considered 
baseline for the S187.3.005 study.  For all other subjects, the first C -SSRS assessment completed in this study will 
serve as baseline.
g. The Daily Dosing Diary and the Parkinson's Disease Diary will be completed by subjects or their caregivers for the 
3 consecutive days prior to each clinic visit at US sites only.
h. The UPDRS and the PDQ -39 will be completed at US sites only.

12.0 Adverse Events
12.1 Adverse Events and A dverse Drug Reactions
Definition Adverse Event (AE)
Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a medicinal product (or a s ystem consisting of drug, device and surgical 
procedure as with LCIG) and which does not necessarily  have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be an y unfavorab le and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding, for example), sy mptom (including an AE 
occurring from drug abuse, an AE occurring from drug withdrawal and an y failure of 
expected pharmacological action) or disease temporally  associated wi th the use of a 
medicinal product or device, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or 
device.
Definition Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)
In the pre -approval clinical experience with a new medicinal product or its new usages, 
particularl y as the therapeutic dose(s) may  not be established, all noxious and unintended 
responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considered ADRs.  The 
phrase "response to a medicinal product" means that a causal relationship between a 
medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility , i.e., the relationship 
cannot be ruled out.
Regarding marketed medicinal products:  a response to a drug which is noxious and 
unintended and which occurs at doses normally  used in man for proph ylaxis, diagnosis, or 
therap y of disease or for modification of physiological function.
An unexpected ADR is an ADR, the nature or severity  of which is not consistent with the 
applicable product information, such as the Investigator's Brochure (IB).

directly  or indirectl y might lead or have led to the death of a subject or user or of other 
persons or to a serio us deterioration in their state of health.
A serious deterioration in state of health can include:
a)Life- threatening illness
b)Permanent impairment of a body  function or permanent damage to a bod y 
structure
c)A condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent a) or b) 
e.g., clinical relevant increase in the duration of a surgical procedure, a condition 
that requires hospitalization or significant prolongation of existing hospitalization
d)Fetal distress, fetal death or an y cong enital abnormality  or birth defects

Not all incidents lead to death or serious deterioration in health.  The non -occurrence of 
such a result might have been due to other fortunate circumstances or to the intervention 
of health care personnel.
It is suffic ient that:
●An Incident associated with the device happened, and
●The Incident was such that, if it occurred again, it might lead to death or 
serious deterioration in health.
Device complaints which have to be reported are side effects, malfunction or deter ioration 
in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, inadequacy in the labeling or the 
instructions for use which do not fulfill the criteria of an Incident as well as use errors and 
abnormal use.
12.1.1 Recording of A dverse Ev ents
All AEs should be re corded on the Adverse Events eCRF and source documents.
In addition Product Quality  Complaints concerning devices, cassettes, and/or L CIG 
should be recorded on the Product Quality  Complaint and Incident form, and the source 
documents.  Product Quality  Comp laints must be reported immediatel y (within 24 hours 
of the study  site's knowledge of the event) b y fax to Quintiles Pharmacovigilance 
(Pharmacovigilance fax numbers are found in Section 12.2.1 ).  Product Quality  
Complaints concerning devices should also be recorded on the eCRF.  Product Quality 
Complaints leading to a subject's health impairment should be recorded in the eCRF as an 
AE.
In order to avoid vague, ambi guous or colloquial expressions, the AE should be recorded 
in standard medical terminology  rather than the subject's own words.  Whenever possible, 
the Investigator should group together the signs and sy mptoms which constitute a single 
diagnosis into a sin gle term which reflects the actual diagnosis.
Levodopa -Carbidopa
S187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2008 -001329 -33
51
The existence of or change in an AE may  be concluded due to the necessity  to administer  
a concomitant medication, from a spontaneous report of an event from the subject, from 
the phy sical examination or from t he results of special tests such as ECG, 
electroencephalograms, laboratory  assessments or other study -specified tests (source of 
AE).
AEs which occur in the specified pre -treatment through the follow -up period, regardless 
of the interval prior to the firs t administration of the study  drug or the interval since the 
last administration of the study  drug, will be handled as any other AE occurring during the 
treatment with study  drug.  Following termination of L CIG treatment, including the 
removal of PEG -J, AE s should continue to be reported for 30 days, irrespective of the 
reason for termination (Early Termination or the end of the study).
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severit y, seriousness and causal relationship to 
the therapeutic s ystem.  The action taken with the therapeutic s ystem, the concomitant 
treatment/therap y introduced and the outcome, as well as whether the event led to study 
termination, will also be recorded.
Severity
The severit y of the AE should be characterized as "mild, moderate or severe" according to 
the following definitions:
●Mild events are usuall y transient and do not interfere with the subject's dail y 
activities.
●Moderate events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the 
subject and may  interfere with daily  activ ities.
●Severe events interrupt the subject's usual dail y activity.

S187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2008 -001329 -33
52
Drug -Event Relationship
For the assessment of drug event relationship, LCIG should be considered a therapeutic 
system consisting of drug, devices and implantation procedure.  Causalit y assessments are 
alway s made over the s ystem as a whole.
The causal relationship between the therapeutic s ystem and the AE should be 
characterized according to the following:
●Unrelated –there is not a reasonable possibility  that the therapeutic s ystem 
caused the AE.
●Unlikely  –suggests that only  a remote connection exists between the 
therapeutic s ystem and the event.  Other conditions, including concurrent 
illness, progression or expression of the disease state or reaction to 
concomitant medication, app ear to explai n the AE.
●Possible –suggests that the association of the AE with the therapeutic s ystem 
is unknown; however, the event is not reasonabl y supported by  other 
conditions, regardless of whether the adverse event might be related to an 
associated condition or other co ncomitant treatment.
●Probable –suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the AE with the 
therapeutic s ystem exists and, in the Investigator 's clinical judgment, it is 
likely  that a causal relationship exists between the therapeu tic system and the 
AE, and other conditions (concurrent illness, progression or expression of the 
disease state, or concomitant medication reactions) do not appear to explain 
the AE.
Outcome
The outcome of the adverse event should be classified according to the following 
definitions:
●Recovered/resolved:  The event has resolved (no further s ymptoms are present 
and no treatment is being received b y the subject).
Levodopa -Carbidopa
S187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2008 -001329 -33
53
●Recovered/resolved with sequelae:  The event has resolved, but there may be 
lingering effects pre sent (e.g., a scar following a cut or abrasion).
●Fatal:  The subject died as a result of the event.  This code should only be used 
for the event that caused the death, not an y event that was present at the time 
of the subject's death.  Fatal events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor 
(or an authorized representative).
●Unknown:  May  only  be used in the event that the subject is lost to follow -up 
and no reliable data can be obtained.
All efforts should be made to classify  the AE according to the above categories.
Note:  When the AE is ongoing, the outcome will remain blank on the Adverse Events 
eCRF.
12.1.2 Follow -Up of A dverse Events
All AEs occurring during the study  are to be followed -up in accordance with good 
medical practice until resolved or judged no longer clinically  significant, or if a chronic 
condition, until fully  characterized.  All follow -up results are to be reported to the Sponsor 
(or an authorized representative).
12.1.3 Follow -Up of Product Quality Complaints
The Product Qualit y Complaints occurrin g during the stud y are to be followed up until 
resolved.  All follow -up results are to be reported to the Sponsor (or an authorized 
representative).
12.1.4 Adverse Events of Special Interest
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) for L CIG are:
●Risks of PEG -J insertion
●Long -term complications of PEG -J
●Device associated gastrointestinal disorders during long -term therap y
Levodopa -Carbidopa
S187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2008 -001329 -33
54
●Cardiovascular fatalities
●Aspiration including aspiration pneumonia
●A diagnosis of peripheral poly neuropathy ; axonal, demy elinating or mixed 
type
●Possible sy mptoms of peripheral pol yneuropath y such as sensory  disturbances 
or loss of strength, which from their course and clinical presentation or from 
their response to medication could be precursors of poly neuropathy
●Clinically  significant weight lo ss
A standard panel of examinations will be suggested to the Investigators if one of the stud y 
subjects develops signs and sy mptoms of poly neuropathy .  The panel should be 
considered as a basic recommendation and the selection of additional diagnostic tools is at 
the discretion of the Investigator, depending on the clinical presentation of the individual 
subject.
For AESIs, serious and nonserious, meeting pre -defined criteria, specific questionnaires 
will be used to standardize the collection of follow -up information.
All cases o f clinically  significant weight loss and possible sy mptoms or precursors of 
polyneuropathy  (serious and non serious) should be reported on the Report for SAEs and 
AESI s (Yellow Form) to the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) within the 
expedited tim elines applicable for SAEs.
12.2 Serious A dverse Events (SA Es) and Serious A dverse Drug 
Reactions (SA DRs)
Definition Serious Adverse Event (SAE)/Serious Adverse Drug Reaction (SADR)
Any untoward medical occurrence that at an y dose:
●Results in death
●Is life -threatening (an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypotheticall y might have 
caused death if it were more severe)
Levodopa -Carbidopa
S187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2008 -001329 -33
55
●Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospi talization
●Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
●Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
In addition, medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether 
other conditions should also be considered serious, such as important medical events that 
may not be immediatel y life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may  
jeopardize the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes 
listed above.  These should also be considered seri ous.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
During the course of the study :
If not associated with significant worsening of PD symptoms, a hospitalization for dose 
adjustments of L CIG will not be regarded as an SAE.  A hospitalization because of a 
Product Quality  Complaint such as a device dislocation without AE (i.e., wit hout health 
impairment) will not be regarded as an SAE.
12.2.1 Reporting Serious A dverse Events
Any SAE, including death due to an y cause, which occurs during this study, whether or 
not related to the therapeutic sy stem, must be reported immediately  (within 24 ho urs of 
the study  site's knowledge of the event) b y telephone or fax to the Sponsor or the 
Sponsor's authorized representative (phone or fax numbers are listed below).
Additionally , Product Quality  Complaints concerning devices and cassettes must also be 
reported immediatel y (within 24 hours of the study site's knowledge of the event) b y fax

the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) via fax or mail within 48 hours of the event.  
These timelines appl y to initial reports of SAEs and to all follow -up repo rts.
All SAEs and/or Product Quality  Complaints will be recorded on the SAE Report form 
and/or Product Quality Complaint form, the Adverse Events form in the eCRF, and source 
documents.  Criteria for documenting the relationship to the therapeutic s ystem as well as 
severit y and outcome will be the same as those previously described.
All SAEs that are spontaneously  reported within 30 day s of a subject's last visit are to be 
collected and reported as previously  described.
12.2.2 Reporting of Serious A dverse Drug Re actions and 
Suspected Unexpected Serious A dverse Drug Reactions to 
Regulatory  Authorities and Investigators
All serious adverse drug reactions will be subject to expedited reporting per local 
requirements and regulations.  All suspected unexpected serious adverse drug reactions 
(SUSARs) will be subject to expedited reporting and any additional local requirements 
and regulations.  Additionally , post -study  SUSARs that occur after the subject has 
completed a clinical study and are reported b y the Investigator to the Sponsor (or an 
authorized representative) qualify  for expedited reporting.  Expectedness is assessed 
according to the Investigator's Brochure (IB) for LCIG.14
The Sponsor (or an authorized representative) is responsible for submitting reports of 
SUSARs to the appropriate national regulatory authorities within the required rep orting 
period.  All Investigators participating in ongoing clinical studies with the therapeutic 
system will be notified by  the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) of all SUSARs 
that require prompt submission to the I EC/I RB.  The Sponsor (or an autho rized 
representative) or the Investigator (according to national provisions) is responsible for 
notify ing the IECs/IRBs in writing of the SUSARs within the required reporting 
timelines.  Copies of the notification will be maintained b y both the Investigato r and the 
Sponsor (or an authorized representative) in the study documentation files.

13.2 Analysis Populations
Definitions of anal ysis populations:
1. Safety  Population:
The S afety Population includes all subjects who have taken at least one dose of 
study  medication in this study .  The Safet y Population will be used for all analyses 
unless noted otherwise.
2. Efficacy  Population:
The Efficacy  Population includes all subjects who h ave taken at least one dose of 
study  medication in this study  and have at least one efficacy  assessment in this 
study .
This is an open -label study  with a single, active treatment group; all subjects in this study  
will receive LCIG.
13.3 Statistical Methods 
Safety Anal ysis
The Safet y Population will be used for the anal ysis of the safet y and tolerability  data.
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA).  A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an y adverse event 
that begins or worsens in severit y on or after the first dose of study drug in the current 
study  and within 30 day s of the end of LCIG treatment in the current stud y.  For subjects 
transferring to commercial product, the end of treatment in the current study will be the 
last dose of study  drug.  For subjects who are discontinuing L CIG treatment, the end of 
treatment in the current study  will be the removal of the PEG -J tube.  The following 
summaries of TEAE's will be prepared:
●Incidence of t reatment -emergent adverse events
●Incidence of treatment -emergent serious adverse events
Levodopa -Carbidopa
S187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2008 -001329 -33
60
●Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events resulting in study  termination
●Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events of special interest
The following additional anal yses of safet y will also be prepared:
●Summary  of vital sign and weight values and mean change from Baseline over 
time
●Incidence of potentiall y clinically significant vital sign and weight values
●Summary  of clinical lab values and mean change from Baseline to Endpoint
●Summary  of special lab values and mean change from Baseline over time
●Incidence of potentiall y clinically significant clinical lab values
●Summary  of MIDI at Baseline and during treatment
●Summary  of C -SSRS
●Incidence of device complications
Efficacy  Anal ysis
The Efficacy  Population will be used for analy ses of efficacy .  The mean change from 
baseline to endpoint will be summarized for the following efficacy endpoints.
●"Off" time as measured by the Parkinson's Disease Diary
●"On" time without troublesome dyskinesia (sum of "On" time without 
dyskinesia and "On" time with non -troublesome dyskinesia) as measured by 
the Parkinson's Disease Diary
●UPDRS total score, Parts I , II, III and IV scores, and dy skinesia item score
●PDQ -39 summary  index and domain scores
For the anal ysis of change from baseline in efficacy measures, each subject's baseline will 
be their baseline measure in the first L CIG study  in which they  participated 
(e.g., Study S187.3.001, S187.3.002 or S187.3.004) .

Additional Analy sis
Subject disposition will be summarized including the primary  reason for premature 
discontinuations and a listing of all subjects not included in the safety population.
Descriptive statistics will be provided for demographics and basel ine characteristics.
Concomitant medication use will be summarized over time.
Baseline and Endpoint
Unless noted otherwise, the baseline value for a variable is defined as the last non -missing 
value collected in the current study or the previous open -label LCIG stud y before the 
firstdose of study  drug in the current study .
The endpoint value for a variable is defined as the last non -missing value assigned to the 
treatment period in the current stud y for the subject.  For subjects transferring to 
commercial product, the end of treatment in the current study  will be the last dose of study 
drug.  For subjects who are discontinuing LCIG treatment, the end of treatment in the 
current stud y will be the removal of the PEG -J tube.
13.4 Alpha Level Tested
Not applicable.
13.5 Sample Size
This is an open -label extension study.  All subjects in a country  where LCIG is not 
commerciall y available will be eligible to enroll if they meet the stud y's inclusion criteria 
and exclusion criteria.
14.0 Investigator Obligations

62
requirements.  The Investigator and the Sponsor will sign the protocol to confirm this 
agreement.
14.1 Essential Documents
The Investigator is responsible for providing and maintaining essential study documents.  
Essential study  documents are those documents that individually  and collectively  permit 
the evaluation of the conduct of the study  and the quality  of the data produced.  These 
documents serve to demonstrate the compliance of the I nvestigator and the Sponsor (or an 
authorized representative) with the standards of GCPs and with all applicable national 
regulatory  requirements.
Essential study documents will include regulatory  documents as well as source documents 
which are original documents, data and records of clinical findings, observations and 
other activities in a clinical study  necessary  for the reconstruction and evaluation of the 
study .  Source d ocuments will include hospital records, clinical and office charts, 
laboratory  notes, memoranda, subject diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy  
dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions 
certified after verif ication as being accurate copies, microfiches, photographic negatives, 
microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files and records kept at the pharmacy , at the 
laboratories and at medical/technical departments involved in the clinical study.
The Investi gator agrees to allow direct access to all essential clinical study documents for 
the purpose of monitoring and/or auditing b y the Sponsor (or an authorized 
representative) and inspection by
 the appropriate national and foreign regulatory  
authorities.
14.2 Electronic Case Report (eCRF) Form Completion
Data reflecting the subject's participation with the therapeutic s ystem under investigation 
will be reported to the Sponsor.  The data will be recorded on the electronic CRF (eCRF) 
or other media provided or approv ed by the Sponsor.  The eCRF is essentially considered 
Levodopa -Carbidopa
S187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2008 -001329 -33
63
a data entry  form and will not constitute the original (or source) medical records unless 
otherwise specified.
The Investigator must submit a completed eCRF for each subject who receives study 
drug, re gardless of duration.  All supportive documentation submitted with the eCRF, 
such as laboratory  or hospital records, should be clearl y identified with the study and 
subject number.  An y personal information, including subject name, should be removed or 
rendered illegible to preserve individual confidentiality .
An electronic data capture (EDC) s ystem, managed by  Quintiles, will be used instead of 
paper CRFs to collect data for this study .  Electronic CRFs will allow for data to be 
entered remotely and remote study  monitoring.  Instructions on the use of electronic CRFs 
will be provided to the study  site.  The Investigator will use an electronic signature to 
document his/her review of the data and acknowledgment that the data are accurate.  
Changes to the elec tronic CRF will be made only  by the Investigator and authorized staff.
Supportive paper documentation should be completed in indelible ink and be legible.  If 
an entry  on supportive paper documentation requires change, the correction should be 
made as foll ows:
●Draw a single line through the incorrect entry.
●Enter the correct data and initial and date the change.
Correction fluids, markers, erasure or an y form of obliteration on supportive paper 
documentation is not permitted under an y circumstances.
14.3 Essent ial Records Retention
The Investigator should maintain the essential clinical study documents (including eCRFs, 
source documents, clinical drug disposition records, signed subject informed consent 
forms, AE reports and other regulatory  documents) as requir ed by the applicable national 
regulatory  requirements.  The Investigator is to take adequate measures to prevent 
accidental or premature destruction of these documents.  In the event of accidental 
Levodopa -Carbidopa
S187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2008 -001329 -33
64
destruction, the Investigator should notify  the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) 
immediately .
Essential clinical study documents will be retained at least two (2) years after the last 
approval of a marketing application in an International Conference on Harmonisation 
(ICH) region and until there are no pe nding or contemplated marketing applications in an 
ICH region OR at least two (2) y ears have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of 
clinical development of the investigational product.  These documents shall be retained 
for a longer period; however, i f required b y the applicable regulatory requirements or b y 
an agreement with the Sponsor (or an authorized representative).
The Investigator is required to notify  the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) prior to 
changing the location or status of an yessential clinical study  documents.  The Sponsor (or 
an authorized representative) will be responsible for informing the Investigator as to when 
these documents no longer need to be retained.
14.4 Investigator Agreement
The Investigator is responsible for assu ring the proper implementation and conduct of the 
clinical study  including those study -related duties delegated to other appropriately 
qualified individuals.  The Investigator and his/her staff will cooperate with the Sponsor 
(or an authorized representati ve) during monitoring and auditing visits to assist with the 
review of the study  data and resolve any  discrepancies.
The Investigator will demonstrate due diligence in recruitment and screening of potential 
study  subjects.  The enrollment rate should be su fficient to complete the study  as agreed 
with the Sponsor (or an authorized representative).  The Sponsor (or an authorized 
representative) is to be notified of an y projected delay s, which may  impact the completion 
of the study .
The Sponsor retains the rig ht to terminate the clinical study  at any  time for any  reason.  In 
such an event, instructions on the requirements for the discontinuation of subjects will be 
provided b y the Sponsor (or an authorized representative).

15.0 Sponsor Obligations
15.1 Protocol A mendments
Only  the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) will make modifications to the clinical 
study  protocol, which will be documented in a written amendment that describes all 
changes that will be implemented.  Protocol amendments will be categorized as either 
substantial or non -substantial.
Protocol amendments will be considered substantial when the changes have significant 
impact on:
●The safet y of physical or mental integrit y of the subjects
●The scientific value of the study
●The conduct or management of the study
●The quality  or safety  of any  investigational medicinal product or control used 
in the study
Protocol amendments will be considered non -substantial when the changes affect only  
administ rative issues with the conduct of the study (e.g., changes in telephone numbers or 
addresses).
The Sponsor (or an authorized representative) will be responsible for notifying the 
appropriate national regulatory authorities in writing of an y amendments to t he protocol 
prior to the changes being implemented except in those cases where the changes are 
necessary  to eliminate an immediate hazard to the clinical study  subjects.
Substantial amendments will require written approval by  the IEC/I RB prior to being 
implemented by  the Investigator at the stud y site except under those circumstances 
described previously .  Non -substantial amendments will not require approval by  the

Protocol Title:
Open -Label Continuation Treatment Study with Levodopa -Carbidopa Intestinal Gel in Subjects with 
Advanced Parkinson's Disease and Severe Motor -Fluctuations Who Have Exhibited a Persistent and 
Positive Effect to Treatment in Previous Studies
Study Center(s) (Planned):
Approximately 70
Study Duration:
The protocol duration is planned until the finished product is available commercially in the respective 
countries where subjects are participating in the study.  The expected protocol duration w ill continue 
through successful NDA and subsequent approval (approximately 4 years).  The protocol duration will 
be extended 4 years in the UK from the approval date of Amendment 3.0 1.  If it is deemed necessary to 
continue treatment after 4 years in the UK, either an amendment will be made to the current protocol 
or a new protocol will be submitted.
Objectives :
The primary objective is to provide continued access to subjects who wou ld like to continue 
Levodopa -Carbidopa Intestinal Gel (LCIG), after completion of an open -label study (S187.3.003, 
S187.3.004, or any ne w Phase 3 open -label LCIG study initiated by the Sponsor).
Methodology:
This is a Phase 3B, open -label, multi -center, s tudy.  Subjects w ill be provided w ith LCIG, if judged 
medically indicated and if it is not commercially available.  Data collected w ill be limited to the 
continued safety monitoring of LCIG with periodic assessment of the continued appropriateness of the 
subject's participation in the study.
Number of Subjects (Planned):
It is anticipated that approximately 275 subjects who had participated and completed one of the 
open -label LCIG clinical trials w ill be eligible for this continued treatment with LCIG, until it is 
commercially available.

Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:
In order to be eligible to participate in this study, subjects must meet the following criteria:
1.The subject should have completed participation in Study S187.3.003, S187.3. 004, or any new 
Phase 3 open -label LCIG study initiated by the Sponsor; and, in the opinion of the Principal 
Investigator, w ould benefit from long -term treatment with LCIG.  For Canada, subjects will be 
allow ed to participate in the S187.3.005 study with a minimum of 6 months of exposure to LCIG in 
the S187.3.004 study.
2.The subject must be able to understand the nature of the study and must provide w ritten informed 
consent prior to the conduct of any study related procedures.
Main Criteria for Exclusion :
Subjects meeting any of the exclusion criteria listed below  at Baseline must be excluded from 
participation in the study. 
1.Medical, laboratory, psychiatric, or surgical issues deemed by the Investigator to be clinically 
significant, and which could interfere with the subject's participation in the study.
Investigational Product, Dose and Mode of Adm inistration:
LCIG is a homogenous suspension of levodopa (20 mg/mL) and carbidopa monohydrate (5 mg/mL) in an 
aqueous intestinal gel (carboxymethylcellul ose).  LCIG (levodopa [20 mg/mL] and carbidopa 
monohydrate [5 mg/mL]) is delivered to the proximal small intestine through a jejunal extension tube 
inserted via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG -J).  The intestinal gel is dispensed in a 
medication c assette reservoir of 100 mL, designed to be connected to a portable subject -operated pump.  
LCIG infusion is administered over a full 16 -hour period.  The gel will be administered as one morning 
dose, follow ed by  continuous infusion for the remainder of th e 16- hour period.  In addition to the 
morning dose and the continuous infusion, subjects w ill be allow ed to self -administer additional doses of 
LCIG to address immediate subjective needs, such as the deterioration of motor function.  It is 
recommended that no more than five extra doses are given per day.  If subjects find it necessary to 
self-administer an increasing number of extra doses (> five/day) of LCIG, they will be instructed to 
contact their physician for appropriate follow -up care (adjustment of continuous infusion) as needed.  At 
night, after disconnecting the pump, the tubing is flushed with potable w ater.
Duration of Treatm ent:
In countries where LCIG is not commercially available, the treatment will be made available to subjects 
who complete p articipation in either LCIG open -label Study S187.3.003 or S187.3.004, or any new 
Phase 3 open -label LCIG study initiated by the Sponsor.  Such product w ill be made available by the 
Sponsor in accordance with all local regulations as long as such is warran ted by the therapeutic benefit.  
The latter w ill be determined in consultancy with the responsible neurologist, the subject and the 
Sponsor.  Subjects who continue to receive drug will be evaluated at least semi -annually by the 
Investigator.  In cooperatio n with the investigational site, all necessary support will be provided by the 
Sponsor's local representatives.
Reference Therapy, Dose and Mode of Adm inistration:
Not applicable.

recording day s, subjects will be instructed to make an entry  upon waking and every  
30minutes during their normal waking time.
Study  site staff should make a call to the subjects in advance of their clinic visit to review 
with them the need to complete the PD Diary  for the visit.
The PD Diary  is to be recorded at the times indicated in Table 2.
Subject Training Requirements
During the initial L CIG study  the subject and caregiver, if applicable, were required to 
have diary  training which included training of how to understand PD s ymptomatology  and 
how to complete the PD Diary .  A refresher training will be provided to the subjects and 
their caregivers.
Site personnel should emphasize the importance of completing the PD Diary at half -hour 
time poin ts in real time during waking hours to ensure true evaluation of the subject's 
condition.
Section 11.2.2  UPDRS

11.2.2 UPDRS
The United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is an I nvestigator -used rating tool 
to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's disease.  To be qualified b y the Sponsor, 
all raters must have participated in the Rater Training and have a current valid Rater 
Certificate.  The UPDRS is made up of the following sections:
●Part I  –Mentation, Behavior, and Mood
●Part II –Activities of Daily  Living
●Part III –Motor Examination
● Part IV – Complications of Therap y (including d yskinesias)

●Part V –Modified Hoehn and Yahr Staging
● Part VI – Schwab and England Activities of Dail y Living Scale
Some sec tions require multiple grades assigned to each extremity.  UPDRS total score 
ranges from 0 to 176, with 176 representing the worst (total) disability , and 0 no 
disability .  Additionall y, Questions 32, 33, and 34 on UPDRS will be totaled to evaluate 
dyskine sias.  
The complete UPDRS (all sections) should be completed at the times indicated in Table 2.
The complete UPDRS will be done within 1 to 4 hours after the first mo rning dose of trial 
medication during LCIG treatment.  
UPDRS Rater Training
The UPDRS assessments will be administered only b y individuals qualified by the 
Sponsor and rater training vendor.  
Prior to administration of respective scale(s), designated rat ers (Investigator or an 
experienced and medically qualified stud y site designee (e.g., RN, NP, PA, DO, MD, or 
PhD) assigned b y the Investigator) must be certified in the use of the UPDRS.  The 
objective of this certification/training is to ensure uniformit y across sites in the 
administration and scoring of these assessments. 
AbbVie, in conjunction with the rater training vendor, will determine the minimum rater 
qualifications for the rating scales.  All raters must meet these qualifications prior to 
partic ipation in the training process.  The qualifications of the raters will be verified 
through the training vendor.  Qualified raters will be certified or re -certified based on 
prior L CIG study  training.  Individual exceptions to these requirements must be ap proved 
by the Sponsor via the training vendor.
Only  those persons who have been trained and certified as raters for this study  may  rate 
the subjects.  Raters who become involved in the study  after the initial training will not be

Add:  new section title and text
11.2.3 PDQ -39
The Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ -39) is a disease -specific instrument 
designed to measure aspects of health that are relevant to subjects with PD, and which 
may not be inc luded in general health status questionnaires.  The PDQ -39 is a 
self-administered questionnaire that comprises 39 items addressing the following 
eight domains of health that subjects consider to be adversel y affected b y the disease:
●Mobility  (e.g., fear of falling when walking)
●Activities of daily  living (e.g., difficult y cutting food)
●Emotional well -being (e.g., feelings of isolation)
●Stigma (e.g., social embarrassment)
●Social support
●Cognition
●Communication
●Bodily  discomfort
The PDQ -39 summary  index rang es from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate a better 
perceived health status.  Higher scores are consistently  associated with the more severe 
symptoms of the disease such as tremor and stiffness.  In addition to the summary index, 
the results can be pres ented as eight discrete domain scores.  The PDQ -39 will be 
completed at the times indicated in Table 2.

Previously read:
Safety Anal ysis
The Safet y Population will be used for the anal ysis of the safet y and tolerability  data.
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA).  A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an y adverse event 
that begins or worsens in severit y on or after the first dose of study drug in the current 
study  and within 30 day s of the last dose of stud y drug in the current study .  The 
following summaries of TEAE's will be prepared:
●Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events
●Incidence of treatment -emergent serious adverse events
●Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events resulting in study  termination
●Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events of special interest
The following additional anal yses of safet y will also be prepared:
●Summary  of vital sign and weight values and change from Baseline over time
●Incidence of potentiall y clinically significant v ital sign and weight values
●Summary  of clinical lab values and change from Baseline to Endpoint
●Summary  of special lab values and change from Baseline over time
●Summary  of ECG clinical interpretations over time
●Shifts in ECG clinical interpretations from Baseline to Endpoint
●Summary  of neurological examination clinical interpretations over time

●Shifts in neurological examination clinical interpretations over time
●Summary  of MIDI at Baseline and during treatment
●Summary  of C -SSRS
●Incidence of device complica tions
Additional Analy sis
Subject disposition will be summarized including the primary  reason for premature 
discontinuations and a listing of all subjects not included in the safety population.
Descriptive statistics will be provided for demographics and baseline characteristics.
Concomitant medication use will be summarized over time.
Baseline and Endpoint
The baseline value for a variable is defined as the last non -missing value collected in the 
current stud y or the previous open -label LCIG study  before the first dose of study  drug in 
the current study .
The endpoint value for a variable is defined as the last non -missing value assigned to the 
treatment for the subject.

Efficacy  Anal ysis
The Efficacy  Population will be used for analy ses of efficacy .  The mean change from 
baseline to endpoint will be summarized for the following efficacy endpoints.
●"Off" time as measured by the Parkinson's Disease Diary
●"On" time without troublesome dyskinesia (sum of "On" time without 
dyskinesia and "On" time with non -troublesome dyskinesia) as measured by 
the Parkinson's Disease Diary
●UPDRS total score, Parts I , II, III and IV scores, and dy skinesia item score

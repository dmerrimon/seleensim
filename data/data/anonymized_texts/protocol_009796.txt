Name of Sponsor/Company:  EyeQue Corporation 
Name of Investigational Device:  EyeQue VisionCheck  
Title of Study:  A clinical validation study to evaluate the performance of a hand- held device 
supported by a mobile application compared with standard eye care diagnostic devices in 
measuring refractive error of the eye  
Study Number:  EYEQUE -001 
Study center(s):  1  
Studied period (years):  
Estimated date first patient enrolled:  Q2 2019 
Estimated date last patient completed:  Q 3 2019 
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• The primary objective of this study is to determine whether  EyeQue VisionCheck is 
statistically non -inferior to the phoropter as assessed by best corrected visual acuity 
(BCVA)  for each eye independently , measured using trial lens frames  that correct  the 
refractive error measured by each device, for the age stratum 45 through 65 years . 
Secondary:  
The secondary objectives include:  
• Assessing similarity of refraction values (sphere, cylinder, axis) from the E yeQue 
VisionCheck compared with the phoropter  through comparative plots and Pearson 
correlations  
• Determining whether  EyeQue VisionCheck is statistically non- inferior to the 
autorefractor as assessed by BCVA measured using trial lens frames  that correct the 
refractive error measured by each device  
• Assessing similarity of refraction values (sphere, cylinder, axis) from the EyeQue 
VisionCheck compared with the autorefractor  through comparative plots and Pearson 
correlations  
• Determining whether EyeQue VisionChe ck is statistically non -inferior to the 
phoropter as assessed by BCVA measured using trial lens frames that correct the 
refractive error measured by each device, for the age  stratum 30 through 65  years . 
Exploratory:  
• The exploratory objective of this study is to assess subject preference among the 
3 trial lens frames that correct the refractive error measured by the EyeQue 
VisionCheck, phoropter, and autorefractor.

Safety:   
• To evaluate the safety of EyeQue VisionCheck compared with the phoropter and the 
autorefractor  
Study design:  This is a single -center, open -label, prospective study in healthy volunteers  
desiring refraction for correction of visual acuity  to compare the EyeQue VisionCheck with the 
phoropter and autorefractor.  
Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled in this study to achieve a minimum of 
100 evaluable subjects.  Subjects will be enrolled to obtain a population of approximately 35% in the age range of 30 through 44 years and approximately 65% in the age range of 45 through 65 years.  Subjects will be screened for study participation and, if enrolled, will complete the 
testing procedures at the same visit.  Subjects will not undergo any study -specific screening or 
testing procedures until written informed consent is obtained.  A subject will be enrolled in the study after confirming that the subject has met all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.  
 
Screening procedures   
The subject will complete the following assessments and procedures at Screening  to confirm 
eligibility :   
• demographics/ medical history/concomitant medication review,  
• slit-lamp biomicroscopy,  
• laser retinal scan  or fund oscopy ,  
• optical coherence tomography (OCT) (retina and anterior chamber) , 
• tonometry (non contact) , 
• Ishihara color test,  
• cover test,  
• retinoscopy  
• phoropter refraction, and  
• visual acuity with phoropter correction.   
During the OCT and laser retinal scan /fundoscopy , images will be taken of the retina , anterior 
chamber,  and fundus.  All eye procedures will be completed without dilation using standard 
procedures.     
Retinoscopy will be used as a basis for further refinement by phoropter refraction.  Refraction values (sphere, cylinder, axis) for oculus dexter  (OD, right eye) and oculus sinister (OS, left eye) 
will be recorded for each subject using the phoropter.  These values will be used to adjust the lenses in the phoropter while the subject is looking through the device at an Early Treatment Diabetic Retin opathy Study (ETDRS) eye chart to determine BCVA, as subjects are eligible to 
participate in the study only if their vision ( oculus uterque [ OU]; both eyes) can be corrected to 
20/20 ( logarithm of th e minimum angle of resolution [L ogMAR ] 0.0).     
             6    Version 3.0 ( 17 June  2019)  
     
Protocol EYEQUE -001 
EyeQue Corporation   
The Scre ening procedures will be used to confirm that the subject does not have an exclusionary 
diagnosis (see exclusion criteria below).  
 
Testing procedures    
Once eligibility is confirmed , the subject will be enrolled and proceed with study testing 
procedures.  T he refraction values (sphere, cylinder, axis) for each subject (OD and OS) will be 
assessed using 2 additional  devices: autorefractor  and the EyeQue VisionCheck.  Subjects will be 
assessed with the autorefractor using standard device methodology.  The ref raction values 
generated from the EyeQue VisionCheck, the autorefractor  and the phoropter (during screening) 
will be used to prepare 3 sets of trial lens frames.  Pupillary distance, measured using the 
autorefractor, will be recorded for all subjects and w ill be used for preparation of trial lens 
frames.    
All subjects will be trained on how to use the EyeQue VisionCheck device prior to initiating 
testing.  In order to obtain refraction values using the EyeQue VisionCheck, the subject will be 
required to ta ke 1 practice test followed by a minimum of 3 saved tests for each eye using the 
EyeQue VisionCheck device and mobile application (app).  After completion of a set of tests (1 test for each eye), the subject may elect to save or discard that set of tests.  They may choose 
to discard for any reason which may include not following instruction, pressing the wrong button in error, etc.   Each test consists of the subject looking through the VisionCheck device and using 
the app controls to fully overlap red and g reen bars at 9  differe nt angles.   After  completion of all 
tests (1 practice test and 3 saved tests with each eye), the refraction values will be displayed on the mobile app.  These values will be used for preparation of the trial lens frames.  If the EyeQu e 
system determines that the overall test results are unreliable, s ubjects may have to complete 3 
additional tests per eye before the system may be able to provide refraction values .  Subjects will 
not be allowed to complete more than 6 saved tests and 1 practice test with each eye.  If the 
EyeQue system determines that the  overall  test results are unreliable, no values will be provided.  
  
After collection of refraction values from each device (phoropter, autorefractor, and EyeQue 
VisionCheck), the 3 tri al lens frames will be prepared and given to the subject in a masked  
fashion.  Best corrected visual acuity will be assessed using the ETDRS eye chart.  For each subject, BCVA LogMAR scores will be collected for OD, OS, and OU f or each of the 3 trial lens 
frames.  Subject s will also be asked a question regarding overall satisfaction with visual acuity 
using each of the 3 trial lens frames.  Subjects will be monitored for adverse events (AEs) and adverse device effects (ADEs) duri ng the study.    
Number of subjects (planned):  Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled in this study to 
achieve a minimum of 100 evaluable subjects.  An initial cohort of  39 subjects  will b e excluded 
from the analysis populations due to a software error identified in the EyeQue app t hat has since 
been corrected ; therefore, approximately 160 additional subjects will be enrolled in the study.  
Subjects will be enrolled to obtain a population of approximately 35% in the age range of 30 through 44 years and approximately 65% in the age range of 45 through 65 years.

7. Subject does not have the physical dexterity to properly operate the EyeQue  VisionCheck 
device or the EyeQue app on the smartphone  in the i nvestigator’s opinion 
Investigational device and mode of administration:  The investigational device is  the EyeQue 
VisionCheck, and the intended use is to measure the refractive error of the eye .  This is a 
self-administered, portable, monocular  refraction system consisting of 3 main components:  a 
mobile app, a cloud- based processing platform, and the VisionCheck optical device that attaches 
to a compatible smartphone  owned/operated by the end user .  The EyeQue app guides the subject 
through interactive measurements with the EyeQue VisionCheck device in order to determine 
refractive error.   
Study dura tion:  The study duration for each subject will be 1 day.  All study -related 
procedures, including screening, will be completed in  1 visit.  
Reference devices  and mode of administration:  The reference devices will be the p horopter 
and autorefractor .  Prior to enrollment of study subjects, both devices will be calibrated 
following standard practice. S tandard device methodology for refraction tests will be used to 
obtain refraction values with each device.  
Criteria for evaluation:  
Efficacy:  
Primary Endpoint:   
• Statistical non -inferiority of EyeQue VisionCheck  compared with phoropter assessed 
by BCVA (OD, OS, and OU ) measured using trial lens frames that correct the 
refractive error measured by each device analyzed with age stratum 45 through 
65 years .   
Secondary Endpoints:  
• Comparison of raw refraction values produced using the EyeQue VisionCheck and 
the phoropter  analyzed with age strata 30 through 65 years and 45 through 65 years . 
• Statistical non -inferiority of EyeQue VisionCheck  compared wi th autorefractor 
assessed by BCVA ( OD, OS, and OU) measured using trial lens frames that correct 
the refractive error measured by each device analyzed with age strata 30 through 
65 years and 45 through 65 years .   
• Comparison of raw refraction values produc ed using the EyeQue VisionCheck and 
the autor efractor  analyzed with age strata 30 through 65 and 45 through 65 years . 
• Statistical non -inferiority of EyeQue VisionCheck  compared with phoropter assessed 
by BCVA (OD, OS, and OU ) measured using trial lens fram es that correct the 
refractive error measured by each device analyzed  with  the age s tratum 
30 through 65 years . 
Exploratory Endpoint:  
• Subject preference of trial lens frames that correct the refractive error measured by 
             9    Version 3.0 ( 17 June  2019)

EyeQue Corporation   
each of the 3 devices :  EyeQue VisionCheck, phoropter, and autorefractor . 
Safety:  
If any AEs occur during the study, t he safety endpoints will include the frequency and severity of 
AEs, ADEs , and serious adverse events  (SAEs).  
Statistics:  
Analysis Populations  
Modified Intent to Treat Population:  All subjects that perform BCVA for trial frames with 
test lens es based on both phoropter and EyeQue VisionCheck. 
Safety Population:  All subjects that meet the screening criteria and are enrolled in the study.    
 
After enrollment in this study was initiated , a software  error was identified in the EyeQue app 
used with the EyeQue VisionCheck.  The error was corrected and the algorithm for the  EyeQue  
app was updated.  An initial cohort of 39 subjects was enrolled in t he study prior to these 
changes being implemented .  Due to these EyeQue app updates, t his initial cohort of  39 subjects 
will be excluded from the analysis populations and any safety information for these subjects will 
be listed separately.   
 
Power and Sample Size  
Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled in this study to achieve a minimum of 100 evaluable subjects  to assess the effectiveness and safety of the EyeQue VisionCheck.  The 
initial cohort included 39 subjects; therefore, approximately 160 additional subjects will be enrolled in the study.  Based on prior study  data, reject ion of  non- inferiority bounds  of 0.1 
LogMAR (one line) and 0.05 LogMAR (one -half line) would require approximately 10 and 40 
subjects, respectively, with 90% power on the BCVA from the resulting lens from each 
approach.  This assumes the devices are roughly equivalent and the standard deviation (SD) is 0.077; th ese data are  based on a previous version of the EyeQue VisionCheck  device  tested 
against an autorefractor.   The proposed sample size has been inflated to allow for the possibility 
that a larger standard deviation will be observed in the current study , as well as to allow for 
comparisons within each stratum.   
When the software error in the EyeQue app was identified, t he algorithm for the EyeQue app 
was updated with more strin gent parameters  which may also impact the number of evaluable 
subjects.  Due to the updates  to the parameters , there may be additional subjects for which 
EyeQue VisionCheck refraction values are not  produced, leading to an increase in the number of 
subjects that wil l not be evaluated for the primary endpoint.  Of the approximately 160 additional 
subjects that will b e enrolled  in the study , it is anticipated tha t approximately 60 subjects will not 
be evaluable due to f ailing screening or not having refraction values produced with the EyeQue 
VisionCheck.  Additionally, the larger sample size provides a sufficiently robust database for investigations of the secondary outcomes and descriptions of the EyeQue VisionCheck’s performance characteristics.  
 
Efficacy Analysi s 
Best corrected visual acuity will be ass essed independently for each eye and the worse value for

EyeQue Corporation   
each test lens set and subject will be selected for the primary analysis.  E ach subject’s BCVA 
LogMAR score from the phoropter -based lenses  will be subtracted from the BCVA  LogMAR  
score from the EyeQ ue VisionCheck -based lenses.  The mean, SD , and two -sided 95% 
confidence interval ( CI) will be reported across all subjects  for worst eye, OD, OS, and OU, and 
if the upper bound (one -sided 95% CI) does not include the value 0.1 for the worst eye 
comparison, then non- inferiority will be declared.  This will be repeated using BCVA scores 
from the autorefractor- based lenses  and EyeQue VisionCheck- based lenses . 
Raw refraction values for the phoropter and EyeQue VisionCheck will be plotted and Pearson 
correlatio ns calculated.  This will be repeated using autorefractor and EyeQue VisionCheck 
values.  
Subject preference data will be tabulated with counts and percentages  of subjects that considered 
the EyeQue VisionCheck trial lenses better a s well as the counts and percentages  of subjects that 
considered the EyeQue VisionCheck trial lenses better or equal . 
Analyses will be repeated for each age stratum  including ages 30 through 65 and ages 
45 through 65.  
 
Safety Analyse s 
Adverse event s, ADEs,  and SAEs will be reporte d with counts and percentages.  Adverse events 
that can be associated with a particular device will be reported separately from those without clear attribution.  A subject experiencing more than 1 instance of an event will be counted only once for that event.  Analyses will be repeated for each age stratum  including ages 30 through 65 
and ages 45 through 65.

5. INTRODUCTION 
Uncorrected r efractive errors account for m ore than 40% of the major causes for visual 
impairment globally  (Pascolini D , 2010; World Health Organization, Blindness and vision 
impairment fact sheet ).  The most common types of refractive errors include myopia, hyperopia, 
presbyopia, and astigmatism .  When an individual has a n uncorrected refractive error, symptoms 
may include blurred vision, double vision, haziness, squinting, headaches, and eye  strain.  
Refractive error correction is a ccomplished through the use of eye glasses, contacts, or refractive 
surgery .  Traditionally, refraction measurements are conducted by an eye  care professional 
during a comprehensive eye exam using diagnostic device s such as a phoropter or autorefractor.  
However, not all of the population has access to optometrists/ophthalmologists and these 
diagnostic devices or can afford these exams.   Additionally, for some instances i t may be more 
convenient to be able to obtain refraction  values outside of the clinic .   
The EyeQue Corporation (EyeQue) is developing an inexpensive, portable, self -administered 
device to measure refraction values that can be used outside of the clinic.  The EyeQue VisionCheck device is a monocular  refraction system consisting of 3 components:  a mobile 
application ( app), a cloud -based processing platform, and the VisionCheck optical device that 
attaches to a  compatible  smartphone  owned/operated by the end user .  The EyeQue  app guides 
the subject through interactive measurements with the EyeQue VisionCheck device in order to 
determine refractive error.    
This is a single center, clinical evaluation study to evaluate the performance of the EyeQue 
VisionCheck device compared w ith standard eye  care diagnostic devices  of phoropter and 
autorefractor  in measuring refractive error of the eye.  The intent of this study is to determine 
whether  EyeQue VisionCheck is statistically non -inferior to the phoropter and autorefractor  in 
corre cting visual refractive errors .  The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) using trial lens 
frames prepared using refraction values from each of the 3 devices, raw refraction values from 
each device, and subject satisfaction with the 3  different trial lens f rames will be assessed during 
the study .

7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a single -center, open -label, prospective study in healthy vol unteers desiring refraction for 
correction of visual acuity  to compare the EyeQue VisionCheck with the phoropter and 
autorefractor.   Prior to enrollment of study subjects, both the phoropter and autorefractor devices 
will be calibrated following standard p ractice.  
Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled in this study to achieve a minimum of 
100 evaluable subjects.  The initial cohort included 39 subjects; therefore, approximately 
160 additional subjects will be enrolled in the study.  Subjects will be enrolled to obtain a 
population of approximately 35% in the age range of 30 through 44 years and approximately 65% in the age range of 45 through 65 years.  Subjects will be screened for study participation 
and, if enrolled, will complete the testing pr ocedures at the same visit.  Subjects will not undergo 
any study -specific screening or testing procedures until written informed consent is obtained.  A 
subject will be enrolled in the study after confirming that the subject has met all of the inclusion 
criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. 
Screening procedures   
The subject will complete the following assessments and procedures at Screening  to confirm 
eligibility :   
• demographics/ medical history/concomitant medication review,  
• slit-lamp biomicroscopy ,  
• laser retinal scan  or fundoscopy ,  
• optical coherence tomography (OCT) (retina and anterior chamber) , 
• tonometry (non contact) , 
• Ishihara color test,  
• cover test,  
• retinoscopy,  
• phoropter refraction, and  
• visual acuity with phoropter correction.   
During the OCT and laser retinal scan /fundoscopy , images will be taken of the retina, anterior 
chamber, and fundus.  All eye procedures will be completed without dilation using standard 
procedures.     
Retinoscopy will be used as a basis for further refinement by phoropter refraction.  Refraction values (sphere, cylinder, axis) for oculus dexter (OD, right eye) and oculus sinister (OS, left eye) 
will be recorded for each subject using the phoropter.  The se values will be used to adjust the 
lenses in the phoropter while the subject is looking through the device at an Early Treatment 
Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) eye chart to determine BCVA, as subjects are eligible to 
             18    Version 3.0 ( 17 June  2019)
 
 
    
Protocol EYEQUE -001 
EyeQue Corporation   
participate in the study only if their vision ( oculus uterque [ OU]; both eyes) can be corrected to 
20/20 ( logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [ LogMAR ] 0.0).     
The Screening procedures will be used to confirm that the subject does not have an exclusionary 
diagnosis.  
Testing proc edures    
Once eligibility is confirmed , the subject will be enrolled and proceed with study testing 
procedures.  T he refraction values (sphere, cylinder, axis) for each subject (OD and OS) will be 
assessed using 2 additional  devices: autorefractor  and the EyeQue VisionCheck.  Subjects will be 
assessed with the autorefractor using standard device methodology.  The refraction values generated from the EyeQue VisionCheck, the autorefractor , and the phoropter (during screening) 
will be used to prepare 3 sets of  trial lens frames.  Pupillary distance, measured using the 
autorefractor, will be recorded for all subjects and will be used for preparation of trial lens frames.      
All subjects will be trained on how to use the EyeQue VisionCheck device prior to initiating 
testing.  In order to obtain refraction values using the EyeQue VisionCheck, the subject will be 
required to take 1 practice test followed by a minimum of 3 saved tests for each eye using  the 
EyeQue VisionCheck device and mobile  app.  After completion of a set of tests (1  test for each 
eye), the subject may elect to save or discard that set of tests.  They may choose to discard for 
any reason which may include not following instruction, pressing the wrong button in error, etc.  Each test consists of the subject looking through the EyeQue VisionCheck device and using the 
app controls to fully overlap red and green bars at 9 different angles.   After completion of all 
tests (1 practice test and 3 saved tests with each eye), the refraction values will be displayed on the mobile app.  These values will be used for preparation of the trial lens frames.  If the EyeQue 
system determines that the overall test results are unreliable, s ubjects may have to complete  3 
additional tests  per eye b efore the system may be able to provide refraction values .  Subjects will 
not be allowed to complete more than 6 saved  tests and 1 practice with each eye.  The system 
evaluates the s tatistical s pread of the test results taken by the subject .  If the spread is too large, 
the results are considered  to be unreliable  and values will not be provided.  Such spread can be 
due to testing error, improper instruction, etc.  
After collection of refraction values from each device (phoropter, autorefractor, and EyeQue VisionCheck), the 3 trial lens frames will be prepared and given to the subject in a mask ed 
fashion.  Best corrected visual acuity will be assessed using the ETDRS eye chart.  For each 
subject, BCVA LogMAR scores will be collected for OD, OS,  and OU) for each of the 3 trial 
lens frames.  Subject s will also be asked a question regarding overall satisfaction with visual 
acuity using each of the 3 trial lens frames.   Subjects will be monitored for adverse events (AEs) 
and adverse device effects (ADEs) during the study .    
Appendix 1 presents the schedule of assessments for the study.  Section 11 de tails the study 
evaluations for screening and testing at the 1 study visit .   
7.2. Number of Subjects  
Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled in this study to achieve a minimum of 
100 evaluable subjects.  The initial cohort included 39 subjects; therefore, approximately 
             19    Version 3.0 ( 17 June  2019)  
 
    
Protocol EYEQUE -001 
EyeQue Corporation   
160 additional subjects will be enrolled in the study.  Subjects will be enrolled to obtain a 
population of approximately 35% in the age range of 30 through 44 years and approximately 
65% in the age range of 45 through 65 years.  
7.3. Study Endpoints  
7.3.1. Efficacy Endpoints  
Primary Endpoint:   
• Statistical non -inferiority of EyeQue VisionCheck  compared with phoropter assessed 
by BCVA (OD, OS, and OU ) measured using trial lens frames that correct the 
refractive error measured by each device analyzed with age stratum 45 through 
65 years.  
Secondary Endpoints:  
• Comparison of raw refraction values produced using the EyeQue VisionCheck and the phoropter  analyzed with age strata 30 through 65 years and 45 through 65 years . 
• Statistical non -inferiority of EyeQue VisionCheck  compared with autorefractor 
assessed by BCVA ( OD, OS, and OU) measured using trial lens frames that correct 
the refractive error measured by each device,  analyzed with age strata 30 through 
65 years and 45 through 65 years .   
• Comparison of raw refraction values produced using the EyeQue VisionCheck and the autor efractor  analyzed with age strata 30 through 65 and 45 through 65 years . 
• Statistical non -inferiority of EyeQue VisionCheck  compared with phoropter assessed 
by BCVA (OD, OS, and OU) measured using trial lens frames that correct the refractive error measured by each device analyzed with  the age 
stratum 30 through 65 years .   
Exploratory Endpoint:  
• Subject preference of trial lens frames that correct the refractive error meas ured by 
each of the 3 device s:  EyeQue VisionCheck, phoropter, and autorefractor  
7.3.2. Safety Endpoints  
If any adverse events occur during the study, t he safety endpoints will include the frequency and 
severity of AEs , ADEs,  and serious adverse events (SAEs) . 
7.4. Rationale for Study Design and Control Group  
A clinical study  based on statistical non- inferiority is the most appropriate means to assess the 
effectiveness and performance of the EyeQue VisionCheck device relative to the comparator  
devices , the phoropter  and autorefractor , that are standard eye  care diagnostic devices  used to 
obtain refraction values.   
Masking of the subject s and assessors to the re fraction values used to prepare  the 3 trial lens 
frames  is appropriate to control and minimize bias  in the a ssessment of BCVA  as these L ogMAR 
             20    Version 3.0 ( 17 June  2019)  
 
    
Protocol EYEQUE -001 
EyeQue Corporation   
scores will be used for determination of statistical non- inferiority.   A statistical non- inferiority 
margin of 0.1 LogMAR  has been chosen because the one -line ETDRS difference is an 
acceptable boundary for corrected visual  acuity, with larger differences likely to be unacceptable 
to patients and smaller differences difficult to reliably detect and/or reproduce.   
Based on the intended use for obtaining refraction values , a one -day evaluation is appropriate 
because standar d-of-care eye exams in which refraction values are obtained are typically 
repeated on a periodic basis, such as yearly, and it is not anticipated that refraction values would 
change over a short duration where additional repeated measurements would be necess ary for 
this study .  Visual acuity may fluctuate often; however, there is no appreciable change over a 
period of a several  months.   
The design allows for enrollment of subjects 30 to 65 years because subjects younger than 
30 years of age are more likely t o have visual accommodation that would add complexity to this 
comparative study.  Younger subjects may be assessed in a separate clinical study.

9. TEST ARTICLE  
9.1. Description  
The investigational device is the EyeQue VisionCheck, and the inten ded use is to measure the 
refractive error of the eye .  The EyeQue VisionCheck  is a self -administered, portable, monocular  
refraction system consisting of 3 main components:  a mobile app, a cloud- based processing 
platform, and the VisionCheck optical devi ce that attaches to a  compatible smartphone  
owned/operated by the end user .  The EyeQue app guides the subject through interactive 
measurements with the EyeQue VisionCheck device in order to determine refractive error.  The 
device and mobile app operate on the inverse Shack -Hartmann principle described in patent US  
8783871 B2, “Near Eye Tool for Refraction Assessment” ( Pamplona V , US Patent , 2014) . 
The EyeQue VisionCheck device is manufactured for EyeQue Corporation.   
9.2. Packaging, Labeling , and Dispensing  
All material containers will be appropriately labeled with the study number  and product 
identification as applicable, as well as any other information as required by applicable 
regulations.   
The compatible smartphones a nd access to the app will be provided to the sites to be used with 
the EyeQue VisionCheck.   
9.3. Storage and Accountability  
All test articles will be stored in a secure location at the investigational site.   
A log of all test articles received and used during  the study will be maintained by the study site.  
All test articles will be accounted for at the termination of the study and a written explanation 
provided for any discrepancies.  The EyeQue VisionCheck devices and smartphones  will be 
returned to EyeQue.  Shipping and handling of all test articles will conform to regulations for 
investigational devices.     
9.4. Device Risk Analysis and Risk Assessment  
The device risk analysis and risk assessment were  conducted in compliance with 21 CFR 820.  
Based on this asse ssment, t he EyeQue VisionCheck is non- invasive and considered a low -risk 
device that require s periorbital surface contact .  Even if the EyeQue VisionCheck is misused, the 
likelihood it will cause harm is low.   The comparators  in this study , phoropter and autorefractor, 
are used as part of standard eye exams .  Most of the anticipated adverse effects are generally well  
tolerated and would be expected to occur infrequently.  The risk and impact of these adverse  
effects is low.  
Based on the design and the inte nded use of the EyeQue VisionC heck, and g iven the low risk of 
potential adverse effects, this is considered a nonsignificant risk medical device study  that is 
subject to abbreviated investigational device exemption (IDE)  regulations , and exempt from the 
requirement to submit an IDE application.

The following adverse effects may potentially occur with the use of the EyeQue VisionCheck  
device itself, the comparator s, or the procedure used for the device : 
• Transient blurred vision  
• Transient dizziness  
• Headache  
• Transient eye irritation   
• Superficial eye or periorbital infection  
The following approaches have been used to minimize risk in this investigation:     
• Subjects will be screened before receiving treatment to ensure they meet the 
protocol -defined inclusion and exclusion criteria .  The inclusion and exclusion 
criteria have been developed to ensure appropriate subjects are included in the studied population and subjects with confounding conditions or conditions that could put 
them at risk are  excluded from participation.  
• The test articles (investiga tional and comparator devices) are intended for measuring 
refraction values and/or accessing BCVA .  To minimize risk during the evaluations, 
the site staff will be trained on all devices and subject s will be instructed how to use 
each device.  The phoropter and autorefractor are both operated by the site staff.  The EyeQue VisionCheck device will be operated by the subject  and subjects will be 
trained in advance of completing testing with the device .  The mobile app provides 
detailed instructions on how to operate the EyeQue VisionCheck device.  Detailed instructions for the site staff to provide to subjects about the EyeQue VisionCheck are  
provided in the study operations manual . 
• To minimize the risk  of eye irritation or infection, the device s will be sanitized 
between users.  
• Adverse device effects will be monitored throughout the study by site staff .   
If an adverse event occurs, site staff will  follow medical procedures appropriate to the type of 
event.

• Best corrected visual acuity  (LogMAR scores  for OD, OS, and OU ) assessed using 
the phor opter refraction values and ETDRS eye chart ; subjects are eligible to 
participate in the study only if their vision can be corrected to 20/20 (LogMAR 0.0)    
All eye procedures will be completed without dilation using standard procedures.  
11.2.1.2. Testing procedures    
Once eligibility is confirmed , the subject will be enrolled and proceed with study testing 
procedures.  
The following testing procedures and assessments will be completed:  
• Refraction values (sphere, cylinder, axis)  for OD and OS  using the autorefractor  
• Measurement of pupillary distance  using the autorefractor; pupillary distance w ill be 
used for preparation of trial lens frames

Protocol EYEQUE -001 
EyeQue Corporation   
• Refraction values (sphere, cylinder, axis)  for OD and OS  using the EyeQue 
VisionCheck; all subjects will be trained on how to use the EyeQue VisionCheck 
device prior to initiating testing  
In order to obtain refraction values using the EyeQue VisionCheck, the subject will be required 
to take 1 practice test followed by a minimum of 3 saved tests for each eye using the EyeQue 
VisionCheck device and mobile app. After completion of a set of tests (1  test for each eye), the 
subject may elect to save or discard that set of tests.  They may choose to discard for any reason 
which may include not following instruction, pressing the w rong button in error, etc.  Each test 
consists of the subject looking through the VisionCheck device and using the app cont rols to 
fully overlap red and green bars at 9 different angles.  After completion of all tests (1 practice test and 3 saved tests wit h each eye), the refraction values will be displayed on the mobile app.  
If the EyeQue system determines that the overall  test results are unreliable, s ubjects may have to 
complete 3 additional tests per eye before the system may be able to provide refract ion values.  
Subjects will not be allowed to complete more than 6 saved tests and 1 practice test with each 
eye.  If the EyeQue system determines that the  overall  test results are unreliable, no values will 
be provided.  
• Best corrected visual acuity (LogMAR  scores  for OD, OS, and OU ) assessed  using 
the ETDRS eyechart and trial lens frames produced from:  
− Phoropter refraction values  
− Autorefractor refraction values  
− EyeQue VisionCheck refraction values  
*Subject and assessor will be masked  to the refraction values used to produce the 
trial lens frames  
• Subject preference regarding each of the trial lens frames   
• Adverse event recording 
11.2.1.3. Early Termination  
Unless otherwise indicated, subjects will be discontinued from the study if any of the fol lowing 
events occur:  
• The subject wants to withdraw from the study.  
• The subject is non- compliant with the study protocol  
• The subject has no refraction values produced with the EyeQue VisionCheck device  
• At the investigator’s discretion, continued testing is  medically contraindicated.  
The reason(s) for premature discontinuation from the study will be recorded.

12. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
12.1. Efficacy Assessments  
Results from all efficacy assessments will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF pages.   
12.1.1. Best Corrected Visual Acuity  
Best corrected visual acuity will be  measured using trial lens fram es prepared based on the 
refractive error measured by each device including the EyeQue VisionCheck, phoropter , and 
autorefractor .  Best corrected visual acuity will be assessed using the ETDRS eye chart.  For 
each subject, BCVA logMAR scores will be collected for OD, OS, and OU for each of the 3 trial 
lens frames.   
12.1.2. Refraction Values  
Refraction values (sphere, cylinder, axis) for OD and OS will be recorded for ea ch subject using 
the EyeQue VisionCheck, phoropter, and autorefractor.  The  refraction values will be used to 
prepare 3 sets of trial lens frames .    
12.1.3. Subjec t Preference  
Subject s will be asked which of the  3 trial lens frames  affords them the best overall v isual acuity .  
Subjects will be asked to order the  trial lens  frames by which frame (s) provides  the best vision.  
A tie is  permitted when a subject feels 2 or more frames afford indistinguishable differences in 
visual acuity .   
12.2. Safety Assessments  
All subjects who enter the study will be assessed for safety.  Safety will be monitored by observation of and direct inquiry regarding AEs during the study visit.  
12.2.1. Adverse E vents  
All AEs , ADEs, and SAEs  will be collected from the start of informed consent through the end 
of the study visit .  Details regarding AE  definitions, collection, recording, and reporting are 
found in Section 12.3. 
12.2.2. Demographics and Medical History  
Demographic i nformation relating to the subject’s sex, age, race, ethnicity , and medical history  
will be  collected during the Screening procedures and recorded on the appropr iate eCRF pag e. 
12.2.3. Concomitant Medications/Therapies  
All concomitant medications /therapies  will be recorded in the subject source documentation.  
The prohibited and/or allowed concom itant medications/therapies for the study are discussed in 
Section 10.1.

12.3. Adverse E vents 
12.3.1. Adverse Events, Adverse Device Effects, and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be re corded throughout the study and will be coded using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
The investigator is responsible for the de tection and documentation of AEs and ADEs .  For all 
AEs/ADEs , the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate to dete rmine the 
outcome of the AE and to assess whether the AE meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
requiring  immediate notification to the s ponsor or its designated representative. 
12.3.1.1. Definitions of Terms  
12.3.1.1.1. Adverse Even ts  
Any undesirable clinical occurrences observed in subjects during an investigational clinical 
study .  In addition to novel e vents , an AE  may be an exacerbation of a pre- existing medical 
condition that was present before the subject was assigned to a treatment group.   
12.3.1.1.2. Serious Adverse Even t  
Adverse events considered serious are those that result in one or more of the following  
• Death 
• Immediately life -threatening  
NOTE:  The term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at 
immediate risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Result in hospitalization or pr olongation of a n existing  hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Important medical events that are not fatal, life -threatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the subject and may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Non-serious adverse events are all other adverse e vents not deemed serious. 
12.3.1.1.3. Adverse Device Effect  
An adverse device effect is an AE that is suspected to be related to the device.  Adverse device 
effects can be either anti cipated, which means that they have been previously identified in this 
protocol or the investigator’s brochure, or unanticipated.  
             31    Version 3.0 ( 17 June  2019)
 
 
    
Protocol EYEQUE -001 
EyeQue Corporation   
12.3.1.1.4. Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  
An u nanticipated ADE  (UADE) is any serious adverse effect on health or safety, any life -
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that effect, problem, or 
death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the application; 
or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a  device that relates to the rights, 
safety, or welfare of subjects.   
12.4. Severity of Adverse Events  
The study site will grade the clinical severity of AEs experienced by study participants as either:  
• Mild:  Causes no limitation of usual activities  
• Moderate:  Causes some limitation of usual activities  
• Severe:  Prevents or severely limits usual activities  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the regulatory criteria i n Section  12.3.1.1.2. 
12.5. Relationship to Test Article 
An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable 
possibility that the investigational device caused or contributed t o an AE  and must be provided 
for all AEs  (serious and non- serious).  
The s ponsor’s determination of attribution will be used for reporting to the appropriate health 
authorities.  The relation of an AE  to study participation will be determined using the des criptors 
and definitions provided in Table 1. 
Table  1: Attribution of adverse events  
Not R elated  The AE is clearly/most probably caused by other etiologies such as participant’s 
underlying condition, therapeutic intervention or concomitant therapy, or the 
delay between administration and the onset of the AE is incompatible with a 
causal relation, or the AE star ted before administration (screening phase).  
Therefore, there is not a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the 
investigational device.  
Related  There is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the investigational 
device.  The expression “reasonable possibility” is meant to convey in general 
that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.   
The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational device.  Any AE that is suspected to be related to the EyeQue Visio nCheck, phoropter, or the autorefractor  will be 
classified as an ADE .

Protocol EYEQUE -001 
EyeQue Corporation   
12.6. Recording Adverse Events  
All AEs , regardless of relatedness to the use of the test article, are to be recorded on the 
appropriate AE page (either serious or non -serious) in the eCRF throughout the study.  All 
adverse effects during the study will be documented in the subject's medical record.  This 
information will then be transcribed on the AE page of the eCRF by designated study personnel.  Required information includes a description of the event, date of onset, date of r esolution, the 
action taken to manage the AE, the subsequent outcome, and severity.  
Adverse events resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. 
All AEs /ADEs  must be follow ed to adequate resolution or stabilization.  If the AE/ADE has not 
resolved or stabilized by the time the subject completes the single study visit, the investigator 
will follow the status of the subject's AE/ADE for at least 7 days beyond the subject's final study 
visit, unless directed otherwise by the s ponsor.  
12.7. Reporting SAEs  and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect s 
For reporting of SAEs  and UADEs , the following process ensures compliance with  21 CFR  812 
and International Conference on Harmoni sation  (ICH) guidelines.  Investigators and other study 
center staff must inform Rho Product Safety representatives of any SAE /UADE  that occurs 
(whether or not attributable to the study drug) in the study within 24 hours  of when he or she 
becomes aware of the SAE /UADE .  It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that 
SAE /UADE  reporting procedures are followed appropriately.  In addition, the investigator must 
ensure that these events are entered on the SAE /UADE  eCRF  via Rave electronic data capture 
(EDC ) or via paper form, if Rave EDC is unavailable .  The form will be entered into EDC or 
faxed  to the Rho Product Safety p ersonnel within  24 hours .  The following variables will be 
recorded for each AE:  verbatim/AE description, time and date for AE start and stop, m aximum 
intensity, seriousness, causality rating, whether or not the AE caused the subject  to discontinue, 
and the outcome.

13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Power and Sample Size Determination  
Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled in this study to achieve a mini mum of 
100 evaluable subjects  to assess the effectiveness and safety of the EyeQue VisionCheck.  The 
initial cohort included 39 subjects; therefore, approximately 160 additional subjects will be 
enrolled in the study.  Based on prior study  data, reject ion of  non- inferiority bounds  of 0.1 
LogMAR (one line) and 0.05 LogMAR (one -half line) would require approximately 10 and 40 
subjects, respectively, with 90% power on the BCVA from the resulting lens from each 
approach.  This assumes the devices are roughly equivalent and the standard deviation (SD) is 
0.077; th ese data are  based on a previous version of the EyeQue VisionCheck device  tested 
against an autorefractor.   The proposed sample size has been inflated to allow for the possibility 
that a larger standard deviation will be observed in the current study , as well as to allow for 
comparisons within each stratum .  A software error in the EyeQue app was identified  and the 
algorithm for the EyeQue  app was updated with more stringent parameters which may also 
impact the number of evaluable subjects.  Due to the updates to the parameters, there may be additional subjects for which EyeQue VisionCheck refraction values are not  produced, leading to 
an increase in the number of subjects that will not be evaluated for the primary endpoint.  Of the 
approximately 160 additional subjects that will be enrolled in the study, it is anticipated that approximately 60 subjects will not be evaluable due to failing s creening or not having refrac tion 
values produced with the  EyeQue VisionCheck.  Additionally, the larger sample size provides a 
sufficiently robust database for investigations of the secondary outcomes and descriptions of the EyeQue VisionCheck ’s performan ce characteristics.  
13.2. Analysis Populations  
Two analysis populations are defined for this study.  
Modified Intent to Treat Population:  All subjects that perform BCVA for trial frames with 
test lens es based on both phoropter and EyeQue VisionCheck. 
Safety Population:  All subjects that meet the screening criteria and are enrolled in the study.    
 
After enrollment in this study was initiated, a  software  error was identified in the EyeQue app 
used with the EyeQue VisionCheck.  The software error was co rrected and the algorithm for the 
EyeQue app was updated.  An initial cohort of 39 subjects was enrolled in the study prior to 
these changes being implemented.  Due to these EyeQue app updates, this initial cohort of 39 subjects will be excluded from the analysis populations and any safety information for these subjects will be listed separately.   
 
13.3. Efficacy Analyses  
Best corrected visual acuity will be assessed independently for each eye and the worse value for 
each test lens set and subject will be selected for the primary analysis.  E ach subject’s BCVA 
LogMAR score from the phoropter -based lenses  will be subtracted from the BCVA  LogMAR  
             35    Version 3.0 ( 17 June  2019)  
     
Protocol EYEQUE -001 
EyeQue Corporation   
score from the EyeQue VisionCheck -based lenses.  The mean, SD , and two -sided 95% 
confidence interval ( CI) will be reported across all subjects  for worst eye, OD, OS, and OU, and 
if the upper bound (one sided 95% CI) does not include the value 0.1 for the worst eye 
comparison, then non- inferiority will be declared.  This will be repeated using BCVA scores 
from  the autorefractor- based lenses  and EyeQue VisionCheck- based lenses . 
Raw refraction values for the phoropter and VisionCheck will be plotted and Pearson 
correlations calculated.  This will be repeated using autorefractor and EyeQue VisionCheck 
values.  
Subject preference data will be tabulated with counts and percentages  of subj ects that considered 
the EyeQue VisionCheck trial lenses better a s well as the counts and percentages  of subj ects that 
considered the  EyeQue  VisionCheck trial lenses better or equal . 
Analyses will be repeated for each age stratum including ages 30 through 65 and ages 45 through 65.  
13.4. Safety Analyses  
13.4.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse event s, ADEs,  UADEs, and SAEs will be reported with counts and percentages.  
Adverse events that can be associated with a particular device will be reported separately from those without clear attribution.  Adverse events  will be coded using MedDRA terminology.  A 
subject experiencing more than 1 instance of an event will be counted only once for that event.  Analyses will be repeated for each age stratum including ages 30 through 65 and ages 45 through 65.  Unanticipated ADEs will be flagged in the by -subject listings of all A Es.

BCVA = best corrected visual acuity; ETDRS = Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study; OD = oculus dexter, 
right eye; OS = oculus sinister, left eye; OU = oculus uterque, both eyes  
Note:  All eye procedures will be completed without dilating the eye.  
1 Images will be taken during this procedure.  
2 Results will be used as a basis for further refinement  by phoropter refraction. 
3 Best corrected visual acuity will be measured using the ETDRS eye chart; values will be recorded for OD, OS, and 
OU. 
4 All subjects will be trained on how to use the EyeQue VisionCheck device prior to initiating testing.  
5 Trial frames prepared from refraction values from each of the 3 devices will be provided to the subjects in a 
masked  fashion and BCVA for each trial lens frames will be measured.

CONFIDENTIAL  escalated if 0 of the first 3 evaluable subjects enrolled  has a DLT.  If 1 of the first 3 evaluable subjects 
enrolled has a DLT, then the cohort will be expanded to include 3 additional evaluable subjects, and if no 
DLT occurs in the additional 3 subjects, then the dose will be escalated.  If a DLT occurs in one-third or more of the expanded cohort, then the MTD will be deemed to be exceeded and the previous dose lev el 
will be considered the MTD.  If a DLT occurs at the 20.0 mg/kg dose, then a dose level of 15.0 mg/kg may be explored pending safety review.  If on ly 3 subjects were treated at the MTD or PAD, then a 
minimum of 3  additional evaluable subjects will be enrolled at this dose before it  is administered in Part  2 
of the study.   
If Cohort 1 (0.03 mg/kg; starting dose) exceeds the MTD, the sponsor and inves tigators will consider 
dosing INCAGN01876 at 0.01 mg/kg (Cohort -1), and/or investigate 0.03 mg/kg at alternate dose 
schedules,  based on available safety, PK,  data.  If an alternate schedule is tested and 
determined to be safe, re- escalat ion of INCAGN01876 will proceed according to the table below. 
Throughout the treatment period, if > 33% of subjects (a minimum of  6 subjects ) experience a ≥ Grade  3 
toxicity related to study drug after completing ≥ 4 cycles, then dose administration will be stopped, and 
the MNTD will be determined in conjunction with the investigators and sponsor based on all available 
safety data.  
Additional subjects wi ll be enrolled in a cohort to achieve the minimum of 3 evaluable subjects.  Subjects 
who drop out for reasons other than a DLT (eg, events clearly associated with the underlying disease, 
disease progression, concomitant medication, or comorbidity), during the 28-day DLT observation period 
will be considered nonevaluable and will be replaced.  Dose modifications should not be made during the 
DLT observation period without discussion with the medical monitor.  Intrasubject dose escalation is not permitted; ho wever,  once the recommended Part 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule has been determined, 
ongoing subjects in Part 1 may be permitted to escalate to the RP2D with approval of the medical monitor.  The cohorts and dose levels are shown in the table below.

Part 1  – Safety Expansion  
In order to  confirm the preliminary safety of the 
dose escalation cohorts, Part 1 of the study may include safety expansion cohorts evaluating doses and 
schedules equivalent to or lower than the highest dose levels determined to be safe and/or doses 
determined to be pharmacologically active.  Fixed doses of INCAGN01876 (equivalent to or less than the 
MTD/PAD determined during dose escalation), may also be explored during the safety expansion.  All doses and schedules explored during the safety expansion will depend on PK,  and safety 
results.  
Approximately 36 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in the Part 1 safety expansion, with each cohort 
enrolling approximately 9 e valuable subjects .  If < 3 of 9 evaluable subjects experience a DLT, the cohort 

Incyte Europe Sàrl   Page 6 of 99 
Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  will be deemed safe.  If > 1 safety expansion cohort is deemed safe, then a recommended dose and 
schedule will be determined in conjunction with the investigators and sponsor based on all available 
safety, PK,  results.  The safety expansion cohorts may be conducted in parallel to 
Part 2 and may be limited by the sponsor to subjects with specific tumor types to achieve a balance across 
cohorts. 
Part 2  − Dose Exp ansion 
Part 2 of the study will further evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, PK, and pharmacologic activity of the RP2D of INCAGN01876 in subjects with advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, melanoma, NSCLC (squamous and nonsquamous), and RCC.  Each 
cohort will comprise of an individual tumor type.  A Simon 2-stage design will be utilized with a stopping 
rule to allow for early termination of a particular cohort at the end of Stage 1 if there are insufficient responses observed.  During Stage 1, 9 evaluable subjects will be enrolled  in each  cohort; if no responses 
are observed within the cohort then the cohort will be discontinued.  If at least 1 response is observed, 
8 additional evaluable subjects will be enrolled in the cohort (Stage 2), for a maximum of 17 evaluable 
subjects per cohort.   
Subjects will continue to receive INCAGN01876 at the RP2D and schedule until Protocol-defined 
withdrawal criteria are met.  Continuous evaluation of toxicity events will be performe d throughout 
enrollment in Part 2 of the study.  If the cumulative incidence of DLTs occu rs in ≥ 33% of subjects after 
6 subjects have been observed for at least 28 days, further enrollment may be interrupted until the sponsor 
has determined the appropriate course of action.  All AE s, regardless of the time of occurrence on study 
may be consid ered in determining the appropriate dose, schedule, and MNTD. 
Toxicity will continue to be monitored  throughout the treatment period.  If > 33% of subjects (minimum 
of 6 subjects ) experience a ≥ Grade 3 toxicity related to study drug after completing ≥ 4 c ycles,  then the 
MNTD will be determined in conjunction with the investigators and sponsor based on all available safety 
data.

INCAGN01876  Dosage, and Mode of Administration:  
Part 1  and Part 2:   INCAGN01876 will be administered intravenously over a 30-minute period on Day 1 
of eac h cycle.  Subjects will continue to receive INCAGN01876, up to a defined maximum number of 
cycles,  as long as the subject is deriving benefit and has not met any of the protocol defined conditions for 
treatment withdrawal.  
Duration of treatment (maximum nu mber of cycles) will be determined based on safety during Part 1, and 
may be fewer than the absolute maximum number of cycles as outlined below:  
• For a 14- day cycle: maximum of 26 cycles  
• For a 21- day cycle: maximum of 17 cycles  
• For a 28- day cycle: maximum of 13 cycles  
Reference Therapy, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:   Not applicable 
Study Schedule/Procedures:    
Subjects will have regularly scheduled study visits at the clinical site on Day 1 of each cycle.  Additional 
study visits may be required du ring some cycles to monitor for safety, efficacy, or for PK  evaluations.  
Study visits are as follows:  
• Screening :  up to 28 days before enrollment.  Screening will begin at the time that the subject signs 
the informed consent and will continue until the date the subject is enrolled in the study 
(Cycle  1 Day  1). 

Incyte Europe Sàrl   Page 10 of 99 
Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  • Cycle 1 and Cycle 6:  Day 1 , Day 2,  and Day 7  (± 1 day) . 
• Cycle 2:  Day 1 (± 1 day) and Day 7 (± 1 day). 
• All other  treatment cycles:  Day 1 (± 3 days) . 
• Efficacy assessments:  Every 8 weeks (± 7 days ) for 12 months, and then every 12 weeks (± 7 days) 
thereafter until disease progression is determined.  
• End of treatment : ± 3 days . 
• Safety follow -up: 30 days (+ 7 days) and 60 days (+ 7 days) after end of treatment . 
Safety Assessments:    
Subjects will have regularly scheduled study visits at the clinical site on Day 1 of every cycle where 
targeted physical examinations, vital sign collection, ECOG performance status, collection of concomitant 
medications, and AE assessment s will be performed.  A 12- lead ECG  will be performed at screening, 
Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 1, and then Day 1 of every other cycle after Cycle 2  (eg, Cycle  4, Cycle 6, 
Cycle 8).  Triplicate ECG  measurements will be performed at Screening, Cycle 1 Day 1, and Cycle 6 
Day 1, in conjunction with PK assessments.  Laboratory assessments will be collected on Day 1 of each 
cycle, with m ore frequent blood sample collection during the first and second cycles (Day 1 and Day 7) to 
evaluate for DLTs.  Toxicities will be monitored continuously and will be graded using the NCI 
CTCAE  v4.03 criteria. 
On Day 1 of the first 4 cycles (Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1, and Cycle 4 Day 1), 
subjects will be required to stay at the study site for at least  4 hours after infusion of study drug for safety  
observation.  It is recommended that the subject does not leave the site for any reason during the safety observation period.  During the safety observation period, subjects will be assessed for the onset of acute 
AEs. 
Regular telephone conferences with s tudy investigators will be scheduled by the sponsor in order to 
review cohort -specific data and overall safety data, agree on dose escalat ion, adjudicate individual 
high-grade AEs as potentially dose-limiting, and guide other major study decisions. 
Efficac y Assessments:  
Disease assessments will be performed based on RECIST v1.1 and also on a modified form of 
RECIST  v1.1 (referred to as mRECIST) to account for the unique tumor response characteristics seen 
with immunotherapy.  Modified RECIST will be defined  as RECIST v1.1 with required confirmation of 
disease progression in the absence of clinical deterioration.  The best overall response for subjects will be 
defined as the best overall response occurring during treatment, even if this assessment occurs afte r an 
initial assessment of progressive disease.  
Assessment of tumor size (by magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography  scan) will be 
performed at screening or baseline (before beginning therapy) and every 8 weeks for 12  months, and then 
every 12 we eks thereafter until disease progression is determined.  Disease progression is defined as 
progression confirmed by a second, consecutive assessment at least 4  weeks, but no later than 6 weeks 
apart with the option for continuing treatment while awaiting radiographic confirmation of progression 
where feasible, provided that the subject meets the following definition of clinical stabi lity: 
• Absence of clinically significant signs and symptoms (including worsening of laboratory values) indicating disease progression. 
• No decline in ECOG performance status.  
• Absence of rapid progression of disease.  
• Absence of progressive tumors at critical anatomical sites (eg, cord compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention.  
Subjects who discontinue study drug for a reason other than disease progression will continue to be 
assessed for their disease status during the follow -up phase and should continue to have tumor 
assessments every 8 weeks for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks thereafter until a new cancer therapy is started, disease progression, death, or the end of the study.

CONFIDENTIAL  in the target lesions, no unequivocal increase in nontarget lesions, and no additional new lesions 
develop (nonworsening disease progression) to continue study treatment (see Section  7.7.1).  
In determining whether or not the tumor burden has increased or decreased, site study team should consider all target lesions as well as nontarget lesions  (refer to RECIST v1.1 guidelines). 
Scenarios where disease progression  is confirmed at repeat imaging : 
• Tumor burden remains ≥ 20% and at least 5 mm absolute increase compared with nadir. 
• Nontarget disease resulting in initial disease progression  is worse (qualitative).  
• New lesion resulting in initial disease progression  is worse (qualitative).  
• Additional new lesion(s) since last evaluation. 
When feasible, subjects should not be discontinued until progression is confirmed.  This 
allowance to continue treatment despite initial radiologic progression takes into account the 
observation that some subjects can have a transient tumor f lare in the first few months after the 
start of immunotherapy, but with subsequent disease response.  Subjects that are deemed 
clinically unstable are not required to have repeat imaging for confirmation of disease 
progression.  
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOI NTS 
2.1. Study Objectives  
2.1.1. Primary Objective  
• To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and dose- limiting toxicities ( DLTs ) of 
INCAGN01876, and to define a MTD or PAD of INCAGN01876  in subjects with 
advanced or metastatic solid tumors. 
2.1.2. Secondary Objectives 
• To evaluate the PK of INCAGN01876 in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid 
tumors. 
• To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of INCAGN01876 by assessing the objective 
response rate, duration of response, and rate of disease control  per RECIST v1.1 and 
modified RECIST v1.1 (further referred to as mRECIST v1.1). 
• To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of INCAGN01876 by assessing PFS per 
RECIST v1.1 and mRECIST v1.1.

schedule is tested and determined to be safe, r e-escalation of INCAGN01876  will proceed 
according to Table 2. 
Throughout the treatment period, if > 33% of subjects (a minimum of 6 subjects) experience a 
≥ Grade 3 toxicity related to study drug after completing ≥ 4 cycles, then dose administration 
will be stopped, and the MNTD will be determined in conjunction with the investigators and 
sponsor based on all available safety data.  
Additional subjects will be enrolled in a cohort to achieve the minimum of 3 evaluable subjects.  
Subjects who drop out for reasons other than a DLT (eg, events clearly associated with the 
underlying disease, disease progression, concomitant medication, or comorbidity) during the 28-day DLT observation period will be considered  nonevaluabl e and will be  replaced.  Dose 
modifications should not be made during the DLT observation period without discussion with the medical monitor.  Intrasubject dose escalation is not permitted; however, once the RP2D and schedule has been determined , ongoing s ubjects in Part 1 may be permitted to escalate to the 
RP2D with approval of the medical monitor.  The cohorts and dose levels are shown in Table 2.

4.1.2. Part 1 – Safety Expansion 
In order to  confirm the preliminary safety 
of the dose escalation cohorts, Part 1 of the study may include safety expansion cohorts evaluating doses and schedules equivalent to or lower than the highest dose levels determined to 
be safe and/or doses determined to be pharmacologically active.  Fixed doses of INCAGN01876 (equivalent to or less than the MTD/PAD determined during dose escalation), may also be explored during the safety expansion.  All doses and schedules explored during the safety 
expansion will depend on PK,  and safety results. 
Approximately 36 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in the Part 1 safety expansion, with e ach 
cohort enroll ing approximately 9 evaluable subjects.  If < 3 of 9 evaluable subjects experience a 
DLT, then the cohort will be deemed safe.  If > 1 safety expan sion cohort is deemed safe, then a 
recommended  dose and schedule will be determined in conjunction with the investigators and

CONFIDENTIAL  sponsor based on all available safety, PK,  results.  The safety expansion 
cohorts may be conducted in parallel to Part 2 and may be limited by the sponsor to subjects with 
specific tumor types to achieve a balance across cohorts.  
4.1.3. Part 2 – Dose Expansion 
Part 2 of the study will further evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, PK, and 
pharmacologic activity of the RP2D of INCAGN01876 in subjects with advanced or metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, melanoma, NSCLC (squamous and nonsquamous), and 
RCC.  Each cohort will comprise an individual tumor type.  A Simon 2- stage design will be 
utilized with a stopping rule to allow early termination of a particular cohort at the end of Stage 1 
if there are insufficient responses observed.  During Stage 1, 9 evaluable subjects will be 
enrolled  in each cohort; if no responses are observed within the cohort, then the cohort will be 
discontinued.  If at least 1 response is observed, then 8 additional evaluable subjects will be 
enrolled in the cohort (Stage 2), for a maximum of 17 evaluable subjects per cohort.   
Subjects will continue to receive INCAGN01876 at the RP2D and schedule until Protocol-defined withdrawal criteria are met.  Continuous evaluation of toxicity events will be 
performed throughout enrollment in Part 2 of the study.  If the cumulative incidence of DLTs 
occurs in ≥ 33% of subjects after 6 subjects have been observed for at least 28 days, further enrollment may be interrupted until the sponsor has determined the appropriate course of action.  
All AEs, regardless of the time of occurrence on study , may be considered in determining the 
appropriate dose, schedule, and MNTD. 
Toxicity will continue to be monitored throughout the treatment period.  If > 33% of subjects 
(minimum of 6 subjects) experience a ≥ Grade 3 toxicity related to study drug after completing 
≥ 4 cycles,  then the MNTD will be determined in conjunction with the investigators and sponsor 
based on all available safety data.

5. TREATMENT  
5.1. Treatment Assignment  
5.1.1. Subject Numbering and Treatment Assignment  
All subject numbers will be 6 digits; the first 3 digits will be the site number , and the last 3 digits 
will be the subject's number.  This subject number will be maintained throughout the study and 
will not be reassigned.  Subjects who withdraw consent or discontinue from the study after being 
assigned a subject number will retain their number. 
This is a nonrandomized study, in which subjects will be enrolled into either Part 1 or Part 2 as 
described previously, with all subjects receiving INCAGN01876  (herein referred to as study 
drug).  Site staff will contact the interactive web response system ( IWRS ) at the time of 
screening, when enrolling subjects, and when ordering study drug for all treatment cycles, as 
well as to discontinue subjects from treatment.   Refer to the IWRS manual for detailed 
information. 
5.1.2. Randomization and Blinding  
This is an open-label nonrandomized study; therefore , randomization and blinding do not apply. 
5.2. Study Drug  
5.2.1. Description and Administration 
The study drug (INCAGN01876) is in liquid form in the formulation buffer of 10 mM histidine, 
7% sucrose, pH 6.0 at a strength of 10 mg/mL to be used for IV infusion.  The infusion site should not be used for blood sampling.   
Study drug will be diluted in 0.9 % normal saline  and administered by qualified personnel as an 
IV infusion over a 30-minute period on Day 1 of each cycle.  In Part  1, subjects will be 
administered study drug, according to cohor t enrollment ( Table 2).   In Part  2, subjects will be 
administered study drug  at the RP2D and schedule.  Subjects will continue to receive 
INCAGN01876, up to the defined maximum number of cycles, as long as the subje ct is deriving 
benefit and has not met any of the Protocol- defined conditions for treatment withdrawal (see 
Section  5.5).  
Duration of treatment (maximum number of cycles) will be determined based on safety during 
Part 1 and may be fewer than the absolute maximum number of cycles as outlined below: 
• For a 14- day cycle:  maximum of 26 cycles  
• For a 21- day cycle:  maximum of 17 cycles 
• For a 28- day cycle:  maximum of 13 cycles

CONFIDENTIAL  The Pharmacy Manual contains additional information and instructions for study drug 
preparation and infusion. 
5.2.2. Supply, Packaging, and Labeling  
Study drug  will be supplied as 5.0 mL aqueous solution in 10 mL glass vials with 10 mg/mL of 
INCAGN01876.  Study drug will be packaged as open-labelled supplies, each vial will be 
labelled and placed in a carton.  The Pharmacy Manual contains additional information regarding 
supply, packaging, and labeling of study drug. 
The investigator shall take responsibility for and shall take all steps to maintain appro priate 
records and ensure appropriate supply, storage, handling, distribution, and usage of study drug in 
accordance with the Protocol and any applicable laws and regulations.   
All Incyte investigational product labels will be in the local language and will comply with the 
legal requirements of each country and will state " Caution:  New Drug --Limited by Federal (or 
United States) law to investigational use. " 
5.2.3. Storage 
Study drug  must be stored refrigerated  (2-8°C) and protected from light, in a secure, 
limited -access location.  Receipt and dispensing of study drug must be recorded by an authorized 
person at the study site.  Study drug  may not be used for any purpose other than that stated in the 
Protocol.  The Pharmacy Manual contains additional information regarding storage of study 
drug.  
5.3. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with study drug dosing will be calculated by the sponsor based on the drug 
accountability and infusion records documented by the site staff and monitored by the 
sponsor/designee. 
5.4. Treatment In terruptions and Adjustments  
5.4.1. Dose Modifications 
Selections and modifications to the study drug are planned for dose-escalation cohorts.  D ose 
interruptions and modifications also may occur for individual study subjects.  The identification 
of DLTs will define the doses used in planned cohorts (see Section  5.4.2).  Further, the 
occurrence of DLTs and other toxicities (related or unrelated to study drug) will guide decisions 
for treatment interruptions and discontinuation for individual subjects.  Intrasubject dose 
escalation is not permitted; however, once the RP2D has been determined, ongoing subjects in Part 1 may be permitted to dose escalate to the RP2D with medical monitor  approval. 
5.4.2. Dose -Limiting Toxicity and Determination of a Maximum Tolerated Dose 
The evaluation period for DLTs will begin on Cycle 1 Day 1 and will continue up to and including study Day 28.  All DLTs will be assessed by the investigator using CTCAE  v4.03.  A 
DLT will be defined as the occurrence of any toxicity in Table 3, with the exception of events

CONFIDENTIAL  clearly associated with the underlying disease, disease progression, a concomitant medication, or 
comorbidity. 
Individual subject dose reductions may be made based on events observed at any time during 
treatment with study drug; however, for the purposes of dose cohort escalation/de- escalation, 
expanding a dose cohort, and determining the MTD/PAD of study drug, decisions will be made 
based on events that are observed from the first day of study drug administration through and 
including study Day 28.  A lower MTD may subsequently be determined based on relevant toxicities that become evident after study Day 28. 
Table 3: Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
Nonhematologic  toxicity  
• Any ≥ Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity EXCEPT the following:  
- Transient (≤ 72 hours) abnormal laboratory values without associated clinically significant signs or symptoms.  
- Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea adequately controlled with supportive care within 48  hours.  
- Changes in cholesterol and triglycerides.  
- An event clearly associated with the underlying disease, disease progression, a concomitant medication, or 
comorbidity.  
- Asymptomatic changes in lipid profiles.  
- Asymptomatic changes in amylase and lipase. 
- Single or nonfasting elevations in blood glucose (ie, blood glucose excursions will be considered toxicities if 
fasting blood glucose is elevated on 2 separate occasions).  
Hematologic  toxicity  
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding (ie, requires hospitalization, transfusion of blood 
products, or other urgent medical intervention).  
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia . 
• ≥ Grade 3 febrile neutropenia ( absolute neutrophil count  < 1.0 × 109/L and fever > 101°F/38.3°C).  
• Grade 4 neutropenia that does no t recover to ≤ Grade 2 in ≤ 3 days after interrupting study drug. 
• Grade 4 anemia not explained by underlying disease or some other concomitant disorder.  
Immune -related  toxicitya  
• ≥ Grade 2 ocular irAEs will be c onsidered a DLT.  
• Grade 3 irAEs that do not improve to baseline or at least Grade 1 in < 5 days with appropriate care or with 
corticosteroid therapy will be considered a DLT.   
• Grade 4 irAEs will be considered a DLT regardless of duration .   
General  
• Inability to receive the planned number of doses within the 28- day DLT period due to toxicity, re gardless of grade, 
will be considered a DLT.

CONFIDENTIAL  Table 3: Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity  (Continued)  
MTD  
• In Part 1 of the study, the M TD will be defined as 1 dose level below that at which ≥ one -third of subjects in a 
particular cohort have DLTs.  
• In Part 2 of the study, toxicities will continue to be monitored.  If the cumulative incidence of DLTs occurs in 
> 33% of subjects after 6 subj ects have been observed for at least 28 days, then further enrollment may be 
interrupted , and the investigators and sponsor will meet and reassess the MTD.  All AEs, regardless of the time of 
occurrence on study, may be considered in determining the approp riate dose, schedule, and MNTD.  
MNTD  
• Throughout the treatment period , if > 33% of subjects (minimum of 6 subjects ) experience a ≥ Grade 3 toxicity 
related to study drug after completing ≥ 4 cycles, then dose administration  will be stopped, and the  MNTD will be 
determined in conjunction with the investigators and sponsor based on all available safety data.  
 a Immune -related AEs are a diagnosis of exclusion, after alternative etiologies have been ruled out.  
5.4.3. Management of Dose- Limiting Toxicities or Other Urgent Situations  
In all cases , investigators may  employ any measures or concomitant medications, after  
discussion with the sponsor (whenever possible), necessary to optimally treat the subject.  
5.4.4. Follow- Up of Dose -Limiting Toxicities  
Any DLT should be followed until it resolves to baseline or appears to have stabilized for a 
minimum of 4 weeks  (eg, 28 days).  During follow -up, subjects should be seen as often as 
medically indicated to assure safety.  
5.4.5. Procedures for Cohort Review and Dose Escalation  
Telephone conferences will be scheduled by the sponsor with study investigators in order to review cohort -specific data and overall safety data, to agree on dose escalation, adjudicate 
individual high- grade AEs as potentially dose -limiting, and guide other major study decisions. 
5.4.6. Criteria and Procedures for Dose Interrupti ons and Adjustments  of Study Drug  
Treatment with study drug may be delayed to allow for resolution of toxicity.  Subjects may 
resume treatment if no medical condition or other circumstance exists that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for further participation in the study.  For 
toxicities that occur outside of the 28-day DLT period, the treating investigator should contact the medical monitor  to discuss the case of any subject whose treatment has been delayed for 
more t han 4 weeks (28 days) before restarting treatment with study drug. 
Instructions for dose modifications and interruptions are outlined in Table 4.  Individual 
decisions regarding dose interruptions and reduction s should be made using appropriate clinical 
judgment in consultation with the medical monitor, taking into account relatedness of the AE to 
the study drug and the subject's underlying condition.  Adverse events that have a clear 
alternative explanation , or tran sient (≤ 72 hours) abnormal laboratory values without associated 
clinically significant signs or symptoms may be exempt from dose -reduction rules.  Dose 
interruptions are permitted in the case of medical /surgical events or logistical reasons not related 
to study therapy (eg, elective surgery, unrelated medical events, subject vacation, and/or 
Incyte Europe Sàrl   Page 47 of 99 
Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  holidays).  Subjects should be placed back on study therapy within 4 weeks (2 8 days) of the 
scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the sponsor.  The reason for interruption 
should be documented in the subject' s study record.

(see Table 2 ).  Subjects should be permanently discontinued from study drug if they have AEs requiring more than 2 dose 
reductions of study drug.  
5.4.7. Definition, Procedures, and Supportive Care Guidelines for Immu ne-Related 
Adverse Events  
INCAGN01876 is an immune modulator, and although no toxicities were identified in 
preclinical models, it is possible that ir AEs (both nonserious and serious) similar to those 
described with approved immunotherapies may occur.  Adv erse events of a potential 
immunologic etiology or irAEs may be defined as an AE consistent with an immune phenomenon associated with drug exposure after all other etiologies have been eliminated .  
Immune- related AEs may be expected based on the nature of INCAGN01876 , its mechanism of 
action, and based on reported experience with other immunotherapies.  Special attention should 
be paid to AEs that may be suggestive of potential irAEs.  An irAE can occur shortly after the first dose or several months after t he last dose of treatment.   Suspected irAEs should be 
discussed with the medical monitor when possible. 
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by the 
treating investigator.  Suggested supportive care measures for t he management of drug -related 
AEs with potential immunologic etiology are outlined in Table 5.  Detailed supportive care 
guidelines for specific irAEs can be in found in Ap pendix B .  For each AE, attempts should be 
made to  rule out other causes, including but not limited to metastatic disease or bacterial or viral 
infection, which might require specific supportive care.

5.4.8. Management of Infusion Reactions 
Table 6 shows treatment guidelines for subjects who experience an infusion reaction associated 
with administration of study drug.  Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after 
drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion.

medically indicated until the subject is deemed medically stable in the opinion of 
the investigator.  None.  
Grade 2 : 
Requires infusion interruption 
but responds promptly to symptomatic treatment  
(eg, antihistamines, NSAI Ds, 
narcotics, IV fluids); 
prophylactic medications 
indicated for ≤  24 hours.  Stop infusion and monitor symptoms.  
Additional appropriate medical therapy 
may include but is not limited to the 
following:  
• IV fluids  
• Antihistamines  
• NSAIDs  
• Acetaminophen  
• Narcotic s 
Increase monitoring of vital signs as 
medically indicated until the subject is 
deemed medically stable in the opinion of 
the investigator.  
If symptoms resolve within 1 hour of 
stopping drug infusion, the infusion may be restarted at 50% of the original infusion rate.  Otherwise, dose administration will 
be interrupted  until symptoms resolve, and 
the subject should be premedicated for the 
next scheduled dose.  
Subjects who develop Grade 2 toxicity 
despite adequate premedication should be permanently discont inued from further 
study drug administration.  Subject may be premedicated 1.5 h

Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  5.4.9. Criteria for Pe rmanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
The occurrence of an unacceptable toxicity not caused by the underlying malignancy will be 
presumed to be related to study drug and will require that the study drug be permanently 
discontinued.  Unacceptable toxicity i s defined as  follows: 
• Grade 4 or life -threatening AEs (see Table 4 and Table 6).  
• ≥ Grade 2 ocular irAE. 
• Occurrence of an AE that is related to treatment with the study drug that, in the 
judgment of the investigator or the sponsor's medical monitor, compromises the 
subject 's ability to continue study -specific procedures , or is considered to not be in 
the subject 's best interest.  
• An AE requiring more than 2 dose reductions of study drug , or more than 1 dose 
reduction of study drug if the starting dose is 0.03 mg/kg (see Table 2 ). 
• Persistent AE requiring a delay of study drug beyond 4 weeks (28 days), unless the 
delay has been approved by the sponsor. 
5.4.10. Treatment After Initial Evidence of Radiologic Disease Progression  
Immunotherapeutic agents may produce antitumor effects by potentiating endogenous cancer -specific immune responses.  The response patterns seen with such an approach may 
extend beyond the typical time course of responses seen with cytotoxic agents and may  manifest 
as a clinical response after an initial increase in tumor burden or even the appearance of new lesions. 
If radiologic imaging shows disease progression , then subjects h ave the option to continue 
treatment while awaiting radiographic confirmation of progression as outlined in Section  7.7.1.1. 
5.5. Withdrawal of Subjects  From Study Drug 
5.5.1. Withdrawal Criteria  
A subject may choose to withdraw from the study at any time or be withdrawn from the study by 
the investigator or sponsor, if the subject is noncompliant with the study requirements.  Subjects 
may also be withdrawn at the discretion of the FDA or health authorities.   If a subject is 
withdrawn, then every reasonable effort should be made to determine the reason for withdrawal , 
and this information should be recorded in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). 
Subjects must  be withdrawn from study drug  for the following reasons: 
• The subj ect becomes pregnant.  
• Consent is withdrawn.  Subjects may choose to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty of jeopardizing their health care or loss of benefits to which the 
subject is otherwise entitled.  
• Further participation would be injurious to the subject' s health or well -being, in the 
investigator 's medical judgment.  
• The subject is lost to follow -up. 
Incyte Europe Sàrl   Page 51 of 99 
Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  • Unacceptable toxicity (see Section  5.4).  Subjects with unacceptable toxicities must 
be withdrawn from study drug but will continue to be followed during the safety 
follow-up visits as specified in Section  6.4. 
• The study is terminated by the sponsor. 
• The study is terminated by the local health authority, IR B, or IEC. 
A subject  may be discontinued from study drug  as follows:  
• Confirmed radiographic progression of disease per mRECIST v1.1.  See 
Section  7.7.1. 
Note :  For unconfirmed progression, see Section 7.7.1. 
Note :  A subject may be granted an exception to continue on treatment with 
confirmed radiographic progression if clinically stable or clinically improved.  See Section 7.7.1. 
• If, during the course of the study, a subject is found not to have met eligibility criteria (see Section  3), then the medical monitor, in collaboration with the investigator, will 
determine whether the subject  should be withdrawn from the study. 
• If a subject is noncompliant with study procedures or study drug administration in the investigator 's opinion, then  the sponsor should be consulted for instruction on 
handling the subject. 
5.5.2. Withdrawal Procedures  
In the e vent that the decision is made to permanently discontinue the study drug , the subject will 
be withdrawn from the study, and the end -of-treatment  (EOT) visit should be conducted.  
Reasonable efforts should be made to have the subject  return for follow-up visits.  These visits 
are described in Section  6.  The last date of the last dose of study drug and the reason for subject 
withdrawal will be recorded  in the eCRF . 
If a subject is withdrawn from the study:  
• The study monitor or sponsor must be notified. 
• The reason(s) for withdrawal must be documented in the subject' s medical record and 
in the eCRF . 
• The EOT  visit should be performed. 
• The date of the EOT visit should be recorded in the IW RS. 
• Subjects must be followed f or safety until the time of the follow -up visit or until 
study drug–related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible, 
whichever is longe st. 
If the subject discontinues study drug and actively withdraws consent for collection of follow -up 
data (safety follow -up or disease assessment), then no additional data collection should occur; 
however, subjects will have the option of withdrawing consent for study drug but continuing in 
the follow-up period of the study for safety/efficacy assessments . 
Incyte Europe Sàrl   Page 52 of 99 
Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  5.6. Concomitant Medications 
All concomitant medications and treatments must be recorded in the eCRF .  Any prior 
medication received up to 28 days before the first dose of study drug and 6 0 days after the last 
dose of study drug will be recorded in the eCRF .  Any addition, deletion, or change in the dose 
of these medications will also be recorded.  Concomitant medications administered after 60 days 
after the last dose of study drug should be recorded for SAEs as defined in Section  8.  
Concomitant treatments/procedures that are required to manage a subject 's medical condition 
during the study will also be recorded in the eCRF . 
5.6.1. Permitted Medications  
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a subject 's welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the community standards of 
medical care.  All concomitant medication s will be recorded on the eCRF , including all 
prescription, over-the-counter, herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids.  If changes 
occur during the study period, documentation of drug regimen, frequency, route, and date may 
also be included on the eCRF .  Note:   The use of bisphosphonates and denosumab are permitted 
in this study.  
5.6.2. Restricted  Medications  
Use of s ystemic glucocorticoids is restricted to  prophylaxis  for contrast allergi es for radiographic 
procedures, or to modulate symptoms or treat an AE of suspected immunologic etiology.  The 
use of physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy may be approved after consultation with 
the sponsor. 
Note:   Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.  A short course of steroids (prednisone or 
equivalent) ≤ 10 mg/day may be permitted with sponsor approval. 
• Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs; eg, ibuprofen) 
may be used.  Due to the risk of liver injury with the use of high doses of 
acetaminophen, subjects should be advised to stay within the recommended daily 
dose of acetaminophen. 
5.6.3. Prohibited Medications  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria (s ee Section 3.2) are 
not allowed during the ongoing study.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the study, discontinuation from study drug or vaccination may be required.  The investigator should discuss any questions regarding 
this with the sponsor.  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the 
investigator and/or the subject's primary physician.  However, the decision to continue the subject on study drug or vaccination schedule requires the mutual agreement of the investigator, 
the sponsor, and the subject. 
Incyte Europe Sàrl   Page 53 of 99 
Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapies during the screening and treatment 
periods of this study: 
• Any anticancer medications, including chemotherapy or biologic therapy other than the study drug . 
• Any immunological-based treatment for any reason from screening through follow-up 
visit.  
Note:   Completed adjuvant therapy (eg, vaccines) with medical monitor approval, 
inhaled or topical steroids, systemic steroids at doses ≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalents, and immune suppressants are allowed for treatment of immune toxicities 
as described in Section  5.4.7 and Appendix B . 
Note:   Allergy shots may be permitted after consultation with the medical monitor.  
• Investigational agents other than the study drug from screening through the follow-up 
visits. 
• Concomit ant radiation therapy.  
Note:   Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may be 
considered on an exceptional case -by-case basis after consultation with the medical 
monitor .  The subject must have clear measurable disease outside the radiated field.  
Administration of palliative radiation therapy will be considered clinical progression for the purposes of determining PFS. 
• Live vaccines within 30 days before the first dose of study drug and while 
participating in the study.  Examples o f live vaccines include, but are not limited to, 
the following:  measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette –Guérin , and typhoid (oral) vaccine.  Seasonal influenza vaccines for 
injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed.  However, intranasal 
influenza vaccines (eg, FluMist
®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.  
Subjects who, in the assessment by the investigator, require the use of any of the aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the study.  Subjects may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary.  The exclusion criteria 
describe other medications that are prohibited in this study.  There are no prohibited therapies 
during the post- treatment follow -up period. 
6. STUDY ASSESSMENTS

a Treatment cycles will begin every 14 day s (± 3 days).  Alternate dosing schedules may also be explored based on emerging safety, PK  data.  
b The mandatory safety follow -up visits should be conducted approximately 30 days and 60 days after the last dose of study drug or before the initiation of a new anticancer 
treatment, whichever comes first.  
c On Day 1 of the first 4 cycles (C1D1, C2D1, C3D1, and C4D1), subjects will be required to stay at the study site for safety observation for up to 4 hours postinfusion.  It is 
recommended that the subject does not leave the site for any reason during the safety observation period.  During the safety observation period, vital signs  (blood pressure, pulse, 
respiratory rate, and body temperature) will be assessed every 60 minutes ± 10 minutes (eg, 1 hour postinfusion, 2 hours postinfusion, 3 hours postinfusion, etc).  Subjects will 
also be assessed for the onset of acute AEs.

CONFIDENTIAL  d Laboratory assessments may also be required on additional visit days as described in Table  8 and Table  9. 
e All 12 -lead ECGs will be performed with the subject in a recumbent or semirecumbent position after 5 minutes of rest and should not be performed within 15 minutes after a 
blood collection.  
f In the event that a single QTc is > 470 milliseconds, the subject may enroll if the average QTc for the 3 ECGs is < 470 milli seconds or with approval from the medical monitor.  
g Triplicate ECG measurements are required at screening, C1D1 (in conjunction with PK samples), and C6D1 (in conjunction with P K samples).   Subsequent ECGs only 
need to be performed in triplicate if there has been a QT prolongation on study or if the ECG shows a clinically significant abnormality not present at baseline.  See Table  11 for 
information regarding timing of triplicate ECGs . 
h A 12 -lead ECG should be performed on Day 1 of every other cycle after Cycle 2 (eg, Cycle 4, Cycle 6, Cycle 8, Cycle 10).  
i The initial tumor imaging will be performed within 28 days before the first dose of study drug.  Scans performed as part of routine clinical management are acceptable for use as 
the screening scan if they are of diagnostic quality and performed within 28 days before the first dose of study drug.  The s ame imaging tech nique should be used for a subject 
throughout the study.  Local reading (investigator assessment with site radiology reading) will be used to determine eligibility and for subject management.  
j On-study imaging will be performed at Week 8 and then every 8 weeks (± 7 days) for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks (± 7 days) thereafter.  Imaging should follow 
calendar days and should NOT be adjusted for delays in cycle starts.  If imaging shows disease progression, then another imaging assessment should be performed at a minimum 
of 4 weeks, but no later than 6 weeks later to confirm progression per mRECIST.  
k If scan was obtained wit hin 4 weeks prior to the date of discontinuation, then a scan at treatment discontinuation (EOT) is not mandatory.  For subjects who discontinue study 
therapy without confirmed disease progression, a radiologic evaluation should be repeated at the time of treatment discontinuation (ie, date of discontinuation ± 4 week window).  For subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease progression, every effort should be made to continue monitoring their disease status every 8 weeks (± 7 days) by  radiographic imaging until 1) start of new antineoplastic therapy, 2) documented disease progression, 3) death, or 4) the end of the study, whichever occurs first.

6.1. Screening  
Screening is the interval between signing the ICF and the day the subject is enrolled  in the study 
(eg, Cycle  1 Day 1).  S creening may not exceed 28 days .  Informed consent must be obtained 
before performing any study -specific procedures that are not considered standard of care; 
however, p rocedures  conducted as part of the subject' s routine clinical management obtained 
before  signing of informed consent may be used for screening or baseline purposes with approval 
Incyte Europe Sàrl  Page 59 of 99 
Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  of the medical monitor , provided that  the procedure meets the Protocol- defined criteria and has 
been pe rformed in the timeframe of the study.   Assessm ents that are required to demonstrate 
eligibility  may be performed over the course of 1 or more days during the screening process . 
Results from the screening visit evaluations will be reviewed to confirm subje ct eligibility  before 
enrollment or administration of study drug .  Tests with results that fail eligibility requirements 
may be repeated once  during s creening if the investigator believes the results to be in error.  For 
screening assessments that are repeated, the most recent available result before  enrollment will 
be used to determine subject eligibility.  Additionally, a subject  who fails  screening may repeat 
the screening process 1 time  if the investigator believes  there has  been a change in eligibility  
status (eg , after  recovery from an infection).  Treatment should start as soon as possible after the 
date of enrollment. 
6.2. Treatment  
The treatment period begins on the day the subject receives the first dose of study drug (Cycle 1 
Day 1) through the point at which the investigator determines that the subject will be 
permanently discontinued from study drug.  Cycle 1 Day 1  must be no more than 28 days after 
the subject has signed the ICF. 
Subjects will have regularly scheduled study visits on Day 1 of every c ycle ± 3 days .  Additional 
visits will be required on Day 2 of Cycles 1 and 6, and Day 7 of Cycles 1 , 2, and 6.  During study 
visits , the subject will have clinical and laboratory assessments as outlined in Table 7 and 
Table 8.  At certain study visits as indicated in Section 7.8 and Section  7.9, subjects will have 
PK,  sampl es obtained (see Table 9) .  Toxicities will be monitored 
continuously and will be graded using the NCI CTCAE v4.03 criteria. 
On Day 1 of the first 4 cycles (Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1, and Cycle 4 
Day 1), subjects will be required to stay at the study site for safety observation for up to 
4 hours postinfusion.   It is recommended that the subject does not leave the site for any reason 
during the safety observation period.  During the safety observation period, subjects will be assessed for the onset of acute AEs. 
6.3. End of Treatment 
When  the subject permanently discontinues study drug , the EOT visit should be conducted.  If 
the EOT  visit coincides with a regular study visit, then the EOT  evaluations will supersede those 
of that scheduled visit, and the data should be entered in the EOT  visit in the eCRF .  The subject 
should be encouraged to return for the follow-up v isit(s). 
6.4. Follow -Up 
6.4.1. Safety Follow- Up 
The safety follow -up period is the interval between the EOT visit and the scheduled follow-up 
visit, which should occur 30 days (+ 7 days) and 60 days (+ 7 days) after the EOT visit (or after the last dose of study drug if the EOT visit was not performed).  Adverse events and SAEs must 
be reported up until a t least 60 days after the last dose of study drug, the date of the follow-up 
visit, or until toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible, whichever is 

Incyte Europe Sàrl  Page 60 of 99 
Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  longer.  If a subject is scheduled to begin a new anticancer therapy before the en d of the 30- day 
or the 60- day safety follow -up period, then the safety follow -up visit should be performed before 
new anticancer therapy is started.  
6.4.2. Disease Status  Follow- Up 
Subjects who discontinue study drug for a reason other than  disease progression wi ll move into 
the disease status follow -up period and should continue to be assessed every 8 weeks  (± 7 days ) 
for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks (± 7 days) thereafter,  by radiologic imaging to 
monitor disease status.  Every effort should be made to collect information regarding disease 
status until the earliest of the following : 
• The start of new anti cancer  therapy.  
• Disease progression . 
• Death . 
• The end of the study.  
6.5. End of Study  
The end of the study will occur when all subjects have completed the last study follow -up visit or 
have discontinued study drug and have completed applicable follow-up assessments.  
Additionally, s ubjects will be considered as having completed the study if they meet any of the 
following criteria:  
• Subject dies and a date of death is available.  
• Subject is known to have died; however, the date of death cannot be obtained.  (NOTE:  Every effort must be made to obtain the date of death.) 
• Consent is withdrawn for any further contact related to this study. 
− Every reasonable effort s hould be made to determine the reason a subject 
withdraws prematurely, and this information should be recorded in the eCRF . 
• The study is terminated by the sponsor. 
• The study is terminated by the local health authority or IRB or IEC. 
6.6. Unscheduled Visits 
Unsc heduled study visits may occur at any time if medically warranted.  Any assessments 
performed at those visits should be recorded in the eCRF . 
Incyte Europe Sàrl  Page 61 of 99 
Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  7. CONDUCT OF STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
Individual study procedures are described in detail below.  It may be necessary to perform these 
procedures at unscheduled timepoints if deemed clinically necessary by the investigator.  
Furthermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary for reasons related to 
subject safety.  In some cases, such evaluation/ testing may be potentially sensitive in nature 
(eg, HIV, HCV), and thus local regulations may require that additional informed consent be 
obtained from the subject.  In these cases, such evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations.  Subjects of childbearing potential must agree to take appropriate measures to avoid pregnancy in order to participate in the study ( Appendix A ). 
7.1. Administration of Informed Consent Form  
Valid informed consent must be obtained from the subject before  conducting any study- specific 
procedures using an ICF approved by the local IRB/IEC.  The ICF should contain all elements 
required by ICH E6 and describe  the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study in a 
manner  that the subject can understand.  Local and institutional guidelines for ICF content and 
administration must be followed; the original signed ICF must be retained by the investigator, 
and a copy of the signed ICF must be provided to the study subject.  The informed consent process for each subject must be documented in writing within the subject source documentation. 
7.2. Interactive Web Response System  Procedure  
The investigator or designee will assign a subject number when a subject enters the scr eening 
phase.  Upon determining that the subject is eligible for the study (see Section  3.1 and 
Section  3.2), the subject will be entered into the IWRS.  The I WRS  will be contacted to update 
the subject 's status and for study drug supply.  Refer to the I WRS  manual for detailed 
instructions. 
7.3. Demography and Medical History 
7.3.1. Demographics and General Medical History  
Demographic data and a complete medical and medication history will be collected at screening by the investigator or qualified designee and will  include date of birth, race, ethnicity, medical 
and surgical history, and current illnesses.  Medical history will include relevant medical or 
surgical treatment  within th e last 10 years  that are considered to be clinically significant  by 
the investigator . 
7.3.2. Disease Characteristics and Treatment History  
A disease- targeted medical and medication history  will be collected at screening.  Details 
regarding the subject' s malignanc y under study including date of diagnosis, initial and current 
cancer stage, primary tumor histology, and prior treatments including systemic, radiation, and 
surgica l procedures will be recorded. 
Incyte Europe Sàrl  Page 62 of 99 
Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  7.4. Prior  and Concomitant Medication s and Procedures  
Prior and concomitant medications and procedures will be reviewed to determine subject 
eligibility.  All concomitant medications and measures  must be recorded in the e CRF , and a ny 
medication received  or procedure performed within 28 days before the first dose  of stud y drug  
and up to the end of the follow -up phase of the study will be recorded in the eCRF .  The 
medication record will be maintained  after  signing the ICF to document concomitant 
medications , including any changes to the dose or regimen.  Concomitant medications include 
any prescription, over- the-counter, or natural/herbal preparations taken or administered during 
the study period.  Concomitant treatments  and/or procedures  that are required to manage a 
subject 's medical condition during the study will also be recorded in the eCRF .  See Section  5.6 
for details regarding restricted and prohibited medications. 
7.5. Poststudy Anticancer Therapy Status  
The investigator or qualified designee will review all new anticancer  therapy initiated after the 
last dose of study drug .  If a subject initiates a new anticancer therapy within 30  to 60 days after 
the last dose of study drug , the 30- day or 60- day safety follow -up visit should occur before the 
first dose of the new anticancer therapy.  
7.6. Safety Assessments  
7.6.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be monitored from the time the subject  signs the ICF .  Subjects will be 
instructed to report all AEs during the study and will be assessed for the occurrence of AEs 
throughout the study.  In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects will be asked general, nonleading questions such as "How are you feeling? "  All AEs (serious and nonserious) must be 
recorded on the source documents and eCRF s regardless of the assumption of a causal 
relationship with the study drug .  The definition, reporting, and recording requirements for AEs 
are described in  Section  8. 
7.6.2. Physical Examinations 
7.6.2.1. Comprehensive Physical  Examination 
Physical examinations must be performed by a medically qualified individual such as a licensed 
physician, physician 's assistant, or an advanced registered nurse practitioner, as local law 
permits.  
The comprehensive physical examination will include assessment(s) of the following organ or body systems:  skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; thyroid; lungs; cardiovascular system; abdomen (liver, spleen); extremities; and lymph nodes, as well as a brief neurological 
examination.  The screening physical examination should also include a measurement of height.  
Clinically notable abnormalities that are considered clinically significant in the judgment of the investigator are to be reported as AEs. 
Incyte Europe Sàrl  Page 63 of 99 
Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  7.6.2.2. Targeted Physical  Examination 
The targeted physical examination will be a symptom -directed evaluation conducted by the 
investigator or a medically qualified designee.  The targeted physical examination will include 
assessment(s) of the body systems or organs, as indicated by subject symptoms, AEs, or other 
findings.  Clinically notable abnormalities that a re considered clinically significant in the 
judgment of the investigator are to be reported as AEs. 
7.6.3. Vital Signs  and Weight 
Vital sign measurements include blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and body temperature.  
Blood pressure and pulse will be take n with the subject in the recumbent, semirecumbent, or 
sitting position after 5  minutes of rest.   On Day 1 of the first 4 cycles (C1D1, C2D1, C3D1, and 
C4D1), subjects will be required to stay at the study site for safety observation for up to 4 hours postinfusion.  It is recommended that the subject does not leave the site for any reason during the safety observation period.  During the safety observation period, vital signs (blood pressure, 
pulse, respiratory rate, and body temperature) will be assessed every 60 minutes ± 10 minutes 
(eg, 1 hour postinfusion, 2 hours postinfusion, 3 hours postinfusion, etc). 
Weight will also be assessed at each study visit.  Clinically notable abnormalities that are 
considered clinically significant in the judgment of the investigator are to be reported as AEs.  
7.6.4. Electrocardiograms  
All 12 -lead ECGs will be performed with the subject in a recumbent or semirecumbent position 
after 5 minutes of rest and should not be performed within 15 minutes of a blood collection.  All 
12-lead ECGs will be acquired using an ECG analysis system with analysis and printing 
capabilities, as well as digital transmission capabilities to a central capture module at the central 
ECG laboratory. 
Timed triplicate ECGs (separated by 5 minutes) will be cond ucted at screening and in 
conjunction with the pre- and postinfusion PK timepoints on C1D1 and C6D1 ( see Table 11).   
The specified postdose timepoint may be adjusted based on emerging PK data. A 12-lead ECG should be performed on Day 1 of every other cycle after Cycle 2  (eg, Cycle 4, 
Cycle 6, Cycle 8, Cycle 10, etc).  Subsequent ECGs only need to be performed in triplicate if 
there has been a QT prolongation on study or the ECG shows a clinically significant abnormal ity 
not present at baseline.  
The automated 12-lead ECGs readings will be interpreted by the investigator, or qualified 
designee at the site to be used for immediate subject management.  The decision to include or 
exclude a subject or withdraw a subject fro m the study based on a centrally analyzed  ECG 
flagged as "Abnormal, Clinically Significant" is the responsibility of the investigator, in 
consultation with the medical monitor, as appropriate.  Clinically significant abnormal findings before signing consent should be recorded as medical history.  Clinically significant abnormal 
findings after signing consent should be recorded as an AE.  In the event that a single QTc is > 470 milliseconds at screening, the subject may enroll if the average QTc for the 3 EC Gs is 
< 470 milliseconds or with approval from the medical monitor.  For subjects with an intraventricular conduction delay (QRS interval > 120 milliseconds ) at screening, the JTc 
Incyte Europe Sàrl  Page 64 of 99 
Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  interval may be used in place of the QTc with sponsor approval.  In addition, the JTc interval 
should be used for all subsequent assessments.

a Electrocardiograms should be conducted before but within 30 minutes of the PK blood draw at the corresponding timepoint.  
b Electrocardiograms should be performed 15 to 30 minutes after the corresponding PK sample is drawn.  
7.6.5. Laboratory Assessments 
A laboratory l ocal to the study site and subject will perform all clinical laboratory assessments 
for safety  (ie, blood chemistries, hematology assessments, coagulation tests, endocrine function, 
and urinalysis) .  The investigative site will enter the laboratory results  and laboratory normal 
ranges into the eCRF .  All local laboratory assessments should be performed using standard 
procedures on the days indicated in Table 8.  Table  10 lists  the specific laboratory analytes  
required for each test .  Additional testing may be required by the sponsor based on emerging 
safety data.  Additional tests may also be performed if clinically indicated.  
Screening laboratory assessments must be performed within 7 days of Cycle 1 Day 1.  If 
performed more than 7 days before Cycle 1 Day 1, then the tests must be repeated and eligibility 
confirmed before study drug administration on Cycle 1 Day 1.  Laboratory samples collected on 
study Day 1 must be performed before study drug administration .  After Cycle 1, predose 
laboratory procedures can be conducted up to 72 hours before study drug administration (within the 3 -day study window), and results should be reviewed by the investigator or qualified 
designee and found to be acceptable before a new cycle of treatment is initiated. 
7.6.5.1. Pregnancy Testing  
A local laboratory serum pregnancy test will be required for all women of childbearing potential 
during screening and at the EOT  visit.  The serum pregnancy test perform ed at screening must be 
performed within 72 hours before the first dose of study drug .  Urine pregnancy tests will be 
performed locally as outlined in Table 8, as medically indicated, or per country- specific 
require ment.  If a urine pregnancy test is positive, then the results should be confirmed with a 
serum pregnancy test. 
If the serum pregnancy test is negative after a urine test was positive , then t he investigator will 
assess the potential benefit/risk to the sub ject and determine whether  it is in the subject' s best 
interest to resume study drug and continue participation in the study. 
7.6.5.2. Hepatitis Screening Tests  
Hepatitis screening assessments will be performed at the screening visit ( Table  8) to rule out 
hepatitis infection; required analytes are shown in Table 10.  Generally , hepatitis tests should be 
Incyte Europe Sàrl  Page 65 of 99 
Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  performed early in the screening process due to the length of time needed to obtain  the results.   
Additional tests may be performed if clinically indicated.  
7.7. Efficacy Assessments  
7.7.1. Modified  RECIST v1.1 Assessment of Disease  
Modified RECIST will be applied by the site as the primary measure for assessment of tumor 
response and as a basis for Protocol guidelines related to disease status (eg, discontinuation of study therapy).  As noted in Section  1.3.4, RECIST v1.1 has been adapted to account for the 
unique tumor responses seen with immunotherapy ( Wolchok et al  2009). 
If radiologic imaging shows progressive disease, then tumor assessment s should be repeated at a 
minimum of 4 weeks , but no later than 6 weeks later to confirm progression, with the option of 
conti nuing treatment while awaiting radiologic confirmation of progression.  Table 12 provides 
instructions on how to proceed with treatment based on the subject' s clinical status once the 
initial scan showing radiologic  evidence of progression is observed. 
Subjects may receive treatment while waiting for confirmation of progression if they are 
clinically stable as defined by the following criteria: 
• Absence of clinically significant signs and symptoms (including worsening of 
laboratory values) indicating disease progression. 
• No decline in ECOG performance status. 
• Absence of rapid progression of disease. 
• Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg, cord compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention.

Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  7.7.1.1.2. Tumor Imaging During the Study  
The first imaging assessment should be performed 8 weeks after the first dose of study drug and 
then every 8  weeks (56 days ± 7 days)  for 12 months and then every 12 weeks thereafter until 
disease progression is determined.  Imaging assessments may be done m ore frequentl y if 
clinically indicated .  Imaging should  not be delayed for delays in cycle starts . 
Per mRECIST v1.1, response should be confirmed by a repeat radiographic assessment not less 
than 4 weeks from the date that the response was first documented.  The scan for confirmation of 
response may be performed at the earliest 4 weeks after the first indication of response or at the 
next scheduled scan, whichever is clinically indicated.  
Imaging should continue to be performed until documented disease progression, the start of new anticancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, death, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first.  Disease progression should be confirmed at least 4 weeks, but no later than 6 weeks after 
the first scan indicating progression in clinically  stable subjects.  Subjects  who have unconfirmed 
disease progression may continue on treatment until progression is confirmed, provided that they have met the conditions detailed in Section  7.7.1.  A central imag ing vendor will not be used in 
this study.  
7.7.1.1.3. Imaging During Follow- Up 
If the subject discontinues study drug  for reasons other than disease progression, imaging 
assessments should continue at the Protocol-specified interval until documented disease 
progression, the start of new anticancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, death, or the end of the 
study, whichever occurs first.   
7.8. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
7.8.1. Blood Sample Collection  
Pharmacokinetic  samples  will be obtained at the visits indicated in  Table 9.  Timing of 
PK  assessments are outlined in Table 13 .  After the predose PK sample is drawn, 
subjects will begin the study drug infusion.  Predose is defined as within 24 hours before administration of study drug.  Adjustments to the timing of blood sampling may be made based 
on emerging PK data.  The exact date and time of each  PK blood draw will be recorded in the 
eCRF.   Instructions for sample preparation and shipping will be provided in the Laboratory 
Manual.

7.10. Other Study Procedures  
7.10.1. Distribution of  Subject Reminder Cards  
Subjects will be provided with a reminder card at each visit.  The subject reminder card will 
remind the subject of the date/time of the next visit.  
8. SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING  
8.1. Adverse  Events 
8.1.1. Definitions  
For the purposes of this Protocol, an AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, that occurs 
after a subject  provides informed consent.  Abnormal laboratory values or test results occurring 
after informed consent constitute AEs  only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are 
considered clinically meaningful, require therapy (eg, hematologic  abnormality that requires 
transfusion), or require changes in the study drug(s) . 
8.1.2. Reporting  
Adverse events  that begin or worsen after informed consent should be recorded on the Adverse 
Events form  of the eCRF .  Conditions that were already present at the time of infor med consent 
should be recorded on the Medical History form in  the eCRF .  Monitoring for the occurrence of 
new AEs should be continued for at least 60 days after the last dose of study drug.  Adverse 
events ( including lab oratory abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described usin g a 
diagnosis whenever possible rather than  by individual underlying signs and symptoms.   
The term "disease progression " should be recorded as an AE/SAE only if there are no other 
identifiable AEs /SAEs  associated with the disease progression at the time of reporting.  For 
events associated with disease progression , the relevant signs and symptoms should be reported 
using a diagnosis whenever possible rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms.  When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate AE.  If the events resulting from disease progression meet the criteria for an SAE (eg, 
resulted in hospitalization, a life -threatening event, or death ), the specific event(s) should be 
reported as an SAE(s) as described in Section 8.3.2.  In both cases (ie, AEs or SAEs related to 
disease progression), it should be indicated that each event  (reported as a diagnosis or as signs 
and symptoms) is  related to disease progression  on the Adverse Events form of the eCRF . 
The severity of AEs will be assessed using CTCAE v 4.03 Grades 1 through 4.  T he CTCAE 
v4.03 severity of Grade 5 will not be used; AEs resulting in death  will be graded accordingly 
using Grades 1 through 4 and have the out come noted as fatal.

CONFIDENTIAL  If an event is not classified by CTCAE, the severity  of the AE will be graded according to the 
scale below to estimate the grade of severity:  
Grade  1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; inte rvention 
not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
activities of daily living.  
Grade 3  Severe or medical ly significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or 
prolong ation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living . 
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by nondirective questioning of the subject during t he 
screening process after signing the ICF and at each visit during the study.  A dverse events may 
also be detected when they are volunteered by the subject during the screening process or 
between visits, or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments.  To the 
extent  possible, each AE  should be evaluated to determine: 
• The severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 to  4). 
• Whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study 
treatment :  suspected (yes) or not suspe cted (no) . 
• The s tart and end dates, unless unresolved at final follow-up. 
• The action taken with re gard to study drug . 
• The event o utcome ( eg, not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, 
recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown). 
• The s erious ness, as per SAE definition provided in Section  8.3.1. 
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special reporting 
requirements  (see Section  8.3.2). 
All AEs should be treated appropriately.  If an AE is treated with a concomitant medication or 
nondrug therapy, this action should be recorded on A dverse Event form and the treatment should 
be specified on  the Prior/ Concomit ant Medications  or Proce dures and Non- Drug  Therapy  form 
in the eCRF . 
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until it ha s resolved  or until it is judged to be 
permanent;  assessment should be made at  each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any  
changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to 
treat the event , and the outcome. 
When the severity  of an AE changes over time for a reporting period (eg, between visits ), each 
change in severity  will be re ported as a separate AE until the event resolves.  For example, 
2 separate AEs will be reported if a subject has Grade 1 diarrhea, meeting the definition of an 
AE, that  lasts for  3 days before  worsening to a Grade 3 severity.  The Grade 1 event will be 
reported as an AE with a start date equal to the day the event met the Grade 1 AE  definition and 
a stop date equal to the day that the event increased in severity  from Grade  1 to Grade 3.  The 
Grade 3 event will also be reported as an AE, with the start date equal to the day the event 
changed in intensity from Grade 1 to Grade 3 and a stop date equal to  the day that the event 
either changed severity  again or resolved.

Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  8.2. Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an AE in their own right (considered clinically 
meaningful, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy, or require changes 
in study drug ) should be recorded on the Adverse Event form in  the eCRF .  Whenever possible, a 
diagnosis rather than a symptom should be provided (eg, " anemia" instead of "low hemoglobin" ).  
Laboratory abnormalities that meet the criteria for AEs should be followed until they have 
returned to normal or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.  When an abnormal 
laboratory te st result corresponds to a sign or symptom of a previously reported AE, it is not 
necessary to separately record the laboratory  test result as an additional event.  
Laboratory abnormalities  that do not meet the definition of an AE  should not be reported as AEs .  
A Grade 3 or 4 (severe) AE does not automatically indicate an SAE unless it meets the definition 
of serious, as defined in Section 8.3.1.  A dose modification  for the lab oratory  abnormality may 
be required (se e Section  5.4) and should not contribute to the designation of a laboratory test  
abnormality as an SAE . 
8.3. Serious Adverse Events  
8.3.1. Definitions  
An SAE is defined as an event that meets at least 1 of the following criteria: 
• Is fatal or life -threatening . 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless 
hospitalization is a result of: 
− A routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not associated with 
any deterioration in condition.   
− An elective surgery or preplanned treatment for a pre- existing condition that is 
unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the ICF. 
− A treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE and not resulting in hospital admission. 
− Any social reasons and respite care, in the absence of any deterioration in the subject 's general condition. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability , incapacity , or a substantial d isruption of 
a person 's ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• Constitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect . 
• Is considered to be an important medical event  or a medically significant event that 
may not result in death, be immediately life -threatenin g, or require hospitalization but 
may be considered serious  when, based on appropriate medical judgment, the event 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
1 of the outcomes listed above. 
Incyte Europe Sàrl  Page 75 of 99 
Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  8.3.2. Reporting  
Every SAE, re gardless of suspected causality (eg, relationship to study drug(s) or study 
procedure or disease progression), occurring after the subject has signed the ICF through the last 
study visit (or 60 days after the last dose of study drug,  whichever is later) mu st be reported to 
the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours  of learning of its occurrence, unless otherwise 
specified by the Protocol.  Any SAEs occurring more than 60 days after the last dose of study drug should be reported to the sponsor or its designee only if the investigator suspects a causal 
relationship to the study drug.   
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Adverse Event form  of the eCRF .  
The i nvestigator must assess and record the causal relationship of each SAE to the st udy 
treatment .   
The investigator must also complete the Incyte Serious Adverse Event Report Form, in English, 
and send the completed and signed form to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours of becoming 
aware of the SAE.  The investigator must provide a causality assessment, that is, assess whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that the SAE is related to the study treatment:  suspected 
(yes) or not suspected (no).  Refer to the Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Serious Adverse Event R eport Form.  
The contact information of the sponsor' s study- specific representatives  is listed in the 
investigator manual  provided to each site.  The original copy of the SAE Report Form and the 
confirmation sheet must be kept at the study site.  
Investigational site personnel must report any new information regarding the SAE within 
24 hours of becoming aware of the information in the same manner that  the initial SAE Report 
Form was sent.  Follow-up information is recorded on an amended or new SAE Report Form, with an indication that it is follow -up to the previously reported SAE and the date of the original 
report.  The  follow-up report should include information that was not provided on the previous 
SAE Report Form, such as the outcome of the event (eg , reso lved or ongoing), treatment 
provided, action taken with study drug because of the SAE (eg , dose reduced, interrupted, or 
discontinued), or subject disposition (eg, continued or withdrew from study participation ).  Each 
recurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as follow-up to that event, regardless of when it occurs. 
If the SAE is not documented in the IB for the study drug  (new occurrence) and is thought to be 
related to the sponsor' s study drug, the sponsor or its designee may urgently requir e further 
information from the investigator for reporting to health authorities .  The sponsor or its designee 
may need to issue an  Investigator Notification (IN)  to inform all investigators involved in any 
study with the same dru g that this SAE has been reported.  Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and 
relevant ethics committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC , or as per national 
regulatory requirements in participating countries.

Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  8.5. Pregnanc y 
Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that study drug may 
have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication or method.  When a 
pregnancy has been confirmed in a subject during maternal or paternal exposure to study drug, 
within 60 days of the last dose of study drug or within 30 days after cessation of treatment if the subject initiates n ew anticancer therapy, the following procedures should be followed in order to 
ensure subject safety:  
• The s tudy drug must be discontinued immediately  (female subjects only ). 
• The i nvestigator must complete and submit the Incyte Clinical Trial Pregnancy form 
to the sponsor or its designee within 24 hours  of learning of the pregnancy. 
• A serum pregnancy test must be performed to confirm the urine pregnancy test result.   
If a negative serum test does not confirm the urine pregnancy test result, then: 
− The investigator will use his or her expert judgment, based on an assessment of 
the potential benefit/risk to the subject, to determine whether it is in the subject' s 
best interest to resume study drug and continue participation in the study. 
• The EOT visit evaluatio ns must be performed. 
Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safety evaluation.  Follow-up should be conducted for each pregnancy to determine outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any 
birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications, by following 
until the first well- baby visit.  Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial  Preg nancy f orm 
and reported by the investigator to the sponsor or its designee.  Pregnancy follow-up information 
should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible causal relationship to the sponsor' s study drug to  any pregnancy outcome , as well as  follow-up to the 
first well-baby visit or the duration specified in local regulations , whichever is later .  Refer to the 
Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Clinical Trial  Pregnancy Form.  
Any SAE occurring  during pregnancy must be re corded  on the SAE  report form and 
submitted to the sponsor or designee.  
8.6. Warnings and Precautions  
Special warnings or precautions for the study drug, derived from safety information collected by the sponsor or its designee , are presented in the Investigator 's Brochure.   Additional safety 
information collected between IB updates will be communicated in the form of Investigator 
Notifications  (INs) .  Any important new safety information should be discussed with the subject 
during the study, as necessary .  If new significant ris ks are identified, they will be added to the 
ICF. 
8.7. Data Monitoring Committee  
There will be no formal Data Monitoring Committee for this open -label study.  For Part 1, the 
sponsor will conduct telephone conferences with investigators in order to review cohort- specific 
data, to review overall safety data from prior cohorts (if applicable), and to agree on dose

Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  10. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE 
PROCEDURES  
10.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
This study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that originate in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and conducted in adherence to the study Protocol; GCPs  as defined in 
Title  21 of the US Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR ) Parts 11, 50, 54, 56, and 312; ICH E6 
GCP consolidated guidelines; and local regulatory requirements as applicable to the study 
location s. 
The investigator will be responsibl e for:  
• Permitting  study- related monitoring , sponsor audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory 
inspections by providing direct access to source data and other relevant clinical study 
documents. 
− Monitoring:  Qualified representatives of the sponsor or its  designee, study 
monitors, will monitor the study according to a predetermined plan.   The 
investigator must allow the study monitors to review any study materials and 
subject records  at each monitoring visit. 
− Auditing:  Qualified representatives of the sponsor or its designee may audit the 
clinical study site and study data to evaluate compliance with the Protocol, 
applicable local clinical study regulations, and overall study conduct.  The investigator must allow the auditors to review original source records and study 
documentation for all subjects. 
− Regulatory inspection:  Regulatory authorities may conduct an inspection of the 
study and the site at any time during the development of an investigational 
product .  The investigator and staff are expected to cooperate with the inspectors 
and allow access to all source documents supporting the eCRF s and other 
study-related documents.  The investigator must immediately notify the sponsor when contacted by any regulatory authority for the purposes of conducting an 
inspection. 
• Obtaining informed consent and ensuring that the study subjects' questions have been 
answered and the subjects fully understand study procedures:  
− Informed consent must be obtained before  any study- related procedures are 
conducted, unless otherwise s pecified by the Protocol. 
− Informed consent must be obtained using the IRB/IEC -approved version in a 
language that is native and understandable to the subject.  A template will be 
provided by the sponsor or its designee.  The sponsor or its designee must re view 
and acknowledge the site -specific changes to the ICF template .  The ICF must 
include a statement that the sponsor or its designee and regulatory authorities have direct access to subject records.  
Incyte Europe Sàrl  Page 84 of 99 
Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  • Obtaining approval from the IRB/IEC before the start  of the study and for any 
changes to the clinical study Protocol, important Protocol deviations, routine updates, 
and safety information in accordance with institutional requirements and local law. 
− The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the safety reports provided by the 
sponsor are reviewed and processed in accordance with regulatory requirements 
and with the policies and procedures established by the IRB /IEC . 
• Adhering to the Protocol as described in this document and agree ing that changes to 
the Protocol procedures , with the exception of medical emergencies, must be 
discussed and approved, first, by the sponsor or its designee and, second , by the 
IRB/IEC.  Each investigator is responsible for enrolling subjects who have met the 
specified eligibilit y criteria . 
• Retain ing records in accordance with all local, national, and regulatory laws, but for a 
minimum period of at least 2  years after the last marketing application approval in an 
ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in 
an ICH region, or if not approved, 2 years after the termination of the test article for 
investigation to ensure the availability of study documentation should it become 
necessary for the sponsor or a regulatory authority to review. 
− The investigator must not destroy any records associated with the study without 
receiving approval from the sponsor.  The investigator must notify the sponsor or 
its designee in the event of accidental loss or destruction of any study records.  If the investigato r leaves the institution where the study was conducted, the sponsor 
or its designee must be contacted to arrange alternative record storage options. 
− All eCRF  data entered by the site (including audit trail), as well as computer 
hardware and software (for accessing the data), will be maintained or made 
available at the site in compliance with applicable record retention regulations.  The sponsor will retain the original eCRF  data and audit trail.  
10.2. Accountability, Handling, and Disposal of Study Drug 
The inves tigator is responsible for drug accountability at the study site; however, some of the 
drug accountability duties may be assigned to an appropriate pharmacist or other designee.  
Inventory and accountability records must be maintained and readily available for inspection by the study monitor and are open to inspection at any time by any applicable regulatory authorities. 
The investigator or designee must maintain records that document: 
• Delivery of study drug to the study site.  
• Inventory of study drug at the site.  
• Subject use of the study drug including pill or unit counts from each supply 
dispensed. 
• Return of study drug to the investigator or designee by subjects. 
The investigational product must be used only in accordance with the Protocol.  The investigator 
will also maintain records adequately documenting that the subjects were provided the specified 
Incyte Europe Sàrl  Page 85 of 99 
Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  study drug.  These records should include dates, quantities, and any available batch or serial 
numbers or unique code numbers assigned to the investigational product and study subjects. 
Completed accountability records will be archived by the site.  The investigator or designee will 
be expected to collect and retain all used, unused, and partially used containers of study drug until verified by  the study monito r (unless otherwise agreed to by the sponsor).  At the 
conclusion of the study, the investigator or designee will oversee shipment of any remaining study drug back to the sponsor or its designee for destruction according to institutional standard operating  procedures.  If local procedures mandate on-site destruction of investigational supply, 
the site should (where local procedures allow) maintain the investigational supply until the study 
monitor inspects the accountability records in order to evaluate com pliance and accuracy of 
accountability by the investigative site.   At sites where the study drug is destroyed before 
monitor inspection, the monitors rely on documentation of destruction per the site SOP. 
10.3. Data Management  
Data management will be performed in a validated database via an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system.  All data entry, verification, and validation will be performed in accordance with 
the current standard operating procedures of the Data Management Department  at the sponsor or 
its designe e.  The database will be authorized for lock once all defined procedures are completed. 
The investigator will be provided with access to an EDC system so that an eCRF  can be 
completed for each subject.  Entries made in the eCRF  must be verifiable against s ource 
documents; if updates to the database are not possible, any discrepancies should be explained 
and documented.  The investigator will be responsible for reviewing all data and eCRF  entries , 
and will sign and date the designated forms in each subject's eCRF , verifying that the 
information is true and correct.  The investigator is responsible for the review and approval of all query responses. 
Protocol deviations will be identified and recorded in the Protocol Deviation form  of the eCRF .  
The study monitor will reference the Monitoring Plan in order to ensure that each issue identified 
is appropriately documented, reported, and resolved in a timely manner in accordance with the 
plan's requirements.  
10.4. Data Privacy and Confidentiality of Study Records  
The investigator and the sponsor or its designee must adhere to applicable data privacy laws and 
regulations.  The investigator and the sponsor or their designees are responsible for ensuring that sensitive information is handled in accordance with local requirements (eg, HIPAA).  
Appropriate consent and authorizations for use and disclosure and/or transfer (if applicable) of 
protected information must be obtained. 
Subject names will not be supplied to the sponsor or its designee, if applicable.  Only the subject 
number and subject' s initials (subject 's initials will only be recorded if allowable by local 
regulations) will be recorded in the eCRF , where permitted; if the subject 's name appears on any 
other document (eg, laboratory report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to be supplied to the sponsor or its designee.  Study findings stored on a computer will be stored in 
accordance with local data protection laws.  The subjects will be informed that representatives of the sponsor or its designee, IRB or IEC, or regulatory authorities may inspect their medical 
Incyte Europe Sàrl  Page 86 of 99 
Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  records to verify the information collected, and that all personal information made available for 
inspection will be handled in strictest confidence and in accordance with local data prot ectio n 
laws.  
10.5. Financial Disclosure  
Before  study initiation, all clinical investigators participating in clinical studies subject to FDA 
Regulation Title 21 CFR Part 54 – Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators (ie, "covered 
studies" ) are required to submi t a completed Clinical Investigator Financial Disclosure form that 
sufficiently details any financial interests and arrangements that apply.  For the purpose of this 
regulation, " clinical investigator " is defined as any investigator or subinvestigator who is directly 
involved in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects, including the spouse and each dependent child of the clinical investigator or subinvestigator.  These requirements apply to both US and foreign clinical investigators conducting cove red clinical studies.  
Any new clinical investigators added to the covered clinical study during its conduct must also 
submit a completed Investigator Financial Disclosure Form.  During a covered clinical study, any changes to the financial information previously reported by a clinical investigator must be 
reported to the sponsor or its designee.  At the conclusion of the covered clinical study, the 
clinical investigators will be reminded of their obligation s.  In the event that the clinical 
investigator  is not reminded, they nevertheless  will remain obligated  to report to the sponsor or 
its designee any changes to the financial information previously reported, as well as any changes 
in their financial information for a period of 1 year after completion of the covered clinical study. 
10.6. Publication Policy  
By signing the study Protocol, the i nvestigator and his or her institution agree that the results of 
the study may be used by the sponsor, Incyte Europe  Sàrl (Incyte), for the purposes of national 
and international registration, publication, and information for medical and pharmaceutical professionals.  Study results will be published in accordance with applicable local and national regulations.  If necessary, the authorities will be notified of the investigator's name, address, 
qualifications, and extent of involvement.  The terms regarding the publication of study results 
are contained in the agreement signed with the sponsor or its designee.  A signed agreement will be retained by the sponsor or its designee.

CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX A. INFORMATION REGARDING EFFECTIVENESS OF 
CONTRACEPTIVE METHOD S 
For Subjects Participating in the Study:  
The following methods that can achieve a fai lure rate of less than 1% per year when used 
consistently and correctly are considered as highly effective birth control methods.  
Such methods include: 
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation1 
− oral 
− intravaginal 
− transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation1 
− oral 
− injectable  
− implantable2 
• Intrauterine device (IUD)2 
• Intrauterine hormone- releasing system ( IUS)2 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion2 
• Vasectomised  partner2,3 
• Sexual abstinence4 
 
1  Hormonal  contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the IMP, which may reduce the efficacy of the 
contraception method.  
2  Contraception  methods that in the context of this guidance are  considered to have low  user dependency. 
3  Vasectomised  partner is a highly effective method provided of avoiding pregnancy  that partner is the sole sexual 
partner of the WOCBP trial participant and that the vasectomised  partner has received medical assessment of the 
surgical s uccess.  
4  In the context of this guidance, sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments.  The 
reliability of se xual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.

CONFIDENTIAL  irAE  Supportive Care  
Endocrinopathies Note:  Subjects should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of 
hypophysitis, adrenal insufficiency (including adrenal crisis), and hyper- or 
hypothyroidism.  Subjects may present with fatigue, headache,  mental status 
changes, abdominal pain, unusual bowel habits, and hypotension, or report 
nonspecific symptoms which may resemble other causes such as brain metastasis 
or underlying disease.  Unless an alternate etiology has been identified, signs or symptoms of endocrinopathies should be considered immune-mediated. 
For Grade 2 (mild to moderate new symptoms):  
• In hypophysitis, treat with systemic corticosteroids, per institutional standard 
of care .  When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper sh ould be 
started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  Replacement of appropriate 
hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
Note: These suggested supportive care measures also apply to Grade 3 
hypophysitis   
• In hyperthyroidism, nonselectiv e beta- blockers (eg, propranolol) are suggested 
as initial therapy.  
• In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with levothyroxine or liothyronine, is indicated per standard of care. 
Note:  Isolated hypothyroidism may be treated with replacement therapy 
without treatment interruption and without corticosteroids. 
• Evaluate endocrine function and, as clinically indicated, consider pituitary 
scan.  
• For subjects with abnormal endocrine work-up, except for those with isolated hypothyroidism, consider short-term, high- dose corticosteroids (eg, 
methylprednisolone or IV equivalent) and initiate appropriate hormone 
replacement therapy.  
• For subjects with normal endocrine work- up (labs or MRI), repeat labs/MRI as 
clinically indicated.  
For Grade 3 or 4 (severe or new symptoms, new/worsening hypoxia, life 
threatening):  
• Hypothyroidism may be treated with replacement therapy without treatment 
interruption and without corticosteroids. 
• In hyperthyroidism, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by oral corticosteroids.  Consider initiation of systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 
1-2 mg/kg per day of prednisone or equivalent, and initiate appropriate hormone replacement therapy.  Once improving, gradually taper 
immunosuppressive steroids over ≥ 4 week s. 
• In hypophysitis, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by oral 
corticosteroids.  When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper 
should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
• For adrenal crisis, severe dehydration, hypotension, or shock:  immediately 
initiate intravenous corticosteroids with mineralocorticoid activity.  
• Consult endocrinologist. 
• Consult medical monitor.

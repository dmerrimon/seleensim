Abstract:  
 
Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is an incurable, devastating, inherited skin disease caused 
by mutations in the COL7A1 gene that encodes for type VII collagen (C7), the major component of anchoring 
fibrils (AFs) , structures that mediate  epidermal -dermal adherence. Thirty percent of RDEB patients have 
nonsense mutations. We recently demonstrated  in 5 such patients that intradermal and topical gentamicin 
induced “read -through” of their nonsense mutations and created  robust and sustained new C7 and AFs at the 
dermal -epidermal junction (DEJ) of their skin and also improved wound closure and the quality of their skin. No 
untowar d side effects occurred. Herein, we propose evaluating  the safety and efficacy of intravenous gentamicin  
in these patients . We also propose optimizing the concentration and manner of delivery of topical gentamicin. 
The unambiguous milestones will be increa sed C7 and AFs  in the patients’ DEJ , improved EB Disease Activity 
Score s, and absence of significant gentamicin side effects.  
Gentamicin Therapy for Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Patients With Nonsense Mutations  
Gentamicin for RDEB  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]              March 02, 2017  3 A. Background,  Significance  and Preliminary Data : 
Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is an inherited, incurable,  mechano -bullous disease 
characterized by blisters, erosions  and scarring of the skin and mucosa.1 RDEB  is caused by mutations in the 
COL7A1  gene that encodes type VII collagen (C7), a major component of anchoring fibrils (AFs), structures  that 
hold the two  main layers of skin together - the epidermis and the dermis .2,3 Based largely on "pre -clinical" animal 
models, we and others envisioned several therapeutic strategies for RDEB. These include intradermal injections 
of allogeneic  and RDEB gene -corrected dermal fibroblasts4,5, topical and intradermal administration of C7 itself6-
8, intradermal injection of viral vectors expressing full-length C7  and intravenous C7 or fibroblasts that home to 
RDEB skin wounds9-11, and transplantatio n of gene -corrected keratinocyte autografts.12,13 Recently, proof -of-
principle cli nical trials have been conducted , including bone marrow/stem cell transplantation, intradermal 
injection of allogeneic fibroblasts and transplantation of gene -corrected kerat inocyte autograft  sheets onto RDEB 
skin wounds.14,15 These strategies are logistically arduous and not consistently effective or safe. The mainstays 
of RDEB treatment currently are only palliative and support ive measures.  
 Over 8 00 distinct mutations (missense, frame -shift, insertion, deletion, and nonsense changes) have 
been identified in RDEB patients.16,17  Our recent search of an RDEB patient registry data base shows that the 
prevalence of nonsense mutations in RDEB approaches 30% (161 out of 506 patients),16,17 and these patients 
often have a more severe form of the  disease.37 Aminoglycosid e antibiotics can read -through nonsense 
mutations and generate full -length, functional proteins in cystic fibrosis (CF), Duchennes' muscular dystrophy 
(DMD) and other genetic diseases with nonsense mutations18,19  Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that 
has been use d for infectiou s diseases for decades. It also is the most effective aminoglycoside for reading 
through nonsense mutations in CF and 
DMD and can be delivered topically or 
intravenously.20-25 Using cultured skin 
cells from 4 RDEB patients with 
nonsense mutations, we recently 
published that aminoglycosides were 
able to induce PTC read-through in the 
COL7A1  gene  and produce full -length 
C7.26 Importantly, aminoglycoside -
induced C7 reversed the abn ormal 
RDEB cell phenotype and incorporated into the DEJ of skin equivalents. In addition, we showed that 
aminoglycosides were capable of promoting PTC read -through and inducing full -length C7 in human 293 cells 
transfected with C7 expression constructs har boring 22 different known RDEB nonsense mutations.26 With these 
exciting data in hand, we were fortunate to secure funding from Epidermolysis Bullous Research Partnership 
(EBRP) and translated these in vitro  findings into patients . For this clinical trial,  we recruited five patients with 
nonsense mutations from our 22 RDEB patient cohort27and treated them with topical and intradermal gentamicin 
(please see details of [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] on ClinicalTrials.gov). Table I  summarizes the par ticipants. The study was 
double -blinded and placebo -controlled at its onset . For the topical arm, gentamicin 0.1% ointment or the 
ointment vehicle were applied three times  a day to two open erosion T est Sites of at least 2 x 2 cm in size for 
two weeks. For the intradermal arm, in the same patients, a sterile gentamicin solution (40 mgs/ml) or sterile 
saline placebo were injected intradermall y into two skin Test S ites, remote from the topical Test S ites, on days 1 
and 2 . On each day 200 μl (8 mgs) were injected into each site for a total dose of 16 mgs. Follow -up visits were 
at weeks 4 and 12. The patients completed a weekly telephone questionnaire . They also kept a daily diary and 
photographed their skin test sites once a week. A number of safety parameters were also assessed includ ing a 
complete blood count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, electrolytes, liver function tests, pure -tone audiometry, 
and serum ELISAs and indirect immunofluorescence for the possible development of anti -C7 autoantibodies. 
Briefly, the results of the safe ty parameters showed no untoward, gentamicin -induced altered audiometry or 
laboratory abnormalities.  In addition, we did not detect any gentamicin -induced anti -C7 antibodies in the 
patients.   
All 4 patients trend ed toward s clinical improvement in the  gentamicin Test Sites with  less new blister 
formation, rapid closure of existing erosions and improved skin durability compared to the placebo Test Site s. 
Figure 1A  shows wound sites that received topi cal gentamicin or placebo from P atient #3. Topical  gentamicin 
rapidly closed the Test S ite wound and kept it closed for 12 weeks. Patients reported improved wound closure 
and skin quality. Figure 1B and 1C  shows the patient's e xpression of C7 and AFs at her  DEJ before and after 
topical or intradermal gentamicin. At Day 0, there was minimal or no C7 at the patient's DEJ. At the 4 -week visit, 
there was minimal C7 at skin sites that received the topical and intradermal placebos. In contrast, there was 
abundant C7 expression at the DEJ of the patient's ski n after topical or intradermal gentamicin at week 4.

Gentamicin Therapy for Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Patients With Nonsense Mutations  
Gentamicin for RDEB  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]              March 02, 2017  4 Surprisingly, gentamicin -induced C7 was stably retained at the DEJ at 12 weeks after initial application.  
Immuno -EM with a 
monoclonal antibody to C7 
revealed  marked labeling 
of new AFs (arrows) in the 
patient's skin 4 weeks  after 
topical gentamicin. At 12  
weeks, there were  
plentiful, well -labeled  AFs 
in both the topical and  
intradermal gentami cin 
sites. In contrast, there 
were  neither labeling nor 
visible AFs in the placebo 
treated site s. Table II  
summa rizes the 
immunofluorescence (IF) 
results of the study. The 
numbers are the 
percentage of C7 
expression compared with 
normal skin. All 5 patients 
responded to topical and 
intradermal gentamicin 
with maximal C7 levels 
restored for each patient 
ranging from 19 % to 166% 
of that of normal human 
skin. The study of  our 5th patient is not yet completed.  In a preliminary pilot study with one  patient, w e noted 
that the topical application of gentamicin to unwoun ded skin resulted in new C7 in P atient #4 to 65 % of that of 
normal skin ( E2 in Figure 2). This raises the possibility that 
perhaps topical gentamicin can also penetrate intact skin.  
 
B: Innovation:  Our clinical trial above showed that topical and 
intradermal gentamicin induced new C7 and new AFs. This has 
never been shown before. We now wish to determine if systemic 
intravenous gentamicin  can improve multiple skin wounds 
simultaneously (including the esophagus) in the patients and 
perhaps prevent new blister formation. With this systemic 
administration and improvement in multiple wound sites, 
there may be improved patient clinical scores a nd 
improved patient quality of life. This type of systemic 
treatment was completed in CF and DMD patients,22-25 but 
never before i n RDEB patients. Secondly , in this  proposal, 
we wish to determine if we can optimize topical gentamicin 
delivery into the pati ent’s papillary dermis using a five -fold 
increase in the concentration of the drug or delivering the 
gentamicin with a micro -needle device.  
 
C: Approach:  
Aim 1. Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Short Term 
Intravenous Gentamicin for RDEB Patients.  
Overview & Rationale: The rationale for short -term 
systemic intravenous gentamicin in these patients is 
outlined in the sections above, namely the drug could treat 
multiple skin sites simultaneously including the esophagus .  
This approach has proven safe a nd efficacious in other genetic diseases such as CF and DMD22-25 Our

well-labeled, wheat -stack shaped AFs are readily observed (arrows). Scale bars:  250 nm.

Gentamicin Therapy for Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Patients With Nonsense Mutations  
Gentamicin for RDEB  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]              March 02, 2017  5 HYPOTHESIS  is that intravenous gentamicin will, like topical and intradermal gentamicin,  create new C7 and 
AFs at the patient's DEJ, improve multiple skin sites simultaneously, improve th e patient’s clinical disease and 
improve his or her quality of life. In  accordance with the enclosed letters from two experienced pediatricians, we 
believe this therapy will be safe. B ecause C7 and AFs are incredibly stable, we further hypothesize that new ly 
induced C7 and AFs will persist for many months in the patient's skin. Using dosing regimens of gentamicin that 
have proven to be safe, we will: 1) determine the percentage increase of C7 expression in the patients' skin 
before and after treatment, 2) determine how durable and sustainable the new C7 and AFs are in the patients' 
skin after treatment, 3) determine if this treatment is safe in this patient population, 4) determine if this treatment 
improves  the patients clinically and improves their quali ty of life and 5) generate data for a multi -centered Phase 
III study using a larger number of patients .  
 Patients /Intervention : We have already lined up 3 well -characterized, adult RDEB patients with 
nonsense mutations who wish to participate in this study. These patients had positive responses to topical and 
intradermal gentamicin in our clinical trial  (Table II ). The patients wil l receive intravenous gentamicin (7.5 mgs 
per kilogram), in 100 ml of 5% dextrose in saline, for 14 consecutive days, a dose proven to not cause 
ototoxicity or neprhotoxicity28 and to be efficacious in inducing PTC read -through in DMD patients.22 The first few 
infusions will be done in the Infusion Center of the Keck Hospital of USC. We will measure gentamicin trough 
levels (24 hours after infusion) and gentamicin peak levels (30 minutes after the infusion) during the second day 
and, if needed, adjust the gentamicin doses such that the peak level is between 20 and 40 μg/ml and the trough 
level <2 μg/ml . If no untoward side effects occur, the patients will then have their infusions in their home via a 
commercial infusion service.  
 Safety Evaluation : Patients  will be consented, enrolled and evaluated on Day 0 and then evaluated on 
post-treatment days 30, 90, and 180. On Day 0, the patients will have a complete medical history , review of 
systems  (ROS) , physical examination, vital signs, and weight. They will al so have baseline u rine analysis, 
complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, glucose, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and calculated 
creatinine clearance. Pure tone audiometry and a calculated creatinine clearance will be done on Days 0, 7, 14 
and 30 post-treatment. Stop criteria will be a decline of >15 dB on pure tone audiometry at 2 consecutive 
frequencies and a creatinine clearance  <60ml/min.28 Whenever there is new protein created in a patient, there is 
the possibili ty that the patient’s immune sy stem will raise autoantibodies against it. This did not occur in our 
clinical trial with topical and intradermal gentamicin, but it behooves us to evaluate this again with intravenous 
gentamicin and potentially more auto -antigenic protein created. Using in direct immunofluorescence and our anti -
C7 ELISA, we will test the subject’s serum for anti -C7 antibodies at each visit.   
 Efficacy:  A. Clinical Evaluations: At baseline Day 0 and at each follow -up visit, (days 30, 90 and 180) 
the patients will complete a Q uality of Life Assessment tool, a Pruritus Score tool, and  a validated epidermolysis 
bullosa disease activity index (EBDASI)29,30. Patients will keep a daily diary using a self -ROS questionnaire. 
Patients will be telephoned weekly by a USC study member inquiring about any new signs, symptoms or ROS 
changes since the advent of the study. At baseline Day 0, we will identify four Test Sites at least 25 cm2 in size  
to follow sequentially. Two will be from areas that at baseline have blisters or erosions and the other two from 
intact skin areas. The two Test Sites with active blisters and erosions will be traced using a transparency sheet 
and the areas of the lesions calculated on a digitizing tablet. Likewise, all of the Test Sites will have 
standardized phot ographs and the lesional areas calculated by computer -assisted morphometry, as previously 
published .29-31 Within the context of their daily diary, patients will note the number of new blisters and erosions 
that occur in the Test Sites. A USC study member w ill telephone the patient each week and inquire about the 
Test Sites and ask the patient to estimate the percentage area of the Test Site consumed by erosions and 
blisters.  Also, at each follow -up visit, three dermatologists  will observe the four Test Sites and count the number 
of bullae and erosions in each. The intact Test Site areas will be scored at each follow -up visit using the 
following 3 -point scale: 0 = no lesions ; +1 = any active lesions; +2 = active lesions consuming over 50% of the 
Test Site  area. Tracings to evaluate the areas of blisters or open erosions will be done, and standardized 
photographs paired with computer -assisted morphometry to calculate the areas of any lesions will be performed. 
B. Evaluations of C7 and AF Expression:  At each  post-treatment time point, 8 mm punch biopsies from the 
four Test Sites will be divided into three parts for (i) H&E histology and quantitation of epidermal -dermal 
adherence, (ii) the expression of C7 at the DEJ relative to that of normal human skin using  anti-C7 antibodies to 
the NC1 and NC2 domains of C7 and NIH J Image software. One major "milestone" of the stud y will be the 
expression of NC2 since this would clearly indicate restoration of full -length C7 and ( III) evaluation of newly 
created AFs by imm uno-EM and AF enumeration by computer -assisted morphometry.  Performing these 
evaluations out to 6 months will determine how durable the newly created C7 and AFs are. In our recent clinical 
trial outline d above, it was surprising that gentamicin -induced C7 remained at a similar level at 3 months post -
treatment as that of 1 month for Patient  #3 (Please see Figure 1  and Table II ).

Aim 2: Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Higher Dose  Topical Gentamicin for RDEB Patients.  
Overview and Rationale : In our gentamicin clinical trial outlined earlier, there was significant variation in the 
production of new C7 and AFs, as shown  in Table II.  Patients #2 and #5  only restored C7 to 20% of normal skin 
in response to gentamicin. We only used one concentratio n of gentamicin, 0.1%  ointment , and our in vitro  
studies with RDEB fibroblasts from these same two patients showed that the C 7 response to gentamicin was 
dose -dependent .26 In these patients, there could have been sub -optimal dosing or sub -optimal access of the 
gentam icin to the patient’s dermal fibroblasts and basal keratinocytes . In this aim, we will use 0.5% gentamicin 
ointment rather than 0.1% and determine if the C7 resp onse is more robust in these two patients . Based on our 
encouraging data shown in Figure 2 , we will also treat intact skin and determine if higher dose gentamicin can 
prophylactically prevent frank skin blisters and erosions from forming.  
 Patients /Intervention : We will study two RDEB children tested in 
our previous trial for this study. In addition, we also have 2 other children 
and 2 other adult patients who have contacted us and wish to participate 
in this study ( Table III). Two of these patients share the same mutations 
(R578X and R2814) as our current patients.  We will select a total of four 
Test S ites (two with open wounds of at least 3 cm by 3 cm and two areas 
of intact  skin nearby the Test Sites with blisters or erosions ) and apply 
0.5% gentamicin ointment two  times a day under an occlusive  dressing of 
the patients' choice for two weeks. This dose was used in combination 
with 15% paromomycin to ulcerative cutaneous leis hmaniasis lesions 
once daily for 20 days in two publications  without renal or ototoxicity  detected .32,33  
 Safety and Efficacy : We will essentially assess in these patients the safety and efficacy parameters 
outlined in Aim #1  at months 1 , 3 and 6 after topical application . Potential renal toxicity and ototoxicity will be 
monitored by creatinine clearance and pure tone audiometry at day 0 and at each follow up visit.  
 
Aim 3: Evaluate the Safety and  Efficacy of Intradermal  Administration of Gentamicin w ith a MR2 Micro -
needle Roller Device . 
Overview and Rationale:  In our current clinical trial outlined above, there were excellent C7 responses to 
intradermal injections of gentamicin solution in several patients ( Table II ). Nevertheless, these injections we re 
very localized with diffusion of the drug probably less than an inch from the single injection site. Recent evidence 
has shown that a MR2 microneedle roller d evice can readily deliver  lidocaine  into the lower epidermis and upper 
papillary dermis over a wide area of skin with good efficacy, safety and excellent patient tolerance .34 This may 
be an opportunity to deliver intradermal gentamicin solution (40 mg/ml) to wide areas of skin in a simple m anner 
that can be done in an outpatient office with minimal logistical issues and avoidance of systemic exposure to the 
drug. Advantages include the possibility of delivering in a "pulse " fashion significant levels of gentamicin to the 
papillary dermis ov er wide areas of skin with minimal discomfort and minimal systemic exposure of gentamicin . 
Avoiding systemic exposure would be valuable for RDEB patients who have ototoxicity or renal compromise, 
poor venous access or cannot tolerate intravenous infusions.  
 Patients & Interventions:  We will enroll two new RDEB patients (either adults or children) shown in 
Table III  in this “proof -of-principle”  study. Skin Test S ites will be areas measuring at least 40 cm2, and we will 
test one site of intact unwounded skin and one site of skin with lesions (blisters or erosions). The areas will be 
cleansed with 4% Hibiclens and then the MR2 Microneedle Roller Device passed over the area in two directions 
at 90 degrees. Thi s device induces tiny micro -wounds in the skin to the depth of the papillary dermis. 
Gentamicin sterile solution (4 0 mg/ml) will then be liberally applied over the area and the area immediately 
occluded with a polyrurethane membrane (Opsite). Another equal sized Test Site of intact skin will be tested 
without prior intervention with the Microneedle Roller. The same gentamicin solution will be applied to the site 
and immediately occluded with Opsite. This will determine if the gentamicin solutio n can penetrate intact skin.  
 Safety and Efficacy:  We will measure gentamicin in the serum of the se patient 3 0 minutes after the 
microneedle delivery to determine i f there is any systemic exposure when gentamicin is administered in this 
manner. Efficacy of the gentamicin administration will be assessed identically to those in Aim#1 by IF and 
immuno -EM analysis in conjunction with the patients keeping a daily  diary of the treatment sites, weekly 
photographs of Test S ites, weekly staff interviews of the pat ients, and physician assessments at patient visits  at 
months 1, 3 and 6 after administration of gentamicin . Potential renal toxicity and ototoxicity will be monitored by 
creatinine clearance and pure tone audiometry at day 0 and each follow up visit.

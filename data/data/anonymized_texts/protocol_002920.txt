Product Name/ 
Number  AXS -05 (bupropion hydrochloride and dextromethorphan hydrobromide monohydrate)  
Protocol Number  AXS -05-MDD -201 
Protocol Title  A Randomized, Double -Blind, Active -Controlled Trial of AXS -05 Administered Orally to 
Subjects with Major Depressive Disorder  
Indication  Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)  
Development Phase  2 
Objective  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of AXS -05 and bupropion in subjects with MDD  
Study Design  
 This study is a randomized, double -blind, active -controlled, Phase 2 trial, consisting of a screening 
period of up to 4 weeks, and a 6-week treatment p eriod.  
Screening Period  
Prior to randomization, all subjects will enter an up to four -week screening peri od (Screening) to 
determine eligibility. Eligible subjects must meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5) criteria for MDD without psychotic features, based on the 
Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth 
Edition, Clinical Trials Version (SCID -5-CT), with a current major depressive episode of at least 
4 weeks in duration.  Eligible subjects must meet all other inclusion and no exclusion  criteria.  
Treatment Peri od 
Randomization  
Subjects  who successfully  complete  Screening  will be randomly assigned at the baseline visit 
(Baseline)  to receive either AXS -05 or  bupropion  sustained  release  (SR)  in a 1:1 ratio  for 6 weeks. 
The randomization schedule will be computer -generated using a permuted  block algorithm that 
will randomly allocate the study drug to randomization numbers.  
Treatments  
Doses will be titrated as follows:  
 Days 1 - 3 
o AXS -05 group: 105 mg bupropion, 45 mg dextromethorphan QD  
o Bupropion group: 105 mg bupropion QD  
 Days 4 - 42  
o AXS -05 group: 105 mg bupropion, 45 mg dextromethorphan BID  
o Bupropion group: 105 mg bupropion BID  
All QD doses will be taken in the morning, orally on an empty stomach  (at least 2 hours pre- or 2 
hours post-prandial)  with water . All BID doses will be taken  at least 8 hours apart, orally  on an 
empty stomach (at least 2 hours pre- or 2 hours post-prandial) with water. All study drug  is of 
identical appearance and similar weight in order to maintain the integrity of the blind.  
Assessments and Visits  
Study visits w ill occur at Screening ( Visit 1 ), Baseline (Day 0, Visit 2), and on Days 3, 7, 14, 21, 
28, 42 and 49  (Visits 3  – 9). Study procedures and assessments will be performed during stud y 
visits as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments. Visit 3 (Day 3) will be conducted telephonically. 
Subjects will be reminded during Visit 3 to begin BID dosing on Day 4 . All subjects completing 6 
weeks of treatment or subjects prematurely discontinuing  from the study will be required to 
complete a follow -up visit one week after the last dose of study drug , Visit 9, telephonically.

Version: FINAL (v 2.0) 28Jun2018  Page 17 4. INTRODUCTION  
4.1 Background  
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder  characterized by 
depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities consistently for at least a  
two-week period, and which impairs social, occupational, educational, or other important 
functioning. MDD is highly prevalent and difficult to treat. In 2016, 6.7 percent of adults aged 18 
or older (16.2 million adults) had at least one Major Depressive Episod e (MDE ) in the past year, 
and 4.3 percent of adults (10.3 million adults) had an MDE with severe impairm ent in the past 
year. Adults in 2016 who had an MDE with severe impairment represented nearly two -thirds (64.0 
percent) of adults who had a past year MD E. [1]. Results of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives 
to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial indicate that nearly two -thirds of treated patients with MDD 
do not experience adequate treatment response with first -line therapy, an d that the majority of 
these initial failures al so fail second -line treatment  [2], suggesting that there are significant 
limitations to current treatments. There is therefore an urgent need for new, mechanistically novel 
treatments for MDD . 
4.2 Rationale for the Evaluation  of AXS -05 for Major Depressive Disorder  
AXS -05 is being evaluated in the current study in subjects with MDD. AXS -05 is a fixed -dose 
combination of bupropion and dextromethorphan (DM). The bupropion in the  combination is used 
both for its neuropharmacological properties as well as for its ability to inhibit  the metabolism of 
DM through CYP2D6. The rationale for the study of AXS -05 in depressive disorders is based on 
the neuropharmacology of  DM and bupropion  which are relevant to depression, clinical 
observations with these individual agents in depressed subjects,  and the positive pharmacokinetic 
interaction of DM and bupropion . 
Bupropion and DM each target different receptor systems that are associated with ant idepressant 
activity. Bupropion is an inhibitor of the neuronal uptake o f norepinephrine and dopamine [3]. DM 
is a noncompetitive N -methyl -D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, sigma -1 receptor agonist 
and inhibitor of the se rotonin transporter (SERT) and nor epinephrine transporter (NET) [4]. 
Combining the distinct and independent mechanisms of action of these two compounds may be 
additive or synergistic.  
The clinical utility of  DM has however been limited by its rap id metabolism through CYP2D6 in 
the majority of humans yielding low plasma levels even at high and repeated doses [5]. AXS -05 
addresses this limitation by combining DM and bupropion.  As bupro pion and its metabolites are 
inhibitors of CYP2D6, co -administration of bupropion and DM leads to substantially increased 
DM plasma concentrations. In three  Phase 1 pharmacokinetic trials of AXS -05, administration of  
bupropion in combination with DM result ed in a significant increase in DM exposure (C max and 
AUC) at all doses tested (Axsome data on file).  Administration of bupropion in co mbination with 
DM resulted in C max and AUC 0-12 of DM on Day 8 that were 20 to 27 times and 30 to 36 times,  
respectively, the values observed on Day 1 of dosing. DM exposure increased in a dose -dependent  
manner with increasing doses of both DM and bupropion. Administration of DM did not appear  
to affect the pharmacokinetics of bupropion. There was no significant difference in  the rates or  
types of adverse events in the combination groups as compared to a group receiving bupropion  
alone.  The positive pharmacokinetic interaction between bupropion and DM therefore enables 
DM’s clinical utility in treating depression by increasing  DM’s plasma levels into a potentially 
therapeutic range.

5. OBJECTIVES  
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of AXS -05 and bupropion in subjects with MDD.  
6. STU DY DESIGN  
6.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This study is a randomized, double -blind, active -controlled, Phase 2 trial, consisting of a screening 
period and a 6 -week treatment period. The trial is being conducted in subjects experiencing a 
current depressive e pisode. Informed consent will be obtained before any subsequent screening 
related procedures are performed. Assessments will include safety parameters, MADRS, QIDS -
SR-16, CGI -S and CGI -I. Subjects will be provided a Visual Analog Mood Scale (VAMS) and 
asked to complete it daily.  
The study will be divided into 3 segments: an up to four -week screening period (Screening); a 6 -
week treatment period; and a 1 -week follow -up period. A sufficient number of subjects will be 
screened and randomized to achieve the goa l of having approximately 60 compliant subjects  who 
complete the double -blind treatment period . 
The study design is depicted in  Figure 6.1.

AXS -05-MDD -201 
Version: FINAL (v 2.0) 28Jun2018  Page 19 Screening Period  
Prior to any screening related procedures, informed consent will be obtained. After providing 
informed consent , all subjects will enter an up -to four week  screening p eriod  to determine 
eligibility. Eligible subjects must meet the Diagnostic and Statistical  Manual of Mental  Disorders, 
Fifth Edition (DSM -5) criteria for MDD without psychotic features, based on the Structured 
Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, 
Clinical Trials Version (SCID -5-CT), with a  current major depressive episode of at least 4 weeks 
in duration.  Eligible subjects must meet all other inclusion and no exclusion criteria.  
Treatment Period  
Subjects who successfully complete Screening will be randomly assigned at Visit 2  (Baseline) to 
receive either AXS -05 or bupropion sustained release (SR)  in a 1:1 ratio  for 6 weeks.  The 
treatments will be up -titrated in the following manner:  
Days 1 - 3 
 AXS -05 group: 105 mg bupropion, 45 mg dextromethorphan QD  
 Bupropion group: 105 mg bupropion QD  
Days  4 - 42 
 AXS -05 group: 105 mg bupropion, 45 mg dextromethorphan BID  
 Bupropion group: 105 mg bupropion BID  
All QD doses will be taken in the morning, orally on an empty stomach  (at least 2 hours pre- or 2 
hours post -prandial) with water . All BID doses will b e taken at least 8 hours apart, orally  on an 
empty stomach (at least 2 hours pre- or 2 hours post-prandial) with water .  
All study drug  including AXS -05 tablets and  bupropion SR tablets are of identical appearance and 
similar weight in order to maintain the integrity of the blind.  
Assessments and Visits  
Study visits will occur at Visit 1, Baseline (Day 0, Visit 2), and on Days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 , 42 and 
49 (Visits 3  – 9). Study procedures and assessments will be performed during study visits as 
outlined in the Schedule of Assessments (See Section 17.2). Visit 3 (Day 3) will be conducted 
telephonically. Subjects will be reminded during Visit 3 to begin BID dosing on Day 4 . All subjects 
completing 6 weeks of treatment or subjects prematurely discontinuing from  the study will be 
required to complete a follow -up visit one week after the last dose of study drug  (Visit 9 ), 
telephonically.  
Assessments will include safety parameters, MADRS, QIDS -SR-16, CGI -S and CGI -I.  
 
 
 
  
 
Study drug compliance will also be assessed at the 80% level by 
counting the number of tablets dispe nsed and returned. Non-compliant subjects are subject to early 
termination from the study  and should return for an Early Termination visit .

AXS -05-MDD -201 
Version: FINAL (v 2.0) 28Jun2018  Page 20 Safety will be assessed by evaluating treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs); clinical laboratory test 
results; vital sign measurements; and physical examination findings.  
All AEs observed by the study personnel or reported by the subject during the study (from the time 
of the signing of the informed consent form [ICF] through follow up ) will be documented.  
6.2 Discussion of Study  Design  
The safety assessments used in this study are recognized and validated standards of measurement.  
Bupropion SR is used as an active control in this trial as it is one of the two components in AXS -
05. The 3 -day up -titration period for AXS -05 and bup ropion SR used in this trial is meant to 
minimize AEs resulting in early drop -outs. This up -titration from  QD to BID  dosing is consistent 
with the label for Wellbutrin SR which recommends at least 3  days before up -titrating to BID  
dosing. No down -titration has been included consistent with the product label for Wellbutrin SR.  
6.3 Study Sites  
The study will take place at up to  5 study sites in the United States .  
6.4 Point of Contact  
A point of contact will be identified to provide informa tion to subjects about where to obtain 
information on the study, the rights of the subject, and whom to contact in case of study -related 
injury. This information will be provided in the information provided to the subject and in the ICF. 
7. SUBJECT POPULATION  
7.1 Selection of Study Population and Diagnosis  
Eligible subjects for this study must have a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) . A 
sufficient number of subjects will be screened to achieve the goal of having approxima tely 60

35.Unable or unlikely to comply with the study protocol or unsuitable f or any other reason,
including other conditions that might indicate that the subject is unsuitable for the study as
judged by the investigator such as known history of poor medication compliance or significant
instability in status of psychosocial issues.
7.3 Premature Subject Withdrawal  
All subjects will be advised that they are free to withdraw from participation in this study at any 
time, for any reason, and without prejudice. The Investigator should make e very reasonable 
attempt to keep subjects in the study; however, subjects must be withdrawn from the study  
immediately  if they withdraw consent to participate.  
Investigators must attempt to contact subjects who fail to attend scheduled visits by telephone or 
other means to exclude the possibility of an AE being the cause of withdrawal. Should this be the 
cause, the AE must be documented, reported, and followed as described in Section  10.2. 
Axsome  reserves the righ t to request the withdrawal of a subject because of  protocol violations or 
other reasons.  
The Investigator also has the right to withdraw subjects from the study  or discontinue study drug 
treatment  at any time for any reason. Examples of reasons for discon tinuation may include:  
intolerable or unacceptable AEs, intercurrent illness, noncompliance with study procedures, 
administrative reasons, or in the Investigator’s opinion, to protect the subject’s best interest.    
If a subject is withdrawn or discontinues  treatment before completing  the study, the reason and the 
date of discontinuation will be recorded on the appropriate case report form (CRF). Whenever 
possible and reasonable, the evaluations that were to be conducted at the completion of the study 
should  be performed at the time a subject  withdraws from the study .   
Subject s who discontinue treatment should be encouraged to continue completing study visits and 
procedures so long as the subject  does not withdraw consent.   
7.4 Subject Replacement Criteria  
Subjects who are w ithdrawn for noncompliance or other reasons may be replaced to achieve the 
goal of approximately 60 compliant subjects who complete the double -blind treatment period .

The following study drug s will be provided:  
Treatment A : AXS -05 (105 mg bupropion, 45 mg dextromethorphan) tablet, oral  
Treatment B:  Bupropion SR (105 mg) matching tablet, oral  
AXS -05 is a fixed -dose combination tablet of 105 mg bupropion hydrochloride SR and 45 mg 
dextromethorphan hydrobromide monohydrate IR, in the form of a bilayer, film -coated tablet.  
Bupropion SR tablets contain 10 5 mg bupropion hydrochloride SR, in the form  of a film -coated 
tablet that matches  the visual appearance  and weight  of the AXS -05 tablets.  
AXS -05 and  bupropion SR  supplied for this study are manufactured by  
. 
8.2 Labeling and Packaging  
8.2.1 Labeling  
Clinical labeling of the study  drug will be performed by . The 
bottles  of study drug will have a label that meets the applicable regulatory requirements and may 
include the following: subject identifier, dosage strength, lot number, package number, protocol 
number, specified number of tablets , caution statement, storage, manufacture or expiration date, 
and S ponsor /manufacturer  identification  and dosing instructions . 
8.2.2 Packaging  
AXS -05 and  bupropion SR tablets will be supplied  and bottled by  
and labeled at . The study drug  will be packaged  in 50 c c bottles 
and labeled to blind the Investigator, the study clinic personnel, and subjects.  
8.3 Study Drug  Administration  
All subjects  will receive either AXS -05 or bupropion SR  according to the kit number assigned by  
a randomization scheme. Eligible subjects will be assigned a unique kit that contains 4 bottles of 
study drug.  Bottles from the assigned kits should be dispensed to the subject per the pharmacy 
manual and/or subject dosing instructions provided. The kit must remain on -site at all times and 
only the appropriate number of bottles should be dispensed to the subject at each study visit.   
Designated staff at each site  will dispense study drug  bottles . Subjects  will be instructed to take 
the study drug  per the Treatment Period part of Section 6.1 . Subjects should be instructed to return 
bottle (s) and any unused study drug at each study visit in order to record compliance.  All study 
drug will be  supplied and administered in a double -blind manner throughout the entire duration of 
the study.  
8.4 Dispensing and Storage  
The study drug  is to be used exclusively in th is clinical study according to the instructions of this 
protocol. The Investigator is responsible for dispensing the study drug  according to the dosage 
scheme and for ensuring its proper storage.  The Investigator  or designee  must confirm the receipt 
of study drug  with a signature. A copy of this receipt must be kept by the Investigator and another 
copy will be stored at  Axsome  and/or its designee .  

Axsome Therapeutics , Inc.  Confidential  and Proprietary   
AXS -05-MDD -201 
Version: FINAL (v 2.0) 28Jun2018  Page 26 All study drug must be stored in an appropriate secure area (e.g., a locked cabinet in a locked 
room) at controlled room temperature (with a permitted range of 15°C -30°C or 59°F -86°F) and 
must be protected from heat and moisture. Any excursions below or above this temperature range 
should be communicated to Axsome Therapeutics, Inc., or its designee as soon as possible. The 
key to the storage area is to be kept by the Investigator or  designee responsible for the study drug. 
The storage area will be accessible only to t hose persons authorized by the I nvestigator.  
The key to the storage area is to be kept by the Investigator or designee responsible for the study 
drug. The stor age area  will be accessible only to those persons authorized by the Investigator.  
8.5 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects who meet study entry criteria will be randomly assigned  in a 1:1 ratio to AXS -05 or  
bupropion SR, respectively. The randomization schedule will be computer generated using a 
permuted block algorithm that will randomly allocate study drug to randomization numbers.  The 
randomization numbers will be assigned sequentially . Study center will not be a blocking factor in 
the randomization schedule.  
The randomization schedule will be prepared before the start of the study. No one involved in the 
study performance will have access to the randomization schedule before official unblinding of 
treatment assignment. No subject will be  randomized into this study more than once.  
8.6 Blinding and Unblinding Treatment Assignment  
All subjects, Investigators, and study personnel involved in the conduct of the study, including 
data management, will be blinded to treatment assignment with the exce ption of a specified 
independent unblinded statistician , and clinical supply manager  who will have access to the 
randomization code. The unblinded study personnel will not otherwise participate in study 
procedures or data analysis before  unblinding of the study data to all study related personnel.  
Sponsor personnel involved in the management and monitoring of the study will be blinded to the 
treatment assignment.  
Study personnel will strive  to safeguard the integrity of the study blind to minimize bias in t he 
conduct of the study. Treatment unblinding is discouraged if knowledge of the treatment 
assignment will not materially change the planned management of a medical emergency. 
Unblinding will be permitted in a medical emergency that requires immediate know ledge of the 
subject’s treatment assignment . Unblinding should be discussed in advance with the medical 
monitor if possible. For emergency unblinding, the site will access the randomization code . If the 
Investigator is not able to discuss treatment unblind ing in advance, then he  or she must notify the 
medical monitor as soon as possible about the unblinding incident without revealing the subject’s 
treatment assignment. To unblind the treatment group, the Investigator will open the envelope in 
which the rand omization code was received. The Investigator or designee must record the date and 
reason for study  drug discontinuation on the appropriate CRF for that subject. In all no nemergenc y 
cases, the Investigator must discuss the event with the medical monitor before  unblinding the 
subject’s treatment assignment.  
If treatment assignment is unblinded for an individual subject, study personnel will be notified of 
that subject’s treatment assignment without unblinding th ose of the remaining subjects in the 
study. T hus, the overall study blind will not be compromised. If a subject’s treatment assignment 
is unblinded, he  or she may or may not be asked to withdraw from the study. The Investigator will 
make this decision after consultation with the medical monitor.

AXS -05-MDD -201 
Version: FINAL (v 2.0) 28Jun2018  Page 27 8.7 Selection of Doses in the Study  
The dose of AXS -05 (105 mg bupropion, 45 mg DM), titrated to  twice daily, was selected based 
on the results of three  completed Axsome -sponsored, pharmacokinetic Phase 1 trials of the 
combination of bupropion and DM. The selected  dose combination resulted in an increase in DM 
plasma concentrations into a  potentially therapeutic range.  
The dose of bupropion SR is 105 mg, titrate d to twice -daily administration.  This dose was selected 
because it is equal to the dose of bupropion in A XS-05. 
8.8 Selection of Timing of Dose  
A significant food effect has not been reported for the individu al components of AXS -05. AXS -
05 and  bupropion SR  tablets  are dosed  on an empty stomach (at least 2 hours pre- or 2 hours post-
prandial) in this trial to match the dosing in the completed Phase 1 trials of AXS -05. 
8.9 Dose Adjustment Criteria  
Dose adjustment is not recommended  in this study.   If a subject misses a dose, or if a dose is 
skipped due to AEs, if possible the subject should continue in the study and take study drug  at the 
designated times.    
8.10 Drug Accountability  
The Investigator must maintain adequate records showing  the receipt, dosing , or other disposition 
of the study drug  provided,  including the date, quantity, batch or code number, and identification 
of subjects (subject numbe r and initials ) who received it. An inventory of study drug should be 
performed by autho rized personnel upon receipt to confirm contents match the packing slip and 
that the all product packaging is received and in good condition.  If product received does not 
correspond to the packing slip or is damaged, the Axsome study team should be contac ted 
immediately and the inventory quarantined  until further instructions are provided . 
The Investigator will not supply the study drug  to an y person except those named as S ub-
Investigators on the Form FDA  1572, designated study personnel, and subjects in t his study. The 
Investigator will not dispense the study drug from any study sites other than those listed on the 
Form FDA  1572. The study drug may not be relabeled or reassigned for use by other subjects. If 
any of the study drug is not dispensed; is lost,  stolen, spilled, unusable; or is received in a damaged 
container, this information must be documented and reported to Axsome  and appropriate 
regulatory agencies, as required.  
Upon completion of the study, the study drug (partly us ed, unused, and empty packaging ) must be 
left in the original packaging and returned to Axsome  or its designee for destruction.  
8.11 Treatment Compliance  
Study drug compliance will be closely monitored by counting the number of tablets dispensed and 
returned .  
Subjects  will be instructed to bring any unused study drug  and empty  containers  to the clinic on 
Days 7 , 14, 21, 28 and 42 (Visits 4 – 8), or at the time of early study discontinuation.  Before new 
study drug i s dispensed at each visit , every effort will be made to collect the unused study drug to 
confirm compliance . Investigators will perform drug accountability of study drug  at each visit to 
determine a subject’s usage . Study drug compliance will be assessed a t the 80% level . 

Axsome Therapeutics , Inc.  Confidential  and Proprietary   
AXS -05-MDD -201 
Version: FINAL (v 2.0) 28Jun2018  Page 28  
 
 
   
If non-compliance is determined, the site will be notified in writing and n oncompliant subjects 
may be discontinued from the study . Discontinued s ubjects should return for an Early Termination 
visit, performing all the study assessments for Visit 8/ET and then complete the follow -up visit 
one week after the final dose of study drug  (Visit 9) .  
8.12 Prior and Concomitant Therapies  
Medicat ion history during the previous 1 year (5 years in the case of psychiatric drug history) will 
be recorded at Screening (Visit 1) in the CRF. Thereafter, any changes in concomitant medications 
or new medications  added will be recorded in the CRF .  
At each  visit, subjects  will be queried as to whether or not they have  taken any concomitant  
medications and, if so, the I nvestigator will record the medications taken and the reasons for their  
use. All concomitant medications  and treatments  used (including over -the-counter medications 
and herbal supplements) will be recorded in the source document and on the appropriate CRF.  
8.12.1  Prohibited Therapies  
 
 The investigator should consult with the 
Axsome Medical Monitor if he/she is unsure whether a c ertain medication is prohibited . 
Psychotherapy for depression may not be initiated , terminate d, or change d during the course of the 
study (Support meetings or counseling [e.g., marital counseling] are allowed provided they are no 
more frequent than weekly and do not have treatment of depression as their objective).  
Phototherapy is prohibited during the course of the study and may not have be en initiated or 
terminated within 1 month of Visit 1 . 
Subjects who receive excluded therapies will be ineligible for continuation in the study at the 
discretion of the Sponsor and medical monitor.  
8.13 Treatment after  the End of Study  
After the end of the study, each subject will be treated according to standard clinical practice.

Subjects will provide written informed consent before any study -related procedures are initiated, 
including the cessation of prohibited conco mitant therapy.  
For the timing of assessments and procedures throughout the study, refer to the Schedule of 
Assessments  (Section  17.2). Throughout the study, every reasonable effort should be made by 
study personnel to follow the timing of assessments and procedures in the schedule of assessments  
for each subject. If a subject misses a study visit for any reason, the visit should be rescheduled as 
soon as possible.

Version: FINAL (v 2.0) 28Jun2018  Page 33 9.3.1.2  Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)  
The MADRS  [10] is a clinician -rated scale. The MADRS is used to assess depressi ve 
symptomatology during the previous week. Subjects are rated on 10 items to assess feelings of 
sadness, lassitude, pessimism, inner tension, suicidality, reduced sleep or appetite, difficulty 
concentrating and lack of interest. Each item is scored on a 7 -point scale. A score of 0 indicates 
the absence of symptoms, and a score of 6 indicates symptoms of maximum severity.  
9.3.1.3  Quick Inventory  of Depressive Symptomology – Self-Rated (QIDS -SR-16) 
The 16 -item QIDS -SR-16 [11], a patient -rated scale, is an abbreviated version of the 30 -item 
Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS)  and is designed to assess the severity of 
depressive symptoms.  The QIDS -SR-16 assesses criterion symptom domains to diagnose a major 
depressive epis ode.   
The QIDS -SR will be used to assess the subject ’s depressive symptomatology over the past 7 days.  
Subjects  report severity of symptoms on 10 items assessing sleep, feelings of sadness, appetite, 
weight change, concentration, self -regard, suicidality, general interest level, energy level, 
psychomotor retardation, and restlessness.  Each item will be scored on a  4-point scale with a score 
of 0 reflecting no symptoms and a score of 3 reflecting symptoms of maximum severity . 
9.3.1.4  Clinical Global Impression – Severity (CGI -S) 
The CGI -S scale  [12] is a clinician -rated scale used to rate the se verity of the subject’s current 
state of mental illness compared with a subject population with MDD. The subject is rated on a 
scale from 1 to 7, with 1 indicating a “normal state” and 7 indicating “among the most extremely 
ill subjects.” The CGI -S will be  administered by the Investigator or a Sub -Investigator with 
extensive professional training and experience in assessing mental illness.  
9.3.1.5  Clinical Global Impression – Improvement (CGI -I) 
The CGI -I scale  [12] is a clinician -rated  scale that is used to rate total improvement or worsening 
of mental ill ness regardless of whether the I nvestigator considers it to be a result of drug treatment 
or not. The subject is rated on a scale from 1 to 7, with 1 indicating that the subject is ver y much 
improved and 7 indicating that the subject is very much worse. The CGI -I will be administered by 
the Investigator or a Sub -Investigator with extensive professional training and experience in 
assessing mental illness.

most recent previous evaluation or if additional information is clinically necessary to appropriately 
follow up and/or manage an adverse experience.  
All b lood and urine samples will be sent to a central  laboratory for analyses.  
9.3.3.2.2  Pregnancy Testing  
Female subjects  will be required to have an onsite urine pregnancy test  at Visit 1, Visit 2 and Visit 
8/ET. 
A positive pregnancy test will exclude a subject from participating further in the study.  In the event 
that a false positive is suspected, a repeat pregnancy test may be performed.  Investigators should 
inquire at every study visit about the continued use of acceptable methods of contraception in

non-compliance with contraception.  
9.3.3.2.3  Specimen Handling Requirements  
The transmission of infectious agents may occur through contact with contaminated needles and 
blood or blood products. Consequently, appropriate blood and  body fluid precautions should be 
employed by all study personnel involved in the collection of blood and handling of specimens in 
both the clinic and laboratory settings. Refer to current recommendations of the appropriate 
authorities.  
In addition to appropriate handling of subject samples, specific regulations exist about the 
shipment of biologic/etiologic samples. Procedures and regulations for the packaging and shipping 
of infectious samples are outlined in the study laboratory manual . The Investigator is responsible 
for ensuring that all study samples that are to be transported to another location are appropriately 
packed and shipped according to the applicable regulations.   
9.3.3.2.4  Evaluation of Clinical Laboratory Values  
The normal ranges o f values for clinical laboratory assessments in this study will be provided by 
the responsible laboratory and submitted to Axsome or its designee before the start of the study. 
These will be regarded as the reference ranges on which decisions will be made.  
If a clinical laboratory value is out of the reference range, it is not necessarily clinically relevant. 
The Investigator is responsible for determining whether  these occurrences are considered as AEs. 
All clinical laboratory values that in the Investigat or’s opinion show clinically relevant or 
pathological changes during or after termination of the treatment must  be reported as A Es and 
followed as described in Section  10.2.5 . 
All measurements described in this section are recognized standard methods.  
9.3.3.3  Clinical Examinations  
9.3.3.3.1  Vital Signs  
Vital signs  will includ e seated blood pressure, pulse , respiratory rate, and oral temperature. Seated 
blood pressure and other vital signs will be measured after the subject has been in a sitting position 
for 5 minutes.  
9.3.3.3.2  Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination (excluding breast and genitourinary examination) will be 
performed at Screening  by a licensed phys ician or clinician (NP, DO, PA) and at the final on -site 
visit ( Visit 8/ET). Physical examination will include assessments of head, eyes, ears, nose, throat,  
lymph nodes, skin, extremities, respiratory, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and  
nervous systems. The physical examination  should be performed by the same perso n each time, 
whenever possible. Physical examination a bnormalities determined by the I nvestigator to be 
clinically significant at Screening should be recorded as medical histor y. The thoroughness of the 
Visit 8/ET physical examination  is at the di scretion and judgment of the Investigator , but should 
include a brief review of systems to ensure there hav e been no changes since Screening .

9.3.3.3.3.1  Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The C -SSRS [14] is a clinician -rated instrument that reports the severity of both su icidal ideation 
and beha vior. Suicidal ideation is classified on a 5 -item scale: 1 (wish to be dead), 2 (nonspec ific 
active suicidal thoughts), 3 (active suicidal ideation with any methods [not plan] without intent to 
act), 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan), and 5 (active suicidal 
ideation with specific plan and intent). The  C-SSRS also captures information about the intensity 
of ideation, specifically the frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reasons for the 
most severe types of ideation. Suicidal behavior is classified on a 5 -item scale: 0 (no suicidal 
behav ior), 1 (preparatory acts or behavior), 2 (aborted attempt), 3 (interrupted attempt), and 4 
(actual attempt). More than 1 classification can be selected provided they represent separate 
episodes. For actual attempts only, the actual or potential lethality is classified for the initial, most 
lethal, and most recent attempts.  
The C-SSRS will be completed at Visit s 1, 2, and 4  – 9. At Visit 1 (Screening ) the C-SSRS will 
be completed for the subject’s lifetime history of suicidal ideation and behavior, along w ith a recent 
recall period. At all other visits the C -SSRS will be completed for ideation and behavior with a 
recall period since the last visit.  
The C-SSRS will be administered  by the Investigator .   
10. ADVERSE EVENTS  
10.1 Definitions  
10.1.1  Adverse Events  
An AE is defi ned as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
the product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a new, 
clinically important abnormal labor atory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated 
with the product, whether or not related to the product.  
Pre-existing diseases or conditions will not be considered A Es unless  there is an increase in the 
frequency or severity, or a change in the quality, of the disease or condition. (Worsening of a 
pre-existing condition is considered an AE.)  
Events that occur in s ubjects treated with active comparator or during treatment -free periods of the 
study are also considered A Es. 
Clinical AEs should be described by diagnosis and not by symptoms when possible (e.g., cold,  
seasonal allergies, instead of “runny nose”).  
Please note medical procedures scheduled prior to consenting, but occur ring during the study 
should not be captured as AEs, but should be listed in the medical history if related to a pre -existing 
condition.  
10.1.2  Adverse Drug Reaction  
All noxious and unintended responses to a  study drug  related to any dose should be considered 
adverse drug reactions (ADRs).  
Axsome Therapeutics , Inc.  Confidential  and Proprietary   
AXS -05-MDD -201 
Version: FINAL (v 2.0) 28Jun2018  Page 37 The phrase “responses to a  study drug ” means that a causal relationship between a study drug  and 
an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out. All A Es judged 
by either the  reporting Investigator or the S ponsor as having a reasonable causal relationship to a 
study drug  qualify as ADRs.  
All A Es for which the judgment of relationship to the study drug is “possible” or higher will be 
considered ADRs. If a relationship to the study drug is not  given, then the AE must be treated as 
if the relationsh ip to the study drug were “possible.”   
10.1.3  Unexpected Adverse Event/Adverse Drug Reaction  
An expected AE or ADR  is an event  for which the nature or severity is consistent with the known 
AE profile of the product. For a  study drug , the known information is contained in the IB  and in 
the current package inserts for marketed drugs that contain the same active moiety . For a market ed 
product, the known information is contained in the current package insert for the product.  
An unexpected adverse event (UAE) or unexpected adverse drug reaction  (UADR) is an event  for 
which the specificity or severity is not consistent with the current IB. For example, hepatic necrosis 
would be unexpected (greater severity) if the IB only listed elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. 
Likewise, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (greater 
specificity) if the IB only listed  cerebral vascular accidents.  
Furthermore, reports that add significant information on specificity or severity of a known, already 
documented adverse reaction constitute unexpected events. Examples would be a) acute renal 
failure as an expected adverse rea ction with a subsequent new occurrence of interstitial nephritis 
(interstitial nephritis would be unexpected) and b) hepatitis with a first occurrence of fulminant 
hepatitis (fulminant hepatitis would be unexpected.)  
10.1.4  Serious Adverse Events /Drug Reaction  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death . 
 Is life -threatening . 
NOTE: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in 
which the subject  was at risk of death at the tim e of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization . 
NOTE: Inpatient hospitalization is defined  as 24  hours in a hospital or an overnight stay.  
An elective hospital admission to treat a condition present before exposure to the study  
drug, or a hospital admission for a diagnostic evaluation of an AE, does not  qualify the 
condition or event as an SAE.  Further, an overnight stay in the hospital that is only due to 
transportation, organization, or accommodation problems and without medical 
background does not need to be considered an SAE.  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
 Is a congenital anomaly . 
NOTE: A congenital anomaly in an infant born to a mother who was exposed to the study 
drug  during pregnancy is an SAE. However, a newly diagnosed pregnancy in a subject who 
has received a study drug  is not considered an SAE unless it is  suspected that the study 
drug (s) interacted with a contraceptive method and led to the pregnancy.  
Axsome Therapeutics , Inc.  Confidential  and Proprietary   
AXS -05-MDD -201 
Version: FINAL (v 2.0) 28Jun2018  Page 38  Is an important medical event . 
NOTE: Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether it is 
appropriate to consider other situations serious, such as important medical events  that may 
not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize 
the subject  or may require intervention to prevent 1 of the other outcomes listed in the 
definition above. Examp les of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. The occurrence of 
malignant tumors  is also to be considered serious . 
10.1.5  Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events  
An AE is defined as treatment emergent if the first onset or worsening is after the first 
administration of the study  drug and not more than 30 days after the last study visit . 
10.2 Management  of Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be collected from the time of signing the ICF through 30 days after the last 
study visit  or Early Termination, whichever occurs first.  Only Serious adverse events will be 
collected  for subjects who screen fail.  
10.2.1  Collection  of Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria 
and definition of an AE or SAE described  previously. At each visit, the subject will be allowed 
time to spontaneously report any issues since the last visit or evaluation. The Investigator will then 
monitor and/or ask about or evaluate A Es using nonleading questions, such as : 
 “How are you feeling?”  
 “Have you experienced any issues since your last visi t?” 
 “Have you taken any new medications since your last visit?”  
Any clinically relevant observations made during the visit will also be considered A Es. 
10.2.2  Evaluation  of Adverse Events  
10.2.2.1  Severity of Adverse Events  
The clinical severity of an AE will be classified as : 
Mild  Usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic 
intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of 
daily living.  
Moderate  Usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic interv ention. The event 
interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no 
significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.  
Severe  Interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, 
or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
It is important to distinguish between severe A Es and SAEs. Severity is a classification of intensity 
whereas an SAE is an AE that meets serious criteria, as described in Section  10.1.4 . 
Axsome Therapeutics , Inc.  Confidential  and Proprietary   
AXS -05-MDD -201 
Version: FINAL (v 2.0) 28Jun2018  Page 39 10.2.2.2  Seriousness  
The Investigator is to evaluate whether the AE meets serious criteria, as described in 
Section  10.1.4 . 
10.2.2.3  Action(s) Taken  
Action(s) taken may consist of : 
Dose increased  An indication that a medication schedule was modified by addition; either 
by changing the frequency, strength , or amount.  
Dose  not changed  An indication that a medication schedule was maintained.  
Dose reduced  An indication that a medication schedule was modified by subtraction, 
either by changing the frequency, strength , or amount.  
Drug interrupted  An indication that a medicati on schedule was modified by temporarily 
terminating a prescribed regimen of medication.  
Drug withdrawn  An indication that a medication schedule was modified through termination 
of a prescribed regimen of medication.  
Not applicable  Determination of a valu e is not relevant in the current context.  
Unknown  Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.  
10.2.2.4  Outcome at the Time of Last Observation  
The outcome , including Fatal,  at the time of last observation will be classified  per CRF completion 
instructions.  Only select fatal as an outcome when the AE results in death. If more than 1 AE is 
possibly related to the subject’s death, the outcome of death should be indicated for each such AE. 
Although “fatal” is usually an event outcome, events such as sudden death or unexplained death 
should be reported as SAEs.  
10.2.2.5  Adverse Event Relationship  to the Study Drug  
The Investigator will also assess the relationship (if any) between the AE and the study treatment 
(not related, unlikely, possibly, probably or definitely ). 
The Investigator will use the following definitions to classify the relationshi p of an AE to study 
drug: 
Not related:  AEs which, after careful consideration, are clearly and undeniably unrelated 
because of extraneous causes (e.g. disease, environment);  
Unlikely:  This category can generally be considered applicable to those A Es which,  after 
careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are judged to be 
unrelated to the test drug. An AE may be considered unlikely to be related if or 
when at least two of the following criteria are fulfilled:  
1) The event does not follow a  reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of the test drug;  
2) The event could readily have been produced by the subject ’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the 
subject ; 
3) The event does not follow a known pattern of response to the test drug;  
4) The event does not reappear or worsen when the drug is re -administered.  
Axsome Therapeutics , Inc.  Confidential  and Proprietary   
AXS -05-MDD -201 
Version: FINAL (v 2.0) 28Jun2018  Page 40 Possibly :  This category applies to those A Es for which, after careful medical consideration at 
the time they are evaluated, a c onnection with the test drug administration appears 
unlikely, but cannot be ruled out with certainty. An AE may be considered possibly 
related if or when at least two of the following criteria are fulfilled:  
1) The event follows a reasonable temporal seque nce from administration of the 
drug;  
2) The event could not readily have been produced by the subject ’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the 
subject ; 
3) The event follows a known pattern of response to the test drug.  
Probably : This category applies to those A Es which, after careful medical consideration at the 
time they are evaluated, are felt with a high degree of certainty to be related to the 
test drug. An AE may be considered probably related if o r when least three of the 
following criteria are fulfilled:  
1) The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug;  
2) The event could not be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the 
subject ’s clinical state, en vironmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy 
administered to the subject ; 
3) The event disappears or decreases on stopping or reducing the dose. There are 
important exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of 
the drug, but d rug-relatedness clearly exists, e.g. bone marrow depression, fixed 
drug eruptions, tardive dyskinesia;  
4) The event follows a known pattern of response to the test drug.  
Definitely : This category applies to those A Es, which the Investigator feels are undeniably 
related to the test drug. An AE may be assigned an attribution of definitely related 
if or when all the following criteria are fulfilled:  
1) The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug;  
2) The event could not  be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the 
subject ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy 
administered to the subject ; 
3) The event disappears or decreases on stopping or reducing the dose and reappear s 
with re -exposure to study drug  (Note: this does not mean that the subject  is to be 
re-exposed to study drug , however, a category of definitely related can only be 
used when recurrence is observed);  
4) The event follows a known pattern of response to the test drug.  
10.2.3  Documentation  
All A Es occurring within the period of observation for the study must be documented in the CRF 
with the following information, where appropriate. (The period of observation for the study is 
described in Section  10.2.) 
 AE name or term . 
 When the AE first occurred (start date and time) . 
 When the AE stopped (stop date and time or an indication of “ongoing”) . 
Axsome Therapeutics , Inc.  Confidential  and Proprietary   
AXS -05-MDD -201 
Version: FINAL (v 2.0) 28Jun2018  Page 41  Severity of the AE . 
 Seriousness ( e.g., hospitalization  or death) . 
 Actions taken . 
 Outcome . 
 Investigator opinion regarding the AE relationship to the study drug (s). 
10.2.4  Treatment of Adverse Events  
Adverse events that occur during the study will be treated if necessary by established standards of 
care. If such treatment constitutes a deviation from the protocol, the subject may continue in the 
study  at the discretion of Axsome  after consultation with the Investigator and/or medical monitor.  
Any time a subject  reports an AE that is considered to be serious, he or she  should be encouraged 
to return to the site to be evaluated, which will include having blood and urine samples taken for 
drug concentrations. Recent dietary information will be collected.  
If AEs occ ur in a subject that are not tolerable, or for which continued administration of the study 
drug is not reasonable in view of the potential benefit to the subject, the Investigator must decide 
whether to stop the study and/or treat the subject . Special proc edures may be recommended for the 
specific study drug , such as the collection of a blood  sample for plasma  concentrations of the study 
drug, specific tapering procedures, or treatment regimens, as appropriate.  
For double -blinded studies, it is not necessar y to unblind a subject’s treatment assignment in most 
circumstances, even if an SAE has occurred. If unblinding is necessary, see Section  8.6 for a 
description of the unblinding procedures.  
10.2.5  Follow -up of Adverse Events  
Any AE will be followed to a satisfactory resolution, until it becomes stable, or until it can be 
explained by another known cause(s) (i .e., concurrent condition or medication) an d clinical 
judgment indicates that further evaluation is not warranted. All findings relevant to the final 
outcome of an AE must be reported in the subject’s medical record and recorded on the appropriate 
CRF.  
10.2.6  Notification  
10.2.6.1  Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator or designee must report all SAEs promptly to  within 24  hours of first 
becoming aware of the event by completing the SAE  Report Form and faxing or emailing it to 
number  or email  shown below . Axsome’ s Medical Monitor may also be notified by  telephone.  
Even if an initial report is made by telephone, the SAE Report Form must be completed with all 
available details and faxed within 24 hours of knowledge of the event at the study site.  
At the time of first notification, the Investigator or desig nee should provide the following 
information, if available:  
 Protocol number . 
 Reporter (study site and Investigator) . 
 Subject’s study number and initials . 
 Subject’s date of birth . 
 Subject’s gender . 
 Date of first dose of study drug (s).

 Investigator’s opinion of the relationship to the study drug (s).  
 Whether and when the Investigator was unblinded as to the subject’s treatment 
assignment . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Investigator must fax  or e-mail a written SAE Report Form that describes the SAE to the 
recipient(s) of the initial information, who will forward the information to Axsome . The 
Investigator must also immediately deliver any available supporting information requested on the 
SAE Report Form or by Axsome.  
Any missing or additional relevant information concerning the SAE should be provided to the 
recipient(s) of the initial information in a written, follow -up SAE Report Form . Supplemental 
information should be submitted as soon as available and  may include laboratory results, radiology 
reports, progress notes, hospital admission and emergency room notes, holding and observation 
notes, discharge summaries, autopsy reports, and death certificates.  
The I nvestigator is expected to take all therapeut ic measures necessary for resolution of the SAE. 
Any medications or procedures necessary for treatment of the SAE must be recorded on the 
appropriate pages of the subject’s CRF. All SAEs are to be followed by the study staff until 
resolution or until the S AE is deemed stable. Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. may contact the study site 
to solicit additional information or follow up on the event.  
The Investigator is required to comply with applicable regulations (including local laws and 
guidances) regarding the notification of his  or her health authorities, institutional review board 
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (I EC), principal and coordinating Investigators, study 
Investigators, and institutions. The detailed reporting duties and division of responsibilit ies 
between Axsome and designated vendors  will be provided in a separate document (see the  Safety 
Management Plan). Each I nvestigator is obligated to learn about the reporting requirements for 
Investigators in his or her country. The study monitor may be a ble to assist with this.

Version: FINAL (v 2.0) 28Jun2018  Page 43 10.2.6.2  Adverse Drug Reactions  
Axsome will report a ll ADRs related to the study drug to the proper health authorities; serious 
ADRs will be reported immediately and nonserious ADRs will be reported after completion of the 
study. Suspected serious adverse drug reactions must be reported to Axsome immediately, 
regardless of the time that has elapsed since the end of the period of observation.  
10.2.6.3  Nonserious Adverse Events  
Axsome  will review n onserious A Es that are recorded in the CRF s on a regula r basis.  
10.3 Special Considerations  
10.3.1  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
No A Es of special interests have been defined for this study.  
10.3.2  Pregnancy  
In the rare chance that a pregnancy occurs or is suspected, w omen should be instructed to contact 
the Investigator or  study staff immediately.  
A woman who becomes pregnant during study drug  treatment o r within 30  days of discontinuing 
the study drug will be immediately discontinued from study participation. The Investigator must 
report the pregnancy as if it were an SAE within 24 hours  of learning of the pregnancy. The 
Investigator should contact the designated individual(s) who receive SAE notification and record 
information related to the pregnancy on a Pregnancy and Lactation Exposure Form /other 
designated form  provided by Axsome  or its designee.  
Early termination visit assessments are required as soon as possible after learning of the pregnancy. 
The Investigator is also responsible for following the pregnancy until delivery or termination. 
Findings must be repo rted on the Pregnancy and Lactation Exposure Form /other designated form 
and forwarded to the designated individual(s). The event meets the SAE criterion only if it results 
in a spontaneous abortion or a congenital anomaly.  If the pregnancy is associated wi th an SAE 
(e.g., if the mother is hospitalized for hemorrhage), a separate SAE Form must be filed with the 
appropriate serious criterion (e.g., hospitalization) indicated in addition to the aforementioned 
designated form.  
10.3.3  Overdose  
The dose of study drug  specified in the protocol  should not be exceeded during the study.  
Overdose that occurs during the study will be treated and documented as an AE/ UAE /SAE if it 
fulfills the criteria. If the overdose does not result in an AE, it should be reported in written f orm 
to the designated individual(s) who receive SAE notification. The information contained therein 
should include study site identification, reporter identification, subject identification, study drug , 
dose, action taken (e .g., administration of antidote [if available] or supportive measures or 
therapy), and any comments.  
11. DATA SAFETY MONITORI NG BOARD  
No Data Safety Monitoring Board will be convened during the study.   
12. STATISTICS  
The final analysis plan will be documented in a formal statistical analysis pl an (SAP) that must be 
finalized before database lock. The SAP will include details on how variables will be derived, how

12.2 Sample Size Determination  
Approximately 60 subjects (30 per arm) , who are compliant and who complete the 6 -week 
treatme nt period,  are planned for this study. The sample was determined based on prior reported 
experience with trials of a similar stage, in a similar patient population, with a similar objective. 
A sufficient number of subjects will be screened to achieve the planned number of subjects.    
12.3 Analysis Populations  
The following 3  analysis populations are planned for this study:  
 Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population —the mITT population and will include data 
from  all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug and provide at least 1 post-
Baseline assessment .  
 Intent -to-Treat Population —the ITT will include all subjects who are randomized  
 Safety Population —the Safety Population will be the primary safety analysis population 
and will  include all subject s who receive at least 1  dose of the study drug.  
Membership in the analysis populations will be determined before unblinding.  
12.4 Statistical Analyses  
Unless otherwise indicated, all testing of statistical significance will be 2-sided, and a difference 
result ing in a P value of less than or equal to 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. 
Furthermore, the baseline will be the last assessment before the first dosing of the study drug . 
Summary statistics will be provided for the variables described in the following sections . For 
continuous variables, these statistics will typically include the number of subjects, mean, standard 
deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. For categorical variables, these statistics will 
typically include the number an d percentage of subjects in each category.  
12.4.1  Study Subjects and Demographics  
12.4.1.1  Disposition and Withdrawals

Version: FINAL (v 2.0) 28Jun2018  Page 47 The Investigator also agrees to conduct this study in accor dance with all laws, regulations, and 
guidelines of the pertinent regulatory authorities  (Section 15.1 and Appendix  B). While delegation 
of certain  aspects of the study to S ub-Investigators and study coordinators is appropriate, the 
Investigator will remain personally accountable for closely overseeing the study and for ensuring 
compliance with the protocol and all applicable regulations and guidelin es. The Investigator is 
responsible for maintaining a list of all persons that have been delegated study -related 
responsibilities (e .g., Sub-Investigators and study coordinators) and their specific study -related 
duties.  
Investigators should ensure that all  persons who have been delegated study -related responsibilities 
are adequately qualified and informed about the protocol, study drug s, and their specific duties 
within the context of the study. Investigators are responsible for providing Axsome  with 
docume ntation of the qualifications, GCP training, and research experience for themselves and 
their staff as required by Axsome  and the relevant governing authorities.  
To ensure compliance with the guidelines, the study will be audited by an independent person. The 
Investigator agrees, by written consent to this protocol, to cooperate fully with compliance checks 
by allowing access to all study documentation by authorized individuals.  
13.2 Site Initiation  
Study personnel may not screen or enroll subjects into the stud y until after receiving notification 
from Axsome  or its designee that the study can be initiated at the study site. The study site will not 
be authorized for study initiation until:  
 The study site has received the appropriate IRB/IEC approval for the proto col and the 
appropriate ICF.  
 All regulatory/GCP documents have been submitted to and approved by Axsome  or its 
designee.  
 The study site has a Clinical Trial Agreement in place.  
 Study site personnel, including the Investigator, have participated in a study initiation 
meeting /visit . 
13.3 Study Documents

copies of regulatory references, copies of IRB/IEC correspondence, and study product  
accountability records should also be retained as part of the Investigator’s regulatory documents. 
It is the Investigator’s responsi bility to ensure that copies of all required regulatory  documents are 
organized, current, and available for inspection.  
13.3.2  Case Report Forms  
By signing the Investigator’s Agreement (Section  17.1), the Investigat or agrees to maintain 
accurate CRF s and source documentation as part of the case histories for all participating subjects.  
Case report forms are considered confidential docume nts and should be handled and stored 
accordingly. Axsome  or its designee will provide the necessary train ing on the use of the specific 
CRF s used during the study to ensure that the study information is captured accurately and 
appropriately.  
To ensure data  accuracy, CRF data for individual subject visits should be completed as soon as 
possible after the visit. All requested information must be entered on the CRFs according to the 
completion guidelines provided by Axsome  or its designee.  
The Investigator wil l sign off each subject casebook . These signatures serve to attest that th e 
information contained in the CRF s is accurate and true.  
13.3.3  Source Documents  
All information recorded in the CRFs  must be supported by corresponding source documentation. 
Examples of a cceptable source documentation include, but are not limited to, hospital records, 
clinic and office charts, laboratory notes, and recorded data from automated instruments, 
memoranda, and pharmacy dispensing records.  
During the study, select CRF data may be  used as original data collection tools as long as a 
description of this documentation process is maintained in the Investigator’s study files. Before 
the study starts, a list identifying any data to be recorded directly on the CRFs ( i.e., no prior written 
or electronic record of data) and considered to be source data will be provided.  
Clinical laboratory data required by the protocol will be electronically transferred from the central 
laboratory to Axsome  or its designee  as well as the Investigator . A copy of the laboratory results 
should be retained with each subject’s source data.  
13.4 Data Quality Control  
Axsome  and its designees will perform quality control checks on this clinical study.  
13.4.1  Monitoring Procedures  
Axsome  and/or its designee will conduct site visits to monitor the study and ensure compliance 
with the protocol, GCP, and applicable regulations and guidelines. The assigned clinical research 
associate(s) (CRA[s]) will visit the Investigator and study site at periodic inte rvals and maintain 
periodic communication. The Investigator agrees to allow the CRA(s) and other authorized 
Axsome  personnel access. The CRA(s) will maintain current personal knowledge of the study 
through observation, review of study records and source do cumentation, and discussion of the 
conduct of the study with the Investigator and staff. While on site, the CRA(s) will review  the 
following:  
 Regulatory documents, directly comparing entries in the CRFs  with the source documents . 
 Consenting procedures . 
 AE procedures . 
Axsome Therapeutics , Inc.  Confidential  and Proprietary

 Maintenance of study blind.  
The CRA will ask for clarification and/or correction of any noted inconsistencies. Procedures for 
correcting the CRF s are described in the CRF complet ion guidelines . As representatives of 
Axsome , CRAs are responsible for notifying project management of any noted protocol deviations.  
By signing the Investigator’s Agreement (Section  17.1), the Investigator agrees to meet with the 
CRA(s) during study site visits; to ensure that study staff is available to the CRA(s) as needed; to 
provide the CRA(s) access to all study documentation, to the clinical supplies dispensing and 
storage area; and to assis t the monitors in their activities, if requested. Further, the Investigator 
agrees to allow Axsome  or designee auditors or inspectors from regulatory agencies to review 
records and to assist the inspectors in their duties, if requested.  
13.4.2  Data Management  
Axsome or its designee will be responsible for activities associated with the data management of 
this study. The standard procedures for handling and processing records will be followed per GCP 
and Axsome or its vendors’  standard operating procedures.

Investigator will be required to document data review to ensure the accuracy of the corrected 
and/or clarified data. Procedures for soliciting and documenting resolution to data queries are 
described in the CRF completion guidelines . 
13.4.3  Quality Assurance/Audit  
This study will be subject to audit by Axsome  or its designee. The audits will be undertaken to 
check compliance with GCP guidelines and will include a minimum of:  
 In-house study file audit . 
 Audit of computer database quality control . 
 Audit of clinical report quality control . 
Axsome  or its designee may conduct additional audits on a selection of study sites, requiring access 
to subject notes, study documentation, and fac ilities or laboratories used for the study.  
The study site, facilities, all data (including source data), and documentation will be made available 
for audit by quality assurance auditors and for IRB/IEC or regulatory authorities according to GCP 
guidelines . The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the auditor during the visit and will be 
available to supply the auditor with CRFs or other files necessary to conduct that audit. Any 
findings will be strictly confidential.  
If a regulatory authority informs the  Investigator that it intends to conduct an inspection, the 
Investigator shall notify Axsome  immediately.  
13.5 Study Termination  
The study may be terminated at Axsome’s  discretion at any time and for any reason.  
13.5.1  Regular Study Termination  
The end of this study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last subject (last subject out or 
last subject last visit) participating in the study. Within 90 days of the end of the clinical study, 
Axsome or its designee will notify the IRBs/IECs and regulatory authorit ies on the regular 
termination of the study as required according to national laws and regulations.  
Axsome Therapeutics , Inc.  Confidential  and Proprietary   
AXS -05-MDD -201 
Version: FINAL (v 2.0) 28Jun2018  Page 50 13.5.2  Premature Study Termination  
The study may be terminated prematurely for any reason and at any time by Axsome , IRBs/ IECs, 
regulatory authorities, or respective steering committees. A decision to prematurely terminate the 
study is binding to all Investigators of all study sites.  
Within 15  days of premature termination of a clinical study, Axsome  or its designee will notify 
the IRB/ IEC and regulatory aut horities  as appropriate  on the premature termination as required 
according to national laws and regulations. Axsome  or its designee must clearly explain the reasons 
for premature termination.  
If the study is terminated prematurely, all Investigators have t o inform their subjects and take care 
of appropriate follow -up and further treatment of the subjects to ensure protection of the subjects’ 
interests. Study sites may be asked to have all subjects currently participating in the study complete 
all of the ass essments for the Early Termination Visit.  
13.6 Study Site Closure  
A study site’s participation in the study may be terminated at any time by Axsome.  At the end of 
the study, all study sites will be closed.  This will include the Investigators final approval an d lock 
of all subject  data, return of unused study material and investigational product unless otherwise 
provided for in writing by Axsome, and final visits by study monitors.  
13.6.1  Record Retention  
The Investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to  enable the conduct of the study 
to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These documents should be 
separated into two categories: Investigator’s study file and subject  clinical source documents.  
 The Investigator’s study file will contain the protocol and protocol amendments (if 
applicable), CRF guidelines, CRF query forms, I RB/I EC and governmental approval with 
correspondence, informed consent, drug records, staff curriculum vitae and authorization 
forms and other appropriate documents and correspondence.  
 Subject  clinical source documents (which are usually defined by the project in advance to 
record key parameters independent of the CRF) may include subject  and/or hospital clinical 
records, physician’s and nurse’s notes, appoi ntment book, original laboratory reports, X -
ray, pathology and special assessment reports, consultant’s letters, screening and 
enrollment log, etc.  
The subject ’s involvement in the study should be clearly documented in the study site’s clinical 
records. De tails should include the study protocol number, the subject ’s screening and 
randomization number, the subject ’s consent to take part in the study (including the date of 
consent), the dates of all study visits, details of any treatments withdrawn because of  study 
participation, the dates of dispensing study drug , details of any A Es (including any SAEs), and 
changes in concomitant medications.  
Study documents should not be destroyed without prior written agreement between the Sponsor  
and the Investigator. If the Investigator wishes to assign the study records to another party or move 
them to another location, the Sponsor  must be notified in advance.  
If the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement for any or all the documents at the 
investigational site, arrangements must be made between the Investigator and the Sponsor  to store 
these in a sealed container(s) outside the site. The sealed contai ner(s) can therefore be returned to 
Axsome Therapeutics , Inc.  Confidential  and Proprietary   
AXS -05-MDD -201 
Version: FINAL (v 2.0) 28Jun2018  Page 51 the Investigator in case of a regulatory audit. Where source documents are required for the 
continued care of the subject , appropriate copies should be made for storing outside the site.  
13.7 Changes to the Protocol  
This protocol cannot be altered or changed except through a formal protocol amendment, which 
requires the written approval of Axsome . The protocol amendment must be signed by the 
Investigator and approved by the IRB or IEC before it may be implemented  at a site. Protocol 
amendments will be filed with the appropriate regulatory agenc ies having jurisdiction over the 
conduct of the study.  
13.8 Use of Information and Publication  
All information concerning AXS -05, Axsome ’s operations, patent applications, formulas, 
manufacturing processes, basic scientific data, and formulation information supplied by Axsome  
or its designee to the Investigator and not previously published, is considered confidential and 
remains the sole property of Axsome . Case report forms also remai n the property of Axsome . The 
Investigator agrees to use this information for purposes of study execution through final ization and 
will not use it for other purposes without the written consent of Axsome . 
The information developed in this study will be use d by Axsome  in connection with the continued 
development of AXS -05 and thus may be disclosed as required to other clinical Investigators or 
government regulatory agencies.  
The information generated by this study is the property of Axsome . Publication or ot her public 
presentation of AXS -05 data resulting from this study requires prior review and written approval 
of Axsome . Abstracts, manuscripts, and presentation materials should be provided to Axsome  for 
review and approval at least 30  days before the relev ant submission deadline. Data from individual 
study sites must not be published separately , unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Sponsor . 
It is agreed that the results of the study will not be submitted for presentation, abstract, poster 
exhibition  or publication by the Investigator until Axsome  has reviewed and commented on such 
a presentation or manuscript for publication.  
14. FINAL CLINICAL STUDY  REPORT  
Axsome  will retain ownership of the data  generated from the study . 
The final clinical study report  will be written within 1 year of completion of the clinical part of the 
study. This report will include a summary of the study results based on a statistical evaluation and 
clinical assessment of the protocol -defined endpoints.

15.1 Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the April 1996 ICH  Guidance for Industry E6 
GCP (including archiving of essential study documents), the 1996  Version of the Declaration of 
Helsinki, and the applicable regulations of the countries in which the study is conducted.  
See Appendix B for regulations and guideline s. 
15.2 Subject Information and Informed Consent  
A properly constituted, valid IRB or IEC must review and approve the protocol, the Investigator’s 
informed consent document, and related subject information and recruitment materials before the 
start of the study . 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that written informed consent is obtained from 
the subject before any activity or procedure is undertaken that is not part of routine care.  
According to the Declaration of Helsinki and ICH GCP, subje cts must provide their written 
informed consent before  enrollment in a clinical study and before any protocol -specified 
procedures are performed.  Informed consent will be obtained from each subject  (if the subject  is 
capable in the judgment of the I nvestig ator to provide informed consent)  or the subject’s 
authorized representative.  For subjects  that are not capable of providing informed consent,  but are 
capable of providing assent, the subject  will be asked to provide assent. If the subject  is not ca pable 
of providing assent, the I nvestigator will document the reasons why and maintain that  
documentation with the other informed consent documents. The written ICF will embody the 
elements of informed consent as described in the Declaration of Helsinki and will also comply 
with local regulations.  
Each subject should be made aware by the Investigator of the nature of the study ( i.e., objectives, 
methods, and potential hazards and benefits)  and the procedures involved, using the information 
on the ICF. Information should be given in both oral and written form whenever possible and 
deemed appropriate by the IRB/IEC. Subjects  (and if necessary, legal representatives ) must be 
given ample opport unity to inquire about details of the study.  
Subject information and the ICF must be in a language fully comprehen sible to the prospective 
subject . The written information must be provided to the subject  and to give them  sufficient time 
to understand the i nformation and to prepare questions before being asked for their consent. The 
Investigator must confirm that the text was understood by the subject  or the subject’s authorized 
representative . Subjects capable of signing consent, or the subject’s authorized  representative, will 
then sign and date the IRB/IEC -approved consent form indicating that they have given their 
consent to participate in the study. The signature s confirm the consent s are based on information 
that has been understood. The form s will also  be signed by the Investigator , or designee,  obtaining 
the consent s and annotated with the study subject number. Each subject’s signed ICF s must be 
kept on file by the Investigator for possible inspection by regulatory authorities, Axsome,  and/or 
designate d personnel. Collection of informed consent has to be documented on the CRF.  
Furthermore, the subject will be informed that if they wish to dropout or withdraw (see  Section  7.3) 
at any time during the study, this will not have any negative consequences. Subjects may be 
withdrawn by the Investigator if any change related to safety or ethics precludes further 
participation in the study. Subjects will be  asked to agree to a final assessment in the event of an 
early termination of the study.  
Axsome Therapeutics , Inc.  Confidential  and Proprietary   
AXS -05-MDD -201 
Version: FINAL (v 2.0) 28Jun2018  Page 53 Subjects will be informed that data from their case may be stored in a computer without inclusion 
of their name s and such data will not be revealed to any unauthorized  third party. Data will be 
reviewed by the monitor, an independent auditor, and possibly by representatives of regulatory 
authorities and/or IRBs/IECs. The terms of the local data protection legislation will be applied as 
appropriate.  
15.3 Approval by Institutional Review Board and Independent Ethics Committee  
For investigational new drug studies, the minimum standards of conduct and requirements for 
informed consent are defined in the US FDA  regulations.  
A valid IRB  or IEC must review and approve this protocol before study initiation. Written 
notification of approval is to be submitted by the Investigator to the Axsome  monitor before 
shipment of investigational drug supplies, and will include the date of the committee’s approval 
and the chairperson’s si gnature.  
Until written approval by the IRB  or IEC has been received by the Investigator, no subject may 
undergo any procedure solely for determining eligibility for this study.  
Protocol amendments must also be reviewed and approved by the IRB  or IEC. Axso me must 
receive their w ritten approval before implementation.  
15.4 Finance and Insurance  
Details on finance and insurance will be provided in a separate agreement between the Investigator 
and Axsome .

 45 
2.  ABSTRACT    46 
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is considered a signature psychiatric disorder among military populations. When left 47 
untreated, the symptoms of PTSD can cause significant health and functional impairments. While established treatments 48 
for PTSD exist, there remains room for improvement in outcomes since almost half of military patients fail to benefit from 49 
treatment. Epidiolex (Cannabidiol [CBD]) is an FDA -approved, non -controlled prescription medication with promising 50 
potential for the treatment of PTSD.1,2 To date, there are no published clinical trials investigating CBD in reducing PTSD, 51 
and existing literature in humans with PTSD only includes healthy individuals or case study data. Greater research is 52 
needed to fully understand the benefits of CBD for PTSD and to better understand biological mechanisms for its effect. 53 
The primary goal of this pilot project is to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of using CBD in combination with standard 54 
of care prolonged exposure (PE) psychotherapy to reduce PTSD symptoms (Aim 1). We will also assess possible 55 
biochemical and physiological outcomes associated with treatment (Aim 2) and evaluate the relationship between 56 
changes in biochemical/physiological measures with PTSD symptom reductions (Aim 3). To address study aims, we will 57 
enroll 24 individuals with PTSD to be randomized to CBD (n=12) or placebo (n=12) and all participants will receive 10 58 
daily sessions of PE.  59 
3.  OBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS/RESEARCH QUESTIONS  60 
This project will be a pilot, double -blind randomized controlled trial of CBD effects to pursue three goals: (1) to 61 
demonstrate the safety and feasibility of using CBD to reduce PTSD symptoms in conjunction with massed PE (mPE); (2) 62 
to assess biochemical and physiological outcomes associated with PTSD treatment; and (3) to evaluate the possible 63 
relationship between changes in biochemical/physiological measures with PTSD symptom reductions.  64 
 65 
Aim 1 : To examine the safety, feasibility, and PTSD symptom reductions associated with CBD (n=12) vs. placebo (n=12) 66 
in 24 individuals  receiving 10 daily sessions of mPE as a standard of care for PTSD.  67 
Hypothesis 1 : Combining CBD with mPE will be safe based on minimal (< 5%) adverse events and no serious adverse 68 
events related to treatment in the study.  69 
Hypothesis 2 : A CBD vs. placebo trial design will be feasible defined as 75% or more of assessed individuals meeting 70 
all eligibility criteria and 80% or more of CBD participants completing all 10 mPE sessions.  71 
Hypothesis 3 : Participants in the CBD condition will have greater treatment -related PTSD reductions than placebo as 72 
measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS -5)3 and PTSD Checklist (PCL -5).4 73 
Aim 2 : To evaluate biochemical and physiological levels associated with the eCB system and stress response in CBD vs. 74 
placebo.  75 
Hypothesis 4 : Participants in the CBD condition will have higher levels of AEA and 2 -AG, and lower levels of cortisol 76 
than placebo following treatment.  77 
Hypothesis 5 : Participants in the CBD condition will have lower average heart rate during exposure therapy sessions 78 
than placebo.  79 
Aim 3 : To determine the association between changes in biomarker levels (cortisol, AEA, 2-AG), physiology (heart rate), 80 
and PTSD symptom reduction following treatment.  81 
Hypothesis 6 : Reductions in cortisol and increases in AEA and 2 -AG will be associated with PTSD symptom reductions 82 
following treatment.  83 
Hypothesis 7 : Lower average heart rate observed during exposure therapy sessions will be associated with PTSD 84 
symptom reductions following treatment.  85 
4.  MILITARY RELEVANCE  86 
As compared to civilians, t he rate of PTSD is particularly elevated among military populations, with approximately 23% of 87 
military vs. 6 -8% of civilians meeting criteria for PTSD.5 PTSD has been identified as the signature  deployment -related 88 
psychiatric condition among service members. The functional impact of PTSD can cost service members their military 89 
careers and veterans with PTSD are at increased risk of unemployment and homelessness following military separation.6 90 
Notwithstanding evidence that PE is an effective treatment for PTSD, there remains room for improvement in outcomes 91 
given that a large proportion of patients (~50%) fail to significantly benefit from treatment.7 This issue is especially 92 
problematic among military populations who generally demonstrate poorer treatment gains from first -line psychotherapies 93 
for PTSD including PE.8,9 Given that almost three million U.S. military service members have deployed to Afghanistan, 94 
Iraq, and surrounding locations in support of military combat operations since September 11, 2001, the need for effective 95 
treatment for PTSD is critical.  Research dedicated to target mechanisms associated with PTSD symptomatology has the 96

improved functioning in civilians and military veterans.  98 
5. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  99 
PTSD Prevalence and Impact. PTSD is a chronic and debilitating condition triggered by exposure to a traumatic event. 100 
Symptoms of PTSD can include anxiety, negative mood, sleep disruption, nightmares, and negative, uncontrollable 101 
thoughts about the event. When left untreated, it can lead to detriments in mental health and psychosocial functioning.10,11 102 
The overall impact of PTSD is substantial and often leads to significant burdens on the individual, their family, and the 103 
community.12 The sequalae of PTSD not only impacts an individual’s immediate environment but also places significant 104 
burden on society due to increased work sick days and greater healthcare utilization.6,11 The rate of PTSD is particularly 105 
elevated among military populations, with approximately 23% of military meeting criteria for PTSD annually.5 PTSD has 106 
been identified as the  signature  deployment -related psychiatric condition among service members. The functional impact 107 
of PTSD can cost service members their military careers and veterans with PTSD are at increased risk of unemployment 108 
and homelessness following military separation. Given that almost three million U.S. military service members have 109 
deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq, and surrounding locations in support of military combat operations since September 11, 110 
2001, the need for effective treatment for PTSD is critical.  111 
Behavioral Therapy Approaches to PTSD Treatment . Evidence -based treatments for PTSD exist and are well - 112 
established.13 PE is a type of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and one of the most widely used first -line interventions 113 
for PTSD. PE has been validated across various populations and trauma types.e.g.,14–16 Preliminary evidence suggests that 114 
PE can even be effectively delivered in deployed settings, potentially helping service members return to duty without 115 
being aeromedically evacuated out of theater.17 PE aims to reduce trauma -related distress and PTSD symptomatology 116 
through extinction learning interventions (i.e., repeated exposure) to internal (e.g., trauma memory) and external (e.g., 117 
environmental stimuli) trauma cues under objectively safe conditions. Notwithstanding evidence that PE is an effective 118 
treatment for PTSD, there remains room for improvement in outcomes given that a large proportion of patients (~50%) fail 119 
to significantly benefit from treatment.7 This issue is especially problematic among military populations who generally 120 
demonstrate poorer treatment gains from first -line psychotherapies for PTSD including PE.9 Based on the rising number of 121 
service members returning from combat deployments to Afghanistan, Iraq, and surrounding areas, there is a high priority 122 
need for the most effective treatments for PTSD. Research dedicated to target mechanisms associated with PTSD 123 
symptomatology has the potential to promote greater PTSD treatment efficacy that will lead to greater symptom 124 
reductions, positive well -being, and improved functioning in civilians and military veterans.  125 
Medication Approaches to PTSD Treatment. Despite the benefits of first -line CBT interventions for PTSD treatment, 126 
pharmacotherapy remains the most commonly used approach to treat PTSD in civilians and military veterans.18 The only 127 
pharmacological interventions for PTSD approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are the selective serotonin 128 
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine and sertraline. Although approved by the FDA for PTSD treatment, these drugs 129 
have relatively modest benefits to reduce PTSD and often fail to help patients reach PTSD remission.19,20 Based upon 130 
expert panel psychological trauma recommendation guidelines21, no medication treatments have been determined to be a 131 
first-line option for treatment of PTSD. Unfortunately, this state of pharmacotherapy for PTSD has prompted many 132 
providers to use polypharmacy in which patients are prescribed a combination of medications with little to no empirical 133 
guidance on either the benefits or adverse reactions.22 134 
Endocannabinoid System and PTSD. One potential reason for the low efficacy of SSRIs and the use of 135 
polypharmacotherapy is that these medications do not directly target PTSD symptomatology. A rapidly growing body of 136 
evidence has highlighted the endocannabinoid (eCB) system as a critical regulator of the stress response.23 Further, it has 137 
been suggested that psychological trauma can lead to long -term alterations in the eCB system.24 The eCB system is a 138 
neuromodulatory system comprised of two primary receptors (CB1 and CB2), two main neurotransmitters (anandamide 139 
[AEA] and 2 -arachidonylglycerol [2 -AG]), and several enzymes that synthesize and degrade these neurotransmitters.25 140 
Most research has focused on CB1 receptors, which are primarily located in the central nervous system and have the 141 
highest densities in brain regions associated with anxiety and fear learning (e.g., cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus). 142 
Preclinical animal models have shown that CB1 antagonists increase anxiety, while agonists produce anxiolytic effects.26 143 
AEA and 2 -AG are the two primary endogenous eCBs that act as agonists at CB1 receptors.27,28 These eCBs are critical 144 
nerve signaling chemicals shown to regulate mood, memory, perception, and sleep.29. Overall, novel pharmacological 145 
approaches targeting the eCB system have promising potential to improve anxiety, mood, and sleep problems, while 146 
facilitating extinction learning, all of which characterize PTSD symptoms and seem particularly important to compliment 147 
first-line psychotherapy interventions.  148 
Cannabidiol for Augmentation of PE Treatment for PTSD. Based on growing evidence on the synergistic relationship 149 
between the eCB system and PTSD, increasing efforts have been devoted to pharmacotherapy options. The recently 150 
FDA-approved prescription medication, Epidiolex (Cannabidiol [CBD]) is a cannabis -derived, non -controlled drug that may 151

21 be beneficial for PTSD. Existing research has shown that CBD may facilitate extinction learning, decrease anxiety, and 152 
improve mood and sleep, all of which might enhance the effectiveness of mPE for PTSD.30,31 Furthermore, CBD is well 153 
tolerated, even in large doses, and has not been shown to produce adverse side effects associated with other cannabis - 154 
derived medications (e.g., dependence, withdrawal, psychoactive effects, increased anxiety, memory and concentration 155 
difficulties, slowed reaction time, coordination problems, and elevated heart rate). Thus, CBD may be able to maximize 156 
the positive benefits associated with the eCB system, while mitigating adverse events that occur with other cannabis - 157 
derived drugs.  158 
Most of the existing literature indicating the benefits of CBD for PTSD treatment has involved preclinical animal studies, 159 
case studies, and a few proof -of-concept trials with healthy humans. Preclinical animal models have used a fear -based 160 
conditioning paradigme.g.,32 designed to parallel the impact of trauma in humans with PTSD to investigate the effects of 161 
CBD. Animal models have shown that CBD can reduce cardiovascular and anxiogenic effects of stress.30,31 CBD has 162 
been found to decrease retrieval and acquisition of fear memories33,34 and even block reconsolidation of the trauma 163 
memory in animal models.30 The most promising outcome of preclinical PTSD research is evidence that CBD can facilitate 164 
and enhance the extinction learning process, a key component of exposure -based psychotherapies for PTSD.35,36 165 
Consistent with preclinical animal research, Das et al.37 found that CBD facilitated extinction learning and decreased cue - 166 
based fear response in a sample of healthy humans.  167 
Only a few studies have been completed in humans. A case report found that daily use of CBD was associated with 168 
reduced anxiety and improved sleep in a child with treatment resistant PTSD despite the fact that standard 169 
pharmacotherapy for PTSD had produced only limited and acute symptom relief.38 In a retrospective case series analysis 170 
of adults (N=11) with PTSD, participants received oral CBD in combination with routine psychiatric and psychotherapy 171 
care over 8 weeks.2 Results suggested that CBD was associated with a 28% decrease in PTSD symptom and was well 172 
tolerated (with no discontinuation due to side effects) among participants. Though these findings suggest that CBD may 173 
be used for the treatment of PTSD, there is a paucity of research on the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of CBD as a 174 
treatment for PTSD in human trials.  175 
Furthermore, although preliminary evidence suggests CBD may benefit PTSD symptom reduction, the specific 176 
mechanisms of action of CBD on the eCB remains unclear. One possible mechanism may include modulation of the eCB 177 
system since research has shown that CBD may have low affinity for CB receptors, but nonetheless is able to bind to 178 
CB1.39 CBD may also act as an antagonist to other agonists due to effects at different prejunctional sites and indirect 179 
interactions with non -cannabinoid receptors.40 In turn, this may explain possible effects on eCB metabolism including 180 
inhibition of the uptake and degradation of critical eCBs associated with stress response including AEA and 2 -AG. 181 
Innovation.  Additional research is warranted to fully understand the benefits of CBD for PTSD. Currently, there are no 182 
published clinical trials investigating the efficacy of CBD in reducing PTSD and existing PTSD literature in humans only 183 
includes healthy individuals or case study data. Research on cannabinoids and PTSD remains in the early stages of 184 
development and more research is needed to understand how CBD modulates the eCB system. Based on existing 185 
research, the next logical step is to investigate CBD as an augmentation treatment for an established psychotherapy that 186 
targets extinction learning mechanisms for PTSD symptom reduction. This proposal will examine CBD as an adjunct for 187 
mPE and explore potential biological mechanisms for its effect, making it the first study of its kind. Findings from this stu dy 188 
have the potential to improve outcomes among military and civilians with PTSD and mitigate the personal, social, and 189 
economic costs of this debilitating, chronic condition. This study will also expand understanding of the relationship 190 
between PTSD, CBD, and the eCB system.  191 
6.  RESEARCH DESIGN  192 
This study is an early Phase II double -blind, pilot randomized controlled clinical trial. We will use a permuted block 193 
randomization design stratified by  PTSD severity median score  of 51  on the PCL-5 and population type (military or 194 
civilian). The median score stratification was derived from a recently completed  STRONG STAR randomized clinical trial 195 
of military veterans seeking treatment for PTSD  (manuscript in press) . The decision to stratify by population was based on 196 
existing literature that has found differences in treatment response between military and civilian samples (e.g., Steenkamp 197 
et al., 2015; Straud et al., 2019).  Participants will be 24 individuals  with PTSD to investigate the safety, feasibility, and 198 
PTSD symptom change  associated with CBD 250mg  taken twice a day for 18days (n=12) vs. placebo (n=12) in 199 
combination with a standard of care, 10 -session s mPE psychotherapy  administered over 2 weeks . Aims 2 and 3 will 200 
evaluate biochemical and physiological outcomes associated with eCB and PTSD that may be affected by CBD. 201 
Permuted block randomization is advantageous in small clinical trials to ensure equal allocation of participants in each 202 
condition. Participant randomization will be subdivided into randomized blocks of four, two patients in each block will be 203 
assigned to CBD and two will be assigned to placebo . Randomization will occur after the participant consents to the study 204 
and eligibility is determined. John Roache, PhD (Co -Mentor on this KL2) will determine randomization codes and 205 
coordinate with the compounding pharmacy (Oakdell Pharmacy) providing the medication and placebo for this trial to 206

7.1.3. Description of the Recruitment and Prescreening Process .  265 
Potential participants will be between 18 -65 years old recruited from recruitment events, flyers  and provider referrals from 266 
the community,   Providers can give their patients contact information for the study staff so that interested individuals may 267 
contact STRONG STAR directly. Alternatively, providers can obtain consent to contact from their patients that allows the 268 
study staff to contact the potential participant directly.  Individuals who are not eligible or interested in other IRB -approved 269 
STRONG STAR protocols will be told about this study. Study information will be posted on the STRONG STAR website 270 
and social media  to gain self -referrals for treatment -seeking patients.  Under an IRB approved HIPAA Waiver of 271 
Authorization, study personnel will initially conduct a brief telephone interview where the basic study inclusion /exclusion  272 
criteria will be reviewed to help determine if the individual likely meets study criteria. This will mitigate unnecessary tra vel 273 
and more in -depth screening. Participants who appear eligible after telephone pre -screening will be invited into the 274 
STRONG STAR clinic to provide written informed consent and undergo more rigorous assessment for study eligibility.  275 
 276 
7.1.4. Consent Process.  277 
During the consent appointment, potential participants will have the study explained to them in a private location in-person 278 
at the UT Health San Antonio (UTHSA) STRONG STAR offices located at 7550 IH10 West, Suite 1325, San Antonio, TX 279 
78229. The potential participant will be given a copy of the informed consent document (ICD) to read.  After the potential 280 
participant has read the ICD, and a member of the study team has reviewed the risks and benefits of the study to ensure 281 
the participant understands the research, the participant will be given the opportunity to discuss the research with family 282 
and friends.  The research team will be available to answer any questions about the research.  Once the potential 283 
participant has reached a decision, the participant will sign the consent form.  A copy of the signed ICD will be given to the 284 
participant.  285 
7.1.5. Subject Screening Procedures  286 
Following consent, screening assessment will take place to determine participant eligibility. The entire screening process 
will take approximately 4 hours. This will include the completion of the questionnaires , interviews , and screening tests  
outlined in the Table of Assessments below (see section 7.3).  The baseline assessment may occur in -person using paper 
forms,  or the participant will be logged into the STRONG STAR eCAP online data capture system to complete self -report 
questionnaires. For individuals not meeting study inclusion criteria, the study staff will assist coordinating appropriate care 
outside of the study.

21 If the participant has been referred from another STRONG STAR study and already undergone baseline testing within the 
past 30 days, the participant will be asked as part of the consent process to use these assessments rather than repeating 
the assessment b attery.  If the participant is newly referred to this study, if it has been more than 30 days since baseline 
testing for another study, or the participant declines use of previously completed assessments, he or she will meet with an 
evaluator and complete the full baseline assessment per protocol.

7.2 Study Drug Overview  305 
 306 
7.2.1 Epidiolex  will be the active intervention used in this study. Epidiolex is an FDA approved non -controlled prescription 307 
medication indicated for the treatment of seizure disorders. Prior research has demonstrated the safety and early positive 308 
benefits of off -label use of Epidiolex for Anxiety and Trauma -Related symptoms in humans.  309 
• Complete names and composition of drugs :  310 
o Epidiolex  is a clear , colorless yellow oral solution containing cannabidiol at a concentration of 100 mg/mL. 311 
Cannabidiol is the active ingredient in Epidiolex and naturally occurs in the Cannabis sativa  L. plant. 312 
Cannabidiol is a  natural cannabinoid  designated chemically as 2 -[(1R,6R) -3-Methyl -6-(1-methylethenyl) - 313

administered using an oral syringe.  328 
• Plan for disposition of unused study product(s) : Any unused study products will be disposed of in accordance with 329 
the STRONG STAR Drug Accountability and Storage SOP.  330 
• FDA status : The FDA has approved the use of Epidiolex for seizure disorders. Prior research has demonstrated 331 
the safety and early positive benefits of off -label use of Epidiolex for Anxiety and Trauma -Related symptoms in 332 
humans. We are not seeking a new indication with this research project.  333 
 334 
7.3. Research Interventions/Study Procedures.  335 
Interventions.  336 
Participants will be randomized to either Epidiolex (CBD) or placebo. All participants will receive 10 sessions of mPE  337 
administered weekdays over 2 weeks .  338 
 339 
Epidiolex (CBD)  is an FDA approved, non -controlled prescription medication indicated for the treatment of seizure 340 
disorders. Prior research has demonstrated the safety and early positive benefits of off -label use of CBD for Anxiety and 341 
Trauma -Related symptoms in humans. CBD comes in a 100 -mL bottle containing 100 mg of CBD per ml of strawberry - 342 
flavored liquid solution that is taken using an oral syringe. Strawberry -flavored liquid solution is also available for Oakdell 343 
pharmacy to create a comparable placebo to maintain the blind. Starting recommended dose is 2.5 mL (250mg) taken 344 
twice daily (total = 5 mL/500mg) in the morning and evening after meals.1 We will employ this dosing recommendation for 345 
this study for 18 consecutive days. Steady state has been shown to occur in 2 days.41 To ensure maintenance on an 346 
adequate steady state dose for all randomized participants, we will begin medication 3 days prior to the start of mPE. CBD 347 
and matching placebo for this study will be obtained through Oakdell Pharmacy which will obtain a sufficient supply of 348 
CBD for 12 participants from their supplying manufacturer. They will then prepare CBD (n = 12) and matching placebo (n 349 
=12) dosage for 24 participants in blinded containers that will be numbered per the randomization design. The medication 350 
and placebo will be dispensed to a trained study team member and transported in a locked container to the STRONG 351 
STAR Clinic where it will be stored in a locked cabinet until the participant arrives to receive the medication at the 352 
medication review appointment 3 days prior to beginning mPE.  353 
 354 
Massed Prolonged  Exposure (mPE) . Prolonged Exposure (PE) is a first -line, empirically supported cognitive behavioral 355 
treatment for PTSD and serves as the foundation for mPE.16 mPE, delivered daily Monday through Friday over two 356 
weeks, utilizes exposure -based interventions to target psychological mechanisms (i.e., experiential and behavioral 357 
avoidance; maladaptive cognitive changes) that are thought to maintain trauma -related symptoms. Ten 90 -minute 358 
sessions of mPE, which has been found to be non -inferior to ten 90 -minute spaced PE delivered once or twice a week 359 
over eight weeks, helps minimize military -specific treatment barriers, and decreases treatment dropout rates.14 For this 360 
study, each participant will receive ten 90 -minute mPE daily over two weeks. Up to 1 9 days following initiation of the 361 
medication regimen will be allowed to complete the ten sessions of mPE to accommodate scheduling constraints.  362 
Consistent with the standard spaced PE therapy manual, mPE includes four primary treatment components: (1) 363 
psychoeducation on common reactions to trauma; (2) relaxation training; (3) in vivo exposure; and (4) imaginal exposures. 364 
In vivo exposure involves approaching avoided situations, people, places, and/or objects that are realistically safe.  With 365 
imaginal exposure, participants repeatedly and systematically revisit their trauma memory and related thoughts and 366 
feelings. Participants also will be asked to complete homework, including reviewing treatment materials, listening to 367 
recordings of their imaginal exposure, and completing in vivo exposures. Since mPE requires considerable time and 368 
effort, the study team will work with the participant to receive a release from work while participating in the treatment.  369

7.3.1  Collection and Storage of Human Biological Specimens .  373 
Urine drug and pregnancy screen tests will be conducted at baseline for screening eligibility purposes.  374 
 375 
Blood will be collected at four time points  for a study total of about 28mLs . Approximately, 7mL of blood will be collected 376 
by venous puncture using a 7 mL EDTA blood collection tube immediately prior to the pretreatment medication review, 377 
and at interim assessments 1 (prior to PE session 1), 2 (prior to PE session 5), and 3 ( prior to PE session 10 ). Blood will 378 
be immediately chilled in a cooler filled with ice.  379 
 380 
Saliva will also be collected at four time points  via passive drool. At the medication review appointment p articipants will be 381 
given a kit with salivette test tubes  and instructions on how  to collect early waking saliva samples (cortisol) upon waking . 382 
Saliva collections will be completed upon waking  the day after the medication review appointment,  and the day of  383 
session s 1, 6, and 10 . Participants will be instructed to immediately refrigerate the sample and bring it to the next 384 
scheduled appointment. Saliva samples will be  collected from the participant by study staff when the participant arrives for 385 
their appointment  and immediately chilled in a cooler filled with ice . Samples will be frozen at or below -20oC upon arrival 386 
at the Biological Psychiatry Analytic Laboratory (BPAL).  387 
 388 
Biological specimens will be coded when collected from the participant by the study staff with a digital bar code that can 389 
be linked to the study and subject only by key -codes maintained by the STRONG STAR Data and Statistics Services.  390 
 391 
Heart rate will be monitored using a wearable device placed on the right wrist, and elevations will be recorded 392 
continuously during sessions 3, 6, and 10 to obtain an objective measure of arousal to assess possible within - and 393 
between - session extinction learning in response to rehearsal of the individual’s primary traumatic event. This data can be 394 
beneficial for individuals who report subjectively being more aroused during the exposure or behaviorally appear to be 395 
more activated.  396 
 397 
All biospecimen samples will be transported to the BPAL in the UTHSA Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral 398 
Sciences at the UT Health -Long School of Medicine in room 727F for processing and storage. This location is monitored 399 
24-7 by a wireless monitoring system on the Isensix system.  400

7.3.1.1 Laboratory evaluations and special precautions:  402 
All biospecimen collection procedures will be carried out by trained team members and appropriately transported, stored, 403 
and disposed of in accordance with STRONG STAR Biomarkers and Genomics Services SOP, International Air Transport 404 
Association (IATA), and UTHSA IRB guidelines.  All samples will be labeled with coded subject numbers and dates to 405 
protect the identities of participants.  406 
 407 
At the times designated in Section 7.3 Table, 7mL of venous blood will be drawn into one purple top  tube for 408 
measurement of AEA, 2 -AG, and CBD levels.  Immediately upon collection, blood will be labeled, mixed , and chilled on 409 
ice. This blood will be transported to the BPAL as soon as possible, where it will be processed to separate out the plasma. 410 
Plasma will be aliquotted into two cryovials, labeled, and placed in the STRONG STAR -CAP biorepository for long -term 411 
storage at -800 C.  Samples will be later analyzed in batches using HPLC/Tandem Mass Spectrometry.  412 
 413 
On the days designated in Section 7.3 Table, saliva samples will be collected by participants immediately upon awakening 414 
in the morning.  Samples are collected by passive drool saliva collection into saliva sample tubes labeled only by coded 415 
subject number and Day number.  Participants will be instructed to refrigerate the sample upon collection and to bring the 416 
salivette to their next scheduled appointment. Saliva samples will be collected from the participant by study staff when the 417 
participant arrives for their appointment and immediately chilled in a cooler filled with ice and then brought to the BPAL for 418 
storage at -200 C as soon as possible. Subjects will bring these samples to their visit appointment and staff will receive 419 
them and transport them to the BPAL for long -term storage until later analysis for cortisol levels.  420 
 421

assessments can be found at the end of this protocol.  Assessments will be administered in person whenever possible.  430 
However, to accommodate participant schedules and/or instances in which a participant does not reside in the local area 431 
at the time of a follow -up assessment, we may collect full or partial assessments in person or via phone, video 432 
conferencing, and/or electronic data capture using a secure link to the encrypted STRONG STAR database.  Reasonable 433 
efforts will be made to collect all data as described in this protocol, but we expect some participants may not be able to 434 
complete part or all of any given follow up assessment.  435 
  436 
7.3.2.2 Data Storage, Access,  and Protection.  437 
Study files containing hard copies of data collected during study participation will be kept securely at the STRONG STAR 438 
offices in San Antonio. Files will be placed into locked cabinets and stored securely in a locked room by a STRONG STAR 439 
staff member.  440 
 441 
Data will be coded using an assigned number. Local study sites will maintain a list of assignment numbers for the purpose 442 
of linking subsequent research materials.  443 
 444 
Data will be entered into the STRONG STAR password protected database housed on a secure UTHSA server by 445 
member of the research team. Electronic data will be stored, managed, and analyzed by the STRONG STAR Data and 446 
Statistics Services staff of the STRONG STAR consortium. The overall PI and named collaborators will have access to 447

7.4.2. Primary (i.e., primary outcome variables) and secondary endpoints  479 
Health Questionnaire and Self -Report Measures : The primary aim of this pilot is to explore the potential feasibility, 480 
safety, and effect of CBD in reducing PTSD symptoms compared to placebo in retired service members receiving mPE. 481 
Therefore, the primary outcome variables will be  the CAPS -5 total score, the PCL -5 total score , and adverse event 482 
monitoring. Secondary endpoints are listed in the table in Section 7.3 and include associated psychopathology, such as 483 
severity scores on measures of depression, general anxiety, disability, and PTSD -related cognitions.  484 
Biospecimens & Heart Rate Monitoring Measures : We will also assess possible biochemical and physiological 485 
outcomes associated with treatment (Aim 2) and evaluate the relationship between changes in biochemical/physiological 486 
measures with PTSD symptom reductions (Aim 3). To address these aims we will collect blood and saliva samples and 487 
heart monitoring data via a wearable device as described in 7.3.1  488 
7.4.3.  Data analysis.   489 
This pilot study was not powered for formal efficacy or mechanistic hypotheses testing.42 Our primary interests are to evaluate 490 
the safety and feasibility of the proposed recruitment, assessment, and treatment protocols; and to detect a signal of possib le 491 
PTSD symptom reductions associated with CBD in preparation for a larger trial. To inform future studies, we will calculate 492 
conventional effect sizes with 95% confidence interval limits. Hedges’ g will be used to calculate continuous outcome effect 493 
sizes (e.g., CAPS -5, PCL -5). Hedges’ g has been recommended over Cohen’s d for small samples based on sample size 494 
adjustments yet can be interpreted using the same conventional recommendations as Cohen’s d.43  495 
Although the statistical power of this study is limited, we will perform statistical analyses appropriate for an adequately 496 
powered study to identify data analysis issues germane to future planning (e.g., data management and scoring, missing 497 
data, data distributions, outliers, trends over time, covariance structures). Statistical analyses will be intent to treat. W e will 498 
complete descriptive statistics to describe the study sample and address the feasibility and safety hypotheses. Continuous 499 
outcome measures related to symptom changes and comparison of baseline and posttreatment means will be done with 500 
general or generalized linear mixed effects regression models with repeated measures, with fixed effects of time, group, 501 
and the group by time interaction. Measures with data collected during treatment will also be included in models. Little’s44 502 
missing completely at random analysis will be completed to confirm likelihood -based model assumptions. Pearson 503 
correlation analyses will be used to examine associations between change in PTSD symptoms, biochemical markers, and 504

 507 
7.5. Confidentiality.  508 
PE sessions, interview assessments, and blood draws will be delivered in private offices at the STRONG STAR Clinic at the 509 
UTHSA. When travel to the STRONG STAR clinic is not feasible, Interview Assessments and PE sessions via video 510 
teleconferencing will be made available to mitigate missed appointments. Data will be stored by an assigned participant code 511 
number so that data records can be viewed by password -authenticated, authorized investigators and Consortium personnel. 512 
Every member of the research study team will be trained and monitored on how to handle and protect both medical and 513 
research records. Only authorized study staff, and members of the STRONG STAR Data and Statistics Services staff will 514 
have access to either the raw data or electronic study data.  515 
7.6. Long Term Data Storage.  516 
A STRONG STAR Repository has been approved by the UTHSA (HSC20100475H) IRB to enable the STRONG STAR 517 
Consortium to store specimens and data for future use. The STRONG STAR Repository  is a large comprehensive 518 
database of information, biological specimens and neuroimages related to the identification, assessment, and treatment of 519 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), insomnia, pain, and related behavioral health conditions. All information entered 520 
into the STRONG STAR Repository  will be extracted from primary datasets collected as part of IRB -approved studies, 521 
including this study, being conducted and /or supported in collaboration with the UTHSA STRONG STAR Consortium.  522 
Study databases are established and maintained by the STRONG STAR Data and Statistics Services.  A unique, 523 
sequential alpha -numeric STRONG STAR ID will be assigned to each participant at the time of recruitment into this study. 524 
However, all Repository data will be identified with a different code number that can be cross linked to the original study 525 
code only through records maintained by the STRONG STAR Data and Statistics Services.  At the conclusion of this 526 
study, participants who signed the consent to have their data placed in the STRONG STAR Repository  will be maintained 527 
under the UTHSA IRB -approved Repository protocol.  For participants who decline participation in the STRONG STAR 528 
Repository , their data will be de -identified,  and the data maintained in the Repository without identifiers at the conclusion 529 
of the study.  530 
 531 
8.0. RISKS/BENEFITS ASSESSMENT  532 
 533 
8.1. Risks.  534 
 535 
Likely, but Not Serious Risks : 536 
 537 
Epidiolex (CBD) : CBD is well tolerated in human subjects and is considered a safe drug, with minimal adverse events 538 
(AEs) and low abuse potential.1,41,45 –47 However, like almost all medications, toxicity and AEs are possible with CBD. The 539 
most common side effects of CBD can include fatigue, drowsiness, feeling weak, malaise, loss of appetite, diarrhea, skin 540 
rash, insomnia, and viral/fungal infections.  541 
 542 
PTSD & Prolonged Exposure (PE) : Potential risks associated with PTSD assessment and PE therapy can include 543 
temporary increase in distress, becoming emotionally upset or experiencing an initial increase of PTSD symptoms due to 544 
the consideration of traumatic events. Studies with PE suggest that a small minority experience an increase in symptoms 545 
of PTSD after the initiation of imaginal exposure and for this minority, the distress and increased symptoms are 546 
temporary, are not predictive of poor outcome, and are not associated with increased likelihood of dropout.46 547 
 548 
Biospecimen Collection : Potential risks associated with blood draw may include pain, bruising, infection, lightheadedness, 549 
fainting, blood clots, and bleeding or other discomforts at the blood draw site.  550 
 551 
Rare, but Serious Risks : 552 
CBD : Serious side effects of CBD are very rare but can occur. Serious side effects include liver problems, sedation (e.g., 553 
sleepiness, loss of coordination, and difficulty with concentration), severe allergic reaction (skin rash, itchiness, flushed  554 
skin, angioedema, difficulty breathing), and in very rare circumstances ( < 1%) suicidal thoughts or behavior.1 555 
 556 
Biospecimen Collection : More rare risks of blood draw may include swelling and/or infection at the needle site, and 557 
thrombosis of the vein due to trauma. Proper training of study team members on biospecimen collection safety 558 
procedures can reduce the risk of contamination, clerical error, infection, injury, misuse of appropriate blood -sampling 559 
devices, and risk when transporting laboratory samples.   560

of 21 Risks to Confidentiality  562 
With the handling of medical and research records there is always the possibility of a breach of confidentiality. We will 563 
maintain patients’ names, contact information (i.e. Identifiers), and all PHI (protected health information) in an encrypted 564 
computer database and all PHI identifiers will be removed in the database during data analysis. Every member of the 565 
Research Team is carefully trained and monitored about how to store, handle, and protect participant records.  566 
 567 
Risks of PTSD Diagnosis regardless of Treatment:  568 
Possibility of increased suicidal risk. One of the risks of PTSD both in and out of treatment is attempted suicide, which can  569 
result in death.  570 
 571 
Safeguards for Protecting Participants:  572 
CBD : Participants will be required to complete  a liver function test ( LFT) or provide a copy of recent LFT lab results 573 
(completed within the last 90 days) to the study team prior to randomization to be considered for study eligibility. To 574 
mitigate unnecessary LFTs, candidates will complete the full assessment to determine eligibility. If the candidate is 575 
deemed eligible, the final step of the assessment process will be to complete an LFT or provide a copy of a recent (LFT).  576 
The study team will work with the candidate to obtain LFTs and pay for them if necessary.  All LFT labs will be reviewed 577 
by Dr. King to determine study eligibility. Participants with enzyme levels 3x the normal limit will be excluded from the 578 
study.  579 
 580 
CBD, like most drugs, can lead to AEs and has drug -drug interactions. To safeguard against potential risk,  we have 581 
developed e xclusionary criteria related to the individual’s medical history and concomitant medication  regimen . 582 
Participants prescribed medications listed in the exclusion criteria  will be excluded . Exceptions will be made for 583 
participants taking the antidepressants Trazodone and Mirtazapine , a benzodiazepine just as needed, and/or stable  doses 584 
of the platelet inhibitors Clopidogrel or Warfarin .  These participants will be monitored for AEs on a more frequent basis 585 
(daily at each session). Additionally, consultation between the study team and Dr. King may occur on a more regular basis 586 
regarding potential medication/health risk and additional risk management procedures.  Individuals on medications with 587 
known drug -drug interactions may also complete an additional LFT during study participation.  588 
 589 
All participants will complete the STRONG STAR Health Questionnaire and the Prior and Concomitant Medications 590 
Interview at the baseline assessment. These measures assess  medical and psychiatric diagnoses, current prescription 591 
and over the counter medication use, and caffeine use. Prior to enrollment in the study, Van King , MD (physician 592 
collaborator) and Casey Straud, PsyD (principal investigator) will review participants’ Health Questionnaire  and 593 
Medication Interview  to determine potential for risk and confirm eligibility based on self -reported health history, current 594 
prescribed medications, and current substance use.  595 
 596 
For participants identified as having low to moderate risk of AE or drug -drug interaction, the patient will be maintained on 597 
protocol and additional risk management procedures will be implemented within the context of the study treatment . All 598 
enrolled participants will be monitored for AEs by the study therapist on Day 1 (beginning of mPE), Day 5 -Interim 599 
Assessment, Day 10 -Interim Assessment, and at the 1 -month follow -up. For participants identified as being at high risk for 600 
a health/medication -related AE or drug -drug interaction, ineligibility will be considered if it is unlikely that standard 601 
treatment plus additional risk management procedures (i. e., adverse event monitoring at every visit) will maintain safety. 602 
Dr. King, Casey Straud, PsyD (PI), and study team members will meet each week to review reported AEs. AE meetings 603 
will involve consultation with Dr. King on potential medication/health risk and additional risk management procedures as 604 
described above. For urgent issues, whether potentially related to CBD or mPE, participants will be instructed to get help 605 
immediately by going to the nearest emergency room.   606 
 607 
All participants will also be given a medication emergency department wallet card at the beginning of the study . 608 
Participants will be instructed to keep this card on their person throughout the study. The wallet card briefly describes the  609 
study intervention (Epidiolex vs. Placebo) and drug dose (250mg b.i.d), and provides a study team contact number.  610 
 611 
 612 
PTSD & PE : Psychological distress experienced by participants is expected to be temporary and participants will be 613 
provided immediate coping tools and techniques to manage distressing emotions by the study therapist.  Any indication 614 
that the participant is considering suicide , endorses active psychosis/mania, or other harm to self/others  will be handled 615 
using evidence -based procedures and policies developed by the STRONG STAR Consortium. Participants who endorse 616 
mania/psychotic symptoms will prompt a clinical interview with a licensed clinical provider to assess current risk and risk 617 
of active mania/psychosis during study participation. Individuals with active mania/psychosis will be excluded from study 618 
participation.  Trained clinicians and evaluators will assess history of suicide and current suicidal ideation using the 619

of 21 Suicidal Ideation Thoughts and Behaviors Interview at the baseline assessment.  For participants identified as having low 620 
to moderate risk for suicide based on the assessment results, the patient will be maintained on protocol and additional risk 621 
management procedures will be implemented within the context of the study treatment. For participants identified as being 622 
at high risk for suicide based on the assessment results, disenrollment will be considered if it is unlikely that standard 623 
treatment plus additional risk management procedures will maintain safety.  High risk participants who are disenrolled 624 
from the study will be referred for more intensive treatment (outpatient or inpatient).  625 
 626 
If the research team feels that hospitalization should be considered, the participant’s primary care provider or unit will be  627 
contacted to escort the individual to the ED.  If a participant reports experiencing psychotic or mania symptoms, or reports 628 
dangerous amounts of alcohol and/or substance use, additional assessment by a licensed provider for consideration of 629 
referral for clinical care and for disenrolling participants from the study will be conducted.   630 
 631 
Enrolled participants will be monitored for AEs by the study therapist at Interim Assessment 1 ( PE Session  1), Interim 632 
Assessment  2 (PE Session 5) , Interim Assessment  3 (PE Session 10) , and at the 1 -month follow -up. Dr. Straud and study 633 
team members will meet each week to review reported AEs and to consult on potential behavior health risks. For urgent 634 
issues, whether potentially related to psychotherapy or CBD, participants will be instructed to get help immediately by 635 
going to the nearest emergency room.  636 
 637 
Biospecimen Collection : To reduce the risk of AEs for study participants, all staff members collecting biospecimens will be 638 
trained in procedures to reduce the risk of contamination, clerical error, infection, injury, use of appropriate blood -sampling 639 
devices, and safe transportation of laboratory samples via IATA guidelines. When collecting or handling biospecimens, 640 
staff members will wear well -fitting, non -sterile gloves, and carry out hand hygiene before and after each patient 641 
procedure, before putting on gloves and after removing them. To reduce the risk of environmental contamination with 642 
pathogens, the blood draw room will be appropriately sanitized before and after each blood draw and saliva collection. To 643 
prevent infections and other AEs, health workers should follow the guidelines on patient identification, hand hygiene, use 644 
of gloves, skin disinfection, use of appropriate blood -sampling devices and safe transportation of laboratory samples.  645 
 646 
8.2 Potential Benefits.    647 
Potential benefits of participation in this study may include a reduction in, or amelioration of, PTSD symptoms over the 648 
course of therapy.  Collectively, the possible risks (i.e., temporary increase in distress and severity) associated with 649 
participation are low and reasonable within this context given the level of participant monitoring and access to research 650 
and clinical staff. We believe that the possible benefits from participating in this study significantly outweigh the possibl e 651 
risks. The knowledge gained from this study will serve to inform the most effective early interventions for the prevention 652 
and treatment of PTSD.  653 
 654 
8.3 Alternatives.  655 
Other choices to participating in this study include: not participating in this study; receiving psychotherapy or medications  656 
in the community; or participation in other research studies involving experimental treatments.  657 
 658 
9.0  ADVERSE EVENTS, UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS, AND DEVIATIONS  659 
9.1. Adverse Events will be assessed and monitored according to the established STRONG STAR SOP and the IRB of 660 
record’s policies and procedures.  661 
9.2. Reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others,  Serious Adverse Events and Deaths to 662 
the IRB Office.  All adverse events, unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others, and deviations will be 663 
reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) in accordance with current IRB policy. UPIRSOs and recurrent non - 664 
compliance with study procedures will be reported promptly to the IRB.  All adverse events that do not meet the UPIRSO 665 
criteria and deviations that are not non -compliance will be summarized at Continuing Review per the IRB of record’s policy.  666 
10.0. WITHDRAWAL FROM STUDY PARTICIPATION . 667 
Participation in the study may be discontinued by the principal investigator if continued participation is considered a 668 
danger to a participant’s welfare. Reasons for discontinuation include: 1) a serious AE such that continued participation 669 
would be a danger to the participant; 2) clinical worsening for any reason that is deemed to necessitate non -study 670 
psychological or medical treatment; 3) exacerbation of PTSD, anxiety, or depressive symptoms that the participant cannot 671 
tolerate; or 4) drug interactions from concomitant medications that the participant cannot tolerate or would be a danger to 672 
the participant;  or 5) discontinuation would be in the participant's best interest. Participants deemed candidates for 673 
discontinuation will be discussed in conference calls with relevant study team members and will be brought to the 674 
attention of the PI and mentor committee for final decision. Participants who are discontinued from the study for any 675

of 21 reason will be scheduled for a final evaluation within one week and given appropriate treatment referrals. If participants 676 
are discontinued due to a serious AE, they will continue to be followed clinically by the therapist and/or member of the 677 
research staff until the AE is resolved or becomes stable. The reason the participants are discontinued from the study will 678 
be documented for future study planning.  679 
11.0. TIME REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE RESEARCH (including data analysis) . 680 
The following table provides an overview of activities that the research team plans to accomplish. We anticipate recruiting 681 
and treating two eligible service members per month to meet study goals. We anticipate that the study will be completed 682

At the conclusion of the study all data will be stripped of identifiers. De -identified (anonymized) data will be maintained 687 
indefinitely in the STRONG STAR Repository. Informed consent documents will be stored securely for a minimum of three 688 
years following completion of the research in accordance with 45 CFR 46 . HIPAA authorizations will be stored for a minimum 689 
of six years in accordance with HIPAA regulations . A Final Report will be submitted to the IRB to request inactivation of the 690 
study.  691 
13. FUNDING . 692 
This project is funded through the Institute for Integration of Medicine and Science Clinical and Translational Research 693 
Scholars Mentored Research Career Development Program at UTHSA ( KL2 TR002646; PI: Casey Straud, PsyD).  694 
14.0 DESCRIPTION OF ASSESSMENTS . 695 
The majority of the measures listed below is commonly used, have adequate to good psychometrics, and are part of the 696 
Consortium common data elements (CDE). As outlined in the National Research Action Plan, evidence -based CDEs and 697 
measures for STRONG STAR studies will ensure comparability of results across the consortium as well as other clinical trials 698 
and epidemiological studies of PTSD.  699 
 700 
1. Demographics and Military Service Characteristics Form :  The Demographics Form measures standard demographics 701 
(race, gender, age) and military service information (e.g., rank).   This measure will be administered at the baseline 702 
assessment.  703 
 704 
2. Life Events Checklist -5 (LEC -5).48 The LEC includes a list of 24 potentially traumatic life events commonly associated with 705 
PTSD symptoms. The instrument was designed to facilitate the diagnosis of PTSD. In this study, the LEC -5 will also be 706 
used to identify the index event and focus of the PTSD treatment. For each potentially traumatic life event, respondents 707 
rate their experience of that event on a 5 -point nominal scale (1 = happened to me, 2 = witnessed it, 3 = learned about it, 708 
4 =part of my job, 5= not sure, and 6 = does not apply). Each nominal point will be scored separately, as either 0 (=not 709 
endorsed by participant) or 1 (=endorsed by participant). This measure will be administered at the baseline assessment.  710 
 711 
3. Deployment Risk and Resilience Inventory -2 (DRRI -2) Combat Experience and Post -battle -Scales .49,50 High- and low - 712 
intensity deployment stress exposure will be assessed using scales from the DRRI -2. The DRRI -2 is an update of the 713 
original DRRI, which was developed and tested in three separate national samples of veterans of the first Gulf War. It has 714 
been revised and tested with OEF/OIF/OND returnees. The DRRI -2 provides an update of the DRRI’s assessment of 715 
deployment -related factors to ensure the instrument’s applicability across a variety of deployment circumstances (e.g., 716 
different eras of service) and military subgroups (e.g., men and women), as well as to validate updated measures in a 717 
contemporary Veteran cohort. High intensity stressor exposures will be assessed using the DRRI Combat Experiences 718 
and Aftermath of Battle subscales. Responses to these scales are on a 6 -point Likert scale. The total score is the sum of 719 
the item scores, where higher scores signify greater exposure to combat or exposure to the consequences of combat, 720 
respectively. Both subscales have very good internal consistency (α = .90 to .92) and construct validity. This measure will 721 
be administered at the baseline assessment  and only among participants who identify as a military veteran . 722

4. Health Questionnaire.  The Health Questionnaire includes items regarding physical and mental health history, diagnoses, 725 
utilization of services, and military medical board evaluation/VA disability. Participants are also asked about current 726 
medications being used and provide information on how long they have been taking the medication. The Health 727 
Questionnaire also asks about caffeine use and frequency of use in the past month.  Overall, this measure provides a 728 
brief, yet comprehensive overview of the patient’s medical and psychiatric history as well as relevant information 729 
regarding caffeine use and medications. This measure will be administered at the baseline assessment and 1 -month 730 
follow -up. 731 
 732 
5. Prior and Concomitant Medications Interview . The Prior and Concomitant Medication Interview is a brief, semi -structured 733 
interview to assess medication use, dose, frequency, route of administration , and course of medication use in the past 30 734 
days prior to the assessment. The interview also assesses if medication use is ongoing and the indication for the 735 
medication use. This measure will be administered at the baseline assessment.  736 
 737 
6. Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI).51 The SITBI is a structured interview assessing the presence, 738 
frequency, and characteristics of self -injurious and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The SITBI will be administered by an 739 
Independent Evaluator, who will instruct the participants to answer the questions based on their entire lifetime of 740 
experience. The SITBI has shown high interrater reliability, test -retest reliability, and concurrent validity. This measure will 741 
be administered at the baseline assessment and the one -month follow -up assessment.  742 
 743 
7. Depressive Symptoms Index -Suicidality Subscale (DSI -SS).52  The DSI -SS will be used to assess current suicidal 744 
ideation. The DSI -SS is a 4 -item self -report measure of suicidal ideation that focuses on ideation, plans, perceived control 745 
over ideation, and impulses for suicide. It is being used as a core measure in the Military Suicide Research Consortium. 746 
Scores on each item range from 0 to 3, with higher scores reflecting greater severity of suicidal ideation. Instructions will  747 
instruct the participants to respond based on the past two weeks. A systematic review of measures of suicidal ideation 748 
and behaviors found that the DSI -SS had evidence of excellent internal consistency and concurrent validity. This measure 749 
will be administered at the baseline assessment, interim assessments, and the one -month follow -up assessment.  750 
 751 
8. The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM -5 (CAPS -5).3 The CAPS -5 is structured interview that assesses the 752 
DSM -5 criteria for PTSD. Each item is rated on a severity scale ranging from 0 (Absent) to 4 (Extreme/incapacitating) and 753 
combines information about frequency and intensity for each of the 20 symptoms. Additional items that are not included in 754 
the total score evaluate overall symptom duration, distress, impairment, dissociative symptoms, and global ratings by the 755 
interviewer. Validation studies are nearly complete to establish the psychometric properties of the CAPS -5 and findings 756 
will be reported in peer -reviewed publications. This interview is very similar to its predecessor, the CAPS for DSM -IV, 757 
which has been considered the gold standard for evaluating PTSD and demonstrated good reliability and validity. In 758 
addition to reflecting diagnostic changes for PTSD in DSM -5, the CAPS -5 differs from the CAPS in that frequency and 759 
intensity ratings for each symptom are no longer scored separately, so the severity rating for each item determines 760 
whether a symptom is present or not. Subscale scores are calculated by summing severity scores for items in the 761 
following PTSD symptom clusters: re -experiencing, avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, and 762 
hyperarousal. Scores ≥ 25 indicate a probable diagnosis of PTSD. This measure will be administered at the baseline 763 
assessment and the one -month follow -up assessment.  764 
 765 
9. PTSD CheckList -5 (PCL -5).4 The PCL -5 is a 20 -item self -report measure update of the PCL designed to assess PSTSD 766 
symptoms as defined by the DSM -5. The PCL -5 is currently available and has been shown to have good psychometric 767 
properties. The PCL -5 evaluates how much participants have been bothered by PTSD symptoms in the past week (for all 768 
assessments during treatment) or the past two weeks (all other assessment time points) as a result of a specific life event.  769 
Each item of the PCL -5 is scored on a five-point  scale ranging from 0 “not at all”) to 4 (“extremely). This measure will be 770 
administered at the baseline assessment, the interim assessments, and the one -month follow -up assessment.  771 
 772 
10. Patient Health Questionnaire -9 (PHQ -9).53 The PHQ -9 is a widely used and well -validated instrument for measuring the 773 
severity of depressive symptoms. It consists of 9 items that assess both affective and somatic symptoms related to 774 
depression and depressive disorders; these 9 items correspond to the diagnostic criteria for DSM MDD. Respondents rate 775 
the frequency with which they have been bothered by depressive symptoms within the past two weeks on a scale ranging 776 
from 0 (“not at all”) to 3 (“nearly every day”). Scores on all items are summed to obtain a total severity score. Scores 777 
reflect no significant depressive symptoms (0 -4), mild depressive symptoms (5 -9), moderate depressive symptoms (10 - 778 
14), moderately severe depressive symptoms (15 -19), and severe depressive symptoms (>19). Respondents also 779 
indicate the degree to which their depressive symptoms have made it difficult for them to do their work, take care of things 780 
at home, or get along with other people, from “not difficult at all” to “extremely difficult.” The PHQ -9 has high internal 781

of 21 consistency (e.g., alpha ranging from .83 to .92) and correlates strongly with other measures of depression. This measure 782 
will be administered at the baseline assessment, the interim assessments, and the one -month follow -up assessment.  783 
 784 
11. Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD -7).54 The GAD -7 will be used to assess generalized anxiety symptomology. 785 
This is a 7 -item measure that asks participants to rate the frequency with which they have been bothered by anxiety 786 
symptoms within the past two weeks on a scale ranging from 0 (“not at all”) to 3 (“nearly every day”). Scores on all items 787 
are summed to obtain a total severity score.  Scores reflect no significant anxiety symptoms (0 -4), mild anxiety symptoms 788 
(5-9), moderate anxiety symptoms (10 -14), and severe anxiety symptoms (>15).  Respondents also indicate the degree to 789 
which their anxious symptoms have made it difficult for them to do their work, take care of things at home, or get along 790 
with other people, from “not difficult at all” to “extremely difficult.” The GAD -7 has been shown to have high internal 791 
consistency (e.g., α = .89) and has been shown to reliably discriminate between anxious and non -anxious diagnostic 792 
groups. This measure will be administered at the baseline assessment , interim assessments,  and the one -month follow - 793 
up assessment.  794 
 795 
12. Brief Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning (BIPF).55 The BIPF is a 7 -item self -report instrument measuring respondents’ 796 
level of functioning in seven life domains: romantic relationship, relationship with children, family relationships, friendsh ips 797 
and socializing, work, training and education, and activities of daily living. Respondents indicate the degree to which they 798 
had trouble in the last 30 days in each area on a 7 -point scale ranging from “0 = Not at all” to “6 = Very much.” This 799 
measure will be administered at the baseline assessment, and the one -month follow -up assessment.  800 
 801 
13. Veterans Rand 12 -Item Health Survey (VR -12).56 Because a certain level of PTSD symptoms is an occupational hazard 802 
among service members redeployed for combat, it is critical to pay close attention to functional capacities as an important 803 
index of intervention efficacy.  The Veterans SF -36 (VR -36) was adapted from the RAND SF -36 Version 1.0 804 
questionnaire, and  spans the range of health domains from physical to psychological health status. It includes two 805 
modifications.  The first modification is an increase in the number of response choices for the role physical (RP) and role 806 
emotional (RE) items from a two  point yes/no choice to a five -point likert scale (no, none of the time, yes, a little of the 807 
time, yes, some of the time, yes, most of the time, yes, all of the time).  The second modification is the use of two items t o 808 
assess health change, one focusing on physical health and one on emotional problems, in contrast to the one general 809 
change item in the RAND SF -36.56 The VR -36 has been widely used, distributed and documented in the Veterans Health 810 
Administration (VHA) with close to 2 million questionnaires administered nationally in six national surveys since 1996. The 811 
changes to the survey have increased the overall precision of the instrument and the discriminant validity of the physical 812 
and mental component summary scales.57 The VR -36 is comprised of 37 items and eight scales:  physical functioning, 813 
role limitations due to physical problems, bodily pain, general health perceptions, energy/ vitality, social functioning, rol e 814 
limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. Also, there are two summary scales:  a physical component 815 
summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS). Higher scores indicate better health. Each summary is 816 
expressed as a T score, which facilitates comparisons between the VA patients and the general U.S. population. The PCS 817 
and MCS scores provide at least 90% of the reliable variance in the eight SF -36 concepts. The Veterans SF -12 was 818 
developed from the Veterans SF -36 and adapted from the MOS SF -36. It includes fewer items for seven of the eight 819 
scales and provides 90% of the reliable variance in the two component summary measures using the Veterans SF -36. 820 
Using independent results from the Veterans Health Study and the 1996 National Survey of Ambulatory Care Patients, the 821 
results for the Veterans SF -12 corresponded very closely with the results for the Veterans SF -36 (average differences of 822 
0.06 points between them for PCS and 0.31 points for MCS). This measure will be administered at the baseline 823 
assessment and the one -month follow -up assessment  and only among participants who identify as a military veteran .  824 
 825 
14. Quick Drinking Screen (QDS).58 The QDS will be used to assess hazardous or harmful patterns of alcohol consumption in 826 
the past two weeks. The QDS is a four -item screener that assesses average number of drinking days, average number of 827 
drinks on drinking days, number of heavy drinking days, and greatest number of drinks in a day over the past two weeks. 828 
The average total drinks consumed per week can also be calculated by multiplying items 1 (average number of drinking 829 
days per week) and 2 (average drinks per day). This measure will be administered at the baseline assessment and the 830 
one-month follow -up assessment. At the baseline assessment, the PI (Casey Straud, PsyD) and physician collaborator 831 
(Van King , MD) will review QDS scores to determine if the screened individual demonstrates clinically significant alcohol 832 
abuse that warrants exclusion from the study.  This measure will be administered at the baseline assessment and the one - 833 
month follow -up assessment.  834 
 835 
15. National Institute of Drug Abuse Quick Screen (NIDA -Q).59 The NIDA -Q will be used to identify individuals with a history of 836 
or current substance abuse. The NIDA -Q is a brief interview to assess history and current alcohol, tobacco, and other 837 
substances. Each substance involves seven questions to determine a substance involvement score with scores ranging 838 
from 0 -27 per substance. Scores greater than or equal to 27 indicate high risk and scores between 4 -26 suggest 839

of 21 moderate risk. Participants are first asked about the frequency of substance use in the past year. If the patient reports 840 
none, then screening in this section for the past year is complete. If the participant endorses use in the past year, 841 
additional follow -up questions are asked to determine the frequency and severity of use for each substance. Part two of 842 
the NIDA -Q assesses lifetime substance use. If the participant responds “no” then screening for part two is complete. If 843 
the participant endorses a history of substance use, additional questions are asked to assess frequency and severity in 844 
the past three months. For the purposes of this study, participants who endorse current use (or a history of abuse) of the 845 
five listed substances described in the exclusion criteria section will be excluded from the study. This measure will be 846 
administered at the baseline assessment and 1 -month follow -up. 847 
 848 
16. Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).60 The ISI is a 7 -item self -report measure that assesses perceived severity of insomnia. 849 
Each item uses a 4 -point Likert type scale from 0 (not at all satisfied) to 4 (very much satisfied). The items sum to produce 850 
a total score (range 0 – 28). The ISI has an internal consistency alpha coefficient of 0.74, and has shown convergent 851 
validity with other measures such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (r = 0.67), the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes 852 
about Sleep (r = 0.55), and sleep diaries (r ranges from 0.32 -0.91). This measure will be administered at the baseline 853 
assessment and the one -month follow -up assessment.  854 
 855 
17. Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI).61 The PTCI is a 36 -item questionnaire that was developed to determine how 856 
an individual views the trauma and its sequelae in an attempt to understand both how PTSD develops and is maintained. 857 
Using an emotional processing theory, Foa and her colleagues have suggested that PTSD is a consequence of 858 
disruptions in the normal processes of recovery when an individual has excessively rigid concepts about self and world 859 
rendering the person vulnerable if a traumatic event occurs. Thus,  the PTCI was developed as a measure of trauma - 860 
related thoughts and beliefs.  It is comprised of three subscales (Negative Cognitions about the Self, Negative Cognitions 861 
about the World, and Self -Blame).  The measure was tested in almost 600 adult volunteers recruited from two university 862 
PTSD treatment clinics as well as a university community.  Approximately 65% (n=392) of individuals reported having 863 
experienced a trauma in which their own life or that of another person was perceived to be in danger and their response at 864 
the time included intense terror, horror, or helplessness (Criterion A event).  The remaining 35% (n=162) denied such a 865 
traumatic experience.  Of those who had experienced a trauma, 170 had PTSD symptoms of at least moderate severity 866 
while the remaining 185 reported a low symptom severity.  The three subscales of the PTCI demonstrated internal 867 
consistency with alpha coefficients ranging from 0.86 to 0.97.  Convergent validity was demonstrated comparing the PTCI 868 
to appropriate subscales of the World Assumptions Scale and Personal Beliefs and Reactions Scale.  Significant 869 
correlations between the appropriate subscales ranged from 0.20 to 0.85.  The PTCI was able to differentiate individuals 870 
with and without PTSD demonstrating discriminate validity (sensitivity = 0.78, specificity = 0.93).  Test –retest reliability for 871 
each of the three subscales at a 1 -week interval ranged from 0.75 to 0.89 and for a 3 -week interval ranged from 0.80 to 872 
0.86. This measure will be administered at the baseline assessment, the interim assessments, and the one -month follow - 873 
up assessment.  874 
 875 
18. Credibility/ Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ) for PE .62  The CEQ is a 6 -item measure that was designed to assess 876 
treatment expectancy and rationale credibility for use in clinical outcomes studies.  This measure has been utilized across 877 
a number of STRONG STAR treatment trials and can be easily adapted to assess the target intervention(s). For the 878 
current proposed study, the CEQ will be adapted to assess the credibility and expectancy for PE and CBD separately will 879 
be assessed separately from the credibility and expectancy for Cannabidiol.  The 6 -item CEQ assesses both whether the 880 
person cognitively understands how the therapy works (credibility) as well as whether the person affectively believes that 881 
the therapy will work for them personally (expectancy).  The 6 -item CEQ has been tested in 217 individuals including 68 882 
male Vietnam veterans and 58 female spouses, 69 individuals diagnosed with general anxiety disorder who had received 883 
treatment, and 22 individuals who had received either Cognitive Based Therapy (CBT) or Eye Movement Desensitization 884 
and Reprocessing (EMDR) for the treatment of PTSD.  The scale demonstrated high internal consistency (alpha 885 
coefficients ranged from 0.84 to 0.85).   Test -retest reliability over a one -week period was found to be 0.82 for expectancy 886 
and 0.75 for credibility. The CEQ was able to differentiate between two treatment rationales in one study, one with and 887 
one without an encompassing theory while maintaining equivalence between three rationales in another study.  888 
Responses to four questions are scored using a 9 -point Likert scale (1= not at all, 9= extremely).  Responses to two of the 889 
questions are scored using an 11 -point Likert Scale (0% to 100%).  The combined responses are used to generate a 890 
score for credibility and another score for expectancy. This measure will be administered prior to the second PE session 891 
following Session 1 which will review the PE rationale for the treatment of PTSD.  892 
 893 
19. Credibility/ Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ) for CBD . The CEQ is a 6 -item measure that was designed to assess 894 
treatment expectancy and rationale credibility for use in clinical outcomes studies.  The CEQ has been utilized across a 895 
number of STRONG STAR treatment trials and can be easily adapted to assess the target intervention(s). For the current 896 
proposed study, the CEQ will be adapted to assess the credibility and expectancy for PE and CBD separately will be 897

Study Title
A phase 1/2 ,multicenter, open -label, dose finding study  to assess the safet y, tolerabilit y,and 
preliminary efficacy  of CC-122 in co mbination wit h nivo lumab in subjects with unresectable 
hepatocellular carcino ma (HCC ).
Indication
Adult subjects who have progressed af ter or were intol erant to no m ore than 2 previous systemic 
therapi es for unresectable HCC, or are naïve to systemic therapy. 
Objectives
The primary objective of the P hase 1 portion (dose finding) of the study is:
To determine the safet y and tol erabili ty of CC-122 when administered orally  in 
combinat ion with nivolumab and to define the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)
The primary objective of the P hase 2 portion (dose expansion) of the study is:
To estimate the preliminary  efficacy of CC -122 in combinat ion with nivolumab based 
on overall response rate (ORR) by  Response Evaluation Criteria in So lid Tumors
Versi on 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)
The secondary objectives of the study are:
To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of CC-122 in combinat ion with nivo lumab based 
on various endpo ints by RECIST 1.1
Toevaluate the pharmacokinet ics (PK) of C C-122 in subjects coadministered
multiple doses of CC-122 with nivolumab
To determine nivolumab PK when coadministered with CC
-122
Study Design
CC-122-HCC-002 i s a Phase 1/2 dose escala tionandexpansi onclinic alstudy of CC- 122 in 
combination with nivolumab insubjects who haveprogressed after or w ereintolerant to no m ore 
than 2 previous systemic therapies for unresectable HCC , or are naïve to systemic therapy .The 
dose escala tionpartofthestudy willexplore1 or more dose levels of CC-122 incombina t ion
with nivolumab using amodified doseescalat ion (3+3) desig n (Storer, 1989 ), followed by an 
expansi o
npart once the RP2D is defined .
The study  is desi gned to expl ore three dose levels, to ident ify the RP2D, and is not required to 
escalate to a nontolerated dose ( NTD )or maximum tol erated dose ( MTD) . CC-122 will be 
administered orally 5 consecut ive days out of 7 (5 days on/2 day s off weekly ) on Days 1
to5, 8
to 12, 15 to 19 and 22 to 26 of each 28 -day cycle. The starting daily  dose of CC -122 will be 2.0 
mg, andtwo subsequent dose level s
(3.0and 4.0 mg) are planned to be evaluated based on
evaluat ion of pre-specified dose limit ingtoxicities (DLTs ). The study  intends to i dentify the 
RP2D at or below the 4.0 mg dose level, however intermediate dose levels, or a higher dose 
level, m ay be evaluated at the discret ion of the Safety  Review Co mmit tee (SRC).   
Nivolumab 
will be administered intravenously (IV) at the fixed dose of 3 .0mg/kg every 2 weeks.

Protocol  CC-122- HCC - 002 Celgene Corporati on
Confident ial and Propri etary 7 CC-122-HCC -002 Amendment 2 Final: 29 Aug 2017Up to six subjects will be concurrent ly enrolled into a dose level.  Decisio ns as to which dose 
level to enroll a new subject in will be based on the number of subjects enrolled and evaluable, 
the number of subjects experiencing DLTs and the number of subjects enrolled but who are not 
yet evaluable for toxicit y in the current cohort at the time of new subject entry .
A dose isconsidered an NTD when 2 or m ore out of 6 evaluable subjects in a cohort experience 
a DLT in Cycle 1. During dose escalation, the decisio n to ei ther evaluate a hi gher dose level, an 
intermediate dose level , declare an NTD, or define the RP2D will be determined by the SRC , 
based on thei r review of all available clinical data, PK, pharmacodynamic ( PD)and laboratory 
safet y data for a given dose cohort.   
Non-evaluable subjects will be replaced at the discretion of the S RC.
Following com pletion of the dose escalat ionpart, up to 30addit ional subjects will be enro lled in 
anexpansi on cohort of mixed HCC et io
logy – hepati tis B vir us (HBV) , hepati tis C vir us (HCV)
and non -viral.  A futilit y analysis will be conducted as fo llows:
in the first 14 subjects treated, if 
no responder is observed out of 14 subjects then enrollment for the expansio n cohort will stop for 
futilit y.  Enrollment will cont inue during the evaluation of the 14 subjects.  If ≥ 1 subject out of 
14 responds (com plete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) , then appr oximately  30 total  
subjects will be enrolled in the expansi on part .  The SRC will continue to review safet y data 
regul arly throughout the study  and make recommendat ions about study  continuat ion and dose 
modificati on, as appropri ate.
The study  will be condu cted in compliance with International Conference on Harmonisat ion 
(ICH) Good Clinical Pract ices (GCPs).
Study Population 
Adult subjects with confirmed pathologic diagnosis of unresectable HCC, according to the 
American Associat ion forthe Study  ofLiver D iseases (AASLD) Guidelines ( Bruix, 2005 ) who 
have progressed after or were intolerant to no m ore than 2 previous systemic therapies for 
unresectable HCC, or are naïve to systemic therapy. 
Subjects at screening must have a Chi ld-Pugh score l ess than 7 (class A) and have an Eastern 
Cooperative Onco logy Group Perform ance Status ( ECOG PS )of 0 or 1.
Up to a pproximately 20 subjects will be enrolled inthe dose escalat ion porti on of  the study  
(Phase 1), depending upon the number of cohorts opened.   Up to approximately 30 additional 
subjects will be evaluated for safet y, PK, PD, and preliminary ant itumor effects during the dose 
expansio n porti on (Phase 2).  Therefore up to approximately 50 total subjects may be enro lled 
into the study .
Length of Study
The screening period will last approximately up to 28 days. Subject s may remai n on treatment 
for up to 2 y ears or until diseaseprogress ion,unacceptabl etoxicity, subjec t or physician
decisi on, w
ithdrawa l ofconsent, or death. If treatment is discont inued for reason sother than 
disease progressi on, start of a new ant icancer therapy , or wi thdrawal of consent , subjects will 
continue to be fo llowed for tum or eval uation untilprogression. Subjects will be fo llowed for 
survival status e ither unt il death, lost to follow -up, withdrawal  of consent or until two y ears fro m 
enrollment, whichever event occurs first. The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last 
visit of the last subject to complete the post -treatment fo llow-up, orthedate ofreceiptofthe last

analysis, aspre-specified in the protocol, whichever is the later date. 
Study Treatments
All cohorts will receive different dose levels o f CC-122 a nd a standard dose of nivolumab, 3 .0
mg/kg IV every  2 weeks.  The durati on of  treatm ent will not exceed 2 y ears.  Study  treatm ent 
may be discont inued if there is evidence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicit y,or 
subject/physician decisio n to wi thdraw. 
Subjects m ay continue to receive study  drugs bey ond disease progressi on at the discretion o f the 
Invest igator, especially if required to confirmafter 4 to 6 weeks the immune -related Response 
Evaluat ion Cri teria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST )for tum or progressi on.
Overview of Key Efficacy Assessments
Tumor assessments will be performed at screening (up to 28 day s before the Cycle 1 Day  1 
[C1D1 ] dose ), every 8 weeks (±7 day s) for the first 5 evaluat ions(10 m onths) , and thereafter 
every 12 weeks (±7 days) , regardl ess of treatm ent status . Tum or assessments shoul d also be 
perform ed at any  time, if clinically indicated.  Tumor assessments should cont inue at the defined 
schedule unt il radio logic disease progression or new ant icancer therapy , bey ond the end of 
treatm ent if necessary .
All subjects will be evaluated for tumor response and progression by the Investigator according 
to RECIST 1.1 guidelines using the same scanning modalit ies used at screening .
Tumor response will al so be determined by the Investigator based on irRECIST (Bohnsack, 
2014 ) as an exploratory  assessment .Other exploratory efficacy variables, such as ECOG PS, 
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)reducti on, etc ,will be summarized as well. An independent review of 
the efficacy  resul ts may take pl ace at any  time during the study .
Following di sease progressi on, survival status will be determined approximately  every  3 months
thereafter until 2 years from  enro llment, lost to follow -up, death or w ithdrawal o f consent , 
whichever occurs sooner .
New ant icancer therapies will also be collected at the same schedule. New ant icancer therapy 
includes (but is not limited to) any  systemic or l ocoregi onal medicati on, surgery , radi ation, or 
any other therapy  intended to treat the subject’s cancer .
Overview of Key Safety Assessments
Allsubjects willbe mo nitored for adverse events (AEs), starting from the time the subject signs 
the informed consent form (ICF) unt il the end of treatment (EOT) visit, for 28 days aft erthe last 
dose of CC-122 and f or 90 days af ter the last dose of  nivolumab, whichever occurs later. A 
thorough evalua tion
ofmedica lcondi tions will be conducted during screening foreligibili ty. The 
safetyvariablesforthisstudy include AEs, safet yclinical laboratory variables, 12-lead
e
lectrocard iogra ms (ECGs) , left ventricula r ejectionfraction (LVEF) assessments, physical 
examina tions, ophthalmologic exams, vi tal signs, ECOG PS, exposure toinvest igational product 
(IP), assessment of concomitant medications, and pregnancy testing for females of child bearing 
potenti al (FCBP).

Confident ial and Propri etary 9 CC-122-HCC -002 Amendment 2 Final: 29 Aug 2017Overview of Pharmacokinetic Assessments
Blood will be co llected to estimate the PK of C C-122 when administered in combina tion with
nivolumab andthePK of nivolumab when administered in combination with CC- 122.
For CC -122, during the dose escala tion part, intensive PK sampling will be perform ed in all 
subjects at multi ple time p oints on Cycle 1Day15.For nivo lumab, sparse PK (at predose and at 
the end of infusio n) will be performed in all subjects on Cy cle 1 Days 1 and 15. No PK will be 
collected during the dose expansio n part.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Statistical Methods
Statis
tical analyses will be performed by study part, dose l evel/dosing regimen and/or HCC 
etiologyas needed or applicable. All analyses will be descrip tive innature.
Allsummaries of safe tydata will be conducted using subjects receiving at least one dose of 
either IP(theTreated Popula tion).
The efficacy variabl es ofprimar y interest includ e overall response rate (ORR), overall survival
(OS), duration of respons e(DoR) ,disease control rate (DCR), progressi on-free survival (PFS) 
and time to progression (TTP ).The primary assessment of tumor response will be according to 
RECIST 1.1 (Eisenhauer, 2009 ). Explorator yresponse assessment using irRECIST (Bohnsack, 
2014 ) willalso be perform ed.Other preliminary  efficacy variables such as AFP response willbe 
summarized using frequency tabula tions for categor ical v ariable s ordescr iptivestatistics for 
continuous variable s,and further analyses willbe perform ed as appropri ate.Efficacy analysis 
will be repeated for the Treated Populat ion and Efficacy Evaluable Populat ion (receiving atleast 
50% of both assigned IPinthe first 2 cycles, having a baseline tumor assessment and 1on study  
tumor assessment), with the result using t he Treated Populat ion considered primary .
Allbiomarke r
-relateddatapresentat ionswill be based on treated subjects with at least one no n-
missin g bio marker assessment (theBiomarker Evaluable [BE]Popula tion), unless specified 
otherwi se. Descrip tive statistics will be presented for baseline and change from baseline o f 
continuous biomarke r endp oints.
Exploration of PK, PD, safe tyandefficacy relationships will be assessed.

Confident ial and Propri etary 10 CC-122-HCC -002 Amendment 2 Final: 29 Aug 2017During the dose escala tion part, up to approximately 20 subjects will be enrolled.Durin gthe 
cohort expansi onpart, up to 30 subjects willbeenrolled. At least 14 efficacy evaluable subjects 
will initially be accrued. If the response rate is 20% or m ore, there will be more than a 95% 
chance that 1or m ore responders would be observed in the first 14 subjects (Gehan, 1961 ).  If 
no responder is observed out of  14 subjects, the enrollment for the expansion cohort will stop 
for futili ty. Otherwise, the expansi on cohort will be expanded to up to approximately 30 
subjects if a responder is observed.   Enro llment will cont inue during the evaluat ion of the init ial 
14 subjects.  With 30 subjects enrolled and assuming the observed ORR is 35%, the two -sided 
95% Wilson score confidence interval will exclu de 20%, the estimated ORR for nivolumab 
monotherapy (El -Khoueir y, 2015 ).

3.1. Study Design
CC-122- HCC -002 i s a Phase 1/2 dose escalat ion and expansio n clinical study  of CC-122 in 
combinat ion with nivo lumab in subjects with unresectable HCC who ha
veprogressed after or 
wereintolerant to no more than 2 previous systemic therapies for unresectable HCC , or are naïve 
to systemic therapy . 
Subjects will have received eit her none or no more than 2 previous systemic therapies. The dose 
escalat ion part of the study  will explore 1 or more dose l evels o f CC-122 in co mbinat ion with 
nivolumab using a modified dose escalat ion (3+3) design
(Storer , 1989), followed by an 
expansio n part once the recommended Phase 2 dose ( RP2D )is defined.
The study  is desi gned to expl ore three dose levels, as described in Sect ion7.2.1 ,to identify the 
RP2D, and is not required to escalate to a nontolerated dose ( NTD )or MTD.  CC-122 will 
initially be administered orally 5 con secut ive days out of 7 (5 days on/2 day s off weekly) on 
Days 1to 5, 8to 12, 15 to 19 and 22 to 26 of each 28
-day cycle. The investigated starting daily 
dose of CC -122 will be 2.0 m g, and two subsequent dose level s (3.0and 4.0 mg) are planned to
be evaluated based on evaluat ion of pre-specified DLTs. The study  intends to i dentify the RP2D 
at or bel ow the 4.0 mgdose level, however i ntermedi ate dose l evels, or a higher dose level, may  
be evaluated at the discret ion of the Safet y Review Committee (SRC)
.Dose escalat ion to the 
intermediate or higher dose levels of CC-122 will not exceed 50% of  the previ ously  established 
tolerable dose level. Smaller dose increments based on toxicit y, PK profile and PD findings may 
be evaluated, if necessary .  Nivo lumab will be administered at the dose of 3.0 mg/kg 
intravenously ( IV)every 2 weeks .Once the RP2D for dosing of CC -122 in co mbinat ion with 
nivolumab is defined, expansio n (
Phase 2)will start.
A modified 3+3 dose escalation design will be used to ident ify the init ial toxicit y of the
combinat ion.  Up to six subjects will be concurrently enrolled into a dose l evel
.  Decisi ons as to 
which dose level to enroll a new subject will be based on the number of subjects enrolled and 
evaluable, the number of subjects experiencing DLTs, and the number of subjects enro lled but 
who are not yet evaluable for toxicit y in the current cohort at the time of new subject entry .
A dose isconsidered anNTD if2 or m ore out of up to 6 evaluable subjects in a cohort 
experience a DLT in Cycle 1.  During dose escalatio n, the decisio n to ei ther eval uate a hi gher 
dose l evel, an intermediate dose level , or decl are theRP2D dose (or if applicable ,NTD) will be 
determined by the SRC , based on their review of all available clinical data, PK, PD and 
laboratory  safety data for a given dose cohort.
The composit ion of the SRC will be defined in the SRC charter and will include at least all the 
Principal Invest igators (PIs)of active sites and the Celgene medical monitorsand safet y 
physician .
Non-evaluable subjects will be replaced at the discretion of the SRC .
Following com pletion of the dose escalat ion part (Phase 1) , up to 30 addit ional subjects will be 
enrolled in an ex pansio n part (Phase 2) .  A fut ility analysis will be conducted as fo llows.  In the 
first 14 subj ects treated, if no responder is observed out of 14 subjects then enrollment for the 
expansio n cohort will stop for fut ility.  Enrollment will cont inue during t he evaluat ion of the 14

be enrolled in the Phase 2 portion.  The SRC will continue to review safet y data regul arly 
throughout the study  and make recommendat ions about study  continuat ion and dose 
modificati on, as appropri ate.
The study  will be conducted in com pliance wi th Internati onal Conf erence on Harm onisat ion

6.4. Follow -up Pe riod
6.4.1. Safety Follow -up
All subjects will be mo nitored for reporting of new or follow -up of  exist ing concomitant 
medicat ions, concomitant procedures and AEs for 28 day s after the l ast dose of CC -122.
Anadditional safety follow-up is requi red after 90 days from the last dose of nivo lumab. 
Pregnancy will be reported according to Secti on10.4.1 , females o f childbearing potential will be 
monitored for the mandatory  use of effect ive contraception for at least 5 months after the last 
dose of nivo lumab.
6.4.2. Efficacy Follow -up
All subjects who discont
inue treatment for reasons other than disease progression, start of a new 
anticancer therapy , or withdrawal o f consent fro m the ent ire study  will be fo llowed for response 
until confirmati on of  disease progression and/or initiation of new ant icancer therapies.
6.4.3. Survival Follow -up
After the EOT visit, all subjects will be fo llowed for survival status eit her unt il death, lost to 
follow-up, or until two y ears fro m enrollment, whichever event occurs first. This evaluat ion 
shoul d be conducted every  3 months (±7 day s) thereafter.   New anticancer therapies will also be 
collected at the same schedule. New ant icancer therapy  includes (but is not limited to) any  
systemic or l ocoregi onal medicat ion, surgery , radiati on, or any  other therapy  intended to treat the 
subject’s cancer.
Survival fo llow-up may  be conducted by  record review (including public records) and/or 
telephone contact wi th the subject, family , or the subject’s treati ng physician.
6.5. Efficacy Assessments
Tumor assessments will be performed at screening (up to 28 day s before the start of study  
treatm ent), every  8 weeks (±7 days) for the first 5evaluat ions (through Month 10), thereafter 
every 12 weeks (±7 days), regardless of treatment status. Tumor assessments should also be 
perform ed at any  time, if clinically indicated.  Tumor assessments should cont inue at the defined 
schedule unt il radio logic disease pr ogressi on or the start of new ant icancer therapy , bey ond the 
end of treatment if necessary .
Response will be assessed using RECIST 1.1 (investigator assessment), and irRECIST as an 
exploratory  assessment.  An independent review of efficacy results may take place at 
anytime at 
the discret ion of the study  Sponsor. Other exploratory  efficacy variables, such as ECOG PS, AFP 
reducti on, etc ,will be summarized as well. 
6.5.1. Assessment of Response According to RECIST 1.1
Response assessments include co mputed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI ).  The regions to be imaged are the chest and abdo men/pelvis, as well as any other sites 
EDMS Doc. Number: 22132024 - 20879383CC-122
Protocol  CC-122- HCC - 002 Celgene Corporati on
Confident ial and Propri etary 52 CC-122-HCC -002 Amendment 2 Final: 29 Aug 2017requi red for tum or imaging. The same mode of imaging for lesio n evaluation at screening must 
be used consistent ly throu ghout the study .
The CT imaging should include contrast unless medically contraindicated. Convent ional CT 
shoul d be perform ed wi th cont iguous cuts of 5 mm or less in slice thickness. Spiral CT should be 
perform ed by  use of  a 5 mm  cont iguous reconstruction algorithm.
All subjects wi th evidence of object ive tumor response (CR or PR) should have the response 
confirmed wit h repeat assessments at the next scheduled scan, but after no less than 4 weeks.  
Response assessments must have occurred ≥ 6 weeks from Cycl e 1 Day  1 to be consi dered as 
stable disease (SD) for a best response.
Addit ional details and definit ions of response are found in Appendix Bin Sect ion18.2.
6.5.2. Treatment Beyond Progression
Subjects will be permitted to continue treatment beyo nd init ial RECIST 1.1 defined progressive 
disease as l ong as they  meet the following criteria:
Continue to meet all other study  protocol  eligibilit y criteria
Invest igator assessed clinical benefit and do not have rapid disease progression or 
clinical deterioration
Stabl e performance status
Tolerance to IP
Other treatment options, including no treatment and supportive care, have been 
discussed and subject has consente d to continue IP
A follow-up scan shoul d be per formed wi thin 4to 6 weeks of the original PD to determine 
whether there has been a decrease in the tumor size, or con tinued PD. Thereafter, response 
assessment should occur per standard of care. The assessment of clinical benefit should be 
balanced by clinical judgment as to whether the subject is clinically deteriorating and unlikely to 
receive any benefit fro m continued treatment .If the Invest igator feels that the subject continues 
to achieve clini cal benefi t by continuing treatm ent, the subject m ay remain on study  treatm ent.
The decisio n to continue treatment should be discussed with the Celgene Medical Monitor and 
docum ented in the study  source docum ents.
Study  therapy  shoul d be di scontinued if further progressio n is documented. For the subjects who 
continue study  therapy  beyond progressi on, further progression is defined as an addit ional 10% 
increase in tumor burden fro m time o f initial PD. This increase in tumor burden includes an 
increase in all target l esions and/or the development of new measurable lesio ns.
6.5.3. Other Assessments
Addit ional scans, i ncluding brain scans, or nuclear medicine bone scan may  be perform ed if 
clinically indicated (eg, symptoms of brain metastasis) at the discretion of the Invest igator.

CC-122 Pregnancy  Risk Minimizat ion Plan for Celgene Clinical Tri als (Appendix G, Secti on
18.7) applies to all subjects receiving CC -122 therapy .
CC-122 will be dispensed through a qualified healthcare professio nal (including but not limited 
to, nurses, pharmacists and physicians).  These healt hcare professio nals will be trained by 
Celgene, or desi gnee, in requi rements specific to counseling o f subjects.  Once trained these 
healt hcare staff will counsel subjects prior to the admini strati on of  CC-122 to ensure that the 
subject has complied wit h all requirements including use of birth control and that the subject 
understands the risks associated with CC -
122.  This step will be documented with a completed 
Educati on and Counseling Guida nce Document, and CC -122 will not be administered unt il this 
step occurs.
A CC -122 Inform ation Sheet will be provided to each subject before IPis dispensed.
Females of childbearing potential and fertile males, other than the subject , should not handle or 
administer CC -122 unless they are wearing gloves.

Confident ial and Propri etary 58 CC-122-HCC -002 Amendment 2 Final: 29 Aug 2017Dosing will start at dose level 1.  Each dose l evel must be cleared by the SRC based on review of 
all available clinical, safet y, PK, PD and l aboratory  data before init iating the next higher dose 
level.   The study  intends to i dentify the RP2D at or bel owthe 4.0 m g dose l evel, however 
intermediate or higher dose levels may  be expl ored at the discret ion of the SRC.
During dose escalat ion, the decisio n to ei ther evaluate a hi gher dose l evel, an intermi ttent dose 
schedule, or declare theRP2D (or if applicable NTD) will be determined by the SRC, based on 
their review of all available clinical data, PK, PD and laborator y safet y data for a gi ven dose 
cohort.
Intra -subject dose escalat ion of CC-122 is not permitted during Cycle 1, but may be permitted in 
later cycles if approved by the SRC.
Dose reduction of CC-
122 and tem porary  interruptio n of one or both IPsdue to toxic ity during 
Cycle 1 is allo wed but may  consti tute a DLT, as outlined in Sect ion 7.6and 7.9.
Study  treatm ent may  be discontinued if there is evidence of clinically significant disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicit y or subject/physician decisio n to wi thdraw.  Subj ects may  
continue to receive C C-122 andnivolumab bey ond disease progressi on at the discretion o f the 
Invest igator.
If any subject continues to experience unacceptable toxicit y after permi tted IP adjustments, one 
or both IPs will be discont inued permanent ly.
The est imated total number of subjects to be enrolled during dose escalat ion is approximately 20 
to 30, depending on cohort size.  Up to 30 additional subjects will be evaluated for safet y, PK, 
PD, and preliminary  anti-tumor effects in one or two expansio n cohorts.
7.3. Definition of a DLTEvaluable Subject
All subjects who receive at least one dose of either CC -122 or nivo lumab will be evaluable for 
DLT .
In the dose escalat ion part, a subject evaluable for DLT i s defined as one who:
Received at least 75% of the planned doses of CC -122 and of nivo lumab during 
Cycle 1 wi thout experi encing a DLT ,having been fo llowed for the ent ire DLT 
assessment period ( see Secti on 7.6)
or
Experi enced a DLT after receiving at least one dose of either IP.
Non-evaluable subjects will be replaced at the discretion of the SRC .  Addi tional subjects wi thin 
any dose cohort may be enro lled at the discret ion of the SRC.
7.4. Definition of Non -tolerated Dose
AnNTD is defined as a dose level at which 2 or more out of up to 6 evaluable subjects in any 
dose cohort experience a DLT in Cycle 1.   Escal ation to a nNTD i s not required in this study , as 
described in Section 7.2

If an NTD i s identified, dose escalat ion will be stopped.  The MTD is defined as the last dose 
level below the NTD with none or 1 out of 6 evaluable subjects experiencing DLT during Cycle 
1.  The RP2D may be a dose that meets the definit ion of MTD, however e scalation to an MTD is 
not required in this study , as described in Section 7.2.1
7.6. Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity
During dose escalat ion, the DLT as sessment period is defined as Days 1 to28 of Cycle 1 
including the predose assessments specified for Day 1 o f Cycle 2.
National Cancer Inst itute Commo n Termino logy Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) 
Versi on 4.03are used as a guide for the grading of severit y of adverse events.
A DLT is defined as any o f the following toxi cities occurring within the DLT assessment 
window unless the event can clearly be determined to be unrelated to the drug . Dose -limit ing 
toxicities are described below:
Any toxicit y that would lead to dose reduction or discontinuat ion of CC-122 or 
discontinuat ion of nivolumab during Cycle 1 .
Any Grade 4 non -hematol ogic toxi city of any durati on.
Any clinicall yrelevan tnon
-hemato logic toxicity that is ≥ Grade 3except for:
Grade 3 diarrhea or v omiting of not more than 5 days duration (with optimal 
medical management)
Grade 3 fat igue or asthenia of not more than 3 days durati onwith optimal medical 
management
Grade 3 infusio n-related reaction controlled by  interruption of the infusio n and 
medical management Any liver enzy mes elevat ion according to the definit ions bel ow:
AST or ALT ≥8 x ULN of> 7 day s durati on
Total  bilirubin ≥5 x ULN of >7 day s durati on
Concurrent AST or ALT > 3 x ULN and total bilirubi n > 2 x ULN
Hem atological toxicities during Cycle 1 as fo llows:
Grade 4 neutropenia lasting > 7 day s 
Febrile neutropenia
Grade 4 thrombocy topeni a lasting > 48 hours
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocy topeni a with clinically significant bleeding
Any ≥ Grade 2 uveit is or ey e pain that does not respond to topical therapy and does 
not improve to Grade 1 severit y within the re -treatment period ( ≤ 6 weeks and/or 
prior to next nivo lumab dose), or requires systemic treatment.

Confident ial and Propri etary 60 CC-122-HCC -002 Amendment 2 Final: 29 Aug 2017Any ≥ Grade 2 pneumo nitis or interstit ial lung disease that does not resolve with dose 
delay and systemic steroids. The management algorithm for pneumo nitis or 
pulmo nary toxicity can be found in the current nivolumab SmPC and in Appendix H .
Repeat laboratory  assessments are required to confirm the duration of t ime-bound DLT criter ia.  
Isolated l aboratory  changes wi thout associ ated clinical signs or symptoms (eg, hy pomagnesemia, 
hypermagnesemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypophosphatemia, lymphocy te count increased or 
decreased) may not be included in this definit ion.  These findings will b e discussed and reviewed 
by the SRC .
Events meet ing the DLT definit ion occurring beyo nd the first cy cle will  be taken into accoun t 
when determining the RP2D. Any  AE with the potent ial to become a DLT based on the duration 
shoul d be f ollowed appropri ately t o accurately determine the duration of the event.
Subjects should delay/interrupt or discont inue treatment if they experience any adverse event, 
laboratory  abnorm ality or intercurrent illness (regardless of causalit y) which, in the opinio n of 
the invest igator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the subject with continued dosing of any 
IP.  Such delay/interruption or discont inuation, however, will not be considered a DLT unless it 
meets at l east one of the DLT criteria defined above or if deemed dose -limit ing by the SRC.
7.7. Method of Treatment Assignment
An integrated response techno logy (IRT) will be used to track subject assignments to the dose 
levels.
7.8. Criteria for Dose Escalation
The SRC will make dose escalat ion decisio ns.  The deci sion criteria for dose escalat ion are:
If no DLT i s observed in the first 3 evaluable subjects during the first cy cle, dose 
escalat ion to the next higher dose level may occur.
If 1 out of 6 evaluable subjects experience sDLT during the first cy cle, dose 
escalat ion to the ne xt higher dose l evel may occur.  Addi tional subjects will  be 
enrolled to expand the cohort to 6 evaluable subjects if less than 6 subjects are 
evaluable when the DLT is observed.
If 2 or more out of up to 6 evaluable subjects experience a DLT during the DL T 
assessment period in a cohort, any  further recrui tment into that cohort will cease and 
this dose will be defined as a nNTD.
The SRC will determine if addit ional subjects will be enrolled in a parallel or at lower 
dose cohorts to have 6 evaluable subjects in order to define RP2D , or whether an 
intermediate dose level or an intermittent dosing schedule will be explored in up to 6 
newly enrolled subjects.   
Addit ional subjects may be added at a given dose level to 
further assess the safet y and/or PK .
Based on above cri teria, if no DLT i s observed in at least 3 evaluable subjects, the SRC may  
decide to escal ate the dose to the next cohort.
EDMS Doc. Number: 22132024 - 20879383CC-122
Protocol  CC-122- HCC - 002 Celgene Corporati on
Confident ial and Propri etary 61 CC-122-HCC -002 Amendment 2 Final: 29 Aug 2017If one DLT occurs prior to a decision by the SRC to dose escalate, the cohort will be expanded to 
enroll 6 evaluable subjec ts in total . Subjects 4 to 6 may be enrolled concurrent lywith the first 3 
subjects if co mplete 28 -day toxicit y data are not y et available for the first 3 subjects.
If 1 subject out of 6 evaluable subjects experience sa DLT, the dose will be escalated in t he next 
cohort, unl ess there are other safet y considerat ions by  the SRC.   The dose may also be declared 
the RP2D.
The number of cohorts depends on incidence of DLT.  A subject may experience more than 1 
DLT.  Dose escalat ion decisio ns are based on the numb er of subjects experiencing DLT events.
Intra -subject dose escalat ion beyo nd the dose init ially assigned to a subject i s not permitted in 
Cycle 1.   Those continuing to take IP bey ond Cycle 1, following approval by  the SRC, may  have 
the dose l evel increased provi ding the al ternat ive dose level has been shown to be well tolerated 
by at least one cohort of other subjects in this study .
7.8.1. Definition of Stopping Criteria for Dose Escalation
Dose escalat ion stops when 2 or more out of up to 6 evaluable subjects at any dose level 
experience DLT , or when the RP2D is declared .
7.9. Permitted IPAdjustments
CC-122 d ose reductions are permitted in any cycle, including Cycle 1; however in Cycle 1 this
may const itute DLT
. No dose reductions are allowed for nivo lumab.
Any toxic ity, unless the event can clearly  be determined to be unrelated to the IPs, 
shoul d be managed acc ording to the following tables.
In the absence of clear alternat ive causes of liver enzyme abnormalit ies m eeting DLT 
criteria, both IPs should be held and/or discont inued.
Any treatment -related toxi city that l eads to dose reducti on or di scont inuat ion of CC -
122 or discont inuat ion of nivolumab that occurs in Cy cle 1 during dose escalat ion 
will const itute DLT.
Subjects will be allowed to continue with CC-122 at a r educed dose.
Allowed dose reductions for CC-122 are described in Table 5.
For CC -122, dose reductions below 1.0 mgare not allowed .

time, but no re -escalat ion is then permi tted.
7.10. Criteria for CC-122 Dose Reduction
Any IP-related toxicit y meeting the definit ion of DLT will require dose reduction and/or 
interrupti on.  The cri teria for dose reducti on listed in Table 6andTable 7shoul d be used for

7.10.4. Management of Expected AEs While Receiving CC -122
7.10.4.1. Neutropenia, Thrombocytopenia, Anemia
Approximately  50% of  subjects treated in Part B of CC -122- ST-001 experienced neutropenia
(preliminary  data) . Neutropenia and febrile neutropenia should be managed with CC -122 dose 
interrupti on and G -CSF administration. Hematopoietic growth factors or other hematologic 
support, such as ery thropoi etin, darbepoetin
, granulocy te-colonystimulating factor ( G-CSF), 
GM-CSF, RBC -or platel et-transfusio ns are allowed in the study  with therapeut ic intent.
Therapeut ic use of G -CSF is allo wed at any  time for subjects experien cing Grade 4 neutropenia 
or any  grade febrile neutropenia.  Prophylact ic use of granulocyte (or granulocyte -macrophage) 
growth factors is not allowed during Cycle 1.
7.10.4.2. Infection
In pri or studies wi th CC-122 py rexia and infect ions were observed in > 20% of subjects. 
Vigilance for the si gns and symptoms of infect ion shoul d be practi ced and managed according to 
institutional standard m edical  pract ice.  Routine infect ious di sease prop hylaxis is not 
recommended ; however, ant ibiotic, antiviral, ant ipneumocyst is, ant ifungal, or other prophylaxis 
may be implemented during the study  at the discreti on of  the investi gator and/or SRC.
7.10.4.3. Pain
Tumor pain or treatm ent-induced pain can be controlled with opioid and opi oid-related

T or BNP warrant further investigation including assessment of the 
subject for signs and symptoms o f cardi ac injury , consi derati on of  a cardi ology consul tation, and 
other cardiac evaluat ions (such as an exercise stress test, addit ional evaluat ion of LVEF, or other 
cardi ac tests or cardioprotective medicat ions recommended by  a cardi ologist), and the addi tion 
of cardi oprotective therapy  (eg, beta bl ockers or calcium channel blockers ) as appropriate.  
Laboratory  evaluat ion to assess for assay  interference may  also be warranted. For any confirmed 
elevation of troponin -T > ULN associ ated wi th significant el evati on of  BNP (20% i ncrease fro m

perm anent ly discont inued .
In addit ion toroutine ECG m onitoring, please refer to the nivo lumab Sm PC for addi tional 
inform ation regarding potential cardiac toxicit y with nivo lumab.
7.10.4.5. Dose Modification and Management of Pneumonitis
Pneumo nitis has been observed in subjects taking CC -122. The diagnosis should be considered 
in subjects present ing wit h non -specific respiratory signs and symptoms such as hypoxia, pleural 
effusio n, cough, dy spnea, or intersti tial pulm onary infiltrates, and in whom  infect ious, neoplast ic 
and other causes are excluded by appropriate investigat ions. Subjects should be specifically 
advised to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms they experience. 
Those wi th radiological features suggest ive of non -infecti ous pneumo nitis but with mi nimal 
(Grade 1) symptom s may  cont inue CC -122 wi thout dose al terati on. For drug -related Grade 2 
pneumo nitis, CC -122 and nivo lumab treatm ent shoul d be interrupted and corticosteroids may be 
indicated. Once symptoms have resolved to Grade 0 or 1, CC -122 may b e reintroduced at the 
next lower dose level. F or drug -related Grade s3 or 4 pneumonit is,CC-122 and nivo lumab must 
be permanent ly discontinued and corticosteroids are recommended unt il clinical symptoms have 
resolved .
Pneumo nitis has been also observed in subjects taking nivo lumab. Pneumo nitis may be 
considered related to both IPs. Please refer to nivolumab SmPC(or Appendix H in Section 18.8)
for pneu monitis management guidelines in subjects receiving nivo lumab. 
7.10.4.6. Dose Modification and Management of Tumor Flare Reaction
Subjects in this study  shoul d be m onitored f or tumor flare.  Tum or flare react ion (TFR) i s 
defined as a sudden and tender incr ease in the size of the di sease -bearing sites, including the 
lymph nodes, spleen and/or the liver ,often acco mpanied by  low-grade fever, and non
-pruri tic 
diffuse rash.  Tum or flare usually occurs wi thin the first cy cle of treatm ent.  Tum or flare react ion 
may mimic progressi on of  disease; however ,the TFR will generally  subside over time.  
Therefore, careful mo nitoring and evaluat ion is important prior to discontinuing a study  subject 
for PD in the ini tial cycles of CC -122 therapy .
There are currently no laboratory  or radi ological tests that di stinguish TFR fro m PD.  The 
distinction shoul d be m ade on clinical grounds, incorporating observat ions such as associated 
physical findings, laboratory  findings, and pace of disease before and after inst itution of  
treatment.  T umor flare will be recorded as an AE (graded using the NCI CTCAE versio n3.0 
criteria) and not as PD.
Treatment of the TFR is up to the discretion of the investigator depending on the severit y and 
clinical situat ion.  In mild to moderate cases (Grade s 1to2), it is suggested that CC -122 be 
continued alo ng with symptomat ic treatment such as nonsteroidal ant i-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs )and/or narcotics. Corticosteroids can be administered at the invest igator ’s discret ion.  
In more severe cases (Grade 3 to 4), CC-122 and/or nivo lumab shoul d be interrupted and therapy  
with corti costeroi ds shoul d be init iated. NSAIDs and/or narcotics may also be used at the 
investigator’s discre tion. When symptom s reso lve to ≤ Grade 1, CC -122 and/or nivo lumab can 
be restarted a t the sam e dose l evel.

7.10.4.8. Management of Dermatological Toxicity
Rash is a toxicit y which has been previously  observed wi th CC-122 therapy . Addi tionally, 
derm atological toxicity (rash and pr uritis) is a documented immune related adverse event 
associ ated wi th checkpo int inhibitors . Init ial treatment options may include t opical corti costeroi d 
creams and oral ant iprurit ics. For Grade 3 rash, drug should be interrupted and treatment with 
oral corti costeroi ds m ay be warranted ( Postow, 2015 ).
For G rade 2 toxicit y, both drugs m ay be wi thheld and tr eatment with topical corticosteroids 
initiated with considerat ion for systemic corticosteroids if there is no improvement in symptoms 
within 1 week. Therapy  may be continued if invo lvement of < 30% of body  surface area, are 
asymptomat ic, or toxicit y can be managed wi th topical corti costeroi d creams and ant iprurit ics 
(Villadolid, 2015).
7.10.5. Management of Expected AEs While Receiving Nivolumab
Please refer to nivolumab SmPC (or Appendix H in Section 18.8)for addi tional guidelines on
nivolumab toxicity management, or refer to the current local label.
7.11. Definition of an Overdose
Overdose, as define d for thi s protocol , refers to CC -122 and nivolumab dosing.
On a per dose basis, an overdose is defined as the following amount over the protocol -specified 
doses of CC -122 and/or nivolumab assigned to a given subject, regardless of any  associated 
adverse e vents or sequelae.
Orally  (PO)any amount over the protocol -specified dose
Intravenously  (IV)10% over the protocol -specified dose
On a schedule or frequency  basis, an overdose i s defined as any thing more frequent than the 
protocol  requi red schedule or fre quency .
On a n infusio n rate basis , an overdose i s defined as any rate faster than the ratespecified in the 
local label . 
Com plete data about drug administration, including any  overdose, regardl ess of whether the 
overdose was accidental or intent ional, sho uld be reported in the case report form.  See Section 
10.1 for the reporting of AEs associ ated wi th overdose.

Treatment may be interrupted until treatment -related toxici ty reaches ei ther ≤ Grade 1or 
baseline levels.  Treatment may re start ei ther at the sam e, or a reduced, dose level, at the 
Invest igator’s discret ion as described in Sect ion 7.10.
7.13. Packaging and Labeling
The l abel(s ) for CC -122 and nivo lumab will include sponsor name, address and telephone
number, the protocol number, drug name, dosage form and strength (where applicable), amount 
of IPper con tainer, l ot number, expi ry date (where applicable), medicat ion ident ificat ion/ki t 
number, dosing instructions, storage condit ions, and required caut ion statem ents and/or 
regul atory  statements as applicable. Addit ional inform ation may be included on the label as 
applicable per local regulat ions.
7.14. Investigational Product Accountabi lity and Disposal
Celgene (or desi gnee) will review wit h the Invest igator and relevant site personnel the process 
for IPreturn, disposal, and/or destruction including responsibilit ies for the si te versus Celgene 
(or designee).
7.15. Investigational Product Comp liance
Only the pharmacist or the Invest igator’s designee will dispense CC-122.   A record of the 
number of capsules dispensed to and taken by  each subject m ust be m aintained. The pharmacist 
or the invest igator’s designee will document the dose dispensed in the appropri ate study  records.
Subjects will use weekly  diary  cards to record their daily self -administration of CC -122 at home.  
These will be reviewed by  study  staff each time the subject visits the clinic.  Entries will be 
clarified, as necessary , so t hat appropriate informatio n can be captured on the eCRFs.  Study  site 
personnel will perform a CC -122 administration compliance check and record this information 
on the subject’s source documentation and on the appropriate eCRF.
Accurate recording o f nivolumab IV administration will be made in the appropriate section of the 
subject ’s eCRF and source documents. The invest igator or designee is responsible for accounting 
for all study -specific IP sboth administered or in their custody  during the course of the study .

9.1. Overview
The primary  object ives of this Phase 1/2, multicenter, open -label, dose finding stud yare to 
determine the safet y and tol erabili ty of CC-122 when administered orally  in combinat ion with 
nivolumab , to define the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and to determine the p reliminary
efficacy ofCC-122 in co mbinatio nwit hnivolumab based on RECIST 1.1(Eisenhauer, 2009 ).
Data summaries/statistical analyses will be performed by study  part, dose l evel/ dosing regimen 
and/orHCC etiology as needed or applicable .
9.2. Study Population Definitions
The study  popul ation definit ions are as fo llows:
Enrolled Population –All subjects who meet all the inclusio n/exclusion criteria and 
are eligible for the study .
Treated Populat ion –All subjects who enroll and take at least one dose of either IP 
(CC- 122 or nivolumab).
Dose limit ing toxicit yevaluable popul ation: defined in Sect ion 7.3
Efficacy Evaluable (EE) Populat ion –All s ubjects who enroll and meet eligibilit y 
criteria and receive at least 50% of both assigned IPin the first 2 cycles, have a 
baseline efficacy (tumor) assessment, and at least one post -baseline efficacy (tumor) 
assessment.
Pharmacokinet ic (PK) Evaluable Pop ulation –All subjects who enroll and receive at 
least one dose of either IPand have at least one measurable concentration of CC-122
or nivolumab.
Biomarker Evaluable (BE) Populat ion –all subjects who enroll and take at least one 
dose of either IP, and ha ve at l east 1
non-missing bio marker assessment, excluding 
the disqualified assessments.
9.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations
During the dose escalat ion part(Phase 1 ) of the study , a m odified 3+3 dose escalation design 
(Storer, 1989 ) will be used to ident ify initial toxicit y of the combinat ions as described in 
Secti on7.2and up to approximately 20 subjects will be e nrolled depending on the number and 
size of dose cohorts evaluated. 
During the dose expansio n part(Phase 2 ), 30additio nal subjects will be enro lled to anexpansio n 
cohorts of mixed HCC et iology(HBV, HCV and non -viral).  The sample size is not determined 
based on power calculat ion but rather on clinical, empirical and pract ical considerat ions 
traditionally used for exploratory  studi es of  this kind.  If the response rate is 20% or more, there 
will be more than a 95% chance that one or m ore responders would be observed in the first 14 
subjects (Gehan, 1961).  If no responder is observed out of 14 subjects, the enro llment for the 
expansio n cohort will stop for fut ility.  Otherwi se, the cohort will be expanded to up to 
approximately  30 subjects .  Enrollment will cont inue during the evaluat ion of the init ial 14

Full details on the efficacy analysis are described in the SAP.
9.7. Safety Analysis
Allsummaries of safe tydata will be conducted using subjects receiving at least one dose of 
either IP(theTreated Popula tion).
Adverse events observed will be classified using the Medical Dict ionary for Regulatory  
Activities (MedDRA). The severit y of the toxi cities will  be graded according to the NCI 
CTCAE (Version 4.03) whenever possible. The frequencies of adverse events will be tabulated 
by MedDRA (Version 17.1 or higher) SOC and PT.  In the by -subject analysis, a subject having 
the sam e AE m ore than once will be counted only once.  Adverse events will also be summarized 
by NCI CTCAE gra de.  Invest igational product -related AEs, AEs leading to dose 
reducti on/interrupti on,or perm anent discont inuat ion of study  treatm ent, events cl assified as 
CTCAE Grade 3 or 4, deaths, and SAEs will be tabulated.  By -subject list ings of all AEs, deaths, 
serious AEs (SAEs) and their attribution will be provided.
Clinical laboratory  resul ts will be summarized descript ively, which will include a display of 
change from baseline. Bidirectional shift tables (low and high) demonstrating the change of 
CTCAE grades f rom baseline to the worst post -baseline severit y grade during the treatment 
period will also be presented for applicable tests.  Listings of abnormal clinical laboratory data 
according to NCI CTCAE severit y grades (if applicable), abnormal flags (low or hi gh) will be

9.9.1. Assessment of Pharmacokinetics
Blood will be collected according to intensive and sparse sampling strategies to estimate the 
popul ation PK of CC -122 when administered in combinat ion with nivo lumab.
Noncom partmental analyses will be perfo rmed using Phoenix WinNonlin Versio n 6.3 (Pharsight 
Corp., Mount ain View, CA). The fo llowing PK m easurements will be determined for CC -122 in 
subjects wi th intensive PK sampling:
Area under the plasma concentration time -curve (AUC).
Peak (maximum) plasma concentration (C max).
Terminal half -life (t 1/2).
Time to maximum plasma concentration (T max).
Apparent total body clearance (CL/F).
Apparent volume o f distribut ion (Vz/F).
Sparse serum concentrations of nivolumab will be evaluated after the first dose administration 
with nivolumab and at steady  state.  Sparse concentrations of nivolumab will be summarized by  
descript ive statistics by cohort, visit and no minal t ime.  If warranted, the impact of CC -122 on 
target mediated disposit ion of nivolumab willbe assessed by  non-mixed effect m odeling 
(NMEM) com partm ent approach.
Descript ive statistics (N, mean, standard deviat ion, coefficient of variat ion (CV%), geometric 
mean, geometric CV%, median, min imum , and max imum ) for plasma concentration and PK 
param eters will  be provi ded.  Correl ations of drug exposure with safet y, PD and clinical 
endpo ints may also be analyzed as exploratory  endpoints.  Resul ts will be presented in tabular

10.1. Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may 
appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study . It m ay be a new intercurrent illness, a 
worsening conco mitant illness, an injury , or any  concomi tant impairment of the subject’s health, 
including laboratory  test val ues (as specified by the criteria in Sect ion 10.3), regardless of 
etiology. Any  worsening (i e, any clinically  significant adverse change in the frequency  or 
intensity of a pre -exist ing condit ion) should be considered an AE.  A diagnosis or syndro me 
shoul d be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF rather than t he individual signs or symptoms of 
the diagnosis or syndrome.
Abuse, wi thdrawal , sensi tivity or toxi city to an IP shoul d be reported as an AE. Overdose, 
accidental  or intent ional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be reported on the 
overdo se eCRF. (See Secti on7.11 for the definit ion of overdose.) Any sequela of an accidental 
or intent ional overdose of an IPshoul d be reported as an AE on the AE eCRF. If the sequela of 
an overdose is an SAE, then the sequela must be reported on an SAE report form and on the AE 
eCRF. The overdose resulting in the SAE should be ident ified as the cause o f the event on the 
SAE report form and eCRF but s hould not be reported as an SAE itself.
In the event of overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive 
supportive measures as necessary . There is no known specific ant idote for CC-122 overdose. 
Actual  treatm ent shoul d depend on the severi ty of the clinical situation and the judgment and 
experience o f the treating physician .
All subjects will be mo nitored for AEs during the study .  Assessments may include monitoring 
of any or all o f the following param eters:  the subject’s clinic al symptom s, laboratory , 
pathol ogical, radi ological or surgical  findings, physical examinat ion findings, or findings from 
other tests and/or procedures.
All AEs will be recorded by  the Investi gator f rom the time the subject signs informed consent 
until 28 days after the l ast dose of CC -122 and unt il 90 days after the l ast dose of nivo lumab and 
those SAEs made known to the invest igator at any  time thereafter that are sus pected of being 
related to CC -122 or nivo lumab.  Adverse event s and SAEs will be recorded on the AE page of 
the eCRF and in the subject’s source documents.  All SAEs must be reported to Celgene Drug 
Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event by  facsimile, or other 
appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
10.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events
A qualified Invest igator will evaluate all adverse events as to:
10.2.1. Seriousness
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE occurring at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatenin g (ie, in the opinio n of the Invest igator, the subject is at immediate 
risk of death fro m the AE);
EDMS Doc. Number: 22132024 - 20879383CC-122
Protocol  CC-122- HCC - 002 Celgene Corporati on
Confident ial and Propri etary 81 CC-122-HCC -002 Amendment 2 Final: 29 Aug 2017Requi res inpat ient hospi talizat ion or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talizati on 
(hospi talizat ion is defined as an inpatient admissio n, regardl ess of l ength of stay);
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y (a substant ial disrupt ion of the 
subject’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions);
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect;
Const itutes an important medical event.
Important m edical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death, hospitalizat ion, or disabilit y, but may  jeopardi ze the subject or 
requi re medical or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be 
considered serious.
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospitalizations for:
A standard procedure for protocol therapy  administrati on.  However, hospitalizat ion
or prol onged hospitalizat ion for a com plicat ion of therapy administration will be 
reported as an SAE.
Routine treatment or monitoring o f the studi ed indicati on not associ ated wi th any 
deteri oration in condit ion.
The administration of blood or platelet tra nsfusio n as routine treatment of studied 
indicat ion.  However, hospitalizat ion or prolonged hospitalization for a complication 
of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE.
A procedure for protocol/disease -related invest igatio ns (eg, surgery , scans, 
endosc opy, sam pling for l aboratory  tests, bone m arrow sam pling).  However, 
hospi talizati on or prol onged hospitalizat ion for a com plicat ion of such procedures 
remains a reportable SAE.
Hospitalization or prolongat ion of hospitalizat ion for technical, practical, o r social 
reasons, in absence of an AE.
A procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to starting of treatment on study ); must 
be docum ented in the source document and the eCRF.  Hospitalizat ion or prolonged 
hospi talizati on for a com plicati on remains a rep ortable SAE.
An elect ive treatment of or an elect ive procedure for a pre -exist ing condit ion 
unrelated to the studied indicat ionthat has no worsened fro m baseline.
Emergency  outpati ent treatm ent or observat ion that does not result in admissio n, 
unless fulf illing other seriousness criteria above.
If an AE i s considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the eCRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed.
For each SAE, the Invest igator will provide information on severit y, start and stop dates, 
relationship to CC-122 and nivo lumab, acti on taken regarding both IPs, and outcome.

For both AEs and SAEs, the Invest igator must assess the severit y / intensi ty of the event.
The severit y / intensi ty of AEs will  be graded based upon the subject’s s ymptom s according to 
the current active minor versio n of the NCI CTCAE (Version 4.03), whenever possible:
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40
AEs that are not defined in the NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03 ,(eg tumor f lare reaction) shoul d be 
evaluated for severit y/intensity according to Version 3.0):
Otherwi se, the following scale should be used:
Grade 1 = Mild –transi ent or mild disco mfort; no limitat ion in act ivity; no m edical  
intervent ion/therapy  requi red
Grade 2 = Moderate –mild to moderate limitat ion in activity, som e assistance may  be needed; no 
or minimal medical intervent ion/therapy  requi red
Grade 3 = Severe –marked limitat ion in act ivity, som e assistance usually required; medical 
intervent ion/therapy  requi red, hospi talizati on is possible
Grade 4 = Life threatening –extrem e limi tation in activit y, significant assistance required; 
significant medical intervent ion/therapy  requi red, hospi talizati on or hospice care probable
Grade 5 = Death -the event results in death
The term  “severe” is often used to describe the intensit y of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarct ion); the event itself, however, may be of relat ively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache).  This criterion is not the sam e as “serious” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or funct ioning.
Seriousness, not severit y, serves as a gui de for defining regul atory  obligat ions.
10.2.3. Causality
The Investigator must determine the relat ionship between the administration o f CC-122 and 
nivolumab and the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: Means a causal relat ionship of the adverse event to IP
administration is unlikely or remote , or other m edicat ions, 
therapeuti c intervent ions, or underlying condit ions provide a 
sufficient explanat ion for the observed event.
Suspected: Means there is a reasonable possibility that the administration 
of IPcaused the adverse event.  ‘Reasonable possibilit y’ means 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship between the 
IPs and the adverse event.
Causalit y shoul d be assessed and provided for every  AE/SA E based on currently available 
inform ation.  Causalit y is to be reassessed and provided as addit ional inform ation beco mes 
available.

Protocol  CC-122- HCC - 002 Celgene Corporati on
Confident ial and Propri etary 83 CC-122-HCC -002 Amendment 2 Final: 29 Aug 2017If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or addit ional IP
that has not been manufac tured or provi ded by Celgene, please provide the name of the 
manufacturer when reporting the event.
10.2.4. Duration
For both AEs and SAEs, the Invest igator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the 
event.
10.2.5. Action Taken
The Investigator will report t he action taken with CC-122 and nivo lumab as a result of an AE or 
SAE, as applicable ( eg, discont inuat ion, interruption, or reduction of either IP, as appropriate) 
and report if conco mitant and/or addit ional treatm ents were given for the event.
10.2.6. Outcome
Theinvest igator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs.
All SAEs that have not resolved upon discont inuatio n of the subject’s participat ion in the study  
must be fo llowed until recovered, recovered with sequelae, not recovered or death (du e to the 
SAE).
10.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values
An abnormal laboratory  value is considered to be an AE ifthe abnorm ality:
resul ts in discont inuat ion from the study;
requi res treatm ent, m odificat ion/ interruption of either IPdose, or any other 
therapeuti c intervent ion; or
is judged to be of significant clinical importance , eg, one that indicates a new disease 
process and/or organ toxicit y, or is an exacerbat ion or worsening of an exist ing 
condi tion.
Regardless of severit y grade, only  laboratory  abnorm alities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a n SAE.
If a laboratory  abnorm ality is one com ponent of a di agnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF.  If the abnormalit y was not 
a part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory  abnorm ality shoul d be recorded as the AE. 
If possible, the laboratory  abnorm ality should be recorded as a medical term and not simply  as an 
abnorm al laboratory  resul t (eg, record thrombocy topeni a rather than decreased platelets).
10.4. Pregnancy
All pregnancies or suspect ed pregnancies occurring in eit her a female subject of childbearing 
potenti alor female partner of a male subject are immediately reportable events.
In the event, of a pregnancy occurring in a female subject of childbearing potential or female 
partner of t he male subject, Celgene Drug Safet y will fo llow up with the clinical invest igator 
each trimester of the pregnancy and for 1 y ear following the birth of the infant (if applicable).

Protocol  CC-122- HCC - 002 Celgene Corporati on
Confident ial and Propri etary 84 CC-122-HCC -002 Amendment 2 Final: 29 Aug 2017Please reference the informed consent (permissio n) forms for data collect ion regarding the 
pregnancy of a female subject participat ing in a Celgene sponsored study, the pregnancy of a 
female partner of a male subject participat ing in a Celgene sponsored study and the pregnancy o f 
a non -subject pregnant female.  In all scenarios, data collect ion will occur each trimester of the 
pregnancy and for 1 y ear after bi rth of  infant (if applicable).  
The exposure of any  non-subject pregnant female (eg, caregiver, pharmacist, study  coordinator 
or monitor) to CC -
122is also an immediately r eportabl e event.
10.4.1. Females of Childbearing Potential
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including elevated -βhCG and/or a posit ive pregnancy 
test in a female subject of childbearing potential regardless of disease state) occurring while the 
subject is on CC-122, or wi thin 28 days of the subject’s l ast dose of CC-122, or wi thin 5 months
of the l ast dose of nivo lumab are considered immediately reportable events.  CC-122 and 
nivolumab are to be di scont inued immediately. The subject will be instructed to return any 
unused CC -122 to the Invest igator .The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy 
test m ust be reported to Celgene Drug Safet y immediately by facsimile, or other appropriate 
method, using the Pregnancy Init ial Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  The female 
subject should be referred to her obstetrician -gynecol ogist,
preferably one experienced in
reproducti ve toxi city for further evaluat ion and counseling.
The Investigator will fo llow the female subject until co mpletion of the pr egnancy , and m ust 
notify Celgene Drug Safet y immediately  about the outcom e of the pregnancy  (either norm al or 
abnorm al outcom e) using the Pregnancy  Follow
-up Report Form , or approved equivalent form.
In the event, of a pregnancy occurring in a female subje ct of childbearing potential, Celgene will 
follow up wi th the clinical investigator each trimester of the pregnancy and for 1 y ear following 
the birth of the infant (if applicable). Any fo llow-up informat ion or outcome informat ion must be 
reported to Celge ne Drug Safet y immediately. 
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal ( eg, spontaneous abortion), the Invest igator 
shoul d report the abnorm al outcom e as an AE.  If the abnormal outcome meets any  of the seri ous 
criteria, i t must be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safet y by facsimile, or other appropriate 
method, within 24 hours of the Invest igator’s knowledge o f the event using the SAE Report 
Form , or approved equivalent form.
All neonatal  deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported, without regard to 
causalit y, as SAEs.  In addit ion, any infant death after 28 day s that the Invest igator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure CC-122 or nivo lumab shoul d also be reported to Celgene Drug 
Safety by facsimile, or other appropriate meth od, wi thin 24 hours of the Invest igator’s 
knowl edge of the event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
10.4.2. Male Subjects
If a female partner of a male subject taking IPbecomes preg nant while the male subject is still 
receiving treatment or within 90 days of the male subject’s last dose of CC-122, the m ale subject 
taking CC -122 and nivo lumab shoul d notify  the Investi gator, and the pregnant female partner 
shoul d be advised to call their healt hcare provider immediately .

Protocol  CC-122- HCC - 002 Celgene Corporati on
Confident ial and Propri etary 85 CC-122-HCC -002 Amendment 2 Final: 29 Aug 2017In the event, of a pregna ncy occurring in a female partner of the male subject, Celgene will 
follow up wi th the clinical investigator each trimester of the pregnancy and for 1 y ear following 
the birth of the infant (if applicable). Any fo llow-up informat ion or outcome informat ion must be 
reported to Celgene Drug Safet y immediately.
10.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the complet ion of an SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF.  All SAEs must be reported to 
Celgene Drug Safet y within 24 hours of the Invest igator’s knowledge of the event by facsimile, 
or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  This 
instructi on pertains to init ial SAE reports as wel l as any fo llow-up reports.
The Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.  
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relat ionship to CC-122 or nivo lumab) that 
occur during the study  (from the time the subject signs informed consent until 28 days after the 
last dose of CC-122 or until 90 days after the last dose of nivo lumab ) or any  SAE m ade known 
to the Invest igator at any time thereafter that are suspect ed of being related to either IP.  Serious 
adverse events 
occurring prior to treatment (after signing the ICF) will be captured.
The SAE report should provide a detailed descript ion of the SAE and include a concise summary 
of hospi tal records and other rel evant docum ents.  If a subject died and an autopsy  has been 
perform ed, copi es of  the autopsy  report and death certificate are to be sent to Celgene Drug 
Safety as soon as these beco me available.  Any fo llow-up data should be detailed in a subsequent 
SAE Re port F orm, or approved equivalent form, and sent to Celgene Drug Safet y.
Where required by  local legislat ion, the Invest igator is responsible for informing the I nstitutional 
Review Board (IRB) /Ethics Committee (E C)of the SAE and providing them wit h all r elevant 
initial and fo llow-up informati on about the event. The Investigator must keep copies of all SAE 
inform ation on file including corresponden ce wi th Celgene and the IRB/EC.
10.5.1. Safety Queries
Queri es pertaining to SAEs will be co mmunicated fro m Celgene Drug Safet y to the si te via 
facsimile or electronic mail.  The response time is expected to be no more than five (5) business 
days.  Urgent queries ( eg, missing causalit y assessment) m ay be handled by phone.
10.6. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events
For the purp ose of regulatory  reporting, Cel gene Drug Safet y will determine the expectedness of 
events suspected of being related to CC -122 based on the Invest igator Brochure .Celgene Drug 
Safety will determine the expectedness of events suspected of being related to nivolumab based 
on the Sm PC.
In the U S, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be reported in an 
expedited manner in accordance wit h 21 CFR 312.32.
For countri es wi thin the European Economic Area (EEA), Celgene or its authorized 
representative will report in an expedited manner to Regulatory  Authori ties and Ethi cs 
Committees concerned, suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) in accordance 
with Directive 2001/20/EC and the Detailed Guidance on collection, verificat ion and

for human use (ENTR/CT3) and also in accordance with country -specific requirements.
Events of disease progressi on for the di sease under study  (includi ng deaths due to di sease
progression for indications that are considered to be fatal) will be assessed as expected adverse
events and will not be reported as expedited safet y reports to regulatory  authori ties.
Celgene or i ts authori zed representative shall notify  the Invest igator of the fo llowing 
inform ation:
Any AE suspected of being related to the use of CC-122 in this study  or in other 
studi es that i s both seri ous and unexpected (i e, SUSAR ).
Any finding fro m tests i n laboratory  animals that suggests a si gnificant risk for 
human subjects including reports of mutagenicit y, teratogeni city, or carcinogenicit y.
Where required by  local legislat ion, the Invest igator shall notify his/her IRB/EC promptly o f 
these new serious and unexpected AE(s) or significant ris ks to subjects.
The Investigator must keep copies of all pert inent safet y informat ion on file including 
correspondence with Celgene and the IRB/EC.  (See Section 14.3 for record retention

13.1. Good Clinical Practice
The procedures set out in this study  protocol  pertaining to the conduct, evaluat ion, and 
docum entati on of  this study  are desi gned to ensure that Celgene, its authorized representative, 
and Invest igator abide by Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as described in (ICH) Guideline E6 and 
in accordance wit h the general ethical principles outlined in the Declaration o f Helsinki. The 
study  will receive approval from an IRB/EC prior to commencement. The Invest igator will 
conduct all aspects of this study in accordance with applicable national, state, and local laws of 
the pertinent regulatory  authori ties.
13.2. Investigator Responsibilities
Invest igator responsibilit ies are set out in the ICH Guideline for GCP and in the local 
regul ations. Celgene staff or an authorized representative will evaluate and approve all 
Invest igators who in turn will select their staff.
The Investigator should ensure that all persons assisting wit h the study  are adequately  informed 
about the protocol , amendments, study  treatm ents, as well as study -related duti es and funct ions, 
including obligat ions of confident iality of Celgene informat ion. The Invest igator should maintain 
a list of Sub -invest igators and other appropriately qualified p ersons to whom he or she has 
delegated si gnificant study -related duti es.
The Investigator is responsible for keeping a record of all subjects who sign an ICF and are 
screened for entry  into the study . Subj ects who fail screening must have the reason(s) rec orded in 
the subject’s source documents.
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to subject records (eg, 
medical records, offic e charts, hospi tal charts, and study -related charts) for source data 
verification. The Investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion o f eCRFs and queries.
The informat ion contained in the protocol and amendments (with the except ion of the 
information provi ded by  Celgene on public registry  websi tes) i s considered Celgene confident ial 
inform ation.  Only  information that i s previ ously  discl osed by  Celgene on a public registry  
website may be freely disclosed by the Invest igator or its inst itution, or as outlined in the Clinical 
Trial Agreement.  Cel gene protocol , amendment and IB informat ion is not to be made publicly 
available (for example on the Investigator’s or their inst itution’s website) without express written 
approval  from Celgene. Inform ation proposed for posting on the Invest igator’s or their 
institution’s website must be submitted to Celgene for review and approval, providing at least 5 
business days for review.
At the time results of this study  are m ade available to the public, Celgene will provi de 
Invest igators with a summary o f the resul ts that i s wri tten for the lay  person.  The Invest igator is 
responsible for sharing these results wit h the subject and/or their caregiver as agreed by the

Confident ial and Propri etary 90 CC-122-HCC -002 Amendment 2 Final: 29 Aug 201713.3. Subject Information and Informed Consent
The Investi gator m ust obtain informed consent of a subject and/or a subject’s legal representative 
prior to any  study  related procedures.
Docum entati on that inform ed consent occurred prior to the study  subject’s entry  into the study  
and of the informed conse nt process should be recorded in the study subject’s source documents 
including the date. The original ICF signed and dated by the study  subject and by the person 
consent ing the study subject prior to the study subject’s entry into the study, must be maint ained 
in the Invest igator’s study  files and a copy  given to the study  subject. In addi tion, if a protocol  is 
amended and i t impacts on the content of the informed consent, the ICF must be revised. Study  
subjects participat ing in the study  when the am ended protocol is implemented must be re -
consented with the revised versio n of theICF.  The revised ICF signed and dated by  the study  
subject and by the person consent ing the study  subject m ust be m aintained in the Invest igator’s 
study  files and a copy  given to the study  subject.
13.4. Confidentiality
Celgene affi rms the subject's ri ght to protection against invasio n of privacy  and to be in 
compliance wi th ICH and other l ocal regul ations (whichever i s most stringent). Celgene requires 
the Invest igator to permit Celgen e's representatives and, when necessary , representatives from 
regul atory  authori ties, to review and/or copy  any medical records relevant to the study  in 
accordance with local laws.
Shoul d direct access to m edical records require a waiver or authorization s eparate from the 
subject’s signed ICF , it is the responsibilit y of the Invest igator to obtain such permissio n in 
writing fro m the appropri ate individual.
13.5. Protocol Amendments
Any amendment to this protocol must be approved by  the Celgene Clinical Research 
Physician/Medical Monitor. Amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC for written approval. 
Written approval  must be obtained before implementation of the amended versio n occurs. The 
written si gned approval  from the IRB/EC shoul d specifically  reference the Investi gator nam e, 
protocol  number, study  title and amendment number(s) that is applicable. Amendments that are 
administrative in nature do not require IRB/IEC approval but will be submitted to the IRB/IEC 
for inform ation purposes.
13.6. Institutional Review Boa rd/Independent Ethics Committee Review 
and Approval
Before the start of the study , the study  protocol , ICF, and any  other appropri ate docum ents will 
be submitted to the IRB/EC with a cover letter or a form list ing the documents submitted, their 
dates of is sue, and the si te (or regi on or area of jurisdiction, as applicable) for which approval is 
sought. If applicable, the documents will also be submitted to the authorit ies in accordance with 
local legal  requirements.

a list o f the members of the IRB/EC and their occupation and qualificat ions. If the IRB/EC will 
not disclose the names, occupations and qualificat ions of the committee members, it should be 
asked to i ssue a statement confirming that the composit ion of the committe e is in accordance 
with GCP. For exam ple, the IRB General Assurance Number may be accepted as a subst itute for 
this list. Form al approval  by the IRB/EC shoul d ment ion the protocol tit le, number, amendment 
number (if applicable), study  site (or regi on or ar ea of jurisdiction, as applicable), and any other 
docum ents reviewed. It must ment ion the date on which the decisio n was made and must be 
officially signed by  a commi ttee m ember. Before the first subject is enrolled in the study , all 
ethical and l egal requ irements m ust be m et.
The IRB/EC and, if applicable, the authorities, must be informed of all subsequent protocol 
amendments in accordance wit h local legal requirements. Amendments must be evaluated to 
determine whether formal approval must be sought and w hether the ICF should also be revised.
The Investigator must keep a record of all co mmunicat ion with the IRB/EC and, if applicable, 
between a Coordinat ing Invest igator and the IRB/EC. This statement also applies to any  
communicat ion between the Invest igato r (or Coordinat ing Investigator, if applicable) and 
regul atory  authori ties.
Any advertisements used to recruit subjects for the study  must be reviewed by Celgene and the
IRB/EC prior to use.
13.7. Ongoing Information for Institutional Review Board / Ethics
Committee
If required by  legislat ion or the IRB/EC, the Investigator must submit to the IRB/EC:
Inform ation on serious or unexpected adverse events as soon as possible;
Periodic reports on the progress of the study;
Deviat ions from  the protocol  or any thing that may  involve added risk to subjects.
13.8. Termination of the Study
Celgene reserves the ri ght to terminate this study  prem aturely  at any  time for reasonable medical 
or administrative reasons. Any  premature discont inuat ion will be appropriately documented 
according to local requirements (eg, IRB/EC, regulatory  authori ties, etc.).
In addit ion, the Invest igator or Celgene has the right to discont inue a single site at any  time 
during the study  for medical  or administrative reasons such as:
Unsat isfactory  enro llment;
Good clinical pract icenonco mpliance;
Inaccurate or inco mplete data collect ion;
Falsificat ion of records;
Failure to adhere to the study  protocol .

All aspects of the study  will be carefully mo nitored by  Celgene or i ts authori zed representative 
for com pliance wi th applicable government regulatio ns with respect to current GCP and SOPs. 
15.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification
Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after 
the study . All aspects of the study  are reviewed wit h the Invest igator and the staff at a study  
initiation visit and/or at an Invest igator’s Meeting. Prior to enrolling subjects into the study , a 
Celgene representati ve will review the protocol, eCRFs, procedures for ob taining informed 
consent, record keeping, and reporting of AE s/SAEs wi th the Invest igator. Monitoring will 
include on -site visi ts with the Investi gator and his/her staff as well as any  appropri ate 
communicat ions by mail, email, fax, or telephone. During monitoring visits, the facilit ies, 
investigat ional product stor age area, eCRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study  
docum entati on will be inspected/reviewed by  the Cel gene representati ve in accordance wit h the 
Study  Moni toring Pl an.
Accuracy  will be checked by performing source data verificat ion that i s a direct com parison of 
the entries made onto the eCRFs against the appropriate source documentation. Any result ing 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the Investigator and/or his/her staff. Any  necessary  
correcti ons will be made direct ly to the eCRFs or via queri es by the Invest igator and/or his/her 
staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed consents, adherence to inclusio n/exclusion 
criteria and docum entati on of  SAEs and their proper recording be verified. Addit ional 
monitoring act ivities may be outl ined in a study -specific m onitoring pl an.
15.2. Audits and Inspections
In addit ion to the routine monitoring procedures, a GCP Qualit y Assurance unit exists within 
Celgene. Representatives of this unit will conduct audits of clinical research act ivitiesin 
accor dance with Celgene SOPs to evaluate compliance with GCP guidelines and regulat ions.
The Investigator is required to permit direct access to the facilit ies where the study  took place, 
source documents, eCRFs and applicable supporting records of study  subject participat ion for 
audits and inspect ions by IRB /ECs, regul atory  authori ties(eg, Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA ), European Medicines Agency ( EMA ), Health Canada) and company authorized 
representatives. The Invest igator should make every effort to be available for the audits and/or 
inspections. If the Investigator is contacted by  any regul atory  authori ty regarding an inspect ion, 
he/she shoul d contact Celgene immediately.

Summary  of Changes CC-122- HCC - 002 Celgene Corporati on
Confident ial and Propri etary 3 CC-122-HCC -002Amendment 2 Final: 29 Aug 20171. JUSTIFICATION FOR AM ENDMENT
Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
1.Per Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )request on I nvest igator Brochure (IB) Edition 
9, protocol  was update d to include standard Cytochrome P450 (CYP) interacti on 
language in alignment wi th all CC -122 studi es.
Revised Sect ions:  8.2.
2.Update s toexclusio n criteria. 
Exclusion criteria #1 was updated to exclude
all subjects who have had prior treatment 
with regorafenib. This change is based on the recent FDA approval of regorafenib for 
hepatocellular carcino ma (HCC )in the second line se tting in order to maintain the 
homogeneit y of the patient populat ion. 
Exclusio ncriteria #3 was updated to exclude any subjects with systemic therapy  in the 4 
weeks prior to starting invest igational product in order to allow for an appropriate wash 
out pe riod for any  prior therapi es. 
Exclusio n criteria #15h was changed from >100 pg/m L to >300 pg/mL to allow for 
inclusio n of subjects with brain natriuretic pept ide (BNP )between 100 -300 pg/mL with 
cardi ologist evaluat ion(specified under sect ion 15.h.a ). This change was made to allow 
subjects atlow cardi ac risk to be enrolled in the trial despite slight ly elevated BNP. This 
language was updated in alignment with exist ing wordi ng in other CC -122 protocols (eg,
CC-122- ST-001).
Revised Sect ions:  4.3.
3.Due to the incidence of rash (and subsequent dose limit ing toxicit ies) observed during the 
dose escalat ion porti on of  the study , language was added to the protocol to provide 
guidelines on the management of Grade 1 and Grade 2 rash. Rash isknown to be a
potenti al overl apping toxici ty between CC-122 and nivo lumab and these guidelines are 
being implemented to help mit igate the risk of these rashes reaching Grade 3 or higher.  
Revised Sect ions:  Table 6, Table 8, 7.10.4.8 (added) .
4.Per Cel gene protocol  template and Informed Consent Form (ICF) template ,update s to
pregnancy language asdefined by Drug Safet y for teratogenic co mpounds (including CC -
122). 
Revised Sect ions: 10.4, 10.4.1, 10.4.2.

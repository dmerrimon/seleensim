 Introduction and background  
The Baha SoundArc  coupling system has been developed as a non -surgical coupling of a 
Baha sound processor to the skull allowing the transfer of vibrational energy to the cochlear 
partition via bone conduction pathways. Today we offer two alternatives to this non- surgical 
approach; the Baha headband/test band and the Baha S oftband. Each of these current options 
have benefits and liabilities.  In the liability column, there is comfort and cosmetic concerns to consider. In the benefits column, there is need to provide a vehicl e to test a potential candidate 
with a bone conduction system prior to making final decisions regarding implantation of the Baha system. There is also a population ( under 5 years) where a need exists for Bone 
conduction amplification. Current approved clearance is f or children 5 years and older. This is 
due to less mature bone substrate and the act of osseointergration. There is also in a more 
limited group, a need for a non- surgical option for use of the Baha Bone conduction sound 
processor in candidates t hat cannot or will not accept a surgical implant.  
Currently , persons in need of this non- surgical coupling of a Baha sound processor had only to 
choose between the Headband/Test Band that is a spring steel appliance that holds the vibrating Baha sound proc essor in contact with the skull to access  the bone conduction 
pathway. Use of this appliance is acceptable in short -term wearing conditions but in practice is 
not always c omfortable for long -term wear. In addition to wearing comfort , there are often 
cosmet ic objections to wear ing this appliance long -term. A more comfortable option is the 
Baha Softband,  which is a latex -free elastic strap that contains a size adjustment buckle, a 
safety break -away connector and a force contact point where the B aha sound proc essor 
attaches. The original design intention of the Baha Softband was in the pediatric population.  
Older children and adults can also use this method of c oupling. However, the S oftband has a 
negative cosmetic appeal in this older child to adult patient pool.  
Due to the cosmetic and comfort issues , the team at Cochlear Bone Anchored Solutions 
(CBAS)  has produced the Baha SoundArc  seen below.

 Study Objective  
To evaluate patient experience when using the Baha SoundArc  after a one month take- home 
trial, compared to the existing Baha Softband on the Participant Take Home questionnaire in a 
group of 30 pediatric subject s. 
 Criteria for Subject Selection  
Cochlear Amer icas expects to enroll up to 30 patients  at up to 3 North American Baha implant 
centers. The duration of the multi -site study is expected to be up to 2 months , depending on 
subject recruitment.   
 Inclusion Criteria  
Subjects will have been fitted with the Baha Sound processor on a Softband  for a minimum 
of 3 months :  
o Aged 5 to 12 years  of age  
o Subjects should be able to perform clinical testing adapted for age and 
developmental status  (threshold sound field audiometry and basic monosyllabic 
word test s) 
o Willingness on behalf of the subject’s parent or guardian to complete study questionnaire 
 Exclusion Criteria  
Subject’s inability to perform requisite test measures as described in the study protocol  
 Methods and Procedures   
 Device description  
Cochlear™ Baha  sound processors to be used in this study may include commercially 
available Baha 3, Baha 4, or Baha 5 series processors. These devices need to have been 
previously fitted and worn by the subject for a minimum of three months on a Baha Softband.   
 Descrip tion of Test Measures  
 PBK Word Recognition Test  
The PBK Word Test (Haskins, 1949) is a validated test used clinically and in research to 
assess the speech perception performance of individuals with hearing aids,  cochlear implants , 
and bone anchored devices  on open- set word recognition. The test consists of 4 recorded lists 
of 50 monosyllabic words in CD format. For t his study, one list  will be administered in quiet at a 
level equal to 60dBA in the sound field and scored as total number of words correct, whi ch will

 be expressed as a percentage correct for this study. Subjects will be tested using a 
configuration of speech at 0º azimuth in quiet.  The non- test ear will be plugged for testing.  
 Audiometric Sound Field Threshold Test  Aided  
The Audiometric Sound Fi eld Threshold Test will be carried out using  narrow band noise 
stimuli at audiometric frequencies, 250Hz, 500Hz, 1000Hz, 2000Hz, 3000Hz, and 4000Hz  
using standard methods for threshold measurement that may be adapted for age and developmental level.  The n on-test ear will be plugged.  
 Unscheduled Visit  
If a subject requires an interim clinical visit, an Unscheduled Visit Form will be completed. Information collected will include reason for visit, activities completed and visit date.

 Data Storage and Confidentiality  
 Confidentiality  
A Case R eport Form (CRF) will be completed for each study subject, summarizing all clinical 
and study data. The CRF contains confidential material. Subjects will only be referred to in the 
CRF by their subject numbers in order to retain subject confidentiality. Specific instructions to complete the CRF shall be provided to the clinical investigation team as appropriate.  
Copies of the completed CRFs are to be provided to the Sponsor as soon as practical after completion and review. The original CRFs are to be retained by the Investigator for a period of time as determined by local regulations.  
 Subject Identification  
To maintain confidentiality, the subject’s name will not be recorded on any study document other than the informed consent form. All individuals who prov ide informed consent (sign the 
informed consent form) are considered consented into the study and will be assigned a unique identifier. A unique alphanumeric code will identify the subject throughout the course of the study. For example, US01- ARC- 0000, where:  
• US = United States  
• 01 = a sequential numeral corresponding the order in which a subject is enrolled into the 
study for a given study site, in this case this would correspond to the first subject 
recruited into the study for a particular site,  
• ARC = an abbreviation for the study, in this case “ARC ” for the  Baha SoundArc , 
• 0000 = a unique, numeric study site identification.  
 Release of Medical Information  
Subjects will be required to release the exchange of medical information between the Investigator(s) and the Sponsor. This requirement will be clearly identified in the Informed Consent form.  
 Risk Benefit Statement  
It is possible but  not guaranteed that a dvances in Baha  technology will improve performance 
via use of the Baha SoundArc . This clinical investigation will help to inform the future 
development of associated clinical guidance when fitting Baha  patients.  
 Risk Category  
As determined by the Sponsor , this study has been designated as non- significant risk. The 
Baha Softband/ SoundArc , and sound p rocessor  used in this study  are commercially cleared by 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is considered standard of care.

 Potential Risk and Protection against  Risks  
Subjects may experience discomfort while using the Baha SoundArc .  This could include, 
pressure at the temple piece, rash or itching.  These issues are usually resolved by adjustment 
of the position and tension of the SoundArc  bow.   
 Potential Benefits to Subjects  
Potential benefits to subjects may include improved wearing experience when using the Baha SoundArc . It cannot be promised that subjects will receive any medical benefits from 
participating  in this study.  
 Alternatives  to Participation  
In lieu of study partic ipation, patients may elect to continue standard clinical care and use of 
their Baha Sound Processor on the Baha Softband.   
  Subject identification, Recruitment, and Consent/Assent  
 Method of Subject Identification and Recruitment  
Subjects will be recruited into the study sequentially to ensure a subject pool representative of the general population of those with hearing loss, with no pre- selection based on age (other 
than being  between  5 and 12 years -of-age), ethnicity or gender as described in Section 2.0.  
The identification and recruitment of subjects will protect patient privacy and be free of undue influence.  
 Process of Consent  
Prior to recruitment of any subjects into the study, written approval of the i nvestigational plan 
including clinical protocol and informed consent form will be obtained from reviewing Institutional Review Board (IRB). An interview (as part of the informed consent process) will be conducted by the surgeon and/or audiologist to inform  the subject  about rationale for and the 
details, aims, objectives of the study, study expectations, evaluation schedule, and the risks and benefits of the trial treatment (and alternative treatments), and the extent of the patient’s involvement. Written i nformed consent shall be obtained from each subject after this 
explanation. After reviewing the Informed Consent Form, the subject  will be given the 
opportunity to review and ask questions about the Informed Consent Form and/or the study prior to signing t he Informed Consent Form. The subject will be offered the opportunity to take 
the form home to discuss with family members should they choose to do so. If they sign the Informed Consent Form, the subject twill then be given a copy of the signed Informed Consent 
Form to take home.

 The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all patients give written informed consent prior 
to any study -related examination or activity. All patients shall sign and date the Informed 
Consent Form, and a copy of the Infor med Consent Form shall be given to the patient.  The 
Sponsor and the Investigator(s) shall avoid improper influence on or inducement of the subject, monitor, the Investigator(s) or other parties participating in or contributing to the clinical investigation.   
 Subject Capacity  
Subjects participating in this study will have the capacity to provide informed consent as 
assessed by the Investigators. The only anticipated exception this is minors, for which assent will be obtained in addition to parental consent.  
 Subject/Representati ve Comprehension  
 Consent Forms  
The informed consent form provided for this study will meet requirements for specific sections as described in 21 CRF 50.25.  
 Documentation of Consent  
A subject  is not considered enrolled until a properly executed Informed Consent Form has 
been obtained and inclusion/exclusion information has been reviewed and approved by 
Cochlear Americas, as evidenced by the return of a study approval form signed by a Cochlear 
Americas representative.   
 Costs to the Subject  
There will be no cost to the study subjects participating in this study.  
 Payment for Participation  
Subjects will be paid $12.50/hour for study visits completed.  If a subject  withdraw s from the study 
before completing all study visits, they  will be compensated $12.50/hour for the study visits which 
were completed. In order to receive payment for participation, subjects wi ll need to complete a 
W-9 form, which is required because study payments for time are taxable.  
Subjects will be paid for t ransportation to and from the study visits at a rate of .52 cents per mile 
from home to visit and return.  Reimbursement for parking on the day of the study visit will also 
be provided.

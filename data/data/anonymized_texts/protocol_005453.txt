Confidential  Page 20 of 81  Lymphocyte trafficking agents such as the anti -
integrins natalizumab and vedolizumab, both administered intravenously , have demonstrated 
proof -of-concept in IBD indications  and are approved  for treatment of CD and both CD and 
UC, respectively . And more recently, RCP1063, an S1P 1 oral receptor modulator showed 
promising results in a Phase 2 study for ulcerative colitis. The availability of oral lymphocyte 
trafficking agents such as APD334 wou ld offer patients an additional, more convenient 
treatment for IBD.  
1.1 Background Information  
1.1.1  Rationale for Proposed Clinical Study  
UC is characterized by diffuse mucosal inflammation limited to the colon which involves the 
rectum in about 95% of cases and ma y extend proximally , typically  in a symmetrical, 
circumferential, and uninterrupted pattern , to involve parts or all of the large intestine .13 
Symptoms for UC can vary, depending on the location and severity of inflammation, but 
some of the most common are diarrhea, abdominal cramps and rectal bleeding. The hallmark 
clinical symptom is bloody diarrhea often with prominen t symptoms of rectal urgency and 
tenesmus .13 
S1P 1 receptor signaling on lymphocytes allows their exit from lymph node s along a S1P 
gradient. Functional antagonism of these S1P 1 receptors through agonist -mediated cellular 
internalization results in retention of certain  lymphocyte subpopulations in lymph nodes and 
prevents their egress to the periphery.  It is through this mechanism that APD334 may 
potentially reduce inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease.  Lymphocyte lowering has 
been correlated with clinical efficacy for S1P functional antag onists in multiple sclerosis, 
psoriasis, and ulcerative colitis. This same mechanism may also be useful in treating a variety 
of other  inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.  
This study is designed to evaluate  the long-term safety , tolerability  and efficacy of APD334 
in UC patients who have completed the APD334 -003 induction study .

will be classified using the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria.  
6.11.1  Adverse Event Reporting  
Patients will be instructed that they may report AEs at a ny time. All events reported 
following study medication administration will be recorded as treatment emergent AEs 
(TEAEs).  
Monitoring of ongoing AEs will be continued up to 30 days after study medication 
administration. In the event that an AE is not resol ved or stabilized by this time, the sponsor 
in consultation with the investigator will decide whether to continue to monitor the AE or 
close -out the event in the database if no further follow -up is necessary.  
For this study, an AE is defined as: “Any untow ard medical occurrence in a study patient 
administered any dose of the study medication APD334  and which does not necessarily have 
to have a causal relationship with this treatment.” An AE can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of the study medication, whether or not related to the 
product. AEs can be any of the following:  
• Unfavorable changes in general condition  
• Subjective or objective signs/sym ptoms  
• Concomitant disease or accidents  
• Clinically relevant adverse changes in laboratory parameters observed in a patient 
in the course of a clinical study  
• Pre-existing conditions which worsen in severity or frequency or which have new 
signs/symptoms assoc iated with them  
 
Adverse events will be elicited at the time indicated in the schedule by asking the question: 
“Since you were last asked, have you felt unwell or different from usual in any way?”  Any 
adverse or unexpected events, signs and symptoms, will  be fully recorded on the Adverse 
Event Form including details of intensity, onset, duration, outcome and relationship to the 
drug as determined by the PI.  Whenever possible, a constellation of signs and symptoms 
should be recorded as a unifying diagnosis  (e.g., self -limited fever, runny nose, cough, and 
scratchy throat should be captured as an upper respiratory infection rather than by the 
individual signs and symptoms). AEs may also be reported at any time. The type and 
duration of follow -up of patients after AEs will be documented.

(PML) after nearly 8 months of treatment with another S1P 1 agonist21, and  enablement of the 
John Cunningham (JC) virus is therefore a potential adverse effect of this therapeutic class. 
Patients in this trial should therefore be monitored for any new onset or worsening of

progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or 
clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation 
leading to confusion and personality changes.  The progression of deficits usually leads to 
death or severe disability over weeks or months. If PML is suspected, withhold dosing and 
refer to a neurologist; if confirmed, discontinue dosing permanently.  
The investigator or subinvestigator will administe r the subjective PML checklist.  The 
subjective PML checklist will be administered at each site visit to probe for symptoms 
suggestive of PML. Any patients reporting signs and/or symptoms of PML will undergo 
objective testing and may be referred to a neurol ogist for a full evaluation.  
A copy of the PML checklist is provided in Appendix 2 . 
6.11.2  Serious Adverse Events and Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events  
A Serious Adver se Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results 
in the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Is Life -Threatening  
• Required/Prolonged Hospitalization  
• Disability/Incapacity  
• Congenital Anomaly/Birth Defect  
• Important Medical Event  
SAEs will be captured from the time of ICF signature to 30 days after the last dose of study 
drug, and will be monitored until resolution or stabilization.  
An important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be c onsidered a SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it 
may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such a medical event includes allergic 
bronc hospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in in -patient hospitalization, or the development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Elective hospitalization and/or surgery for clear ly pre -existing conditions (for example a 
surgery that has been scheduled prior to the patient’s entry into the study) will not be 
reported as a SAE. All other hospitalizations, including elective hospitalizations for any 
condition that was not pre -existin g, will be reported as a SAE.   
Any AE considered serious by the investigator or which meets SAE criteria must be reported 
to PPD Pharmacovigilance (PVG) using the remote data capture (RDC) system within 
24 hours from the time study site personnel first le arn about the event . The following contact 
information is to be used for SAE reporting:

telephone, managing money, etc.  
**Self -care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, 
taking medications, and not bedridden.  
6.11.4  Assessment of Adverse Event Relationship to Study Medication  
The relationship of an AE to investigational product(s) will be classified using modified 
WHO criteria (Edwards and Biriell, World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for 
International Drug Monitoring 1994) as follows.  
Related :  a clinical event, incl uding laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or 
other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal 
(dechallenge). R echallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition; or an event 
that could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals where 
information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
Not related :  a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with sufficient evidence 
to accept that there is no causal relationship to drug administration (e.g., no temporal 
relationship to drug administration, because the drug was administered after onset of event; 
investigat ion shows that the drug was not administered; proof of other cause; etc.); or an 
event with a temporal relationship to drug administration which makes a causal relationship 
improbable, and in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide plaus ible 
explanations.  
6.11.5  Assessment of Adverse Event Outcome  
Outcome of AEs will be defined based on  ICH Topic E2B, ICH Guideline.  
• Recovered/Resolved  
• Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae

Action taken for AEs will be documented according to the following:  
• Concomitant medication or other treatment  
• Withdrawal from the study  
 
6.11.7  Action Taken for Study Drug  
Any action taken with study drug will be defined based on  ICH Topic E2B, ICH  
Guideline and documented in the CRF according to the following:  
• Drug Withdrawn  
• None (not changed)  
• Dose Interrupted  
• Unknown  
• Not Applicable  
 
6.11.8  Collection of Extra Laboratory Samples/Investigations  
In the event of a clinically important AE, a suitable sample may be collected for drug assay 
or for additional laboratory tests. The investigator must ensure that the sample is properly 
labeled and stored. The investigator and others responsible for care of the patient  should 
institute any supplementary investigatio ns of significant AEs based on the clinical judgment 
of the likely causative factor. This may include seeking a further opinion from a specialist in 
the field of the AE. The company may suggest special tests based on expert advice.  
6.11.9  Follow -up of Adverse Eve nts Present at Last Scheduled Study Visit  
Adverse events present at the last study day  that require follow -up or a 
repeat laboratory test will be followed -up initially for 30 days according to the site’s standard 
practice for AE follow -up. AE s that have not resolved or stabilized at 30 days after the last 
patient’s last study dose, will be reviewed with the sponsor on an individual basis to 
determine whether the database will be locked and subsequently updated once the events of 
ongoing AEs ar e resolved or whether database lock will be held.

8.1 Data Collection  
All data (ECGs, clinical laboratory data, and all other study -related data) will be collected 
according to the sponsor or CRO’s SOPs.  
Upon database lock, which occurs after resolution of all queries, the CRO, if applicable, will 
provide statistical analysis software (SAS) transfer datasets to the sponsor and to the 
biostatistician for analysis using secure electronic data transfer per the sponsor’s 
specifications.  
8.2 Data Coding  
8.2.1  Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded using the most current Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Actvities (MedDRA) and tabulated, including categorical information of interest such as 
onset and resolution times, time of onset relative to dose, severity at onset, maxim um 
severity, causal relationship to study medication, and action taken. Whenever possible, a 
constellation of signs and symptoms should be recorded as a unifying diagnosis (e.g., self -
limited fever, runny nose, cough, and scratchy throat should be captured  as an upper 
respiratory infection rather than by the individual signs and symptoms). AEs that occur after 
the first dose of study medication will be considered to be ‘treatment -emergent’.  
8.2.2  Concomitant Medications and Non -drug Treatments  
Due to the variabil ity in how medications are recorded, a standard naming convention is 
required in order to tabulate this data effectively. A common method of standardization is to 
categorize medications by their Preferred Term. In order to do this, medications will be 
code d using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHODRUG).  
8.2.3  Medical History  
Medical history will be coded using the most current MedDRA (version 18.0 or later).

Confidential  Page 53 of 81 9.1.2  Hypotheses  
There are no formal hypothesis tests specified in this study due to the lack of control 
treatment group.  
 
9.2 Sample Size and Power Calculations   
Patient  enrollment is limited by the number of patients who complete the  APD334 -003 
study . Therefore sample size and power calculation is not needed.  
9.3 Analysis Populations  
The analyses of all proportion based efficacy variables will use the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) 
population as primary. For other continuous efficacy endpoints, the Modified Intent -to-Treat 
(MITT) population will be used as primary. A completer’s population will  be used as a 
secondary analysis population for the efficacy  endpoints.   
INTENT -TO-TREAT POPULATION (ITT):  
This population consists of all enrolled  patients, who received at least 1 dose of APD334 in 
the extension study . 
MODIFIED INTENT -TO-TREAT POPULATIO N (MITT):  
This population consists of all enrolled  patients, who received at least 1 dose of APD334 , 
have a baseline measurement, and have a post -enrollment  measurement  in the extension 
study  for the specific efficacy endpoint  being assessed . Note that MIT T population can vary 
with endpoints since some patients may have the needed data for inclusion in the MITT 
population for some endpoints but not for others.  
COMPLETERS POPULATION (CP):  
This population consists of all patients who completed the extension study. No missing data 
will be imputed for this analysis. Any substantial differences between conclusions based on 
the ITT /MITT  population and the completers’ population will be investigated.  
SAFETY POPULATION (SP):  
The Safety Population will include all enrolled patients who received study medication  in the 
extension study . 
9.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
All baseline patient characteristics of demographic data (age, height, weight, race), ulcerative 
colitis history, social history (smoking status , caffeine intake, alcohol intake), medical history 
(abnormalities only), physical examination (abnormalities only), and concomitant 
medications at study entry will be listed for all patients.

Adverse events will be coded using the most  current Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) and tabulated, including categorical information of interest such as 
onset and resolution times, time of onset relative to dose, severity at onset, maximum 
severity, causal relationship to stud y medication, and action taken. AEs will be regarded as 
‘pre-treatment’ if they occur between Screening and the time of administration of the first 
dose of APD334. All other AEs that occur after the first dose of study medication will be 
considered to be ‘ treatment -emergent’.  
Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAE) will be listed by patients. They will be summarized and 
expressed in terms of maximum severity and relationship to study medication. The incidence 
of TEAEs classified according to system organ class will b e summarized. TEAEs will also be 
summarized by maximum intensity (assessed according to the Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0313 definitions) and relatedness to study medication.  
Summaries of the number (%) of patients  with at least 1 TEA E, classified according to 
MedDRA system organ class and preferred term, will also be provided for:  
• Drug -related TEAE  
• Treatment -emergent AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study medication 
(study medication discontinued or withdrawal from study).  
• Serious adverse events (SAEs)  
Serious adverse events will be listed by patient. If there are no SAEs at the end of the study, 
the tables or listings will state that there are no SAEs in the study.

Protocol Version: 15 June 2020  1.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 Metastatic or Unresectable Tumors  
 
In 2018, it is estimated that the US cancer prevalence was about 14.5 million Americans, 
and this is expected to balloon to approximately 19 million Americans by 2024 
(American Cancer Society 2019) . Metastatic or unrese ctable disease is the cause of 
cancer -related morbidity and mortality for about 90% of cancer patients  (Chaffer and 
Weinberg 2011) . Clinical presentation of disease can vary widely depending on the site 
of the tumor, but pain is frequently a presenting symptom (Hamilton et al. 2015). 
 
1.2 Radiotherapy for Tumors Needing Palliation   
 
While radiotherapy paradigms evolve, symptomatic palliation is at the forefront of 
treatment intent (Spencer et al. 2018; Jones and Simone II 2014). As such, appropriate 
modality, dose, and fractionation continue to be investigated. Ongoing studies suggest 
hypofractionated approaches are favorable for this population with regimens  based on 
principles of cancer radiobiology,  such as the Spanos Regimen and the QUAD SHOT , 
having variable success in specific disease sites (Carrascosa et al. 2007; Corry et al. 
2005). 
 
Recent data demonstrates that SBRT offers improvements over conventionally 
fractionated radiotherapy for palliative treatment (Sprave et al. 2018; Nguyen et al. 
2019). Three  issues l imit the utility of SBRT. First, dose escalation can be difficult given 
the proximity to surrounding OARs (Hartsell et al. 2005; Shiue et al. 2018) . Second, it 
may be unsafe to treat large tumors with SBRT. Retrospective data and secondary 
analyses from SBRT trials for NSCLC suggest that 5 cm should be the upper limit for which SBRT may be employed (Allibhai et al. 2013; Videtic et al. 2017). Third, SBRT 
may not be as effective for larger lesions  as it is for smaller lesions.  Prior studies support 
this limitation.  (Ricco et al. 2017; Masucci 2018) 
 
1.3 Spatially Fractionated Radiotherapy (SFRT)  
 
SFRT may address these limitations of traditional SBRT.  SFRT relies on beam 
collimation to create high -dose “peaks,” organized throughout a target volume with 
intervening low -dose “valleys” (Billena and Khan 2019) . SFRT as a 2 -dimensional 
technique is being evaluated in soft tissue sarcoma in a prospective setting (M. 
Mohiuddin et al. 2009; Mohammed Mohiuddin et al. 2014). In these studies, a single dose of 2- dimensional SFRT was used either alone or in combination with further 
conventionally fractionate d radiation with  or without chemotherapy with1-2 year LC 
greater than 90% and limited Grade 2 -3 skin toxicities .  
 
Lattice radiotherapy  is a form of SFRT that uses a 3 -dim ensional beam arrangement to 
target high -dose spherical volumes which allows for a more flexible beam arrangement, 
better normal tissue optimization, and lower exit beam skin dose (X et al. 2010) . 
Classically, SFRT had been planned to achieve a dose fall off to 20 -30% of the “peak ” 
Page 12 of 41 
Protocol Version: 15 June 2020  dose (Meigooni et al. 2006) . Tested approaches for Lattice designate spheres 1 -2 cm 
spaced  2-3 cm apart (center to center) (Amendola et al. 2018; E et al. 2010) . Prior studies 
show that Lattice SFRT can be delivered using IMRT  or VMAT (Gholami et al. 2016; 
Billena and Khan 2019) . 
 
1.4 Correlative Studies Background  
 
In animal  models, extreme hypo- fractionation was found to induce infiltration of T -cells 
(Lugade et al. 2005). Also, SBRT has been shown to alter levels of soluble PD -L1, IFN 
α/β/γ, TNFα, and various interleukins  (Trovo et al. 2016; Ellsworth et al. 2017; Walle et 
al. 2018; Song et al. 2019). 
 It is hypothesized that SFRT spares interspersed small volumes of normal tissue allowing it to tolerate higher doses of radiotherapy while immune -mediated bystander effects 
allow for cell kill of areas of tumor receiving a lower dose. This hypothesis is supported 
by the finding SFRT is associated with increased serum TNF α and that higher levels of 
TNFα are associated with complete tumor response (Sathishkumar et al. 2002). 
 
SFRT has been shown to elicit a local effect by the “bystander effect” (i.e. effects to tumor cells in the valleys) via secretion of cytokines, induction of cellular repair 
pathways, and induction of apoptosis  (Sathishkumar et al. 2016; Najafi et al. 2014; Asur 
et al. 2012).  While SBRT and SFRT are both felt to elicit robust immune responses, the immunogenic effects of Lattice SBRT  have not been studied.  
 
1.5 Rationale for treatment approach  
Standard palliative radiotherapy regimens may provide limited durability of response in 
large tumors . Thus , there is a clinical need for a new approach. A standard palliative 
radiotherapy regimen is 20 Gy in 5 fractions, and therefore it is reasonable to assume that 
this should be the minimum dose delivered for adequate tumor coverage in an Lattice 
SBRT  plan. Assuming that this represents the 30% isodose (i.e. the “valley ”), this would 
allow appropriate dose escalation in the “peak ” to 66.7 Gy (i.e. the 100% isodose) . The 
Lattice SBRT  approach may improve symptom response, LC, and better prime the tumor 
microenvironment for immune response  (Ko, Benjamin, and Formenti 2018; Walle et al. 
2018; Krombach et al. 2019)  compared with canonical palliative radiotherapy  doses with 
the added benefit of less toxicity than a traditional homogenous SBRT  plan.  
 
1.6 Study Design 
 
1.6.1 Overall Design 
 
This is a study evaluating the safety of Lattice SBRT  for patients with large 
tumors ( ≥ 4.5 cm) planning to undergo palliative radiotherapy. Eligible patients  
will undergo radiotherapy using Lattice SBRT . Lattice SBRT  will be prescribed 
Page 13 of 41 
Protocol Version: 15 June 2020  to 20 Gy in 5 fractions delivered every other day with a Lattice SIB to 66.7 Gy in 
5 fractions . Patients will be followed for 90 days after the completion of all 
therapy for treatment -related toxicity assessment .   
 
An exploratory study will analyze blood- based markers of treatment response, so 
blood will be drawn prior to and after completion of radiotherapy.  
1.6.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
 
Tumor  burden incurs significant morbidity in terms of symptomatology , including 
pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and mass effect on surrounding organs . Palliative 
hypofractionated radiotherapy is known to be a useful modality for control and/or 
amelioration of such symptoms . However, large tumors are difficult to treat with 
traditional palliative methods. Hypofractionated radiotherapy may offer 
insufficient control and SBRT may be associated with a high rate of toxicity. 
 Dose escalation using SFRT my offer improved local control, symptom relief, and reduced toxicity compared with traditional radiotherapy methods. Also, SFRT has 
been associated with  significant activation  of systemic anti -tumor cytokines and 
chemokines. Since Lattice SBRT  has not been tested, the goal of this  study is to 
evaluate the safety of this approach. 
 
1.6.3 Justification for Dose  
 
One standard regimen for palliative radiotherapy is 20 Gy in 5 fractions. In SFRT, 
the traditional dose gradient between minimum tumor dose and maximum tumor 
dose is 30% to 100% , respectively . Using 20 Gy in 5 fractions as traditional 
coverage for lesions  needing palliation (i.e. 30% “ valley ” tumor coverage), the 
“peak” 100% dose is 66.7 Gy in 5 fractions. 
 
1.7 Risk/Benefit Assessment  
 
1.7.1 Known Potential Risks  
 
High -dose radiation has been known to cause toxicity to normal tissue. This is 
manifested variably depending on the are a of the body treated. While the potential 
toxicities can be serious and include death, these toxicities are rare when high -
quality, high- dose radiation is delivered within established normal tissue dose 
constraints using appropriate immobilization , image guidance, and institutional 
experience. We have successfully tested many Lattice SBRT  plans prescribed to 
66.7 Gy in 5 fractions using institutional quality assurance protocols similar to conventional SBRT. Therefore, we expect the toxicity risks associated with Lattice SBRT  plans to be similar to conventional SBRT if the required established 
dose constraints are met.

2.0 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
 
Objectives  Endpoints  Justification for Endpoints  
Primary  
To evaluate the safety of 
palliative Lattice SBRT in 
patients with non-hematologic 
malignancies with large lesions  
in need of palliative 
radiotherapy  (≥ 4.5 cm)  Rate treatment -related , non -
hematologic  CTCAE v5.0 Grade 
≥ 3  toxicity  SBRT to large tumors is 
traditionally associated with high 
dose to OARs, with sequelae of radiation -induced toxicities. As 
these patients have no effective 
treatment options , evaluation of 
the safety of this method of 
dose-escalation with SBRT is 
warranted . CTCAE v5.0 is a 
widely accepted standardized 
measure of treatment -related 
toxicity.  
Exploratory  
To assess pain response to 
Lattice SBRT  For patients that have pain,  their 
pain level will be assessed with 
the pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) The NRS is an 11 -point scale for 
patient self -reporting of pain. 
This is selected because it is a reliable and clinically meaningful measure of pain that is extensively used in research 
and clinical practice.  
To assess patient -reported 
toxicity outcomes  For patients that do not have pain, 
patient -reported symptom 
response will be assessed with 
PRO -CTCAE  PRO -CTCAE is a standardized 
inventory to collected patient reported symptomatic adverse 
events in clinical trials.  
To assess patient reported 
quality of  life outcomes  
 Patient reported quality of life 
and functional outcomes will be measured before treatment, after 
treatment, and at each follow up 
with the PROMIS Global, 
Physical Function, Pain Interference, Anxiety, and 
Depression system  This patient reported outcome 
inventory was selected because it is a reliable and clinically meaningful measure of patient 
reported toxicities and functional 
outcomes.  
To evaluate blood for immune - 
and tumor damage -associated 
response with Lattice SBRT Whole blood will be collected at 
baseline and after Lattice SBRT 
for exploratory studies of immune and tumor damage associated -
response  The response of immune -related 
markers will be assessed before and after Lattice SBRT to better 
understand the immunogenic  
effects of treatment on tumor.

 Patients must not start any protocol intervention  prior to registration through the Siteman 
Cancer Center.  
 
The following steps must be taken before registering patients to this study:  
1. Confirmation of patient eligibility  
2. Registration of patient in the Siteman Cancer Center database  
3. Assignment of unique patient number (UPN) 
 
4.1 Confirmation of Patient Eligibility  
 
Confirm patient eligibility by collecting  the information listed below : 
 
1. The registering MD’s name 
2. Patient’s race, sex, and DOB  
3. Three letters (or two letters and a dash) for the patient’s initials  
4. Copy of signed consent form  
5. Completed eligibility checklist, signed and dated by a member of the study team 
6. Copy of appropriate source documentation confirming patient eligibility  
 
4.2 Patient Registration in the Siteman Cancer Center OnCore Database 
 
All p atients must be registered through the Siteman Cancer Center OnCore database. 
 
4.3 Assignment of UPN  
 
Each patient will be identified with a unique patient number (UPN) for this study. All data will be recorded with this identificat ion number on the appropriate CRFs. 
 
4.4 Screen Failures 
 
Screen failures are defined as partici pants who c onsent to participate in the clinical trial 
but are not entered in the study.  A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants, to meet the Consolidated 
Page 17 of 41 
Protocol Version: 15 June 2020  Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requ irements and to respond to 
queries from regulatory authorities.  Minimal information includes demography, screen 
failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse event (if applicable).   
 
4.5 Strategies for Recruitment and Retenti on 
 
Our institution sees a high volume of patients that are referred for palliative radiotherapy .  
 
The primary source of patients who are eligible for this study will be radiation 
oncologists within our department . The most likely service lines to see patients with large 
tumors in need of palliative radiotherapy are sarcoma, thorax (i.e. lung cancer), gastrointestinal, gynecologic, palliative, and head and neck. Dr. Spraker (service line 
chief of sarcoma) is the PI , and the other service line chiefs are enthusiastic about this 
trial and are listed as co -investigators: Dr. Clifford Robinson (Thorax), Dr. Hyun Kim 
(Gastrointestinal), Dr. Perry Grigsby (Gynecologic), Dr. Chris Abraham (Palliative), and 
Dr. Wade Thorstad (Head and Neck). Additionally, a full -time research coordinator will 
be assigned to this study who will be screening all patients who are referred to our 
department for palliative radiotherapy.   
 With the current rate of patients  in need of palliative rad iotherapy presenting to our 
department , we anticipate approximately 125 patients per year will be eligible for this 
protocol . A conservative estimate is that 20% of these patients will consent to participate 
in this study. This yields an estimated accrual of 25 patients per year. We anticipate that 
we will enroll 10 patients of all genders, races, and ethnicities. Given the 
hypofractionated course of therapy, 90% of patients should be able to complete the rapy. 
We anticipate that we will accrue approximately  1-2 patients per month, therefore 
completing accrual in 6 months . Patients will be accrued from the outpatient clinics and 
inpatient hospitals of one U.S. site. Potential participants will be identified by our multidisciplinary team physicians and discussed in tumor board.  
  
5.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Study Intervention Description  
 
Consenting and eligible patients will undergo Lattice SBRT  prescribed to a dose of 20 Gy 
in 5 fractions with a simultaneous integrated boost of 66.7 Gy in 5 fractions. As long as 
radiotherapy fields do not overlap, treatment of up to 4 other tumor sites are allowed. 
Lattice SBRT  is required for all tumor sites ≥ 4.5 cm. Lattice SBRT  fractions will be 
delivered every other day. For sites < 4.5 cm, other planning techniques may be used (i.e. 
3D conformal or SBRT). Following radiotherapy , patients will be evaluated for toxicity 
at 14, 30, and 90 days. 
 
Peripheral blood will be collected from patients before treatment , immediately after 
radiotherapy completion (Fraction 5), within 7 -14 days after radiotherapy, and 30 days 
after radiotherapy .   
Page 18 of 41 
Protocol Version: 15 June 2020   
5.2 Pre-Radiation Evaluation 
 
• History and physical exam by team radiation oncologist 
• CBC & CMP  
• CT or MRI  of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis 
• Completion of baseline NRS pain score (if applicable), PRO- CTCAE  (if 
applicable), PROMIS Global, Physical Function, Pain Interference, Anxiety, and 
Depression questionnaire s 
• Peripheral  blood collection. 
 
5.3 Radiation Therapy  
 
Lattice SBRT  must be used  for at least one lesion 4.5 cm or greater . The prescription 
dose for Lattice SBRT  is 20 Gy in 5 fractions with a SIB to 66.7 Gy in 5 fractions. For 
Lattice SBRT , patients must be treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or 
volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT).  
 For Lattice SBRT , each lesion should be treated no more frequently than every other day, 
but treatment of each lesion may be staggered so that the patient has radiotherapy daily. No more than 3 lesions should be treated on the same day.  For other lesions, a standard palliative regimen of 5 fractions or less is encouraged but not required.  Multiple Lattice radiotherapy plans delivered during the trial period may not overlap. Reirradiation of prior irradiated sites is not allowed.  
 
5.3.1 Localization, Simulation, and Immobilization  
 
Simulation and treatment position will be determined by the treating radiation oncologist and team. Patients should be optimally positioned for stereotactic body radiation therapy with alpha cradles, aquaplast m asks, or other methods of 
immobilization . The use of devices to alter dose distributions, such as bolus or 
lead shields, are allowed. Use of techniques to control and/or accommodate tumor 
motion may also be employed in constructing the planning target volume (PTV) . 
 A treatment planning CT scan or MRI  in the treatment position will be required to 
define the PTV. The extent of the CT scan will be determined at the discretion of 
the treating physician. A CT scan slice thickness of ≤ 5 mm should be employed.  
 
5.3.2 Treatment Planning/Target Volumes  
 
The definitions for the GTV, PTV and normal structures used in this protocol 
generally conform to the 1993 ICRU report #50 titled Prescribing, Recording and Reporting Photon Beam Therapy.  
Page 19 of 41 
Protocol Version: 15 June 2020   
5.3.2.1 Target Volumes and Normal Structures  
 
Target Volumes  
Gross Tumor Volume (GTV):  Contour using all available clinical and 
radiographic information. Fusion of other diagnostic imaging to delineate 
the GTV is allowed.  Construction of an iGTV using 4DCT imaging is 
allowed. For boney lesions of the spine, the entire involved vertebral body 
may be included in the GTV.  
 
Planning Target Volume  2000 cGy  (PTV_2000) : Represents a geometric 
expansion of the GTV (or iGTV) of up to 1.0 cm. The PTV should be 
reduced as n ot to extend beyond the patient (i.e. in to air)  and may be 
reduced as to not extend into skin (i.e. external contour contracted by 3-5 
mm).  
 Planning Target Volume  6670 cGy  (PTV_6670) : Spheres with diameter  
1.5 cm should be placed 6 cm apart as measured from center to center 
inside the GTV . The spheres should be placed to m aximize the number of 
whole spheres within the GTV. There should be 3 cm between axial slices in which spheres are placed . Vertices will be offset such as to create an 
octah edron between 3 slices on which spheres are placed.  See the figure 
below for a geometric explanation. Crop all sphere volume extending outside of the GTV.  
Page 20 of 41 
Protocol Version: 15 June 2020   
Geometric representati on of sphere placement. Yellow dots represent the 
center of each sphere.  Short dashes represent in- plane distances, dotted 
lines represent out -of-plane distances. Note that superior/inferior axial 
planes have spheres offset by 3 cm in -plane. To the right are axial slices 
representing yellow sphere placement in each plane. A blue diamond is 
represented to indicate vertices in the reference axial plane, and the center of vertices in planes 3 cm superior and inferior to this.  
 
Normal structures : Relevant norma l structures and their dose constraints 
are described in the table below. Each normal structure should be contoured in its entirety.  
 
5.3.2.2 Radiation Treatment Planning  
 
CT-based planning with tissue inhomogeneity correction is required. Daily 
IGRT is required.  Motion management strategies such as breath holding, 
respiratory gating, fluoroscopy, and MR-guided daily adaptive therapy are 
allowed.  
5.3.2.3 Planning Objectives and Normal Tissue Constraints  
 

Page 21 of 41 
Protocol Version: 15 June 2020  The normal tissues in the table below are to be contoured in their entirety 
when present on the CT simulation scan.   
The following organs and doses are guidelines for the radiation treatment plan. Organ at risk tolerance levels cannot be exceeded . Under 
coverage of PTV targets in order to meet OAR constraints is allowed.  
 
• PTV _2000: at least 95% should be covered by 20 Gy. Keeping 
Dmax within the PTV _2000 and outside the PTV_6670 to less than 
24 Gy is recommended  but not required. 
• PTV _6670: at least 95 % should be covered by 66.7 Gy. A Dmin of 
at least  60 Gy within vPTV is recommended.

5.3.3 Dose Specifications 
 
For Lattice SBRT , the daily prescription dose will be 20 Gy to be delivered to the 
PTV _2000 with a SIB of 66.7 Gy to be delivered to the PTV _6670 over 5 
fractions  (4 Gy and 13.34 Gy to the PTV_2000 and PTV_6670 per day, 
respectively). All doses will be prescribed to the periphery of the PTV s. In 
general, the prescription isodose line (generally 93- 98%) chosen should 
encompass at least 95% of the PTV . Under coverage of the PTV to meet dose 
constraints is allowed.  
 
The maximum point dose, minimum point dose, and the mean dose to the PTV will also be reported.  
 
5.3.4 Technical Factors  
 
The guidelines for VMAT in this trial will conform to the policies set by the Advanced Technology Consortium (ATC) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) .  Each of the target volumes and normal structures listed below must be 
delineated on each slice from the 3D planning CT in which that structure exists.   
5.3.5 Radiation Q uality Assurance 
 
Radiation quality assurance will be evaluated by a Medical Physics team. Prior to 
treatment, plan quality will be assessed with  an ion chamber and film -based 
dosimeters. 
 
5.4 Patient -Reported Quality of Life Outcome and Toxicity Measures  
 
Symptom response and patient -reported quality of life will be measured using the  pain 
numeric rating scale,  PRO -CTCAE  (abridged as indicated in Appendix D) , PROMIS 
Global, Physical Function, Pain Interference, Anxiety, and Depression questionnaire  at 
the following time points : 
 
1. Within 2 weeks prior to the start of radiotherapy  
2. Within 2 weeks after completion of radiotherapy  
3. At 30 days after radiotherapy   
4. At 90 days after radiotherapy  
 
The patient reported outcomes measures will be conducted using a computer -assisted 
interview program and may be done in person before/after a routine office visit or over 
the phone at the preference of the study participant. Patient reported outcomes may a lso 
be collected online.  
 
5.5 Acquisition of Blood for Research  
Page 23 of 41 
Protocol Version: 15 June 2020   
Refer to Section 8.0. 
 
5.6 Definitions of Evaluability  
 
All patients enrolled on the study are evaluable for toxicity if they have received at least 
one fraction of radiation.  Patients are evaluated from first receiving study treatment until 90 days after the conclusion of treatment or death.  
5.7 Concomitant Therapy  and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Patients may not receiv e any concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy or VEGF inhibitors  with 
radiation. The interval from last receipt of cytotoxic chemotherapy or VEGF inhibitors  to 
the initiation (or re -initiation) of subsequent therapy will be at physician discretion. 
Supportive care will be consistent with standards for palliative radiotherapy, directed by 
the treating physician.  
 
5.8 Women of Childbearing Potential  
 
Women of childbearing potential (defined as women with regular menses, women  with 
amenorrhea, women with irregular cycles, women using a contraceptive method that 
precludes withdrawal bleeding , and w omen who have had a tubal ligation ) are required to 
have a negative serum/urine pregnancy test within  20 days prior to the first dose  of 
radiation.  
 
Female and male patients (along with their female partners) are required to use two forms 
of acceptable contraception, including one barrier method, during participation in the study and for 6 months following the last dose of radiation .  
 If a patient is suspected to be pregnant, radiation  should be immediately discontinued.  In 
addition a positive urine test must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test.  If it is confirmed that the patient is not pregnant, the patient may resume therapy. 
 If a female patient or female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during therapy 
or within  6 months after the last dose of  radiation , the investigator must be notified in 
order to facilitate outcome follow -up. 
 
5.9 Duration of Therapy  
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the patient’s health and/or the patient no longer wishes to c ontinue protocol therapy, the 
protocol therapy should be discontinued and the reason(s) for discontinuation documented in the case report forms.  In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue for  a 
maximum of 2 weeks or until one of the following criteria applies:  
Page 24 of 41 
Protocol Version: 15 June 2020   
• Documented and confirmed disease progression 
• Death  
• Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out continuation of study drug 
• General or specif ic changes in the patient’s condition render the patient unable to 
receive further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  
• Suspected pregnancy  
• Serious non-compliance with the study protocol 
• Lost to follow -up 
• Patient withdraws consent  
• Investigator removes the patient from study  
• The Siteman Cancer Center decides to close the study  
 
Patients who prematurely discontinue treatment for any reason will still be followed as 
indicated in the study calendar . 
 
5.10 Follow- up Specifi cations  
 
5.10.1 Duration of Follow Up 
 
Patients will be followed at 14, 30, and 90 days after completion of radiotherapy. 
Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed 
until resolution  or stabilization of the adverse event.  Patients may be followed in -
person during visits, medical records review, phone calls, office visits, and 
assessment of any other clinically relevant materials after completion of therapy.  
 
5.11 Lost to Follow- Up 
 
A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she fails to return for 4 weeks  
and is unable to be contacted by the study team.  The following actions must be taken if the participant fails to return to clinic for a required study visit: 
o The study team will attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit within 1-2 weeks  and counsel the participant on the importance of 
maintainin g the assigned vis it schedule and ascertain if the participant wishes to 
and/or should continue in the study. 
o Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will 
make every effor t to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 
telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known 
mailing address).  These contact attemp ts should be documented in the 
participant’s medical record or study file.  
o Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or  she will be considered to 
have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow- up.

11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Study Design  
 
This is a single arm study where 20 eligible patients with  non-hematologic malignancies  
patients with large tumors (≥ 4.5 cm) will undergo radiotherapy using Lattice SBRT . 
Lattice SBRT  will be prescribed to 20 Gy in 5 fractions delivered every other day with a 
LATTICE simultaneous i ntegrated boost (SIB) to 66.7 Gy in 5 fractions. Patients will be 
Page 29 of 41 
Protocol Version: 15 June 2020  followed for 90 days after the completion of all therapy for treatment- related toxicity 
assessment.  An exploratory study will analyze blood- based markers of treatm ent 
response, so blood will be drawn prior to and after completion of radiotherapy. 
 
11.2 Study Endpoints   
 
The primary endpoint is treatment related severe adverse event rate defined as the 
percentage of pat ients with grade 3 or higher non- hematological toxicities as scored by 
NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5 . 
 
The exploratory endpoints include blood- based markers of treatment response, pain 
response to Lattice SBRT , patien t reported quality of life (QoL) outcomes using the in-
field response , PROMIS Global, Physical Function, Pain Interference, Anxiety, and 
Depression questionnaire, before and after treatment with Lattice SBRT .  
 
11.3 Data Analysis  
 
Demographic and clinical characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Paired t -test and/or paired- sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank test will be used to compare 
the QoL scores between before and after treatment with Lattice SBRT .  
 
11.4 Power Analysis and Sample Size   
 
Approximately 20 evaluable patients will be enrolled. The proposed sample size was 
chosen to allow assessment of safety. With an expected ≥ grade 3 non-hematological 
toxicity rate around 30%, there is a 99.53% probability of observing at least one toxicities 
in the 20 patients.   
 
11.5 Accrual   
 
The rate of accrual for the study is expected to be about 1 patient per month. It is estimated 20 eligible patients will be enrolled in 10-12 months.  
 
11.6 Continuous Toxicity Monitoring using Pocock- type boundary  
 
The toxicities will be reviewed and monitored on a continuous basis. Early stopping of this trial will be based on the excessive Lattice SBRT  treatment emergent severe adverse 
events (TEAE) of grade 3 or higher non- hematological rate. We assume the TEAE rate is 
expected ~30% and a toxicity rate of 40% or more is not desired . Sequential boundaries 
will be used to monitor dose -limiting toxicity rate  after three patients are enrolled and 
evaluable for toxicity . The accrual will be halted if excessive numbers of TEAE are seen, 
that is, if the number of TEAE is equal to or exceeds  bn out of  n patients with full follow -
up (see table below ). This is a Pocock -type stopping boundary that yields the probability 
of crossing the boundary at most 0.3 when the rate of TEAE is equal to the acceptable 
rate of 0.3 (Ivanova, Qaqish, and Schell 2005).

Page 30 of 41 
Protocol Version: 15 June 2020  Boundary (bn)  4 5 5 6 6 6 7 7 8 8 9 9 
 
Thus, based on the continuous monitoring algorithm for toxicity using Pocock-type 
boundary, the study will halt if excessive Lattice SBRT  -related adverse events occur in 
the 4 of the first 4 patients, or 6 of the first 8, or 7 of the first 11, or 9 of the 20 patients 
has completed the trial.  
 The operating characteristics including early stopping probability, expected number of TEAEs and associated with the calculated boundaries are listed below.

Protocol Version: 15 June 2020  APPENDIX B: Definitions for Adverse Event Reporting  
 
A. Adverse Events (AEs)  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition: any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug- related.  
 
Grading:  the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 w ill be utilized for all 
toxicity reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website.  
 Attribution (relatedness), Expectedness, and Seriousness:  the definitions for the terms 
listed that should be used are those provided by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP).  A copy of this guidance can be found on OHRP’s website: http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html
 
 
B. Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
 
As defin ed in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition: any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused 
the adverse event.  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  “Suspected adverse reaction” implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
 
C. Life-Threatening Adverse Event / Life Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition:  any adverse drug event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-
threatening” if, in the view of the investigator, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspe cted adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 D.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition:  an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the 
view of the investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
o Death  
Page 37 of 41 
Protocol Version: 15 June 2020  o A life -threatening adverse event 
o Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
o A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
o Any other important medical event that does not fit the criteria above but, based upon appropriate medica l judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
 
E. Protocol Exceptions 
 
Definition: A planned change in the conduct of the research for one participant. 
 
F. Deviation 
 
Definition: Any alteration or modification to the IRB -approved research without prospective 
IRB approval.  The term “research” encompasses all IRB -approved materials and documents 
including the detailed protocol, IRB application, consent form, recruitment mat erials, 
questionnaires/data collection forms, and any other information relating to the research study. 
 A minor or administrative deviation is one that does not have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or others or the scientific validity of the study.  A major deviation is one that does have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, 
or welfare of participants or others or the scientific validity of the study.

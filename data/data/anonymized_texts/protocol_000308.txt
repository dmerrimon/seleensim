 Page 5 of 14 Template Revised On: 02/28/2019  1.0 Objectives  
1.1 Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine if a single dose of 
sublingual sufentanil is as or more efficacious than a single dose of IV 
fentanyl in a post anesthesia care setting.   
2.0 Background  
2.1 Significance of Research Question/Purpose: This study will help to 
determine the appropriate place for use of sublingual sufentanil in an 
ambulatory practice.   
2.2 Preliminary Data: Existing Literature: Previous studies have demonstrated 
the superiority of SS T to placebo when used for abdominal surgery. 
Additional open label studies have demonstrated that SST has no change in 
mental status when given in an emergency room setting and has a safe 
adverse event profile when used in various inpatient surgical proce dures.  
No studies have compared SST 30 mcg to an active comparator such as IV 
fentanyl.   
3.0 Study Endpoints/Events/Outcomes  
3.1 Primary Endpoint/Event/Outcome: Time of readiness to discharge after 
arrival in PACU  
3.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)/Event(s)/Outcome(s): opioi d use after intervention 
until discha rge, adverse events, patient satisfaction, PONV, supplemental 
oxygen, and OBAS score  
4.0 Study Intervention(s)/Investigational Agent(s)  
4.1 Description: Upon arrival in the ASC PACU patients who have a pain score 
of 4 or greate r will receive one of two interventions.  They will be randomly 
assigned to receive either 50 mcg of IV fentanyl or 30 mcg of sublingual 
sufentanil.  Fentanyl is a potent IV opioid whereas sufentanil is a potent 
sublingual opioid.   
4.2 Drug/Device Handling: B oth sublingual sufentanil and IV fentanyl will be 
stored in the PACU pyxis like other controlled substances.   
4.3 Biosafety: n/a  
4.4 Stem Cells: n/a  
 
5.0 Procedures Involved  
5.1 Study Design: This is a level I randomized prospective outcomes study 
comparing two groups of patients.  Upon arrival in the ASC PACU if the 
patient has a pain score of 4 or greater they will then be randomized to one 
of two groups.  Group 1 will receive 5 0 mcg of IV fentanyl and group 2 will 
receive 30 mcg of sublingual sufentanil.

VERSION DATE: 3 12/20 /2019  
 Page 6 of 14 Template Revised On: 02/28/2019  5.2 Study Procedures: Patients will be approached on the day of surgery about 
participating in the trial.  This will be done as soon as they arrive at the ASC 
to allow adequate time for them to review the study procedures and 
consent form.  All questions will be answered and patients will be ensured 
that they have adequate time to review and understand all study 
procedures.  Patients undergoing surgical procedures with general 
anesthesia will be eligible to participate. Once consented a baseline six -
item screen er score will be obtained.   Patients will only  be enrolled once 
they reach the PACU and if their pain score is 4/10 or greater via the 
Numerical Rating Scale. Then they wil l be randomized and enrolled in the 
study.  If they never have a pain score of 4 or  greater they will not be 
enrolled.    
All patients will have received preoperative acetaminophen 975 mg, 
gabapentin 300 mg and a standardized opioid sparing total IV anesthetic 
with propofol.  No opioids will be used on induction and patients will only 
receive intraoperative opioids if their HR or BP is increased by 20% above 
baseline.  2 different P ONV prophylaxis (ondansetron and dexamethasone) 
will be given and Ketamine will not be used in this study .  
Once in PACU, if their pain score is 4 or greater o n a Numerical rating scale 
they will be randomized into one of the two groups.  One group will receive 
50 mcg of IV fentanyl and the other will receive  30 mcg of sublingual 
sufentanil.  They will be eligible to receive additional rescue opioids 1 0 
minutes a fter their first dose.  Rescue opioids will be 25 mcg of IV fentanyl 
given up to every 3 minutes for max dose of 100 mcg (max dose will  count  
only rescue IV fentan yl, but not the initial randomization of IV fentanyl 50 
mcg)  if pain score remains at 4 or greater out of 10 during this time. If pain 
scores are 3 or less, no opioids will be given .  After 100 mcg of rescue 
fentanyl if pain score remains above 4 out of 10 they will receive 5 mg of 
oral oxycodone or 2 mg of oral hy dromorphone if allergic to oxycodone. 
Another six -item screener test will occur 30 minutes after administration of 
sublingual sufentanil or initial IV fentanyl.  
Time until readiness to discharge ( minutes) , rescue opioid use  (mcgs) , 
Overall benefit of analg esia score, PONV (defined as needed to treat or 
not), need for supplemental oxygen (at 30 mins into recovery) and patient 
satisfaction will be recorded. Six -item screener scores, Baseline 
demographics such as surgical procedure, intraoperative opioids, sur gical 
procedure length, BMI, weight, age, and sex will be recorded.   
5.3 Study Duration: Once ready to discharge from PACU the patien t recording 
will stop and they will finish participation by answering questions for the 
OBAS survey.  It should take 4 weeks t o enroll all patients and another 2 
months for full data analysis.

10.0 Local Number of Participants  
10.1 Local Number of Participants to be Consented: 200 
11.0 Local Recruitment Methods  
11.1 Recruitment Process: Patients will be recruited from the group of adult 
patients undergoing surgery under general anesthe sia at the University of 
Minnesota Ambulatory Surgery Center.  On the day of surgery as soon as 
they are checked in, p atients will be informed of a research opportunity by 
a member of the clinical care staff , including the check -in staff, nursing 
staff, or me mber of the anesthesiology team,  and asked if they are 
interested in talking with a member of the research team . A research team 
member will then explain the study and present the consent form. All 
patients will have sufficient time to review the consent a nd ask questions 
and go over the potential risks of the study with the research team  as they 
arrive several hours prior to the procedure. If they decide to participate 
they will be consented and given a copy of the consent form for their 
records.  
11.2 Identifi cation of Potential Participants: Patients will be identified by 
members of the research team by evaluating the surgical schedule.  
Patients known to have opted out of research will not be approached.  
Patients who agree to participate will sign a consent and HIPAA 
authorization.   
11.3 Recruitment Materials: N/a  
11.4 Payment: No payment will be provided to patients.  
12.0 Withdrawal of Participants  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Sublingual sufentanil vs Intravenous fentanyl for acute pain in the

VERSION DATE: 3 12/20 /2019  
 Page 10 of 14 Template Revised On: 02/28/2019  12.1 Withdrawal Circumstances: S ubjects who have consented and for some 
reason choose not to participate will be withdrawn and a notation will be 
made in the study records and these people will be considered screen 
failures.  The surgeon may choose to withdraw the patient from the study 
prior to surgery for any medical reason or if they suffer a major life -
threatening adverse event . 
12.2 Withdrawal Procedures: If t he patient is withdrawn from study prior to the 
procedure, they will be noted in study records as screen failures. If they 
undergo th e procedure and they decide they no longer want to be a part of 
the study or withdrawn by the physician, they will be withdrawn and no 
further data will be collected.  This will also be noted in the study 
documentation . 
12.3 Termination Procedures: If the study  is terminated for any reason, or there 
are more than 5% major adverse events the data that is already collected 
will be stored in a secure location only accessible to research personnel on 
this study.  No further data will be collected if the study is ter minated. Data 
will only be used for publication if an adequate amount has been collected 
for statistical considerations. Patient research participation duration will be 
on the day of the surgery , therefore if the study is termina ted the reason 
would likely  not be relevant to previously enrolled patients and they would 
correspondingly not be notified of study termination. If however the 
termination reason is thought to be potentially relevant to previously 
enrolled patients by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee, they 
would be called and notified by a member of the research team.  
13.0 Risks to Participants  
13.1 Foreseeable Risks: This study has the following risks:  
- Life threatening respiratory depression  
- Addiction, abuse, and misuse  
- Adrenal insufficiency  
- Severe hypotension  
- Gastrointestinal adverse reactions  
- PONV  
- Seizures  
These risks all fall within the standard risks of using opioids.  Any intervention being 
provided as a part of this study falls within the standard of care as both medication 
options are within t he standard treatments for post -operative pain and are currently used 
as analgesic options at University of MN ASC.

 Page 11 of 14 Template Revised On: 02/28/2019  14.0 Potential Benefits to Participants  
14.1 Potential Benefits: The potential benefits of participating in this study 
include reduced pain and shortened recovery room stay.  
15.0 Statistical Considerations  
15.1 Data Analysis Plan: We plan to collect our data using REDCap and excel 
which will be maintained in Box.  When the study is completed and ready 
for statistical analysis the data will be shared with our staff statistician.  
15.2 Power Analysis: No prior studies have been  done. Therefore, a power 
analysis was done using recovery room time data collected here at the ASC 
from July to September 2019 for similar general anesthesia cases that we 
would expect to enroll in this study. These power calculations found that 
we would need to enroll 33 per gro up to reach a 0.95 power for an  
absolute time difference of 30 minu tes. 
15.3 Statistical Analysis: This study will be analyzed by our staff biostatistician.  
The statistician will be provided the protocol so they are able to analyze for 
primary and secondary objectives.  
15.4 Data Integrity: All patients will be assigned a unique patient identifier.  The 
data will be sent to the statistician will be deidentified.  
16.0 Confidentiality  
16.1 Data Security: All paper documents and consent forms will be stored in a 
locked cabinet in the anes thesia research office in B573 Mayo.  All study 
data will be stored electronically in Box  and REDCap. O nly the PI and 
members of the research team will have access to the data.  
17.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Participants  
17.1 Data Integ rity Monitoring.  
● The PI, co -investigators, and research assistants will all have access to 
the study data stored in the University’s Box storage system. All the 
research assistants have experience collecting pain scores and other 
relevant study informatio n. The PI of the study will periodically 
review the study data to ensure accuracy and completeness of study 
data.  
17.2 Data Safety Monitoring.  
The Department of Anesthesiology has established a Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee consisting of several staff anesthesiologists which include persons 
who are board certified as pain specialists. Data will be transmitted in box to 
persons on the board on a monthly basis for review.  If there are patterns of 
adverse events, the board will meet as needed and provide recommendations.

 Page 12 of 14 Template Revised On: 02/28/2019  All safety data will be collected on a case report form and transferred into an 
excel spread sheet that will be stored in box.  
The data will be reviewed on a regular basis (weekly) by the PI and research 
staff.  If there are consistent com plications noted a meeting will be convened by 
the DSMB for recommendations.  
The statistical tests for analyzing the safety data to determine whether harm is 
occurring.  
The statistician uses R or SAS for analysis.  Most likely a regression analysis will 
be performed to see which event is most likely the contributor for the 
complications.  Also, a chi -square analysis can be performed.  All is very 
dependent on data variability.  
A fatal or serious adverse event that is attributable to either the delivery or the 
study medication itself.  
18.0 Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Participants  
18.1 Protecting Privacy: Patients will be asked if this is a good time to answer 
questions.  All patients will have the right to refuse to answer questions 
when asked.  All data will be deidentified when entered and stored using a 
unique study identifier.  
18.2 Acce ss to Participants : All patients will be required to sign a combined 
HIPAA and study consent that states their privacy of the data being 
collected. It also describes that all data is deidentified and stored in  a 
secure database.  They will be informed that  data is stored and reviewed in 
box which is HIPAA compliant and that only study personnel have access.  
19.0 Compensation for Research -Related Injury  
19.1 Compensation for Research -Related Injury: In the event that this research 
activity results in an injury, treat ment will be available, including first aid, 
emergency treatment, and follow -up care as needed.  Care for such injuries 
will be billed in the ordinary manner, to the patient and/or insurance 
company.

member ca n discuss it with them further.  If they are interested they 
will meet a research staff member and be presented with a combined 
Health and Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  and 
study consent  form.  The patient will review the form with a member 
of the research team.  Subjects will be reminded that participation is 
completely voluntary, and that they may stop participation at any 
time without question or penalty.  The research team will answer  any 
questions that the subjects may have about the study. They will also 
be notified that we will ensure they have the time to contact their 
insurance regarding coverage concerns if they wish.  If the patient 
decides to participate, they will be asked to s ign the consent and 
HIPAA form.  One copy will be saved for study records, and the 
subject will be provided with a copy of the forms for their own

 Page 14 of 14 Template Revised On: 02/28/2019  Research assistants are available to aid in consent and data acquisition. All 
research assistants will be familiar with the study protocol and have experience 
working with similar studies.  
We plan to enroll 6 6 subjects.  To accomplish this we will need to screen 200 
subjects (assuming nearly 70% of patients will not have moderate to severe pain 
in PACU) and enroll 75 (assuming roughly around 10% drop out/screen fail) to 
reach this target population.  This center performs approximately 50 qualifying  
surgical procedures weekly and therefore this should be able to be completed in 4 
weeks.  
Once we reach 3 3 patients in each group, enrollment and data collection will be 
completed at this time.  Statistical Analysis will take approximately one month to 
complete.  
All procedures will be performed in the clinical facilities at the M  Health  
Fairview  Clinics and Surgery Center.  Data storage and analysis will be done 
using IT equipment which is available at the Research Office B573 Mayo.  
In the event that this research activity results in an injury, treatment will be 
available, including first aid, emergency treatment and follow -up care as needed. 
Care for such injuries will be billed in the ordinary manner, to the patient and/or 
insurance company.   
All study personnel will be adequately trained by the Principle Investigator on the 
study protocol and study conduct.  A log will be maintained to track which 
personnel are trained .  A delegation of authority log will also be maintained to 
track which personnel are responsible for specific duties.

1.1 Rationale for Dose Intensification 
 Historically, the conventional treatment for locally -advanced non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was RT 
alone. RTOG 73- 01 randomized 383 patients with NSCLC to 40 Gy (split course), or a continuous course of 40 
Gy, 50 Gy, or 60 Gy [1] . While local control was improved with 60 Gy, 5- year survival rate was only ~5% and 
did not differ between treatment arms. Due to improved intrathoracic control with 60 Gy, this became standard. 
However, local failure still occurred in most patients.  In the 1980s -1990s, two approaches were taken to 
increase the effectiveness of conven tional RT: adding chemotherapy to RT (first sequentially then concurrently) 
and intensifying the radiation therapy (dose escalation and/or altered fractionation).   
1.1.1 Chemotherapy with Conventional RT 
 Several randomized studies compared RT alone (60 Gy) with cisplatin- based chemotherapy followed by RT 
[2-4]. These studies demonstrated a modest, but statistically significant, improvement in overall survival from 
~5% with RT alone to ~10% with sequential chemotherapy. Subsequent randomized studies compared 
sequential chemotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy and found the latter to be superior [5,6] , with 5 -year 
survival reaching 15- 20% with concurrent chemotherapy and RT. Unfortunately, even with this  approach, local 
failure occurs in ~50% or more of patients[7,8].  
1.1.2 RT Dose Intensification without Chemotherapy (Table 1) 
 The second approach attempting to improve local control and survival in locally -advanc ed NSCLC was 
intensifying the RT. Initial stud ies did not include chemotherapy. The largest randomized study was performed 
in the United Kingdom and evaluated continuous, hyperfractionated, a ccelerated radiotherapy (CHART) [9]. 
Patients with locally -advanced NSCLC were randomized to conventional RT  (2 Gy qd to 60 Gy over 42 days) 
or CHART (1.5 Gy tid to 54 Gy in 12 consecutive days). CHART was associated with a 21% relative 
improvement in local control which translated to an improvement in survival ( 20% vs 13% at 3 years ). 
However, the incidence of grade 3 -4 esophagitis was also increased with accelerated treatment (19% vs 3%). 
This treatment approach has not been incorporated into broad practice for several reasons - lack of 
chemotherapy, logistical challenges of a tid schedule, and increased rates o f esophagitis. Of note, two smaller 
studies, with different fractionation schedules, failed to demonstrate an advantage with RT intensification [4,10]. 
  
1.1.3 RT Dose Intensification with Chemotherapy  (Table 1) 
 As outlined above, chemotherapy improves survival in locally -advanced NSCLC when given with 
conventional RT. Several studies evaluated RT dose intensification combined with chemotherapy. A 
randomized study from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG 2597) compared conventional radiation therapy (2 Gy qd to 64 Gy) with hyperfractionated accelerated RT (1.5 Gy tid to 57.6 Gy) [11]. All 
patients received sequential chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. The study was closed early after enrolling 141 patients for multiple reasons: sequential instead of concurrent chemotherapy, logistical challenges of a tid fractionation schedule, and increased rates of esophagitis. Local control was not reported but survival at 3 years was superior with accelerated RT (34% vs 14%), but this was not statistically significant (p=0.28). Grade 3 -4 esophagitis was more common in the experimental arm (25% vs 16%). Two additional randomized 
studies, one using a hyperfractionated regimen[5] and the other using a split course of RT [12] (which may have 
decreased the effectiveness of RT), failed to demonstrate a survival advantage with RT dose- intensification.  
 Multip le phase I/II studies [13,14] have demonstrated that 74 Gy is the maximally -tolerated dose when 
given with conventionally fractionated (2 Gy qd) with concurrent chemotherapy. These studies provided the basis for the  Intergroup randomized study comparing 60 Gy and 74 Gy with concurrent chemotherapy  with

systemic dose carboplatin and paclitaxel were given (referred  to as consolidation therapy) . This study 
randomized patients to conventional dose RT (2 Gy qd to 60 Gy) or high- dose RT (2 Gy qd to 74 Gy). The 
high-dose arm was discontinued early after an interim analysis demonstrated futility. Median survival was 28.7 
months for the conventional dose arm versus 20.3 months for the high- dose arm (p=0.004). This study suggests 
that dose intensification is not successful when the full dose of radiation therapy is delivered to the entire initial 
treatment volume. Of note, a  secondary randomization to concurrent and adjuvant cetuximab demonstrated no 
benefit.

1.1.4 Summary of Rationale for Dose Intensification 
 Based on RTOG 0617, t he current standard of care for locally -advanced NSCLC is concurrent 
chemotherapy with conventional RT (60- 66 Gy). Administering higher doses to all sites of disease appears to be 
counterproductive. However, despite concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy , local failure is common, 
occurring in ~50%[7,8] or more [2] of patients.  
A recent meta- analysis demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in survival with accelerated 
radiation therapy [17]. We recently completed a phase I study that demonstrated that the dose of RT could be 
safely escalated to 74 Gy using accelerated RT (6 fractions/week) and concurrent chemotherapy [18]. Another 
prospective study  at our institution demonstrated that adapting the RT using interim PET is feasible [19]. In this 
study, all patients received a standard dose of RT (60 Gy) to all sites of original disease. A PET was performed 
at 50  Gy. If dosimetric constraints could be met, and the patient was tolerating treatment well without high-

Gy on the interim PET.  The metabolic complete response rate at 50 Gy was 8%.  
 For this phase II study, we plan to investigate a strategy of accelerated and adaptive RT. Patients with 
locally -advanced NSCLC will receive RT (6 fractions/week), to a total dose of 60 Gy. Patients will undergo a 
PET at 50 Gy. In the absence of high- grade toxicity, and if strict normal tissue dosimetric constraints can be 
met, then a 12 Gy boost will be administered to residual FDG -avid disease to a total dose of 72 Gy. All patients 
will receive concurrent  weekly  carbo platin and paclitaxel.  
 
1.1.5 Rationale for Carboplatin and Paclitaxel 
 Carboplatin and paclitaxel is a widely accep ted platinum -doublet chemotherapy regimen that has been 
studied extensively in the setting of concurrent radiation therapy for locally -advanced  non- small cell  lung 
cancer. It is listed as an appropriate chemotherapy regimen when given with concurrent RT by the NCCN and 
was the chemotherapy backbone for the recently reported RTOG 0617 regimen[16].  Older  trials have employed 
combination chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide, cisplatin and vinblastine, and mitomycin, vindesine, and cisplatin (MVP). Due to concerns about the toxicities and tolerability of the cisplatin- based chemotherapy 
several trials have investigated more recently developed chemotherapy combinations.   A  three -arm phase III perform by West Japan Thoracic Oncology Group trial (WTJOG) investigated the 
combination of weekly carboplatin (AUC=2) and paclitaxel (40 mg/m2) concurrent with t horacic radiation 
therapy (T RT)  followed by systemic dose carboplatin (AUC=5) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m2) or carboplatin  
(AUC=2) and irinotecan (20 mg/m2) concurrent with RT followed by systemic dose carboplatin (AUC=5) and irinotecan (50 mg/m2 on days 1,8) compared to the standard therapy of mitomycin, vinblastine and cisplatin  
(MVP ) concurrent with RT followed by two cycles of MVP[20]. The median survival observed in the MVP arm 
and carboplatin and paclitaxel arms  were 20.5 and 22 months, respectively. The 5- year OS rate in MVP and 
carboplatin and paclitaxel arms were 17.5% and 19.8%, respectively. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and gastrointestinal disorders observed on the MVP wer e statistically significantly  higher 
than the incidence observed on the carboplatin and paclitaxel arm. The number of patients who received 0,1, or 2 cycles of systemic dose chemotherapy in the carboplatin and paclitaxel arm was 30.6%, 19.7%, and 49.7%, respectively; significantly more patients in the carboplatin and paclitaxel arm received two courses of the 
systemic therapy (p=0.002). The conclusion of the trial was that the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel had a more favorable toxicity profile and should be considered a standard regimen in the management of locally advanced NSCLC.   A three arm, non- comparative randomized phase II trial investigated the optimal sequencing of carboplatin and 
paclitaxel with daily thoracic radiation therapy to 63 G y/7 weeks/34 fractions.32 Patients were randomized to 
two cycles of induction carboplatin (AUC=6)  and paclitaxel (200 mg/m2) followed by TRT alone (arm 1), two cycles of induction carboplatin (AUC=6) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m2) followed by concurrent carboplatin (AUC=2) and paclitaxel (45 mg/m2) with TRT (arm 2), or concurrent carboplatin (AUC=2) and paclitaxel (45 mg/m2) with TRT followed by systemic dose carboplatin (AUC=2) and pacl itaxel (200 mg/m2) (arm 3) [11].  
The median overall survival observed in arms 1, 2, and 3 was 13.0, 12.7 and 16.3 months, respectively. The rate of grade 3 and 4 esophagitis observed in arms 1,  2, and 3 was 3%, 19%, and 28%, respectively (p<0.001); the 
higher rate of esophagitis in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Of the patients enrolled in arm 3, 25% did not receive systemic chemotherapy, 8% received a single cycle, and 67% received two cycles. The conclusion of the authors was the weekly concurrent carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by the consolidation carboplatin and paclitaxel was associated with the best outcome.

Amended Version: 7 August 2018                                                 CONFIDENTIAL  The combination of these trials led to the adoption of carboplatin and paclitaxel weekly with concurrent TRT 
followed by consolidation carboplatin and paclitaxel for two cycles as the chemotherapy platform for the ROG 
0617 phase III trial previously discussed. Patients received weekly carboplatin (area under curve (AUC) of 2)  and paclitaxel 45 mg/m
2 weekly during concurrent TRT, and followed by two cycles of carboplatin (AUC of 6) 
and paclitaxel (200 mg/m2) every 3 weeks for 2 cycles. In the patients assigned to the 60 Gy and 74 Gy arms 
concurrent chemotherapy was delivered per protocol in 88% and 85% of patients, respectively, and with acceptable variation in additional 6% of patients of both arms. Consolidation chemotherapy was delivered per protocol in the 60 Gy and 74 Gy arms in 70% and 64% of patients, respectively, and with acceptable variation in 5% of patients. Finally, a VA study showed no difference in clinical outcomes, with less toxicity, when 
carboplatin and paclitaxel are utilized instead of cisplatin and etoposide[21].  Since weekly administration of carboplatin and paclitaxel was given concurrently with thoracic irradiation in above studies, we chose to administer these agents in the same fashion for this phase II trial.  
 1.1.6 Rational for Primary Endpoint  
 
 PERCIST (Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors) provides guidelines on how 
to report r esponses to therapy based on PET -CT[22,23]. PET- CT response has been shown to be prognostic in a 
variety of clinical scenarios  in lung cancer  including after induction therapy [24]. In one study, PET was 
performed after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (40- 50.4 Gy). Complete or partial metabolic response using 
PERCIST  criteria was predictive of loco -regional, distant, and overall progression- free survival [25]. The 
complete metabolic response rate was 2%; the partial metabolic response rate was 45%. Interim PET -CT 
response may provide a more rapid assessment of the efficacy of therapy than conventional clinical endpoints such as progression-free or overall survival. 
 
2.0 Purpose  
 
Despite concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy, local/regional failure occurs in ~50% of patients 
with locally -advanced NSCLC. Clinical studies have demonstrated that accelerated fractionation (giving the 
same total dose in a shorter period of time) improves outcomes in several malignancies, including lung 
cancer [17]. Administering higher than conventional doses of RT to all sites of original disease leads to inferior 
outcomes[16]. Adapting the RT approach, giving a higher dose to slowly responding disease as assessed w ith 
interim PET has been shown to be feasible [19]. This is a prospective phase II study designed to study an 
accelerated and adaptive RT approach for locally -advanced NSCLC.

6.0 Registration Procedures  
Only radiation oncologists listed as Key Personnel for this study by the Duke University Health System 
(DUHS) IRB and who have completed the DUHS required ethics training may enroll patients on this study. The patient’s primary medical oncologist will be apprised of the patient’s intent to participate on study. Following verification of eligibility the patient will be assigned a sequential study ID number.  
 
7.0 Protocol Treatment  
 
7.1 Radiation Therapy  
 Radiation therapy is to be initiated concurrently with the first cycle of chemotherapy . All radiation planning and 
treatment procedures are standard of care.  
 Equipment  
All patients will be  treated  using either three -dimensional or intensity modulated (including volumetric 
modulated arc therapy - VMAT ) techniques with a linear accelerator  using photon energies of 6 , 10, and/or 15 
MV.  
 
Treatment Planning  
 Treatment planning procedures are standard of care. A c ustom immobilization  device will be designed for each 
patient. Intravenous and oral contrast are recommended but not mandated. A CT-Sim procedure will be 
performed with respiratory management on all patients.  At the discretion of the treating physician, patients may be treated with breath hold techniques if this is deemed appropriate.   
 
Target Volume 
The gross tumor volume  (GTV)  will include the primary tumor  (GTV-Lung) as well as PET positive lymph 
nodes in regional lymph nodes (GTV -LNs). These volumes will be adjusted to account for motion observed on 
the 4D CT dataset.  The GTV -Lung  will be expanded by 5 mm to account  for possible microscopic extens ion 
beyond the visible primary tumor mass. The GTV -LNs will be expanded by 3 mm to allow for micros copic 
extracapsular extension . The expanded lung and lymph node volumes will be combined to create a clinical 
target volume (CTV). The CTV will be expanded by 3- 5 mm  to create a planning target volume (PTV)  to 
account for  daily set -up uncertainty  and motion that may not have been accounted for in the 4D CT scan. The 
PTV will be the final target for radiation treatment planning .  
 
Treatment  Planning  Technique  
Patients can undergo three -dimensional or intensity -modulated radiation therapy  (including VMAT) . An 
original plan to 60 Gy will be designed. 
 
The following dose constraints are recommended  per standard of care:

4. Esophagus V60 (volume of esophagus receiving 60 Gy or more) ≤ 20% 
5. Brachial plexus Dmax ≤ 64 Gy  
 
RT Treatment  
 Patient s will be set up daily using daily kV imaging  +/- cone- beam CT. Typically, r adiation will be given 
with 6 weekly fractions (with two fractions administered once a week, preferably on Fridays, separated by 6 
hours). Patients may begin radiation therapy on  a day other than M onday. In such cases, they will receiv e daily 
radiation treatments and will receive two fractions on one day of that week (preferably Fridays).  
During weeks that have holidays, the number of fractions delivered will be at the discretion of the treating 
radiation oncologist. Any missed treatment(s) during a holiday will be added at the end of radiation.  
It will not be considered a protocol deviation if a patient receives less than 6 fractions during a holiday week or during the first week of radiation ther apy. 
 
Treatment Interruptions during RT  
Treatment breaks due to radiation -induced esophagitis will be given at the discretion of the radiation 
oncologist. Other (less common) reasons for a treatment break will be:  
 
1. Febrile n eutropenia ( ANC ≤ 500). RT will be resumed once the ANC is >800 and the patient has been 
afebrile for at least 24 hours. 2. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding or g rade 4 thrombocy topenia (platelets < 20,000) . RT 
will be resumed once the platelets are > 20,000. 3. Non- hematologic grade 3 -4 toxicity if felt by treating radiation oncologist that a break is necessary ( i.e. 
significant skin reaction).  
 
7.2 Chemotherapy 
Primarily s tandard  of care concurrent and consolidation chemotherapy is  administered using  carboplatin and 
paclitaxel . However, a ny chemotherapy regimens per the National Comprehensi ve Cancer Network (NCCN) 
version 2.2018 issued on December 19, 2017 for non- small cell lung cancer will be acceptable for the 
concurrent and consolidation phase , at the discretion of the treating physician . Premedication, adjustments to 
dosing schedules, discontinuation of chemotherapy, and/or dose modifications , and/or alternative systematic 
therapy  will be determined by the treating medical oncologist per clinical asses sment.  General guidelines  for 
concurrent and consolidation chemotherapy are included in the protocol.

1. Ototoxicity: For grade ≥ 3 toxicity discontinue carboplatin permanently  
2. Hypersensitivity reactions: For grade 3 reactions, in subsequent cycle s use double dose steroids 
pretreatment and decrease infusion rate for the first 1/3 of the infusion. For last 2/3 of infusion, double the rate 
of the infusion. For documented grade 4 hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel discontinue paclitaxel 3. Cardiotoxicity:  If patient develops chest pain, hypotension, or arrhythmia other than asymptomatic 
bradycardia, the paclitaxel in fusion should be stopped and patients should not receive further paclitaxel. For 
asymptomatic sinus bradycardia, the infusion does not need to be stopped and patient should be observed carefully for development of symptoms of bradycardia. 4. Hepatic dysfunction

7.3 Interim PET -CT 
Patients will undergo an interim PET -CT after 4 weeks of radiation therapy between 48Gy and 54 Gy. The 
interim PET -CT may be delayed up to 60 Gy. Patients can have diabetes but their bloo d sugar must be <200 
mg/dL at the time of interim PET -CT simulation. If the PET -CT cannot be completed due to hyperglycemia or 
other issues, the patient will complete radiation therapy to a dose of 60 Gy with no boost. The PET -CT will be 
obtained based on institutional standards. In general, patients will be administered 8 -15mCi (exact activity 
prescribed based on patient weight) of 18F-FDG through IV injection and rested before PET -CT scanning. The 
PET imaging will be started  approximately 60 minutes after  FDG injection with acquisition time of 3.5 minutes 
per bed position. The iterative algorithm incorporating point spread function (PSF) and time of flight (TOF) will 
be used for PET -CT image reconstruction. In conjunction with the PET, the patient will undergo a CT -Sim 
treatment planning scan for re-planning. 
  
 The planning PET- CT will be exported to our treatment planning software. The treating radiation oncologist 
will contour all sites of residual FDG -avid disease (defined as disease with FDG uptake > b ackground uptake in 
the liver assessed using visual analysis supplemented with semi -quantitative values such as SUVmax ) that 
corresponds with areas of original involvement. These volumes  will be reviewed with a nuclear medicine 
physician  and/ or radiologist  to assess response and confirm residual FDG -avid disease. Patients who achieve a 
complete metabolic response, defined as complete resolution of FDG uptake, with FDG uptake less than the mean standardized uptake value of the liver corrected for lean body mass, and indistinguishable from that of the surrounding background, will not be eligible for a boost. A boost plan will be designed using the same expansion criteria as previously outlined. Patients will be eligible for a boost (2 Gy qd to 12 Gy, 6 fractio ns/week, total dose 72 Gy) if all  of the following are met:  
 
Eligibility for Boost  
Dosimetric criteria (composite of initial and boost plans) 1. Lung V20 ≤ 35%  
2. Spinal cord Dmax <50Gy  
3. Esophageal V60 ≤ 20%  
4. Heart V30 ≤ 50%  
5. Brachial plexus Dmax ≤ 64 Gy  
 Clinical criteria  
1. No evidence of local, regional, or distant progression on interim PET- CT 
2. No grade 3-4 non- hematologic toxicity r elated to radiation therapy after completing 60 Gy 
If dose -volume histogram (DVH) metrics to an organ exceeds any of these criteria based on the initial plan, but 
the boost plan does not contribute any further dose to that organ, then the patient is still eligible for a boost. 
7.4 Treatment Assessments  
Patients will be assessed on a weekly basis  as part of routine clinical care  by the radiation oncologist and 
treatment -related toxicities  will be prospectively recorded. Patients  will also be evaluated routinely by the 
medical oncologist per the standard of care. As necessary patients will be seen more often.  
Blood work will be obtained weekly during treatment at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist.

All study -related materials will be stored electronically on password -protected computers within locked offices. 
Paper study -related forms will similarly be stored in locked offices. All personnel involved in the conduct and 
analysis of data from  the study will have ethics training in the protection of research subjects. The research data 
security plan (RDSP) will be reviewed and approved by the appropriate IT security personnel.  
 
9.0 Protocol Management and Data Collection  
This study will be con ducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and Duke University School 
of Medicine policies. Data will be entered on the study specific e -forms in a password protected REDCap 
database.   
9.1 Adverse Event s: 
An adverse event (AE) is any untow ard medical occurrence in a subject receiving study therapy and which 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  For this protocol, the definition of AE 
also includes worsening of any pre -existing medical condition.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended or worsening sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of radiation therapy, whether or not related to  use of the radiation 
therapy. Abnormal laboratory  values that require therapy , adjustment in prior therapy, or are grade 2 and 
higher will be  considered  an adverse event  and will be captured . All AEs at the start of concurrent 
chemo radiation therapy (CRT) through 30 days post CRT will be captured  in the adverse events case report . 
AEs will be assessed according to the CTCAE version 4.0.  If CTCAE grading does not exist for an AE, the severity of the AE will be graded as mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), life- threatening (4), or fatal (5).  
Attribution of AEs will be indicated as follows: 
− Definite:  The AE is clearly related to the study therapy  
− Probably:  The AE is likely related to the study therapy 
− Possible:  The AE may be related to the study therapy  
− Unlikely:  The AE is doubtfully related to the study therapy  
− Unrelated:  The AE is clearly NOT related to the study therapy  
10.0 Risk/Benefit Assessment  
Patients with locally -advanced NSCLC are at high risk of relapse and death. Long -term (4 -5 years) survival is 
~15-20% in patients with good performance sta tus without significant weight loss. Local failure after 
concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy occurs in ~50% of patients. Thus, increasing the intensity of  RT 
is rational and may improve clinical outcomes for these patients.  
 
Risks of Radiation t o the Lung:  
The expected acute side effects of RT to the lung include fatigue, skin erythema, esophagitis, low blood counts, 
alopecia in the radiation field that may not grow back, cough, chest discomfort, and potentially  pneumonitis. 
The risk of grade 3- 4 esophagitis with  conventional therapy occurs in 15- 25% of patients.  
 
Less likely but serious side effects of RT to the lung include difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, i rritation 
and/or damage to the  heart , irregular or rapid heartbeat , heart fai lure, irritation and/or damage to the spinal cord,

breaks, feeding tubes, hospitalization, etc.) will be greater with accelerated treatment, espe cially if a radiation 
boost dose is administered. We will attempt to avoid this by utilizing IMRT as appropriate, particularly if the 
esophageal V60 > 17%, which can better spare normal tissues from the high dose component of treatment. Further, a boost will only be pursued if strict dosimetric constraints can be met and the patient is not having high-grade toxicity at the end of standard therapy. 
 Also, it is possible that the use of an accelerated RT schedule and or a boost  (which can potentially increase  the 
volum e of lung exposed to RT) will increase the risk of lung injury, acute pneumonitis in particular. The 
patients will be monitored weekly during RT and regularly after treatment to evaluate these toxicities . Finally, it 
is possible that a higher rad iation dose could lead to excess mortality, as evidenced in RTOG 0617
[16]. As local 
failure remains a dominant pattern of disease recurrence, which occurs in the majority of patients with stage III NSCLC, interest r emains in pursuing selective boosts using much smaller RT fields that should be associated 
with far less toxicity that giving a full escalated dose to all sites of original involvement.  
 
Risk of Chemotherapy  
Common side effects associated with carboplatin /paclitaxel include alopecia,  thrombocytopenia , neutropenia, 
anemia, anorexia, nausea and vomiting , fatigue , arthalgias, and myalgias . Less c ommon but potentially serious  
side effects includ e nephrotoxicity, hypersensitivity  reaction , peripheral neuropathy, sensory peripheral 
neuropathy, dermatitis, mucositis, dysgeusia, and h earing loss and/or ringing in the ears. 
 
Risks of the Interim PET -CT  
The interim PET -CT requires the use of diagnostic  radiation. This research will give a study patient the 
equivalen t of about twelve extra years' worth of this natural radiation, which is  far less than the therapeutic 
radiation they will receive for their malignancy. Everyone receives a small amount of unavoidable radiation each year. Some of this radiation comes from space (e.g., being a passenger on airline flights), some arises from naturally -occurring radioactive forms (e.g., radon) in the soil, water, and building materials. The increased risk 
of a radiation -induced cancer from the interim PET-CT is deemed to be ve ry low.  
 All initial staging modalities requirin g by this study (laboratory work, PET -CT, MRI) are standard modalities to 
evaluate the extent of disease. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are standard for patients with locally -
advanced NSCLC. The use of IMRT is an accepted method of planning and delivering radiation therapy. As such, all treatment- related expenses will be charged to the patient and/or their insurance carrier. The cost of the 
interim PET -CT will be borne by the D epartment  of Radiation Oncol ogy.  
 
11.0 Statistical Considerations  
The primary objective of the study is to determine the metabolic complete response rate, assessed using interim PET- CT, in an accelerated fashion (2 Gy/fraction, 6 fractions/week) with concurrent chemotherapy. Seconda ry 
objective are (1) to determine how many patients will be eligible for an RT boost using an interim PET -CT scan 
at 48Gy to 54 Gy  of RT, delivered in an accelerated fashion (6 fractions/week) with concurrent chemotherapy; 
(2) to evaluate clinical outcomes  including overall survival, progression- free survival, and local control with an 
accelerated and adaptive RT approach; and (3) to correlate clinical outcomes (survival, progression -free 
survival, local control) with interim PET -CT responses using PERCIST criteria.  
Sample size justification  
The sample size of this single arm phase II trial is determined such that we have adequate power to detect an increase of the metabolic complete response rate (MCRR) from 8% to 20% among patients who receive

observed an 8% metabolic complete response rate in our prior feasibility study [19]. In other words, if the true 
MCR rate is 20 % or greater, this approach would be worthy of further investigation. On the other hand, if the 
true MCR rate is 8% or less, there is an interest in concluding that the combined chemoradiotherapy is not 
worthy of further investigation. The hypothesis is:  
H0: p ≤ 0.08 versus H1: p ≥ 0.20 
where p is the true MCR rate after the combined chemoradiotherapy.  
We will use Simon’s 2 -stage design to evaluate the MCR of the experimental therapy [26]  The 2 -stage design 
allow a futility test after stage I  patients  have been evaluated for MCR rate. The specific design described below 
is also the design that yields the smallest maximum sample size under the null hypothesis (minmax) among all designs satisfying type I error of 0.10 and type II error of 0.15. 
Specifically, the first stage of the trial will enroll 32 patients. If there are 2 or fewer  patients who responds 
(complete response) among the 32 patients, the trial will be terminated; otherwise, the trial will move forward to 
enroll additional 15 patients. If 6 or fe wer patients among the total of 47 patients who  responds, the 
experimental therapy will be concluded as not worthy of further investigation; otherwise it will be concluded 
that the experimental therapy has sufficient activity worthy of further investigatio n. The above design has 
expected sample size 39.2 under the null hypothesis. The early stopping probability at stage I is 0.5226. The 
actual type I and type II errors are 0.0772 and 0.1480, respectively.  
Given expected attrition rate of 8% due to early wi thdrawal before completing the treatments or ineligibility, we 
will enroll 51 patients to this study in order to observe 47 evaluable patients. 
Accrual rate and accrual duration  
The phase II trial will register a total 51 patients. We expect approximately 1 locally advanced patients who 
meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled per month. It will take approximately 51 months to reach the target 
accrual. Follow up of at least 24 months will be required for all patients for progression free survival and overall 
survival.  
Statistical analysis methods: 
For the cohort of the patient who meet eligibility criteria and receive radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy, the metabolic complete response (MCR) rate, as assessed using interim PET -CT, will be 
estima ted using the UMVUE method [27] and its exact 80% confidence interval  and the p -value will be 
calculated [28].  
The proportion of the patients who are eligible for an RT boost after completing a standard dose of RT (60 Gy), 
delivered in an accelerated fashion (6 fractions/week) with concurrent chemotherapy, will be estimated as well as its confidence interval.  
The overall survival (OS and progression- free survival (PFS) for the treated patients will be characterized by 
Kalan -Meier estimator. The medial OS and median PFs will be estimated as well as their 95% confidence 
intervals. The local control rate for the treated  patients will be estimated as well as its 95% confidence intervals. 
The correlation between outcomes (survival, progression- free survival, loc al control) with interim PET -CT 
responses per PERCIST criteria by univariate analysis and multivariate analysis. For survival endpoints, the 
univariate analysis will be log -rank test and the multivariate analysis will be Cox proportional hazard model in 
which baseline prognostic factors will be adjusted.  
The type of adverse events, the frequency of each type and its grade will be summarized

 1.0  Background  
 
1.1  Endometrial Cancer:  
 
Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic cancer in the United States, 
affecting more than 60,000 women annually [1].  This disease generally afflicts women 
that are postmenopausal with median ages older than those se en with ovarian cancer. 
Importantly, the disease is increasing in incidence as its etiology is linked to obesity, 
diabetes, and hypertension. Although 80% of women are diagnosed at an early stage 
and are curable with locoregional treatment [1], few effective treatment options exist for 
women who recur, which occurs with frequency in high -risk histologic subtypes 
(papillary serous carcinoma,  clear cell carcinoma,  grade 3 endometrioid carcinomas and 
carcinosarcomas). Chemotherapy has become a key pa rt of the treatment for patients 
diagnosed with advanced disease, as well as for those with high -risk disease in both the 
adjuvant and recurrent disease settings. Trials that improve the ‘chemotherapy 
backbone’ with a focus to decrease potential toxicity a nd improve outcomes are 
important in parallel with the development of new therapies. This protocol describes a 
feasibility trial to verify the tolerability of a more optimal taxane schedule and formulation 
in endometrial cancer.    
 
1.2  Experience with Car boplatin and Paclitaxel:  
 
The s ystemic treatment of endometrial carcinoma was first developed around 
progestins and Adriamycin (doxorubicin) and then mostly evolved from Phase III studies 
by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) performed since the 1970s [ 2]. An 
additional study, GOG122, demonstrating the superiority of one of these regimens, 
doxorubicin + cisplatin, to whole abdominal radiation [ 3], served as a powerful stimul us 
for extending the curative potential of adjuvant systemic therapy to earlier s tages of this 
disease. The rationale to treat endometrial cancer with systemic chemotherapy is 
supported by recent data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which characterizes 
high-risk subtypes of endometrial cancer as carcinomas marked by genetic instab ility 
and hypermutations, not unlike subsets of ovarian and breast cancers that are highly 
susceptible to chemotherapy [ 4]. In addition, the use of taxanes in endometrial cancer is 
associated with markedly improved survival for women with recurrent disease  [5].  
 
More recently, GOG 209 demonstrated the non -inferiority and more favorable 
toxicity profile of the doublet of carboplatin + paclitaxel  over doxorubicin, cisplatin and 
paclitaxel (plus G -CSF) in a phase III study of advanced endometrial cancers 
(references with Table 1: summary of GOG studies in advanced stage and recurrent 
endometrial cancers). Since then, carboplatin and paclitaxel have been considered the 
standard systemic chemotherapy backbone for patients with advanced presentations or 
recurrent  disease [ 2]. Data in ovarian cancer (replicating prior data in breast cancer) is 
supportive of weekly dosing of paclitaxel as being associated with an improved survival 
benefit over every  21 day dosing (JGOG3016) albeit at greater myelosuppression 
Version 10; October 09, 2017   Page 5 of 44 
 (requir ing blood transfusions) and neurotoxicity leading to greater dose attenuation and 
discontinuation [ 6]. Divided dose paclitaxel has been studied in the endometrial cancer 
population in a phase II study published by the Leuven Group [ 7]. This group utilized 
dose-dense d ay 1, 8 of both paclitaxel (90 mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC  4) 
administered every 21 days to 42 patients. The median age was 63.9 years (range, 41 -
81 years). The main histopathologic types were serous/clear cell (n = 27) and 
endometrioid (n = 13 ). The patients were divided in 2 groups: chemotherapy -naïve  
group (n = 28, group 1) and a group with previous chemotherapy (n = 14, group 2).  The 
responses for group 1 were as follows: 11 (39 %) complete response, 9 (32%) partial 
response, and 2 (7%) stab le disease. The responses for group 2 were 1 (7%) complete 
response, 2 (14%) partial response, and 6 (43%) stable disease. Treatment -related 
death occurred in 1 patient (7%) because of neutropenia and nephrotoxicity.  
Progression -free survival for group 1 w as 10 months (range, 4 -19 months). At time of 
analysis, 57% of the patients were still alive after a median follow -up of 10 months 
(range, 4 -21 months). Progression  free survival for group 2 was 11 months (range, 4 -19 
months).  Because of grade 3 and 4 hematologic toxicity, treatment adjustments were as 
follows: 49 (18%) and 18 (19%) dose reductions (carboplatin AUC , 2-3), 35 (13%) and 
14 (15%) dose delays, and 8 (3%) and 6 (6%) treatments were not administered on day 
8 for group s 1 and 2, respectively.   The authors concluded that while activity was 
impressive, the regimen was not suitable for eventual phase III study. Our proposed 
study employs a similar ‘divided dose’ for nab -paclitaxel only with carboplatin at the 
customary AUC s every 3 weeks – a regimen we have analyzed retrospectively [ Musa F, 
Kudlowitz D, Velastegui A et al 2014 SGO abstract, manuscript in preparation] . 
 1.3  Abraxane  
 
Abraxane is a novel formulation of paclitaxel , where nanoparticles of the parent drug 
are bound to albumin. The smart nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel uses tumor 
biology against itself, promoting the direct delivery of paclitaxel to the tumor and 
concentrating the drug where it is most needed. The pharmacokinetics of Abraxane are 
favorable over paclitaxel given its 43% higher clearance rate, no need for co -
administration with the solvent Cremophor (responsible for Taxol -associated reactions, 
which limit its use) and 53% higher volume of distribu tion [8].  The combination of 
Abraxane and carboplatin has been studied in non -small cell lung cancer, metastatic 
breast cancer  and metastatic pancreatic cancer leading to the FDA approval of 
Abraxane for these indications. Data from phase III trials suggest the combination is 
safe and effective with significantly decreased grade ≥  3 neuropathy, neutropenia, 
arthralgia and myalgia  in the Abraxane arm.  Importantly, with the high prevalence of 
glucose intolerance and diabetes  in our study population, obviating glucocorticoid pre -
medication would be expected to remove  or reduce complications associated with 
chemotherapy.  In addition, the decreased neuropathy seen with Abraxane would be 
especially important to patients with pre -existing diabetic neuropathy.

 Review of Clinical Studies with Abraxane [8] 
Every -Three -Week (Q3W) Schedule in Metastatic Breast Cancer  
In a phase I study, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Abraxane was determined to 
be 300 mg/m2 by 30 minute infusion Q3W, without premedication or G -CSF support [9]. 
No severe hypersensitivity reactions occurred with Abraxane despite the absence 
of premedication.   Dose -limiting toxicities included sensory neuropathy, stomatitis, and 
superficial keratopathy, which occurred at a dose of 375 mg/m2.  
 
Two multicenter phase II studies have evaluated 2 dose levels of Abraxane (300 mg/m2, 
n = 63, and 175 mg/m2, n = 43) in patients with metastatic breast cancer [10]. The 
overal l response rates in these 2 phase II trials were 40% (95% CI 25 -54%) for the 175 
mg/m2 dose, and 48% (95% CI 35 -60%) for the 300 mg/m2 dose.  Of 39 patients 
receiving 300 mg/m2 as first -line therapy for metastatic breast cancer, 64% (95% CI 49 -
79%) responded. This was contrasted with a 45% response rate in similar patients at 
the lower dose level. Grade 4 neutropenia was noted in 24% of patients at the higher 
dose level, occurre d primarily during the first cycle and resolved rapidly.   
 
A Phase III trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer compared Abraxane 260 
mg/m2 (n = 229) to Taxol 175 mg/m2 (n = 225) given Q3W [11].  Efficacy analyses were 
based on the I TT population. The ORR was significantly greater for Abraxane than for 
Taxol for al l patients (33% v 19%, respectively; P = 0.001), patients who received first -
line therapy (42% v 27%, respectively; P = 0.029), patients who received second -line or 
greater therapy (27% v 13%, respectively; P = 0.006), and patients who had received 
prior anthracycline therapy in either the adjuvant/metastatic setting (34% v 18%, 
respectively; P = 0.002) or the metastatic setting only (27% v 14%, respectively; P = 
0.010). Tumor response rate was also significant ly higher for Abraxane than for Taxol in 
patients with visceral dominant lesions (34% v 19%, respectively; P = 0.002) and in 
patients aged younger than 65 years (34% v 19%, respectively; P < 0.001). ORR also 
was greater for Abraxane compared with standard paclitaxel in patients with nonvisceral 
dominant lesions (34% v 19%, respectively) and in patients  65 years old (27% v 19%, 
respectively), but the results did not reach statistical significance because of the small 
number of patients in these subsets.  
 
Median time to progression  was significantly longer with Abraxane than with Taxol for all 
patients (23.0 v 16.9 weeks, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.75; P = 0.006).   
 
There was a trend for greater median survival for all patients treated with Abraxan e than 
with Taxol (65.0 v 55.7 weeks, respectively; P = 0.374). Although no difference in 
survival was observed in first -line patients, the difference was statistically significant in 
patients who received Abraxane, compared to Taxol, as second -line or gre ater therapy 
(56.4 v 46.7 weeks, respectively; HR = 0.73; P = .024)  [11].  
 
The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions (any grade) was low for both arms (1% for 
Abraxane and 2% for Taxol). No severe (grade 3 or 4) treatment -related hypersensitivity 
reactions occurred in any of th e patients in the Abraxane group despite the absence of 
premedication. In contrast, grade 3 hypersensitivity reactions occurred in the Taxol 
Version 10; October 09, 2017   Page 7 of 44 
 group despite standard premedication (chest pain, two patients; allergic reaction, three 
patients). Per protocol, c orticosteroids and antihistamines were not administered 
routinely to patients in the Abraxane group; however, premedication was administered 
for emesis, myalgia/arthralgia, or anorexia in 18 patients (8%) in the Abraxane group in 
2% of the treatment cycles , whereas 224 patients (> 99%) in the Taxol group received 
premedication in 95% of the cycles.  
 
Although the patients in the Abraxane group received an average paclitaxel dose -
intensity 49% greater than that received by patients in the Taxol group, the inc idence of 
treatment -related grade 4 neutropenia  was significantly lower in the Abraxane group 
than in the Taxol group (9% v 22%, respectively; P < 0.001), with a higher mean 
neutrophil nadir (1.67 v 1.31 x 109/L, respectively; P = 0.046), suggesting that 
polyethylated castor oil may have contributed to this toxicity in patients who received 
standard (solvent -based) paclitaxel.  
 
As expected with a higher dose of paclitaxel, treatment -related grade 3 sensory 
neuropathy  occurred mor e frequently in the Abraxane arm than in the Taxol arm (10% 
v 2%, respectively; P <  0.001); however, these episodes improved with interruption of 
treatment to grade 2 or 1 in a median 22 days and were easily managed with treatment 
interruption and dose re duction. By day 28 after its first occurrence, the number of 
patients with persistent grade 3 sensory neuropathy was the same (n = 4) in both study 
arms. No episodes of motor neuropathy or grade 4 sensory neuropathy were reported in 
either group.  
 
The onl y clinical chemistry value that was notably different between the two treatment 
arms was higher serum glucose levels in the Taxol –treated  patients, who also had a 
higher incidence of hyperglycemia reported as an adverse event  compared with 
Abraxane –treated  patients (7% v 1% respectively; P = 0.003).  
 
Subgroup analyses revealed that the safety profiles of Abraxane (n  = 97) and Taxol (n  = 
30) in patients who received the drugs as first -line therapy were similar to those in the 
overall study population. In su bgroup analyses by age, the reported AEs were similar in 
patients less than 65 years old and patients  65 years old in both groups. Of the 
patients  65 years old, the incidences of the following AEs were notably lower in the 
Abraxane group (n  = 30) than in the Taxol group (n  = 32): neutropenia (23% v 59%, 
respectively), leukopenia (10% v 31%, respectively), nausea (20% v 38%, respectively), 
hyperglycemia (0% v 19%, respectively), and flushing (0% v 16%, respectively). These 
data indicate no additional saf ety concerns for elderly patients, and stimulated the 
development of combinations for NSCLC including stratification for age <70 and >70 
years (see below).  
  
Weekly (QW) Schedule with Carboplatin in advanced Non -small cell Lung (NSCLC) 
Cancer  
A combination  of Abraxane at 100mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 21 day cycle in 
combination with carboplatin AUC 6 every 21 days was stud ied in NSCLC, and led to 
the FDA approval of the combination for this particular indication. Overall response 
Version 10; October 09, 2017   Page 8 of 44 
 rates (ORR) for the Abr axane combination were statistically significantly increased over 
the Taxol /carboplatin arm (33% vs 25% P = 0.005, with the secondary endpoint of 
progression free survival favoring the Abraxane combination. Treatment Emergent AEs 
(TEAEs) in the Abraxane co mbination were alopecia, neutropenia, anemia, and 
thrombocytopenia; peripheral sensory neuropathy, arthralgia and myalgia were 
significantly more often TEAEs in the Taxol combination; TEAEs frequency and 
distribution did not differ by the age stratificatio n (see Table 2 , section 4.0) . However, 
the incidence of TEAEs resulting in taxane delay/dose not given was higher for the 
Abraxane combination (71%) as opposed to the Taxol combination (41%).  On the other 
hand, the improvement in ORR for Abraxane/carboplatin was achieved without 
significant increase in Serious AEs (SAEs) over Taxol/carboplatin (18% vs 15%). The 
toxicity experience in the 1052 patients (521 receiving Abraxane) enrolled in this trial 
provides the major rationale for dropping the  day 15 dose of Abraxane in this 
feasibility/toxicity reduction feasibility study.  
1.4  Rationale Behind Abraxane + Carboplatin in Endometrial Cancer   
 
A major impetus behind our clinical trial is verifying the activity of a more optimal 
and potentially less toxic taxane schedule and formulation than GOG 209. While in 
ovarian cancer trialists have switched to weekly regimens (based on results from Phase 
III Japanese GOG and experience with divided dose Taxol for recurrences and 
metastatic breast cancer), results obtained by the GOG every -3-week carboplatin + 
Taxol doublet regimen are the only available Phase III clinical data for endometrial 
cancer. Accord ingly, a regimen of carboplatin and divided dose (D1 and D8) Abraxane 
is worthy of  a study in patients with  high-risk histologic subtypes,  advanced stage (III 
and IV) or recurrent endometrial cancer. Once feasibility across 6 cycles is established, 
a phase III trial versus the standard Taxol/carboplatin  every 3 weeks is justified – not 
only because of toxicity reduction but also the possibility of improved efficacy from the 
divided dose taxane schedule . Thus, we propose a phase II feasibility design for 
Abraxane 100 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 + carboplatin AUC 6 every 3 weeks given for 6 
cycles in previously untreated patients with endometrial cancer who meet eligibility 
criteria. This d ay 1, 8 dosing seeks toxicity reduction (and a reduction of dose delays 
and doses not given that were seen in 71% in the day 1, 8, 15 dosing in the NSCLC 
trial) for endometrial cancer patients who are generally older with a high percentage of 
comorbidities, and also pretreated  with pelvic and/or vaginal radiation . In summary, the 
better hematologic tolerance of Abraxane vis -à-vis paclitaxel when given together with 
carbopl atin, and the omission of day 15 dosing in our regimen (as opposed to the 
NSCLC study summarized in 1.3) su pport the feasibility testing of this regimen in 
advanced and/or recurrent endometrial cancer. If declared feasible, it would be an 
alternative doublet to Taxol/carboplatin every 3 weeks in a phase III study.

2.0  Objectives  
 
This is a feasibility study of a d ay 1, 8 dose -schedule of Abraxane given in combination 
with carboplatin every 3 weeks in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent 
endometrial cancer .  
 
2.1  Primary Endpoint  
 
The primary endpoint is the percent completion  of 6 cycles of therapy on this protocol. 
Completion is defined as completing 6 cycles of the doublet (including pre -specified up 
to two dose level reductions).    
 
2.2  Secondary Endpoints  
 
1. To determine percent pro gression free survival at 6, 12 ,18, 24 months from onset of 
study treatment with carboplatin and Abraxane in patients with high -risk histologic 
subtypes, advanced, or recurrent endometrial cancer.   
Version 10; October 09, 2017   Page 10 of 44 
  
2. To determine objective response rates by RECIST 1.1 (in patients with measurable 
disease) at the above time points.    
 
3. To evaluate the safety of treatment with carboplatin and Abraxane in this patient 
population and determine the nature and degree of toxicities following treatment.  
 
3.0  Study Design  
3.1-3.2  Description and Rationa le for Study Design  
The single stage open label Phase II feasibility study is designed to estimate the 
proportion of patients who can tolerate the proposed regimen for 6 cycles with no 
more than two dose level reductions.  
3.3  Outcome Measures  
3.3.1  Primary Outcome Measures  
The tolerability of the regimen is the primary outcome. Tolerability for an individual 
patient will be defined as remaining on the study for 6 cycles with two or fewer dose 
reductions.  
3.3.2  Secondary Outcome Measures  
The percent  of patients without disease progression or death at 6, 12, 18, 24 months 
since start of treatment will be determined by CT scans at baseline compared to at 
the above specified time points  (+/- 2 weeks) . Responses at those time intervals will 
be assessed by the RECIST 1.1 criteria in those patients with measurable disease at 
baseline (but will not require objective responses to be confirmed by subsequent 
imaging). Patients who enroll following complete cytoreduction for advanced disease 
will not be evaluable for response, but will be evaluated for progression -free survival  
data.  
3.3.3  Safety Outcome Measures  
Toxicity will be assessed with each dosing visit while on protocol and at the 30 day 
post-treatment visit. Signs and symptoms will b e characterized into grade as per the 
CTCAE protocol. Treatment limiting  toxicities will include grade 3 and 4 non-
hematologic toxicities lasting more than 1 week (excluding fatigue, alopecia or 
aggravation of pre -existing problems) as well as grade  4 thrombocytopenia and 
febrile neutropenia as defined by the NCI -CTCAE.

 4.0  Safety Plan  
 
Dosing Abraxane on days 1 and 8 without day 15 should be able to circumvent many of 
the hematologic toxicities observed in the NSCLC trial cited at the end of section 1.3 
and summarized in Table 2.  During post marketing surveillance, rare cases of severe 
hypersensitivity reactions have occurred [23]. The overall rate of grade 3 and 4 toxicities 
were low and comparab le to that of solvent based Taxol  with the exception of 
significantly less grade ≥  3 neuropathy, neutropenia, arthralgia and myalgias in the 
Abraxane arm. On the other hand an increase in grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia and 
anemia was associated with use of  Abraxane versus paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2. The 
omission of day 15 dosing makes it likely that this Abraxane/carboplatin doublet will 
prove feasible within the statistical framework established in this protocol.

Treatment limiting  toxicities for this protocol will be grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicities 
lasting more than one week (with exception of alopecia, fatigue or aggravation of pre -
existing problems) as well as grade 4 thrombocytopenia and febrile neutropenia.  
Patients experiencing a treatment limiting toxicity  will be d ose reduced according to the 
protocol treatment schema described below  
 
Version 10; October 09, 2017   Page 12 of 44 
 4.1  Plan to manage safety  
 
A number of measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this 
trial. These measures will be addressed through exclusion criteri a (see Section 5.3) and 
routine monitoring as follows.  
Patients enrolled in this study will be evaluated clinically and with standard laboratory 
tests before and at regular intervals during their participation in this study.  Safety 
evaluations will consis t of medical interviews, recording of adverse events, physical 
examinations, blood pressure, and laboratory measurements. Patients will be evaluated 
for adverse events (all grades), serious adverse events, and adverse events requiring 
study drug interrupti on or discontinuation at each study visit for the duration of their 
participation in the study. Patients discontinued from the treatment phase of the study 
for any reason will be evaluated ~30  days (28 –42 days) after the decision to discontinue 
treatment ( see Section 7.1.3).   
Specific monitoring procedures are as follows:  
 Hematologic toxicity : a complete blood count with differential will be obtained at the 
start of each treatment cycle. Any hematologic toxicity will be noted and followed 
closely. If a gra de 4 toxicity is identified, the treatment will be held until the laboratory 
value reaches the parameters for treatment and the dose will be adjusted according to 
the protocol stated below. If a patient requires two dose reductions over the duration of 
the trial and still incurs a treatment limiting  toxicity, the patient will be discontinued from 
the study and counted as unable to complete the prescribed dose.   
 Non-hematologic toxicity : this will likely be identified in the pre -treatment interview, 
physica l examination and/ or other laboratory tests obtained prior to each cycle of 
chemotherapy (complete metabolic panel). Again, any toxicity will be noted and followed 
closely. If a grade 3 or above toxicity is identified, treatment will be held and restarted  
once the toxicity has recovered to a grade 1 or lower. When the treatment is restarted, 
the dose will be reduced as specified below:  
Dose Reduction Levels  
Initial Treatment Dose  Dose Level -1 Dose Level -2 
Abraxane 100mg/m2 IV D1, 8  Abraxane 75mg/m2 IV D1, 8  Abraxane 60/m2 IV D1, 8  
Carboplatin AUC 6 IV D1  Carboplatin AUC 5 IV D1  Carboplatin AUC 4 IV D1  
 
 
Dose Reduction Levels for Patients with Prior Whole Pelvic Radiation  
Initial Treatment Dose  Dose Level -1 Dose Level -2 
Abraxane 75 mg/m2 IV D1, 8  Abraxane 6 0mg/m2 IV D1, 8  Abraxane 5 0/m2 IV D1, 8  
Carboplatin AUC 5  IV D1  Carboplatin AUC 4 IV D1  Carboplatin AUC 3 IV D1  
 
Version 10; October 09, 2017   Page 13 of 44 
 Again, if a patient requires two dose reductions over the duration of the trial and still 
incurs a treatment limiting  toxicity, the patient will be discontinued from the study and 
counted as unable to complete the prescribed dose.   
5.0  Study  Subjects  
5.1  Subject Selection  
 
General Guidelines  
Patients will be recruited from the offices of gynecologic oncologists and medical 
oncologists at the NYU Perlmutter Clinical Cancer Center as per selection criteria 
below. The patients will be identified by the treating physician and referred to the 
resea rch nurse for trial eligibility.  Physicians and/or Co -investigators will explain the 
informed consent document to the patient. Any questions or concerns will be addressed 
by doctors and or study staff. Once all questions are addressed, the patient will sig n the 
consent form.  At the start of trial an H&P, basic vital signs and GOG performance status 
will be noted on the patient’s medical record.   
 
Registration Process  
Patients must sign an informed consent prior to any screening procedures. Registration is 
done centrally by the NYU Perlmutter Cancer Institute’s Clinical Trial Office (CTO).  
Documents required upon registration include last page of signed informed consent, 
eligibility checklist form (signed by PI or sub -investigator) and documentation confirm ing 
eligibility (including labs, history, availability of tissue specimen).

(performed for any reason) that is less than 50% in the past 6 months are ineligible.  
 
6.0  Study  Design  
6.1  Treatment Plan  
In a phase II open -label tolerability study, women with high-risk histologic subtypes, 
advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer will be treated with Abraxane 100mg/m2 IV 
and carboplatin AUC 6 on day 1 and Abraxane 100mg/m2 IV on day 8 of a 21 day cycle 
for 6 cycles . Subjects  will undergo pre -treatment evaluatio n within 4 weeks of enrolling 
into the study (as described in section 8.1). Clinical and laboratory evaluation will be 
performed as described is section 8.2. Imaging studies will be performed within 4 weeks 
of enrollment and at the 6, 12, 18, 24 month afte r start of treatment while on study . 
Dose reductions and modifications for toxicity are described below.  
 
Subject s who received  whole  pelvic  radiation  therapy  or greater  than 50% spine,  will 
start at a reduced  dose.  (see section  4.1). Subjec ts must  wait at least  4 weeks  after 
completion  of whole  pelvic  or >50%  spine  radiation  prior to starting  chemotherapy.  If 
vaginal  brachytherapy  is planned  with chemotherapy,  it may be performed  before  
starting  or after completion  of chemotherapy  at the discre tion of the treating  physician.  
Subjects  DO NOT  need  to start at a reduced  dose  if they received  only vaginal  
brachytherapy.   Vaginal  brachytherapy  may not be performed  in the middle  of 
chemotherapy  treatment.   
 
For subjec ts who underwent  surgery  and for whom chemotherapy  is indicated  after 
surgery , either  as to treat adjuvant ly or to treat residual  disease,  the study  treatment  
should  be administered  within  8 weeks  of surgery.  For subjects  who have  recurrent  
disease  and have  had prior surgery , study  treatme nt does  not need  to be initiated  within  
8 weeks  of surgery.

 7.0  Study Medications  
 7.1  Abraxane Dosage and Formulation  
 
ABRAXANE for Injectable Suspension (also known as ABI -007, nab -paclitaxel, 
paclitaxel protein -bound particles for injectable suspension) is an albumin -bound form of 
paclitaxel with a mean particle size of approximately 130 nanometers. Paclitaxel exists 
in the particles in a non -crystalline, amorphous state. ABRAXANE is supplied as a white 
to yellow, sterile, lyophilized powder for reconstitution with 20mL of 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection, USP prior to intravenous infusion. Each single -use vial contains 100  
mg of paclitaxel and approximately 900mg of human albumin. Each milliliter (mL) of 
reconstituted suspension contains 5mg paclitaxel. ABRAXANE is free of solvents.   The 
active agent in ABRAXANE is paclitaxel.  
 
ABRAXANE is a biologically interactive album in-bound paclitaxel combining a protein 
with a chemotherapeutic agent in the particle form. This composition provides a novel 
approach of increasing intra -tumoral concentrations of the drug by a receptor -mediated 
transport process allowing transcytosis acr oss the endothelial cell. This albumin -specific 
receptor mediated process involves the binding of albumin to a specific receptor (gp60) 
on the intralumminal endothelial cell membrane, resulting in activation of a protein 
(caveolin -1), which initiates an in ternalization process in the endothelial cell through the 
formation of caveolae, with transport of the intact albumin -bound chemotherapeutic 
complex via these caveolae to the underlying tumor interstitium [18] A protein  
specifically secreted by the tumor (SPARC) binds albumin, allowing release of the 
hydrophobic drug to the tumor cell membrane [19]. ABRAXANE is the first biologically 
interactive nanoparticle product leveraging this gp -60/cave olin-1/caveolae/SPARC 
pathway  to increase intra -tumoral concentration of the drug and reducing toxic effects in 
normal tissue . 
 
Preclinical studies comparing ABRAXANE to Taxol® (paclitaxel Cremophor® EL solvent -
based, BMS) demonstrated lower toxicities, with an MTD approximately 50% hi gher for 
ABRAXANE compared to Taxol.  At equal doses there was less myelosuppression and 
improved efficacy in a xenograft tumor model of human mammary adenocarcinoma.  A t 
equitoxic doses of paclitaxel, ABRAXANE treated groups showed more complete 
regressions, longer time to recurrence, longer doubling time, and prolonged survival. At 
equal dose, tumor paclitaxel area under the curve was 33% higher for ABRAXANE 
versus solv ent based paclitaxel, indicating more effective intratumoral accumulation of 
ABRAXANE [18].  
 
  
The dose used in this protocol is extrapolated from the phase III clinical trial of the 
comb ination of carboplatin and Abraxane for non -small lung cancer. In that study, the 
Abraxane was dosed weekly (days 1, 8, 15 of a 21 day cycle), however, in this study we 
will use a divided dose of Abraxane (days 1 and 8) and no treatment will be 
administere d on day 15 in preparation for the initiation of the following cycle on day 1/ 
21. As in the NSCLC trial, the recommended dose of Abraxane is 100mg/m2 
Version 10; October 09, 2017   Page 17 of 44 
 administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 of a 21 day 
cycle. Standardizing the order of Abraxane and Carboplatin administration has no effect 
on patient toxicity; however, administration of Abraxane before Carboplatin is preferred 
but not required . 
  
7.1.2  Abraxane Storage and Administration  
Use caution when handling cytotoxic drugs. Closely monitor the infusion site for 
extravasation and infiltration.  
 
Packaging, Labeling, and Storage of Study Drug  
Availability  
ABRAXANE will be supplied by Celgene Corporation.  Each single -use vial contains 
100mg of paclitaxel and approximately 900mg of human albumin. Each milliliter (mL) of 
reconstituted suspension contains 5mg paclitaxel.  
Storage and Stability  
Storage:  Store t he vials in original cartons at 20ºC to 25ºC (68º F to 77ºF). Retain in the 
original package to protect from bright light.  
Stability:  Unopened vials of ABRAXANE are stable until the date indicated on the 
package when stored between 20ºC to 25ºC (68ºF to 7 7ºF), in the original package. 
Neither freezing nor refrigeration adversely affects the stability of the product.  
Stability of Reconstituted Suspension in the Vial  
Reconstituted ABRAXANE should be used immediately, but may be refrigerated at 2ºC 
to 8ºC (36ºF to 46ºF) for a maximum of 24 hours if necessary. If not used immediately, 
each vial of reconstituted suspension should be replaced in the original carton to protect 
it from bright light. Discard any unus ed portion.  
Stability of Reconstituted Suspens ion in the Infusion Bag  
The suspension for infusion when prepared as recommended in an infusion bag should 
be used immediately, but may be refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) and 
protected from bright light for a maximum of 24 hours.  
The total combi ned refrigerated storage time of reconstituted ABRAXANE in the vial and 
in the infusion bag is 24 hours. This may be followed by storage in the infusion bag at 
ambient temperature (approximately 25°C) and lighting conditions for a maximum of  
4 hours. Disca rd any unused portion.  
 
Study Medication Administration  
ABRAXANE is injected into a vein [intravenous (I V) infusion] over 30 minutes.  The use 
of an in -line filter is not recommended.  
Following administration, the intravenous line should be flushed with Sodium Chloride 
9mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure complete administration of the complete 
dose, according to local practice.  
 
  
Version 10; October 09, 2017   Page 18 of 44 
 Reconstitution and use of ABRAXANE  
1. Calculate the patient’s body surface area at the beginning of the study and if the 
weight changes by  >10% by using the formula provided in the study manual.  
2. Calculate the total dose (in mg) to be administered by:  
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝐷𝑜𝑠𝑒  (𝑚𝑔)=𝐵𝑆𝐴 (𝑚2) ×𝑆𝑡𝑢𝑑𝑦  𝐷𝑜𝑠𝑒  (𝑚𝑔
𝑚2) 
3. Calculate t he total number of vials required by:  
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎 𝑙 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟  𝑜𝑓 𝑉𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑠 =𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝐷𝑜𝑠𝑒  (𝑚𝑔)
100  (𝑚𝑔
𝑣𝑖𝑎𝑙) 
Round up the number of vials to be reconstituted to the next higher whole number when 
a fractional number of vials is obtained by the above formula (e .g., if the total number of 
vials = 4.05 or 4.5, then 5 vials would be reconstituted).  
4. Using sterile technique, prepare the vials for reconstitution.  
5. Swab the rubber stoppers with alcohol.  
6. Aseptically, reconstitute each ABRAXANE vial by injecting 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection, U SP.  
 Slowly  inject the 20mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, over a 
minimum of 1 minute , using the sterile syringe directing the solution flow onto 
the inside wall  of the vial.  
 DO NOT INJECT  the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP solution directly 
onto the lyophilized cake as this will result in foaming.  
 Once the injection is complete, allow the vial to sit for a minimum of 5 (five) 
minutes to ensure proper wetting of the lyophilized cake/po wder.    
 Gently  swirl and/or invert the vial slowly for at least 2 minutes until complete 
dissolution of any cake/powder occurs.  Avoid generation of foam.  Rapid 
agitation or shaking will result in foaming.  
 If foaming or clumping occurs, stand solution for  at least 15 minutes until 
foam subsides.  
 Each ml of reconstituted product will contain 5 mg of paclitaxel.  
7. Calculate the exact total dosing volume of 5 mg/ml suspension required for the 
subjec t: 
𝐷𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔  𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒  (𝑚𝑙)=𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝑑𝑜𝑠𝑒  (𝑚𝑔)
5 (𝑚𝑔
𝑚𝑙) 
8. The reconstituted suspension should be milky and homogeneous without visible 
particulates.  If particulates or settling are visible, the vial should be  gently  
inverted again to ensure complete resuspension prior to use. Discard the 
reconstituted susp ension if precipitates are observed.  
Version 10; October 09, 2017   Page 19 of 44 
 9. Once the exact volume of reconstituted ABRAXANE has been withdrawn from 
the vials, discard any excess solution left over in accordance with standard 
operating procedures.  
10. Further dilution is not necessary. Inject the c alculated dosing volume of 
reconstituted ABRAXANE suspension into an empty sterile, standard PVC IV bag 
using an injection port.  Inject perpendicularly into the center of the injection port to 
avoid dislodging plastic material into the IV bag.   
11. Administe r the calculated dosing volume of reconstituted ABRAXANE 
suspension by IV infusion over 30 minutes. The use of in -line filters is not 
recommended because the reconstituted solution may clog the filter.

7.1.3  Abraxane Dose Modification and Toxicity Management  
Hematologic  toxicity  
Initial  protocol  treatment  will only occur  if ANC  ≥ 1500  cells/mm3 and platelet  count  is ≥ 
100,000  cells/mm3 on day 1. Subsequent  cycles  of therapy  (i.e. Day 1 treatment)  will 
not begin  until the ANC  is ≥ 1000  cells/mm3 and the platelet  count  is ≥ 100,000/mm3. 
Therapy  will be delayed  for a maximum  of three  weeks  until these  values  are achieved.  
Subjects  who fail to recover  adequate  counts  within  a three -week  delay  will be removed  
from study.  For day 8, ANC  must  be ≥ 500 cells/mm3 and the platelet  count  must  be ≥ 
75,000/mm3. If day 8 dosing  criteria  are not met, the dose  will be held until the following  
cycle , if toxicity  has resolved  and start the next cycle  at one dose  level reduction .  
 
- For subjects with ≥ grade 3 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, treatment will be 
withheld until counts recover to ANC ≥ 1000 cells/mm3 and platelet count is ≥ 
100,000 cells/mm3 on day 1 or ANC ≥ 500 cells/mm3 and platelet count is ≥ 
75,000 cells/mm3 on day 8 of the cycle.  
- If treatment is withheld, upon resumption of dosing, Abraxane and carboplatin 
dosing will be permanently reduced as per the following guidelines:  
 
1. Dose Reduction of one dose level  
- Febrile neutropenia  
- Nadir ANC < 500 cells/mm3 persistent for more than one week  
- Nadir platelet count < 50,000 cells/mm3  
- Delay of next cycle (D1 treatment) by more than 7 days for nadir ANC < 1000 
cells/mm3 
- If unable to give D8 treatment  
- Dose is held for neutropenia or thrombocytopenia  
Version 10; October 09, 2017   Page 21 of 44 
  
2. Dose Reduction of two dose levels  
- If any of the above listed conditions re -occurs following first dose reduction, 
except for thrombocytopenia see note below*  
 
If the conditions  listed  above  reoccur  following  reduction  of two dose  levels,  the 
treatment  will NOT  be further  reduced,  but instead  will be discontinued.  
 
*IMPORTANT:  Thrombocytopenia  – if nadir  platelet  levels  drop below  50,000  cells/mm3, 
the treatment  will be withheld  until the levels  recover  to 100,000  cells/mm3 for day 1 or 
50,000  cells/mm3 on day 8 and the dose  will be reduced  one dose  level.  If the levels  are 
noted  to drop below  50,000  cells/mm3 again,  the treatment  will not be further  reduced  
and instead  will be discontinued.  
 
Non-hematologic toxicity  
1. Neuropathy  
   Grade 2 (or greater) peripheral neuropathy requires reduction of one dose level  
and delay in subsequent therapy for a maximum of  3 weeks until recovered to 
grade 1.  If r ecurrent neuropathy to ≥ grade 2 occurs after 1 dose reduction, 
treatment will be held until resolution of symptoms to ≤ grade 1 , and treatment 
will be reinitiated at a second dose reduction.  
 
 2. Renal  
  Grade 2 (or greater) renal toxicity requires reduction of one dose level and delay 
in subsequent therapy for a maximum of 3 weeks until recovered to grade 1.  
 
3. Hepatic  
-    Subjects  with bilirubin  levels  above  the ULN will be excluded  from this clinical  
trial.  
- For subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (AST < 10 x ULN and bilirubin > 
1.5 to ≤ 3 x ULN): the Abraxane dose will be reduced one dose level (see section 
4.1), and subsequent therapy delayed for a maximum of 3 weeks until recovered 
to grade 1.  
- For severe hepatic impairment (AST < 10 x ULN and bilirubin > 3 - ≤ 5 x ULN): 
the Abraxane dose will be reduced to two dose levels, and subsequent therapy 
delayed for a maximum of 3 weeks until recovered to grade 1.  
- Any subjects with very severe hepatic im pairment  (AST > 10 x ULN OR bilirubin 
> 5 x ULN) will be taken off trial.  
 
4.  Alopecia  
There will be no dose modifications for alopecia.  
 
5.   GI 
  It is expected that subjects with nausea, emesis, diarrhea, or constipation will 
receive appropriate medical management without dose modification. However, 
subjects with persistent (greater than 24 hours) ≥ grade 3 toxicity in spite of 
Version 10; October 09, 2017   Page 22 of 44 
 optimal medical management require reduction of o ne dose level and delay in 
subsequent therapy for a maximum of 3 weeks until recovered to grade 1.  
 
6.   Other  
  Non-hematologic toxicities with an impact on organ function of ≥ grade 2 require 
reduction of one dose level and delay in subsequent therapy f or a maximum of 2 
weeks until recovered to grade 1, or pre -therapy baseline.  
 
7. Hypersensitivity  
  Routine premedication to prevent hypersensitivity, nausea, or vomiting is not 
required. However, Abraxane contains paclitaxel, and hypersensitivity reactio ns 
have been observed in some patients treated to date. Mild hypersensitivity 
reaction (Grade 1 or 2 such as flushing, pain, urticaria, drug fever, and 
asymptomatic bronchospasm) can often be successfully treated with slowing or 
interrupting the infusion o f Abraxane and administering antihistamines and 
antipyretics (such as diphenhydramine, promethazine, acetaminophen). 
Frequently, per investigator discretion, the infusion can be restarted and 
completed after the symptoms have abated. Injectable steroids an d epinephrine 
should be immediately available to provide prompt treatment of any severe 
hypersensitivity reactions that may occur during or following study treatment.  
Subjects with grade 3 hypersensitivity reactions can be retreated after standard 
paclita xel premedication at the discretion of the investigator. Pre -medicated 
subjects with grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction and all subjects with grade 4 
hypersensitivity reaction should not be retreated.  
    
 Important  – Abraxane  contains  albumin,  a derivative  of human  blood  and    
should  not be administered  to subjects  who object  to receiving  blood  products.    
 
Overdose  
Overdose, as defined for this protocol, refers to ABRAXANE® alone or in combination 
dosing only.   
 
On a per dose basis, an overdose is defined as the following amount over the protocol -
specified dose of ABRAXANE® assigned to a given subject , regardless of any 
associated adverse events or sequelae.   
PO any amount over the protocol -specified dose  
 IV 10% over the protocol -specified dose   
SC 10% over the protocol -specified dose  
 
On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as anything more frequent 
than the protocol required schedule or frequency.   
 
On an infusion rate basis, an overdose is defined as any rate faster than the protocol -
specified rate.  For nab-paclitaxel, an infusion completed in less than 25 minutes may 
Version 10; October 09, 2017   Page 23 of 44 
 increase Cmax by approximately 20%, therefore a nab-paclitaxel infusion completed in 
less than 25 minutes will meet the infusion rate criterion for an overdose.  
 
Important:  We will conduct  strict  education  with all co-investigators  and infusion  
nurses  to ensure  infusion  should  not be completed  in less than  25 minutes.  
 
Complete data abo ut drug administration, including any overdose, regardless of 
whether the overdose was accidental or intentional, should be reported in the case 
report form.   
 
Concomitant Medications  
Supportive care, including but not limited to anti -emetic medications,  may be 
administered at the discretion of the Investigator.  Concurrent treatment with 
bisphosphonates is allowed.  Erythropoietin and G -CSF may be administered at the 
discretion of the investigator, consistent with institutional gu idelines.  
 
7.2  Carbopl atin Dosage and Formulation  (Paraplatin® - NSC #241240)  
 
Carboplatin is supplied as a sterile, pyrogen -free, 10mg/mL aqueous solution in multi -
dose vials containing 50mg/5mL, 150mg/15mL,450mg/45mL, or 600g/60mL of 
carboplatin. Commercially available both from Bristol -Myers Squibb Oncology as well as 
generic manufacturers. Consult the American Hospital Formulary Service Drug 
Information guide, Facts and Comparisons, or the package insert for additional 
information.  Carboplatin is given per standard of care,  FDA-approved dosing.  
7.2.1  Administration  
Carboplatin aqueous solution can be further diluted to concentrations as low as 
0.5mg/mL with 5% Dextrose in Water or 0.9% Sodium  Chloride for Injection, USP. 
When prepared as directed, carboplatin aqueous  solutions are stable for 8 hours at 
room temperature (25°C / 77°F). Since no  antibacterial preservative is contained in the 
formulation, it is recommended that  carboplatin solutions be discarded 8 hours after 
dilution. Institutional pharmacy  policy may all ow refrigeration and longer storage.  NOTE: 
Aluminum reacts with carboplatin causing precipitate formation and  loss of potency; 
therefore, needles or intravenous sets containing aluminum  parts that may come in 
contact with the drug must NOT be used for the  preparation or administration of 
carboplatin . 
7.2.2  Storage  
Unopened vials of carboplatin are stable to the date indicated on the package when 
stored at 25°C (77°F). Excursions from 15 to 30°C (59 to 86°F) are permitted. Protect 
from light. Carboplatin m ulti dose vials maintain microbial, chemical, and physical 
stability for up to 14 days at 25°C following multiple needle entries.  
 
Version 10; October 09, 2017   Page 24 of 44 
  
7.2.3  Carboplatin dose modifications and toxicity management:  
Dose Calculations  
Carboplatin is dosed by AUC calculated as per the GOG calculator on www.gog.org . 
For subject  safety GOG clinical research studies limit GFR values to less than or equal 
to 125 ml/min. For GFR greater than 125, 125 is used to calculate the carboplatin dose. 
Therefore for GOG studies, the maximum dose is capped at 450mg for AUC 3, 600mg 
for AUC 4, 750mg for AUC 5 and 900mg for AUC 6. Calvert Formula: Carboplatin dose 
(mg) = (Targe t AUC) x (GFR + 25).  For the purposes of this calculation, the GFR will be 
considered to be equivalent to the estimated creatinine clearance (Ccr). The estimated 
creatinine clearance is calculated by the method of Cockcroft -Gault. The Cockcroft -
Gault form ula for calculating the estimated creatinine clearance for women is:  
 
𝐶𝑐𝑟 (𝑚𝑙
𝑚𝑖𝑛)=(140 −𝐴𝑔𝑒 (𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑠 ))×𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔 ℎ𝑡(𝑘𝑔)
72×𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑢𝑚  𝐶𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑒  (𝑚𝑔
𝑑𝑙)×0.85 
 
For this study carboplatin will be dosed at AUC  6 IV (or AUC 5 if prior radiation therapy) .  
 
Dose modifications will occur as follows:  
 Dose level -1: Carboplatin IV AUC 5 (with Abraxane at 75mg/m2 IV) 
 Dose level -2: Carboplatin IV AUC 4 (with Abraxane at 60mg/m2 IV) 
 
If the subject had prior whole pelvi c radiation therapy, dose modifications will occur as 
follows:  
 Dose level -1: Carboplatin IV AUC 4 (with Abraxane at 6 0mg/m2 IV) 
 Dose level -2: Carboplatin IV AUC 3 (with Abraxane at 5 0mg/m2 IV) 
 
There will be no third dose reduction level for carboplatin, instead treatment will be 
discontinued.  
 
There will be no treatment modifications for grade 1 or grade 2 non -hematologic 
toxicities or grade 1 or 2 hematologic toxicities. For grade ≥  3 non -hema tologic 
toxicities, the treatment will be withheld until the toxicity has improved to ≤ grade 1 and 
restarted at dose level -1 (as specified above). For recurrent toxicity, the treatment will 
once again be held until the toxicity has improved to ≤ grade 1 at which point it will be 
restarted at dose level -2 (as specified above).  
 
Hepatic, neurologic and hematologic toxicities are treatment limiting  in this study, please 
see description above (under Abraxane) for instructions on dose reductions for specific 
scenarios. When a dose reduction is undertaken, both the abraxane and carboplatin will 
be dose reduced.  
 
Version 10; October 09, 2017   Page 25 of 44 
 Important: severe and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic 
reactions have been reported. Subject s who experience a severe hypersensitivity to 
carboplatin should not be rechallenged with the drug.  
7.3  Concomitant medications:  
 
No premedications are necessary with Abraxane administration. For cycle day 1 we 
suggest decadron 10mg IV once prior to carbo platin administration. Carboplatin is an 
emetogenic chemotherapy. Support with antiemetics is encouraged.  
 
Caution should be exercised when administering ABRAXANE concomitantly with 
medicines known to inhibit or induce either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 . 
8.0  Clinical and Laboratory Evaluations  
All treatments performed throughout the study are considered standard of care, with the 
exception of Abraxane, which will be provided by the manufacturer. Administration of 
drugs (both Carboplatin and Abraxane) will be considered standard of care.  
8.1  Pre-Treatment evaluations:  
 Vital signs, including blood pressure , height, weight,  and performance status (within 
14 days)  
 History and physical examination (within 14 days)  
 CT-scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis should be performed (within 30 days). The 
imaging study performed during pre -treatment evaluation will be repeated at 6 months.   
 Complete blood count, basic metabolic panel  (including magnesium) , liver function 
test, CA-125 (within 14 days) ; approximately 9mL of blood will be collected.  
8.2  In-Treatment Evaluations  
 
Every 3 weeks:  
 Vital signs, including blood pressure, performance status, blood pressure,  and weight 
(within 4 days of treatment)  
 History and physical  examination (within 4 days)  
 Complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, liver function test (within 4 days) . CA-
125 level is optional and will be drawn at the discretion of the provider.  Approximately 
9mL of blood will be collected.  
⁯ 
Interval imaging (CT scans) will not be routinely performed during treatment. However, if 
done for medical reasons in order to assess signs and symptoms that have arisen 
during treatment warranting evaluation, such scan may be used to determine early 
progression during tre atment.  
Version 10; October 09, 2017   Page 26 of 44 
 8.3  Post -Treatment Evaluations  
8.3.1 Imaging Follow -Up: 
Evaluations by CT will take place at 6 , 12, 18, 24 months (+/- 2 weeks)  after initiation of 
protocol treatment or until disease progression:  
 ⁯At 6, 12, 18, 24 months  (+/- 2 weeks) , imaging (CT scan) will be performed. Imaging 
may be performed earlier than set intervals for medical reasons in order to assess signs 
and symptoms that have arisen during treatment warranting evaluation. If at any time 
point progressive disease is noted, th e subject  will be followed up to the 24 month  
landmark only for survival. All samples collected during the study will be destroyed at 
the end of the study. No samples will be stored for future research.   
 
8.3.2 Clinical Evaluation Follow -Up:

 CA-125 (approximately 3mL of blood)  
 Toxicity assessment  
 
9.0 Risks of Participation   
Taking Abraxane  may cause the subject  to have one or more of the side effects listed 
below.  The FDA considers the use of Abraxane  to be investigational for treating 
endometrial cancer. Because this is a research study about Abraxane not all side 
effects are known. There may be rare and unknown side effects. Some of these side 
effects may be severe  enough to cause death.  
 
Below is a l ist of the most common side effects of Abraxane : 
 Hair loss  
 Numbness, tingling, pain, or weakness in the hands or feet  
 Abnormal heart beat  
 Tiredness  
 Joint and muscle pain  
 Changes in your liver function tests, which may indicate liver problems  
 Rash  
 Low red b lood cell count (anemia) which can cause fatigue and shortness of 
breath  
 Nausea and vomiting  
 Infections  
 Diarrhea  
Version 10; October 09, 2017   Page 27 of 44 
  Loss of body fluid (dehydration)  
 Swelling in the hands or feet  
 
Below is a list of potential serious side effects of Abraxane:  
 Decreased blood counts. Abraxane can cause a severe decrease in neutrophils  
 Numbness, tingling, pain, or weakness in the heads or feet (neuropathy)  
 Severe infection (sepsis)  
 
Below is a list of other potential side effects of Abraxane:  
 Treatment with Abraxane can make liver problems worse. If you have liver 
problems, your starting dose of Abraxane should be lowered or withheld.  
 Abraxane contains albumin (human), a product of human blood  
 
As with any drug, an allergic reaction can occur. Allergic reacti ons can be mild or more 
serious and can even result in death. Common symptoms of an allergic reaction are 
rash, itching, skin problems, swelling of the face and throat or trouble breathing.  
 
It is also important to note the potential side effects when usi ng Carboplatin, as these 
reactions are unknown when using Carboplatin and Abraxane together to treat 
endometrial cancer. The following is a list of potential side effects with Carboplatin:  
 
Likely side effects while using Carboplatin:  
 Low white blood cell counts  
 Low platelet count  
 Low red blood cell count  
 Tiredness  
 Loss of appetite and weight loss  
 Diarrhea, constipation, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal pain  
 Complete hair loss  
 Skin rash  
 Changes in taste  
 Changes in electrolytes (salts) in the blood such as magnesium and potassium  
 
Less Likely, but serious:  
 Numbness or tingling in fingers or toes  
 Ringing in the ears and hearing loss  
 Allergic reactions  
 Chills and fever with aches and pains  
 Decrease in kidney or liver function  
 Sores in mouth and throat (that  can lead to difficulty swallowing and dehydration)  
 Altered vision  
 
Rare, but serious:  
 Seizures  
 Secondary cancers such as acute leukemia  
 Kidney failure requiring dialysis  
Version 10; October 09, 2017   Page 28 of 44 
  Deafness  
 Death  
 
Risk of taking other medication with study drug:  
It is not known whet her Abraxane interacts with other drugs, so all medications the subject is 
taking will be recorded and reviewed while they participate in this study.   
 
10.0 Potential Benefits of Treatment:  
Potential benefits can include a decrease in disease progression, or even potentially 
improvement in health. It is also a benefit in studying potential new treatments for subjects with 
endometrial cancer based on the information gathered in this study.  
11.0  Subject discontinuation  from treatment  
Subjects who meet the following criteria should be discontinued from study treatment:  
 Recurrent treatment limiting  toxicity status post reduction to dose level -2 (see 
section 4.1)  
 Unwillingness or inability of subject to comply with study requirements  
 Withdrawal of consent  
 Determination by the investigator that it is no longer safe for the subject to 
continue therapy  
 Hypersensitivity to Abraxane   
 Disease progression during treatment  
12.0  Study discontinuation  
• Death from any cause  
• Loss to follow -up 
• Receipt of other anticancer therapy  
If a subject  is thought to be lost to follow -up, discontinues study treatment, or 
discontinues the study, attempts should be made to contact the subject to determine the 
reason for discontinuation. For subjects who are thought to be lost to follow -up, at least 
3 documented attempts, including 1 via certified mail, should be made to contact the 
subject before the subject is deemed lost to follow -up.  
13.0  Statistical Methods  
The proportion of subject s who can remain on study for 6 cycles with 2 or fewer dose 
reductions will be estimated with exact 95% confidence intervals. All subject s who 
receive any drug will be included in this intent to treat (ITT) anal ysis.  
 
Version 10; October 09, 2017   Page 29 of 44 
 Characteristics of subjec ts at baseline will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
and graphical displays. Responses evaluated by RECIST 1.1 criteria will be 
summarized using frequency distributions. Survival and percent progression free 
survi val will be displayed using Kaplan -Meier curves and progression free survival rates, 
respectively .  
13.1  Determination of sample size  
Based on a single stage design, we can test the null hypothesis that the proportion of 
subject s completing 6 cycles as defined above is ≤  0.5 versus the alternative that the 
proportion completing 6 cycles is ≥ 0.75 with an alpha of 0.05 (actual 0.047) and power 
of 80% with 23 subject s. If we observe 16 or more regimen completions in the 23 
subject s, we reject the null hypo thesis. Calculations from PASS, NCSS 2008. J Hintze, 
Kaysville, Ut.  
 
14.0  Safety  Reporting  Of Adverse  Events  
14.1  Adverse Events Reporting and Definitions  
Toxicity will be scored using CTCAE  version 4.0 for toxicity and adverse event 
reporting.  A copy o f the CTCAE  version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP  
homepage –see also Appendix 8. 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_4 0).  
All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE  version 
4.0.  All adverse clinical experiences, whether observed by the investigator or reported 
by the patient, must be recorded, with details about the onset date, duration and 
intensity of each episode, the action taken with respect to the test drug, and the 
patient’s outcome.  The investigator must evaluate each adverse experience for its 
relationship to the test drug and for its seriousness . 
 
All AEs will be collected and recorded in the for each patient from the day of signed 
informed consent until 30 days af ter the last dose of study treatment or until the patient 
begins participation in a new clinical trial or initiates a new chemotherapy regimen.  
In general, CTCAE (v 4.03) severity grades are:  
  Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diag nostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated  
  Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL). (Instrumental ADL 
refer to preparing meals, shopping fo r groceries or clothes, using the telephone, 
managing money, etc)  
  Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening;   
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self - 
Version 10; October 09, 2017   Page 30 of 44 
 care ADL. (Self -care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, 
using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.)  
  Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
         Grade 5: Death related to AE  
The investigator must  appraise all abnormal laboratory results for their clinical 
significance.  If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the 
investigator must provide details on attribution to study treatment (i.e., unrelated, 
possibly, probab ly, definitely related and on any actions  taken with respect to the test 
drug and about the patient’s outcome.  
 
In deciding on causality/attribution to treatment, one the following categories should be 
selected:  
Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs in a plausible 
time relationship to treatment administration, and which concurrent disease or other 
drugs or chemicals cannot explain. The response to withdrawal of the treatment should 
be cl inically plausible.  
Possibly related : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the treatment, unlikely to be attributed to 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  
Unlikely related : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to treatment administration which makes a causal relationship improbable, 
or in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide likely explanations.  
Unrelate d: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no 
temporal relationship with treatment administration. Typically explained by extraneous 
factors (eg, concomitant disease, environmental factors, or other drugs or chemicals).  
14.2  NYU Data Safety Monitoring Committee.  
According to the NCI approved DSMB plan . The Data Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC) of the NYU Cancer Center will monitor this study upon approval by its Protocol 
Research Monitoring Committee (PRMC).   The DSMC oper ates based on the 2014 
National Cancer Institute approved Charter.  The DSMC is responsible for monitoring 
safety, conduct and compliance with protocol data and safety monitoring plans for 
cancer clinical trials that are not monitored by any other institut ion or agency.  
 
This study will be monitored according to the monitoring plan detailed below.  The 
Investigator will also ensure that the monitor or other compliance or quality assurance 
reviewer is given access to all the above noted study -related documen ts and study 
related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.), and has adequate space to 
conduct the monitoring visit.  A risk -based, data -driven monitoring approach will also 
Version 10; October 09, 2017   Page 31 of 44 
 include a centralized review of data for quality, trends, consist ency and general safety 
review.  
 
During scheduled monitoring visits, the investigator and the investigational site staff 
must be available to meet with the quality assurance specialist in order to discuss the 
progress of the trial, make necessary correctio ns to case report form entries, respond to 
data clarification requests and respond to any other trial -related inquiries of the monitor.  
In addition to on -site monitoring visits, the Sponsor and/or representatives will also be 
routinely reviewing data.  In quiries related to study conduct, which require further 
information or action will be discussed within the study team for appropriate and 
documented escalation plans. It is expected that response to data clarification requests 
and other trial -related inqui ries will occur throughout the course of the study through 
regular communication with the site monitor, the Sponsor or representatives, and 
review/entry of data into the electronic study database.  
 
In accordance with HIPAA and associated privacy regulations, a patient’s authorization 
to use personal identifiable health information may be required from each patient before 
commencement of research activities. This authorization document must clearly specify 
what parties will have access to a patient ’s personal health information, for what 
purpose and for what duration.  
 
 
At the NYU Perlmutter Cancer Center, all investigator -initiated protocols are subject to a 
standardized data and safety monitoring, which includes scientific peer review, IRB 
review and DSMC review as well as internal auditing.  
 
The review of AEs and trial conduct for this trial occurs at several levels:  
 
(1)  Principal Investigator:  Adverse events are evaluated monthly by the 
principal investigator in conjunction with the research team.  
 
(2) DSMC, twice annually  
 
(3) Institutional Review Board (IRB):  An annual report to the IRB is submitted by 
the trial PI for continuation of the protocol.  It includes a summary of all AEs, 
total enrollment with demographics, protocol violations, and status of 
subjects as well as available research data.  
 
(4) In addition, the quality assurance unit will monitor this trial every 6 -8 weeks, 
to verify adherence to the protocol; the completeness, accuracy and 
consistency of the data; and adherence to ICH Good Clinical P ractice 
guidelines.  
 
Version 10; October 09, 2017   Page 32 of 44 
  
In the event of an adverse event , the first concern will be for the safety of the subject. 
Investigators are required to report to Celgene ANY serious treatment emergent 
adverse event (STEAE) within 24 hours of being aware of the even t. 
 
A STEAE is any sign, symptom or medical condition that emerges during treatment or 
during a post -treatment follow -up period that (1) was not present at the start of 
treatment and is not a chronic condition that is part of the patient’s medical history,  OR 
(2) was present at the start of treatment or as part of the patient’s medical history but 
worsened in severity and/or frequency during therapy, AND that meets any of the 
following regulatory serious criteria:  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening  
 Requir es or prolongs inpatient hospitalization  
 Is disabling  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Is medically significant or requires medical or surgical intervention

14.4  Safety Reporting Requirements  
Expedited Reporting by Investigator to Celgene  
Serious adverse events (SAE) are defined above.  The investigator must inform 
Celgene in writing using a Celgene SAE form or MED WATCH 3500A form  of any SAE 
within 24 hours of being aware of the event .  The wri tten report must be completed and 
supplied to Celgene by facsimile within 24 hours/1 business day .  The initial report must 
be as complete as possible, including an assessment of the causal relationship between 
the event and the investigational product(s) . Information not available at the time of the 
initial report (e.g., an end date for the adverse event or laboratory values received after 
the report) must be documented on a follow -up report.  A final report to document 
resolution of the SAE is required.  The Celgene tracking number (AX -CL-OTHER -PI-
005275) and the institutional protocol number should be included on SAE reports (or on 
the fax cover letter) sent to Celgene .  A copy of the fax transmission confirmation of the 
Version 10; October 09, 2017   Page 33 of 44 
 SAE report to Celgene should be at tached to the SAE and retained with the patient 
records.  
 
Report of Adverse Events to the Institutional Review Board  
The principal Investigator is required to notify his/her Institutional Review Board (IRB) of 
a serious adverse event according to instituti onal policy.   
 
Investigator Reporting to the FDA  
Serious  adverse events  (SAEs) that are  unlisted/unexpected, and at least possibly 
associated to the drug,  and that have not previously been reported in the Investigators 
brochure, or reference safety information document should be reported promptly to the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by telephone or by fax.  Fatal or life threatening 
SAEs that meet the criteria for reporti ng to the FDA must be reported to the FDA within 
7 calendar days after awareness of the event.  All other SAEs that meet the criteria for 
reporting to the FDA must be reported to the FDA within 15 calendar days after 
awareness of the ev ent.  A clear description of the suspected reaction should be 
provided along with an assessment as to whether the event is drug or disease related.    
If this is a multicenter trial, suggest including language indicating that participating study 
sites shou ld NOT report SAEs to the FDA.  Rather, participating sites should report 
SAEs to Celgene and the primary study site, and the primary site will be responsible for 
reporting to FDA.  
Adverse event updates/IND safety reports  
Celgene shall notify the Investiga tor via an IND Safety Report of the following 
information:  
 
 Any AE associated with the use of drug in this study or in other studies that is 
both serious and unexpected.  
 Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for 
huma n subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or 
carcinogenicity.  
 
The Investigator shall notify his/her IRB/EC promptly of these new serious and 
unexpected AE(s) or significant risks to subjects.  
 
The Investigator must keep copies of all AE information, including correspondence with 
Celgene and the IRB/EC, on file.  
 
15.0 Retention  of Records   
All documentation of adverse events, records of study drug receipt and dispensation, 
and all IRB correspondence for at least 2 years after the investigation is completed.   
15.1   Confidentiality  
The research team will maintain clinical and laboratory data i n a manner that ensures 
patient confidentiality.  All study personnel have passed human subject protection 
Version 10; October 09, 2017   Page 34 of 44 
 courses.  Systems used for electronic data capture are compliant with HIPAA and 
applicable local regulatory agency guidelines.  All documents are kep t in strictly 
confidential files and are only made accessible for specific study personnel, CTO quality 
assurance specialists, and authorized representatives of regulatory agencies as 
described in the informed consent document.   
 
15.2  Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  
Source data are contained in source documents.  Source documentation r efers to 
original records of observations, clinical findings, and evaluations that are subsequently 
recorded as data.  Source documentation should be consistent with data entered into 
Velos.  Relevant source documentation to be reviewed by the DSMC through out the 
study includes:  
 
1.  Baseline measures to as sess pre -protocol status  
2.  Concurrent medications  
3.  Treatment records  
4.  Adverse events  
 
 
15.3   Data and Source Documentation  
Velos, an electronic database capture system will be created to record th e data for this 
trial.  Research coordinators will input clinical trial data into the database.  This 
database is password protected and only the PI, assigned research coordinator, and 
CTO quality assurance specialists will have access to the database.  Ve los is the 
primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data requested in Velos must be 
reported.  All missing data must be explained.  The quality assurance specialists will 
monitor this trial every 6 -8 weeks for data entry accuracy.  
 
 
DATA MANAGEMENT  
A clinical research associate (CRA) will be assigned to the study and his/her 
responsibilities will include protocol compliance, data collection, abstraction and data 
entry, data reporting, regulatory monitoring, problem resolution and prioritiz ation, and 
coordination of activities of the protocol study team.

16.0 Costs Incurred to Patients on Study  
Standard of care procedures will be billed to the patient’s insurance company.  If the 
patient does not have insurance  costs  will be billed directly to them. The following 
procedures are considered standard of care:  
 Vital Signs (blood pressure, pulse, temperature)  
 Physical Examination  
 Blood Samples  
 CT Scans  
 Administration costs for carboplatin and abraxane  
 Carboplatin (the dru g) 
 
Since Abraxane is not FDA approved for the treatment of endometrial cancer, the 
drug will be provided to the patients free -of-charge from the Sponsor, Celgene INC. 
Administration procedures for Abraxane, however, will be billed to insurance (or the 
patient in the event the patient does not have insurance).  
 
Subjects will not be paid for their participation in this study.

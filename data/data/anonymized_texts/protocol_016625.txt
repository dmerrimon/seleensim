Study Title
A Phase 2 clinical study of pomalidomide (CC-4047) monotherapy for children and young adults 
with recurrent or progressive primary brain tumors.
Indication
Treatment of children and young adults aged 1 to < 21 years with recurrent or progressive 
primary brain tumors in one of four primary br ain tumor types: high-grade glioma, 
medulloblastoma, ependymoma and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG).  
Objectives
Primary:
!To identify potential tumor type(s) for further development by establishing the 
preliminary efficacy of pomalidomide in children and young adults with recurrent or 
progressive primary brain tumors within four distinct tumor types.
Secondary:
!To evaluate the safety of pomalidomide within the study populations. 
!To estimate the long-term efficacy of pomalidomide treatment.
Exploratory:
!To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of pomalidomide in children and young adults 
with recurrent or progressive primary brain tumors.
Study Design
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, parallel-group study that w ill assess the efficacy, 
safety and tolerability of pomalidomide in children and young adults aged 1 to < 21 years with recurrent or progressive brain tumors after at least one prior standard therapy.
The study will consist of 4 parallel strata, one  for each of the following primary brain tumor 
types: high-grade glioma, medulloblastoma,  ependymoma and DIPG. A Simon’s Optimal two-
stage study design will be applied to each stratum and enrollment will occur as follows:
!Stage 1: Nine sub jects will be  enro lled.
!Stage 2: If during Stage 1, ≥ 2 subjects achieve either an objective response (OR; 
either complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) within the first 6 cycles of treatment (within 3 cycles for DIPG) or a long-term SD (SD maintained for ≥ 6 
cycles [> 3 cycles for DIPG]), an additional 11 subjects shall be enrolled; otherwise 
no additional subjects will be enrolled into that stratum.
!If a total of 5 or more subjects across all 20 subjects in a given stratum (Stage 1 and 
2) evaluable for the primary endpoint are observed as having either an OR (either CR 
or PR) within the first 6 cycles of treatment (within 3 cycles for DIPG) or a long-term 
SD, pomalidomide will be considered effective in that disease indication.

Confidential and Propri etary 7 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 2017Subjects who withdraw from either stage for r easons other than PD prior to completing Cycle 1 
of study treatment w ill be replaced.  Subjects completing at least one cycle of study therapy but 
not having a post-baseline disease assessment will be considered a non-responder.
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC ) will monitor the study conduct.  Details of 
the DMC structure, composition, and roles/responsibilities will be outlined within a DMC charter
described in Section 9.9.2 .
The study will be conducted in compliance wi th International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) 
of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceut icals for Human Use/G ood Clinical 
Practices (GCPs) and applicable regulatory requirements.
Study Population
Male or female children and young adults aged 1 to < 21 years with recurrent or progressive 
primary brain tumors after at least one prior st andard therapy, in 1 of 4 primary brain tumor 
types: high-grade glioma, medulloblastoma, ep endymoma and DIPG will be  enro lled.  Up to 80
subjects (36 subjects in Stage 1 and 44 subjects in Stage 2) will be included should all strata 
enroll the maximum number of subjects and assuming no subjects are replaced.  Approximately 
80% of subjects across all strata will be < 17 years of age. 
Length of Study
The study will have the following sequentia l periods for all sub jects: Screen ing Period, 
Treatment Period and Follow-up Period. The Screening Period will start from the time of obtaining informed consent/assent and will last no more than 28 days, at which time the 
Treatment Period w ill begin (Cycle 1 Day 1, first day of actual study drug administration).  Each 
subject will receive treatment for up to 24 cy cles.  Once treatment has been discontinued, 
subjects will enter the Follow-up Period which will continue for up to 5 years from the 
enrollment of the last subject, unless consent/assent is withdrawn, the subject is lost to follow-up, 
or death.
The Stage 1 portion of the study is expected to last up to approximately 18 months prior to 
reaching the decision point. The Stage 2 porti on of the study is expected to last up to 
approximately 27 months should all strata enroll the maximum number of subjects and assuming no subjects are replaced.  
The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last subject to complete the 
post-treatment follow-up, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last subject that is required for primary, secondary and/or exploratory analysis, as prespecified in the protocol, 
whichever is the later date.
Study Treatments
Pomalidomide will be provided by Celgene in 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg gelatin 
capsules and as an oral suspension.  Subjects will be administered pomalidomide on Days 1 to 
21, followed by a 7-day rest period, of each 28 -day treatment cycle and will continue treatment 
for up to 24 cycles or until documented PD, wit hdrawal of consent/assent, treatment becomes 
intolerable or death. The starting dose will be 2.6 mg/m
2/day which has been determined as the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in the Phase 1 trial conducted by the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC-043).

Protocol CC-4047-BRN-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 8 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 2017Overview of Key Efficacy Assessments
Response evaluations will be based on MRI results obtained at each site and will be assessed 
locally and by an independent central reviewer. Corticosteroid use and clinical assessments (ie, 
neurologic status) w ill also be cons idered when determining overall res ponse.  The local 
Investigator’s assessment will be used for subject eligibility and treatment decisions.  Efficacy 
based endpoints incorporating tumor assessments (primary and secondary) will be based on the 
independent central assessment.  
Tumor assessments will be conducted by standard MRI with and without contrast (ie,
gadolinium) using three MRI sequences (T1-weighted pre- and post-contrast, 
T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR]).  Overall radiographic objective response will be assessed utilizing the sequence(s) best representative of tumor in the opinion of 
the neuroradiologist.  Subjects who do not meet the criteria for an objective response or disease 
progression by the end of Cycle 6 (end of Cycle 3 for DIPG subjects) w ill be considered as 
having long-term SD.
Overview of Key Safety Assessments
Subject safety, including hematology (complete blood count with differential), serum blood 
chemistry analyses, physical examinations, vital signs, body weight measurement, 
Lansky/Karnofsky performance status, symptom re view for adverse events (AEs), and pregnancy 
testing for females of childbearing potential/female children of childbearing potential (FCBP/FCCBP) will be assessed.
Second primary malignancies (SPMs) will be monitored as events of interest and should be 
included as part of the assessment of AEs throughout the course of the study from the time of signing the informed consent form (ICF)/ informed assent form (IAF) until the end of the Long-
term Follow-up Period.  Investigators are to report any SPM as a serious adverse event (SAE)
regardless of causal relationship to study treatment.
Overview of Pharmacokinetics Assessments
Pharmacokinetics evaluations will include the following parameters:
!PK endpoints as assessed by population pharmacokinetic analysis.
!Clinically relevant intrinsic/extrinsic covariates of pomalidomide exposure from 
population PK analysis.
Statistical Methods
This study consists of 4 independent strata for each distinct disease indications (high-grade 
glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma and DIPG ).  The primary endpoint, objective response 
and long-term stable disease rate (ORSDR), is defi ned as the total number of subjects achieving 
either an OR (CR or PR) within the first 6 cycles of treatment (within 3 cycles for DIPG) or a long-term SD (SD maintained for ≥ 6 cycles [> 3 cycles for DIPG]) over the total number of 
subjects evaluable for analysis.  An evaluable subject is defined as completing at least one cycle 
of study therapy or stopping earlier due to a PD. Subjects completing at least one cycle of study therapy but not having a disease assessment (post baseline) will be considered a non-responder.  
Under Simon’s Optimal two-stage design with a 5% significance level and 90% power, assuming 
a lower boundary of interest in the response rate of 10% and an upper boundary of interest in the

1.1. Disease Background
1.1.1. Pediatric Brain Tumors
Central nervous system (CNS) tumors (including brain and spinal cord) are the most common 
solid tumors among children and account for up to 25% of all childhood cancer cases (Fleming, 2012 ).  Although overall survival (OS) is estimated to be over 70% at 5 years for the 
less aggressive tumor types such as pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), medulloblastoma and low-grade 
gliomas, these rates drop to below 50% for children with aggressive variants such as high-grade gliomas and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) ( Kohler, 2011 ).  Outcomes for children with 
recurrent/progressive disease are much lower and once a child with a malignant brain tumor has 
suffered a recurrence, survival outcomes diminish considerably ( Dolecek, 2012; Fangusaro, 
2009 ). In the United States, approximately 2500 children are diagnosed annually with brain 
tumors ( Gajjar, 2013 ).  Brain tumors occur most co mmonly in the first decade of life.
Pediatric brain tumors vary greatly in histology , and there is a great deal of heterogeneity even 
among specific diagnoses ( Fangusaro, 2009 ).  The most common brain tumors fall under the 
broad category of glioma and account for 53% of tum ors in children ages 0 to 14 years and 
37% in adolescents ages 15 to 19 years ( Dolecek, 2012 ).  Other common pediatric CNS tumors 
include medulloblastomas and ependymomas.
Gliomas are primary brain tumors of glial origin with different cell lineages.  Some of the more 
common tumors of this class found in children include fibrillary astrocytomas, PA, ependymomas, glioblastoma multiforme, a nd pleomorphic xanthochromic astrocytomas.  
Gliomas are classified by the World Health  Organization (WHO) into I to IV grades ( Kleihues, 
2002 ).  Most (80%) of these tumors in children are low grade (grade I and II) including the most 
frequently occurring pilocytic astrocytoma (WHO grade I) and diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade 
II) and approximately 20% are WHO grade III or IV (high-grade gliomas) ( Grondin, 2009; Sie, 
2014 ).  Survival rates for patients with low grade glioma are reported to be in excess of 90% for 
OS and 60% to 85% for progression-free survival (PFS) ( Heath, 2012 ).  
High-grade gliomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors that can originate from any lo cation in 
the CNS, but are primarily in the supratentorial brain or in the brainstem. High-grade gliomas account for 3% to 7% of primary brain tumors in children and include anaplastic astrocytomas 
(WHO grade III), anaplastic pleomorphic xanthochromic astrocytomas (WHO grade III) and 
glioblastomas (WHO grade IV) with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) being the most aggressive type ( Cage, 2012; Kleihues, 2002; Sie, 2014 ). High-grade gliomas are particularly difficult to 
treat due to their infiltrative nature and resistance to radiotherapy and current chemotherapy 
regimens.  Diffuse intrinsic brain stem gliomas wh ich are mainly grade III or IV astrocytomas 
have the worst prognosis with a median OS of approximately 9 to 12 months, and most patients 
die from the disease within 2 years ( Sie, 2014 ).  They account for 60% to 75% of brainstem 
tumors and are the major cause of mortality in children with brain tumors occurring between the ages of 5 to 10 years with short time to the onset of symptoms ( Walker, 1999 ).  A review of 
Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC) trials that have included patients with DIPG show a 
median PFS of 4.5 months from diagnosis. DIPG are generally diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the context of a typical clinical presentation ( Rao, 2008 ). Patients with these

Confidential and Propri etary 18 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 2017types of tumors (high-grade gliomas and DIPG) generally succumb to their disease and the 5-
year survival rate remains < 10 to 30% ( Johnson, 2012; Gajjar, 2013 ).
Medulloblastomas, one of the embryonal brain tumor types, are primary brain tumors that occur 
in the cerebellum of children and young adults.  Medulloblastomas are the most common malignant brain tumor in pediatrics and the second most common pediatric brain tumor overall, 
representing approximately 20% of all pediatric CNS tumors ( Fangusaro, 2009 ).  This tumor has 
the propensity to disseminate along the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathway, and approximately 30% of patients have metastatic disease at diagnosis ( Gerber, 2014 ).  Medulloblastomas can be 
stratified into four distinct histological subtypes that together with age at diagnosis and the 
metastatic status of the disease, categorize patients into risk groups, which could be used to predict the survival outcome ( Ajeawung, 2013 ).  These groups include classical 
medulloblastoma, large cell/anaplastic medulloblastoma, nodular desmoplastic medulloblastoma, 
and medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity.  Large-cell/anaplastic medulloblastomas are associated with poor prognosis especi ally in patients less than 3 years of age, while the nodular 
desmoplastic and medulloblastoma with extensi ve nodularity, are associated with a better 
prognosis ( Ajeawung, 2013; Heath, 2012 ).  The 5-year survival ranges from 60% (high-risk) to 
> 80% (standard-risk) ( Gajjar, 2013 ).  More recently, medulloblastomas have been molecularly 
subclassified and further updated risk stratifications defined.
Ependymomas, though relati vely rare, are the third most common pediatric brain tumor and 
represent approximately 8% to 10% of all CNS tumors seen in children.  Ependymomas are 
histologically classified into myxopapillary ep endymoma (WHO gra de I), grade II ependymoma 
(cellular, papillary, clear cell, tanycytic) and anaplastic ependymoma (WHO grade III), although there does not appear to be a correlation between grade and clinical outcome ( Sie, 2014 ).  As 
with medulloblastomas, molecular subclassifications of ependymoma have recently been 
defined. Sixty-five percent of patients with ependymoma are cured after surgery and radiation 
therapy depending on the degree of resection and histopathology of the tumor ( Gajjar, 2013 ). 
Surgical resection remains to be a crucial factor in determining long-term disease control and 
survival.  The 5-year survival ranges from 67 to 80% (completely resected tumor) to 22 to 47% (incompletely resected tumor) ( Merchant, 2002 ). 
1.1.2. Current Treatment for Pediatric Brain Tumors
The treatment approach for pediatric brain tumors in general includes surgical resection, 
radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.  Over the last decades, significant advances in surgery, 
radiation therapy and chemotherapy have le d to better treatment outcomes with around two 
thirds of patients being long-term survivors ( Grondin, 2009; Hummel, 2013; Cage 2012; Gerber, 
2014 ); however, some tumor types remain a challenge. 
Surgical resection, with the aim of achieving a gross total resection (GTR), defined as > 90% 
resection, is usually the initial treatment a pproach.  Surgical resection has shown to be one of the 
most important prognostic factors, irrespective of age, location, or histology. Surgery alone is 
curative for some completely resected tumors; however, GTR is not always achievable due to 
tumor location or involvement of crit ical structures ( Grondin, 2009; Hummel, 2013 ).  Therefore, 
depending on tumor location, GTR must be balanced against the development of disabling 
neurologic deficits ( Grondin, 2009; Hummel, 2013 ).

Protocol CC-4047-BRN-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 19 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 2017Radiation therapy is a standard adjuvant to surgical  resection in ch ildren older than 3 years, and 
has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrence.  However, treatment-related toxicity often has a 
major impact on long-term quality of survival particularly in younger children and those with 
neurofibromatosis type-1.  Radiation is often associated with an increase in long-term morbidities including intellectual impairment, impaired growth, endocrine abnormalities, 
vascular injury and second malignancies.  Because the impact of these factors (especially 
intellectual impairment) is particularly severe in very young children, irradiation is usually 
delayed or avoided in younger children ( Grondin, 2009; Hummel, 2013; Heath, 2012; Cage 
2012 ).  
Many children have disease recurrence or progression, require multiple sequential therapies, and 
suffer significant treatment-related toxicities. Novel approaches, including noncytotoxic 
therapies and targeted therapies, offer the potential for improved outcomes in these patients. 
Most recently, a number of immune modulating therapies have been explored in both pediatric and adult malignancies, including CNS tumors ( Grothey, 2012 ; Gururangan, 2012; Gururangan 
2010 ). The immunomodulatory compounds (IMiDs
®) are a group of drugs with structural 
characteristics similar to thalidomide. These agents, which also include lenalidomide and pomalidomide, have multiple pharmacologic properties and potential antitumor effects including 
antiangiogenesis, immune-modulation, anti-infl ammatory properties and cytotoxic activity. The 
complete and exact antitumor mechanisms of action are unclear and may be multipronged and disease-dependent ( Li, 2010 ).  The immunomodulatory compounds have shown significant 
efficacy in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and 
their activity against hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies, autoimmune diseases, and fibrotic disorders are being evaluated due to their tolerability, multiple mechanisms of action and 
efficacy data in a variety of tumor models and patients.
1.2. Pomalyst®(Pomalidomide) Background
Pomalidomide (CC-4047) (Pomalyst) is the thir d member of a series of drugs known as 
immunomodulatory compounds, which also include thalidomide and lenalidomide. 
Pomalidomide was granted accelerated approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 
08 Feb 2013, for the treatment of adult patients with MM who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and bortezomib and have demonstrated disease progression on 
or within 60 days of completion of the last th erapy.  A new marketing authorization application 
(MAA) for pomalidomide, later changed to Imnovid, was also approved in the European Union (EU) on 05 Aug 2013 in combination with low-dose dexamethasone for the treatment of adult 
patients with relapsed and refractory MM who have received at least 2 prior treatment regimens, 
including both lenalidomide and bortezomib, and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. Imnovid was first launched in the EU in September 2013. Imnovid has also been 
approved with the same indication in Iceland and Norway.  As of 07 Aug 2017, pomalidomide is 
approved in 65 countries worldwide: 28 countries in the EU, 3 countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) outside of the EU, and 34 countries outside of the EEA.
A pomalidomide formulation for constitution to ora l suspension has been developed for use in 
clinical trials.  The oral suspension is available for use in subjects who are unable to swallow the 
capsules or at the discretion of the Investigat or. The oral suspension of pomalidomide is not 
approved by any regulatory agency worldwide for any indication.

pomalidomide.
1.2.1. Pomalidomide Mechanism of Action
Pomalidomide has several potential antitumor mechanisms.  Its exact antitumor mechanism may 
be disease-specific, although this is not entirely  clear.  Pomalidomide has in vitro and in vivo 
antiproliferative and antineoplastic activity ag ainst hematologic B cell malignancies such as MM 
and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL).  Pomalidomide is directly tumoricidal for MM cells and it 
also has immunomodulatory activity with direct effects on T and natural killer (NK)-mediated 
immunity.  Pomalidomide’s pleiotropic activities in a range of cell types including MM cells and immune effector cells suggests the existence of multiple molecular targets and downstream 
modulation of multiple molecular pathways.  The possibility exists that a common molecular 
mediator present in various cell types that is proximal to the downstream modulation of multiple 
signaling pathways is involved in the inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis in 
tumor cells and in the activation of immune effector cells.  One such molecular target is cereblon 
(encoded by the CRBN gene), a protein that forms a ubiquitin E3 ligase complex with DNA 
damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1), cullin 4 (CUL4) and protein Roc1.  Pomalidomide binding to 
cereblon induces the polyubiquitination of two substrate proteins – Ikaros (encoded by the gene 
IKZF1 ) and Aiolos (encoded by the gene IKZF3 ) (Gandhi, 2014; Kronke, 2014; Lu, 2014 ), 
which are key transcription factors regulating immune cell development and homeostasis ( John, 
2011 ).  This pomalidomide-induced ubiquitination targets these substrates for destruction by the 
proteasome resulting in enhanced production of interleukin (IL-2) and other cytokines known to 
regulate T cell function ( Gandhi, 2014; Kronke, 2014; Lu, 2014 ).  In activated human T cells in 
which cereblon was transiently decreased, IL -2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α) 
induction by pomalidomide w as markedly reduced.  Since IL-2 and TNF- α are important for 
tumor surveillance by activated T cells, these results indicate that some of the 
immunomodulatory effects of pomalidomide are mediated via initial binding to cereblon.  
Therefore, the pomalidomide-induced reduction in Ikaros and Aiolos levels represents one 
possible mechanism for the pharmacological effects of pomalidomide, although other 
mechanisms may also play a role.  
The activity of pomalidomide is cell type- and context-dependent ( Bartlett, 2004; Davies, 2001; 
Dredge, 2002; Escoubet-Lozach, 2009; Teo, 2005; Xu, 2009 ).  Activities include effects on the 
cell cycle such as G0/G1 arrest associated with the upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 
(CDK) inhibitor p21
WAF-1(Escoubet-Lozach, 2009 ), downregulation of the expression of 
interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) in MM cell lines ( Li, 2011 ), and modulation of Rho 
guanosine-5'-triphosphate binding and hydrolyzing enzymes, which are crit ical for actin 
hyperpolymerization and immune synapse formation ( Xu, 2009 ).
It has become clear that inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many 
diseases, including cancer.  Pomalidomide has numerous anti-inflammatory effects, including 
enhancing T cell and NK cell-mediated immunity and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine 
production (eg, TNF- αand IL-6) by peripheral bl ood mononuclear cells. Pomalidomide 
augments T helper cell type 1 (Th1) (cell-med iated), and inhibits Th2 (humoral-mediated) T cell 
responses.  Pomalidomide enhances T cell prolifer ation and production of the Th1 cytokines IL-2

Pomalidomide also inhibits angiogenesis by bloc king the migration and adhesion of endothelial 
cells.  Angiogenesis plays an important role in the growth and progression of hematopoietic and solid tumors and depends on proper activation, pro liferation, adhesion, migration, and maturation 
of endothelial cells in order to form functional vessels.  In vitro, pomalidomide inhibited 
umbilical cord microvessel formation as well as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced endothelial cord formation ( Payvandi, 2005; Lu, 2009 ).  Furthermore, pomalidomide
inhibited endothelial cell invasion (through fibronectin -coated membranes) toward VEGF, basic 
fibroblast growth factor ( β-FGF), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF- α), and TNF- α, 
suggesting that the pomalidomide antiangiogenic activity is in part due to inhibition of 
endothelial cell migration ( Dredge, 2002 ).
1.2.2. Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Pomalidomide
1.2.2.1. Pharmacokinetics in Adults
Pomalidomide has been evaluated with respect to its absorption, distribution, metabolism and 
elimination characteristics.  Pomalidomide was absorbed in healthy subjects under fasting
conditions at single, orally administered doses of 0.5 mg to 50 mg with a maximum plasma 
concentration (C
max) at a median time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of approximately
3 hours postdose at clinically relevant doses.  The systemic exposure of single dose 
pomalidomide as determined from the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC 0-tz
and AUC 0-∞) increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner, whereas Cmaxincreased in 
a proportional manner over 0.5 mg to 2 mg and in a less than dose proportional manner over the
1 mg to 50 mg dose range.  Exploratory analysis suggests absorption rate decreases at doses 
greater than 10 mg.  Multiple dose exposure over the 0.5 mg to 2 mg dose range was 
approximately dose proportional, with pomalido mide reaching steady-state by Day 3.
Pomalidomide was evaluated for potential food effect interaction as a capsule formulation that 
was used during development but not commercialized.  The effect of food, such as a high-fat
meal, was evaluated with that formulation in a single dose study in healthy subjects according to the appropriate FDA Guidance “Guidance for Industry Food-Effect Bioavailability and Fed 
Bioequivalence Studies” December 2002. The median T
maxobserved in the fed state was 
approximately 3 hours later than that observed in the fasted state.  Exposure to pomalidomide 
was slightly decreased with food.  The mean ratio estimates for C maxand AUC 0-twere 75.6% and 
91.5% in the fed state r elative to the fasted state, respectively.  The mean plasma terminal 
elimination half-life (t 1/2)of pomalidomide was not affected by food administration.  In 
summary, a high-fat meal decreased the rate of absorption but had minimal effect on overall 
extent of absorption; therefore, pomalidomide can be ad ministered without regard to food intake.
The distribution of pomalidomide to brain has been characterized in mice and rats.  An oral 
administration of pomalidomide to mice and rats resulted in pomalidomide brain to plasma/blood 
ratios ranging from 0.39 to 0.49, indicating adequate pomalidomide distribution into the brain 
(Report AP1505/AP1506).  The distribution of pomalidomide has been characterized in humans with a mean volume of distribution (Vd/F) (coefficient of variation %) of pomalidomide in 
healthy subjects after a single dose ranging from 74 L (20%) to 138 L (30%) across a dose range

Confidential and Propri etary 22 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 2017of 1 mg to 10 mg daily.  Pomalidomide distributes into semen, with a geometric mean 
concentration of 16.4 ng/mL at 4 hours postdose after 4 daily doses of 2 mg. This value was 
approximately 67% of pomalidomide plasma concentr ation observed at the same time point on 
Day 5 (ie, 24.5 ng/mL).  In vitro data indicate that pomalidomide protein binding in human plasma was low to moderate (15.8% for R-enantio mer, 42.2% for S-enantiomer) and the binding 
was concentration independent.
The metabolism of pomalidomide has been evaluated both preclinically and in healthy human 
subjects.  In vitro, pomalidomide (up to 30 μM) did not inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, 
2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4/5 activities in human liver microsomes.  
Treatment of cultured human hepatocytes wit h up to 3 μM pomalidomide twice daily for 3 
consecutive days had little i nductive eff ect on the enzymatic activities of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5.  In transporter-expressing cells, pomalidomide had little to 
no inhibitory effects on P-glycoprotein, breast can cer resistant protein, organic anion transporter 
(OAT)1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or organic cation transporter (OCT)2.  When evaluated 
in the human absorption, distri bution, metabolism, and excretion study, eight metabolites were
detected in plasma, each at exposures < 10% of the plasma pomalidomide.  The metabolites 
observed were formed primarily via hydroxylatio n with subsequent glucuronidation or 
hydrolysis of the parent compound.  CY P-dependent metabolites accounted for approximately
43% of the excreted radioactivity, while non-CYP-dependent hy drolytic m etabolites accounted
for 25%, and excretion of unchanged pomalidomide accounted for 10%.
The elimination of pomalidomide occurs predominantly through renal excretion (~73% of the 
administered dose), with < 3% of the administered dose excreted in urine as unchanged pomalidomide across all dose levels.
Pomalidomide has been evaluated for potential drug interaction effects in healthy subjects. 
Pomalidomide is partly metabolized by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4/5 and is also a substrate for P- glycoprotein. In CC-4047-CP-008 study, co-administration of pomalidomide with the strong 
CYP3A4/5 and P-glycoprotein inhibitor “ketoconazole”, or the strong CYP3A4/5 inducer 
“carbamazepine”, had no clinically relevant effect on exposure to pomalidomide. Co-administration of a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor (fluvoxamine) with pomalidomide in the presence 
of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (keto conazole) approx imately doubled th e mean e xposure to 
pomalidomide compared to pomalidomide with ketoconazole alone.  In this study, co-
administration with moderate to strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (eg, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, 
fluvoxamine, etc) are not permitted due to the potential drug interactions with pomalidomide.  
Subjects taking a known moderate to strong CYP1A2 inhibitor are excluded.  
1.2.2.2. Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Populations
A Phase 1, dose escalation trial of pomalidomide in pediatric subjects with recurrent, refractory 
or progressive CNS tumors performed within the PBTC (PBTC-043) is currently ongoing.  To date, pharmacokinetic (PK) data have been co llected from 17 pediatric subjects.  In general, 
pomalidomide exposures for both AUC and C
maxappeared to increase in a dose dependent 
manner from 1.9 mg/m2to 3.4 mg/m2. Mild to moderate between-subject variability was 
observed for both AUC and C maxin pediatric subjects.  Preliminary PK data analyses suggest that 
the clearances (CL/F) in pediatric subjects correlate with body surface area, body weight, and 
age.

Confidential and Propri etary 23 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 20171.2.3. Adult Clinical Trials of Pomalidomide
Pomalidomide has been studied in adult hematologic malignancies and solid tumors as part of 
Celgene-sponsored and Investigator initiated trials (IITs).  The majority of the current safety and 
efficacy profile has been generated on studies in the approved indication, relapsed and/or refractory MM.  As of 07 Feb 2016, approximately 41,000 patients are estimated to have 
received 1 or more doses of pomalidomide ra nging from 0.5 mg to 50 mg in clinical studies and 
the commercial setting.
Pomalidomide was well tolerated in Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers at doses of up to 
50 mg. All AEs were considered by the Investigators to be mild or moderate in severity and 
there was no discernible trend in type of AE.  Ov erall, the healthy subject studies did not result in 
any new safety signals.
Pomalidomide was generally well tolerated in solid tumor studies, including studies in small cell 
lung cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer, so ft tissue sarcomas, pancreatic cancer and 
advanced solid tumors, with no significant safety findings ( Amato, 2011 ; Ellis, 2013 ).
The most frequently occ urring treatment emerge nt adverse events (TEAEs) across clinical 
studies (in hematologic and solid tumors) we re fatigue, anemia, and neutropenia, except for 
study in patients with myelofibrosis (MF), where the most frequently reported TEAE in 
pomalidomide-treated subjects was peripheral edema.  Other less frequently occurring TEAEs 
observed in the majority of studies were constipation, nausea and dyspnea.  The most frequently occurring Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs across studies were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia.  
As shown in a Phase 1 study ( Richardson, 2013 ), the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in 
subjects with relapsed and refractory MM appeared to have a relationship to the dose of pomalidomide.  In this study, Grade 4 neutropenia was managed by dose reductions and/or 
interruptions and growth fact or support (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]
treatment).
Across most of the completed studies of efficacy an d safety, serious adverse events (SAEs) were 
reported by approximately 40% to 70% of subjects. Infections, particularly pneumonia, were the 
most frequently reported SAE in subjects across studies
Overall pomalidomide was tolerated at doses of up to 50 mg in a Phase 1 single-dose study, well 
tolerated when orally administered at doses of 1 mg and 2 mg daily in subjects with prostate 
cancer, up to 2 mg daily, 5 mg every other day, or 4 mg/day for 21 of 28 days in a multiple-dose 
study in subjects with relapsed or refractory MM, and at 0.5 mg daily in subjects with MF. Data 
from the ongoing studies are consistent with the completed studies and demonstrate that 
pomalidomide has an acceptable safety profile in the intended subject populations studied to 
date.
1.2.4. Pediatric Clinical Trials of Pomalidomide
In the Phase 1 dose escalation trial of pomalidomide monotherapy in children with recurrent, 
progressive or refractory CNS tumors (PBTC- 043), subjects were treated at doses levels of 
1.9, 2.6 and 3.4 mg/m
2/day on Days 1 through 21 of a 28-day cycle.  The maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) of 2.6 mg/m2/day was reached with 3 subject s experiencing a total of 4 dose 
limiting toxicities (DLTs) at the 3.4 mg/m2/day dose level. These DLTs included Grade 4

The main toxicity (most commonly reported Grade 3/4 AE) associated with pomalidomide 
treatment was myelosuppression (decreased neutrophils, platelets, lymphocytes and anemia).  Myelosuppression is a known adverse effect of pomalidomide treatment and can be managed 
effectively with supportive care.  Myelosuppression was also the main toxicity observed in the 
Phase 1 studies of lenalidomide in children with CNS tumors ( Warren, 2011 ; Berg, 2011 ).  The 
majority of cases observed during the PTBC-043 study resolved without sequelae. 
Per protocol, expansion cohorts were initiate d with further enrollment at the MTD stratified 
based on age (< 12 years vs. ≥12 years) and steroid use (not on steroids [or on physiologic doses 
alone] vs. those taking therapeutic doses of steroids).  No excessive toxicities or unexpected 
safety concerns have further been identified.  One subject in the expansion cohort experienced a 
DLT of Grade 4 platelet count decrease; however, per protocol, the criteria for modifying the already identified MTD was not reached . This study is currently ongoing. 
1.3. Rationale
1.3.1. Study Rationale and Purpose
Although the prognosis for pediatric patients with brain tumors has improved over the last few 
decades with diverse intensive therapeutic modalities such as ne urosurgery, chemotherapy and 
radiation, many brain tumors remain difficult to treat and are associated with a poor prognosis.  Overall, brain tumors are still the leading cause of cancer morbidity and mortality among 
children.  Therefore, alternative therapeutic strategies are desperately needed and pomalidomide 
is considered to be well suited to treat pediat ric brain tumors given its multi-modal mechanism of 
action and seeming ability to c ross the blood-brain barrier.
Pomalidomide can cross the blood-brain barrier
Central nervous system tumors may have a specialized immunobiology that allows evasion of 
immune clearance and promotion of tumor growth, and the tissue milieu within which a CNS 
tumor grows may be especially important in s upporting this  immunobiology.  This immunology 
of the CNS excludes or attenuates effective immune responses in malignancies, which may contribute to resistance to standard radiation and chemotherapy.  The presence of the blood-brain 
barrier limits the CNS penetration of many chemotherapeutic agents and although it does not 
block lymphocytes or myeloid cells from migrating to sites of inflammation or tumor growth, these components of the immune system are ineffective in producing an immune response thus 
maintaining the “immune privilege” status of the CNS ( Johnson, 2012 ).  Pomalidomide has been 
shown to have moderate CNS penetration in murine models of CNS lymphoma with significant therapeutic activity and a major impact on the CNS tumor microenvironment ( Li, 2013 ).  
Approximately 39% of systemically administered pomalidomide penetrated the CNS.  These 
data indicate that pomalidomide may be suitable for treatment of primary CNS tumors and brain metastases.  Consistent with this, there are clinical reports in adults demonstrating 
pomalidomide’s effectiveness against myeloma meningitis and CNS myelomatosis, again 
suggesting adequate CNS penetration and efficacy within the CNS ( Gertz, 2013; Mussetti, 
2013 ).

Confidential and Propri etary 25 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 2017Pomalidomide has anti-angiogenic properties
Angiogenesis plays a role in tumor growth and metastases in CNS tumors ( Sie, 2014 ).  Pediatric 
brain tumors have previously been shown to possess significant neovascularization and can 
produce potent angiogenic factors ( Ozer, 2004; Sie, 2014 ).  Many of the common histologies 
among pediatric brain tumors, such as embryonal  tumors (medulloblastoma, atypical teratoid 
rhabdoid tumor [ATRT], low grade-gliomas, and high-grade gliomas exhibit significant 
angiogenic activity.  Similar to other tumors, pediatric brain tumors secrete cytokines with varying angiogenic properties, such as acidic and basic fibroblastic growth factor ( α,β-FGF), 
angiogenin, TNF- α, and VEGF, which assist in cell proliferation, metastases and survival.  
Alternatively, tumor cells can release angiogenic peptides through the production of proteases and the subsequent breakdown of the extracellular matrix where some cytokines are stored (ie, β-
FGF).  Angiogenesis can also be induced indirectly through the recruitment of inflammatory 
cells (particularly macrophages) and their subsequent release of angiogenic cytokines (ie, TNF- α, 
β-FGF) ( Jain, 2007 ).  Pomalidomide has demonstrated antiangiogenic activity (Section 1.2.1 ), 
which makes it an ideal candidate for treating pediatric brain tumors.
Lenalidomide (related agent) is well tolerated in children with brain and solid tumors 
A pediatric Phase 1 study of lenalidomide was performed within the Children’s Oncology Group 
(COG) in subjects with relapsed or refractory solid tumors or MDS (ADVL0319) ( Berg, 2011 ).  
The primary objectives were to determine the MTD or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)for children with refractory solid tumors and de scribe the toxicities in this population.  Forty-
nine subjects treated at doses up to 70 mg/m
2/day x 21 days followed by a 7-day rest were 
evaluated.  Although 6 episodes of DLTs were observed, the DLTs were sporadic and not clearly associated with dose.  These DLTs in cluded Grade 3 hypercalcemia, Grade 3 hypophosphate mia, 
Grade 3 hypokalemia, Grade 4 neutropenia, Grade 3 somnolence, and Grade 3 urticaria 
occurring at doses ranging from 15 mg/m
2to 55 mg/m2.  The MTD was not reached.  No 
objective responses were observed; however, there was evidence of immunomodulatory activity 
of lenalidomide with a significant increase in serum IL-2, IL-15, granulocyte-macrophage 
colony-stimulating factor, NK cells, NK cytotoxi city, and lym phokine activated killer 
cytotoxicity, and a significant decrease in CD4 +/CD25 + regulatory T cells.
A Phase 1 trial of lenalidomide in pediatric subjects with recurrent, refractory or progressive 
CNS tumors was performed within the PBTC (PBTC-018) ( Warren, 2011 ).  Fifty-one subjects 
were enrolled; 44 subjects were evaluable for toxi city and response.  Subjects were treated at 
doses levels of 15, 20, 25, 32, 40, 52, 68, 88, 101 and 116 mg/m2/day for Days 1 through 21 of a 
28-day cycle.  A MTD was not reached and lenalidomide was relatively well tolerated.  Two DLTs were reported with an unclear association with lenalidomide.  One subject treated at the 
20 mg/m
2/day dose level experienced a cardiac DLT wi th a presumed myocardial infarct and 
elevated troponin; however, this subject was subsequently found to have had multiple risk factors for thromboembolism.  One subject at a dose level 68 mg/m
2/day had dose-limiting fatigue 
associated with concurrent di sease progression.  Twenty-three subjects representing all dose 
levels received 6 or more cycles of treatment a nd 9 subjects have received 12 or more cycles. 
In the PBTC-018 study ( Warren, 2011 ), myelosuppression was the primary toxicity and occurred 
sporadically.  No subject had Grade 4 myelos uppression during Cycle 1.  Myelosuppression for 
subjects treated for ≥ 6 cycles was also sporadic and not clearly associated with dose although 
data at the higher dose levels ( ≥ 68 mg/m2/day) showed a possible trend toward more frequent

gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea (10%), emesis (4%), diarrhea (16%), and 
constipation (8%), as well as rash (14%) and muscle cramping (10%).  In this study, it was 
unclear if responses were dose-related.  Objective responses (two partial responses) were reported; one in a subject diagnosed with PA treated with 88 mg/m
2/day for 18 cycles and 
another subject diagnosed with optic pathway glioma treated with 116 mg/m2/day for 11 cycles. 
Long-term stable disease (SD; SD sustained for ≥6 cycles), particularly in patients with low 
grade glioma, was observed in 52% of patients.  Of note, the 12-month PFS rate for patients with 
low grade glioma was 67%.  Results from PK analysis show that the lenalidomide AUC and C max
increased with dosage over the range studied.  The median lenalidomide plasma t 1/2and apparent 
oral clearance were 2.5 hours (range, 0.9 to 4.2 hours) and 11.4 L/h/m2(range, 5.1 to 33.9 
L/h/m2), respectively. 
Based on the apparent activity profile of lenalidomide in children with low-grade gliomas 
enrolled in the pediatric Phase 1 study (PBTC-018), a Phase 2 trial (ACNS1022) of lenalidomide 
monotherapy in PA and optic pathway gliomas was initiated. This study compares low dose 
(20 mg/m2/day) with high dose (115 mg/m2/day) lenalidomide.  A planned interim analysis for 
futility and e fficacy, evaluating both objective responses and PFS, was performed after the first 
20 subjects were enrolled in each arm.  Both arms met the criteria for continued accrual and this 
study is currently ongoing.  
Pomalidomide is a more potent antiproliferative and immunomodulating agent than 
lenalidomide
Although there is overlap between pomalidomide and lenalidomide in terms of pharmacologic 
effects, there are data suggesting that they may also have different targets.  Notably, 
pomalidomide has demonstrated activity in lenalidomide-resistant cell lines and in adult patients 
with MM refractory to lenalidomide treatment, s uggesting unique targets and properties between 
these two agents ( Li, 2010; Lopez-Girona, 2012; Cooney, 2012; Schey, 2011; Richardson, 2014 ).  
In addition, pomalidomide exhibits greater poten cy than lenalidomide in anti-proliferative 
effects, augmentation of CD4+and CD8+T cell proliferation, Th1 cytokine production and NK
T cell activation ( Corral, 1999; Muller, 1999 ).  These differences allow the administration of 
pomalidomide at relatively lower doses compared with lenalidomide in adult patients with MM
and may allow for lower therapeutic doses in pediatric patients as well.
1.3.2. Rationale for the Study Design
This is a Phase 2, multicen ter, open-label, parallel- group study that will assess the efficacy, 
safety and tolerability of pomalidomide in ch ildren and young adults with recurrent or 
progressive brain tumors.  
The proposed age groups to be studied are subjects  1 to < 21 years of age.   Subjects < 1 years of 
age are more likely to be undergoing first line therapy for their brain tumors, are less likely to have already experienced recurrence or progre ssion of disease, have a rapidly developing 
immune system and tolerability of pomalidomide is unknown.  The upper age limit was selected 
because the treatment options and number of clinical trials for young adult subjects between 18-21 years of age are limited due to the significant differences in histologic subtypes and biology
of brain tumors between these subjects and younger children or adults ( Bleyer, 2004 ). In the 
absence of treatment options tailored for adolescents and young adults with brain cancer,

based regimens rather than those designed for adults.  
A Simon’s Optimal two-stage study design w ill be applied across the strata (Section 3.1),
conducted in parallel. The design was chosen to limit subject’s exposure to pomalidomide in each group prior to confirmation of preliminary e fficacy and enrollment of additional subjects 
into that tumor type cohort. Objective response ( OR; either complete response [CR] or partial 
response [PR]) rate (ORR) and long-term SD (SD maintained for ≥ 6 cycles [> 3 cy cles for 
DIPG]) rate w ill be evalu ated as a combined endpoint for defining antitumor activity in each 
stage. Long-term SD was chosen to be included since it has been reported to correlate with OS
(Warren, 2013 ).
This study design will provide further informatio n on the antitumor activity and safety of 
pomalidomid e in children and young adults and establish if any of these brain tumors are 
sensitive to pomalidomide and should be further explored.
1.3.3. Rationale for Dose, Schedule and Regimen Selection
In the Phase 1 study conducted by the PBTC  (PTBC-043), pomalidomide dose was escalated to 
establish the MTD in children with histologically confirmed diagnosis of recurrent, progressive or refractory CNS tumors.  Subjects were treated at dose levels of 1.9, 2.6 and 3.4 mg/m
2/day on 
Days 1 through 21 of a 28-day cycle.  A MTD of 2.6 mg/m2/day was reached with three subjects 
each experiencing one DLT at the 3.4 mg/m2/day dose level.  The MTD of 2.6 mg/m2/day is 
comparable to the FDA-approved adult dose (4 mg /day) of pomalidomide taken orally on Days 
1-21 of a 28-day cycle, assuming an aver age adult body surface area (BSA) of 1.7 m2(4 mg/1.7 
m2= 2.35 mg/m2).
The starting dose in this Phase 2 study will be 2.6 mg/m2/day on Days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle. 
Four consecutive weeks will constitute one cy cle and subsequent cycles will immediately follow 
as long as criteria to continue pomalidomide t herapy are met. A cycle may be repeated every 
28 days, for up to 24 cycles or until documented progressive disease (PD), withdrawal of 
consent/assent, treatment becomes intolera ble or death, whichever comes first.  
Dosing will be based on the subject’s actual BSA calculated at the beginning of each cycle of 
therapy.

3.1. Study Design
This is a Phase 2 multi-center, open-label, parallel-group st udy that w ill assess the efficacy, 
safety and tolerability of pomalidomide in childre n and young adults aged  1 to < 21 years with 
recurrent or progressive primary brain tumors after at least one prior standard therapy.  
The study will consist of 4 parallel strata, one for each of the following primary brain tumor 
types: high-grade glioma, medulloblastoma , ependymoma and DIPG.  A Simon’s Optimal two-
stage study design will be applied to each stratum and enrollment will occur as follows:
!Stage 1: Nine sub jects will be  enrolled.
!Stage 2: If during Stage 1, ≥ 2 subjects achieves either an OR (either CR or PR)
within the first 6 cycles of treatment (within first 3 cycles for DIPG), or a long-term 
SD, an additional 11 subjects shall be enrolled; otherwise no additional subjects will 
be enrolled into that stratum.
!If a total of 5 or more subjects across all 20 subjects in a given stratum (Stage 1 and 
2) evaluable for the primary endpoint are observed as having either an OR (either CR 
or PR) within the first 6 cycles of treatment (wi thin first 3 cycles for DIPG) or a long-
term SD, pomalidomide will be considered effective in that disease indication.
Subjects who withdraw from either stage for reasons other than PD prior to completing Cycle 1 
of study treatment w ill be replaced.  Subjects completing at least one cycle of study therapy but 
not having at least one post-baseline disease a ssessment will be considered a non-responder.  
The study will have the following sequential periods for all subjects ( Figure 2 ): Screening Period
(Section 6.1), Treatment Period (Section 6.2) and Follow-up Period (Section 6.3).  Upon 
enrollment, subjects will receive oral pomalidomide for the first 21 days, followed by a 7-day rest period, of each 28-day treatment cy cle for up to 24 cycles or until documented PD, 
withdrawal of consent/assent, treatment becomes intolerable or death, whichever occurs first. 
Radiographic response (brain and spine) will be assessed by MRI with and without contrast (ie, 
gadolinium). Brain MRI assessments will be conducted during screening (within 21 days prior 
to first dose of study treatment) and then on Day 1 of Cycles 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22 (or within 
7 days prior to dosing), after completion of Cycle 24 (or within 7 days prior) and as clinically 
indicated.  Note: For DIPG subjects only, post-baseline brain MRI assessments will be 
performed on Day 1 of Cycles 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22 ( or within 7 days prior to dosing), after 
completion of Cycle 24 (or within 7 days prior) and as clinically indicated.  
Spine MRI will be also performed during screening (within 21 days prior to first dose of study 
treatment) for all subjects.  If no spinal or leptomeningeal disease is present at screening, 
subsequent spine MRIs will be obtained on Day 1 of Cycles 7, 13, 19 (or within 7 days prior to 
dosing) after completion of Cycle 24 (or within 7 days prior) and as clinically indicated.  If there 
is spinal or leptomeningeal disease present at screening/baseline, spine MRIs will be obtained at 
the same time points as the brain MRI as specified above.

reasons other than progression of disease and it ha s been more than 8 weeks since their most 
recent scan/response assessment.
Response evaluations will be performed locally and by independent central reviewer according 
to criteria detailed in Section 6.4.1 .  
Subjects who discontinue treatment will enter a Follow-up Period which will continue every 
3 months (± 14 days) for up to 5 years from enrollment of the last subject, unless consent/assentis withdrawn, the subject is lost to follow- up or dies.  Subjects will be followed by phone or 
clinic visits for emergence of second primary malignancies (SPMs) (regardless of causal 
relationship), drug-related  SAEs, survival status, and start of any new anticancer therapies.  
Additionally, subjects who discontinue treatment pri or to progression will be followed with MRI 
tumor response disease assessments every 6 months from treatment discontinuation for the first 
year off treatment, then annually thereafter, until disease progression or until another anticancer therapy is started, whichever comes first.
An external data monitoring committee (DMC) (S ection 9.9.2 ) with multidisciplinary 
representation will evaluate activity of the study treatment and safety d ata periodically to 
monitor benefit-to-risk of this protocol.  The function of the DMC is to monitor the safety and 
activity of the study tr eatment and to provide recommendations about the study continuation, as 
appropriate.  Details of the DMC structure, composition, and roles/responsibilities will be outlined within a DMC charter. 
The study will be conducted in compliance w ith the International Council on Harmonisation 
(ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registr ation of Pharmaceu ticals for Human Use/G ood 
Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.

The Screening Period will start from the time of obtaining informed consent/assent and last no 
more than 28 days, at which time the Treatment Period w ill begin (Cycle 1 Day 1, first day of 
actual study drug administration).  Each subject shall receive treatment for up to 24 cycles or 
until documented PD, consent/assent is withdra wn, treatment becomes intolerable, or death, 
whichever occurs first.  Once treatment has been discontinued, subjects will enter into a Follow-
up Period with phone call/clinic visit every 3 months (± 14 days), for up to 5 years from 
enrollment of the la st subject, unless consent/assent is withdrawn, the sub ject is lost to follow-up, 
or death.
Stage 1 portion of the study is expected to last up to approximately 18 months prior to reaching 
the decision point. The Stage 2 portion of the study is expected to last up to approximately 27
months should all strata enroll the maximum number of subjects and assuming no subjects are 
replaced.  
3.3. End of Trial
The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last subject to complete the

recurrent or progressive primary brain tumors af ter at least one prior standard therapy, in 1 of 4
primary brain tumor types: high-grade glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma and DIPG.  
Eighty subjects (36 subjects in Stage 1 and 44 subjects in Stage 2) will be included should all strata enroll the maximum number of subjects and assuming no subjects are replaced.  
Approximately 80% of subjects across all strata will be < 17 years of age.
4.2. Inclusion Criteria
Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:
1. Subject is 1 to < 21 years of age at the time of signing the ICF/IAF.
2. Subject (when applicable, parental/legal representative) must understand and voluntarily 
sign an ICF/IAF prior to any study-related assessments/procedures being conducted. 
Note: Adult individuals who lack capacity to consent for themselves will be excluded

acuity disease requiring immediate treatment with pomalidomide. The pregnancy test 
within 24 hours prior to the first dose of pomalidomide is required to be performed.
The subject may not receive pomalidomide until the Investigator has verified that the 
results of these pregnancy tests performed on Cycle 1, Day 1 are negative.  F emale 
children of childbearing potential/females of childbearing potential with regular or no menstrual cycles must agree to have pregnancy tests weekly for the first 28 days
study participation, every 28 days while on study, at study treatment discontinuation 
visit, and at Day 28 following pomalidomid e discontinuation.  If menstrual cycles are 
irregular, the pregnancy testing must occur weekly for the first 28 days of study 
participation and then every 14 days  while on study, at study treatment 
discontinuation visit, and at Days 14 and 28 following pomalidomide discontinuation.  
!Female subjects must ,as appropriate to age and at the discretion of the study 
Investigator ,either commit to true abstinence* from heterosexual contact (which 
must be reviewed on a monthly basis) and/or agree to the use of two reliable forms of approved and effective contraceptive methods simultaneously.  The two methods of 
reliable contraception must include one highly effective method (ie, oral, injectable, 
or implantable hormonal contraceptive; tubal ligation; intrauterine device; vasectomized partner) and one additional e ffective barrier method (ie, male condom, 
diaphragm, cervical cap) 28 days prior to  starting pomalidomide, throughout the

discontinuation of pomalidomide.
Note: Only a progestin-suppressing ovulation pill is acceptable as an oral 
contraceptive.  Copper intrauterine devices are not recommended.
!All male and female subjects must follow all requirements defined in the 
pomalidomide Pregnancy Prevention Program.
18. Male subjects must, as appropriate to age and the discretion of the study physician:
!Practice true abstinence* (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to 
use a condom during sexual contact with  a pregnant f emale or a FCBP while 
participating in the study, during dose interruptions and for at least 28 days following 
pomalidomide discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy or practices complete abstinence. 
*True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
subject.  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) 
and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
19.For subjects screened/enrolled in France only : Subject must be affiliated with a Health 
Insurance Scheme or be a beneficiary of one.

resection, within 21 days from first dose of study drug.
5. Subject has previously received (presence of any of the following will exclude a subject 
from enrollment):
!Any prior treatment with pomalidomide.  Subjects who have prior treatment with 
other immunomodulatory compounds (thalidomide, lenalidomide) ARE eligible if they meet all other eligibility criteria and did not have allergic reactions or other
“significant toxicity” per Investigator disc retion associated with lenalidomide or 
thalidomide use.

All procedures will be performed as outlined in the Table of Events ( Table 4 ) and further 
detailed in the respective protocol referenced sections below.  In the table, required assessments 
are indicated with an “X” at the visits for which the assessments are to be performed.  All data 
obtained from these assessments must be supported in the subject’s source documentation.  No electronic case report form (eCRF) will be used as a source document.  Scheduled assessments 
should be completed prior to study treatment administration unless noted otherwise.
6.1. Screening Period
Screening evaluations will be performed for all subjects to determine study eligibility.  All 
clinical evaluations to establish eligibility must be performed within 28 days prior to Cycle 1, 
Day 1 (first dose of study drug), unless noted ot herwise. MRI assessments must be performed 
within 21 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1.  Eligibility waivers to the protocol will not be granted 
during the conduct of this trial, under any circumstances.
Safety laboratory analyses and all assessments will be performed locally.  Screening laboratory 
values may be repeated within the screening wi ndow, if necessary.  If any laboratory value does 
not meet eligibility criteria prior to the first dose (Cycle 1, Day 1) of study treatment, the subject 
will be considered a screen failure.  Subjects who fail screening may be rescreened at the 
Investigator’s discretion.  For subjects who are rescreened, a new ICF/IAF will need to be signed and screening procedures will need to be repeated (if rescreening occurs > 28 days prior to the 
original screening date).  A new subject identification (ID) will be issued once the rescreening 
transaction is registered in Interactive Response Technology (IRT). 
The following will be performed at screening as specified in the Table of Events ( Table 4 ), and 
further detailed in the protocol referenced Section 6.4, after informed consent/assent has been 
obtained:

Protocol CC-4047-BRN-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 47 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 20176.1.3. Complete Medical History
A complete medical history including evaluation for preceding medical disorders and past (up to 
5 years) or present cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, neurological, 
endocrine, lymphatic, hematological, immunological , dermatological, psychiatric, genitourinary, 
obstetrical, surgical history (including those related to disease under study) or any other disorders 
will also be documented at screening.  
6.1.4. Prior Disease History and Therapies
The subject’s current disease (ie, diagnosis, date of diagnosis, grading/staging, and histology), as 
well as all prior disease therapies including surgery, rad iation, SCT, chemotherapy, systemic or 
any other therapy for the subject’s disease will be recorded on the respective eCRF at screening.  
6.1.5. Enrollment
Prior to enrolling a subject, written informed consent/assent must be obtained, all screening 
evaluations must be completed, and eligibility criteria  must be verified by the Investigator.  Once 
these actions have been completed, the Investigator or designated staff will log into IRT and 
confirm that the subject still fulfills all the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  After enrollment, the subject will retain his/her Subject ID number (Section 7.3.1 ) during participation in the study.
6.2. Treatment Period
The subject will begin treatment upon re-confirmation of eligibility (ie, safety assessments) and 
subsequent enrollment.  The subj ect must s tart treatment within 28 days of signing the ICF/IAF. 
For all subsequent visits, an administrative window of ± 3 days is permitted unless noted 
otherwise for a particular assessment. Brain and spine MRI assessments can be conducted within 
7 days prior to the scheduled timepoint (ie, duri ng study drug rest period). Study visit windows 
should take into account the subject’s investigational product (IP) supply and administration.  
Note: Safety laboratory (hematology, serum blood chemistry) and physical examinations do not 
need to be repeated on Cycle 1, Day 1 if perform ed within 7 days of starting treatment unless 
clinically indicated; however, for FCCBP/FCBP subjects, a urine or serum pregnancy test must 
be performed to assess subject eligibility 10 to 14 da ys prior to and again within 24 hours prior to 
the first administration of pomalidomide. The pregnancy test 10 to 14 days prior to initiation of 
pomalidomide however may be omitted, at th e discretion of the investigator, for any 
FCCBP/FCBP who has high acuity disease requiring immediate treatment with pomalidomide. The pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to the first dose of pomalidomide is required to be 
performed (refer to Section 6.4.2.9 ).
The Treatment Period is defined as the time starting from first study drug administration 
(Cycle 1, Day 1) until permanent study treatment di scontinuation.  Subjects will be administered 
pomalidomide on Days 1 to 21 of each 28-day  treatment cycle for a maximum of 24 cycles. 
Pomalidomide will not be administered on Days 22 through 28 of the 28-day treatment cycle.  
The following evaluations will be performed at the frequency specified in the Table of Events 
(Table 4 ) and further detailed in the protocol referenced Section 6.4. The evaluations should be 
performed prior to dosing on the vis it day, unless otherwise specified.

6.3.2. Second Primary Malignancy Follow-up Period
Second primary malignancies will be monitored as events of interest and must be reported as 
SAEs.  This includes any SPM, regardless of causal relationship to study drug, occurring throughout the subject’s entire participation in the study.  Subjects that do not receive treatment 
(eg, screen failures) will not be followed for SPM. Further details are described in Section 
6.4.2.10 .
6.3.3. Long-term Follow-up
After permanent study drug discontinuation, all subjects will be followed every 3 months 
(± 14 days) from the 28-day post-treatment Safety Follow-up Visit for SPMs (regardless of causal relationship), any drug-related SAEs, OS, and start of any new anticancer therapies.  
Follow-up will continue every 3 months for up to 5 years after the last subject enrollment, unless 
consent/assent is withdrawn, the subject is lost to follow-up, or death.  
Note: The Long-term Follow-up Period may not be terminated because of starting a new 
anticancer treatment.
In addition, subjects that discontinue treatment prior to disease progression will be followed for
MRI tumor response assessments every 6 months from treatment discontinuation for the first 
year off treatment, then annually thereafter until PD, withdrawal of consent/assent, start of new 
anticancer therapy, lost to follow up or death, wh ichever occurs first.  These MRI scans will 
continue to be sent for independent central review.
Survival/long-term follow-up may be conducted by  clinic visits, by r ecord review (including 
public records) and/or telephone contact with the subject, family, or the subject’s treating physician.
6.4. Assessment Types
6.4.1. Efficacy Assessments
Brain tumor assessments will be conducted by MRI with and without contrast (ie, gadolinium) 
using 3 standard MRI sequences (T1-weighted pr e- and postcontrast, T2-weighted, FLAIR).  A

Confidential and Propri etary 51 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 2017spine MRI with contrast (ie, gadolinium) will also be performed as specified in Table 4 .  The 
neuroradiologist may select the appropriate sequence that best highlights the tumor (T1-weighted 
postcontrast or T2-weighted or FLAIR) and the same sequence should be used for serial 
measurements (Section 6.4.1.2 ). Further details regarding MRI acquisition requirements are 
outlined in the Imaging Manual.
Brain MRI assessments will be conducted during scr eening (within 21 days prior to first dose of 
study treatment) and then on Day 1 of Cycles 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22 (or within 7 days prior to 
dosing), after completion of Cycle 24 (or with in 7 days prior) and as clinically indicated.  Note:
For DIPG subjects only, post-baseline brain MRI assessments will be performed on Day 1 of 
Cycles 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22 (or within 7 days prior to dosing), after completion of Cycle 24 (or within 7 days prior) and as clinically indicated.  
Spine MRI will be also performed during screening (within 21 days prior to first dose of study 
treatment) for all subjects.  If no spinal or lep tomeningeal disease is present at screening, 
subsequent spine MRIs will be obtained on Day 1 of Cycles 7, 13, 19 (or within 7 days prior to 
dosing), after completion of Cycle 24 (or within  7 days prior) and as clinically indicated.  If there 
is spinal or leptomeningeal disease present at screening/baseline, spine MRIs will be obtained at the same brain MRI time points specified above.
In addition, if clinically indicated and at the discretio n of the Investigator, CSF cytology will also 
be assessed to follow disease. It is recommended to follow at the same interval as required brain 
MRIs if positive at initiation of treatment.  Corticosteroid use and clinical assessments (ie,
neurologic status) w ill also be consid ered when determining overall response (S ection 6.4.1.7 ).
A response assessment should be performed at EOT visit if the subject has discontinued for 
reasons other than progression of disease and it ha s been more than 8 weeks since their most 
recent scan/response assessment. Subjects that discontinue treatment prior to disease progression 
will be followed for MRI tumor response every 6 months from treatment discontinuation for the first year off treatment, then annually thereafter until PD, start new anticancer therapy, 
withdrawal of consent/assent, lost to follo w-up or death, whichever occurs sooner.  
The same method of assessment and sequence/technique must be used to characterize each 
reported target and non-target lesions at baseline and subsequent scans after start of study 
treatment.  
Tumor response will be assessed both locally and by an independent central reviewer
(Section 6.4.1.7 ) according to the criteria described below. The local Investigator’s radiological 
assessment will be used for subject eligibility and treatment decisions.  Efficacy based endpoints 
incorporating tumor assessments (primary and secondary) will be based on the independent central assessment.  
6.4.1.1. Selection of Target and Non-Target Lesions

Confidential and Propri etary 52 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 2017dose of steroids for at least 5 days.  Subjects must have measurable disease (including subjects 
that have undergone a surgical resection prior to enro llment).  
!Measurable disease is defined as lesions that are (all criteria below are met):
∀Brain lesions which are the primary tumors
∀Measurable in 2 perpendicular diameters
∀At least twice the slice thickness on MRI (ie, visible on 2 or more axial slices)
Note: MRI should be performed with cuts of 3 mm or less in slice thickness 
contiguously.  
∀Do not include cavity or cyst in measurement (see Section 6.4.1.2 )
!Nonmeasurable disease is defined as (any criteria below are met): 
∀Spinal lesions 
∀Lesions with poorly defined margin on MRI
∀Cerebrospinal fluid 
∀Cystic or necrotic components (see Section 6.4.1.2 )
All target and non-target lesions should be identified and recorded at screening.
!For most CNS tumors, only one lesion/mass is  present and therefore this single lesion
is considered a “target” for measurement to assess tumor response and progression.
!Spinal lesions should be considered as non measurable disease (ie, non-target lesions); 
however, size should be noted and change in size should be evaluated.  
!All subjects should have at least one measurable, target lesion confirmed by MRI.  
Target lesions should be  selected on the basis of size (eg, largest) and su itability for 
accurate repeated measurements.  All othe r lesions will be followed as non-target 
lesions. 
!Leptomeningeal tumor spread is usually not a target lesion, and cannot be measured 
accurately; however, presence and location of leptomeningeal tumor spread should be 
noted and change in extent/thickness should be evaluated on assessments.
6.4.1.2. Methodology to Determine Tumor Measurement
Tumor dimensions will be determined by tw o-dimensional measurement of the longest diameter 
(width [W]) and the longest perpendicular diameter (transverse [T]) for each target lesion (Figure 3 ). Radiologist at each institution may select the appropriate sequence that best 
highlights the tumor (T1-weighted postcontrast or T2-weighted or FLAIR) and the same 
sequence should be used for serial measurements.
Radiographic response determination will be based on a comparison of an area (W x T) between 
the baseline assessment (or smallest disease measuremen ts recorded since the start of protocol 
therapy [nadir]) and the assessments post-treatmen t.  Assessments post tr eatment should reiterate 
the measurements obtained at baseline for each target lesion.

Protocol CC-4047-BRN-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 53 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 2017Tumor response criteria are determined by changes in size using the longest tumor diameter and 
its perpendicular diameter (W x T).  The following describes the measurement method:
!The longest diameter measurement (W) can be measured from the axial plane or the 
plane in which the tumor is best seen or measured.  The same plane chosen at baseline should be used in subsequent assessments. 
!The perpendicular diameter measurement (T) is maximal perpendicular to the W in 
the selected plane.
!The cystic or necrotic components of a tumor are not considered in tumor
measurements. Therefore, only the solid co mponent of cystic tumors should be 
measured.  If cyst/necrosis composes the majority of the lesion, the lesion may not be 
“measurable.” In general, such lesions should be considered non-target. 
Options:
∀If the cyst/necrosis is eccentric, the W and T of the solid portion should be 
measured, and the cyst/necrosis portion s hould be excluded from measurement.
∀If the cyst/necrosis is central but represents a small portion of the tumor (< 25%), 
the cyst/necrosis should be disregarded, and the entire tumor should be measured.
∀If the cyst/necrosis is central and represents a large portion of the tumor, identify 
a solid aspect of the tumor mass that can be reproducibly measured.

Source: Children’s Oncology Group (COG) guideline
6.4.1.3. Tumor Response Criteria for Target Lesions
1. Response criteria are assessed in 2 dimensions - the product of W x T2. The overall measurement of target lesions for a particular assessment is quantified by 
the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of all target lesions 
(eg, W
1xT 1+ W 2x T 2+ ….).
3. To assess response/progression, the ratio is calculated:
                                                   (            ⋯ ) (              )
                  (            ⋯ ) (                )
4. Radiographic response should be made in comparison to the tumor measurement 
obtained at baseline for the determination of response, and the smallest tumor 
measurement (nadir) either at baseline or after initiation treatment for determination of progression.

Protocol CC-4047-BRN-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 55 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 20175. Development of new disease or progression in any established lesions is considered 
progressive disease, regardless of response in other lesions, eg, when multiple lesions 
show opposite responses, the progressive disease takes precedence.
The tumor response categories for target lesions  are CR, PR, SD and PD and are further defined 
in Appendix B .  
6.4.1.4. Tumor Response Criteria for Non-Target Lesions
The tumor response categories for non-target les ions are CR, incomplete response (IR)/SD and 
PD and are further defined in Appendix B .  Non-target lesions are assessed subjectively and the 
decision when progression is evident is at the discretion of the radiologist/Investigator.
6.4.1.5. Clinical Status (Neurologic Symptoms/Examination)
The definition of clinical status and deterioration is  left to the discretion of the Investigator.  
Clinical deterioration should be attributable to neurologic abnormalities or worsening neurologic status not explained by causes unrelated to tumor progression (eg, anticonvulsant or 
corticosteroid toxicity wean, electrolyte dist urbances, sepsis, hyperglycemia, etc.) or changes in 
corticosteroid dose.
6.4.1.6. Corticosteroid Administration
An increase in corticosteroid dose alone will not cause determination of progression in the 
absence of clinical deterioration or radiographically documented lesion growth. For corticosteroid dose to be considered “stable or decreasing,” it should not be a greater dose than 
compared with baseline. For overall assessment of response (Section 6.4.1.7 ), physiologic 
replacement doses of corticosteroids, defined as no more than 0.75 mg/m
2/day of dexamethasone 
or equivalent, will be considered. 
6.4.1.7. Overall Response Assessment 
The overall response assessment takes into account response in both target and non-target
lesions, the appearance of new lesions, c urrent corticosteroid use (compared to 
screening/baseline) and neurologic symptoms/examination (clinical status) according to the criteria described in Appendix C .
Subjects who do not meet the criteria for an objective response or disease progression by the end 
of Cycle 6 (end of Cycle 3 for DIPG subjects) will be considered as having long-term SD.
6.4.1.8. Independent Central Response Review
Response evaluations will be based on MRI results obtained at each site and will assessed lo cally 
and by an independent central reviewer.  Corticosteroid use and clinical assessments (ie, neurologic status) w ill also be cons idered when determining overall res ponse.  The local 
Investigator’s assessmen t will be used for sub ject eligibility and treatment decisions.  Efficacy 
based endpoints incorporating tumor assessments (primary and secondary) will be based on the independent central assessment.  
Imaging/response data will be centrally collected and checked for quality by an imaging contract

assessment.  Further details regarding MRI acquisition requirements and image submission 
procedures are outlined in the Imaging Manual.
Details of the central review process and requirements for central imaging review will be 
described in the independent review charter.  Results of the central review will not be provided 
to the sites.  
6.4.2. Safety and Tolerability Assessments 
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all AEs, including SAEs, 
concomitant medications, SPMs, dose discontinuations, reductions and interruptions, the regular 
monitoring of hematology and blood chemistry, regular monitoring of vital signs and physical 
condition.  These assessments should be performed within the prescribed window of the 
scheduled day of assessment ( Table 4 ) and at any unscheduled visit if clinically indicated; 
however, AEs, concomitant medications and review for SPMs will be evaluated and recorded continuously throughout the study.
Note:   Pomalidomide experience in subjects < 3 years of age is limited.   As such, subjects 
< 3 years of age should be carefully monitored for safety and side effects (adverse effects).  In addition, as pomalidomide is m etabolized hepatically, subjects with hepatic impairment should 
also be carefully monitored.  In response to any safety concerns in subjects with hepatic 
impairment, Investigators should have a low threshold for performing additional safety evaluations (ie, hematology, blood chemistry, physical exams, vital signs, etc) as needed.  
6.4.2.1. Physical Examinations (Including Vital Signs)
A complete physical examination will include (as applicable) the examination of general 
appearance, skin, neck, eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, 
extremities, vascular and neurological (Section 6.4.2.8 ).  For other indicated areas, based on 
medical history and/or symptoms, examinations will be performed. 
Physical examination will be source documented only; however significant findings that were 
present prior to the signing of the ICF/IAF must be included in the Medical History page on the subject’s eCRF.  Clinically significant new findings  that begin or worsen after informed 
consent/assent must be recorded on the AE page of the subject’s eCRF.  
At screening, the Investigator or designee pe rforming the physical examinat ion will characterize 
the findings as either normal or abnormal in the source.  If abnormal, a description of the 
abnormality and clinical importance should be source documented.  Clinically significant 
changes from screening/baseline will be recorded in the AE section of the eCRF.
Vital signs assessment will include temperature, blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate. 
On-treatment vital sign measuremen ts will be source documented only; however, if an abnormal 
(out of range) value is reported at any given visit and clinically significant, that parameter should be collected in the eCRF at every subsequent sc heduled visit until it returns to normal or not 
clinically significant (NCS), and recorded as an AE if appropriate.

Confidential and Propri etary 57 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 20176.4.2.2. Height 
Height in centimeters (cm) without shoes will be measured. For each height assessment, 
measurements should be performed three times a nd the average taken for calculation of BSA. 
6.4.2.3. Weight
Body weight (to the nearest 0.1 kilogram [kg] in indoor clothing, but without shoes) will be 
measured.  For each weight assessment, measurements should be performed three times and theaverage taken for calculation of BSA.
6.4.2.4. Body Surface Area Calculation
Body surface area, in m
2, will be calculated using the following formula, where weight (W) is in 
kg and height (H) is in cm ( Dubois, 1916 ):
BSA= (W0.425x H0.725) x 0.007184
The subject’s pomalidomide dose should be calculated on the first day of Cycle 1 based upon the 
subject’s current BSA.  Measurements of the subject’s height and body weight will be repeated 
on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle and BSA recalculated at these visits.  
6.4.2.5. Lansky/Karnofsky Performance Status
For subjects < 16 years of age, the Lansky performance status will be determined.  For subjects 
≥16 years of age, the Karnofsky performance status will be determined ( Appendix D ).  Each 
subject must continue to be assessed with the same performance status scale used at screening 
throughout his/her duration in the study (regardless of changing age over time).
6.4.2.6. Laboratory Evaluations
Screening and other laboratory assessments w ill be performed locally at each scheduled visit 
according to Table of Events ( Table 4 ) and collection plan in Table 5 below.
Note: Additional assessments should be performed between visits as clinically required to follow 
AEs or determine dose modifications.  All laboratory assessments should be performed prior to 
treatment administration on that particular visit unless indicated otherwise.
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain and review laboratory results for subject 
safety, and follow up with subjects in a timely manner.  The Investigator will evaluate the 
clinical significance of each applicable laboratory value outside of the reference range.  This 
decision shall be based upon the nature and degree of the observed abnormality.  Values which are considered clinically significant and/or related to study treatment will be noted in source 
document(s). The Investigator may choose to re peat any abnormal result, in order to rule out 
laboratory error.  “N ot clinically significant” or “NCS” will be recorded on the original 
laboratory sheet for all laboratory values which are outside the reference range, but are judged 
“not clinically significant.”  The Investigator making these assessments shall date and initial each 
form.
Hematology, serum chemistry and viral serology  laboratory values will not be collected on the 
laboratory eCRF; instead, laboratory abnormalities that are considered AEs should be reported 
on the AE eCRF (see Section 10).

6.4.2.7. Pulse Oximetry (Oxygen Saturation)
Oxygen (O 2) saturation will be measured by pulse oximetry at screening and repeated as 
clinically indicated throughout the study.  
6.4.2.8. Neurological Assessment
A basic neurolog ical exam (incl uding, but not limited to, cranial nerve examination, motor 
function, sensory function, reflexes and cerebellar function) will be conducted as part of the 
physical examination.
6.4.2.9. Pregnancy Testing and Pregnancy Risk Counseling
Medically supervised (ie, performed in a clinic) serum or urine pregnancy tests with a sensitivity 
of at least 25 mIU/mL must be conducted in FCCBP/FCBP, including those who commit to complete abstinence. Female children of childbearing potential is defined as a female who has 
achieved menarche and/or breast development in Tanner Stage 2 or greater and has not 
undergone a hysterectomy (the surgical remova l of the uterus) or bilateral oophorectomy (the 
surgical removal of both ovaries). 
A female of childbearing potential is defined as  a female w ho has achieved menarche at some 
point, not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy and has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the 
preceding 24 consecutive months). 
For all applicable subjects during the Screening Period, 2 pregnancy tests (with sensitivity of at 
least 25 mIU/mL) must be conducted prior to star ting treatment. The first pregnancy test in both 
FCCBP and FCBP must be performed within 10 to 14 days prior to the start of treatment 
(Screening Period) and the second pregnancy test must be performed within 24 hours prior to the start of treatment (Cycle 1, Day 1).  Amenorrhea fo llowing cancer therapy does not rule out 
childbearing potential. 
Note: The pregnancy test 10 to 14 days prior to initiation of pomalidomide may be omitted, at 
the discretion of the investigator, for any FCCBP/FCBP who has high acuity disease requiring 
immediate treatment with pomalidomide. The pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to the first 
dose of pomalidomide is required to be performed.

Protocol CC-4047-BRN-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 59 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 2017Female children of childbearing potential and FCBP with regular or no menstrual cycles must 
agree to have subsequent pregnancy tests weekly for the first 28 days of study participation and
then every 28 days while on study, at End of  Treatment Visit and at day 28 following treatment 
discontinuation.  If menstrual cycles are irregu lar, the pregnancy testing must occur weekly for 
the first 28 days and then every 14 days while  on study, at study End of Treatment Visit, and at 
Days 14 and 28 following treatment discontinuation.   It is the responsibility of the Investigator 
to obtain and review pregnancy test results for subject safety, and follow up with subjects in a timely manner.
The subject must not receive pomalidomide until the Investigator has verified that the results of 
the pregnancy test performed are negative. See inclusion criteria (Section 4.2) for pregnancy 
testing requirements.
The Investigator must confirm the FCCBP/FCBP subject is continuing to use 2 reliable methods 
of birth control if not committing to complete abstinence or plans not to commit to complete 
abstinence. Counseling about pregnancy precautions and the potential risks of fetal exposure to 
pomalidomide must be conducted at screening, on Day 1 (within 24 hours prior to treatment) of 
each cycle prior to pomalidomide di spensing or at a minimum of every 28 days (can also be 
conducted verbally from the site), at the End of Treatment Visit, and at the 28-day post-treatment
Safety Follow-up Visit.  If pregnancy or a posit ive pregnancy test does occur in a study subject, 
treatment must be immediately discontinued.  Pregnancy testing and counseling must be 
performed if a subject misses her period or if her pregnancy test or her menstrual bleeding is 
abnormal. Treatment must be disc ontinued during this evaluation as well.  Female children and 
adult females must agree to abs tain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at least 
28 days after treatment discontinuation.  If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in 
the partner of a male study subject during study participation, the Investigator must be notified 
immediately.
Furthermore, FCCBP/FCBP and male subjects that have reached puberty must agree to undergo 
physician-approved reproductive education and discuss the side effects of pomalidomide on 
reproduction with parent(s) and/or guardian(s) w hen appropriate.  Pregnancy testing is not 
required for non-FCCBP subjects, unless deemed necessary by the Investigator.
Any pregnancy occurring in either a female s ubject or partner of a male subject while in the 
Treatment Period, or within 28 days thereafter, are considered immediately reportable events (see Section 10.4).  
6.4.2.10. Assessment of Second Primary Malignancy
Second primary malignancies will be monitored as events of interest and must be reported as 
SAEs.  This includes any SPM, regardless of cau sal relationship to treatment, occurring at any 
time for the duration of the study, for at least 5 years from enrollment of the last subject, unless 
consent/assent is withdrawn, the subject is lost to follow-up, or death.  Subjects that do not receive treatment (eg, screen failures) will not be followed for SPM.
Events of SPM are to be reported using the SAE  report form and must be considered an 
“Important Medical Event” if no other serious criteria apply; these events must also be documented in the appropriate page(s) of the eCRF (ie, AE and SPM eCRF) and subject’s source

reporting as a SAE (eg, any confi rmatory histology or cytology re sults, X-rays, CT scans, etc).
6.5. Pharmacokinetics – Optional 
Sparse whole blood samples for PK analysis will be collected from consenting subjects at the 
time points specified in Table 6.  Blood samples MUST be drawn from the arm contra lateral to 
the arm with the intravenous i nfusion of concomitant medications  (if applicable).  For each PK 
sample, draw approximately 1 mL blood and prepare  plasma by centrifugation at 4°C.  The dose 
of pomalidomide (Cycle 1: Day 8 and 15) should be administered to subjects in the morning after the collection of the pre-dose PK blood samples.  To reduce PK variability on PK sampling days, 
subjects will be asked not to eat for 2 hours prior and 2 hours after pomalidomide administration.  
Specific details regarding the collection, processing, storage, and shipment of PK samples are provided in Appendix E .
Note: Blood samples for PK analysis can be ob tained through a central line, if applicable. The 
use of the central line to collect PK samples and any concomitant medications given via the central line prior to sampling must be captured in the appropriate section of the subject’s eCRF
and source documents.

Protocol CC-4047-BRN-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 61 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 20177. DESCRIPTION OF STUDY TREATMENTS
7.1. Description of Investigational Product
Investigational product will be provided as capsule formulation and oral suspension. 
Pomalidomide oral capsules for this clinical st udy will be supplied by Celgene Corporation in 
0.5 mg gelatin capsules (size 4 reddish brown), 1 mg hard gelatin capsules (size 4 reddish brown)
and 2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg hard gelatin capsules (size 2 reddish brown) labeled appropriately as IP for this study. Each bottle contains 21 capsules with each capsule containing pomalidomide 
as the active ingredient and the following inactive ingredients: mannitol, pre-gelatinized starch 
and sodium stearyl fumarate.  The capsules are supplied in tamper-evident, child-resistant, 
opaque, high density polyethylene (HDPE bottles) with polypropylene caps.  
Celgene Corporation will also suppl y pomalidomide active pharmaceut ical i ngredient in 
individually sealed vials for constitution to an oral suspension. Each vial contains 20 mg of pomalidomide, mannitol, pre-gelatin ized starch and sodium stearyl fumarate. The pomalidomide 
powder in each vial is constituted with 4 ml of water and 5 ml of suspending agent to create a 
pomalidomide oral suspension with a final volume of 10 mL and a concentration of 2mg/ml. This suspension is intended for oral administration only.
Please refer to the pomalidomide study drug label for more details on preparation, storage 
conditions, approved indications, known precautions, warnings and adverse reactions. Additional information may be included on the label as needed or applicable.  Label(s) for study drug w ill 
contain information as required per local health authority.  The pomalidomide dispensing, 
administration, dosing schedule and dose adjustments to be followed for this study are described in Section 7.2.
7.2. Treatment Administration and Schedule
The starting dose of pomalidomide will be 2.6 mg/m2/day, based on the subject’s actual BSA 
calculated at the beginning of each cycle.  Po malidomide (oral capsu les or suspension) w ill be 
administered daily for the first 21 days of every 28-day cycle and only enough pomalidomide for 
1 cycle (21-day supply) of treatment will be dispensed on Day 1 of each new cycle of therapy.The oral suspension is available for use in subjects who are unable to swallow the capsules or at 
the discretion of the Investigator.  On Day 1 of each cycle, pomalidomide will be dispensed and 
administered after completion of all clinical procedures required for that day.  Subsequent pomalidomide administration (ie, Days 2-21 of each cycle) may occur at the subject’s home.
Pomalidomide will not be administered on Days 22 through 28 of the 28-Day treatment cycle
even if a subject experiences a toxicity that requires dose interruption (see Section 7.2.2 ).  
Counting of days should continue uninterrupted and the rest period (Days 22 to 28) should be 
continued as planned.  For example, if a subject  experiences a toxicity  that requires interruption 
and does not recover until Day 22, pomalidomide s hould be restarted  on Day 1 of the subsequent 
cycle if other protocol parameters are met. Subjects will continue treatment for up to 24 cycles or 
until documented PD, withdrawal of consent/assent, treatment becomes intolerable or death, 
whichever comes first.
For subjects receiving capsules, the pomalidomide dose should be calculated and rounded up or 
down to the nearest 0.5 mg as the prescribed dose before each new dosing cycle.  The dose

achieve the prescribed dose. However, if a subject is unable to swallow larger capsules, varying 
appropriate strength combinations may be considered during medication assignment.  
Pomalidomide capsules should not be broken, chewed or opened and should be taken at 
approximately the same time every day for 21 consecutive days in a cycle. If a dose is vomited 
within 15 minutes of taking the dose and the capsule(s) are visible in the emesis, the dose should 
be repeated and the Investigator should be no tified to have replacement capsule(s) provided. If 
vomiting occurs beyond 15 minutes of dosing, do not repeat the dose and that day’s dose should 
be skipped.  Any vomiting of the capsules should be described in the subject dosing diary.
For subjects receiving the oral suspension of pomalidomide, the dose administered should 
correspond with a volume that is a 0.1 mL incremen t.  The oral suspension should be taken at 
approximately the same time every day for 21 consecutive days in a cycle. If the dose is 
vomited, the dose should not be repeated for that dosing day and details entered in the subject dosing diary. If a subject is receiving the pomalidomide oral suspension, a home healthcare 
company can be available to assist with the preparation and administration of the oral suspension 
at the subject’s home. The home trial support agent that may visit the subject’s home would be a licensed nurse.  Refer to the Pomalyst Oral Su spension Preparation Administration and Handling 
Guide for additional guidance. 
Pomalidomide (capsules or oral suspension) can be taken with or without food or beverage; 
however, to reduce PK variability on PK sampli ng days in Cycle 1 (Days 8 and 15), consenting 
subjects should not eat for 2 hours prior and 2 hours after pomalidomide administration. A 
pomalidomide dosing table is provided in Appendix F to facilitate dosing calculation for both 
capsules and oral suspension. If a dose is forgotten but remembered within 8 hours, the missed 
dose should be taken/given immediately.  If more than 8 hours have passed since the time the 
dose was due, that day’s dose should be skipped.
Treatment administration will be accurately recorded including, but not limited to, date of 
administration, dose and any changes in dosage administration (eg, interruption or reduction in 
dosing due to an AE).
Females of childbearing potential should not handle or administer pomalidomide unless they are 
wearing gloves.  All subjects should not extensively handle the pomalidomide capsule
formulation or oral suspension and should maintain storage in the packaging until ingestion.  In 
investigational studies, pomalidomide will be dispensed through a qualified healthcare 
professional (including but not limited to, nurses, pharmacists and physicians).  These healthcare 
professionals w ill be trained by Celgene in requirements specific to counseling of subjects.  Once 
trained, these healthcare staff will counsel sub jects prior to pomalidomide being dispensed to 
ensure that the subject has complied with all requirements (including use of birth control and 
pregnancy testing) and that the subject understands th e risks associated with pomalidomide.  This 
step will be documented with a completed Education and Counseling Guidance Document and 
no pomalidomide will be dispensed until this step occurs. Counseling includes verification with 
the subject that required pregnancy testing was performed and results were negative. 
A Pomalidomide Information Sheet will be supplied each time pomalidomide is dispensed.

Confidential and Propri etary 63 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 20177.2.1. Criteria for Starting Subsequent Treatment Cycles
Prior to the start (within 48 hours) of each tr eatment Cycle (Day 1) the following parameters
MUST be met:
!ANC ≥ 1,000/mm3
!Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3(transfusion independent, defined as no platelet 
transfusion within 7 days and recovery from nadir)
!Does not meet PD or treatment interruption/discontinuation criteria
In addition, subjects MUST meet the following within 24 hours prior to the start of each 
treatment cycle: 
∀Confirmation of negative serum or urine pregnancy test (sensitivity of at least 25 
mIU/mL) in FCCBP/FCBP.
∀Confirmation of the use of 2 forms of effective birth control for FCCBP/FCBP
and sexually mature males or confi rmation of commitment to complete 
abstinence.
∀Completion and documentation of required pomalidomide education and 
counseling.
If a subject does not meet the above parameters by Day 28 of a treatment cycle, then the 
subsequent cycle s hould not be s tarted until these parameters are met.  Refer to Section 7.2.2 for 
dose interruptions/reductions or next cycle delays due to count recovery or non-hematological toxicities.
7.2.2. Dose Reductions, Interruptions and Discontinuation Criteria for Toxicities
Hematological and non-hematological toxicity will be graded using CTCAE version 4.03.  In all 
cases, the reason for dose modification/interruption/discontinuation must be recorded in the 
subject’s medical record.  If the subject disconti nues the protocol-prescribed therapy due to an 
AE, this event must be reported in accordan ce with the procedures outlined in Section 10.
Subjects who experience significant toxicity as listed below ( Table 8 ) will have pomalidomide 
interrupted or reduced as specified in Table 7 .  Up to two dose reductions of pomalidomide are 
allowed across the Treatment Period in the event of specific protocol defined toxicity with no evidence of disease progression.  
In addition: 
!If a subject experiences a toxicity that re quires interruption and does not recover until 
Day 22, pomalidomide (dose-reduced) should be restarted on Day 1 of the subsequent
cycle if other protocol parameters are met. 
!The dose will not be re-e scalated following a dose reduction, even if there is minimal 
or no toxicity with the subsequent reduction in dose. 
!Subjects who again experience dose modifying toxicity after 2 dose reductions will be 
taken off pomalidomide therapy.

Confidential and Propri etary 66 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 2017On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as anything more frequent than the 
protocol-required schedule or frequency.
Complete data about treatment administration, including any overdose, regardless of whether the 
overdose was accidental or intentional, should be reported in the eCRF.  See Section 10for the 
reporting of AEs associated with overdose.
7.3. Method of Treatment Assignment
Subjects will be enrolled (Section 6.1.5 ) into the study via IRT.  For detailed IRT screening and 
enrollment procedures, please refer to the IRT User Manual. Subjects will enroll and be assigned 
to one of 4 parallel strata based on the follo wing tumor types: high-grade glioma, 
medulloblastoma, ependymoma and DIPG.  
7.3.1. Subject Numbering
All subjects will be screened and subsequently enrolled into the study using IRT.  The 
Investigator or designated site staff will be assigned password protected, coded identif ication 
numbers that give them authorization to log into IRT.  At screening, the Investigator or 
designated staff will log into the IRT and provide the requested identifying information for the 
subject.  IRT will then confirm the assignment of a 2-part unique subject ID number consisting of 7 digits. The first part is a 3-digit site numb er and the second part is a 4-digit number (always 
starting with “1” for the initial screening) assigned sequentially to sub jects at that site 
(eg, 101-1001, 101-1002, etc).  If the subject is not eligible for enrollment into the study, the site is required to register the subject as a screen f ailure in IRT.  Subjects who fail screening may be 
rescreened at the Investigator’s discretion.  For subjects who are rescreened, a new ICF/IAF will 
need to be signed and screening procedures will need to be repeated (if rescreening occurs > 28 days from original screening date).  A new Subject ID will be issued once the rescreening 
transaction is registered in IRT.  To identify subjects that rescreen, the 4-digit number identifier 
will start with “2” (eg, 101-2001) for 2
ndrescreen, “3” (eg, 101-3001) for third rescreen, etc. 
Once the subject is enrolled into the study, the subject will retain their Subject ID number which 
will be used to identify that specific subject during participation in the study.  
7.4. Packaging and Labeling
The label(s) for IP will include Sponsor na me, address and telephone number, the protocol 
number, IP name, dosage form and strength (where applicable), amount of IP per container, lot 
number, expiry date (where applicable), medication identification/kit number, dosing 
instructions, storage conditions, and required caution statements and/or re gulatory statements as 
applicable. Additional information may be included on the label as applicable per local 
regulations.
7.5. Investigational Product Accountability and Disposal 
Celgene (or designee) will review with the Inve stigator and relevant site personnel the process 
for IP return, disposal, and/or destruction including responsibilities for the site versus Celgene 
(or designee).

Protocol CC-4047-BRN-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 67 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 2017Study treatments must be received by designated personnel at the study site, handled and stored 
safely and properly, and kept in a secured location to which only the Investigator and designated 
site personnel have access. Upon receipt, the study treatment should be stored according to the 
instructions specified on the drug labels and/or in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
Accountability for all treatment administered during the course of the study is the responsibility 
of the Investigator (or designee).  The Investigator (or designee) is responsible for taking an 
inventory of each shipment pomalidomide received, and compar ing it with the accompanying 
accountability form. The Investigator (or designee) will verify the accuracy of the information on 
the form, sign and date it, retain a copy in th e study file, and return a copy to Celgene.
The investigational site must maintain accurate records demonstrating dates and amounts of 
treatment received, to whom it was administered (subject-by-subject accounting), and accounts 
of any pomalidomide accidentally or deliberately destroyed or returned.  Accurate recording of 
all treatment administration will be made in the appropriate section of the subject’s eCRF and source documents.  
All IP that is dispensed during the course of the study will be reconciled and accounted for by the 
Investigator (or designee). Applicable information such as lot number, dose information, date dispensed, numbers of capsules or oral suspen sion kit components dispensed/returned, date 
returned, etc. should be collected as well as information provided by the subject or the caregiver 
(eg, subject dosing diary).  Treatment accountability should be completed on Cycle 1 Day 1, at 
the end of every treatment cycle (Day 1 of subsequent cy cle) and at the end of treatment (EOT)
Visit.
Unless otherwise notified, all pomalidomide both used and unused must be saved for study 
treatment accountability.
7.6. Investigational Product Compliance
Compliance for pomalidomide administrated during the course of the study is the responsibility 
of the Investigator or designee and accurate recording of all treatment will be captured in the appropriate section of the subject’s eCRF and source document.  Compliance will be defined as 
taking between 75% and 110% of the intended quantity of study treatment.
Compliance of the IP will be based on what drug is returned and/or written in the subject dosing
diary.

Confidential and Propri etary 68 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 20178. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS AND PROCEDURES
Over the course of this study, additional medications may be required to manage aspects of the 
disease state of the subjects, including side effects from study treatments or disease progression. 
Supportive care, including but not limited to anti -emetic medications , may be administered at the 
discretion of the Investigator. 
All concomitant treatments, including blood and blood products, used from 28 days prior to first 
dose of study drug, except for those taken for the subject’s dis ease, must be reported on the 
eCRF.  Medications and procedures associated with the disease under study prior to screening will be captured under “Prior disease therapies.” Concomitant treatments must be reported until 
the 28-day post-treatment Safety Follow-up Visit on the eCRF. 
For information regarding other drugs that may interact with treatment and affect its metabolism, 
pharmacokinetics, or excretion, please see the Investigator’s Brochure and/or local package 
insert and prescribing information.
8.1. Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures
All supportive care (eg, antibio tics, blood products, anti-emetics, fluids, electrolytes, etc.), with 
exception of prohibited concomitant medicines and procedures listed in Section 8.2,is permitted 
when necessary and clinically indicated. This includes but not limited to:
8.1.1. Anti-emetics
Anti-emetics should not be administered prophylactically prior to the first dose of pomalidomide.  
Subsequent use of anti-emetics should be give n as needed at th e Investigator’s discretion.  
8.1.2. Corticosteroids
Corticosteroid therapy should be used at the lowest dose consistent with good management for 
treatment of increased intracranial pressu re or physiologic replacement.  Physiologic 
replacement doses will be defined on this protocol as no more than 0.75 mg/m2/day of 
dexamethasone or equivalent of corticosteroids.  Doses higher than this will be considered 
therapeutic. 
Corticosteroids should notbe used as a first-line anti-emetic.  Subjects on steroids who require 
an increase in steroid dose for worsening neurologic symptoms should have a brain and/or spine 
MRI performed within 72 hours to rule out tumor progression. 
Note: Subjects who are receiving corticosteroids at screening must be on a stable or decreasing 
dose for at least 5 days prior to the screening/baseline MRI. 
8.1.3. Colony Stimulating Growth Factors
Routine use of growth factors (eg, filgrastim,  sargramostim) in clinically well subjects awaiting 
count recovery is not recommended. Therapeutic use of growth factors in subjects with serious neutropenic conditions (eg, ANC < 500/mm
3), such as sepsis, may be considered at the 
Investigator’s discretion.

Confidential and Propri etary 69 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 20178.1.4. Anticonvulsants
Subjects on anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) may continue taking these medications as clinically 
indicated.  Due to the unknown effects of pomalidomide on the metabolism of AEDs, it is 
recommended that anticonvulsant levels be followed closely while on this study.
8.1.5. Neurosurgical or Other Surgical Procedure
If a neurosurgical procedure or other surgical procedure is required for a reason other than tumor 
progression (ie, the onset of hydrocephalus), these procedures should be documented, but will 
not constitute criteria for declaring the subject “off therapy.”  Pomalido mide should be held until 
the subject is clinically stable and has recovered from the acute effects of surgery.  Holding and 
restarting pomalidomide for these neurosurgical interventions should be discussed with the 
Sponsor and Principal Investigator when possibl e, and documented in the eCRF and source 
documents.
8.1.6. Alternative Supplements
Subjects on alternative supplements should strongly be encouraged to discontinue them prior to 
first dosing of treatment.  If subjects opt to conti nue, they may be enrolled into the study as long 
as they have been receiving the supplement for at least 30 days, with no evidence of hepatic, 
renal or other organ dysfunction, and the administration is approved by the Investigator.
8.1.7. Antibiotics Associated with Febrile Neutropenia
Febrile neutropenia should be managed according to the local institutional guidelines; however,
pomalidomide dosing should be modified as described in Table 8.
8.2. Prohibited Concomitant Medications and Procedures
Subjects must be instructed not to take any additional medications (over-the-counter, herbal or 
other products) during the study without prior consul tation with the Investigat or.  Concurrent 
cancer therapy, including investigational, ch emotherapy, immunotherapy, live vaccines (with 
exception to nasal influenza vaccine) or biologic therapy may NOT be administered to subjects 
while on this study.  The use of alternative or co mplementary therapies is also discouraged, but if 
given, should be recorded in the database.  
8.2.1. Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy is not permitted.
8.2.2. Deep Venous Thrombosis Prophylaxis
The use of medication for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis is not allowed for this study.  In the 
event of non-central line related thrombosis, pomalidomide will be discontinued permanently 
and not restarted.
Drugs known to be pro-thrombotic (ie, eryth ropoietic stimu lating agents) should be avoided.

The use of anticoagulation medications is not permitted, with the exception of tPA (ie, 
Alteplase), which may be used to dissolve central-line related thrombosis.
8.2.4. Moderate to Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors
Co-administration with moderate to strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (eg, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, 
fluvoxamine, etc) are not permitted due to the potential drug interactions with pomalidomide.  Subjects taking a known moderate to strong CYP1A2 inhibitor are excluded from this study. 
Pomalidomide is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 and CYP3A. Pomalidomide is also a 
substrate for P-glycoprotein. Therefore, use of CYP1A2 inhibitors may increase pomalidomide exposure.  The treating Investigator should consult a current drug information reference for a 
complete list (http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main-table/).  
Note: As an exception, subjects can be administered propofol (an inhibitor of CYP1A2) for 
sedation procedures such as a MRI.

9.1. Overview
This study consists of 4 independent strata for each  of a distinct disease indication (high-grade 
glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma and DIPG ).  Each stratum will enroll up to 20 subjects 
in total that are eligible for analysis of the primary endpoint, ie, a maximum of 80 subjects across 
the 4 strata assuming no subjects are replaced.  A Simon’s Optimal two-stage study design will be applied to each stratum.  All baseline and efficacy based endpoints (ORR, long-term SD rate, 
DoR, OS, and PFS) will be presented by stratum; safety data shall be presented by stratum and in 
aggregate. A DMC will be used to monitor the study conduct.  
9.2. Study Population Definitions
Informed Consent/Assent Population
The Informed Consent/Assent Population will consist of all subjects with signed informed 
consent/assent provided. The Informed Consent/Assent Population will be used for describing 
the disposition of subjects with signed informed consent/assent.
Response Population
The Response Populatio n will consist of all subjects enrolled, receiving at least 1 cycle of 
pomalidomide, if not discontinued therapy earlier due to PD. Subjects who withdraw from the 
Treatment Period for any reason other than PD prior to completing Cycle 1 of study treatment will be replaced. Subjects completing at least one cycle of study therapy but not having at least 
one post-baseline disease assessment will be considered a non-responder. The Response 
Population shall be used for analysis of the primary endpoint.
Intent-to-Treat Population
The Intent to Treat (ITT) Population will consis t of all subjects enrolled regardless of whether 
the subject received the assigned study treatme nt or not. The ITT population will be used for 
analysis of efficacy endpoints.  This analysis popula tion will only be used if  there is at least one 
subject that enrolled into the study but did not receive study medication.
Safety Population
The Safety Population will consist of all subjects who received at least one dose of 
pomalidomide. The sa fety population w ill be applied for the analysis of all safety and efficacy 
endpoints.
Pharmacokinetic Population 
The PK Population will include all subjects wh o received at least one dose of pomalidomide and 
have at least one measurable pomalidomide plasma c oncentration. The evaluable subjects in the 
PK population will be included in the PK data analysis.  
9.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations

Population) are required per stratum; 9 per stratum in Stage 1 and an additional 11 per stratum in 
Stage 2.  
Enrollment will proceed as follows:
1. Stage 1: Nine subjects will be enrolled into each of the strata.
2. Stage 2: If during Stage 1, ≥ 2 subjects in a given stratum achieve either an OR (either 
CR or PR) within the first 6 cycles of treatment (within 3 cycles for DIPG) or a long-term 
SD, an additional 11 subjects shall be enrolled to that stratum; otherwise no additional 
subjects will be enrolled.
3. If a total of 5 or more subjects across all 20 subjects in a given stratum (Stage 1 and 2) 
evaluable for the primary endpoint are observed as having either an OR (either CR or PR)
within the first 6 cycles of treatment (within 3 cycles for DIPG) or long-term SD, 
pomalidomide will be considered effective in that disease indication.
Up to 80 subjects (36 subjects in Stage 1 and 44 subjects in Stage 2) will be included should all 
strata enroll the maximum number of subjects (ie, 20 per stratum), assuming no subjects are 
replaced.  
9.4. Background and Demographic Characteristics
Subjects’ age, height, weight, and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics, while gender, race, and other categorical variables will be provided using frequency 
tabulations.  Medical history data will be summarized using frequency tabulations by system organ class and preferred term. 
9.5. Subject Disposition
Subject disposition (analysis population allocat ion, entered, discontinued, along with primary 
reason for discontinuation) will be summarized using frequency and percent for the Screening Period, Treatment Period and Follow-up Period.  A summary of subjects enrolled by site will be 
provided.  Protocol deviations and violations  will be summarized using frequency tabulations. 
9.6. Efficacy Analysis
Objective Response and Long-term Stable Disease Rate
Objective response and long-term SD rate (ORSD R), is defined as the total number of subjects 
achieving either an OR (either CR or PR) within th e first 6 cycles of treatment (within 3 cycles 
for DIPG) or a long-term SD (SD maintained for ≥ 6 cycles [> 3 cycles for DIPG]), over the total 
number of subjects evaluable for analysis. Evaluable is defined as a subject completing at least 
one cycle of study therapy or discontinuing treatment earlier due to a PD.  Subjects completing at least one cycle of study therapy but not having at least one subsequent (post-baseline) disease 
assessment will be considered a non-responder. The corresponding Clopper Pearson 95% 
confidence interval (CI) shall be calculated for each rate per stratum. Each stratum will be analyzed separately.  Analysis of this endpoint will be based on the Response Population, with 
secondary analyses based on the ITT P opulation and/or Sa fety Population.

Protocol CC-4047-BRN-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 73 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 2017Objective Response Rate
The ORR is defined as the total number of subjects achieving an OR (either CR or PR), over the 
total number of subjects evaluable for the analysis.  Disease responses occurring after start of a 
new anticancer therapy shall not be considere d. Each stratum w ill be analyzed separately.
Analysis of this endpoint will be based on the ITT Population and/or Safety Population.
Long-term Stable Disease Rate
The long-term SD rate is the proportion of subjects  achieving long-term SD, defined as a SD 
maintained for ≥ 6 cycles ( ≥ 3 cycles for DIPG), over the total number of subjects evaluable for 
the analysis.  The corresponding Clopper Pear son 95% CI shall be calculated for each rate per 
stratum.  Each stratum shall be analyzed separ ately.  Analysis of this endpoint will be based on 
the ITT Population and/or Safety Population.
Duration of Response
Duration of response is defined as the time from first observed response (either CR or PR, 
whichever comes first) until either disease progression, or death. Only s ubjects observed with a 
response shall be included in the analysis of DoR.  The median DoR time and the proportion of 
subjects remaining with a response at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months, and at close of study along with the corresponding 95% CI will be calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods.  Subjects who 
are alive and remain in disease response at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of 
their last adequate disease assessment or at the time of starting a new anticancer therapy, whichever is first. Due to the low number of s ubjects to be included in the analysis, additional 
summary statistics will be presented.  Each stratum s hall be analyzed separately.  Analysis of this 
endpoint will be based on the ITT Population and/or Safety P opulation.
Progression-Free Survival
Progression-free survival is defined as th e time from enrollment until either dis ease progression, 
or death of any cause, whichever occurs first.  The median PFS time and proportion of subjects remaining progression-free at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months, and at close of study along with the 
corresponding 95% CI calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods will be presented.  Subjects 
remaining progression-free at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of their last adequate disease assessment. Additionally, subjects will be censored at the time of starting a 
new anticancer therapy if having not had disease progression previously.  Due to the low number 
of subjects to be included in the analysis, additional summary statistics will be presented.  Each stratum shall be analyzed separately.  Analysis of this endpoint will be based on the ITT 
Population and/or Safety Population.
Overall Survival
Overall survival is defined as the time from enrollment until death of any cause.  The median OS 
time and proportion of subjects remaining alive at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months, and at close of 
study, along with the corresponding 95% CI, calcu lated using Kaplan-Meier methods will be 
presented.  Subjects remaining alive at the time of analysis will be censored at the time they were 
last known to be alive.  Due to the low number of subjects to be included in the analysis, 
additional summary statisti cs will be presented. Each stratum shall be analyzed separately.  
Analysis of this endpoint will be based on the ITT Population and/or Safety Population.

Confidential and Propri etary 74 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 20179.7. Safety Analysis
Toxicity Assessment
Toxicity, including SPMs, will be monitored in real time during the course of the study.  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the proportion of subjects experiencing any 
Grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicities and infections.
Adverse Events 
Adverse Events will be coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) (latest version).  This study will  utilize the NCI CTCAE (version 4.03) for toxicity
grading and performance reporting.  All AE data sh all be presented by di sease stratum and in 
aggregate, based on the Safe ty Population, ie, all sub jects receiving at least one dose of 
pomalidomide.
Treatment-emergent adverse events are defined as any AE occurring or worsening on or after the 
first dose of the study medication until the 28-day post-treatment Safety Follow-up Visit.  All 
TEAEs, AEs leading to study medication discontinuation, AEs leading to dose reduction/ interruption, AEs related to th e study treatmen t, SAEs, and AEs leading to death will be 
summarized by cycle and 28-day follow-up period after permanent treatment discontinuation as 
well as by subject (worse recorded grade) per event type (organ class and preferred term) and grade.  A summary of AEs with NCI CTCAE (version 4.03) Grade 3 or higher, as well as the 
most frequent preferred terms, will also be provided by grade and term.
Cross tabulations will be provided to summarize frequencies of abnormalities.  By-subject listings will be provided for all relevant safety data.  Graphical displays and figures 
will be provided where useful to assist in the interpretation of results.
Deaths
Deaths during the Treatment Period (defined as the time between enrollment until the 28-day 
post-treatment Safety Follow-up Visit) and during the Follow-up Period shall be summarized by 
frequency of occurrence and corresponding percentage by cause of death per study period (during treatment or follow-up) as well as overall. All death data shall be presented by disease 
stratum and in aggregate.
9.8. Interim Analysis
For each stratum, there is one interim analysis p lanned at the end of Stage 1. The interim analysis 
will be informal, performed internally by Celgene personnel with input, only if needed, from the 
DMC and steering committee (SC). Enrollment will be suspended for each interim analysis,
once the first 9 subjects evaluable for the primary endpoint have been enro lled.  E nrollment for 
each stratum will be re-opened/closed based upon the following criteria:
!Should only one or no subjects be  observed as having either an OR (either CR or PR) or a 
long-term SD, that stratum shall be closed to further enrollment.  
!Should at least 2 subjects across Stage 1 have either an OR (either CR or PR) or a long-
term SD, then that stratum will continue into Stage 2 to include up to 11 more additional 
subjects evaluable for the primary endpoint.

9.9.1. Pharmacokinetic Analysis
If warranted, populati on PK analysis (eg, CL/F and Vd/F) of pomalidomide plasma 
concentrations will be conducted, with possible pooling of data from other clinical studies with pomalidomide.  
9.9.2. Data Monitoring Committee
An external DMC with multidisciplinary represe ntation will be established to evaluate safety 
data periodically to monitor the overall benefit-to -risk of this protocol.  The DMC will be 
comprised of medical oncologists with experience in treating pediatric subjects with brain tumors
and a statistician, all of whom are not otherwise involved in the study conduct.  During the 
course of the study, the DMC will review the safety  data regularly as well as safety and efficacy 
data in accordance with the guidelines for the preplanned interim analyses (ie, end of Stage 1 and 
Stage 2).
The DMC will advise on serious safety considerations and any other issues important to the safe 
conduct of the study, and will make recommendations about the continuing safety of current 
participants and those yet to be enrolled.  The DMC will also provide recommendations about stopping the study, or continuing the study as pla nned, or with modifications for safety reasons, 
and may advise on ways to improve quality. 
Details regarding the operational aspects, structure, composition, roles and responsibilities of the 
DMC will be outlined in a DMC charter.
9.9.3. Steering Committee 
The SC will be established comprising of Investig ators participating in the study (ie, not being 
members of a DMC and Celgene representatives from the clinical study team).
The SC will ensure transparent management of the study according to the protocol through 
recommending and approving modifications as circumstances require. The SC will review 
protocol amendments as appropriate. Together with the clinical study team, the SC w ill also 
develop recommendations for publications of study results including authorship rules (if applicable). The details of the role of the SC are defined in a SC charter.

Confidential and Propri etary 76 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 201710. ADVERSE EVENTS
10.1. Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events
An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen 
in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening 
concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomi tant impairment of the subject’s health, including 
laboratory test values (as specifi ed by the criteria in Section 10.3), regardless of etiology. Any 
worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse ch ange in the frequency or intensity of a pre-
existing condition) should be cons idered an AE.  A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on 
the AE page of the eCRF rather than the indi vidual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or 
syndrome. 
Abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to the IP should be reported as an AE. Overdose, 
accidental or intentional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be reported on the overdose eCRF. (See Section 7.2.3 for the definition of overdose.) Any sequela of an accidental 
or intentional overdose of the IP should be reported as an AE on the AE eCRF. If the sequela of 
an overdose is an SAE, then the sequela must be reported on an SAE report form and on the AE eCRF. The overdose resulting in the SAE should be id entified as the cause of the event on the 
SAE report form and eCRF but should not be reported as an SAE itself.
In the event of overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive 
supportive measures as necessary. There is  no known specific antidote for pomalidomide
overdose. Actual treatment should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the 
judgment and experience of the treating physician.
All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study.  Assessments may include monitoring 
of any or all of the following parameters:  the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory, 
pathological, radiological or surgical findings , physical examination findings, or findings from 
other tests and/or procedures.
All AEs will be recorded by the Investigat or from the time the subject signs informed 
consent/assent until the 28-d ay post-treatment Safety Follow-up Visit as well as those SAEs 
made known to the Investigator at any time ther eafter while in Long-term Follow-up that are 
suspected of being related to study drug.  Adve rse events and SAEs will be recorded on the AE 
page of the eCRF and in the subject’s source documents.  All SAEs must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event by facsimile, or other 
appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  
10.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events
A qualified Investigator will evaluate all AEs as to: 
10.2.1. Seriousness 
An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that:
!Results in death;
!Is life-threatening (ie, in the opinion of the Investigator, the subject is at immediate 
risk of death from the AE);

Protocol CC-4047-BRN-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 77 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 2017!Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of ex isting hospitalization 
(hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay);
!Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions);
!Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;
!Constitutes an important medical event.
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death, hospitalization, or disability, but may jeopardize the subject or 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be considered serious.
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospitalizations for:
!a standard procedure for protocol therapy administration.  However, hospitalization or 
prolonge d hospitalization for a complication of therapy administration will be 
reported as an SAE. 
!routine treatment or monitoring of the st udied indication not associated with any 
deterioration in condition.
!the administration of blood or platelet transfusion as routine treatment of studied 
indication.  However, hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication 
of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE.
!a procedure for protocol/disease-related investig ations (eg, surgery, scans, endoscopy, 
sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow sampling).  However, hospitalization or 
prolonge d hospitalization for a complication of such procedures remains a reportable 
SAE.
!hospitalization or prolongation of hospi talization for techn ical, practical, or social 
reasons, in absence of an AE.
!a procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to start of treatment on study); must be 
documented in the source document a nd the eCRF.  Hospitalization or prolonged 
hospitalization for a complication remains a reportable SAE.
!an elective treatment of or an elective pro cedure for a pre-existing condition, 
unrelated to the studied indication, that has not worsened from baseline. 
!emergency outpatient treatment or observa tion that does not re sult in admission, 
unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the eCRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed.
For each SAE, the Investigator will provide information on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to the IP, action taken regarding the IP, and outcome.

Protocol CC-4047-BRN-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 78 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 201710.2.2. Severity/Intensity
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator must assess the severity/ intensity of the event. 
The severity/intensity of AEs will be graded based upon the subject’s symptoms according to the 
current active minor version of the CTCAE, Version 4.03); http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40
AEs that are not defined in the CTCAE should be evaluated for severity/intensity according to 
the following scale:
!Grade 1 = Mild – transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required
!Grade 2 = Moderate – mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may be 
needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required
!Grade 3 = Severe – marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; 
medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization is possible
!Grade 4 = Life-threatening – extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance 
required; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization or hospice care probable
!Grade 5 = Death - the event results in death
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  This criterion is notthe same as “serious” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or functioning.  
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a gui de for defining regulatory obligations.
10.2.3. Causality
The Investigator must determine the relationship between the administration of the IP and the 
occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: a causal relationship of the AE to the IP administration is 
unlikely or remote , or other medications, therapeutic 
interventions, or underlying c onditions provide a sufficient 
explanation for the observed event.
Suspected: there is a reasonable possibility that the administration of the 
IP caused the AE.  ‘Reasonable possibility’ means there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IP and the 
AE.
Causality s hould be a ssessed and provided for every AE/SAE based on currently available 
information.  Causality is to be reassessed and provided as additional information becomes 
available.

Protocol CC-4047-BRN-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 79 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 2017If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or additional IP 
that has not been manufactured or provided by Celgene, please provide the name of the 
manufacturer when reporting the event.
10.2.4. Duration
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the 
event.
10.2.5. Action Taken
The Investigator will report the action taken with the IP as a result of an AE or SAE, as 
applicable (eg, discontinuation, interruption, or dose reduction of the IP, as appropriate) and report if concomitant and/or additional tr eatments were given for the event. 
10.2.6. Outcome
The Investigator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs.
All SAEs that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study 
must be followed until recovered (returned to baseline), recovered with sequelae, or death (due to 
the SAE).
10.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the abnormality:
!results in discontinuation from the study;
!requires treatment, modification/ interruption of the IP dose, or any other therapeutic 
intervention; or
!is judged to be of significant clinical importance, eg, one that indicates a new disease 
process and/or organ toxicity, or is an exacerbation or worsening of an existing 
condition.
Regardless of severity grade, only laboratory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a SAE.
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF.  If the abnormality was not a part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the labor atory abnormality should be  recorded as the AE. 
If possible, the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as a medical term and not simply as an 
abnormal laboratory result (eg, record throm bocytopenia rather than decreased platelets).
10.4. Pregnancy
All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in either a FCBP/FCCBP or partner of 
childbearing potential of a male subject are immediately reportable events .  
The exposure of any pregnant female (eg, caregiver, pharmacist, study coordinator or monitor) to 
pomalidomide is also an immediately reportable event.

Confidential and Propri etary 80 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 201710.4.1. Females of Childbearing Potential:
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including elevated βhCG or positive pregnancy test in a 
FCBP/FCCBP regardless of disease state) occurring while the subject is on IP, or until the 28-day 
post-treatment Safety Follow-up Visit are considered immediately reportable events.  Investigational product is to be discontinued imme diately and the s ubject instructed to return any 
unused portion of the IP to the Investigator. The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive 
pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by email, phone or facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the Pregnancy Initial Report Form, or approved 
equivalent form.  
The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist, preferably one 
experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.
The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify Celgene Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow -up Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous abortion), the Investigator 
should report the abnormal outcome as an AE.  If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious 
criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safety by facsimile, or any other 
appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE 
Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported, without regard to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant d eath after 28 days that the Investigator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safety by facsimile, or other appropriate methods, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the 
event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
10.4.2. Male Subjects
If a female partner of a male subject taking IP becomes pregnant, the male subject taking IP 
should notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female partner should be advised to call her healthcare provider immediately.  
10.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF.  All SAEs must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event by facsimile, 
or other appropriate method (eg, via email), using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent 
form.  This instruction pertains to initial SAE reports as well as any follow-up reports.
Second primary malignancies will be monitored as events of interest and must be reported as 
SAEs. This includes any SPM, regardless of causa l relationship to treatment, occurring at any 
time for the duration of the study, for at least 5 years from enrollment of the last subject, unless consent/assent is withdrawn, the subject is lost to follow-up, or death. Subjects that do not 
receive treatment (eg, screen failures) will not be followed for SPM.  Events of SPM are to be 
reported using the SAE report form and must be considered an “Important Medical Event” even if no other serious criteria apply; these events must also be documented in the appropriate

Confidential and Propri etary 81 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 2017page(s) of the eCRF (ie, AE and SPM eCRF) a nd subject’s source docum ent(s). Documentation 
on the diagnosis of the SPM must be provided at the time of reporting as an SAE (eg, any 
confirmatory histology or cytology results, X-rays, CT scans, etc.).
The Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.  
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to the IP) that occur during the 
study (from the time the subject signs informed consent/assent until the 28-day post-treatment
Safety Follow-up Visit) or any SAE made known to the Investigator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being related to IP.  Serious adverse events occurring prior to treatment (after 
signing the ICF/IAF) will be captured.
The SAE report should provide a detailed description of the SAE and include a concise summary 
of hospital records and other relevant documents.  If a subject died and an autopsy has been 
performed, copies of the autopsy report and d eath certificate are to be sent to Celgene Drug 
Safety as soon as these become available.  Any follow-up data should be detailed in a subsequent SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form, and sent to Celgene Drug Safety.  
Where required by local legislation, the Investigator is responsible for informing the Institutional 
Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) of the SAE and providing them with all relevant initial and follow-up information about the event. The Investigator must keep copies of all SAE 
information on file including correspondence with Celgene and the IRB/EC.
10.5.1. Safety Queries
Queries pertaining to SAEs will be communicated from Celgene Drug Safety to the site via 
facsimile or electronic mail.  The response time is expected to be no more than five (5) business 
days.  Urgent queries (eg, missing causality assessment) may be handled by phone.
10.6. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events
For the purpose of regulatory reporting, Celgene Drug Safety will determine the expectedness of events suspected of being related to po malidomide based  on the Investigator Brochure.
In the United States, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be 
reported in an expedited manner in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32.
For countries within the European Economic Area (EEA), Celgene or its authorized 
representative will report in an expedited manner to Regulatory Authorities and ECs concerned, 
SUSARs in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC and the Detailed Guidance on collection, 
verification and presentation of adverse reaction reports arising from clinical trials on the IP for human use (ENTR/CT3) and also in accordance with country-specific requirements.  
Celgene or its authorized representative shall notify the Investigator of the following 
information:
!Any AE suspected of being related to the use of the IP in this study or in other studies 
that is both serious and unexpected (ie, SUSAR);
!Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for 
human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.

11.1. Treatment Discontinuation
The following events are considered sufficient reasons for discontinuing a subject from the IP(s):
!Adverse Event
!Withdrawal of consent/assent by subject/p arent(s)/legal guardian(s) - under this 
situation, the Investigator should clarify if the family also wishes to withdraw the study ICF/IAF for continued participation in the Long-term Follow-up Period and data collection
!Death
!Lost to follow-up
!Pregnancy
!Non-compliance with IP 
!Progressive disease
!Physician decision
!Protocol violation
!Completion of the Treatment Period (24 cycles)
!Study or site terminated by Sponsor
!Other (to be specified on the eCRF)
The reason for discontinuation of treatment, last dose of treatment and date subject taken off 
treatment should be recorded in the eCRF and in the source documents.
The decision to discontinue a subject from treatment remains the responsibility of the treating 
physician and will not be delayed or refused by the Sponsor.  However, prior to discontinuing a 
subject, the Investigator may contact the Medical Monitor and forward appropriate supporting 
documentation for review and discussion.
11.2. Study Discontinuation
The following events are considered sufficient reasons for discontinuing a subject from the study:
!Screen failure
!Withdrawal of consent/assent by subject/parent(s)/legal guardian(s) for any further 
data collection
!Death
!Lost to follow-up
!Completion of the Follow-up Period

Confidential and Propri etary 84 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 2017!Study or site terminated by Sponsor
!Other (to be specified on the eCRF)
The date and reason for study discontinuation should be recorded in the eCRF and in the source 
documents.
All subjects who are withdrawn from the study should complete all protocol-required evaluations 
scheduled for treatment discontinuation at the time of withdrawal.
Since the follow-up of subjects who discontinue prematurely is of particular importance, every 
attempt should be made to collect all survival i nformation and new anticancer treatment/therapy, 
unless the subject has specifically withdrawn consent/assent from further follow-up.  
Note: The Long-term Follow-up Period may not be terminated because  of new anticancer 
treatment.  
For subjects whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for study visits without stating an 
intention to withdraw consent/assent, the Investigator should show "due diligence" by contacting 
the subject, family or family physician as agreed in the informed consent/assent and by 
documenting in the source documents steps taken  to contact the subject, eg, dates of telephone 
calls, registered letters, etc. A subject should not be considered lost to follow-up until due 
diligence has been completed.  Subjects lost to follow-up should be recorded as such on the appropriate eCRF.

13.1. Good Clinical Practice
The procedures set out in this study protocol pertaining to the conduct, evaluation, and 
documentation of this study are designed to ens ure that Celgene, its authorized representative, 
and Investigator abide by GCP, as described in ICH Guideline E6 and in accordance with the 
general ethical principles outlined in the Declarati on of Helsinki. The study will receive approval 
from an IRB/EC prior to commencement. The Investigator will conduct all aspects of this study 
in accordance with applicable national, state, and local laws of the pertinent regulatory 
authorities.
13.2. Investigator Responsibilities
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and in the local regulations.  Celgene staff or an authorized representative will evaluate and approve all Investigators who in turn will select their staff.
The Investigator should ensure that all persons assi sting with the study are adequately informed 
about the protocol, amendments, study treatments, as well as study-related duties and functions, including obligations of confidentiality of Celgene information. The Investigator should maintain 
a list of Sub-investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom he or she has 
delegated significant study-related duties.
The Investigator is responsible for keeping a record of all subjects who sign an ICF/IAF and are 
screened for entry into the study.  Subjects who fail screening must have the reason(s) recorded 
in the subject’s source documents.
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to subject records (eg, 
medical records, office charts, hospital charts, and study-related charts) for source data verification.  The Investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of eCRFs and queries.
The information contained in the protocol and amendments (with the exception of the 
information provided by Celgene on public registry websites) is considered Celgene confidential 
information.  Only information that is previously disclosed by Celgene on a public registry 
website may be freely disclosed by the Investigator or its institution, or as outlined in the Clinical 
Trial Agreement.  Celgene protocol, amendment and Investigator’s Brochure information is not to be made publicly available (for example on the Investigator’s or their institution’s website) 
without express written approval from Celgene.  Information proposed for posting on the 
Investigator’s or their institution’s website must be submitted to Celgene for review and approval, providing at least 5 business days for review.
At the time results of this study are made available to the public, Celgene will provide 
Investigators with a summary of the results that is written for the lay person. The Investigator is 
responsible for sharing these results with the subject and/or their caregiver as agreed by the 
subject.

Protocol CC-4047-BRN-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 87 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 201713.3. Subject Information and Informed Consent/Assent
The Investigator must obtain informed consent/assent of a subject and/or a subject’s legal 
representative prior to any study related procedures.
Documentation that informed consent/assent occurre d prior to the study subject’s entry into the 
study and of the informed consent/assent process should be recorded in the study subject’s source documents including the date.  The original ICF/IAF signed and dated by the study 
subject and by the person consenting the study subj ect prior to the study subject’s entry into the 
study, must be maintained in the Investigator’s study  files and a copy given to the study subject.  
In addition, if a protocol is amended and it impacts on the content of the informed 
consent/assent, the ICF/IAF must be revised.  Study subjects participating in the study when the 
amended protocol is implemented must be re-conse nted/assented with the revised version of the 
ICF/IAF.  The revised ICF/IAF signed and dated by the study subject and by the person 
consenting the study subject must be maintained in the Investigator’s study files and a copy 
given to the study subject.
13.4. Confidentiality
Celgene affirms the subject's right to protection against invasion of privacy and to be in 
compliance with ICH and other local regulations (w hichever is most stringent). Celgene requires 
the Investigator to permit Celgene's representatives and, when necessary, representatives from regulatory authorities, to review  and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in 
accordance with local laws.
Should direct access to medical records require  a waiver or authorization separate from the 
subject’s signed ICF/IAF, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain such permission in 
writing from the appropriate i ndividual.
13.5. Protocol Amendments
Any amendment to this protocol must be approved by the Celgene Clinical Research 
Physician/Medical Monitor.  Amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC for written approval. 
Written approval must be obtained before implementation of the amended version occurs.  The written signed approval from the IRB/EC should specifically reference the Investigator name, 
protocol number, study title and amendment number(s) that is applicable. Amendments that are 
administrative in nature do not require IRB/EC approval but will be submitted to the IRB/EC for information purposes.
13.6. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Review 
and Approval
Before the start of the study, the study protoc ol, ICF, and any other appropriate documents will 
be submitted to the IRB/EC with a cover letter or a form listing the documents submitted, their dates of issue, and the site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable) for which approval is 
sought. If applicable, the documents will also be submitted to the authorities in accordance with 
local legal requirements.

Protocol CC-4047-BRN-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 88 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 2017The IP can only be supplied to an Investigator by Celgene or its authorized representative after 
documentation on all eth ical and legal requirements for starting the study has been received by 
Celgene or its authorized repre sentative. This documentation must also include a list of the 
members of the IRB/EC and their occupation and qualifications. If the IRB/EC will not disclose the names, occupations and qualifications of the committee members, it should be asked to issue 
a statement confirming that the composition of the committee is in accordance with GCP. For 
example, the IRB General Assurance Number may be accepted as a substitute for this list. Formal approval by the IRB/EC should mention the protocol title, number, amendment number 
(if applicable), study site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable), and any other 
documents reviewed. It must mention the date on which the decision was made and must be officially signed by a commi ttee membe r. Before the first subject is enrolled in the study, all 
ethical and legal requirements must be met.
The IRB/EC and, if applicable, the authorities, must be informed of all subsequent protocol 
amendments in accordance with local legal requirements. Amendments must be evaluated to 
determine whether formal approval must be sought and whether the ICF should also be revised.
The Investigator must keep a record of all co mmunication with the IRB /EC and, if applicable, 
between a Coordinating Investigator and the IRB /EC. This statement also applies to any 
communication between the Investigator (or Coordinating Investigator, if applicable) and 
regulatory authorities.
Any advertisements used to recruit subjects for the study must be reviewed by Celgene and the 
IRB/EC prior to use.  
13.7. Ongoing Information for Institutional Review Board/ Ethics 
Committee
If required by legislation or the IRB/EC, the Investigator must submit to the IRB/EC:
!Information on serious or unexpected AEs as soon as possible
!Periodic reports on the progress of the study
!Deviations from the protocol or anything that may involve added risk to subjects
13.8. Termination of the Study
Celgene reserves the right to terminate this st udy prematurely at any time for reasonable medical 
or administrative reasons. Any premature discontinuation will be appropriately documented according to local requirements (eg, IRB/EC, regulatory authorities, etc).
In the case where there are subjects still being administered the investigational product, and it is 
the opinion of the Investigator(s) that these subjects continue to receive benefit from treatment, the Sponsor may choose to initiate an open-label, extension study under a separate protocol to 
allow these subjects continued access to pomalidomide following their participation in this study 
(CC-4047-BRN-001).
In addition, the Investigator or Celgene has the right to discontinue a single site at any time 
during the study for medical or administrative reasons such as:

Confidential and Propri etary 92 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 201715. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
All aspects of the study will be carefully moni tored by Celgene or its authorized representative 
for compliance with applicable government regulations with respect to current GCP and SOPs.
15.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification
Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after the study.  All aspects of the study are reviewed with the Investigator and the staff at a study initiation visit and/or at an Investigators’ Meeting.  Prior to enrolling subjects into the study, a 
Celgene representative will review the prot ocol, eCRFs, procedures for obtaining informed 
consent/assent, record keeping, and reporting of AEs/SAEs with the Investigator.  Monitoring will include on-site visits with the Investigator and his/her staff as well as any appropriate 
communications by mail, email, facsimile, or telephone.  During monitoring visits, the facilities, 
IP storage area, eCRFs, subject’s source docu ments, and all other study  documentation will be 
inspected/reviewed by the Celgene representative in accordance with the Study Monitoring Plan.
Accuracy will be checked by performing source data verification that is a direct comparison of 
the entries made onto the eCRFs against the appropriate source documentation.  Any resulting discrepancies will be reviewed with the Investigator and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary 
corrections will be made directly to the eCRFs or via queries by the Investigator and/or his/her 
staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed consents/assents, adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria and documentation of SAEs and their proper recording be verified.  
Additional monitoring activities may be outlin ed in a study-specific monitoring plan.
15.2. Audits and Inspections
In addition to the routine monitoring procedure s, a Good Clinical Practice Quality Assurance 
unit exists within Celgene.  Representatives of this unit will conduct audits of clinical research 
activities in accordance with Celgene SOPs to evaluate compliance with Good Clinical Pract ice 
guidelines and regulations.
The Investigator is required to permit direct access to the facilities where the study took place, 
source documents, eCRFs and applicable supporting records of study subject participation for audits and inspections by IRB/ECs, regulatory  authorities (eg, FDA, European Medicines 
Agency [EMA], Health Canada) and company authorized representatives.  The Investigator 
should make every effort to be available for the audits and/or inspections.  If the Investigator is contacted by any regulatory authority regarding an inspection, he/she should contact Celgene 
immediately.

Target Lesions
For the purpose of this study, response criteria for target lesions are defined as follows: 
!Complete Response (CR): 
∀Complete disappearan ce on MRI of all measurable lesions.
!Partial Response (PR):
∀A reduction of ≥ 50% in tumor size by bi-dimensional measurement (taking as 
reference the baseline measurements) quantified by the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of measurable lesions.
!Stable Disease (SD):  
∀A decrease of < 50% or an increase of < 25% in the sum of the products of the 
perpendicular diameters of measurable lesions and no evidence of new lesions.  Response does not meet the criteria for CR, PR or PD.  
!Progressive Disease (PD) :
∀≥ 25% increase in the bi-dimensional measurement as quantified by the sum of 
the products of the largest diameters of the measurable lesions taking as a reference the smallest disease measurement recorded since the start of protocol therapy (nadir).
Non-target Lesions
For the purpose of this study, response criteria for non-target lesions are defined as follows:
!Complete Response (CR):
∀Disappearance of all non-target lesions.
∀If spine MRI and/or lumbar CSF cytology were previously positive, it must be 
negative at time of assessment.
!Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (IR/SD):  
∀The persistence of non-target lesions, stable (no progression) or decrease in size.
∀If spine MRI and/or lumbar CSF cytology were previously positive at baseline
and remains positive with no other evidence of PD.
!Progressive Disease (PD): 
∀The appearance of one or more new les ions and/or unequivocal progression of 
existing non-target lesions.
∀If spine MRI and/or lumbar CSF cytology were previously negative and became 
positive.

Confidential and Propri etary 103 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 2017Appendix C: Overall Response Assessment
The overall response assessment takes into account response in both target ( Appendix B ) and non-target lesions ( Appendix B ), the 
appearance of new lesions, current corticosteroid use (compare d to baseline) and neurologic symptoms/examination (clinical stat us)
according to the criteria below ( Table 10 ).  Subjects who do not meet the criteria for an objective response or disease progression by 
the end of Cycle 6 (end of Cycle 3 for DIPG subjects) will be considered as having long-term SD.

Requirement for Response All All All All Anye
CR = complete response; IR = incomplete response; PR = partial response; SD = stable disease; PD = progressive disease.
aOnly physiologic replacement doses allowed, defined as no more than 0.75 mg/m2/day of dexamethasone or equivalent.
bNot greater dose than compared with baseline.
cAn increase in corticosteroid dose alone will not cause a determination of progression in the absence of clinical deterioration  or radiographically documented 
lesion growth.
dNeurologic abnormalities or worsening neurologic status not explained by causes unrelated to tumor progression (eg, anticonvuls ant or corticosteroid toxicity 
wean, electrolyte disturbances, sepsis, hyperglycemia, etc.) or changes in corticosteroid dose.
eProgression occurs when any of these criteria are met present.

Confidential and Propri etary 105 CC-4047-BRN-001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 2017Appendix E: Plasma PK Sample Handling Instruction
Each participating institution w ill be provided with PK sample co llection kits al ong with a PK 
laboratory manual.
Preparation of Collection Tubes and Storage Vials
All labels will be provided by central laboratory.  The labels will contain the following 
information:
!Protocol No.: CC-4047-BRN-001
!Subject ID number: (To be added by site)
!Nominal Time (eg, 2 hours postdose)
!Sample Type (eg, Plasma Primary or Backup) 
All plasma collection tubes and storage v ials should be labeled and chilled on wet ice prior to
sample collection and processing.
Pomalidomide Plasma PK Sample Handling
1. Blood Sample Collection
!Fill an ice bucket with a sufficient amount of ice to pre-ch ill all collection tubes 
before blood draw.
!Collect approximately 1 mL of whole blood into a pre-chilled K2 EDTA tube.
!Accurately record the time of blood collection.
!Gently invert the tube 3 to 5 times and immerse it into ice bath immediately to 
prevent possible compound degradation at room temperature.
2. Blood Sample Processing to Obtain Plasma
!Within 30 minutes of collection , the blood sample must be centrifuged at 1,500 g 
(about 3,000 rpm) for 10 minutes at 4°C to obtain plasma.
!Transfer approximately 0.25 mL of plasma into  each of two pre- labeled, pre-chilled, 
polypropylene citric acid storage tubes (ie, primary and back up).

Summary of Changes CC-4047-BRN-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 3 CC-4047-BRN- 001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 20171. JUSTIFICATION FOR AMENDMENT
Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
!Clarified that only subjects with brain as the primary site of disease (primary brain 
tumors) will be allowed to participate
The inclusion criteria and the definition of measurable disease was updated to clarify that 
subjects must have brain tumor as a primary target lesion.  This was revised to exclude 
subjects with metastatic brain lesions, as this trial is only targeting subjects with primary 
brain tumors.
Revised sections: Section 4.2 Inclusion Crit eria, No. 6; Section 6.4.1.1 Selection of Target 
and Non-Target Lesions
!Updated language regarding the required screening pregnancy testing 
Amended language to state that the pregnancy test 10 to 14 days prior to initiation of 
pomalidomide may be omitted, at the discre tion of the investigator, for any females of 
childbearing potential (FCBP)/female children of childbearing potential (FCCBP) who have
high acuity disease requiring immediate treatment with pomalidomide. This change was made to accommodate any potential sub jects with high-risk disease, who may need
immediate treatment with pomalidomide. The pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to the first 
dose of pomalidomide is still required to be performed.
Revised sections: Section 4.2 Inclusion Criteria, No. 17; Section 5 Table of Events (Table 4); 
Section 6.1 Screening Period; 6.2 Treatment Pe riod; Section 6.4.2.9 Pregnancy Testing and 
Pregnancy Risk Counseling
!Clarified the use of anti-coagulation therapy 
Provided clarification that small clots in cen tral lines that are resolved with tissue 
plasminogen activator (tPA) flush will not be considered a central-line related thrombosis.  In 
addition, the use of tPA (eg, Alteplase) to flush subject’s central-line is allowed and would not be considered a prohib ited concomit ant medication. 
Revised sections: Section 4.3 Exclusion Criteria , Nos.1 and 3; Section 8.2.3 Anti-coagulation 
Medications
!Updated language regarding the collection of pharmacokinetic samples
Clarified that blood samples for pharmacokine tic (PK) analysis can be obtained through a 
central line, if applicable.  The use of the central line to collect PK samples and any 
concomitant medications given via the central line prior to sampling must be captured in the appropriate section of the subject’s electronic case re port form (eCRF) and source 
documents. In addition, removed the requirement that pomalidomide needs to be 
administered “at the study center” on Cycle 1, Day 8 and 15.

Confidential and Propri etary 4 CC-4047-BRN- 001 Amendment 3 Final: 20 Dec 2017!Extended the collection time window for the pre-dose PK sample
To avoid the potential for an additional bl ood draw on PK da ys, the collection window for 
the 0-hour (pre-dose) PK sample on Cycle 1, Da y 8 and Cycle 1, Day 15 was updated from   
-30 minutes to -90 minutes in order to allow the PK blood sample to be collected with the 
other labs that day (ie, hematology and chemistry labs).
Revised section: Section 6.5 Pharmacokinetic Sampling Time Points (Table 6)
!Added the Informed Consent/Assent Population
The Informed Consent/Assent P opulation was a dded to be consistent with the CC-4047-
BRN-001 Statist ical Analysis Plan.  The Informed Consent/Assent Population w ill consist of 
all sub jects with signed informed consent/assent provided and used for describing the 
disposition of subjects with signed informed consent/assent.
Revised section: Section 9.2 Study Population Definitions 
The amendment also includes other minor clarifications and corrections including: 
!Clarified that 2.6 mg/m2/day was the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), not the 
recommended Phase 2 dose, from the Phase 1 trial conducted by the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC-043).  (Protocol  Summary; Section 1.2.4; Section 1.3.3). 
!Updated the current approval status of pomalidomide (Section 1.2).

performed within 7 days prior to the completion of Cycle 24 (Section 3.1; Section 5 
Table of Events [Table 4]; Section 6.4.1).
!Clarified that prior immunomodulatory therapy refers to thalidomide and 
lenalidomide (Section 4.3).
!Corrected the word “Secondary” to “Second” as Second Primary Malignancy is the 
correct phrase to use (Section 3.1; Section 5 Table of Events [Table 4]).
!Defined FCBP = females of childbeari ng potential and FCCBP = female children of 
childbearing potential (Section 5 Table of Events [Table 4]).
!Clarified that it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain and review 
laboratory/pregnancy results for subject safety, and follow up with subjects in a timely manner (Section 5 Table of Events [Table 4], Section 6.4.2.6, Section 6.4.2.9).
!Removed “initials” from the demographic data to be co llected since init ials are not 
being captured in the study (Section 6.1.2).   
!Clarified that cerebrospinal fluid, positiv e or negative for tumor cells, will be 
followed as nonmeasurable disease (Section 6.4.1.1). 
!Corrected that a new informed consent/assent and screening procedures w ill need to 
be repeated if rescreening occurs > 28 day s (not 21 days) from original screening date
(Section 7.3.1).
!Clarified the safety population will be applied for the analysis of all safety and 
efficacy endpoints (Section 9.2).

Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
!Pharmacokinetic assessments made optional
Pharmacokinetics (PK) assessments are also included in the ongoing Phase 1 pomalidomide 
trial conducted under the Pediatr ic Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC- 043).  As the Phase 1 
trial remains open, additional subjects are planned to be enro lled and samples obtained to 
satisfy the PK requirements. Therefore, PK assessments in this Phase 2 study will not be 
mandatory.
Revised sections: Table 4, Table of Even ts; Section 6.2 Treatment Period; Section 6.5, 
Pharmacokinetics; Section 9.9.1, Pharmacokinetics Analysis
!Removed requirement to obtain spine MRIs without contrast
It has been recommended by the study Steer ing Committee to remove the requirement to 
obtain spine MRIs without contrast as it would not provide any additional benefit to the 
subject in evaluating response.  This further provides flexibility to sites to perform imaging 
assessments per institutional procedures.
Revised sections: Section 4.2, Inclusion Criteria #7; Table 4, Table of Events; Section 6.1, 
Screening Period; Section 6.2, Treatment Period; Section 6.2.1, End of Treatment; Section 
6.4.1, Efficacy Assessments
!Updated study visit window for brain and spine MRIs performed during Treatment 
Period
To provide site the flexibility when sche duling MRIs during the Treatment Period, brain and 
spine MRI assessments can be performed within 7 days prior to dosing on Day 1 of Cycles 3, 
5, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, and 22.  For DIPG subjects only, brain and spine MRI assessments can 
be performed within 7 days prior to dos ing on Day 1 of Cycles 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, and 22.
Revised sections: Section 3.1, Study De sign; Table 4, Table of Events; Section 6.4.1,

!Updated Exclusion Criteria #5 (prior therapy)
1. The time frame from the last dose of prior therapy for a subject to be excluded, was 
reduced from ≤ 28 days to ≤ 21 days prior to screening for subjects receiving prior 
myelosuppressive chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or any investigational agent.  This was 
updated to accommodate the targ et population(s) that have highly aggressive disease and 
may require more rapid intervention with pomalidomide.
2. Clarified that subjects cannot have received prior focal rad iation ≤ 6 weeks prior to 
screening for target lesions and ≤ 3 weeks prior to screening for non-target lesions 
identified at baseline.

!Screening Period extended to 28 days 
The Screening Period was increased from 21 to 28 days to accommodate the protocol
requirement for female subjects of child bearing potential to use 2 reliable forms of 
contraception (or abstinence) for at least 28 days before starting pomalidomide. 
Revised sections: Protocol Summary; Figure 2, Overall Study Design; Section 3.2, Study 
Duration for Subjects; Table 4, Table of Events; Section 6.1, Screening Period
!Provided guidance if pomalidomide dosing is vomited or forgotten
Additional guidance was included to clarify what to do if a dose of pomalidomide is vomited 
or forgotten. 
For subjects receiving capsules: 
!If a dose is vomited within 15 minutes of taking the dose and the capsule(s) are 
visible in the emesis, the dose should be repeated and the Investigator should be notified to have replacement capsule(s) provided.  If vomiting occurs beyond 15 
minutes of dosing, do not repeat the dose and that day’s dose should be skipped.  Any 
vomiting of the capsules should be described in the subject dosing diary.
For subjects receiving the oral suspension:
!If the dose is vomited, the dose should not be repeated for that dosing day and details 
entered in the subject dosing diary.  
If a dose (capsules or oral suspension) is fo rgotten but remembered  within 8 hours, the 
missed dose should be taken/given immediately.  If more than 8 hours have passed since the 
time the dose was due, that day’s dose should be skipped.
Revised sections: Section 7.2, Treatment Administration and Schedule
!Revised dose modification criteria
3. Clarified febrile neutropenia must be Grade 3 or 4.
4. Clarified in Table 8 that study drug should be permanently discontinued for subjects 
experiencing the following toxicities, which do not resolve per protocol within 14 days of
treatment being held: Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia, Grade 4 neutropenia, or Grade 3 
or 4 platelet count decrease.
5. Removed Grade 4 anemia dose modification criteria .   Subjects being considered for 
enrollment into this trial are often heavily pretreated with multiple chemotherapeutic 
agents. As a consequence of prior therapy, it is expected that subjects will be anemic and difficult to distinguish study drug effect.  In addition, Grade 4 anemia is unlikely to occur 
alone in the absence of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia which specifically have

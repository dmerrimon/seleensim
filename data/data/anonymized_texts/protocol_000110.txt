 1. STUDY OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS  
Primary Objective  
Hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) or hepatic veno- occlusive disease (VOD) 
is a complication of hemopoetic stem- cell transplantation that results from injury to the 
venous endothelium causing hepatic venous outflow obstruction at the level of the 
venules and sinusoids.  Other causes of SOS include liver transplant, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and alkaloid ingestion.  Clinically, it is characterized by hepatomegaly, jaundice, right upper quadrant pain and ascites.  Traditional ultrasound imaging criteria for the diagnosis of SOS have been shown to have poor sensitivity and specificity.  Our hypothesis is that quantitative shear wave ultrasound elastography will be more accurate in detecting this disease compared with conventional ultrasound parameters. 
Secondary Objective 
Our secondary hypothesis is that to quantitative shear wave ultrasound elastography will be more accurate in determin ing that SOS/VOD is severe ( See Table 2 for grading) 
compared with conventional ultrasound parameters.  
2.   BACKGROUND  
 Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) is a potentially fatal hepatic veno- occlusive 
disease-affecting children following bone marrow transplantation (BMT). SOS most likely develops secondary to sinusoidal endothelial damage and subsequent obstruction. The disease can be separated into mild, moderate, and severe forms; almost all patients diagnosed with severe SOS will die from this disease 
1. Children with severe SOS suffer 
from multi-organ failure with signs and symptoms of portal hypertension (ascites, varices, edema), renal and respiratory failure 
1,2. Although these children may be few and 
far between, the mere severity of the disease process and awful prognosis factors are valid reasons for more medical attention. SOS is usually diagnosed via clinical criteria and, despite available prophylaxis and treatment, children continue to die from this devastating disease. There have been a few retrospective and prospective studies examining ultrasound in adults BMT patients, which have showed limited effectiveness of traditional ultrasound parameters to detect SOS 
3-7. 
 
Quantitative shear wave u ltrasound elastography with acoustic force radiation imaging is 
an emerging technology that uses ultrasound pressure waves to provide an  estimate of 
tissue stiffness8-11. This technique is promising for pediatric imaging because it is 
portable, quick to perform, relatively low cost and involves no ionizing radiation.  Acoustic force radiation imaging and ultrasound elastography does not have any increased risks over conventional ultrasound imaging
8-13. It has been studied in pediatric 
liver imaging14-16, placental imaging13, thyroid imaging17,18 and musculoskeletal 
imaging19.

3. RATIONALE  
SOS is a disease with a low incidence but high mortality rate once diagnosed.  There are 
treatment s available for this disease if diagnosed early.  Currently , no good imaging 
prognostic factors are known.  Some imaging criteria for SOS are available but all detect the disease after it has been clinically confirmed.  
If we can discover an imaging modality that can  more accurately diagnose SOS and 
determin e prognosis at the time of imaging, then  we can guide how aggressive to be with 
the available interventions that can slow progression or stop the disease. 
4. STUDY DESIGN

IRB # 15060244 
Page 4 of 9  
 This is a single site prospective cohort study that will compare ultrasound elastography to 
traditional ultrasound parameters in bone marrow transplant patients who are at risk for development of SOS. 
5. TARGET STUDY POPLUATION SPECIFICS  
Inclusion Criteria  
 All patients Age < 21 years who are undergoing allogenic or autologous myeloablative stem cell transplant.  
Exclusion Criteria  
• Any patient who is undergoing reduced intensity conditioning regimen for stem cell transplant.  
• Any other medical or social condition that in the opinion of the investigator would make them unsuitable to participate.   
6. DATA COLLECTION  
Data Collection Procedures  
• Candidates for the study will be identified by the Hematology Oncology service 
when they are admitted for bone marrow transplant.  
• A member of the study team will consent that patient and/or their parents once the 
patient has been identified. 
 
• If the patient consents to the study, three limited abdominal Doppler ultrasound (US) and shear wave elastography will be performed . The initial US and 
elastography will be performed within a week from receiving condition regimen, second US and elastography on Day +3 to Day + 7 of transplant (preferably on day + 5 of transplant) and lastly, on Day +12 to Day +16 (preferably on Day +14)  
• Demographic, laboratory and c linical variables will be collected from  CIBMTR 
research registry database (IRB# 11120281) as well as from the EMR from the time of initial ultrasound and through day 100 post-transplant.  
For subjects whom consented to take part in the CIBMTR database, a data 
request from CIBMTR will be requested using the assigned CRID number for each subject.  
Subjects that did not consent for CIBMTR database will have demographic, laboratory and clinical variables collected out of EMR into REDCap.  
Data will provided from  CIBMTR in the form of a spreadsheet and will be 
password protected and sent to CMH only for data analysis.

Records to be kept 
Protected health information (PHI) to be collected for the purpose of this study alone will include; age, gender, race, MRN, date of transplant, dates of ultrasound exams. This information will be documented in RedCap and CIBMTR password protected spreadsheet .  Within RedCap, there will be two separate files.  One file will exclude 
PHI and contain study data according to an assigned study ID number.  The second file, will contain a master list of subjects linking the subject PHI with the assigned 
study ID #.  The research record generated will consist of an excel spreadsheet from the data dictionary within RedCap. Security measures include: storage of the data on a password protected computer in a restricted assess departmental folder limited to only identified study personnel. 
Secure Storage of Data  
CIBMTR data will be stored on the hospital server and REDCap data will be manually entered and stored on the hospital server.  Development of data entry record will occur in collaboration with Medical Information Technology to ensure compliance and completeness.  The Children’s Mercy Hospital (CMH) Windows-based network is configured with the security of an individualized log in on a server that is backed up daily.  Resources provide full support for electronic data collection, storage, analysis and exchange.  The network is maintained by the Hospital Information Services professional staff.  CMH has two firewall protect ed Internet 
connections that allow transmission of large data and graphics files between CMH investigators and collaborators with I-2 connections.  CMH has secure transport appliances that use SSH, SFTP, and FTPS protocols to allow researchers to transmit and receive large datasets manually or automatically.

Stage 1, patient accrual and data collection  (2015-2017) 
Stage 2,  data analysis  (2017-2018) 
Stage 3, presentation and publication (2018) Projected start date:  Novemeber 1 , 2015 
Total length of time : two years  
Approximate end date of the study:  June 1, 2018 
8. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Measures  
• Primary measure: presence o r absence of SOS (clinical determination from 
provider, will refer to Cerner chart)  
• Secondary measure: severity of SOS (Cerner chart)  
  
General Design Issues  
• Primary objective: compare sensitivity and specificity of traditional ultrasound parameters and ultrasound elastography of the liver for detecting SOS in BMT patients.  
•  Secondary objectives: 1. compare sensitivity and specificity of traditional ultrasound parameters and ultrasound elastography of the liver for identifying severe SOS in BMT patients.   
 
Sample size determination  
 Previous articles showed that patients with SOS had velocities of 2.75 and 2.58 m/s versus velocities of 1.08 m/s in normal controls
20,21. The incidence of SOS in our BMT 
patient is estima ted to be around 10% and about 4 0 patients undergo transplant here in 1 
year.  So assuming a two year interval, we would have 8 patients with BMT and SOS and 72 patients with BMT and no SOS.  Based on a mean velocity of 2.66 m/s in SOS patients and 1.08 m/s in non- SOS patients and a s tandard deviation of 1 m/s in both 
populations, a two-sided t-test would have a power of 0.987 for detecting a statistically significant (p<0.05) difference between the means  
Data Analyses  
We will perform two -sided t-tests and nonparametric tests for categorical and continuous 
data, respectively. Additionally, we will perform a multivariate regression to determine which variables are significantly correlated to severe SOS (table 2) and calcu late an odds 
ratio for each of these variables.  If a patient is missing any imaging or clinical data, then 
this patient will be excluded from those parts of the data analysis, but the rest of their data will still be included in the study.

 HUMAN SUBJECTS   
Institutional Review Board (IRB) Review and Informed Consent 
Potential subjects will be identified by the Hematology/Oncology service once they are 
scheduled for BMT. Once potential subjects are identified and general eligibility is determined, a member of  the study team will approach the patient and their family and 
present the study to them. If the parent(s)/legal guardian deny an interest in the study, they are thanked for their time and are not subsequently contacted again .  
Subject Confidentiality  
  Each subject’s medical record will be reviewed by research staff and data entered into 
the research record. A master linking list will be maintained in the REDCap database and this list will only be visible to study personnel . 
Study Modification/Discontinuation 
The study may be modified or discontinued at any time by the IRB,  the OHRP, the FDA or other Government agencies as part of their duties to ensure that research subjects are protected.

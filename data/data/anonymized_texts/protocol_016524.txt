administered concomitantly  with MK -1654 without 
interference expected and do not require additional 
injections for the particip ant. 
This amendment removes the restriction on oral polio 
vaccine.
The restriction on oral rotavirus vaccine was removed 
with the previous amendment (AM03); however, 
exclusion criterion 19 was not updated, so this change 
is being made to align the exclusi on criterion with what 
is stated in Section 6.5.

Overall Desig n:
Study  Phase Phase 1/Phase 2
Primary  Purpose Prevention
Indication Prevention of lower respiratory tract infections (LRI ) and 
hospitalizations caused by respiratory  syncytial virus (RSV) 
A and B strains in infants born at 29 weeks gestational age
or older and of up to 8 months chronological age.
Population Health y pre -term infants (born at 29 to 35 weeks g estational 
age)and healthy  full-term infants (born at over 35weeks 
gestational age ).All participants will have chronological 
age of 2weeks to8months. 
Study  Type Interventional
Intervention Model Single Group
This is a multi- sitesingle ascending dose study .
Type of Control Placebo
Study  Blinding Double -blind
Estimated Duration of Study The Sponsor estimates that the study will require 
approximately 4years from the time that written informed 
consent is provided for the first partic ipant until the last 
participant’s last study -related telephone call or visit.
For purposes of analy sis and reporting, the overall study  
ends when the Sponsor receives the last serology  assay  
result.
Number of Participant s:
Approximately 180participants will be randomized such that a sufficient number of
evaluable participants in each panel complete the study ,as described in Section 9.9.

2.INTRODUCTION
Burden of RSV Infection in Infants 
Respiratory  syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of bronchiolitis, lower 
respiratory  tract infections (L RI), and hospitalization in infants. An estimated 74,000 to 
126,000 infant hospitalizations in the U nited States result from RSV each year, representing
an annual rate of 25 to 40per 1000 infants [Hall, C. B., et al 2013] [Shay , D. K., et al 1999] 
[Holman, R. C., et al 2004] . RSV infection has been associated with 43% to 74% of
bronchiolitis and19% to 54% of pneumonia cases in hospitalized children [Shay , D. K., et al 
1999] . In 2015, RSV was estimated to have caused 28% of acute L RIs and 2.7 to 3.8 million 
hospitalizations globally  in children under 5 y ears of age. Almost half of the hospitalizations 
(45%)occurred in infants y ounger than 6 months . Mortality  from RSV infection was
significant, with an estimated 94,600 to 149,400 childhood deaths worldwide [Shi, T., et al 
2015] . The overwhelming majorit y of RSV -associated deaths occur in developing countries. 
In contrast, in the Unite d States, the death rate in infants due to RSV is low, likely  due to 
quality  supportive care [Nair, H., et al 2010] .
Beyond hospitalization and death, RSV infection is a significant driver of outpatient health 
care utilization in infants, leads to the development of some chronic respiratory illnesses, and 
results in workday s missed by  caregivers [Bourgeois, F. T., et al 2009] . An estimated 2.2% 
(1.7 million visits) of all U nited States primary  care visits of children ≤ 5 years old in 2000 
were due to RSV infection. Pre -term infants with RSV averaged 12.4 physician office visits
for an y cause and 5 visits for respiratory  causes during their first 2 yearsof life ,whereas
children without RSV averaged 9.4 visits for an y cause and 2.9 visits for respiratory causes
during their first 2 yearsof life [Diez -Domingo, J., et al 2014] . Compared to influenza, 
children with RSV we re more likely  to receive intensive medical care, medications, including 
antibiotics, and radiologic studies [Bourgeois, F. T., et al 2009] . Children previously  infected 
with RSV also have a higher risk of devel oping some chronic conditions, including allergic 
rhino- conjunctivitis [Diez -Domingo, J., et al 2014] , recurrent wheezing, and asthma [Polack 
F. P. 2015] . Taken toget her, these data highlight the burden of RSV forinfants, caregivers, 
and healthcare providers and sy stems. 
Pre-term infants, and those with underl ying medical conditions, are pre -disposed to severe 
RSV infection. A proph ylactic monoclonal antibody  (mAb) t argeting the RSV fusion (F) 
protein, palivizumab (SynagisTM, MedImmune), is approved for the prevention of serious 
lower respiratory  tract disease caused b y RSV in children at high risk for RSV disease [U.S.
Prescribing Information 2009 ] [American Academy  of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious 
Diseases 2014] . However, the majority  of infants hospitalized with RSV infection have no 
predisposing risk factors and are otherwise healthy (only a younger age and p rematurit y have 
been independently associated with RSV illness requiring hospitalization) [Hall, C. B., et al 
2009] . The infant population in which palivizumab is recommended has narrowed 
considerabl y due to limited clinical benefit and high cost [American Academy  of Pediatrics 
Committee on I nfectious Diseases 2014] ; monthly dosing to cover the entire RSV season 
also limits the wide application of palivizumab. There fore, there is a need for proph ylaxisto 
087XXP

MK-1654 -002-04FINAL PROTOCOL 30-JUL-2020
prevent RSV infection and related complications in infants not recommended to receive 
palivizumab, which represents the overwhelming majority  of healthy  pre-term and full -term 
infants. 
Passive immunization with a neutralizing mAb against the RSV F protein, ie, palivizumab, is 
a proven proph ylaxis approach in infants. This approach provides near -immediate protection 
at birth [American Academy  of P ediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases 2014] and 
accommodates the immature immune sy stem and high safet y requisites of this infant 
population [Acosta, P. L ., et al 2015] [David Sny dman (Tufts) 2013] . Similarly , MK -1654 is 
also a neutralizing mAb against RSV, with additional attributes to facilitate its application as 
an RSV prophy lactic for infants currently  not receiving palivizumab , as outlined in 
Section 2.1. 
Study Rationale
This study  is being conducted to assess the safet y, tolerability ,and serum PKfollowing 
administration of MK -1654 I M to healthy  pre-term and full- term infants. The main objective 
is to identify  a well -tolerated dose in infants that is expected to provide high protection 
againstRSV through 5 months post- injection. 
Similar to thecompleted Phase 1a study  in healthy adult participants (P001), this study is 
randomized, placebo- controlled, double -blind, and uses a single ascending dose design. 
Information on the safet y and PK of MK-1654 in pre -term and full -term infants will further 
facilitate dose selection and clinical development in the target infant population. 
The study will enroll healthy  pre-term infants born at 29 to 35 weeks gestational age and 
healthy  infants born at over 35 weeks gestational age (throughout this protocol, defined as 
“full-term” in order to distinguish from the pre -term infant population, acknowledging that 
this differs from accepted definitions of full -term infants) . All participants will have 
chronolo gical age between 2weeks and 8 months at the time of consent , consistent with the 
peak age of hospitalization for RSV (2 -3months chronological age) and increased risk for 
RSV infection in infants. The full- term infants will be the final cohort within the study , after 
dose escalation and confirmation of short -term safety  in pre -term infants.
RSV prophy laxis is currently  unavailable for most infants. Palivizumab is approved in the 
United States, theEuropean U nion, and more than 80 countries globa llyforRSV prophy laxis 
in infants at high risk for RSV disease . However , the American Academ y of Pediatrics 
recommends limiting useof palivizumab forinfants born <29weeks gestation and infants 
with certain chronic illnesses such as congenital heart disease or chronic lung disease ,due to 
its modest efficacy , high cost, and the need for 5 separate monthly  injections [American 
Academ y of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases 2014] [Joffe, S., et al 1999] .

Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background
MK-1654 is a fully  human mAb targeting the RSV F protein, which the virus utilizes to enter 
host cells and fuse infected cells with adjacent cells, spread ingby forming sy ncytia. The 
Fprotein is considered a key  antigen for protective immunity , based on natural immunity  
studies and active and passive vaccine approaches (ie, palivizumab) [American Academ y of 
Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases 2014] [Graham, B. S., et al 2015] . MK -1654 
binds to the F protein an d neutralizes RSV infection of cells in vitro and reduces viral load in 
the nose and lungs of cotton rats infected with RSV A or B when administered 
prophy lacticall y [Wyde PR, Moore DK, Hepburn T, Silverman CL , Por ter TG, Gross M, 
1995]. Compared to palivizumab, MK -1654 exhibits greater potency  both in vitro and in the 
preclinical cotton -rat model (see IB). Mutations in the Fc region of MK -1654 result in an 
extended half-lifesuch that PK modeling suggests that a single dose of MK- 1654 will sustain 
therapeutic levels for 5 months in the majority  of infants entering their first RSV season (see 
IB for details).
Preclinical and Clinical Studies
Refer to the IB for pre clinical information on MK -1654.
Completed Clinical Studies
The FIH study , P001, was a 1-year,randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind, single 
ascending dose stud y to assess the safet y, tolerability, and PK of MK- 1654 administered as a 
single IM (100, 300 mg) or IV (300, 1000, 3000 mg) dose to health y adult participants. One 
hundred and fifty -twohealthy  male and female (non -child bearing potential) participants 
aged19to 59 years were enrolled (enrollment complete d FEB-2018) . Preliminary  results 
from this study  were used to confirm that the safety  and PK profile and dose levels of MK-
1654 in healthy  adults warrant edinitiating th isPhase 1b study  in healthy  pre-term and full -
term infants. No acute safety  reactions to MK -1654 were noted through completion of the 
highest dose (3000 mg IV) in Study P001 . Most AEs were transient and considered mild to 
moderate in intensity  by the investigator . No MK -1654- related SAEs were reported. See the 
IB for additional information.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:002-04 
MK-1654 -002-04FINAL PROTOCOL 30-JUL-2020
Approximately  180 healthy  male and female infants will be enrolled in the study , including 
140 pr e-term (born at 29 to 35 weeks gestational age) and 40 full -term (born at over 
35weeks gestational age )infants . All participants will have chronological age of2weeks to 
8months. 
Pre-term infants will be enrolled worldwide and allocated to 1 of 4 dose escalation panels 
(Panel A, B, C, or D). Within each sequential dose escalation panel, participants will be 
randomized by  IRTin a 4:1 ratio (active:placebo) to receive one of the fol lowing active 
doses or placebo: 
•Panel A: 20 mg, 
•Panel B: 50 mg, 
•Panel C: 75 mg, or 
•Panel D: 100 mg. 
Panel A will enroll a total of 10 participants (8 active, 2 placebo) at the lowest dose level; 
Panel B will enroll a total of 40participants (32 activ e, 8 placebo) at 50 mg; Panel C will 
enroll 50 participants (40 active, 10 placebo) at 75 mg to cover the expected target clinical 
dose; and Panel D will enroll 40 participants (32 active, 8 placebo) to receive 100 mg, the 
highest possible dose. Available safety , tolerability, and PK data from Panels A, B, and C 
will be anal yzed to inform the final dose level and allocation of participants in Panel D per 
Sponsor siDMC Meeting decision, as detailed in Section 6.6. Treatment 
allocation/randomization of pre -term infants in Panels B, C, and D will be stratified by  
weight using IRT, as described in Section 6.3.2.
Full-term infants will be enrolled worldwide into Panel E. Within this panel, participants will 
be randomized by  IRTin a 4:1 ratio (active:placebo) to receive either the following active 
dose or placebo: 
•Panel E: 100 mg
Panel E will enroll 40 participants (32 active, 8 placebo) at 100 mg, the highest possible 
dose. The dose level in Panel E will be determined as in Panel D per Sponsor siDMC .
Allparticipants will receive the assigned study  intervention (MK-1654 or placebo [ 0.9% 
sodium chloride, USP sterile saline ])administered via I M injection (s)on Day 1. Participants
inpanels A and B will receive stud y intervention administered as a single IM injection, as 
specified in the pharmacy manual. Participants in panels C, D, and E will receive 1 dose of 
study  intervention divided and administered as 2 IM injections , as specified in the pharma cy 
manual and Section 8.1.8 .
After randomization to MK -1654 or placebo within a panel, participants enrolled prior to 
Amendment 04 will also be randomized by IRTto 1of 4 different blood sampling schedules 
(Group 1a, Group 1b, Group 2a, or Group 2b). These differ in the schedule of venous and
microsampling, as outlined in SoA 1.3.1 and theoperations/ laboratory  manual . This

approach provides sufficient safet y and PK data to support dose escalation decisions and to 
meet study  objectives while minimizing the number of blood draws and total blood volume 
drawn from each participant at each visit and during the stud y overal l. Theapproximate total 
blood volume drawn per participant is approximately  9.0mL, as detailed in the 
operations/laboratory  manual .
As of Amendment 04, 2 SoAs have been created for p articipants in Panels D and E to 
distinguish their participation in the modified schedule, as follows:
Panels D1 and E1 (Section 1.3.1):
oParticipants enrolled in Panels D and E prior to Amendment 04 choosing not 
to participate in the modified schedule will follow the Panels D1 and E1 SoA.
Panels D2 and E2 ( Section 1.3.2):
oParticipants enrolled in Panels D and E prior to Amendment 04 choosing to 
participate in the modified schedule will follow the Panels D2 and E2 SoA 
(Group 3).
oParticipants enrolled in Panels D and E under A mendment 04 must follow the 
Panels D2 and E2 SoA.
See the Dose Escalation Diagram inFigure 1 andthe dose escalation procedures and decision 
criteria in Section 6.6 Dose Modification (Escalation) and Section 4.4.2 Clinical Criteria for 
Study  Pause.
Specific procedures to be performed during the study , as well as their prescribed times and 
associated visit windows, are outlined in the SoA in Section 1.3. Details of each procedure 
are provided in Section 8.
In addition to the interim safety and PK assessments for dose escalation decisions between 
panels, a n interim safet y and PK analysis will also be performed when the PK data are 
available for all evaluable pre -term infant participants in Panels A and B and at least 10 
pre-term infant participants in Panel C through Day  150 and will include available safety  and 
PK data from Panel s Dand E , as described in Section 9.7. The study  will be complete once 
all participants have completed their final safet y visit.

Rationale for selection of the primary safet yendpoint andof the secondary  and tertiary PK, 
pharmacod ynamic, and other exploratory endpoints in this study is discussed below .See 
Section4.3.3 and the IB for additional de tails on the scientific rationale for the study  design.

Rationale for Endpoints
Safety Endpoints
As this is an earl y clinical investigation of MK- 1654, safet y and tolerability of MK- 1654 will 
be the primary  endpoints and will be carefull y monitored. AEs, systemic and local injection 
reaction assessments, phy sical examinations , and VSwill be assessed during the intervention 
and follow -upperiod s, with assessment collection times optimized based on the expected PK 
properties of MK- 1654 in infants and the t ypical timing of reactions to mAbs. All AEs will 
be assessed for intensity .
Participants will be observed at the study  site for 2hourspost-dose for safety  monitoring for 
any immediate AEs, then will return to the study  site for visits and for safety  and PK 
assessments as set out in Section 1.3 SoA. In addition, on the evening of Day 1 and on Day s
2, 31 , 210 (7 months) and 270 (9 months) , participants will receive s afety follow -up 
telephone calls for review of concomitant medications and anyAEs/SAEs specified in 
Section 8.3.4. I nstructions for supportive care are outlined in Section 6.5.1. Temperature and 
AEs will also be documented on a validated diary  card administered via handheld electronic 
device , with entries reviewed with the legall y acceptable representative during the follow -up 
safet y visit on Day s 7and 14 and telephone call on Day 31.
The safet y follow -up period will be 365days post -dose for Panels A through C, D1, and E1
and 545 day s post -dose for Panels D 2and E2 . The safet y parameters for this study will 
include the proportion of participants with the following: 
Elevated temperature (≥102.2°F [39.0°C ] rectal or ≥101.7°F [38.7 °C] axillary  
equivalent ) from Day  1through Day 5post-dose; 
Solicited systemic treatment reaction AEs (irritability , drowsiness, fever, and appetite 
lost) from Day  1 through Day 5post-dose;
Solicited local injection reaction AEs(redness/erythema, swelling, and 
pain/tenderness) reported using the electronic diary  card from Day  1through Day 5
post-dose; 
Solicited AEs of allergic reactions ( hives or welts, lip swelling, wheezing, and 
difficulty  breathing) from Day  1through Day  30 post -dose;
Respiratory AEs from Day  1 post -dose through Day  365 post-dose;
Any other unsolicited non-serious AEs occurring from Day  1through Day  14 post -
dose;
SAEs throughout the study  duration (from the time the consent form is signed 
through Day 365 (Panels A through C, D1, and E1 )/Day  545 (Panels D 2and E2)
post-dose and/or completion of the participant’s participation in the study ; for

As with all biologic medications, MK -1654 carries a risk of acute s ystemic reactions upon 
exposure. These reactions can be categorized as common acute systemic injection reactions, 
acute h ypersensitivity  reactions, and high cy tokine release reactions. For other biologic 
medications, these reactions have been best described in adults. I n adults, common acute
systemic injection reactions are usuall y mild, and may manifest with rigors, back pain, 
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, d yspnea, flushing, pruritus, and changes in heart 
rate or blood pressure. Acute h ypersensitivity  reactions ty pically  occur after repeated 
exposures but can occur with the first dose. In addition to signs similar to common acute 
systemic injection reactions, participants may  develop urticaria, wheezing, coughing, facial 
swelling, angioedema, and more significant ch anges in VS. Following initial exposure or re -
exposure to palivizumab, cases of anaph ylaxis and anaph ylactic shock, including fatal cases, 
have been reported. An anaphy lactic reaction is a severe t ype ofacute s ystemic injection 
reaction characterized b y cutaneous and mucosal symptoms such as generalized hives, 
pruritus or flushing, swollen lips -tongue -uvula and angioedema, accompanied by  respiratory  
compromise (bronchospasm, stridor ,or hoarseness) and/or changes in blood pressure 
(hypotension), per the 20 06 Sampson criteria for anaphy laxis (Grade 4 reaction) [Sampson, 
H. A., et al 2006] .
The risk of an y of these acute sy stemic injection reactions to the MK -1654 antibody  is 
considered very low as it contains only human elements. The MK -1654 antibody  has no 
endogenous target in humans. I n the P001 clinical study , in which MK -1654 was
administered both IM and IV, no acute safety  reactions to MK -1654 were noted in healthy  
adult participants up to a dose of 3000 mg IV, as described in Section 2.2.3. Administration 
of a single IM dose of MK-1654 in this study  further reduc esthe risk of hypersensitivity  
reactions that were seen with re -exposure to palivizumab after multiple monthly  doses. 
Nevertheless, given potential safet y risks, participants will be closely monitored post -dose 
with a scheduled onsite safet y observation period. Study  staff will monitor participants 
through 2hourspost-dose for local and s ystemic sy mptoms of reactogenicity  to MK -1654 
with VS, plus phy sical examination as needed. 
Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
As part of the allocation number assignment and blood sampling groups , participants
enrolled prior to Amendment 04 will be assigned by  IRTto 1 of 4 different blood sampling
schedules (Group 1a, 1b, 2a, or 2b) .Participants who enroll in Panels D and E under 
Amendment 04 will be assigned to a separate blood sampling group (Group 3). Blood 
sampling groups describe the time points atwhich participants are to have blood drawn, as
scheduled in the SoA and outlin ed in the operations/ laboratory  manual , for the following 
PK/PD assay s.
Serum PK of MK -1654
The PK of MK -1654 will be measured as described in Section 1.3 to define C max, the 
distribution of the mAb, and the PK profile when administ ered IM. PK will be measured 
using a validated bioanaly tical assay  throughout the entire 1- year stud y period to determine

the half -life of the molecule, which will support PK projections for subsequent clinical 
development in the targe t infant population. 
Blood Microsampling Assay
The blood microsampling PK profile after a single IM dose of MK -1654 will be evaluated. 
This will support development of a validated whole blood microsampling assay for MK- 1654 
PK, with the intent that blood volumes required for these tests would be reduced in future 
studies. 
MK-1654 PK and Infant Body Weight
The PK profile of MK -1654 will be estimated in different segments of the infant population 
with respect to bod y weight. This will help to further charac terize MK -1654 PK and further 
inform dose selection in the target infant population. Treatment allocation/randomization of 
pre-term infants in Panels B, C, and D will be stratified by  weight using IRT, as described in
Section 6.3.2.
Pharmacodynamic Endpoin ts
The following exploratory endpoints will be evaluated to characterize the pharmacod ynamics 
of a single IM dose of MK -1654.
Anti -drug Antibodies to MK -1654
The presence and titer of ADAs will be measured. ADAs can develop to biologics like 
MK-1654 and ma y be either clinicall y inconsequential or change the drug PK and/or 
efficacy . Moreover, ADAs may  lead to loss of drug efficacy  and/or AEs. Therefore, ADA 
titers will be anal yzed for association with PK and safet y events and, as applicable, for 
associations with RSV SNA titers, as described below . 
RSV SNAs
This study  will also evaluate the effect of single ascending doses of MK -1654 on RSV SNA . 
In this assay , serial dilutions of the participant’s serum will be used to inhibit the entry  of 
RSV into target cells in vitro. Total RSV serum neutralizing activity could be influenced b y 
environmental exposure to RSV in addition to the presence of MK -1654. Moreover, the 
activity  of MK -1654 may  be inhibited by  the presence of ADAs. Therefore, unexpected 
changes in RSV SNA titers will be examined for associations with respiratory  infection and 
ADA titer. 
Other Exploratory Endpoints
The following additional exploratory  endpoint will be evaluated.

Acute Respiratory Infection Incidence
The incidence of viral ARI in the study will be explored, as determined b y presence of 
symptoms (as listed in Section 8.8.2) and RT -PCR detection. This will serve to describe the 
incidence of ARI, including RSV, influenza, and hMPV infection, and help to determine the 
infectious cause of the ARI  and estimate the relative proportion of RSV A and B infections in 
the target infant population. The proced ures for r espiratory  virus infection determination are 
detail ed in Section 8.8.Note that t his study  is not powered to show an effect of MK -1654 on 
the incidence of L RI or hospitalizations caused by RSV . 
Future Biomedical Research
The Sponsor will conduct future b iomedical research on specimens for which consent was 
provided during this study. This research may  include genetic anal yses (deoxy ribonucleic 
acid [ DNA] ), gene expression profiling ( ribonucleic acid [ RNA ]), proteomics, metabolomics 
(serum, plasma ) and/or the measurement of other anal ytes, depending on which specimens 
are consented for future biomedical research.
Such research is for biomarker testing to address emergent questions not described elsewhere 
in the protocol (as part of the main study ) and will only  be conducted on specimens from 
appropriatel y consented participants. The objective of collecting/retaining specimens for 
future b iomedical research is to explore and identify  biomarkers that inform the scientific 
understanding of diseases and/or their therapeutic treatments. The overarching goal is to use 
such information to develop safer, more effective drugs/vaccines, and/or to ensure that 
participants receive the correct dose of the correct drug/vaccine at the correct time. The 
details of this f uture b iomedical research are presented in Appendix 6:Collection and 
Management of Specimens for Future Biomedical Research.
Rationale for the Use o f Comparator/Placebo
The primary  goal of the study  is to evaluate the safety  and tolerability  of MK -1654 in the 
target infant population. A placebo -controlled study  will allow for an unbiased assessment of 
safet y and tolerability of MK- 1654. Secondary  and exploratory  outcomes are also supported 
by the use of placebo, including the identification of ADAs, which should only  be observed 
in participants receiving MK -1654, and the effect of MK -1654 on RSV serum neutralizing 
activity , which could be influenced b yenvironmental exposure to RSV, making a placebo 
arm a key  negative control. L astly, as participants are healthy infants of at least 29 weeks 
gestational age and not recommended to receive palivizumab (the only  approved RSV 
prophy lactic), an active compara tor is not possible. Sterile 0.9% saline has been chosen as 
the placebo as the goal of the study  is to test the relative safet y and tolerability  of the 
MK-1654 investigational product.

Justification for Dose
Starting Dose for This Study
The starting IM dos e in this study  is 20 mg(refer to the IB for discussion of the starting IM 
dose and safet y margin in humans ).The MK -1654 molecule is considered to be of low risk to 
human participants as a fully  human m Ab with linear PK in non -human primates and no 
endog enous target in humans. I t is expected to have no biologic effect in the absence of RSV 
infection. The safet y of MK -1654 administration to humans is supported by the results from 
preclinical toxicology , tissue cross -reactivity , and cy tokine release studies (refer to the IB for 
additional details). I t is also supported by  preliminary  clinical findings from the FIH study in 
healthy  adult participants, in which MK -1654 was tested up to an IM dose of 300 mg and up 
to an IV dose of 30 00mg, as described in Section 2.2.3.
Maximum Dose/Exposure for This Study
The maximum dose of MK -1654 in this study  (100 mg) was chosen to meet or exceed the 
anticipated clinical dose of MK -1654, which will be determined after an analy sis of the 
safet y, tolerabilit y, and PK from this study and prior to initiation of subsequent clinical 
studies in infants. This maximum dose is supported by safet y margins provided by both the 
pre-clinical safet y and P001 FIH studies of MK -1654. For comparison of the projected 
exposures in infants at MK -1654 doses at or exceeding 100 mg with those observed in the rat 
repeated- dose toxicity  study  and projected in the P001 FIH study , seethe IB. 
Prior clinical evaluat ion in adults and infants of similar mAbs targeting the RSV F protein 
also supports the maximum dose in this study . The projected exposures for MK -1654 in 
infants after administration of the proposed doses in this study  are based on preclinical 
studies of MK -1654 as well as extensive modeling with the clinical benchmark, 
motavizumab -YTE; seetheIB for details.
MK-1654 has a similar target, mechanism of action, and safet y and PK profile to those of 
MedI mmune’s marketed agent, palivizumab, which is indicated for infants at high risk of 
RSV disease. Both mAbs are directed against a foreign target acting via the established 
mechanism of binding to the RSV F protein to prevent viral cell entry  [American Academy  
of Pediat rics Committee on Infectious Diseases 2014] . MedI mmune has also tested another 
mAb with a similar mechanism of action, motavizumab, in a Phase 3 randomized, double -
blind, placebo- controlled study in infants [O'B rien, K. L ., et al 2015] . A version of 
motavizumab with YTE mutations (simila r to MK -1654) tested in a Phase 1 study  in health y 
adults showed a comparable safet y and tolerability profile to that of the parental mAb, 
motavizumab, along with an extended h alf-life after IV dosing up to 30 mg/kg [Robbie, G. J., 
et al 2013] . MedI mmune has also recently  completed a FIH study  of another RSV F protein -
specific mAb with YTE mutations, MEDI 8897, in healthy  adult partici pants. I n this study , 
MEDI8897 administered up to an I M dose of 300 mg and up to an IV dose of 3000 mg had a 
safet y profile similar to that of placebo [Griffin MP, Khan AA, Esser MT, Jensen K, Takas 
T, Kankam MK 20 16].

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:002-04 
MK-1654 -002-04FINAL PROTOCOL 30-JUL-2020
Rationale for Dose Interval and Study Design
The dosing regimen was determined based on the known pharmacology  of similar mAbs, the 
dose-linear PK profile and extended half -life of MK -1654 in non- human primates and PK 
profile of MK- 1654 in healthy  adults, the preclinical safet y margins for MK -1654, and 
inclusion of extensive safety  monitoring in the present study . Safety  assessment studies, 
ancillary  pharmacology  studies, and the ongoing FIH study  with MK -1654 provide no 
contraindications to the ini tiation of clinical studies of MK -1654 administered via the IM 
route in infants. No dose -limiting toxicities were observed in the GLP repeat -dose toxicity  
study  in rats, and substantial preclinical safet y margins were obtained over initial human 
doses.
This study will have up to 5 sequential dose escalation panels and enroll approximately
180participants ( approximately  144 receiving MK -1654 and 36 receiving placebo). The 
rationale for Panel D in 40 participants (32 active and 8 placebo) is to gain additional 
experience at MK-1654 100 mg .
Beginning and End ofStudy Definition
The overall study  begins when written informed consent is provided for the first participant. 
The overall study  ends when the last participant completes the last study -related telephone -
call or visit, withdraws from the study, or is lost to follow -up (ie, the participant is unable to 
be contacted b y the investigator).
For purposes of analy sis and reporting, the overall study  ends when the Sponsor receives the 
last serology  assay  result.
Clinical Criteria f orEarly Study Termination
The clinical stud y ma y beterminated earl y if the extent (incidence and/or severit y) of 
emerging effects/clinical endpoints is such that the risk/benefit ratio to the study  populati on 
as a whole is unacceptable. In addition, further recruitment in the study  or at (a) particular 
study site(s) may  be stopped due to insufficient compliance with the protocol, G ood C linical 
Practice (GCP) and/or other applicable regulatory requirements, and/or procedure -related 
problems and/ orifthe number of discontinuations for administrative reasons is too high.
Clinical Criteria for Study Pause
During the study , if any  of the following events occur, the stud y will be paused to further 
dosing:
One treatment -related SAE.
Two or more treatment -related severe AEs (Grade 3 or higher )for 2 day s or greater 
duration , as defined in the diary  card, within the same dose panel.

Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
Intervention Assignment
Intervention allocation/randomiz ation will occur centrally using an IRT s ystem. There are 6 
study  intervention arms. Participants will be assigned randoml y in a 4:1 ratio to 20 mg 
MK-1654 or placebo, 50 mg MK -1654 or placebo, 75 mg MK -1654 or placebo, or, 100 mg 
MK-1654 or placebo in panels A, B, C, and D, respectivel y, or 100 mg MK -1654 or placebo 
in panel E. Nested in the randomization to MK -1654 or placebo within Panels A through C, 
D1, and E1 , participants will also be randomized by IRTto 1of 4 different blood sampling
schedules (Group 1a, Group 1b, Group 2a, or Group 2b).All participants in Panels D2 and 
E2will follow the same blood sampling schedule (Group 3) .
Stratification
Treatment allocation/randomization of pre -term infants in Panels B, C, and D will be 
stratif ied by  weight. 
In Panels B and D, at least 12.5% of participants enrolled will be small pre -term infants 
(weigh 2 to 5 kg [inclusive] at randomization) ,and up to 87.5% of participants enrolled will 
be large pre -term infants (weigh more than 5 kg at rando mization). 
In Panel C, at least 10 % of participants enrolled will be small pre -term infants (weigh 2 to 
5kg [inclusive] at randomization) ,and up to 90% of participants enrolled will be large pre -
term infants (weigh more than 5 kg at randomization).
Treatment allocation/randomization of pre -term infants in Panel A will not be stratified by 
weight , due to the small number of participants in this lowest -dose panel .Safet y and PK 
evaluation in small infants will be sufficient based on the number of small pre-term infants in

Panels B, C, and D, so stra tification of treatment allocation/randomization of full-term 
infants in Panel Ewill not be necessary .
Blinding
A double -blinding technique will be used. MK-1654 and placebo will be prepared and
administered in a blinded fashion by  an unblinded pharmacist or medically  qualified study  
personnel not otherwise involved in the conduct of the study . Unblinded study  personnel 
should not have contact with participants for an y study -related procedures/assessments pos t-
dose, including all safet y follow -up procedures. The participant’s legally  acceptable 
representative and the investigator (s) will be unaware of the stud y intervention assignments . 
See Section 8 .1.10 for a description of the method of unblinding a partic ipant during the 
study , should such action be warranted.
Study Intervention Compliance
Study  interventions will be prepared and administered as described in Section 6.2.1 and 
Section 6.3.3 and stored, handled, and documented as described in Section 6.2.2. 
Study  intervention information, such as Component I dentification Number, dose panel, and 
time of administration, must be recorded on the appropriate electronic case report form 
(eCRF )as outlined in the Data Entry  Guidelines.
Concomitant Therapy
Administration of non- study  licensed pediatric vaccines [eg, influenza, hepatitis B, 
diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine(s)] will be permitted during this study provided the 
following conditions are met:
Inactivated or component vaccines (eg, influenza, hepatitis B) should not be 
administered less than 14 day s pre -or post -dose.
Live, attenuated, non -study  licensed pediatric vaccines (eg, Bacillus Calmette –Guérin 
vaccine) should not be administered less than 30 days pre -or post -dose.
No p rior administration of an y vaccine or m Ab for the prevention of RSV.
Oral rotavirus and oral polio vaccine may  be administered without any  exclusionary  
windows around MK- 1654.
Medications or vaccinations specificall y prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the time periods specified b y this protocol for that medication or vaccination. If there 
is a clinical indication for any  medication or vaccination specificall y prohibited, 
discontinuation from study  therap y ma y be required. The investigator should discuss any 
questions reg arding this with the Sponsor Clinical Director. The final decision on any 
supportive therap y or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the participant's primary

agreement of the investigator, the Sponsor, and the participant’s legall y acceptable 
representative.
Any concurrent medication or medical treatment must be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.
Paracetamol/acetaminophen may  be used for minor ailments wi thout prior consultation with 
the Sponsor.
Rescue Medications and Supportive Care
As outlined in the IB and Section 4.2.1.1, the risk of acute s ystemic or local injection 
reactions to MK- 1654 is considered low. However, acute s ystemic or local injection re actions 
may be observed. As the purpose of the stud y is to characterize the safet y profile of 
MK-1654, no proph ylactic pre -medications to reduce the risk of injection reactions will be 
given prior to MK -1654 administration. 
All participants will be observed for 2 hour spost-dose for acute reactions to MK -1654 and 
evaluated for systemic and local injection reactions. Severe injection reactions, including 
cytokine release s yndrome and h ypersensitivity  reactions ,must be promptly  treated with 
medical manageme nt, appropriate monitoring, and life -saving measures. Appropriate 
resuscitation equipment and a phy sician /designee and/or study  staff will be readily available 
during the period of drug administration through the 2- hour post -dose onsite safet y 
observation period. Less severe injection reactions may  respond to medical management. 
Acetaminophen may  be administered per investigator discretion without prior consultation 
with the Sponsor.
Participants who experience injection reactions, including hypersensitivity reactions ,in 
conjunction with the study  intervention should receive appropriate supportive care measures 
as deemed necessary  by the treating ph ysician. Investigators should strongly  consider 
hospitalization for any  severe s ystemic reaction or any  life-threatening reactions. Participants 
should be carefully  observed until complete resolution of all signs and s ymptoms, if a 
reaction occurs. An y AEs will be reported according to the guidelines in Section 8.4 and 
Section 10.3 (Appendix 3) .
Dose Modification (Escalation)
Each panel will enroll 4 participants (stud y-wide, not per site) with review of safet y through 
Day 3 before additional participants can be dosed within the panel, except in Panel D and E if 
the dose level is not escalated from Panel C. The site lead investigator(s) at the respective 
site(s) an d Sponsor will assess the first 2 participants for safet y through Day 3 prior to dosing 
the next 2 participants. The site lead or sub -investigator(s) at the respective site(s) and 
Sponsor will then assess the next 2 participants for safet y through Day 3 prior to dosing
additional participants in the panel . An IRT hold will prevent enrollment/randomization of 
additional participants study -wide until this is achieved; when this hold is lifted, 
enrollment/randomization and dosing of the remaining participants in the panel may  proceed 
(study -wide). This is to allow for identif ication of any potential sy stemic treatment -related 
AEs that could be observed with dose escalation. If no clinical criteria for study pause in

Section 4.4.2 are met, further dosi ng within the panel may  proceed . Safety  follow -up, as 
scheduled in the SoA, is detailed in Section 4.2.1.1. 
The decision to escalate the dose between Panels A andB and Panels B and C will be made 
based on review of :1) available safety  data through at least Day 14 for at least 50% of 
participants in the previous panel(s) ;and 2) available PK data from the previous panel(s). 
Ongoing safet y monitoring and PK anal yses will continue throughout Panels A, B, and C.
The decision to dose escalate between Panel sC and D in pre -term infants and between 
Panel C in pre -term infants and Panel E in full -term infants, and on the dose level (s)in 
Panels D and E (up to 100 mg), will be made in a nsiDMC Meeting based on review of : 
1)available safet y data thro ugh at least Day 14 from Panels A, B, and C ;2)PK data through 
Day 90 for evaluable participants in Panel A and PK data through Day 30 for at least 50% of 
evaluable participants in Panel B ;and 3) available PK data from Panel C. Note that Panels D 
andE may initiate prior to completion of Panel C. 
ThesiDMC will hold a meeting after Panel Cfor the decision to escalate the dose in
Panels D and E. 
If, as judged b y the Sponsor, the safet y,tolerability , and PK data do not justify  dose 
escalation, the dose will not be increased as planned. Instead, participants may:
•Receive the same dose level to further explore safety  and tolerability  at that level,
•Receive a lower dose of the study  intervention,
•Receive the same or lower dose, or
•Dosing may  be stopped.
Clinical criteria for stud y pause are specified in Section 4.4.2.
Intervention After the End of the Study
There is no stud y-specified intervention following the end of the stud y.
Clinical Supplies Disclos ure
The emergency  unblinding call center will use the randomization schedule for the stud y to 
unblind participants and to unmask study  intervention identity . The emergency  unblinding 
call center should only  be used in cases of emer gency (see Section 8.1.10). In the event that 
the emergency  unblinding call center is not available for a given site in this study , the central 
electronic intervention allocation/randomization sy stem (IRT) should be used to unblind 
participants and to unmask study  intervention identity. The Sponsor will not provide random 
code/disclosure envelopes or lists with the clinical supplies. See Section 8 .1.10 for a 
description of the method of unblinding a participant during the stud y, should such action be 
warranted.

7.DISCONTINUATION OF S TUDY INTERVENTION AND PARTICIPANT 
WITHDRAWAL
Discontinuation of Study Intervention
Discontinuation of study  intervention does not represent withdrawal from the study .
As certain data on clinical events beyond study  intervention discontinuation may  be 
important to the study , they  must be collected through the participant’s last scheduled follow-
up, even if the participant has discontinued study intervention. Therefore, all participants 
who discontinue stu dy intervention prior to completion of the protocol -specified intervention
period will still continue to participate in the study as specified in the SoA and 
Section 8.13.3.
Participants may  discontinue study  intervention at any  time for an y reason or be discontinued 
from the study  intervention at the discretion of the investigator should an y untoward effect 
occur. In addition, a participant may  be discontinued from stud y intervention by the 
investigator or the Sponsor if study  intervention is inappropriate , the stud y plan is violated, or 
for administrative and/or other safet y reasons. Specific details regarding procedures to be 
performed at study  intervention discontinuation are provided in Section 8.13.3.
A participant must be discontinued from study inter vention but continue to be monitored in 
the study  for an y of the following reasons:
•The participant’s legally  acceptable representative requests to discontinue study  
intervention.
For participants who are discontinued from study  intervention but continue to be 
monitored in the study , all visits and procedures, as outlined in the SoA, should be 
completed.
Discontinuation from study  intervention is “permanent.” Once a participant is discontinued, 
he/she shall not be allowed to restart stud y interven tion.
Participant Withdrawal From the Study
A participant must be withdrawn from the study  if the participant’s legally  acceptable 
representative withdraws consent from the stud y.
If a participant withdraws from the study , they will no longer receive stud yintervention or be 
followed at scheduled protocol visits.

PRODUCT: MK-1654 61
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:002-04  
MK-1654 -002-04FINAL PROTOCOL 30-JUL-2020
Specific details regarding procedures to be performed at the time of withdrawal from the 
study ,as well as specific details regarding withdrawal from future biomedical r esearch, are 
outlined in S ection 8.1.9 .The procedures to be performed should a participant repeatedl y fail 
to return for scheduled visits and/or if the study  site is unable to contact the participant are 
outlined in Section 7.3.
Lost t o Follow -up
If a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study  visit and/or if the site is unable 
to contact the participant, the following procedures are to be performed:
•The site must attempt to contact the participant’s legally  acceptable representative and 
reschedule the m issed visit. I f the participant ’s legally  acceptable representative is 
contacted, the participant ’s legally  acceptable representative should be counseled on the 
importance of maintaining the protocol -specified visit schedule.
•The investigator or designee m ust make every  effort to regain contact with the 
participant’s legall y acceptable representative at each missed visit (eg, telephone calls 
and/or a certified letter to the legally  acceptable representative’s last known mailing 
address or locally  equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in 
the participant’s medical record.
•Note: A participant is not considered lost to follow -up until the last scheduled visit for the 
individual participant. The missing data for the participant will be managed via the 
prespecified statistical data handling and anal ysis guidelines.
8.STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
•Study  procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA.
•Adherence to the stud y design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is 
essential and required for study  conduct.
•The investigator is responsible for ensuring that procedures are conducted by  
appropriatel y qualified (by education, training, and experience) staff. Delegation of study 
site personnel responsibilities will be documented in the Investigator Trial File Binder ( or 
equivalent) .
•All study -related medical decisions must be made by  an investigator who is a qualified 
physician.
•All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participa nts meet all eligibility  criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility  or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.

PRODUCT: MK-1654 62
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:002-04  
MK-1654 -002-04FINAL PROTOCOL 30-JUL-2020
•Procedures conducted as part of the particip ant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood 
count) and obtained before signing of ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline 
purposes provided the procedure met the protocol -specified criteria and were performed 
within the time frame defined in the SoA.
•Additional evaluations/testing may  be deemed necessary  by the investigator and or the 
Sponsor for reasons related to participant safet y. In some cases, such evaluation/testing 
may be potentially  sensitive in nature (eg, HIV, Hepatitis C), and thus local regulations 
may require that additional informed consent be obtained from the participant’s legall y 
acceptable representative . In these cases, such evaluations/testing will be performed in 
accordance with those regulations.
Theapproximate total blood volume drawn per participant is approximately  9.0mL, as 
detailed in the operations/ laboratory  manual . The maximum amount of blood collected from 
each participant over the duration of the study , including for any  extra assessments that may  
be required, will be in accordance with regulatory guidelines for pediatric studie s and 
recommended maximum blood draw volumes [Jack, R. 2001] . Repeat or unscheduled 
samples may  be taken for safet y reasons or for t echnical issues with the samples.
Administrative and General Procedures
Informed Consent
The investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) must 
obtain documented consent from each potential participant’s legall y acceptable 
representative prior to participating in a clinical study or future biomedical r esearch .If there 
are changes to the participant’s status during the study  (eg, health or age of majority  
requirements), the investigator or medically qualified desi gnee must ensure the appropriate 
consent is in place .
General Informed Consent
Consent must be documented on the consent form by the dated signature ofthe participant’s 
legally  acceptable representative along with the dated signature of the person conducting the 
consent discussion.
A cop y of the signed and dated consent form should be given to the participant ’s legall y 
acceptable representative before the individual’s participation in the study .
The initial I CF, any  subsequent revised written ICF, and an y written information provided to 
the participant ’s legally  acceptable representative must receive the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Comm ittee’s ( IRB/IEC’s )approval/favorable opinion in advance 
of use. The participant ’slegally  acceptable representative should be informed in a timely  
manner if new information becomes available that may  be relevant to the willingness for the 
participant to continue participation in the study . The communication of this information will

be provided and documented via a revised consent form or addendum to the original consent 
form that captures the dated signature of the participant’s legall y acceptable represe ntative.
Specifics about a stud y and the study population will be added to the consent form template 
at the protocol level.
The informed consent will adhere to IRB/IEC requirements, applicable laws and regulations, 
and Sponsor requirements .
Consent and Col lection of Specimens for Future Biomedical Research
The investigator or medically  qualified designee will explain the future biomedical research 
consent to the participant’s legally acceptable representative, answer all of his/her questions, 
and obtain wri tten informed consent before performing an y procedure related to future 
biomedical research. A copy  of the informed consent will be given to the participant’s le gally 
acceptable representative .
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
All inclusion and exclusion crite ria will be reviewed by  the investigator , who is a qualified 
physician, to ensure that the participant qualifies for the study .
Participant Identification Ca rd
The legall y acceptable representative for each participant will be given a participant 
identific ation card identifying the individual as a participant in a research study . The card 
will contain study  site contact information (including direct telephone numbers) to be used in 
the event of an emergency. The investigator or qualified designee will provide the legally  
acceptable representative fo r each participant with a participant identification card 
immediately  after written informed consent is provided. At the time of intervention
allocation/randomization, site personnel will add the intervention/randomization number to 
the participant identif ication card.
The participant identification card also contains contact information for the emergency 
unblinding call center so that a healthcare provider can obtain information about study  
intervention in emergency  situations where the investigator is not available.
Medical History
A medical history  will be obtained by  the investigator or qualified designee.
Prior and Concomitant Medications Revi ew
Prior Medications
The investigator or qualified designee will review prior medication /vaccination useand 
record prior medication taken b y the participant to assess inclusion and exclusion criteria 
including time windows for medication/vaccination use.

Concomitant Medications
The investigator or qualified designee will record medication, if any, taken by the participant 
during the stud y.
Any concurrent medication or medical treatment must be recorded on the appropriate eCRF . 
On the day  of dosing , it is important to record the use of an y analgesic or antipy retic use on 
the electronic diary  card and appropriate eCRF.
If a medical condition required the use of immunoglobulins, blood, or blood products during 
a participan t’s participation in this study , one of the individuals listed on the Sponsor Contact 
Information page must be notified as soon as possible and an y such use must be documented 
on the appropriate eCRF.
Assignment of Screening Numb er
All consented participants will be given a unique screening number that will be used to 
identify  the participant for all procedures that occur prior to randomization .Each participant 
will be assigned onl y 1 screening number. Screening numbers must not be re -used for 
different participants.
Any participant who is screened multiple times will retain the original screening number 
assigned at the initial screening visit. Specific details on the screening/rescreening visit 
requirem ents are provided in Section 8.13.1.
Assignment of Treatment/Randomization Numb er
All eligible participants will be randomly allocated and will receive a 
treatment/randomi zation number. The treatment/randomization number identifies the 
participant for all procedures occurring after treatment allocation/randomization. Once a 
treatment/randomization number is assigned to a participant, it can never be re -assigned to 
another participant.
A single participant cannot be assigned more than 1 treatment/randomization number.
Study Intervention Administrati on
Unblinded study  personnel not otherwise involved in the conduct of the study  will prepare 
and administer the study  interventio n. Study  intervention should be prepared by  and 
administered b yan unblinded pharmacist or appropriately  qualified members of the study  
personnel (eg, phy sician, nurse, phy sician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, pharmacist, or 
medical assistant) as allowed by local/state, country ,and institutional guidance and described 
inSection 6.2, Section 6.3.3, and the pharmacy  manual.

Timing of Dose Administration
Study  intervention is given on the day  of treatment allocation/randomization or as close as 
possible to the date on which the participant is allocated/assigned.
MK-1654 or placebo, as randomly  assigned, will be administered to each participant at the 
study  site on Day 1, as set out in the SoA and specified in Section 6.2.1, Section 8.1.8, and 
the P harmacy  Manual. 
See Section 6.5on the timing of stud y intervention administration with regard to concomitant 
therap y.
Participants will be observed for 2 hoursimmediately  post -dose for safet y monitoring by  the 
blinded investigator and/or study  staff, as described in the SoA and Section 4. 2.1.1.
Diary Card
Each p articipant ’s legall y acceptable representative will be provided a n electronic diary card 
on a handheld electronic device to help in identifying an y systemic or local injection 
reactions. The electronic diary  card and use of the handheld electronic device will be 
reviewed with the participant’s legall y acceptable representative atthe study  site,as indicated 
in the SoA.
Discontinuation and Withdrawal
Participants who discontinue study  intervention prior to completion of the intervention period
should be encouraged to continue to be followed for all remaining study visits.

When a participant withdraws from participati on in the study , all applicable activities 
scheduled for the final study  visit should be performed (at the time of withdrawal). An y AEs
that are present at the time of withdrawal should be followed in accordance with the safet y 
requirements outlined in Sec tion 8.4. Participants who discontinue ≥2 weeks after last blood 
draw will complete the Day  365 (Panels A through C, D1, and E1 ) or Day  545 (Panels D 2
andE2)visit blood collection, regardless of their assigned blood sampling schedule group. 
Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Resear ch
Consent for future biomedical r esearch may be withdrawn b y the participant’s legally 
acceptable representative . Consent may  be withdrawn b y the legall y acceptable 
representative at an y time by contacting the principal investigator for the main study . If 
medical records for the main study  are still available, the investigator will contact the 
Sponsor using the designated mailbox (clinical.specimen.manage ment@merck.com). 
Subsequently ,the participant's consent for future biomedical r esearch will be withdrawn. A 
letter will be sent from the Sponsor to the investigator confirming the withdrawal. It is the 
responsibility  of the investigator to inform the part icipant ’s legally  acceptable representative
of completion of withdrawal. An y anal yses in progress at the time of request for withdrawal 
or alread y performed prior to the request being received b y the Sponsor will continue to be 
used as part of the overall research stud y data and results. No new anal yses would be 
generated after the request is received.
In the event that the medical records for the main study  are no longer available (eg, if the 
investigator is no longer required b y regulatory authorities to retain the main study  records) 
or the specimens have been completel y anon ymized, there will no longer be a link between 
the participant’s personal information and their specimens. In this situation, the request for 
specimen withdrawal cannot be processed. 
Participant Blinding/Unblindi ng
STUDY INTERVENT ION IDENT IFICATION INFORMAT ION IS TO BE UNMASKED 
ONLY IF NECESSARY FOR THE WELFARE OF THE PARTICIPANT. EVERY 
EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE NOT TO UNBLIND.
For emergency  situations where the investigator or medically  qualified designee (consistent 
with local requirements) needs to identify  the intervention used by  a participant and /orthe 
dosage administered , he/she will contact the emergency  unblinding call center by  telephone 
and make a request for emergency  unblinding. As requested b y the investigator or medically  
qualified designee, the emergency  unblinding call center will provide the information to 
him/her promptly  and report unblinding to the Sponsor. P rior to contacting the emergency  
unblinding call center to request unblinding of a participant’s intervention assignment, the 
investigator who is a qualified phy sician should make reasonable attempts to enter the 
intensity  grade of the AEs observed, the re lation to study  intervention, the reason thereof , 
etc., in the medical chart. If it is not possible to record this assessment in the chart prior to the 
unblinding, the unblinding should not be delay ed.

In the event that unblinding has occurred, the circums tances around the unblinding (eg, date, 
reason, and person performing the unblinding) must be documented promptly , and the 
Sponsor Clinical Director notified as soon as possible.
Once an emergency  unblinding has taken place, the investigator, site personne l, and Sponsor 
personnel may  be unblinded so that the appropriate follow -up medical care can be provided 
to the participant.
Participants whose treatment assignment has been unblinded by  the investigator or medicall y 
qualified designee and/or nonstudy  treating ph ysician should continue to be monitored in the 
study .
Additionally , the investigator or medically  qualified designee must go into the I RT sy stem 
and perform the unblind in the I RT sy stem to update drug disposition. In the event that the 
emergency  unblinding call center is not available for a given site in this study , the IRT 
system should be used for emergency  unblinding in the event that this is required for 
participant safety .
At the end of the s tudy, random code/disclosure envelopes or lists and unblinding logs are to 
be returned to the Sponsor or designee.

Physical Examinations
A complete ph ysical examination will be conducted by an investigator or medically  qualified 
designee (consistent with local requirements) as per institutional standard. Bod y weight and 
length will als o be measured and recorded.
A brief directed ph ysical examination will be conducted by an investigator or medicall y 
qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) per institutional standard based upon 
any emergent sy mptoms at the discretion of the investigator .
Investigators should pay  special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious 
illnesses.
Vital Signs
•Bodytemperature, heart rate , and respiratory  rate will be assessed.
•Temperature and respiratory rate will be measured and recorded as single measurements. 
The same method must be used for all measurements for each individual participant and 
should be the same for all participants.
•Rectal or axillary temperature will be taken b y study staff pre -and post -dose as set out in 
the SoA. Participants who have febrile illness (rectal temperature ≥38.1°C [100.5°F] or 
axillary  temperature ≥37.8°C [100.0°F]) within 72 hours pre -dose must be rescheduled. 
•Rectal is the preferred method of obtaini ng participant’s temperature. Axillary  
(underarm) is an acceptable method. Temperature readings must be recorded on the 
electronic diary  card. Temperature readings should be taken at approximately  the same 
time each day . Use of temporal or ty mpanic thermom eters to collect temperature for this 
study  is prohibited.
•The participant’s legally  acceptable representative will be asked to record a temperature 
reading on the electronic diary card from Day  1 through Day  5 post -dose. Temperature 
measurement must be re corded in the electronic diary  card if fever is suspected during 
Day 6 through Day  14post-dose.
•Heart rate will be measur ed with a completel y automated device. Manual techniques will 
be used onl y if an automated device is not available. Heart rate measure ments should be 
preceded b y at least 5 minutes of rest for the participant in a quiet setting without 
distractions.
•All VSmeasurements, including temperature readings captured on the electronic diary 
card, will be rec orded on the appropriate eCRF.

Systemi c and Local Injection Reaction Assessment
Participants will be monitored at the stud y site during dosing as outlined in the SoA for signs 
and sy mptoms of a s ystemic injection reaction, including urticaria (hives or welts), lip 
swelling, wheezing, and/or difficulty  breathing. If hives or welts occur during the 30 day s 
following MK- 1654 administration, the participant’ s legally  acceptable representative should 
contact the site to schedule an appointment with the study  site for an evaluation as soon as 
possibl e, where the study investigator will determine whether the rash represent san 
urticarial -like eruption. The study  site will also r eceive notice if allergic reactions are entered 
in the electronic diary  card and should contact the participant's legall y acce ptable 
representative for an evaluation if hives or welts orother allergic reactions occur during the 
30 day s following MK -1654 administration. If a rash is confirmed b y the study investigator 
as consistent with urticaria, the investigator may  obtain a dermatology  consult based on the 
investigator’s discretion. Any  systemic injection reactions must be assessed and managed 
promptly , as described in Section 6.5.1. 
During the safety  follow -up peri od (30 day s post dosing), surv eillance for RSV infe ction, 
including the common s ymptoms of difficulty  breathing and wheezing, will also be ongoing 
(beginning on Day  14 post dosing) for both resp iratory infection and allergic reaction. During 
this time ( Days 14- 30), clinical judgment will be required to assess the s ymptoms as part of 
respiratory infection or allergic reaction. Regardless of the diagnosis, the participant should 
be brought in for clinical assessment and further evaluation. 
An examination of the local injection site(s)will also be perform ed as scheduled in the SoA, 
including an assessment of an y pain, tenderness, erythema/redness, and induration/swelling
for each injection site . These events will be evaluated based on the scale outlined in
Section 10.3.4. 
Any subsequent systemic or local injection reaction sy mptoms will be captured as AEs/SAEs 
during safet y monitoring visits and follow -up, as scheduled in the SoA, and at home by the 
participant’s legall y acceptable representative on the diary  card using the handheld electronic 
device, as d escribed in Section 4.2 .1.1.
Any adverse systemic or local injection reaction will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF .
Safety Follow -up Telephone Calls
Safety  follow -up telephone calls will be performed at the time points indicated in the SoA. If 
a partic ipant is hospitalized at the time , a safet y follow -upcallwill be performed. Safet y calls 
must be performed b y appropriatel y trained stud y site staff. If the initial call is unsuccessful, 
the study  site staff should make a total of 3 attempts for each scheduled safety  call. All 
attempts to contact the participant’s legall y acceptable representative will be recorded in the 
source documents. The calls will facilitate the collection of relevant safet y information. The 
participant’s legall y acceptable represen tative will be interviewed to obtain information 
relating to all AEs through Day 14, solicited AEs of allergic reactions ( hives or welts ,lip

and E2 ). 
In addition, all concomitant medications and vaccinations will be recorded. All safet y 
information described b y the participant’s legally acceptable representative must be 
documented in the source documents.
Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
•Refer to Appendix 2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the 
SoA for the timing and frequency .
•The investigator must review the laboratory  report, document this review, and record an y 
clinically  relevant changes occurring during the study  in the AE section of the case report 
form (CRF). The laboratory  reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically  
significant abnormal laboratory  findings are those whi ch are not associated with the 
underly ing disease, unless judged b y the investigator to be more severe than expected for 
the participant's condition.
•All protocol -required laboratory  assessments, as defined in Appendix 2, must be 
conducted in accordance wi ththe opera tions/ laboratory  manual and the SoA .
•If laboratory  values from nonprotocol specified laboratory  assessments performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory  require a change in study  participant management or are 
considered clinically  significan t by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose 
modification), then the results must be recorded in the appropriate CRF (eg, SL AB).
•For an y laboratory  tests with values considered clinically  significantl y abnormal during 
participation in the study  or within 5days after the last dose of study  intervention, every  
attempt should be made to perform repeat assessments until the values return to normal or 
baseline or if a new baseline is established as determined by  the investigator .
Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) ,and Other Reportable 
Safety Events
The definitions of an AE or SAE, as well as the method of recording, evaluating, and 
assessing causalit y of AE and SAE and the procedures for completing and transmitting AE, 
SAE, and other reportable safet y event reports can be found in Appendix 3.
Adverse events, SAEs, and other reportable safety events will be reported by  the participant 
(or, when appropriate, b y a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legall y authorized 
representative).
The investigator, who is a qualified ph ysician, and any  designees are responsible for 
detecting, assessing, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or

SAE, as well as other reportable safety  events. Investigator s remain responsible for following 
up AE, SAEs, and other reportable safet y events for outcome according to Section 8.4.3.
Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE, SAE ,and Other Reportable 
Safety Event Information
All AEs, SAEs, and other reportable s afety  events that occur after the consent form is signed 
but before allocation/randomization must be reported by  the investigator if they  cause the 
participant to be excluded from the study  or are the result of a protocol -specified 
intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therap y, diet, 
placebo treatment, or a procedure.
From the time of allocation/randomization through Day 365 (Panels A through C , D1, and 
E1)or Day 545 (Panels D2and E2) following the administration of study intervention , all 
SAEs and other reportable safet y events must be reported b y the investigator.
Additionally , any SAE brought to the attention of an investigator at an y time outside of the 
time period specified in the previous paragraph, also must be reported immediatel y to the 
Sponsor if the event is either:
A death that occurs prior to the participant completing the study but outside the time 
period specified in the previous paragraph.
OR
An SAE that is considered by an investigator who is a qualified ph ysician to be study  
intervention- related.
Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AE or SAE or other reportable safet y events 
in former stud y participants. However, if the investigator learns of an y SAE, inclu ding a 
death, at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she 
considers the event to be reasonabl y related to the study intervention or study  participation, 
the investigator must promptly  notify  the Sponsor.
All initial and f ollow -up AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety  events will be recorded and 
reported to the Sponsor or designee within the time frames as indicated in Table 2.

Follow -up of AE, SAE ,and Other Reportable Safety Event Information
After the initial AE/ SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All AE s, SAE s, and other reportable safet y events 
including pregnancy  and exposure during breastfeeding, events of clinical interest (ECI s), 
cancer, and overdose will be followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is 
otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow- up (as defined in Section 7.3). In 
addition, the investigator will make every  attempt to follow all nonserious A Es that occur in 
randomized participants for outcome. Further information on follow -up procedures is given 
in Appendix 3.
Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAE
Prompt notification (within 24 hours) by  the investigator to the Sponsor of SAE is essential
so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of participants and the 
safety of a stud y intervention under clinical investigation are met.
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility  to notify  both the local regulatory  authority  and other 
regulatory  agencies about the safet y of a stud y intervention under clinical investigation. All 
AEs will be reported to regulatory  authorities, IRB/IECs, and investigators in accordance 
with all applicable global laws and regul ations (ie, per ICH Topic E6 (R2 ) Guidelines for 
Good Clinical Practice [GCP] ).
Investigator safety  reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSAR s) according to local regulatory  requirements and Sponsor policy  and 
forwarded to investigators a s necessary .
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safet y information (eg, summary or listing of SAE) from the Sponsor will file it 
along with the I Band will notify  the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements .

Treatment of Overdose
In this stud y, an o verdose is any  dose higher than the dose level in the assigned panel .
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose.
Pharmacokinetics
The decision as to which serum samples collected will be assay ed for evaluation of 
PK/pharmacod ynamics will be collaborativel y determined by the Sponsor (eg, samples at 
lower doses may  not be assay ed if samples at higher doses reveal undetectable drug 
concentrations). If indicated, these samples may also be assayed and/or pooled for assay in an 
exploratory manner for metabolites and/or additional pharmacod ynamic markers. See the

RSV Season Definition
The Sponsor will define the expected start and end of RSV season for each region 
participating in the stud y, based on several prior years’ RSV seasons, as determined by  
national surveillance and/or available peer -reviewed literature . Detailed instructions will be 
provided in the operations manual. 
Globally  each year, RSV epidemics initiate near the equator, in August and January  in the 
Northern and Southern Hemisphere, respectivel y, then move toward temperate regions. 
Global patterns in monthly  RSV activity  have been observed and annual average percentage 
of RSV activity  calculated for 152 sites globally in an ongoing review of RSV seasonality  
studies and on line datasets by  the Respiratory  Syncytial Virus Consortium in Europe 
(RESCEU) [You, L i 2017] .
In the U nited States, RSV season onset has ranged from late October to late January  and 
season offset has ranged fro m late January  to early  April in all 10 Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS) regions, except in Florida, which has an earlier RSV season onset 
and longer duration, as reported by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) National 
Respiratory  and Enter ic Virus Surveillance S ystem (NREVSS). During the 2013 –14 season, 
similarly  to previous national patterns, RSV began circulating nationall y in earl y November 
and ended in late March, with circulation peaking at 24% in late December. The RSV season 
(onset, offset, peak, and duration) is defined nationally , by HHS region, and by state, based 
on CDC analy sis of RSV laboratory  detections reported to the NREVSS. The CDC and 
World Health Organization define the onset of the RSV season as a 10% threshold of RSV-
positive specimens during 2 consecutive weeks. 
In the European U nion, the RSV season is ty pically  November to April with a peak in the 
mid-winter months [European Medicines Agency 2017 ]. The European influenza 
surveillance s ystem captures RSV detection through the influenza -like illness (ILI) or ARI 
surveillance s ystem from 21 European Union countries, as reported for the 2014 -15 season 
by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) [European Center For Disease 
Prevention And Control 2015] . 
In the Southern Hemisphere, the RSV season is generall y April to August, starting in 
February  in tropical and subtropical regions and then moving south, peaking in July  in 
tempera te regions.

RSV Surveillance Weekly Telephone Calls
During the RSV season, as defined in Section 8.8.1, RSV weekly  surveillance starts on 
Day 14 until the S ponsor deems that RSV season is ended. From Day  14, study  sites will 
conduct weekly  telephone surveillance calls to the legally  acceptable representative to 
determine if there have been an y changes in the participant’s health and if any  health care 
visits have occurred in the last week. If the answer is affirmative, then sites will further 
inquire if an yof the following symptoms of ARI have occurred: 
•Runny  or stuffy nose 
•Cough 
•Fever/feverishness 
•Trouble feeding 
•Noisy breathing (respiratory  tract congestion)
•Difficulty  or labored breathing 
•Wheezing 
•Chest wall in- drawing 
If any 2 or more of these sy mptoms have occurred for at least 2 days duration and the 
symptoms are consistent with ARI ,or if an y of the ARI s ymptoms a re of concern to the 
investigator, regardless of duration, a site visit for RSV assessment should be arranged as 
described in Section 8.8.4 .
Legally Acceptable Representative -reported Respiratory Symptoms
In addition to the sites conducting weekl y RSV surveillance telephone calls, the legally 
acceptable representatives will be instructed to phone the site to report respiratory  symptoms 
that have occurred for at least 2 day s duration. If 2 or more respirator ysymptoms have 
occurred for at least 2 days duration and the s ymptoms are consistent with ARI , or if an y of 
the ARI  symptoms are of concern to the investigator, regardless of duration, a site visit for 
RSV assessment should be arranged as described in Section8.8.4.
Unscheduled Visit for RSV Assessment
If ARI is suspected ( during surveillance and/or s ymptoms collection) , the participant should 
be assessed at the study  site as soon as is feasible and no later than 8 day s after the legally  
acceptable representative’s initial contact . The unscheduled visit for RSV assessment should 
occur no later than 10 days after s ymptom onset. ARI is defined as 2 or more of the

symptoms listed in Section 8.8.2 having occurred for at least 2 day s duration, or if in the 
opinion of the investigator, the sy mptoms are consistent with ARI , regardless of duration.
A phy sical exam (including heart rate, respiratory  rate, O 2%, and temperature) will be 
performed to confirm if any  of the following signs and s ymptoms of lower respiratory  tract 
infection (LRI) are present: 
•Decreased O 2saturation (<95% on room air at sea level or <92% on room air at 
≥1800 meters)
•Wheezing , chest wall in- drawing ,or difficulty  breathing
•Rales and crackles, rhonchi or coarse brea th sounds, or decreased breath sounds on 
respiratory  exam
RSV -associated LRI is defined as the presence of any  of these s ymptoms, with RSV detected 
by RT-PCR.
RSV -associated outpatient L RI is defined as above, for a participant seen in an outpatient 
clinic /doctor’s office, emergency  department, or urgent care center.
Following careful evaluation of signs and s ymptoms of ARI /LRI, the study  investigator 
should determine if further triage or evaluation is needed, consistent with the standard of 
care, and in conjunction with the participant’s primary  physician (if applicable).
RSV -associated hospitalization is defined as hospital admission for RSV or new onset of 
respiratory  illness during a hospital admission with RSV detected b y RT -PCR.
Non- serious respiratory AEs confirmed during the unscheduled visit for RSV assessment will 
be recorded on the AEs eCRF, as outlined in the SoA for Respiratory  AEs Collection. Any  
other AEs/SAEs will continue to be reviewed and recorded as outlined in the SoA for 
AE/SAE Review. If a participant is unable to attend a study  visit due to respiratory -
associated hospitalization, study  participant’s legally  acceptable representative should obtain 
hospitalization medical summary  and schedule a visit with the study  site as soon as possibl e 
after hospital discharge. If respiratory s ymptoms are suggestive of RSV infection, a nasal 
swab should be collected for RT-PCR testing if within 4 weeks of infection sy mptoms.
Nasal Swab for Respiratory Virus Infection Determination
If the investigator confirms that 2 or more of the sy mptoms listed in Section 8.8.2 have 
occurred for 2 days or more, or if an y of the ARI sy mptoms are of concern, a nasophary ngeal 
swab should be obtained for respiratory  virus detection by  RT-PCR. Nasal sw ab will be 
performed at the unscheduled visit for RSV assessment and anal yzedregardless of the
physical exam findings and regardless of the participant’s intervention assignment (MK-1654 
orplacebo )orpanel (A, B, C, D, or E) . The purpose is to estimate the incidence of ARI, 
including RSV, influenza, and hMPV infection, and help to determine the infectious cause of 
the ARI  and the relative proportion of RSV A and B infections in the target infant

prior to the administration of study  drug may  be rescheduled.
Discontinued Participants Continuing to be Monitored in the Study and Post -
study Visit
The investigator o r stud y coordinator must notify the Sponsor when a participant has been 
discontinued/withdrawn from the study . If a participant discontinues for any reason at an y 
time during the course of the study , the participant’s legally  acceptable representative may be 
asked to bring the participant back to the study  site (or be contacted) for a post -study  visit 
(approximately  365 days post-dose for Panels A through C, D1, and E1, and 545 day s post -
dose for Panels D2 andE2) to have the applicable procedures conducted. However, the 
investigator may  decide to perform the post -study  procedures at the time of discontinuation 
or as soon as possible after discontinuation. If the post -study  visit occurs prior to Day  365
(Panels A through C , D1, and E1 /Day 545 (Panels D 2andE2), the investigator should 
perform a follow -up telephone call on Day 365/545 to determine if an y AEs have occurred 
since the post -study  visit .

Pharmacokinetic 
Analy sesSeparatel y for each PK parameter of interest (AUC 0-inf, Cmax, 
C7day s, C14day s, C90day s, C150day s, and C365day s), 
individual values at each dose level will be natural log -
transformed and evaluated with a linear effects model containing 
a fixed effect for dose. Ninety -five percent confidence intervals 
(CI) for the least squares means for each dose will be constructed 
on the natural log scale and will reference a t- distribution. 
Exponentiating the least -squares means and lower and upper 
limits of these CI s will y ield estimates for the population 
geometric means (GM) and CIs about the GMs on the original 
scale.
The posterior distribution of the natural log mean C150day s will 
be calculated for each dose using the estimated mean and 
standard deviation from the above model and using a non -
informative prior. The PostPr (true GM C150day s ≥7.5µg/m L| 
data) will be computed for each dose.

Analy sesSafety  parameters will be summarized via descriptive statistics.
Interim Anal yses Interim anal yses of safety  and available PK data will be 
performed for making dose escalation decisions between P anels 
Aand B and Panels Band C. 
The decision to dose escalate between Panels C and D in pre -
term infants and between Panel C in pre -term infants and Panel E 
in full -term infants , and on the dose level (s)in Panel s Dand E
(up to100 mg), will be made in a nsiDMC meeting based on 
review of safet y and PK data.
An interim anal ysis of safety  and PK data will be performed 
when all evaluable pre -term infant participants in Panels A and B 
and at least 10 pre -term infant participan tsin Panel Chave 
completed their Day  150 visit . Available safet y and PK data from 
Panel D and Panel E will be included in this anal ysis. The

Analysis Pop ulations
PK Analysis Populations
The Per -Protocol (PP) population will be used for the anal ysis of PK data in this study . The 
PP population consists of all randomized participants with exclusions for important
deviations from the protocol that may  substant ially affect the results of the PK endpoints. 
Deviations that may  result in the exclusion of a participant from the PP population for all PK 
analyses include:
•Failure to receive study  intervention at Day  1,
•Receipt of prohibited medication or prohibited va ccine prior to stud y intervention , and
•Missing PK results.
The final determination on important protocol deviations, and thereb y the composition of the 
PP population, will be made prior to the final unblinding of the database and will be 
documented in a se parate memo. Participants will be included in the intervention group for 
the treatment actually  received for the anal ysis of PK data using the PP population.
Safety Analysis Populations
The All Participants as Treated (APaT) population will be used for the analy sis of safet y data 
in this study . The APaT population consists of all randomized participants who received 
study  intervention. Participants will be included in the group corresponding to the clinical 
material they  actually  received for the anal ysis of safet y data using the APaT population. For 
most participants this will be the group to which they are randomized. Participants who 
receive incorrect clinical material will be included in the group corresponding to the clinical 
material actually  received.
Statistical Methods
For all analy ses, data will be examined for departures from the assumptions of the statistical 
model(s) as appropriate; eg, heteroscedasticit y, non -normality  of the error terms. 
Distribution -free methods may  be used if a serious depart ure from the assumptions of the 
models(s) is observed, or suitable data transformations may  be applied.
Statistical Methods for Pharmacokinetic Analyses
Due to the sparse PK sampling in this study , population PK modeling will be used to 
estimate the PK par ameters AUC 0-inf, Cmax, Tmax, and t 1/2. Population PK modeling may also 
be used to estimate the concentrations at the time points where all participants are not being 
sampled. For the summaries of the PK data, PK data from the pre -term infant panels and full-
term infant panel will be combined for the anal ysis if the full -term infant panel receives the

same dose as one of the pre -term infant panels. PK sample anal ysis will not be conducted in 
participants who receive placebo.
Model -Based PK Summary
Separatel y for each PK parameter of interest (AUC 0-inf, Cmax, C7day s, C14days, C90day s, 
C150day s, and C365day s), individual values at each dose level will be natural log-
transformed and evaluated with a linear effects model containing a fixed effect for dose. 
Ninety- five percent CI sfor the least squares means for each dose will be constructed on the 
natural log scale and will reference a t -distribution. Exponentiating the least -squares means 
and lower and upper limits of these CI s will y ield estimates for the population GMs and CI s 
about the GM s on the original scale.
The posterior distribution of the natural log mean C150day s will be calculated for each dose 
using the estimated mean and standard deviation from the above model and using a non-
informative prior. The PostPr (true GM C150day s ≥7.5µg/m L| data) will be computed for 
each dose.
Additionally , the proportion of participants with C150day s >7.5µg/m Lwill be summarized 
for each dose. All PK parameters and the number of part icipants with C150day s >7.5µg/m L
will be summarized by  dose and body  weight group at time of administration of MK -1654 
(ie, 2 to 5 kg and >5 kg). In addition ,the relationship between PK parameters and bod y 
weight will be assessed graphicall y.
Dose Proportionality  for PK
An exploratory  anal ysis will be conducted to preliminarily  assess dose proportionality  of 
MK-1654 for each PK parameter of interest separately  (AUC 0-inf, Cmax, C150days, and 
C365day s). Separately  for each naturall y log -transformed PK parameter, a linear model with 
ln (dose) as a covariate will be used to estimate the overall slope. A plot of the observed PK 
data versus dose will be provided along with an overall estimated regression line on the raw 
scale and a 95% Schéffe confidence band. Dose proportionality  of the PK parameters may  
also be assessed using dose on the linear and ordinal scales as a covariate.
Descriptive Statistics for PK
Individual values will be listed for each PK parameter (AUC 0-inf, Cmax, C7days, C 14day s, 
C90day s, C150day s, C365day s, T maxand t 1/2) by dose and panel, and the following (non-
model -based) descriptive statistics will be provided: N (number of participants with non-
missing data), arithmetic mean, standard deviation, arithmetic percent CV (calculated as 
100x standard deviation/arithmetic mean), median, minimum, maximum, GM, and 
geometric percent CV (calculated as 100 x sqrt(exp(s2) -1), where s2 is the observed 
variance on the natural log -scale).

Anti-drugAntibodies (ADA s
The proportion of patients who develop ADAs and/or the ADA titers will be summarized at 
each dose level and time point. The distribution of positive titers will be examined 
graphicall y for each dose level and time point. The association between ADA positivity  
and/or titers and PK parame ters will be evaluated for each dose at the time points wh ere both 
results are available.
Statistical Methods for Safety Analyses
Safety  data from participants who receive placebo will be pooled across the panels for the 
safet y summaries. If the same dose of MK -1654 is administered in more than one panel, 
those panels will be pooled for the safet y summaries. Summary  statistics and plots will be 
generated for VS as well as for change from baseline, as deemed clinicall y appropriate. 
Depending on the safet y parameter, the difference from baseline will either be computed on 
the original scale (raw change from baseline) or on the log scale and back -transformed for 
reporting (percent change from baseline).
Safety  and tolerability  will be assessed b y clinical revie w of all relevant parameters including 
adverse events. Pat ient-reported outcomes will include temperature and AEs reported in the 
electronic diary  card.
Descriptive summaries (point estimates) by  MK-1654 dose group and placebo will be 
provided for all safet y parameters. In addition, within -group 95% CI s (based on the exact 
binomial method proposed by Clopper and Pearson [Clopper, C. J. and Pearson, E. S. 1934] ) 
will be provided for the following safety endpoints for each MK -1654 dose group and 
placebo: 
•The proportion of participants with elevated temperature (≥102.2°F [ 39.0°C ] rectal or 
≥101.7 °F [38.7 °C] axilla ry equivalent ) from Day  1 through Day 5post-dose; 
•The proportion of participants with solicited sy stemic AEs (irritability , drowsiness, fever,

•The proportion of participants with any AE, a drug -related AE, a SAE, a deat h, an AE 
which is both drug- related and serious, andan AE which leads to discontinuation.
The proportion of participants with specific AEs or S ystem Organ Classe s will be 
summarized using point estimates only .For Panels C, D ,and E where MK -1654 will be 
administered as 2 divided- dose IM injections, the injection -site AEs will be summarized 
separately  for each injection site and combined across the 2 injection sites.
Interim Analyses
Interim anal yses of safety  and PK data will be performed for making dose escalation 
decisions between the panels. The decision to escalate the dose between Panels A and B and 
Panels B and C will be made based on review of :1) available safet y data through at least 
Day 14 for at least 50% of participants in the previous panel(s) ;and 2) available PK data 
from the previous panel(s). Ongoing safet y monitoring and PK anal yses will continue 
throughout Panels A, B, and C.
The decision to dose escalate between Panels C and D in pre -term infants and between
Panel C in pre -term infants and Panel E in full -term infants, and on the dose level (s)in 
Panels D and E (up to 100 mg), will be made in a nsiDMC m eeting based on review of : 
1)available safet y data through at least Day 14 from Panels A, B, and C ;2)PK data through 
Day 90 for evaluable participants in Panel A and PK data through Day 30 for at least 50% of 
evaluable participants in Panel B; and 3) available PK data from Panel C. 
An interim anal ysisof safety  and PK data will be performed when all eva luable pre -term 
infant participants from Panels A and B and at least 10 pre -term infant participants from 
Panel C have completed their Day  150 visit. Available safety  and PK data from Panel sD and  
E will be included in this anal ysis. Group-level summaries will be reviewed by  the S ponsor 
study team in order to make scientific decisions for future studies. 
Multiplicity
Since there are no formal hy pothesis tests in this study , no adjustment will be made for 
multiplicity .
Sample Size and Power Calculations
Sample Size and Power for Safety Analyses
The probability  of observing at least one SAE in this study  depends on the number of 
participants dosed and the underl ying percentage of participants with a SAE in the study  
population. Calculations below assume that 100% of the randomized participants will be 
evaluable for safety analyses. There is an 80% chance of observing at least 1SAE among 
144 participants in an y MK-1654 dose group if the underl ying incidence of a SAE is 1.2% 
(1of every  83 parti cipants receiving MK -1654). There is a 50% chance of observing at least 
one SAE among 144 participants in any  MK-1654 dose group if the underly ing incidence of 
a SAE is 0.5% (1 of every 200 participants receiving MK -1654). If no SAEs are observed

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:002-04  
MK-1654 -002-04FINAL PROTOCOL 30-JUL-2020
among the 144 participants in any  MK-1654 dose group, this study  will provide 97.5% 
confidence that the underly ing percentage of participants with a SAE is <2.5% (1 in every  
40participants) in an y MK-1654 dose group.
Sample Size and Power for Pharmacokinetic Analy ses
An estimate of variability was obtained from the available data from Study  P001 . The largest 
variability  computed for any  PK parameter in that study  was 0.45 (standard deviation on 
natural log scale). Since the variability  in the PK of pre -term and ful l-term infants is expected 
to be larger than the variability  in health y adults, the log scale standard deviation was 
assumed to be 1 and 1.5 for computing the precision around the estimate of the GM 
C150day s.
Assuming that there are 27 out of 32 evaluable participants (85% evaluability  rate) on 
MK-1654 in each of Panels B, D, and E, at Day  150, the 95% CI s for various hy pothetical 
GM C150day s and natural log scale standard deviation estimates are display ed in Table 3.

10.SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATION S
Appendix 1: Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations
Code of Conduct for Clinical Trials
Merck Sharp and Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. (MSD)
Code of Conduct for Interventional Clinical Trials
I. Introduction
A. Purpose
MSD, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our 
products. As such, we are committed to designing, implementing, conducting, analyzing ,and reporting these trials 
in compliance with the highest ethical and scientific standards. Protection of participant s inclinical trials is the 
overriding concern in the design and conduct of clinical trials . In all cases, M SD clinical trials will be con ducted 
in compliance with local and/or national regulations , and International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical 
Practice (ICH -GCP), and also in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.
B. Scope
Highest ethical and scientific standards shall be endorsed for all clinical interventional investigations sponsored by 
MSD irrespective of the party (parties) employed for their execution (e.g. , contract research organizations, 
collaborative research efforts ). This Code is not intended to apply to trials that are observational in nature, or 
which are retrospective. Further, this Code does not apply to investigator -initiated trials , which are not under the 
full control of M SD.
II. Scientific Issues
A. Trial Co nduct
1. Trial Design
Except for pilot or estimation trials, clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis -driven to assess safety, efficacy 
and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic indices of M SD or comparator products. Alternatively, M SD
may conduct outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpoint measures, or trials to 
determine patient preferences, etc.
The design (i .e., participant population, duration, statistical power) must be adequate to address the specific
purpose of the trial. P articipants must meet protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial. 
2. Site Selection
MSD selects investigative sites based on medical expertise, access to appropriate participants, adequacy of 
facilities and staff, previous performance in clinical trials, as well as budgetary considerations. Prior to trial 
initiation, sites are evaluated by M SD personnel (or individuals acting on behalf of MSD) to assess the ability 
to successfully conduct the trial.
3. Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity
Investigative t rial sites are monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol and Good Clinical Practice
(GCP). MSD reviews clinical data for accuracy, completeness, and consistency. Data are verified versus 
source documentation according to standard operating procedures. Per M SD policies and procedures, if fraud, 
scientific/research misconduct or serious GCP -non-compliance is suspected, the issues are investigated. 
087XXP
PRODUCT: MK-1654 90
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:002-04  
MK-1654 -002-04FINAL PROTOCOL 30-JUL-2020
When necessary, the clinical site will be closed, the responsible regu latory authorities and ethics review 
committees notified .
B. Publication and Authorship
Regardless of trial outcome, MSD commits to publish the primary and secondary results of its registered trials of 
marketed products in which treatment is assigned, according to the pre -specified plans for data analysis. To the 
extent scientifically appropriate, M SDseeks to publish the results of other analyses it conducts that are important 
to patients, physicians, and payers . Some early phase or pilot trials are intend ed to be hypothesis -generating rather 
than hypothesis testing ; in such cases, publication of results may not be appropriate since the trial may be 
underpowered and the analyses complicated by statistical issues such as multiplicity.
MSD’s policy on authors hip is consistent with the re commendations published by the International Committee of 
Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). In summary, authorship should reflect significant contribution to the design and 
conduct of the trial, performance or interpretation of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript. All named 
authors must be able to defend the trial results and conclusions. M SD funding of a trial will be acknowledged in 
publications.
III. Participant Protection
A. Regulatory Authority and Ethics Committee Review (Institutional Review Board [I RB]/Independent Ethics 
Committee [IEC])
All protocols and protocol amendments will be submitted by MSD for regulatory authority 
acceptance/authorization prior to implementation of the trial or amendment, in compliance with local and/or 
national regulations.
The protocol, protocol amendment(s), informed consent form, investigator’s brochure, and other relevant trial 
documents must be reviewed and approved by an IRB/IEC before bein g implemented at each site, in compliance 
with local and/or national regulations. Changes to the protocol that are required urgently to eliminate an 
immediate hazard and to protect participant safety may be enacted in anticipation of ethics committee appro val.  
MSD will inform regulatory authorities of such new measures to protect participant safety, in compliance with 
local and/or national regulations.
B. Safety
The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical trials is that participant welfare is of p rimary importance. 
Potential participants will be informed of the risks and benefits of, as well as alternatives to, trial participation. At 
a minimum, trial designs will take into account the local stand ard of care.
All participation in M SD clinical trial s is voluntary. Participants enter the trial only after informed consent is 
obtained . Participants may withdraw from a n MSD trial at any time, without any influence on their access to, or 
receipt of, medical care that may otherwise be available to them.
C. Confidentiality
MSD is committed to safeguarding participant confidentiality, to the greatest extent possible. Unless required by 
law, only the investigator, Sponsor ( or individuals acting on behalf of MSD ), ethics committee, and/or regulatory 
authorities will have access to confidential medical records t hat might identify the participant by name.
D. Genomic Research
Genomic research will only be conducted in accordance with a protocol and informed consent authorized by an 
ethics c ommittee.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:002-04  
MK-1654 -002-04FINAL PROTOCOL 30-JUL-2020
IV. Financial Considerations
A. Paym ents to Investigators
Clinical trials are time -and labor -intensive. It is M SD’s policy to compensate investigators (or the sponsoring 
institution) in a fair manner for the work performed in support of M SD trials. M SD does n ot pay incentives to 
enroll participants in its trials. However, when enrollment is particularly challenging, additional payments may be 
made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts.
MSD does not pay for participant referrals. However, MSDmay compensate referring physicians for time spent 
on chart review and medical evaluation to identify potentially eligible participants.
B. Clinical Research Funding
Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by M SD,and that the investigator or sponsoring 
institution is being paid or provided a grant for performing the trial. However, the local ethics committee may 
wish to alter the wording of the disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution. As 
noted above, all publications resulting from M SD trials will indicate M SD as a source of funding.
C. Funding for Travel and Other Requests
Funding of travel by investigators and support staff (e .g., to scientific meetings, investigator meetings, etc.) will be 
consistent with local guidelines and practices .
V. Investigator Commit ment
Investigators will be expected to review M SD’s Code of Conduct as an appendix to the trial protocol, and in signing the 
protocol, agree to support these et hical and scientific standards .
Financial Disclosure
Financial Disclosure requirements are outlined in the US Food and Drug Administration 
Regulations, Financial Disclosure b y Clinical I nvestigators (21 CFR Part 54). I t is the 
Sponsor's responsibility  to determine, based on these regulations, whether a request for 
Financial Disclosure information is required. It is the investigator's/subinvestigator's 
responsibility  to comply  with any  such request.
The investigator/subinvestigator(s) agree, if requested by  the Sponsor in accordance with 21 
CFR Part 54, to provide his/her financial interests in and/or arrangements with the Sponsor to 
allow for the submission of complete and accurate certification and disclosure statements. 
The investigator/subinvestigator(s) further ag ree to provide this information on a 
Certification/Disclosure Form, commonly  known as a financial disclosure form, provided b y 
the Sponsor. The investigator/subinvestigator(s) also consent to the transmission of this 
information to the Sponsor in the Unite d States for these purposes. This may  involve the 
transmission of information to countries that do not have laws protecting personal data.
Data Protection
Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by the Sponsor. An y participant records or 
dataset s that are transferred to the Sponsor will contain the identifier only; participant names 
or an y information that would make the participant identifiable will not be transferred.

intervention and for dose selection (escalation) per Section 6.6 and the Dose Escalation 
Diagram in Section 1.2, as described in the detailed monitoring guidelines . The siDMC will 
determine whether the study  should continue (or other modifications, prespecified or 
otherwise, should be made) according to the protocol, consideri ng the overall risk and benefit 
to study  participants. The siDMC will also make recommendations to the Sponsor protocol 
team regarding steps to ensure both participant safety  and the continued ethical integrity  of 
the study .
Specific details regarding resp onsibilities of the siDMC will be described in a separate 
charter that is reviewed and approved b y the siDMC.
Publication Policy
The results of this study  may  be published or presented at scientific meetings. The Sponsor 
will comply  with the requirements f or publication of study  results. I n accordance with 
standard editorial and ethical practice, the Sponsor will generall y support publication of 
multicenter studies only  in their entiret y and not as individual site data. I n this case, a 
coordinating investigator will be designated b y mutual agreement.
If publication activity  is not directed b y the Sponsor, the investigator agrees to submit all

Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
Definition of AE
AE definition
•An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally 
associated with the use of study  interventi on, whether or not considered related to the 
study  intervention.
•NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally  
associated with the use of a study  intervention.
•NOTE: For purposes of AE definition, study  intervention (also referred to as Sponsor’s 
product) includes an y pharmaceutical product, biological product, vaccine, device, 
diagnostic agent, or protocol specified procedure whether investiga tional (including 
placebo or active comparator product) or marketed, manufactured b y, licensed by, 
provided b y, or distributed by the Sponsor for human use in this study.
Events meeting the AE definition
•Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry, or urinaly sis) or 
other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinicall y significant in the medical 
and scientific judgment of the investigator.
•Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
•New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y intervention administration even 
though it may  have been present before the start of the study .
•Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
•Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
intervention or a concomitant medication.
•For all reports of overdose (whether accidental or intentional) with an associated AE, the 
AE term should reflect the clinical s ymptoms or abnormal test result. An overdose 
without any  associated clinical sy mptoms or abnormal laboratory  results is reported using 
the terminology  “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:002-04  
MK-1654 -002-04FINAL PROTOCOL 30-JUL-2020
Events NOT meeting the AE d efinition
•Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscop y, appendectom y): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
•Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
•Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study  that do not worsen.
•Surgery  planned prior to informed consent to treat a pre -existing condition that has not 
worsened.
•Refe r to Section 8.4.6 for protocol -specific exceptions.
Definition of SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met.
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
•The term “ life-threatening ”in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which h ypothetically  might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
•Hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay, even 
if the hospitalization is a precautionary  measure for continued observation. (Note: 
Hospitalization for an elective procedure to treat a pre -existing condition that has not 
worsened is not an SAE. A pre -existing conditio n is a clinical condition that is 
diagnosed prior to the use of an MSD product and is documented in the participant’s 
medical history .
d.Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•The term disability  means a substantial disruption of a person ’s ability  to conduct 
normal life functions.

PRODUCT: MK-1654 99
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:002-04  
MK-1654 -002-04FINAL PROTOCOL 30-JUL-2020
•This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) that may  interfere with or prevent 
every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
•In offspring of participant taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis.
f.Other important medical events
•Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may  
jeopa rdize the participant or may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 
of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually  be 
considered serious.
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in 
an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse.
Additional Events Reported
Additional events that require r eporting
In addition to the above criteria, AEs meeting either of the below criteria, although not 
serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the Sponsor.
•Is a cancer
•Is associated with an overdose
Recording AE and SAE
AE and SAE r ecording
•When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility  of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory , and diagnostics reports) related to 
the event.
•The investigator will record all relevant AE/SAE information on the AE 
CRFs /worksheets at each examination.

PRODUCT: MK-1654 100
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:002-04  
MK-1654 -002-04FINAL PROTOCOL 30-JUL-2020
•It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical 
records to the Sponsor in lieu of completion of the AE CRF page.
•There may  be instances when copies of medical records for certain ca ses are requested by  
the Sponsor. I n this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant 
number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records before submission to the 
Sponsor.
•The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. I n such cases, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.
Assessment of i ntensity
•An event is defined as “serious” when it meets a t least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, not when it is rated as severe.
•The investigator will make an assessment of intensity  for each AE and SAE (and other 
reportable safet y event) according to the NCI Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE), version 4.0.3. Any  AE that changes CTCAE grade over the course of a 
given episode will have each change of grade recorded on the AE CRFs/worksheets.
-Grade 1: Mild; as ymptomatic or mild sy mptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated
-Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limitin g 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily  living (ADL )
-Grade 3: Severe or medically  significant but not immedi ately  life-threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -
care ADL
-Grade 4: Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated
-Grade 5: Death related to AE
•The investigator will also make an as sessment of intensity  foreach AE and SAE (and 
other reportable safet y event) reported during the study and assign it to 1 of the following 
categories: 
-Mild: An event that is easily  tolerated b y the participant, causing awareness of 
symptoms, but easily  tolerated.
-Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort, definitely  acting like something 
is wrong.

PRODUCT: MK-1654 101
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:002-04  
MK-1654 -002-04FINAL PROTOCOL 30-JUL-2020
-Severe: An event that causes the participant to be extremely distressed or unable to do 
usual activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an 
SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AE 
and SAE can be assessed as severe.
•Injection site redness or swelling from the day of injection through Day 5 post -dose will 
be evaluated b y maximum s ize.
Assessment of c ausality
•Did the Sponsor’s product cause the AE?
•The determination of the likelihood that the Sponsor’s product caused the AE will be 
provided b y an investigator who is a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated 
initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causalit y noted on the AE 
form, ensures that a medically  qualified assessment of causalit y was done. This initialled 
document must be retained for the required regulatory  time frame. The criter ia below are 
intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a 
relationship between the test product and the AE based upon the available information.
•The following components are to be used to assess the relations hip between the 
Sponsor’s product and the AE; the greater the correlation with the components and 
their respective elements (in number and/or intensity ), the more likel y the Sponsor’s 
product caused the AE:
-Exposure: Is there evidence that the participant was actuall y exposed to the 
Sponsor’s product such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (diary , 
etc.), seroconversion or identification of vaccine virus in bodily  specimen?
-Time Course: Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the Sponsor’s product? I s the time of onset of the AE compatible 
with a vaccine -induced effect?
-Likely Cause: Is the AE not reasonabl y explained by  another etiology  such as 
underly ing disease, other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental factors?
-Rechallenge: Was the participant re -exposed to the Sponsor’s product in the study ?
-If yes, did the AE recur or worsen?
-If yes, this is a positive rechallenge.
-If no, this is a negative rechallenge.

PRODUCT: MK-1654 102
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:002-04  
MK-1654 -002-04FINAL PROTOCOL 30-JUL-2020
(Note: This criterion is not app licable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in death or permanent 
disability , or (2) the study  is a single -dose vaccine study ); or (3) Sponsor’s product(s) is/are 
used only  1 time.)
NOTE: IF A RECHALLENGE IS PL ANNED FOR AN AE THAT WAS SERI OUS AND 
MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE SPONSOR’S PRODUCT, OR I F RE -EXPOSURE 
TO THE SPONSOR’S PRODUCT POSES ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL SI GNIFICANT 
RISK TO THE PARTI CIPANT THEN THE RECHALLENGE MUST BE APPROVED I N 
ADVANCE BY THE SPONSOR CLINI CAL  DIRECTOR, AND IF REQUI RED, THE 
IRB/IEC.
-Consistency with study intervention profile: Is the clinical/pathological 
presentation of the AE consistent with previous knowledge regarding the Sponsor’s 
product or drug class pharmacology  or toxicology?
-The assessment of relationship will be reported on th e CRFs /worksheets by an 
investigator who is a qualified phy sician according to his/her best clinical judgment, 
including consideration of the above elements.
-Use the following scale of criteria as guidance (not all criteria must be present to be 
indicative of a Sponsor’s product relationship).
-Yes, there is a reasonable possibility  of Sponsor’s product relationship:
-There is evidence of exposure to the Sponsor’s product. The temporal sequence of the 
AE onset relative to the administration of the Sponsor’s product is reasonable. The 
AE is more likely  explained by  the Sponsor’s product than by another cause.
-No, there is not a reasonable possibility  of Sponsor’s product relationship:
-Participant did not receive the Sponsor’s product OR temporal sequence of th e AE 
onset relative to administration of the Sponsor’s product is not reasonable OR the AE 
is more likely  explained by  another cause than the Sponsor’s product. (Also entered 
for a participant with overdose without an associated AE.)
•For each AE/SAE, the i nvestigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causalit y.
•There may  be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial repo rt to the Sponsor. However, it is very  important 
that the investigator always make an assessment of causalit y for every event before the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor.
•The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality  in light of follow -up 
information and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality  assessment.

MK-1654 -002-04FINAL PROTOCOL 30-JUL-2020
The causality  assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regulatory  reporting 
requirements.
Follow -up of AE and SAE
•The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically  indicated or as requested b y Sponsor to 
elucidate the nature and/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include additional la boratory  tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.
•New or updated information will be recorded in the CRF.
•The investigator will submit any  updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hou rs of 
receipt of the information.
Reporting of AE s, SAE s, and Other Reportable Safety Events to the Sponsor
AE, SAE, and o ther reportable safety e vent reporting to Sponsor via electronic d ata 
collection t ool
•The primary  mechanism for reporting to the Sponsor will be the electronic data collection 
(EDC) tool.
•Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry guidelines (or 
equivalent).
•If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use 
the paper AE Re porting form.
•Reference Section 8.4.1 for reporting time requirements.
•The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as it becomes 
available.
•After the stud y is completed at a given site, the EDC tool will be taken off -line to prevent
the entry  of new data or changes to existing data.
•If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study  participant or receives updated data 
on a previousl y reported SAE after the EDC tool has been taken off -line, then the site can 
report this information on a paper SAE form or by telephone (see next section).
•Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator Stud y File Binder (or 
equivalent).

SAE reporting to the Sponsor via paper CRF
•If the EDC tool is not operational, facsimile transmission o r secure e -mail of the SAE 
paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this information to the Sponsor.
•In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by  
telephone is acceptable with a cop y of the SAE data collection tool s ent by  overnight 
mail or courier service.
•Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to 
complete and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting time frames.
•Contacts and instructions for SAE reporting and paper reporting procedures can be found 
in the Investigator Study  File Binder (or equivalent).

1.Definitions
a.Biomarker: A biological molecule found in blood, other bod y fluids, or tissues that is
asign of a normal or abnormal process or of a condition or disease. A biomarker may
be used to see how well the body responds to a treatment for a disease or condition .1
b.Pharmacogenomics: The investigation of variations of DNA and RNA characteristics 
as related to drug/vaccine response.2
c.Pharmacogenetics: A subset of pharmacogenomics, pharmacogenetics is the influence 
of variations in DNA sequence on drug/vaccine response.2
d.DNA: Deox yribonucleic acid.
e.RNA: Ribonucleic acid.
2. Scope of Future Biomedical Re search
The specimens consented and/or collected in this study  as outlined in Section 8. 9will be used 
in various experiments to understand:
•The biology  of how drugs/vaccines work
•Biomarkers responsible for how a drug/vaccine enters and is removed b y the bo dy
•Other pathway s drugs/vaccines may  interact with
•The biology  of disease
The specimen(s) may  be used for future assay  development and/or drug/vaccine 
development.
It is now well recognized that information obtained from studying and testing clinical 
speci mens offers unique opportunities to enhance our understanding of how individuals 
respond to drugs/vaccines, enhance our understanding of human disease and ultimately  
improve public health through development of novel treatments targeted to populations with
the greatest need. All specimens will be used b y the Sponsor or those working for or with the 
Sponsor.
3.Summary of Procedures for Future Biomedical Research
a.Participants for Enrollment
All participants enrolled in the clinical study  will be considered f or enrollment in future 
biomedical research.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:002-04  
MK-1654 -002-04FINAL PROTOCOL 30-JUL-2020
b.Informed Consent
Informed consent for specimens (ie, DNA, RNA, protein, etc.) will be obtained during 
screening for protocol enrollment from the participant’s legal ly acceptable representative , at 
a study  visit by  the investigator or his or her d esignate. Informed consent for future 
biomedical r esearch should be presented to the participant ’slegally  acceptable representative
on the visit designated in the SoA. If delay ed, present consent at next possible P articipant 
Visit. Consent forms signed by the participant ’s legall y acceptable representative will be kept 
at the clinical study  site under secure storage for regulatory  reasons.
A template of each stud y site’s approved informed consent will be stored in t he Sponsor’s 
clinical document repository .
c.eCRF Documentation for Future Biomedical Research Specimens
Documentat ion of participant consent for future biomedical r esearch will be captured in the 
eCRFs . Any specimens for which such an informed consent canno t be verified will be 
destroy ed.
d.Future Biomedical Research Specimen(s)
Collection of specimens for future biomedical r esearch will be performed as outlined in the 
SoA. I n general, if additional blood specimens are being collected for future biomedical 
research, these will usually  be obtained at a time when the participant is having blood drawn 
for other stud y purposes.
4.Confidential Participant Information for Future Biomedical Research
In order to optimize the resea rch that can be conducte d with future biomedical r esearch 
specimens, it is critical to link the participant’ sclinical information with future test results. In 
fact,little or no research can be conducted without connecting the clinical study  data to the 
specimen. The clinical da ta allow specific anal yses to be conducted. Knowing participant 
characteristics like gender, age, medical history  and treatment outcomes are critical to 
understanding clinical context of analy tical results.
To maintain privacy  of information collect ed from specimens obtained for future biomedical 
research, the Sponsor has developed secure policies and procedures. All specimens will be 
single -coded per ICH E15 guidelines as described below.
At the clinical study  site, unique codes will be placed on the futur e biomedical r esearch 
specimens. This code is a random number which does not contain an y personally identifying 
information embedded within it. The link (or key ) between participant identifiers and this 
unique code will be held at the study  site. No personal identifiers will appear on the specimen 
tube.

5.Biorepository Specimen Usage
Specimens obtained for the Sponsor will be used for anal yses using good scientific pra ctices. 
Analy ses utilizing the future biomedical r esearch specimens may  be performed by the 
Sponsor, or an additional third party (eg, a university  investigator) designated by  the 
Sponsor. The investigator conducting the analysis will follow the Sponsor’s privacy  and 
confidentiality  requirements. Any  contracted third -party analyses will conf orm to the specific 
scope o f anal ysis. Future biomedical r esearch specimens remaining with the third party  after 
specific anal ysis is performed will be reported to the Sponsor.
6.Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Research
Participants and/or a legally  acceptable representative may withdraw consent for future 
biomedical r esearch and ask that the participant’s biospecimens not be used for future 
biomedical r esearch. Participants and/or a legally  acceptable representative may withdraw 
consent at an y time b y contacting the principal investigator for the main study . If medical 
records for the main study are still available, the investigator will contact the Sponsor using 
the designated mailbox (clinical.specimen.management@merck.com). Subsequently , the 
participant's specimens will be flagged in the biorepository  and restricted to main study  use 
only. If specimens were collected from study participants specificall y for future biomedical 
research, these specimens will be removed from the biorepository  and destroy ed. 
Documentation will be sent to the investigator confirming withdrawal and/or destruction, if 
applicable. It is the responsibility  of the investigator to inform the participant of completion 
of the withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. Any anal yses in progress at the time of 
request for withdrawal/destruction or alread y performed prior to the request being received 
by the Sponsor will continue to be used as part of the overall research study  data and results. 
No new analy ses would be generated afte r the request is received.
In the event that the medical records for the main study  are no longer available (eg, if the 
investigator is no longer required b y regulatory authorities to retain the main study records) 
or the specimens have been completel y ano nymized, there will no longer be a link between 
the participant’s personal information and their specimens. In this situation, the request for 
withdrawal of consent and/or destruction cannot be processed.
7.Retention of Specimens
Future biomedical r esearc h specimens will be stored in the biorepository  for potential 
analysis for up to 20 y ears from the end of the main study . Specimens may  be stored for 
longer if a regulatory  or governmental authorit y has active questions that are being answered. 
In this spe cial circumstance, specimens will be stored until these questions have been 
adequatel y addressed.
Specimens from the study  site will be shipped to a central laboratory  and then shipped to the 
Sponsor -designated biorepository . If a central laboratory  is not utilized in a particular stud y, 
the study  site will ship directl y to the Sponsor -designated biorepository . The specimens will 
be stored under strict supervision in a limited access facility which operates to assure the 
integrit y of the specimens. Specimens will be destroyed according to Sponsor policies and 
procedures and this destruction will be documented in the biorepository  database.

8.Data Security
Databases containing specimen information and test results are accessible only  to the 
authorized Sponsor representatives and the designated study administrator research personnel 
and/or collaborators. Database user authentication is hig hly secure and is accomplished using 
network security  policies and practices based on international standards to protect against 
unauthorized access.
9.Reporting of Future Biomedical Research Data to Participants
No information obtained from exploratory  laboratory  studies will be reported to the 
participant, famil y, or physicians. Principle reasons not to inform or return results to the 
participant include: Lack of relevance to participant health, limitations of predictive 
capability , and concerns regardin g misinterpretation.
If important research findings are discovered, the Sponsor may  publish results, present results 
in national meetings, and make results accessible on a public website in order to rapidl y 
report this information to doctors and participan ts. Participants will not be identified by  name 
in any  published reports about this study  or in any other scientific publication or presentation.
10. Future Biomedical Research Study Population
Every  effort will be made to recruit all participants diagnose d and treated o n Sponsor clinical 
studies for f uture biomedical r esearch.
11.Risks Versus Benefits of Future Biomedical Research
For future biomedical research, risks to the participant have been minimized and are 
described in the Future Biomedical Resear ch informed consent.
The Sponsor has developed strict security, policies, and procedures to address participant 
data privacy  concerns. Data privacy  risks are largely  limited to rare situations involving 
possible breach of confidentiality . In this highl y unlikely  situation, there is risk that the 
information, like all medical information, may  be misused.
12.Questions
Any questions related to the future biomedical research should be e mailed directly  to 
clinical.specimen.management@merck.com.

2.0 TRIAL DE SIGN  
2.1 Trial Design  
This is a single -institution, prospective phase II trial with an initial safety run -in to evaluate  
the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab combined with chemoradiotherapy 
and adjuvant pembrolizumab in patients with locally ad vanced esophageal and gastric 
cancers  (EGC). Chemor adiation therapy (45Gy in 25 fractions with concurrent, weekly 
carboplatin [AUC 2] and paclitaxel [50mg/m2 of BSA]) with three cycles of 
pembrolizumab will be administered as neoadjuvant therapy. These pat ients will also 
receive three cycles of adjuvant pembrolizumab after surgical resection (1). 
An initial safety run -in of 5 patients will be performed  to evaluate safety of concurrent 
pembrolizumab and chemo radiotherapy for EGC . If no more than 1 grade 3 + toxicity is  
definitely related to concurrent pembrolizumab and  observed within 30 days of the last 
dose of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab (i.e. cycle 3) for the fifth patient, then the study will

 continue to accrue .  In the event that more than 1 of  the first 5 patients has  a grade 3 + 
toxicity  definitely related to  concurrent pembrolizumab, then an additional five patients 
(total 10 patients) will be enrolled with close toxicity assessment. 
Enrolled patients  will receive  three doses of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab (200 mg 
administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks). The first dose of 
pembrolizumab will be administered approximately 14 days prior to initiating radiotherapy. The second dose will be a dministered three weeks later (week 1  +/- 1 week  of 
chemoradiation) . The third dose will be administered  3 weeks later  (week 4 +/ - 1 week of 
chemo radiotherapy ). Pembrolizumab will be given every 3 weeks and may be given at the 
same time as systemic therapy . All patients will receive radiation treatment ( 45Gy in 25 
fractions at 1.8 Gy/fraction) using image -guided radiation therapy  with concurrent , weekly 
carboplatin (AUC 2) and pacli taxel (50mg/m2 of BSA) . Restaging will be performed per 
standard of care app roximately 4 -8 weeks after completing chemoradiotherapy. R esection 
will be performed  approximately 6 -16 weeks after completing chemoradiotherapy  per 
standard of care . Postoperatively , three additional cycles of pembrolizumab (200 mg every 
3 weeks) will be administered as adjuvant therapy.  Timing will be at the discretion of the 
treating physician based on patient healing and recovery from any postoperative complications.  
Patients will be evaluated at least weekly during radiation treatment, every 3 -6 months for 
the first 2 years after treatment, and every 6 -12 months in years 3 to 5. PET/CT or CT 
chest/abdomen/pelvis (C/A/P)  will be performed at the time of these scheduled follow up 
visits to evaluate for local or distant tumor recurrence. Additional imaging will be performed if clinically  indicated. Adverse events will be recorded and graded according to 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 (2).

4.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONALE  
4.1 Background 
4.1.1 Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background 
The importance of intact functions of immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of  
neoplastic transformation has been known for decades.  Accumulating evidence shows a 
correlation between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorabl e 
prognosis in various malignancies.  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the 
ratio of CD8+ effector T -cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells seems to correlate with 
improved prognosis and long- term survival in many solid tumors.  
The PD -1 receptor -ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress 
immune control.  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated 
T-cells under healthy conditions, is to down- modulate unwanted or excessive immune 
responses, including autoimmune reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by the gene Pdcd1) is an Ig 
superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 which has been shown to negatively 
regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2).  
The structure o f murine PD -1 has been resolved.  PD -1 and family members are type I 
transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable -type (V -type) domain responsible 
for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling molecule s.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -
based switch motif (ITSM).  Following T -cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine 
phosphatases SHP -1 and SHP -2 to the ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to 
the dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3ζ, PKCθ and ZAP70 which are involved in the CD3 T -cell signaling cascade.  The mechanism by which PD -1 down 
modulates T -cell responses is similar to, but distinct from that of CTLA -4 as both 
molecules regulate an overlapping set of signaling proteins.  PD -1 was shown to be 
expressed on activated lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, 
T regs and Nat ural Killer cells.  Expression has also been shown during thymic 
development on CD4- CD8 - (double negative) T -cells as well as subsets of macrophages 
and dendritic cells.  The ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are constitutively expressed 
or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non- hematopoietic tissues as well as 
in various tumors.  Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing both IgV - 
and IgC -like domains in the extracellular region and contain short cytoplasmic regions with  
 
PROCEED v_ 05.05.20 21                                                                                                                     pg. 10 
 no known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD -1 ligand to PD -1 inhibits T -cell 
activation triggered through the T -cell receptor.  PD -L1 is expressed at low levels on 
various non- hematopoietic tissues, most notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD -L2 
protein is only detectably expressed on antigen- presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or 
chronic inflammatory environments.  PD -L2 is thought to control immune T -cell activation 
in lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T -cell fun ction in 
peripheral tissues.  Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of 
cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T -cell inhibitor.  PD -1 has 
been suggested to regulate tumor -specific T -cell expansion in subject s with melanoma 
(MEL).  This suggests that the PD -1/PD- L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune 
evasion and should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. 
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of 
the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD -1 and its 
ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2.  KeytrudaTM (pembrolizumab) has recently been approved in 
the United Stated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following ipilumumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. It is also approved in the treatment of metastatic non -small cell lung 
cancer and recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancers.  
 4.1.2 Preclinical and Clinical Trial Data  
4.2 Rationale 
4.2.1 Rationale for the Trial and Selected Subject Population  
EGC is the fourth most common cancer with incidence of 1 million people 
worldwide.(4)  In the United States nearl y 42,000 patients are diagnosed with esophageal or 
gastric malignancies. (5) For the individuals who present w ith locally advanced , resectable, 
non-metastatic disease the mainstay of treatment involves a combination of neoadjuvant 
chemoradiation followed by surgery. With neoadjuvant treatment the current pCR  is 
approximately 30%. Long term survival in patients receiving  neoadjuvant chemoradiation 
with carboplatin/paclitaxel and surgery is median 49.4 months and corresponding 5 year survival of 47% (1) Data suggests that long term outcomes in patients who achieve a pCR 
is significantly higher than non-responders. (6) We hypothesize that concurrent 
administration of pembrolizumab with chemoradiation for locally advanced EGC  will 
enhance local tumor response and activate the immune system to eliminate  occult 
micrometastatic disease . 
Antibodies targeting immune checkpoints, including the anti -PD-1 antibody 
pembrolizumab, have induced durable responses in patients with metastatic cancers of many types (7 -19).  Furthermore, anti -PD-1 antibodies are generally well tolerated , with 
therapies targeting the PD -1 pathway associated with less toxicity  than anti -CTLA -4 
antibodies. Experience with  immune checkpoint blockade in EGC  is limited . At the 2014 
European Society of Medical Oncology meeting recent data from Japan evaluated patients with recurrent or metastatic esophago -gastric adenocarcinomas for PD -1 expression, and if 
positive, enrollment on a Phase 1b study with pembrolizumab. Statistically significant

 associations between PD -1 expression and progression free survival (PFS, p=0.032) and 
objective response rate (ORR, P=0.071) were seen. These results were achieved with most 
common adverse events being fatigue and hypothyroidism. (20) In light of these data, Phase 
II and III studies for advanced gastric cancer are ongoing.  
To date, no clinical trials have examined combined anti -PD-1 therapy and chemo radiation 
treatment for  EGC .  Data from a phase I clinical trial in metastatic melanoma and several 
preclinical studies in various tumor models indicate that radiotherapy enhances the therapeutic effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors  (21-25).  Radiation therapy may 
augment the anti -tumor immune response by inducing exposure of new tumor antigens 
through cross presentation, upregulating MHC -I expression, stimulating chemokines that 
recruit cytotoxic T -cells, and upregulating death receptors which promote cytotoxic T -cell 
activity (26).  Furthermore, isolated case reports of the abscopal effect, in which localized 
radiation treatment triggers distant tumor regression through a systemic immune -mediated 
response, suggest a synergistic interplay between radiotherapy and the immune system (27, 28). 
When immune checkpoint inhibitors are administered in the absence of radiation therapy, 
tumor mutational load correlates with the efficacy of immunotherapy (15, 29, 30) . We 
hypothesize that immune stimulation by radiothe rapy will trigger a response to immune 
checkpoint blockade that will enhance local tumor response and eradicate micro -
metastases.  
4.2.2 Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification  
An open- label Phase I trial (Protocol 001)  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] is being conducted to evaluate 
the safety and clinical activity of single agent MK -3475 ( Pembrolizumab).  The dose 
escalation portion of this trial evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose- limiting toxicities were observed.  This first in 
human study of MK -3475 ( Pembrolizumab)  showed evidence of target engagement and 
objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 
mg/kg Q2W).  No MTD has been identified to date.  10.0 mg/kg Q2W, the highest dose tested in PN001, will be the dose and schedule utilized in Cohorts A, B, C and D of this protocol to test for initial tumor activity.  Recent data from other clinical studies within the MK-3475 program has shown that a lower dose of MK -3475 ( Pembrolizumab)  and a less 
frequent schedule may be sufficient for target engagement and clinical activity.  
 PK data analysis of MK -3475( Pembrolizumab)  administere d Q2W and Q3W showed slow 
systemic clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half -life (refer to IB).  
Pharmacodynamic data (IL -2 release assay) suggested that peripheral target engagement is 
durable (>21 days).  This early PK and pharmacodynam ic data provides scientific rationale 
for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing schedule.  A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using serum concentration time data from 476 patients. Within the resulting population PK model, clearance and volume  
parameters of MK -3475 ( Pembrolizumab)  were found to be dependent on body weight. 
 
PROCEED v_ 05.05.20 21                                                                                                                     pg. 12 
 The relationship between clearance and body weight, with an allometric exponent of 0.59, 
is within the range observed for other antibodies and would support both body weight normalized dosing or a fixed dose across all body weights.  MK -3475 ( Pembrolizumab)  
has been found to have a wide therapeutic range based on the melanoma indication.  The differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W  body 
weight based regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for MK -3475 ( Pembrolizumab) in the melanoma indication. The 
exposure margins are based on the notion of similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 5 -fold higher dose and 
exposure). The population PK evaluation revealed that there was no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC  and 
melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure between different indication settings.  
 The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of pembrolizumab in solid tumors is based on: 1) similar effica cy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed at 
either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure -response 
relationships of pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution behavior of pembrolizumab (as assessed by the population PK model) and 4) the assumption that the dynamics of pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary meaningfully with tumor type. 
The choice of the 2 00 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is 
based on simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab 
showing that the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are well tolerated and safe.  
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and to reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexity in the logistical chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage.  
4.2.2.1 Efficacy Endpoints 
pCR will be the primary  study endpoint and safety will be the secondary endpoint.  The 
rationale is that combined pembrolizumab and chemo radiotherapy will stimulate  an anti -
tumor immune response, leading to enhanced local tumor effect  and be well tolerated . With 
neoadjuvant treatment the pCR  is approximately 23% in patients with adenocarcinoma 
histology. (1) Data suggests that long ter m outcomes in patients who achieve a pCR is 
significantly better  than non-responders. (6)

Radiotherapy will be initiated within 14 days after the first dose of pembrolizumab. 
Radiation treatment will be administered at a dose of 1.8Gy/fraction to a total dose of 
45Gy.  Radiotherapy will be given with concurrent, weekly carboplatin (AUC 2) and 
paclitaxel ( 50mg/m2 of BSA)  as per standard of care . Three cycles of pembrolizumab will 
be admini stered prior to surgical resection. Pembrolizumab will be given every 3 weeks 
and may be given at the same time as systemic therapy.  Three cycles of adjuvant 
pembrolizumab will be administered  after surgery . Given the possibility of post -operative 
complica tions after neoadjuvant chemo radiotherapy and surgery for EGC , we anticipate 
variation in timing of adjuvant pembrolizumab based on physician judgment. 
5.2.1 Dose Selection/Modification  
5.2.1.1 Dose Selection  
The rationale for selection of doses to be used in this trial  is provided in Section 4.0 – 
Background and Rationale. Details on preparation and administration of pembrolizumab (MK -3475) are provided in 
the Merck Prescribing Information . 
5.2.1.2 Dose Modification (Escalation/Titration/Other)  
AEs associated with pembrolizumab  exposure, including coadministration with 
additional compounds, may represent an immunologic aetiology. These immune -related 
AEs (irAEs) may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of 
pembrolizumab/combination treatment an d may affect more than one body system 
simultaneously. Therefore, early recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to reduce complications.  Based on existing clinical study data, most irAEs were reversible and could be managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab/combination treatment, administration of corticosteroids and/or other supportive care. For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Additional procedures or tests such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, skin biopsy may be included as part of the evaluation. Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines for irAEs associated with pembrolizumab/combination treatment are provided in Table 4. 
See Section 5.6 for supportive care guidelines, including use of corticosteroids.

 5.2.1.3 Dose Modification Guidelines for Drug -Related Adverse Events  
Table 4 Dose Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Immune -related 
AEs Associated with Pembrolizumab  
General instructions:  
1. Severe and life -threatening irAE s should be treated with IV corticosteroids followed by oral steroids. 
Other immunosuppressive treatment should begin if the irAEs are not controlled by corticosteroids.  
2. Study intervention must be permanently discontinued if the irAE does not resolve or the 
corticosteroid dose is not ≤10 mg/day within 12 weeks of the last study intervention treatment.  
3. The corticosteroid taper should begin when the irAE is ≤ Grade 1 and continue at least 4  weeks.  
4. If study intervention has been withheld, study intervention ma y resume after the irAE decreased to 
≤ Grade  1 after corticosteroid taper.

 holidays). Subjects should be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the 
scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the PI. The reason for interruption should be documented in the patient's study record. 
 5.2.2 Timing of Dose Administration 
Trial treatment should be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all 
procedures/assessments have been completed as detailed on the Trial Flow Chart (Section 6.0).  Trial treatment may be administered up to 3 days before or after the scheduled Day 1 of each cycle due to administrative reasons.  
All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient ba sis. 
Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion every 3 weeks. However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of - 5 minutes 
and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min).  
The Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions for the preparation of the pembrolizumab infusion fluid and administration of infusion solution. 
5.2.3 Trial Blinding/Masking  
This is an open- label trial; therefore, the Sponsor , investigator and subject w ill know the 
treatment administered.  
5.3 Trial Treatment: Radiation Therapy  (Below are recommendations but at 
the discretion of the treating physician.).  
Image -guided radiation treatment (IGRT) is  recommended  for this study. 
5.3.1 Dose Specifications  
5.3.1.1 Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy 
Carboplatin (AUC 2) and paclitaxel ( 50mg/m2 of BSA)  will be given concurrent, week ly 
with radiation with plan for at least 4 total doses neoadjuvantly  per treating medical 
oncologist. Administration will be as per standard of care. 
5.3.1.2 Preoperative IGRT  
Either 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D -CRT) or intensity modulated radiation therapy 
(IMRT) /volumetric arc therapy (VMAT)  may be utilized. Recommendations for dose 
volume histogram (DVH) constraints for critical normal structures are at the discr etion of 
the treating physician but Section 5.35 provides recommended metrics. A prescription dose of 45Gy in 25 daily fractions will be prescribed with recommendation 
to cover 95% of the PTV.

 5.3.2 Technical Factors  
Megavoltage photon beams produced by linear a ccelerators with energies of ≥ 4 MV are 
permitted.  
Image guidance may be achieved using any one or more of the following techniques: 
• Orthogonal 2D kilovoltage (KV) and MV electronic images, e.g., ExacTrac; 
• Linear -accelerator mounted kV and MV conebeam CT i mages;  
• Linear -accelerator mounted MV CT images (e.g., Tomotherapy);  
 
Any questions regarding IGRT technology should be directed to the PI.  
 5.3.3 Localization, Simulation, and Immobilization 
Patients should be immobilized in stable and comfortable positions to a llow accurate 
repositioning from treatment to treatment and to prevent movement during treatments. A variety of immobilization devises may be utilized, including Alpha Cradle, indexed wingboard and vac-lock. Radiotherapy treatment plans will be generated af ter CT  
simulation. Ideally PET/CT simulation will be performed for radiation treatment planning. 
Respiratory motion assessment is recommended and if motion is greater than 1.5cm respiratory motion management is advised but at the discretion of the treating physician.  
5.3.4 Treatment Planning/Targ et Volumes  
The definition of volumes will be in accordance with the ICRU Report #62: Prescribing, recording and Reporting Photon Beam Therapy (supplement to ICRU Report #50). 
Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) :
  Gross tumor defined as the primary tumor in the 
esophagus/stomach and grossly involved regional lymph nodes. Clinical Target Volume (CTV) : Th
 e CTV is defined as a 2 -4cm superior and inferior 
expansion along the length of the esophagus and stomach and a 1- 1.5cm radial expansi on 
for the primary and nodal GTV . The superior and inferior expansion should follow the 
contour of the esophagus and stomach. The intent is to extend the margin along the length 
of the esophagus and stomach to provide a margin for coverage of the submucosa l 
extension of tumor. The celiac axis may be covered for tumors of the distal esophagus, GE junction or stomach. The internal target volumes (ITV) as assessed on the 4D -CT will be 
included in the CTV. Elective nodal coverage is at the discretion of the tre ating physician.  
Planning Target Volume (PTV) : In
 clude CTV and set up uncertainty . Typically PTV 
includes CTV plus 0.5- 1cm in all directions . 
Boost PTV : D efined as the GTV with expansion of 1-1.5cm.

Kidney  Combined kidneys  V20 ≤30%  
Spinal Cord  Spinal cord  Max 50Gy  
Liver  Liver  V30 
Mean  ≤33%  
21Gy 
 
5.3.6 Compliance Criteria  
Treatment interruptions should be minimized. Radiation t reatment breaks longer than 5 
days will be documented. If radiation treatme nt break is longer than 5 days there will be 
discussion with PI to consider taking the patient off study. If chemotherapy is held at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist, it will be documented but not counted as a treatment break  
 5.3.7 Chemor adiati on Therapy Adverse Events  
5.3.7.1 Acute Adverse Events  
Common chemo radiation adverse events include: anorexia/weight loss , constipation, 
diarrhea, esophagitis, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, dermatitis, hair thinning/alopecia, nerve 
damage, and reduction in blood counts. 
5.3.7.2 Long- term Adverse Events  
Possible long- term treatment adverse events include esophageal stenosis /stricture, 
difficulty maintaining weight, depressed blood counts, pneumonitis, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, myelopathy, renal dysfunction neces sitating dialysis, and bowel 
obstruction, perforation or bleeding.

 5.3.8 Surgical Evaluation 
A surgeon, radiation oncologist and medical oncologist must see any eligible patient prior 
to instituting preoperative therapy.  
Resection of the EGC  will occur following combined preoperative chemo radiation  and 
pembrolizumab after restaging imaging has confirmed no evidence of metastatic disease  
and patient is medically fit for surgery  as per standard of care. 
5.3.9 Postoperative Management  
Post-operative management is at the discretion of the surgical team per standard of care.  
 
5.3.10 Surgical Adverse Events  
Major wound complications, such as secondary operations, re -admissi ons, and/or invasive 
procedures will be collected  based on retrospective review of the patient’s electronic 
medical record .Constitution symptoms related to surgical recovery such as weight loss, 
nausea and vomiting, fatigue, post -operative pain, constipation caused by narcotic 
medication prescribed for pain management both during and after discharge from hospital, 
will not be captured. Anticipated surgical complications specifically, anastomic leak, 
fistula, chylothorax, pneumonia and pericardial effusion will be captured. 
5.4 Trea tment Arm  
An initial safety run -in of 5 patients will be pe rformed to evaluate safety of concurrent 
pembrolizumab and chemoradiotherapy for EGC. If no more than 1 grade 3 or higher  
toxicity is definitely related to concurrent pembrolizumab and  observed within 30 days of 
the last dose of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab (i.e. cycle 3) for the fifth patient, then the study will continue to accrue.  In the event that more than 1 of the first 5 patients has  a 
grade 3  or higher  toxicity definitely related to concurrent pembrolizumab, then an 
additional five patients (total 10 patients) will be enrolled with close toxicity assessment. If 
more than 2 grade 3  or higher  toxicities definitely related to concurrent pembrolizumab and 
chemoradiotherapy are observed  in the 10 patients, then the PI will consider that the safety

 Accrual: 38 patients with intent to have 30 evaluable patients (patients who complete 
neoadjuvant treatment and undergo resection) for the primary endpoint. 
5.5 Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited)  
Medications  or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be required.  The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the Merck C linical team.  The final decision on any supportive therapy 
or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the subject's pri mary physician.  
5.5.1 Acceptable Concomitant Medications  
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a subject’s welfare may be administered at the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the community standards of medical care. 
5.5.2 Prohibite d Concomitant Medications  
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapies during the screening and 
treatment p hase (including retreatment for post- complete response relapse) of this trial: 
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol 
• Investi gational agents other than pembrolizumab 
• Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and while participating in the trial.   Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, 
the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varic ella/zoster , yellow fever, rabies, BCG, 
and typhoid vaccine. 
Subjects who, in the assessment by the investigator, require the use of any of the aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial.  Subjects may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary.  
The Exclusion Criteria section describes other medications that are prohibited in this trial.  
Biological therapy  or immunotherapy will remain prohibited beyond the treatment phase 
unless the patient develops metastatic disease. There are no additional prohibited therapies during the post- treatment follow -up phase.  
5.6 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care  
5.6.1 Supportive Care Guidelines  for Pembrolizumab  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by the 
treating investigator.  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined below. Where appropriate, these

 guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with corticosteroids as well as 
additional anti -inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of 
corticosteroids. Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as 
symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care. The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab. 
Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator does 
not need to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined below). Refer to Section 5.2.1 for dose modification. 
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, 
or skin photography as part of evaluation of the event. 
• Pneumonitis : 
o For Grade 2 events , treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms 
improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued 
over no less than 4 weeks. 
o For Grade 3 -4 events , immediately treat with intravenous steroids.  
Administer additional anti- inflammatory measures, as needed.  
o Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged steroid administration
. 
• Diarrhea/Colitis : 
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus). 
o All subjects who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion.  For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea despite anti- diarrheals , consider GI consultation and 
endoscopy to confirm or rule out colitis. 
o For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis,  administer oral corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis, treat wi th intravenous steroids followed 
by high dose oral steroids. 
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
• Type 1 diabetes mellitus (if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) or ≥ Grade 3 Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic acidosis (DKA)  
 
PROCEED v_ 05.05.20 21                                                                                                                     pg. 26 
 o For T1DM  or Grade 3 -4 Hyperglycemia  
 Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes 
mellitus and for Grade 3 -4 hyperglycemia associated with metabo lic 
acidosis or ketonuria. 
 Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine ketones, glycosylated hemoglobin, and C-peptide. 
• Hypophysitis : 
o For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to 
Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered. 
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids 
followed by oral corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or 
less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
• Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism : 
Thyroid disorders can occu r at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for 
changes in thyroid funct ion (at the start of treatment and as indicated based on 
clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. TSH 
will be performed at baseline and prior  to administration of subsequent cycles of 
pembrolizumab as per institutional policy.  
o Grade 2  hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2 -4 hypothyroidism): 
 In hyperthyroidism, non- selective beta -blockers (e.g. propranolol) 
are suggested as initial therapy.  
 In hyp othyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with 
levothyroxine or liothyronine, is indicated per standard of care. 
o Grade 3 -4 hyperthyroidism 
 Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by oral corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
• Hepatic : 
o For Grade 2  events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until 
returned to baseline values (consider weekly).  
 Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with intravenous corticosteroids for 24 to 48 
hours.

 o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be 
started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
• Renal Failure or Nephritis : 
o For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no le ss than 4 weeks.  
• Management of Infusion Reactions : Signs and symptoms usually develop during 
or shortly after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of 
completion of infusion. 
Table 3 below  shows treatment guidelines for subjects wh o experience an infusion 
reaction associated with administration of pembrolizumab (MK -3475).

Increase monitoring of vital signs as medically indicated until the subject is deemed medically stable in the opinion of the investigator.  
If symptoms resolve within one hour of stopping drug infusion, the infusion may be restarted at  
50% of the original infusion rate (e.g., from 100 
mL/hr to 50 mL/hr).  Otherwise dosing will be 
held until symptoms resolve and the subject 
should be premedicated for the next scheduled 
dose.  
Subjects who develop Grade 2 toxicity despite 
adequate premedic ation should be

Subject is permanently discontinued from 
further trial treatment administration.  
Appropriate resuscitation equipment should be available in the room and a physician readily available during the period of dr ug 
administration.  
 
5.6.2 Supportive Care Guidelines for Chemoradiation  
• Corticosteroids will be administered as per standard of care for systemic therapy 
administration.  Subjects will be pre -medicated with  dexamethasone 8mg po the 
night before, the morning prior to each chemotherapy, and for 2 days after each 
chemotherapy. If a patient is allergic to dexamethasone, a steroid equivalent may be used at the discretion of the treating physician.  
Efforts will be made to minimize the use of corticosteroids during chemoradiation for symptomatic or supportive management. 
5.7 Diet/Activity/Other Considerations  
5.7.1 Diet 
Subjects should maintain a normal diet unless modifications are required to manage an AE such as diarrhea, nausea or vomiting. 
5.7.2 Contraception  
Pembrolizumab may have adverse effects o n a fetus in utero.  Furthermore, it is not known 
if pembrolizumab has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm. The Duke 
Contraception policy will be followed. 
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown r isks 
to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to 
participate in the study subjects of childbearing potential must adhere to the contraception requirement as per D uke policy. If there is any question that a subject o f childbearing 
potential will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that subject should not be entered into the study. 
5.7.3 Use in Pregnancy  
If a subject inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with pembrolizumab, the 
subject wi ll immediately be removed from the study.  The site will contact the subject at 
least monthly and document the subject’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated.  The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor and to Merck  
without delay and within 24 hours  to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to Merck if 
the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life-threatening complication to the mother or newborn). 
 
PROCEED v_ 05.05.20 21                                                                                                                     pg. 29 
 The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of 
the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor .   If a male 
subject impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed immediately and the pregnancy reported to the Sponsor and to Merck and followed as 
described above and in Section 7.2.2. 
5.7.4 Use in Nursing Women  
It is unknown whether pembrolizumab is excreted in human milk.  Since many drugs are 
excreted in hum an milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the 
nursing infant, subjects who are breast- feeding are not eligible for enrollment.  
5.8 Subject Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria  
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason  or be dropped from the  trial at 
the discretion of the PI should any untoward effect occur.  In addition, a subject may be 
withdrawn by the PI  or the Sponsor if enrollment into the trial is inappropriate, the trial 
plan is violated, or for administrative a nd/or other safety reasons.  Specific details 
regarding discontinuation or withdrawal are provided in Section 7.1.4 – Other Procedures.  
A subject must be discontinued from the trial for any of the following reasons: 
• The subject withdraws consent. 
• Unacceptable adverse experiences as described in Section 5.2.1.2 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
• Investigator’s decision to withdraw the subject 
• The subject has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test 
• Noncompliance with tria l treatment or procedure requirements  
• The subject is lost to follow -up 
• Administrative reasons  
The end of treatment and f ollow- up visit procedures are listed in Section 6 (Protocol Flow 
Chart) and Section 7.1.5 (Visit Requirements).  After the end of treatm ent, each subject 
will be followed for 30 days for adverse event monitoring (serious adverse events will be collected for 90 days after the end of treatment as described in Section 7.2.3.1).  Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than progressive dise ase will have post -treatment follow -
up for disease status until disease progression, initiating a non- study cancer treatment, 
withdrawing consent or becoming lost to follow -up.  After documented disease progression 
each subject will be followed by review of electronic medical record until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first.

 5.9 Subject Replacement Strategy  
5.10 Clinical Criteria for Early Trial Termination  
Early trial termination will be the result of the criteria specified  below: 
1. Quality or quantity of data recording is inaccurate or incomplete  
2. Poor adherence to protocol and regulatory requirements 
3. Incidence or severity of adverse drug reaction in this or other studies indicates a 
potential health hazard to subjects 
4. Plans t o modify or discontinue the development of the study drug 
In the event of Merck decision to no longer supply study drug, ample notification will be 
provided so that appropriate adjustments to subject treatment can be made.

 7.0 TRIAL PROCEDURES  
7.1 Trial Procedures  
The Trial Flow Chart - Section 6.1 summarizes the trial procedures to be performed at ea ch 
visit.  Individual trial procedures are described in detail below.  It may be necessary to 
perform these procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by the investigator.  
Furthermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by the Sponsor and/ or 
Merck for reasons related to subject safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be potentially sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local regulations may require that additional informed consent be obtained from the subject.  In these cases, such evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations.  
7.1.1 Administrative Procedures  
7.1.1.1 Informed Consent  and Registration Process  
The Investigator must obtain documented consent from each potential subject prior to 
participating in a clinical trial. After obtaining Informed Consent, eligible patients will be 
enrolled on this trial. Subjects will be issued a subject unique identifying numbers for eligible participants. An investigator is re quired to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case 
histories designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each subject treated with the investigational product in the study or registered to the study.  
While al l study evaluations must be performed by the Investig ator as described in Section 
9.0, Study Evaluations and Study Calendar  (Section  6.1) . This study will use  a web based 
data en try system, REDCAP, for data collection.  
7.1.1.1.1  General Informed Consent  
Consent must be documented by the subject’s dated signature along with the dated signature 
of the person conducting the consent discussion. 
A copy of the signed and dated consent form should be given to the subject before 
participation in the trial.  
The initial informed consent form, any subsequent revised written informed consent form and any written information provided to the subject must receive the IRB/ERC’s approval/favorable opinion in advance of use.  The subject should be informed in a timely manner  if new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s 
willingness to continue participation in the trial.  The communication of this information will be provided and documented via a revised consent form or addendum to the original consent form that captures the subject’s dated signature or by the subject’s legally acceptable representative’s dated signature.  
    
  
35 
 Specifics about the  trial and the trial population will be added to the consent form template at 
the protocol level. 
The informed consent will adhere to IRB  requirements, applicable laws and regulations and 
Sponsor requirements.

 7.1.4 Other Procedures  
7.1.4.1 Withdrawal/Discontinuation 
When a subject discontinues/withdraws prior to trial  completion, all applicable activities scheduled for 
the final trial visit should be performed at the time of discontinuation.  Any adverse events which are 
present at the time of discontinuation/withdrawal should be followed in accordance with the safety requirements outlined in Section 7.2 - Assessing and recording adverse events. After discontinuing 
treatment following assessment of CR, these subjects should return to the sit e for a safety f ollow- up visit 
(described in Section 7.1.5.3.1) and then proceed to the follow -up period of the study (described in 
Section 7.1.5.4). 
7.1.4.2 Blinding/Unblinding  
This is an open- label trial. Blinding will not be performed.  
7.1.5 Visit Requirements  
Visit requirements  are outlined in Section 6.0 - trial flow c hart.   Specific procedur e-related details are 
provided above in Section 7.1 - trial p rocedures.  
7.1.5.1 Screening  
7.1.5.1.1 Screening Period  
7.1.5.2 Treatment Period  
Patients will be evaluated by the treating radiation oncologist at least once per week while undergoing neoadjuvant , concurrent  chemoradiati on treatment. During the neoadjuvant and adjuvant 
pembrolizumab therapy, patients will be evaluated at least every three weeks by the treating medical oncologist with labs performed as per study flow chart . 
7.1.5.3 Post-Treatment Visits  
After completion of the final cycle of pembrolizumab, patients will be evaluated by the treating medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, or surgical oncologist every 3-6 months for the first two years, then 
every 6-12 months for years three to five as per standard of care. 
7.1.5.3.1  Safety Follow- Up Visit  
The mandatory safety follow -up visit will be required for subjects who have completed 6 cycles of 
pembrolizumab and should be conducted approximately 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment or 
before the initiation of a ne w anti -cancer  treatment, whichever comes first.  All AEs that occur prior to 
the safety follow -up visit should be recorded.  Subjects with an AE of Grade > 1 will be followed until 
the resolution of the AE to Grade 0- 1 or until the beginning of a new anti -neoplastic therapy, whichever 
 
 
  41 
 
 occurs first.  SAEs that occur within 90 days of the end of treatment or before initiation of a new anti -
cancer  treatment should also be followed and recorded by review of the medical chart . 
7.1.5.4 Follow- up Visits  
Subjects who discontinue trial treatment for a reason other than disease progression will move into the 
follow- up phase and should be assessed as per discretion of treating oncologist. Every effort should be 
made to collect information regarding disease status until the sta rt of new anti -neoplastic therapy, 
disease progression, death, end of the study.  Information regarding post -study anti -neoplastic treatment 
will be collected if new treatment is initiated.  
7.1.5.4.1 Survival Follow- up 
Once a subject experiences confirmed disease pr ogression or starts a new anti -cancer  therapy, the 
subject moves into the survival follow-up phase. 
7.2 Assessing and Recording Adverse Events  
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject associated with administered of a pharmaceutical product and/or use of a medical procedure, 
which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for 
example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol -
specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol -specified 
procedure.  Any worsening  (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) 
of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Merck ’s product, is also an 
adverse event.  
Changes resulting from normal growth and development that do not vary significantly in frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse events.  Examples of this may i nclude, 
but are not limited to, onset of menses or menopause occurring at a physiologically appropriate time. 
Merck  product includes any pharmaceutical product, biological product, device, diagnostic agent or 
protocol- specified procedure, whether investigational (including placebo or active comparator 
medication) or marketed, manufactured by, licensed by, provided by or distributed by Merck for human 
use. 
Adverse events may occur during the course of the use of Merck product in clinical trials, or as prescribed in clinical practice, from overdose (whether accidental or intentional), from abuse and from withdrawal.  
Progres sion of the cancer under study is not considered an adverse event. 
All adverse events that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment must be reported by the investigator if they cause the subject to be excluded from the trial, or are the result of a protocol -
 
 
  42 
 
 specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, or a 
procedure. 
From the time of treatment through 30 days following cessation of treatment, all adverse events must be 
reported by  the investigator. Such events will be recorded at each examination on the Adverse Event 
case report forms/worksheets.  The reporting timeframe for adverse events meeting any serious criteria is described in section 7.2.3.1. The investigator will make ever y attempt to follow all subjects with non -
serious adverse events for outcome.  
Adverse events will not be collected for subjects during the pre -screening period as long as that subject 
has not undergone any protocol -specified procedure or intervention.  If the subject requires a blood 
draw, fresh tumor biopsy etc., the subject is first required to provide consent to the main study and AEs will be captured according to guidelines for standard AE reporting. 
 
7.2.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE, SAE , and Other  Reportable Safety Event 
Information 
All AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events that occur after the consent for m is signed but before 
intervention allocation/randomization must be reported by the investigator if the participant is receiving 
placebo run- in or other run- in treatment, if the event cause the participant to be excluded from the 
study, or is the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or 
discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, or a procedur e. 
• All AEs from the time of intervention  allocation/randomization through 30 days following 
cessation of study intervention must be reported by the investigator. 
• All AEs meeting serious criteria, from the time of intervention  allocation/randomization through 
90 days following cessation of study intervention or 30 days following cessation of study 
intervention if the participant initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, must be reported by the investigator. 
• All pregnancies and exposure during breastfee ding, from the time of intervention 
allocation/randomization through 120 days following cessation of study intervention, or 30 days following cessation of study intervention if the participant initiates new anticancer therapy must be reported by the investigator.  
• Additionally, any SAE brought to the attention of an investigator at any time outside of the time period specified above must be reported immediately to Merck  if the event is considered drug-
related.  
 
Investigators are not obligated to acti vely seek AE s or SAE s or other reportable safety events in former 
study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify Merck . 
 
 
  43 
 
 All initial and follow -up AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events will be recorded and reported to 
Merck within the time frames as indicated in the table below :

 7.2.2 Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the 
Sponsor  and to Merck  
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 mg or greater (≥5 times the indicated dose).  No specific information is available on the 
treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  In the event of overdose, the  subject should be observed 
closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  
If an adverse event(s)  is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a Merck  product , 
the adverse event(s) is rep orted as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness 
criteria are met.  
If a dose of Merck ’s product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any 
associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non-serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional 
overdose without adverse effect.” 
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 5 working 
days hours to Merck  Globa l Safety . (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993-1220) 
7.2.3 Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactation to the Sponsor  and to Merck  
Although pregnancy and lactation are not considered adverse events, it is the responsibility 
of investigators or their designees to report any pregnancy or lactation in a subject (spontaneously reported to them) that occurs during the trial. 
Pregnancies and lactations that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment 
allocation/randomization must be reported by the investigator if they cause the subject to be excluded from the trial, or are the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but 
not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure. 
Pregnancies and lactations that occur from the time of treatment allocation/randomization 
through 120 days following cessation of Sponsor ’s product, or 30 days following cessation 
of treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, must be reported by the investigator.  All reported pregnancies must be followed to the 
completion/termination of the pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and stillbirth must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If 
the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported. 
Such events must be reported within 2 working days to Merck Global Safety. (Att n: 
Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993-1220) 
 
 
  45 
 
 7.2.4 Immediate Reporting of Adverse Events to the Sponsor  and to Merck  
7.2.4.1 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring at any dose or during any use of 
Merck ’s product that: 
• Results in  death;  
• Is life threatening;  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization; 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Is an other important medical event  
• N ote:  In addition to the above c riteria, adverse events meeting either of the below 
criteria, although not serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the Merck in the same timeframe as SAEs to meet certain local requirements. Therefore, these events are considered serious by Merck for  collection purposes. 
● 
Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study); 
● Is associated with an overdose. 
Refer to Table 6 for additional details regarding each of the above criteria.  
For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment, any serious 
adverse event, or follow up to a serious adverse event, including death due to any cause other than progression of the cancer under study (reference Section 7.2.3.3 for additional details) , 
that occurs to any subject must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 
working days to Merck Global Safety if it causes the subject to be excluded from the trial, or is the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or 
discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedur e. 
For the time period beginning at treatment through 90 days following cessation of treatment, or 30 days following cessation of treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is ear lier, any serious adverse event, or follow up to a serious adverse event, 
including death due to any cause other than progression of the cancer under study (reference Section 7.2.3.3 for additional details), whether or not related to the Merck product, mus t be 
reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to Merck Global Safety.  
Additionally, any serious adverse event, considered by an investigator who is a qualified physician to be related to Merck product that is brought to the attention of the investigator at any time following consent through the end of the specified safety follow -up period specified 
in the paragraph above, or at any time outside of the time period specified in the previous paragraph also must be reported immediately to the Sponsor and to Merck  Global Safety . 
All subjects with serious adverse events must be followed up for outcome. 
 
 
  46 
 
 SAE reports and any other relevant safety information are to be forwarded on a 
MedWatch form (FDA 3500) to the Merck Global Safety facsimil e number:  +1 -215-661-
6229  
A copy of all 15 Day Reports and Annual Progress Reports is submitted as required by FDA, 
European Union (EU), Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices agency (PMDA) or other local regulators. Investigators will cross reference this su bmission according to local regulations to 
the Merck Investigational Compound Number (IND, CSA, etc.) at the time of submission.  Additionally investigators will submit a copy of these reports to Merck & Co., Inc. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993-1220) at the time of submission to FDA. 
7.2.4.2 Events of Clinical Interest  
Selected non -serious and serious adverse events are also known as Events of Clinical Interest 
(ECI) and must be reported with in 5 working days to Merck Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide 
Product Safety; FAX 215 993-1220). 
For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment, any ECI, or follow up to an ECI, that occurs to any subject must be reported within 5 working days to 
Merck Global Safety if it causes the subj ect to be excluded from the trial, or is the result of a 
protocol- specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of 
usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure. 
For the time period beginning at treatment through 90 days following cessation of treatment, 
or 30 days following cessation of treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, any ECI, or follow up to an ECI, whether or not related to Merck product, must be reported within 5 days  to Merck Global Safety.  
Events of clinical interest for this trial include: 
1.  an overdose of Merck  product, as defined in Section 7.2.1 - Definition of an Overdose for 
This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the Sponsor , that is not associated with clinical 
symptoms or abnormal laboratory results. 2.  an elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit of 
normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X the upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that is less than 2X the upper limit of normal, as determined by way of protocol -specified laboratory testing or 
unscheduled laboratory testing.* 
*Note:   
 These criteria are based upon available regul atory guidance documents. The 
purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology. 
 
 
  47 
 
 7.2.4.3 Protocol -Specific Exceptions to Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Efficacy endpoints as outlined in this section will not be reported to Merck as described in 
Section 7.2.3. ( Immediate Reporting of Adverse Events to the Sponsor and to Merck ), unless 
there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the drug and the event. Any s uch 
event will be submitted to Merck Global Safety within 5  working days either by electronic or 
paper media.  
Specifically, the suspected/actual events covered in this exception include any event that is 
disease progression of the cancer under study.  
The Sponsor will monitor unblinded aggregated efficacy endpoint events and safety data to 
ensure the safety of the subjects in the trial. Any suspected endpoint which upon review is not progression of the cancer under study will be forwarded to Merck Global Safety as a SAE within 5  working days of determination that the event is not progression of the cancer under 
study 
Hospitalization related to convenience (e.g.  transportation issues etc.) will not be considered 
a SAE.  
 
7.2.5 Evaluating Adverse Events 
An investigato r who is a qualified physician will evaluate all adverse events according to the 
NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Intensity of all 
adverse events will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events v 4.0 (CTCAE) on a five -point scale (grades 1 to 5, Table 6) and reported in 
detail on the CRF.  Any adverse event which changes CTCAE grade over the course of a given episode will have each change of grade recorded on the adverse event case report forms/worksheets. 
All adverse events regardless of CTCAE grade must also be evaluated for seriousness.  
 
48 
 Table 6  Evaluating Adverse Events 
An investigator who is a qualified physician, will evaluate all adverse events as to:  
V4.0 CTCAE 
Grading Grade 1  Mild; a symptomatic or mid symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.  
 
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental ADL.  
 Grade 3  Severe or medically significan t but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation or hospitalization indicated; 
disabling; limiting self -care ADL.  
 Grade 4  Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
 Grade 5  Death related to AE  
Seriousness  A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring at any dos e or during any use of Merck  product that:  
 †Results in death ; or 
 †Is life threatening; or  places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (Note: This does not include an 
adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.); or  
 †Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal lif e functions); or  
 †Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization  (hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay, even if the 
hospitalization is a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: Hospitalization for an elective procedure to treat a pre- existing condition that has not 
worsened is not a serious adverse event.  A pre-existing condition is a clinical condition that is diagnosed prior to the use of a Merck product and is documented in 
the patient’s medical history.); or  
 †Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  (in offspring of subject taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis);or  
 Is a new cancer  (that is not a condition of the study)  (although not serious per ICH definition, is reportable to the Sponsor  within 24 hours and to Merck within 2 
working days to meet certain local requirements); or 
 Is an overdose  (whether accidental or intentional).  Any adverse event associated with an overdose is considered a serious adverse event for collection purposes. An 
overdose that is not associated with an adverse event is considered a non- serious event of clinical interest and must be reported within 24 hours  to the Sponsor  and to 
Merck within 2 working days. . 
 Other important medical even ts that may not result in death, not be life threatening, or not require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse eve nt when, 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
 
49 
 listed previously (designated above by a †).  
Duration  Record the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less than 1 day, indicate the appropriate length of time and units  
Action taken  Did the a dverse event ca use Merck  product to be discontinued?  
Relationship to 
Merck  Product  Did Merck  product cause the adverse event? The determinati on of the likelihood that Merck  product caused the adverse event will be provided by an investigator 
who is a qualified physicia n. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE form, ensures 
that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are 
intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test drug and the adverse event based upon the 
available information.  
The following compone nts are to be used to assess the re lationship between Merck  product and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the components and 
their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely Merck  product caused the adverse event (AE):  
 Expos ure Is there evidence that the subject was a ctually exposed to Merck  product such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (pill count, 
diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?  
 Time Course  Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from  administration of Merck  product?  
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug- induced effect (applies to trials with investigational medicinal product)? 
 Likely Cause  Is the AE not reasonably explained by another etiology such as underlying disease, other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental  factors  
 
 
50 
 Relationship  The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the test drug and the AE: (conti nued)  
to Merck  
Product  
(continued)  Dechallenge  Was Merck  product discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency reduced?  
If yes, did the AE resolve or improve?  
If yes, this is a positive dechallenge. If no, this is a negative dechallenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or permanent disability; (2) the AE resolved/improved despite continuation of 
the Sponsor ’s product; or (3) the trial is a single- dose drug trial); or (4) Sponsor ’s product(s) is/are only used one time.)  
 Rechallenge  Was the sub ject re -exposed to Merck  product in this study?  
If yes, did the AE recur or worsen?  
If yes, this is a positive rechallenge. If no, this is a negative rechallenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in death or permanent disability, or (2) the trial is a single- dose drug trial); or 
(3) Sponsor ’s product(s) is/are used only one time).  
NOTE: IF A RECHALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR AN ADVERSE EVENT WHICH WAS SERIOUS AND WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY MERCK PROD UCT, OR IF REEXPOSURE TO MERCK  PRODUCT POSES ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT RISK 
TO THE SUBJECT, THEN THE RECHALLENGE MUST BE APPROVED IN ADVANCE BY THE SPONSOR  
AS PER DOSE 
MODIFICATION GUIDELINES IN THE PROTOCOL.  
 Consistency 
with Trial 
Treatment Profi le Is the clinical/pathological presentation of the AE consistent with previous k nowledge regarding Merck  product or drug class pharmacology or 
toxicology?  
The assessment of relationship will be reported on the case report forms /worksheets by an investig ator who is a qualified physician according to his/her best clinical judgment, including 
consideration of the above elements.  
Record one of the following  Use the following scale of criteria as guidance (not all criteria must be present  to be indicative of  Merck  product relationship).  
Yes, there is a rea sonable 
possibility of Merck  product 
relationship.  There is evide nce of exposure to Merck  product.  The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to the  administration of Merck  product is 
reasonable.  The AE is more likely explained by Merck  product than by another cause.  
No, there is not a rea sonable 
possibility of Merck  product 
relationship Subje ct did not receive the Merck  product OR temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of Merck  product is not reasonable 
OR the AE is more likely explained by another cause than the Merck product.  (Also entered for a subject with overdose without an associated 
AE.)

 7.2.6 Sponsor  Responsibility for Reporting Adverse Events  
All Adverse Events will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB  and investigators in 
accordance with all applicable global laws and regulations.  
8.0 CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES  
We will perform immunohistochemistry and flow cytometric analysis in order to find markers that correlate w ith or predict response to neoadjuvant treatment. Whole exome 
sequencing, RNA expression analysis, and T -cell receptor sequencing may also be 
considered to explore expression profiles of tumor neo- antigens, immune modulators, and T 
cell repertoires. Immuno histochemistry and immunofluorescence will be performed on 
optional pretreatment biopsy and surgical resection specimens using standard methodology 
and an automated analyzer. Imaging analysis will be used for quantification. Flow cytometric analysis will b e performed on peripheral blood samples and tumor specimens to characterize 
the peripheral blood immunophenotype and tumor immune cell infiltrate in patients receiving chemoradiotherapy and pembrolizumab.  We will use CD3, CD4, CD8, B220, Foxp3, PD -1, 
Eome s, Ki67, and Granzyme B staining to analyze the tumor lymphocyte population, 
including quantification of the immunoinhibitory Treg population and characterization of exhausted versus reinvigorated effector T cells. We will utilize CIBERSORT to characterize  
the tumor immune cell composition.  CIBERSORT is a computational method that analyzes RNA expression data within complex tissues to quantify estimated fraction of leukocyte subsets, including naïve and memory B cells, CD8+ T cells, resting and activated m emory 
CD4+ T cells, natural killer cells, monocytes, macrophage subtypes, resting and activated dendritic cells, and neutrophils (31). Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and/or 
immunofluorescence will be employed to assess cell surface expression of MHC -I, PD -1, 
PD-L1, PD-L2, and CTLA-4 in pre- treatment biopsy and surgical resection specimens. Given 
that tumor mutational lo ad correlates with clinical response to anti -PD-1 therapy 
administered in the absence of radiation therapy (15, 30), whole exome sequencing may be performed to correlate mutational load with outcomes . Finally, nex t-generation deep 
sequencing may be used to assess diversity of the T cell receptor repertoire and heterogeneity  
8.1 Collection, Handling, and Shipping of Specimens  
Additional blood and tumor samples will be collected for research purposes only. Some of 
these research studies are mandatory for study participation and some are optional. The 
optional studies will be performed only on patients who have provided informed consent for each individual study. Samples will be transported in compliance with current regul atory 
guidelines for transport of biological specimens.  
 8.1.1 Tumor Samples  (optional) 
Paraffin -embedded sa mples from initial tumor biopsy will be assessed for PDL -1 expresssion 
using an house testing platform. Fresh tumor biopsies via endoscopic procedure  at study 
 
52 
 entry are optional for patients who have provided written consent  for this separate procedure . 
Fresh  tissue  from surgical resection specimen  will be processed and stored in the Duke 
biorepository. 
8.1.2 Blood Samples 
Blood samples will be analyzed via flow cytometry for the presence of PD -1 expressing T 
cells as well as for the proportion of circulating regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid -
derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Other immune cell populations may also be explored.  
Plasma may also be analyzed for  cytokines and genetic alterations in cell free DNA related to 
tumor immunology and cancer biology. Please see Table below for complete blood sample collection schedule . Three acid citrate dexatrose (ACD) and 2 ethylenediamine tetraacetic 
acid (EDTA) will be obtained at the following time points: 
Time points for blood sample collections  
Pre-treatment  After  consent is signed , prior to first study drug administration  
On-treatment  Week 3 of chemoradiation +pembrolizumab  
On-treatment  Post- Cycle  3, prior to surgical resection  
On-treatment  After surgery, Pre -Cycle 4  
Post-treatment  30 days post -Cycle 6  
 
8.2 Correlative Studies  
The following correlative studies will be performed using PBMCs and tumor tissues collected from the patients included in the study:  
 The p
lanned Correlative Science (CS) studies for this Phase II clinical trial will focus on comprehensive immune profiling of the pre - and post -treatment tumor microenvironment 
(TE) as well as baseline and longitudinal Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC s) 
samples in an attempt to identify both baseline signatures that predict  which patients might 
benefit from neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy as well as pharmacodynamic signatures that could provide mechanistic insights regarding therapeutic 
responses. Given the past difficulties in the identification of anti -PD-1 signatures in the 
peripheral circulation (i.e. PBMC), special emphasis will be placed on immune profiling the TE. The principal profiling platform to be used in these studies will be highly standardized, polychromatic flow cytometry assays that have been developed by the Duke Immune Profiling Core (DIPC) specifically for monitoring immune signatures in the context of immune checkpoint blockade trials. 
 
 
53 
 The 3 proposed immune profiling panels for this trial are depicted below, and include: 1) a 
12-color ‘Exhaustion Panel’, 2) a 12 -color ‘Tumor Reactive T Cell Panel’, and 3) a 14 -color 
regulatory T cell (Treg) and monocytic myeloid -derived suppressor cells (m -MDSC) panel. 
Each of these established panels can also serve as a base for inclusion of additional 
phenotypic markers of interest. Instrumentation within DIPC includes a 4- laser BD SORP 
LSRII analyzer (19 -parameter capacity), a 5 -laser BD SORP LSRFortessa analyzer (21 -
parameter capacity), and a 5 -laser BD SORP LSRFortessa X50 analyzer (46 -parameter 
capacity). This later instrument with 5 high powered lasers, each serving a decagon composed of 10 tunable detectors, is capable of highly efficient high dimension profiling, and includes a ‘microfluidics console’ that is ideally suited for comprehensive analyses of 
samples with limited cellular content such as occasional TE specimens. ‘Reportables’ for all the immune profiling analyses will include single parameter frequencies (62 for the ‘exhaustion’ panel; 54 for the ‘tumor reactive’ panel; and 73 for the ‘Treg and MDSC’ panel) in addition to frequencies of selected co- expression markers.  
 
 
 
54 
  
In addition to the 3 proposed phenotyping panels above, a fourth ‘Intracellular Cytokine 
Staining ’ (ICS) panel will be included to measure the frequency and relative 
polyfunctionality of T cell reactivities against highly conserved tumor associated antigens (TAA).  Based on the expression of TAA by the individual patient’s pre -treatment tumo r, 
PBMC and TE samples will be stimulated with TAA peptide pools consisting of 15- mers 
with 11 amino acid overlaps in the presence of a transport inhibitor. The antigen- driven T 
cell response will be assessed by determining the frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+  T cells 
staining positive for intracellular IFN -γ, IL -2, TNF -α, granzyme B, and expression of 
CD107a. Using Boolean gating, the relative polyfunctionality of the anti -TAA responses can 
be delineated.  
The proposed Correlative Science studies for this Phase  II protocol will test the following 
hypotheses: 
1) Neoadjuvant pembrolizumab with concurrent chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant pembrolizumab will produce higher frequencies of activated T cells in PBMC and TE than standard of care chemoradiotherapy alone. 
2) Enrol led patients with an immunologically activated (‘hot’) tumor 
microenvironment (TE) at baseline will derive greater therapeutic benefit from neoadjuvant pembrolizumab therapy than those with a non- activated (‘cold’) TE.  
• Baseline TE containing >20% CD8+ cell s co-expressing CTLA -4 and 
PD-1 will constitute an immunologically activated TE  
3) Enrolled patients with PDL -1+ tumors will derive greater therapeutic benefit 
than patients with PDL -1- tumors. 
4)  Clinical Response(s) to therapy will be accompanied by an inc rease in the 
frequency and polyfunctionality of anti-TAA T cell responses in PBMC and TE. 
 9.0 STUDY EVALUATIONS AND STUDY CALENDAR  
9.1 Screening S tudies  
The following procedures will be performed during the screening period: 
• Informed consent 
• History/demographics updated within 2 weeks prior to patient enrollment 
• Documentation of cancer  
• CBC with differential  
• Comprehensive Serum Chemistry Panel 
• T3, FT4, and TSH 
• Urinalysis  
• Serum β –HCG or urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential 
• Blood for research stud ies (PBMCs) will be collected (pre -treatment) after study 
consent is signed 
• Optional Tumor Biopsy (pre- treatment)  after study consent is signed 
 
55 
 • Staging imaging (CT CAP or PET/CT) to confirm no evidence of metastatic disease  
• EUS for local tumor staging (if ultrasound probe able to traverse tumor). Not required 
if EUS probe cannot traverse the lesion. 
• EKG within 30 days prior to first study drug administration.  
 The screening period can  be up to 30 days prior to first study drug administration (Day 1 
Cycle 1) . Laboratory baseline evaluations are to be conducted within 14 days prior to first 
administration of study drug. Radiologic imaging must be done  within  45 days prior to first 
study drug administration.  
 
9.2 On Study Evaluations  
Visits will occur with the treating medical oncologist at each pembrolizumab treatment visit 
(i.e. every 3 weeks during Cycles 1 – 3 and Cycles 4 – 6) from study initiation. The 
following procedures will be performed during the pembrolizumab treatment period: 
• Physical exam, including weight, vital signs, ECOG performance status 
• Administration of study drug 
• Recording of adverse events  
• Relevant laboratory evaluations, WBC, Hgb, Plt, ANC, Cr, K, Ca, ALT, AST, Total Bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase , TSH  
• Blood for research studies (PB MCs) will  be collected at week 3  of chemoradiation, 
prior to surgery, and prior to cycle 4 and at safety follow up visit 
• Disease assessments will be performed at after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiation and then at the treating physicians discretion  
 Visits will occur with the treating radiation oncologist once weekly during the five week 
radiation treatment period.  The following procedures will be performed during the radiation treatment period : 
• Physical exam, including weight, vital signs, ECOG performance status  
• Recording of adverse events  
 A visit with the operating  surgeon will typically occur within four -eight  weeks of completing 
chemo radiotherapy to assess treatment -induced toxicity and determine optimal timing for 
surgical resection . Additional postope rative visits by the surgeon will occur  as per treating 
physician’s discretion . 
 Subsequent follow -up visits will occur approximately every 3 -6 months  for the first two 
years after treatment, every 6-12 months  during years three to five  as per discretion o f 
treating physicians.  These visits may alternate among the medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and surgeon.  The following will be performed during this post- treatment period:  
• Physical exam, including weight, vital signs, ECOG performance status 
• Recording of adverse events (up to 90 days after last dose of pembrolizumab) 
• CT CAP or PET/CT  
 
 
56 
 9.3 Off Study Evaluation  
Final visit is to be performed at the time (or within 30 days +/- 14 days ) of removal  from the 
study if adjuvant therapy is administered . Off study evaluations will include: 
• Physical exam: height, weight vital signs, ECOG performance status  
• Recording of adverse events (for unresolved adverse events, patients should be 
monitored for 30 days following the last dose of study drug)  
Patients who complete study treatment should be followed for local recurrence, distant recurrence, progression free  and overall survival every 6 months  by retrospective review of 
the patient’s chart or by phone call.  10.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  PLAN  
10.1 Statistical Analysis Plan  
The primary o bjective of this one -arm Phase II trial is to test whether neoadjuvant 
chemoradiotherapy combined with Pembrolizumab followed by surgical resection has a pathologic complete response (pCR) rate that is significantly larger than the historical co ntrol 
pCR rate observed with standard of care (neoadjuvant radiotherapy followed by surgical resection ). A historical pCR rate of 0. 23 (van Hagen, 2012) was observed in 161 patients. An 
accrual rate of about 12 patients per year is expected in this trial. While the planned statistical design requires no more than 30 patients ( 30 months of accrual), the trial could accrue as 
many as 38 patients ( 36 months of accrual) in order to replace patients who withdraw before 
surgery. Thus, the length of the trial coul d be as long as 41 months (i.e., 36 months of accrual 
plus 5 months for the last patient to be evaluated for response). 
A two -stage design will be used to test the null hypothesis that the true pCR rate is ≤ 0.30 
against the alternative hypothesis that the  true pCR rate is ≥ 0.50. This design will allow the 
trial to stop early to accept the null hypothesis. If there are no more than 4 responders (27%) 
in the first 15 evaluable patients, the trial will stop to accept the null. Otherwise, an additional 15 eva luable patients will be accrued. The null will be rejected only if at least 13 
(43%) or more of the 30 patients respond. The significance level and power of this design are 0.08 and 0.81, respectively. The probability of early termination under the null and alternative hypotheses is 0.56 and 0.06, respectively. The observed pCR rate will be estimated with its exact 80% confidence interval.  
 Secondary Objective 1 is to estimate the safety of the study treatment. Toxicity by type and grade will be tabulated. Toxicity rates of interest will be calculated with their 80% confidence intervals. Only 2 Grade+3  toxicities  of any type will be tolerated in the first ten 
accrued patients. If and when a third  Grade 3+ toxicity is observed in the first ten patients, a 
dose reduction in radiation will be considered.  Exploratory Objective 1 is to estimate the association between pCR rate and selected predictors of response. Using categorical predictors of clinical interest, pCR rates with their 80% confidence intervals will  be presented according to the level of the predictors.  
 
57 
 Exploratory Objective 2 is to estimate the distribution of time to local recurrence (TTLR), 
time to distant recurrence (TTDR), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). L ocal recurrence will be defined as the time from enrollment to local recurrence; 
distant recurrences will be ignored  and deaths will be censored.  TTDR will be defined 
analogously. PFS will be defined as the time from enrollment to local recurrence, distant recurrence, or death due to any cause, whichever comes first. OS is defined as the time from enrollment to death due to any cause. The Kaplan Meier method will be used to estimate these four distributions. 
10.1.1 Interim Analysis to Monitor Safety  
After the first 5 eligibl e patients have been accrued to the study , an analysis will be 
performed to assess acute treatment -related toxicity. If more than 1, grade 3 or greater 
toxicities is definitely related to concurrent pembrolizumab and chemo radiotherapy are 
observed, then an additional five patients will be added to this treatment arm. If no issues 
concerning for safety are observed within 30 days of the last dose of neoadjuvant 
pembrolizumab (cycle 3) for the fifth patient, then the study will continue to accrue. Patients 
accrued prior to the interim analysis will be evaluated for the primary endpoint.

12.0 ADMINISTRATIVE AND REGULATORY DETAILS  
12.1 Confidentiality  
All patient data will be captured and maintained in a study specific databas e with password 
protected access. Data is entered using an assigned patient identification number. The data 
provided to those reviewing the results, for example the study statistician will include the patient identification numbers, but will not include pa tient identifiable data. The research 
samples obtained in this study will only be sent using the patient identification number which can only be linked to the patient at a given institution by the treating physician. All documentation that contains persona l health information that may include patient identifiable 
information will be maintained at the site to preserve patient confidentiality.  
 
12.2 Compliance with Financial Disclosure Requirements  
By signing this protocol, the investigator agrees to provide to the Sponsor  accurate financial 
information to allow the Sponsor to submit complete and accurate certification and disclosure 
statements as required by U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations (21 CFR Part 54). 
 
59 
 The investigator further agrees to provide this information on a Financial 
Disclosure/Certification Form that is provided by Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. This requirement also extends to sub investigators . The investigator 
also consents to the transmission of this information to Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., in the United States for these purposes. This may involve the transmission of information to countries that do not have laws protecting personal data.  
12.3 Compliance with Law, Audit and Debarment  
By signing this protocol, the investigator agrees to conduct the study in an efficient and  
diligent manner and in conformance with this protocol; generally accepted standards of  Good 
Clinical Practice; and all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules and  regulations 
relating to the conduct of the clinical study.  
 The Code of Conduct, a collection of goals and considerations that govern the ethical and  
scientific conduct of clinical investigations Sponsor ed by Merck is attached.  The inves tigator 
also agrees to allow monitoring, audits, Institutional Review  Board/Independent Ethics 
Committee review, and regulatory agency inspection of trial- related  documents and 
procedures and provide for direct access to all study- related source data and d ocuments. 
 The investigator agrees not to seek reimbursement from subjects/patients, their insurance  
providers, or from government programs for procedures included as part of the study  
reimbursed to the investigator by the Sponsor.  The Investigator shall prepare and maintain complete and accurate study documentation  in 
compliance with Good Clinical Practice standards and applicable federal, state, and  local 
laws, rules and regulations; and, for each subject/patient participating in the study, provide all data, and upon completion or termination of the clinical study submit any  other reports to the 
sponsor as required by this protocol or as otherwise required pursuant to any agreement with 
the Sponsor.  Study documentation will be promptly and fully disclosed to the Sponsor by the  investigator 
upon request and also shall be made available at the investigator’s site upon request for 
inspection, copying, review, and audit at reasonable times by representatives  of the Sponsor 
or any regulatory agencies. The investigator agrees to promptly take any reasonable steps that 
are requested by the Sponsor as a result of an audit to cure  deficiencies in the study 
documentation and worksheets/case report forms.  International Conference of Harmonization Good Clinical Pract ice guidelines (Section  4.3.3) 
recommend that the investigator inform the subject’s primary physician about the  subject’s 
participation in the trial if the subject has a primary physician and if the subject agrees to the 
primary physician being informed.  According to European legislation, a Sponsor must designate a principal or  coordinating 
investigator (CI) to review the report (summarizing the study results) and  confirm that to the 
best of his/her knowledge the report accurately describes conduct and results of the study. 
 
60 
 The Sponsor may consider one or more factors in the selection of  the individual to serve as 
the CI (e.g., thorough understanding of clinical trial methods,  appropriate enrollment of 
subject/patient cohort, timely achievement of study milestones,  availability of the CI during 
the anticipated review process).  
 
The investigator will promptly inform the Sponsor of any regulatory agency  inspection 
conducted for this study.  Persons debarred from conducting or working on clinical studies by any  court or  regulatory 
agency will not be allowed to conduct or work on this Sponsor ’s studies.  The investigator 
will immediately disclose in writing to the Sponsor if any person who is involved in 
conducting the study is debarred, or if any proceeding for d ebarment is  pending or, to the 
best of the investigator’s knowledge, threatened.  In the event the SPONSOR  prematurely terminates a particular trial site, the SPONSOR  will 
promptly notify that site’s IRB/IEC.  
 
12.4 Compliance with Trial Registration and Results  Posting Requirements  
Under the terms of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA) and the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA), the Sponsor of the trial is solely 
responsible for determining whether the trial and its results are subject to the requirements for submission to the Clinical Trials Data Bank, http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.  Information posted will allow subjects to identify potentially appropriate trials for their disease conditions and pursue participation by calling a central contact number for further information on appropriate trial locations and trial site contact information.  
12.5 Quality Management System 
By signing this protocol, the Sponsor agrees to be responsible for implementing and 
maintaining quality control and quality assurance systems with written SOPs to ensure that trials are conducted and data are generated, documented, and reported in compliance with the protocol, accepted standards of Good Clinical Practice, and all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations relating to the conduct of the clinical study.  
 
12.6 Data Management 
All patient data will be captured and maintained in a study -specific database with password -
protected access  (REDCAP) . Data is entered using an assigned patien t identification number.  
The data provided to those reviewing the results, for example the study statistician, will include the patient identification numbers, but will not include patient identifiable data.  
 The research samples obtained in this study wi ll only be sent using the patient identification 
number, which can only be linked to the patient by the study team. All documentation that 
contains personal health information that may include patient identifiable information will be maintained at the site  to preserve patient confidentiality.  
 
61 
  
Access to the password -protected study website will be limited to individuals involved in  the 
clinical trial: overall Study PI, research nurses, and  data managers responsible for this trial. 
Adverse Events reporting will be performed as outlined in Section 7.  
 This clinical research study will be monitored both internally by the PI and institutionally by 
the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI).  In terms of internal review the PI will continuously monitor and tabulate adverse  events.  Appropriate reporting to the Duke University Medical 
Center IRB will be made.  If an unexpected frequency of Grade III or IV events occur, depending on their nature, action appropriate to the nature and frequency of these adverse events will be taken.  This may require a protocol amendment, dose de -escalation, or 
potentially closure of the study.  The PI of this study will also continuously monitor the conduct, data, and safety of this study to ensure that: 
Interim analyses occur as scheduled;  
Stopping rules for toxicity and/or response are met; 
Risk/benefit ratio is not altered to the detriment of the subjects; Appropriate internal monitoring of AEs and outcomes is done; Over -accrual does not occur; 
Under- accrual is addressed with appropriate amen dments or actions; 
Data are being appropriately collected in a reasonably timely manner.  
DCI review and monitoring of this protocol occurs in accordance with the NCI -approved 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan.  Briefly, protocol review begins with an initial review by 
the Cancer Protocol Committee (CPC), which assesses the ethics and safety of the protocol.  
Documentation of these assessments will be maintained.  Formal, independent monitoring will be conducted by the DCI Monitoring Team after the first 3 subjects are enrolled, followed by annual monitoring of 1- 3 subjects until the study is closed to enrollment and 
subjects are no longer receiving study interventions that are more than minimal risk.  DCI Monitoring Team reports and additional data/safety/toxi city reports submitted by the PI will 
be reviewed by the Safety Oversight Committee (SOC) on an annual basis.  Additi onal 
monitoring may be prompted by findings from monitoring visits, unexpected frequency of serious and/or unexpected toxicities, or other concerns.  Monitoring visits may also be initiated upon request by DUHS and DCI Leadership, CPC, SOC, a sponsor, an investigator, or the IRB. 
The Duke School of Medicine Office of Audit, Risk and Compliance (OARC) office may 
conduct confidential audits to evaluate compliance with the protocol and the principles of 
 
62 
 GCP.  The PI agrees to allow the OARC auditor(s) direct access to all relevant documents 
and to allocate his/her time and the time of the study team to the OARC auditor(s) in order to discuss findings and any relevant issues.  
OARC audits are designed to protect the rights and well -being of human research subjects. 
OARC audits may be routine or directed (for cause). Routine audits are selected based upon risk metrics generally geared towards high su bject enrollment, studies with limited oversight 
or monitoring, Investigator initiated Investigational Drugs or Devices, federally -funded 
studies, high degree of risk (based upon adverse events, type of study, or vulnerable populations), Phase I studies, or studies that involve Medicare populations. Directed audits occur at the directive of the IRB or an authorized Institutional Official. 
OARC audits examine research studies/clinical trials methodology, processes and systems to 
assess whether the research i s conducted according to the protocol approved by the DUHS 
IRB. The primary purpose of the audit/review is to verify that the standards for safety of human subjects in clinical trials and the quality of data produced by the clinical trial research are met.  The audit/review will serve as a quality assurance measure, internal to the 
institution. Additional goals of such audits are to detect both random and systemic errors occurring during the conduct of clinical research and to emphasize “best practices” in t he 
research/clinical trials environment.  
 
12.6.1.1 Database Access

1.1. Background 
Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide; there were approximately 
1.36 million new cases diagnosed and 690,000 deaths worldwide in 2012.1   Several 
standard therapies for advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer are listed in the guidelines 
2 ,3 ,4, however, the treatment benefit of third line or subsequent therapy is limited in 
patients who maintain their good performance stat us after receiving available treatments.   
Because of differences in examination me thods and objective criteria, the reported 
frequency of Human epidermal growth factor  receptor 2 (HER2) amplification and 
overexpression in colorectal cancer varies between studies.5  In the HERACLES study to 
assess the antitumor activity of trastuzumab and lapatinib in patients with HER2-positive 
FRORUHFWDOFDQFHUKDG HER2-positive tumors in human Kirsten rat sarcoma viral 
oncogene homologue (KRAS) wild-type colorectal cancer.6  In the report from the 
analysis of 3256 patients enrolled in the QUSAR, FOCUS, and PICCOLO studies, it was 
reported that HER2 overexpression in KR AS/v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene 
homolog B1 (BRAF) PXWDWHGFRORUHFWDO FDQFHUWXPRUZDV7  HER2 gene 
amplification is considered to be associated with resistance to anti-epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy8  and HER2 amplification is a predictive marker 
of shorter progression-free survival (PFS ) after anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab treatment 
in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) harboring wild-type rat sarcoma 
viral oncogenes homolog (RAS) and BRAF.9  Therefore, HER2 is considered to be an 
important target for mCRC, however no HER2-targeted therapies are approved for 
colorectal cancer. 
DS-8201a is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC ) targeting HER2.  In the ongoing Phase 1 
clinical study, DS8201-A-J101, in subjects w ith advanced solid tumors, DS-8201a was 
well tolerated at repeated doses of up to 8.0 mg/kg intravenously (IV) once every 3 weeks 
(Q3W).  
1.2. Investigational Product 
1.2.1.  Description 
DS-8201a consists of an antibody componen t, MAAL-9001, covalently conjugated via a 
maleimide tetrapeptide linker, to a drug component, MAAA-1181a.  MAAL-9001 is an in-
house humanized immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody with the same amino acid sequence as trastuzumab.  MAAA-1181a, an ex atecan derivative, is a topoisomerase I 
inhibitor that is cell-membrane permeable, and more potent than SN-38 (active metabolite of irinotecan).  This ADC achieves a high drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) (7 to 8) with homogeneous conjugation with MAAA-1181a.  DS-8201a is cleaved by lysosomal 
enzymes and releases MAAA-1181a in the cytopl asm after it binds to the HER2 receptor, 
and gets internalized in tumor cells. 
The DS-8201a Phase 1 clinical study, DS 8201-A-J101, was initiated with the antibody 
component, MAAL-9001, produced using the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)  cell line (DS1).  To support J203 study, as well as commercial development,  transition has been

Page 23 pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles, indicating that the majority of the administered DS -8201a 
circulates in plasma unchanged.  The plasma concentrations of MAAA-1181a, the drug 
that is release from DS -8201a, were quite low.  The Cmax of DS -8201a for DS2 was 
statistically comparable to that for DS1, but the AUClast of DS-8201a for DS2 was about 
22% lower than that for DS1.  No anti -DS-8201a antibodies were detected in any animals.  
The plasma protein binding ratios of MAAA- 1181a (10 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL) were 90.3% 
to 92.5% in mice, 94.2% to 96.7% in rats, 86.5% to 89.1% in monkeys, and 96.8% to 98.0% in humans. 
The in vitro release rates of MAAA -1181a from DS-8201a in mouse, rat, monkey, and 
human plasma for 3 weeks were 3.9% or less.  Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 was the 
primary CYP enzyme involved in the metabolism of MAAA -1181a.  No human- specific 
metabolites were detected in vitro.  
MAAA-1181a did not exhibit any potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A (50% inhibitory concentration [IC
50] 
>50 μmol/L).  MAAA -1181a did not exhibit any potential to induce CYP3A4, CYP1A2, 
or CYP2B6 at concentrations of up to 30 μmol/L.  MAAA -1181a did not inhibit organic 
anion transporter (OAT) 3, organic cation transporter (OCT) 1, OCT2, organic anion 
transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B3, multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) 1, MATE2-K, P-glycoprotein, breast cancer resistance protein, and bile salt export pump (BSEP) 
(IC
50 >30 μmol/L).  MAAA -1181a inhibited OAT1 and OATP1B1 with the IC 50 values of 
12.7 and 14.4 μmol/L, respe ctively, although the values were much higher than the Cmax 
of MAAA-1181a in humans (9.25 ng/mL [0.019 μmol/L] at 8.0 mg/kg of DS -8201a).  In 
addition, OATPs appeared to contribute to the human hepatic uptake of MAAA-1181a. 
1.2.2.4. Toxicology 
In a study of intermittent intravenous dosing of DS-8201a in rats (Q3W dosing for 
6 weeks), no deaths or moribund animals were found at dose levels up to 197 mg/kg, the 
maximum dose.  The major observed findings were testicular and intestinal toxicity at 
dose levels of 20 mg/k g and greater, and lymphatic/hematopoietic, skin, incisor tooth 
toxicity , and renal toxicity at dose levels of 60 mg/kg and greater.  Except for the testicular 
and incisor tooth changes, these changes were all  found to recover.  
In an intermittent intraveno us dosing study of DS-8201a in cynomolgus monkeys (Q3W, 
6 weeks), one female was sacrificed moribund at 78.8 mg/kg, the highest dose level tested .  
The major toxicity findings in this moribund animal were observed in the intestine, hematopoietic system, skin, and kidney.  The cause of the moribundity appeared to be the deteriorated condition of the animal, which resulted from decreased body weight and food 
consumption, as well as bone marrow toxicity and intestinal toxicity.  The major findings 
of toxicity in the surviving animals were observed in the intestine at dose levels of 10 mg/kg and greater, and in the lung, testes, and skin at dose levels of 30 mg/kg and 
greater.  In addition, hematopoietic system toxicity, renal toxicity, and electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities (shortened PR interval and corrected QT interval [QTc] prolongation) were found at 78.8 mg/kg.  Except for the pulmonary and ski n toxicity 
(pigmentation), these findings tended to recover. 
Thus, as described above, the severely toxic dose in 10% of the animals (STD10) in a rat 
intermittent intravenous dosing study of DS-8201a was found to be greater than 
Protocol DS8201-A-J203 
Version 5.0, 03 Jul 2020 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 
Page 24 197 mg/kg.  In the monkey study, due to observed moribundity at 78.8 mg/kg and 
evidence of critical pulmonary toxicity (eg, interstitial inflammation and/or alveolar 
edema) in the surviving animals, it was concluded that the highest non- severely toxic dose 
is 30 mg/kg.  
In an intermittent intravenous dose toxicity study of MAAA-1181a (once weekly dosing for 4 weeks), findings in the lymphatic/hematopoietic system, intestinal tract, and cornea of the eye were observed at 3  mg/kg and greater in rats but there w as no deaths or 
moribundity up to 30 mg/kg.  Findings similar to those in rats were observed in cynomolgus monkeys at dose levels of 1 mg/kg and greater.  In addition, 1 female monkey died and 1 male monkey was sacrificed moribund at 12 mg/kg.  Although effects on the 
heart (focal  myocardial cell degeneration/necrosis) were found in the moribund male 
along with the above-mentioned toxicities, there were no abnormal heart findings in the 
female that died , even though both animals exhibited worsening clinical conditions 
associated wi th sustained decreases in food consumption, bone marrow toxicity, and 
intestinal toxicity.  These changes were considered to be the cause of death and moribundity.  The common adverse findings in both DS-8201a and MAAA-1181a studies 
were intestinal and lym phatic/hematopoietic system toxicities.  For DS -8201a treatment, 
pulmonary, testicular, skin, and renal toxicities were observed while heart, liver, and 
corneal toxicities were found only when MAAA-1181a was administered.   
In a human cross- reactivity stud y of DS -8201a with a panel of human tissues, DS-8201a-
related cell membrane staining was found only in the placenta.  In a cross- reactivity study 
of DS -8201a with selected cynomolgus monkey tissues (eg, brain, liver, kidney, lung, 
heart, intestines, lymphoid organs, testes , and skin), neither membranous nor cytoplasmic 
staining was noted in any tissues.   
In an in vitro  3T3 NRU phototoxicity study, MAAA-1181a was found to be phototoxic to 
Balb/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts.  However, in an in vivo single dose phototoxicity study of 
MAAA-1181a in pigmented rats, no phototoxic reaction was noted at 3 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. For additional nonclinical data supporting DS -8201a use in nonclinical studies, 
please refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
1.2.3. Clinical Experience 
DS8201-A-J101 is a Phase 1, 2-part, multicenter, non-randomized, open- label, multiple 
dose, first in human study of DS-8201a.  The Dose Escalation part (Part 1) was conducted 
to identify the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) or the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) 
of DS -8201a, and the Dose Expansion part (Part 2) is being conducted to confirm the 
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of DS-8201a at the MTD/RP2D.  DS -8201a is infused 
intravenously into each subject on Day 1 of each 21 day cy cle.  Subjects may  continue to 
receive DS -8201a Q3W at the discretion of the Investigators, until unacceptable toxicity, 
progressive disease, or withdrawal of consent. This study is on- going.  
Part 1 enrolled  subjects with advanced breast cancer and gastric or gastroesophageal 
junction adenocarcinoma.  Upon completion of Part 1 with determination of MTD/RP2D, Part 2 was started.  Part 2 consists of multiple cohorts:  subjects with T -DM1 -treated 
HER2 overexpressing breast cancer (Part 2a); trastuzumab -treated  HER2 overexpressing 
gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (Part 2b); HER2 low- expressing 
breast cancer (Part 2c); HER2 expressing other solid malignant tumor (Part 2d); and 
HER2 expressing breast cancer  (Part 2e).

Page 25 As of 8 June 2017, a total of 148 subjects, 24 in Part 1 and 124 in Part 2, have received 
DS-8201a in this study.  In Part 1, no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported and the 
MTD  was not reached.  Two doses were chosen for expansion in Part 2: 5.4 mg/kg and 
6.4 mg/kg .  Overall efficacy results from all dose cohorts in Part 1 demonstrate an objective 
response rate (ORR) of 34.8% (8 of 23) and disease control rate (DCR) of 91.3 % (21 of 23).  
Preliminary result from Part 2 demonstrates an ORR of 48.8% (41 of 84) and a DCR of 85.7% 
(72 of 84).   Among 148 subjects who have received DS-8201a across all parts and cohorts in 
the study, the adverse events ( AEs) that occurred in  more than 20% of subjects were nausea 
(65%), decreased appetite (53%), vomiting (34%), platelet count decreased (31%), anemia (28%), alopecia (26%), diarrhea (24%), constipation (24%), neutrophil count decreased (24%), 
white blood cell count decreased (24%), and malaise (22%).  The  majority of the AEs were of 
Grade 1 or 2 severity; 52 of 148 subjects (35.1%) experienced Grade 3 AEs and 10 subjects (6.8%) experienced Grade 4 AEs as the worst grade experienced .  
As of 10 April, 2 out of 5 
evaluable patients  with colorectal cancer  achieved  partial responses ( PRs) and 3 patients 
were stable diseases ( SDs). 
Refer to the current IB for a summary of preliminary clinical study data.  
1.2.4. Summary of Clinical Pharmacokinetics  
Preliminary PK data are available from 24 subjects in DS8201-A-J101 study .  The study is 
on-going.    
PK parameters of DS -8201a, total antibody and MAAA-1181a at 5.4, 6.4, and 8.0 mg/kg 
are shown in Table 1.1, Table 1.2, and Table 1.3.   
Systemic exposure (Cmax and AUClast) to DS -8201a over 3.2 mg/kg tended to increase 
greater than dose- proportional.  Terminal elimination half -life (T 1/2) also increased with 
dose, and flattened out in the 6.4 and 8.0 mg/kg cohorts.  Following a single intravenous 
administra tion of DS-8201a at 6.4 mg/kg, peak serum concentration (Cmax) of DS-8201a 
was achieved with a median Tmax of 2.16 h ours and mean T 1/2 of 7.33 days.  The volume 
of distribution at steady state for DS -8201a was approximately 45 mL/kg  to 70 mL/kg 
(approximating plasma/serum volume), suggesting that DS -8201a is primarily limited to 
the vascular compartment.  
The total antibody profile is similar to the PK  profile for DS -8201a, and the PK 
parameters of total antibody were comparable to those of DS -8201a.  
Serum MAAA- 1181a concentrations gradually increased and reached peak concentrations 
with longer time to reach Tmax (6 to  7 hours, median Tmax) compared to those for DS-
8201a.  The systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC  as reported  in ng/mL and ng day/mL, 
respectively) to MAAA -1181a was much lower than that of DS-8201a (as reported in 
μg/mL and μg day/mL, respectively), where DS -8201a exposure was >10,000-fold to that 
of MAAA-1181a.  The elimination (T 1/2) appeared to be similar to that of DS -8201a.  This 
reflects the intrinsic stability of the linker when DS -8201a is in circulation systemically.

of the 20 subjects with HER2-overexpressi ng colorectal  cancer . 
1.4. Risks and Benefits for Study Subjects 
Preliminary data suggests that DS -8201a demonstrated anti- tumor activity with a small  
number of HER2 -overexpressi ng colorectal cancer subjects  (see Section  1.2.3).  
Overall, the reported AEs in the DS8201-A-J101 clinical study (see Section  1.2.3) are 
consistent with the safety profile of DS-8201a, expected based on data available from 
nonclinical toxicology studies as well as drugs of similar class .  Considering the frequency 
and biological plausibility of the AEs reported, the following AEs have b een identified as 
adverse drug reactions associated with the use of DS -8201a : nausea, decreased appetite, 
vomiting, platelet count decreased, anaemia, alopecia, diarrhoea, neutrophil count 
decreased, white blood cell count decreased.  The majority of the treatment  emergent 
adverse events ( TEAEs ) were of Grade 1 and Grade 2 severity.   Based on clinical data 
and safety information available from other sources as of 13 Dec 2017 and the 2 fatal cases confirmed by the ILD AC as ILD and caused by DS -8201a, ILD and pneumonitis 
are added as adverse drug reactions associated with the use of DS -8201a.  S ubjects 
receiving DS -8201a should be monitored for signs and symptoms of any of the toxicities 
observed in nonclinical studies and to other products of the same class, which are 
discussed below.  
In nonclinical toxicology studies, the intestinal toxicity, hematopoietic system toxicity, 
pulmonary toxicity, testicular toxicity, skin toxicity, and renal toxicity were found in 
association with the administration of DS -8201a.  In addition to these toxicities, similar to 
other products of the same class, the possibility of cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, embryo-
fetal toxicity, or corneal toxicity occurring in subjects receiving DS -8201a cannot be 
excluded.    Ophthalmologic safety monitoring, which includes visual acuity, slit lamp exam, and fundoscopy will also be part of the overall evaluation.  These assessments will be performed at baseline and at specific intervals described in the protocol and at the end 
of treatment, w hen an additional exam will also be performed.  Moreover, at the discretion 
of the investigator , ophthalmologic testing can be performed at any time during the study.  
For the DS-8201a clinical program, based on the available pre- clinical data, review of the 
cumulative literature, reported toxicities for the same class of agents and biological 
plausibility, the following events are considered to be adverse events of special interest (AESI): Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, Cardiotoxicity (cardiac -related events 
including QT Prolongation and Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) Decrease), and 
Infusion related reactions.   
ILD/pneumonitis should be ruled out if a subject develops an acute onset of new or 
worsening pulmonary or other related signs/symptoms such as dyspnea, cough or fever.  If 
the AE is suspected to be ILD/pneumonitis, study drug should be interrupted pending diagnostic evaluation, which should include high resolution CT and pulmonologist 
consultation.  As soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected, corticosteroid treatment should be 
started promptly as per clinical treatment guidelines.  
If the AE is confirmed to be ILD/pneumonitis, follow the management guidance as 
described in Section 5.4.  An ILD Adjudication Committee (AC) is being established for the program and will review all cases of potential ILD/pneumonitis on an ongoing basis.

Page 29 LVEF will be measured by either echocardi ogram ( ECHO) or multigated acquisition 
(MUGA) scan.  All ECHOs/MUGAs will be evaluated by the Investigator or delegated 
physician for monitoring cardiac function.  Troponin will be measured at screening and 
after each infusion and as needed based on subjec t reported cardiac symptoms.  Triplicate 
ECGs will be performed and standard ECG parameters will be measured, including RR, PR, QT intervals, and QRS duration.   
As with any therapeutic antibodies, there is a possibility of infusion -related reactions, and 
immune responses causing allergic or anaphylactic reactions with administration of DS -
8201a.  Immune response causing allergic or anaphylactic reactions is considered to be an 
event of special interest for DS -8201a clinical program.  Subjects receiving DS-8201a 
should be monitored vital signs, physical examination, monitor signs and symptoms of infusion related reaction: chills, fever, hypotension, skin rash, etc. 
Additional safety assessments should be conducted as needed, at the investigator’s 
discretion.  Hepatotoxicity, embryo -fetal toxicity, visual disturbances/corneal toxicity, or 
phototoxicity occurring in subjects receiving DS-8201a also cannot be excluded.   
Based on the efficacy and safety data observed in the nonclinical studies, the current 
clinical experience of the Phase 1 study and the information from other products of the 
same class, the benefit -risk balance supports further clinical development of DS -8201a in 
this patient population.  For up to date assessments of risks and benefits to subjects, please 
refer to the current IB for DS -8201a.

Page 32 3. STUDY DESIGN 
3.1. Overa ll Design  
3.1.1. Overview  
This is a multicenter, open- label, 3-cohort, Phase 2 study to investigate the safety and 
efficacy of DS -8201a in  HER2 -expressing advanced  colorectal cancer subjects .  
Cohort A is a single arm study and will enroll approximately 50 subjects with HER2-
positive ( immnohistochemistry [ IHC] 3+ or IHC 2+/ in situ hybridization [ ISH] +), 
advanced colorectal cancer.  Sponsor monitors the data after at least 20 subjects completed 
tumor assessment  at 12 weeks in Cohort A.  Cohorts B and C will be opened  depending on 
the assessment of benefit and risk observed in the program, and Sponsor will inform to the 
study sites when Cohorts B and C are opened.  
Cohort B will enroll approximately 20 subjects with HER2 IHC 2+/ISH – advanced colorectal cancer.  
Cohort C will enroll approximately 20 subjects with HER2 IHC 1+ advanced colorectal 
cancer .
  
DS-8201a will be administered as a sterile IV solution at a dose of the 6.4 mg/kg every 3 
weeks . 
After  obtaining a signed informed consent form ( ICF)  for tissue screening from a subject, 
the tumor samples will be submitted to central laboratory to examine HER2 status for 
screening.  The subject whose ICF for study entry will be registered to interactive web 
response system (IXRS).  
The study treatment w ill be continued according to the dosing criteria to derive clinical 
benefit in the absence of withdrawal of subject consent, progressive disease ( PD), or 
unacceptable toxicity.  If the study treatment is delayed more than 4 weeks from the 
planned date of administration, the subject will be withdrawn from the study (see Section 
5.4).

Page 33 Figure  3.1: Study Design Schema of DS8201-A-J203 
 
 
 
3.1.2. Duration of the Study  
Enrollment is planned to occur over approximately 18 months, and  treatment and  follow-
up (F/U) is projected to be completed  approximately  6 months thereafter .  Thus, the 
anticipated duration of the study is at least 2 4 months. 
Sponsor may terminate the study at any time and study termination may also be requested  
by (a) competent authority(ies).   
3.1.3. Duration of Subject Participation  
Each cycle of treatment of DS -8201a will be 21 days. The number of treatment cycles in 
this study  is not fixed .  Upon commencing study treatment, subjects may continue 
receiving the study drug until the occurrence of any of the events defined i n Section 5.7.  
After discontinuation from study treatment, all subjects, regardless of whether they 
discontinued prior to or subsequent to disease progression, may be contacted every 3 months until death or until F/U  data collection is no longer needed (at the sponsor’s 
discretion), to obtain information about subsequent treatment(s) and survival status. 
3.2. Discussion of Study Design  
It is estimated that approximately 90 subjects will be enrolled in the  study in North 
America, Japan , and European Union ( EU).  
3.3. Selection of Do se and Usage  
The dose selection was based on the preliminary clinical data from Study DS8201-A-J101.  
DS-8201a was administered at 0.8 mg/kg to 8.0 mg/kg Q3W in the Phase 1 study and the 
MTD was not reached up to 8.0 mg/kg.   In the 8.0 mg/kg cohort, 2 of 3 subjects 
HER2 = human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 , IHC = immunohistochemistry , ISH = in situ 
hybridization , IXRS = interactive web/voice response system  Cohort B and C are opened after Sponsor ’s notification to the study sites.

methods of contraception include:  
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception 
associated with inhibition of ovulation: 
− Oral 
− Intravaginal 
− Transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation: 
− Oral 
− Injectable  
− Implantable 
• Intrauterine device  
• Intrauterine hormone- releasing system  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized partner  
• Complete and true sexual abstinence defined as abstinence when it is in line 
with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.  Subjects in this study 
should refrain from heterosexual intercourse during and upon completion of the 
study and for at least 7 months for females and 4 months for males after the last dose of study drug.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the 
duration of exposure to study drug, and withdrawal are not ac ceptable methods 
of contraception. 
Non-child -bearing potential defined as pre- menopausal females with a documented 
tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases, a blood sample with simultaneous 
follicle -stimulating hormone >40 mIU/mL and estradiol <40 pg/mL [<14 7 pmol/L] 
is confirmatory).  Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose 
menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception 
methods outlined for women of child-bearing potential if they wish to continue 
their HRT during the study.  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment.  For most forms 
of HRT, at least 2  to 4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the 
blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT.  Following 
confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during 
the study without use of a contraceptive method.

Page 41 5.2.3. Preparation 
The drug for IV infusion is prepared by dilution of the required volume of the drug 
product calculated based on the subject’s body weight.  Prepared medicinal solutions 
should be used immediately. The preparation will be conducted in accordance with the pharmacy instructions provided by the sponsor. Procedures for proper handling and 
disposal of anticancer drugs should be followed in compliance with the standard operating 
proced ures (SOPs) of the study site. Refer to the pharmacy instruction  for detailed 
information about preparation and administration of DS-8201a. 
5.2.4. Administration  
The study drug will be administered every 3 weeks at the 
6.4 mg/kg .  The initial dose of 
DS-8201a will be infused intravenously into each subject for approximately 90 minutes . If 
there is no infusion- related reaction after the initial dose, the second and thereafter  dose of 
DS-8201a will be infused intravenously into each subject for approximately 30 minutes. 
The subject’s weight at screening (baseline) will be used to calculate the initial dose.   If 
during the course of the treatment, the subject’s weight changes by more than  10% of the 
baseline weight, the subject’s  dose will be recalculated  based on the subject’s updated 
weight . 
5.2.5. Storage 
Drug supplies must be stored in a secure, limited access storage area under the storage 
conditions listed below: 
• Stored at 2 °C to 8°C (protected from light) 
If storage conditions are not maintained per specified requirements, the sponsor or 
contract research organization  (CRO ) should be contacted. 
5.2.6. Drug Accountability  
When a study drug shipment is received, the investigator  or designee will check the 
amount and condition of the drug check the appropriateness of the label, drug expiration 
date and sign the Receipt of Shipment Form provided by sponsor.  The Receipt of Shipment Form should be signed and the original Form will be retained at the site.  In 
addition, the investigator  or designee shall contact the sponsor as soon as possible if there 
is a problem with the shipment.  
Drug 
Accountability  Record will be provided for the study drug.  The record must be kept 
current and should contain the dates and quantities of study drug received, subject’s information  (the site subject identifier  and the subject number) for whom the study drug

Not Applicable. 
5.4. Dose Modifications for Managing Adverse Events  
The investigator will evaluate which toxicities are attributable to DS -8201a and adjust the 
dose of DS-8201a as recommended below.  All dose modifications (interruption, reduction and/or discontinuation) should be based on the worst preceding  toxicity ( Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTC AE] version 5.0).  Specific criteria for 
interruption, reinitiating , dose reduction and/or discontinuation of DS-8201a are listed in 
Section 5.4.  All interruptions or modifications must be recorded on the case report form 
(CRF).  Appropriate clinical experts should be consulted as deemed necessary.  
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 events, monitoring (including local laboratory  tests when 
appropriate) should be performed at intervals no greater than 7 days until AE is 
determined to be resolving or subject is discontinued at end of treatment. 
Prophylactic or supportive treatment for expected toxicities, including management of 
study- drug induced adverse events will be as per the treating physician’s discretion and 
institutional guidelines.  
Dose Reduction Guidelines: 
NOTE: There will be no dose modifications for Grade 1 or Grade 2 AEs unless specified 
in Table 5.2. 
Two dose reductions will be permitted.  The adjustment for a reduced dosing of DS-8201a 
is as shown in Table 5.1. 
Table 5.1: Dose Reduction Levels of DS -8201a 
Starting Dose  Dose Level −1 Dose Level −2 
6.4 mg/kg  5.4 mg/kg  4.4 mg/kg  
Once the dose of DS-8201a has been reduced because of toxicity, all subsequent cycles 
should be administered at that lower dose level unless further dose reduction is required.  
More than 2 dose reductions are not allowed and the subject will be withdrawn from the study treatment if further toxicity meeting the requirement for dose reduction occurs . DS-
8201a dose increases are not allowed in the study.  
Dose Interruption and Modification/Toxicity Management Guidelines: 
A dose can be delayed for up to 28 days  (49 days from the last infusion date ) from the 
planned date of administration.  If a subject is assessed as requiring a dose delay of longer 
than 28 days, the subject will be withdrawn from the study. 
Treatment cycles for a subject for whom DS -8201a dosing is temporarily withheld for any 
reason may have future cycles scheduled based on the date of the last DS -8201a dose. 
All confirmed or suspected SARS -CoV-2 infection events must be recorded in the eCRF.  
Please refer to Appendix 17.5 for additional information on dose modification.

Pulmonary Toxicity  If a subject develops radiographic changes potentially consistent with 
ILD/pnumonitis  or develops an acute onset of new or worsening 
pulmonary or other related signs/symptoms such as dyspnea, cough or fever, rule out ILD/pneumonitis.  If the AE is confirmed to have an etiology other than ILD/pneumonitis, follow the management guidance outlined in the “ Other Non -Laboratory 
Adverse Events” in the dose modification section below.  
If the AE is suspected to be ILD/pneumonitis, treatment with study drug should be interrupted pending further evaluations.  
Evaluations should include:  
• High resolution CT  
• Pulmonologist consultation  (Infectious Disease consultation as 
clinically indicated)  
• Blood culture and CBC. Other blood tests could be considered as 
needed  
• Consider bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage if clinically 
indicated and feasible  
• Pulmonary function tests and pulse oximetry (SpO 2) 
• Arterial blood gases if clinically indicated  
• One blood sample collection for PK analysis as soon as 
ILD/pneumonitis is suspected, if feasible.  
Other tests could be considered, as needed.  
If the AE is confirmed to be  ILD/pneumonitis, follow the ILD/pneumonitis  
management guidance as outlined below.  
All events of ILD /pnumonitis  regardless of severity or seriousness will be 
followed until resolution including after drug discontinuation.  
Grade 1  The administration of DS-8201a must be interrupted for any 
ILD/pnumonitis  events regardless of grade. 
 
• Monitor and closely follow -up in 2 to 7 days for onset of clinical 
symptoms and pulse oximetry . 
• Consider follow -up imaging in 1 -2 weeks (or as clinically indicated).  
• Consider starting systemic steroids (e.g. at least 0.5 mg/kg/day 
prednisone or equivalent) until improvement, followed by gradual 
taper over at least 4 weeks.  
• If worsening of diagnostic observations despite initiation of 
corticosteroids, then follow Grade 2 guidelines.* 
 
For Grade 1 events, DS -8201a can be restarted only if the event is fully 
resolved to Grade 0:  
• If resolved in ≤ 28 days from day of onset, maintain dose  
• If resolved in > 28 days from day of onset, reduce dose 1 level  
However, if the event G rade 1 ILD /pnumonitis occurs beyond cycle day 
22 and has not resolved within 49 days from the last infusion, the drug 
should be discontinued.  
* If subject  is asymptomatic, then subject  should still be considered as 
Grade 1 even if steroid treatment is given

DS-8201a will be administered IV only to subjects participating in the study and under the 
supervision of clinical study personnel at the study site.  Therefore, treatment compliance 
will be guaranteed as long as the subject attends each visit for administration o f the study 
treatment.   Start and stop date/ time of injection , amount of drug administered, and reason 
for change or interruption ( if applicable)  must be recorded  in medical record  by clinical 
study personnel.  These data will be recorded in the electronic case report f orm (eCRF ). 
5.6. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications used from the time the subject signs the informed consent form for study 
participation  the F/U  40 days visit (±  7 days) after the last administration of DS -8201a will 
be recorded.  Prophylactic treatment for the study treatment and a ll concomitant 
medications will be recorded in the eCRF.  
With the exception of medications that are under investigation in the study (e.g. standard 
of care, comparators, or combination therapies, the following medications and products will be prohibited during the treatment period. The Sponsor must be notified if a subject  
receives any of these during the study.  : 
1. Other anticancer therapy, including cytotoxic, targeted agents, immunotherapy, antibody, retinoid, or anti- cancer hormonal treatment  [concurrent use of hormones

Page 54 6. STUDY PROCEDURES  
A study visit schedule in tabular format is provided in Section  18. Obtain a signed and 
dated ICF before any study -related procedures or assessments are conducted.  A separate 
tissue screening ICF may be used to obtain consent to send the sample to the central 
laboratory. 
After obtaining informed consent, the investigator or desig nee assign a site subject 
identifier.  
Informed consent for pharmacogenomics study will be obtained separately. 
6.1. Tissue Screening  
To determine eligibility, subjects must meet tumor biomarker criteria.   
Note: A separate tissue screening ICF may be used to obtain consent to send the sample to 
the central laboratory.   Subjects may continue on prior therapy while tissue testing takes 
place.   
Please refer to the study laboratory manual for required tumor sample specifications and shipping instructions.  
The following procedures will be conducted: 
• Obtain a signed and dated written consent from the subject to collect tissue 
and/or perform a biopsy as needed. 
• Obtain adequate archival or recent tumor tissue sample for HER2 testing.  
Approximately 10 slides or  adequate paraffin -embedded tissue blocks of 
formalin -fixed tissue specimens can be submitted for this analys is.   
• Send the sample to the Central Laboratory to confirm HER2 status 
• If a tumor biopsy is needed, record any SAEs directly related to tissue screening procedure (ie, tumor biopsy). 
• For subjects who sign only the Informed Consent Form for tissue screening, report only serious adverse events (SAEs) directly related to tissue screening 
procedure (ie, tumor biopsy). Unless documentation of other AEs is required 
by local law, only SAEs directly related to tumor biopsy will be recorded 
during tissue screening. 
6.2. Screening  
Obtain a signed and dated ICF before any study- related procedures or assessments are 
conducted.  After eligibility is met, the subject will be registered to IXRS as eligible and assigned to the cohort.  Subject who is ineligible after obtaining ICF for study entry should also be registered as ineligible in  the IXRS.  
The following activities and/or assessments will be performed during the scr eening period:  
• Obtain fresh tumor biopsy specimen from a  subject.  Tumor tissue will be sent 
to the central laboratory for an exploratory biomarker analysis.  Fresh biopsy is

Proprietary and Confidential 
Page 55 not needed if a sample that was obtained after the most recent anti -cancer 
therapy is already available.   Further details will be provided in the laboratory 
manual.  
Within 28 days before enrollment (study treatment)   
• Perform a HIV antibody test .  It is tested as  required by local regulations or 
IRB/ECs.  
• Perform hepatitis B surface antigen test, and hepatitis C antibody test.   
• Ophthalmologic assessments.  The assessments will include visual acuity testing, slit lamp examination, and fundoscopy.  
• Perform an ECHO or MUGA (note: the same test must be used for the subject 
throughout the study).  
• Perform tumor assessment by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and any other 
sites of disease.  A CT or MRI of the brain is to be included for a ll subjects.   
NOTE: To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to 
estimate the overall tumor burden at baseline and use it as comparator for 
subsequent measurement.  Therefore, all lesions (target and non- target) have to 
be assess ed at Screening according to RECIST version 1.1 ( Section  17.3).  
The following activities and/or assessments will be performed during the screening period within 14 days before enrollment (study treatment) except as indicated:  
• Obtain demographics (eg, birth date, sex, race, ethnicity),  medical and surgical 
history, including all previous, now resolved, significant medical conditions, date of diagnosis, extent of disease, disease staging,  Primary tumor site 
(rectum, sigmoid, descending, t ransverse, ascending, c ecum) , previous cancer 
therapies (including prior radiation therapy) , historical RAS  (KRAS/  
neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog) status , BRAF status , 
microsatellite instability status, historical HER2 status  and oncology surgical 
history. 
• Perform a complete physical examination (see Section  9.11) including weight 
and height. 
• Assess AEs throughout the screening period (from the time the subject signed 
the ICF  for study entry ). 
• Record concomitant medications (from the time the subject signed the ICF)  
• Obtain vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature) and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO
2). 
• Assess functional status using the ECOG PS Scale ( Section  17.2).

Page 56 remain the same throughout the course of a subject’s time on study.  An 
additional sample should be submitted for central lab troponin- T testing.  
• Perform urinalysis test  
• Perform a 12 -lead ECG in triplicate.  See Section  11.4.3.4 for corrected QTc.   
Average of the triplicates should be checked for screening. 
*: ECGs will be taken in close succession, a few minutes apart, after the 
subject has been in a supine/semi- recumbent position. 
• Review inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
Within 72 hours prior to enrollment ( study treatment ) 
• Obtain a serum or urine sample for pregnancy testing in women of childbearing 
potential.  Test must be confirmed within 72 hours prior to enrollment (study 
treatment ).  For postmenopausal subjects (no childbearing potential, as 
indicated by an elapse of at least 12 months after the last menstruation) or subjects who have no possibility of pregnancy due to sterilization surgery, etc., 
no pregnancy test will be required.  Subjects who have been amenorrheic for 12 months or longer for medical reasons other than sterilization surgery (eg, 
effect of medication) will be regarded as women of child -bearing potential and 
required to undergo the pregnancy test.  A positive urine pregnancy will be 
confirmed using blood test.

Page 66 8.2. Biomarker  Assessments  
In this study, biomarker analyses will be used to investigate the effect of the DS -8201a at 
the molecular and cellular level as well as to determine how changes in the markers may 
relate to exposure and clinical outcomes.   The sample collection information as required 
should be recorded on the eCRF page(s) and central laboratory requisition form(s).  
Detailed instructions for the collection, handling, and shipping of biomarker samples are 
outlined in the laboratory manual.  Biomarker samples will be shipped to a central 
laboratory. 
8.2.1. Pharmacodynamic A ssessments  
8.2.1.1. Pharmacodynamic A ssessments in Blood S amples  
Pharmacodynamic biomarkers will be analyzed with the intent of monitoring the anti-
tumor impact of treatment with DS -8201a.  The pharmacodynamic biomarkers are 
HER2ECD and  cfDNA.  Blood samples will be collected for HER2ECD analysis  at the 
time points specified in  Table 8.4, and cfDNA analysis at the time points specified in

Page 67 8.2.1.3. Additional Exploratory B iomarker A ssessments 
During the study, in addition to the biomarkers specified above, exploratory biomarker 
research may be conducted on any samples.  These studies would extend the search for 
other potential biomarkers relevant to the effects of DS -8201a, and/or the resistance to the 
treatment.  This may include the development of ways to detect, monitor or treat cancer.  These additional investigations would be dependent upon clinical outcome, reagent and 
sample availability.  I f the patient agrees, the remaining samples  (tumor tissues, blood and 
plasma) may be stored for up to 15 years. 
8.2.1.4. Disclosure of the Results of Additional B iomarker A ssessments  
Because the nature and value of future additional biomarker assessments is unknown at  
this time, any results obtained from research involving samples will not be disclosed to the 
subject or investigators now or in the future. 
8.3. SARS -CoV-2 Serum samples collection  
Portion of HER2ECD blood sample from each subject who provides consent will be used 
for future central lab analysis for SARS -CoV- 2 testing. Samples will be sent to the central 
laboratory and stored until the tests will become available.  
 
8.4. Pharmacogenomic  Analysis 
8.4.1. Genomic or Genetic Analysis  
A single blood sample for pharmacogenomics analysis will be collected from each subject, 
who consented to this test, on Day 1 of Cycle 1.  Participation in this part of the study is optional for all subjects. 
The following procedures will be used for the long- term preservation (ban king) of DNA 
specimens extracted from subjects ʼ blood samples.  Pharmacogenomic samples may be 
analyzed for genes involved in absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, safety, 
and efficacy of DS -8201a.  Additionally, samples may be analyzed for genes involved in 
DS-8201a related signaling pathways, or to examine diseases or physiologic processes 
related to DS -8201a.  DNA samples will not be immortalized or sold to anyone.  This 
information may be useful in increasing the knowledge of differences among individuals 
in the way they respond to the study drug. 
Specimen shipping and handling details will be included in the laboratory manual. 
8.4.1.1. Disclosure of the Results of Genomic or Genetic Analysis  
Because the nature and value of future pharmacogenomic res earch cannot be known at this 
time, any results obtained from research involving pharmacogenomic samples will not be 
disclosed to the subject or investigators now or in the future. 
8.4.1.2. Storage and Disposal of Specimens for Genomic or Genetic Banking and 
Analys is 
Samples will be retained until exhausted or until the Sponsor requests disposition.

Page 68 If the subject withdraws consent, the banked blood samples will be promptly managed 
regarding proper disposition.  However, the data will not be discarded if genetic an alysis 
has been completed before the subject withdraws consent. 
8.5. Anonymization of Samples  
The samples should be submitted to the courier without any personal information such as 
name that can be used to identify individuals.  The samples should be identified by  a 
unique “ site subject identifier. ”  The correspondence list which can link the sit e subject 
identifier and the personal information should be kept strictly at the study center and the 
linkage between the site subject identifier and personal information should not be 
informed the courier or the central laboratory.  The samples and any ot her components 
from the cells collected for the additional biomarker assessment and pharmacogenomic 
analysis will be stored in the central laboratory up to 15 years. 
If the subject withdraws consent, samples should be disposed of by the following 
procedure depending on the location of the tumor samples.  Obtained data will not be discarded if the assessments have already been performed before consent was withdrawn.  
If samples are temporarily stored at the study center, the investigator will identify the 
samples of the relevant subject and dispose of them.  If samples are stored at the central 
laboratory, the investigator will notify the sponsor about the identification number of the 
subject who withdrew consent.  The sponsor will instruct the central laboratory to dispose 
of the relevant samples.  Eventually, after the end of the sample storage period, the central laboratory will dispose of all samples as instructed by the sponsor. 
8.6. Sample Storage and Disposal  
The samples and any other components from the cel ls collected for the additional 
biomarker assessment and pharmacogenomic analysis will be stored up to 15 years . 
If the subject withdraws consent, samples should be disposed of by the following 
procedure depending on the location of the tumor samples.  Ob tained data will not be 
discarded if the assessments have already been performed before consent was withdrawn.  
If samples are temporarily stored at the study site  
• The investigator will identify the samples of the relevant subject and dispose of 
them.  
If samples are stored at the central laboratory  
• The investigator will notify the sponsor about the identification number of the 
subject who withdrew consent.  The sponsor will instruct the central laboratory 
to dispose of the relevant samples.   
Eventually, after the end of the sample storage period, the central laboratory will dispose of all samples as instructed by the sponsor. 
8.7. Immunogenicity (Anti-drug Antibody)  
Blood samples for ADA analyses will be collected at the time points specified in Section  6.

Page 70 9. SAFETY EVALUATION AND REPORTING  
9.1. Assessment of Safety Endpoint(s)  
Safety parameters will include SAEs, TEAEs, ECHO/MUGA findings; ophthalmologic 
findings, physical examination findings (including ECOG PS), vital sign measurements, 
standard clinical laboratory parameters (blood chemistry and hematology),  ADA, and 
ECG parameters.  Adverse events will be categorized using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA).  Adverse events and abnormal l aboratory test results, if 
applicable, will be graded using National Cancer Institute ( NCI) -CTCAE version 5.0. 
9.2. Adverse Event Collection and Reporting 
All clinical AEs (see Section  9.4.1 for definitions) occurring after the subject signs the 
Informed Consent Form for study participation and up to 40 (+ 7) days  after the last dose 
(ie, the F/U  period), whether observed by the Investigator or reported by the subject, will 
be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF page.  For subjects who sign only the Informed Consent Form for tissue screening, report only serious adverse events (SAEs) directly related to tissue screening procedure (ie, tumor biopsy). Unless documentation of other 
AEs is required by local law, only SAEs directly related to tumor biopsy will be recorded 
during tissue screening.  Medical conditions (including laboratory values/vital signs that are out of range) that were diagnosed or known to exist prior to Informed Consent will be 
recorded as part of medical history.   
All AEs, SAEs, and events of special interest  are to be reported according to the 
procedures in Section 9.5.   
All clinical laboratory results, vital signs, and ECG results or findings should be appraised 
by the  Investigator to determine their clinical significance.  Isolated abnormal laboratory 
results, vital sign findings, or ECG findings ( ie, not part of a reported diagnosis) should be 
reported as AEs if they are symptomatic, lead to study drug discontinuation, dose reduction, require corrective treatment, or constitute an AE in the Investigator’s clinical judgment. 
At each visit, the Investigator will determine whether any AEs have occurred by 
evaluating the subject.  Adverse events may be directly observed, r eported spontaneously 
by the subject or by questioning the subject at each study visit.  Subjects should be 
questioned in a general way, without asking about the occurrence of any specific 
symptoms.  The Investigator must assess all AEs to determine seriou sness, severity, and 
causality, in accordance with the definitions in Section 9.4.   The Investigator’s assessment 
must be clearly documented in the s ite’s source documentation with the Investigator’s 
signature.   
Always report the diagnosis as the AE or SAE term.  When a diagnosis is unavailable, 
report the primary sign or symptom as the AE or SAE term with additional details 
included in the narrative until the diagnosis becomes available.  If the signs and symptom s 
are distinct and do not suggest a common diagnosis, report them as individual entries of 
AE or SAE.

Version 5.0, 03 Jul 2020 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 
Page 71 For events that are serious due to hospitalization, the reason for hospitalization must be 
reported as the serious adverse event (diagnosis or symptom requiring hospitalization).  A 
procedure is not an AE or SAE, but the reason for the procedure may be an AE or SAE.  Pre-planned (prior to signing the Informed Consent Form) procedures or treatments 
requiring hospitalization for pre-existing conditions that do not worsen in severity should not be reported as SAEs (see Section  9.4.2 for Definitions).   
For deaths, the underlying or immediate cause of death should always be reported as an 
SAE.  Disease progression is a study endpoint and consequently, should not be reported as 
an AE/SAE.  However, when a subject dies from PD with no other immediate causes, “disease progression” should be reported as an SA E.  
Any serious, untoward event that may occur subsequent to the reporting period that the Investigator assesses as related to study drug should also be reported and managed as an SAE.  
9.3. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Additional relevant information rega rding the AESI’s except infusion- related reactions 
specified below for the DS- 8201a clinical program will be collected through the targeted 
questionnaires, in- built within the eCRF in the study clinical database.  
For broad surveillance of LVEF decrease, relevant AEs under the MedDRA SMQs of 
Cardiac Failure and Miocardial Infraction (MI) are included for enhanced data collection; 
additional data for these AEs are collected via TQs of heart failure and MI.  
For broad surveillance of ILD, selected 42 Preferred Terms  (PT) [all from the ILD 
Standard MedDRA Query (SMQ)] plus 2 PTs of acute respiratory failure and respiratory 
failure are included for enhanced data collections. 
9.3.1. Interstitial Lung Disease /Pneumonitis   
Clinical Summary:  
ILD/pneumonitis is considered an important identified risk based on a comprehensive 
cumulative review of the available safety data from the DS8201 -A-J101 clinical study as 
well as the results of potential ILD/pneumonitis cases reviewed by the independent ILD 
Adjudication Committee (AC), available data from recent epidemiology/literature, 
biological plausibility, and safety information from drugs of similar class.  Refer to the current IB for a summary of preliminary clinical study data.  
Management Guidance:   
ILD/pneumonitis should be ruled out if a subject develops radiographic changes potentially consistent with ILD/pneumonitis  or develops an acute onset of new or 
worsening pulmonary or other related signs/symptoms such as dyspnea, cough or fever.   If the AE is confirmed to have an etiol ogy other than ILD/pneumonitis, follow the 
management guidance outlined in Section  5.4. 
If the AE is suspected to be ILD/pneumonitis, treatment with study drug should be interrupted pending further evaluation s. Evaluations should include high resolution CT, 
pulmonologist consul tation  (infectious disease consultation as clinically indicated), blood 
culture and CBC (other blood tests could be considered as needed), bronchoscopy and 
Protocol DS8201-A-J203

Page 72 bronchoalveolar lavage if clinically indicated and feasible should be considered, 
pulmonary function tests and pulse oximetry (SpO 2), arterial blood gases  if clinically 
indicated , and one blood sample collection for PK analysis as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is 
suspected, if feasible. Other tests could be considered, as needed. . 
If the AE is confirmed to be  ILD/pneumonitis, follow the management guidance in 
Section  5.4.  
All events of ILD/pneumonitis regardless of severity or seriousness will be followed until 
resolution including after drug discontinuation. 
9.3.1.1. Interstitial Lung Disease Adjudication Committee  
An independent ILD Adjudication Committee for the DS-8201a program is responsible 
for reviewing all cases of potential ILD/pneumonitis. To ensure adequate and relevant 
independent evaluation, systematic additional data collection will be conducted for all cases that will be brought for adjudication. These additional data collection will cover a more in -depth relevant medical history (eg smoking, radiation, COPD and other chronic 
lung conditions), diagnostic evaluation, treatment and outcome of the event. This data collection will be triggered for adverse events reported using selected 42 PT  [all from the 
ILD Standard MedDRA Query (SMQ) ] plus 2 PTs of acute respiratory failure and 
respiratory failure .   
9.3.2. LVEF Decrease  
Clinical Summary:  
LVEF decrease in association with DS -8201a is considered to be an important potential 
risk based on the available pre- clinical data, literature and  available safety information for 
drugs of similar  class.   Refer to the current IB for a summary of preliminary clinical trial 
data.  
Management Guidance:  
LVEF will be measured by either ECHO or MUGA scan.  All ECHOs/MUGAs, will be evaluated by the investigator or delegated physician for monitoring cardiac function.  
Troponin will be measured at screening and after each infusi on and EOT as needed based 
on subject reported cardiac signs or symptoms  suggesting congestive heart failure, 
myocardial infarction, or other causes of cardiac myocyte necrosis.  If ECG is abnormal, follow institutional guidelines.  
Triplicate ECGs will be performed and standard ECG parameters will be measured, 
including RR, PR, QT intervals, and QRS duration.  All ECGs must be evaluated by 
investigator or delegated physician for the presence of abnormalities.  Whether or not 
measurem ent is performed, date performed, results, and findings for each parameter will 
be recorded in the eCRF.  
9.4. Adverse Event  
9.4.1. Definition of Adverse Event  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and that  does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship 
Protocol DS8201-A-J203 
Version 5.0, 03 Jul 2020 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 
Page 73 with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of  a medicinal product, whether considered related to the 
medicinal product (International Council for Harmonisation [ ICH] E2A Guideline.  
Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Oct 1994). 
It is the responsibility  of Investigators, based on their knowledge and experience, to 
determine those circumstances or abnormal clinical lab oratory findings which should be 
considered adverse events . 
9.4.2. Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrenc e that at any dose:  
• Results in death, 
• Is life -threatening,  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or  
• Is an important medical event.  
Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were mor e severe (ICH E2A Guideline.  
Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Oct 1994). 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, suc h as important medical events that may not 
be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  Examples include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, and blood 
dyscrasias or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Note:   
• Procedures are not AEs or SAE s, but the reason for the procedure may be an 
AE or SAE.    
• Pre-planned (prior to signing the Informed Consent Form) procedures or 
treatment s requiring hospitalizations for pre-existing conditions that  do not 
worsen in severity are not SAEs. 
9.4.3. Severity Assessment  
All AEs will be graded (1 to 5; see below) according to the latest NCI -CTCAE version 
5.0: 
• Grade 1 Mild AE 
Protocol DS8201-A-J203 
Version 5.0, 03 Jul 2020 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 
Page 74 • Grade 2 Moderate AE  
• Grade 3 Severe AE  
• Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
• Grade 5 Death related to AE  
Severity versus Seriousness:  Severity is used to describe the intensity of a specific event 
while the event itself, howev er, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as 
severe headache).  Seriousness of an event is based upon a universal and global 
Regulatory definition for reporting SAEs to regulatory agencies.  For example, Grade 4 
(life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated) is assessed based on unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE, and these criteria may be different from those 
used for the assessment of AE seriousness.  An AE assessed as Grade 4 may or may not be 
assessed as  serious based on the seriousness criteria.  Overall, the severity of an event may 
be graded by the investigator as Grade 1 or 2, but if the subject presents to the emergency 
facility for evaluation and is hospitalized overnight for observation that immedi ately 
makes the event serious based upon hospitalization without regard to the investigator 
assessment of severity.  
9.4.4. Causality Assessment  
The Investigator should assess causal relationship between an adverse event and the study drug on the basis of his/her clinical judgment and the following definitions.  The causality assessment must be made based on the available information and can be updated as new 
information becomes available.  
• Related:  
− The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study d rug 
administration, and cannot be reasonably explained by the subject’s clinical 
state or other factors ( eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, and 
concomitant medications).  
or 
− The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug 
administra tion, and is a known reaction to the drug under study or its 
chemical group, or is predicted by known pharmacology. 
• Not Related:  
− The AE does not follow a reasonable sequence from study drug administration, or can be reasonably explained by the subject’s cl inical 
state or other factors ( eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, and 
concomitant medications).  
9.4.5. Action Taken Regarding Study Drug (s) 
• Dose Not Changed: No change in study drug dosage was made. 
• Drug Withdrawn: The study drug was permanently stopped.  
• Dose Reduced: The dosage of study drug was reduced.  
Protocol DS8201-A-J203 
Version 5.0, 03 Jul 2020 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 
Page 75 • Drug Interrupted: The study drug was temporarily stopped. 
9.4.6. Other Action Taken for Event  
• None. 
− No treatment was required.  
• Medication required. − Prescription and/or OTC medication was required to treat the adverse event.  
• Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization required. − Hospitalization was required or prolonged due to the AE , whether or not 
medication was required.  
• Other.  
9.4.7. Adverse Event Outcome 
• Recovered/Resolved  
− The subject fully recovered from the adverse event with no residual effect 
observed. 
• Recovering/Resolving 
− The adverse event  improved but has not fully resolved. 
• Not Recovered/Not Resolved − The adverse event itself is still present and observable.  
• Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae  
− The residual effects of the adverse event are still present and observable.  
− Include sequelae/residual effects.  
• Fatal  
− Fatal should be used when death is a direct outcome of the adverse event. 
• Unknown 
9.5. Serious Adverse Events and Adverse Event of Special Interest  
Reporting -Procedure For Investigators  
All AEs, SAEs, events of special interest , and medication errors including overdose will 
be reported in the CRF. 
Serious events that are also efficacy endpoints ( eg, PD) will be exempted from SAE 
processing and expedited reporting.  Disease progression should not be reported as an 
AE/SAE.  However, when a subject dies from PD with no other immediate causes, 
“disease progression” should be reported as an SAE and captured on designated eCRF.  These events are clini cally anticipated events in the target treatment population, and will 
be periodically reviewed by the Daiichi Sankyo safety teams to ensure prompt identification of any clinically concerning safety issues.

Proprietary and Confidential 
Page 76 The following types of events should be reported by the Investigator in electronic data 
capture ( EDC ) within 24 hours of becoming aware : 
• SAEs (see Section  9.4.2 for definition) 
• All potential ILD cas es should be reported within 24 hours; including both 
serious and non- serious potential ILD cases (potential ILD is defined by the 
Event Adjudication Site Manual List of PTs). 
• Hepatic events (both serious and non-serious) which meet  the potential Hy’s 
Law criteria defined as an elevated ( ALT or AST ) ≥3 × ULN and an  elevated  
total bilir ubin (TBL) >2 × ULN  that may occur either at different time  points 
or simultaneously during the study.  A targeted questionnaire is built as an 
eCRF to collect relevant additional information for these potential cases. 
• Overdose, defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of 
a product that is considered both excessive and medically important.  An “excessive and medically important” overdose includes any overdose in which 
either a serious adverse event, a non-serious adverse event, or no adverse event occurs and is considered by the Investigator as clinically relevant, i.e. poses an 
actual or potential risk to the subject.  
− Overdose is always serious.  By definition an overdose is medically 
important, which mee ts the seriousness criterion of important medical event. 
An overdose can occur with or without an AE. AEs can either be serious or 
non-serious. Details of the overdose including DS8201a dosage, cl inical 
course, associated AEs, and outcome must be captured in the Narrative form of the CRF within E DC. 
All events (serious and non-serious) must be reported with Investigator’s assessment of 
the event’s seriousness, severity, and causality to the study drug.  A detailed narrative 
summarizing the course of the event, including its evaluation, treatment, and outcome should be provided.  Specific or estimated dates of event onset, treatment, and resolution 
should be included when available.  Medical history, concomitant medications, and 
laboratory data that are relevant to the event should also be summarized in the narrative.  For fatal events, the narrative should state whether an autopsy was or will be performed, 
and include the results if available.  Source documents (including medical reports) will be 
retained at the study site and should not be submitted to the Sponsor for SAE reporting purposes. 
Urgent safety queries must be followed up and addressed promptly.  F/U  information and 
response to non-urgent safety queries should be combined for reporting to provide the 
most complete data possible within each F/U.  
In the event that eCRF is unavailable, report SAEs by faxing the paper Serious Adverse Event Report ( SAVER ) Form to CRO using the provided fax tra nsmittal form and the 
appropriate fax number provided for your country.  Once eC RF becomes available, please 
enter SAEs reported on the SAVER Form into e CRF as soon as possible.  Please refer to 
eCRF Completion Guide for additional instructions.   
See Sect ion 15.12.4 for contact information for SAE reporting.  Please call the local SAE 
Hotline (see Study Manual) or your study monitor for any questions on SAE reporting.

Page 77 9.6. Notifying Regulatory Authorities, Investigators, and 
Institutional Review Board /Ethics Committee  
Daiichi Sankyo and/or CRO will inform Investigators, IRBs/ECs, and regulatory 
authorities of any Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) occurring 
in other study sites or other  studies of the investigational drug , as appropriate per local 
reporting requirements.  Daiichi Sankyo and/or CRO  will comply with any additional 
local safety reporting requirements.  
In the US, upon receipt of the Sponsor’s notification of SUSARs that occurred with the 
study drug, unless delegated to the Sponsor, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to inform the IRB per Sponsor’s instruction. 
In the European Economic Area states, it is the Sponsor’s responsibility to report SUSARs 
to all ECs.  
9.7. Exposure In Utero During Clinical Studies  
Daiichi Sankyo must be notified of any subject who becomes pregnant while receiving or within  7 months of discontinuing the study drug .  
Although pregnancy is not technically an adverse event, all pregnancies must be followed to conclusion to determine their outcome.  This information is important for both drug safety and public health concerns.  It is the responsibility of the Investigator, or designee, 
to report any pregnancy in a female subject using the Exposure In Utero (EIU) Reporting 
form.  Please contact your study monitor to receive the EIU Reporting Form upon learning of a pregnancy.  The Investigator should make every effort to follow the subject  until 
completion of the pregnancy and complete the EIU Reporting Form with complete pregnancy outcome information, including normal delivery and induced abortion.  The adverse pregnancy outcome, either serious or non-serious, should be reported in 
accordance with study procedures.   If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for 
immediate classification as a SAE (ie , post-partum complications, spontaneous or induced 
abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly, including that in an aborted fetus), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs outlined in 
Section 9.5.

throughout their study participation.  
All clinical  laboratory values must be appraised by the investigator as to clinical 
significance and used to take appropriate clinical management measures.  All abnormal clinical  laboratory values considered clinically significant by the investigator should be 
recorded on the AE page of the eCRF.  If the abnormal laboratory value constitutes an 
SAE, it will be reported in the eCRF  and other relev ant procedures must be followed (see 
Section  9.5).  Abnormal laboratory values (NCI-CTCAE grade 3 or 4) occurring during 
the clinical study will be followed until repeat test results return to normal (or baseline), 
stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant.  
9.9. Vital Signs

11.1. General Statistical Considerations  
The primary analysis will be performed after all subjects have either discon tinued the 
study or at least completed tumor assessment at 18 weeks  (ie, at least 3 post- treatment  
tumor assessments)  in Cohort A.  A data cut -off date for database lock will be identified 
for the primary analysis.   After the primary analysis, the data will be followed until 
completion. 
Summary statistics will be presented by cohort.  Continuous variables will be summarized 
by the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values  (as well as geometric means and geometric coefficient of variation for 
Cmax and AUC PK parameters), unless otherwise specified.  Categorical variables will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages, unless otherwise specified. 
Assessmen t of change from baseline to post- treatment or t he ratio of post- treatment to 
baseline will include only those subjects with both baseline and post- treatment 
measurements.  The last non -missing value of a variable taken before the first dose of the 
study drug  will be used as the baseline value, unless otherwise specified.   In general, 
missing or dropout data will not be imputed for the purpose of data analysis, unless 
otherwise specified.  
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the f ull analysis s et (FAS).  Safety analyses will be 
performed using the Safe ty Analysis Set.   Analysis of PK parameters will be based on the 
PK Analysis Set.  All other exploratory analyses will be performed based on the FAS and the availability of assessment s.

Duration of response is defined as the time from the date of the first documentation of an 
objective response (CR or PR) to the date of the first documentation of PD .  Duration of 
response will be measured for responding subjects (CR or PR) only.  Detailed censoring 
rules for duration of response will be specified in the statistical analysis plan  (SAP). 
PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose to the earlier of the dates of the 
first objective documentation of radiographic PD via independent radiologic facility 
review or death due to any cause.  Detailed censoring rules for PFS will be specified in the SAP.  
OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose  to the date of death from  any cause.  If 
the death of a subject  is not reported before the data cut -off for OS analysis, OS will be 
censored at the last contact date at which a subject was  known to be alive. 
DoR, PFS, and OS will be summarized using Kaplan- Meier method with median event 
time and 2 -sided 95% CI for the median using Brookmeyer and Crowley  method by 
cohort. 
DCR  will be analyzed in the same manner as ORR analysis.   ORR assessed by the 
investigator will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary endpoint.  Any additional  
analys is plans will be specified  in the SAP.

Safety analysis will be performed using the Safety Analysis Set .  Safety analyses in 
general will be descriptive and will be presented in tabular format with the  appropriate 
summary statistics.  
11.4.3.1. Adverse Event Analyses  
A TEAE is defined as an AE that emerges during the treatment period (from date of first 
dose until the F/U visit after the last dose of the study drug ), having been absent at pre-
treatment; or reemerges during treatment, having been present at baseline but stopped 
prior to treatment; or worsens in severity after starting treatment related  to the pre-
treatm ent state, when the AE is continuous.  TEAEs will be coded using MedDRA and 
assigned grades based on version 5.0 of the NCI- CTCAE.  The number and percentage of 
subjects reporting TEAEs will be tabulated by system organ class (SOC ), preferred term 
(PT), relationship to the study treatment, and the worst CTCAE grade.  Similarly, the 
number and percentage of subjects reporting treatment- emergent SAEs will be tabulated  
by cohort, as well as TEAEs leading to discontinuation of the study treatments.  
A by -subje ct AE (including treatment- emergent) data listing including but not limited to 
the verbatim terms, SOC, PT, CTCAE grade, and relationship to study treatment will be provided.  Deaths, other SAEs, and other significant AEs, including those leading to

baseline by scheduled time of evaluation, including the EOT visit and the maximum and 
minimum post- treatment values.  All vital sign data will also be listed.  
11.4.3.4. Electrocardi ogram Analyses 
Descriptive statistics will be provided by cohort for ECG parameters  and changes from 
baseline by scheduled time of evaluation, including the maximum post- treatment value s 
and the values at the EOT Visit.  In addition, the number and percentage of subjects with ECG interval values meeting the criteria  (eg, QTc ≤450 ms, >450 to ≤480 ms, >480 ms to 
≤500 ms, and >500 ms)  will be tabulated by cohort.  The QT intervals will be corrected 
for heart rate by Frideri cia’s formula (QTcF = QT/[RR]
1/3).  ECG data will also be listed.

No formal interim analys es are planned.   
11.6. Sample Size Determination  
A total of 90 (Cohort A: 50, Cohort B: 20, and Cohort C: 20) will be enrolled.  
Cohort A 
The sample size of 48 subjects provides a 90% probability of achieving a lower limit of 
95% CI for the ORR that exceeds 15% (threshold) under the expected ORR of 35%, and enables a statistical comparison with  a historical control on PFS (eg, provides a power of 
about 80% to detect the difference in PFS under the assumption that median PFS will be prolonged from 2 months to 3 months compared to historical PFS  in patients treated with 
regorafenib
21 or TAS -10222).  Considering drop out, 50 subjects will be enrolled. 
Cohorts B and C 
With this s ample size, t he probability that more than 4 responders out of 20 subjects 
(ORR  >20%) are observed will be less than 5% under the threshold ORR  of 10%,  but 
more than 75% under the expected ORR  of 30% .

The investigator/investigational site will permit study related monitoring, audits, IRB/EC 
review and regulatory inspections by providing direct access to source data/documents.  
Direct access includes permission to examine, analyze, verify, and reproduce any records 
and reports t hat are important to the evaluation of a clinical study.  
12.1. Monitoring and Inspections  
The Sponsor, CRO  monitor, and regulatory authority inspectors are responsible for 
contacting and visiting the Investigator for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, upon request, inspecting the various records of the study ( eg, CRFs, source data, and other 
pertinent documents). 
 The verification  of adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency of 
the data; and adherence to ICH  Good Clinical Pract ice (GCP ) and local regulations on the 
conduct of clinical research will be accomplished through a combination of onsite visits 
by the monitor and review of study data remotely.  The frequency of the monitoring visit 
will vary based on the activity at each  study site.  The monitor is responsible for 
inspecting the CRFs and ensuring completeness of the study essential documents.  The 
monitor should have access to subject medical records and other study- related records 
needed to verify the entries on the CRFs.  Detailed information is provided in the 
monitoring plan. 
The monitor will communicate deviations from the protocol, SOPs, GCP and applicable 
regulations to the Investigator and will ensure that appropriate action (s) designed to prevent recurrence of th e detected deviations is taken and documented. 
The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are addressed to the satisfaction of the sponsor and documented. 
In accordance with ICH GCP and the Sponsor’s audit plans, this study site may be 
selected for audit by representatives from the Sponsor.  Audit of study site facilities ( eg, 
pharmacy, drug storage areas, laboratories) and review of study related records wi ll occur 
in order to evaluate the study conduct and compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements.   The Investigator should respond to audit findings.  In 
the event that a regulatory authority informs the Investigator that it intends to conduct an 
inspection, the Sponsor shall be notified immediately.

inspected or reviewed the data on the eCRF, the data queries, and the site notifications, 
and agrees with the content.  The information should be entered into the eCRF within 5 
days of the visit and should be completed, reviewed, and signed off by the investigator within 2 weeks of the last subject visit.  Query resolution should be completed within 48 
hours. 
12.3. Data Man agement  
Each subject will be identified in the database by a unique subject identifier as defined by 
the sponsor. 
To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and study sites, a Clinical Data 
Management review will be performed on subject dat a according to specifications given to 
Sponsor or Designee.   Data will be vetted both electronically and manually for CRFs and 
the data will be electronically vetted by programmed data rules within the application.  Queries generated by rules and raised by  reviewers will be generated within the EDC 
application.  During this review, subject data will be checked for consistency, 
completeness  and any apparent discrepancies.  
Data received from external sources such as central labs will be reconciled to the clinical database.  
Serious Adverse Events in the clinical database will be reconciled with the safety database.  
All Adverse Events will be coded using MedDRA.  
12.4. Study Documentation and Storage  
The Investigator will maintain a Signature List of appropriately qualified persons to whom he/she has delegated study duties.  All persons authorized to make entries and/or 
corrections on CRFs will be included on the Signature List. 
Investigators will maintain a confidential screening log of all potential study candidates  
that includes limited information of the subjects, date and outcome of screening process.

Regulations (CFR) Title 21, parts 11, 50, 54, 56, and 312 as appropriate and/or; 
• Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare Ordinance No. 28 of 27 March, 1997 and/or; 
• Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the 
Member States relating to the implementation of good clinical practice in the 
conduct of clinical trials on medicinal product for human use; 
• Other applicable local regulatio ns. 
15.2. Subject Confidentiality  
The Investigators and the Sponsor will preserve the confidentiality of all subjects taking 
part in the study, in accordance with GCP and local regulations. 
For EU study sites, the Sponsor will observe the rules laid down in the European Data 
Protection Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the 
processing of personal data and the free movement of such data.   
The Investigator must ensure that the subject’s anonymity is maintained.  On the CRFs or 
other documents submitted to the Sponsor or the CRO, subjects should be identified by a 
unique subject identifier as designated by the Sponsor.  Documents that are not for submission to the Sponsor or the CRO ( eg, signed ICF) should be kept in strict confidence 
by the Investigator. 
In compliance with ICH GCP Guidelines, it is required that the Investigator and institution 
permit authorized representatives of the company, of the regulatory agency(s), and the 
IRB/EC direct access to review the subject’s original medical records for verification of 
study-related procedures and data.  The Investigator is obligated to inform the subject that his/her study- related records will be reviewed by the above named representatives without 
violating the confidentiality of the s ubject. 
15.3. Informed Consent  
Before a subject’s participation in the study, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to obtain freely given consent, in writing, from the subject after adequate explanation of the aims, 
methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study and before any protocol-
specific procedures or any study drugs are administered.  Subjects should be given the opportunity to ask questions and receive satisfactory answers to their inquiries, and should 
have adequate time to decide whether or not to participate in the study.  The written ICF 
should be prepared in the local language(s) of the potential subject population. 
Protocol DS8201-A-J203 
Version 5.0, 03 Jul 2020 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 
Page 94 In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the Investigator should comply with the 
applicable regulatory requ irements, and should adhere to GCP and to the ethical principles 
that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  The consent form and any revision(s) 
should be approved by the EC or IRB prior to being provided to potential subjects. 
The subject’s w ritten informed consent should be documented in the subject’s medical 
records.  The ICF should be signed and personally dated by the subject and by the person 
who conducted the informed consent discussion (not necessarily the Investigator).  The 
original s igned ICF should be retained in accordance with institutional policy, and a copy 
of the signed consent form should be provided to the subject.  The date and time (if 
applicable) that informed consent was given should be recorded on the CRF. 
Suggested model text for the ICF for the study and any applicable subparts (genomic, PK, 
etc.) are provided in the Sponsor’s ICF template for the Investigator to prepare the documents to be used at his or her study site.  Updates to applicable forms will be 
communicated via letter from the Sponsor. 
For study sites in the US, an additional consent is required for the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  Also, a separate special consent will be 
required for Pharmacogenomic testing for this protocol. 
15.4. Informed Consent for Pharmacogenomic Analysis  
Before obtaining samples for pharmacogenomic analysis, the investigator is responsible 
for obtaining freely given consent, in writing, from the subject, after giving an explanation 
of the pharmacogenomic analysis in intelligible terms.  Before obtaining the informed 
consent, the investigator should provide the subjects with adequate time to have the opportunity to inquire about the details of the study, and should answer all questions properly.  This analysis is an optional analysis for whom agreed to join clinical study, and 
another written informed consent document is prepared, separately from informed consent 
for clinical study.  
15.5. Regulatory Compliance  
The study protocol, subject information and consent form, the Investigator Brochure, any 
subject written instructions to be given to the subject, available safety information, subject 
recruitment procedures (eg , advertisements), information about payments and 
compensation available to the subjects, and documentation evidencing the Investigator’s 
qualifications should be submitted to the EC or IRB for ethical review and approval 
according to local regulations, prior to the study start.  The written approval should identify all documents reviewed by name and version. 
Changes in the conduct of the study or planned analysis will be documented in a protocol 
amendment and/or the SAP. 
The Investigator and/or Sponsor must submit and, where necessary, obtain approval from 
the EC or IRB for all subsequent protocol amendments and changes to the ICF.  The 
Investigator should notify the EC or IRB of deviations from the protocol or SAEs occurring at the study site and other AE reports received from the Sponsor/CRO, in 
accordance with local procedures.  
Protocol DS8201-A-J203 
Version 5.0, 03 Jul 2020 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 
Page 95 As required by local reg ulations, the Sponsor’s local Regulatory Affairs group or 
representative to whom this responsibility has been delegated will ensure all legal aspects 
are covered, and approval from the appropriate regulatory bodies obtained, prior to study initiation , and that implementation of changes to the initial protocol and other relevant 
study documents happen only after approval by the relevant regulatory bodies.  
In the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed ( eg, clinical hold) by an applicable 
Regulatory Authority(ies) in any area of the world, or if the Investigator is aware of any 
new information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the 
investigational drug, the Sponsor should be informed immediately.   
In addition, the Inves tigator will inform the Sponsor immediately of any urgent safety 
measures taken by the Investigator to protect the study subjects against any immediate 
hazard, and of any suspected/actual serious GCP non- compliance that the Investigator 
becomes aware of.  
15.6. Protocol Deviations 
The Investigator should conduct the study in compliance with the protocol agreed to by 
Sponsor and, if required, by the regulatory authority(ies), and which was given 
approval/favorable opinion by the IRBs/ECs. 
A deviation to any protocol procedure or waiver to any stated criteria will not be allowed 
in this study except where necessary to eliminate immediate hazard(s) to the subject.  
Sponsor must be notified of all intended or unintended deviations to the protocol ( eg, 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, dosing, missed study visits) on an expedited basis. 
The Investigator, or person designated by the Investigator, should document and explain 
any deviation from the approved protocol. 
If a subject was ineligible or received the incorrect dose or  study treatment, and had at 
least 1 administration of study drug, data should be collected for safety purposes. If applicable, t he Investigator should notify the IRB /EC of deviations from the protocol in 
accordance with local procedures.  
15.7. Supply of New Inf ormation Affecting the Conduct of the Study 
When new information becomes available that may adversely affect the safety of subjects 
or the conduct of the study, the Sponsor will inform all Investigators involved in the clinical study, IRBs /ECs , and regulatory authorities of such information, and when needed, 
will amend the protocol and/or subject information. 
The Investigator should immediately inform the subject whenever new information 
becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s consent or may  influence the 
subject’s willingness to continue participation in the study.  The communication should be documented on medical records, for example, and it should be confirmed whether the subject is willing to remain in the study.  
If the subject information is revised, it must be re-approved by the IRB /EC.  The 
Investigator should obtain written informed consent to continue participation with the revised written information even if subjects were already informed of the relevant 
Protocol DS8201-A-J203 
Version 5.0, 03 Jul 2020 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 
Page 96 information.  The Investigator or other responsible personnel who provided explanations 
and the subject should sign and date the revised ICF. 
15.8. Protocol Amendments 
Any amendments to the study protocol that seem to be appropriate as the study progresses 
will be communicated to the Inve stigator by Daiichi Sankyo or the CRO.  Also, the 
Sponsor will ensure the timely submission of amendments to regulatory authorities. 
A global protocol amendment will affect study conduct at all study site s in all regions of 
the world.  Such amendments will be incorporated into a revised protocol document.  Changes made by such amendments will be documented in a Summary of Changes 
document.  These protocol amendments will undergo the same review and approval 
process as the original protocol.   
A local protocol amendment will affect study conduct at a particular study site(s) and/or in 
a particular region/country.  Sponsor approval of local amendments will be clearly 
documented. 
A protocol amendment may be implemented after it has been approved by the IRB/EC and 
by regulatory authorities where appropriate, unless immediate implementation of the 
change is necessary for subject safety.  
15.9. Study Termination  
The Sponsor has the right to terminate the study at any time and study termination may 
also be requested by (a ) competent authority (ies).  
15.10.  Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
Not applicable. 
15.11.  Steering Committee  
A steering committee will be established for this study.  Details on the membership , 
responsibilities, and working procedures of the committee will be described in its own charter.  
15.12.  Address List  
A list of key study personnel (including personnel at the sponsor, CRO, laboratories, and 
other vendors) and their contact information (address, telephone, fax, email) will be kept on file and regularly updated as necessary.

17.3. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1  
17.3.1. Measurability of Tumor at Baseline 
17.3.1.1. Definitions  
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized measurable or non- measurable 
as follows: 
17.3.1.1.1. Measurable  
• Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest 
diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size 
of:  
− 10 mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5  mm)  
− 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions which cannot be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable)  
− 20 mm by chest X -ray  
• Measurable malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5  mm).  
At baseline (ie, screening for this study) and in F/U  (ie, all measurements past 
screening for this study), only the short axis will be mea sured and followed.  
See also notes below on “Baseline documentation of target and non- target 
lesions” for information on lymph node measurement.

Version 5.0, 03 Jul 2020 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 
Page 104 17.3.1.1.2. Non-Measurable  
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10  mm or pathological lymph 
node s with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), as well as truly non -measurable lesions.  Lesions 
considered truly non- measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or 
pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or 
lung, and abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is 
not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques. 
17.3.1.1.3. Special Considerations Regarding Lesion Measurability  
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require 
particular comment.  
17.3.1.1.3.1. Bone Lesions  
• Bone scan, positron emission tomography scan or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions.  However, 
these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions. 
• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic- blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by cross-sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above. 
• Blastic bone lesions are non- measurable.  
17.3.1.1.3.2. Cystic Lesions  
• Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should 
not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts.  
• “Cystic lesions” thought to represent cystic metast ases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described 
above.  However, if noncystic lesions are present in the same subject, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
17.3.1.1.3.3. Lesions with Prior Local Treat ment  
• Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to 
other loco-regional therapy, are not considered measurable unless there has been 
demonstrated progression in the lesion. 
17.3.1.2. Specifications by Methods of Measurements  
17.3.1.2.1. Measurement of Lesions  
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically 
assessed.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and NEVER more than 28 days before enrollment(study treatment) .

Version 5.0, 03 Jul 2020 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 
Page 105 17.3.1.2.2. Method of Assessment  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during F/U.  Imaging based evaluation 
should always be performed rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for response assessment.  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  When CT scans 
have slice thickness greater than 5  mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should 
be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (eg, for body 
scans).  
17.3.2. Tumor Response Evaluation 
17.3.2.1. Assessment of Overall Tumor Burden and Measurable Disease 
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. 
In this study, only subjects with measurable disease at baseline should be included. 
17.3.2.2. Baseline Documentation of “Target” and “Non-target” Lesions 
When more than 1 measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesion s up to a maximum of 
5 lesions total (representative of all involved organs) should be identified as target lesions 
and will be recorded and measured at baseline (this means in instances where subjects 
have only 1 or 2 organ sites involved a maximum of 2 and 4 lesions respectively will be 
recorded).  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that 
lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which 
circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be 
selected.  
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which 
may be visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor.  As noted above, pathological 
nodes which are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥15 mm by CT scan.  Only the short axis of these nodes will 
contribute to the baseline sum.  The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used 
by radiologists to judge if a node is involved by solid tumor.  Nodal size is normally reported a s 2 dimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is 
almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal, or coronal).  The smaller of these measures is the short axis.  For example, an abdomina l 
node which is reported as being 20 mm × 30  mm has a short axis of 20 mm and qualifies 
as a malignant, measurable node.  In this example, 20  mm should be recorded as the node 
measurement.  All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥10 mm but <15 mm) should be considered non- target lesions.  Nodes that have a short axis <10  mm are 
considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.

Version 5.0, 03 Jul 2020 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 
Page 106 A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph 
nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any 
objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be 
identified as non- target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are 
not required and these lesions should be followed as “present,” “absent,” or in rare cases “unequivocal progression.”  In addition, it is possible to record multiple non -target lesions 
involving the same organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, “multiple enlarged 
pelvic lymph nodes” or “multiple liver metastases”).  
17.3.2.3. Response Criteria  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to dete rmine objective tumor 
response for target lesions.  
17.3.2.3.1. Evaluation of Target Lesions 
CR: Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or 
non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference 
the baseline sum diameters.  
PD: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference 
the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  
In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5  mm.  (Note: the appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also 
considered progression.)  
SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, 
taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
17.3.2.3.2. Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions  
Lymph nodes:  Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual 
short axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study.  This means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the “sum” of lesions may not be zero even i f 
CR criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of <10 mm.  For PR, SD, and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be 
included in the sum of target lesions. 
Target lesions that become “too small to measu re”: While on study, all lesions (nodal 
and non- nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at 
each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2  mm).  However, sometimes 
lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on 
CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being “too small to measure.”  When this occurs, it is important that a value 
be recorded on the eCRF.  If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely 
disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm.  If the lesion is believed to be

Version 5.0, 03 Jul 2020 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 
Page 107 present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be 
assigned.  (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they 
usually have a definable size when normal and are frequently surrounded by fat such as in 
the retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen 
but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance 
as well .)  This default value is derived from the 5 mm CT slice thickness (but should not 
be changed with varying CT slice thickness).  The measurement of these lesio ns is 
potentially non-reproducible, therefore providing this default value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon measurement error.  To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure, that should be recorded, even if it is below 
5 mm.  
Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment:  When non-nodal lesions “fragment,” the 
longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the target lesion sum.  Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained 
that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion.  If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the 
longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the 
“coalesced lesion.”  
17.3.2.3.3. Evaluation of Non- target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response 
for the group of non-target lesions.  While some non- target lesions may act ually be 
measurable, they need not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitatively 
at the time points specified in the protocol.  
CR: Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.  All 
lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of 1 or more non- target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
PD: Unequivocal progression (see comments below) of existing non- target lesions (Note: 
the appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also considered progression). 
17.3.2.3.4. Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non -target Disease 
The concept of progression of non- target disease requires additional explanation as 
follows: 
When the subject also ha s measurable disease: In this setting, to achieve “unequivocal 
progression” on the basis of the non- target disease, there must be an overall level of 
substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in 
target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation 
of therapy.  A modest “increase” in the size of 1 or more non-target lesions is usually not 
sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non- target disease in the face of SD or PR of 
target disease will therefore be extremely rare.  
When the subject has only non- measurable disease: The same general concepts apply here 
as noted above, however, in this instance there is no measurable disease assessment to 
Protocol DS8201-A-J203 
Version 5.0, 03 Jul 2020 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 
Page 108 factor into the interpretation of an increase in non- measurable disease burden.  Because 
worsening in non- target disease cannot be easily quantified (by definition: if all lesions are 
truly non- measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing subjects for 
unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on 
the change in non- measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that 
would be requir ed to declare PD for measurable disease (ie, an increase in tumor burden 
representing an additional 73% increase in “volume“ [which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable lesion]).  If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the 
subject should be considered to have had overall PD at that point.  While it would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply to non- measurable disease, the very nature of that 
disease makes it impossible to do so, therefore the increase must be substantial. 
17.3.2.3.5. New Lesio ns 
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some 
comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for the 
identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be 
unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some 
“new” bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of preexist ing lesions).  This is 
particularly important when the subject’s baseline lesions show PR or CR.  For example, 
necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a “new” cystic lesion, 
which it is not.  
A lesion identified on a F/U  study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.  An example of this is the subject who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI 
brain ordered which reveals metastases.  The subject’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline. 
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
F/U evaluation will clarify if  it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm there 
is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial 
scan.  
17.3.2.4. Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the study 
treatment until the EOT.  Confirmatory measurement for CR, PR, or SD is required in the 
study.  
The subject’s best overall response assignment will depend on the findings of both target 
and non- target disease and will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions. 
17.3.2.4.1. Time Point Response  
It is assumed that at each protocol -specified time point, a response assessment occurs.  
Table 17.2 provides a summary of the overall response status calculation at each time point for subjects who have measurable disease at baseline. 
When subjects have non- measurable (therefore non -target) disease only, see Table 17.2.

PD Any Yes or No  PD 
Any PD Yes or No  PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
CR = complete response, PR = partial response, SD = stable disease, PD = progressive disease, NE  = not 
evaluable.  
17.3.2.4.2. Missing Assessments and Inevaluable Designation  
When no imaging/measurement is performed at all at a particular time  point, the subject is 
not evaluable (NE) at that time  point.  If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at 
an assessment, usually the case is also considered NE at that time point, unless a 
convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) 
would not change the assigned time point response.  This would be most likely to happen in the case of PD.  For example, if a subject had a baseline sum of 50  mm with 3  measured 
lesions and at F/U  only 2 lesions were ass essed, but those gave a sum of 80 mm, the 
subject will have achieved PD status, regardless of the contribution of the missing lesion. 
17.3.2.4.3. Best Overall Response: All Time Points  
The best overall response is determined once all the data for the subject is known. 
Best response determination in this study requires confirmation of CR or PR:  Best 
response is defined as the lesser of the two best responses across 2 consecutive scans (eg, a subject who has PR at first assessment, SD at second assessment, and PD on las t 
assessment; this would report as a best overall response of SD).  When SD is believed to be best response, it must also meet the protocol specified minimum time from baseline, 6 weeks (± 7 days).  If the minimum time is not met when SD is otherwise the best time 
point response, the subject’s best response depends on the subsequent assessments.  For 
example, a subject who has SD at first assessment, PD at second and does not meet minimum duration for SD, will have a best response of PD.  The same subject lost to F/U  
after the first SD assessment would be considered inevaluable.  
17.3.2.4.4. Special Notes on Response Assessment  
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to “normal” size (<10  mm), they may still have a measurement r eported on scans.  This 
measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted earlier, this means that subjects with CR may not have a total sum of “zero” on the eCRF.

Proprietary and Confidential 
Page 110 Subjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a 
descriptor of an objective response: it is a reason for stopping study therapy.  The 
objective response status of such subjects is to be determined by evaluation of target and non-target disease.  
For equivocal findings of progression (eg, very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic changes or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled assessment.  If at the n ext scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of 
progression should be the earlier date when progression was suspected. 
17.3.2.5.  Frequency of Tumor Re-evaluation 
In this study, tumor measurement will be conducted every 6 weeks (± 7 days) while the 
subject remains on study until progression of disease, withdrawal of consent, death, or loss 
to F/U .  Scan dates should not be adjusted or rescheduled due to dose interruption of any 
type.  
Baseline tumor assessments must be performed within 28 days of enrol lment ( study 
treatment ). 
All efforts should be made to ensure consistency between the baseline measurements and 
all subsequent measurements in reference to utilization of scanning method, equipment, 
technique (including slice thickness and field of view), and radiographic interpreter.  
The radiographic evaluation must include CT or MRI scanning of chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis at screening period.  A CT or MRI of the brain is mandatory for all subjects 
included with baseline stable brain metastases.  Any additional suspected sites of disease 
should also be imaged.  Every effort should be made to use the same assessment modality for all assessments for each subject.  F/U  evaluations should include all sites of disease 
identified at screening and any other locatio ns if progressive disease is suspected (eg, CT 
or MRI of the brain if brain metastases are suspected) should also be imaged.  All evaluations should meet the standard of care for imaging of lesions in the respective 
organ(s) and should conform to the image acquisition guidelines according to institutional 
standards. 
All target and non- target sites are evaluated at each time point of tumor assessment.

Page 112 17.5. Instructions Related to SARS -CoV-2 
Due to the potential impact of SARS -CoV-2, ie COVID-19, on subject safety, the Sponsor 
recommends the following dose modification and management plan for subjects with 
confirmed or suspected SARS -CoV- 2 while being treated with DS -8201a.  Dose 
modifications will be based on the worst CTCAE grade.  Use CTCAE version 5.0 general 
grading criteria to evaluate SARS -CoV-2.  All dose modifications (discontinuation, 
interruptions or reductions) must be recorded on the AE and drug administration eCRFs. 
 
17.5.1. Dose Modification Criteria for Suspected or Confirmed SARS -CoV-2  
If SARS -CoV-2 infection is suspected, interrupt DS-8201a and rule out SARS-CoV-2 per 
local guidance.  
− If SARS -CoV-2 is ruled out, follow study protocol. 
− If SARS -CoV-2 is confirmed or is still suspected after evaluation follow dose 
modification as outlined in Table 17.4 below and manage SARS -CoV-2 per local 
guidance until recovery of SARS -CoV-2.  SARS-CoV-2 recovery is defined as no 
signs/symptoms of SARS -CoV- 2, at least 1 negative real -time reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) test result, and nearly or complet ely resolved 
chest CT findings.

17.5.2. Prior and Concomitant Medications - Prohibite d Therapies/Products  
• Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine; 
− Concomitant treatment is not allowed during the study treatment (Section  5.6).  
− If treatment is absolutely required for SARS -CoV- 2, DS -8201a must be interrupted.  
− If administered, then a washout period of no less than 14 days is required before 
resumption of DS-8201a. 
 
17.5.3. PK Assessment(s) if Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine is Administered  
Additional PK serum samples should be collected, if chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine 
is administered for SARS -CoV-2 infection, at the time points specified in the Schedule of 
Events ( Table 8.3).  
The chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine administration time and the exact time of blood sample collection for PK analysis must be recorded on the eCRF.  
 
17.5.4. SARS -CoV- 2 Assessment(s)  
All confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection events must be recorded in the eCRF.  
If a subject presents to the clinic with symptoms suggestive of SARS -CoV-2, but the RT-
PCR test is not available at the site, a sample kit will be provided for sample collection to 
be tested at a central laboratory.  The results will be provided to the site from the central 
laboratory. 
Serum samples will be used for SARS-CoV-2 testing from each subject who provides 
consent.  Samples will be collected prior to the study drug infusion, shipped to a central 
laboratory, and stored there until the tests become available. 
If subjects consent, the remaining serum samples will also be stored for future analysis. 
 
17.5.5. Statistical Analysis - Assessment of the Impact of SARS- CoV-2 
If deemed appropriate, analyses will be performed to explore the impact of SARS-CoV-2 
on the safety, efficacy, and any other endpoints, as appropriate, reported for the study. 
As a result of the impact of SARS -CoV-2 on study conduc t, adjustments to the statistical 
analysis and interpretation will be made, if required. These will be described in the 
statistical analysis plan .

Background , Rationale  and Context  
The number of older adults is projected to increase dramatically by 2050 .  Aging-related diseases and 
conditions still seriously compromise the quality of life among mos t older adults.  Several pharmaceutical 
agents  (1-4), such as metformin, have been tested to extend lifespan and delay aging -related diseases and 
dysfunctions in mice.  Metformin , a biguanide antidiabetic drug , reduces the risk for developing type -2 
diabetes  in persons at risk by over one -third  with few adverse effects  (e.g., gastrointestinal irritation ) (5).  
Metformin prevents type -2 diabetes primari ly through decreas ing hepatic glucose synthesis  (6), as well as 
enhancing insulin sensitivity and increasing  peripheral glucose uptake  (7-9).  The molecular mechanisms 
remain unclear, although a number of potentia l mechanism such as activation of AMP -activated protein 
kinase (AMPK) and inhibition of mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase  have been proposed , 
see figure 1  (10;11) .  The fact that metformin treatment in persons with type -2 diabetes has been 
associated with reduced risk of other aging -related diseases and conditions, including cardiovascular 
disease  (12), cancer (13) and 
cognitive decline (14) supports 
the possibility  of the  beneficial 
effects of metformin on healthy 
aging.  It is imperative to 
capitalize on these leads to extend 
health span  among older adults.    
 
 
To tra nslate animal findings to 
human intervention trials, 
appropria te aging biomarkers are 
needed. Methylomic and 
transcriptomic profiles in relevant 
cells may reflect molecular 
features that mediate effects of 
both genetic and environmental 
factors on aging -related 
functional decline and disease. 
The roles of monocytes  have 
been implicated in development 
of many aging -related diseases 
such as cardiovascular disease, 
cancer and neurodegenerative 
disease  (15).  In a cross -sectional 
association study of 1,200 monocyte samples, we identified 1,794 age -associated methylation sites  (16) 
and 2,704 age -associated transcripts  (17), which were over -represented in two networks  (autophagy and 
oxidative phosph orylation ) and suggestive of declin e in those f unctions  with age . Both autophagy  (18) 
and oxidative phosphorylation  (19) are considered as key con tributors to the aging process, and their 
dysfunctions have been linked to aging -related diseases  (20;21) . Changes in these aging -related omic 
biomarkers may be early indicators of cellular damage or disruption that eventually leads to age-related 
dysfunctions.  Assessment of these aging biomark ers in response to therapeutic intervention may also

Protocol version: 9.4.18  2 provide molecular insight for personalizing treatment.   We propose  a pilot study  to examine changes in 
aging -related omic profiles after 3 months of metformin treatment in 3 5 monocyte samples from older 
adults  using a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled crossover study design . 
 
Objective s 
Our overarching goal of the pilot study i s to evaluate the utility of using the aging -related omic 
biomarkers as an indicator of pharmacologic responses in the anti-aging therapeutic intervention trials 
through the following specific aims .  Although this pilot study does not have sufficient power to 
definitively test all the aims, it will provide essential preliminary data for developing a full scale research 
program.  
• Aim 1 A: To test  the effects of the me tformin treatment on transcriptomic profiles and related  
functional  changes in human monocytes,  
• Aim 1B: To explore  the effects of the metformin treatm ent on methylomic  profiles in human 
monocytes,  
• Aim 2: To invest igate the long itudinal relatio nship between transcriptional and functional  
changes in human monocytes  during the metformin treatment and  
• Aim 3: To test the effects of the metformin trea tment on frailty and other aging -related physical 
and cognitive measur es and investigate the longitudinal relationship between these changes and 
transcriptional changes.  
 
Methods and Measures  
 
Design  
A randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled crossover  trial in 35 participants  using metformin and 
matching placebo  will be  used. In the absence of a treatment by sequence interaction effect, t his design 
can increase  study power for evaluating treatment effects by allowing each participant to be his/her own 
control. The period effect may be minimum because t he primary outcomes , methylation and 
transcriptional measures, are relative ly stable overtime.

Screening, consent and randomization. Individuals who pass the telephone screening will be scheduled 
for a visit to the Ge riatric Research Clinic (GRC) in the Sticht Center on Aging for a screening visit (SV). 
Before any data collection, all participants will provide written informed consent and complete a HIPAA 
authorization form in accordance with the Wake Forest School of Medicine Institutional Review Board 
policies. Individuals who meet all eligibility criteria and provide informed consent will be invited back for 
the first baseline visit  (BV). At the end of BV, participant s will be randomized to one of the two study 
intervention sequences  (metformin followed by placebo or placebo  followed by metformin ) using a web -
based randomization scheme (developed by Dr. Miller) . The randomization sequences will be unknown to 
the research staff. Intervention assignment will be generate d using a program that the study coordinator 
will access from his/her PC through the study website.   
 
Schedule and organization of assessment visits  
All assessments will be conducted during 4 visits (before and after each intervention)  according to the 
chart below. All examiners are trained in the standardized conduct of all assessments before data 
collection.  Participants will be instructed to wear appropriate and comfortable clothing, and standardized 
written instructions will be provided prior to each study visit.

The screening visit (SV)  will be conducted in the morning f ollowing an 8 -hour fast for measurement of 
lipids, blood count, Hba1c, Vitamin B12, and a metabolic panel for screening purposes. Vitals (blood 
pressure, pulse, heigh t, weight , and wa ist circumference ) are collected and the blood draw completed, 
participan ts will be given a snack and continue with the remainder of the visit. First, the  expanded  short 
physical performance battery ( eSPPB)  will be administered and scored and then undergo a cognitive 
scree n, assessed using the  Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoC A), and a medical history , review of 
medications and dietary supplements  We will also ask about the participants  demographics and  physical 
abilities using  the Pepper Assessment Tool for Disability (PAT -D), 
 
The first baseline visit  (BV), will be conducted in the morning following an 8 -hour fast for  blood 
collect ion for methylomic and transcriptomic  measures, bioenergetic capacity, CBC, as well as blood for 
storage. After these measures are complete, participants will be given a snack and will continue with the 
rest of the visit  consisting of l ower extremity muscle p ower (Nottingham Power Rig), grip strength, 6 
minute walk distance test (6MWD), and the Mobility Assessment Tool – short form (MAT -sf).  Cognitive 
function will be assessed using the Digit Symbol Test (DSST) . Once the visit is complete, the participant 
will be randomized and placed in one of the following groups discussed below. Participants will be 
provided with an information sheet that will provide additional details on how and when to take the 
medication, who to call if they have any problems, possible side effects, and what to do should they 
encounter any side effects.  
 
Interventions and Interactions  
Eligible participants will receive both interventions (3 -month metformin treatment and 3 -month  placebo) . 
Randomization will be used to determine the order in which the participants receive each intervention 
(i.e., 15 participants with metformin treatment followed by placebo, and 15 with placebo followed by 
metformin treatment). Neither the particip ants nor the investigators know the intervention order of a 
participant. Metformin reaches peak plasma concentration within one to eight hours, has an average 
elimination half -life of 6.2 hours in plasma, and is cleared but not metabolized from the body  by tubular 
secretion .  Treatment with metformin and placebo will be initiated at a dose of 425 mg taken orally once a 
day at night for 7 days. After the week, the participant will be called to assess tolerance and will be asked 
to increase dose to one pill a t night at a dose of 850  mg for one week. At the end of the second week, 
participants will be called again and if they tolerated the second dose, they will be asked to take two 
850mg pills, one in the morning and one at night, for a total dose of 1700  mg which is within the range of 
the usual effective dose of 1500 to 2000 mg/day  for the remainder of the 3 months .  This dosing regimen 
was created in order to avoid or reduce possible gastro intestinal side effects. This can be modified if the 
 
Protocol version: 9.4.18  5 participant is e xperiencing any side effects and will be handled on a case by case basis. Each study visit  
where stored blood is obtained  (BV, Mid, FV)  may be rescheduled if the subject has a fever, infection, or 
has taken antibiotics within 24hrs of this scheduled visit.  
 
All baseline assessments will be completed again at 12 weeks and again at 24 weeks  as listed in the 
assessment table .  
 
Outcome Measure(s)  
The primary outcome s will be the eigengene score s (and related individual transcriptional measures)  for 
the two  transcriptional  netw orks, the autophagy an d oxidative phosphorylation .  The eigengene score is 
defined as the first principal component of a transcriptional network. The secondary outcome s will 
include functional , methylation and other aging -related measures.   
 
Individual methylation sites and transcripts, especially the eigengenes of autophage, oxidative 
phosphorylation and protein synthesis networks  Methylomic and transcriptomic profiles in monocytes 
will be quantified using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip and the Illumina HumanHT -12 v4 
Expression BeadChips, respectively, at Dr. Liu’s laboratory  (22).  Blood will be collected in Vacutainer 
CPTTM cell separation tubes containing sodium citrate (Becton Dick inson, Rutherford, NJ) to separate 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  Then, monocytes will be isolated with the anti -CD14 coated 
magnetic beads using AutoMACs automated magnetic separation unit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch 
Gladbach, Germanry). DNA and RNA will be isolated simultaneously using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini 
Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Hilden, Germany) .  
 
Functional measures : An autophagic profile in monocytes including macroautophagy, microautophagy 
and chaperone -mediated autophagy will be measured using fluorescent repo rters at Dr. Ana Maria 
Cuervo ’s lab in Albert Einstein College of Medicine.  
 
Mitochondrial Function: Respirometric profiling will be used to assess bioenergetic capacity, 
respiratory control and electron transport chain function  at Dr. Molin a’s lab (23). This will be performed 
by examining the oxygen consumption profile of bloo d monocytes . Specific outcomes of mitochondria 
function include respiratory control ratio (RCR), state 3 (maximal oxygen  consumption rate), and state 4  
(oxygen consumption upon inhibition of ATP synthase ). 
 
Other Data  
 
Vital Signs  Prior to randomization data are collected  on sitting blood pressure, heart rate, and weight. 
Body height is measured once prior to  randomization. Th e blood pressure assessments will allow the 
determination of the incidence of  hypertension and serve as basis for a temporary exclusion. The other 
measures are  collected primarily for descriptive purposes.  
 
Demographics and co -morbidities: Medical informat ion regarding co -morbidi ties and medications will 
be ascertained at the screening visit.  Demographic data such as socio -economic status, education level, 
age, and race also will be recorded and used as covariates if necessary.  Information about preventati ve 
health screenings and other health maintenance information is asked at the follow up visit . 
 
Physical performance will be assessed using the expanded Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)  
(24). The expanded SPPB consists of 5 repeated chair stands, standing balance (semi - and full -tandem 
stands and a single leg stand for 30 seconds), a 4 -m walk to assess usual gait speed, and a narrow 4 -m 
walk test of balance (walking at usual pace within line s of tape spaced 20 cm apart).  Scores for the 
traditional 0-12 point SPPB can also be obtained from these tests. We will also assess physical 
 
Protocol version: 9.4.18  6 performance using  the six minute walk distance test (6MWD). The participant is asked to walk at a pace 
they can maintain for six minutes and the distance covered will be re corded.  
Lower extremity muscle power will be measured using the Nottingham Power Rig, a safe, convenient 
method for assessing power output from the lower limb which has been used reliably in older adults. (25) 
Participants will sit in a chair and unilater ally depress a foot lever attached to a flywheel as hard and as 
fast as they can. Power output, derived from the acceleration of the flywheel, will be recorded in Watts. 
Power will be averaged for each leg following five trials at maximal effort. Participa nts that have had a 
unilateral hip or knee replacement should not have that side tested.  
 
Grip strength will be measured twice in each hand to the nearest 2 kg using an isometric Hydraulic Hand 
Dynamometer (Jamar, Bolingbrook, IL) and the mean value from the stronger hand used. Participants will 
be excluded from performing the test if they report hand -pain or recent hand or wrist surgery.   
 
Cognitive function will be assessed during screening using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)  
(26), participan ts must score  ≥18 to be eligible . We will also assess psychomotor speed, attention, and 
working memory using the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)  (27; 28). Participants are given a 
series of numbered symbols and then asked to draw the appropriate symbols below a li st of random 
numbers. The score is the number of correctly made matches in 2 minutes (120 seconds).  
 
Body composition  will be measured by circumference measurements of the waist which is made with a 
tape measure.   
 
Blood lipids  (total cholesterol, HDL -Cholesterol, Triglycerides and calculated LDL levels ) will be 
measured at a clinical lab and all results will be entered into the data system.  
 
Activities of daily living will be assessed using the Mobility Assessment Tool – Short Form (MAT -sf). 
This is a no vel, computerized tool for self -assessment of functional performance designed to reduce bias 
from factors such as age, gender and body image.  The Pepper Assessment Tool for Disability (PAT -D) 
will also be used to assess the participant’s ability to complet e an array of important day -to-day activities 
without difficulty and, for a subset of activities, without personal assistance.  
 
Medication  adherence: Although we will attempt to enhance adherence by monthly calls to participants, 
there may be inter -individ ual variability in adherence to the medication . At the end of each phase, 
participants will be asked to return any unused  pills for a pill count to determine participant adherence. 
Our primary analyses will be an intent -to-treat analysis of the effects of the metformin intervention, but 
secondary analyses will include adherence as a covariate.  
 
Analytical Plan   
We will use an analysis of variance model for crossover design to assess the effect of metformin on 
transcriptional  profiles and other aging -related  outcomes.  The factors in the analysis will include the 
baseline measure, sequence, participant  within  sequence, period, and metformin treatment.  We will 
explore for  the metformin by sequence interaction and will base estimates of the metformin effect on 
whether this interaction effect is significant.  We will also perform exploratory, linear regress ion analysis 
with transcriptional changes as the explanatory variables  and changes in other aging -related measures as 
the outcom e variables . The analy sis will b e focused on the eigengene score s of the autophag y and 
oxidative phosphorylation  transcriptional  networks  (and related individual transcriptional measure s).  As 
this is a pilot study, focus of analyses will be on estimation of effects and constructing appr opriate 95% 
confidence intervals for these effects.    
 
 
Human Subjects Protection  
 
Protocol version: 9.4.18  7  
Risk to participants  
The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study, a placebo -controlled study of metformin vs. lifestyle 
intervention in persons with pre -diabetes (included s ubjects with fasting blood glucose 90 -125 mg/dL, n = 
3,234) provides insight into side effects of long -term metformin administration in the elderly and non -
diabetics.29 Of note, the most common side effect was not hypoglycemia, but gastrointestinal symptom s 
(see table below).  
 
 
  
As far as common side effects, GI side effect and diarrhea are transient and usually pass after a week of 
therapy. In the DPP study, 3 -5% of subjects had continuous diarrhea; this portion of subjects would be 
excluded in the prese nt trial during the run -in, dose -titration period. No one had metformin associated 
lactic acidosis. Hypoglycemic events were either not in evidence or reported.  
 
Weight loss is a common occurrence with metformin and will be monitored. In such a case some p atients 
may complain of hypoglycemic symptoms ( rapid heartbeat, feeling light -headed or fainting, and nausea ), 
and in this case subjects will be asked to refrain from taking their next dose . Subjects may not need 
medical interventions, but will be given in struction for fruit juice  or other carbohydrate  and to call the 
coordinator immediately to come in for a blood glucose check. L evels will be checked by f inger 
(Accucheck) and labs to LabCorp to confirm levels .  If blood glucose levels are < 60 mg/dL they w ill be 
removed from the study  and replaced by an additional participant . No more side effects were noted in the 
elderly; in fact, they had a better adherence to therapy.  Young and elderly had the same rates of GI side 
effects and diarrhea.  
 
Subject Recrui tment Methods  
We will recruit these individuals using community -based recruitment strategies including newspaper ads 
and mass mailings. We will also advertise in the VITAL newsletter (BG99 -559) and participate in 
community outreach events.  
 
Informed Consen t 
Written  informed consent will be obtained from each subject. The informed consent process will follow 
 
Protocol version: 9.4.18  8 the procedures of the WFSM Institutional Review Board. The study interviewers will explain the purpose, 
methods and extent of the study to prospective p articipants. The potential participant is asked to read the 
informed consent form and ask questions. The form is written in simple easy to understand language. We 
require study staff to review all of the key aspects of the study verbally with the potential  participants. 
Staff is provided with a structured checklist for this purpose. Staff is then required to question potential 
participants to ascertain whether s/he has understood the information. Potential participants who are 
illiterate or have impaired vi sion must have the consent read to them, followed by review of the checklist, 
opportunity for questions, and discussion. This process will take place in a quiet, private room. A copy of 
the signed and dated consent form will be given to participants, and t he original document will be placed 
in subjects’ individual study files, which will be stored in a secure location. In compliance with the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Standards for Privacy of Individually 
Identifiabl e Health Information of the Department of Health and Human Services, we will access personal 
health information only after obtaining informed consent.  
 
Confidentiality and Privacy  
All data are obtained for research purposes only. Confidentiality of data is  maintained by using research 
identification numbers which uniquely identify each individual. Data will be used only in aggregate and 
no identifying characteristics of individuals will be published or presented. The information collected has 
a low potentia l for abuse because the data do not address sensitive issues. Nevertheless, appropriate 
measures are taken to prevent unauthorized use of study information. Research records are kept in a 
locked room. Data access will be limited to study staff. Information  linking IDs to individuals is kept on a 
secure, password -protected server to which only authorized study personnel will have access. Data and 
records will be kept locked and secured, with any computer data password protected. A web -based data 
entry system  will be created for this study which will allow access only to study staff (user id and 
password required to access). Blinded staff will not have access to blinded study information on the web -
based database. Computer files are stored on file servers, whi ch are backed up each night and stored for 
easy retrieval in case of emergency.  Files may not be obtained from the research unit by persons other 
than the research personnel, who are asked to sign a document agreeing to maintain the confidentiality of 
the information. No data files distributed for analysis will include personal information. No reference to 
any individual participant will appear in reports, presentations, or publications that may arise from the 
study. After the study is completed, the data will be stored with other completed research studies in a 
locked secure area.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring  
The principal investigator  along with the study physician  (William Applegate)  will be responsible for the 
overall monitoring of the data and  safety of  study participants. The study physician will be unmasked to 
treatment assignment as needed and appropriate. The principal investigator will also be assisted by other 
members of the study staff. All participants will have a protocol -driven medical monitori ng plan to 
consistently assess for adverse events or medical safety concerns. In addition, participant safety in all 
Wake Forest Pepper Center OAIC -supported studies is monitored by a Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC). It reviews study recruitmen t, drop -outs, protocol changes, losses to follow -up, and 
adverse events every 6 months. The DSMC has authority to recommend changing or stopping the 
protocol. In the latter case, the PI will immediately act upon the recommendation according to 
institutiona l policy and in consultation with the Wake Forest Pepper Center OAIC Executive Committee.  
 
Reporting of Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events or Deviations  
Any unanticipated problems, serious and unexpected adverse events, deviations or protocol changes w ill 
be promptly reported  by the principal investigator or designated member of the research team  to the IRB 
and sponsor . 
 
 
 
Protocol version: 9.4.18  9 Use of biological samples by other investigators  
Biological samples may be used by investigators other than the investigators of the current study. The use 
will be limited to non -commercial purposes. The names and other personal identifiers of the study 
participants will not be sent to any recipients of the blood samples.  
 
Storage and disposal of biological material  
Blood samples will b e stored at Wake Forest University Medical Center for up to twenty years after the 
end of the trial at which time the samples will be destroyed. Biological specimens will be stored in locked 
-70oC alarmed freezers located in a locked room. The lab coordina tor and the PIs have access to the keys 
of the freezers. All the specimens will have numerical study IDs with no personal identifiers of the 
participants. These are stored under the Pepper Center Tissue Repository (IRB#1219).

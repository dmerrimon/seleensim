Recros Medica Focal Contouring System to perform Rotational Fractional Resection (skin 
resection with and without and focal lipectomy) 
Study Objective : 
The objective is to explore and evaluate the peri-procedure treatment plan for accelerated 
recovery after Rotational Fractional Resection in patients with submental laxity.   
Study Design 
Structure: Prospective, single-center, exploratory, interventional cohort, non-significant risk 
(NSR) study.  
Duration: Approximately 4 months for each subject from the screening visit to the exit visit.  
Visit Schedule : Screening, procedure, Day 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, 30, 45, 60, and 90 post-procedure.  An 
optional visit may occur 5-6 days after procedure.

with and without fat removal for the purpose of submental contouring. 
Study Population Characteristics 
Number of Subjects :  Up to approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled (consented) to ensure up 
to approximately 30 subjects treated at 1 US site.  
Condition/Disease :  Adult subjects with moderate to severe submental laxity. 
Key Inclusion Criteria:  Healthy male or female, at least 30 years old; moderate to severe 
submental laxity; agree to maintain weight (±5%) for the duration of the study 
Key Exclusion Criteria:   History of psoriasis, hyperpigmentation, eczema, rosacea or vitiligo;

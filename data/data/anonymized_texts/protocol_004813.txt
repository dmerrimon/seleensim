BACKGROUND & PROJECT SUMMARY  
Electronic cigarettes (e- cigarettes) have a potential role in smoking cessation and harm 
reduction for tobacco cigarette smokers. As of 2019, the most popular e- cigarette is JUUL, a 
pod type device containing e- liquids with high nicotine content. The goal of this study is to 
better understand the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics responses produced by the 
JUUL e- cigarette, compared to tobacco cigarettes, in e- cigarette and tobacco cigarette 
smokers.  

JUUL vs. Tobacco Cigarettes  IRB# 19 -28309   
2 RESEARCH AIMS  
2.1 SPECIFIC AIM  #1 
To categorize the nicotine PK profile (maximum plasma concentration; time to 
maximum plasma concentration and area under the concentration- time curve) and 
compare when using the JUUL e- cigarette vs. a tobacco cigarette in a standardized 
manner.  
2.2 SPECIFIC AIM  #2 
To categorize the nicotine PK profile (maximum plasma concentration; time to 
maximum plasma concentration and area under the concentration- time curve) and 
compare when using the JUUL e- cigarette vs a tobacco cigarette when using the product 
ad libitum.  
2.3 SPECIFIC AI M #3 
To evaluate various outcomes following JUUL e- cigarette or tobacco cigarette use, both 
with standardized and ad lib use including: heart rate, plasma catecholamines, pulmonary function testing.  
2.4 SPECIFIC AIM  #4 
To evaluate and compare the effects on craving, reward and satisfaction when using the 
JUUL e- cigarette vs. tobacco cigarette.  
 
3 STUDY  DESIGN  
3.1 DESIGN  SUMMARY  
This is an observational, crossover design that will examine the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of impact of smoking tobacco cigarettes or vaping the JUUL electronic cigarette. Participants will recruited in two groups: primary e- cigarette 
vapers and primary cigarette smokers. The order of assignment to either tobacco cigarettes or the JUUL electronic cigarette will be counter -balanced via a latin square 
design.  
3.2 ENROLLMENT  TARGET  
We will enroll a total of 30 participants, across two groups; 15 primary cigarette smokers who may have occasionally used electronic cigarettes and 15 experienced electronic cigarette users who occasionally smoke tobacco cigarettes. We will seek to enroll equal numbers in each group, but will remain flexible during recruitment.

3.4.3  Eligibility  Determination  
Eligibility will begin to be determined via a preliminary REDCap online survey. At 
that time, the CRC will begin an eligibility checklist. The online survey will be followed -up by a phone screen to clarify eligibility questions and the eligibility 
checklist will be updated. Final eligibility criteria will be evaluated via assessments at the in person screening visit, and saliva cotinine. If the participant 
is not taking any medications and has no active psychiatric symptoms, the CRC can 
sign off on the eligibility checklist. Otherwise, the PI and/or Medical Monitor are required to review the participant’s chart and sign off on eligibility.  
3.4.4  Reassessment of  Eligibility  
If there is a positive illicit drug tox at screening, participants will be given 2 -weeks 
to come back and re- screen. In that case, all screening visit procedures are 
repeated.  
JUUL vs. Tobacco Cigarettes  IRB# 19 -28309   
Additionally, if their 5B Day 1 visit is set to occur 30 -90 days past the date of their 
screening visit, participants will be asked over the phone by the CRC if they had 
any recent changes in medications, medical care or tobacco/nicotine use to 
confirm continued eligibility. If the participant’s 5B admissions are more than 90 days past the screening visit, the participant will have to be re- screened.  
 
4 STUDY VISITS &  WINDOWS  
The chart below describes assessment time points and the desired window between visits. The window will remain flexible to accommodate participants’ schedules, and to the discretion of the PI if it is deviated from.  
 
Assessment Time Points  Desired Window  
REDCap survey  N/A  
Phone Screen  N/A  
Screening Visit  Within 30 days of Redcap survey  
Orientation  Within 90 days of Screening Visit  
5B Hospital Study Day 1  24-32 hours after Orientation Visit (morning admission)  
5B Hospital Study Day 2  24 hours - 1-week after H -SD1 (morning admission)  
 
5 STUDY  IDS 
Study IDs will first be assigned at the time of the REDCap  online survey. This ID will start 
with “TRC” to represent “Tobacco Research Center”. This ID will be placed on the eligibility checklist. At the time of consent, a study ID will be assigned beginning with the four digit 5B study research number and followed sequentially starting with 001. For example, the first person consented into the study will be given the ID, 8223 -001. This ID will be added 
to the eligibility checklist and a screening log in Excel will store this ID.  
 
6 STUDY PROCEDURES &  VISITS  
6.1 COVID -19 Screening  
Prior to booking any participant for any in- person visit, we will ask the following 
screening questions via Zoom or on the phone. The answer must be “NO” to all of them; otherwise, they will need to be rescheduled.  
1. Have you had any of the following symptoms in the past 24  hours?  
• Fever (temp >37.8 C or 100 F) 
• Night  sweats  
• Shaking/chills  
• Shortness of  breath  
JUUL vs. Tobacco Cigarettes  IRB# 19 -28309   
• Cough  
• Sore  throat 
• Body  aches  
• Loss of sense of smell or  taste 
2. In the past 14 days, have you had unprotected close contact (within 6 ft for more 
than 15 minutes at a time) with someone you know to be diagnosed with  COVID - 
19? 
(We understand there may be situations in the community in which you may not 
know the status of strangers. Please answer to your best knowledge for those you 
do know, such as those with who have frequent contact)  
3. Have you recently tested positive for  COVID -19? 
 
6.2 SCREENING  VISIT  
The schedule of procedures for the screening visit will occur across two visits. One 
will be a remote visit via Zoom and the other will be an in-person visit.  
The following will occur prior or during the remote visit : 
6.2.1  Consent  Process 
Upon booking the Screening Visit, CRC will initiate the Informed Consent 
process over the phone. The CRC will first determine interest and then send the 
participant the informed consent and PowerPoint to their email for their  review. 
When the participant has had time to review,  the CRC will utilize the phone 
script to engage in the consent discussion, reviewing the purpose, procedures, 
alternatives, benefits, risks and opportunity to ask questions. The CRC will also 
assess understanding by asking the participant to respond to questions about the study. This process will be documented on the informed consent documentation checklist.  
 
If the participant would still like to be in the study, the CRC will explain that they do need the HIPPA form signed and will do that when the partic ipant comes in 
for their in- person visit.  
 
The consent form will be sent to the participant via DocuSign. Upon receiving e- signature from the participant, the CRC will sign the consent form.  
 
The participant will be sent a REDCap  survey link 24 hours before their remote 
visit and asked to complete questionnaires included in the Screening Packet before the remote visit is conducted.  
 
At the remote visit, the CRC will first take time to answer any questions about the study that the participant may have.  
JUUL vs. Tobacco Cigarettes  IRB# 19 -28309   
 
 
6.2.2  Screening  Packet  
Participants will complete the following via their CRC during the remote visit or 
through the direct Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system. The personal data form and medical history will not be entered into the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) 
system, but remain source documents.  
Personal Data Form [paper source]  
o This section contains the participant’s contact information as well as an 
Emergency  Contact.  
Medical History [paper source]  
o This section contains information regarding the participant’s medical history, including exclusionary medical and psychiatric  conditions.  
o If any symptoms are endorsed on the Medical History in Section 8,  the 
CRC will follow up with the participant asking:  
 How often and when was  the last time you experienced these 
symptoms?  
 Do you ever take medication for this? If so, how  often?  
o Notes on the Medical History follow -up will be recorded at the bottom 
of the last page of the form to be reviewed by the study  team.  
Demographics [direct  EDC , sent 24 hrs before online screening visit] 
o This section contains information regarding the participant’s gender, age, ethnicity, race, and  education 
Use/History/Dependence [direct EDC , sent 24 hrs before online screening 
visit]  
o This section contains information regarding participant’s use of 
nicotine replacement therapy,  tobacco and e-cigarette product  use,  and 
drug/alcohol use  
o Embedded in this section are the following standardized 
questionnaires: Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale, Fagerstrom Test 
for Cigarette Dependence, Penn State Electronic Cigarette Dependence 
Index  
The steps for administering and reviewing questionnaires are found in the 
“Administering Forms and Questionnaires SOP.”  
The following will occur during the in-person visit : 
6.2.3  Consent  Documents 
The participant will be asked to sign the consent form (for an original copy to  
JUUL vs. Tobacco Cigarettes  IRB# 19 -28309   
give to the hospital) and two HIPPA forms (one for the Investigator and one for 
the hospital). These must be on source.  
 
The HIPPA form must have “entire medical record” checked off in Section B and the optional activities of banking samples checked off & initialed in Section G. Participant will be presented with the Experimental Subjects Bill of Rights.  
 
The e -consent form will be saved on the study server and held by the study 
team. The signed consent form will be given to 5B and kept at the CTSI.  
6.2.4  Urine  Collection  
Approximately 150 mL of urine will be collected for a drug toxicology and pregnancy test (females only). If positive for illicit drugs without a valid 
prescription, the participant will be dismissed without payment. If positive for 
pregnancy, the participant will be dismissed and paid for the visit. The “Urine Toxicology Screen SOP” and “Pregnancy Screen SOP” are references for these testing processes.  
6.2.5  Physiological  Measures  
The following physiological measures will be assessed:  
• Height and  Weight 
• Blood pressure and heart rate 
Out-of-range blood pressure and heart rates will be re- tested once via manual 
methods at the end of the visit. If still out of range, the participant will be deemed ineligible.  
Steps for these assessments are found in the “Measuring Basic Vitals SOP.”  
6.2.6  Saliva  Collection  
Participants will provide approximately 20mL of saliva for cotinine analysis. The steps for the saliva collection are found in the “Saliva Collection SOP.”  
6.2.7  NicAlert  
A NicAlert will be run in cases when the research team cannot wait for saliva 
cotinine results to come back from the lab. In this case, the NicAlert will serve as 
the primary cotinine eligibility criteria. Before running, these procedures should 
be checked by the project manager.  
6.2.8  End of Screening  Visit  
At the end of the in- person screening visit, the participant will be asked to fill out a 
“Certificate of Participation” in order to receive compensation for the screening 
visit. The participant will be given a urine sample cup to take home. If eligible, they 
will provide a urine sample in this cup and bring in on the day of their orientation.  
JUUL vs. Tobacco Cigarettes  IRB# 19 -28309   
The participant will be dismissed and the CRC will inform them that they will be 
contacted in 1 week with eligibility results from the screening visit.  
The participant’s urine will be discarded and the CRC will store the participant’s saliva in the freezer at the UCSF Tobacco Research Center lab. The saliva samples will be labeled with the Study ID and transferred to the Benowitz Lab at the end of the day on Wednesday afternoons. The CRC will complete a Screening Log on the 
Shared Lab Drive filling in information on the samples dropped off. Cotinine 
results will be expected the following Monday.  
Participant Screening and Enrollment Log Passcode:  
 
 
6.3 ORIENTATION  
After eligibility is determined, an Orientation visit will be conducted via Zoom. The 
orientation visit should be at least 24 hours before the first 5B study day. For example, if a participant was oriented on Monday at 12 noon, they should be booked to begin 5B visit on Wednesday morning. This is to ensure they have at least 1 full day to try the JUUL 
product.  
At the remote orientation visit, the following will occur:  
• The CRC will review with the participant 5B location, procedures and reminders  to 
not use combusted marijuana and to not smoke from 10PM the night before their 
5B admission 
• Participants will watch a training video on JUUL  
• Participants will be given two flavors to choose from (menthol and  tobacco)  
• Participants will collect approximately 150 mL of urine. This will be done at home right after the Zoom visit is complete. This will serve as Baseline total nicotine equivalents as a measure of usual daily intake of  nicotine.  
• Participants  will conduct  a “curb -side  pick -up/drop  off” their  urine to be aliquoted 
into two 20mL vials; one vial pH  adjusted.  
• They will be given their own JUUL device and selected pods (1 -2) to use for one 
whole day before the 5B admission. This will be done within the same day as the Zoom visit, the day before their 5B  admission.  
• If CTSI CRS is available during the orientation, participant and CRC will go to 5B  for 
nurses to conduct a quick vein check. This is for the nurses to inspect the participant’s veins and ensure a successful access the morning of the study.  
• Participants will be randomized, using a Latin square design, to distinguish which 
ARM the participant will start off first for Hospital Study Day  1.

6.4 RT-PCR COVID -19 Testing  Requirement  
CTSI COVID -19 protocols will be followed. . If the participant has a positive result, they 
will not be able to participate at that time. Current guidelines typically include 
remaining in self -quarantine or seeking further care with a provider, should 
symptoms appear or worsen. We will ask that participants re- test no earlier than 14 
days after the initial confirmed positive result. If the re- test is confirmed negative, we 
will allow that subject to participate in the study.

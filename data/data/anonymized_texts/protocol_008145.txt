Postoperative constipation/PEG study  protocol  
V2 060719  
  
 
ABSTRACT  
Postoperative constipation affects up to a third of women undergoing minimally invasive  (MIS) 
gynecologic surgery and is a major  source of anxiety and discomfort . The  average time to  first 
bowel movement after gynecologic surgery is about 2 to 4 days and some  factors responsible 
for this include anesthesia inhibitory effect on gastrointestinal motility, opioid pain medication 
use, chronic NSAID use  and anatomic manipulation [1]. 
 
There are  no established regimens to m anage  postoperative constipation after minimally 
invasive gynecolog ic surgery. A few post -operative regimens have been investigated with mixed 
results.  One such study  evaluat ing the implementation of postoperative bowel regimen with 
polyethylene glycol ( PEG) vs. Docusate  found no significant impact on postoperative bowel 
function  while another found improved constipation with use of Docusate and Senna vs. 
placebo.  [1, 2] . There have been no studies looking at the effect of preoperative bowel regimens 
on postoperative bowel function.  
 
The purpose  of this study  is to evaluate postoperative bowel function after minimally invasive 
hysterectomy  in women receiving a preoperative 1 0-day bowel regimen of PEG daily.  
 
  
 
1.0 STUDY  PURPOSE  AND RATIONALE  
 
Hysterectomy is one of the most commonly performed surgeries in the United States. Many of the 
underlying conditions prompting hysterectomy such as uterine fibroids, pelvic organ prolapse, 
endometr iosis and cancer  contribute to baseline constipation.  Nineteen percent of hysterectomy 
patients and 27% of  patients undergoing prolapse on urinary incontinence surgery  have b aseline 
constipation [3]. Additionally, patients undergoing pelvic surgery are at incr eased risk of 
constipation post -operatively due to anesthesia, bowel manipulation, inactivity and narcotic use 
[4-6]. A study reported that 13.7% of u rogynecology patients called the office post operatively 
with concerns related to constipation [7]. A similar study looking at post -operative complaints in a 
general gynecology population found that 34% of patients reported constipation symptoms after 
discharge [8]. In addition to the bloating and discomfort caused by constipation, avoidance of 
straining with defecation may help prevent the development or recurrence of pelvic organ 
prolapse [9, 10] . Decreasing abdominal straining could also help prevent vaginal cuff dehiscence 
[11, 12]  
 
Postoperative docusate is commonly used after gynecologic surgery to prevent constipation, 
though little evidence exists to support this practice. Several postoperative regimens have been 
investigated but no clearly superior regimen has been identified. In uro gynecology patients, 
docusate plus Senna was found to improve constipation and time to first bowel movement when 
compared with placebo [13].  However, Polyethylene glycol vs. Docusate did not show 
improvement in constipation symptoms or time to first bowel movement [14, 15] .  In the 
Orthopedic literature,  Lubiprostone was found to be equivalent to Senna [16].   
 
Given the high rate of baseline constipation and postoperative constipation in patients undergoing 
hysterectomy, and the unsatisfactory results with postoperative bowel regimens, we hypothesize 
that improving baseline constipation  may help improve post operative patient outcomes. For 
patients undergoing cardiac surgery, preoperative constipation was found to significantly predict 
post-operative constipation rates [17].  
 
Polyethylene glycol is an osmotic laxative that has been shown to be safe, effective and well 
tolerated for the treatment  of both acute and chronic constipation [18]. It is readily available over 
the counter and has been shown to be safe for long-term use. The goal of this study is to assess 
the effect of preoperative administratio n of Polyethylene glycol on post operative constipation 
symptoms and constipation related quality of life.

gynecologic surgery , division of  urogynecology, division of gynecologic oncology       
 
  Single  vs. multi-center:  Single  center  
 
2.2 Study  objectives  
2.2.1  Primary  objective:  To compare  postoperative constipation as measured using 
PAC-QOL & PAC -SYM questionnaires  in women receiving a 1 0-day preoperative bowel 
regimen versus those receiving standard preoperative care ( no intervention )

2.3 Aims  & Hypotheses  
 
2.3a Specific  Aim 1 
To determine  if there  is a difference  in postoperative constipation between  women receiving a 
10-day preoperative bowel regimen and those receiving standard preoperative care ( no intervention ) 
 
2.3a.1 Hypothesis  1

2.4 Data  Management  and Analysis  
In this study,  the primary  objective  is to analyze  the effect  of 10-day preoperative bowel regimen 
on postoperative constipation as measured on PAC -QOL and PAC -SYM validated questionnaire  
 
Justification  of sample  size:  For the PAC -SYS questionnaire the minimal important difference in 
the score is estimated to be 0.5 [19, 20] . Using the PAC -SYS score data  from Edenfield et al  [15] 
and Marciniak  et. al [16]. We estimate that in order to detect a score difference of 0.5 on  the PAC -
SYS score with 80% power and a two-sided  alpha of 0.05 that we would require 78 subjects evenly 
divided into two groups. Assuming that there is a 20% drop out rate we plan to enroll 98 subjects  for 
the main part of the study.  
 
We would like to do a small piolet of 3 patients to confirm that we are able to smoothly conduct the 
study. These 3 will be excluded from the final analysis.  
 
A total of 101 subjects will be enrolled.  
 
General  Analyses  
 
Continuous  variables  will be summarized  using  means,  standard  deviations,  medians,  and 
ranges.  If normally  distributed,  they will be analyzed  using  parametric  tests  such  as T-test and 
analysis  of variance.  To find associations  between  continuous  variables  and to control  by 
relevant  covariates  we will use multiple  regressions.  If the normality  assumption  is violated  we 
will use non-parametric  tests  such  as Mann -Whitney  or Kruskal -Wallis.  
 
Categorical  variables  will be summarized  with frequencies  and percentages  and analyzed  
with logistic  regression  or categorical  response  models. 95% confidence  intervals  will be 
provided  for descriptive  statistics,  as warranted. Subject  characteristics  are assumed  to be 
comparable  at the start of the study  (randomization  design)  and so no formal  statistical  group  
comparisons  will be conducted  on the subject  characteristics.  
 
An overall  alpha -level of 0.05 will be used  as a cut-point  for statistical  significance  and all 
statistical  tests  will be two-sided.  All data will be analyzed  by the University of Chicago Medicine 
Biostatistics  team.

3.0 STUDY  PROCEDURES  
- For the piolet first 3 subjects they will be assigned to the treatment arm. For the 
remaining 98 subjects, a fter informed consent is obtained  subjects  will be randomized  via 
sealed,  opaque  envelopes  containing  a sub-specialty block  scheme  to one of the two 
groups:  
o Control Group : Standard preoperative care (no preoperative bowel regimen)  
o Intervention  Group : Preoperative bowel regimen (PEG 3350)  
 
- Subjects in the intervention group will be given the PEG 3350 (1 0-day supply)  to use  for the 10 
days  prior to surgery.  
- Preoperative data will be obtained from all subjects: basic demographics, use of constipation 
medications, use of daily pain medications, chronic pain history, use of daily fiber 
supplementation, baseline VAS pain scale (general & abdominopelvic pain).  
- Preoperatively, all subjects will be requested to  complete the following questionnaires: Wexner 
Constipation Score Questionnaire , validated PAC -SYM questionnaire, and PAC- QOL 
questionnaire  
- Perioperative data obtained will include procedure name, operative time, complications, 
anesthesia type, length of Hospital stay  
- Post operatively, all subjects will be requested to complete a bowel diary (record BMs), record 
pain medication use, report daily VAS pain scale, complete PAC -SYM questionnaire, PAC - 
QOL questionnaire and Wexner Constipation Score Questionnaire  
 
4.0 STUDY  DRUGS   
MiraLAX, Polyethylene Glycol 3350 is an FDA approved over -the-counter osmotic laxative. It 
works by attracting water in the colon to ease, hydrate and soften stool. MiraLAX relieves 
constipation without gas, bloating, cramping or sudden urgency. In multiple clinical trials, MiraLAX 
has been pro ven to result in a BM within 24 to 72 hours. MiraLAX is formulated as a powder. 1 
packet of powder (17g) is stirred and dissolved in 4 to 8 oz. beverage; to be used daily for at least 
7 days.

7.0 RECRUITMENT  
Benign gynecology, urogynecology or gynecologic oncology surgeons  who perform minimally 
invasive hysterectomy will be asked for their permission to consider their patients for the study.  
 
A member of the research team will search the University of Chicago operating room  schedules of 
the participating providers to identify potential  study  participants  scheduled  to undergo  a minimally 
invasive hysterectomy . Data from the medical record system will be used to evaluate inclusion criteria.  
 
Once a subject has been identified, the research team will contact the operating surgeon via encrypted 
email for permission to contact the specific potential subject for study participation.  
 
A member of the research team will contact the potential subject offer them participation in the 
study and confirm participation  criteria. Once  a patient  is identified  as a potential  study  
participant,  the informed  consent  process  will be completed  as detailed  in the ‘Informed  
Consent  Process’  section.  
 
Please see informed consent section for further discussion of why in person recruitment and 
consent is not planned.  
 
8.0 INFORMED CONSENT  PROCESS  
After  a member of the research staff  determines  eligibility  of study  participants,  the informed  
consent  process  will be completed  in three  possible  ways  as listed/explained  below  by the PI or 
research  staff (Co-investigator  or other  delegated  study  staff):  
 
Option  1: (in person consent)  
- Subject  will be offered  an in person visit with a member of the research staff.  
- During  this visit, the informed  consent  and HIPAA  form will be explained  and all questions  
answered  
- The informed  consent  and HIPAA  form will be signed  by the patient  and a copy  given  to 
them  for their personal  records  
- The original  ‘wet-ink’ signed  consent  and HIPAA  form will be stored  in a locked cabinet in 
the re search coordinator’s  office.  
- After consent, patient will be randomized and preoperative medication will be provided 
based on randomization group  
- All preoperative data as previously outlined will be obtained  
 
Option  2: (phone discussion with paper consent for m) 
- The Subject will be offered a phone discussion. Prior to this phone discussion a copy of 
the consent form will be mailed to the subject. Receipt of consent will be verified before 
the phone consenting process begins.  
- During this conversation the  informed  consent  and HIPAA  form will be explained  and all 
questions  answered  
- Two copies of the consent and a stamped, addressed envelope will be mailed to the 
patient to sign and return the consent form.  
- After receipt of the consent the patien t will be randomized and the subject will be 
randomized and the study medications and/or materials will be mailed to the subject.  
 
Option 3: (phone discussion with electronic consent form)  
Postoperative constipation/PEG study  protocol  
V2 060719  
  
- The Subject will be offered a phone discussion. Prior to this phone discussion an email 
with a link / instructions for accessing REDCap will be sent to the subject. They will be 
instructed to access the electronic form in order to review it during the consenting 
process.  
- During this conversation the  informed  consent  and HIPAA  form will be explained  and all 
questions  answered  
- The patient will sign the electronic consent form accessed through REDCap.  
- Once the consent for is completed electronically the form will be printed and kept in a 
locked filling cabinet for our records.  
- The subject will be randomized and a copy of the signed consent form and the study 
medications and/or materials will be mailed to the subject.  
 
For all options, participants will have access to the consent form prior to and during the 
consenting process. In addition , when  participation  is offered  to the patient,  the informed  
consent  and HIPAA  form will be explained  in detail  along  with the study  design,  procedures,  
inclusion/exclusion  criteria,  risks and benefits,  and study  requirement.  It will be emphasized  
that participation  is completely  voluntary  and that she may revoke  her participation  at any time.  
There  will be no further  documentation  of the informed  consent  process.  
 
We recognize that in person consents are preferable. The above recruiting and consent process is 
being proposed for the following reasons:  
 
1) Patients undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy will often have only one visit with 
the surgeon prior to surgery. During this visit a full history and physical is taken and 
surgical consent is performed. Attempting to perform study consent at this visi t is not 
optimal for the following reasons  
a. It is likely that potential subjects will not be offered enrollment in the study because 
of time constraints.  
b. Consenting for this study on in addition to consent for surgery coul d be 
overwhelming for subjects and limit their ability to give a truly informed consent. A 
phone conversation at a later time would allow for the patient to have more time with 
the research staff and less to digest in one sitting.  
 
2) Hysterectomy patients often have preoperative visits that are several months before 
their surgery.  We would like consent patients for this study closer to the time they will  
be participating in the study.  
 
3) Gynecology sees outpatients at DCAM as well as a number of UCM facilities around 
southland Chicago. The off campus patients have a different socioeconomic and racial 
makeup and thus, should be included.  Without phone recruiting and phone consent 
options off campus locations will have very limited participation for the following reasons  
a. Unless the treating provider is part of the research team, research staff is not 
available at off campus locations.  
b. Many of these patients live far from campus and will not be willing/able to come in 
for a dedicated study visit with our research staff. This would disproportionately 
impact patients who do not drive because of age or socioeconomic status.  
 
We feel that offering consent at a time separate from surgical consent is most respectful of our 
subjects and will allow for true informed consent. Offering a telephone option for consent will 
minimize the burden placed on subjects and be most inclusive. I n person consent will also be 
offered to patients who prefer this.  
 
We additionally feel that offering an electronic consent will limit the burden placed on patients. It 
will limit the number of things that they need to receive in the mail and mail back to us.

9.0 CONFIDENTIALITY  OF STUDY  DATA  
To ensure  confidentiality  of medical  information,  each  patient  will be assigned  a unique  identifier  
in the database  that can be linked  to the medical  record  number.  The database  will be 
password -protected,  encrypted  and stored  on a secure  server  accessible  only from computers  
in the OBGYN department.  Subject  demographics  and date will be entered  into REDCap  
(system  4283).  REDCap  is a mature  and secure  web application  for building  and managing  
online  surveys  and databases.  It allows  data to be exported  to Excel  and SPSS.  
 
REDCap  has the capacity for allowing patients to securely link to questionnaires and consent 
forms. The electronic consent form will be accessed via an email link. Our team has consulted 
with Julissa Acevedo who is in charge of REDCap for CRI. She agrees that RE DCap is HIPPA 
compliant and data is encrypted during transmission, allowing for data collection out -of-
network, off -campus, remotely, etc. Patients are able to sign the consent for with the use of a 
mouse or a touch screen.  
 
10.0 PRIVACY  PROTECTIONS  
The Principal  Investigator  and study  staff will assure  that the subject’s  privacy  will be strictly  
maintained  and that their identities  are protected  from unauthorized  parties.  This will be 
accomplished  by securing  all study  documents  and subject  information.  These  files will be 
accessible  to study  staff only and maintained  in a secure  study  office.  The study  staff will assign  
a code  (numbers and/or  letters)  to the subject  for data analysis.  Documents  that contain  
identifiers  will be kept in a locked  research  office  and/or  stored  within  computers  with password  
protection  and encryption.  We will safeguard  patients’  expectation  that the information  they 
offer will be held in confidence.  We will protect  each  participant’s  information  as prescribed  by 
the University  and Hospital  police  and relevant  Federal  law. 
 
11.0 POTENTIAL  RISKS  
There is minimal additional risk to the subjects in the intervention group. Miralax is an FDA 
approved medication for treatment and prevention of constipation. This medication has mild side 
effects, which may include loose watery or frequent stools. The patients’  privacy  will be protected  
with the highest  level of security  however,  potential  for breaches  in security  must  always  be 
considered.  
 
12.0 DATA  AND  SAFETY  MONITORING  
Study documents and subject information will be collected in files designed specifically for the 
study. These files will be accessible to study staff only and maintained in a locked and secure 
research study office. Electronic data will be stored in a mature and secure web application for 
building and managing online surveys and d atabases.  To ensure confidentiality of medical 
information, each patient will be assigned a unique identifier in the database that could be linked 
to the medical record number. The database will be password -protected, encrypted and stored on 
a secure serv er accessible only from computers in the OBGYN Division. For data analysis, all 
stored data will be exported to Excel and SPSS.  
 
13.0 POTENTIAL  BENEFITS  
Patients in the intervention arm may experience improvement in postoperative constipation. 
There  are otherwise no additional potential  benefits  to participants  of this study.

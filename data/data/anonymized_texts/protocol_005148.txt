 CONFIDENTIAL  CLINICAL STUDY PROTO COL SYNOPSIS  
TITLE  A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study to Evaluate the Effect of 
Praluent on Neurocognitive Function in Patients with Heterozygous Familial 
Hypercholesterolemia or with Non -Familial Hypercholesterolemia at High and Very 
High Cardiovascu lar Risk  
SITE LOCATIONS  
 Principal Investigator  Multinational, up to 300 sites  
Multicenter  
OBJECTIVES  The primary objective of the study is to evaluate neurocognitive function with use of 
Praluent after 96 weeks of treatment versus placebo.  
The secondary objectives are:  
 To evaluate the effect of Praluent in comparison with placebo on lipoproteins  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Praluent  
STUDY DESIGN  This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo controlled trial to evaluate neurocognitive 
function in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH), or in 
non-familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients, at high or very high cardiovascular 
risk.  
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either placebo or 75 mg Praluent 
every 2 weeks (Q2W). Randomization will be stratified by age (<65  or ≥65) and by 
statin use (no statin, low lipophilicity of the concomitant statin, or high lipop hilicity 
of the concomitant statin).  
The study consists of the following 2 periods:  
 A screening period of up to 3 weeks.  
The patient or caregiver will be trained to self -inject/inject using a dose of placebo 
during the screening period or at the first vis it of the double -blind treatment period.  
 A double -blind treatment period of 96 weeks.  
On day 1 (baseline), after completion of study assessments and after collection of 
blood samples, and as soon as possible after the patient is randomized into the 
study,  the first dose of study drug will be administered.  The patient will be 
monitored at the clinical site for 30 minutes after the first dose. Subsequent doses 
of study drug must be administered Q2W. The last dose of study drug will be 
administered at week 9 4. 
Patients’ neurocognitive function will be assessed every 6 months.  
The dose of study drug will be increased (using a blinded process) at the week 12 
visit in patients whose low -density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL -C) levels 
are ≥50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol /L) at week 8.  Those patients who are randomized to 
Praluent will receive Praluent 150 mg Q2W at week 12 and until end of study. All 
patients randomized to placebo will continue to receive placebo.  
Lipid results will be blinded for specimens obtained afte r randomization.  No 
attempts should be made by the investigator or patient to have the patient’s lipid 
values evaluated independently from the time of randomization until the last study 
visit.  
Patients should be on a on a stable regimen of lipid -modifying  therapy (LMT; 
including a maximally -tolerated dose of statin, unless statin -intolerant) for 28  days 
prior to screening, as well as on a stable diet.  Patients will be asked to maintain both 
their statin dose and diet from screening to the end of the study .

ENDPOINTS   
 Primary  The primary outcome measure is the change in Cambridge Neuropsychological Test 
Automated Battery (CANTAB) cognitive domain Spatial Working Memory (SWM) 
strategy score from baseline to week 96.  
 Secondary Endpoints  Exploratory neurocognitive outcome measures to further assess neurocognitive 
function in the CANTAB domains are provided below for each patient:  
 Paired Associates Learning (PAL) at week 96 defined as both a PAL z -score 
change from baseline and PAL raw score change from baseline, following the 
definitions and rules provided for the primary neurocognitive endpoint  
 Reaction Time (RTI) at week 96 defined as both a RTI z -score change from 
baseline and RTI raw score change from baseline, following the definitions and 
rules provided for the primary neurocognitive endpoint  
 SWM between -errors score at week 96 defined as both a SWM between -errors 
z-score change from baseline and SWM between -errors raw score change from 
baseline, following the definitions and rules provided for the primary 
neurocognitive endpoint  
 Global Composite score at week 96 change from baseline is defined as (the 
average of the following 4 measures at week 96: SWM strategy z -score, PAL 
z-score, RTI z -score, and the SWM bet ween -errors z -score) minus the average of 
the same 4 z -score measures at baseline  
Secondary efficacy endpoints are:  
 The percent change in calculated LDL -C, apolipoprotein (Apo) B, 
non-high-density lipoprotein  cholesterol ( non-HDL -C), and total 
cholesterol  (Total -C) from baseline to weeks 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96  
 The percent change in lipoprotein a [Lp(a)], HDL -C, triglyceride (TG), and 
Apo A-1 from baseline to weeks 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96  
 The proportion of patients reaching LDL -C <70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) at 
weeks  12, 24, 48, 72 and 96.  
 The proportion of patients reaching LDL -C <50 mg/dL (1.29 mmol/L) at weeks 
12, 24, 48, 72, and 96  
Other Endpoints   Anti-drug antibody status (positive/negative) and titers assessed at the end of the 
study.

 CONFIDENTIAL   Gonadal hormone level s (for female patients - estradiol, follicle -stimulating 
hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH); for male patients - testosterone, 
FSH and LH)  
PROCEDURES AND 
ASSESSMENTS  The CANTAB will include the following 3 tests which will take approximately 
25 minutes to complete: SWM, PAL and RTI. In addition, efficacy of Praluent will be 
assessed by clinical laboratory evaluation of lipid levels.  
Overall safety will be assessed by monitoring/evaluation of treatment -emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs), physical examinations, blood pressure and heart rate, and 
clinical safety laboratory tests at prespecified time points.  
Blood samples will be collected for determination of anti -drug antibody levels at 
predetermined time points. Research samples and samples for ex ploratory biomarker 
analysis will be collected.  
STATISTICAL PLAN The primary neurocognitive analysis is a statistical evaluation of the noninferiority of 
the Praluent 75 mg Q2W/up -titrate 150 mg Q2W dose regimen to placebo for the 
primary endpoint of change in SWM strategy z -score from baseline to week 96 in the 
primary safety population. The 2 -sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the mean 
treatment difference at week 96 will be determined using an appropriate contrast 
statement in a mixed -effect mod el with repeated measures (MMRM).  The upper CI 
limit will be compared to the noninferiority margin which is defined as 0.2 and the 
noninferiority will be declared if the upper CI limit is below the noninferiority margin.  
To further understand the effects of Praluent on cognitive function and support the 
primary neurocognitive analysis, the 3 domain endpoints (specifically PAL, RTI, and 
SWM between -error scores) and the Global Composite score will also be evaluated 
for noninferiority at week 96 in the prima ry safety population. These 4  measures will 
not be evaluated for superiority.  
For secondary efficacy endpoints of lipids, descriptive summaries and analyses will 
be performed in the intent -to-treat (ITT) population (for ITT analysis) and the 
modified inten t-to-treat (mITT) population (for on -treatment analysis). P -values for 
the testing of study treatment effect will be provided for descriptive purposes only 
(nominal p -values).  
The general safety analysis will be based on the safety analysis population (saf ety 
analysis set [SAF]). The safety variables include reported TEAEs and other safety 
information (ie, clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs). The summary of safety 
results will be presented by the 2 treatment groups (placebo, and Praluent 75 mg 
Q2W /up-titrate 150 mg Q2W). No formal inferential testing will be performed. 
Summaries will be descriptive in nature.  
STUDY DURATION  Each patient is planned to participate in the study for approximately 99  weeks 
(3 weeks of screening and 96 weeks of treatmen t). 
As committed to FDA, the study is expected to complete August, 2020, and a final 
study report will be submitted December, 2020.

 CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION AND RAT IONALE  
Praluent® is a human monoclonal antibody that binds proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 
9 (PCSK9) to inhibit its function. All relevant information concerning the compound is available 
in the latest vers ion of the Investigator’s Brochure. Praluent was approved in the US on 
July 24, 2015 for use, in addition to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy, in adult patients 
with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) or patients with clinical ath erosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) such as heart attacks or strokes, who require additional lowering of 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL -C).  Praluent was approved in the EU on 
23 September 2015 for use in adults with primary hyperchol esterolemia (heterozygous familial 
and non -familial) or mixed dyslipidemia, as an adjunct to diet in combination with a statin or statin 
with other lipid lowering therapies in patients unable to reach LDL -C goals with the maximum 
tolerated dose of a statin , or alone or in combination with other lipid -lowering therapies in patients 
who are statin -intolerant or for whom a statin is contraindicated.  
Praluent is also referred to as alirocumab, REGN727 or SAR236553. In the context of the 
R727 -CL-1532 clinical st udy protocol, it will be referred to as Praluent.  
1.1. Introduction  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo controlled trial to evaluate neurocognitive function in 
patients with heFH, or in non -familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients, at high or very hi gh 
cardiovascular risk. To objectively evaluate neurocognitive function, the Cambridge 
Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) will be employed. In addition, this study 
will evaluate the effect of Praluent on LDL -C, various lipid sub -fractions, and overall safety.  
Studies (trials and observational) have linked midlife and late -life cardiovascular risk factors to 
cognitive function ( Joas 2012 , Mielke 2010 , Reijmer 2012 ). A rec ent epidemiological study has 
also shown that cumulative exposure to cardiovascular risk factors from early to middle adulthood, 
especially above guideline -recommended targets, was associated with worse cognition in midlife 
(Yaffe 2 014). This was a prospective study of 3381 adults (age, 18 to 30  years at baseline) with 
25 years of follow -up. Assessment of cognitive function was performed at year 25 (2010 to 2011) 
with the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Stroop Test, and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test 
analyzed with standardized z scores. The primary predictor was 25 -year cumulative exposure 
estimated by areas under the curve for resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures, fasting blood 
glucose, and total cholesterol (Total -C). H igher cumulative systolic and diastolic blood pressures 
and fasting blood glucose were consistently associated with worse cognition on all 3 tests. These 
associations were significant, primarily for exposures above recommended guidelines; cognitive 
test z scores were between 0.06 and 0.30 points less, on average, for each 1 -standard deviation 
increase in risk factor area under the curve after adjustment for age, race, sex, and education 
(p<0.05 for all). Fewer significant associations were observed for chol esterol.  
Although accumulating data from observational studies suggest that cardiovascular risk factors 
may be modifiable risk factors for cognitive impairment ( Kivipelto 2001 , Whitmer 2005 ), 
randomized controlled trials targeting the treatment of these conditions, including hypertension, 
dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus have reported mixed results ( Shepardson  2011 , Staessen  2011 , 
Morris 2012 ).

 CONFIDENTIAL  Additionally, in 2012, the Food and Drug Administration expanded its advice on statin risks to 
include memory loss or confusion. Review of published data on statins does not suggest an adverse 
effect of statins on cognition, but the strength of available evidence is limited, particularly 
regarding high dose statins ( Richardson 2013 ). In addition, highly lipophilic statins with specific 
pharmacokinetic properties (atorvastatin, simvastatin) appear to confer a significant ly greater risk 
of adverse cognitive effects compared to other lipophilic statins and those with hydrophilic 
solubility properties ( Sahebzamani 2014 ). 
The brain synthesizes or re -uses up to 95% of its cholesterol requirements ( Pfrieger 2011 ), thus, 
limiting the potential biological impact of low -circulating LDL -C on central nervous system 
function. Moreover, LDL particles have not been reported to cross the blood -brain barrier. 
Consequently, low levels of circ ulating LDL -C are unlikely to affect central nervous system 
cholesterol metabolism and function. Moreover, monoclonal antibodies, including Praluent, would 
not cross the blood brain barrier and are unlikely to have direct effects on the brain.  However, 
limited clinical data are available on the impact of very low circulating LDL on neurocognitive 
function.  
Neurocognitive events were reported overall at a low incidence in the phase 3 Praluent 
development program. Analysis of neurocognitive events using a pr edetermined set of adverse 
event (AE) terms from both the placebo - and ezetimibe -controlled pools did not reveal an 
imbalance for any particular event in double -blind studies up to 18 months of treatment with 
Praluent.  
Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Aut omated Battery Assessment  
The proposed neurocognitive test battery (CANTAB) targets key cognitive domains commonly 
affected by pharmacological manipulation, including psychomotor processing speed, visual 
episodic memory, working memory, and executive funct ion. The CANTAB has been widely used 
as a tool for assessment of patterns of cognitive function in a wide variety of neurological and 
psychiatric disorders such as dementia, schizophrenia, depression, and Parkinson’s Disease 
(De Jager 2005 , Bartok 2005 , Weiland -Friedler 2004 , Foltynie 2003 ). These tests have been 
employed extensively in clinical trials and have been shown to be sensitive to pharmacological 
manipu lation in healthy individuals, both in compounds inducing cognitive deficits ( Rusted  1988 , 
Jäkälä 1999 , Harmer 2001 , Ryan 2006 ), and those showing procognitive effects ( Elliott 1997 , 
Greig 2005 , Randall 2005 , Attwood 2007 ).  
All tests in the battery are nonverbal and culturally neutral and suitable for use in nonliterate or 
multicultural populations. This also facilitates the use of the battery in multinational trials as data 
will be valid regardless of cultural background. The CANTAB is self -administered using a 
computer and touch sensitive monitor, which allo ws immediate feedback. Parallel modes and 
automatic stimuli randomization ensure participants can be re -tested over time for longitudinal 
studies. Inter -rater variance is greatly reduced with standardized test delivery and CANTAB tests 
also have translatio nal utility, meaning that data can be compared directly to preclinical findings. 
CANTAB Connect Research software has been validated for use on all iPad Air devices and is 
fully Good Clinical Practice (GCP) -compliant, meeting regulations for computerized s ystems used 
in clinical research and 21 CFR Part 11.

 CONFIDENTIAL  The proposed CANTAB includes the following 3 tests which will take approximately 25  minutes 
to complete: Spatial Working Memory (SWM), Paired Associates Learning (PAL), and Reaction 
Time (RTI).  
Spatial Working Memory  
Spatial Working Memory requires retention and manipulation of visuospatial information, and 
assesses the ability of the participant to retain spatial information and manipulate it in working 
memory.  This is a self -ordered task that has not able executive function demands, and measures 
strategy use as well as errors.  These are reported as 2 separate end points: between search errors, 
reflecting the cognitive domain of working memory; and a score reflecting the use of a consistent 
search stra tegy, reflecting the cognitive domain of executive function.  A number of colored boxes 
are presented on the screen, and the computer hides a token in these boxes one at a time.  The 
participant is instructed to touch the boxes in turn to search for the to ken that has been hidden.  
When a token is found it should be placed in a home area on the right side of the screen.  The 
participant then searches for more tokens until the same number of tokens as the number of colored 
boxes has been found.  The key task  instruction is that the computer will never hide a token in the 
same colored box twice in the same problem.  As the test progresses, so it becomes more difficult.  
Spatial Working Memory performance is impaired by damage to the prefrontal cortex, especial ly 
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.  Similarly, in neuroimaging studies in healthy volunteers, SWM 
performance is associated with activations in the dorsolateral and mid ventrolateral prefrontal 
cortex.  
Paired Associates Learning  
Paired Associates Lear ning assesses visual memory and new learning, and is a sensitive tool for 
accurate assessment of episodic memory.  Boxes are displayed on the screen and open in turn to 
reveal a number of patterns.  Participants are instructed to try to remember the locati on in which 
each pattern was shown.  After all the boxes have been opened, each pattern is then shown in the 
center of the screen in a randomized order, and the participant touches the box in which the pattern 
was located.  If an error is made, all the pat terns are re -presented to remind the participant of their 
locations.  As the test progresses so the stages become more difficult, the number of patterns to be 
remembered will increase up to a maximum of 8 patterns.  For participants who fail to complete 
all levels, an adjusted total is calculated that allows for errors predicted in the stages that were not 
attempted.  Successful performance of the PAL test is dependent on functional integrity of the 
temporal lobe, particularly the entorhinal cortex.  
Reacti on Time  
Reaction Time provides assays of motor and mental response speeds, as well as measures of 
movement time, RTI, and response accuracy.  In this 5 -choice RTI task the participant holds down 
a button at the bottom of the screen until a yellow spot app ears in 1 of 5 circles at the top of the 
screen.  They must then release the button and touch inside the circle where the yellow spot 
appeared as quickly as they can. Practice trials are included to familiarize participants with the 
task.

 CONFIDENTIAL  1.2. Rationale  
1.2.1.  Rationa le for Study Design  
The primary goal of this study is to evaluate neurocognitive function in heFH patients and non -FH 
patients at high or very high cardiovascular risk receiving Praluent compared with placebo after 
96 weeks of treatment. The 96 -week treatm ent duration is considered sufficient to evaluate the 
effect of Praluent on neurocognitive function.  
1.2.2.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
This study will use the 75 mg Praluent every 2 weeks (Q2W) regimen, the recommended starting 
dose for Praluent in the US (or u sual starting dose in EU), with an increase to 150 mg Q2W at 
week 12 (using a blinded process) if LDL -C is ≥50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L) at week 8. This is the 
titration threshold being used in ODYSSEY OUTCOMES, an ongoing study assessing the effect 
of Praluent o n major cardiovascular events. It is supported by findings from post -hoc analyses of 
the PROVE -IT, TNT and JUPITER trials, aiming to achieve an LDL -C level within the 
‘physiologic ideal’ zone.

 CONFIDENTIAL  3. STUDY DESIGN  
3.1. Study Description and Duration  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo controlled trial to evaluate neurocognitive function in 
patients with heFH, or in non -FH patients, at high or very high cardiovascular risk.  
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either placebo or 75 mg Praluent Q2W. 
Randomization will be stratified by age (<65 or ≥65) and by statin use (no statin, low lipophilicity 
of the concomitant statin, or high lipophilicity of the concomitant statin).  
The study cons ists of the following 2 periods, which are shown schematically in Figure  1. 
 A screening period of up to 3 weeks.  
The patient or caregiver will be trained to self -inject/inject using a dose of placebo 
during the screening period or at the first visit of the double -blind treatment period.  
 A double -blind treatment period of 96 weeks.  
On day 1 (baseline), after completion of study assessments and after collection of blood 
samples, and as soon as possible after the patient is randomized into the study, the first 
dose of s tudy drug will be administered. The patient will be monitored at the clinical 
site for 30  minutes after the first dose. Subsequent doses of study drug must be 
administered Q2W. The last dose of study drug will be administered at week  94.  
Patients’ neuroco gnitive function will be assessed every 6 months.  
The dose of study drug will be increased (using a blinded process) at the week 12 visit 
in patients whose LDL -C levels are ≥50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L) at week 8. Those patients 
who are randomized to Praluent wil l receive Praluent 150 mg Q2W at week 12 and 
until end of study. All patients randomized to placebo will continue to receive placebo.  
Lipid results will be blinded for specimens obtained after randomization. No attempts 
should be made by the investigator o r patient to have the patient’s lipid values evaluated 
independently from the time of randomization until the last study visit.  
Patients should be on a stable regimen of lipid -modifying therapy (LMT) (including a 
maximally -tolerated dose of statin, unless  statin -intolerant) for 28 days prior to 
screening, as well as on a stable diet. Patients will be asked to maintain both their statin 
dose and diet from screening to the end of the study.

 CONFIDENTIAL  5. STUDY TREATMENTS  
The study treatment is 1 subcutaneous (SC) injection Q2W of 1 mL, as follows:  
 Placebo group: 1 injection of placebo Q2W  
 Praluent 75 mg Q2W/up -titrate 150 mg Q2W: 1 injection of 75 mg Q2W Praluent with 
an increase to 1 injection of 150 mg Q2W at week 12 (using a blinded process) if LDL -
C is ≥50  mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L) at week 8  
The injections will be provided in prefilled pens and will be ad ministered SC into the abdomen, 
thigh, or outer area of the upper arm.  
The patient or caregiver will use placebo for injection training at the clinical site (see  Section  5.1).  
On day 1 (baseline), after completion of study assessments and after collection of blood samples, 
and as soon as possible after the patient is randomized into the study, the first dose of double -blind 
study drug will be administered in the clinic.  The patient will be monitored at the clinical site for 
30 minutes after the first dose. Subsequent doses of study drug must be administered Q2W.  
Doses of study drug should be administered at app roximately the same time of day (based upon 
patient preference) throughout the study.  It is acceptable for dosing to fall within a window of 
±3 days.  
In the event an injection is delayed by more than 7 days or completely missed, the patient should 
return to the original schedule of study drug dosing without administering additional injections.  If 
the delay is less than or equal to 7 days from the missed date, the patient should administer the 
delayed injection and then resume the original dosing schedule.  
Site personnel will provide the patient/caregiver with detailed instructions for transport, storage, 
preparation, and administration of study drug.  
5.1. Injection Training  
After study eligibility is confirmed, the patient or caregiver will be trained to self -inject/inject 
using placebo at visit 2.  Injection training can be done at visit 3 (as an alternative to or in addition 
to visit  2) using placebo.  All patients and caregivers who will inject study drug must be trained 
by the study staff.  
Investigators wil l have the option of providing a second placebo dose to patients who require 
additional injection training before randomization.  The patient and/or investigator may elect to 
inject the additional dose of placebo at home or at the study site.  
5.2. Investigation al and Reference Treatments  
Sterile Praluent drug product is supplied at a concentration of 75 mg/mL or 150 mg/mL in 
histidine, pH 6.0, polysorbate 20, and sucrose in a prefilled pen.  
Placebo matching Praluent is supplied in the same formulation as Praluen t, without the addition of 
protein, in a prefilled pen.  
In case of disruption of supply of prefilled pens, patients will be switched to the use of prefilled 
syringes of placebo, 75 mg and 150 mg, with 1 injection of 1 mL for each of these doses. Should

 CONFIDENTIAL  disruption occur, site staff will train all patients/caregivers on the correct administration using the 
prefilled syringe.  
5.3. Background Treatment  
Patients should be on their maximally tolerated dose of statin as defined in inclusion criterion 4 
(Section  4.2.1 ).  The statin dose should remain stable throughout the en tire study, from screening 
to the end of study visit.  If a patient is not taking the maximally allowed dose (per the label for 
that region or country), or if the patient is statin intolerant, a justification should be provided in the 
electronic case repor t form (e -CRF).  
Background treatment with LMTs is allowed for all patients (those who are using concomitant 
statins and for those who are not).  The background LMT dose should remain stable throughout 
the entire study, from screening to the end of study vi sit. 
5.4. Dose Modification  
In patients whose LDL -C levels are ≥50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L) at week 8 (visit 4), the dose will be 
increased in a double -blind manner beginning at week 12 (visit 5), as follows:  
 Placebo group: no change; placebo Q2W  
 Praluent 75 mg Q2W group: 150 mg Praluent Q2W  
To maintain the blind, the sites and the sponsor’s operational team will be blinded to LDL -C results 
and to dose modification.  
5.5. Method of Treatment Assignment  
The randomized list of treatment kit numbers will be generated centrally. An interactive voice 
response system (IVRS) and/or interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used in this study. 
Study drug will be packaged in accordance with this list.  
Patients will be randomly assigned to receive placebo or Praluent 75 mg Q2W in a 1:1 ratio 
stratified by age (<65 or ≥65) and by statin use (no statin, low lipophilicity of the concomitant 
statin, or high lipophilicity of the concomitant statin).  
Depending on each site’s preference, the centralized treatment allocation syst em can be accessed 
by the IVRS or the IWRS. The treatment kit numbers will be allocated using the centralized 
treatment allocation system at the randomization visit, at weeks specified in Table  1 as re -supply 
visits, and at unscheduled visits, if needed. The treatment kit allocated at week 12 for patients 
randomized to the Praluent treatment groups will be based on their week 8 LDL -C level (see 
Section  5.4). 
5.5.1.  Blinding  
Study patients, the principal investigators, and study site personnel will remain blinded to all 
randomization assignments throughout the double -blind portion of the study.  The Regeneron 
Study Director, Medical Monitor, Study Monitor, and any other Regeneron and contract research 
organization (CRO) personnel who are in regular contact with the study site will remain blinded 
to all patie nt randomization assignments.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Lipid results from blood samples collected after the randomization visit will not be communicated 
to the sites, and the sponsor’s operational team will not have access to these laboratory results until 
after the final database  lock.  
Sites and the sponsor’s operational team will be blinded to changes in treatment dose in the event 
a patient meets a criterion for a change in dose.  
Blinded study drug kits coded with a medication numbering system will be used. In order to 
maintain  the blind, lists linking these codes with product lot numbers will not be accessible to 
individuals involved in study conduct.  
Anti-drug antibody (ADA) results will not be communicated to the sites, and the sponsor’s 
operational team will not have access to results associated with patient identification until after the 
final database lock.  
Information on unblinding is provided in Section  5.5.2 . 
5.5.2.  Emerge ncy Unblinding  
Unblinding  of treatment assignment for a patient  may be necessary due to a medical emergency or 
any other significant medical event (eg,  pregnancy).  
 If unblinding  is required:  
 Only the investigator will make the decision to unblind  the treatment assignment.  
 Only the affected patient will be unblinded.  
 The designated study pharmacist(s)/designee at the study site will provide the 
treatment assignment to the investigator.  If there is no study pharmacist, the 
investigator for the site  will unblind the patient.  
 The investigator must notify Regeneron and/or designee before unblinding the 
patient, whenever possible.  
5.6. Treatment Logistics and Accountability  
5.6.1.  Packaging, Labeling, and Storage  
A medication numbering system will be used in labeli ng blinded investigational study drug 
provided in individual prefilled pens. Lists linking medication numbers with product lot numbers 
will be maintained by the groups (or companies) responsible for study drug packaging. In order to 
maintain the blind, the  lists will not be accessible to individuals involved in study conduct.  
Training kits containing 1 placebo prefilled pen will be provided to the sites for patient/caregiver 
injection training that will be performed before randomization at the injection tra ining visit or at 
the baseline visit. A second placebo prefilled pen can be used before randomization if the 
patient/caregiver requires additional injection training.  
Study drug will be refrigerated at the site at a temperature of 2ºC to 8ºC. Storage tempe rature will 
be logged. Detailed storage instructions are provided in the study manual.

 CONFIDENTIAL  5.6.2.  Supply and Disposition of Treatments  
Study drug will be shipped at a temperature of 2ºC to 8ºC to the investigator or designee as needed 
during the study. At specified t ime points during the study (ie, interim site monitoring visits), at 
the site close -out visit, and after drug reconciliation and documentation by the site monitor, all 
opened and unopened study drug will be returned to the sponsor or designee according to directions 
provided in the study manual.  
Study drug will be dispensed to each patient and transported to the patient’s home. Study drug will 
be stored, prepared, and administered by the patient/caregiver according to instructions provided 
to each patient/c aregiver.  
5.6.3.  Treatment Accountability and Compliance  
All accountability and compliance records must be made available for inspection by the sponsor 
and regulatory agency inspectors. Photocopies must be provided to the sponsor at the conclusion 
of the study.  
Patients will complete a dosing log to document compliance with study drug administration. 
Measures taken to ensure and document study drug accountability and compliance are as follows:  
 The investigator or designee will obtain via IVRS/IWRS the treatment k it number(s) 
and will dispense the treatment kit(s) to the patient.  
 Accountability is to be verified during study drug kit re -supply visits only. The used 
and unused kit(s) should be brought to these visits for accountability purposes.  
 All kits, including used and unused kits, are to be returned by the patient at the 
designated visit. An unused kit contains all of the unused prefilled pens. A used kit is 
one from which the patient has removed 1 or more prefilled pens. A used prefilled pen 
is one that has be en removed from the kit with the intention of administration, including 
those injections that have been partially or fully injected. The patient should discard all 
used prefilled pens into the sharps container and never put used prefilled pens back into 
the used kit.  
 All sharps containers should be returned to the site by the patient.  
 The investigator/study coordinator will enter data in the appropriate e -CRF pages, 
according to data recorded in the treatment log form.  
 The monitor will check the data consis tency among e -CRF pages, treatment log form 
and returned unused prefilled pens of a corresponding kit.  
All treatments kits will be retrieved by the sponsor. A detailed treatment log of the returned study 
drug will be established with the investigator or de signee and countersigned by the investigator 
and the monitoring team.  
5.7. Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications should be kept to a minimum during the study. If considered necessary 
for the patient’s welfare and unlikely to interfere with study drug,  concomitant medications (other 
than those that are prohibited during the study) may be given at the discretion of the investigator, 
at a stable dose when possible.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Any treatment administered from the time of informed consent to the end of the study will b e 
considered concomitant medication. This includes medications that were started before the study, 
and are ongoing during the study.  
5.7.1.  Allowed Concomitant Medications  
Lipid -modifying therapies, nutraceuticals, and over -the-counter therapies that may affect l ipids are 
allowed only if they have been used at a stable dose and regimen for at least 4 weeks before the 
screening visit and during the screening period. The dose and regimen must remain stable during 
the double -blind treatment period (see Section  5.7.3 ). 
5.7.2.  Prohibited Medications  
Commercially -available PCSK9 antibodies are prohibited from the initial screening visit until the 
end of the study visit.  
Sleep -aid medications are prohibited the night before the baseline visit, or the week 24, week 48, 
week 72, or week 96 visits. If the patient used such medication, the visit should be rescheduled as 
soon as possible.  
5.7.3.  Rescue Treatment for LDL -C Increase >25 % 
An LDL -C increase >25% compared with the randomization visit LDL -C on 2 consecutive 
occasions (Section  7.6.3.1 ) will generate an alert that the pa tient may require rescue therapy.  The 
investigator should determine whether a reasonable explanation exists for insufficient LDL -C 
control (such as an alternative medical cause like corticosteroid use, etc.), and in particular should 
ensure that  
 Complianc e with diet is appropriate  
 Compliance with background LMT is appropriate and ongoing  
 Study treatment is given as planned  
If any of the above factors can reasonably explain the insufficient LDL -C control, the investigator 
should stress the absolute need to be compliant with all treatments and, if necessary, organize a 
specific interview with a qualified nutrition professional and stress the absolute need to be 
compliant with diet, and perform a blinded LDL -C assessment within 1 to 2 months prior to 
initiatin g rescue treatment.  
Rescue treatment may be initiated as outlined in  Appendix  10, in the event that no reason for LDL -
C above the threshold value ca n be found.

 CONFIDENTIAL  6.2. Primary and Secondary Endpoints  
6.2.1.  Primary Neurocognitive Endpoint  
The primary outcome measure is the change in CANTAB cognitive domain SWM strategy score 
from baseline to week 96.  Two definitions will be provided for this endpoint, specifically:  
 SWM strategy z -score change from baseline is defined for each patient as: week 96 
SWM strategy z -score minus the patient’s baseline SWM strategy z -score.  The change 
from baseline SWM strategy z -score is used for the primary analysis evaluati on of 
noninferiority.  A lower score denotes better SWM function (ie, less impairment).  
 A patient’s SWM strategy z -score at week 96 is defined as: (week 96 SWM strategy 
raw score minus the SWM strategy mean baseline score) divided by the SWM 
strategy basel ine standard deviation.  The SWM strategy mean baseline score and 
the SWM strategy baseline standard deviation are calculated using patients in both 
treatment groups (ie, Praluent and placebo).  
 The SWM strategy z -score at baseline is defined for each patie nt in the same 
manner as the calculation for the SWM strategy z -score at week 96, replacing the 
patient’s week 96 raw score with the patient’s baseline raw score.  
 SWM strategy raw score change from baseline is defined for each patient as: week 96 
SWM strat egy raw score minus the patient’s SWM strategy baseline score.  The SWM 
strategy raw score change from baseline is provided descriptively for clinical 
interpretation of function at week 96.  Lower change from baseline raw scores reflect 
better SWM performa nce (ie, less impairment).  
The baseline SWM strategy score is the last score obtained before the first dose of study treatment. 
The SWM Strategy score at week 96 is the score obtained within the week 96 analysis window 
and during the treatment -emergent adv erse event (TEAE) period. The TEAE period is defined as 
the time from the first double -blind study treatment injection up to 70 days after the last 
double -blind study treatment injection. The analysis window used to allocate a time point to a 
measurement w ill be defined in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
6.2.2.  Exploratory Neurocognitive Endpoints  
Exploratory neurocognitive outcome measures to further assess neurocognitive function in the 
CANTAB domains are provided below for each patient:  
 PAL at week 96 defi ned as both a PAL z -score change from baseline and PAL raw 
score change from baseline, following the definitions and rules provided for the 
primary neurocognitive endpoint  
 RTI at week 96 defined as both a RTI z -score change from baseline and RTI raw score 
change from baseline, following the definitions and rules provided for the primary 
neurocognitive endpoint  
 SWM between -errors score at week 96 defined as both an SWM between -errors z -score 
change from baseline and SWM between -errors raw score change from b aseline, 
following the definitions and rules provided for the primary neurocognitive endpoint

 CONFIDENTIAL   Global Composite score at week 96 change from baseline is defined as (the average of 
the following 4 measures at week 96: SWM strategy z -score, PAL z -score, RTI z -score, 
and the SWM between -errors z -score) minus the average of the same 4 z -score 
measures at baseline  
Standard outcome measures to assess general safety include overall AEs, SAEs (includes patient 
death), AEs causing discontinuation, adverse events of special interests (AESI), review of 
neurocognitive AEs, vital signs and laboratory values.  
6.2.3.  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are provided below. For those efficacy endpoints described as 
percent change from baseline at a given visit, the definition is: 100 multiplied (post -baseline visit 
measurement – baseline measurement) divided by the baseline measurement.  
The baseline measurements are the last values obtained before the first dose of study treatment.  
The secondary efficacy e ndpoint at a given visit is the measurement obtained within the analysis 
window of the visit and during the main efficacy period. The main efficacy period is defined as 
the time from the first double -blind study treatment injection up to the upper limit of  the week 96 
analysis window.  
All secondary efficacy endpoints (scheduled or unscheduled) may be used to provide a value for 
the efficacy endpoint, if appropriate, according to above definition. The analysis window used to 
allocate a time point to a measur ement will be defined in the SAP:  
 The percent change in calculated LDL -C, apolipoprotein (Apo) B, non -high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL -C), and Total -C from baseline to weeks 12, 24, 48,

CONFIDENTIAL  7.2. Study Visit Descriptions  
For all visits after the randomization visit, if the visit 1 date is changed, then the next visit should 
take place according to the original study schedule.  
Alcohol consumption within 48 hours and intense physical exercise within 24 hours preceding 
blood sampling are discouraged.  
7.2.1.  Unscheduled Visits  
All attempts should be made to keep patients on the study schedule. Unscheduled visits may be 
necessary to repeat testing or for a proper follow -up.  
7.3. Handling of Study Drug Discontinuation and Patient Withdrawal 
from the Study  
7.3.1.  Study Drug Discontinuation  
Study drug should be continued whenever possible. In the event study drug dosing is stopped, it 
should be determined if the stop can be made temporarily. Permanent discontinuation should be a 
last resort. In any case, the patient should remain in the study as long as possible.  
Patients who prema turely discontinue study drug should remain in the study and undergo all study 
visits and procedures, with the exception of dosing with study drug. At the time of study drug 
discontinuation, the patient should have, as soon as possible, an unscheduled visi t with the 
assessments that are normally done at the end of study (EOS) visit (this should take place within 
5 days of discontinuation of study drug, if possible), and then resume the original study schedule 
until end of study.  
Assessment of patients who do not consent to remain in the study after discontinuation of study 
drug should be managed according to Section  7.4.1 . 
7.3.1.1.  Reasons for Temporary Discon tinuation of Study Drug  
Temporary discontinuation of study drug may be considered by the investigator because of 
suspected AEs, including allergic events related to the dose of study drug. Reinitiating study drug 
dosing will be done under close and appropr iate clinical and/or laboratory monitoring.  
Temporary discontinuation of study drug is defined as 1 or more scheduled injections that are not 
administered to the patient as decided by the investigator.  
7.3.1.2.  Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Patients should permanently discontinue study drug for the following reasons:  
 Pregnancy, intention for pregnancy, or no longer with effective contraceptive method 
of birth control (females enrolled in this study, only)  
 Acute injection reaction of clinical co ncern  
 SAE (or non -serious but severe in intensity) of hypersensitivity reaction considered 
related to study drug

CONFIDENTIAL   At patient request  
 If, in the investigator's opinion a patient’s cognition deteriorates to the degree of Mild 
Cognitive Impairment (MCI), or de mentia, the investigator will seek diagnostic 
confirmation from the required specialist per local practice. If diagnosis is confirmed, 
study drug may be discontinued  
 If, in the investigator's opinion, continuation of study drug dosing would be detrimental  
to the patient's well being  
 Intercurrent condition that requires discontinuation of study drug  
 At the specific request of the sponsor  
 Patient receives double -blind treatment before randomization  
The IVRS/IWRS should be notified when a patient prematurely discontinues study treatment.  
Note: Patients who discontinue study treatment should be encouraged to continue to participate in 
the study and, at a minimum, return for the primary endpoint assessment at week 96.  
7.4. Patient Withdrawal from the Study  
A patient  has the right to withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, and without 
repercussion.  
The investigator and sponsor have the right to withdraw a patient from the study in the event of an 
intercurrent illness, AE, treatment failure, protocol viola tion, and for administrative or other 
reasons. An excessive rate of withdrawals would render the study uninterpretable; therefore, 
unnecessary withdrawal of patients should be avoided.  
7.4.1.  Early Termination from the Study  
If for any reason the patient refuses to continue the study, the patient should undergo an 
unscheduled visit with assessments normally planned at the end of study visit (it should take place 
within 5 days of treatment discontinuation, if possible). The patient should be followed until 
recovery  or stabilization of any AE. An end of study visit can take place with assessments as 
specified in the end of study visit after the premature discontinuation of study drug (see Table  1). 
The investigator should make the best effort to contact any patient (eg, contacting patient’s family 
or private physician, reviewing available registries or health care database) who fails to return to 
the site and to d etermine health status, including vital status at a minimum. Attempts to contact 
such patients must be documented in the patient’s records (eg, times and dates of attempted 
telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter).  
7.5. Replacement of Patient s 
Patients who are prematurely discontinued from the study will not be replaced.

Medical/surgical history, medication history  related to lipid -modifying therapy , demographics, 
height, hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody testing, HIV testing, serum pregnancy 
testing, GDS -S and MoCA, and the Motor Screening Task will be performed for the purpose of 
determining study eligibility or characterizing the baseline popul ation.  
7.6.2.  Neurocognitive Assessment Battery Procedures  
7.6.2.1.  CANTAB  
The CANTAB will be performed at time point according to Table  1 and includes the following 3 
tests, which will take approximately 25 minutes to complete: SWM, PAL, and RTI. Training will 
be done at screening. Additional details will be provided in the study manual.  
7.6.3.  Efficacy Procedures  
All laboratory samples will be collected before the dose of s tudy drug is administered.  
Alcohol consumption within 48 hours or intense physical exercise within 24 hours preceding blood 
sampling is discouraged.  
Total cholesterol, HDL -C, TG, Apo B, Apo A -1, and Lp(a) will be directly measured by the central 
laboratory . Low -density lipoprotein cholesterol will be calculated using the Friedewald formula. 
If TG values exceed 400 mg/dL (4.52 mmol/L), or if calculated LDL -C values are below 15 mg/dL, 
then the central lab will reflexively measure LDL -C using the beta quantif ication method. 
Non-HDL -C will be calculated by subtracting HDL -C from the Total -C. The Apo B/Apo A -1 ratio 
will be calculated.  
Detailed procedures of sample preparation, storage, and shipment are provided in the laboratory 
manual.  
7.6.3.1.  Lipid Panel  
Blood sampl es for the lipid panel (Total -C, TG, HDL -C, non -HDL -C, calculated LDL -C, Apo  B, 
Apo A -1, Apo B/Apo A -1 ratio, and Lp(a)) will be collected at time points according to Table  1. 
Lipid results from blood samples obtained after the randomization visit will not be communicated 
to the investigators.  Sites will be notified if the following occurs: LDL -C increase >25% co mpared 
with the randomization visit LDL -C value in 2 consecutive LDL -C assessments.  The patient 
should be managed according to Section  5.7.3 .

8. SAFETY DEFINITIONS, REPORTING, AND MONIT ORING  
8.1. Definitions  
8.1.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a study d rug which may or 
may not have a causal relationship with the study drug. Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, which is 
temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whet her or not considered related to the study 
drug.  
An AE also includes any worsening (ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or 
intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug.  
8.1.2.  Serious Adver se Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated 
to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a  patient  is a passenger).  
 Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the  patient  is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event. This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
 Requires in -patient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing  hospitalization . 
In-patient hospitalization is defined as admission to a hospital or an emergency room 
for longer than 24 hours. Prolongation of existing hospitalization is defined as a 
hospital stay that is longer than was originally anticipated for the event, or is prolonged 
due to the development of a new AE as determined by the investigator or treating 
physician.  
                                        VV-RIM-00051258-1.0 Approved - 17 Jul 2018 GMT-5:00

Clinical Study Protocol  R727-CL-1532.05  
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 47 of 80 
CONFIDENTIAL   Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
 Is a c ongenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 Is an important medical event - Important medical events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the  patient  or 
may require intervention to prevent 1 of the other serious outcomes listed above 
(eg, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development o f 
drug dependency or drug abuse).  
8.2. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
All SAEs, regardless of assessment of causal relationship to study drug must be reported to the 
sponsor (or designee) as follows:  
 Telephone the sponsor (or designee) at the contact information provided in the SAE 
completion guidelines, within 24 hours of learning of the event  
 Complete the SAE form utilizing the AE e -CRF in the electronic data capture (EDC) 
system and submit within 24 hours of learning of the event  
The sponsor (or des ignee) will provide the investigators with blank SAE forms, which are to be 
completed in the event that access to the EDC system is not available. Once the EDC system is 
available, the SAE information must be entered within 24 hours of the system availabil ity. 
Information not available at the time of the initial report must be documented in the EDC within 
24 hours of receipt of the new information. Substantiating data such as relevant hospital or medical 
records and diagnostic test reports may also be reque sted. 
The investigator must promptly report to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee 
(EC) all unanticipated problems involving risks to patients. This includes death from any cause 
and all SAEs related to the use of the study drug. It is re commended that all SAEs be reported to 
the IRB/EC, regardless of assessed causality.  
In the event the investigator is informed of an SAE after the patient completes the study, the 
following will apply:  
 SAE with an onset within 30 days of the end of study/e arly termination visit - the SAE 
will be reported to the sponsor.  The investigator should make every effort to obtain 
follow -up information on the outcome until the event is considered chronic and/or 
stable.  
 SAE with an onset day greater than 30 days from  the end of study/early termination 
visit - only fatal SAEs and those deemed by the investigator to be drug -related SAEs 
will be reported to the sponsor.  The investigator should make every effort to obtain 
follow -up information on the outcome of a drug -related SAE until the event is 
considered chronic and/or stable.

CONFIDENTIAL  8.2.1.  Deaths  
Any AE that results in death is considered an SAE.  Deaths that occur from the time the patient 
signs the ICF until 70 days after dosing must be reported to the appropriate IRB/EC and to  
Regeneron Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management (or designee) within 24 hours of learning of 
the death.  The reporting procedures detailed in Section  8.2 should be followed.  
Any available autopsy reports and relevant medical reports must be sent to the sponsor (or 
designee) as soon as possible.  
8.2.2.  Pregnancy and Other Events that Require Accelerated Reporting  
The following events also require reporting t o the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of learning 
of the event:  
Overdose:  An overdose (accidental or intentional) is an event suspected by the investigator or 
spontaneously notified by the patient (not based on systematic injection counts), 
and defin ed as at least twice of the intended dose within the intended therapeutic 
interval; to be reported using the corresponding screens in the e -CRF using the term 
“symptomatic OVERDOSE (accidental [or intentional]).”  The patient should be 
monitored and approp riate symptomatic treatment instituted.  
and/or,  
Accidental or intentional administration of the study drug at a frequency higher 
than that allowed by the study protocol, if associated with an AE.  
Pregnancy:  Although it is not considered an AE, it is the re sponsibility of the investigator to 
report to the sponsor (or designee) by telephone within 24 hours, any pregnancy 
occurring in a female patient or partner of a male patient (if permitted by the female 
partner and by local regulatory policies), during the  study or within 70  days 
following the last dose of study drug. Study drug will be discontinued in female 
study participants who become pregnant, per Section  7.3.1.2 .  The sponsor will 
provide the investigator with a Pregnancy Tracking Form that is to be completed 
by the study site on a monthly basis and faxed to the sponsor (or designee).  The 
investigator will follow the pregnancy until delivery, or longer. If the pregnancy 
continues to term (delivery), the health of the infant must also be reported to the 
sponsor (or designee).  
Information on AEs of interest that requires accelerated reporting is provided in Section  7.6.4.5 . 
Whenever possible and practical, a blood sample to potentially measure plasma drug levels should 
be obtained upon the development of any SAE or unusual AE that is judged related to study 
treatment.  
8.2.3.  Reporting Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal from the Study  
All AEs that lead to a patient’s withdrawal from the study must be reported to the sponsor’s 
medical monitor within 30 days. All SAEs leading to a patient’s withdrawal from the study mus t 
be reported as outlined in Section  8.2.

CONFIDENTIAL  8.2.4.  Abnormal Laboratory, Vital Signs, or Electrocardiogram Results  
The criteria for determining whether an abn ormal objective test finding should be reported as an 
AE include:  
 the test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
 the test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or  
 the test result leads to a change in dosing (outside of protocol -stipulated dose 
adjustments), discontinuation from the study/study drug, significant additional 
concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy  
Contact the medical monitor in the event the investigator feels that an abnor mal test finding should 
be reported as an AE, although it does not meet any of the above criteria.  
Repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an 
AE.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an e rror does not require reporting as an 
AE. 
Evaluation of severity of laboratory abnormalities will be assessed according to the scale outlined 
in Section  8.3.1 . 
8.2.5.  Follow -up 
Adverse event information will be collected until the end of study visit, or the early termination 
visit if the patient withdraws consent.  
The investigator must make every effort to obtain follow -up information on the outcome of any 
SAE until the event is considered chronic and/or stable.  
8.3. Evaluation of Severity and Causality  
8.3.1.  Evaluation of Severity  
8.3.1.1.  Adverse Events (Excluding Local Injection Site Reactions)  
The severity of each AE (excluding local injection site reactions, see Section  8.3.1.2 ) will be 
graded by the investigator using a 3 -point scale (mild, moderate, or severe) and reported in detail 
as indicated on the e -CRF and/or S AE form, as appropriate.  
 Mild:  Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient ’s normal functioning 
level. It may be an annoyance.  Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief 
of symptoms, but may be given because of personality of the patient . 
 Moderate:  Produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to hea lth. It 
is uncomfortable or an embarrassment.  Treatment for symptom may be needed.  
 Severe:  Produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is 
a definite hazard to the patient ’s health.  Treatment for symptom may be given and/or 
patien t hospitalized.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 50 of 80 
CONFIDENTIAL  If a laboratory value is considered an AE, its severity should be based on the degree of 
physiological impairment the value indicates.  
8.3.1.2.  Local Injection Site Reactions  
The severity of local injection site reactions will be graded by the inves tigator using a 4 -point scale 
(mild, moderate, severe, or very severe) adapted from the toxicity grading scale table from the 
Food and Drug Administration Draft Guidance for Industry:  Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy 
Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enro lled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials dated April 2005.  
Local injection site reactions will be reported in detail as indicated on the e -CRF and/or SAE form, 
as appropriate.  
The complete severity grading scale for assessing local injection site reacti ons is provided in 
Appendix  7. 
8.3.2.  Evaluation of Causality  
The relationship of AEs to study drug is a clinical decision that will be made based on all av ailable 
information, by the investigator, who will answer the following question:  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the study drug?  
The possible answers are:  
Not Related:  There is no reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study 
drug 
Related:  There is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study 
drug (ie, a causal relationship cannot reasonably be ruled out)  
The investigator will provide a comment on the SAE reporting form to e xplain the basis of the 
causality assessment for SAEs.  
8.3.2.1.  Causality Evaluation Factors  
Factors to consider when determining the relationship of an AE to study drug are included below.  
Not Related:  
 Existence of a clear alternative explanation or nonplausibility (eg, the patient is struck 
by an automobile when there is no indication that the drug caused disorientation, or 
cancer diagnosed a few days after first drug administration)  
 Due to external causes such as other treatment(s) being administere d 
 Due to the patient’s disease state or clinical condition  
 Does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence following the time of administration 
of the dose of study drug  
 Does not reappear or worsen when dosing with study drug is resumed (ie, negative 
re-challenge)

 Known to be a response to the study drug based upon preclinical data or prior clinical 
data 
 Known to be st rongly associated with drug exposure (eg, angioedema, Stevens -Johnson 
Syndrome)  
8.4. Investigator Alert Notification  
Regeneron (or designee) will inform all investigators participating in this clinical trial, as well as 
in any other clinical trial using the sam e investigational drug, of any SAE that meets the relevant 
requirements for expedited reporting (an AE that is serious, is unexpected based on the 
Investigator’s Brochure, and has a reasonable suspected causal relationship to the study drug).  
9. STATISTICAL P LAN  
9.1. Statistical Hypothesis  
Let μ 0 and μ 1 be the population means of the change in SWM strategy z -score from baseline to 
week 96 under placebo and Praluent, respectively. For the primary and exploratory neurocognitive 
variables, the following null and alter native hypotheses will be assessed for noninferiority:  
H0 : μ1 - μ0 ≥ NI margin  
versus  
H1 : μ1 - μ0 < NI margin  
Age (dichotomized by <65 or ≥65) and by statin use (no statin, low lipophilicity of the concomitant 
statin, or high lipophilicity of the concom itant statin) will be the 2  stratification factors for patient 
randomization, and will be accounted for in the statistical modeling for neurocognitive function 
assessment.  
9.2. Determination of Sample Size  
To demonstrate the noninferiority of the Praluent 75 mg Q2W/up -titrate 150mg Q2W dose 
regimen relative to placebo for the primary endpoint of mean change in SWM strategy z -score 
from baseline to week 96, the sample size for this study is calculated to be 1 085 patients per 
treatment group. This sample size is based on the noninferiority margin of 0.2 for the primary 
outcome measure. Specifically, a worsening in the SWM strategy z -score of 0 to 0.2 at the group 
                                        VV-RIM-00051258-1.0 Approved - 17 Jul 2018 GMT-5:00

CONFIDENTIAL  level (small effect size) would not be considere d clinically meaningful. Whereas a worsening of 
0.3 to 0.5 (or greater), a small -to-medium effect size, might be considered clinically relevant, 
indicating increased cognitive impairment ( Roiser 2015 ). Therefore, a noninferiority margin of 0.2 
on the SWM strategy z -score change from baseline is a conservative estimate of the largest 
clinically meaningless mean difference between Praluent and placebo treatment groups. 
Additionally, the assumed mean dif ference between the treatment groups is 0 and the standard 
deviation is 1.0 (the standard deviation is obtained from the Cambridge Cognition internal 
normative data). To achieve 95% power using a 2 -sided 95% confidence interval (CI) approach 
(2-sided alpha =0.05), the sample size is calculated to require 651 patients per treatment group. 
Assuming dropout rate of 20% in the first year and 25% in the second year, the sample size is 
increased to 1085 patients per treatment group.  
The nQuery Advisor 7.0 was use d for the sample size calculations.  
9.3. Analysis Sets  
9.3.1.  Safety Analysis Sets  
9.3.1.1.  Safety Population  
The safety population will be defined as all patients randomized and exposed to at least 1 dose of 
study drug, regardless of the amount of treatment administered. Pati ents will be analyzed according 
to the treatment received (placebo or Praluent 75 mg Q2W/up -titrate 150 mg Q2W).  
9.3.1.2.  Primary Safety Population  
The primary safety population used to analyze the neurocognitive endpoints will be defined as 
patients from the safet y population who had an assessment of the SWM strategy score at baseline, 
and at least 1 score measured during the TEAE period. The TEAE period is defined as the first 
double -blind treatment dose to last dose of double -blind treatment + 70 days (10 weeks).  Patients 
will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received.  
In addition:  
 Randomized patients for whom it is unclear whether they took the study drug will be 
included in the safety population as randomized.  
 For patients receiving study drug fro m more than 1 treatment group during the trial, the 
treatment group allocation for as -treated analysis will be Praluent.  
9.3.2.  Efficacy Analysis Set  
9.3.2.1.  Intent -to-Treat  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population is defined as all randomized patients who had an evaluable 
secondary efficacy endpoint. The endpoint is evaluable when the following 2 conditions are met:  
 Availability of at least 1 measurement value for calculated LDL -C before first dose of 
study drug (ie, baseline)  
                                        VV-RIM-00051258-1.0 Approved - 17 Jul 2018 GMT-5:00

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 53 of 80 
CONFIDENTIAL   Availability of at least 1 measurement value for  calculated LDL -C within 1 of the 
analysis windows during the main efficacy period; the main efficacy period is defined 
as the time from the first double -blind study treatment injection up to the upper limit 
of the week 96 analysis window  
Patients in the I TT population will be analyzed according to the treatment group allocated by 
randomization (ie, as -randomized treatment group).  
9.3.2.2.  Modified Intent -to-Treat  
The modified intent -to-treat (mITT) population (also known as the full analysis set) is defined as 
the all randomized population who took at least 1 dose or part of a dose of study drug and have an 
evaluable secondary efficacy endpoint.  The endpoint is considered as evaluable when both of the 
following conditions are met:  
 Availability of at least 1 measure ment value for calculated LDL -C before first dose of 
study drug (ie, baseline)  
 Availability of at least 1 calculated LDL -C value during the efficacy treatment period 
and within 1 of the analysis windows up to week 96; the efficacy treatment period is 
defin ed as the time from the first double -blind study drug injection up to 21 days after 
the last double -blind study drug injection  
Patients in the mITT population will be analyzed according to the treatment group allocated by 
randomization.  
9.3.3.  Other Analysis Set  
The anti -drug antibody analysis will be performed on all treated patients (safety population) with 
a blood sample at week 0 (baseline) and at least 1 evaluable blood sample for anti -alirocumab 
antibodies after the first dose of study drug.  
9.4. Patient Disposit ion 
Screened patients are defined as any patient who originally met the inclusion criteria and signed 
the informed consent.  
Randomized patients consist of all screened patients, with a double -blind treatment kit number 
allocated and recorded in the IVRS/IWRS database, regardless of whether the treatment kit was 
used or not.  Patients treated without being randomized or treated with a double -blind treatment 
kit before the randomization will not be considered as randomized and will not be included in a ny 
analysis population.  The safety experience of patients treated and not randomized will be reported 
separately.  
For any patient randomized more than once, safety data from the first randomization will be 
included in the safety population, with safety da ta associated with the later randomization reported 
separately.  Since this is expected to be a rare event, inclusion of efficacy data from patient 
randomized more than once in the efficacy population will be decided on a case -by-case basis prior 
to the un blinding of treatment assignments and will be documented in the clinical study report.

CONFIDENTIAL  9.5. Statistical Methods  
9.5.1.  Demography and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively for the 2 treatment 
groups in the s afety population. Continuous variables will be summarized with mean, Q1, median, 
Q3, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized with 
frequency and percentage.  
9.5.2.  Safety and Efficacy Analyses  
9.5.2.1.  Primary Neurocognitive Analy sis 
The primary neurocognitive analysis is a statistical evaluation of the noninferiority of the Praluent 
75 mg Q2W/up -titrate 150 mg Q2W dose regimen to placebo for the primary endpoint of change 
in SWM strategy z -score from baseline to week 96 in the pri mary safety population.  The 2 -sided 
95% CI for the mean treatment difference at week 96 will be determined using an appropriate 
contrast statement in a mixed -effect model with repeated measures (MMRM).  The upper CI limit 
will be compared to the noninferi ority margin which is defined as 0.2 and the noninferiority will 
be declared if the upper CI limit is below the noninferiority margin.  
In the case noninferiority is achieved for the primary neurocognitive function endpoint 
comparison, superiority of the primary neurocognitive function endpoint will be assessed using 
the same upper CI limit calculated for the primary comparison.  Specifically, the upper CI limit 
will be compared to zero and superiority will be declared if the upper CI limit is below zero.  A 
statistical multiplicity adjustment is not needed, since this process of noninferiority achievement 
followed by superiority assessment using the same 95% upper CI limit on the primary endpoint 
corresponds to a simple closed test procedure ( EMA/CPMP/EWP/482/99 – 27July 2000 ). 
The MMRM model will include the fixed categorical effects of treatment group (placebo, 
Praluent), both randomization strata (as per IVRS/IWRS), time point (weeks 24, 48, 72, and 96), 
treatment -by-time point in teraction, and strata -by-time point interaction, as well as the continuous 
covariate of baseline SWM strategy raw score value and baseline value -by-time point interaction.  
Post-baseline assessments within a patient’s TEAE period will be included in the an alysis and 
missing data are accounted for by the MMRM model.  Model assumptions for normality will be 
explored prior to the analysis testing.  
This model will be run using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) mixed procedure with an 
unstructured correlation matrix to model the within -patient errors.  Parameters will be estimated 
using restricted maximum likelihood method with the Newton -Raphson algorithm.  Denominator 
degrees of freedom will be estimated using Satterthwaite’s approximation.  This model will 
provide baseline adjusted least -squares means estimates at week 96 for both treatment groups with 
their corresponding standard errors.  
To support the clinical interpretation of the primary neurocognitive analysis, the SWM strategy 
raw score change from base line to week 96 in the primary safety population will also be 
descriptively provided using the MMRM analysis method described above (at least includes least 
squares mean and 95% CI).

CONFIDENTIAL  Robustness of this statistical method will be assessed via sensitivity a nalyses detailed in the SAP, 
including different methodologies for missing data (multiple imputation and potentially pattern 
mixture modeling).  
9.5.2.2.  Exploratory Neurocognitive Analyses  
To further understand the effects of Praluent on cognitive function and supp ort the primary 
neurocognitive analysis, the 3 domain endpoints (specifically PAL, RTI, and SWM between -error 
scores) and the Global Composite score will also be evaluated for noninferiority at week 96 in the 
primary safety population.  These 4 measures wi ll not be evaluated for superiority.  The analysis 
method (MMRM) and noninferiority evaluation approach (evaluation of the 95% CI for the mean 
treatment difference at week 96) described for the primary neurocognitive analysis will also be 
used for the 3 do main’s z -scores change from baseline and the Global Composite score change 
from baseline.  To support the clinical interpretation of the 3  domains, the raw score change from 
baseline to week 96 in the primary safety population will also be descriptively pr ovided using the 
MMRM analysis method.  
The 4 domain endpoint scores (including the primary neurocognitive endpoint) and the Global 
Composite scores will be descriptively summarized by time point, and the details will be provided 
in the SAP.  
9.5.2.3.  Secondary Effic acy Analyses  
For secondary efficacy endpoints of lipids (defined in Section  6.2.3 ), descriptive summaries and 
analyses will be performed in the ITT p opulation (for ITT analysis) and the mITT population (for 
on-treatment analysis). P -values for the testing of study treatment effect will be provided for 
descriptive purposes only (nominal p -values).  
For descriptive summaries, percent change from baseline in calculated LDL -C, Total -C, HDL -C, 
TG, non -HDL -C, Apo B, Apo A -1, and Lp(a) will be provided at each time point for each treatment 
group. All measurements, scheduled or unscheduled, will be assigned to analysis windows defined 
in the SAP in order to prov ide an assessment for these time points.  Laboratory assessments other 
than the ones provided by the central laboratory will be excluded.  The time profile of each 
parameter will be plotted by treatment group with the corresponding standard errors. For TG and 
Lp(a), summary statistics will include Q1 and Q3.  
Multiple types of measurements are planned to be analyzed during the trial, specifically continuous 
measurements expected to have a normal distribution (eg, percent change in calculated LDL -C), 
continuo us measurements expected to have a non -normal distribution (eg, TG), and binary 
measurements (eg, proportion of patients reaching LDL -C <70  mg/dL).  
I. Continuous Endpoints Anticipated to have a Normal Distribution  
Continuous secondary efficacy variables, d efined in Section  6.2.3, anticipated to have a normal 
distribution (ie, lipids other than TG and Lp(a)) will be analyzed in the analysis populations using 
the same MMRM method as described for the primary neurocognitive endpoint.  Specifically, the 
model will contain fixed categorical effects of treatment group, both randomization strata, planned 
time points up to week 96 (specific time points are week s 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96), strata -by-time 
point interaction and treatment -by-time point interaction, as well as, the continuous fixed 
covariates of corresponding baseline value and baseline value -by-time point interaction.

CONFIDENTIAL  II. Continuous Endpoints Anti cipated to have a Non -Normal Distribution  
Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints, defined in Section  6.2.3 , anticipated to have a 
non-normal distrib ution (ie, TG and Lp(a)) will be analyzed in the analysis populations using a 
robust regression model (ie, ROBUSTREG SAS procedure with M -estimation option) with 
treatment group and randomization strata as main effect and corresponding baseline value(s) as  
the covariate.  Missing values will be addressed using a multiple imputation approach, which will 
be described in the SAP.  The variables in the multiple imputation model will at least include the 
same variables as used in the robust regression model.  Th e treatment group combined means will 
be provided with respective standard error estimates.  The combined mean difference between the 
treatment groups will be provided with the standard error, 95% CI, and p -value.  
III. Binary Endpoints  
Binary secondary eff icacy endpoints, defined in Section  6.2.3 , will be analyzed in the analysis 
populations using stratified logistic regression (using the strata option of the SAS logistic 
procedure) with treatment group and randomization strata as mai n effect and corresponding 
baseline value(s) as the covariate.  Missing values will be addressed using a multiple imputation 
approach which will be described in the SAP.  The variables in the multiple imputation model will 
at least include the same variabl es used in the logistic regression model.  Treatment effects will be 
compared and the combined odds ratio estimate between the treatment groups, with their 
corresponding 95% CIs and p -value, will be provided.  
In the data dependent case that the logistic re gression method is not applicable (eg, the response 
rate is zero in 1 treatment group and thus the maximum likelihood estimate may not exist), the last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) approach would be used for handling of missing values and 
an exact co nditional logistic regression would be performed to compare treatment effects.  The 
LOCF imputation method will consist of using the last value obtained up to the applicable time 
point window (weeks 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 as applicable) to impute the missi ng week value.  
9.5.2.4.  Multiplicity Considerations  
Adjustments to the alpha level for the purposes of multiple testing are not applicable for this safety 
study. The exploratory neurocognitive and secondary efficacy lipid endpoints are supportive of the 
primary analysis and not hypothesis -testing.  Any statistical testing is for descriptive purposes only 
(ie, any p -values provided are nominal).  
9.5.2.5.  General Safety Analyses  
The general safety analysis will be based on the safety analysis population (SAF).  The summary 
of safety results will be presented by the 2 treatment groups (placebo and Praluent 75  mg Q2W/up -
titrate 150 mg Q2W). No formal inferential testing will be performed.  Summaries will be 
descriptive in nature.

post-treatment period.  
Analysis  
Adverse event incidence tables will be presented by (at least) SOCs sorted by internationally 
agreed order, and PTs sorted by decreasing frequency in the Praluent group.  The number (n) and  
percentage (%) of patients experiencing an AE will be shown.  The high level group term and high 
level term can be added in alphabetical order, as applicable.  Multiple occurrences of the same 
event in the same patient will be counted only once in the tab les within a treatment phase.  Data 
conventions for missing or partial AE dates will be addressed in the SAP.  The denominator for 
computation of percentages is the safety population within each treatment group.  
Adverse event incidence tables will be provi ded by treatment group for all types of TEAEs:  all 
TEAEs, all TEAEs of interest (defined with a PT or a prespecified grouping), TEAE by severity, 
all treatment -emergent SAEs, and all TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation.  
If any clinically significant signal is detected and further characterization is needed or for AEs of 
clinical interest, selected TEAEs will be analyzed using a time -to-event approach (Kaplan -Meier 
methodology) to account for the differential exposure time in all patients.  Time from the first dose 
of study drug to the first occurrence of the event will be calculated (only the first event will be 
counted).  Patients without any event will be censored at the end of the TEAE period.  
Kaplan -Meier curves will be provided.

CONFIDENTIAL  Death  
The following death summaries will be generated:  
 Number (%) of patients who died by study period (TEAE and post -study) summarized 
on the safety population by treatment received  
 Death in nonrandomized patients or randomized and not treated patients  
 TEAE le ading to death (death as an outcome on the AE e -CRF page as reported by the 
investigator) by (at least) SOCs sorted by internationally agreed order, and PTs sorted 
by decreasing frequency in the Praluent group, showing the number (n) and percentage 
(%) of patients  
Drug -Induced Liver Injury  
Liver function tests, namely ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin, are used to assess 
possible drug -induced liver toxicity.  The proportion of patients with potentially clinically 
significant abnormal values (PCSAs) at any post -baseline visit by baseline status will be displayed 
by treatment group for each parameter.  A graph of distribution of peak values of ALT versus peak 
values of total bilirubin will also be presented (note that the ALT and total b ilirubin values are 
presented on a logarithmic scale).  The graph will be divided into 4  quadrants with a vertical line 
corresponding to 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for ALT and a horizontal line corresponding to 
2 x ULN for total bilirubin.  
The inciden ce of liver -related AEs will be summarized by treatment group.  The selection of PTs 
will be based on a standardized MedDRA query hepatic disorder. Time to liver -related treatment 
discontinuation and time to liver death may also be provided based on the he patic disorder 
standardized MedDRA query.  
Neurocognitive Events of Special Interest:  
Neurocognitive events are defined in this study as AESI, specifically, neurocognitive AEs (serious 
or nonserious) required to be monitored, documented, and managed in a pr especified manner as 
described in this protocol.  The number and percentage of patients experiencing a neurocognitive 
event will be summarized for each treatment group by SOC and PT.  Time -to-event analyses could 
also be performed (if relevant, based on the number of events).  In addition, the neurocognitive 
event rate in patients with 2 consecutive results separated by at least 21 days, and with only 1 such 
event for calculated LDL -C <25 mg/dL, and calculated LDL -C <15 mg/dL, will be assessed.

CONFIDENTIAL  Notes:  
1. Certain medicines eg Risperidone (mild ACB), Quetiapine (severe ACB) and Olanzapine 
(severe ACB) were licensed after 1990 and therefore not prescribed to the original CFAS 
cohort.  
2. Brand names may conceal generic drug names.  
3. Some combination medicines contain anticholinergic drugs.  
4. This list is indicative and some related medici nes were taken by patients in the CFAS study; 
if appropriate these related medicines were given an ACB score based on the ACB of the 
related medicine in the Aging Health publication (see Reference 1 below).  
5. Medications listed in Appendix  4 used “as needed”/pro re nata (PRN), ≤2 times per week 
should not be included in calculating the ACB score  
6. All products that include metoprolol (eg, metoprolol succinate [Toprol XL] or metopro lol 
tartrate [Lopressor]) should be scored “1.”  
7. All opiate products (eg, oxycodone, hydrocodone, tramadol, etc) should be scored as “1.”

CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX  5. DEFINITION OF CARDIO VASCULAR DISEASE RISK 
CATEGORIES  
 Very high CV risk  is defined as a history of documented CHD, ischemic stroke, 
transient ischemic attack, carotid artery occlusion >50% without symptoms, carotid 
endarterectomy or carotid artery stent procedure, peripheral arterial d isease, abdominal 
aortic aneurysm, renal artery stenosis, renal artery stent procedure, type 1 or type 2 
diabetes mellitus with target organ damage.  
A history of documented CHD includes 1 or more of the following:  
 Acute myocardial infarction  
 Silent myocard ial infarction  
 Unstable angina  
 Coronary revascularization procedure (eg, percutaneous coronary intervention or 
coronary artery bypass graft surgery).  
 Clinically significant CHD diagnosed by invasive or non -invasive testing (such as 
coronary angiography, st ress test using treadmill, stress echocardiography or 
nuclear imaging)  
 High CV risk  is defined as a calculated 10 -year fatal CVD risk SCORE ≥5% 
(ESC/EAS  2012 ), moderate chronic kidney disease, type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus 
without target organ damage,  or heFH.  
 Moderate CV risk  is defined as a calculated 10 -year fatal CVD risk SCORE ≥1 and 
<5%  (ESC/EAS 2012 ).

CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX  6. SUMMARY OF TLC DIET FOR HIGH CHOLESTEROL  
 
Total Fat  25% - 35% total calories*  
Saturated fat*  < 7% total calories  
Polyunsaturated fat  up to 10% total calories  
Monounsaturated fat  up to 20% total calories  
Carbohydrates† 50% - 60% total calories*  
Protein  ~15% total calories  
Cholesterol  < 200 mg/day (5.172 mmol/day)  
Plant Sterols  2g 
Soluble Fiber such as psyllium  10g - 25g 
* ATP III allows an increase of total fat to 35 percent of total calories and a reduction in carbohydrate to 50 percent 
for persons with the metabolic syndrome. Any increase in fat intake should be in the form of either polyunsaturated 
or monounsaturated fat. Trans -fatty acid s are another LDL -raising fat that should be kept at a low intake.  
† Carbohydrate should derive predominantly from foods rich in complex carbohydrates including grains —especially 
whole grains —fruits, and vegetables.

CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX  10. LDL -C RESCUE MEDICAT ION PRINCIPLES  
If no reason for LDL -C above the threshold value can be found, or if appropriate action fails to 
decrease LDL -C below the threshold value, rescue medication may be introduced.  The 
effectiveness of any such changes will be made based on lack of rescue threshold from blinded 
lipid testing at the next routinely scheduled lab draw.  
Patients per protocol already receive a maximum tolerated  dose of statin, so statin uptitration or 
switch will not be an option.  
For further LDL -C lowering, the investigator may consider adding:  
 A cholesterol absorption inhibitor (ezetimibe), or  
 A bile acid -binding sequestrant (the resins cholestyramine and col estipol, or 
colesevelam, a nonabsorbable polymer)  
The following lipid modifying agents may also be considered:  
 Fenofibrate  
Note:  Caution should be exercised when combining fibrates with other cholesterol 
lowering medications such as statins because of the  risk of myopathy.  When a fibrate 
is combined with a statin, fenofibrate is the fibrate of choice because it does not affect 
statin glucuronidation.  
 Nicotinic acid (niacin)  
Note:  Niacin raises blood glucose but has been shown to be effective in modifying  
lipid disorders in people with diabetes if glucose control is maintained.

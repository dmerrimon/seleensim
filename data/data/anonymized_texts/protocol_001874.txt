1.0 Background and Scientific Rationale  
1.1 Background Information  
Approximately 50 million people in the United States suffer from some form 
of arthritis pain, and Osteoarthritis is the most common form of the disease. 
The prevalence of osteoarthritis is greater among women than men, 
increases with age, and affects all r ace/ethnicity groups.  
 
Osteoarthritis affects articular cartilage, the smooth fibrous connective 
tissue essential for smooth movement and cushioning of the joint. As the 
disease progresses, the cartilage becomes thinner and may completely 
wear away. Infla mmation of the synovial membrane, the lining that 
surrounds the knee joint and contains the synovial fluid, is often a result of 
these changes. Osteoarthritis can form in any joint but is more common in 
weight bearing joints such as the knee and hip, and r esults in joint space 
narrowing, seve re pain and loss of mobility.  
 
Ultrasound therapy for the treatment of Osteoarthritis may be used as 
conservative care  (see reference: cochrane review).  
 
 
1.2 Investigational Product Description  
Low intensity therapeutic u ltrasound (LITUS) will be delivered in this study 
using ZetrOZ’s Ultrasonic Diathermy Device called sam®. The device 
package consists of a Power Controller, 2 Applicators (ultrasound 
generators), Ultrasound Coupling Bandages  1% Diclofenac , Ultrasound 
Gel, Y-Adapter, Charger and User Manual.  
 
1.3 Hypotheses  
It is hypothesized that users of the LITUS device (sam®) device  will be able 
to successfully apply and remove the device daily to the knee . It is 
hypothesized that treatment with the LITUS device (sam®) will yield 
improvements in pain  and stiffness in subjects  with knee Osteoarthritis .   
 
1.4 Potential Risks to Subjects  
The risks of using ultrasound devices to administer physical therapy are 
well established and include: burn, itching and/or pain. These risks 
decrease when using lower intensity ultrasound , as in this study . The 
Ultrasound Diathermy Device uses existing technology to deliver ultrasound 
therapy in a portable and convenient fashion. The subjects will be given the 
chance to ask any questions regarding the trial procedures, requirements, 
and purposes. Once the s ubjects are fully informed of the possible risks 
and benefits of participation in the study and all of their questions have 
been satisfactorily answered, they will be required to sign the informed 
consent form in order to participate in the study. All subj ects must give 
consent themselves and no legally authorized representatives will be 
accepted on their behalf.  
 
 
Version 1 - July 2019  
 4 2.0 Study Objectives and Design  
2.1 Objectives  
Evaluate the usability of the device  for proper design.    
 
Evaluate the ability of LITUS  to reduce  pain, stiffness as measured by  NRS 
scale and  the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index 
(WOMAC)  
 
2.2 Study Design  
2.2.1  General Study Design  
This study is designed as a single cohort case series . After 
screening and enrollment, subjects will self-administer LITUS daily 
for 7 consecutive days.  
 
2.2.2  Study D esign Schematic  
 
 
3.0 Study Population  
3.1 General C haracteristics of the Proposed Subject Population(s)  
This study will enroll subjects with physician confi rmed knee Osteoarthritis 
pain. The l ong duration wearable therapeutic ultrasound treatment has 
multiple benefits likely to aid the patients enrolled in this study with  knee 
Osteoarthritis pain . Acoustic waves mechanically stimulate tissue, triggering 
biological effects including the down regulation of inflammatory cytokines, 
increased transport kinetics, protein synthesis, and extracellular matrix 
deposition.  It is therefore hypothesized that the wearable device  has the 
potential to provide sustained OA symptom management.  
 
3.2 Anticipated Number of Research Subjects  
 
Enrollment will be monitor ed at  the assumed rates of Screen Failures and 
Discontinuation may be found to differ in this study from historical controls. 
The objective is to screen and enroll towards a target of 30 completed 
subjects.

Serious adverse effect . Any adverse effect that results in any of the 
following outcomes: death, a life -threatening adverse effect, inpatient 
hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persisten t or 
significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
 
Unexpected adverse effect.   Any adverse effect, the frequency, specificity 
or severity of which is not consistent with the risk information described in 
the clinical study prot ocol(s)  
 
Unanticipated adverse device effect.   Any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, seve rity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or IDE application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a 
device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
6.1.2  Eliciting A dverse Effect Information  
Clinical study subjects will be routinely questioned about adverse 
effects at study visits.  
 
6.1.3  Recording and Assessment of Adverse Effects  
All observed or volunteered adverse effects (serious or non -
serious) and abnormal test findings, regardless of treatment 
group, if applicable, or suspected causal relationship to the 
investigational device or, if applicable, other study treatment or 
diagno stic product(s) will be recorded in the subjects’ case 
histories.  For all adverse effects, sufficient information will be 
pursued and/or obtained so as to permit 1) an adequate 
determination of the outcome of the effect (i.e., whether the effect 
should be  classified as a serious adverse effect) and; 2) an 
assessment of the casual relationship between the adverse effect 
and the investigational device or, if applicable, the other study 
treatment or diagnostic product(s).    
 
Adverse effects or abnormal test findings felt to be associated with 
the investigational device or, if applicable, other study treatment or 
diagnostic product(s) will be followed until the effect (or its 
sequelae) or the abnormal test finding resolves or stabilizes at a 
level acceptable t o the investigator -sponsor.  
 
6.1.3.1  Causality and Severity Assessmen t 
The investigator -sponsor will promptly review documented 
adverse effects and abnormal test findings to determine 1) 
if the abnormal test finding should be classified as an 
adverse effect; 2) if  there is a reasonable possibility that 
the adverse effect was caused by the investigational 
device or, if applicable, other study treatment or diagnostic 
Version 1 - July 2019  
 11 product(s); and 3) if the adverse effect meets the criteria 
for a serious adverse effect.  
 
If the inv estigator -sponsor’s final determination of causality 
is “unknown and of questionable relationship to the 
investigational device or, if applicable, other study 
treatment or diagnostic product(s)”, the adverse effect will 
be classified as associated with the  use of the 
investigational device or study treatment or diagnostic drug 
product(s) for reporting purposes.  If the investigator -
sponsor’s final determination of causality is “unknown but 
not related to the investigational device or, if applicable, 
other s tudy treatment or diagnostic product(s)”, this 
determination and the rationale for the determination will 
be documented in the respective subject’s case history.  
6.1.4  Reporting  of Adverse E ffects to the FDA   
The investigator -sponsor will submit a completed Form  FDA 3500 
A to the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health for any 
observed or volunteered adverse effect that is determined to be 
an unanticipated adverse device effect.  A copy of this completed 
form will be provided to all participating sub -investigators.   
 
The completed Form FDA 3500 A will be submitted to the FDA as 
soon as possible and, in no event, later than 10 working days after 
the investigator -sponsor first receives notice of the adverse effect.  
 
If the results of the sponsor -investigator’s follow -up evaluation 
show that an adverse effect that was initially determined to not 
constitute an unanticipated adverse device effect  does, in  fact, 
meet the requirements for reporting; the investigator -sponsor will 
submit a completed Form  FDA 3500 A as soon as possible, but in 
no event later than 10 working days, after t he determination was 
made.  
 
For each submitted Form  FDA 3500 A, the sponsor -investigator 
will identify all previously submitted reports that that addressed a 
similar adverse effect experience and will provide an analysis of 
the significance of newly reported adverse effect in light of the 
previous, similar report(s).  
 
Subsequent to the initial submission of a completed Form  FDA 
3500 A, the investigator -sponsor will submit additional information 
concerning the reported adverse effect as requested by the FDA.  
 
6.1.5  Reporting of Adverse Effects to the Responsible IRB  
In accordance with applicable policies of the Institutional Review 
Board (IRB), the investigator -sponsor will report, to the IRB, any 
observed or volunteered adverse effect that is determined to meet 
all of the following criteria: 1) associated with the in vestigational 
device or, if applicable, other study treatment or diagnostic 
Version 1 - July 2019  
 12 product(s); 2) a serious adverse effect; and 3) an unexpected 
adverse effect.  Adverse event reports will be submitted to the IRB 
in accordance with the respective IRB procedures.  
 
Applicable adverse effects will be reported to the IRB as soon as 
possible and, in no event, later than 10 calendar days following 
the investigator -sponsor’s receipt of the respective information.  
Adverse effects which are 1) associated with the investi gational 
drug or, if applicable, other study treatment or diagnostic 
product(s); 2) fatal or life -threatening; and 3) unexpected will be 
reported to the IRB within 24 hours of the investigator -sponsor’s 
receipt of the respective information.  
 
Follow -up in formation to reported adverse effects will be submitted 
to the IRB as soon as the relevant information is available.  If the 
results of the sponsor -investigator’s follow -up investigation show 
that an adverse effect that was initially determined to not requ ire 
reporting to the IRB does, in fact, meet the requirements for 
reporting; the investigator -sponsor will report the adverse effect to 
the IRB as soon as possible, but in no event later than 10 
calendar days, after the determination was made.  
 
7.0 Monitoring Procedures  
Monitoring of the clinical study for clinical protocol compliance will be conducted 
periodically (i.e., at a minimum of annually) by  the clinical team . The sponsor -
investigator will permit direct access to the study monitors and appropriate regulatory 
authorities to the study data and to the corresponding source data and documents to 
verify the accuracy of these data.  
 
8.0 Additional Records and Reports   
8.1 Data Handling and Record -keeping  
A Case Report Form (will be completed  at each s tudy visit  for each subject 
enrolled into the clinical study.  The investigator -sponsor will review, 
approve and sign/date each completed CRF; the investigator -sponsor’s 
signature serving as attestation of the investigator -sponsor’s responsibility 
for ensu ring that all clinical and laboratory data entered on the CRF are 
complete, accurate and authentic.   
 
The clinical research team will work with each site to ensure accurate 
completion of CRFs reconciling illegible entries, missing data, and 
conflicting da ta entries.  
 
Source Data  are the clinical findings and observations, laboratory and test 
data, and other information contained in Source Documents .  Source 
Documents are the original records (and certified copies of original 
records); including, but not limited to, hospital medical records, physician or 
office charts, physician or nursing notes, subject diaries or evaluation 
Version 1 - July 2019

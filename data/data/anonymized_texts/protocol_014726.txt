• Investigator request.  
• Sponsor request.  
• Treatment failure deemed by the investigator as lack of improvement or worsening of the 
disease symptoms or occurrence of intolerable AEs.  
Treatment with GLPG0634 will be discontinued and the patient withdrawn from this study for:  
• … 
• Two sequential  Ddecreases from the baseline of inhibin B by 50% or Testosterone by 50% 
with concurrent increases in FSH or LH respectively .3 
After becoming aware of any of the above described abnormal laboratory changes occurring at any 
one time, an unscheduled visit ( i.e. second sequential) must occur  to retest within 3 to 5  days. The 
retesting for laboratory parameters should occur within 3 to 5 days .  
1 In each case, there is a need for additional investigations, such as review of ethanol, recreational drug and dietary supplem ent 
consumption; testing for acute hepatitis A, B or C infection and biliary tract imaging should be promptly discussed with the 
Study Medical Monitor.  
2 At the time of study completion or discontinuation, if a patient should exhibit elevations in serum creatinine ≥33% above the 
average of screening and baseline values, they should be re- tested every 1 to 2 weeks until the serum creatinine elevation is 
fully reversed to within 10% of the average of screening and baseline values.  
3 In each case, hormones in male subjects should be monitored monthly and if no positive dynamics is seen after 3 months 
from stopping GLPG0634, referral to an andrologist should be considered.  
Section 8 .5.8 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Concomitant therapies taken for the long term treatment of preexisting conditions can continue during 
the study provided they are in a ccordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. It is preferred that 
these medications be stabilized prior to study entry  and continued without variation of dose or 
regimen during the study.  
In case new therapies need to be administered during the study, the risk/benefit to the subject should 
be carefully assessed and consideration given to the timing of any necessary introduction of new medications.  
Permitted concomitant medications at Screening and during the study include:  
• Antimalarials, which must  be at a stable dose for at least 12 weeks prior to 
ScreeningBaseline. 
• NSAIDs, provided that the dose is stable for at least 2 weeks prior to ScreeningBaseline and, 
if possible, is kept constant during the study;  
• Oral steroids, provided that the dose is s table, is ≤10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent for at 
least 4 weeks prior to ScreeningBaseline, and is kept stable for the study duration; and  
• Analgesics, other than NSAIDs, up to the maximum recommended doses may be used for pain as required. However, subjects must not take analgesics within 24 hours before a visit 
where clinical efficacy assessments are performed and recorded.  
Female subjects of childbearing potential will use highly effective birth-control methods as outlined in 
the inclusion criteria and agree to continue their use during the study and for at least 12  weeks after 
the last dose of study medication. The use of hormonal contraceptives will be recorded in the 
Concomitant Therapy section of the eCRF. Applicable procedures and treatment guidance based on 
package inserts will be respected.  
… 
Previous use of JAK  or SYK  inhibitors is prohibited.

For each dose taken, the date, the time of intake, and the number of capsules taken should be 
recorded on the subject diary card.  
The investigator or designated study personnel will maintain a log of all drug dispensed and returned. Drug supplies for each subject will be inventoried and accounted for throughout the study.  
Subjects with a poor compliance (<80% or >120%) will be retained by the study site. If study drug 
compliance remains <80% or >120% between study visits, or if the subject missed more than 2 visits, 
the subject will be evaluated for potential discontinuation. Any discontinuation should be done in 
consultation with the Medical Monitor.  
Section 8 .6.1.1 Screening Period (Visit 1, Day - 29 to Day -2) 
• Each subject will receive a patient number by using the IXRS system.  
 
Note 1: Retesting  during the Screening period is only allowed once for  abnormal lab values except 
for positive QuantiFERON -TB Gold, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV or pregnancy test in a female of 
childbearing potential AND only in case it is still possible to randomize the patient within the per 
protocol defined Screening per iod of 28 calendar days . 
Note 2: Rescreening  is only allowed in specific situations and after having obtained written sponsor 
approval.  
Section 8 .6.2.8 Week 24 (Visit 10) or Early Discontinuation Visit (EDV)  
The Week 24 visit (Visit 10) will take place on Day 169 ± 2 calendar  days relative to the start of study 
medication intake. Subjects who have discontinued from the study early and subjects who attend the Week 24 visit will complete the following assessments. This visit needs to be entered in IXRS.  
Secti on 8.7.1.5 Flow chart  
IXRS call was added to the D169/W24 and EDV visits in the flow chart.  
Section 8 .9.2 Monitoring.  
Data for each subject will be recorded on an eCRF. Data collection must be completed for each subject who signs an ICF  and is administered study medication.

Study Population  
(continued) : • current or previous RA treatment with a biologic  
DMARD , with the exception of biologic  DMARD s: 
administered in a single clinical study setting , and; 
more than 6 mont hs prior to S creening (12 months 
for rituximab or other B cell depleting agents), and; 
where the biologic  DMARD  was effective, and if 
discontinued, this should not be due to lack of 
efficacy ,  
• previous treatment at any time with a cytotoxic  
agent, other than MTX, before S creening.  
Primary Endpoint : Percentage of subjects achieving an ACR20 response at 
Week 12  
Secondary Endpoints : Percentage of subjects achie ving ACR20 response at 
Week 24, percentage of subjects achieving ACR50 , 
ACR70, ACR- N, the DAS28 (CRP ), EULAR response and 
ACR/EULAR remission , CDAI, SDAI, the change from 
Baseline in Quality of Life ( functional assessment of 
chronic illness therapy [ FACIT ] and Short Form-36 
[SF-36]) scores at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8 12, and 24 , as 
appropriate . 
Efficacy  analysis : The efficacy analysis will be performed on all subjects who 
used the study medication at least once and h ave 
post-Baseline efficacy data. Efficacy data  (ACR20, 
ACR50, ACR70, ACR -N, EULAR response and 
ACR/EULAR remission , DAS28 [CRP ], components of the 
ACR, and DAS28, CDAI, and SDAI at each post -dosing 
visit) will be analyzed descriptively. Between- group 
comparisons will also be done for each dose group versu s 
the p lacebo group. The effects of different doses of 
GLPG0634 administration on subject’s disability, fatigue, 
and quality of life will also be evaluated. Hommel’s 
closed -testing correction procedure will be applied to 
adjust for multiplicity. This study  is not powered for any 
formal comparison among the GLPG0634 dose groups . 
Differences will be explor ed descriptively. No adjustment 
for multiplicity will be done fo r these exploratory  
differences.  
Safety analysis:  Assessment of adverse events , laboratory parameters, 
vital signs, physical examination, and electrocardiograms . 
The safety analysis will be performed for all subjects who 
used the study medication at least once.  
Pharmacokinetics:  Blood samples will be collected for analysis of GLPG0634 
and G2544 45 plasma concentrations . N onlinear 
mixed -effects modelling will be used to determine the 
population PK parameters as well as the impact of 
covariates influencing the PK in subjects with RA. The 
correlation between exposures and selected efficacy and 
safet y endpoints will also be investigated.

6 Introduction  
6.1 Rheumatoid Arthritis  
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory and joint degenerative 
disease that affects almost 1% of the adult population worldwide, with onset classically 
between the ages of 30 and 50 and a higher prevalence in women. The disease is 
characterized by pain, stiffness , and restricted mobility due to a persistent symmetrical 
inflammation  of the synovial membrane of multiple joints that ultimately results in irreversible 
damage of the joint cartilage and bone.1,2,3 
Development of the disease involves an inflammatory response of the synovial membrane 
that is accompanied by infiltration of a variety of immune cells, which leads to the build- up 
and maintenance of a cytokine network. One of the cytokines central  to this network is tumor 
necrosis factor α (TNF- α), as is clearly demonstrated by the clinical success of the TNF -α 
blockers in treating RA. TNF- α and other proinflammatory cytokines contribute to cartilage 
and bone erosion by inducing release of degradative enzymes such as the matrix metalloproteinases and stimulating the release of r eceptor activator for nuclear factor κ B 
ligand which triggers differentiation of hematopoietic cells into bone -resorbing osteoclasts. 
When left untreated, the disease leads to significant disability associated with high economic 
costs. 
In recent years, the therapeutic management of subjects with RA has seen a major 
revolution. Ten years ago, therapeutic approaches relied on disease -modifying anti rheumatic 
drugs (DMARDs) such  as methotrexate (MTX) and sulfasalazine that had only partial clinical 
benefit and were associated with significant toxicity. A considerable advance in the treatment 
of RA came from the introduction of the biological therapeutics like etanercept, infliximab, 
adalimumab, and, more recently, certolizumab pegol , which  neutralize TNF- α. Spurred by 
their therapeutic success, more biologicals aimed at targeting other molecules involved in 
RA pathology are being developed. An anti -CD20 antibody (rituximab) directed at depleting 
B cells, a fusion protein targeting T -cell costimulation (abatacept), and tocilizumab, targeting 
the interleukin 6 receptor, have all recently been approved for the treatment of RA.
4 
Due to the high production costs, inconvenience of parenteral administration, increased risk 
for infections, and potential immunogenicity of biologicals, there is still a need for less expensive and orally active drugs. Hence, various companies are pursuing the development 
of small -molecule inhibitors, targeting disease- relevant signal transduction pathways , e.g., 
janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (tofacitinib, Pfizer; INCB28050, Incyte; VX 509, Vertex) or the 
spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor R788 (Rigel). 
In November  2012, to facitinib (Xeljanz
®) became the first JAK inhibitor to receive Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of adult patients with RA. Tofacitinib is a small molecule suitable for oral administration, has strong binding affinity f or JAK1 and 
JAK3, and weaker affinity for JAK2. The extensive pre- clinical and phase I, II, and III clinical 
development programs demonstrated its mechanisms of action via antiinflammatory and 
immunosuppressive effects. The drug proved to be efficacious in treating the signs and 
symptoms of RA and was well tolerated. Overall, the side- effects and risk profiles of 
tofacitinib are similar to those of several conventional antirheumatic agents with cytopaenias, elevated levels of liver function enzymes, increased level of low -density lipoprotein (LDL), 
high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol
5, and small increased risk for infections including 
serious and opportunistic infections seen during the studies. INCB28050, a molecule with 
strong binding affinity for JAK1 and 2, has been through extensive phase I and II testing and 
currently undergoing large scale phase III studies. In phase II clinical studies, VX -509

specifically targeted JAK3. Both these molecules have demonstrated efficacy roughly similar 
to tofacitinib with an equally manageable side- effect profile.  
6.2 Background on GLPG0634  
Janus kinases are intracellular cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (TYKs) that transduce cytokine 
signaling from membrane receptors to the nucleus of cells. JAK inhibitors block the signaling of various cytokines, growth factors and hormones, including the pro -inflammatory cytokine 
interleukin (IL) -6. Four different types of JAKs are known which (co- )interact with different 
sets of membrane receptors: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Inhibition of JAKs is a promising 
therapeutic option for a range of inflammatory conditions including RA and Crohn’s disease 
(CD).  
GLPG0634 is a potent and selective inhibitor of JAK1. The compound is currently in phase II 
development for RA and CD and has shown good preliminary efficacy in RA patients. No typical JAK2 side effects such as anemia were observed in clinical studies. The anticipated 
therapeutic daily dose range is 50 to 200 mg.  
GLPG0634 is metabolized to form one major active metabolite, G254445. Though the potency of this metabolite is lower than the parent molecule, the overall exposure and peak 
plasma concentration in humans is higher. As a consequence, dedicated pharmacology and toxicology studies have been performed with G254445. Results from pharmacodynamics 
(PD) testing in healthy volunteers suggest that the clinical activity of GLPG0634 could result 
from the combination of the parent molecule and the metabolite.  
More information on the study drug along  with references to support the cited data are  
presented in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).
6 A summary is provided hereafter. 
6.3 Background – Pre-clinical Studies  
6.3.1  Physical, Chemical , and Pharmaceutical Properties  and Formulations 
The chemical name of GLPG0634 is N -(5-(4-((1,1-dioxidothiomorpholin-4- yl)methyl)phenyl) -
[1,2,4]triazole[1,5- a]pyridin -2-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamide hydrochloride trihydrate.  
Two clinical formulations with various strengths are currently available: an oral capsule (10-100 mg per capsule) filled with the hydrochloride (HCl) salt of GLPG0634; and a film -coated 
tablet (25- 100 mg per tablet) of the HCl salt of GLPG0634.  
6.3.2  Nonclinical Pharmacology 
6.3.2.1  Primary and Secondary Pharmacology  
GLPG0634 is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -competitive inhibitor of JAK1. It is highly 
selective for inhibition of JAK1 among 451 unique kinase gene products tested in vitro . In 
cellular assays, it inhibits biological processes involving JAK1 from 179 nM onwards, with a 30-fold selectivity over JAK2 in human whole blood. A high potency is observed in the rat 
collagen- induced arthritis (CIA) model.  
Metabolite G254445 exhibits a similar JAK1 selectivity profile while being approximately 10-fold less potent as compared to parent GLPG0634, in vitro . In the rat CIA model, while being 
less potent than the parent molecule, G254445 displays a good curative effect against established arthritis.

8 Investigational Plan 
8.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is  a multicenter phase II b, double- blind, placebo- controlled, monotherapy  study in 
subjects with moderately  to severely active  RA who have an inadequate response to MTX  
alone. A total of 280 subject s will be randomized to one of 3 q.d.  dose regimens of 
GLPG0634 ( 50 mg q.d., 100 mg q.d., 200 mg q.d.) or to placebo.  
 Treatment duration will be 24 
weeks. At Week 12, all subjects on placebo and the subjects on the 50 mg dose who have 
not achieved a 20% improvement in swollen joint count (SJC 66) and tender joint count 
(TJC68) will be assigned (automatically via interactive voice/web response system [ IXRS ]) to 
100 mg q.d . in a blinded fashion and will continue the study until Week  24. Subjects in the 
other groups will maintain their randomized treatment until Week  24. 
To enhance the safety and integrity of the study data a DSMB consisting of independent 
experts will be convened to periodically review the accumulating safety data for the study.  
There will be an unbli nded interim analysis after all subjects have completed Week  12. This 
will be done by an independent statistician so that the regular study team will remain blinded. 
The interim analysis is intended to support preliminary dose selection for the phase III 
development program.   
At completion of the 24 -week treatment period, subjects will be offered the option to enter a 
Long  Term Follow -up study (GLPG0634- CL-205).  This Long Term Follow -up study is subject  
to separate approval from Regulatory Agencies and Ethics Committees.  
Subjects participating in the study will be requested to attend a total of 11 visits throughout 
the study : Screening v isit (up to 28 calendar days before Baseline v isit), Baseline v isit, Week 
1 visit, Week 2 visit, Week 4 visit, Week 8 visit, Week 12 visit, Week 16 visit, Week 20 visit, Week 24 visit, and for the subjects not entering the Long  Term Follow -up study (GLPG0634-
CL-205), a Follow -up visit 7 to 10 calendar days after end of stu dy treatment.  
Consequently, each subject  will remain in the study for approximately  29 weeks (from 
Screening visit to Follow -up visit). 
A dia gram of the study design can be found below:  
Week 1 – 12  Week 13 – 24   
Randomiz ed to placebo q.d.  All assigned  to 100 mg q.d.

8.3.4  Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessments  
Subjects may stop study medication for any of the following reasons: 
• Subject request.  
• Use of nonpermitted concurrent therapy. 
• Noncompliance with the study medication  (see Section 8.5.9 ). 
• Noncompliance with the study procedures  (see Section 8.5.9  and Section 8.6). 
• Lost to follow -up. 
• Occurrence of AEs not compatible with the continuation of subject participation in the 
study,  in the investigator’s opinion.  This also includes any clinically signifi cant 
laboratory results, ECGs, and  vital signs. 
• Investigator request.  
• Sponsor request.  
• Treatment failure deemed by the investigator  as lack of improvement or worsening of 
the disease symptoms or occurrence of intolerable AEs . 
Treatment with GLPG0634 will be discontinued and the patient withdrawn from this study for:  
• Serious infections (those requiring parenteral antimicrobial therapy or 
hospitalization).  
• Any opportunistic infections.  
• Complicated herpes zoster infection (multi -dermatomal, disseminated, ophthalmic or 
CNS involvement) .  
• Two sequential total white cell counts < 2000 cells/mm3 (SI: <2. 0 x 109 cells/L).  
• Two sequential neutrophil counts <1000 neutrophils/mm3 (SI: <1.0 x 109 cells/L). 
• Two sequential lymphocyte counts <750 lymphocytes/mm3 (SI: <0.75  x 109 cells/L) . 
• Two sequential hemoglobin < 8.0 g/dL  (SI: <80 g/L) . 
• Two sequential platelet counts <75,000 platelets/mm3 (SI: <75.0 x  109 cells/L) .

• Two sequential increases in serum creatinine >50% over the average of screening 
and baseline values2. 
• Two sequential decrease s from the baseline of i nhibin B by 50% or Testosterone by 
50% with concurrent increases in FSH or LH respectively .3 
After becoming aware of any of the above described abnormal laboratory changes occurring 
at any one time, an unscheduled visit ( i.e. second sequential) must occur to retest within 3 to 
5 days . 1 In each case, there is a need for additional investigations, such as review of ethanol, recreational drug and dietary 
supplement consumption; testing for acute hepatitis A, B or C infection and biliary tract imaging should be promptly discussed 
with the Study Medical Monitor.  
2 At the time of study completion or discontinuation, if a patient should exhibit elevations in serum creatinine ≥33% above the 
average of screening and baseline values, they should be re- tested every 1 to 2 weeks until the serum creatinine elevation is 
fully reversed to within 10% of the average of screening and baseline values .

3 In each case, hormones in male subjects should be monitored monthly and if no positive dynamics is seen after 3 months 
from stopping GLPG0634, referral to an andrologist should be considered.  
Subjects who stop study medication for any reason will not be replaced.  Subjects 
withdrawing from t he study will be encouraged to complete the same final evaluations as 
subjects completing the study according to the protocol, particularly safety evaluations in the 
subject’s interest, so that data can be record ed in the same way as for subjects who 
compl eted the study. Subjects are free to withdraw from the study at any time without 
providing reason(s) for withdrawal and without prejudice to further treatment.  The reason(s) 
for withdrawal will be documented in the electronic case report form ( eCRF).  
Reasonable efforts will be made to contact subjects who are lost to follow -up. These must be 
documented in the subject’s file.  
The sponsor has the right to terminate the study at any time in case of safety concerns  or if 
special circumstances concerning the study medication or the company itself occur, making 
further treatment of subjects impossible.  In this event, the investigator (s) and relevant 
authorities will be informed of the reason for study termination.  
8.4 Data Safety Monitoring Board  
To enhance the safety and integrity of the study data a DSMB consisting of independent 
experts will be convened to periodically review the accumulating safety data for the study. 
The first safety review by the DSMB will occur after the first 25% of subjects have been 
randomiz ed and received study drug to review accumulating safety data and to provide a 
recommendation on study continuation or termination early in case there is a concern 
regarding safety. From here on the DSMB will be convened every 3 months for periodic 
safety reviews. The specific responsibilities and composition of the DSMB are outlined in a 
separate document, the DSMB Charter. Also the details of outputs provided for the meetings are referenced in this separate DSMB Charter.  
8.5 Investigational Products 
8.5.1  Investigational Products A dministered  
The study medication will consist of 25, 50 and 100 mg capsules of GLPG0634 for oral 
administration or matching placebo.  
The following doses will be evaluated: 
• GLPG0634 50 mg q.d.: 2 capsules of 25 mg GLPG0634 in the morning.  
• GLPG0634 100 mg q.d.: 2 capsules of 50 mg GLPG0634 in the morning.  
• GLPG0634 200 mg q.d.: 2 capsules of 100 mg GLPG0634 in the morning. 
• Placebo: 2 placebo capsules in the morning.  
 
At Week 12, all subjects on placebo and the subjects on the 50 mg dose who have not 
achieved a 20% improvement in SJC 66 and TJC 68 will be assigned (automatically via IXRS) 
to 100 mg q.d. in a blinded fashion and will continue the study until Week  24. Subjects in the 
other groups will maintain their randomized treatment until Week  24.

At Week 12, all subjects on placebo and the subjects on the 50 mg dose who have not 
achieved 20% improvement in SJC66 and TJC 68 will be assigned (automatically via IXRS) 
to 100 mg q.d. in a blinded fashion and will continue the study until Week 24. Subjects in the 
other groups will maintain their randomized treatment until Week 24.  
8.5.5  Selection of Doses in the Study  
Details of the selection of doses in the study are  presented in Section 6.7. 
8.5.6  Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject  
The study medication will be administered daily with a glass of water  in the morning. 
Each subject’s dose will be selected by random allocation according to randomization 
procedures.  
If a subject misses a dose ( e.g., because he/she forgot to take the medication), he /she 
should take the missed dose within 5 hours after the planned intake time. If the study medication is not taken within 5 hours after the planned time, the missed dose should be 
skipped. For each dose taken, the number of capsules taken should be recorded on the 
subject’s diary card. Additional to the number of capsules taken, the date and time of the very first intake, and for selected visits, the 2 most recent intakes p rior to the visits will be 
recorded on the subject’s diary card.  During each visit, the investigator will record a 
summary of the study medication intake data in the eCRF. 
Dose reduction during the study is not allowed. Instead, the subject should either t emporarily 
stop all intake or permanently stop study medication.  Every effort should be made to contact 
the medical monitor before stopping study medication (temporarily or permanently).  
8.5.7  Blinding  
This is a randomized, double- blind study. The subject, the investigator, the study 
coordinator,  the sponsor , and the entire study processing team will remain blinded to 
treatment assignment. The blind can be broken only if the investigator deems it necessa ry 
for the safe treatment of a subject , and whenever possibl e the medical monitor and sponsor  
should be consulted before breaking the blind. 
If the blind is broken for any reason during the course of the study, the moment  on which the 
blind was broken and all other relevant information will be documented by the inv estigative 
site, , and other sponsor  designees, as appropriate. The reason for breaking 
the blind will be indicated and justified in the source documentation and in the eCRF. The 
blind can be broken by the investigator via the IXRS system . 
All subjects who are unblinded while on the study will be withdrawn at the moment  of 
unblinding, with the reason for unblinding given as the reason for  discontinuation from the 
study . If an AE leads to unblinding, the AE should be given as the reason for unblinding and 
the AE should also be recorded in the eCRF. All subjects who are unblinded should, where 
possible, complete the early discontinuation visit ( EDV). Any AEs should be followed until 
resolution.  
An unblinded interim analysis will be performed when all subjects have completed the Week 
12 visit. Details are provided in Section 8.8.1.5 .

8.5.8  Prior and C oncomitant Therapy  
Concomitant therapies taken for the long  term tr eatment of preexisting conditions can 
continue during the study provided they are in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. It is preferred that these medications be stabilized and continued without variation of 
dose or regimen during the study. 
In case new therapies need to be administered during the study, the risk/benefit to the 
subject should be carefully assessed and consideration given to the timing of any necessary 
introduction of new medications. 
Permit ted concomitant medications at S creening and during the study include:  
• Antimalarials, which must be at a stable dose for at least 12 weeks prior to Baseline. 
• NSAIDs , provided that the dose is stable for at least 2 weeks prior to Baseline and, if 
possible, is kept constant during the study;  
• Oral steroids , provided that the dose is stable, is ≤10 mg/day prednisone or 
equivalent for at least 4 weeks prior to Baseline, and is kept stable for the study 
duration; and  
• Analgesics, other than NSAIDs, up to the maximum recommended doses may be 
used for pain as required. However, subjects must not take analgesics within 24 
hours before a visit where clinical efficacy assessments are performed and recorded.  
Female subjects of childbearing potential will use highly effective birth-control methods as 
outlined in the inclusion  criteria and agree to continue their use during the study and for at 
least 12 weeks after the last dose of study medication. The use of hormonal contraceptives 
will be recorded in the Concomitant Therapy section of the eCRF. Applicable procedures and treatment guidance based on package inserts will be respected.  
Hormone replacement therapy will be allowed in post -menopausal women if ongoing at the 
time of S creening. The use of hormone replacement therapy will be recorded in the 
Concomitant Therapy sec tion of the eCRF. Applicable procedures and treatment guidance 
based on package inserts will be respected.  
Prohibited medication during the study include any non-biological DMARDS . 
Current or previous RA treatment with a biologic  DMARD  is prohibited, with the exception of 
biologic DMARDs administered in a single clinical study setting more than 6 months prior to 
Screening (12  months for rituximab or other B -cell depleting agents), where the biologic 
DMARD was effective, and if discontinued, this should not be  due to lack of efficacy.  
Previous treatment at any time with a cytotoxic  agent, other than MTX, before S creening , is 
prohibited. These agents include, but are not limited to chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, nitrogen mustard, and other alkylating agents.  
Previous use of JAK inhibitors  is prohibited . 
Receipt of an intra -articular or parenteral corticosteroid injection within 4 weeks prior to 
Screening is prohibited.

Vaccination with live components is prohibited during the study and for 6 weeks after the last 
dose of study drug. Also routine household contact with persons vaccinated with live vaccine 
components should be avoided. These vaccines include varicella, oral polio and inhaled flu 
vaccine. General guidelines suggest that exposure should be avoided following vaccination 
with these vaccines for the stated time period: 
• Varicella or attenuated typhoid fever vaccination for 4 weeks following vaccination;  
• Oral polio vaccination for 6 weeks following vaccination;  
• Attenuated rotavirus vaccine for 10 calendar days following vaccination;  
• Inhaled flu vaccine for 1 week following vaccination.  
When inactivated flu vaccines are to be used during the study, it should be borne in mind 
that vaccination responses have not been studied during the adm inistration of GLPG0634. 
Currently, there are no available data on continuous use of GLPG0634 and its impact on immune responses following  vaccination.  
8.5.9  Treatment C ompliance and Drug Accountability 
For each dose taken, the date, the time of intake, and the number of capsules taken should 
be recorded on the subject diary card. 
The investigator or designated study personnel will maintain a log of all drug dispensed and 
returned. Drug supplies for each subject will be inventoried and accounted for throughout th e 
study.  
Subjects with a poor compliance (<80% or >120%) will be retained by the study site. If study drug compliance remains <80% or >120% between study visits, or if the subject missed 
more than 2 visits, the subject will be evaluated for potential discontinuation. Any 
discontinuation should be done in consultation with the Medical Monitor.  
8.5.10  Subject Diary Card  
Subjects will record any changes in concomitant illnesses , new AEs and any change in AEs 
or their concomitant medication in their diary card. A Es and changes in concomitant 
medication will be transcribed into the eCRF by the investigator. Details of dosing with study medication will be recorded in the subject diary and summarized in the eCRF by the 
investigator.  
The subject diary card will be considered source information. The data from the subject diary 
card will not be entered into the study database.  
8.6 Study Procedures  
All planned study assessments are presented in the flow chart in Section 8.7.1.5 . 
8.6.1  Pre-treatment

8.7.1  Efficacy, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and S afety Measurements 
Assessed and Flow Chart  
8.7.1.1  Efficacy  Assessments  
8.7.1.1.1  Evaluation of Disease Activity  
Efficacy assessments will be carried out at Screening (joint counts and P atient’s Global 
Assessment of Disease Activity only) ; Baseline (Day -1); Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 , and 
24; and the EDV (if applicable).  
Each of 68 joints will be evaluated for tenderness, and each of 66 joints will be evaluated for 
swelling  (Appendix  13.2).  
A joint assessor with adequate training and experience in performing joint assess ments will 
be designated at each study site to perform  all joint assessments. The joint assessor should 
preferably be a rheumatologist ; however, if a rheumatologist is not available, it should be a 
health care worker with at least one year ’s experience in performing joint assessments. The 
assessor should remain the same throughout the study per subject, as much as possible. It 
is required that the designated joint assessor identify an appropriate back -up assessor to 
provide coverage if the designated joint assessor is absent.  
8.7.1.1.2  Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity  
The Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity will be recorded on a 0 to 100 visual 
analog scale (VAS), with 0 indicating “very well” and 100 indicating “very poor”  in answer to 
the question “Considering all the ways arthritis affects you, how well are you doing today?” 
(Appendix  13.3). 
8.7.1.1.3  Physician’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity  
The Physician’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity will be recorded on a 0 to 100 mm 
VAS, with 0 indicating “no disease activity” and 100 indicating “ extreme  disease activity ”. 
The evaluating physician and the subject must complete the global assessments independently of each other ( Appendix  13.4).  
8.7.1.1.4  Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ -DI) 
The functional status of the subject will be assessed using the HAQ -DI. This 20- question 
instrument asse sses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 
domains  (dressing, arising, ea ting, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping , and 
errands/chores ). Responses are scored on a 4- point Likert scale from 0 , indicating no 
difficulty , to 3, indicating inability to perform a task in that area.  The need for aids/devices or 
help from another person will also be recorded. The HAQ- DI total score ranges from 0 to 3 
with higher scores indicating greater dysfunction  (Appendix  13.5).  
As part of the HAQ -DI, subjects will be asked to assess their average pain during the last 
week on a 0 to 100 mm VAS, with 0 indicating “no pain” and 100 indicating “severe pain”. 
This assessment should be completed before the joint examination. This pain score will be 
used to drive the ACR20/50/70.

8.7.1.1.5  FACIT Fatigue Scale  
The FACIT fatigue scale (version 4) measures an individual’s level of fatigue during their 
usual daily activities over the past week. It consists of 13 questions  with a 7- day recall period 
on a 5- point Likert scale, with 0 indicating “not at all ” and 4 indicating “very much”. The total 
score ranges from 0 to 52. The higher the score , the better the quality of life ( Appendix  13.6).  
8.7.1.1.6  36-Item Short -form Health Survey (SF- 36) 
The health– related quality of life of the subject will be assessed using the SF- 36 (version 2) 
with a 4 -week recall period. This consists of 36 questions belonging to 8 domains in 2 
components:  
• Physical well- being: 4 domains: physical functioning (10 items), role physical 
(4 items), bodily pain (2 items) , and general health perceptions (5 items).  
• Mental well -being: 4 domains: vitality (4 items), social functioning (2 items), role 
emotional (3 items) , and mental health (5 items).  
The remaining item (health transition) is not part of the above domains but is kept separately  
(Appendix  13.7). 
These scales will be rescaled from 0 to 100 (converting the lowest possible score to 0 and 
the highest possible score to 100), with higher scores indicating a better quality of life . 
8.7.1.2  Pharmacokinetic  Assessments  
One blood sample (2 mL) for analysis of GLPG0634 and its metabolite (G254445) in plasma 
will be collected at Weeks 4, 12, and 24 or the EDV, if applicable,  by venipuncture (or 
indwelling cannula) in the forearm into tubes containing lithium heparin and will be 
immediately chilled (ice bath), processed , and frozen as plasma at -20oC (-4° F). 
8.7.1.3  Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
Blood samples for PD assessments will be collected in all subjects at Baseline (Day - 1), 
Week 1, Week 4, Week 12 and Week 24 or the EDV, if appli cable. 
Two blood samples of 2.5 mL each will be collected in 2 PAX-gene tubes. Immediately after 
collection, the tubes will be  gently inverted 8 to 10 times and stored at room temperature for 
a minimum of 2 hours and a maxim um of 72 hours before freezing a t -20°C  (-4° F) for 
storage until further analysis (gene expression in circulating leukocytes  and messenger 
ribonucleic acid as well as micro ribonucleic acid [ miRNA ] profiling).  
Additionally , 1 blood sample of 8.5 mL will be collected in a SST tube. The s ample will be 
allowed to clot in the tube for 30 minutes at room temperature, after which the tube will be 
centrifuged. Serum will be extracted, divided over 4 aliquots , and frozen at -80°C  (-112°F) 
until further analysis (analytes and miRNA profiling).

8.7.1.4  Safety Assessments  
8.7.1.4.1  Adverse Event Definitions and Reporting  
8.7.1.4.1.1  Definitions  
ICH and European guidance will be followed for AE reporting.  
Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a 
medicinal (investigational or  noninvestigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of a medicinal  (investigational or noninvestigational) product, whether or not 
related to that medicinal (investigational or noninvestigational) product.  
This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in intensity or frequency from the baseline condition (signing the ICF)  or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, 
including laboratory test abnormalities.  
Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets any of the following conditions:  
• results in death.  
• is life -threatening: the subject is at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not 
refer to an event that hypothetically might cause death if it were more severe.  
• requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
• is a medically significant event that may not be immediately life- threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention 
to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definitions above.  
Unexpected Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information  
An AE is considered unexpected if the nature or intensity is not consistent with the 
applicable product reference safety information. For an investigational product, the expectedness of an AE will be determined by whether or not it is listed in the I B.  
Intensity of an Adverse Event  
Each AE must be rated on a 3 -point scale of increasing intensity: 
• Mild: Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required. 
• Moderate: Mild to moderate limitation in activity; some assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required . 
• Severe: Marked limitation in activity; some assistance usually required; medical 
intervention/therapy required, hospitalization possible.

If there is a change in intensity of an ongoing AE, it must be recorded as a separate event. 
Causality  Assessment  
The following decision choice will be used by the investigator to describe the causality 
assessment between the reported event and the investigational medicinal product.  
• Unrelated: No relationship between the AE and the administration of investigational 
product; related to other etiologies such as  concomitant medications or subject’s 
clinical state.  
• Unlikely: Event  or laboratory test abnormality  with a time to study medication intake 
that makes a relationship improbable (but not impossible). Disease or other drugs 
provide plausible explanations.  
• Possible: Event  or laboratory test abnormality  with reasonable time relationship to 
study medication intake which could also be explained by disease or other drugs. 
Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
• Probable: Event  or laboratory test abnormality  with reasonable time relationship to 
study medication intake. Event unlikely to be attributed to disease or other drugs. 
Response to withdrawal is clinically reasonable and rechallenge not required.  
• Certain: Event or laboratory test abnormality, with plausible time relationship to study 
medication intake that  cannot be explained by disease or other drugs. Response to 
withdrawal is plausible (pharmacologically, pathologically). Event definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically ( i.e. an objective and specific medical 
disorder or a recognized pharmacological phenomenon). Rechallenge satisfactory, if 
necessary.  
Action Taken Regarding Investigational Product  
The action taken must be described by choosing among:  
• Dose not changed: No action is taken regarding the study medication. 
• Study medication permanently withdrawn: Subject is permanently withdrawn from the 
study.  
• Study medication temporarily withdrawn: Study drug is temporarily withdrawn.  
• Not applicable: Other situations ( e.g., AE started aft er the last study medication 
administration)  
Outcome  
Each AE must be rated by choosing among: 
• Recovered/resolved.  
• Recovered/ resolved with sequelae. 
• Not recovered/ not resolved.  
• Fatal.  
• Recovering/ resolving.  
• Unknown.

Subjects should rest for at least 5 minutes in the supine position before ECG evaluation. 
Parameters to be recorded in the eCRF include: HR, RR, QRS, uncorrected QT  interval , 
morphology, and rhythm analysis. QT interval corrected by Friderica’s formula will be derived 
during the statistical analysis. ECGs will be interpreted by the investigator for clinical 
significance and results will be entered into the eCRF. 
Chest X -ray 
A chest X -ray (both anterior -posterior and lateral views) will be taken during the S creening 
period and reviewed by a qualified radiologist. If chest radiographs have been taken within 3 
months  of the Screening v isit (documented evidence is needed) then the chest radiographs 
do not need to be repeated (as long as they demonstrate no clinically significant abnormality , 
and no signs or symptoms suggestive of lung disease including current active or latent TB, 
which  would exclude the subject from the study). The results must be entered into the eCRF.

8.7.2  Appropriateness of M easurements  
The efficacy and safety assessments are widely used and generally recogni zed as reliable, 
accurate , and relevant to the disease condition. 
8.8 Statis tical M ethods  
8.8.1  Statistical and Analytical  Plans 
A detailed statistical analysis plan will be created and finalized prior to the interim database 
lock and the final database lock . 
8.8.1.1  Datasets or Populations Analyzed  
All randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and have at 
least one post -Baseline efficacy assessment will be included in the efficacy analy sis 
(intent -to-treat [ITT]). 
A secondary per -protocol analysis will be performed to confirm the ITT analysis, excluding 
subjects with major protocol deviations  (such as Baseline CRP within normal range , 
Baseline TJC 68 <8, Baseline SJC66 <6, <80% study medication compliance, or use of 
forbidden concomitant medications) . Full details of the major protocol deviations  will be 
described in the statistical analysis plan, with adherence to  analysis sets agreed upon prior 
to database lock  and unblinding . 
All randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication will be included 
in the safety analysis.  
All randomized subjects who received at least one dose of GLPG0634 and who have at least 
one PK measurement will be included in the PK analysis.  
Reasons for study termination will be tabulated.  
8.8.1.2  Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic characteristics will be listed. Demographic characteristics will be summarized 
using appropriate descriptive statistics, as applicable. Details of the summaries to be 
produced will be included in the statistical analysis plan.  
8.8.1.3  Efficacy Variables  
Definition of Primary Efficacy Endpoint  – ACR20 at Week 12  
The primary endpoint is the percentage of subjects achieving an ACR20 response at Week 
12. Other time points will be regarded as secondary endpoints.  
The ACR response is a measurement of improvement in multiple disease assessment 
criteria. The ACR20 response is defined as:  
≥20% improvement from Baseline in SJC66 (66 joints) and TJC 68 (68 joints)  
AND  
≥20% im provement from B aseline in at least 3 of the following 5 assessments

• Pain (VAS)  in cm  (from HAQ -DI). 
• Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS)  in cm . 
• Physician’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS)  in cm . 
• Patient’s Assessment of Physical Function as measured by HAQ -DI. 
• CRP  in mg/dL or mg/L . 
Definition of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
ACR 50 and ACR70  
ACR50 and ACR70 are defined similarly to  ACR20, except the improvement threshold from 
Baseline is 50% and 70%, respectively.   
ACR -N 
The ACR -N8 is the smallest percent age improvement in swollen and tender joints and the 
median of the remaining 5 core parameters, and is expected to be more sensitive to change 
than the ACR20, ACR50 or ACR70. 
ACR- N = MIN [%improvement in TJC 68,  
%improvement in SJC66 ,  
MED %improvement in (Patient’s Global Assessment , Physician’s  
Global Assessment, HAQ-DI, CRP) ] 
ACR/ EULAR Re mission 
A subject’s disease activity status  can be defined as being in remission:  
when scores on the TJC28, SJC28, CRP ( actual value in mg/dL) and P atient Global 
Assessment of Disease Activity (cm) are all ≤1. 
Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI)  
The SDAI9 is the numerical sum of 5  outcome parameters: TJC 28, SJC 28, P atient Global 
Assessment of Disease Activity (in cm), Physician’s  Global Assessment of Disease Activity 
(in cm) and CRP (mg/dL).  
SDAI = TJC28 + SJC 28 + Patient’s G lobal Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS in cm) + 
Physician’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS in cm) + CRP (mg/dL)  
The SDAI can be categorized:  
• High disease activity: SDAI >26  
• Moderate disease activity: [ 11,26]  
• Low disease activity: [3.3,11]  
• Remission: ≤3.3  
Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI)  
The CDAI10 is the SDAI modified to exclude CRP. 
CDAI = TJC28 + SJC28 + Patient ’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS in cm) + 
Physician’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS in cm)

The CDAI can also be categorized:  
• High disease activity: >22  
• Moderate disease activity: [ 10,22]  
• Mild disease activity: [2.8,10]  
• Remission: ≤2.8 
Disease Activity Score Based on 28 Joints Corrected for C -reactive Protein 
(DAS28 [CRP]) 
The DAS28(CRP)11 is a statistically derived index combining tender joints (28 joints), swollen 
joints (28 joints), CRP , and Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity (general health, 
GH). DAS28 (CRP)  is defined as follows:  
DAS28 (CRP) = 0.56 x SQRT(T JC28) + 0.28 x SQRT(S JC28) +  0.36 x Ln(CRP+1) + 0.014 x 
GH +  0.96,  
Where:  
TJC28 is 28- joint count for tenderness  
SJC28 is 28- joint count for swelling.  
Ln(CRP1+1) is the natural logarithm of (CRP value [mg/L]  + 1) 
SQRT is square root  
GH is the Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity on a 100 mm VAS  
 
Categorization of the DAS28(CRP)  scores: 
High disease activit y: >5.1  
Moderate disease activity: [3.2,5.1]  
Low disease activity: [2.6,3.2]  
Remission: <2.6  
EULAR Response 
A second categorization of the DAS28(CRP) will be done according to the following table12: 
Actual 
DAS28(CRP)  Improvement in DAS28(CRP) from Baseline:  
> 1.2 > 0.6, ≤ 1.2 ≤ 0.6 
≤ 3.2 Good  Moderate  None  
> 3.2, ≤ 5.1 Moderate  Moderate  None  
> 5.1  Moderate  None  None  
 
Quality of Life - FACIT Fatigue Scale and SF- 36 
Quality of life will be assessed using the FACIT fatigue scale and the SF-36 questionnaire.  
The appropriate (sub)totals will be derived according to the scale’s scoring algorithm.

Methods of Analysis  
Efficacy data (ACR20, ACR50, ACR70, ACR -N, DAS28[ CRP ]), EULAR response, and 
ACR/EULAR remission, and components of the ACR, CDAI and SDAI at each post -dosing 
visit) will be analyzed descriptively.  
Between- group comparisons will be done for each dose group versus the placebo group. 
Hommel’s closed -testing correction procedure (as implemented in SAS PROC MULTTEST) 
will be applied to adjust for multiplicity.  
This s tudy is not powered for any formal comparison among the GLPG0634 dose groups . 
However, differences between the dose groups will be calculated and presented with a 95% 
confidence interval. No adjustment for multiplicity will be done for these exploratory 
differences.  
All subjects from the placebo group and non responding subjects from the 50 mg group who 
are reassigned to 100 mg at Week 12 will be handled as follows:  
• Their W eek 12 value will be carried forward in the original treatment group to all 
further time points (and between- group comparisons) after W eek 12.  
• Their actual assessments on W eeks 16, 20 , and 24 will be analyzed descriptively as 
these represent their response after 12 weeks of GLPG 0634 exposure after first 
having received placebo or failed on a low dose.  
Analysis methods  per post -Baseline time point : 
• Binary parameters: logistic regression model with factors treatment, region and previous use of biologics . 
• Conti nuous parameters: changes from B aseline and percent changes from B aseline: 
using an analysis of (co)variance model with factors treatment, baseline value, region  
and previous use of biologics . 
• Time to response (ACR20/50/70) will be analyzed using Kaplan- Meier survival 
techniques, and groups will be compared against placebo using  a Cox pr oportional 
hazards regression model with factors treatment, region and previous use of biologics .  
Other applicable factors, if any, will also be included in the models. Quality of life data 
(FACIT fatigue scale and SF- 36 questionnaire) will be analyzed descriptively. Exploratory 
between- group comparisons will also be done at each post -Baseline time point using 
analysis of (co)variance  models on the changes from Ba seline with factors treatment, 
Baseline value, region and previous use of biologics .  
Handlin g of disc ontinued subjects during the 24- week treatment period:  
• Subjects who discontinue within the first week so that ACR20/50/70 responses 
cannot be determined will be classified as nonresponders.  
• For all discontinued subjects, their last observed non- missing result will be used in 
the subsequent visits ( last observation carried forward algorithm) and for the 
ACR20/50/70 responses as part of the secondary/supportive analyses.  
A descriptive sensitivity analysis by country, geographic region and previous us e of biologics 
will be performed for the ACR criteria response rates.

• Compliance with the protocol.  
• Consent procedure.  
• Source documents.  
• AE procedures.  
• Storage and accountability of materials.  
The monitoring visits also provide the sponsor with the opportunity to ensure the 
investigator’s obligations and all applicable ICH or health authority regulation requirements 
are being fulfilled.  
The investigator must permit the monitor, the IEC /IRB, the sponsor’s internal auditors and 
representatives from regulatory authorities direct access to all study- related documents and 
pertinent hospital or medical records for confirmation of data contained within the eCRFs. 
Subject confidentiality will be protected at all times.  
8.9.3  Data Management and Coding 
 will be responsible for activities associated with the data management of this 
study. This will include setting up a relevant database and data transfer mechanisms, along with appropriate validation of data and resolution of queries. Data generated within this 
clinical study will be handled according to the relevant standard operating procedures 
(SOPs) of the data management and biostatis tics departments of  
Study cent ers will enter data directly into the electronic data capture (EDC) system by 
completing the eCRF  via a secure internet connection. Data entered into the eCRF must be 
verifiable against source documents at the study cent er. Data to be recorded directly on the 
eCRF (without prior written or electronic record) will be identified, and the eCRF will be 
considered the source document. Any changes to the data entered into the EDC system will 
be recorded in the audit trail and will be FDA Code of Federal Regulations  (CFR)  21 Part  11 
compliant.  
Data entered into the eCRF will be validated as defined in the data validation plan. External data checks will be programmed where appropriate ( e.g. for laboratory data, and ECGs) as 
well as for cr oss table checking between eCRFs ( e.g., AE and concomitant medication 
forms).  
Medical coding will use the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  for concomitant 
diseases and AEs and World Health Organization Drug for medications.  
Missing or inconsistent data will be queried in writing to the investigator for clarification. 
Subsequent modifications to the database will be documented.

9 Records and Supplies  
9.1 Drug Accountability  
On receipt of the study medication, the investigator (or deputy) will conduct an inventory of 
the supplies and verify that study medication supplies are received intact and in the correct 
amounts before  completing  a supplies receipt.  The investigator will retain a copy of this 
receipt at the study  center  and return the original receipt to the study monitor.  The inventory 
of supplies at each study cent er may b e checked at any time during the study by the 
monitor.  
It is the responsibility of the study monitor to ensure that the investigator (or deputy) has 
correctly documented the amount received, dispensed, and returned of the study medication 
on the dispensing  log that will be provided.  A full drug accountability log will be maintained at 
the study  center  at all times.  The study monitor will arrange collection/destruction of unused 
study medic ation returned by the subject.  The study monitor will also perform an  inventory of 
study medication at the close -out visit to the study center . All discrepancies must b e 
accounted for and documented. 
9.2 Financing and Insurance 
Financing and insurance of this study will be outlined in a separate agreement between  
 and the sponsor.

The investigator or designated personnel will inform the subject of the objectives, methods, anticipated benefits and potential risks and inconveniences of the study. The subject should 
be given every opportunity to ask for clarification of any points he does not understand and, 
if necessary, ask for more information. At the end of the interview, the subject will be given 
ample time to consider the study. Subjects will be required to sign and date the ICF. After signatures are obtained, the ICF will be kept and archived by the investigator in the 
investigator’s study file. A signed and dated copy of the subject ICF will be provided to the 
subject or their authorized representati ve. 
It should be emphasized to the subject that he or she is at liberty to refuse to enter the study or to withdraw from the study at any time, without consequences for their further care or penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled. Subjects who refuse to

give or who withdraw written informed consent should not be included or continue in the 
study.  
If new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s willingness to continue participation in the study, a new ICF will be approved by the IEC(s)/IRB(s) (and 
Regulatory Authorities if required). The study subjects will be informed about this new information and re consent will be obtained.  
10.5 Subject Confidentiality  
Monitors, auditors, and other authorized agents of  the sponsor and/or its designee, the 
IEC(s)/IRB(s)  approving this research, and the United States FDA, as well as that of any 
other applicable agency(ies)  in other countries, will be granted direct access to the study 
subjects’ original medical records for verification of clinical study procedures and/or data, 
without violating the confidentiality of the subjects to the extent permitted by the law and regulations. In any presentations of the results of this study or in publications, the subjects’ 
identity will remain confidential.

11 Reporting and Publication, Including Archiving 
The name of the coordinating investigator will be documented separately. During the study, 
the sponsor will contact some of the participating investigators and assess their interest  in 
taking up the role of the coordinating investigator. Once selected the coordinating 
investigator will help review and sign- off the final clinical study report. 
Essential documents are those documents that individually and collectively permit evaluation  
of the study and quality of the data produced. After completion of the study, all documents 
and data relating to the study will be kept in an orderly manner by the investigator in a secure study file.  This file will be available for inspection by the sponsor or its 
representatives.  Essential documents should be retained for 2 years after the final marketing 
approval in an ICH region or for at least 2 years since the discontinuation of clinical 
development of the test drug/investigational product  or according to local regulation if they 
state otherwise. . It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the study  center  of when 
these documents no longer need to be retained . The investigator must contact the sponsor 
before destroying any study related documentation.  In addition, all subject medical records 
and other source documentation will be kept for the maximum time permitted by the hospital, 
institution , or me dical practice.  
The sponsor must review and approve any results of the study or abstracts for pr ofessional 
meetings prepared by the investigator(s).  Published data must not compromise the 
objectives of the study.  Data from individual study cent ers in multi- center studies must not be 
published separately.

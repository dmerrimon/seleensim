1. Synopsis  
Little real -world data are available on the antibody response after COVID -19 vaccination in HIV -
negative and HIV -positive individuals, the potential usage of quantitative antibody testing to 
determine those at greatest risk for infection while helping guide additional vaccination timing, 
and the antibody response of vaccine boosting in individuals with no response or low response 
to initial v accinations.  At the moment, clinicians must rely on general category 
recommendations and clinical judgement when advising their patients on the utility of vaccine 
boosting, as well as their level of protection from COVID vaccination. Real -world evidence is  
needed to better inform such decisions. The aim of this study is to assess  levels of COVID -19 
vaccine  response  through measuring surrogate Ig spike antibody measurements , to determine 
the rates of antibody level decay  after vaccination , and to measure the efficacy of utilizing 
these antibody measurements to help guide the timing of  booster doses among HIV -negative 
and HIV -positive patients.  
 
The study population will include adults who were fully va ccinated against SARS -CoV-2 virus  
(i.e., two d oses of  Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or one dose of the  J&J vaccine), and have 
received a Roche SARS -CoV-2 Semi -Quant Spike Ig Ab test at least 3 weeks after full vaccination 
as part of their  usual clinical care at AHF Midtown Manhattan Healthcare Center . 
 
Incidence rates of COVID vaccine response levels (i.e., adequate, low , non-response ) will be 
estimated using univariate Poisson  regression , overall and by vaccine type. Among individuals 
with at least two antibody measurements , rates of antibody levels  decay  will be estimated  
using univariate linear regression, overall and stratified by HIV status, vaccine type and baseline 
CD4 cell count.  In the sub -population of individuals who received a COVID vaccine booster, 
vaccination and antibody response will be characterized  at least 3 weeks after the booster is 
received . Univariate linear regression will be used to estimate rates of antibody levels  decay , 
among individuals with at least two antibody measurements, including one after the booster 
dose. Rates of response decay  will be produced overall, and stratified by HIV status, booster 
type and baseline CD4 cell count.

2. Introduction  
BACKGROUND  
Currently, there is little guidance  as to when to give a COVID -19 booster vaccine, particularly for 
those under the age of 65, the non -immunosuppressed, and with those with different types of 
immune modifying conditions .  Clinicians have thus been asked to use  clinical judgement  and 
patient discussion  to determine if such a booster vaccine is appropriate, lead ing to great 
variability in practices. In addition, there is limited  real-world  evidence of vaccination response 
both amongst vaccination type and amongst differing patient populations.  Hence , individuals 
who have been vaccinated, may assume they are prot ected, but in actuality have not 
developed, or sustained a protective antibody response .  Conversely, some people may fall into 
a category for which vaccinations may be given, but there are limited data to support giving an 
additional dose of vaccine, espe cially if they lie outside the  guidance established for the  age 
over 65 and immunosuppressed patient population s.   However, the potential need to 
proactively give additional vaccinations in this population are exemplified  in studies in Israeli 
healthcare workers as well as in the general population which  show that post vaccination 
waning antibody levels are highly correlated with risk of re -infection, severe disease, and 
hospitaliza tion and booster vaccination is correlated with decreased incidence rates.i,ii  In 
contrast, those patients with sufficient antibody titers, who otherwise would have received an 
additional vaccine  through general age and timeline guided recommendations , would n o longer 
need to receive the additional vaccination, thus potentially conserving resources for those in 
greatest need such as for  countries  deficient in primary vaccination s.  Although the totality of 
an individual’s immune response from a primary vaccine series may mostly control severe 
COVID -19 illness leading to hospitalizations, i n states where there are inadequate primary 
vaccinatio n rate s, even mildly symptomatic vaccinated carriers of the virus may serve as 
sources for the cont inued propagation of SARS -CoV-2 infection and further inhibition of 
pandemic control.   Super -spreader congregations of even mostly vaccinated populations , like in 
the outbreak reported by the MMWR in Massachusetts,  further exemplify the continued 
propagati on of the virus to both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.iii 
 
Additional vaccine doses may be particularly important for healthcare providers who are often 
in direct contact or close proximity to SARS -CoV-2 infected individuals , where resurgences of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported across the U.S., especially in the era of the SARS -CoV-
2 Delta strain .iv,v In addition, the odds of long COVID -19 symptomology were  estimated in one 
study to be 50% less in the vaccinated versus the insufficiently immunized population.vi In 
contrast, those healthcare workers who have sufficient immunogenicity  against prevalent SARS -
CoV-2 strains, may not fit the compartmentalization  into time -based vaccination strategies, but 
rather individualized immunologic responses to vaccinations.  Furthermore, due  to the 
  Confidential  
   
interpersonal variability of immunologic response, differences in the attenuation of individual 
antibody levels, and the complex ity added by the availability of different vaccines , dosing 
regimens, and decay rates, a better methodology for determining when a specific indiv idual 
requires re -vaccination should be determined.   With no current correlations of protection, 
especially in populations in which preventing infection is the goal, the higher the antibody titer 
the better.  Studies have demonstrated that those who were vaccinated for SARS -CoV-2 are 
generally in favor for  receiving additional booster doses .  Furthe rmore,  an incre ase in 
significant adverse events , other than lymphadenopathy , have not been reported in recipients 
of additional SARS -CoV-2 vaccine doses beyond the primary series.vii  The effectiveness of 
additional booster vaccination  over the primary vaccination series  in preventing re -infection 
with SARS -CoV-2 for currently available vaccine types have been demonstrated in a number of 
studiesviii,ix,, only the timing of when and to whom to give booster dosing remains in debate.  
Lastly,  multiple studies illustrate that  the maximizing of timing between vaccination doses, 
regardless of mRNA or adenovirus vaccination type, results in improved immunologic responses 
both in initial degree, but also in the persistence of response .x,xi,xii,xiii   
 
Neutralizing antibody levels are predictive of immune protection from symptomatic SARS -CoV-
2 infection  and are correlated with commercially available measurements with semi -
quantitative spike Ig antibodiesxiv,xv.  Although antiviral T and B cell memory cells can confirm 
additional degree of protection, current rapidly proliferating COVID -19 strains like  the Delta 
strain may have shorter incubation periods that may not allow time for primed B and T memory 
cells to be activated, so protection would be more depen dent on sufficient circulating 
antibo dies.   Furthermore, the high R correlation of neutralizing antibodies and  spike  Ig 
antibody responses have been strongly associated with viral neutralization and inhibition of 
viral -cell fusion .xvi,xvii A 50% protective neutralization level has been found to  equate to a 
measured in vitro neutralization titer of between 1:10 and 1:30 is approximated at 54 IU/m L for 
wild -type COVID -19 Virus  [95% CI : 30–96 IU/m L]),xviii whereas 5x that level, or approximately 
250 IU/mL is the expected Spike Ig ab level correlated with in vitro neutralization of the 
predominant Delta strain of COVID -19.xix 
 
Clinical decision -making and public health policies relating to COVID -19 have been evolving 
rapidly, sometimes based on a sparse body of literature. Given the high stakes of such 
decisions, there is an urgent need for more real -world evidence to inform cli nical practice and 
public health guidelines.

RATIONALE FOR THE ST UDY  
Limited  real-world data are available on the antibody response after COVID -19 vaccination 
comparing  HIV-negative and HIV -positive individuals .  There are also limited information  that 
would allow  the potential usage of quantitative antibody testing to determine those at greatest 
risk for infection while could help in  guid ing the timing of  additional vaccination s.  There are 
also limited information on  the antibody response of vaccine  boosting in individuals , especially 
those with altered immune response that might lead to  no response or low response to the 
primary vaccination  series . At the moment, clinicians must rely on clinical judgement when 
advising their patients on the utility of vaccine boosting, as well as their level of protection from 
COVID vaccination. Additional information would be helpful in informing decisions on third  
doses in different populations  such as HIV positive people, whose responses to COVID -19 
vaccine and immune status would help define the timing and need for an additional  vaccination 
based on current recommendations.  Real -world evidence is needed to bette r inform such 
decisions.

DESCRIPTION OF THE D ATABASE  AND PREPARATION OF ANALYTICAL FILES  
The OPERA® (Observational Pharmaco -Epidemiology Research & Analysis) database and 
research network is a multi -site observational database built from the complete patient health 
records  managed in Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems from more than 400 participating 
caregivers at 142 separate locations throughout the U.S. (see coverage map , Figure 1 ).  Through 
their membership in OPERA, medical practices meet the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid 
Services (CMS) Merit -based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) Incentive Program for Integration 
with a Specialized Registry.   OPERA -participating physicians and ancillary healthcare providers 
have documented the care of nearly 1 million patients in their EHRs, including over 135,000 
people living with HIV ( PLWH ) of which approximately 20% are women, 47% are Black, 20% are 
Hispanic and representing 11% of all the PWLH in the U.S. The OPERA database is refreshed 
from these EHR systems at each clinic on  a daily basis providing up -to-date data for both 
clinicians and researchers.   In total, there are more than 7 million documented prospective 
visits in the EHR systems for PLWH and 3 million prescriptions written for ART medications. The 
average years of f ollow -up (years of documenting patient visits prospectively in the EHR) for 
  Confidential  
   
PLWH in OPERA is 4.2 years and there are over 19,000 PLWH who have 10 years or more of 
follow -up.

Data Aggregation Methodology:  
Epividian provides participating clinicians with a variety of analytical reports that support the 
day-to-day care of patients, the management of their patient populations as well as their 
interventional and non -interventional research efforts. By utilizing these practice reports via 
the CHORUSTM portal and by pooling data in OPERA® with other clinics, clinicians can measure 
and compare quality -of-care anonymously as well as collaborate on resea rch endeavors with 
colleagues in other geographic regions. As a result, all parties have a vested interest in 
maintaining the completeness and accuracy of the medical records stored in the EHR systems.  
 
Epividian utilizes a number of proprietary algorithms  to sort, classify, and aggregate the data 
pulled from the participating clinics’ EHR systems. The process includes automated 
classification of clinical terms into common clinical terms with review by trained medical staff. 

  Confidential  
   
The standardization of the data to common terms and application of the Epividian knowledge 
base are key process steps in gathering data from multiple heterogeneous EHR systems and 
databases from many locations into a single, homogenous OPERA database for conducting 
research and commercia l analyses. The patient health data gathered, classified and aggregated 
includes complete medical history & social history, visit dates, vital signs, lab orders and results, 
medications, problems & diagnoses, and procedures.   
 
Epividian has developed rigor ous data management processes that include both automated 
and manual quality checks. Data quality methods include common techniques such as:  
·      Detection and reporting of outliers that lead to correction, acceptance, or exclusion 
of observations; these  can include a medical review.  
·      Detection of potentially missing data ( e.g.,  a patient taking ART medications with no 
history of HIV infection to determine whether the use was prophylactic or treatment for 
infection diagnosed elsewhere).  
·      Data completion using multiple observations and sources ( e.g.,  using diagnoses 
codes, free text, past medical history, etc. to determine if patient is naive to HIV 
therapy).  
·      Detection of observations that are known to be (or likely to be) mutually exclus ive 
for a patient ( e.g.,  record of medications that are typically not administered 
concurrently).

6. Study Design  
OVERVIEW  OF STUDY DESIGN  
The design for this study is an observational cohort study utilizing prospectively collected 
electronic medical record (EMR) data from usual clinical care at AHF Midtown Manhattan 
Healthcare Cente r, obtained from the OPERA® Observational Database.  
 
The study population will consist of adults vaccinated against SARS -CoV-2 virus receiving the 
Roche SARS -CoV-2 Semi -Quant Spike Ig AB test as  part of their  usual clinical  care . The se 
individuals will be followed from vaccination un til study end . 
 
EXPOSURES OF INTERES T 
Initial vaccination with Pfizer, Moderna, and J&J COVID vaccines, booster vaccination with 
Pfizer, Moderna, and J&J vaccines, and concordant boosting versus discordant boosting  
SUBGROUPS OF INTERES T 
HIV-positive versus HIV -negative patients , individuals with at least 2 measurements of antibody 
levels,  and boosted individuals are the subgroups of interest.  
STUDY ENDPOINTS  
Endpoints for both the primary and secondary objectives are non-responders and low 
responders and rates of decline of SARS -CoV-2 antibodies  
• Non -response will be defined as: 0 to <5 0 U/mL  
• Low response will be defined as:  ≥51 to ≤250 U/mL  
• Adequate response will be defined as:  >251 U/mL  
 
Roche’s Elecsys semi -quantitative spike Ab Ig assay is a commercially available  assay  that can 
potentially be utilized to help guide the need for an additional vaccination dose based upon the 
levels of antibodies that have been previously  clinically correl ated with neutralizing antibodies. 
As part of routine care, Ab Ig assays were performed for some patients at the AHF Midtown 
Manhattan Healthcare Center and results were recorded in their EHR.  
 
  Confidential  
   
To normalize across different neutralization assays utilized i n phase 3 studies of various COVID -
19 vaccines, Khoury, et al., estimated that  a 50% protective neutralization level equivalent to 
20% of the mean titer in the convalescent subjects equates to a measured in vitro 
neutralization titer of between 1:10 and 1: 30 was approximate d at 54 international units IU/ml 
(95% CI 30 –96 IU/ml)  against wild -type CoV -19 infection .xx  During the period of COVID -19 
infection where the Delta virus predominated, a quantitative spike Ab’s >250  IU/mL was 
deemed adequate,  based on studies that show that an antibody titer of 4-6x wild -type SARS -
CoV-2 were required to effectively neutralize Del ta viral strains .xxi,xxii, xxiii We thus utilized a 
threshold level of > 250 (5x wild -type ab levels)  IU/mL as an adequate vaccine response against 
circulating Delta virus post last vaccination recommended in a series, a level of  <50 IU/mL as a 
non-responsive  post vaccination titer (inadequate for even wild -type Co -V-2 infection) , and 
levels between (5 0-250 IU/mL) as a low vaccine response.  Non and low -responders who had 
Co-V-2 Spike Ig levels  that were inadequate based on the correlation of Spike Ig levels and 
neutralizing  ab correlations relative to the predominant circulating viral strains were offered 
optional booster vaccinations with subsequent antibody response measurement post 
vaccinati on as standard of care .  These recommendations are the current one’s implemented 
during the Delta C o-V-2 19 outbreak by the Ministry of Solidarity and Health of France and the  
COVID Guidelines group in Geneva , where 260 IU/mL and 300 IU/mL , respectively,  are 
considered gray zones of antibody protection against the Delta virus and where booster 
vaccinations are recommended for consideration .xxiv, xxv

7. Statistical Analysis  
ANALYSIS OF DEMOGRAP HICS/BASELINE CHARAC TERISTICS  
Demographic and clinical characteristics will be summarized  in the overall population  using 
medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) for continuous variables and frequencies with 
proportions for cat egorical variables.  
 
ANALYSIS OF PRIMARY OBJECTIVES  
Objective #1: COVID -19 vaccine non -response and low response as measured by antibody test by 
HIV status  
 
Records will be  examined retrospectively to determine which patients, both HIV -positive and 
negative, were non -responders, or who developed low or adequate quantitative Ig spike 
antibodies using the Roche Elecsys semi -quantitative spike Ab Ig assay  during usual clinical care .   
 
Demographic and clinical characteristics will be summarized by vaccine response level using 
medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) for continuous variables and frequencies with 
proportions for categorical variables. Statistical comparisons betwee n vaccine response level 
will be performed using Pearson’s chi -square or Fisher exact tests for categorical variables and 
Wilcoxon rank -sum test for continuous variables, using an adequate response as the 
comparator.  
 
Incidence rates and 95% confidence int ervals of COVID vaccine adequate response, non-
response and low response to COVID vaccines will be estimated using u nivariate Poisson  
regression . Incidence rates will be obtained both overall and by vaccine type. The incidence rate 
is defined as the number of events during follow -up divided by person -time at risk of the event.  
Estimating incidence rates with Poisson regression allows the use of all  person -time time at risk 
of the outcome, even with differential lengths of follow -up between groups.  
 
 
Objective #2: Rate of decline in antibody levels over time by HIV status, vaccine type, and 
baseline CD4 count after initial vaccination  
 
Rates and 95% confidence intervals of antibody levels  decay  will be estimated a mong 
individuals with at least two antibody measurements . Univariate linear regression, will be 
employed, using the continuous antibody level as the dependent variable, and timing of tests as 
  Confidential  
   
the dependent variable. Robust variance estimator will be used to account for repeated 
measures. Rates of decay will be produced overall , and stratified by HIV status, vaccine type 
and baseline CD4 cell count.  
 
ANALYSIS OF SECONDAR Y OBJECTIVES  
Objective #3: COVID -19 boosters given  
 
In the sub -population of Individuals who received a COVID vaccine booster, the following 
characteristics will be described using medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) for continuous 
variables and frequencies with pr oportions for categorical variables: initial and booster vaccine 
types, concordant vs. discordant boosters, duration between initial vaccine completion and 
booster dose, antibody response after the booster, and side effects recorded.  Post vaccination 
respo nses will be determined no earlier than 2 weeks post vaccination . 
 
 
Objective #4: Rate of decline in antibody levels over time by HIV status, booster type, and 
baseline CD4 count after booster vaccination  
 
Rates and 95% confidence intervals for changes in antibody levels will be estimated using linear 
regression , among individuals with at least two antibody measurements, including one after the 
booster dose. Univariate linear regression, will be employed, usi ng the continuous antibody 
level as the dependent variable, and timing of tests as the dependent variable. Robust variance 
estimator will be used to account for repeated measures. Rates of decay will be  produced 
overall, and stratified by HIV status, boost er type and baseline CD4 cell count.  
 
 
Objective #5: Recording breakthrough infections after vaccinations and assessing antibody 
levels pre -breakthrough infection  
Among all individuals with full vaccination and antibody testing , the EHR will be search ed for 
documentation  of COVID infection after vaccinations. If breakthrough infections are observed, 
antibody  levels prior to infection will be described. Note: COVID infections may not be recorded 
in the EHR if diagnosed outside of the clinic.

Informed consent has been waived for this non -interventional, observational research and 
authorization for use of the protected health information has been approved by Advarra IRB.  
DATA PRIVACY  & PERSONALLY  IDENTIFIABLE INFORM ATION (PII)  
The data used for this research study are not identifiable by the research staff. However, all 
data, even when stripped of identifiers, are handled and treated, in motion and at rest, as 
though the data could be id entified. All data are managed according to regulations including  
HIPAA and HITECH. These regulations and guidelines expand upon the ethical principles 
detailed in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.  These data are not shared outside the researchers 
involved  with the analysis.  
 
ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING 
There is no potential to collect individual level data on serious and non -serious adverse events 
(AEs), pregnancy exposures, device deficiencies and device related events or incidents related 
to any pharmaceutic al product during the conduct of this research, as the minimum criteria 
needed to report AEs, pregnancy exposures, device deficiencies and device related events and 
incidents are not collected. Specifically, the data are insufficient to establish attributi on 
between a potential safety event and an individual using a product as the study design is to 
analyze  deidentified, secondary data collected from individual medical records. Therefore, the 
obligation for reporting any and all adverse events lies with the  healthcare provider at the point 
of care.

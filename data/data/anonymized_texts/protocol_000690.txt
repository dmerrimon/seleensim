CONFIDENTIAL  Page 4 Study Design:  
This is a Phase 3, randomized study of zanubrutinib  versus ibrutinib in approximately 600 patients with 
relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymph oma (SLL).  The 
primary efficacy endpoint is overall response rate (ORR) determined by investigator assessment. While 
the primary efficacy endpoint is per investigator assessment, ORR per independent central review will 
also be analyzed to support the prim ary analysis. In the United States, ORR assessed by independent 
central review will be the basis for regulatory decisions.   Disease response will be assessed per the 
“modified” 2008 International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia guidelines ( Hallek M  et 
al 2008 ), with modification for treatment -related lymphocytosis ( Cheson et a l 2012 ) for patients with 
CLL ( Appendix  2), and per Lugano Classification for non -Hodgkin lymphoma ( Cheson  et al 2014 ) for 
patients with SLL ( Appendix  3).  Rate of response for partial response with lymphocytosis (PR -L) or 
higher will be assessed a s a secondary efficacy endpoint.  
The study is broken into three periods for every patient:  
• Screening Period ( Section  5.2) 
• Treatment Period ( Section  5.11) 
• Post-Treatment Period  
o End of Treatment Visit ( Section  5.12.1 ) 
o Long -Term Follow -up (Secti on 5.12.2 )  
o Survival Follow -up (Section  5.12.3 )  
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to one of the following treatment arms:  
• Arm A: Zanubrutinib 160 mg orally twice daily  
• Arm B: Ibrutinib 420 mg orally once daily  
Randomization will be stratified by age (< 65 years versus ≥ 65 years), geograp hic region (China 
versus non -China), refractory status (yes or no), and del17p/TP53 mutation status (present or absent).   
Treatment with zanubrutinib  and ibrutinib will be open label.  Study treatment will continue until 
disease progression, or any of the  events outlined in Section  6.7.  The study duration is estimated to be 
approximately 51 months (see Section  3.5). 
Study Assessments  
Assessments to be performed during the study include pharmacokinetics; disease -related constitutional 
symptoms; physical examination of liver, spleen, and lymph nodes; computed tomography (CT) scan 
of neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast; bone marrow examination at screening, for patients 
with baseline marrow involvement who meet clinical and laboratory criteria for CR or CRi and at time 
of suspected cyt openic progression; patient -reported outcomes (PRO; European quality of life 5 -
dimensions 5 -levels health questionnaire [EQ -5D-5L], European Organisation for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer quality of life cancer core questionnaire [EORTC QLQ - C30], and, in select 
countries, an optional device -based evaluation of quality of life and activity that patients may consent 
to); laboratory studies; bone marrow examination; genetic alterations in the tumor cells (eg, del 17p, 
del11q, 12q+ and immunoglobulin variab le region heavy chain (IGHV) mutation analysis).  
Patients should remain on study treatment until disease progression is confirmed by independent 
central review  (as described in Section  6.7). 
Assessments of safety will include adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), clinical 
laboratory tests, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, and vital signs ( Section  5.5).  Adverse 

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 5 events will be graded for severity per the current version of National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03  and the Grading Scale for Hematologic 
Toxicities in CLL Studies (see Section  8.1.1.1 ).  An independent Data Monitoring Committee will 
periodically monitor safety data and also perform the interim efficacy analysis.  
Efficacy ( Section  5.6) will be assessed locally by the investigator as well as by independent central 
review ( Section  10.3). Progression must be confirmed by independent central review ( Section  6.7). 
Key Eligibility Criteria:  
The patients to be included in this trial will have a confirmed diagnosis of CLL or SLL that meets the 
International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia criteria and requiring treatment as defined 
by at least 1 of the following: progressive marrow failure; massive, progressive, or symptomatic 
splenomegaly; massive, progressive, or symptomatic lymphadenopathy; progressive lymphocytosis 
with rapid doubling time;  or cons titutional symptoms.  Patients must be 18 years or older, relapsed or 
refractory to at least 1 prior systemic therapy for CLL/SLL, with the last dose of prior therapy for 
CLL/SLL > 14 days before randomization, and have measurable disease (defined as ≥ 1 l ymph node 
> 1.5 cm in longest diameter, and measurable in 2 perpendicular diameters or an extranodal lesion must 
measure > 10 mm in longest perpendicular diameter).  Note: A line of therapy is defined as completing 
at least 2 cycles of treatment  of standar d regimen according to current guidelines, or of an 
investigational regimen on a clinical trial.  Patients will have no history of prolymphocytic leukemia or 
Richter’s transformation, no currently active clinically significant cardiovascular disease, and n o HIV 
infection or active infection with hepatitis B or C.  
Test Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration:   
Zanubrutinib (160 mg twice daily) will be administered orally.  
Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration:   
Ibrutinib (420 mg once dail y) will be administered orally.  
Statistical Methods:  
Efficacy Analyses  
The primary analysis set for all efficacy analyses is the Intent -to-Treat Analysis Set (all patients 
randomized).  For the non -inferiority testing for the primary endpoint of ORR, the analysis will also be 
performed using the Per -protocol Analysis Set.  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis:  
The primary efficacy analysis of ORR (PR or higher, defined as CR/CR with incomplete bone marrow 
recovery + PR + nodular PR) will be conducted as assessed by the investigator, using the “modified” 
2008 International Worksh op on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia guidelines ( Hallek  Met al 2008 ), 
with modification for treatment -related lymphocytosis ( Cheson  et al 2012 ) for patients with CLL 
(Appendix  2) and per Lugano Classification for non -Hodgkin lymphoma ( Cheson  et al 2014 ) for 
patients with SLL ( Appendix  3). While the primary efficacy endpoint is per investigator a ssessment, 
ORR per independent central review will also be analyzed to support the primary analysis. In the 
United States, ORR assessed by independent central review will be the basis for regulatory decisions.  
The primary hypothesis testing for ORR is for non-inferiority.  The non-inferiority of zanubrutinib to 
ibrutinib will be tested for the Intent -to-Treat Analysis Set under the pre -specified margin of 0.8558 
(response ratio of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib).  The primary objective of the study is met if the  
non-inferiority is demonstrated.  The null and alternative hypotheses for testing ORR non -inferiority 
are as follows:  

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 6 • H0NI: Response Ratio (zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) ≤ 0.8558  
• HaNI: Response Ratio (zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) > 0.8558  
There will be 1 interim ana lysis approximately 12 months after 415 patients (69% information fraction) 
have been randomized.  The final analysis will occur approximately 12 months after 600 patients have 
been randomized.  Based on the assumption to randomize 600 patients in 24  month s, the final analysis 
is expected to occur 36 months after the study start.  
A Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test for response ratio adjusting for the 4 randomization stratification 
factors will be performed for hypothesis testing.  The Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel r esponse ratio will be 
estimated along with its 95% Wald confidence interval (CI).  Clopper -Pearson 95% CI will be 
calculated for ORR for each treatment group.  
If non -inferiority is demonstrated at either interim or final analysis, superiority of zanubrutin ib to 
ibrutinib will be tested next (Brannath et al 2003 ).  The monitoring boundaries for the non -inferiority 
and superiority tests are based on O’Brien Fleming type alpha spending function and depicted in 
Table  8 and Table  9. 
Justification of Non -inferiorit y Margin  
The non -inferiority margin was derived using the 95% -95% fixed margin method 
(FDA  Guidance  for Industry: Non -Inferiority Clinical Trials to Establish Effectiveness 2016 ).  The 
efficacy of ibrutinib (M1) in respo nse ratio scale was estimated as 2.1781 from the results of 
RESONATE and RESONATE2 trials by a fixed -effect meta -analysis.  Requiring 80% of M1 to be 
retained in zanubrutinib, a non -inferiority margin of 0.8558 is generated.  The margin is within the 
clinically acceptable limit.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses  
Key secondary efficacy endpoint  
If the primary objective of demonstrating non -inferiority of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib in ORR is met, the 
key secondary efficacy endpoint of progression -free survi val (PFS) by investigator assessment will be 
tested for non -inferiority under hierarchical testing to control study -wide type I error. There will be a 
single analysis of PFS when approximately 205 PFS events have occurred, and PFS will be 
summarized descri ptively at the time ORR is significant. While the key secondary efficacy endpoint is 
per investigator assessment, PFS per independent central review will also be analyzed to support the 
key secondary endpoint analysis. In the United States, PFS assessed by  independent central review will 
be used to support regulatory decisions.  
PFS will be compared between the 2 arms using a stratified log -rank test based on the 4 randomization 
stratification factors.  The non -inferiority margin for the test is 1.3319 in hazard ratio (HR; 
zanubrutinib/ibrutinib).  If the p -value from the stratified log -rank test for non -inferiority is significant, 
the non -inferiority of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib in PFS is demonstrated, and further testing of superiority 
will be performed.  The HR (zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) and its 95% CI will be estimated from a stratified 
Cox regression model.  The distribution of PFS, including median and other quartiles, and PFS rate at 
selected timepoints will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method fo r each arm.  
Other secondary efficacy endpoints:   
No hypothesis testing will be performed for other secondary efficacy endpoints.  
• The distribution of duration of response (DOR) by independent central review including median 
and other quartiles, will be esti mated using the Kaplan -Meier method for each treatment group.  
The same analysis will be performed for DOR by investigator assessment.  
• The HR for time to treatment failure and its 95% CI will be estimated from a stratified Cox 
regression using the 4 rando mization stratification factors.  Kaplan -Meier method will be used to 

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 7 estimate the distribution of time to treatment failure for each treatment group.  
• Rate of response for partial response with lymphocytosis  or higher by independent central review 
will be analyzed using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel response ratio along with its 95% Wald CI.  
Clopper -Pearson 95% CI for the estimate will be calculated for each treatment group.  
• Overall survival will be analyzed u sing the same methods employed for PFS by investigator 
assessment.  
• Patient -reported outcomes:  The EORTC QLQ -C30 questionnaire will be summarized for each 
assessment timepoint for each treatment group.  Change of EQ -5D-5L score will be summarized 
for each treatment group.  
Safety Analyses  
The Safety Analysis Set (all patients who received any dose of study drug) will be used for all safety 
analyses.  
Drug exposure will be summarized by treatment group, including duration, dosage, and dose intensity.   
All treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized.  Serious adverse events, deaths, treatment -emergent 
AEs ≥ Grade 3, study drug -related treatment -emergent AEs, treatment -emergent AEs that led to 
treatment discontinuation, and dose reductions or dose interruptions will be summarized.  
Sample Size Considerations  
The sample size calculation is based on the primary efficacy analyses for the primary endpoint of ORR.  
Assuming a response ratio (zanubrutinib arm/ibrutinib arm) of 1.03 (72%/70%), 600  patients will 
provide m ore than 90% power to demonstrate the non -inferiority of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib at the 
non-inferiority margin of 0.8558 (response ratio) and a 1 -sided alpha level of 0.025 when there is 1 
interim analysis at 69% information fraction (415 out of 600 pati ents).  The response rate for ibrutinib 
is approximated from published clinical data ( Byrd et al 2019 ).   
If the primary objective of non -inferiority of ORR is met, the study will continue until 205 PFS events 
have occu rred.  At a 1 -sided alpha of 0.025 and a non -inferiority margin of 1.3319 (HR), the power to 
demonstrate the non -inferiority of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib in PFS is 80%.  If the 600 patients are 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the 2 arms over a 24 -month period , including a 9 -month ramp -up period 
before reaching peak enrollment of 33 patients/month, with a 0.0017/month hazard rate for drop -out, 
205 events are expected to be accumulated at 45  months from study start.  A median PFS of 47  months 
for ibrutinib, an H R of 0.9, and an exponential distribution for PFS are also assumed.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17 1. INTRODUCTION   
1.1. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma   
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a mal ignant disorder of B lymphocytes.  It is the most 
common leukemia in the Western world with an incidence of 4.2 in every 100,000 persons per 
year.  The incidence increases to >  30 in 100,000 per year in people aged more than 80 years.  
The disease has a me dian age at diagnosis of 72 years (Eichhorst et al 2015 ). 
The World Health Organization classification considers CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma 
(SLL) to be different clinical manifestations of the same disea se (Swerdlow et al 2008 ); 
therefore, CLL and SLL are considered collectively.  CLL is a treatable but essentially incurable 
disease.  Diagnosis of CLL requires the presence of ≥ 5000 B lymphocytes/µL in the peripheral 
blood for at least 3 months with clonality of the circulating B lymphocytes confirmed by flow 
cytometry.  The leukemia cells are characteristically small, mature lymphocytes with a narrow 
border of cytoplasm and a dense nucleus lacking discernible nucleoli  and having partially 
aggregated chromatin.  Presence of a cytopenia caused by a typical marrow infiltrate defines the 
diagnosis of CLL regardless of the number of peripheral blood B lymphocytes or lymph node 
involvement.  Diagnosis of SLL requires the pre sence of lymphadenopathy and absence of 
cytopenia caused by a clonal marrow infiltrate.  The number of B lymphocytes in the peripheral 
blood should also not exceed 5000/µL for SLL.  CLL cells co -express the T -cell antigen CD5 
and B -cell surface antigens CD 19, CD20, and CD23.  The levels of surface immunoglobulin are 
characteristically low compared to those found on normal B cells, with each clone of leukemia 
cells restricted to expressing either kappa or lambda immunoglobulin light chains 
(Moreau  et al 1997 ; Ginaldi et al 1998 ; Hallek 2017 ). 
Genomic landscaping of CLL has revealed that the disease may often be initiated by the loss or 
addition o f large chromosomal elements, eg, deletion 13q (~ 55%), deletion 11q (~ 25%), or 
trisomy  12 (10% to 20%), followed by additional mutations that may render the leukemia more 
aggressive ( Landau et al 2015 ).  Deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del17p) are 
detected in 5% to 8% of chemotherapy -naïve patients and almost always include band 17p13 
where the tumor suppressor gene TP53 is located.  Patients with the del17p clone tend to show 
marked resistance against genotoxic chemotherapies that cannot be overcome by the addition of 
anti-CD20 antibodies ( Hallek M  et al 2010 ; Seiffert et al 2012 ).  In addition to these mutations, 
additional recurrently mutated genes and somatic copy number variations have also been 
identified including NOTCH1, MYD88, TP53, ATM, SF3B1, FBXW7, POT1, CHD2, RPS15, 
IKZF3, ZNF292, ZMYM3, ARID1A, and PTPN11 ( Landau et al 2015 ; Quesada et al 2011 ; 
Puente  et al 2011 ; Puente et al 2015 ). 
Survival of CLL cell s is dependent on a permissive microenvironment composed of 
macrophages, T  cells, or stromal follicular dendritic cells providing stimuli for activation of 
crucial survival and pro -proliferative signaling pathways in transformed cells 
(Tsukada  et al 2002 ; Pedersen et al 2002 ; Burger et al 2009 ; Hallek 2017 ).  This 
microenvironment produces chemokines, cytokines , and angiogenic factors that can interact with 
the leukemia cells, providing support for their survival ( Burger et al 2009 ; Chiorazzi et al 2005 ; 
Reinart  et al 2013 ; Hallek 2017 ). 

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 18 Staging of CLL is typically per either the modified Rai or Binet staging system.  Modified Rai 
defines low -risk disease as those with lymphocytosis with circulating leukemia cells and/or 
marrow involvement (lymphoid cells > 30%) (formerly Rai stage 0).  Patients with 
lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and/or hepatomegaly are categorized as 
intermediate -risk disease (formerly Rai stage I or II), whereas high -risk disease i ncludes patients 
with disease -related anemia (hemoglobin [Hgb] < 11 g/dL) and/or thrombocytopenia (platelet 
count < 100 x 109/L) (formerly Rai stage III and formerly Rai stage IV, respectively) 
(Rai et al 1975 ).  The Bi net staging system is based on the number of areas involved, ie, presence 
of enlarged lymph nodes, organomegaly, or whether there is anemia or thrombocytopenia.  Areas 
of involvement considered include head and neck (including Waldeyer ring), axillae, groi ns, 
spleen, and liver.  Binet defines stage A as Hgb  ≥ 10 g/dL, platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L, and up 
to 2 involved areas; stage B is Hgb ≥  10 g/dL, platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L, and organomegaly 
greater than that defined for stage A (3 or more areas of nod al or organ enlargement); stage C is 
Hgb < 10 g/dL and/or platelet count < 100 x 109/L (Binet et al 1981 ). 
Decision to initiate treatment for CLL/SLL is based upon the presence of progressive or 
active/symptomatic dise ase, eg, progressive marrow failure, massive or progressive 
splenomegaly and/or lymphadenopathy, worsening lymphocytosis with an increase of > 50% 
over a 2 -month period, lymphocyte doubling time of < 6 months, autoimmune complications that 
respond poorly t o corticosteroids or other standard therapies, and/or constitutional symptoms 
(Hallek  M et al 2008 ). 
Front -line CLL treatment for those without del17p or T P53 mutations may include combination 
fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab, or bendamustine and rituximab for the frail 
elderly patients, while for those with del17p or TP53 mutations, ibrutinib (Bruton tyrosine kinase 
[BTK] inhibitor) or idelalisi b (phosphatidyl inositol  3-kinase [Pi3K] delta inhibitor) plus 
rituximab should be considered.  For patients with impaired physical condition such as those 
with abnormal creatinine clearance and/or a low cumulative illness rating scale score but without 
del17p or TP53 mutations, treatment with chlorambucil + an anti -CD20 antibody such as 
obinutuzumab, or single -agent ibrutinib, may be considered.  For those with impaired physical 
condition who have del17p or TP53 mutations, single -agent ibrutinib, alemtuzum ab, high -dose 
rituximab, or ofatumumab would be the preferred treatment options ( Bauer et al 2012 ; 
Goede  et al 2015 ; Hillmen et al 2015 ; Hallek 2017 ; Robak et al 2010 ).   
Second -line treatment for refractory CLL, defined as disease relapse within 6 months after last 
treatment, or for disease that relapses within 3 years after first remission, may include ibrutinib, 
idelalisib plus rituximab, venetoclax (BH3 -mimetic designed to block the function of the Bcl -2 
protein) alone or in combination with an anti -CD20 antibody; alemtuzumab; fludarabine,  
cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (after bendamustine and rituximab) and vice versa; or 
lenalidomide.  For the suitable patient, allogeneic stem cell transplantation may also be offered.  
For patients who progress after 3 years from initial remission, the s ame first -line therapy may be 
administered again.  
1.2. B-cell Receptor Signaling   
B-cell receptor signaling is an important component for the survival of CLL cells, with 
continuous or repetitive B -cell receptor signaling capable of enabling the growth of CLL cells 
(Petlickovski  et al 2005 ; Stevenson et al 2011 ).  The B -cell receptor signaling in CLL ce lls is 

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 supported by different tyrosine kinases including BTK, spleen tyrosine kinase, ZAP70, Src 
family kinases, and Pi3K.  
Blockade of the B -cell receptor signaling cascade by inhibition of either BTK 
(Honigberg  et al 2010 ) or the delta isoform of Pi3K ( Zelenetz et al 2017 ) has been shown to 
induce profound inhibition of proliferative signaling from CLL cell -host interactions, resulting in 
frequent and durable responses i n patients with both previously untreated and relapsed/refractory 
(R/R) CLL.  While the use of Pi3K delta inhibitors is often limited by toxicities including 
hepatotoxicity, colitis, and infection complications, particularly when used in combination with 
other agents ( Zydelig® Summary of Product Characteristics ) and in previously untreated patients 
(Falchi  et al 2016 ), the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib has a highly favorable tolerability p rofile when 
compared to conventional therapies.   
1.2.1.  Ibrutinib   
Ibrutinib is a small -molecule inhibitor of BTK.  Nonclinical studies have demonstrated inhibition 
of malignant B -cell proliferation and survival by ibrutinib in vivo, as well as cell migration and 
substrate adhesion in vitro.  In patients with recurrent B -cell lymphoma, > 90% occupancy of the 
BTK active site in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was observed up to 24 hour s after 
ibrutinib doses of ≥ 2.5 mg/kg/day (≥  175 mg/day for average weight of 70 kg).   
In a Phase 1b/2 study of patients with R/R CLL (n = 85) where 51 patients received ibrutinib at a 
daily dose of 420 mg and 34 patients received ibrutinib at a daily do se of 840 mg, the overall 
response rate (ORR) was identical at 71% for both groups of patients.  An additional 20% and 
15% of patients had partial response (PR) with lymphocytosis (PR -L) in the 2 groups, 
respectively.  The responses observed were independe nt of clinical and genomic risk factors 
including del17p.  At 26 months, the estimated progression -free survival (PFS) rate was 75%, 
and the overall survival (OS) rate was 83% ( Byrd et al 2013 ).  In another Phase 1b/2 tr ial that 
evaluated the combination of ibrutinib with ofatumumab in patients with either R/R CLL/SLL, 
prolymphocytic leukemia, or Richter’s transformation who had failed at least 2 prior therapies, 
ORR for patients with CLL/SLL was 100%, with estimated 12 -month PFS of 89% 
(Jaglowski  et al 2015 ). 
In a Phase 3 study that compared ibrutinib to ofatumumab in patients with relapsed or refractory 
CLL (RESONATE), at median follow -up of 9.4 months, ibrutinib was found to significantly 
improve PFS compared to ofatumumab (ibrutinib: median duration not reac hed; ofatumumab: 
8.1 months; p < 0.001).  Ibrutinib also significantly improved OS, with an OS rate of 90% at 12 
months for ibrutinib versus 81% for ofatumumab (p = 0.005).  
Overall response rate, per independent central review, was 42.6% (PR: 42.6%) for ib rutinib 
versus 4% (PR: 4%) for ofatumumab; PR -L rate was 20% and 0% for the 2 treatment groups, 
respectively.  
Overall response rate, per investigator review, was 69.7% (complete response [CR]/complete 
response with incomplete bone marrow recovery [CRi]: 2% ; PR: 68%) for ibrutinib versus 
21.4% (CR/CRi: 1%; PR: 21%) for ofatumumab; PR -L rate was 15% and 2% for the 2  treatment 
groups, respectively.  
In another Phase 3 study (HELIOS) that compared 6 courses of bendamustine and rituximab in 
combination with eithe r ibrutinib or placebo (n = 578) in patients with R/R CLL, at a median 

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 follow -up of 17 months, PFS was significantly improved in the ibrutinib group (not reached) 
versus placebo (13.3 months) (p  < 0.0001) ( Chanan -Khan et al 2016 ). 
Ibrutinib is well tolerated compared with chemotherapeutic treatments for CLL.  In the Phase 3 
RESONATE study, Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions reported in ≥ 10% of patients treated 
with ibrutinib were diarrhea (4%), nausea (2%), stomat itis (1%), pyrexia (2%), upper respiratory 
tract infection (1%), pneumonia (10%), sinusitis (1%), urinary tract infection (4%), rash (3%), 
musculoskeletal pain (2%), arthralgia (1%), headache (1%), neutrophils decreased (23%), and 
platelets decreased (5%).   For the Phase 3 study comparing ibrutinib to chlorambucil in patients 
with CLL (RESONATE2), Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions reported in ≥ 10% of patients 
treated with ibrutinib were diarrhea (4%), stomatitis (1%), musculoskeletal pain (4%), arthralgi a 
(1%), rash (4%), skin infection (2%), pneumonia (8%), urinary tract infections (1%), peripheral 
edema (1%), hypertension (4%), and headache (1%).  Across clinical trials, Grade 3 or higher 
bleeding events occurred in up to 6% of patients treated with ibr utinib, with bleeding event of 
any grade including bruising and petechiae occurring in approximately 50% of patients.  Atrial 
fibrillation and atrial flutter occurred in 6% to 9% of patients treated with ibrutinib, particularly 
in patients with cardiac ris k factors, hypertension, acute infection, and a prior history of atrial 
fibrillation.  Other malignancies (3% to 16%) including non -skin carcinomas (1% to 4%) have 
been observed in patients on ibrutinib.  Tumor lysis syndrome has infrequently been reported  
with ibrutinib therapy.  Based on findings in animals, ibrutinib can cause fetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman ( Imbruvica® US Prescribing Information ). 
Ibrutinib is currently approved by the Uni ted States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 
treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma who have received at least 1 prior therapy, 
patients with CLL/SLL with or without 17p deletion, patients with Waldenström 
macroglobulinemia, patients with mar ginal zone lymphoma who have received at least 1 prior 
anti-CD20 based therapy, and patients with chronic graft versus host disease after failure of 1 or 
more lines of systemic therapy ( Imbruvica® US Prescrib ing Information ). 
1.2.2.  Zanubrutinib   
Zanubrutinib (also known as BGB -3111) is a potent, specific, and irreversible BTK inhibitor 
with a favorable pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic (PK)  profile.  Zanubrutinib is different 
from ibrutinib in the following ways:  
• Zanubrutinib is more selective in the relative inhibition of BTK versus off -target 
tyrosine kinases, including EGFR, FGR, FRK, HER2, HER4, ITK, JAK 3, LCK, and 
TEC, which may reduce  toxicities possibly due to off -target inhibition such as 
diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, bleeding, atrial fibrillation, rash, and fatigue;  
• Zanubrutinib has improved oral bioavailability;  
• Zanubrutinib displays significantly less inhibitory effect on rituxima b-induced 
antibody -dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity, and so is unlikely to adversely impact 
the anti -tumor effects of rituximab.  
1.2.2.1.  Nonclinical Data for Zanubrutinib   
Summaries o f nonclinical studies are provided below.  For more detailed information, please 
refer to the zanubrutinib Investigator’s Brochure ( BGB -3111 Investigator’s Brochure ). 

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 Zanubrutinib is a potent, specific, and irreversible BTK kinase inhibitor with a 50% maximum 
inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 0.3 nM.  Cellular assays confirm that zanubrutinib inhibits 
B-cell receptor aggregation -triggered BTK autophosphorylation, and blocks downstream 
phospholipase C gam ma 2 signaling in mantle cell lymphoma cell lines.  Zanubrutinib had an 
IC50 of 1.8 nM in a homogeneous time -resolved fluorescence -based BTKpY223 assay.  It 
potently and selectively inhibited cellular growth of several mantle cell lymphoma cell lines 
(REC -1, Mino, and JeKo -1) and the activated B -cell-type diffuse large B -cell lymphoma cell line 
TMD -8, with IC 50 values from 0.36  to 20 nM, while it was inactive in many other hematologic 
cancer cell lines.  
In vivo studies have demonstrated that zanubrutinib i nduces dose -dependent anti -tumor effects 
against REC -1 mantle cell lymphoma xenografts engrafted either subcutaneously or systemically 
in mice, which are significantly more effective than ibrutinib.  Zanubrutinib also demonstrated 
better anti -tumor activit y than ibrutinib in a TMD -8 diffuse large B -cell lymphoma subcutaneous 
xenograft model.  In a PK/pharmacodynamics study, oral administration of zanubrutinib resulted 
in time -dependent occupancy of BTK in blood and in spleen in mice and was approximately 
3-fold more potent than ibrutinib in mouse pharmacodynamic assays.  
In a panel of 342 human kinases, 1 µM zanubrutinib inhibited only 12 other kinases by >  70%.  
Zanubrutinib was more selective than ibrutinib for inhibition of kinase activity of BTK, EGFR, 
FGR, FRK, HER2, HER4, ITK, JAK3, LCK, and TEC.  Cellular assays also confirmed that 
zanubrutinib is significantly less active than ibrutinib in inhibiting ITK (10 -fold) and EGFR 
(> 6-fold).  Inhibition of ITK has been reported to reduce rituximab -induced an tibody -dependent 
cell-mediated cytotoxicity.  Zanubrutinib was shown to be at least 10 -fold weaker than ibrutinib 
in inhibiting rituximab -induced antibody -dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity, consistent with 
zanubrutinib being a more selective BTK inhibit or, with much weaker ITK inhibition activity 
than ibrutinib in both biochemical and cellular assays.  
The toxicity profiles of zanubrutinib have been well characterized in rats and dogs.  No specific 
safety concerns were identified in vital organs/systems including cardiovascular system, 
respiratory system, and central nervous systems.  No corrected QT interval (QTc) changes were 
noted in the conscious telemetry -implanted dogs over 24  hours after dosing up to 100 mg/kg, or 
in the repeat dose toxicity studie s in dogs over 91 days at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day.  No 
mortality or severe toxicity was noted in 91 -day repeat dose toxicity studies in both rats and dogs 
at doses up to 300 and 100  mg/kg, respectively.  Test article -related reversible histopathology 
changes were mainly noted in rats, including pancreas, spleen, prostate gland, cecum, colon, 
rectum, skin (lip and/or nose), and uterus.  None of the above findings were considered to be 
adverse in the 91 -day repeated dosing studies.  No genotoxicity was note d in the genotoxicity 
core battery studies.  
1.2.2.2.  Summary of Relevant Clinical Experience with Zanubrutinib   
Dose Selection for Zanubrutinib  
In the first -in-human, Phase 1 study, BGB -3111-AU-003, the PK of zanubrutinib was linear 
between 40 and 320 mg orally once daily ( BGB -3111 Investigator’s Brochure ).  The absorption 
of zanubrutinib is rapid with median time to maximum plasma concentr ation (C max) of 2 hours.  
The terminal elimination half -life is approximately 4 hours at 320  mg once daily.  Results from a 
food effect study showed that zanubrutinib exposure was not altered by a high -fat breakfast, and 

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 mean area under the plasma concentr ation time curve (AUC) and C max were increased by 12% 
and 51%, respectively, with standard breakfast when compared to fasting.  The magnitude of 
increase in exposure with food was well within doubling of exposure associated with 320 mg 
administered once a day in the ongoing Phase 1 study and was not associated with any new 
safety findings; therefore, zanubrutinib can be administered with or without food.  
Full occupancy of BTK in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was achieved in all patients in the 
BGB -3111 -AU-003 study, while occupancy in lymph node tissue was assessed only at 160 mg 
twice a day and 320 mg once a day ( Tam et al 2015 ).  At the 160 mg twice daily dose, full BTK 
occupancy was observed at trough, suggesting that  sustained target occupancy could be achieved 
in disease -originating tissues, thus more efficiently inhibiting BTK on a continuous basis, further 
preventing breakthrough signaling despite cycles of new BTK synthesis.  Activity has been 
observed across vari ous B -cell malignancies (including CLL, mantle cell lymphoma, 
Waldenström macroglobulinemia, and follicular lymphoma) at all tested dose levels; thus, a 
minimum effective dose cannot be established at this time.  Conversely, there is now extensive 
experien ce at the 160  mg twice daily and 320 mg once daily dose; both schedules show a high 
level of activity without compromise of the tolerability profile as compared to lower doses of 
zanubrutinib.  Therefore, the dose of 160  mg administered orally twice daily has been selected as 
the recommended Phase 3 dose based on sustained target occupancy, high rates of objective 
response in multiple types of B -cell malignancies, and a favorable safety and tolerability profile.  
Preliminary Efficacy and Safety Data for Z anubrutinib in CLL/SLL Patients  
As of 16 September 2018, 123 patients with CLL/SLL have been enrolled in the BGB -3111 -AU-
003 study (first -in-human, Phase 1).  Zanubrutinib was well tolerated, with 23.6% of patients 
reporting no drug -related adverse events (AE s) > Grade 2 severity.  The most frequent AEs of 
any attribution were contusion (54 patients; 43.9%), upper respiratory tract infection (36.6%), 
diarrhea (26.8%), cough (25.2%), headache (20.3%), and fatigue (18.7%).  There were 49 
patients (39.8%) that ex perienced at least one SAE, the most frequent included pneumonia 
(5.7%), febrile neutropenia (1.6%), neutropenia (1.6%), urinary tract infection (1.6%), lower 
respiratory tract infection (1.6%), arthralgia (1.6%), and cellulitis (1.6%). Of these SAEs, 18 
(14.6%) were assessed as possibly related to zanubrutinib. For more detailed information on the 
clinical experience for zanubrutinib please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure ( Zanubrutinib ). 
Efficacy for CLL/SLL patients from the BGB -3111 -AU-003 trial was last reported for a data cut 
of 31  March 2017 ( Seymour et al 2017 ). For the 66 patients evaluable for efficacy, after a 
median follow -up of 10.5 months (range, 2.2 to 26.8 months), the ORR was 94% (62/66), with 
partial response (PR) rate of 82% (54/66), partial response with lymphocytosis rate of 9% (6/66), 
and stable disease (SD) rate of 5% (3/66).  The response rate to zanubrutinib therapy in 
previously untreated pati ents (n = 16) was 100% (16/16 with 1 complete response [CR], 13 with 
PR and 1 with partial response with lymphocytosis).  
Clinical Pharmacology  
The QT interval prolongation potential of zanubrutinib was evaluated in healthy subjects in a 
thorough QT study ( BGB -3111 -106).  Results from this study demonstrated that single oral 
doses of zanubrutinib at a therapeutic dose of 160 mg and a supratherapeutic dose of 480 mg did 
not have a clinically relevant effect on electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, including QTc  

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 intervals and other ECG intervals.  Because of the short half -life and no accumulation seen upon 
multiple -dosing, these results are also applicable for steady -state conditions.  
Results from a dedicated drug -drug interaction study (BGB -3111 -104) indicate t hat 
coadministration of zanubrutinib with the strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inducer rifampin 
(600 mg every day for 8 days) decreased exposure of zanubrutinib by 13.5 -fold for AUC 
extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-∞), and 12.6 -fold for C max, in healthy subje cts.  Coadministration 
of zanubrutinib with the strong CYP3A inhibitor itraconazole (200 mg every day for 4  days) 
increased exposure of zanubrutinib by 3.8 -fold for AUC 0-∞, and 2.6 -fold for C max.  These results 
are consistent with the role for CYP3A isoenz ymes as the principal metabolic pathway for 
zanubrutinib.  
Additionally, a preliminary physiologically -based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was 
developed and was used to predict the effect of moderate CYP3A inhibitors and CYP3A 
inducers on the PK of zanubrutinib.  PBPK simulations suggest that coadministration of multiple 
doses of a moderate CYP3A inhibitor (eg, fluconazole, diltiazem and erythromycin) may 
increase the C max and AUC of zanubrutinib by approximately 2 -fold.  PBPK simulations suggest 
that a moderate CYP3A inducer (eg, efavirenz) may decrease the C max and AUC of zanubrutinib 
by approximately 2 to 3 -fold.  
A clinical drug -drug interaction study (BGB -3111 -108) was conducted to assess the effect of 
zanubrutinib on the PK of substrates of CYP3 A (midazolam), CYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 
(omeprazole), P -gp (digoxin), and BCRP (rosuvastatin) using a cocktail approach.  The results 
show that zanubrutinib does not significantly affect drugs metabolized by CYP2C9 (warfarin) or 
transported by BCRP (stat ins).  Zanubrutinib has a weak induction effect on CYP3A and 
CYP2C19 enzymes.  AUC from time 0 to the last measurable timepoint (AUC 0-t) and C max 
values were approximately 47% and 30% lower, respectively, when midazolam was 
coadministered with zanubrutinib.  AUC 0-t and C max values were approximately 36% and 20% 
lower, respectively, when omeprazole was coadministered with zanubrutinib. Repeated dosi ng of 
zanubrutinib increased exposure of digoxin (P -gp substrate) with a mean increase of 11% for 
AUC 0-t and 34% for C max. 
1.2.2.3.  Benefit -Risk Assessment   
As of 16 September 2018 , approx imately 1200  patients have received zanubrutinib in completed 
and ongoing clinical trials evaluating zanubrutinib either as monotherapy or in combination with 
another agent.  Available data for zanubrutinib in patients with CLL/SLL support a positive 
benef it-risk profile for the use of zanubrutinib as an investigational agent for treatment of 
CLL/SLL.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 3. STUDY DESIGN   
3.1. Summary of Study Design   
This is a Phase 3, randomized study of zanubrutinib versus ibrutinib in approximately 600 
patients with R/R CLL/SLL.  The primary efficacy endpoint is ORR determined by investigator 
assessment.  While the primary efficacy endpoint is per investigator assessment, ORR per 
independent central review will also be analyzed to support the primary ana lysis.  In the United 
States, ORR assessed by independent central review will be the basis for regulatory decisions.  
Disease response will be assessed per the “modified” 2008 International Workshop on Chronic 
Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) guidelines ( Hallek M  et al 2008 ) with modification for 
treatment -related lymphocytosis ( Cheson et al 2012 ) for patients with CLL ( Appendix  2), and 
per Lugano Classification for non -Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) ( Cheson  et al 2014)  for patients 
with SLL ( Appendix  3).  Rate of PR -L or higher will be assessed as a secondary efficacy 
endpoint considering the finding that treatment with BTK inhibitors may lead to lymphocytosis 
due to redistribution of leukemia cells from l ymphoid compartment to blood.   In these instances, 
treatment -related transient progressive lymphocytosis is not a sign of treatment failure or disease 
progression and has no bearing on treatment outcome ( Woyach  et al 2014 ).  
The study is broken into three periods for every patient:  
• Screening Period ( Section  5.2) 
• Treatment Period (Section  5.11) 
• Post-Treatment Period  
− End of Treatment Visit ( Section  5.12.1 ) 
− Long -Term Follow -up (Section  5.12.2 )  
− Survival Follow -up (Section  5.12.3 )  
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to one of the following treatment arms:  
• Arm A:  Zanubrutinib  160 mg orally twice daily  
• Arm B:  Ibrutinib 420 mg orally once daily  
Randomization will be stratified by age (<  65 years versus ≥  65 years), geographic region (China 
versus non -China), refractory status (yes or no), and del17p/TP53 mutation status (present or 
absent). For the purposes of stratification, refractor y disease is defined as either no objective 
response or disease progression within 6  months of the last CLL/SLL treatment, and relapsed 
disease is defined as patients whose disease relapses more than 6 months after the last CLL/SLL 
treatment and subsequent ly progressed.    
Treatment with zanubrutinib  and ibrutinib will be open label.  Study treatment will continue until 
disease progression, or any of the events outlined in Section  6.7. The study duration is estimated 
to be approximately 51 months (see Section  3.5).

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 Study  Assessments:  
The timing of all study assessments is described in Appendix  10. Assessments to be performed 
during the study include:  
• Pharmacokineti cs (Section  5.4) 
• Disease -related constitutional symptoms (Section  5.6.1 ) 
• Physical examination of liver, spleen, and lymph nodes (Section  5.6.2 ) 
• Computed tomography (CT) scan of neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast 
(see Section  5.6.3  for details)  
• Bone marrow examination at screening, for patients with baseline marrow 
involvement who meet clinical and laboratory criteria for CR or CRi, and at time of 
suspected cytopenic progression (see Section  5.6.4  for details)  
• Patient -reported outcomes (PROs) including the European quality of life 5 -
dimensions 5 -levels health questionnaire (EQ -5D-5L) and European Organisation for 
Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life cancer core questionnaire (EORTC 
QLQ -C30). In select countries there is also an optional device -based evaluation of 
quality of life and activity that patients may consent to (see Section  5.7). 
• Laboratory studies including hematology, serum chemistry, serum immunoglobulins, 
coagulation, hepatitis B and C, pregnancy, and HIV (See Sections 5.8) 
• Biomarkers blood and bone marrow samples to investigate genetic alterations in the 
tumor cells such as del17p, del11q, 12q+, and immunoglobulin variable region heavy 
chain (IGHV) mutation analysis as well as to measure potential resistance 
mechanisms for zanubrutinib (see Section  5.9) 
Patients should remain on study treatment until disease progression is confirmed by independent 
central review (as described in Section  6.7).   
Assessments of safety will in clude AEs, SAEs, clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, 
electrocardiogram (ECG), and vital signs (Section  5.5).  AEs will be graded for sever ity per 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( NCI-CTCAE) 
v4.03 and the Grading Scale for Hematologic Toxicities in CLL Studies (see Section  8.1.1.1 ).  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC) will periodically monitor safety data (see 
Section  10.2). 
Efficacy (Section  5.6) will be assessed locally by the investigator as well as by independent 
central review (Section  10.3). Progression must be confirmed by independent central review 
(Section  6.7).

Abbreviations: CLL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia; SLL, small lymphocytic lymphoma.  
Randomization will be stratified by age (<  65 years versus ≥  65 years), geographic region (China versus non -China), 
refractory status (yes or no), and del17p/TP53 mutation status (present versus absent).  
3.3. Blinding   
Treatment with zanubrutinib  and treatment with ibrutinib will be open label; however, the 
assessment of ORR by independent central review (primary endpoint) will be blinded.  
3.4. Study Rationale   
B-cell receptor signaling regulates multiple cellular processes, including proliferation, 
differentiation, apoptosis, and cell migration, and is essential for normal  B-cell development and 
survival ( Advani et al 2013 ).  It also plays an important role in survival of CLL cells.  BTK  has a 
relevant role in the signal transduction of B -cell receptor and can lead to downstream activati on 
of cell survival pathways such as NF -B and MAP kinases via the Src family kinases.  Ibrutinib, 
an FDA -approved first -generation BTK inhibitor that blocks B -cell receptor signaling in human 
B cells via specific active site occupancy, has been shown to b e efficacious and tolerated in the 
treatment of CLL/SLL.  
In the Phase 3 RESONATE study that compared ibrutinib to ofatumumab in patients with 
relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL, ORR (PR or higher) per independent central review was 42.6% 
(PR: 42.6%) for ibrut inib, whereas per investigator review, ORR was 69.7% (CR/CRi: 2%; PR: 
68%) for ibrutinib ( Byrd et al 2014 ).   Across ibrutinib clinical trials, Grade 3 or higher bleeding 
events occurred in up to 6% of patients treated wi th ibrutinib, with bleeding event of any grade 
including bruising and petechiae occurring in approximately 50% of patients.  Atrial fibrillation 
and atrial flutter occurred in 6% to 9% of patients treated with ibrutinib ( Imbruvica® U.S. 
Prescribing Information ). 
As of 31 March 2017, preliminary efficacy data from the Phase 1 BGB -3111 -AU-003 revealed a 
response rate per protocol definition (CR/CRi + PR + PR -L) of 92% for patients with R/R CLL, 

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28 with 2% CR (n = 1 ), 82% PR (n = 41), and 8% PR -L (n = 4).  Response rate for PR or higher 
was 84% in the R/R population.  
Treatment with zanubrutinib  has been well tolerated across all studies thus far.  Compared to 
ibrutinib, zanubrutinib  is more selective in the relative inhibition of BTK versus off -target 
tyrosine kinases, henceforth possibly leading to reduced toxicities due to off -target inhibition 
such as diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, bleed, atrial fibrillation, rash, and fatigue.  In study 
BGB -3111 -AU-003, there was 1 p atient among 69  evaluable patients who had experienced a 
Grade  3 or higher AE of petechiae/purpura/contusion.  In terms of Adverse Event of Interest, 
atrial fibrillation was reported in 1 patient (1%), an SAE of Grade 2 diarrhea in 1 patient, and an 
SAE of  purpura (subcutaneous hemorrhage) in 1 patient; none of which led to treatment 
discontinuation.  No event of Richter’s transformation has occurred.  
Based on the preliminary data from BGB -3111 -AU-003, the efficacy of zanubrutinib  in the 
treatment of CLL/SL L (PR or higher: 84%) is hypothesized to at least be non -inferior to ibrutinib 
(PR or higher [RESONATE]: 69.7% per investigator review; 42.6% per independent central 
review).  Preliminary safety data from the BGB -3111 -AU-003 study also revealed a tolerable  
and safe profile for zanubrutinib , with possibly a lower rate of Adverse Event of Interest such as 
atrial fibrillation and bleed when compared with ibrutinib.  In view of these findings, a Phase 3 
non-inferiority study comparing the efficacy of zanubrutin ib and ibrutinib measured by ORR, the 
primary endpoint, will be conducted.  
3.5. Duration of Study   
The total duration of this study is expected to be approximately 51 months based on assuming an 
expected enrollment duration of 24 months, and an estimated follow up of 27  months after the 
last patient is enrolled.  
3.5.1.  Study Drug Access at Study Closure   
Patients, who in the opinion of the investigator, continue to benefit from study treatment with 
either zanubrutinib or ibrutinib may continue treatment with zanubrutinib after study closure by 
enrolling in the Zanubrutinib Long -Term Extension Study.  This study is a  rollover study for 
patients who wish to continue receiving zanubrutinib, which will continue to be supplied until 
the patient progresses.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33 5. ENROLLMENT AND STUDY  PROCEDURES   
Study enrollment and procedures are summarized in the following subsections.  The timing of all 
study proced ures is provided in the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix  10).  
5.1. Study Visit Schedule   
Scheduled study visits are outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix  10). The study 
visit schedule is based around 28 -day cycles, with visits expected to occur in D1 of a given 
cycle. The length of a cycle should remain 28 -days regardless of any drug holds occurring during 
that cycle. Acceptable windows around these  visits are indicated in Appendix  10:  a visit window 
of ± 6 days (ie, 6 days before or after the given day) can be assumed for any cases not otherw ise 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix  10).  Study drug supply (Section  6.1.3 ) and 
dispensation (Section  6.1.4) must be taken into account when scheduling study visits.  
Procedures for a given visit may be split across the window to allow for drug resupply and 
completion of study procedures.  
5.2. Screening   
Before screening procedures are conducted, the patient must sign an informed consent form 
(ICF). Study site personnel must explain to potential study participants all aspects of the study, 
including all scheduled visits and activities. A co py of the ICF will be given to the patient to 
read, and the patient must have adequate time to understand the content and ask questions.  
Study site personnel must obtain signed informed consent before any study -specific procedures 
are conducted unless the procedures are part of routine standard of care, and must document the 
informed consent process in the patient’s clinical record.  Consent must be obtained using the 
most current version of the form approved by the Independent Ethics Committee (IEC).  
A pa tient may sign the informed consent form without starting the screening window; the 
screening window will start with the first protocol -required screening procedure.  
All screening procedures must be performed within the screening window (35 days), unless 
noted otherwise; assessments not completed within this interval must be repeated.  Repeating 
screening procedures or tests are allowed once if the patient did not previously meet the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria or if needed to have a documented result  within the 
protocol -specified screening window.  
For patients who provide informed consent and subsequently do not meet eligibility criteria or 
withdraw consent before randomization, study site personnel should document the screen failure 
in the patient’s source documents.  The documentation should include demographics and medical 
history, the reason for screen failure, the eligibility criteria reviewed, procedures performed, etc.  
Patients who provide informed consent and meet all eligibility criteria shoul d be randomized to 
the trial (Section  5.2.6 ).

Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 34 5.2.1.  Females of Childbearing Potential and Contraception   
A woman is considered of childbearing potential, ie, fertile, following menarche and until 
becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile.  Permanent sterilization methods include 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bila teral oophorectomy.  Contraception methods 
include the following:  
• Combined (estrogen - and progestogen - containing) hormonal contraception 
associated with the inhibition of ovulation  
− Oral, intravaginal, or transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception  associated with the inhibition of ovulation  
− Oral, injectable, implantable  
• An intrauterine device  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized partner (provided that the vasectomized partner is the sole sexual 
partner of t he woman of childbearing potential study participant and that the 
vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of surgical success)  
• Sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the 
entire period of risk associated w ith the study treatment, starting the day prior to first 
dose of study drug, for the duration of the study, and for ≥ 90 days after the last dose 
of zanubrutinib or ibrutinib.  Total sexual abstinence should only be used as a 
contraceptive method if it is in line with the patients’ usual and preferred lifestyle.  
Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), 
declaration of abstinence for the duration of exposure to investigational medicinal 
product, and withdrawal are  not acceptable methods of contraception.   
Of note, barrier contraception (including male and female condoms with or without spermicide) 
is not considered a highly effective method of contraception, and, if used, this method must be 
used in combination wi th another acceptable method listed above.  
If patient is using hormonal contraceptives such as birth control pills or devices, a barrier method 
of contraception (eg, condoms) must also be used.  
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical 
cause.  A high follicle -stimulating hormone level in the postmenopausal range may be used to 
confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal 
replacement therapy.  However, in the absence o f 12 months of amenorrhea, a single 
follicle -stimulating hormone measurement is insufficient.  
5.2.2.  Patient Numbering   
After obtaining informed consent, study site personnel will access  the Interactive Response 
Technology (IRT) system to assign a unique patient number to a potential study participant.  
Patient number will be assigned in chronological order by site starting with the lowest number.  

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 35 Once a patient number has been assigned to a patient, it cannot be re -assigned to any other 
patient.  
5.2.3.  Demographics   
Demographic factors such as age, gender, race, and ethnicity could influence the effects (safety 
and ef ficacy) of medicines and the risk/benefit assessment in different populations. Race and 
ethnicity data are collected in accordance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) 
guidance (ICH E5 1998, ICH E17 2017) adopted by the European Medicines Age ncy and US 
FDA, to understand whether race/ethnicity could influence the PK, safety, and/or efficacy of the 
study drug. For example, population PK analysis is a well -established, quantitative method that 
can quantify and explain the variability in drug con centrations among patients. Such variability 
can be attributed to intrinsic factors (eg, body weight, age, gender, race/ethnicity), or to extrinsic 
factors (eg, concomitant medications), and can lead to clinically relevant changes in drug 
concentrations th at require a change in the dose or dosing regimen. Results from race/ethnicity 
and other demographic analyses will be incorporated into drug product labeling to provide 
guidance on safety and efficacy variations (if any) linked to certain populations (eg, race or 
ethnic group) as well as any potential dose adjustment needed for those populations. Therefore, 
collecting race/ethnicity data in the study is essential to understand whether race/ethnicity could 
influence the PK, safety, and/or efficacy.  
5.2.4.  Medical a nd Cancer History   
Review all medical and cancer history after obtaining informed consent, including presence or 
absence of disease -related constitutional symptoms.  Clinically si gnificant medical history (ie, 
previous diagnoses, diseases, or surgeries) that does not pertain to the study indication, started 
before signing the informed consent, but considered relevant to the patient’s study eligibility will 
be collected and captured  in the electronic case report form (eCRF).  “Clinically significant” is 
defined as any event, diagnosis, or laboratory value requiring treatment or follow -up or the 
presence of signs or symptoms that require medical intervention.  Concurrent medical signs  and 
symptoms must be documented to establish baseline severities.  
Other background information to be collected includes history of disease (including the date of 
initial diagnosis and current disease status), staging, sites of disease, and presence or abs ence of 
disease -related constitutional symptoms.  Prior medications/significant non -drug therapies and 
demographic data (gender, year of birth [or age], and race/ethnicity) will also be collected.  
Record non -serious AEs during the screening period as medic al history.  
5.2.5.  Confirmation of Eligibility   
The investigator will assess and confirm the eligibility of each patient.  All screening procedure 
results and relevant medical history m ust be available before eligibility can be determined.  All 
inclusion criteria must be met, and none of the exclusion criteria may apply.  No eligibility 
waiver will be granted.  
After a patient is screened and the investigator determines the patient is eli gible for 
randomization, study site personnel will complete an Eligibility Authorization Packet and the 
medical monitor or designee will provide final approval for enrollment in writing.  Study site 

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 36 personnel should ensure that a medical monitor -approved E ligibility Authorization Packet is in 
the patient’s file before proceeding with study procedures.  
After a patient is randomized, refer to concomitant therapies (Section  7) and study drug 
discontinuation (Section  6.7) for guidance on a patient’s eligibility for treatment.  
5.2.6.  Enrollment/Randomization   
Study treatment should commence within 5 days after randomization, although small extensions 
to this due to drug supply logistics are permissible with Sp onsor approval. Interactive Response 
Technology  (IRT) will be used to randomize patients to treatment arm and to assign study drug 
as applicable (see Section  6.1.3 ).  
5.3. Study Drug Dispensation   
At visits where study drug dispensation occurs, study center personnel should ensure adequate 
drug supply for administration at home throu ghout the treatment phase as detailed in the 
pharmacy manual. Drug may be dispensed as frequently as once every 28 -day cycle, but may be 
modified to less frequently depending on supply considerations throughout the trial (consult the 
most recent pharmacy m anual).  
Study patients should be instructed to bring all drug bottles to their study visits, and drug 
accountability should be performed at each visit (see Section  6.1.4  and Section  5.6.1  for further 
detail).  
Additional drug dispensation visits may occur to ensure a patient has sufficient supply to 
maintain drug administration compliance as per protocol. The investigator is to instruct the 
patient to take the study drug exactly as prescribed and at approximately the same time each day 
of dosing.  Patients will be requested to bring their unused medicati on, and all empty bottles, to 
the center at each visit in order for the study staff to perform drug accountability.  All dosages 
prescribed and dispensed to the patient and all dose changes including reason for dose changes 
during the study must be recorde d on the appropriate eCRF.  
For dispensation of study drug provided by the sponsor, please ensure that the bottle number(s) 
listed in IRT matches what is being given to the patient.  
For drug that is locally procured, please ensure that the lot number dispen sed is being recorded 
on the accountability log.  
5.4. Pharmacokinetics   
Blood will be collected to characterize the PK of zanubrutinib . 
Sparse PK samples will be collected from all patients assigned to Arm A (zanubrutinib) only  at 
the timepoints as described in Appendix  10.  PK samp les will only be collected from sites that 
are able to adequately follow the sampling, handling and processing procedures outlined in the 
laboratory manual.  
The time of study drug administration and actual PK collection time on Cycle 1 Day 1 must be 
record ed on the eCRF.  The actual time each sample is collected will be captured to the nearest 
minute in the eCRF and recorded in the database.  

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 37 Blood samples (2 mL) for PK analysis will be collected into EDTA collection tubes.  Details 
concerning handling of th e PK plasma samples, including labeling and shipping instructions, will 
be provided in the laboratory manual for this study.   
Samples will be shipped to the designated bioanalytical lab for quantification of plasma 
zanubrutinib  concentrations using a validated method.  
5.5. Safety Assessments   
5.5.1.  Cardiac Function   
An assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction will be performed and documented at 
Screening and as medically indicated.  Note:  An echocardiogram, multigated acquisition, and 
gated heart pool scan are all acceptable.  
5.5.2.  Physical Examination and Vital Signs   
Physical examination, vital signs (sitting blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature), 
weight, and review for arrhythmia signs/symptoms (eg, shortness of breath, dizziness, or 
fainting) wil l be performed at each study visit during study treatment and at the End of 
Treatment Visit.  Height (cm) is determined at Screening only.  Assessment of vital signs and a 
focused physical examination on Cycle 1 Day 1 may be skipped if performed within the  last 7 
days.  
A complete physical examination includes an assessment of systems per standard of care at the 
study site and as clinically indicated by symptoms.  
5.5.3.  ECOG Performance Status   
ECOG performance status ( Appendix  6) will be assessed at the Screening visit, each visit during 
study treatment, and at the End of Treatment V isit.   
5.5.4.  Electrocardiogram   
A 12 -lead ECG will be performed locally in triplicate at screening for all subjects.  During study 
treatment, ECGs will be performed as specified per the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix  10).  
Subjects should be in the semi -recumbent or supine position.  
5.5.5.  Concomitant Medications Review   
Record any new medications, changes in ongoing medications or procedures, and medications 
discontinued within the screening window (see Section  5.2), and on study thereafter.  
5.5.6.  Adverse Events Review   
Record AEs that occurred during Screening on the medical history c ase report form and in the 
patient’s source document.  
Collect non -serious AE information from the time of first dose of study drug through End of 
Treatment Visit.  Information on all SAEs (regardless of relatedness) will be collected from the 
time of signi ng of informed consent through screen failure or End of Treatment.  The AE 
reporting period is defined in Section  8.4.1 . 

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 38 All treatment -related AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution or stabilization.  The 
accepted regulatory definition for an AE is provided in Section  8.1, and the defi nition of an SAE 
is provided in Section  8.2.1 .  Important additional requirements for reporting SAEs are explained 
in Section  8.  
In addition, arrhythmia signs/symptoms will be reviewed at every visit.  This will involve t he 
investigators asking subjects for signs and symp toms of ventricular dysfunction (eg, shortness of 
breath, dizziness, or fainting) as part of the routine AE monitoring for each visit.  
5.6. Efficacy Assessments   
Overall response to st udy treatment will be assessed at the timepoints outlined in Appendix  10. 
Overall response will be determined as follows:  
• CLL: IWCLL criteria ( Hallek M  et al 2008 ) with addition of treatment -related 
lymphocytosis ( Cheson et al 2012 ) for patients with CLL ( Appendix  2) 
• SLL: the Lugano Classification for NHL ( Cheson et al 2014 ) for patients with SLL 
using CT -based r esponse criteria ( Appendix  3) 
The primary endpoint of this trial is ORR. Assessments relevant to response assessment will be 
submitted to the centra l review vendor ( Section  10.3). Investigators will also assess overall 
response locally: refer to Appendix  2 and Appendix  3 for the individual assessments used to 
determine response and the guidelines on how to integrate them into a single overall response 
assessment for a given timepoint.  Confirmed, unequivocal pr ogression may require 
discontinuation of study treatment ( see Section  6.7).  
Assessments relevant to determining a patient’s overall response to st udy drug at a given time 
point are detailed below. Parameters relevant to response assessment may also include laboratory 
assessments as detailed in Section  5.8. 
An additional early response assessment visit to confirm overall response may be performed in 
addition regularly scheduled visits as indicated in Appendix  10. 
5.6.1.  Disease -Related Constitutional Symptoms   
Disease -related constitutional symptoms based on  IWCLL criteria ( Hallek M  et al 2008 ) 
(unexplained fever of ≥  38oC; unexplained, recurrent drenching night sweats; or unexplained loss 
of > 10% body weight within the previous 6 mo nths) will be evaluated as specified per the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix  10). 
5.6.2.  Physical Examination of Liver, Spleen, and Lymph Nodes   
Record presence and extent of hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and/or lymphadenopathy as 
specified per the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix  10).  PD assessed by physical examination 
must be confirmed by a CT scan.  
5.6.3.  Computed Tomography   
All patients must have baseline CT scan with contrast of neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and 
any other disease sites as specified in Appendix  10. 

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 All efforts will be made to ensure that the imaging equipment, contrast agent, and person 
(investigator or radiologist) performing the evaluation are kept constant throughout a patient’s 
course on study.   
An MRI may be used in place of CT only for patient s who have a contraindication to CT scans.  
If used, MRI should be performed of neck, abdomen, pelvis, and any other disease sites. In 
addition to the MRI, a non -contrast CT of the chest should be performed.  In Germany, an MRI 
may be used in place of CT fo r all patients but CT with contrast is still preferred.  
CT or MRI will be performed as specified per the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix  10), 
independent of possible study drug hold . 
All malignant lesions identified by imaging at baseline and meeting the following requirements 
will be recorded in the eCRF: lymph node > 1.5 cm in at least one dimension, or non -nodal 
lesion measuring at least 10 mm i n at least 1 dimension. Up to 6 of the lesions with bi -
dimensional measurements will be identified as ‘target’ lesions.  From the remaining measurable 
lesions, up to 6 Non -Index lesions may be selected and followed qualitatively throughout the 
course of th e study.  The remaining lesions, whether measurable or non -measurable, will be 
recorded as ‘non -target’ lesions.  For target lesions, measurements will be recorded in the eCRF 
at each imaging timepoint in 2 perpendicular dimensions: longest diameter (LDi) and short 
diameter (SDi).  LDi is the longest diameter, and SDi is the longest diameter perpendicular to 
LDi. Multiple non -target lesions co -located in the same anatomical region may be classified 
under a single non -target annotation. Examples of non -targe t lesions include:  
• Any measurable nodal disease beyond the maximum number of six  (6) target lesions  
• Extranodal disease beyond the maximum number of six (6) target lesions  
• Assessable disease  
• All bone lesions, irrespective of the modality used to assess them  
• Cutaneous lesions  
• Gastrointestinal disease  
• Spleen, liver, kidneys  
• Irradiated lesions  
• Groups of lesions that are small and numerous  
• Pleural/pericardial effusions and/or ascites  
At each imaging timepoint, lesions (nodal and nonnodal) recorded at baselin e should have their 
actual measurements recorded, even when very small (eg, 2  mm).  However, sometimes lesions 
become so faint on a scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact 
measurement and may report them as being “too small to  measure” (TSTM).  When this occurs, 
it should be indicated as “too small to measure” in the electronic data capture system  (EDC). If it 
is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be 
recorded as 0  mm. 
All CT scans and MRIs obtained during the study will be collected and reviewed by a central 
imaging vendor identified for this trial.  De -identified copies of all scans and radiology reports

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 (including those from Screening) must be provided to the sponsor o r designee (eg, central 
imaging vendor).  
5.6.4.  Bone Marrow Examination   
The schedule of required bone marrow examinations is given in Appendix  10. Details on these 
examinations and when they are required are given below:  
Bone Marrow Biopsy  
• In lieu of performing a bone marrow procedure, a site can submit any of the following 
from a previously performed diagnostic bone marrow biopsy if it is obtained within 
90 days before randomization:  
− an archival block  
− 15 unstained slides  
• At the time of potential CR or CRi.  
− Patients with baseline marrow involvement who meet clinical and laboratory 
criteria for CR or CRi, and need bone marrow examination to confirm CR or CRi. 
This should be collected within 40 days from the CT/MRI meeting the criteria of 
CR or CRi.  All the other clinical data should be within ± 14 days from the 
CT/MRI (ie, complete blood count [CBC] with differential and physical 
examination.  
▪ Patients who are otherwise complete responders but show bone marrow 
involvement preventing CR/CRi classification should recheck bone marrow 
at least once every 12 months until CR or CRi is confi rmed as long as the 
patient is still showing evidence of being CR or CRi outside of bone marrow 
results. Recheck may be done earlier than 12 months as clinically indicated  
• At time of suspected progression due to cytopenias.  
Bone Marrow Aspirate  
• At Screening, for patients with SLL, for biomarker purposes (see Section  5.9). This 
must be a fresh sample within the screening window.  
• At time of potenti al CR or CRi to confirm response (see guidance for bone marrow 
biopsy for timing) and for assessment of MRD. For assessment of MRD 
(see Section  5.9). 
• At time of suspected progression due to cytopenias.  
All bone marrow samples will be collected and reviewed by a pathologist from the central 
pathology laboratory.  
5.6.5.  Survival  Status   
Survival follow -up assessments may be conducted on an ad hoc basis for data analysis to 
monitor survival status for all patients in the study. The information may be confirmed via a 

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 phone call, medical records, or other methods.  Refer to the Schedule of As sessments 
(Appendix  10). 
5.7. Patient -Reported Outcomes   
Patients should complete the PROs per the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix  10) before study 
drug is administered and prior to performing any other procedures.  
5.7.1.  EQ-5D-5L  
The EQ -5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome 
(The EuroQol Group 1990 ; Herdman et al 2011 ).  Patients will self -rate the ir current state of 
mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression by choosing 1 of 5 
possible responses that record the level of severity (no problems, slight problems, moderate 
problems, severe problems, or extreme problem s) within each dimension.  The questionnaire also 
includes a visual analog scale to self -rate general health state on a scale from “the worst health 
you can imagine” to “the best health you can imagine.”  A sample questionnaire is provided in 
Appendix  7 as an example only.  
5.7.2.  EORTC QLQ -C30  
The EORTC QLQ -C30 is a questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer 
patients.   It is a copyrighted instrument, which has been translated and validated in over 100 
languages and is used in more than 3000 studies worldwide.  The EORTC QLQ -C30 includes 30 
separate questions (i tems) resulting in 5  functional scales (Physical Functioning, Role 
Functioning, Emotional Functioning, Cognitive Functioning, and Social Functioning), 1 Global 
Health Status scale, 3 symptom scales (Fatigue, Nausea and Vomiting, and Pain), and 6 single 
items (Dyspnea, Insomnia, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, and Financial Difficulties) 
(Fayers  et al 2001 ).  The recall period is 1 week (the past week).  The EORTC QLQ -C30 has 
been widely used among cancer patien ts in general and specifically in NHL patients.  It is a 
reliable and valid measure of PRO in cancer patients and takes about 11 minutes to administer.  
A sample questionnaire is provided in Appendix  8 as an example only.  
5.7.3.  Self-administered Activity and Quality of Life Evaluation (Optional)   
A self -administered, device -based quality of life questionnaire and activity tracker may be 
optionally consented to, per patient, in select countries. All evaluations will be self -administered 
via an application designed for select electronic mobile devices. Patients must be able to use th eir 
own applicable device (ie, a smartphone) and must have a compatible device in order to consent. 
Device requirements and application operation instructions will be specified in the optional 
consent form.  
The evaluations consist of two categories of dat a collection:  
• Elicited activity evaluations  
− Walk test: the patient will be asked to walk as far as they can for six minutes and 
data about distance and time will be collected.  

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 − Questionnaire: the patient will be asked to answer the questions outlined in 
Appendix  12. 
• Passive activity tracking  
− Activity data will be collected by the patient’s device in the background, 
including data such as steps taken and time active.  
Data from this optional evaluation will be stored separately from EDC. Since the questionnaire 
and activity tracking is self -administered and optional, site staff will not be held responsible for 
compliance. Feedback about patient compliance m ay be provided to sites in order for them to 
communicate with the patient about compliance.  
Administration and Schedule  
The site staff will invite the patient to participate during screening, after which the questionnaire 
and activity tasks will be self -administered and patients will enter data directly into the 
application on their mobile device without requiring site staff involvement. Patients will activate 
and conduct the first elicited evaluations any time during the Screening Period (preferred), or,  at 
the latest, on Cycle 1 Day 1 before study drug administration. The evaluations will occur as 
follows:  
Actively elicited evaluations  
• Weekly for the first 12 weeks  
• Monthly for up to 2 years.  
Passive activity tracking  
• Collected continuously in the backgro und after first use with no further action from 
the patient required  
Patients should attempt to complete the questionnaire and elicited activity tasks at roughly the 
same time and day each week or month, but may adjust their timing within a given time peri od 
as needed. Patients will be prompted by the application to remind them to conduct their weekly 
or monthly evaluation.  
5.8. Laboratory Assessments   
Laboratory assessments required d uring the trial are detailed below.  
Laboratory assessments will be performed at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Appendix  10) and may also be performed as medically necessary.  On Cycle 1 Day 
1 (day of first dose of study drug), laboratory assessments should be done before the first study 
drug administration. If local laboratories are being used, screening laboratory assessme nts 
performed within 72 hours of the first study drug administration do not need to be repeated in 
Cycle 1.  
Study Central Laboratories versus Local Laboratories  
If not otherwise specified below, laboratory assessments may be done at the study central 
labor atory or at the site’s local laboratory. The method used at baseline for a given patient should 
be used throughout the rest of the trial. For a specific visit, if there is an issue with that method 

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 the other method may be substituted (ie, if a patient was using central laboratories since baseline 
but on the most recent visit the sample is lost, the site can enter local laboratories into the EDC 
for that visit).   
If the study central laboratory is used, a detailed description of the procedures for sample 
collection, handling, storage, and shipment of the laboratory samples and all materials such as 
test tubes and labels is provided in the laboratory manual.  
If the study central laboratory is used, local laboratories may still be used for patient safety and 
monitoring. In these cases, a specific local laboratory only needs to be entered in the EDC if it is 
relevant to study actions or data (ie, if local labs are triggering a dose interruption, modification, 
or resulting in a reported adverse event). If the cen tral lab adequately reflects study actions and 
data, then there is no requirement to enter local labs into the EDC.  
Some blood samples will also be taken for biomarkers and submitted to the study central 
laboratory: please follow the guidance in Section  5.9. 
5.8.1.  Hematology   
CBC with differential includes hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, red blood cell count, and 
white blood cell count with differential (neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil, and 
basophil).  
5.8.2.  Serum Chemistry   
Serum chemistry includes sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate  (carbon dioxide, or if neither 
is available carbon dioxide combining power), glucose, blood urea nitrogen (or serum urea), 
creatinine, calcium, phosphate (or phosphorus), magnesium, total bilirubin, total protein, 
albumin, ALT, AST, lactate dehydrogenase,  and alkaline phosphatase.   
The following 2 chemistry tests will only be done at Screening and will be performed locally: 
direct antiglobulin test and β -2 microglobulin.  
5.8.3.  Serum Immunoglobulins   
Quantitative serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, and IgA) will be measured.  
5.8.4.  Coagulation   
The coagulation profile includes prothrombin time, which will also be reporte d as international 
normalized ratio, and activated partial thromboplastin time.  The coagulation profile will be 
performed at Screening only and as clinically indicated.  
5.8.5.  Hepatitis B and C testing   
Hepatitis B/C serologic markers and/or viral load will be tested at screening via study central 
laboratory.  
The hepatitis B testing includes HBsAg, HBcAb, and HBsAb, as well as HBV DNA by PCR if 
the patient is negative for HBsAg, but HBc Ab positive (regardless of HBsAb status).  The 
hepatitis C testing includes HCV antibody as well as HCV RNA by PCR if the patient is HCV

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 44 antibody positive.  Patients with positive HBsAg and/or detectable level of HBV DNA or 
detectable level of HCV RNA are not eligible.  
Patients who are HBsAg negative, HBcAb positive, and HBV DNA negative must undergo HBV 
DNA monitoring by PCR at least once on every cycle.  These patients should be considered for 
prophylactic antiviral treatment in consultation with a local  HBV expert.  If a patient is being 
treated prophylactically with antivirals, HBV DNA monitoring by PCR must be done at least 
every 90 days (every third cycle).  HBV DNA at screening or for monitoring may be done 
locally if local testing sensitivity is ade quate and after discussion with the medical monitor.  
If, during monthly monitoring of HBV DNA by PCR, the value is between 20 and <  100 IU/mL, 
then the HBV DNA by PCR should be rechecked within 2 weeks.  If the value is 100 IU/mL or 
greater, or at rechecked a detectable copy number, then study drug should be  stopped and 
antiviral therapy initiated or continued.  Resumption of study drug in patients whose HBV 
reactivation resolves should be discussed with, and approved by, the medical monitor and 
physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B.  
Patients pos itive for HCV antibody, but negative for HCV RNA, must undergo HCV RNA 
monitoring per cycle/every 4 weeks.  HCV RNA at screening or for monitoring may be done 
locally if local testing sensitivity is adequate and after discussion with the medical monitor.  
Patients with HCV RNA of 15 IU/mL or greater should stop study drug and antiviral therapy 
should be initiated.  Resumption of study drug in patients whose HCV reactivation resolves 
should be discussed with, and approved by, the medical monitor and physicia ns with expertise in 
managing hepatitis C.  
The medical monitor should be informed of any suspected hepatitis B or hepatitis C reactivation.

5.8.7.  HIV Testing   
Subjects with HIV infection are excluded from the study. HIV testing will be performed during 
Screening unless previous HIV tes t results from ≤ 4 weeks prior to Screening are available.  
5.9. Biomarkers   
Samples for biomarkers will be collected as indicated in Appendix  10. Details on these samples 
and when they are required are given below.  
5.9.1.  Del17p and Cytogenetics   
CLL /SLL is char acterized by various mutations shown to be linked to favorable prognosis 
(del13q and hypermutation of IGHV) or poor prognosis (del17p, del11q, unmutated IGHV, 
mutations in TP53, ATM, and Notch1).  
Screening blood samples will be used for the assessment of prognostic biomarkers including the 
assessment of chromosomal abnormalities (del17p, del11q, and the marker D13S319 on 
chromosome 13q, and to determine trisomy  12) by fluorescence in situ hybridization  (FISH) 
using a specialized central laboratory.  
Screeni ng bone marrow samples will also be collected for patients with SLL (Section  5.6.4 ), for 
central del17p FISH testing.  
5.9.2.  Flow Cytometry for MRD   
Blood and bone marrow samples (see Section  5.6.4 ) will be collected for the assessment of MRD 
by flow and molecular techniques as indicated in Appendix  10.   
5.9.3.  TP53 Mutation and Other Molecular Analysis   
Blood samples will also be collected for the assessment of the mutation status of relevant genes 
by molecular techniques including, but not limited to, TP53, IGHV, Notch, etc, as indicated in 
Appendix  10. Samples taken at progression leading to permanent study drug discontinuation will 
be used for the assessment of relevant BTK pathway genes f or specific mutations that have been 
identified as markers of resistance, including, but not limited to, mutations of the BTK and 
PLCγ2 genes.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 46 5.10. Unscheduled Visits   
Unscheduled visits may be performed at any time at the patient’s or investigator’s request and 
may include vital signs/focused physical examination; ECOG performance status; AE review; 
concomitant medications and procedures review; radiographic assessments ; physical 
examination of liver, spleen, and lymph nodes; disease -related constitutional symptoms; and 
hematology and chemistry laboratory assessments.  The date and reason for the unscheduled visit 
must be recorded in the source documentation.   
If an unscheduled visit is necessary to assess toxicity or for suspected disease progression, then 
diagnostic tests may be performed based on investigator assessment as appropriate, and the 
results of these tests should be entered on the unscheduled visit eCRF.  
5.11. Treatment Period   
The treatment period starts with the first day of assigned study treatment and ends 30 days 
following date of permanent study drug discontinuation (ie, 30 days a fter the final administered 
dose of zanubrutinib or ibrutinib )  
Patients may discontinue study drug treatment for any one of the reasons presented in 
Section  6.7. Patients that end treatment should move on to the End of Treatment Visit.  
Patients may voluntarily withdraw consent for treatment at any time.   
5.12. Post-Treatment Period   
5.12.1.  End of Treatment   
All patients who permanently discontinue study drug will have an End of Treatment Visit 
approximately 30  days after the last dose of study drug to collect A Es, including AEs that may 
have occurred or been ongoing after the patient discontinued study treatment.  The investigator 
or his/her designee will also continue to collect information on new anticancer therapy given 
after the last dose of study drug.  A l aboratory assessment is only required if the patient had an 
ongoing laboratory abnormality at the previous visit that the investigator considered to be related 
to study drug.  If the patient is unable to return to the clinic and no laboratory assessment is  
necessary, the investigator or his/her designee will contact the patient or guardian to collect this 
information.  Refer to the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix  10) for the assessments to be 
performed at the End of Treatment Visit.  This visit should signify the patient’s transition to 
Long -term Follow -up (if they have yet to progress) or Survival Follow -up (if they have already 
progressed).  
5.12.2.  Long -term Follow -up  
All patients who discontinue study drug treatment and have yet to have documented and 
confirmed progression by independent central review will remain in the study a nd subsequently 
commence Long -term Follow -up, which includes monitoring survival status, subsequent 
therapies for CLL/SLL, and overall response assessments (including radiographic imaging) to 
monitor for disease progression. Refer to the Schedule of Assess ments ( Appendix  10) for the 
assessments to be performed at the Long -term Follow -up Visits.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 47 If the patient refuses to return for these visits or is unable to do so, every effort should be made 
to contact him/her or the patient’s guardian by telephone to determine the patient’s disease status 
and survival.  
Patients who have documented and confirm ed progression by independent central review during 
Long -term Follow -up should move to Survival Follow -up. 
5.12.3.  Survival Follow -up  
Patients who have discontinued study treatment and h ave documented and confirmed 
progression by independent central review should enter Survival Follow -up, which consists of 
monitoring for survival status and subsequent therapies for CLL/SLL. There are no mandatory 
study visits during Survival Follow -up: in formation may be confirmed via a phone call, medical 
records, or other methods. Patients should continue in Survival Follow -up every 24 weeks ± 14 
days until the end of the study . 
5.13. End of Study   
Reasons for complete withdrawal from the study (including treatment and all follow -up visits) 
will occur under the following circumstances:  
• Patient withdrew consent  
• Death  
• Study termination by sponsor  
The patient may elect to withdraw from t he study for reasons other than those listed above - any 
other reasons need to be documented and explained in the eCRF.  Patients may voluntarily 
withdraw consent from the study at any time.  
5.14. Lost to Follow -up  
Every reasonable effort should be made to contact any patient lost to follow -up during the study 
to complete study -related assessments, record outstanding data, and retrieve study drug.   
Following unsuccessful telephone con tact, an effort to contact the patient by mail using a method 
that provides proof of receipt should be attempted.  Alternate contacts are permissible if the 
patient is not reachable (eg,  primary care providers, referring physician, relatives).  Such effort s 
should be documented in the patient’s source documents.   
If all efforts to establish contact fail, the patient will be considered lost to follow -up.   
5.15. Future Research (Optional)   
Patients may optionally consent to use leftover or unused samples collected during this study for 
additional, future research purposes. No additional samples will be taken for future research 
purposes.  
Future research may include evaluation of addition al potential biomarkers of response and 
resistance to zanubrutinib, which may be used to inform trials in other hematological indications.

Zanubrutinib  160 mg will be taken twice a day with or without food.  Patients will take 
zanubrutinib  with water at approximately the same time every day, with a mini mum of 8 hours 
between consecutive doses.  Zanubrutinib  capsules should not be opened, broken, or chewed at 
any time.  In case of dose reduction (See Section  6.5.1 ), the number of capsules taken at each 
administration will be reduced.  
Patients randomized to Arm A ( zanubrutinib ) should be instructed that if a dose of the study drug 
is not taken at the scheduled time, they should skip the study drug if  the time to next dose is 8 
hours or less and return to normal dosing with next dose.  If a patient vomits after taking the 
zanubrutinib capsules, that dose should not be repeated.  
On the days of PK blood sampling, study drug administration for patients as signed to Arm A 
(zanubrutinib ) will occur at the center after the pre -dose blood sampling has occurred under the 
supervision of the investigator or his/her designee.  The investigator or his/her designee must 
instruct the patient not to self -administer the  study drug prior to the office visit on those days.

The guidelines below should be followed for dose interruption or modification of zanubrutinib  or 
ibrutinib in the event of toxicities. The dose reduction guidance refe rs to an individual toxicity 
event (ie, successive thrombocytopenia events) and is not cumulative amongst different events of 
the same class (ie, a thrombocytopenia event followed by a neutropenia event).  
Assessment of the presence and severity of adverse events which may a trigger dose interruption 
and/or modification should follow the guidance in Section  8.1. 
Management of toxicities via methods not involving the interruption and modification of study 
drug is discussed in Section  6.6. 
If study drug is interrupted for > 28 days, written approval must be obtained from the medical 
monitor before study drug can be restarted (see Section  6.7). 
For surgery and procedure guidance see Section  6.4.1 . 
6.5.1.  Zanubrutinib

Local prescribing guidelines should be followed for dose reductions related to hematologic 
toxicity. An example of common local prescribing guidelines is  given here, but follow the local 
prescribing guidelines applicable to your country.  
Dosing will be held for individual patients under any of the following conditions, based on 
investigator assessment of study drug relatedness:  
• ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia with i nfection or fever  
• Grade 4 hematologic toxicities.   
Once the symptoms of the toxicity have resolved to Grade 1 or baseline, ibrutinib therapy may 
be re -initiated at the starting dose.  If the toxicity recurs, reduce dose by 1 dose level (280 mg 
orally once  daily).  A second dose reduction to dose level -2 (140 mg orally once daily) may be 
considered as needed.  If these toxicities persist or recur following 2 dose reductions, discontinue 
ibrutinib.  
6.5.2.2.  Ibrutinib Dose Reduction for Non -Hematologic Toxicity   
Local prescribing guidelines should be followed for dose reductions related to non -hematologic 
toxicity. An example of common local prescribing guidelines is given here, but follow th e local 
prescribing guidelines applicable to your country.  
Ibrutinib should be interrupted for ≥ Grade 3 non -hematologic toxicities.  
For patients with mild hepatic impairment, please follow local prescribing guidelines.

experts specializing in cardiology for management of atrial fibrillation), and individual 
institutional guidelines o r policies.  
6.7. Discontinuation from Study Treatment   
Patients should discontinue study treatment for the following:  
• Withdrawal from the study (see Section  5.13).  
• Pregnancy  
• The investigator or sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the patient  
• Intercurrent illness that compromises the patient’s ability to participate in the study  
• Unequivocal disease progression  
− Patients should remain on study treatment until disease progression is confirmed 
by independent central review.

7.1. Concomitant Therapy   
All concomitant medications  and herbal supplements taken during the study will be recorded in 
the eCRF with indication, dose information, and dates of administration.   
Patients with high tumor burden should be monitored closely, and prophylactic measures, 
including allopurinol or r asburicase, may be instituted per institutional standards for tumor lysis 
syndrome.  
7.1.1.  Permitted Medications   
The following treatments are allowed:  
• Blood product transfusion and grow th factor support per standard of care and 
institutional guidelines  
• Corticosteroids for non -CLL/SLL indications with the following restrictions:  
Patients should not receive treatment with systemic corticosteroids other than 
intermittently to control or pre vent infusion reactions, or for short durations (< 2 
weeks) to treat non -CLL/SLL -related conditions (eg, to treat a flare of chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease).  Chronic systemic corticosteroid use is not permitted, 
except for adrenal replacement.  
• Ther apy to reduce symptoms per standard of care and institutional guidelines  
Tumor lysis syndrome has been  infrequently reported with zanubrutinib  and ibrutinib treatment. 
Patients with high tumor burden should be monitored closely, and prophylactic measures, 
including allopurinol or rasburicase, may be instituted per institutional standards.  
Patients with hematologic malignancies, particularly those having received prior 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy or having prolonged corticosteroid exposure, are pre -disposed  to 
opportunistic infections as a result of disease and treatment -related factors. In patients with a 
high risk for opportunistic infections, including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia  (PJP), 
prophylaxis should be considered as per institutional standards. Otherwise for other infection 
prophylaxis should be as per institutional standards.  
7.1.2.  Prohibited Medications   
Patients should not receive other anticancer therapy (including but not restricted to 
chemotherapy, immunotherapy, corticosteroids for treatment of CLL, experimental therapy, 
radiotherapy, and herbal medications) during screening or while on treatment in  this study.  
Other anticancer therapies should not be administered until disease progression (as per clinical 
practice standards at the study center), un -manageable toxicity, or no further clinical benefit 
occurs, which requires permanent discontinuation of the study drug.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 59 7.2. Potential Interactions Between the Study Drugs and Concomitant 
Medications   
7.2.1.  CYP -Inhibiting/Inducing Drugs   
7.2.1.1.  Zanubrutinib   
Zanubrutinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A (Section  1.2.2.2 ).  Administration of 
zanubrutinib with strong/moderate CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers (refer to Appendi x 5 
for a list of  these medications) and grapefruit juice and Seville oranges should be used with 
caution as they may affect the metabolism of zanubrutinib. If at all possible, patients are 
encouraged not to use strong/moderate CYP3A inhibitors and inducers and consider us ing 
alternative agents. If these agents will be used, follow the dose modification table in 
Table  4.  The medical monitor should be consulted in these situations. Please refer to Appendix  5 
and http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main -table/ for a more complete list.  
A clinical drug -drug interaction study indicated that zanubrutinib is a mild inducer of CYP3A4 
and CYP2C19 (Section  1.2.2.2 ). Narrow therapeutic index drugs that are metabolized by 
CYP3A4 (alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, 
quinidine, sirolimus and tacrolimus), and CYP2C19 (eg, s -mephenytoin) should be used with 
caution, as zanubrutinib may decrease the plasma exposures of these drugs.   
Because ethinylestradiol (a key ingredient in a variety of combined oral contraceptives) is partly 
metabolized by CYP3A4, patients using hormonal contraceptives (eg, birth control pills or 
devices) must use a barrier method of contraception (eg, condoms) as well (see Section  4.1). 
Repeated dosing  of zanubrutinib increased exposure of digoxin (P -gp substrate) with a mean 
increase of 11% for AUC 0-t and 34% for C max (Section  1.2.2.2 ).  The coadministration of oral 
P-gp substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (eg, digoxin) should be used with caution as 
zanubrutinib may increase their concentrations.  
7.2.1.2.  Ibrutinib   
Local prescribing guidelines should be followed for guidance on drug interactions and 
contraindications when using ibrutinib . An example of common local prescribing guidelines for 
use of i brutinib with CYP3A Inhibitors  is given in Table  6, Section  6.5.2.3 , but follow the local 
prescribing guidelines applicable to your country.  
Coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (see Appendix  5 and Table  6, 
Section  6.5.2.3 ) with ibrutinib  may lead to increased ibrutinib exposure and, consequently, a 
higher risk for toxicity.  On the contrary, coadministration of CYP3A4 inducers may lead to 
decreased ibrutinib  exposure and, consequen tly, a risk for lack of efficacy.  Therefore, 
concomitant use of ibrutinib  with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers should be 
avoided.  
Do not take ibrutinib  with grapefruit or Seville oranges (bitter oranges) - this includes eating 
them, drinkin g the juice, or taking a supplement that might contain them.  This is because it can 
increase the amount of ibrutinib  in the blood.  Refer to Appendix  5 for examples of strong and 
moderate CYP3A inhibitors and CYP3A inducers.  
Agents that may have their plasma concentrations altered by ibrutinib  

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 60 Ibrutinib is a P -gp and breast cancer resistanc e protein (BCRP) inhibitor in vitro. As no clinical 
data are available on this interaction, it cannot be excluded that ibrutinib could inhibit intestinal 
P-gp and BCRP after a therapeutic dose. To minimize the potential for an interaction in the GI 
tract, oral narrow therapeutic range, P -gp or BCRP substrates such as digoxin or methotrexate 
should be taken at least 6 hours before or after ibrutinib. Ibrutinib may also inhibit BCRP in the 
liver and increase the exposure of medicinal products that undergo BCR P-mediated hepatic 
efflux, such as rosuvastatin.  
Based on in vitro data, ibrutinib is a weak reversible inhibitor towards CYP3A4 at the intestinal 
level and may therefore increase the exposure to CYP3A4 substrates sensitive to gut CYP3A 
metabolism. No clin ical data are available on this interaction. Caution should be exercised if 
coadministering ibrutinib with CYP3A4 substrates administered orally with narrow therapeutic 
range (such as dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, cyclosporine, sirolimus and tac rolimus).  
Based on in vitro data, ibrutinib is a weak CYP2B6 inducer and may have the potential to affect 
the expression of other enzymes and transporters regulated via the constitutive androstane 
receptor (CAR), eg, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, UGT1A1 and MRP2. The c linical relevance is not 
known, but the exposure to substrates of CYP2B6 (such as efavirenz and bupropion) and of 
co-regulated enzymes may be reduced upon coadministration with ibrutinib.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 61 8. SAFETY MONITORING AN D REPORTING   
The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria 
and definition of an AE or SAE as provided in this protocol.  
8.1. Adverse Events   
8.1.1.  Definitions and Reporting   
An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study 
drug, whether considered related to study drug or not.  
Examples of an AE include:  
• Worsening of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including an increase in 
severity, fr equency, duration, and/or has an association with a significantly worse 
outcome  
• New condition detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae  of a suspected interaction  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study drug 
or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE or SAE)  
When an AE or SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the  investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory results, and diagnostics reports) related to 
the AE or SAE.  The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE or 
SAE in the eCRF.  However, there m ay be instances when copies of medical records for certain 
cases are requested by the sponsor.  In these instances, all patient identifiers will be blinded on 
the copies of the medical records prior to submission to the sponsor.  
8.1.1.1.  Assessment of Severity   
The investigator will assess the severity for each AE and SAE reported during the study.  When 
applicable, AEs and SAEs should be assessed and graded based upon the NCI -CTCAE v4.03. 
Patients with CLL may have low blood counts at initiation of therapy so assessment of AE 
severity for hematologic toxicity should be based on the Grading Scale for Hematologic Toxicity 
in CLL Studies ( Appendix  9). 
Toxicities that are not specified in the NCI -CTCAE will follow general NCI -CTCAE guidance 
as follows:  
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only;  intervention not indicated  
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local, or non -invasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 62 • Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospital ization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -
care activities of daily living  
• Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
• Grade 5: Death related to AE  
NOTE: The terms “severe” and “serious” are not  synonymous.  Severity is a measure of intensity 
(for example, grade of a specific AE, mild [Grade 1], moderate [Grade 2], severe [Grade 3], or 
life-threatening [Grade 4]), whereas seriousness is classified by the criteria based on the 
regulatory definitio ns.  Seriousness serves as the guide for defining regulatory reporting 
obligations from the sponsor to applicable regulatory authorities as described in Section  8.2. 
8.1.1.2.  Assessment of Causality   
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the study drug and the occurrence 
of each AE or SAE.  The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other 
risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the AE or SAE to the study drug will be considered 
and investigated.  The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure and/or 
Prescribing Information, for marketed products, in the determination of his/her assessment.  
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the investigator has mi nimal information 
to include in the initial report to the sponsor.  However, it is very important that the investigator 
always makes an assessment of causality for every SAE prior to transmission of the SAE report 
to the sponsor since the causality assessm ent is one of the criteria used when determining 
regulatory reporting requirements.  The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality 
considering follow -up information, amending the SAE report accordingly.  
The causality of each AE should be assesse d and classified by the investigator as “related” or 
“not related.”  An AE is considered related if there is “a reasonable possibility” that the AE may 
have been caused by the study drug (ie, there are facts, evidence, or arguments to suggest 
possible caus ation).  A number of factors should be considered in making this assessment, 
including:  
• Temporal relationship of the AE to the administration of study treatment/study 
procedure  
• Whether an alternative etiology has been identified  
• Mechanism of action of the study drug  
• Biological plausibility  
• An AE should be considered “related” to study drug if any of the following are met, 
otherwise the event should be assessed as not related:  
− There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contr ibuting factors can be ruled out.  

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 63 − There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely.  
− There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (eg, the AE occurred 
within a reasonable time after administration  of the study drug).  However, the 
influence of other factors may have contributed to the AE (eg, the patient’s 
clinical condition or other concomitant AEs).  
8.1.1.3.  Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events   
After the initial AE or SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each patient 
and provide further information to the sponsor on the patient’s condition.  
All AEs and SAEs documented at a previous visi t/contact and designated as ongoing will be 
reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts.  
All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, the condition stabilizes or is considered 
chronic, the AE or SAE is otherwise explained, the patient is lost to follow -up, or the patient 
withdraws consent.  Once resolved, the appropriate AE or SAE eCRF page(s) will be updated.  
The investigator will ensure that follow -up includes any supplemental investigations as may be 
indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE.  This may include additional 
laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other 
health care professionals.  
The sponsor may request that the investigator perform or arrange for the conduct of sup plemental 
measurements and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of 
the AE or SAE.  The investigator is obligated to assist.  If a patient dies during participation in 
the study or during a recognized follow -up period , the sponsor will be provided with a copy of 
any postmortem findings, including histopathology.  
New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed SAE report/eCRF, 
with all changes signed and dated by the investigator.  The updated SA E report/eCRF should be 
re-sent to the sponsor within the time frames outlined in Section  8.6.1 . 
8.1.2.  Laboratory Test Abnormalities   
Abnormal laboratory findings (eg, chemistry, CBC, coagulation) or other abnormal assessments 
(ECG, radiographical studies, and vital signs) that are judged by the investigator as clinically 
signific ant will be recorded as AEs or SAEs.  This includes clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are present at baseline and significantly 
worsen during the study.  However, clinically significant abnormal laborato ry findings or other 
abnormal assessments that are present at the start of the study and do not worsen will not be 
reported as AEs or SAEs.  The definition of clinically significant is left to the judgment of the 
investigator; in general, these are events that result in clinical signs or symptoms, require active 
medical intervention, or lead to dose interruption or discontinuation. Laboratory events 
indicating liver or renal dysfunction should be considered clinically significant.  
For hematologic toxicities , refer to the Grading Scale for Hematologic Toxicity in CLL Studies 
(Appendix  9). 
Asymptomatic treatment -related lymphocytosis should not be consid ered an AE.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 64 For information on procedures for the monitoring and prevention of hepatitis B and hepatitis C, 
see Section  5.8.5 . 
8.1.3.  Lack of Efficacy   
“Lack of efficacy” will not be reported as an AE.  The signs and symptoms or clinical sequelae 
resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfill the AE or SAE definition (including 
clarifications).  
8.2. Serious Adverse Events   
8.2.1.  Definitions   
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
NOTE:  the term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an AE in 
which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the AE; it does not refer to an AE, 
which hypothetically might have caused death, if it was more severe.  
• Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
NOTE:  In general, hos pitalization signifies that the patient was admitted (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) to the hospital or emergency ward for 
observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s 
office or outpatient setting.   
• Results in disability/incapacity  
NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance, such as unco mplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle), which may 
interfere or prevent everyday life functions, but do not constitute a substantial 
disruption.  
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is considered a significant medical AE by the investigator based on medical judgment 
(eg, may jeopardize the patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above)  
The following are NOT  considered SAEs:  
• Hospitalizatio n for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen 
from baseline  
• Hospitalization for social/convenience considerations  
• Scheduled therapy for the target disease of the study, including admissions for 
transfusion support or convenience

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 65 8.3. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction   
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) is a serious adverse reaction that is 
both unexpected (ie, not present in th e product’s Reference Safety Information) and meets the 
definition of a serious adverse drug reaction (SADR), the specificity or severity of which is not 
consistent with those noted in the current protocol and/or Investigator’s Brochure.  
8.4. Timing, Frequency , and Method of Capturing Adverse Events and 
Serious Adverse Events   
8.4.1.  Adverse Event Reporting Period   
After informed consent has been signed but prior to the administration of the study drug, only 
SAEs should be reported.   
After initiation of study drug, all AEs and SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be 
reported until 30 days after the l ast dose of study drugs.  
Beyond 30 days after the last dose of study drug the investigator should report any SAEs that are 
believed to be related to prior study drug treatment.  SAEs that are not considered related to 
study treatment do not need to be repo rted and are not subject to the reporting requirements 
outlined in Section  8.6, but these SAEs should still be recorded in the EDC (see Section  11.2.6 ) 
per the guidelines outlined in Sections 8.1.1  and 8.2. 
8.4.2.  Eliciting Adverse Events   
The investigator or designee will ask about AEs by asking the following standard questions:  
• How are you feeling?  
• Have you had any medical problems since your last visit?  
• Have you taken any new medicines since your last visit?  
8.5. Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse Events and Serious 
Adverse Events   
8.5.1.  Disease Progression   
Disease progression (including fatal disease progression), which is expected in this study 
population and measured as an efficacy endpoint, should not be reported as an AE term.   Instead, 
the symptoms, signs or clinical sequelae that result from disease pr ogression should be reported 
as the AE term(s).  Adverse events secondary to disease progression should be clearly indicated 
as such.  For instance, a patient presents with pleural effusion resulting from disease progression 
of metastasis to lungs.  The AE  term should be reported as “pleural effusion” instead of disease 
progression.  If a patient experiences a fatal multi -organ failure due to disease progression, the 
term “multi -organ failure” should be reported as the SAE with death as outcome instead of 
reporting “fatal disease progression” or “death due to disease progression”.     
If there is any uncertainty regarding whether an AE is due to disease progression, it should be 
reported as an AE.  

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 66 8.5.2.  Death   
Death is an outcome and not usually considered an event.  If the only information available is 
death and the cause of death is unknown, then the death is reported as an event, eg, “death,” 
“death of unknown cause,” or “death unexplai ned.”  
8.6. Prompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events   
8.6.1.  Time Frames for Submitting Serious Adverse Events   
SAEs will be reported promptly (within 24 hours of first knowledge of the SAE) to the sponsor 
or designee as described once the investigator determines that the AE meets the protocol 
definition of an SAE.

Completion and Transmission of the Serious Adverse Event Report  
Once an investigator becomes aware that an SAE has occurred in a patient, he/she will report the 
information to the sponsor within 24 hours .  The SAE report will always be completed as 
thoroughly as possible with all available details of the SAE and forwarded t o the sponsor within 
the designated time frames.  If the investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, 
he/she will not wait to receive additional information before notifying the sponsor of the event 
and completing the form.  The form will b e updated when additional information is received.  
The investigator will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial report as 
described in Section  8.1.1.2 . 
The sponsor will provide a list of study contacts for SAE receipt.  
8.6.2.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events   
The investigator will promptly report all SAEs to the sponsor in accordance with the procedures 
detailed in Section  8.6.1   The spon sor has a legal responsibility to notify, as appropriate, both the 
local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under 
clinical investigation.  Prompt notification of SAEs by the investigator to the appropriate proj ect 
contact for SAE receipt is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities toward 
the safety of other patients are met.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 67 The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, will comply with the 
applicable local regu latory requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to regulatory authorities 
and the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/IEC.  
Expedited investigator safety reports are prepared according to the sponsor’s policy and are 
forwarded to investigators as necessar y.  The purpose of the report is to fulfill specific regulatory 
and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements regarding the product under investigation.  
When a study center receives an initial or follow -up report or other safety information (eg, 
revised In vestigator’s Brochure) from the sponsor, the responsible person according to local 
requirements is required to promptly notify his/her IRB or IEC.  The investigator should place 
copies of Safety Reports from the sponsor in the Investigator Site File.  
8.7. Pregn ancy Reporting   
If a female patient or the partner of a male patient becomes pregnant while receiving study 
treatment or within 90 days of the last dose of study drug, a pregnancy  report form should be 
completed and expeditiously submitted to the sponsor to facilitate outcome follow -up.  
Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the sponsor.  Generally, 
follow -up will be no longer than 8 weeks following  the estimated delivery date.  Any premature 
termination of the pregnancy will be reported.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or SAE.  
An abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous, should always be reported as an 
SAE.  Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a patient exposed to the 
study drug should be recorded and reported as an  SAE.  
8.8. Post-Study Adverse Event   
A post -study AE or SAE is defined as any AE that occurs after the AE/SAE reporting period, 
defined in Section  8.4.1 . 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former patients.  However, if the 
investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a patient has been discharged 
from the study, and he/she considers the SAE related to the study drug, the investigator will 
notify the sponsor.  
8.9. Expedited Reporting to Health Authorities, Investigators, 
Institutional Review Boards, and Independent Ethics Committees   
The sponsor will promptly assess all SAEs against cumulative study drug experience to identify 
and expeditiously communicate new safety findings to regulatory authorities, inves tigators, 
IRBs, and IECs based on applicable legislation.  
To determine the reporting requirements for individual SAEs, the sponsor will assess the 
expectedness of the SAEs using the following reference documents:

DETERMINATION   
All statistical analyses will be performed by the sponsor or designee.  Data will be listed and 
summarized according to sponsor -agreed reporting standards.  
Details of the statistical analyses will be included in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan.  
9.1. Study En dpoints   
9.1.1.  Primary Endpoint   
The primary endpoint is ORR ( PR or higher, defined as CR/CRi + PR + nodular  PR) determined 
by investigator assessment using the “modified” 2008 IWCLL guidelines ( Hallek M  et al 2008 ) 
with modification for treatment -related lymphocytosis ( Cheson et al 2012 ) for patients with CLL 
(Appendix  2) and per Lugano Classification for non -Hodg kin lymphoma (NHL) 
(Cheson  et al 2014 ) for patients with SLL ( Appendix  3). While the primary efficacy endpoi nt is 
per investigator assessment, ORR per independent central review will also be analyzed to 
support the primary analysis.  In the United States, ORR assessed by independent central review 
will be the basis for regulatory decisions.  
9.1.2.  Secondary Endpoints   
Key Secondary Endpoint:  
The key secondary endpoint is PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the date of first 
documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, determined by the 
investigator.   While the key secondary efficacy endpoint is per investigator assessment, PFS per 
independent central review will also be analyzed to support the key secondary endpoint analysis.  
In the United States, PFS as sessed by independent central review will be used to support 
regulatory decisions.  
Other Secondary Endpoints:  
• Duration of response, defined as the time from the date that response criteria are first 
met to the date that disease progression is objectively d ocumented or death, 
whichever occurs first, determined by independent central review  
• Duration of response by investigator assessment  
• Time to treatment failure, defined as time from randomization to discontinuation of 
study drug due to any reason  
• Rate of  PR-L or higher, defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a CR/ CRi + 
PR + nodular PR + PR-L determined by independent central review  
• Overall survival, defined as the time from randomization to the date of death due to 
any cause  
• PROs measured by th e EQ -5D-5L and EORTC QLQ -C30 questionnaires  
• Safety parameters, including AEs, SAEs, clinical laboratory tests, physical exams, 
and vital signs

9.2. Statistical Analysis   
9.2.1.  Randomization Methods   
Patients will be randomized using the Interactive Response Technology  system for this study by 
permuted block stratified randomization.  
The stratified randomization using age (<  65 years versus ≥  65 years), geographic region (China 
versus non -China), refractory status (yes or no), and del17p/TP53 mutation status (present versus 
absent) as stratification factors will be produced, reviewed, and approved by an independent 
statistician.  
9.2.2.  Analysis Sets    
The Intent -to-Treat Analysis Set includes all randomized patients.  The Intent -to-Treat Analysis 
Set will be the prim ary analysis set for efficacy analyses.  
The Safety Analysis Set includes all patients who received any dose of study drug.  Patients will 
be included in the treatment group corresponding to the actual treatment received.  The Safety 
Analysis Set will be u sed for all safety analyses.  
The Per -protocol Analysis Set includes patients who received any dose of study drug and had no 
major protocol deviations.  Criteria for exclusion from the Per -protocol Analysis Set will be 
determined and documented before the d atabase lock for the primary analysis.  For the primary 
analysis of non -inferiority testing in ORR, the Per -protocol Analysis Set will be used as the 
secondary population.  
The PK Analysis Set includes all zanubrutinib treated - patients who have at least 1 post-dose 
drug concentration.    
9.2.3.  Subject Disposition   
The number of patients screened, randomized, randomized but not treated, treated, discontinued 
from study drug, and discontin ued from study will be summarized.  The primary reason for study 
drug discontinuation and study discontinuation will be summarized according to the categories 
recorded in the eCRF.  
9.2.4.  Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics   
Demographics and other baseline characteristics will be summarized in the Intent -to-Treat 
Analysis Set using descriptive statistics.  Continuous variables include age, weight, vital signs, 
and time since i nitial CLL/SLL diagnosis; categorical variables include sex, age group, race,

del11q, 12q+, and IGHV mutation analysis.  
9.2.5.  Prior and Concomitant Therapy   
Concomitant medications will be assigned an 11 -digit code using the World Health Organization 
Drug Dictionary drug codes.  Concomitant medications will be further coded to the appropriate 
Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code indicating therapeutic classification.  Prior and 
concomitant medications will be summarized and listed by drug and drug class in the Clinical 
Study Report for this protocol.  Prior medications will be defined as medica tions that started 
before the first dose of study drug, whether continuing at or stopped at the first dose of study 
drug.  Concomitant medications will be defined as medications that (1) started before the first 
dose of study drug and were continuing at th e time of the first dose of study drug, or (2) started 
on or after the date of the first dose of study drug up to 30 days after the patient’s last dose.  
9.2.6.  Efficacy Analysis   
9.2.6.1.  Primary  Efficacy Endpoint Analyses   
The primary hypothesis testing for the primary endpoint of ORR by investigator assessment (for 
the United States, by independent central review) will be to demonstrate the non-inferiority of 
zanubrutinib to ibrutinib.  The null and alternative hypotheses for the non -inferiority test are as 
follows:  
• H0NI: Response Ratio ( zanubrutinib /ibrutinib) ≤ 0.8558  
• HaNI: Response Ratio ( zanubrutinib /ibrutinib) > 0.8 558 
One interim analysis will occur approximately 12 months after 415 patients (69% information 
fraction) have been randomized.  The final analysis will occur approximately 12 months after 
600 patients have been randomized.  
A Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test for response ratio adjusting for the 4 randomization 
stratification factors (age [<  65 years versus ≥  65 years], geographic region (China versus non -
China), refractory status [yes or no], and del17p/TP53 status [present versus absent]) will be 
performed fo r the hypothesis testing.  The p -value from the test will be compared against the 
monitoring boundaries for the non -inferiority testing ( Table  8) and use d for the primary 
inference.  The treatment effect in ORR and its 95% Wald confidence interval (CI) will be 
estimated, and the Clopper -Pearson 95% CIs will be calculated for ORR for each treatment 
group.  
If the non -inferiority is demonstrated either at the  interim or the final analysis, further testing for 
the superiority of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib will be performed ( Brannath et al 2003 ).  The null and 
alternative hypotheses for the superiority test are as follows : 
• H0 SUP: Response Ratio ( zanubrutinib /ibrutinib) ≤ 1  
• Ha SUP: Response Ratio ( zanubrutinib /ibrutinib) > 1  
The monitoring boundaries for the non -inferiority and superiority tests are based on the O’Brien -
Fleming boundary approximated by the Lan -DeMets spending function and are listed in Table  8 
and Table  9.  The monitoring boundaries will be adjusted based on the actual information 

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 71 fraction (number of subjects for ORR) observed up to the data cutoff.  Deviation from the 
scheduled interim analysis will not affect the overall type I error ( Lan and DeMets 1983 ).

Justification of the Non-inferiority  Margin  
A non -inferiority margin of 0.8558 in response ratio was derived using the 95% to 95% fixed 
margin approach ( FDA Guidance for Industry  Non-Inferiority 2016 ).  In the RESONATE trial 
(Byrd  et al 2014 ), the ibrutinib effect over ofatumumab represented by the ratio of response rate 
(PR or higher) was 10.43 with a 95% CI of (5.2, 21.0) based on the independe nt review 
committee assessment.  In the RESONATE2 trial ( Burger et al 2015 ), the ibrutinib effect over 
chlorambucil represented by the ratio of response rate (PR or higher) was 2.33 with a 95% CI of 
(1.83, 2.97) ba sed on the independent review committee assessment.  In a fixed -effect meta -
analysis of the 2 studies using inverse variance weighting, the ibrutinib effect in response rate 
ratio is estimated as 2.7392 with a 95% CI of (2.1781, 3.4450).  Thus, M1 is 2.178 1, the lower 
bound of the 95% CI.  Since the effect sizes of ibrutinib are overactive controls in both studies 
(ofatumumab and chlorambucil, respectively), rather than placebos, the choice of M1 is very 
conservative and results in a narrow margin.  Requiri ng 80% of M1 to be retained (on the log 
scale) in zanubrutinib  to demonstrate non -inferiority generates a non -inferiority margin of 0.8558 
(for the response ratio), which is within the clinically acceptable limit.  
9.2.6.2.  Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses   
If the primary objective of demonstrating the non -inferiority of zanubrutinib  to ibrutinib in ORR 
is met, the treatment effect of the key secondary efficacy endpoint of PFS by i nvestigator 
assessment (for the United States, by independent central review) will be tested for 
non-inferiority under hierarchical testing to control the study -wise type I error.  
If non -inferiority is demonstrated for the key secondary efficacy endpoint of PFS, further testing 
of superiority will be performed for the endpoint ( Brannath  et al 2003 ). 

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 72 Treatment arm comparison for the other secondary efficacy endpoints will be descriptive, and no

Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Progression -free Survival  
The non -inferiority of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib for PFS will be tested under the non -inferiority 
margin of 1.3319 (for the hazard ration [HR] of zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) using a strat ified log -rank 
test based on the 4 randomization stratification factors: age (<  65 years versus ≥  65 years), 
geographic region (China versus non -China), refractory status (yes or no), and del17p/TP53 
mutation status (present versus absent).  The null and a lternative hypotheses to test the non -
inferiority are as below:  
• H0NI: HR (zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) ≥ 1.3319  
• HaNI: HR (zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) < 1.3319  
There will be a single analysis of PFS for the purpose of inference when approximately 205 PFS 
events have occurred; however, a one -sided significance level of 0.00001 will be applied to the 
analysis of PFS at the time when ORR is analyzed to compensate fo r the potential type I error 
increase from the descriptive analysis. Two hundred five (205) PFS events are expected to 
accrue 45 months after study start (as described in Section  9.4).  If the p -value from the stratified 
log-rank test for non -inferiority is significant, the non -inferiority of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib in 
terms of PFS will be demonstrated.  Further testing of superiority in terms of PF S will be 
performed in this case.  
The non -inferiority margin of 1.3319 was derived using the 95% -95% fixed margin method 
based on a meta -analysis of the RESONATE and RESONATE 2 studies.  In the RESONATE2 
study, the estimated PFS HR for ibrutinib versus chl orambucil is 0.16 with a 95% CI of (0.09, 
0.28).  In the updated RESONATE results ( Brown et al 2014 ), the estimated PFS HR for 
ibrutinib versus ofatumumab is 0.106 with a 95% CI of (0.073, 0.153).  In a fixed -effect me ta-
analysis, the pooled HR is estimated as 0.120 with a 95% CI of (0.088, 0.163).  Therefore, the 
control arm effect (M1) is -0.163 in HR and 1.814 in log HR.  Requiring 84.2% of M1 to be 
retained in zanubrutinib , a non -inferiority margin of 1.3319 for the  HR (zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) is 
generated.   
The HR for PFS and its 95% CI will be estimated from a stratified Cox regression model.  
The distribution of PFS including median and other quartiles, and PFS rate at selected 
timepoints, will be estimated using  the Kaplan -Meier method for each arm.   
PFS will be calculated as the time from the date of the randomization to the date of the first 
documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, regardless of the use of 
subsequent anticancer therapy p rior to the documented PD or death.  PFS for the patients without 
a documented PD or death will be censored at the last disease assessment.  
Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Duration of Response  
The distribution of DOR by independent central review includ ing median and other quartiles, 
will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method for each treatment group.  There will be no

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 73 treatment arm comparison for DOR.  The same analysis will be performed for DOR by 
investigator assessment.  The same censoring rule used in the PFS analysis will be used for the 
analysis of DOR.  
Time to Treatment Failure  
The HR for time to treatment failure and its 95% CI will be estimated from a stratified Cox 
regression using the 4 randomization stratification factors (age [< 65 year s versus ≥ 65 years], 
geographic region (China versus non -China), refractory status [yes or no], and del17p/TP53 
status [present versus absent]).  The Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the 
distribution of time to treatment failure for each treat ment group.  
Time to treatment failure will be calculated as the time from the date of randomization to the 
date of discontinuation of study treatment due to any cause.  Time to treatment failure will be 
censored at the data cutoff for the patients who did not discontinue study treatment.  
Rate of PR -L or Higher by Independent Central Review  
Rate of response ratio for PR -L or higher by independent central review and its 95% Wald CI 
will be estimated using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel method.  Clopper -Pearson 9 5% CI for the 
rate of response will be calculated for each treatment group.  
Overall Survival  
OS will be analyzed using the same methods employed for PFS by investigator assessment.  
Patient -Reported Outcomes   
The EORTC QLQ -C30 questionnaire will be summarized for each assessment timepoint for each 
treatment group.  The percentage of patients with a clinically meaningful change from baseline 
in “global health status/QOL” and functional domains will be summarized as “improved,” 
“stable,” or “worsened” and compared between 2 treatment groups.  The data may also be 
analyzed using repeated measure mixed model to account for missing data under the Missing at 
Random assumption.  
Changes in the EQ -5D-5L will be summarized for each treatment group.  
9.2.6.3.  Exploratory  Efficacy Analyses   
Cox and/or logistic regression models, as well as descriptive comparisons, may be used to 
explore the association between the prognostic, predictive biomarkers, as well as MRD and the 
clinical outcomes.  
Changes in the self -administered activity and quality of life questionnaire may be summarized 
for each treatment group.  
9.2.6.4.  Sensitivity Analyses   
For PFS, alternative censoring rules such as censoring for new anticancer therapy will be used as 
sensitivity analyses.  Details of sensitivity analyses will be described in the SAP.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 74 9.2.7.  Pharmacokinetics Analyses   
A population PK analysis may be performed to include plasma concentrations of zanubrutinib  
from this trial in an existing model.  PK parameters such as apparent systemic clearance and 
AUC may be derived from the population PK analysis if supported by data.  
An exposure -response (efficacy or safety endpoints) analysis may be performed if supported by 
data.  The results from the population PK and exposure -response analyses may be reported 
separately from the Clin ical Study Report.  
9.3. Safety Analyses   
Safety will be assessed by monitoring and recording all AEs graded by NCI -CTCAE v4.03.  
Laboratory values (CBC, serum chemistry, and coagulatio n), vital signs, physical exams, and 
ECG findings will also be used in the safety assessment.  Descriptive statistics will be used to 
analyze all safety data by the actual treatment group.  
9.3.1.  Extent of Exposure   
The extent of exposure to the study drug will be summarized descriptively as the number of 
cycles received (number and percentage of patients), duration of exposure (days), cumulative 
total dose received per patient (mg), dose  intensity (mg/day), and relative dose intensity (%).  
The number (and percentage) of patients with dose reductions, dose interruption, and drug 
discontinuation will be summarized with the respective reasons.  The cycles in which dose 
reduction/interruption  occurred will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  Frequency of 
dose modifications will be summarized by category.  
Patient data listings will be provided for all dosing records.  
9.3.2.  Adverse Events   
The AE verbatim descriptions (as recorded by the investigator on the eCRF) will be classified 
into standardized medical terminology using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA).  AEs will be coded to MedDRA (Version 20.0 or higher) lower level term closest to 
the verbatim term.  The linked MedDRA preferred term and primary system organ class will also 
be captured in the database.  
A treatment -emergent AE is defined as an AE that has an onset date on or after the first dose of 
study drug up to 30 days following the study drug discontinuation or the start of a new anticancer 
therapy, whichever comes first.  After this period, only treatment -related SAEs are to be reported 
(per Section  8.4.1 ).  Only the AEs that are treatment -emergent will be included in the summary 
tables.  All AEs, treatment -emergent or otherwise, will be presented in patient data listings.  
The incidence of treatment -emergent AEs will be reported as the number (and percentage) of 
patients with treatment -emergent AEs by system organ class and preferred term.  A patient will 
be counted only once by the highest severity grade according to CTCAE v4.0 3 within a system 
organ class and preferred term, even if the patient experienced more than 1 treatment -emergent 
AEs within a specific system organ class and preferred term.  The number (percentage) of 
patients with treatment -emergent AEs will also be summ arized by the relationship to the study 
drug.  Treatment -related AEs include those events considered by the investigator to be related to 

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 75 the study drug or with a missing assessment of the causal relationship.  SAEs, deaths, 
treatment -emergent AEs ≥ Grade 3, study drug -related treatment -emergent AEs, and 
treatment -emergent AEs that led to treatment discontinuation, dose reduction, or dose 
interruption will be summarized.  
Incidence and time to diarrhea (≥ Grade 3), severe bleeding (defined as ≥ Grade 3 bleed ing of 
any site or central nervous system bleeding of any grade), and atrial fibrillation (both new onset 
and exacerbation of existing atrial fibrillation) will also be summarized.  
9.3.3.  Laboratory Analyses   
Selected CBC components and serum chemistry values will be evaluated for each laboratory 
parameter by treatment group.  Abnormal laboratory values will be flagged and identified as 
those outside of (above or below) the normal range.   Reference (normal) ranges for laboratory 
parameters will be included in the Clinical Study Report.  Descriptive summary statistics (eg, n, 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum for continuous variables; n [%] for 
categorical variables) for t he laboratory parameters and their changes from baseline will be 
calculated.  Laboratory values will be summarized by visit and by the worst post -baseline visit.  
Laboratory parameters that are graded in NCI -CTCAE (v4.03) will be summarized by CTCAE 
grade.  In the summary of laboratory parameters by CTCAE grade, parameters with CTCAE 
grading in both high and low directions (eg, calcium, glucose, magnesium, phosphorus, 
potassium, sodium) will be summarized separately.  
9.3.4.  Vital Signs   
Descriptive statistics for the vital sign parameters (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart 
rate, temperature, and weight) and the changes from baseline will be presented by visit and 
treatment group for all visits.  Vital signs will be listed by patient and visit.  
9.3.5.  Electrocardiogram   
ECG assessments will be performed as described in Section  5.5.4  and in Appendix  10.  
Descriptive statistics for absolute and change from baseline ECG parameters will be presented.  
9.4. Sample Size Consideration   
The sample size calculation is based on the primary efficacy analysis for the primary endpoint of 
ORR.  Assuming a response ratio (zanubrutinib arm/ibrutinib arm) of 1.03 (72%/70%), 
600 patients will provide more than 90% power to demonstrate the non -inferiority of 
zanubrutinib to ibrutinib at the non -inferiority margin of 0.8558 (response ratio) and 1-sided 
alpha level of 0.025 when there is 1 interim analysis at 69% information fraction.  The response 
rate for ibrutinib is approximated from published clinical data ( Byrd et al 2019 ).   
Assuming an HR ( zanubrutinib arm/ibrutinib arm ) of 0.9, 205 events are required to achieve 
80% power at a 1 -sided alpha of 0.025 to demonstrate the non -inferiority of zanubrutinib to 
ibrutinib at the non -inferiority margin of 1.3319 (HR) in PFS  
If the 600 patients are randomized in a  1:1 ratio to the 2 arms over a 24 -month period including a 
9-month ramp -up period before reaching the peak enrollment of 33 patients/month with a 
0.0017/month hazard rate for drop -out, 205 events are expected to be accumulated in 45  months

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 76 from study star t.  A median PFS of 47  months for ibrutinib and an exponential distribution for 
PFS are also assumed.  
9.5. Interim Analysis   
There will be 1 in terim analysis for the non -inferiority (a nd the superiority if the non -inferiority 
is met) testing of ORR.  The interim analysis will be performed approximately 12 months after 
the randomization of 415 patients.  The monitoring boundaries for the interim and the final 
analyses for the non -inferio rity and superiority tests are based on the O’Brien -Fleming boundary 
approximated by the Lan -DeMets spending function and are depicted in Table  8 and Table  9 
(Section  9.2.6.1 ).  
If the boundary is met for  the interim non -inferiority analysis and the DMC recommends 
stopping the study, the sponsor may stop the study and file the results to the regulatory agencies 
for approval.  
9.6. Final Analysis   
If the primary objective of the ORR non -inferiority is met, the study will continue to follow up 
for PFS until 205 events are observed, which is estimated to be approximately 45  months from 
study start.

10.1. Steering Committee   
This study will be overseen by a Steering Committee consisting of experts in CLL/SLL a nd 
members of the sponsor’s staff.  The Steering Committee plays a central role in the design of the 
study, oversees the conduct of the study, and is to agree on a plan for communication of the 
results.  
10.2. Data Monitoring Committee   
An independent DMC consisting of experts in CLL/SLL, clinical trial safety monitoring, and 
statistics will evaluate safety data on a periodic basis and perform the efficacy interim analysis 
for this study.   Approximately every 6  months, the DMC will review all available safety data and 
also perform the interim efficacy analysis .  A separate charter will outline the details for the 
composition and responsibility of the DMC.  
10.3. Independent Central Review   
The sponsor will contract with an independent central review facility to provide an independent 
and blinded review of imaging and clinical data necessary to assess tumor response in thi s study.  
This will be conducted by qualified, board -certified radiologists and hematologists assigned to 
this study.  An independent central review charter will describe the independent review and 
define the processes, roles, and responsibilities of the s ponsor, the sites, the independent central 
review facility, and the reviewers.  
10.4. Provision of Study Results and Information to Investigators   
When the Clinical Study Report is compl eted, the sponsor will provide the major findings of the 
study to the investigator.  
In addition, details of the study drug assignment will be provided to the investigator to enable 
him/her to review the data to determine the outcome of the study for his/h er patient(s).  
The sponsor will not routinely inform the investigator or patient of the test results, because the 
information generated from this study will be preliminary in nature, and the significance and 
scientific validity of the results would be unde termined at such an early stage of research.

The sponsor will obtain approval to conduct the study from the appropriate regulatory agency in 
accordance with any applicable country -specific regulatory requirements or file the protocol to 
an appropriate regulatory agency before the study is initiated at a study center in that country.  
11.2. Investigator Responsibilities   
11.2.1.  Good Clinical Practice   
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in accordance with the principles of the 
“Declaration of Helsinki” ICH guidelines and that the basic principles of “Good Clinical 
Practice,” as outlined in 21 Code of Federal Regulations 312, Subpart D, “Responsibilities of 
sponsors and Investigators,” 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 50, and 21 Code of Federal 
Regulatio ns, Part 56, are adhered to.  
11.2.2.  Ethical Conduct of the Study and Ethics Approval   
This study will be conducted by the investigator and the study center in accordance with GCP 
and all  applicable regulatory requirements, including, where applicable, the current version of 
the Declaration of Helsinki.  
The sponsor’s sample ICF will be provided to each investigator who shall adapt it, subject to 
sponsor’s approval, for use at his/her site.   The investigator (or sponsor, where applicable) is 
responsible for ensuring that: 1) this protocol, 2) the study center’s ICF, and 3) any other 
information or forms that will be presented to potential patients (eg, advertisements, Health 
Insurance Portab ility and Accountability Act of 1996 authorization, or information that supports 
or supplements the informed consent) are reviewed and approved by the appropriate IEC/IRB.  
The IEC/IRB must be constituted in accordance with all applicable regulatory requir ements.  The 
sponsor will provide the investigator with relevant document(s)/data that are needed for IEC/IRB 
review and approval of the study.  Before the study drug(s) can be shipped to the study center, 
the sponsor or its authorized representative must receive copies of the IEC/IRB approval, the 
approved ICF, and any other information that the IEC/IRB has approved for presentation to 
potential patients.  
11.2.2.1.  Protocol Amendments   
Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immediate risk to study patients, may be 
initiated only by BeiGene.  All protocol modifications must be submitted by the investigator (or 
sponsor, where applicable) to competent authorities according to l ocal requirements and to the 
IRB/IEC together with, if applicable, a revised model ICF in accordance with local requirements.  
Written documentation from competent authorities (according to local requirements) and from 
the IRB/IEC and required site approva l must be obtained - before changes can be implemented.  
Information on any change in risk and/or change in scope must be provided to patients already 
actively participating in the study, and they must read, understand, and sign each revised ICF, 
confirming  willingness to remain in the trial.

Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 79 If the protocol, the ICF, or any other information that the IEC/IRB has approved for presentation 
to potential patients is amended during the study, the investigator (or sponsor, where applicable) 
is responsible for ens uring the IEC/IRB reviews and approves, where applicable, these amended 
documents.  The investigator must follow all applicable regulatory requirements pertaining to the 
use of an amended ICF including obtaining IEC/IRB approval of the amended form before new 
patients can consent to take part in the study using this version of the form.  Copies of the 
IEC/IRB approval of the amended ICF/other information and the approved amended ICF/other 
information must be forwarded to the sponsor promptly.  
11.2.3.  Informed Conse nt  
The investigator is responsible for obtaining written informed consent from each individual 
participating in this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, object ives, and 
potential hazards of the study and before undertaking any study -related procedures.  The 
investigator must utilize an IRB/IEC -approved ICF for documenting written informed consent.  
Each ICF will be appropriately signed and dated by the patient o r the patient’s legally authorized 
representative and the person obtaining consent.  
Informed consent must be obtained before the patient can participate in the study.  The contents 
and process of obtaining informed consent will be in accordance with all ap plicable regulatory 
requirements.  
In the event that the ICF or other form signed by the patient is amended during their participation 
in the study, patients must be re -consented to the most current version of the ICFs or form.  For 
any updated or revised I CFs or forms, the case history or clinical records for each patient shall 
document the informed consent process and that written informed consent was reobtained using 
the updated/revised ICFs for continued participation in the study.  
A copy of each signed  ICF must be provided to the patient or the patient’s legally authorized 
representative.  All signed and dated ICFs must remain in each patient’s study file or in the site 
master study file and must be available for verification by study monitors at any ti me. 
11.2.4.  Investigator Reporting Requirements   
As indicated in Section  8.6.2 , the investigator (or sponsor, where applicable) is responsible for 
reporting SAEs to the IEC/IRB, in accordance with all applicable regulations.  Furthermore, the 
investigator may be required to provide periodic safety updates on the conduct of the study  at 
his/her study center and notification of study closure to the IEC/IRB.  Such periodic safety 
updates and notifications are the responsibility of the investigator and not of the sponsor.  
11.2.5.  Confidentiality   
The investigator and sponsor will maintain confidentiality and privacy standards by following 
applicable data privacy laws covering the collection, storage, transmission, and processing of 
patients’ personal and medical informat ion.   
Patient medical information obtained during this study is confidential and may be disclosed only 
to third parties as permitted by the signed ICF (or a separate authorization for the use and 
disclosure of personal health information that has been sig ned by the patient), unless permitted or 
required by law.  

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 80 In the event of a breach of the confidentiality of a patient’s personal and medical information, the 
investigator and sponsor, as appropriate, shall fulfill all mediation steps and reporting obliga tions 
under applicable data privacy laws.   
Information on maintaining patient confidentiality in accordance with individual local and 
national patient privacy regulations must be provided to each patient as part of the ICF process, 
either as part of the I CF or as a separate signed document (for example, in the United States, a 
site-specific Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 consent may be used).   
The investigator must assure that patients’ anonymity will be strictly maintained an d that their 
identities are protected from unauthorized parties.  The investigator shall code the medical 
information obtained during the study with a unique patient identification number assigned to 
each patient enrolled in the study.  This approach ensur es that patients’ names are not included in 
any data set transmitted to any sponsor location.  Only patient initials (where allowed), date of 
independent central review, and an identification code (ie, not names) should be recorded on any 
form or biologica l sample submitted to the sponsor, IRB, or laboratory.  The investigator must 
keep a screening log showing codes, names, and addresses for all patients screened and for all 
patients enrolled in the trial.  
The investigator agrees that all information receiv ed from BeiGene, including but not limited to 
the Investigator’s Brochure, this protocol, eCRFs, the investigational drug, and any other study 
information, remain the sole and exclusive property of BeiGene during the conduct of the study 
and thereafter.  T his information is not to be disclosed to any third party (except employees or 
agents directly involved in the conduct of the study or as required by law) without prior written 
consent from BeiGene.  The investigator further agrees to take all reasonable p recautions to 
prevent the disclosure by any employee or agent of the study site to any third party or otherwise 
into the public domain.  
If the written contract for the conduct of the study includes confidentiality provisions regarding 
BeiGene’s confidentia l information inconsistent with this section, that contract’s provisions shall 
apply to the extent they are inconsistent with this section.  
11.2.6.  Data Collection   
Data required by the protocol will be entered into an EDC system.  
Data collection in the eCRF should follow the instructions described in the eCRF Completion 
Guidelines.  The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all  
clinical data entered in the eCRF.  The investigator or designee as identified on Statement of 
Investigator Form must sign the completed casebooks to attest to its accuracy, authenticity, and 
completeness.  
Data contained in the eCRFs are the sole property  of BeiGene and should not be made available 
in any form to third parties without written permission from BeiGene, except for authorized 
representatives of BeiGene or appropriate regulatory authorities.  
11.2.7.  Data Management/Coding   
All final patient data, both eCRF and external data (eg, laboratory data), collected according to 
the protocol, will be stored at BeiGene at the end of the study.  

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 81 Standard procedures (including following da ta review guidelines, computerized validation to 
produce queries, and maintenance of an audit file which includes all database modifications) will 
be followed to support accurate data collection.  Data will be reviewed for outliers, logic, data 
inconsisten cies, and completeness.  
During the course of the study, a study monitor (clinical research associate) will make site visits 
to review protocol compliance, compare eCRFs against individual patient’s medical records, and 
ensure that the study is being conduc ted according to pertinent regulatory requirements.  
eCRF entries will be verified with source documentation.  The review of medical records will be 
performed in a manner to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained.  Checking the eCRFs 
for complete ness, clarity, and cross -checking with source documents is required to monitor the 
progress of the study.  Direct access to source data is also required for inspections and audits and 
will be carried out giving due consideration to data protection and medi cal confidentiality.  
AEs will be coded using the MedDRA Version 20.0 or higher.  Concomitant medications will be 
coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary.  Concomitant diseases/medical 
history will be coded using the MedDRA Version 20.0 or  higher.  
11.2.8.  Data Integrity and In -house Blinding   
Due to the open -label design of the study, access to the patient -level clinical data in the EDC 
system will only be assigned to pred efined study personnel.  Functions/persons with access to the 
EDC system shall be prohibited from using the EDC system to generate unnecessary 
listings/summaries that may introduce unwanted bias, or sharing such outputs from the EDC 
system with other funct ions/persons who do not have access to the EDC.  In addition, the central 
imaging vendor will perform the central imaging review without knowledge of treatment arm 
assignment.  Although the trial is open label, analyses or summaries generated by randomized  
treatment assignment and actual treatment received will be limited and documented.  
11.2.9.  Drug Accountability at Site   
The investigator or designee (ie, pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring adequate accountability 
of all used and unused study drug.  This includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of 
study product where applicable (quantity and condition), patient -drug dispensation records, and 
returned or destroyed study pro duct.  Dispensing records will document quantities received from 
BeiGene and/or commercially sourced, quantities dispensed to patients, and quantities destroyed 
or returned to BeiGene, including lot number, date dispensed, patient identifier number, patien t 
initials, and the initials of the person dispensing the medication.  
At study initiation, sites should have an appropriate standard operating procedure for study drug 
disposal/destruction.  At the end of the study, following final drug inventory reconcili ation by the 
monitor, the study site will dispose of and/or destroy all unused study drug supplies, including 
empty containers, according to these procedures and applicable law, including that regarding 
disposal of hazardous waste.  If the site cannot meet  BeiGene’s requirements for disposal, 
arrangements will be made between the site and BeiGene or its representative for destruction or 
return of unused study drug supplies.  
All drug supplies and associated documentation will be periodically reviewed and ver ified by the 
study monitor over the course of the study.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 82 11.2.10.  Inspections, Audits, and Monitoring Visits   
The investigator must ensure the facilities used for this trial and all the so urce documents for this 
trial should be made available to appropriately qualified personnel from BeiGene or its 
representatives, to IRBs/IECs, or to regulatory authority or health authority inspectors.  
11.2.11.  Protocol Adherence   
The investigator is responsible for ensuring the study is conducted in accordance with the 
procedures and evaluations described in this protocol.  Investigators assert they will apply due 
diligence to avoid protoc ol deviations.  
The investigator is to document and explain any deviations from the approved protocol.  The 
investigator must promptly report any major deviations that might impact patient safety and/or 
data integrity to the sponsor and, if applicable, to t he IRB/IEC, in accordance with established 
IRB/IEC policies and procedures.  
11.2.12.  Financial Disclosure   
Investigators are required to provide the sponsor with sufficient, accurate finan cial information 
in accordance with regulations to allow the sponsor to submit complete disclosure or certification 
to the absence of certain financial interest of clinical investigators and/or disclose those financial 
interests, as required by the appropr iate health authorities.  This is intended to ensure financial 
interests and arrangements of clinical investigators with BeiGene that could affect reliability of 
data submitted to health authorities are identified and disclosed by the sponsor.  Investigato rs are 
responsible for providing information about their financial interests before participation in the 
study, and to update this information if any relevant changes occur during the study and for 1 
year after completion of the study (ie, last patient, la st visit).  
11.3. Study Report and Publications   
A Clinical Study Report will be prepared and provided to the regulatory agency(ies).  BeiGene 
will ensure that the report meets the stand ards set out in the International Conference on 
Harmonisation Guideline for Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports (International 
Conference on Harmonisation E3).  Note that an abbreviated report may be prepared in certain 
cases.  
The results of th is study will be published or presented at scientific meetings in a timely, 
objective, and clinically meaningful manner that is consistent with good science, industry and 
regulator guidance, and the need to protect the intellectual property of BeiGene (spo nsor), 
regardless of the outcome of the trial.  The data generated in this clinical trial are the exclusive 
property of the sponsor and are confidential.  As this is a multicenter study, the first publication 
or disclosure of study results shall be a compl ete, joint multicenter publication or disclosure 
coordinated by the sponsor.  Thereafter, any secondary publications will reference the original 
publication(s).  Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement, and all authors must meet 
the criteria for authorship established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors 
Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts or stricter local criteria ( International Committee of 
Medical Journal Editors, 2013 ). 

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 83 Each  investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts, abstracts, posters, publications, and 
presentations (both oral and written) to the sponsor prior to submission or presentation in 
accordance with the clinical study agreement.  This allows the sponsors to pro tect proprietary 
information, provide comments based on information from other studies that may not yet be 
available to the investigator, and ensure scientific and clinical accuracy.  Each investigator 
agrees that, in accordance with the terms of clinical study agreement, a further delay of the 
publication/presentation may be requested by the sponsor to allow for patent filings in advance 
of the publication/presentation.   
11.4. Study and Study Center Closure   
Upon completion of the study, the monitor will conduct the following activities in conjunction 
with the investigator or study center personnel, as appropriate:  
• Return of all study data to the sponsor  
• Resolve and close all data queries  
• Accountability, reconciliation, and arrangements for unused study drug(s)  
• Review of study records for completeness  
• Return of treatment codes to the sponsor  
• Shipment of PK samples to assay laboratories  
In addition, the sponsor reserves the right to suspend or prematurely discontinue this study either 
at a single study center or at all study centers at any time for reasons including, but not limited 
to, safety or ethical issues or severe noncompliance with this protocol, GCP, the clinical study 
agreem ent, or applicable laws and regulations.  If the sponsor determines such action is needed, 
the sponsor will discuss this with the investigator (including the reasons for taking such action) 
at that time.  When feasible, the sponsor will provide advance not ification to the investigator of 
the impending action prior to it taking effect.  
The sponsor will promptly inform all other investigators and/or institutions conducting the study 
if the study is suspended or terminated for safety reasons and will also info rm the regulatory 
authorities of the suspension or termination of the study and the reason(s) for the action.  If 
required by applicable regulations, the investigator must inform the IEC/IRB promptly and 
provide the reason for the suspension or termination . 
If the study is prematurely discontinued, all study data must still be provided to the sponsor.  In 
addition, arrangements will be made for all unused study drug(s) in accordance with the 
applicable sponsor procedures for the study.  
Financial compensati on to investigators and/or institutions will be in accordance with the 
agreement established between the investigator and the sponsor.  
11.5. Records Retention and Study Files   
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study 
to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified.  These documents should 

BGB -3111 -305 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 03 April  2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 84 be classified into at least the following 2 categories: (1) investiga tor’s study file and (2) patient 
clinical source documents.  
The investigator’s study file will contain the protocol/amendments, eCRF and query forms, 
IRB/IEC, and governmental approval with correspondence, informed consent, drug records, staff 
curriculum v itae and authorization forms, and other appropriate documents and correspondence.  
Patient clinical source documents (usually defined by the project in advance to record key 
efficacy/safety parameters independent of the eCRFs) would include (although not be  limited to) 
the following: patient hospital/clinic records, physician’s and nurse’s notes, appointment book, 
original laboratory reports, ECG, electroencephalogram, X -ray, pathology and special 
assessment reports, consultant letters, screening and enrollm ent log, etc.  
Following closure of the study, the investigator must maintain all study records in a safe and 
secure location.  The records must be maintained to allow easy and timely retrieval when needed 
(eg, audit or inspection), and, whenever feasible,  to allow any subsequent review of data in 
conjunction with assessment of the facility, supporting systems, and personnel.  Where permitted 
by local laws/regulations or institutional policy, some or all of these records can be maintained in 
a format other than hard copy (eg, microfiche, scanned, electronic); however, caution needs to be 
exercised before such action is taken.  The investigator must assure that all reproductions are 
legible, are a true and accurate copy of the original, and meet accessibility  and retrieval 
standards, including re -generating a hard copy, if required.  Furthermore, the investigator must 
ensure there is an acceptable back up of these reproductions and that an acceptable quality 
control process exists for making these reproduction s. 
The sponsor will inform the investigator of the time period for retaining these records to comply 
with all applicable regulatory requirements.  The minimum retention time will meet the strictest 
standard applicable to that study center for the study, as  dictated by any institutional 
requirements or local laws or regulations, or the sponsor’s standards/procedures; otherwise, the 
retention period will default to 15 years.  
The investigator must notify the sponsor of any changes in the archival arrangements,  including, 
but not limited to, the following: archival at an off -site facility, transfer of ownership of or 
responsibility for the records in the event the investigator leaves the study center.  
If the investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requireme nt at the study site for any or all of 
the documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator and BeiGene to 
store these in sealed containers outside of the site so that they can be returned sealed to the 
investigator in case of a regula tory audit.  When source documents are required for the continued 
care of the patient, appropriate copies should be made for storage outside of the site.  
Biological samples remaining after this study may be retained in storage by the sponsor for the 
shorte r of: a period of up to 10  years or as allowed by the IRB/IEC.  A longer storage period may 
apply in the event that subjects consent to BeiGene retaining remaining samples for future 
research (Section  5.15).

All information provided by the sponsor and all data and information generated by t he study 
center as part of the study (other than a patient’s medical records) are the sole property of the 
sponsor.  
All rights, title, and interests in any inventions, know -how or other intellectual or industrial 
property rights, whether or not patentable,  which are conceived or reduced to practice by the 
study center personnel during the course of or as a result of the study are the sole property of the 
sponsor, and are hereby assigned to the sponsor.  
If a written contract for the conduct of the study whic h includes ownership provisions 
inconsistent with this statement is executed between the sponsor and the study center, that 
contract’s ownership provisions shall apply rather than this statement.  
All information provided by the sponsor and all data and inf ormation generated by the study 
center as part of the study (other than a patient’s medical records) will be kept by the investigator 
and other study center personnel.  This information and data will not be used by the investigator 
or other study center pe rsonnel for any purpose other than conducting the study.   
These restrictions do not apply to:  
• Information which becomes publicly available through no fault of the investigator or 
study center personnel  
• Information which is necessary to disclose in confide nce to an IEC/IRB solely for the 
evaluation of the study  
• Information which is necessary to disclose in order to provide appropriate medical 
care to a patient  
• Study results which may be published as described in Section  11.3. 
If a written contract for the conduct of the study which includes provisions inconsistent with this 
statement is executed, that contract’s pro visions shall apply rather than this statement.  
11.7. Joint Investigator/Sponsor Responsibilities   
11.7.1.  Access to Information for Monitoring   
In accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation GCP guidelines, the study 
monitor must have direct access to the investigator’s source documentation in order to verify the 
data recorded in the eCRFs for consistency . 
The monitor is responsible for routine review of the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the 
study to verify adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the 
data being entered on them.  The monitor should have access to  any patient records needed to 
verify the entries on the eCRFs.  The investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure 
that any problems detected or queries raised in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.

baseline, then one Group A parameter is sufficient.  Bone marrow result s are not required as a Group A parameter to determine PR unless that is the 
only Group A parameter abnormal at baseline.  
f. Nodular partial response: all the criteria met for complete response except for the presence of lymphoid nodules in the bone marrow  
g. Partial response with lymphocytosis: blood lymphocytes decreased < 50% or increased from baseline + otherwise meeting criteria for PR  
h. Progressive disease: at least 1 of the above progressive disease criteria must be met.  
• Stable disease: is absence of progressive disease and failure to achieve at least a PR -L 
Note:   BTK inhibition may cause lymphocytosis due to a redistribution of leukemia cells from the lymphoid tissues to the blood.   In such cases, increased blood 
lymphocytosis may not be a sign of tr eatment failure or progressive disease.   The opposite may occur during periods of temporary holds of BTK inhibitors (due 
to adverse events or other reasons), and leukemia cells may redistribute from the blood to lymphoid tissue; this also may not be a sign  of treatment failure or 
progressive disease.  Isolated increase in lymph nodes and/or splenomegaly during periods of study drug hold may occur leading to PD. Sites should do their best 
to obtain CT scans and perform response assessments using the time allo tted in assessment windows to avoid this situation. Patient may continue study treatment 
post first assessed PD if it is perceived that the patient will benefit from continued treatment . After the second assessment of PD , the patient must discontinue 
from study treatment. In rare instances , after discussion with the Medical Monitor, the patient may remain on study treatment even after the second assessment of 
PD.

Note: The list of drugs in this table is not exhaustive.  Please refer to the prescribing information of concomitant 
medication to check for CYP3A inhibition or induction risks or contact the medical monitor of the protocol.  
a. The effect of grap efruit juice varies widely among brands and is concentration -, dose -, and preparation -
dependent. Studies have shown that it can be classified as a “strong CYP3A inhibitor” when a certain 
preparation was used (eg,   high dose, double strength) or as a “moder ate CYP3A inhibitor” when another 
preparation was used (eg,, low dose, single strength).  
b. Ritonavir is usually given in combination with other anti -HIV or anti -HCV drugs in clinical practice. 
Caution should be used when extrapolating the observed effect of ritonavir alone to the effect of 
combination regimens on CYP3A activities.

1 Grades: 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe; 4, life -threatening; 5, fatal.  Death occurring as a result of toxicity at any 
level of decrease from pretreatment will be reported as Grade  5. 
2 Platelet counts must be be low normal levels for Grades 1 to 4.  If, at any level of decrease, the platelet count 
is < 20 × 109/L (20,000/μL), this will be considered Grade  4 toxicity, unless a severe or life -threatening decrease 
in the initial platelet count (eg < 20 × 109/L [20,00 0/μL]) was present pretreatment, in which case the patient is not 
evaluable for toxicity referable to platelet counts.  
3 Hemoglobin (Hgb) levels must be below normal levels for Grades 1 to 4. Baseline and subsequent Hgb 
determinations must be performed bef ore any given transfusions. The use of erythropoietin is irrelevant for the 
grading of toxicity, but should be documented.  
4 If the ANC reaches < 1 × 109/L (1,000/μL), it should be judged to be Grade 3 toxicity. Other decreases in the 
WBC, or in circulatin g neutrophils, are not to be considered because a decrease in the WBC is a desired 
therapeutic endpoint. A gradual decrease in granulocytes is not a reliable index in CLL for stepwise grading of 
toxicity. If the ANC was < 1 × 109/L (1,000/μL) before therap y, the patient is not evaluable for toxicity referable 
to the ANC. The use of growth factors such as granulocyte colony -stimulating factor (G -CSF) is not relevant to the 
grading of toxicity, but should be documented.

c. Visits repeat every 24 weeks (± 14 days) after end of treatment. Assessments during this phase are conducted primarily to assess disease progression. See 
Section  5.12.2 . 
d. Survival Follow -up phase will be every 24 weeks (± 14 days)  until the end of the study for patients who have ended treatment and progressed.  A study visit is 
not mandator y during Survival -Follow -up: see Section  5.12.3 . 
e. All Day 1 assessments should occur pre -dose unless otherwise specified.  
f. Cycle 7 has a ± 2 day window  
g. Informed consent and assignment of screen number must occur before any study specific procedures, and may be obtained before the screening window 
begins.  Consent must be obtained on the current version of the form approved by the IEC. See Section  5.2. 
h. After a patient is screened and the investigator determines the patient is eligible for randomization, study site personnel w ill complete an Eligibility 
Authorization Packet and the medical monitor or designee will provide final approval for enrollment in writing.  Study site pe rsonnel should ensure that a 
medical monitor -approved Eligibility Packet is in the patient’s file before proceeding with Day 1 stud y procedures. See Section  5.2.5 . 
i. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to one of two arms - Arm A: zanubrutinib or Arm B: ibrutinib. See Section  3.1 and Section  9.2.1 . 
j. Zanubrutinib will be administ ered 160 mg orally twice daily with or without food (See Section  6.2.1 ).  Ibrutinib will be administered 420 mg orally once daily 
(See Section  6.2.2 ). Study drug (both zanubrutinib and ibrutinib) may be supplied and dispensed as frequently as every cycle and accountability  should be 
done at th at time (See Section  6.1.4). Please refer to the pharmacy manual for further information and the most recent guidance on study drug supply 
frequency dur ing the trial.  
k. Sparse PK samples will be collected from all patients assigned to Arm A (zanubrutinib) on Cycle 1 Day 1 pre -dose (within 30 min prior to the morning dose), 
2 hours post -dose (± 30 minutes), and before subject discharge (4 -6 hours post -dose);  and pre -dose (within 30 min prior to the morning dose) on Cycle 3 Day 
1 and Cycle 4 Day 1 (See Section  5.4). 
l. Assess systems per standard of care a t the study site and as clinically indicated by symptoms.  Includes weight (height at Screening only).  Assessment of vital 
signs and a focused physical examination on Cycle 1 Day 1 may be skipped if performed within the last 7 days. See Section  5.5.2 . 
m. Perform a 12 -lead ECG in triplicate at screening for all subjects.  For subjects assigned to the zanubrutinib arm, one 12 -lead ECG will be performed at, p re-
dose (within 30 min prior to dose) and 2 hours (± 30 min) post -dose on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2, and one 12 -lead ECG performed on Day 1 of Cycles 3 and 4 
and Day 1 of every 3 cycles thereafter (at Cycle 7, Cycle 10, etc) until EOT.  The ECG can be perfor med at either pre -dose or post -dose.  For subjects 
assigned to the ibrutinib arm, a 12 -lead ECG in triplicate will be performed at Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, and 4 and Day 1 of every 3 cycles thereafter (Cycle 7, 
Cycle 10, etc) until EOT.  The ECG can be per formed at either pre -dose or post -dose. See Section  5.5.4 . 
n. After informed consent has been signed but prior to the administration of the study drug , only SAEs should be reported.  If patients screen fail, reporting of 
SAEs will end at the time of screen failure.  After initiation of study drug, all AEs and SAEs, regardless of relationship to  study drug, will be reported until 30 
days after the last d ose of study drug. After this period, the investigator should report any SAEs that are believed to be related to prior study drug treatment.  
In addition, arrhythmia signs/symptoms will be reviewed at every visit.  This will involve the investigators askin g subjects for signs and symptoms of 
ventricular dysfunction (eg, shortness of breath, dizziness or fainting), as part of the routine AE monitoring for each visit . See Section  8.4.1 . 
o. Efficacy will be assessed every 6 cycles following C25 (C31, C37, C43, etc.) until progression.  Patients that end treatment but do not progress will continue 
to conduct efficacy assessments as part of Long -term Follow -up (See Section  5.12.2 ). 
p. CT with contrast of neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis to be performed at Screening, Cycle 4 Day 1, t hen every 3 cycles until Cycle 25, followed by every 6 
cycles thereafter, until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, death, lost to follow -up, or end of study, whichever occurs first.  Copies of all scans will be 
sent for independent central review for response assessment.  MRI may be used in place of CT; for details on imaging requirements see Section  5.6.3 .  All 
imaging should use the specif ied visit window or a ± 7 -day window, whichever is longer.  Imaging is to be performed as scheduled , independent of study drug 
hold.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 108 q. Imaging does not need to be repeated if performed within 45 days before the End of Treatment Visit.  
r. Bone marrow biopsy and a spirate are required during 1) the screening period. Fifteen unstained slides or archival block of a previously performed dia gnostic 
bone marrow biopsy are acceptable if within 90 days of randomization. Aspirate only required for patients with SLL; 2) if c linical and laboratory results 
demonstrate a potential CR or CRi. This should be done within 40 days from the CT/MRI meeting the criteria of CR/CRi. If this  is done and patients show 
bone marrow involvement preventing CR/CRi classification it should rechec k bone marrow at least once every 12 months until CR or CRi is confirmed as 
long as the patient is still showing evidence of CR or CRi outside of bone marrow results.  Recheck may be done earlier than 12 months as clinically 
indicated. 3) At time of suspec ted progression due to cytopenias.  See Section  5.6.4  for details.  
s. Patients should complete the EQ -5D-5L and EORTC QLQ -C30 questionnaires before th e first dose of study drug, and before performing any other 
procedures.   See Section  5.7. 
t. Self-Administered Activity and Quality of Life Evaluation may be optionally consented to in select countries. Assessments will be conducted weekly for the 
first 12 weeks and monthly up to 2 years (See Section  5.7.3 ). 
u. Complete blood count and differential will be evaluated by a central or local laboratory. Complete blood count includes hemog lobin, hematocrit, platelet 
count, red blood cell count, white blood cell count with differential (neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil, and basophil). See Section  5.8.1 . 
v. Serum chemistry will be evaluated by a central or local laboratory.  Serum chemistry includes so dium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate (carbon dioxide, or if 
neither is available carbon dioxide combining power), glucose, blood urea nitrogen (or serum urea), creatinine, calcium, phos phate (or phosphorus), 
magnesium, total bilirubin, total protein, alb umin, ALT, AST, lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase. See Section  5.8.2 . 
w. The following 2 chemistry tests will only be done at Screening: dire ct antiglobulin test and β -2 microglobulin. See Section  5.8.2 . 
x. Hepatitis B serology includes HBsAg, HBcAb, HBsAb.  Patients who are HBcAb positive, HBs Ag negative, and HBV DNA negative will undergo viral load 
measurement (HBV DNA by PCR) as outlined in Section  5.8.5 .  Hepatitis C serology includes  HCV antibody.  Patients who are HCV antibody positive, but 
negative for HCV RNA, will undergo viral load testing (HCV RNA by PCR) every cycle.  Viral hepatitis B and C testing will be performed in a central 
laboratory, but may be performed locally if loca l testing sensitivity is adequate and after discussion with the medical monitor. See Section  5.8.5 . 
y. HIV test will be performed locally. HIV testing will be performed during Screening unless previous HIV test results from ≤ 4 weeks prior to Screening are 
available. See Section  5.8.7 . 
z. For all women  of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation), a serum pregnancy test will be performed at screen ing within 7 days 
of randomization and at end of treatment.  Laboratory -based highly sensitive pregnancy tests (urine or serum) wi ll be performed on Day 1 of every cycle and 
for at least 90 days after the last dose of study drug.  If a urine pregnancy test is positive, it must be confirmed by a ser um pregnancy test. See Section  5.8.6 . 
aa. Blood samples (heparin) will be collected at the time of screening to assess prognostic factors such as del17p by FISH in a c entral laboratory (see the 
Laboratory Manual for details)  
bb. Blood samples (ED TA) are required at the time of Screening, and at the time of CR or CRi, and disease progression for the assessment of mutati ons by 
molecular methods in a central laboratory (see the Laboratory Manual for details). See Section  5.9. 
cc. Patients who are HBsAg negative, HBcAb positive, and HBV DNA negative must undergo at least once on every cycle HBV DNA monit oring by PCR.  
These patients should be considered for prophylactic antiviral treatment in consultation with a local HBV expert.  If a patient is being treated prophylactically  
with antivirals, HBV DNA monitoring by PCR must be done at least every 90 days (every third cycle). See Section  5.8.5 . 
dd. Blood samples (EDTA) are required at the time of Screening, and at the time of CR or CRi, for the assessment of MRD by flow c ytometry in a specialized 
central  laboratory (see the Laboratory Manual for details). See Section  5.9. 
ee. Survival status assessment may be conducted on ad hoc basis for a data cut wit hin 30 days prior to the data  cutoff date. Survival information may be 
confirmed via a phone call, medical records, or other methods. See Section  5.6.5 .

MANAGEMENT   
The recommendations below for the diagnosis and management of adverse events of interest are 
intended as a  guidance. This Appendix should be used in conjunction with expert clinical 
judgement (eg, by experts specializing in cardiology for management of atrial fibrillation), and 
individual institutional guidelines or policies. Local prescribing guidance for ibr utinib applicable 
to your country should always take precedence for your country as applicable.

Management  
Atrial Fibrillation  1 
Asymptomatic, 
intervention not 
indicated  For all grades, recommend 
consultation with cardiologist for 
co-management of patients on 
study and to help determine the 
overall risk of embolic stroke 
versus bleeding. The usage of the 
CHA2DS2 -VASc risk assessment  
tool can be helpful. When selecting 
medical therapy for these patients, 
consider avoiding strong CYP3A4 
inducers and inhibitors 
(Section  7.2.1 ).  
If the patient requires 
anticoagulation, recommend 
minimizing other medications 
associated with increased bleeding 
risk; however, decisions needed to 
be balanced by the need for such 
medications in consultation with 
other specialists. Warfarin is 
highly discou raged given known 
bleeding risk.  Recommend 
continuation of study 
treatment especially if 
CHA2DS2 -VASc score 
is 0 or 1 and no 
anticoagulation is 
indicated.  2 
Non-urgent medical 
intervention indicated  
3 
Symptomatic and 
incompletely controlled 
medically  For atrial 
fibrillation/flutter 
≥ Grade 3, follow the 
dose reductions 
described in 
Section  6.5.1  for 
zanubrutinib and 
Section  6.5.2  for 
ibrutinib . For subjects 
experiencing atrial 
fibrillation that is 
symptomatic and/or 
incompletely 
controlled: After the 
atrial fibrillation is  
adequately controlled, 
the study drug may be 
restarted at either the 
original dose or dose 
level -1, per discretion 
of the treating 
investigator.  
Patients who have 
intracranial hemorrhage 
in the context of atrial 
fibrillation should 
permanently 
discontinu e treatment.  4 
Life-threatening 
consequences; urgent 
intervention indicated  If patients are unstable, urgent 
referral to a cardiologist and 
evaluation for cardioversion and/or 
therapeutic anticoagulation is 
recommended.

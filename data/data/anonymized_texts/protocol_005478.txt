Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Name of Finished Product:  
Netarsudil Ophthalmic Solution 0.02%  
Name of Active Ingredients:  
Netarsudil mesylate  
Study Title:  
A Randomized, Open -Label, Parallel -Group Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Two Dosing 
Regimens of Netarsudil Ophthalmic Solution in Patients with Corneal Edema Due to Fuchs Corneal 
Dystrophy  
Study Number:  
AR-13324 -CS210  
Study Phase:  
2 
Primary  Objective:  
To evaluate the reduction in central corneal thickness (CCT) in eyes dosed with either Netarsudil Ophthalmic 
Solution 0.02% (netarsudil) once -daily (QD) or netarsudil twice -daily (BID) for the treatment of corneal 
edema due to Fuchs corneal dys trophy (FCD).  
Secondary Objectives:  
(1) To evaluate the proportion of subjects demonstrating improvement in vision following treatment for FCD
with netarsudil QD or netarsudil BID.
(2) To evaluate the safety of netarsudil QD and netarsudil  BID in subjects with FCD.
Study Design:  
This is an 8 -week, randomized, open -label, multicenter, efficacy and safety study in subjects with FCD. 
The study will be conducted at approximately 20 sites in the USA. Two different dosing regimens (QD and 
BID) of netarsudil will be studied (randomized 1:1) to evaluate their efficacy in reducing or resolving corneal 
edema in subjects with FCD. Subjects randomi zed to the netarsudil QD dosing regimen will be instructed to 
instill one drop of the Study Artificial Tear in the study eye every morning, and one drop of netarsudil in the 
study eye every evening. Subjects randomized to the netarsudil BID dosing regimen will instill one drop of 
netarsudil in the study eye every morning and evening.  
CCT will be measured by ultrasound pachymetry at approximately the same time of day ±  60 minutes and 
always before noon (local time), at each of the 5 scheduled visits (Screeni ng, Baseline [Day 1], Week  2, 
Week  4, and Week  8/Exit). In order to be eligible to participate in the study, subjects will have been 
diagnosed with visually significant central corneal edema due to FCD, in at least one eye at Screening and 
Baseline, for no  longer than 12 months’ duration.  
For analysis purposes, the study eye will be defined as the eligible eye with a Baseline CCT of at least 
600 μm, as assessed by ultrasound pachymetry. If both eyes are eligible at both Screening and Baseline based 
on CCT and enrollment criteria, the study eye will be the eye with the thinner cornea at the Baseline Visit.   
Study Population:  
Approximately forty (40) subjects will be enrolled  
Key Inclusion Criteria:  
•Adults aged 18 years or older
•Documented diagnosis of FCD

    • Evidence of central corneal edema, in at least one eye, at the Screening and Baseline Visit. The study 
eligible eye(s) should have a CCT of at least 600 μm at both the Screening and Baseline Visit  
• Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)  using the  Early Treatm ent of Diabetic Retinopathy Study 
(ETDRS ) methodology of 70 to 20 letters  at Screening and Baseline in the eligible eye(s)  
 
Key Exclusion Criteria:  
• FCD so advanced that, in the opinion of the Investigator, surgery would likely be required in the study 
eligible eye(s) within the study period  
• Clinically significant ocular disease (other than FCD) or trauma in the eligible eye(s) which could 
interfere with study interpretation  
• History of ocular surgery within 6 months of the Screening Visit, or any prior c orneal refractive surgery 
in the eligible eye(s)  
Study Medication , Dose, and Mode of Administration:  
Once Daily Netarsudil Dosing Regimen  
Study Artificial Tear; one drop, in the study eye in the morning  
Netarsudil 0.02% ophthalmic solution; one drop, in  the study eye in the evening  
Twice Daily Netarsudil Dosing Regimen  
Netarsudil 0.02% ophthalmic solution; one drop, in the study eye in the morning and in the evening  
Duration of Treatment:  
Eight (8) Weeks  
Efficacy Assessments:  
Primary Endpoint:   
• Mean change from baseline in CCT as assessed by ultrasound pachymetry at Week 4  
Secondary Endpoints:  
• Mean change from baseline in BCVA at Week 4  
• Mean change from baseline in CCT as assessed by ultrasound pachymetry at Week 8  
• Mean change from ba seline in BCVA at Week 8  
• Proportion of subjects who gained ≥15 letters (3 lines) in BCVA at Week 4  
• Proportion of subjects who gained ≥15 letters (3 lines) in BCVA at Week 8  
• Proportion of subjects with complete resolution of corneal edema at Week 4  
• Proportion of subjects with complete resolution of corneal edema at Week 8     
Safety Assessments:  
The safety of netarsudil QD and BID will be evaluated at each visit by:  
• Adverse events  
• BCVA  
• Anterior segment biomicroscopy  
• Ophthalmoscopy  
• Vital signs (heart rate and blood pressure)  
• Intraocular pressure

Statistical Methods:  
Continuous study assessments will be summarized by treatment and time point (as applicable) using 
descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum). Categorical study 
assessments will be summarized by treatment and visit (a s applicable) using frequency counts and 
percentages.  
Hypothesis:  
H01: The mean change from baseline CCT by ultrasound pachymetry in study eyes treated with netarsudil 
QD at Week 4 = 0.  
H11: The mean change from baseline CCT by ultrasound pachymetry in st udy eyes treated with netarsudil 
QD at Week 4 ≠ 0. 
H02: The mean change from baseline CCT by ultrasound pachymetry in study eyes treated with netarsudil 
BID at Week 4 = 0.  
H12: The mean change from baseline CCT by ultrasound pachymetry in study eyes treate d with netarsudil 
BID at Week 4 ≠ 0. 
Analysis of Primary Endpoint:  
The primary comparisons in this trial will be within a treatment group on the mean change from baseline 
CCT to Week  4 for each of netarsudil QD and BID. The primary efficacy endpoint change  from baseline 
CCT will be summarized descriptively (n, mean, standard deviation, median, min, and max) and analyzed 
primarily using one -sample t -tests; comparisons between treatment groups will be completed using two -
sample t -tests. Sensitivity analyses w ill be completed using Wilcoxon signed -rank tests within a treatment 
group, Wilcoxon rank sum tests between treatment groups and an ANCOVA model with terms for baseline 
CCT value and treatment. The least squares mean will be presented for each treatment gr oup from the model 
together with two -sided p -values and 90% and 95% confidence intervals around the change from baseline 
within each treatment group.  Comparisons between treatment groups on the change from baseline CCT will 
also be made including the leas t squares mean difference and corresponding two -sided p -values and 90% and 
95% confidence intervals.  
The primary analysis will use the modified Intent to Treat (mITT), population with available data per subject. 
Robustness analyses will also be presented b ased on the multiple imputation methodology under different 
assumptions of missingness (at random and not at random), using last observation carried forward (LOCF), 
and using the per protocol population with available data per subject.  
Intercurrent events will be primary handled in the following manner:  
• Discontinuation of study medication and non -optimal compliance will be ignored [treatment policy 
strategy].  
• Withdrawal due to lack of efficacy or adverse events: missing data will be singly imputed as the wo rst 
within subject observation prior to the intercurrent event [hypothetical strategy].  
• Missing data without withdrawal or withdrawal due to reasons other than lack of efficacy or adverse 
events: missing data will be imputed employing Multiple Imputation ( MI) using randomized treatment -
based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology to impute non -monotone missing data and 
regression methodology to impute monotone missing data [hypothetical strategy].

Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. Frequencies and percentages of 
treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized at the subject level by system organ class 
and preferred term for all TEAEs, tre atment related TEAEs, serious TEAEs, and TEAEs causing premature 
discontinuation by treatment group. An AE is treatment emergent if it occurs or worsens after the first dose 
of study medication. Similar summaries will be presented for all TEAEs by maximal severity. Separate 
summaries will be performed for ocular and non -ocular AEs. Other safety endpoints including visual acuity, 
anterior segment biomicroscopy, intraocular pressure, ophthalmoscopy, and vital signs will be summarized 
by treatment group and vi sit using descriptive statistics. Changes or shifts from baseline will also be 
summarized where appropriate. For assessments performed by eye, study eye and fellow eye will be 
summarized separately.

    1. INTRODUCTION  
Fuchs Corneal Dystrophy (FCD) is a slowly progressing disease of the cornea that is the 
most common indication for corneal -endothelial transplants worldwide ( Gain 2016 ). 
FCD  is characterized by corneal edema and the presence of guttae, which are collagenous 
excrescences of Descemet’s membrane ( McL aren 2014 ). As FCD progresses, 
corneal -endothelial cell degeneration compromises the ability of the cornea to pump out 
excess fluid resulting in corneal edema and clouding ( Okumura 2018 ). Patients with FDC 
typically present with glare, blurry vision, and a  hazy cornea. Decreased visual acuity may be 
more pronounced in the morning due to increased corneal hydration that occurs from closed 
eyelids overnight. In later stages of the disease, edema may reach the corneal epithelium 
leading to an irregular surface  and painful bullae ( Moshirfar 2020 ).  
Currently, the only definitive treatment option for FCD is surgery, and endothelial 
keratoplasty using donor corneas is the gold standard. A newer surgical procedure, called 
Descemet Stripping Only (DSO) or Descemetor hexis Without Endothelial Keratoplasty 
(DWEK), is available for select patients and does not require donor corneal tissue. 
Despite  recent improvements in surgical techniques, there are still many risks associated with 
these procedures including infection, cataract formation, secondary ocular hypertension 
(OHT) from long term steroid use, graft rejection, and treatment failure requiring a second 
surgery ( Moshirfar 2020 ). Therefore, there is a large unmet medical need for pharmacologic 
alternatives  to surgery for treating FCD ( Koizumi 2014 ).  
Netarsudil is a novel Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor that was approved for marketing as 
Rhopressa® (netarsudil ophthalmic solution) 0.02% by the US FDA in December 2017 for 
the reduction of elevated intraocular pr essure in patients with open -angle glaucoma or OHT.  
In addition to lowering intraocular pressure, ROCK inhibitors, such as netarsudil, may also 
have potential benefit for the treatment of corneal endothelial decompensation. Although the 
mechanisms are sti ll being elucidated, preclinical evidence is emerging that ROCK inhibition 
can promote adhesion, enhance proliferation, and inhibit apoptosis of corneal -endothelial 
cells ( Okumura 2009, Okumura 2017 ). Findings from a clinical case series suggest that 
topic al administration of the ROCK inhibitor Y -27632 after performing transcorneal freezing 
can improve central corneal edema in patients with FCD ( Okumura 2013 ). In one patient, 
full corneal transparency was achieved for more than 6  years, and original plans f or corneal 
transplantation were cancelled ( Koizumi 2013, Okumura 2018 ). An additional two case 
reports of patients with FCD have described improvements in corneal edema and corneal 
endothelial cell counts with the use of netarsudil following DSO ( Ploysanga m 2019, 
Hirabayashi 2020 ). Several clinical trials are now ongoing to investigate ROCK inhibition in 
both pre -surgical ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and post -surgical ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) FCD patients.  
Overall, net arsudil is well tolerated, and the most common adverse event is conjunctival 
hyperemia. Several case reports of honeycomb or reticular edema have been observed in 
patients taking netarsudil, both with and without pre -existing corneal edema or a history of

    FCD ( Fernandez 2018, Liu 2019, Moumneh 2020, Wisely 2020 ). Typically, reticular or 
honeycomb edema resolves after discontinuation of netarsudil.  
The aim of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic potential of netarsudil as a pharmacologic 
agent to delay or prevent the need for surgery in patients with visually significant edema due 
to FCD.  
2. STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary Objective(s)  
To evaluate the reduction in central corneal thickness (CCT) in eyes dosed with either 
netarsudil once -daily (QD), or netarsudil t wice -daily (BID) for the treatment of corneal 
edema due to Fuchs corneal dystrophy (FCD) . 
2.2 Secondary Objective(s)  
(1) To evaluate the proportion of subjects demonstrating improvement in vision following 
treatment for FCD with netarsudil QD or netarsudil BID . 
(2) To evaluate the safety of netarsudil QD and netarsudil BID in subjects with FCD.  
3. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is an 8 -week, randomized, open -label, multicenter, efficacy and safety study in subjects 
with FCD. The study will  be conducted at approximately 20 sites in the USA. Two different 
dosing regimens (QD and BID) of netarsudil  will be investigated for their efficacy in 
reducing or resolving corneal edema in subjects with FCD. Subjects randomized to the 
netarsudil QD dosin g regimen will be instructed to instill one drop of the Study Artificial 
Tear in their study eye every morning, and one drop of netarsudil in their study eye every 
evening. Subjects randomized to the netarsudil BID dosing regimen will instill one drop of 
netarsudil in their study eye every morning and evening.  
CCT will be measured by ultrasound pachymetry at approximately the same time of day 
± 60 minutes and always before noon (local time), at each of the 5 scheduled visits 
(Screening , Baseline [Day  1], Week  2, Week  4, and Week  8/Exit). In order to be eligible to 
participate in the study, subjects will have been diagnosed with visually significant central 
corneal edema due to FCD, in at least one eye, for no longer than 12 months’ durati on.  
At the Screening Visit, the subject’s diagnosis of FCD will be confirmed and CCT measured 
using an ultrasonic pachymeter. Intraocular pressure (IOP) and Best Corrected Visual Acuity 
(BCVA) will also be collected.

Clinical Study Protocol: AR -13324 -CS210, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
 
   
Confidential  Page 18 of 55  
    At the Baseline Visit (Day  1), the eli gibility assessments conducted during Screening will be 
repeated to ensure that the subject meets all criteria for enrollment in the study. The same eye 
must qualify at both the Screening and Baseline Visit. If qualified, the subject will be 
provided with the Visual Function and Corneal Health Status (V -FUCHS) patient reported 
visual disability questionnaire ( Wacker 2018 ). The subject will be randomized (1:1) into the 
study and provided with study medication. Subjects randomized to the netarsudil QD dosing 
regimen will be instructed to instill one drop of the Study Artificial Tear in the study eye 
every morning, and one drop of netarsudil in the study eye every evening. Subjects 
randomized to the netarsudil BID dosing regimen will instill one drop of netarsu dil in the 
study eye every morning and evening. The subject will also be trained on appropriate 
techniques for applying eye drops.  
At the Week 2 and Week 4 Visits, the subject will return to the study site for efficacy and 
safety assessments.  
At the Week  4 Visit, any subject randomized to netarsudil QD who, in the opinion of the 
Investigator, has not responded adequately to treatment, may have their netarsudil dosing 
frequency increased to BID for the remainder of the study. For these subjects, the morning  
administration of Study Artificial Tear will be terminated.  
At the Week  8 Visit, a final assessment of efficacy and safety parameters will be conducted, 
and the subject will exit the study.  
For analysis purposes, the study eye will be defined as the eli gible eye with a Baseline CCT 
of at least 600 μm, as assessed by ultrasound pachymetry. If both eyes qualify at both the 
Screening and Baseline Visit based on CCT and enrollment criteria, the study eye will be the 
eye with the thinner cornea at the Baselin e Visit.   
3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group  
Current treatment options for FCD include hyperosmotic saline ophthalmic drops/ointments 
and surgical procedures. Hyperosmotic saline can provide temporary symptomatic relief by 
facilitating corneal d ehydration. Endothelial keratoplasty using donor corneas is currently the 
gold standard therapeutic option to restore vision in patients with FCD. Although 
improvement of surgical techniques has enabled less invasive treatment and better outcomes, 
corneal transplants require long -term steroid use and are still associated with difficult 
surgical techniques, graft rejection, acute/chronic cell loss, and worldwide donor cornea 
shortages ( Okumura 2017 ). A relatively new non -transplant surgical procedure known a s 
Descemet Stripping Only (DSO) or Descemetorhexis Without Endothelial Keratoplasty 
(DWEK) is also now available for a minority of FCD patients.  
A pharmacologic alternative to surgery in patients with FCD would be very beneficial, 
even  if pharmacologic tre atment only delays the need for surgery.

    This study is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of netarsudil for the treatment of 
FCD and to enable optimal study design for further clinical development. The optimal dosing 
regimen will provide maxi mum reduction in corneal edema due to FCD with minimal 
adverse effects.  
It should be noted that, since FCD is a slowly progressing disease, surgery is rarely urgent, 
and patients are often seen multiple times before undergoing surgery. Therefore, an 
appro ximate 8 to 9 -week delay in surgery for participation in this study is acceptable.  
3.3 Study Duration  
The expected duration of subject participation is approximately 8 to 9 weeks. This includes a 
screening period of up to 8 days, followed by a treatment period  of 8 weeks.

    5. STUDY  TREATMENTS  
5.1 Description of Treatments  
5.1.1 Study Medication  
Netarsudil is a ROCK inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the 
treatment of OHT and open -angle glaucoma.   
Netarsudil 0.02 % ophthalmic solution is supplied as a sterile, isotonic, buffered aqueous 
solution of netarsudil dimesylate with a pH of approximately 5 and an osmolality of 
approximately 295 mOsmol/kg. It is intended for topical application in the eye. Each mL 
contains 0.2 mg of netarsudil (equivalent to 0.28 mg of netarsudil dimesylate). Benzalkonium 
chloride, 0.015%, is added as a preservative. The inactive ingredients are boric acid, 
mannitol, sodium hydroxide to adjust pH, and water for injection.  
5.1.2 Placebo or Control Drug  
A Study Artificial Tear will be provided to subjects randomized to the QD dosing regimen. 
These subjects will be instructed to instill one drop of the Study Artificial Tear every 
morning.  
The Study Artificial Tear will be REFRESH PLUS® (preservative -free) Lubricant Eye 
Drops. The active ingredient is carboxymethylcellulose sodium (0.5%), and the inactive 
ingredients are calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, purified water, 
sodium chloride, and sodium lactate. The solution may also contain hydrochloric acid and/or 
sodium hydroxide to adjust pH.  
5.2 Treatments Administered  
Subjects will be randomized using a 1:1 allocation ratio to one of two treatment groups:  
• Once Daily Netarsudil Dosing Regimen  
Study Artificial Tear; one drop, in the st udy eye in the morning  
Netarsudil 0.02% ophthalmic solution; one drop, in the study eye in the evening  
• Twice Daily Netarsudil Dosing Regimen  
Netarsudil 0.02% ophthalmic solution; one drop, in the study eye in the morning and 
in the evening  
Doses will be s elf-administered by the study subjects. If the subject is using any another 
topical ophthalmic drop (e.g., ocular hypotensive medications) at the same time as netarsudil, 
the subject should be instructed to instill netarsudil first, and wait at least 15 mi nutes before 
instilling any additional drops.

5.6.2 Permitted Interventions  
Therapy considered necessary for t he subject’s welfare may be g iven at the discretion of the 
Investigator. If the use of a s pecific therapy or intervention is in question, please contact 
Aerie. 
Any systemic medication not itemized as an exclusion in Section  4.3 (i.e., oral carbonic 
anhydrase inhibitors or systemic corticosteroids) will be permi tted.  
Any topical ophthalmic medicati on not itemized as an exclusion in Section 4.3 
(i.e., hypertonic saline, ophthal mic carbonic anhydrase inhibit ors, or ophthalmic 
corticosteroids in the study eye ) will be permitted. Ocular hyp otensive medications will be 
permitted, however, a history of s evere or difficult to treat ( i.e., requiring ≥3 ocular 
hypotensive medications) glaucoma  (open- or closed- angle) or O HT will exclude a subject 
from participation in this study. Fixed dose combination medications will be considered as 
two medications. If multiple topical ophthalmic medications are  needed at the same time, 
subjects should be instructed to always instill netarsudil firs t and wait at least 15 minutes 
before instilling any additional drops. 
The intermittent use of artific ial tears will be permitted. How ever, subjects must use the 
(Aerie supplied) Protocol Approve d Artificial Tear (REFRESH PLU S® [preservative-free]). 
The Protocol Approved Artificial Tear may be used, as needed, u p to four times daily (QID) 
in either eye. If the subject intends on using the Protocol App roved Artificial Tear at the 
same time as their schedule d netarsudil dose, they should be in structed to instill netarsudil 
first and wait a minimum of 15 minutes before instilling the Pr otocol Approved Artificial 
Tear. Any medication taken during the  study between the date of the first dose of randomized 
study medication and the date of the Week 8/Exit Visit or Early  Termination Visit should be 
recorded in the eCRF as a concomitant medication.  
5.7 Restrictions 
5.7.1 Prior Therapy 
Prior use of netarsudil (monothe rapy or in combination) will ex clude the patient from

    The study medication, Study Artificial Tears, and Protocol Approved Artificial Tears will be 
stored in a secure area under the appropriate physical conditions for the product. Access to 
the study medication, Study Artificial Tears, and Protocol Approved Artificial Tears will be 
limited to authorized site staff only. The study medication and artificial tears will be stored as 
directed on the label. Netarsudil should be stored refrigerated (2°C to 8°C / 36°F to 46°F) 
and protected from light. Study Artificial Tears and Protocol Approved Artificial Tears will 
be stored between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F). Temperature of the study medication 
storage locations at the site is to be monitored using a calibrated monitoring device and 
documented.  
At time of dispensing, the subject will be instructed to store the bottle(s) as directed on the 
label. Once the netarsudil bottle is opened, the product must always be stored refrigerated 
and protected from light. It is recommended that the product is stored in the carton provided.  
5.11 Study Medication Retention at Study Site  
5.11.1  Receipt and Disposition of Study Medication  
Study medication and artificial tears (Study Artificial Tears and Protocol Approved Artificial 
Tears) will be shipped to the Investigator’s site from a central depot. A study staff member at 
the Investigator’s site will verify study medication shipment records by comparing  the 
shipping documentation accompanying the study medication to the study medication 
received at the Investigator’s site. If a discrepancy is noted, the appropriate individual at the 
Sponsor or designee must be notified immediately. The responsible person  (e.g., study 
coordinator) at the Investigator’s institution has to account for all used, partially used, and 
unused study medication and artificial tears. The responsible person will also maintain the 
study medication accountability records.  
5.11.2  Return of Stu dy Medication  
When the site is closed, the study is completed or is terminated by the Sponsor; all study 
material including used and unused study medication and artificial tears will be returned to 
the Sponsor’s designee. All study medication accounting pr ocedures must be completed 
before the study is considered to be concluded. The responsible person at the Investigator’s 
institution has to account for all used, partially used and unused study medication and 
artificial tears. The monitor will complete a st udy medication returns form or equivalent that 
will be signed by the Investigator or designee prior to returning the used and unused study 
medication and artificial tears to the Sponsor’s designee.

    6. STUDY  PROCEDURES  
6.1 Informed Consent  
Prior to any study proc edures in the treatment period, the study will be discussed with each 
subject. Subjects wishing to participate must give written informed consent. The verbal 
explanation of the study will cover all the elements specified in the written information 
provided  for the subject. The Investigator will inform the subject of the aims, methods, 
anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the study, including any discomfort it may 
entail. The subject must be given every opportunity to clarify any points he/she does not 
understand and, if necessary, may ask for more information. At the end of the interview, the 
subject should be given time to reflect. Subjects and/or legally authorized representative then 
will be required to sign and date the informed consent form. Th e completion of this process 
should be documented in the source documents.  
The informed consent form must have received approval/favorable review by a properly 
constituted Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) prior to 
use. A c opy of the signed and dated consent document will be given to each subject. 
The original signed and dated informed consent document must be maintained in the study 
files at the Investigator’s site.  
The Investigator or staff is responsible for ensuring that no subject undergoes any study 
related examination or activity before the subject has given written informed consent. 
It should be emphasized that the subject is at liberty to withdraw consent to participate at any 
time, without penalty or lo ss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled. Subjects 
who refuse to give, or withdraw, written informed consent may not be included or continued 
in this study, and should be notified that discontinuation from the study will not impact on 
their subsequent care.  
6.2 Demographics and Medical/Ophthalmic History  
Demographic data will be collected and recorded at the Screening Visit. Significant, relevant 
(to the condition under investigation) medical/ophthalmic history will also be collected at 
Screeni ng and Baseline. Any current underlying medical conditions, including those that 
began within the last 30 days and which may have resolved before screening, must be 
recorded. In addition, prior treatments for FCD should be recorded. Any medications the 
subject took but discontinued within the 30 days prior to screening also will be recorded as 
part of the medical history.  
6.3 Concomitant Medication Assessments  
Use of any medication, prescription or over -the-counter (OTC), should be recorded at the 
Screening Vis it, and captured on the appropriate eCRF, and the indication noted as part of 
the medical history. Treatments that are permitted to continue throughout the duration of the 
study will be recorded as concomitant medications at all subsequent visits. Judgment  of

    continued study participation by the subject, and inclusion of this subject’s subsequent visits 
in the safety and efficacy analysis will be made by the Investigator.  
All medications which the subject has taken within 30 days prior to screening and duri ng the 
study will be recorded in the eCRF. The name of the drug, dose, route of administration, 
duration of treatment and indication will be recorded for each medication. For combination 
products (e.g., CONTAC®), the brand name is required. For non -combina tion products, the 
generic name is preferred. The use of routine ophthalmic diagnostic pharmaceutical agents 
(e.g., fluorescein) will be allowed, and individual documentation not required. Any change in 
dosing parameters should also be recorded in the eCRF . 
6.4 Vital Signs (HR and BP only)  
Subject heart rate and blood pressure will be measured at the Screening, Baseline, and 
Week  8/Exit Visits. Heart rate will be determined only once during these study visits by the 
method described in the Study Procedure Manua l. 
Blood pressure will be measured once for each subject after the subject heart rate has been 
determined, with the subject in a sitting position. A mechanical or digital 
sphygmomanometer may be used, but effort should be made to use the same instrument an d 
the same arm of the subject for each reading. Please refer to the Study Procedure Manual for 
more details.  
6.5 Pregnancy Testing  
A urine pregnancy test will be conducted at the Baseline Visit and the Week 8/Exit Visit for 
all females of child -bearing potenti al. A female of child -bearing potential is defined as an 
adult woman unless she is 1 -year post -menopausal or 3 months post -surgical sterilization. 
Any female who is pregnant, nursing, planning a pregnancy, or not using a medically 
acceptable form of birth control will be excluded from the study. All females of childbearing 
potential must have a negative pregnancy test result at the Baseline Visit to be enrolled and 
must not intend to become pregnant during the study.  
6.6 Dispensing Study Medication  
Study staff responsible for dispensing the study medication will be listed on the Delegation 
of Responsibilities Log. When a subject meets all criteria for selection and has completed all 
screening assessments, the subject will be assigned to a treatment group accordi ng to the 
IRT. 
Study medication, Study Artificial Tears (for subjects randomized to the QD dosing 
regimen), and Protocol Approved Artificial Tears will be dispensed at the Baseline Visit. 
Additional  study medication, Study Artificial Tears (for subjects ra ndomized to the QD 
dosing regimen), and Protocol Approved Artificial Tears (if needed) will be dispensed at the 
Week 4 Visit.

    The responsible study staff will account for used and unused study medication and artificial 
tears by maintaining a study medica tion accountability log.  
6.7 Efficacy Assessments  
6.7.1 Ultrasound Pachymetry  
CCT will be measured at each visit at approximately the same time of day ± 60 minutes and 
always before noon (local time). Every effort should be made to use the same instrument for 
each r eading. For more details, please refer to the Study Procedure Manual.  
6.7.2 Best Corrected Visual Acuity (ETDRS Method)  
At each visit, BCVA should be measured using the ETDRS method, following manifest 
refraction, and prior to the slit lamp examination. Please r efer to the BCVA Procedure 
Manual for the BCVA Worksheet and more details.  
6.7.3 Biomicroscopy  
External magnification and biomicroscopy will be performed using a slit -lamp. 
Magnification will be consistent with standard clinical practice. The subject will be s eated.  
The following will be examined:  
• Eyelid  
• Cornea  
• Conjunctiva  
• Anterior Chamber  
• Iris 
• Lens  
For more details, please refer to the Study Procedure Manual.  
6.7.4 V-FUCHS Questionnaire  
The Visual Function and Corneal Health Status (V -FUCHS) patient reported visual disability 
questionnaire will be administered at the Baseline, Week  4, and Week  8 Visits 
(Wacker  2018 ). Subjects who are not fluent in the English language may be exempt from 
completing this questionnaire. Please refer to the Study Procedur e Manual for the full

Tomography assessments using a Pentacam® will be performed at selected sites only. 
Please  refer to the Study Procedure Manual for more details.    
6.8 Safety Assessments  
6.8.1 IOP 
At each visit, IOP will be measured using an Applanation Tonometer.  
6.8.2 Ophthalmoscopy  
Indirect ophthalmoscopy will be performed with pupil dilation at the Screening and 
Week  8/Exit Visits and without dilation at all other visits. The Investigator will make 
observations of the vitreous, retina, macula, choroid and optic nerve.  Please refer to the Study 
Procedure Manual for more details.  
6.9 Adverse Events Assessments  
6.9.1 Performing Adverse Eve nt (AE) Assessments  
Qualified study staff responsible for assessing AEs will be listed on the Site Authorization 
and Delegation Log. This includes assessment of AE severity and relationship to the study 
medication. AE information may be volunteered by the subject or solicited by study 
personnel through non -leading questions.  
All AEs occurring during the study, regardless of the assumption of causal relationship, must 
be documented on the respective electronic case report form (eCRF). Adverse events should 
be documented from the time the subject signs the informed consent until the subject’s last 
study visit. If an event occurs during the washout period (prior to subject enrollment and the 
administration of study medication), it should be recorded as an AE. A ny medical condition 
present prior to administration of the study medication which remains unchanged or 
improved should not be recorded as an AE at subsequent visits.  
If a subject has an ongoing AE at the time of study completion, the ongoing AE must be 
followed -up and provided appropriate medical care until the event has resolved or stabilized, 
the subject is lost to follow -up, or there is other resolution to the event.  
Documentation of AEs/adverse reactions includes start date and stop date, severity, act ion(s) 
taken, seriousness and outcome.  
Investigators are also asked to note all observations of new or worsening conjunctival 
hyperemia on the biomicroscopy eCRF as well as on the study AE form  if deemed necessary 
(per Investigator discretion) .

Confidential  Page 31 of 55  
    The followi ng definitions of terms apply to this section:  
• Adverse event (AE). Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug 
in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
• Suspected adverse reaction (SAR). Any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘‘reasonable 
possibility’’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug  
and the AE. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
• Life-threatening AE or life -threatening SAR. An AE or SAR is considered 
“life-threatening” if, in the v iew of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence 
places the patient at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or SAR that, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Serious adverse event (SAE) or serious suspected  adverse reaction (SSAR). An AE or 
SAR is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, 
it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life -threatening AE, patient 
hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitali zation, a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, 
be life-threatening, or require hospitali zation may be considered serious when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events inclu de allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in patient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
• Unexpected AE or unexpected SAR. An AE or SAR is considered ‘‘unexpected’’ if it is 
not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB), the Package Insert, or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed. For example, under this definition, hepatic 
necrosis would be unexpe cted (by virtue of greater severity) if the IB referred only to 
elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral 
vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the IB listed only 
cerebral vascula r accidents. “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or 
SARs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated 
from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as 
occur ring with the particular drug under investigation.

    6.9.2 Timing  
The AEs occurring during the study must be documented, regardless of the assumption of a 
causal relationship. AEs should be documented from the time the subject signs and dates the 
patient consent f orm until subject participation in the study has been completed. If a subject 
has one or more ongoing AEs at the time of study completion, the subject should be followed 
and provided appropriate medical care until the event is resolved or stabilized, the s ubject is 
lost to follow -up, or there is other resolution to the event. These follow -up visits will be 
documented.  
When recording an AE, the following information should be provided on the study AE 
eCRF:  
1. Action  Taken with Study Medication:  
• None  
• Study Medic ation Interrupted  
• Study Medication Discontinued  
2. Other Action Taken:  
• None  
• Non-Drug Therapy  
• New OTC or Rx Drug Added  
• Hospitalized less than 24 hours  
• Hospitalized greater than or equal to 24 hours  
3. Outcome of an adverse event is coded as:  
• Fatal  
• Not Recovere d/Not Resolved  
• Recovered/Resolved  
• Recovered/Resolved with sequelae  
• Recovering/Resolving  
• Unknown/Lost to follow -up

    6.9.3 Severity  
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the level of discomfort or the 
degree of intensity of an AE as determined by the Investigator or reported to him/her by the 
subject. The assessment of severity is made irrespective of study medication relationship or 
seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale:  
1 = Mild: present a nd noticeable, but not distressing, and no disruption of normal daily 
activities.  
2 = Moderate: bothersome, discomfort sufficient to possibly reduce or affect normal daily 
activity.  
3 = Severe: incapacitating, with inability to work or perform normal daily  activity.  
A change in increased severity for a reported AE will require a stop date for the previous 
severity and a new start and stop date for the new severity. For example, a change in severity 
may go from mild to severe or from moderate to severe. In b oth cases, the start and stop dates 
should be recorded.  
Note: A severe AE is not the same as a serious AE. Seriousness of an AE (NOT severity) 
serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations (see Section 6.9.6  for further 
information on serious AEs [SAEs]).  
6.9.4 Relationship  
The study medication relationship for each AE/adverse reaction should be determined by the 
Investigator using these explanations:  
• Not R elated : The event is clearly related to other factors such as subject’s clinical 
condition; therapeutic interventions, concomitant disease or therapy administered to the 
subject and does not follow a known response pattern to the product.  
• Unlikely Related : The event is most probably caused by other etiologies such as 
participant’s underlying condition, therapeutic intervention, or concomitant therapy; or 
the delay between administration and the onset of the AE is incompatible with a causal 
relations hip. Therefore, there is not a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by 
the study medication.  
• Possibly Related : The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of 
study medication administration and/or follows a known response patte rn to the study 
medication, but could have been produced by other factors such as the subject’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant therapy administered to the subject.  
• Related : The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from th e time of study 
medication administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study

    medication and cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as subject’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant therapy administered to  the subject, and 
either occurs immediately following study medication administration, or improves on 
stopping the study medication, or reappears on repeat exposure, or there is a positive 
reaction at the application site.  
6.9.5 Expectedness  
An AE or suspected a dverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the IB or 
is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. “Unexpected,” as used in 
this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are  mentioned 
in the IB as occurring with this class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological 
properties of netarsudil, and are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the study 
medication. The AEs and adverse reactions that are both unexpecte d and serious should be 
reported in an expedited fashion to the Sponsor (see Section 6.9.6  for further details).  
6.9.6 Serious Adverse Events, Suspected Serious Adverse Re actions or Suspected 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
6.9.6.1  Reporting SAEs, SSARs or SUSARs  
An Investigator must immediately (i.e., within 24 hours) report any SAE, SSAR or SUSAR 
to the Sponsor using the SAE report form, whether or not considered medication -related, 
including those listed in the IB, and must include an assessment of whether there is a 
reasonable possibility that the medication caused the event. In addition, in the case of 
immediately life -threatening AEs or AEs with fatal outcome, or SUSARs, the Investigator 
must inform the Sponsor by phone within 24 hours of observation or occurrence of the SAE.  
The Investigator must report any SAE, SSAR, or SUSAR that occurs during the course of the 
study or within 4 weeks of last study visit. In case of inc omplete information, the Investigator 
must provide follow -up information as soon as possible, again using the SAE report form.  
SAEs, SSARs, and SUSARs must be reported to the IRB/IEC according to the IRB/IEC 
requirements.

    6.9.7 Pregnancy Reporting  
Pregnancies occurring in subjects in this study , occurring up to the subject’s last study visit, 
must be reported and followed to outcome.  Information on pregnant partners will not be 
collected.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, pregnancy reports are tracked 
by Covance and  the study Medical Monitor. Premature terminations including miscarriage, 
spontaneous abortion, or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be 
reported as an SAE. Other pregnancy complications should be reported as SAEs, if they meet 
serious criteria. Should a pregnancy result in a congenital anomaly or birth defect, a separate 
SAE report must be submitted for the baby. Furthermore, all neonatal deat hs that occur 
within 30 days of the birth should be reported as SAEs, without regard to causality.  
The Investigator must complete the pregnancy report form and email the form to the study 
Safety Mailbox  within 1 business day of knowledge of the pregnancy. Following delivery or 
termination of pregnancy, the updated or follow -up pregnancy report form is to be completed 
and submitted by fax or email to the Safety Mailbox  for the study.  
6.10 Removal of Subjects from the Study or Study Medication  
Subjects may be discontinued from the study at any time for any reason. Participation is 
entirely voluntary, and only possible if the subject has signed informed consent. Consent may 
be withdrawn at any time.  
6.10.1  Completed Subject  
A completed subject is defined as one who com pletes all planned study treatments and visits.  
6.10.2  Non-completing Subject  
A non -completing subject is defined as one who exits the study by their own volition or at 
the discretion of the Investigator, the Medical Monitor, and/or an Aerie Safety 
Officer/designee. Any subject may decide to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time 
without prejudice. If discontinuation of treatment is necessary, the Investigator will make 
every attempt to complete all subsequent safety assessments listed for t he Week 8 / Early 
Termination Visit.  
The subject may also be discontinued from the study for the following reasons:  
• AEs (including intercurrent diseases reported by the subject or observed by the 
Investigator with documentation on the CRF)  
• Withdrawal of Consent  
• Non-compliance (e.g., non -adherence to scheduled follow -up visits or use of study 
treatment)

• Pregnancy  
• Investigator Decision  
• Protocol Deviation  
• Death  
• Other  
6.10.3  Actions after Discontinuation  
All subjects who discontinue study t reatment due to a report of an AE must be followed and 
provided appropriate medical care until their signs and symptoms have remitted or stabilized.  
For subjects who choose to withdraw consent or who are discontinued for non -compliance 
prior to completing  the study, every possible effort should be made by the Investigator to 
assure there is a final visit that includes all examinations listed for the Week 8 / Early 
Termination Visit.  
6.10.4  Discontinuation of the Entire Study  
The entire study may be discontinued a t a given site (by the Investigator or Aerie /Aerie 
representative) or at all sites by Aerie. Prompt, written notice of reasonable cause to all other 
relevant parties (Aerie or Investigator) is required. Prompt notice to the IRB and to 
regulatory authoriti es is also required.  
6.10.5  Completed Study  
The study is completed when the planned enrollment has been completed, and all the 
enrolled subjects have completed the study. An Aerie representative will be in 
communication with the investigational sites regarding enrollment.  
6.11 Appropriateness of Measurements  
The ophthalmic and systemic measures included in this study are consistent with standard of 
care.

participation in the study.  
7.2.5 Unscheduled Visits  
An unscheduled visit may be any visit to the Investigator other than the specific visits 
specified in the protocol as possibly required for the subject’s ophthalmic condition.  
The Investigator will perform all procedures necessary to evaluate the study participant at 
these visits and record any AEs in the CRF.  
8. QUALITY  CONTROL  AND  ASSURA NCE  
The progress of the study will be monitored by on -site, written, and telephone 
communications between personnel at the Investigator’s site and the Study Monitor. 
The Investigator will allow the Sponsor or designee to inspect all CRFs, subject records 
(source documents), signed consent forms, study medication records (receipt, storage, 
preparation, and disposition), and regulatory files related to this study.  
9. PLANNED  STATISTICAL  METHODS  
9.1 General Considerations  
Continuous study assessments will be summariz ed by treatment and time point 
(as applicable) using descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, 
and maximum). Categorical study assessments will be summarized by treatment and visit 
(as applicable) using frequency counts and perc entages. Hypothesis testing, unless otherwise 
indicated, will be performed at a 2 -sided 0.10 significance level. Where applicable, 2 -sided 
90% and 95% CIs will be reported. All p -values will be displayed to four decimal places, 
with p -values less than 0.00 01 presented as '<0.0001' and p -values greater than 0.9999 
presented as ‘>0.9999’. Difference between netarsudil QD and netarsudil BID will be 
calculated as netarsudil QD – netarsudil BID.

Confidential  Page 41 of 55  
    All study data will be listed by treatment, subject and time point (as applicable).  
Statistical methods will be more fully described in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan.  
9.1.1 Unit of Analysis  
Safety endpoints will be analyzed for both eyes. For efficacy endpoints, the primary unit of 
analysis will be the study eye defined based on CCT of at least 600  μm evaluated by 
ultrasound pachymetry. If both eyes qualify based on CCT and enrollment criteria, the study 
eye will be the eye with the thinner cornea at the baseline.  Qualified fellow eyes may also be 
summarized.  
9.1.2 Missing Data and Intercurrent Events  
The primary analysis will be completed with available data per subject from the 
mITT  population. Robustness analyses will also be presented based on the multiple 
imputation methodology under different assumptions of missingness and intercurrent events 
(at random and not at random), using last observation carried forward (LOCF), and using the 
per protocol population with available data per subject.  
Intercurrent events will be primary handled in the follo wing manner:  
1. Discontinuation of study medication and non -optimal compliance will be ignored, values 
measured after discontinuation of study medication or regardless of compliance will be 
used in the analyses [treatment policy strategy].  
2. Withdrawal due to l ack of efficacy or adverse events: missing data will be singly imputed 
as the worst within subject observation prior to the intercurrent event [hypothetical 
strategy].  
3. Missing data without withdrawal or withdrawal due to reasons other than lack of efficacy  
or adverse events: missing data will be imputed employing Multiple Imputation (MI) 
using randomized treatment -based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology to 
impute non -monotone missing data and regression methodology to impute monotone 
missing data  [hypothetical strategy].  
9.1.3 Multiplicity Considerations  
Adjustments for multiplicity will not be made in this early phase trial.

    9.2 Hypotheses  
H01: The mean change from baseline CCT by ultrasound pachymetry in study eyes treated 
with netarsudil QD at Week 4 = 0. 
H11: The mean change from baseline CCT by ultrasound pachymetry in study eyes treated 
with netarsudil QD at Week 4 ≠ 0. 
H02: The mean change from baseline CCT by ultrasound pachymetry in study eyes treated 
with netarsudil BID at Week 4 = 0.  
H12: The m ean change from baseline CCT by ultrasound pachymetry in study eyes treated 
with netarsudil BID at Week 4 ≠ 0. 
9.3 Determination of Sample Size  
This study is not powered to detect a pre -stated efficacy signal, but rather will be used to 
inform the design and p ower for any possible future studies.  With a sample size of up -to 
20 subjects per treatment group, the precision of the point estimate of mean change from 
baseline in CCT, as measured by the half -width of the two -sided 90% confidence interval 
(CI), will b e approximately 1/2.7 of the standard deviation (SD) of the change from baseline, 
yielding 90% confidence that the true mean change from baseline is within ± SD/2.7 µm of 
the observed mean change from baseline.  That is, if the SD of the change from baseli ne is 
60 µm, then the half -width of the two -sided 90% CI would be 60 µm x 1/2.7 = 22.2 µm, 
yielding 90% confidence that the true mean change from baseline is within ± 22.2 µm of the 
observed mean change from baseline.  
With a sample size of up -to 20 subjec ts within a treatment group, the study will have 80% 
power to reject H 01 or H 02 and in favor of H 11 or H 12 respectively and demonstrate a 
statistically significant mean change from baseline, assuming the true effect size 
(mean  change / SD) is 0.577 or larg er (e.g., assuming the true mean change from baseline is 
34.6 µm and the standard deviation is 60 µm), a one sample t -test and a two -sided alpha  
= 0.10.  
With a sample size of up -to 20 subjects per treatment group, the study will have 95% 
confidence of ruli ng out AEs with true incidence rates of 13.9% or higher within each 
treatment group.  That is, with up -to 20 subjects in a treatment group, if an AE of a specific 
type is not observed, then with 95% confidence, the true incidence rate of that adverse event  
is less than 13.9%.  
Similarly, with a sample size of up -to 40 subjects combined over treatment groups, the study 
will have 95% confidence of ruling out AEs with true incidence rates of 7.2% or higher 
within each treatment group.  That is, with up -to 40 su bjects in a treatment group, if an AE of 
a specific type is not observed, then with 95% confidence, the true incidence rate of that 
adverse event is less than 7.2%.

    9.4 Analysis Populations  
9.4.1 Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population  
The mITT population will in clude all randomized subjects who have received at least one 
dose of study medication. This population will be the primary population for efficacy 
analyses and will be used to summarize a subset of efficacy variables and will summarize 
subjects as randomiz ed. 
9.4.2 Per Protocol (PP) Population  
The PP population is a subset of the mITT population, which will include those subjects 
(and their visits) who do not have major protocol deviations likely to seriously affect the 
primary outcome of the study. This population will be the secondary population for efficacy 
analyses and will be used to summarize a subset of efficacy variables. If the  PP and mITT 
populations are exactly the same, then additional efficacy analyses on the PP population will 
not be performed. The PP population will summarize subjects as treated.  
9.4.3 Safety Population  
The safety population will include all randomized subjects who have received at least one 
dose of investigational product. This population will be used to summarize safety variables 
and will summarize subjects as treated.  
9.5 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics such as ag e, gender, race, and ethnicity will be 
summarized and listed. Medical history, history of ocular surgery and procedures will also be 
summarized and listed.  
9.6 Subject Disposition  
Subject disposition will be presented in terms of the numbers and percentages of  subjects 
who completed the study and discontinued from the study. Disposition will be summarized 
by treatment group and for all subjects.  
The number of randomized subjects in each of the analysis populations (mITT, PP, and 
Safety) will be displayed by tre atment.  
The number and percentage of subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study and the 
reasons for study discontinuation will be summarized by treatment group for all subjects.

    9.7 Primary Endpoint(s)  
9.8 Efficacy Analysis  
9.8.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The p rimary efficacy endpoint is the mean change from baseline in mean CCT as assessed by 
ultrasound pachymetry at Week 4.  
9.8.2 Primary Efficacy Analyses  
The primary comparisons in this trial will be within a treatment group on the mean change 
from baseline CCT to W eek 4/Day 28 (Visit 4) for each of netarsudil QD and BID. 
The primary efficacy endpoint change from baseline CCT will be summarized descriptively 
(n, mean, standard deviation, median, min, and max) and analyzed primarily using one -
sample t -tests; compariso ns between treatment groups will be completed using two -sample 
t-tests. Sensitivity analyses will be completed using Wilcoxon signed -rank tests within a 
treatment group, Wilcoxon rank sum tests between treatment groups and an ANCOVA 
model with terms for ba seline CCT value, treatment. The least squares mean will be 
presented for each treatment group from the model together with two -sided p -values and 90 
and 95% confidence intervals around the change from baseline within each treatment group. 
Comparisons betw een treatment groups on the change from baseline CCT will also be made 
including the least squares mean difference and corresponding two -sided p -values and 90 and 
95% confidence intervals.  
The primary analysis will use the mITT population with available da ta per subject. 
Robustness analyses will also be presented based on the multiple imputation methodology 
under different assumptions of missingness and intercurrent events (at random and not at 
random), using last observation carried forward (LOCF), and usi ng the per protocol 
population with available data per subject.  
Intercurrent events will be primary handled in the following manner:  
1. Discontinuation of study medication and non -optimal compliance will be ignored, values 
measured after discontinuation of st udy medication or regardless of compliance will be 
used in the analyses [treatment policy strategy].  
2. Withdrawal due to lack of efficacy or adverse events: missing data will be singly imputed 
as the worst within subject observation prior to the intercurrent  event [hypothetical 
strategy].  
3. Missing data without withdrawal or withdrawal due to reasons other than lack of efficacy 
or adverse events: missing data will be imputed employing Multiple Imputation (MI) 
using randomized treatment -based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology to 
impute non -monotone missing data and regression methodology to impute monotone 
missing data  [hypothetical strategy].

    9.8.3 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints include:  
• Mean change from baseline in BCVA at Week 4  
• Mean change from baseline in CCT as assessed by ultrasound pachymetry at Week 8  
• Mean change from baseline in BCVA at Week 8  
• Proportion of subjects who gained ≥15 letters (3 lines) in BCVA at Week 4  
• Proportion of subjects who gained ≥15 letters (3 lines) i n BCVA at Week 8  
• Proportion of subjects with complete resolution of corneal edema at Week 4  
• Proportion of subjects with complete resolution of corneal edema at Week 8  
9.8.4 Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
The secondary efficacy analyses will be conducted in the mITT  population with available 
data per subject. Descriptive statistics will be presented by treatment group. Summarization 
and analysis of the mean change from baseline in BCVA at Weeks 4 and 8 and mean change 
from baseline in CCT by ultrasound pachymetry at Week 8 will be completed using a similar 
strategy as for the primary endpoints.   
Testing of the proportion of subjects who gained ≥15 (3 lines) in BCVA at Weeks 4 and 8 
(separately) and the proportion of subjects with complete resolution of corneal edema at 
Weeks 4 and 8 (separately) will be completed using logistic regression with fixed effects of 
treatment and corresponding baseline measure.  
The adjusted odds ratios and marginal proportions and difference in proportions along with 
corresponding two -sided 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p -values will be presented.   
Treatment comparisons will also be made using Pearson’s chi -squared test or Fisher’s exact 
test if any of the cell counts are less than five as a sensitivity analysis.  
The primary analyses of the secondary endpoints will use the mITT population with available 
data per subject. Robustness analyses may also be presented based on the multiple imputation 
methodology under different assumptions of missingness and intercurrent events (at random 
and not at random), using last observation carried forward (LOCF), and using the per 
protocol population with available data per subject.

• Mean change from baseline in CCT as assessed by Pentacam® at We ek 4 (selected sites 
only)  
• Mean change from baseline in V -FUCHS glare factor score at Week 4  
9.8.6 Exploratory Efficacy Analyses  
Exploratory endpoints will be analyzed in a similar manner as the secondary endpoints.  
9.8.7 Primary Safety Assessments and Analyses  
Adver se events (AEs) will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. Frequencies and 
percentages of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized at the 
subject level by system organ class and preferred term for all TEAEs, treatment related 
TEAEs, ser ious TEAEs, and TEAEs causing premature treatment discontinuation by 
treatment group. An AE is treatment emergent if it occurs or worsens after the first dose of 
study medication. Similar summaries will be presented for all TEAEs by maximal severity. 
Separ ate summaries will be performed for ocular and non -ocular AEs.  
Best corrected visual acuity and intraocular pressure data for both the study eye and the 
fellow eye will be summarized for each measured visit and for change from baseline to each 
post-treatm ent visit using the continuous summary statistics.  
Anterior segment biomicroscopy  and ophthalmoscopy measures will be summarized at each 
measured visit using discrete summary statistics. Additionally for anterior segment 
biomicroscopy, discrete summaries will be provided by region, finding, visit, time point, and 
eye (study eye and fel low eye) for the number of subjects with at least one severity grade 
increase from baseline and for the number of subjects judged to be clinically significant by 
the Investigator. Shift tables from baseline may also be summarized.  
Vital signs will be summa rized at each measured visit and for change from baseline to each 
measured visit using continuous summary statistics by treatment group and visit.

    10.4 Subject Information and Consent  
Written informed consent will be obtained from each subject before any  subject specific 
procedures are initiated. A copy of the signed and dated consent document will be given to 
each subject. The original signed and dated informed consent document must be maintained 
in the study files at the Investigator’s site.  
The Investi gator is responsible for ensuring that no subject is subject to any study -related 
examination or activity before that subject has given informed consent. The subject must give 
written consent after the receipt of detailed information. The verbal explanatio n will cover all 
the elements specified in the written information provided for the subject.  
It should be emphasized that the subject is at liberty to withdraw consent to participate at any 
time, without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled.  
Subjects who refuse to give, or withdraw, written informed consent may not be included or 
continued in this study, but this will not impact on their subsequent care.  
The Investigator will inform the subject of the aims, metho ds, anticipated benefits and 
potential hazards of the study, including any discomfort it may entail. The subject must be 
given every opportunity to clarify any points he/she does not understand and if necessary, ask 
for more information. At the end of the interview, the subject may be given time to reflect if 
this is required, or if the subject requests more time. Subjects and/or legal guardian will be 
required to sign and date the informed consent form.  
Signed informed consent must be attained prior to the  conductance of any study procedures.  
10.5 Subject Confidentiality  
The Investigator and his/her staff will maintain all personal subject data collected and 
processed for the purposes of this study using adequate precautions to ensure confidentiality, 
in accorda nce with local, state and federal laws and regulations.  
Monitors, auditors and other authorized representatives of the Sponsor, the IRB/IEC 
approving this study, and government regulatory authorities (e.g., FDA) may be granted 
direct access to the study su bject’s original medical and study records for verification of the 
data or clinical study procedures. Access to this information will be permitted to 
representatives of the aforementioned organizations to the extent permitted by law.  
A report of this study ’s results may be published or sent to the appropriate health authorities 
in any country in which the study medication may ultimately be marketed, but subject 
identities will not be disclosed in these documents.

    10.6 Study Monitoring  
Clinical research associate s hired or contracted by the Sponsor will be responsible for 
monitoring the study sites and study activities. Clinical research associates will contact and 
visit the Investigator regularly. The actual frequency of monitoring visits depends on subject 
enrol lment and on study site performance. Among others, the following items will be 
reviewed:  
• Study progress  
• Compliance with the protocol  
• Completion of eCRFs  
• Dispensing, storage, and accountability of study medication  
• Source data verification  
• AE and SAE reporti ng 
• Essential documents contained within the Investigator’s site file  
For source data verification (i.e., comparison of eCRF entries with subject records), data will 
be 100% source verified and will include at a minimum:  
• Subject identification  
• Informed cons ent (procedure, signature, and date)  
• Selection criteria  
• Primary efficacy and safety parameters (i.e., AEs)  
Member(s) of the Sponsor or their designee, in the role of Clinical Research Associate, will 
meet with the Investigator prior to the initiation of th e study in order to assess the adequacy 
of the Investigator's subject population, facilities, and equipment, and to familiarize the 
Investigator with the protocol.  
The Clinical Research Associate will subsequently meet with the Investigator after several o f 
the subjects have initiated the study in order to ensure that the subjects are being properly 
selected, that adequate supplies for the study have been provided and that the assignment of 
medication is properly recorded. In addition, the Clinical Research  Associate will verify that 
the Investigator follows the approved protocol and all approved amendments, if any, by 
reviewing the Investigator’s regulatory documents, source documents, ICFs, and eCRFs of 
study subjects.

Confidential  Page 50 of 55  
    The Clinical Research Associate will meet with the Investigator when all subjects have 
completed the Final Visit of the study, in order to collect unused study medications and 
unused supplies and materials.  
Interim monitoring visits and telephone consultations will be done by the Clinical Res earch 
Associate as necessary, to ensure the proper progression and documentation of the study.  
10.7 IRT 
Interactive response technology (IRT) activities will be performed as described in the IRT 
User Manual.  
10.8 Case Report Forms and Study Records  
The initial point of entry of study data should be the subject source documentation. 
The location and nature of the source documentation for all data collected in the study will be 
identified in the study files at the Investigator’s site. In cases where no sou rce documents will 
be used (i.e., data will be recorded directly into the eCRF without first being recorded on 
another document, such as a flowsheet, laboratory report, or other typical form of data 
reporting for later transcription to the eCRF), the origi nal data will be included in the eCRF.  
Source document information should be legible. Recorded data should only be corrected by 
drawing a single line through the incorrect entry and writing the revision next to the 
corrected data. The person who has made t he correction should place his or her initials as 
well as the date of the correction next to the correction. Data may not be obliterated by 
erasure, redaction, or with correction fluid.  
Study data will be transcribed and recorded via an electronic data cap ture (EDC) system as 
eCRFs. Security and authorization procedures consistent with the EDC system must be used. 
At each subject visit, the appropriate eCRFs must be completed. Whenever an eCRF is used, 
be sure to provide all information requested including subject identification number and 
initials, name or number of Investigator, date(s), etc. All applicable questions should be 
answered, and all data requested should be provided. Those areas that require a response but 
are not filled in correctly are consid ered incomplete or erroneous entries and will have to be 
corrected.  
Each authorized study staff member will receive a unique access account in order to use the 
EDC system. Access accounts will not be shared among study staff. Authorized users will 
make ent ries and/or changes to eCRFs via a secure internet access. Each completed set of 
eCRFs will be reviewed by the Investigator who will then electronically sign and date the 
eCRF confirming that data for the subjects are complete and accurate.  
The study recor ds must include a copy of each Investigator's CV and medical license, and 
statement of Investigator qualifications. The name of each Sub -Investigator working under 
the supervision of the Investigator is also required to be filed in the study records. 
In addition, each eCRF, subject charts/source documents, IB, protocol, protocol amendments,

    correspondence with the Sponsor/designee and the IRB/IEC, study medication storage, 
receipts, returns and dispensing records, Delegation of Responsibilities Log, site tr aining 
records, records of site monitoring, any unmasking documentation, AE and SAE reporting, 
IRB/IEC approvals, advertisements, written information provided to subjects, and subject 
completed ICFs will be included in the study records.  
If the Investigato r moves, withdraws from an investigation, or retires, the responsibility for 
maintaining the records may be transferred to another person (e.g., Sponsor, other 
Investigator) who will accept the responsibility. Notice of this transfer, including written 
acceptance, must be made to and agreed upon by the Sponsor.  
10.9 Protocol Deviations  
Per ICH E6 (GCP) R2 Section 4.5.1 the Investigator/institution should conduct the trial in 
compliance with the protocol agreed with the sponsor and, if required, by the Regulatory  
Authority and which was given approval/favorable opinion by IRB/IEC.  
Protocol waivers or deviations from the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria are not 
allowed because they can potentially jeopardize the scientific integrity of the study regulatory  
acceptability or subject safety. Therefore, adherence to the criteria as specified in the 
protocol is essential.  
The site will contact the Sponsor for clarification of inclusion and/or exclusion criteria as 
needed prior to enrollment of the study subject.  The Sponsor will document clarification 
requests and responses or their representative. If a subject does not meet all the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria during screening, that subject may not be enrolled into the study.  
If a protocol deviation is ident ified by the Investigator or through site monitoring activities an 
immediate submission to the IRB/IEC may be required e.g., 24 or 48 hours (as per IRB 
guidelines). The Sponsor will assess any protocol deviation and decide whether any of these 
non-complian ces should be reported to the relevant competent authority as a serious breach 
of GCP and the protocol. If per the relevant competent authorities’ requirements, the protocol 
deviation is not required to be reported immediately but is still required to be n otified to the 
IRB/IEC, the specific protocol deviation will be added to the annual progress report.  
The Sponsor will review, designate, and/or approve all protocol deviations prior to the 
database lock.  
10.10  Access to Source Documentation  
The Investigator will  permit study -related monitoring visits, audits, IRB/IEC review, 
and regulatory inspection(s) by providing direct access to source data and documents.  
The monitor and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agrees to allow the 
monitor direct  access to all relevant documents and to allocate their time and the time of their 
staff to monitor to discuss findings and any issues.

Title of Study:  
 
Post-licensure observational  safety surveillance study  of quadrivalent  meningococcal  
ACWY conjugate vaccine MenACWY -CRM (MENVEO)  among children 2 months  
through 23 months of age. 
Study Period : 
 
The study will start by December  
2014 and data collection  period will 
continue for 3 years. Study Type: This study  is an observational  
post-marketing safety study required by the 
United States Food and Drug Administration  
(FDA). 
Rationale and Background:  
 
Meningococcal disease is caused by  Neisseria meningitidis . Multiple serogroups  are 
responsible for  invasive meningococcal disease (groups  A, B, C, X, Y, and W -135). The 
relative importance  of each serogroup depends on geographic location  [1-5], as well as 
other factors, such as age.  The overall incidence of meningococcal d isease in the US  
during 2005-2011 has been approximately 0.3 cases per 100,000 population.  [6] 
 
MenACWY -CRM (MENVEO)  is a Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y and W-135) 
Oligosaccharide Diphtheria CRM197 Conjugate Vaccine. The safety of Men ACWY- 
CRM has been evaluated in clinical  trials in infants and toddlers 2 to 23 months of age. 
No safety concerns were raised.[ 7] 
 
In February  2010, MenACWY -CRM was approved for use in persons 11-55 years of 
age in the United States.  As of August 2013  MenACWY -CRM was approved for use in  
persons 2 months through 55 years of age in the United States. In infants initiating 
vaccination at 2 months of age,  MenACWY -CRM is to be administered as a four-dose 
series at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of  age. Among children 7 -23 months of age who have  
not previously received a dose of MenACWY -CRM, MenACWY -CRM is to be 
administered as a two-dose series with the second dose administered in the second year 
of life and at least three months after the first dose.  The Centers for Disease Control and  
Prevention's  (CDC) Advisory Committee  on Immunization Practices (ACIP)  
recommends  the meningococcal  conjugate vaccine MenACWY -CRM for use in infants  Doc Number:  81195327

and toddlers 2-23 months of age who are at increased risk  for meningococcal  disease. 
 
This study will provide additional  information to the current safety knowledge of  
MenACWY -CRM in the population 2-23 months of age. 
Research Question and Objectives:  
 
To describe  medical events that require emergency room visit or hospitalization  in 6 
months following  MenACWY -CRM vaccination  in children 2-23 months of age in a 
health maintenance organization  (HMO) in the United States.  
Study Design:  
 
The study is a descriptive  observational  safety surveillance study. 
 
Medical events in  emergency rooms and inpatient care units in children 2-23 months of 
age who were vaccinated with any dose of  MenACWY -CRM vaccine  will be described.  
Only medical events  that occur within 6 months after a MenACWY -CRM vaccination  
will be cap tured. Events will  be identified from electronic  medical records of emergency  
care and inpatient care encounters.  Medical records  of these events will be  reviewed 
and described.  
Population:  
 
Children 2-23 months of age who receive at least one dose  of MenACWY -CRM 
vaccine at a Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) facility while enrolled as a 
KPSC health plan member. 
Variables:  
 
Exposure(s) of interest  
 
All administered doses of MenACWY -CRM at a KPSC facility are considered as  
exposures of interest in children 2-23 months of age who are KPSC members.  The 
exposure of interest is MenACWY -CRM vaccine  given as part of routine  clinical care in 
all medical centers in KPSC. This study  is strictly observational.  MenACWY -CRM will 
be the only  meningococcal  vaccine used in children  2-23 months of age to prevent  N. 
meningitidis serogroup A, C, W135 and Y caused meningococcal disease in KPSC.  Doc Number:  81195327

Abstract:  
11AUG16  
While health care providers (HCP) are advised to follow the  ACIP Recommended  
Childhood Vaccine schedule, vaccination  decisions will be determined by the treating  
HCP and the caregivers.  MenACWY -CRM vaccine as a N. meningitidis A, C, W135 
and Y vaccine will be used in infants and toddlers 2 -23 months of age with high risk 
indications  for the vaccine  in KPSC. No special labeling will be req uired for the 
MenACWY -CRM vaccine used in this study. Co-administration of other vaccines  may 
occur as consistent with clinical practice.  
 
▫ Date (s) of  MenACWY -CRM vaccination (s): exposure to MenACWY -CRM 
vaccination is defined as a registration of a MenACWY -CRM vaccination  in the 
medical records. The date of vaccine administration in the medical records is  
considered as the vaccination  date. Age at vaccination will be expressed in number  
of months after birth.  
▫ Observation period:  For each individual, the observation  period is defined as the  
time from the first dose of  MenACWY -CRM vaccination  up to 6 months after the 
last dose of  MenACWY -CRM vaccination  received between 2 -23 months of age, 
disenrollment,  death, or the end of data collection,  whichever occurs sooner.  
 
Outcome(s)  
 
Outcomes  include medical events that require emergency room visits or hospitalizations  
in children 2-23 months of age following  any dose of MenACWY -CRM vaccination.  
Events with a history of the same diagnosis  prior to the first dose of  MenACWY -CRM 
vaccination will be excluded as a pre-existing condition.   The medical records prior to  
the first dose of MenACWY -CRM will be searched for the same diagnosis code.  
 
For each identified emergency department  or inpatient visit the following  information  
will be collected:  
 
▫ Diagnosis  of medical events  
▫ Date of diagnosis:  the date of the documented code after  any dose of MenACWY - 
CRM vaccination  is considered the date of diagnosis.  The date of diagnosis is  
expressed  as the number of days following  the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th dose of 
MenACWY -CRM vaccination.

7.0 RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND  
 
Meningococcal disease is caused by  Neisseria meningitidis . Multiple serogroups  are 
responsible for  invasive meningococcal disease (groups  A, B, C, X, Y, and W -135). The 
relative importance of each serogroup depends on geographic location, as well as other  
factors, such as age.  Serogroup B and C strains are most prevalent in Europe, and 
serogroups B, C and Y strains are most prevalent in North America.  Serogroup  A strains 
are rarely isolated in Europe and North America. [1-5]The overall incidence of  
meningococcal disease in the US during  2005-2011has been ap proximately  0.3 cases per 
100,000 population.  [6] Children younger than 1 year of age have the highest incidence of 
meningococcal disease  in the United States. 
 
MenACWY -CRM (MENVEO)  is a Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y and W-135) 
Oligosaccharide Diphtheria CRM197 Conjugate Vaccine.  Safety of Men ACWY-CRM 
with 2-dose and 4-dose schedules has  been primarily evaluated in  multiple clinical studies 
in infants and toddlers 2 to 23 months of age. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were similar 
between the MenACWY -CRM and routine  paediatric  vaccination  groups. Rates of severe  
unsolicited  adverse events (AEs) reported in subjects  who received MenACWY -CRM in 
co-administration with routine childhood vaccination and  those who received  routine 
childhood vaccination alone are similar.  No vaccine related death was reported.[ 7] 
 
In February  2010, MenACWY -CRM was approved for use in persons 11-55 years of age 
in the United States. As of August 2013  MenACWY -CRM was approved for use in  
persons 2 months through 55 years of age in the United States. In infants initiating 
vaccination at 2 months of age,  MenACWY -CRM is to be administered as a four-dose 
series at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age. Among children 7 -23 months of age who have not  
previously received a dose of MenACWY -CRM, MenACWY -CRM is to be administered  
as a two-dose series, with the second dose administered in the second year of  life and at  
least three months after the first dose.  The Centers for Disease Con trol and Prevention's  
(CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends  the 
meningococcal  conjugate  vaccine MenACWY -CRM for use in infants and  toddlers 2-23 
months of age who are at increased risk  for meningococcal  disease. Children at i ncreased 
risk include those who have persistent complement deficiencies, have functional  or 
anatomic asplenia, are at risk during a community  outbreak attributable to a vaccine 
serogroup, or travel to or are residents of countries where meningococcal disease is  
hyperendemic or epidemic.[ 6] 
 
The study is to be conducted in collaboration with  Kaiser Permanente Southern California  
(KPSC) in the United States. 
 
This study will add to the current knowledge  about the safety of MenACWY -CRM in 
children 2-23 months of age in the setting of routine medical care. Doc Number:  81195327

9.1 RESEARC H METHODS  
 
9.2 Study Design 
 
This is a post marketing  commitment  (PMC) agreed upon with FDA Center for Biologics  
Evaluation and Research  (CBER) to establish an open label, descriptive,  epidemiological  
safety surveillance  study of MENVEO  in children 2 through 23 months of age  who 
receive medical care at the site where the study  is being conducted.  Part I will continue  
for 3 years, or until commencement of Part II, whichever occurs first. Part II of the study  
will be initiated if there is a recommendation  by the Advisory  Committee  on 
Immunization  Practices (ACIP) for routine use of meningococcal conjugate vaccine in at  
least one birth cohort within the  2 through 23 months of age range. 
 
Part II will commence  with the effective date of the AC IP recommendation,  and will 
continue until 20,000 children are enrolled, or until 1 year has elapsed, whichever occurs  
last. If initiated, a final study  report for Part II will be submitted 1 year after the last 
subject has completed study  Part II. In the event there is no recommendation  for routine 
use of meningococcal conjugate vaccine in this age group, Part II will be considered  
fulfilled when Part I is completed.  
 
This study protocol and timelines pertain only to Part I since there is currently no ACIP  
recommendation  for routine use of  meningococcal  conjugate vaccine among children 2 
through 23 months of age. 
 
In Part I, medical events in emergency rooms and inpatient  care units in children 2-23 
months of age who were vaccinated with any dose of  MenACWY -CRM vaccine will be 
described. Only  medical events that occur within 6 months after a MenACWY -CRM 
vaccination will be captured. Events will be identified from electronic  medical records of  
emergency  care and inpatient  care encounters.  Medical records of these events will be  
reviewed and described.  
 
9.3 Setting 
 
The study will be conducted  at Kaiser Permanente  Southern California (KPSC), the  
largest managed care organization  in Southern California, serving over 3.7 million 
members that are broadly representative of the diverse racial, ethnic and socioeconomic  
background of the source population  in Southern California.[ 8]  The racial/ethnic  
breakdown of the KPSC population  is 41% Hispanic, 36% Non-Hispanic White, 11% 
Asian/Pacific Islander, 9% Black, and 3%  other. 
 
Prepaid, comprehensive  health care is provided to KPSC members at 14 medical centers  
and over 200 satellite clinics.  All health care encounters are tracked through electronic  
data systems, with detailed information  on diagnoses  applied, procedures performed,  and Doc Number:  81195327

immunizations administered, regardless of setting.   KPSC members may seek emergency  
medical care from outside health care providers.  For outside providers to be reimbursed  
by the health plan for covered emergency  care, claims have to be submitted with  
documentation  of the episode of care, and that information  is entered into the  
administrative data systems. Thus, the capture of care del ivered to KPSC members by  
electronic  data is very  comprehensive.  
 
KPSC health plan members can enroll through their employer  or the employer of a family  
member, through individual  and family  plans, or through state or federal programs such  
as California Public Employees'  Retirement  System, MediCal, and Medicare.  
 
The KPSC Regional Immunization Practice Committee (RIPC) makes  recommendations  
to ensure appropriate use of vaccination and implementation of new ACIP immunization  
recommendations  within KPSC. KPSC has a proactive immunization  program that 
includes: 1)  alerts in the electronic medical record that indicate which age -appropriate  
routine vaccines are  due based on vaccines that the member has already received, 2) a  
policy of vaccinating  at all visits, not just well child or physical exam appointments, and  
3) giving immunizations on a walk-in basis without appointment  and at no-cost nurse 
visits.  Since there is no charge for immunizations  for KPSC members,  there is an 
incentive to receive immunizations within the KPSC system.  
 
9.2.1 Study Period  
 
The total study period will be up to 3.5 years, which includes vaccination  period and 
observation  period. 
 
▫ Vaccination  period will start at earliest in May 2014, and at latest in December 2014  
to implement  ACIP recommendation  on preventing  meningococcal  serogroups A,  C, 
W135 and Y caused meningitis  in persons aged 2 through 23 months.  
▫ Observation period:  For each individual, the observation  period is defined as the time  
from the first dose of MenACWY -CRM vaccination  up to 6 months after the last dose  
of MenACWY -CRM vaccination  received between 2 -23 months of age, 
disenrollment,  death, or the end of data collection,  whichever occurs sooner.  
 
Pre-existing medical events will be asse ssed prior to the first dose of MenACWY -CRM 
vaccination.  
 
9.2.2 Study Subjects  
 
According to  the ACIP recommended  immunization  schedule for persons aged 0 through  
18 years, MenACWY -CRM is recommended for  children 2-23 months of age with high- 
risk conditions  and other persons at increased risk of disease. This population  includes: Doc Number:  81195327

▫ children with anatomic or functional asplenia (including sickle cell disease)  
▫ children with persistent complement component deficiency  
▫ children who travel to or reside in countries in which meningococcal disease is  
hyperendemic or epidemic  
▫ children at risk during a community  outbreak attributable to a vaccine serogroup.  
There are approximately 500,000 births per year in California,[ 9] equivalent to nearly  1 
million infants and toddlers age 2-23 months. There were approximately 38,000 babies  
delivered at KPSC facilities and contracting hospitals in 2012.  
 
There were approximately  122,000 infants and toddler s age 2-23 months enrolled in the  
KPSC health plan in 2013.  Among this population,  there were approximately  30 
individuals diagnosed with sickle cell, asplenia, or persistent complement deficiency.  
 
9.2.3 Study Population Selection  
 
Children 2-23 months of age who receive at least one dose of  MenACWY -CRM vaccine 
at a KPSC facility while enrolled as a KPSC health plan member  are considered as  the 
study population.  
 
Inclusion criteria: 
 
▫ children 2-23 months of age at the time of MenACWY -CRM vaccination  
▫ hold KPSC membership at the time of MenACWY -CRM vaccination  
▫ vaccinated with MenACWY -CRM during the study  period in KPSC 
There are no exclusion  criteria for selection of the study population.  
9.3 Variables  
 
The sections below describe the theoretical aspects  of relevant variables. Data sources  
and operational  definitions  are discussed in 9.4. 
 
9.3.1 Exposure of Interest  
 
Doses of MenACWY -CRM administered at a KPSC facility are considered as exposures  
of interest in children 2-23 months of age who are KPSC members. The exposure of  
interest is MenACWY -CRM vaccine  given as part of routine  clinical care in all medical  
centers in KPSC. This study  is strictly observational.  MenACWY -CRM will be the only 
meningococcal  vaccine used in children 2 -23 months of age to prevent  N. meningitidis  
serogroup A, C, W135 and Y caused meningococcal  disease in KPSC.  While HCPs are  Doc Number:  81195327

advised to follow  ACIP immunization  recommendations,  decisions regarding  
vaccinations and vaccination schedule  will be determined by the  HCP and caregivers.  The 
MenACWY -CRM vaccination recommendation  will be implemented at all KPSC  
medical centers.  
 
No special labeling will be required for the MenACWY -CRM vaccine used in this study. 
Other vaccines may be co -administered as consistent with clinical practice.  
 
According to  the ACIP recommendation,  MenACWY -CRM is recommended  for infants 
and toddlers 2-23 months of age with high risk of meningococcal disease.  The 
recommended mening ococcal vaccination schedules for these high risk populations  are as 
follows: [10] 
 
▫ Children with anatomic or functional asplenia (including  sickle cell disease):  
1. For children younger than 19 months of age, administer  a 4-dose infant series of  
MenHibrix or  MENVEO  at 2, 4, 6, and 12 through 15 months of age.  
2. For children aged 19 through 23 months who have not completed a series of 
MenHibrix or  MENVEO,  administer 2 primary doses of  MENVEO  at least 3 months 
apart. 
 
▫ Children with persistent complement component deficiency:  
1. For children younger than 19 months of age, administer a 4-dose infant series of  
either MenHibrix or  MENVEO  at 2, 4, 6, and 12 through  15 months of age. 
2. For children 7 through 23 months who have not initia ted vaccination, two options  
exist depending on age and vaccine brand:  
a. For children who initiate vaccination  with MENVEO  at 7 months through 23  
months of age, a 2-dose series should be administered with the second dose after  
12 months of age and at least 3 months after the first dose.  
b. For children who initiate vaccination  with Menactra  at 9 months through 23  
months of age, a 2-dose series of Menactra should be administered at least  3 
months apart. 
 
▫ For children who travel to or reside in countries in which meningococcal disease is  
hyperendemic or epidemic, including countries in the African meningitis belt or the  
Hajj, administer an age  appropriate  formulation  and series of Menactra  or MENVEO  
for protection against serogroups A and W meningococcal disease.   Prior receipt of 
MenHibrix is not sufficient for children traveling to the meningitis  belt or the Hajj 
because it does not contain serogroups A or W.  Doc Number:  81195327

▫ For children at risk during a community  outbreak attributable to a vaccine serogroup,  
administer or complete an age - and formulation -appropriate  series of MenHibrix,  
Menactra, or  MENVEO.  
Catch-up recommendation of MenACWY -CRM for persons with high-risk conditions  is 
as follows: 
 
For children who initiate vaccination  with MENVEO  at 7 months through 9 months of  
age, a 2-dose series should be administered with the second dose after 12 months of age  
and at least 3 months after  the first dose. 
 
9.3.2 Outcome(s)  
 
Outcomes  include medical events that require an emergency room visit or hospitalization  
in children 2-23 months of age within 6 months following  any dose of MenACWY -CRM 
vaccination.  
 
9.3.3 Other Variables  
 
▫ Baseline characteristics: these data will be extracted from patients’ medical records.  
- Date of birth, expressed as age at vaccination  
- Gender 
▫ Underlying condition of the MenACWY -CRM vaccine indication  (i.e., persistent  
complement  component  deficiencies, a splenia or other), if available.  
▫ Vaccination  history 
- Concomitant vaccinations (specify)  
- History of other vaccinations  (specify) 
- Vaccinations  occurring during the observation period (specify) 
 
 
9.4 Data Sources  
 
The study will be conducted  using the KPSC Oracle Research Data Warehouse (RDW)  
which supports external and internal research projects conducted in the Department of  
Research & Evaluation,  KPSC as well as patient care management programs. The data  
warehouse is an integrated and comprehensive resou rce. It contains information as far  
back as 1980, including records related to  membership,  benefits, utilization,  pharmacy,  
vital signs, laboratory,  vaccines, geocoding,  mortality,  and procedures.  Doc Number:  81195327

OBS-01 TEMP 01  / Atlas No. 295927  
Version No. 1 / Version Date: November  27, 2012  
  
Medical events will be searched in  the electronic medical record (EMR). All care  
provided at KPSC is recorded using  the EMR. All details of a patient encounter, including  
diagnoses,  procedures, and physician’s notes, are entered into the EMR at the point o f 
care. All vaccinations  are entered into the EMR when they  are given, with vaccine, dose,  
manufacturer, and lot number entered at the time of vaccination.  
 
9.4.1 Operational Exposure Definition  
 
Vaccination  information will be searched from vaccination  records. Documented  
MenACWY -CRM vaccination  record is considered as evidence of  exposure.  
 
The date of vaccine administration in the medical records is considered as the vaccination  
date. Age  at vaccination will be  extracted from date of vaccination and date of bi rth. Age 
at vaccination will be  expressed in number of months after birth.  
 
The first dose of  MenACWY -CRM vaccination  administered at a KPSC  facility to a 
KPSC member 2 -23 months of age is the starting point of observation  period for each 
study individual.  
 
For each individual, the observation  period is defined as the time from the first dose of 
MenACWY -CRM vaccination  up to 6 months after the  last dose of MenACWY -CRM 
vaccination  received between 2 -23 months of age, disenrollment,  death, or the end of data  
collection,  whichever occurs sooner.  
 
9.4.2 Operational Outcome Definition and Identification Process  
 
Medical events occurring in emergency  and inpatient settings within 6 months following  
a MenACWY -CRM vaccination will be searched in electronic medical records.  
Diagnoses  occurring in any care setting (inpatient,  outpatient,  or emergency  room) prior 
to the first dose of MenACWY -CRM vaccination  will be searched in electronic medical  
records for evidence of  pre-existing medical events. 
 
Events with a history of the same diagnosis  prior to the first dose of  MenACWY -CRM 
vaccination will be excluded as a pre-existing condition.  The medical records prior to the 
first dose of MenACWY -CRM will be searched for the same diagnosis code. As there  
will be a transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) 
to Tenth Revision (ICD-10) coding, in the event that the diagnosis following  a 
MenACWY -CRM vaccination  is coded using ICD -10, both the same ICD -10 code and an  
equivalent ICD -9 diagnosis code will be searched in the period prior to the first dose. 
 
If a study subject is first seen in the emergency  department and  subsequently  transferred  
to the hospital, this will be treated as a single episode of care. Multiple records of a single  
medical event will be consolidated and treated as 1 report. Doc Number:  81195327

Version No. 1 / Version Date: November  27, 2012  
  
Medical events are considered as eligible if  they occur in eligible study  subjects during 
the observation  period and are not pre-existing conditions.  
 
For each identified emergency department  or inpatient visit  the following  information  
will be collected:  
 
▫ Diagnosis  of medical events  
▫ Date of diagnosis:  the date of the documented code after any  dose of MenACWY - 
CRM vaccination  is considered the date of diagnosis.  The date of diagnosis is  
expressed  as the number of days following  the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th dose of MenACWY - 
CRM vaccination.  
▫ Health care setting: hospitalization  or emergency room visit 
Process of medical events identification  
Eligible medical events  identification  process is illustrated  in Figure 1: 
 
1. Children 2-23 months of age vaccinated with MenACWY -CRM will be identified  by 
immunization records in electronic medical records. 
2. Medical events will be searched  up to 6 months following  MenACWY -CRM 
vaccination  in the electronic records of emergency department and inpatient  care units  
in all medical centers of  KPSC. 
3. Diagnosis  codes of medical events from these visits will be identified.  
4. Pre-existing conditions  will be excluded by automated  search. 
5. Medical charts  of identified eligible events will be reviewed and described.  Doc Number:  81195327

9.6 Data Management  
 
9.6.1 Data Processing  
 
Data collection  and retrieval will be performed  using the HMO’s standard procedures in  
agreement  with GSK. Quality assurance  measures as implemented at the HMO will be  
used. 
 
Blinding 
This study is an open-label study  conducted in  a routine medical care setting.  Reviewers  
are not blinded to the patient identity or vaccination  status. All study staff with access to 
protected health information are trained in procedures to protect the confidentiality  of 
subject data.  
 
Data linkage  
An important aspect of the KPSC managed care environment is its integrated approach to  
the delivery  of medical care. This approach  depends on, and therefore  facilitates, the  
development and maintenance of  a large number of databases, linkable through a unique 
medical record number. These databases include  those that track membership, encounters,  
claims, pharmaceuticals dispensed and appointments.  They also include test results as  
well as text excerpts of their interpretation. There are also a number of  derivative  files 
that have been developed for research purposes, including those for disease  identification,  
geocoding files and mortality follow-up files. 
 
9.6.2 Software and Hardware  
 
The data analysis  in this study will be performed by  Research & Evaluation  programmers  
and analysts in KPSC.  SAS (Enterprise Guide 4.3  or higher) will be used to perform data  
programming and  data analysis in the study. Data managemen t will be done in both PC  
and Unix environments.  
 
9.7 Data Analysis  
 
9.7.1 Statistical Hypotheses  
 
This study is descriptive  in nature and there will be no hypothesis  testing. 
 
9.7.2 Analysis of Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
 
Age at vaccination  (extracted from date of birth  and date of vaccination)  will be presented  
by mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. Gender will be described  
by absolute numbers and percentages. Vaccination history (including  vaccine name and 
age or relative timing of vaccination)  will be summarized descriptively.  Doc Number:  81195327

9.7.3 Statistical Methods  
 
This descriptive study  will analyze collected data to report frequencies of MenACWY - 
CRM exposure and analysis of medical events.  The frequencies  will be presented as  
absolute numbers and percentages  of relevant total. 
 
Frequency of exposure to MenACWY -CRM vaccination  
 
This descriptive study  will report the frequency  of exposure among infants and toddlers 
2-23 months of age vaccinated at least one  dose of MenACWY -CRM during the study 
period. Frequency  of exposure will be summarized as follows:  
 
▫ Overall 
▫ 1 dose 
▫ 2 doses 
▫ 3 doses 
▫ 4 doses 
Analysis of medical events 
 
Eligible medical events in the study  will be described as follows: 
 
▫ Frequency of  individual  medical events 
The frequency of medical events is defined as the total number of each  individual  
event. The frequency will be described by absolute number of each individual medical  
event and percent age of each individual  medical event  of total number of captured 
medical events  during the observation  period. 
 
If the number of medical events allows, captured medical events will be stratified by  
dose. 
 
▫ Rate of medical events  
The rate of medical events is defined as the number of all captured events divided by  
the total person -time following  MenACWY -CRM doses administered during the  
study period. 95% confidence interval of the rate of medical events will be calculated.  
Person-time for each dose will begin at the vaccination and end at 6 months following  
vaccination,  disenrollment, death,  the end of data collection,  or receipt of an 
additional  dose of MenACWY -CRM, whichever  comes first.  If data permit, rate will 
be further stratified by dose.  Doc Number:  81195327

▫ Description  of medical events  
Medical events following  MenACWY -CRM exposure in  children 2-23 months of age 
will be described. Medical events will be reviewed and described,  at least including 
age at vaccination, gender, vaccination  history, diagnoses,  and if available, underlying  
condition.  Recurrence  of the same medical event after repeated MenACWY -CRM 
vaccination of the same person will be included in the description  as well. 
 
9.7.4 Statistical Considerations  
 
Misclassification of diagnosis  
 
As this study focuses on medical events  requiring hospitalization  and emergency  care 
among children 2 -23 months of age enrolled as KPSC health plan members,  it is unlikely  
that serious and acute outcomes would be missed or misclassified.   Also, due to the ICD- 
9 to ICD-10 transition,  both ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes may need to be searched to exclude 
pre-existing conditions.   Some pre-existing conditions  may be missed from the automated  
search due to imperfect mapping between ICD -9 and ICD -10. 
 
Misclassification of exposure  
 
Depending on the available data in  the medical record database on the recording  of a 
vaccination, it may  be that not all vaccinations  are given through the HMO,  resulting in 
not all vaccination  data being present in the medical record.  However, loss of these data  
should not affect results because analyses are confined to those  individuals  with a 
recorded vaccine administration.  
 
Missing Data  
 
No imputation  will be performed.  We expect there to be a very  low rate of missing data  
regarding population characteristics, such as age and gender,  and diagnoses.  The study 
uses electronic  medical records as the source of information for diagnoses,  so events that  
do not result in a medical visit may be missed.  Subjects missing the stratification factors  
will be excluded from subgroup analysis where the stratification  factor is unknown.  We 
expect that  most vaccines will be captured by the electronic medical record, with very  
little missing information.   It is possible that some study subjects will have received  
meningococcal vaccine prior to joining  the health plan, and these prior doses  may not be 
captured. This number is expected to be small and not to have a material impact on the  
results. Doc Number:  81195327

Handling of Loss to Follow-up 
 
We expect there to be minimal loss to follow-up due to the high retention of KPSC health 
plan members in this age group.  Any loss will be addressed in the data analysis by  the 
truncation  of person-time in the event rate calculation.  
 
 
9.8 Quality Control  
 
9.8.1 Validation  
 
Vaccination and medical event data will be extracted directly from the electronic  medical 
record, which is the legal record of all medical care received within the KPSC system.  
Records of vaccinations and medical events can only be entered by medical staff, and are  
assumed to be an accurate representation of care received.  No validation will be  
performed  regarding vaccination.   Medical events will be individually  reviewed in order 
to determine the primary  reason for the encounter as well as whether the condition  pre- 
dated the first receipt of MenACWY -CRM. 
 
All data in the study  is extracted and maintained  in the electronic database at KPSC. The  
database is maintained on a daily basis, and undergoes quality validations  regularly.  Only 
authorized  study personnel with passwords can access to databases.  Validations  of data in 
the study database will include range and consistency  checks. 
 
9.8.2 Record Retention  
 
The participating HMO’s standard procedures for medical record and data file retention  
will be used for this study. 
 
9.9 Limitations of the Research Methods  
 
This is a descriptive, observational study  conducted in a routine medical care setting.  The 
decisions to use MenACWY -CRM and other vaccinations  are independently made by  
HCPs and caregivers.  
 
The validity of the study may be limited by several aspects. First, the generalizability  will 
be limited by the characteristics of the population covered by KPSC.  KPSC has a larger  
proportion  of Hispanics  compared  to the US population, but  it is broadly representative of  
the California population.  Second, the study may not be able to capture all medical events  
following Men ACWY -CRM vaccination, due to children  moving out of the KPSC 
region. Given that the population  is relatively stable, it is less likely that the study  will be 
affected. Finally, medical events described in the study  will be severe due to the n ature of 
diseases requiring inpatient and emergency room visits. Doc Number:  81195327

10.1 PROTECTION OF HUMAN  SUBJECTS  
 
KPSC electronic medical records will be used to conduct the study. Personal information  
is maintained at KPSC with firewall protection. Identifiable data can be only accessed  by 
authorized  study staff through password protected accounts. Data transmission  is through 
encrypted software to assure confidentiality.  
 
GSK respects the subjects’ rights to privacy and will ensure the confidentiality  of their 
medical information  in accordance  with applicable laws and regulations.  
 
10.2 Regulatory and Ethical Compliance  
 
This study was designed and shall be implemented and reported in accordance with Good 
Pharmacoepidemiological  Practice, with applicable  local regulations  and with the ethical 
principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
 
10.3 Informed Consent  
 
Subjects included in this  study will be identified  among KPSC health plan members.  
Informed consent for receipt of  MenACWY -CRM vaccine is not required as it is given  to 
eligible KPSC members  as part of routine care.  KPSC will obtain IRB approval  and will 
request waivers for both informed consent and written HIPAA authorization  prior to 
initiating data collection.  
 
10.4 Responsibilities of the Investigator and IRB/IEC/REB  
 
The protocol and waiver of informed consent must be reviewed and approved by a 
properly constituted IRB/IEC/REB before study  start. A signed and dated statement that  
the protocol has been approved by the IRB/IEC/REB and waiver of informed consent  
must be g iven to GSK before study  initiation.  Prior to study start, the investigator  is 
required to sign a protocol signature page confirming his/her  agreement to conduct the  
study in accordance with these documents and all of the instructions and procedures  
found in this protocol. If an inspection  of the site is requested by  a regulatory  authority,  
the investigator must inform  GSK immediately  that this request has been made.  
 
10.5 Protocol Adherence  
 
Investigators will apply due diligence to avoid protocol deviations. Under no 
circumstances  should the investigator  contact GSK or its agents, if any, monitoring the  
study to request approval of a protocol deviation,  as no authorized  deviations  are 
permitted. If the investigator feels a change to the protocol would improve the conduct of  
the study this must be considered a protocol amendment, and unless such an amendment  Doc Number:  81195327

11.0 MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS/ ADVERSE  
REACTIONS  
 
Adverse reactions reporting is not required, as this is a non-interventional  study based on 
secondary  use of KPSC electronic  records. Vaccination information, medical events and  
pre-existing conditions  will be searched  in the computer database.  SAEs cannot be  
identified spontaneously under the current  methodology,  so there will not be a general 
tabulation  of SAEs that occurred and were reported  spontaneously in this study.  Doc Number:  81195327

Expedited Reporting  Guidelines  
 
Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID  assigned  
during trial registration on all reports.  
 
Note: A death on study requires both routine and expedited reporting,  
regardless of causality. Attribution to treatment or other cause must  be 
provided.  
Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5  “Disease 
progression” in the system organ class (SOC) “General disorders  and 
administration site conditions.” Evidence that the death was a manifestation  of 
underlying disease ( e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth  or 
progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should  be 
submitted.  
Rationale : Under 7.3 Expedited Reporting Guidelines, the language needs  to 
change to reflect the amendment request from NCI’s letter (attached)  on 
1/25/2018 regarding new term for Progressive  Disease.

1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Primary  Objectives  
 
The primary objective of this study is to characterize the clinical anti -tumor activity of  CDX- 011 
(glembatumumab vedotin) as a single -agent in the treatment of patients with metastatic  uveal 
melanoma.  The primary endpoint will be overall response rate (ORR) using RECIST  1.1. 
 
1.2 Secondary  Objectives  
 
Secondary objectives include a description of the clinical safety and benefit of  CDX- 011 
(glembatumumab vedotin) and pharmacodynamics changes in glycoprotein NMB  (GPNMB) 
expression. Secondary endpoints will include progression- free survival (PFS), overall  survival 
(OS), GPNMB expression via immunohistochemistry  (IHC).  
 
1.3 Exploratory  Objectives  
 
Exploratory objectives for this study include characterization of the  anti-tumor 
immunophenotype of patients receiving treatment. Post hoc, correlation of rash with clinical 
benefit, or lack of rash with lack of benefit, will also be  explored. 
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1. Eye Neoplasm, Uveal Melanoma  
 
Uveal melanoma accounts for 5% of all melanoma diagnoses, representing approximately  2,000 
patients per year in the U.S.1 The uveal tract of the eye is not drained by lymphatics and 50%  of 
uveal melanoma patients will develop metastasis via hematogenous spread, the  overwhelming 
majority of which (90%) occur in the liver.2-5   Once metastatic, average survival is 6  months.  
Outside of prosta te cancer metastasizing to bone, there is no other solid tumor  which 
demonstrates such a predictable homing for its metastatic  site. 
 
To date there is no standard of care approved treatment option for patients with metastatic  uveal  
melanoma and expert consensus guidelines recommend treatment on a clinical trial.  Surgical  
resection of liver metastasis plays a role in less than 10% of patients, in part due to the need for 
liver-only disease and less than 50% liver involvement, and the  advanced age of metastatic uveal 
melanoma patients (50 -60 years  old).6 
 
A few approaches to systemic therapy have been studied or are newly underway. Chemotherapy 
alone has generated response rates of less than 1% for metastatic uveal  melanoma.7-8 
Biochem otherapy consisting of bleomycin, vincristine, lomustine, dacarbazine, and interferon - 
alpha (BOLD -IFN) resulted in a response rate of 20% but its use is marred by  significant 
hematologic and unpredictable pulmonary  toxicity.9 
 
Targeted therapy with IMC -A12 (Cixutuxumab), an IGF -1R blocking antibody, has been studied  
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date: April 2, 2018

in a Phase II trial in metastatic uveal melanoma (CTEP 8832) with zero responses seen in  18 
patients enrolled (unpublished data). AZD -6244 (Selumetinib), a selective MEK inhibitor, was 
studied in a randomized Phase II trial versus temozolomide in patients with metastatic  uveal 
melanoma. Selumetinib demonstrated a final overall response rate of 1 0% versus 0% in the 
temozolomide arm.10 No significant difference in overall survival was noted. Imatinib and 
sunitinib trials targeting CKIT overexpression in uveal melanoma have likewise  been 
unsuccessful with response rates of 0% and 5% in published cli nical trials.11, 12 
 
There are several other studies in progress using various agents such as targeted therapy, 
epigenetic therapy, and immunotherapy. Trametinib, a selective MEK inhibitor, with or  without  
GSK2141795 (Akt inhibitor) is being studied in a randomized Phase II trial (NCI  9445, 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Currently more than 1/3 of the study population has been enrolled (N=80)  with 
no interim results reported. AEB071 (PKC inhibitor, Sotrastaurin) is being st udied as  both 
monotherapy in a Phase I study for metastatic uveal melanoma ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) as well as  in 
combination with a MEK inhibitor, MEK162 (Binimetinib) in a separate Phase I/II  study 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) for this patient population.  Ipilimumab is being studied in a dedicated  Phase 
I/II study solely for uveal melanoma patients at two dose levels: 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  To date, results have not been reported.  Vorinostat as an epigenetic  modifier 
is under investigation in a Phase II study to as sess efficacy for metastatic uveal  melanoma 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  No results have been reported for  vorinostat.  
 
2.2. CTEP IND Agent – CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin)  
 
Glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB) is a transmembrane protein whose overexpression promotes 
invasion and meta stasis of cancer cells from multiple tissue types and is expressed at high  levels 
in several malignant human tissues, including uveal melanoma, relative to corresponding  normal 
tissue.13,14 Preliminary data consisting of immunohistochemistry (IHC) of 21 uv eal melanoma 
specimens demonstrated staining in 86% of samples tested.15   The percentage of cells  positive 
per tumor ranged from 10- 90% and the level of GPNMB was of variable intensity (5 tumors  1+; 
11 tumors 2+; and 2 tumors  3+). 
 
Antibody -drug conjugates offer a novel approach to treating cancer and allow for the selective 
delivery of cytotoxic agents to a tumor with the goal of reducing toxicity and enhancing  efficacy 
compared with the systemic administration of cytotoxic agents o r unconjugated antibodies.  
CDX- 011 (glembatumumab vedotin) is a fully -human IgG2 monoclonal antibody  (CR011) 
directed against GPNMB coupled via a protease -sensitive valine -citrulline peptide linker  to 
monomethylauristatin E (MMAE), a potent cytotoxic micro tubule inhibitor.16 This technology  is 
licensed from Seattle Genetics and is identical to that used in SGN35, a promising  antibody -drug 
conjugate for lymphoma.  The proposed mechanism of action is that, upon binding to GPNMB 
on tumors, the complex is inter nalized and MMAE is released via proteolytic cleavage of  the 
valine -citrulline linker inside a lysosome. Tumor cell death occurs as a result of  microtubule 
inhibition by MMAE leading to cell- cycle arrest. Bystander tumor cells may be also be killed  by 
uptake of free MMAE released by dying cells. CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin)  induced 
complete regression of GPNMB -expressing tumors derived from SK -Mel-2 and  SK-Mel-5 
melanoma cell lines in xenograft mouse  studies.13,14,17 
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date: April 2, 2018

Pharmacology  
 
CDX- 011 (glembatumumab vedotin) binds to and inhibits growth of GPNMB -positive  tumor  
cell lines including the melanoma lines SK -Mel-2 and SK -Mel-5 (IC50 216 -300 ng/mL).13 It has 
no effect on GPNMB -negative cell lines. CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin) also induces  cell- 
cycle arrest followed by apoptotic cell death in GPNMB -expressing melanoma cells. In  SK- 
Mel-2 and SK -Mel-5 melanoma xenograft mouse models, CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin) 
administered intravenously (IV) once daily every 4 days x 4 led to durable tumor regression in a 
dose-dependent manner.17 
 
Pharmacokinetics  
 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of total CR011 antibody (conjugated and free) have been assessed  in 
rodents and primates. The data demonstrate dose- proportional exposure and elimination half-life 
of 11- 22 hours in cynomolgus monkeys, increasing with dose. Concentration vs. time  plots 
appeared non- linear with dose, suggestive of saturable elimination pathways. Overal l, there  was 
no significant antibody accumulation after 4 weekly doses, and levels of free MMAE were  low 
compared to levels of total antibody, supporting the premise that the CR011- MMAE bond was 
stable in extracellular  matrix.  
 
PK data for serum concentrat ions of CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin) were collected for  55 
melanoma patients. First- order kinetics were observed following a 90- minute IV infusion. The 
half-life (t ½) was approximately 27 hours at 1.88 mg/kg.  
 
Mechanism of  Action  
 
The proposed mechanis m of action of CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin) is via binding of  the 
antibody -drug conjugate to GPNMB on tumor cells. The antibody -GPNMB complex is  then 
internalized and cytotoxic MMAE is released via cleavage of the valine- citrulline peptide  linker  
inside a lysosome.  MMAE leads to microtubule inhibition causing cell cycle  arrest.  
 
Route of  Elimination  
 
CDX- 011 (glembatumumab vedotin) is cleared by the liver and excreted via the  kidneys. 
Toxicology  
In cynomolgus monkeys, the no observable adverse ef fect level (NOAEL) for  CDX- 011 
(glembatumumab vedotin) administered once weekly for 4 weeks was 0.3 mg/kg in males and 1 
mg/kg in females. The major toxicity was in the hematopoietic system. All findings,  including 
microscopic effect were completely revers ible. Neutropenia was considered a  dose-limiting 
toxicity and was reversible following a 6 -week recovery period. The maximum -tolerated  dose 
(MTD) in both sexes was considered to be between 1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg.  
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date: April 2, 2018 
9  
  
In repeat -dose rat studies, dose -dependent findings were observed for  CDX -011 
(glembatumumab vedotin) treated groups with similar hematopoietic findings in rats treated  with 
the highest dose of CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin) as in rats treated with MMAE  alone.  
All findings were reversible except for dose -dependent germ cell depletion in the testes of  male 
animals.  No findings were attributed to CR011 antibody alone or vehicle  control. 
 
Clinical activity of CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin)  
 
To date, CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin) has been administered to more than 255 cancer 
patients in three completed clinical trials.  CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin)  has 
demonstrated clinical activity with an acceptable safety profile in a Phase I/II dose escalation  and 
expansion study in advanced melanoma (n=117).18 A dose level of 1.88 mg/kg  administered 
intravenously every 3 weeks was determined to be the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). At  the 
MTD, the most common treatment- related toxicities included dermatologic events (rash,  pruritus, 
alopecia),  fatigue,  neutropenia,  neuropathy,  and  gastrointestinal  toxicities    (diarrhea,            
nausea, dysgeusia, constipation, and vomiting). In t his study, the ORR was 13% in 40 patients  at 
the 1.88 mg/kg dose level, including one response that was not confirmed. The disease  control 
rate (DCR = PR + SD ≥ 12 months) was 81%.  PFS at the MTD was 3.3  months. 
 
In the melanoma study, treatment -related adverse events that occurred in >20% of patients at  the 
MTD, also known as the Phase II dose, were fatigue, rash, nausea, neuropathy, alopecia, pruritus, 
constipation, diarrhea, anorexia, and dysgeusia. Grade 3 or greater treatment -related  events 
consisted primarily of neutropenia, neuropathy, fatigue, and rash. Three fatal events  considered 
potentially related to CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin) treatment occurred in the  melanoma 
study: pneumococcal sepsis, acute renal failure and toxic epidermal  necrolysis.  
 
Results from the CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin) studies completed to date have  revealed  
the following: 
• CDX- 011 (glembatumumab vedotin) is active in both breast cancer and melanoma.  
Activity data (objective response rates and progression- free survival) for patients  treated  
at the Phase II dose across all studies have been favorable for the  heavily -pretreated  
populations studied. 
• Alternate dosing schedules (every 1 week, every 2 weeks, and every 3 weeks)  were 
evaluated in the melanoma study. Although indications of increased activity were  noted 
in the more frequent dosing cohorts, this was associated with increased  toxicity.  
• Although sample sizes are small, patients with tumors expressing higher levels  of 
GPNM B consistently appear to derive greater clinical benefit from  CDX- 011 
(glembatumumab vedotin) as compared the entire population of treated patients.  
• In both breast cancer studies, the subset of patients with triple -negative breast  cancer, 
where treatment o ptions are limited, also appeared to derive greater clinical benefit from 
CDX- 011 (glembatumumab vedotin). 
• In the melanoma study, development of rash of any grade, which may be related to the 
presence of GPNMB in the skin, within the first 21 days of treatment was associated with 
greater progression -free survival (PFS) and objective response rate.18 Rash  also 
NCI Protocol #:9855

correlated with prolonged PFS in the Phase II breast cancer study (EME RGE),  although 
this correlation was not observed in the earlier Phase I/II breast cancer study  (CR011-  
CLN -20).19 
 
 
2.3. Rationale for Proposed Study  
 
GPNMB is a transmembrane protein whose overexpression promotes invasion and metastasis  of 
cancer cells from multiple tissue types and is expressed at high levels in several  malignant 
human tissues, including uveal melanoma, relative to corresponding normal tissue.13,14  GPNMB 
is associated with induction of matrix metalloproteinase -3, which may  provide a mechanism  by 
which this protein promotes tumor invasion. In previous work from MD Anderson Cancer 
Center, IHC analysis of 21 uveal melanoma specimens demonstrated staining in 86% of  samples 
tested.15 The percentage of cells positive per tumor ranged from 10- 90% and the level  of 
GPNMB was of variable intensity (5 tumors 1+; 11 tumors 2+; and 2 tumors  3+). 
 
Because of this high- frequency expression on uveal melanoma cells, targeting GPNMB  with 
CDX- 011 (glembatumumab vedotin) represents a possible t herapeutic avenue. In  previous 
clinical experience using CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin) in cutaneous melanoma  patients, 
overall response rate of 13% was seen in patients treated at the MTD, also known as the Phase  II 
dose. Clinical experience with CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin) in uveal melanoma  patients 
is not yet known and an effective therapy for metastatic uveal melanoma patients is a  current 
unmet  need.  
 
Patients with metastatic uveal melanoma will be eligible regardless of upfront GPNMB  status. 
This is due to the high frequency of GPNMB expression in uveal melanoma samples  (86%) 
noted previously.15 To clarify pharmacodynamics of CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin), 
baseline samples as well as Day 21 on -treatment tumor tissue samples will be  analyzed  
retrospectively for GPNMB  expression.  
 
2.4. Exploratory/Correlative Studies  Background 
Immunophenotype of  patients  
Because GPNMB inhibition with CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin) may alter the  tumor 
microenvironment, we plan as an exploratory endpoint to analyze  immune and inflammatory  cell 
infiltrates in tumor samples. These findings will help coordinate future efforts of  combining 
CDX- 011 (glembatumumab) with either immunotherapy such as checkpoint blockade or  with 
anti-inflammatory agents such as iNOS inhibito rs or triterpenoid anti -inflammatory agents.  The 
timing of combination therapy may be elucidated if infiltrates change in response to  treatment.  
 
The immune effects of targeted therapy in cutaneous melanoma has been described in vitro  as 
well as in patients receiving BRAF -targeted therapy.20 Treatment with either BRAF  inhibitor 
alone or in combination with MEK inhibitor is associated with an increased expression of 
melanoma antigens MART -1 and gp100 and an increase in CD8+ T -cell infiltrate.  Similarly,  
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date: April 2, 2018 
11  
  
immunosuppressive cytokines interleukin- 6 and interleuin- 8 are decreased with treatment  while 
tumor programmed death ligand- 1 (PDL1) increased with  treatment.  
These same markers of immune effects can be measured in uveal melanoma patients  receiving 
targeted therapy with CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin). IHC for melanoma antigens  and 
enumeration of T -cell infiltrate is planned at baseline and after 21 days on  treatment.  
Additionally, evaluation for NK cells, Foxp3+ regulatory T lymphocytes, macrophages 
(CD68+), as well as markers of mature activated dendritic cells (CD40+/CD83+) is planned. It is 
hypothesized that treatment with CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin) will  increase cytotoxic 
CD8+ T -cell infiltrate while decreasing immunosuppressive cytokines. If true, this can form the 
rational basis for timed combination therapy with checkpoint blockade, as was  similarly 
elucidated in cutaneous melanoma patients receiving BRAF -targeted  therapy.21 
 
Correlate rash with  response  
 
In the melanoma study CR011- CLN -11, development of rash, which may be related to the 
presence of GPNMB in the skin, was associated with greater PFS and ORR.18 Rash  also 
correlated with prolonged PFS i n the Phase II breast cancer study (EMERGE), although this 
correlation was not observed in the earlier Phase I/II breast cancer study  (CR011- CLN -20).19 
 
For this study, patients with uveal melanoma will be assessed for development of rash and this 
will be correlated with ORR and  PFS.  
 
3. PATIENT  SELECTION  
 
3.1. Eligibility  Criteria  
 
 
3.1.1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or  locally 
recurrent uveal melanoma. Because histologic or cytologic confirmation of  primary  
uveal melanoma is not always possible the confirmation of the clinical diagnosis  of 
uveal melanoma by the treating investigator is allowed. Clinical diagnosis of  uveal 
melanoma is often made by an ophthalmologist, not by tissue diagnosis. If  an 
ophthalmol ogist diagnosed and treated a patient for uveal melanoma in the past, it  is 
sufficient for a clinical  diagnosis.  
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date: April 2, 2018 
12  
  
3.1.2. Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can  be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded  for 
non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥20 mm (≥2 cm)  with 
conventional techniques or as ≥10 mm (≥1 cm) with spiral CT scan, MRI,  or 
calipers by clinical exam. See Section 11 for the evaluation of measur able disease.  
 
3.1.3. The study will be limited to patients who are chemotherapy -naïve. Patients  may 
have received prior systemic or liver -directed local therapies for advanced  uveal  
melanoma as long as those treatments do not involve chemotherapy. This  includes, 
but is not limited to:, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, , transarterial embolization, 
radiofrequency ablation, or cryoablation. Treatment must be completed at least  28 
days prior to initiation of study therapy. Radiation therapy is also allowed and must 
be completed at least 28 days prior to initiation of study therapy. Lesions treated  via 
radiation or liver -directed therapy may not be used as target lesions unless  they 
demonstrate growth over a minimum of 3 months on subsequent  imaging.  
 
3.1.4. All prior treatment -related toxicities must be CTCAE V5 grade ≤ 1 (except 
alopecia). Certain exceptions apply, such as  immunotherapy -induced 
hypothyroidism or adrenal insufficiency or panhypopituarism requiring stable  doses 
of hormone replacement or rash from prior  therapy.  
 
3.1.5. Age ≥18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently  available 
on the use of CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin) in patients <18 years of  age, 
children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric  trials.  
 
3.1.6. ECOG performance status  ≤2 
 
3.1.7. Life expectancy of greater than 3  months. 
 
3.1.8. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:  
 
− leukocytes  ≥3,000/µL  
− absolute neutrophil  count  ≥1,500/ µL  
− platelets  ≥100,000/ µL  
− total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of  normal  
− AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT)  ≤2.5 × institutional  upper  limit of  normal;  
≤5 x institutional upper limit of normal if liver metastasis  present  
− Creatinine ≤ institutional upper limit of  normal  
OR 
− creatinine clearance  ≥60 mL/m in/1.73 m2 for patients with  creatinine 
levels above institutional  normal  
 
3.1.9. The effects of CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin) on the developing  human 
fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child- bearing potential and men  must  
agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;  
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date: April 2, 2018 
13  
  
abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for  4 
months after last CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin) dose. Women of  child - 
bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior  to 
start of protocol treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she  is 
pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform  her 
treatin g physician immediately.  Men and women treated or enrolled on this 
protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for  the 
duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of  CDX- 011 
(glembatumumab vedotin)  adminis tration.  
 
3.1.10. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed  consent 
document. 
 
3.2. Exclusion Criteria  
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date: April 2, 2018 
14  
  
3.2.1. Patients with a history of another malignancy except for those who have  been  
disease- free for 2 years. Patients with a history of definitively treated  non-melanoma 
skin cancer or squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix are eligible. Patients  with 
definitively treated in -situ cancers are eligible, regardless of  timeframe.  
 
3.2.2. Patients w ith neuropathy > grade  1. 
 
3.2.3. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents. If the patient 
received a previous investigational or other agent or treatment, a washout period of 
4 weeks is  required.  
 
3.2.4. Patients receiving any medications or substances that are substrates  of 
CYP3A4will be closely monitored for toxicity. Because the lists of these agents  are 
constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently -updated list; 
medical referen ce texts such as the Physicians’ Desk Reference may also  provide 
this information. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the  patient 
will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if  new 
medications need to  be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new  over-the- 
counter medicine or herbal  product.  
 
3.2.5. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or  active  
infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,  cardiac 
arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance  with 
study  requirements.  
 
3.2.6. HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral medications that are CYP3 A4 substrates 
will be closely monitored. HIV -positive patients will be excluded if they have  a 
CD4 count <200 as these patients have an increased risk of lethal infections  when 
treated with marrow -suppressive  therapy.  
 
3.2.7. Pregnant or nursing  women. 
 
3.2.8. Patients who have previously received CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin)  or 
other MMAE -containing  agents.  
 
3.2.9. Patients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of  similar 
composition to dolastatin or auristatin (e.g. Auristatin PHE, Auristatin PE,  and 
symplostatin).  
 
 
3.3. Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
 
NIH policy requires that women and members of minority groups and their subpopulations  be 
included in all NIH -supported biomedical and behavioral research projects involving  NIH- 
defined clinical research unless a clear and compelling rationale and justification establishes  to 
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date: April 2, 2018 
15  
  
the satisfaction of the funding Institute & Center (IC) Director that inclusion is  inappropriate  
with respect to the health of the subjects or the purpose of the research. Exclusion under  other 
circumstances must be designated by the Director, NIH, upon the recommendation of an IC 
Director based on a compelling rationale and justification. Cost is not an acceptable reason  for 
exclusion except when the study would duplicate data from other sources. Women of 
childbearing potential should not be routinely excluded from participation in clinical  research.

Help Desk by email at  pmbregpend@ctep.nci.nih.gov.  
 
CTEP Associate Registration Procedures / CTEP -IAM  Account  
 
The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) Identity and Access Management  (IAM) 
application is a web -based application intended for use by both Investigators ( i.e., all physicians 
involved in the conduct of NCI -sponsored clinical trials) and Associates ( i.e., all staff involved in 
the conduct of NCI -sponsored clinical  trials).  
 
Associates will use the CTEP -IAM application to register (both initial registration and annual re- 
registration) with CTEP and to obtain a user  account.  
 
Investigators will use the  CTEP -IAM application to obtain a user account only.  (See  CTEP  
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date: April 2, 2018 
16  
  
Investigator Registration Procedures above for information on registering with CTEP as  an 
Investigator, which must be completed before a CTEP -IAM account can be requested.)  
 
An active CTEP -IAM user account is required to access all CTEP applications and, if  applicable 
(e.g., all Network trials), all Cancer Trials Support Unit (CTSU) applicatio ns and websites.  
 
Additional information can be found on the CTEP website  at

4.2. Site Registration  
This study is supported by the NCI Cancer Trials Support Unit  (CTSU).  
 
Each investigator or group of investigators at a clinical site must obtain Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) approval for this protocol and submit all required regulatory documents  (including  
any protocol specific documents) to the CTSU Regulatory Office before they can be approved  to 
enroll  patients.  
 
The CTSU Regulatory Office tracks receipt of these documents in the CTSU Regulatory  Support 
System (RSS), reviews for compliance, and transmits  site approval data to  CTEP.  
 
Sites participating on the NCI CIRB initiative and accepting CIRB approval for the study are  not 
required to submit separate IRB approval documentation to the CTSU Regulatory Office  for 
initial, continuing, or amendment review   However, sites must submit a Study  Specific 
Worksheet for Local Context (SSW) to the CIRB (via IRBManager) to indicate their intention to 
open the study locally. The CIRB’s approval of the SSW is then communicated to the  CTSU 
Regulatory Office for compliance in the RSS. The Signatory site may be contacted by the CTSU 
Regulatory Office or asked to complete information verifying the participating institutions on  the 
study. Other site registration requirements ( i.e., laboratory certifications, protocol -speci fic 
training certifications, or modality credentialing) must be submitted to the CTSU  Regulatory 
Office or compliance communicated per protocol  instructions.  
 
4.2.1 Downloading Regulatory  Documents  
 
 
Site registration forms may be downloaded from the 9855 protocol page located on the  CTSU 
Web site. Permission to view and download this protocol is restricted and is based on person and

4.3. Patient Registration  Procedures  
  
OPEN/  IWRS  
 
Patient enrollment will be facilitated using the Oncology Patient Enrollment Network  (OPEN). 
OPEN is a web -based registration system available to users on a 24/7 basis. It is integrated  with 
the CTSU Enterprise System for regulatory and roster data interch ange and with the  Theradex  
Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) for retrieval of patient  registration/randomization 
assignment. Patient enrollment data entered by Registrars in OPEN will automatically transfer  to 
the NCI’s clinical data management system , Medidata  Rave.  
 
NCI 9855 will use the IWRS slot reservation system. For trials with slot reservation  
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date: April 2, 2018 
18  
  
requirements, OPEN will connect to IWRS at enrollment initiation to check slot availability. 
Registration staff should ensure that a slot is available and secured for the patient  before 
completing an enrollment. Please refer to the section below for additional instructions on how  to 
use the IWRS slot reservation  system.  
 
The OPEN system will provide the site with a printable confirmation of registration  and 
treatment information.  Please print this confirmation for your  records.  
 
OPEN/IWRS User  Requirements  
 
OPEN users must meet the following  requirements:  
• Have a valid CTEP -IAM account ( i.e., CTEP username and password).  
• To enroll patients or request slot reservations: Be on an ETCTN Corresponding  or 
Participating Organization roster with the role of  Registrar.  
• To approve slot reservations or access cohort management: Be identified to Theradex  as 
the “Client Admin” for the  study.  
• Have regulatory approval for the conduct of the study at their  site. 
 
Prior to accessing OPEN, site staff should verify the  following:  
• All eligibility criteria have been met within the protocol stated timeframes. Site  staff 
should use the registration forms provided on the CTSU web site as a tool to verify 
eligibility.  
• All patients have signed an appropriate consent form and HIPAA authorization form.  
 
 
Patient Enrollment Instructions  
 
• Sites must reserve a slot in IWRS. Each site is allowed 2 slot reservations at a 
time with a 2 day guaranteed hold for each  slot. 
 
• Next, fax the following documents for  review:  
1. Latest clinic  note 
2. Pathology  report  
3. Radiology  report  
 
• Fax to: K. Perdon/S. Patel, MD at (713) 794- 1493. Include your  contact 
information in the fax cover  sheet.  
 
• Each reservation will need to be authorized and approved by an MD  Anderson 
designee prior to registering the patient in OPEN. Once the slot is approved in 
IWRS, you may proceed with registering your patient in OPEN.  
 
Following registration, patients should begin protocol treatment within 7 days. Issues  
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date: April 2, 2018 
19  
  
that would cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Principal Investigator. If 
a patient does not receive protocol therapy following regist ration, the  patient’s 
registration on the study may be canceled. The Study Coordinator should be notified of 
cancellations as soon as  possible.

5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1. CDX- 011 (glembatumumab vedotin)  Administration  
 
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis at a starting dose of  CDX- 011 
(glembatumumab vedotin) of 1.9 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks.  Reported adverse events  and 
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date: April 2, 2018 
20  
  
potential risks are described in Section 7 . Appropriate dose modifications are described  in 
Section 6 . No investigational or commercial agents or therapies other than those  described 
below may be administered with the intent to treat the patient's  malignancy.  
 
• CDX- 011 (glembatumumab vedotin) solution is diluted with 5% dextrose  injection 
before inf usion. CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin) is administered as a  90-minute(+/-  
10 minutes) IV infusion using a 0.22 µm in- line filter at a dose of 1.9 mg/kg IV every  3 
weeks (+/ - 3 days)  
 
• There are no premedications recommended for CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin)  on 
the first dose. Subjects should be carefully monitored for infusion reactions during  CDX - 
011 (glembatumumab vedotin) administration. If an acute infusion reaction is  noted, 
subjects should be managed according to Appendix C.  After symptoms have  resolved, 
the infusion may be resumed at half the initial rate, or as otherwise directed by  the 
attending  physician/PI.  
 
• If an infusion reaction occurs, vital signs should be monitored every 5 minutes  during 
infusion until stable. After infusion is complete, vital signs should be monitored per 
institutional infusion  standard.  
 
• Patients with Grade 3 or 4 infusion related reac tions as defined by CTCAE v.5.0 may  be 
re-challenged with treatment on a case -by-case basis after discussion with Lead PI,  CTEP 
drug monitor, and any others deemed necessary. These cases will be tracked  and 
monitored carefully.  
 
• Actual body weight will be recorded and used to calculate dose prior to each infusion.  
 
 
5.2. General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care  Guidelines  
 
Because there is a potential for interaction of CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin) with other 
concomitantly administered drugs through the cytochrome P450 system, the case report  form 
must capture the concurrent use of all other drugs, over -the-counter medications, or  alternative 
therapies. The Principal Investigator should be alerted if the patient is taking any agent known  to 
affect or  with the potential to affect selected CYP450 isoenzymes, specifically  CYP3A4.  
Appendix B presents guidelines for identifying medications/substances that could potentially 
interact with the study  agent(s).  
 
5.3. Duration of  Therapy  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue until one  of 
the following criteria  applies:  
 
• Disease progression,  
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date: April 2, 2018 
21  
  
 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of  treatment,  
 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
 
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study,  or 
 
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for 
further treatment in the judgment of the  investigator. 
 
5.4. Duration of Follow  Up 
 
Patients will be followed for 30 days after removal from study or until death, whichever  occurs 
first. Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse event(s) will be followed until 
resolution or stabilization of the adverse event. Patients removed prior to progression of  disease 
will be followed for PFS and OS per intent -to-treat analysis.  
 
5.5. Criteria for Removal from  Study  
 
Patients will be removed from study when any of the criteria listed in Section 5.3 applies.  The 
reason for study removal and the date the patient was removed must be documented in the  Case 
Report  Form.  
 
 
 
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE  MODIFICATIONS  
 
CDX- 011 (glembatumumab vedotin) should be administered at a dose of 1.9 mg/kg IV every  3 
weeks. Dosing delays ar e allowed up to 3 weeks. A delay longer than 3 weeks warrants  removal 
from  study.  
 
 
Dose  Level  CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin)  Dose  
0 1.9 mg/kg every 3  weeks  
-1 1.3 mg/kg every 3  weeks  
-2 1 mg/kg every 3  weeks  
 
 
Dose reduction levels are outlined in the table above. Criteria for dose modifications  include 
nausea, diarrhea, and neutropenia and are outlined in the tables below. If a patient  experiences  
several adverse events and there are conflicting recommendations , the investigator should use  the 
recommended dose adjustment that reduces the dose to the lowest  level.

infusion until stable. After infusion is complete, vital signs should be monitored per 
institutional infusion  standard.  
 
• Patients with Grade 3 or 4 infusion related reactions as defined by CTCAE v.5.0 may  be 
re-challenged with treatment on a case -by-case basis after discussion with Lead PI,  CTEP 
drug monitor, and any others deemed necessary. These cases will be tracked  and 
monitored carefully.  
 
 
7. ADVERSE EVENTS: LIST AND REPORTING  REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section 7.2)  will 
determine whether the event requires expedited reporting via the CTEP Adverse Event  Reporting 
System (CTEP -AERS) in addition to routine  reporting.  
 
7.1. Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks List(s) (CAEPRs) for  CDX- 011 
(glembatumumab vedotin) (CDX -011, NSC  763737)  
 
The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list  of 
reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a  uniform 
presentation of events by body system. In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset, the 
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date: April 2, 2018 
24  
  
Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and 
is identified with bold and italicized text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are 
protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI (except as noted below). Refer to the 
'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf  for 
further  clarification.  
Frequency is provided based on 255 patients. Below is the CAEPR for  CDX- 011 
(glembatumumab vedotin)  (CDX -011).  
 
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF they exceed the grade noted in parentheses next  to 
the AE in the SPEER. If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using  multiple 
investigational agents and has an AE listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades  to 
determine if expedited reporting is  required.

Note : CDX- 011 (glembatumumab vedotin) (CDX -011) in combination with other agents  could 
cause an exacerbation of any adverse event currently known to be caused by the other agent, or 
the combination may result in events never previously associated with either  agent.  
  
7.2. Adverse Event  Characteristics  
 
• CTCAE term (AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales  found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  version 
5.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. All appropriate treatment areas should have  access 
to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP web  site 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
 
• For expedited reporting purposes  only:  
- AEs for the agent that are bold and italicized in the CAEPR ( i.e., those  listed 
in the SPEER column, Section 7.1) should be reported through CTEP -AERS 
only if the grade is above the grade provided in the  SPEER.  
- Other AEs for the protocol that do not require expedited report ing are  outlined 
in section  7.3.4. 
 
• Attribution of the  AE: 
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date: April 2, 2018 
28  
  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study  treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study  treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related to the study  treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study  treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study  treatment.  
 
7.3. Expedited Adverse Event Reporting 
 
Expedited AE reporting for this study must use CTEP -AERS (CTEP Adverse Event  Reporting  
System), accessed via the CTEP Web site ( https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers ). The 
reporting procedures to be followed are presented in the “NCI Guidelines for  Investigators: 
Adverse Event Rep orting Requirements for DCTD (CTEP and CIP) and DCP INDs and IDEs” 
which can be downloaded from the CTEP Web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_events.htm ). 
These requirements are briefly outlined in the tables below (Section  7.3.3).  
 
In the rare occurrence when Internet connectivity is lost, a 24- hour notification is to be  made to 
CTEP by telephone at 301- 897-7497. Once Internet connectivity is restored, the  24-hour 
notification phoned in must be entered electronically into CTEP -AERS by the original submitter 
at the  site. 
 
Distribution of Adverse Event  Reports  
 
CTEP -AERS is  programmed for automatic electronic distribution of reports to the  following 
individuals: Principal Investigator and Adverse Event Coordinator(s) (if applicable) of  the 
Corresponding Organization or Lead Organization, the local treating physician, and the  Reporter 
and Submitter.  CTEP -AERS provides a copy feature for other e -mail recipients.  
 
Expedited Reporting  Guidelines  
 
 
Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID assigned during  trial 
registration on all reports.  
 
Note: A death on  study requires both routine and expedited reporting, regardless  of 
causality. Attribution to treatment or other cause must be provided.  
Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Disease  progression” 
in the system organ class (SOC) “General disorders and administration site  conditions.” 
Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease ( e.g., radiological 
changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated with  a 
disease process) should be  submitted.

Investigational Agent/Intervention1, 2 
FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part  312) 
NOTE: Investigators MUST immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or  not 
they are considered related to the investigational  agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event  that results  in inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization for ≥ 24 
hours  
4) A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption of the ability  to conduct  normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or require hospitalization 
may be considered serious when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient  or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH  E6). 
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events  that meet  the above criteria  MUST  be immediately  reported to the NCI via electronic 
submission within the timeframes detailed in the table below.

NOTE: Protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting of serious adverse events are  found 
in the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER) portion of the  CAEPR 
Expedited AE reporting timelines are defined as: 
o “24-Hour; 5 Calendar Days” - The AE must initially be submitted  electronically 
within 24 hours of learning of the AE, followed by a complete expedited report 
within 5 calendar days of the initial 24 -hour report.  
o “10 Calendar Days” - A complete expedited report on the AE must be  submitted  
electronically within 10 calendar days of learning of the  AE. 
1Serious adverse events that occur more than 30 days after the last administration  of 
investigational agent/intervention and have an attribution of possible, probable, or  definite 
require reporting as  follows: 
Expedited 24- hour notification followed by complete report within 5 calendar days  for: 
• All Grade 4, and Grade 5 AEs 
Expedited 10 calendar day reports  for: 
• Grade 2 adverse events resulting in hospitalization or prolongation of  hospitalization 
• Grade 3 adverse  events  
2For studies using PET or SPECT IND agents, the AE reporting period is limited to  10 
radioactive half -lives, rounded UP to the nearest whole day, after the agent/intervention was 
last administered.  Footnote “1” above  applies after this reporting  period.

7.4. Routine Adverse Event  Reporting 
 
All Adverse Events must be reported in routine study data submissions. AEs  reported 
expeditiously through CTEP -AERS must also be reported in routine study data  submissions. 
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date: April 2, 2018 
31  
  
 
The following paragraph only applies to trials using Medidata Rave ; other trials may  delete: 
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are 
done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll  in 
future studies using similar agents. AEs are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times 
during the trial using Medidata Rave.  For this trial the Advers e Event CRF is used for  routine 
AE reporting in  Rave.  
 
7.5. Secondary  Malignancy  
 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous malignancy  (e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A  secondary  
malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm. 
 
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under  an 
NCI IND/IDE be reported expeditiously via CTEP -AERS. Three options are available  to 
describe the  event:  
 
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy ( e.g., acute myelocytic 
leukemia  [AML]) 
• Myelodysplastic syndrome  (MDS) 
• Treatment -related secondary  malignancy  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be 
reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 
Indicate form for reporting in Rave, timeframes, and if loading of the pathology report  is 
required.  
 
7.6. Second Malignancy  
 
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT  a 
metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require ONLY routine  AE 
reporting unless otherwise  specified.  
 
 
8. PHARMACEUTICAL  INFORMATION 
 
A list of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the investigational  agent 
administered in this study can be found in Section 7.1. 
 
 
8.1. CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin), NSC  763737)  
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date: April 2, 2018 
32  
  
8.1.1 Classification:  monoclonal  IgG2  antibody (CR0111)  conjugate  to monomethyl - 
Auristatin E  (MMAE)  
 
8.1.2 CAS registry number:  1182215- 65-1 
 
8.1.3 Mode of  Action:  
 
CDX- 011 combines a tumor -targeting antibody with a potent cytotoxic microtubule  inhibitor, 
monomethylauristatin E (MMAE). The fully -human IgG2 monoclonal antibody, CR011, is 
directed against glycoprotein NMB (gpNMB), a transmembrane protein which is  highly 
expressed in breast cancer and other  tumors.  
 
8.1.4 Availability / How  supplied:  
 
CDX- 011 is supplied by Celldex Therapeutics and distributed by the CTEP, DCTD, NCI. CDX - 
011 drug product solution (injection concentrate) contains CDX -011, Sucrose NF, Histidine 
USP, Histidine -Hydrochloride Monohydrate EP, and Polysorbate 20 NF, at pH of 6.0 ± 0.5. It  is 
supplied in 10 mL Clear Type -I glass vials with stoppers and aluminum crimp seals  containing 
50 mg per vial (5 mg/mL, 10 mL).  
 
8.1.5 Storage:  
 
Store intact vials at 2° -8°C (36°- 46°F). The prepared dilution may be stored in the infusion bag 
at ambient room te mperature (15 -  25°C [59 -  77°F]) for not more than 8 hours before  infusion.  
 
8.1.6 Stability: Stability of the intact vials is  ongoing.  
 
8.1.7 Route of  Adinistration: IV infusion only  
 
8.1.8 Preparation /  Administration: 
 
CDX- 011 solution must be further diluted in 250 mL of 5% Dextrose. The  prepared  
dilution is administered as an IV infusion through an in- line 0.22 micron filter over  90- 
minutes.  
 
8.1.9 Dose: The starting dose of CDX -011 is 1.9 mg/kg every 3 weeks.The appropriate  dose 
of CDX -011 should be re -calculated for each dose based on the current weight of the  patient. 
Doses may be rounded to the nearest 0.1 mL (0.5 mg). 
 
8.1.10 Side Effects:  See CAEPR (s ection  7) 
 
8.1.11 Potential Interactions:  
 
The effect of CDX -011 on the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of other drugs has  not 
been studied. To date, there have been no unexpected interactions observed between CDX -011 
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date: April 2, 2018 
33  
  
and other  drugs.  
 
In a st udy of a different antibody drug -conjugate containing MMAE, brentuximab 
vedotin, free MMAE was primarily excreted in the feces, although this represents a  minor 
component of elimination. MMAE was also found to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 
(CYP3A4) and co- administration of ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased MMAE 
exposure by approximately one -third (Adcetris [brentuximab vedotin] package insert, September 
2013 and FDA Approval Package). Therefore, drugs known to strongly inhi bit CYP3A4  should 
be used with caution while patients are exposed to CDX -011, and patients should be  closely 
monitored for adverse  reactions.  
 
Co-administration of brentuximab vedotin with rifampin, a potent CYP3A4 inducer, 
reduced exposure to MMAE by almost 50%. Concomitant administration of drugs known to be 
potent CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided, if at all  possible. 
 
Because the concentration of free MMAE is very low, if potent  CYP3A4 -modifying 
drugs are administered concomitantly with CDX -011, dose modifications of CDX -011 are  not 
recommended unless necessitated by  toxicity.  
 
In addition, MMAE is also a substrate of the efflux transporter P -glycoprotein  (P-gp). 
Co- administration of brentuximab vedotin with P -gp inhibitors may increase exposure  to 
MMAE; thus, per the brentuximab package insert (September 2013), patients who are  receiving 
P-gp inhibitors concomitantly with brentuximab vedotin should also be closely monitored for 
adverse  reactions.  
 
8.1.12 Agent  ordering  
 
The responsible investigator at eac h participating institution must be registered  with 
CTEP, DCTD through an annual submission of FDA Form 1572 (Statement of  Investigator), 
Curriculum Vitae, Supplemental Investigator Data Form (IDF), and Financial Disclosure  Form 
(FDF). If there are several  participating investigators at one institution,  CTEP -supplied 
investigational agents for the study should be ordered under the name of one lead investigator  at 
that institution  
 
Active CTEP -registered investigators and investigator -designated shipping des ignees  and 
ordering designees can submit agent requests through the PMB Online Agent Order  Processing 
(OAOP) application ( https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/OAOP/pages/login.jspx ). Access to  OAOP  
requires the establishment of a CTEP Identity and Access Management (IAM)  account 
(https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/iam/ ) and the maintenance of an “active” account status and  a 
“curren t” password.  
 
Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) policy requires that drug be shipped directly 
to the institution where the patient is to be treated. PMB does not permit the transfer of  agents 
between  institutions.  
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date:  April 2, 2018  
  
Questions about drug orders, transfers, returns, or accountability should be addressed to

For full details, refer to  Appendices  
Background  
 
CDX- 011 (glembatumumab vedotin) is an antibody -drug conjugate d irected against  GPNMB. 
Therefore, tumor expression of GPNMB is expected to correlate with response to treatment.  As 
preliminary evidence suggests uveal melanomas highly express GPNMB (86% of  samples  
positive)18, patients will not be screened prior to treatment. However, to  clarify 
pharmacodynamics of CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin), pre -study tumor samples as well as 
on-treatment tumor samples will be analyzed retrospectively for GPNMB expression. The  effect  
of CDX- 011 (glembatumumab vedotin) on GPNMB expression will be studied from the  second 
tumor sample, and is a mandatory component for all patients on study. Patients also have  the 
option for tissue acquisition and analysis for GPNMB at the time of progression of disease.  The 
purpose of this biopsy is to evaluate mechanisms of resistance to treatment.  There is  no 
minimum number of patients required to undergo a biopsy at progression as information on even 
a modicum of patients is an opportunity to learn about resistance. ORR and PFS are expected  to 
correlate with presence of  GPNMB.

9.4. Exploratory/Ancillary Correlative  Studies  
 
Immunophenotype of Patients Treated with CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin)  
 
As an optional correlative endeavor, we plan to utilize metastatic tumor tissue samples  at 
baseline and after 1 cycle of treatment (+/ - 3 days) and at progression of disease to characterize 
the immune cell and inflammatory infiltrates in uveal melanoma tumors. We will capitalize  on 
outstanding efforts with the MD Anderson Melanoma MoonShot Bios pecimen team for  tissue

acquisition and will collaborate with experienced immunology and melanoma laboratories  to 
analyze via immunohistochemistry tumor cells for CD4, CD8, Foxp3, CD68, CD40, CD83, 
TGF -beta, MIF, IDO, IFN -gamma, PD -L1, iNOS, NT, Cox -2, SNO, Arginase, NFkB, pSTAT3,  
Bcl-2. To minimize interpersonal variations and maximize consistency, computerized barcode - 
driven automatic immunostainers will be used to increase precision of  results.  
 
 
Background and  Hypothesis  
 
The etiology behind the poor response to therapy in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma  is 
not clear, however several factors may contribut e to this. The innate immune system  includes 
natural killer (NK) cells, granulocytes, and macrophages and is capable of inducing  ocular 
damage. This is balanced by a variety of anti -inflammatory cytokines and scavengers of  free 
radical species that neutral ize pro -inflammatory markers. The eye has evolved to become an 
immune privileged organ to protect itself from damage associated with inflammation because  its 
capacity for tissue regeneration is  restricted.  
 
The adaptive immune system, represented mainly by activated cytotoxic T -lymphocytes, is 
capable of recognizing viral and tumor antigens that are appropriately presented in the context  of 
major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules. MHC class  I is expressed  on 
normal human tissues and prevents NK -cell mediated destruction. Interestingly, MHC class I  is 
expressed at very low levels in the eye (8, 10, 11) NK -cell mediated cytotoxic activity that is 
normally prompted by lack of MHC class I expres sion is neutralized in the eye by  macrophage 
migration inhibitor factor (MIF) and by transforming growth factor -beta (TGF -beta). PD -L1, a 
member of the B7 family of membrane proteins, is expressed in the human eye and serves  to 
down- regulate T -cell prolife ration.  Together, these mechanisms lead to down regulation of  T 
cell activation and apoptosis of inflammatory cells in the microenvironment of the eye, and 
preserving the antigen privileged state of the  eye. 
 
Notably, 40% of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes  (TIL) isolated from primary uveal melanomas  
express NK -cell markers. But NK -cell mediated cytolysis of uveal melanoma tumor  tissue 
lacking MHC class I expression is inhibited by TGF -beta and MIF in the aqueous humor of  the 
eye. Once metastatic, uveal melanomas preferentially metastasize to the liver in 90% of  cases. 
Although the liver houses the highest concentration of NK cells in the body, which would 
otherwise rapidly eliminate cells lacking MHC class I expression (such as uveal  melanomas),  
uveal melanomas have instead adopted strategies employed in the ocular environment to block 
NK-cell mediated cytolysis.  This includes increasing MIF secretion to twice the levels  of 
primary uveal melanoma as well as up -regulating MHC Class I expression 10- fold in comparison 
to primary uveal melanomas. Finally, TGF -beta2, an isoform of TGF -beta that suppresses  NK 
cells, is expressed by metastatic uveal  melanomas.  
 
There is also evidence that uveal melanomas have an altered response to adaptive T  cell- 
mediated immunity, though this has not been thoroughly studied. One mechanism of this  is 
through increased indoleamine 2,3- dioxygenase (IDO) expression in the eye. T -lymphocytes  are 
dependent upon tryptophan for their metabolism and are una ble to survive in the absence of  this 
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date:  April 2, 2018 
37  
  
key building block amino acid. IDO catalyzes tryptophan degradation leading to termination of 
T-cell activation. IDO is expressed in many ocular tissues and is thought to be a str ategy  for 
further evasion of immune surveillance by uveal melanomas. Although IDO expression is 
dynamic, it is induced by interferon (IFN) -gamma exposure.  Therefore, uveal melanoma  cells 
can generate IDO in the presence of innate or adaptive immune elemen ts such as  IFN-gamma.  
Likewise, IFN -gamma induces expression of programmed death ligand -1 (PD -L1) on  primary 
and metastatic uveal melanoma cell lines. PD -L1 contributes to immune privilege by  interacting  
with its receptor PD -1 on T cells leading to down- regulation of T lymphocytes. Taken together, 
uveal melanoma cells are genetically programmed to respond to a pro -inflammatory  environment 
(via IFN -gamma) and upregulate T -lymphocyte suppressive pathways su ch as IDO and PD -L1 to 
counteract immune -mediated surveillance and elimination. While this has been seen in tumors 
such as cutaneous melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, the mechanism of PD -L1 upregulation in 
uveal melanoma remains  unknown. 
 
The inflammatory  microenvironment has been implicated in tumor growth in adult  cancers, 
including melanoma.  Inflammation is often induced hand- in-hand by immune cells  and 
cytokines and chemokines which promote reactive oxygen and nitrogen species to potentiate 
tumor progression. Cytokine -drive inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) iNOS has been shown 
to promote a pro- oxidant and pro- inflammatory state in melanoma.  Expression of iNOS in  vivo 
is prognostic of poor survival as patients whose melanomas express higher levels  of iNOS  have 
decreased survival. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species react with proteins intra- tumorally  via 
S-nitrosylation (SNO) and nitration of tyrosines (NT). This post -translational modification  of 
proteins is irreversible and can alter antigenicit y. For example, nitrosylation of the MHC Class  I 
receptor inhibits presentation of tumor antigen to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. NF -kB represents 
another pro- inflammatory cancer target gene where tumor cell cytotoxicity is related to  NF-kB 
expression.  NF -kB inhibits anti -oxidation and activates anti -apoptotic genes (Bcl -2) in addition 
to upregulating other factors involved in metastasis such as angiogenesis and expression of  of 
immunosuppressive mediators (Arginase, Cox -2, STAT3  activation).  
 
Based on the immu ne privilege of the eye and the low level of cytotoxic T cell infiltrate  in 
primary uveal melanomas associated with elevated inhibitory cytokines TGF -beta and MIF,  we 
expect a similar infiltrate in metastatic uveal melanomas where we mechanisms for  immune 
evasion likely persist. Immunphenotype in metastatic tumor tissue is expected to be of  low 
cytotoxic T cell quantity with high inhibitory, regulatory, and inflammatory markers.   Markers 
to be evaluated include, but are not limited to: CD4, CD8, Foxp3, CD68, CD40, CD83, TGF - 
beta, MIF, IDO, IFN -gamma, PD -L1, iNOS, NT, Cox -2, SNO, Arginase, NFkB, pSTAT3, Bcl-2. 
 
Tissue quality will be variable in metastatic tumors as they will consist mainly of core  needle 
biopsies from various metastatic sites. To address t his, all slides will undergo path  quality 
control by a dermatopathologist, and areas of viable tumor will be circled on each  slide.  
 
This work is currently funded by a peer -reviewed institutional research grant to  investigate  
differential immunophenotypes in uveal melanoma. Preliminary data is from the grant is  not 
currently  available.

Methods  
 
For this optional exploratory correlative analysis, MD Anderson Cancer Center  (MDACC)  
patients will be co -consented to protocol 2012- 0846, a laboratory collection and use  protocol 
entitled “Longitudinal biopsy tissue acquisition protocol” or awarded institutional funds will  be 
used to cover biopsy costs. Non- MDACC sites will obtain tissue for optional correlative  studies 
per local institutional guidelines. Archival tissue at baseline in the form of  formalin -fixed, 
paraffin -embedded tumor tissue can be utilized. On- treatment optional tumor tissue will be 
obtained after the first cycle of tre atment (+/ - 3 days) and can be piggybacked onto the 
mandatory clinical trial biopsy that occurs at this timepoint for GPNMB expression.  At 
progression of disease, patients have the option to undergo another tumor biopsy for  correlative 
studies. Tissue may be obtained via incisional biopsy, excisional biopsy, core needle biopsy, or 
fine needle  aspiration. 
 
These tumor samples will be analyzed via immunohistochemistry for the following  markers: 
CD4, CD8, Foxp3, CD68, CD40, CD83, TGF -beta, MIF, IDO, IFN -gamma,  PD-L1, iNOS,  NT, 
Cox-2, SNO, Arginase, NFkB, pSTAT3, Bcl -2. The relative percentages and changes in of  these 
immune infiltrates will be descriptively  summarized.  IntelliPATH FLX™ Automated  Slide 
Staining System will be used to perform immunohistochemistry . This system increases  the 
reproducibility of results using barcode -drive immunostainers to dispense reagents, control 
washing, mixing, heating, and to optimize reaction kinetics. This system is compatible  with 
reagents from any source, thereby increasing  ease of use, and is currently utilized in MDACC 
laboratories. RT -PCR will be used to monitor cytokine expression in the  tumor 
microenvironment. Flow cytometry -based analysis will used to monitor the population of 
cytokine producing T  cells.  
 
 
Collection of  Specimens(s)  
 
Metastatic tumor tissue will be collected at baseline (archival tissue is allowed) as well as  after 
the first cycle of treatment (+/-  3 days). Core biopsies will be performed using a  21-gauge 
needle or institutional protocol for  safe tissue  acquisition.  
 
Handling of  Specimens(s)  
 
a. Tissue will be fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in 
paraffin per local  procedures.  
b. Samples will be adhered as 4 -µm sections to glass slides (no minimum  or 
maximum number of slides are  required).  
c. Slides will be evaluated by a dedicated dermatopathologist who will identify 
areas of viable tumor  tissue.

Site(s) Performing Correlative  Study  
 
MD Anderson Cancer Center will perform the correlative studies described in this  section. 
Statistical Analysis  
The relative percentages of immune and inflammatory infiltrates will be  descriptively 
summarized by a dedicated dermatopathologist for each time point. Paired t -tests or  Wilcoxon 
signed -rank tests will be used to compare infiltrate percentages by time poin t. In addition, the 
levels of infiltrates from each time point and the change in infiltrate between time points will be 
compared with clinical outcomes such as time to progression using Kaplan -Meier  survival  
curves, Cox proportional hazards regression, and t -tests or Wilcoxon rank sum  tests.  
 
If possible, two group t -tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be used to compare infiltrates  by 
tissue type (hepatic, extra- hepatic) or by gene expression profile, if that data is available  about 
the primary uveal  melanoma 
 
Correlation of Rash with Clinical Benefit 
Background and  Hypothesis  
In the melanoma Phase I/II study CR011- CLN -11, development of rash of any grade, which may 
be related to the presence of GPNMB in the skin, within the first 21 days of treatment  was 
associated with greater PFS and ORR.18 Patients who developed rash in cycle 1 had a  median 
PFS of 4.4 months compared with PFS of 1.3 months in patients who did not develop a rash (HR 
0.37, P =0.001). Rash also correlated with prolonged PFS in the Phase II  breast cancer  study 
(EMERGE), although this correlation was not observed in the earlier Phase I/II breast  cancer 
study (CR011- CLN -20).19   For this study, we expect development of rash in cycle 1 will 
similarly correlate with improvement in PFS and  ORR.

11. MEASUREMENT OF  EFFECT  
 
 
11.1. Antitumor Effect – Solid  Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response every 6 weeks.  In 
addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained not less than 4 weeks 
following initial documentation of objective  response.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international  criteria 
proposed by  the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)  guideline 
(version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca 45:228- 247, 2009]. Changes in the largest diameter  (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant  lymph 
nodes are used in the RECIST  criteria.  
 
Definitions  
 
Evaluable for toxicity . All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their  first 
treatment with CDX -011 (glembatumumab  vedotin). 
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date:  April 2, 2018 
43  
  
Evaluable for objective response. Only those patients who have measurable disease present  at 
baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated  will 
be considered evaluable for response.  These patients will have their response  classified  
accordi ng to the definitions stated below. (Note: Patients who exhibit objective  disease 
progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable Non- Target Disease Response. Patients who have lesions present at baseline that  are 
evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one  cycle 
of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated will be considered evaluable for  non-target  
disease. The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal  progression 
of the  lesions. 
 
Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease. Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured  in 
at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 20 mm (≥2 c m) by chest x -ray or  as 
≥10 mm (≥1 c m) with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. All tumor  measurements 
must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of  centimeters).  
 
Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be 
considered measurable. If the investigator thinks it appropriate to include them, the  conditions 
under which such lesions should be considered must be defined in the  protocol. 
 
Malignant lymph nodes. To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a  lymph 
node must be ≥ 15 mm (≥1.5 c m) in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan  slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm [0.5 cm]). At baseline and in follow -up, 
only the short ax is will be measured and  followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease. All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions  (longest 
diameter <10 mm [<1 cm] or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm [≥ 1 to <1.5 cm] 
short axis), are considered non- meas urable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal  disease,  
ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease,  
and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as  non-measurable.  
 
Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are,  by 
definition, simple  cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases  can be considered as measurable  lesions, 
if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic lesions  are 
present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target  lesions. 
 
Target lesions. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions  in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and  recorded 
and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size  (lesions  
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date:  April 2, 2018 
44  
  
with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be 
those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion does  not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which 
circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A 
sum of the diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all  target 
lesions wi ll be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to  be 
included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum  diameters 
will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regr ession in the  measurable 
dimension of the  disease.  
 
Non-target lesions . All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions  over 
and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non -target lesions and should also be 
recorded at b aseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence,  absence,  
or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout  follow -up. 
 
Methods for Evaluation of Measurable  Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and r ecorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment  and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the  treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize  each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging- based evaluation  is 
preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being  followed cannot  be 
imaged but are assessable by clinical  exam.  
 
Clinical lesions Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are  superficial  
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm (≥1 cm) diameter as assessed  using  
calipers ( e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color  photography, 
including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is  recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is  preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm (0.5 cm) or less. If CT scans have  slice 
thickness greater than 5 mm (0.5 cm), the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be  twice 
the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body  scans).  
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and  temporal  
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which  greatly 
impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability  of 
MRI is variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of  the 
scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of  disease.  
Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up shoul d be the same as was used  at 
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date:  April 2, 2018

baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is  beyond 
the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for  all 
scanners, body parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the 
image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body  scans 
should be performed with breath- hold scanning techniques, if  possi ble. 
 
PET- CT At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET -CT is 
not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if 
the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is  of identical  diagnostic 
quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can  be 
used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT  in 
accurately measuring cancer lesions over time. No te, however, that the PET portion of the  CT 
introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or  serially 
performed.  
 
Ultrasound Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as  a 
method of meas urement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety  for 
independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot  be 
guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to  the 
next. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by  CT 
or MRI is advised. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead 
of CT in selected  instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete  pathological 
response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence  following 
complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an  endpoint. 
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or  worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease  is 
mandatory  to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect  of 
the treatment) and progressive  disease.  
 
FDG -PET While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is  sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning  in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease). New lesions on the basis  of 
FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following  algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is  a 
sign of PD based on a new  lesion. 
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: If  the 
positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of  disease 
confirmed by CT, this is PD. If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not 
confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow -up CT  scans 
are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that  site 
(if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET 
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date:  April 2, 2018 
46  
  
scan). If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a  pre-existing 
site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the  anatomic 
images, this is not PD. 
c. FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner  similar 
to a biopsy i n cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is  thought 
to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in  this 
circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol  and 
supported by disease -specific medical literature for the  indication. 
However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false 
positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and  biopsy 
resolution/sensitivity.  
 
Note: A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an 
uptake greater than twice t hat of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected 
image.  
 
Response  Criteria 
Evaluation of Target  Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph  nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction i n short axis to <10 mm (<1 cm). 
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target  lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum  diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target  lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is  the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonst rate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm (0.5 cm). (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions  is 
also considered  progressions). 
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase  to 
qualify for PD, taking a s reference the smallest sum diameters while on  study. 
 
Evaluation of Non- Target  Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of  tumor 
marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm [<1  cm] short  axis).  
 
Note: If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for  a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical  response. 
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of  tumor 
marker level above the normal  limits.  
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date:  April 2, 2018 
47  
  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or  unequivocal 
progression of existing non- target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally  trump  
target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion 
increase.  
 
Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of  the 
treating physician should prevail in such circums tances, and the progression status should be 
confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal  Investigator).  
 
Evaluation of Best Overall  Response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment  until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment  will 
depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation  of

“symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should be made to document the  objective 
progression even after discontinuation of  treatment.

Duration of  Response  
 
Duration of overall response : The duration of overall response is measured from the  time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for  progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatmen t started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for  CR 
until the first date that progressive disease is objectively  documented.  
 
Duration of stable disease : Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started, including the baseline  measurements.

13. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
13.1. Study  Design/Endpoints  
 
This trial is a single -arm, open -label Phase II study of CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin)  in 
patients with metastatic uveal melanoma. The primary endpoint is overall response rate  (ORR) 
using RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints include GPNMB expression, progres sion- free survival  
(PFS), overall survival (OS), safety and toxicity. Exploratory endpoints include  characterizing 
the anti -tumor immunophenotype of patients receiving CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin)  as 
well as post -hoc correlation of rash with PFS and ORR . Simon’s two- stage design will be  used 
to monitor the primary  endpoint. 
 
All patients who receive study drug will be eligible for evaluation of the primary endpoint  of 
ORR. All patients who receive study drug will also be evaluated for secondary endpoints  of 
PFS, OS, safety, toxicity, and GPNMB  expression. 
 
Toxicity will be reported by type, frequency, and severity according to the NCI  Common 
Toxicity Criteria v5.0. All patients who receive any amount of study drug will be evaluable  for 
toxicity.  
 
13.2. Sample S ize and Power /Accrual  Rate 
 
The historical response rate to metastatic treatments in this population is 5%. We will target a 
24% ORR in GPNMB -positive patients. We expect the ORR in GPNMB -negative patients to  be 
close to zero, and we assume 15% of uveal m elanoma patients will be GPNMB -negative  based  
on prior evidence.15 Thus, overall we will target a (0.24 * 85%) + (0 * 15%) = 20% ORR. We 
will use a Simon’s two -stage design.22   In the first stage, 18 evaluable patients will be  enrolled  
52 
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date:  April 2, 2018 
53  
  
and assessed for response. If no responses are seen, the study will stop and reject  CDX- 011 
(glembatumumab vedotin) for further study in this population. If at least 1 response is seen,  the 
study will proceed with stage 2 where 14 additional patients will be enrolled and evaluated for 
response. For logistical purposes, after 18 patients have been enrolled, Stage 2 will not  begin 
until at least one patient has experienced a response. At the end of the trial, if at least 4  patients 
have an objective response, the trial will be declared a success, and CDX -011 (glembatumumab 
vedotin) will be considered for future study. If 3 or fewer patients have an objective  response, 
the drug will be  rejected.  
 
If the true ORR is 5%, the probability that the study terminates after the first stage is 39.7%,  and 
the probability that the drug is incorrectly considered for future study (Type I error) is 7.2%. If 
the true ORR is 20%, the probability that the drug is  incorrectly rejected (Type II error) is  9.8%  
 
Patients will be enrolled at MD Anderson Cancer Center at an expected rate of 2 -3 patients  per 
month. 32 evaluable patients are needed for statistical analysis in Stage 1 and Stage 2. Allowing 
for attrition of  patients who do not remain on study long enough to be evaluable for the  primary 
endpoint, the maximum enrollment for this study will be 35  patients.

13.3. Stratification  Factors 
N/A 
13.4. Analysis of Secondary  Endpoints  
 
Analysis of secondary endpoints will be exploratory and hypothesis -generating. For  secondary 
endpoints, all eligible patients will be included in the  analyses.  
 
GPNMB  expression  
 
GPNMB IHC will be performed retrospectively on baseline tumor tissue in all p atients  included 
on study. GPNMB IHC will also be performed on tumor tissue on all patients at Day 21 on 
study. Changes in percentage of GPNMB -positive tumor cells will be reported and  descriptive 
statistics will be used to further report staining intensit y and frequency in baseline and on- 
treatment tumor  samples.  
 
In testing the analytical performance and precision of GPNMB IHC, sections from 3  human 
melanoma tissues and 2 cell lines were stained in 6 replicates on a single batch and scored by  one 
pathologist.  The differences in percentage of the stained cells ranged from  0-6%. 
 
Because samples from this study are going to be analyzed retrospectively in one batch  and 
scored by the same pathologist, a change in GPNMB expression greater than 10% will  be 
considered a positive  signal. 
 
Progression- free survival (PFS) overall survival  (OS).  
 
PFS and OS survival curves will be calculated using the method of Kaplan -Meier. Median  PFS 
and OS will be reported with 95% confidence intervals. All patients who receive study drug will 
be followed for PFS and OS. 
 
Safety  Analysis  
 
Toxicity will be reported by type, frequency, and severity according to the NCI  Common 
Toxicity  Criteria.  
 
Toxici ty will be continuously monitored in all patients who receive study drug and reported in 
real time to the local PI as the study team is made aware. Toxicity will also be reviewed  at 
monthly protocol meetings at each enrolling site. If multiple sites register patients, a  monthly 
teleconference will be scheduled to review safety and toxicity in aggregate as well as  patient 
outcomes. 
NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date:  April 2, 2018 
55  
  
 
13.5. Reporting and  Exclusions 
Evaluation of  Toxicity  
All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of the ir first treatment with  CDX- 011 
(glembatumumab  vedotin). 
 
Evaluation of  Response  
 
All patients included in the study must be assessed for response to treatment, even if there  are 
major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible. Each patient will be assigned one  of 
the following categories: 1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) 
progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) e arly death from toxicity, 7)  early 
death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data). [Note:  By 
arbitrary convention, category 9 usually designates the “unknown” status of any type of data in a 
clinical  database.]  
 
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of those  who 
received no study medication) should be included in the main analysis of the response rate. If  a 
patient does not receive study drug, then he or she will not be evaluated for ORR, PFS,  OS, 
GPNMB expression, safety, or toxicity and the position in statistical analysis will be replaced by 
an evaluable patient.  Patients in response categories 4 -9 should be considered to have  a 
treatment failure (disease progression) . Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or  drug 
administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate. Precise 
definitions for categories 4 -9 will be protocol  specific.  
 
All conclusions should be based on all eligible patients. Subanalyses may then be performed  on 
the basis of a subset of patients, excluding those for whom major protocol deviations have  been 
identified ( e.g., early death due to other reasons, early discontinuation of treatment, major 
protocol violations, etc.). However, these subanalyses may not serve as the basis for  drawing 
conclusions concerning treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from  the 
analysis should be clearly reported.  The 95% confidence intervals should also be  provided.

APPENDIX B INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE DRUG  INTERACTIONS  
 
Information on Possible Interactions with Other Agents for Patients and Their Caregivers  and 
Non-Study Healthcare Team  
 
The patient  is enrolled on a clinical trial using  the 
experimental agent CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin) . This clinical trial is sponsored  by 
the National Cancer Institute. This form is addressed to the patient, but includes  important 
information for others who care for this  patient.  
 
CDX- 011 (glembatumumab vedotin) interacts with many drugs that are processed by your  liver. 
Because of this, it is very important to tell your study doctors about all of your medicine  before 
you sta rt this study. It is also very important to tell them if you stop taking any regular  medicine, 
or if you start taking a new medicine while you take part in this study. When you talk about  your 
medicine with your study doctor, include medicine you buy without a prescription at the  drug 
store (over -the-counter remedy), or herbal supplements such as St. John’s  wort.  
 
Many health care prescribers can write prescriptions. You must also tell your other  prescribers 
(doctors, physicians’ assistants or nurse practit ioners) that you are taking part in a clinical trial. 
Bring this paper with you and keep the attached information card in your wallet . These  are 
the things that you and they need to know:  
 
CDX- 011 (glembatumumab vedotin) interacts with (a) certain specific enzyme(s) in your  liver.  
• The enzyme(s) in question is/are CYP3A4 , and CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin)  is 
broken down by this enzyme in order to be cleared from your  system.  
• CDX- 011 (glemba tumumab vedotin) must be used very carefully with other  medicines  
that need these liver enzymes to be effective or to be cleared from your  system.  
• Other medicines may also affect the activity of the  enzyme.  
o Substances that increase the enzyme’s activity (“inducers”) could reduce  the 
effectiveness of the drug, while substances that decrease the enzyme’s  activity 
(“inhibitors”) could result in high levels of the active drug, increasing the  chance 
of harmful side  effects.  
• You and healthcare providers who prescribe drugs for you must be careful about  adding 
or removing any drug in this  category.  
• Before you start the study, your study doctor will work with your regular prescriber  to 
switch any medicines that are considered “strong inducers/inhibitors or substrates  of 
CYP3A4 . 
• Your prescribers should consult a medical reference to see if any medicine they want  to 
prescribe is on a list of drugs to avoid.  
• Please be very careful! Over -the-counter drugs have a brand name on the  label —it’s 
usually big and catches your eye. They also have a generic name—it’s usually small and 
located above or below the brand name, and printed in the ingredient list. Find the 
generic name and determine, with the pharmacist’s help, whether there could be  an 
adverse  interaction.  
60 NCI Protocol #:9855  
Version Date:  April 2, 2018  
  
• Be careful:  
o If you take acetaminophen regularly: You should not take more than 4 grams  a 
day if you are an adult or 2.4 grams a day if you are older than 65 years of  age. 
Read labels carefully! Acetaminophen is an ingredient in many medicines  for 
pain, flu, and cold. 
o If you drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit: Avoid these until the study  is over.  
o If you take herbal medicine regularly: You should not take St. John’s wort  while 
you are taking CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin). 
o If you take the blood thinner warfarin. INR levels may be affected by 
concomitant administration of warfarin with CDX -011 (glembatumumab 
vedotin). Additionally, the effectiveness of CDX -011 (glembatumumab  vedotin) 
may be affected by warfarin  metabolism.  
o If you take antifungals such as ketoconazole as these medicines lead to  decreased  
levels of CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin) and may result in decreased  anti- 
tumor  activity.  
 
Other medicines can be a problem with your study  drugs.  
 
• You should check with your doctor or pharmacist whenever you need to 
use an over -the-counter medicine or herbal  supplement. 
 
• Your regular prescriber should check a medical reference or call  your 
study doctor before prescribing any new medicine for you. Your  study 
doctor’s name  is 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and he or she can be contacted  at

 1. Background & Rationale  
Aimovig ® [erenumab (EREN) ] is a  first in class FDA -approved human monoclonal antibody 
(UmAb) for the prevention of migraine  in adults . It selectively targets and blocks the calcitonin 
gene- related peptide (CGRP) receptor, disrupting a key component of migraine pathophysiology  
(Hargreaves & Olesen, 2019) . Several studies have provided evidence of the safety and efficacy 
of Aimovig®  in reducing the frequency of migraine compared to placebo (Goadsby et al., 2017; 
Tepper et al., 2017) . Furthermore, an open -label longer -term study found that Aimovig®  was safe 
and well -tolerated with a safety profile consistent with shorter -term placebo- controlled studies  
(Ashina et al., 2020 ), through 5- years of treatment . Aimovig ® has rapidly become a widely 
accepted prescription drug for the prevention of migraines, including e pisodic migraine and 
chronic migraine ( CM) along with other anti- CGRP monoclonal antibody -based therapies ( Yuan 
et al., 2019).   
Temporomandibular Disorder s (TMD ) are known to be co -morbid with the medical diagnosis of 
CM (Speciali, 2015) . TMD symptoms are numerous and chronic in nature (see appendix A)  and 
TMD treatments are more numerous than symptoms and are predictable only in their 
unpredictability (see Appendix B) . Most patients  experiencing TMD find it to be a chronic, 
untreatable condition. In the US alone, TMDs are the second most commonly occurring 
musculoskeletal conditions resulting in pain and disability (after chronic low back pain), affecting 
approximately 5 to 12% of the population, with an annual cost estimated at $4 billion (NIH/NIDCR) . 
There is increasing interest in the concept of Chronic Overlapping Pain Conditions (COPCs), 
which include TMD , fibromyalgia , irritable bowel syndrome, vulvodynia, myalgic 
encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, endometriosis, chronic tension- type headache, migraine headache, and chronic lower back pain 
that may have common biopsychosocial factors ( Maixner  et al., 2016) . 
Co-Principal Investigator, Dr. Harold C. Avila , has treated  several patients that presented with 
chronic TMD pain and a history of migraines headaches, which have respond ed positively to off -
label administration of Aimovig ®. Anecdotally, five of Dr. Avila’s  TMD patients were treated with  
Aimovig ® along with his standard therapy . Of these, three  patients experienced substantial life -
changing relief of TMD pain symptoms. Another patient initially experienced substantial  pain relief , 
which declined slightly over two months. The last patient stopped  taking Aimovig®  due to elevated 
blood pressure, which is not an adverse event  associated with Aimovig®  in the published clinical 
trials ( Goadsby et al., 2017; Tepper et al., 2017) ; however, the development of hypertension and 
worsening of pre -existing hypertension have been reported  following the use of AIMOVIG in the 
postmarketing setting ( FDA-approved Patient Labeling
).    
CM is thought to originate within the trigeminovascular pathway (TGV) (Noseda & Burstein, 2013). TMD is also considered to originate within the TGV (de Leeuw, 2018). Thus , our working 
hypothesis is that a CGRP  receptor antagonist for treatment of CM  will also be effective in 
reducing TMD pain and related symptoms. To test this hypothesis, we appl ied several validated 
measures: Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) (Kean et al., 2016) ; PEG (Pain, Enjoyment, General Activity) 
Scale (Krebs et al., 2009) ; an assessment of daily pain medication;  Patient Global Impression of 
Change (PGIC)  (Kroenke et al., 2018) ; Jaw Function Limitation Scale (JFLS) (Ohrbach et al., 
2008) ; Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -4) (Kroenke et al., 2009) ; and Somatic Symptom Scale 
(SSS- 8) (Toussaint et al., 2017).  
 The purpose  of this proof of concept  study was to evaluate the safety  and effica cy of the off -label 
use of Aimovig® (EREN) in reducing Temporomandibular Disorder ( TMD ) pain compared to 
placebo.

 2. Study Objectives and Outcome Measures  
2.1 Primary  Objective and Outcome Measure  
To assess the effects of Aimovig® (EREN)  compared to placebo (EREN- P) based on the change 
in mean  between -group difference in pain using the Brief Pain Inventory  (BPI) 4-item pain 
severity/intensity scale during the 20 -week trial . The BPI  is a validated and widely used outcome 
measures in chronic pain trials  (Kean et al., 2016; Kroenke et al., 2019) . We postulated that 
Aimovig® will be superior to placebo in reducing pain intensity/severity over 20 weeks . 
 
2.2 Secondary Objective and Outcome Measures 
To assess the effects of Aimovig® (EREN) compared to placebo (EREN -P) based on the change 
in mean between- group difference in secondary outcomes during the 20- week trial  and after 24 
weeks (two months after the last treatment).  The outcome measures are based on consensus 
recommendations for research assessments in chronic pain and TMD research (Ohrbach et al., 
2016; Kroenke et al., 2019) . We postulated that Aimovig® will be superior to placebo in improving 
several secondary outcomes including: 
a) Pain interference as measured by the BPI interference scale  
b) Trajectory of pain improvement based on changes in daily reporting of pain using the PEG (Pain, Enjoyment, General Activity) Scale as measured using an app downloaded on the 
subject’s smartphone  or for individuals without smartphones  at baseline and every 4 
weeks over the  24-week  study period  
c) Days of use of TMD pain- specific medication per month  
d) Global improvement in pain as measured by the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)  
e) Jaw function as measured by the Jaw Function Limitation Scale (JFLS -8) 
f) Depressive and anxiety symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -4) 
g) Somatic symptom severity as measured by the  Somatic Symptoms Scale ( SSS-8) 
h) Safety and tolerance as measured by incidence of AEs and SAEs  
 
3. Study Design  
This was a 24- week , randomized, double- blinded, placebo- controlled, parallel group proof- of-
concept study with two arms (active and placebo).  The plan was  to enroll 30  subjects. There was  
a four -week screening period to identify subjects that meet the diagnostic criteria (DC/TMD) for 
“myalgia”, recommended by the International RDC/TMD Consortium Network and Orofacial Pain 
Special Interest Group  (Schiffman  et al., 2014) . The Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular 
Disorders Symptom Questionnaire and DC/TMD Examination Form (Ohrbach, 2016) was  used 
during Screening and Baseline visits to confirm the TMD diagnosis and determine whether subjects met the inclusion/exclusion criteria.   
Subjects attended a Screening visit followed by Baseline visit to  randomize eligible subjects to 
active (EREN) or placebo (EREN- P). During the Baseline visit and Wks 4, 8, 12, and  16, subjects  
received treatment with either 140 mg of EREN or P lacebo administered by subcutaneous 
injection. At Baseline and Wks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 subjects were instructed to complete the 
Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) (Kean et al., 2016); PEG (Pain, Enjoyment, General Activity) Scale 
(Krebs et al., 2009); pain mediation assessment; Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)  
Version Date: Amend 8- January 12, 2023   Page 6 of 27 
 (Kroenke et al., 2018)  (except for Baseline visit) ; Jaw Function Limitation Scale (JFLS) (Ohrbach 
et al., 2008); Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -4) (Kroenke et al., 2009); and Somatic Symptom 
Scale (SSS- 8) (Toussaint et al., 2017) . These visits also included review of continuance criteria  
and adverse event collection.  
At the Screening and Baseline visit s the s ubjects were instructed on how to use the PEG Scale  
and pain use assessment  app, which was  downloaded on their smartphone, to provide a daily  
assessment of their pain intensity and i nterference with enjoyment  and general activity  (PEG ) and 
their daily used of pain medications . Subjects who did not own a smartphone or were  unwilling to 
use the app on a daily basis only completed the PEG and pain medication assessment at the 
Baseline visit and all subsequent visits using the app onsite.   
4. Study Population  
The study population consist ed of male and female subjects  diagnosed  as having  pain- related 
TMD  using the  diagnostic criteria ( DC/TMD) for “myalgia ”, recommended by the International

 4.3 Enrollment  Procedures  
Subjects were  recruited using fliers and advertisements  placed in the Indiana University (IU) 
School of Dentistry  (IUSD)  and other locations on the I ndiana University Purdue University 
Indianapolis (IUPUI)  campus  including IU Health facilities . Fliers may also be posted on 
Facebook.  
 Dr. Avila may send approved study information to persons who may have TMD and he may  also 
mention the study during planned radio interviews about TMD.   Dr. Avila’s website will not mention 
research.  
Persons responding to an advertisement will be given a brief description of the study and asked 
a series of questions related to the inclusion/exclusion criteria using an IRB approved phone 
script.  Those who are interested and appear to meet the study requirements will be scheduled for 
a screening visit at the Oral Health Research Institute  (OHRI) . 
 
Additionally, contact information was  obtained from Regenstrief for IU Health patients who have 
indicated they have TMJ problems and are willing to be contacted for future studies. Once 
contact information was  obtained, the OH study coordinator contact ed the potential subjects by 
telephone to see if they were  interested in attending a screening visit.

randomization based on a schedule provided by the study statistician,  George Eckert , Indiana 
University School of Medicine Department of Biostatistics .  
 
The randomization code was provided to Amgen as part of the ISS contract agreement.  
 
5.4 Treatment blinding 
Subjects , investigator s and study  staff will remain blind to the  identity of the treatment from the 
time of ra ndomization until database lock . The randomization code will be kept strictly confidential 
and the identity of the study drug treatments will be concealed using identical packaging and labeling. The blind will only be broken in an emergency where it is essential to know which 
treatment a subject received in order to give the appropriate medical care.  
 5.5 Dispensing of study drug  
The investigational products (EREN and EREN -P) supplied in prefilled syringes will be shipped 
by Amgen to the attention of the unblinded IU Health  Investigational Drug Services  Pharmacy . 
The IU Health Pharmacy  will dispense the investigational  products according to a randomization 
schedule provided by the study statistician, George Eckert . A written prescription order form will 
be completed by the licensed study dentist  and submitted to the pharmacy each time study drug 
is requested for a subject.  Doses will be administered in the upper arm, thigh, or abdomen  by a 
study dentist  qualified in s.c. drug administration.   
Study product will be stored and handled according to labeling instructions: s tore refrigerated at 
2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) in the original carton to protect from light until time of use; d o not freeze ; 
and do not shake; l eave the prefilled syringe at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before 
injecting. The investigational products will be stored in a secured area of the IU Health 
Investigation Drug Services Pharmacy to which only the pharmacy staff have access.  
The IU Health pharmacy will maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or 
other disposition of the products on the electronic Investigational Agent Accountability Record . 
The log will identify the products and account for the disposition including specific dates and 
Version Date: Amend 8- January 12, 2023   Page 9 of 27 
 quantities used/dispensed and returned, as applicable.  The log will capture the electronic 
signatures of the site designees who dispensed and verified  the products.  
The clinical site, OHRI,  working with the pharmacy  will also maintain a Drug Administration Form  
documenting the date and time of transport to the blinded site staff, the date and signature of the 
blinded site staff receiving the study drug, the date and time the study drug was received from the 
pharmacy, the date and time the study drug was administered, and the injection site body location.

 be signed and dated by the person reviewing the consent process with them.  Subjects will receive 
a signed copy of their consent before leaving this visit.  A Study Dentist qualified to diagnosis TMD 
will review the potential subject’s health history , medications  and TMD history for  the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria. 
The Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders Symptom Questionnaire (Appendix C) 
and DC/TMD Examination Form (Ohrbach, 2016)  will be used to confirm the TMD diagnosis and 
determine whether subjects meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  To meet the diagnostic criteria 
for TMD Myalgia (IDC -9 729; ICD -10 M79.1)  (Schiffman  et al., 2014) , subjects must have a history 
of pain of muscle origin that is affected by jaw movement, function, or parafunction, and 
demonstrate replication of this pain with provocation testing of the masticatory muscles. The 
specific criteria  (Schiffman et al., 2014)  include having a positive history for both pain in the jaw, 
temple, in the ear, or in front of ear and pain modified with jaw movement, function or parafunction. 
During clinical examination, subjects must have a confirmation of pain in the temporalis or 
masseter muscle(s) and report familiar pain in the temporalis or masseter muscle(s) w ith at least 
one of the following provocation tests: palpation of the temporalis or masseter muscle(s) or maximum unassisted or assisted opening movement(s).  
Subject s with smar tphones will be asked to download the MyCap  app and will then be trained on 
completing the PEG Scale and the pain medication assessment questions using their 
smartphone. The subject will be scheduled to return to the study site for their Baseline visit .  
 
Baseline, Wk 4, 8, 12, and 16 Visits:  The subject’s medical history , medications  and continuance 
criteria will be reviewed to assure the subject still qualifies to participate in the study.  The 
Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders Symptom Questionnaire (Appendix C) and 
DC/TMD Examination Form will be used to confirm the TMD diagnosis and determine whether 
subjects meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  In addition, the subjects will be assessed using the 
Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)  (Appendix D), PEG (Pain, Enjoyment, General Activity) Scale  and pain 
medication assessment (Appendix E ), Jaw Function Limitation Scale (JFLS)  (Appendix G) , 
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ- 4) (Appendix H), and Somatic Symptom Scale (SSS -8) 
(Appendix I) . Starting at week 4 the subjects will also be assessed using global improvement in 
pain as measured by the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)  (Appendix F) . 
The subject will receive their assigned treatment  (EREN or EREN -P) based on the randomization 
scheme at baseline and Wk 4, 8, 12, and 16 .  
The procedure for texting each day will be reviewed with the subject and a practice text will be 
sent to assure communication is accurate.  Subjects without smartphones will only be required 
complete the PEG Scale and pain medication assessment questions using the app onsite at 
Baseline and at all subsequent study visits. 
Adverse events will be assessed and documented, and the subjects will be schedule for their next 
visit. 
 
Wk 20 End of Treatment Period Visit : Subjects will be assessed using the BPI , PEG  and pain 
medication assessment  (app) , PGIC, JFLS, PHQ -4, and SSS -8. Adverse events will be assessed 
and documented, and the subjects will be schedule for their next visit.    
 
Wk 24 Post -Treatment  Follow -up Visit : Subject s will return  for follow- up examination and 
assessed using the BPI, PEG  and pain medication assessment  (app), PGIC , JFLS, PHQ -4, and 
SSS- 8. Adverse events will be assessed and documented .

7.1 Adverse Events  
Subjects will be questioned regarding any general health or oral complaints and symptoms they have experienced during each visit. Any findings will be documented on the AE CRF. In the event 
of subjects reporting AEs outside the scheduled clinical visit, the Investigator will assess them at the earliest opportunity.  
All AEs, regardless of severity or relationship to the treatments, will be recorded. Serious AEs 
include any events resulting in death, decreased life expectancy, life- threatening situations, 
persistent or permanent disability/incapacity, hospitalization, or congenital anomaly/birth defect. In addition, other important medical events that  are deemed clinically important/serious based on 
PI judgement  will be recorded as AE s. Within 24 hours, the Investigator will submit a written report 
to Amgen documenting the circumstances of the serious AE.  
 
7.2 Serious Adverse Events  
Safety monitoring for this study will focus on adverse events related to treatment use and unanticipated problems involving risks to participants, including unanticipated problems that meet 
the definition of a serious adverse event. At each visit, subjects  will be queried about any adverse 
events that may have occurred since their last visit, regardless of direct relationship to treatment 
use. Adverse events will be recorded on an Adverse Event form.  Abnormalities, or worsening of 
pre-existing conditions, observed by the examiner or reported by the subject that occur at any 
visit will be recorded on the AE CRF. All AEs will be transcribed onto a log, which will be monitored 
by the PI to determine if the nature, frequency, or severity of an event meets the criteria for prompt reporting. All adverse events will be reported to the IRB during annual review.  
The PI will be notified immediately if a serious adverse event occurs.  All serious adverse events 
that meet the prompt reporting requirements will be reported to the IRB  within 5 business days . 
Serious adverse events include: any event resulting in death, is life -threatening, requires 
hospitalization, results in disability/permanent damage, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage, and/or other medical events . 
The study site will be responsible for reporting SAEs to Amgen in accordance with the Amgen 
ISS Program contract  requirements .  
The study site will be responsible for reporting all safety information to Amgen in accordance with their reporting requirements ( Table 1
).

 7.3 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
Subjects may withdrawal or discontinue from the clinical trial at any time without penalty or loss. 
Subjects will be advised at the start of the trial that they may withdraw from the trial at any time, 
without giving a reason. Subjects may be withdrawn by the Principal Investigator for the 
following reasons:  
 
• the volunteer wishes to withdraw;  
• if, in the opinion of the Investigator, it is in the best interests of the subject;  
• if serious adverse reactions occur;  
• inter-current illness occurs;  
• there is a significant violation of the prohibitions and restrictions;  
• development of an exclusion criterion.  
 
Withdrawals due to non- attendance must be followed up to attempt to obtain the reason that the  
subject is ‘lost to follow up’. Subjects who are lost to follow up will be encouraged to return to the site for an exit visit . Subjects withdrawn for medical reasons will be referred to a physician 
/dentist. Their condition will be monitored until it is resolved or clinically non- significant. All 
withdrawals and the reason for withdrawal will be documented. Withdrawn subjects will not be 
replaced.  
 
8. Data Analysis  
Mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis will be used to evaluate changes over time in 
the BPI pain severity/intensity scale and BPI total score, PEG Scale total score and daily pain,  
days of use of pain medication and TMD pain- specific medication per month , JFLS -8, PHQ -4 
anxiety and depression, SSS -8 Scale, and PGIC pain change within and between treatment 
groups. The MMRM will include factors for treatment group, time, and their interaction. Time w ill 
be repeated within subject.  The MMRM will also include gender as a covariate due to stratification 
by gender in the randomization.  The distribution of the outcomes will be examined and a 
transformation of the data will be used if necessary. A two -sided 5% significance level will be used 
for all tests  without multiplicity adjustment between multiple endpoints . 
 
8.1 Sample size calculations 
A sample size of 12 subjects per group has been suggested for pilot studies to evaluate feasibility 
and to estimate group means and standard deviations for future study planning (Julious, 2005). 
Based on two- sided paired t -tests and two- sample t -tests, all  conducted at a 5% significance level, 
this pilot study will have 80% power to detect effect sizes of 0.9 for changes over time within 
groups and effect sizes of 1.2 for differences between groups. To account for dropout, the study 
will enroll 15 subjects per group, 30 total subjects.

2 Study A rms 
a) Intervention Group-  Text 7 morning and 7 evening BP 
values at baseline. Monitored by a study pharmacist for 12 
months. Research visits at 6 and 12 months  
b) Control Group - Text 7 morning and 7 evening BP values 
at baseline. Research visits at 6 and 12 months  
 
 
Total Number of Subjects   
420 
 
 
Duration of Study Participation  
12 months  
 
 
Primary Outcome s  
Mean difference in systolic blood pressure between the 
control and intervention groups at 12 months.  
 
 
Secondary Outcomes   
Mean difference in diastolic blood pressure between the control and intervention groups at 12 months.  
 
Total number of medication changes (i.e., dose, 
discontinuation, initiation, etc.) from baseline to 12 months.  
 
5 
 Total cost of medications, time spent by research staff, and 
clinic visits per patient from baseline to 12 months.  
 
 
Statistical Design and Power   
The analysis will be done on an intent -to-treat basis 
regardless of the number of reported BP readings or the 
number of pharmacist interactions with the participant.   
 
Our primary outcome w ill be a comparison of mean SBP  
values at 12 months. W e will use a linear mixed effects 
model with mean BP at 12 months as the outcome. We will 
use random effects for clinic and physician nested within 
clinic to account for practice heterogeneity between clinics 
and providers.  
 
Based on prior work with the CAPTION trial, we expect a 
mean decrease in SBP of 17.3 (SD = 17.7) mmHg in the 
intervention arm and a decrease of 11.6 (SD = 18.2) mmHg 
in the control arm. We expect a difference of 5.65 mmHg 
between the groups with an expected pooled standard 
deviation of 17.9 with equal sized groups. In order to have 
85% power to detect a difference of 5.7 mmHg or larger 
decrease in SBP with a Type I error rate of 5% and a 
standard deviation of 17.9 mmHg, we would need 180 
subjects per arm or  360 subjects total.   
 
In preliminary work in the CAPTION trial, 13.4% of control 
subjects dropped out or were lost to follow -up. 14.0% of 
subjects dropped out of the intervention arm during the first 9 
months. In order to retain power after reasonable attrition 
rates over 12 months, we will recruit an additional 14% in 
each group to ensure we have at least 85% power. In 
addition, the sample size should slightly increase to 
accommodate the interim analyses.  This increases our total 
sample size to 420.  
 One interim analysis is planned after outcome data is 
received and the results are reported to the Data Safety and 
Monitoring Board from the first half of the study. The interim 
monitoring method of Lan and DeMets will be used with 
O’Brien -Fleming alpha spending function for the interim 
analyses. Accordingly, type I error rate of 0.00305 for the 
interim analysis and 0.4695 will be used for the final 
analyses. The current sample size of 420 patients total 
accommodates the interim analyses.

 1. Introduction  
1.1 Background  
 
 Hypertension causes an estimated 395,000 deaths in the US each year: one out of 
every six deaths. Hypertension is second only to smoking as a modifiable cause of death in the 
US. Poor blood pressure (BP) control increases the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and 
death and is often due to delays in treatment intensification. In our prior work, we demonstrated 
that a physician -pharmacist collaborative intervention with pharmacists embedded within the 
medical offices reduced BP and it was cost effective. However, pharmacists spent a 
considerable proportion of their time obtaining and aggregating patients’ home BP 
measurements. Thus, w e have developed a telehealth service called Centralized Healthcare 
Solutions that has successfully delivered clinical pharmacy services remotely to private 
physician offices, especially in small medical offices and rural locations.  We have also 
developed an additional mhealth solution called What's your BP? (WyBP), a custom -built bi -
directional SMS based (short message service, or texting) platform. WyBP is inexpensive (i.e., 
does not require investment i n smartphone technology, or WiFi), acceptable to a broad range of 
patients (including the elderly and rural populations), scalable to subject volume observed in 
busy clinical settings, and easily integrated into typical  clinic workflows. In two pilot studies , we 
demonstrated a high rate of adherence, indicating that patients were willing and able to take 
home BP measurements and send them to our research team.  
 
 This proposal combines our two prior efforts to use remotely located pharmacists and bi -
directional texting to improve efficiencies, reduce cost and improve access to a dedicated 
pharmacist. A major gap in our knowledge is whether the potency of a “virtual ” team member 
can be improved by home BP monitoring with technological support, especially in small medical offices  that are unable to employ clinical pharmacists . The goal of this proposal is to evaluate 
whether our scalable SMS approach combined with a pharmacist -based intervention improves 
BP management cost effectively. To achieve this objective, we will determine if our intervention leads to decreases in BP; determine if our intervention leads to intensification of therapy; and 
determine the cost effe ctiveness of the intervention. At the end of this project, we expect to 
provide a novel, scalable and cost -effective approach for treating hypertension in rural 
populations by expanding the feasibility, scalability and dissemination of the Centralized 
Healthcare Solutions intervention. The intervention has important public health relevance: if this 
intervention could be implemented broadly in primary care practices and lead to a decrease of 5 
mmHg BP, heart -disease deaths could be reduced by 15 -20% and stroke deaths by 20- 30%.  
 
1.2 Clinical Experie nce with the Study Intervention 
 
 Dr. Polgreen  has conducted clinical trials to capture blood pressure (BP) measurement , 
and she has been involved in observational research in the field of hypertension. She performed 
the cost effectiveness analysis for Dr. Carter’s CAPTION trial. She is also performing the cost 
analyses for his current NHLBI -funded studies: ICARE and MedFOC US. In addition, she 
published a paper on trends in inpatient  admissions for HTN. Her previous  K-award “Treatment 
Effectiveness Using Observational Data: Which Method is Best?” wa s based on HTN treatment 
using angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, and she is 
using multiple statistical and data analytic techniques to determine treatment effectiveness.  
 
 Dr. Carter is a certified hyper tension clinician (2016- 2026) . He practiced as a clinical 
pharmacist faculty member in Family Medicine residency training programs at the University of Iowa (1980 - 1988) and Baylor College of Medicine (1988 -1991) where he provided physician 
10 
 education and direct patient management. He also practiced in the pharmacist -managed 
hypertension clinic at the West Side VA in Chicago (1991 -1995). He was a member of the 
NHLBI Coordinating Committee of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program ( 1991 -
2010), and he was a member of the last four national guideline committees (JNC -5, 6, 7 & 8 
[renamed the 2014 guidelines]). He also was asked to take the lead on a writing group on 
thiazides and dysglycemia by NHLBI. He was a member of the NHLBI workshop to develop 
research strategies to improve BP control in African Americans and another recent workshop to 
identify research strategies in Federally Qualified Health Centers.

4. Study Design  
 
4.1 Overview  
 
 The PharmText  BP study was funded in September 2019 by the National Heart, Lung, 
and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The study is being led by 
University of Iowa co -principal investigators Dr. Linnea A. Polgreen, Associate Professor of  
Pharmacy Practice and Science and Dr. Barry L. Carter, Professor Emeritus of Pharmacy 
Practice and Science and in the Department of Family Medicine.  
 
 The goal of PharmText BP is to c onduct a study to evaluate whether our scalable SMS 
approach combined with a pharmacist -based intervention will improve  BP management and that 
it will be cost effective . The entire study will last 5 year s and involve recruitment of 420 
participants from 3- 4 clinics within 35 miles of University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.  
Participating clinics are listed in Appendix 1. All participants will live in areas that are 
considered rural by Rural -Urban Commuting Area Codes. The study aims to enroll at least 125 
participants (30%) who represent minority populations.  
 
 All participants will have an initial screening/enrollment/baseline visit, a 2nd visit at 6 
months, and a final visit at 12 months with a research intern. Each in- person visit will include 
research blood pressure measurements  (Omron HEM 907- XL), interviews, and medical record 
review. In addition to the in-person visits, all participants will be provided with a home BP cuff 
(Omron 5 Series), enrolled in our bi -directional text -messaging platform, WyBP , and  asked to 
submit 7 morning and 7 evening BP measurem ents via text message following the baseline 
visit. Text message prompts asking for these BP measurements will stop after the 14 
measurements have been submitted, or after 15 days, whichever occurs first.  Following the 
home BP measurem ents, participants will be randomized to either the pharmacist intervention 
arm or the texting- only control arm  using a randomized block design with random block sizes 
with stratification according to clinic .  
 
12 
  A timeline for the study procedures is provided in Appendix 2. 
 
 Key personnel roles for the study are described below:  
 
Key Personnel  
 
Research Interns   
3-5 full time staff members employed by Internal Medicine at 
UIHC who will recruit participants and collect data.  
   
 
Research Pharmacists   
2-3 clinical pharmacists will provide the intervention and at least 2 
are certified hypertension clinicians as designated by the 
American Society of Hypertension. Pharmacists will provide 
telephone, text message, and email support for intervention 
participants and communicate with participant’s doctors via the 
electronic medical record.  
  
 
 
4.2 Recruitment/Screening Procedures  
 
 Research interns will review the electronic medical record for patients who are 
scheduled to visit each of the participating clinics. They will screen the record for the past 18 
months to ensure that the eligibility criteria are met and that no exclusiona ry criteria exist  (the 
REDCap screening instrument is provided in Appendix 3). If they are unsure about any of the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria for a specific patient, they will defer to the medical staff in the clinic.  
  Inclusion Criteria:  
 English or Spanish speaking males and females.  
 21 – 100 years of age.  
 Clinic measured blood pressure of ≥ 145 mmHg or ≥ 95 mmHg at two 
previous clinic visits or one previous clinic visit and on the day of 
enrollment.  Previous clinic visit BPs must be within the past 18 months and measured at least 2 weeks apart from each ot her. 
 Lives in a zip code that is scored as a 4 -10 on the Rural -Urban 
Commuting Area (RUCA) Codes . 
 Exclusion Criteria:  
 Currently pregnant or planning to become pregnant in the next year . 
 Upper arm circumference greater than 50 cm (20 in)  
 Prisoner status . 
 Unable to provide own informed consent . 
 
 Once a potential participant  has been identified, the research intern will notify the 
appropriate medical staff that the patient is eligible for the study.  If the medical staff confirms 
that the BP study is appropriate for the patient, they will inform the patient about the study 
13 
 during the appointment and ask for permission for the research intern to explain the study 
further. If the patient is interested in learning more, the research intern will either meet with the patient in the exam room, or move the patient to a research- dedicated room, whichever has a 
lesser impact on clinic flow for that day. The screening questions will be reviewed again with the patient to ensure accuracy (particularly whether or not a female patient is planning to become pregnant in the next year, as tha t will not be reflected in the medical record).  
 
 If a patient indicates that they are not interested in participating in the study at any time, 
they will be thanked for their time and allowed to leave the clinic.  
 
 If all eligibility criteria are confirmed and they wish  to participate, the research intern will 
describe the study, give the patient  time to read the consent form, and answer any questions 
that the patient may have.  Specifically, the research intern will explain the following areas of the consent document:  
o Purpose of the research study, duration of study participation, and the number of research visits and study contacts (i.e., texting, phone calls, emails) required.  
o The study procedures and requirements.  
o The risks of the study.  
o The voluntary nature of the study. The participant may drop out of the study at any time.  
o That their decision to participate or not will have no effect on their relationship 
with or care from their physician or on the clinical care that they receive.  
o HIPAA information: The research team must have access to the participant’s 
medical information and to create medical information in order for the participant to be in the study; the investigators will obtain medical record data for the time 
period that spans 18 months preceding enrollment until 12 months following 
enrollment.  
o The research- related injury section.  
o Contact information that participants can use to reach investigators for study -
related issues.  
 
 If the patient agrees to participate, they will be asked to sign two copies of the consent 
form. The research intern will sign the consent forms as the witness. One copy will be given to the participant and one copy will be kept and filed securely in the research team office.  The 
patient will be enrolled in the research study in the electronic medical record via IRB and 
hospital policy.  
  
 Patients may take an unsigned consent form with them to think about participation. They 
will be given contact i nformation to schedule a follow -up appointment with an intern at a later 
date if they choose to participate.  
 
 Patients may also sign the consent form but schedule completion of other baseline 
activities for a later date to meet their scheduling needs.  
 
14 
  The English and Spanish consent forms are provided in Appendix 4.  
 
4.3 Baseline Visit Procedures  
 
 4.3.1 Baseline Data Collection 
 
 After the consent form has been signed, the research intern will continue with the other 
baseline activities. Together, the intern and participant will compl ete the demographic 
information that is collected on the Baseline Data  REDCap form ( Appendix 5). 
 
 4.3.2 Blood Pressure Measurement  
 
 Trained r esearch interns will measure the participant’s blood pressure and document it  
on the Baseline Data REDCap form ( Appendix 5). All measurements will be taken using the 
Omron HEM -907-XL using the following procedures:  
Prepare the Participant:  
• Participants should refrain from smoking for 20 minutes prior to the blood pressure 
measurement.  
• The participant should remove all clothing that covers the location of the cuff placement.  
• The participant should be comfortably seated in a chair, with the back supported, legs uncrossed and flat on the floor, the arm supported at heart level on a desk, with the palm 
facing upward.  
• The participant should sit for at least 5 minutes before the first measurement and should 
relax as much as possible.  
Cuff Measurement:  
• The participant’s arm circumference should be measured during screening to ensure the 
appropriate size cuff is used and to exclude morbidly obese participants where the cuff 
size is too small for their arm . The appropriate cuff should be chosen based on the 
measurement ranges specified for each cuff. If an arm measurement falls on a number 
that is specified for two cuffs, both cuffs should be placed on the arm sequentially and 
the cuff for which the INDEX arrow t hat is marked on the cuff  falls within the range bar 
should be chosen.     
• If upper arm circumference is >50 cm (20 in) the participant will be thanked and 
excluded from the study.  
Cuff Placement:  
• Do not allow a sleeve to form a tourniquet on the arm.  
• Palpate the brachial artery in the antecubital fossa and place the ART ↓that is marked 
on the midline of the bladder of the cuff so that it is over the arterial pulsation of the 
participant’s bare upper arm.  
15 
 • The lower end of the cuff should be ½ to 1 inch above the inner side of the elbow joint.  
• The middle of the cuff should be at the level of the right atrium (the mid- point of the 
sternum).  
• Place the cuff snugly around the bare upper arm so that you can only insert one finger 
between the cuff and the arm.  
Blood Pressure Measurement:  
• Use the Omron HEB -907-XL and record values in the Baseline Data REDCap form 
(Appendix 5).  
• Tell the participant that you will be taking 3 -4 blood pressure measurements and that 
neither of you should talk during the measurements.  
o Take a single sitting BP reading with the MODE set to “SINGLE” and record. 
Wait at least 60 seconds before taking the next blood pressure.  
o Repeat this two more times . 
o The average of the 2nd and 3rd readings will be used as the research BP for this 
visit.  
o If the 2nd and 3rd BP values are more than 4 mmHg apart, a 4th value will be 
obtained and the two nearest values will be averaged. This will serve as the 
research BP for that visit.  
 
IF YOU GET AN ERROR MESSAGE AT ANY POINT, START THE SEQUENCE OVER.   
 
4.3.3 Blood Pressure Medications  
 
 Research interns  will record all BP medications (and dosage) that the participants are 
currently taking at the baseline appointment in the REDCap BP Medication Form ( Appendix 6). 
This REDCap  form is linked to the Master Drug Data Base Clinical Drugs BioPortal Ontology 
Service so that when a research intern begins typing a medication name, an appropriate 
spelling of the drug and all of the available dosages will automatically populate. This wi ll 
substantially reduce data entry mistakes . If a participant is taking more than one BP medication, 
the REDcap form will allow them to create multiple entries. The research interns  will use  the 
updated Drug Codes for Antihypertensive Agents form used in t he CAPTION trial to help them 
determine which of the patient’s medications are appropriate to record ( Appendix 7). 
 
4.3.4  Enrollment in WyBP  
 
 Before leaving the baseline appointment, the participants will  need to be enrolled in 
WyBP so that they can send home -BP measurements via text message.  
o Go to https://vinci.cs.uiowa.edu/meditext2/home/  
o Log in with your username and password . 
o Select the PharmText BP study from the dropdown menu.  
o Click the green Enroll Patient button in the top right corner.  
o Enter the participant’s phone number starting with the area code, click Next.  
16 
 o Enter the participant’s Record ID from REDCap in the Subject identifier field.  
o Leave the email field blank.  
o Choose the participant’s preferred language (English or Spanish), click Submit.  
o You will be taken to an Edit Patient screen that shows the phone number you just 
registered along with a note at the top saying that the patient was successfully created in the study. Click the green Update button to be taken to the next step.  
o Back at the Home Screen, you will see that the Study Summary now shows an 
additional enrollment and progress made toward the overall enrollment goal. 
Click the Patients button to assign text mess age subscriptions to the participant  
you just enrolled.  
o Click on the Patient for whom  you need to assign a text message subscription.  
o Click the green Add Subscription button in the top right corner.  
o Choose the PharmText Baseline Protocol. Set the Start Date to be tomorrow’s date. Set the End Date to be 15 days from tomorrow. Set the frequency to 1. 
Choose the appropriate morning and evening Send Times for the participant to 
receive the text messages ( NOTE: the morning Send Time should be a time after 
the patient will wake up, but before they take any morning medications.  The 
evening Send Time should be a time that is convenient for the participant 
between dinner and going to bed.). Make sure both the Send End Message and 
Send End Email to Managers are checked. Click the green Submit button.  
 A second set of subscriptions will need to be created for all intervention part icipants so 
that they can send their 3 days of BPs each month.  These subscriptions will be created by our 
software developer (unblinded). He will check REDCap once per week to see which new 
participants have been randomized to the intervention group. Then, he will create s ubscriptions 
for them to send 3 days of BPs each month beginning on the date that the participant was 
enrolled (i.e., if a participant was enrolled on August 15, they will submit their first day of BPs on 
the 15
th, 16th, and 17th of each month throughout follow up). This strategy will allow the 
pharmacists to see a variety of BPs from different days of the week. The software developer will create the subscriptions using these steps:  
o Create subscriptions 2- 12 for the participant for the 3 days of text messages 
each month throughout the 12 months of follow up.  
o Click the Patients button to assign a subscription to the appropriate participant .  
o Click on the Patient for whom  you need to assign a text message subscription.  
o Click the green Add Subscription button in the top right corner.  
o Choose the PharmText  Ongoing Protocol. Set the Start Date to be today’s date 
next month (i.e., if the participant enrolled on April 15
th, you would set this Start 
Date to be May 15th). Set the End Date to be 2 days later. Set the frequency to 1. 
Choose the same morning and evening Send Times as the previous 
subscription. Do not check the Send End Message and Send End Email to 
Managers options until you are creating the final subscription.  
 
17 
 4.3.5 Compensation  
 
 Once a participant has completed the baseline appointment, a research intern will 
submit a form for a $50 compensation check to be mailed to the participant’s home using the 
university’s online eVoucher system. They will log this submission using the REDCap 
Compensation Form ( Appendix 8).  
  
4.4 Randomization and Treatment Arms  
 
 Dr. Emine Bayman created the stratified randomization list s for each clinic site. These 
lists are being uploaded to a website created by our software developer (unblinded). As 
participants have completed  their home BP measurements, the research pharmacists will log 
into this website using a unique username and password. They will input the Record ID for the 
participant they need to randomize as well as  the clinic location from  which the participant 
enrolled. The website will inform the pharmacist of group assignment and they will record that in 
the Group Assignment REDCap form ( Appendix 9). The website will store a log with a date and 
time stamp of which pharmacist randomized each participant to ensure that pharmacists do not 
intentionally or unintentionally alter the randomization in any way. This strategy should ensure 
that a relatively equal number of intervention and control participants are enrolled at each clinic.  
 
4.4.1 Control Group:  
 
 Once the research pharmacist is  informed of the participant’s group assignment, they 
will contact the participants. The pharmacist will discuss their home BP measurements and only 
provide general education on hypertension. If the BP values remain elevated on home 
monitoring, the pharmacist will advise the participant to make an appointment with their 
physician to address BP elevations.  This will be the only pharmacist contact for the control group.  
 
4.4.2 Intervention Group:    
  The pharmacists will have access to the participants’ electronic medical records, all 
information collected by the research interns, and the home BP values that are submitted via 
text message. Pharmacists will employ a patient -centered approach to improve participant’s BP 
by providing support, education, and recommendations for treatment intensification, as 
necessary. They will communicate with participants via phone, text message, or email, based 
on participant preferences. They will not follow a specific protocol, but will base treatment 
decisions on current BP guidelines. They may schedule more home BP measurements than the 
3 days per month. Recommendations to physicians will primarily be made through the electronic 
medical record to quickly improve BP control. They will also recommend laboratory testing if 
indicated ( e.g., serum potassium or creatinine).    
 
The pharmacists will review the home BP values with the intervention subjects.  If the 
home BP values are controlled, the pharmacist will continue to monitor home BP values.  
18 
 However, if the pharmacist identifies issues such as poor medication adherence, inability to 
afford medications or other issues, they will work with the patient and physician to optimize therapy and/or reduce cost.  If the pharmacist suspects white coat hypertension, they will make a 
recommendation to the physician to refer the patient to the University of Iowa ambulatory blood pressure service.  
  If BP values are elevated, the pharmacist will assess medication adherence, ability to 
pay for medications and whether the regimen is optimal to control BP based on patient demographics and co -existing conditions.  The pharmacist will communicate recommendations 
for lifestyle and other changes directly to the subject.  If medication changes are needed, the pharmacist will communicate to the physician through the electronic medical record.  The pharmacist may recommend:  
1. Increased dose of a medication.  
2. Addition of a medication.  
3. Discontinuation of a medication.  
4. Modification of the regi men to optimize therapy, improve convenience (e.g. fixed-
dose combinations) or reduce cost.  
 
 All participants in the pharmacist intervention group will continue to have access to a 
research pharmacist for the entire 12 months of follow up. Additionally, they will be asked to 
continue measuring and texting BP values (1 morning, 1 evening) for 3 day s each month 
throughout the 12 -month follow up.  
  The pharmacists will typically  contact  with the participants every 2 weeks while BP is not 
controlled. Once BP is controlled, they will continue monitoring the participant’s records and 
home BPs and make contact at least every 2 months to support adherence and reassess BP 
control.  
 
 The REDCap forms that the pharmacists will use to record data are shown in 
Appendix 
10 
 
4.5 6-Month Visit Procedures  
 
 All participants  will be asked to return to the clini c where they enrolled at for a 6- Month 
appointment with a research intern. To allow for flexibility with scheduling, 6- Month 
appointments will be allowed to occur anytime between 5 Months and 7 Months after the 
enrollment date. This BP value will be the outcome BP value. If a participant is not able to make 
it to the clinic during this window, but does want to come in after the 7 Month date, this will be 
allowed and all data will be collected, however, it will not be counted in the 6- month outcome 
and the 6- month outcome will be considered missing. In this case, a note will be placed in t he 
participant’s record and these data may not be used in analyses.  
  At the 6 -Month appointment, the research intern will collect the  research BP values, any 
BP medications that the participants are currently taking, the last 3 BP values that were 
19 
 recorded by the participant’s home BP cuff, and test the home BP cuff for accuracy. If the home 
BP cuff appears to be measuring inaccurately, it will be replaced. The participant will be sent  
another $50 compensation check. All of the procedures outlined at baseline will be followed 
again, but the data will be collected on separate 6 Month REDCap forms (not shown) . 
 
4.6 12-Month Visit Procedures  
 
 All participants  will be asked to return to the clinic for a 12 -Month appointment with a 
research intern. To allow for flexibility with scheduling, 12 Month appointments will be allowed to 
occur anytime between 11 Months and 13 Months after the enrollment date. If a participant is 
not able to make it to the  clinic during this window, these data will be missing.  
 
 At the 12 -Month appointment, the research intern will collect the  research BP values, 
any BP medications that the participants are currently taking, a 12- Month Exit Survey 
(Appendix 11) asking for the participant’s feedback about the study, and send another $50 
compensation check. All of the procedures outlined at baseline will be followed again, but the 
data w ill be collected on separate 12- Month REDCap forms (not shown).  Participants will also 
be asked about any hospitalizations or emergency room visits that occurred over the 12- month 
follow up period, especially those that occurred outside of the University of Iowa system  
(Appendix  12).  
 
 Additionally , the research team will conduct a 12- Month Medical Record Review for each 
participant. This chart review will occur separately from the 12- Month visit and will not require 
any effort on the part of the participant. A member of the research team will screen the 
participant’s medical record for all clinic/quick care visits (documenting reason), any emergency 
room visits (documenting reason), and any hospitalizations (documenting reason and length of 
stay). These data will be recorded on the REDCap forms in Appendix 13. Again, multiple 
entries will be allowed by REDCap.    
 
4.7 Adverse Event Reporting and Determination  
 
 As this is a low- risk study, we do not anticipate many adverse events. However, if any 
member of the research team becomes aware of a potential adverse event, they will report it to 
Dr. Pete r Snyder ( peter -snyder@uiowa.edu ). He will review the event and make a ruling as to 
whether the adverse event is related to the study or not . If he determines that an adverse event 
has occurred, the DSMB and IRB will be notified as quickly as possible. Until an official ruling 
has been made by Dr. Peter  Snyder, other members of the research team should not be 
notified, because they  are blinded to group assignment.  
 
4.8 Unanticipated Problem Reporting  
 
 There are other types of incidents, experiences, and outcomes that occur during the 
conduct of human subjects  research that represent unanticipated problems but are not 
considered adverse events. For example, some unanticipated problems involve social or 
20 
 economic harm instead of physical or psychological harm associated with adverse events. In 
other cases, unanticipated problems place subjects or others at increased risk of harm, but no harm occurs. If an unanticipated problem occurs that does not involve an adverse event, it will 
still be reported to the DSMB and the IRB under HHS regulation 45 CFR Part 46 (
Unanticipated 
Events HHS Policy ). 
 
5. Study Outcomes  
  The study will have one primary outcome and three secondary outcome measures for 
the three specific aims. The primary outcome is change in SBP  12 months after the start of the 
intervention. The secondary outcomes are change in DBP 12 months after the start of the 
intervention, the number of medication changes as a measure of treatment intensification , and 
the additional cost of the intervention.  
 Aim 1 : Determine if our intervention leads to decreases in SBP. 
 Our working hypothesis is that there will be greater decreases in both SBP and DBP 
among the pharmacist -intervention group than among controls. We will compute the change in 
SBP for each subject at 12 months compared to their initial SBP. The S BP readings will be 
collected at enrollment and at 12- months by research assistants. The primary outcome measure 
for Aim 1 will be th e difference in mean SBP  between the control and intervention groups at 12 
months.   
 Aim 2 : Determine if our intervention leads to intensification of therapy.  
 Our working hypothesis is that there will be a greater number of medication changes in 
the intervention group compared to the control group. We will count the number of medication 
changes (dose increased, dose decreased, drug stopped, drug started) during the 12 months 
following the start of the intervention. The total number of medication changes will be the primary outcome measure for Aim 2. In addition, we will determine the number of pharmacist recommendations that were accepted by physicians. These ar e process measures: we found in 
our previous studies that BP improvement was primarily related to medication changes. We are assuming that changes are a sign of close monitoring. Indeed, we hav e used this measure 
previously.  However, we realize that not all medication changes are equal, and thus we will 
record both medication trends and final treatment for each patient.  
 Aim 3 : Determine the cost effectiveness of the intervention.  
 Our working hypothesis is that our intervention will be cost effective when compared to 
the control group. In addition, we will compare these results to previous pharmacist interventions. Because much pharmacist time is spent on non- direct patient care ac tivities, we 
are convinced that our bi -directional texting approach will be both labor and cost saving. We will 
compute the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER)  using the total costs of doctor visits, 
pharmacist time, medications and medication changes during the 12 months of the trial. The 
ICER will be the difference between the control and intervention groups in average total cost 
21 
 divided by the difference in average decrease of SBP and DBP. The ICER will be expressed in 
the dollars per mm Hg reduction in BP and will be the primary outcome in this Aim.  
6. Statistical Design and Power   
 Aim 1 Analysis : The analysis will be done on an intent -to-treat basis regardless of the 
number of reported BP readings or the number of pharmacist interactions with the participant.  
Our primary outcome will be a comparison of mean SBP values at 12 months. We will use linear 
mixed effects models (LMMs) with  BP as the outcome. W e will explore the timing of the change 
by also evaluating BP at 6 months . To test the intervention, we will include time (baseline, 6 
month, 12 month) as a fixed effect factor and its inter action with treatment arm. We will use 
random effects for clinic and physician nested within clinic to account for practice heterogeneity 
between clinics and providers. Temporal correlation will be accounted for by using an 
autoregressive error structure. Specifically, the model will be given as  
𝐵𝐵𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 =𝜏𝜏𝑐𝑐+𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐+𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐+�𝜔𝜔𝑐𝑐+𝜈𝜈𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐+𝜉𝜉𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐�𝑋𝑋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐+𝜖𝜖𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐, 
 𝑐𝑐=1,…,𝐶𝐶,𝑝𝑝=1,…,𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐,𝑖𝑖=1,…,𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡∈{0,6,12}, 
�𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐,𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐�′∼iid𝑁𝑁(0,𝐺𝐺1), 
(𝜈𝜈0𝑐𝑐,𝜈𝜈6𝑐𝑐,𝜈𝜈12𝑐𝑐)′∼iid𝑁𝑁(0,𝐺𝐺2), 
�𝜉𝜉0𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐,𝜉𝜉6𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐,𝜉𝜉12𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐�′∼iid𝑁𝑁(0,𝐺𝐺3), 
�𝜖𝜖𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐0,𝜖𝜖𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐6,𝜖𝜖𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐12�′∼iid𝑁𝑁(0,𝑅𝑅), 
where 𝐶𝐶 is the number of clinics, 𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐 is the number of providers within the 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐ℎclinic, 𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is the 
number of subjects recruited under the 𝑝𝑝𝑐𝑐ℎ provider in the 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐ℎ clinic, 𝐵𝐵𝑃𝑃(𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ) is the blood 
pressure at time 𝑡𝑡 for the 𝑖𝑖𝑐𝑐ℎ subject under the 𝑝𝑝𝑐𝑐ℎ provider within clinic 𝑐𝑐, 𝜏𝜏𝑐𝑐 is the control mean 
at time 𝑡𝑡 , 𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 and 𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 are the random control effects for the clinic and provider -nested- within -
clinic respectively, 𝜔𝜔𝑐𝑐 is the treatment effect at time 𝑡𝑡, 𝜈𝜈𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 and 𝜉𝜉𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 are the random treatment 
effects for the clinic and provider -nested- within -clinic respectively, 𝑋𝑋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 equals 1 if the 𝑖𝑖𝑐𝑐ℎ subject 
under the 𝑝𝑝𝑐𝑐ℎ provider within clinic 𝑐𝑐  is assigned to the treatment group and zero otherwise, 𝜖𝜖𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 
is the (auto -correlated) noise term, and 𝐺𝐺1, 𝐺𝐺2, 𝐺𝐺3, and 𝑅𝑅 are covariance matrices for the 
random effects. This model will also be estimated for DBP.  
Second, t ransition to control for patients who were uncontrolled at their baseline visit will be 
modeled using a generalized linear mixed effects model (GLMM) based on the Bernoulli 
distribution with a logist ic link . We will test the intervention by including a fixed- effects term for 
the treatment assignment (intervention v ersus control) .  As before, we will include random  
effects for provider nested within clinic . Specifically, the model will be  
logit�ℙ�𝑍𝑍𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐6=1�𝑍𝑍𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐0=0��=𝜏𝜏+𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐+𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐+�𝜔𝜔+𝜈𝜈𝑐𝑐+𝜉𝜉𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐�𝑋𝑋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐, 
�𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐,𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐�′∼iid𝑁𝑁(0,𝐺𝐺1), 
�𝜈𝜈𝑐𝑐,𝜉𝜉𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐�′∼iid𝑁𝑁(0,𝐺𝐺2), 
where 𝑍𝑍𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 equals 1 if the  𝑖𝑖𝑐𝑐ℎ subject under the 𝑝𝑝𝑐𝑐ℎ provider within clinic 𝑐𝑐 is controlled at time 𝑡𝑡, 
𝑡𝑡∈{0,6}, and zero otherwise.  
22 
 Third, we will assess the duration of the change by modeling the odds of having controlled BP at 
12 months among those uncontrolled at baseline but controlled at 6 months using a GLMM 
similar to that described above. All three models will contain any covariates (e.g., age, sex) that 
were not sufficiently addressed through randomization. In all analyses, the random effects 
incorporated into the final model will be chosen via Akaike Information Criterion with correction 
for small sample sizes (AICc).  
 
 Power : Based on prior work with the CAPTION trial, we expect a mean decrease in SBP 
of 17.3 (SD = 17.7 ) mmHg in the intervention arm and a decrease of 11.6 (SD = 18.2) mmHg in 
the control arm. We expect a difference of 5.65 mmHg between the groups with an expected 
pooled standard deviation of 17.9  with equal sized groups. In order to have 90% power to detect 
a difference of 5.7  mmHg or larger decrease in SBP with a Type I error rate of 5% and a 
standard deviation of 17.9 mmHg, we would need 180 subjects per arm or 360 subjects total.  
 
In preliminary work in the CAPTION trial, 13.4% of control subjects dropped out or were 
lost to follow- up. 14.0% of subjects dropped out of the intervention arm during the first 9 months. 
In order to retain power after reasonable attrition rates over 12 months, we will recruit an 
additional 14% in each group to ensure we have at least 85% power. In addition, the sample 
size should be slightly increased to accommodate the interim analyses.  This increases  our total 
sample size to 420.  
One interim analysis is planned after outcome data are received and the results are 
reported to the Data Safety and Monitoring Board from the first half of the study. The interim 
monitoring method of Lan and DeMets will be used with O’Brien- Fleming alpha s pending 
function for the interim analyses. Accordingly, type I error rate of 0.00305 for the interim analysis 
and 0.4695 will be used for the final analyses. The current sample size of 420 patients total 
accommodates the interim analyses.   
 Aim 2  Analysis : The analysis will be done on an intent -to-treat basis regardless of the 
number of reported BPs or the number of pharmacist interactions with the subject . Our primary 
outcome will be the number of medication changes over 12 months in the control and 
intervention groups. W e will use a GLMM based on the Poisson distribution with a log link 
function,  and as in Aim 1 we will incorporate random effects for clinic and physician nested 
within clinic to account for practice heterogeneity between clinics and providers. As the 
observed treatment effects in those clusters are likely to be non -independent, w e will include 
both random intercepts and random treatment effect for the intervention factor. Specifically, the 
model will be given as  
log�𝔼𝔼�𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐��=𝜏𝜏+𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐+𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐+�𝜔𝜔+𝜈𝜈𝑐𝑐+𝜉𝜉𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐�𝑋𝑋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐, 
�𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐,𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐�′∼iid𝑁𝑁(0,𝐺𝐺1), 
�𝜈𝜈𝑐𝑐,𝜉𝜉𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐�′∼iid𝑁𝑁(0,𝐺𝐺2), 
23 
 where 𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is the number of medication changes for the  𝑖𝑖𝑐𝑐ℎ subject under the 𝑝𝑝𝑐𝑐ℎ provider within 
clinic 𝑐𝑐. The random effects incorporated into the final model will be chosen via AICc.  
 Power : Based on existing work, we expect an average of 4.9 medication changes in the 
intervention group (SD = 5.1) and an average of 1.1 medication changes in the control group 
(SD = 1.6). We would expect a difference of 3.8 changes per year with a pooled standard deviation of 3.8. In order to have  85% power to detect a difference of 3.8 or more changes with 
a Type I error rate of 5% and a standard deviation of 3.8, we woul d need 19 subjects per arm 
or 38 total. Considering both 14% loss to follow -up and adjusting the type I error rate for interim 
analysis, power  of the study  with our sample size of 420 will be more than adequate.  
 Aim 3 Analysis : The analysis will be performed on an intent -to-treat basis regardless of 
the number of reported BP measurement s or the number of pharmacist interactions with the 
subject . The perspective of this cost analysis is society in general. For each patient encounter, 
pharmacists will record  the number of minutes spent in the following activities: medical record 
review, consultation, patient assessment, ordering medications, medical education, lifestyle education, BP measurement education, making recommendations, and documentation in the 
medical record. Pharmacist costs will be estimated by multiplying the time spent by their 
compensation rate. Costs for clinic visits will be obtained from the university. Utilization 
measures will be converted to costs per subject using the Medicare fee schedule for visits. 
Pharmacist and physician salaries will be obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The 
average wholesale drug cost for prescription medications wil l be obtained from Lexicomp Online 
(https://o nline.lexi.com). Generic prices will be  used when available. The drug cost per 
prescription for each subject  will be calculated by multiplying the average wholesale price 
(AWP) by frequency and dose.   
We assume that subjects  in the intervention and control groups will have similar characteristics.  
However, if there are significant differences between the subjects  in these groups, costs will be 
predicted using a multivariate generalized linear model with a gamma family and a log link to 
control for these differences.  
We will determine  the cost of the intervention by subtracting the average total cost (pharmacist, 
clinic, and drugs) for the intervention group  from the average total costs for the control group. 
The ICER is ca lculated as the cost differential from the intervention divided by the outcome 
differential from the intervention.  Our primary outcome will be average decrease in SBP, and the 
outcome differential will be the average decrease in SBP for the control group minus the 
average decrease in SBP for the inter vention group. The result of this analysis will be an ICER, 
which gives the additional cost of the intervention per mm Hg of SBP decrease.   
We will conduct at least two sensitivity analyses. Because the drug costs (average wholesale 
prices) from Lexicomp often overstate the actual prices paid by insurance companies and 
patients, we will adjust our  drug costs and re- estimate our cost -effectiveness analysis. 
Specifically, the Kaiser Fami ly Foundation estimates that  average wholesale prices are, on 
average 17% higher than weighted acquisition costs for brand -name drugs, and 80% higher for 
generic drugs.  In addition, pharmacist time can be represented by either wages per hour, or the 
24 
 amount that pharmacists can bill Medicare for each activity. We will consider both ways to 
measure the value of pharmacists’ time.  
7. Data Safety and Monitoring  
 
 All procedures and protocols will be developed by the PIs and the study coordinator with 
protec tion of the participants and data as the highest priority . All procedures will be reviewed by 
the University of Iowa IRB as well as  the Data and Safety Monitoring Board prior to being 
implemented (additional information about DSMB members and responsibilities can be found in 
the DSMB Charter). The study coordinator will thoroughly train and monitor all research interns 
during the course of the study and will be available to answer questions via phone when not in the clinic.  
 
8. Study Responsibilities

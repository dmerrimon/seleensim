Amendment 3.0: 16 February  2024  
Overall Rationale for the Amendment  3.0: 
This protocol has been amended to  extend the visit windows  to ensure data is included in the 
Per Protocol Set (PPS) analysis given the large number of participants whose Visit 3 or Visit 5 
was out of window.  In this amendment, t ext from the updated GSK protocol template 
regarding publication policy has been added , and a correction to the number of times each 
serum sample will be tested in the same assay has been made in the hemagglutination 
inhibition assay  section.  The list of medical conditions considered to represent pote ntial 
immune -mediated diseases (pIMDs) has been updated to the Standard MedDRA query for 
Immune -mediated/autoimmune diseases at the request of the FDA. Finally due to late 
availability of Day 43 immunogenicity data a preliminary analysis of safety data up to Day 43 
has been added.

Section # and Name  Description of Change s from 
Amendment 2.0 to Amendment 3.0 Brief Rationale  
Section 1.3 Schedule of 
Activities, Table 2 
Interval Between Study 
Visits  Updated allowed interval range for 
Visit 1 → Visit 3 and Visit 3 → 
Visit  5: 
• 14 – 28 35 days To ensure data is included in the PPS 
analysis given the large number of 
participants whose Visit 3 or Visit 5 was 
out of window . 
Section 9.1 Statistical 
Hypotheses  The following text was updated:  
Null hypotheses will be assessed 
independently in each of the 4 dose 
groups using a Bonferroni 
adjustment to control the 2.5% type I 
error.  The update is done to adjust the large 
number of participants excluded from 
the PPS.  
CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol 219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
4 Section # and Name  Description of Change s from 
Amendment 2.0 to Amendment 3.0 Brief Rationale  
Null hypotheses will be assessed 
according to a hierarchical  order of 
study groups as given below.  
1. 7.5 mcg antigen + AS03A  
2. 7.5 mcg antigen + AS03B  
3. 3.75 mcg antigen + AS03A  
4. 3.75 mcg antigen + AS03B  
No multiplicity adjustment is 
required as the hypothesis for each 
study group will be tested if the 
succes s criteria will be met for the 
previous group in the hierarchy.  
Accordingly, a nominal type I error 
of 0.625 2.5% will be used for each 
dose group and the objective will be 
met for one dose group if all 2 null 
hypotheses are rejected 
simultaneously.  
Criteri a for success to be met 
simultaneously for a study group : 
The lower limit (LL) of the 
98.75 95% confidence interval (CI)    
for the SPR meets or exceeds 70% 
for adults of 18 to 64 years of age.  
The LL of the 98.75 95% CI for the 
SPR meets or exceeds 60% for adults 
≥65 years of age.  
Section 9.2 Sample Size 
Determination  The following text was updated:  
A non -evaluable rate of no more than 
8% yields  23% and 30% in 18  to 
64 years of age and ≥65 years of age 
groups, respectively yield  an 
approximate sample size of 120 
95 evaluable participants per dose 
group (i.e., 60 50 participants 
between 18 to 64 years of age and 
60 45 participants above 65 years of 
age in each dose group) , giving 
73.577.8% overall power to fulfill 
the 2 SPR immunogenicity criteria in 
any in the first group that is 7.5 mcg 
antigen + AS03A one of the 4 dose 
groups . This assumes that the SPR 
are truly 20% higher than the critical 
value (namely 90% for particip ants 
18 to 64 years of age and 80% for The update is done to adjust the large 
number of par ticipants excluded from 
the PPS.  
CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol 219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
5 Section # and Name  Description of Change s from

participants ≥65 years of age, 
respectively).  
The statistical power in 7.5  mcg 
antigen + AS03A group will be 
91.4% if the SPR is assumed as 85% 
in ≥65 years of age.  
Section 9.5.1.1 Interim 
Safety Analysis  Section 9.5.1. 1 heading title was 
updated to :  
Interim Safety Analysis at Day  43. Due to the delay in developing the 
Hemagglutination Inhibition assay, the 
interim analysis is split into 2  separate 
deliverables of safety data and 
immunological data.  
The following text was updated:  
• Analyses of cleaned solicited 
administration site events and 
solicited systemic events data 
collected during a 7 -day 
follow -up period (i.e., day of 
vaccination and 6 subsequent 
days) after each vaccination will 
be conducted . 
• Analyses of unsolicited AEs 
reported up to the Day 43 visit 
(i.e., day of vaccination and 
20 subsequent days after each 
vaccine) and cleaned in so far as 
is possible , will be carr ied out . 
• Analyses of SAEs, pIMDs, 
MAEs, pregnancies, and 
withdrawals due to AEs, 
collected up to the Day 43 visit , 
will be carried out . Text was updated for conciseness . 
Added text:  
• No study report will be 
prepared. Access to individual 
treatment codes will be 
restricted to the designated 
statisticians in charge of the 
analysis. No individual listings 
or data with the participants’ 
identifying information will be 
disseminated. Listings of final 
data will be provided with the 
EOS report.  Clarification of the expectations for the 
interim analysis of safety.  
Removed text:  
• Analyses of cleaned 
immunogenicity data, for 
analysis of vaccine -homologous 
HI antibody titers and MN titers, Text was moved  to the newly -added 
Section  9.5.1.2, Interim Immunogenicity 
Analysis at Day  43.

Section 9.5.1.2  Interim 
Immunogenicity Analysis 
at Day 43  A new section, Interim 
Immunogenicity Analysis at Day  43, 
was added.  This analysis will inform on the safety of 
Egg-based AS03 H5N1 vaccine that will 
be used in case a Pandemic is declared.  
The following text was added:  
An analysis will be performed on 
data collected through the Day  43 
visit. Elements will include:  
• Analyses of cleaned 
immunogenicity data, for 
analysis of vaccine -homologous 
HI antibody titers and MN 
titers, collected through the Day

Section 10.2 Appendix  2: 
Clinical Laboratory Tests  Updated Hemagglutination Inhibition 
Assay  process : 
Briefly, serum samples are first 
adsorbed with RBCs to remove 
non-specific agglutinins and then 
treated with receptor destroying 
enzyme overnight to remove 
non-specific inhibitors of the 
hemagglutination, then diluted to 
1:10, and serial diluted 2 -fold in 
triplicate duplicate  from 1:10 to 
1:10240.”  
“Each seraserum sample will be 
tested in triplicate duplicate  within 
the same assay.  The final result 
corresponds to the GMT for the 
duplicate 3 titer results will be 
reported, as will the GMT for the 
triplicate . Correction

13 1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1 Synopsis  
Protocol Title:   
A Phase I/II observer -blind, randomized, multi -center trial to evaluate the safety and 
immunogenicity of different formulations of monovalent Influenza 
A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 -like (H5N8) virus vaccine with AS03 adjuvant system, given as a 
two-dose series to adults 18  to 64 years of age and 65 years of age and older . 
Rationale : 
The emergence of a novel reassortant influenza A (H5N8) virus in Russia in December 2020 
was associated with 7 human cases – none of which were symptomatic, and none resulted in 
death. However, this influenza virus was associated with a high mortality rate amo ng birds. 
The likelihood of human infection is low at present, although previous infections in humans 
have been observed in China since 2014. The United States poultry population is currently 
experiencing a high number of avian flu cases, increasing the li kelihood of an interspecies 
crossover event that will increase transmission and infection in humans. In any case, crossover 
events resulting in influenza strains capable of triggering epidemics like the 2009 swine flu 
epidemic are inevitable. The first hum an case of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza 
(HPAI)A(H5) virus in the United States was reported in late April 2022 and the virus has 
remained in wild bird flyways during the summer with the migrating birds already bringing it 
back into the country in fall  2022. This study tests a platform for H5N8 strains with the goal 
of providing additional public health preparedness and protection.  
Vaccination is the primary control measure against the spread of influenza virus infection in 
humans. Efforts are, therefo re, underway to develop vaccines that could mitigate the impact of 
an H5N8 pandemic. GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) will produce an investigational 
AS03 -adjuvanted influenza A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 -like (H5N8) virus vaccine and will 
conduct a clinical trial to assess the immunogenicity and safety of different formulations of an 
H5N8 split virus vaccine manufactured in GSK Biologicals’ Québec facility, administered 
with AS03 adjuvant.

14 Objectives , and Endp oints: 
 
Objectives  Endpoints  (Population Summary)  
Primary  
Immunogenicity:  
To evaluate whether the monovalent influenza 
A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 -like (H5N8) virus vaccine 
containing  3.75 µg, or 7.5 µg of HA with AS03 A or 
AS03 B elicits a HI response  to the 
vaccine  -homologous  virus  that meets  or exceeds  the 
US Food and Drug Administration, Center for 
Biologics Evaluation and Research immunogenicity 
criteria at the Day 43 visit.  Humoral  immune  response  in terms  of: 
• Vaccine -homologous  HI titers  at Day 43 (i.e., 
GMT).  
• Vaccine -homologous  HI titers  increase at 
Day 43 compared to pre -vaccination ( i.e., 
GMFR).  
• SP defined  as titer ≥1:40 at Day 43 
(percentage of participants meeting SP 
criteria).

21 2.0 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Study Rationale  
Novel influenza A viruses, including subtypes H5N1, H3N2v, H9N2, A(H1N1)  pdm09, H7N9 
and H5N8, continue to emerge and infect humans; therefore, it is imperative that preparation 
be maintained for the next influenza pandemic.  
The US National Pre -Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile contains various influenza virus 
vaccines, including influenza A(H5) and A(H7) virus vaccines, as well as adjuvants, including 
AS03, for administration wit h the vaccine antigens to improve the immunogenicity and 
achieve antigen dose -sparing.  
The emergence of a novel reassortant influenza A (H5N8) virus in Russia in December  2020 
was associated with 7 human cases – none of which were symptomatic  or associated with any 
deaths.  However, this influenza virus was associated with a high mortality rate among birds .1 
The likelihood of human infection is low at present, although previous infections in humans 
have been obse rved in China since 2014 .2 The United States poultry population is currently 
experiencing a high number of avian flu cases, increasing the likelihood of an interspecies 
crossover event that will increase transmission and infectio n in humans. In any case, crossover 
events resulting in influenza strains capable of triggering epidemics like the 2009 swine flu 
epidemic are inevitable. This study tests a platform for H5N8 strains with the goal of 
providing additional public health prep aredness and protection.3 
The first human case of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI)A(H5) virus in the United 
States was reported in late April 2022 and the virus has remained in wild bird flyways during 
the summer with t he migrating birds already bringing it back into the country in fall 2022 .4 
Therefore, it is crucial that preparation be maintained to enable rapid and successful process 
scale -up for commercial scale production if needed for an event. Antigenic analyses indicate 
that the candidate vaccine virus (CVV) A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 -like (H5N8) influenza virus 
cross -reacts with the most recent A(H5) viruses from wild birds and poultry in the U S, 
Europe, Africa, and Asia.  
Vaccination is the primary control measure against the spread of influenza virus infection in 
humans. Efforts are, therefore, underway to develop vaccines that could mitigate the impact of 
an H5N8 pandemic . GSK will produce an investigational AS03 -adjuvanted influenza 
A/Astr akhan/3212/2020 -like (H5N8) virus vaccine and will conduct a clinical trial to assess 
the immunogenicity and safety of different formulations of an H5N8 split virus vaccine 
manufactured in GSK Biologicals’ Québec facility, administered with AS03 adjuvant.  
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol  219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
22 2.2 Background  
Given the emergence of new influenza variants of concern and the ongoing need to match 
variants with vaccines, there is a critical need to ensur e timely development of a H5N8 
influenza vaccine.  
Earlier studies have show n that the pandemic influenza vaccines administered with AS03 
adjuvant had a similar safety profile where in most of the adverse events occur around the time 
of vaccination.  Review of data from these  studies also suggests a favorable  safety profile for 
adults over 65 years of age . 
Furthermore,  Biomedical  Advanced  Research  and Development  Authority  (BARDA ), in 
collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  has 
previously conducted 3 clinical studi es (DMID 15 -0064, DMID 15 -0066, BARDA BPI  
16005) using a non -GSK H5N8 antigen in combination with varying doses of either MF59 or 
GSK’s AS03 as  an adjuvant. These so -called ‘mix and match’ studies were completed in 
2020, with DMID 15 -0064 and 15 -0066 toget her enrolling approximately 664 participants, of 
which 264 received an AS03 -containing vaccine. The BPI 16005 study assessed the safety and 
immunogenicity of a homologous or heterologous vaccination series with inactivated 
monovalent influenza H5 vaccines  (H5N1 and H5N8)  and enrolled 720 participants.  Data 
from these studies have showed that the vaccines were well tolerated in terms of safety 
profiles (follow -up period of up  to 12 months period for the DMID studies and up to 
17 months for the BARDA study). In terms of immunogenicity, these studies demonstrated 
that to achieve adequate immune responses, two doses of vaccines were required, and the 
immunogenicity was enhanced by the addition of AS03 A adjuvant .5,6 
GSK is planning to conduct a Phase I/II observer -blind, randomized, multi -center trial  in 2023  
to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of different formulations of monovalent Influenza 
A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 -like (H5N8) virus vaccine with the AS03 adjuvant system, given as a 
two-dose series to adults 18 to 64 years of age and 65 years of age and o lder.

This is a Phase  I/II, observer -blind,  randomized,  age- stratified,  multi -centric study  with 
4 parallel groups, which will be conducted in the US.  
The study is planned to enroll approximately 520 participants randomly assigned to one of the

size in each dose group: 18  to 64 years of age (approximately 50% of participants enrolled) 
and 65  years of age and older (approximately 50% of participants en rolled).  
Each participant will receive 2 intramuscular doses of study vaccine 21 days apart. Each

All the participants will have screening laboratory tests to determine eligibility for the study. 
The first 50% of enrolled participants in each age and dose group will be required to have 
on-site visits for safety laboratory tests 7  days after each vaccination (i.e., Visit 2 and Visit 4).  
All other participants will have a remote visit  (e.g., telephone call, video call, email, or text 
communication)  with the site.  
This study will be conducted with oversight by an internal  Safety Review Committee (iSRC) . 
See Section 10.1.7  for iSRC structure.  
4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
Novel influenza A viruses, including subtypes H5N1, H3N2v, H9N2, A(H1N1) pdm09, H7N9 
and H5N8, continue to emerge and infect humans; therefore, it is imperative that preparation 
be maintained for the next influenza pandemic. The US National Pre -Pandemic In fluenza 
Vaccine Stockpile contains various influenza virus vaccines, including influenza A(H5) and 
A(H7) virus vaccines, as well as adjuvants, including AS03, for administration with the 
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol  219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
27 vaccine antigens to improve the immunogenicity and achieve antigen do se-sparing. The 
rationale for the study design is such that it allows the assessment of antigen sparing by 
varying the amount of adjuvant present, as well as assessing the effect of a change in antigen 
dose. It also further assesses any difference in immun e response or safety profile in an older 
population (>65 years old) compared to a younger age subgroup (18  to 64 years old).  
4.3 Justification for Dose  
The rationale for evaluating 3.75  g and 7.5  g doses of the H5N8 antigen is based on the  
BARDA ’s requireme nt to assess the dose -sparing ability of full or half doses of AS03 in 
combination with Influenza  A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 -like (H5N8) virus vaccine , as well as 
previous experience with AS03 containing pandemic influenza vaccines. GSK has previously 
evaluated  both 3.75  g and 7.5  g antigen doses in combination with the AS03 adjuvant in 
development of the H5N1 and H7N9 vaccines with a positive risk/benefit . 
AS03 A (11.86 mg tocopherol) and AS03 B (5.93 mg tocopherol) will be evaluated in this study,  
since  both AS03 formulations  have  been  shown  to improve  the immunogenicity  of inactivated 
split-virion H5N1 and H7N9 pandemic influenza vaccines in studies conducted by GSK.7-14  
Further information on dose justification for this study can be found in the IB.  
4.4 End of Study  Definition  
A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she return ed for the last visit as 
described in th is protocol.  
End of Study ( EOS ) is the  last subject last visit (L SLV) (contact at 6 months post  -last dose)  
or date of the last testing/reading released of the Human Biological Samples or imaging data, 
related to primary and secondary endpoints, whichever occurs later. E nd of study  must be 
achieved no later than 8 months after LSLV. E nd of study  cannot be before LSLV .

34 6.2 Preparation , Handling , Storage , and Accountability  
The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit  and storage  for all study intervention received , and any 
discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study intervention.  
Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study intervention , and only authorized 
study site staff may supply or administer study intervention.  
All study intervention must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored 
(manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access 
limited to the investigator and authorized study site staff.  
The investigator is responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record 
maintenance ( i.e., receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).  
The investigator, a member of the study site staff, o r a hospital pharmacist must maintain an 
adequate record of the receipt , distribution , and storage temperature of the study vaccine  using 
the Drug Accountability Form. These forms must be available for inspection at any time.  
Further guidance and information for the storage, handling, and final disposition of study 
interventions are provided in the  Pharmacy  Manual . 
6.3 Measures to Minimiz e Bias: Randomization and Blinding  
All participants will be centrally assigned to randomized study intervention using an 
interactive web response system (IWRS). The randomization will be stratified by age 
subgroup and use a permutation blocking  scheme.  Before the study is initiated, the log -in 
information and directions for the IWRS will be provided to each study site.  
Data will be collected in a n observer -blind manner. The investigator(s) , their staff and the 
participants will not be aware of the study int ervention assignment. The study intervention 
will be prepared and administered by qualified study personnel who can be aware of the 
intervention assignment.  The number of each intervention kit will be recorded in the eCRF.  
The laboratory in charge of sampl e testing will be blinded to the study intervention 
assignment. Codes will be used to link the participant and study to each sample. There will be 
no link between the study intervention and the identity of the participant.  
GSKs Global Safety  staff may unblind the intervention assignment for any participant with an 
SAE. If the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be sent to one or more regulatory 
agencies, a copy of the report, identifying the participant’s intervention assignment,  may be 
sent to investigators in accordance with local regulations and/or GSK  policy.  
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol  219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
35 6.4 Study Intervention Compliance  
When participants are dosed at the site, they will receive study intervention directly from the 
investigator or designee, under medical supe rvision. The date and time of each dose 
administered in the clinic will be recorded in the source documents  and the eCRF . See 
Section  8.3 for pre - and post -vaccination procedures.  
6.5 Dose Modification  
Dose modifications are not applicable for this study.  
6.6 Continued Access to Study Intervention After the End of the Study  
Not applicable for this study.   
6.7 Treatment of Overdose  
For this study, an overdo se is any dose of study intervention  given to a participant that 
exceeds the maximum study dose for a single vaccination.  
GSK does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose.  
In the event of an overdose, the investigator  should:  
• Contact the medical mo nitor immediately.  
• Evaluate the participant to determine, in consultation with the medical monitor, whether 
study intervention should be interrupted or whether the  subsequent  dose should be 
reduced.  
6.8 Concomitant Therapy  
Any medication or vaccine (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, recreational 
drugs, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) or other specific categories of interest that the 
participant is receiving at the time of enrollment or receives during th e study must be recorded 
along with:  
• Reason for use  
• Dates of administration including start and end dates  
• Dosage information including dose and frequency  
• Route of administration  
• For vaccines (if applicable) include brand name and manufacturer (plus lot num ber if 
available)  
Concomitant therapy that meets the exclusionary criteria for this stud y is listed in  
Section  5.2.2 . 
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol  219833

37 7.0 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND 
PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
Discontinuation of specific study sites or of the study as a whole are detailed in 
Section  10.1.11 . 
7.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention  
Discontinuation of study intervention refers to any participant who has received the first dose 
and has not received the second dose of study interventio n. A participant who discontinued 
study intervention may continue other study procedures ( e.g., safety  assessment  or 
immunogenicity  testing ), planned in the study protocol at the discretion of the investigator.  
The primary reason for premature discontinua tion of the study intervention will be 
documented on the eCRF as follows:  
 
• AE requiring expedited reporting  (i.e., SAE,  potential immune -mediated disease [ pIMD ]) 
• Unsolicited non -serious  AE  
• Safety laboratory assessment results that are Grade 2 (moderate) or greater based on FDA 
toxicity grading that did not resolve , after repeat testing , to FDA toxicity Grade 1 or less  
(Figure 2) 
• Solicited event  
• Protocol Deviation  
• Not willing to be vaccinated  
• Pregnancy  
• Inappropriate enrollment  
• Other (specify)  
It may be necessary for a participant to permanently discontinue study intervention. If study 
intervention is permanently discontinued, the participant will be encouraged to remain in the 
study to be evaluated for post- dose visits  and for safety follow -up. See the Schedule of 
Activities ( SoA) in Section  1.3 for data to be collected at the time of discontinuation of study 
intervention and follow -up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed.  
Participants who discontinue study intervention will not be replaced . 
7.1.1 Contraindications to Subsequent St udy Intervention(s) Administration  
The eligibility for subsequent study intervention administration must be confirmed before 
administering any additional dose.  
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol  219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
38 Participants who meet any of the criteria listed below or criteria listed in Sections 5.2.1  and 
5.2.2  should not receive additional dos es of study intervention. Such participants should be 
encouraged to continue other study procedures. All relevant criteria for discontinuation of 
study intervention administration must be recorded in the eCRF.  
• Participants who experience any SAE judged to be possibly or probably related to study 
intervention or non -study concomitant vaccine/product, including hypersensitivity 
reactions.  
• Participants who develop any new condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, may 
pose additional risk to the part icipants if they continue to participate in the study.  
• Anaphylaxis following the administration of study interventions.  
• Any c ondition that in the judgment of the investigator would make intramuscular injection 
unsafe.  
• Occurrence of a new pIMD that, in the opinion of the investigator, expose s the participant 
to unacceptable risk from subsequent vaccination. In such cases, the investigator should 
use their clinical judgment prior to administering the next dose of the study interventions. 
Refer to Section 8.5.7.1  for the definition of pIMD.  
• Pregnancy . 
7.2 Participant Discontinuation/ Withdrawal from the Study  
A participant  may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request for any r eason 
(or without providing any reason) or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the 
investigator  for safety, behavioral , or compliance  reasons . 
Participants who discontinue  study intervention or withdrawn from the study due to a safety 
issue are required to have a follow -up visit to monitor the status of the safety issue. Otherwise,  
the participant will be permanently discontinued from the study intervention and the study at 
that time . 
All data and samples colle cted up to and including the date of withdrawal of/last contact with 
the participant will be included in the study analyses. If the participant withdraws consent for 
disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain and continue to use any data 
collected before such a withdrawal of consent.  
If a participant withdraws from the study, the participant may request destruction of any 
samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records.  
The primary reason for stu dy withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF based on the list 
below:  
• AE requiring expedited reporting  (i.e., SAE, pIMD)  
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol  219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
39 • Unsolicited non -serious  AE 
• Solicited events  
• Protocol deviation  
• Withdrawal by participant, not due to an AE*  
• Migrated/Moved from the stu dy area  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Sponsor study termination  
• Inappropriate enrollment  
• Other (specify)  
*If a participant is withdrawn from the study because he/she has withdrawn consent and 
provided the reason for its withdrawal, the investigator must document this reason in the 
eCRF.  
Participants who are withdrawn from the study because of SAEs/AEs must be clearly 
distinguished from participants who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigators will follow 
participants who are withdrawn from the study  as result of an SAE/AE until the event is 
resolved (see Section 10.5.3 ). 
7.3 Lost to Follow -up 
A participant  will be considered lost to follow -up if h e/she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.  
The following actions must be taken if a participant  fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit:  
• The study site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as 
soon as possible, counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned 
visit schedule and ascertain whether the participant wishes to and/or should continue in  the 
study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls, and if 
necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last know n mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s 
medical record.  
• Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study.  
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol  219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
40 8.0 STUDY ASSESSMEN TS AND PROCEDURES  
Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA  (Section 1.3). Protocol  waiver s 
or exemptions are not a llowed.  
Immediate  safety concerns  should be discussed with IQVIA immediately upon occurrence or 
awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study intervention . 
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA  
(Section  1.3), is essential and required for study conduct.  
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that  potential 
participant s meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participant s screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.  
Procedures  and associated data  conducted as pa rt of the participant’s routine clinical 
management (e.g., blood count)  and obtained before signing of the informed consent form 
(ICF) may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided  the procedures met the 
protocol -specified criteria and were p erformed within the timeframe defined in the SoA  
(Section 1.3). 
The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the study, 
including any extra assessments that may be required, will not exceed 240 mL.  
Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues  with 
the samples  (e.g., hemolyzed sample ). Only one sample per timepoint should be sent to the 
laboratory for testing.  
8.1 Screening Procedures  
8.1.1 Informed Consent  
The signed informed consent of the participant must be obtained before study participation. 
Refer to Section 10.1.4  for the requirement on how info rmed consent will be obtained.  
8.1.2 Check Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
All inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked as described in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 at 
Screening Visits and before dosing on Visit 1 and Visit 3.  
8.1.3 Collection of Demographic Data  
Demographic data according to local regula tions such as date of birth, sex, race*, ethnicity*, 
and occupation will be collected in the eCRF. Collection of sex, race, and ethnicity data is 
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol  219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
41 necessary to assess and monitor the diversity of the trial participants, and to determine if the 
trial partici pants are truly representative of the impacted population.  
*Differences in the safety and efficacy of certain medical products, including vaccines, have 
been observed in racially and ethnically distinct subgroups.18-20 These differences may be 
attributable to intrinsic factors (e.g., genetics, metabolism, elimination), extrinsic factors (e.g., 
diet, environmental exposure, sociocultural issues), or interactions between these factors. 
Therefor e, both geographic ancestry (race) and ethnicity will be collected for all study 
participants.  
8.1.4 Medical History  
The participant’s medical history will be obtained by interviewing the participant and a review 
of the participant’s available medical records. Any relevant pre -existing conditions, signs 
and/or symptoms present prior to the study intervention will be reco rded in the eCRF.  
8.1.5 Physical Examinations  
Physical examination will be performed for each participant.  
If the investigator determines that the participant’s health on the day of study intervention 
administration temporarily precludes dosing, the visit will be rescheduled. Refer to the 
Section  5.4 for the list of criteria for temporary delay of study intervention administration. 
Treatment of any a bnormality observed during this examination has to be performed 
according to local medical practice outside this study or by referral to an appropriate health 
care provider.  
Physical examination at each study visit after the Screening Visit will be perform ed only if the 
participant/participant’s caregiver(s) indicates during questioning that there might be some 
underlying pathology(ies) or if deemed necessary by the investigator or delegate.  
8.1.6 Medication and Vaccination History  
The participant’s medication an d vaccination history will be obtained by interviewing the 
participant and review of the participant’s available medical records.  
Participant’s vaccination history for prior 3 years should be collected.  
8.1.7 Biological Samples for Screening  
A volume of  approxim ately  10 mL whole blood will be collected at the Screening Visit for  the 
following laboratory assessments:  Hematology: complete blood count with differential and 
platelet count; Chemistry/metabolic panel: Sodium, Potassium, Creatinine, Alanine 
aminotransfe rase (ALT), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alkaline Phosphatase, total 
bilirubin , and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) . These laboratory assessments will be performed 
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol  219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
42 locally a t the site. Participants with laboratory assessment results of FDA toxicity Grade 1 or 
lower will be considered eligible to participate in the study (Section 10.3). 
8.2 Immunogenicity Assessments  
Collected biological samples will be used for protocol -mandated research and  purposes related 
to the improvement, development , validation , and quality assurance of the laboratory tests 
described in this protocol  and for transfer of sera samples to BARDA for future use , for those 
participants who consented their samples be utilized  for further research . 
Future findings may make it desirable to use the samples acquired in this study for future 
research not described in this protocol. All participants will be asked to give a specific consent 
to allow Sponsor  or a contracted partner to  use the samples for future research.  
Future research will be subject ed to prior  Independent Ethics Committee  (IEC)/Institutional 
Review Board ( IRB) approval if required per local legislation.  
Information on further investigations and their rationale can be obtained from Sponsor . 
Sample testing will be done in accordance with the recorded consent of the individual 
participant.  
If additional testing is performed, the marker priority ranking given  in Section 8.2.3  may be 
changed.  
Collected samples will be stored  at GSK  for a maximum of 20 years.  Samples at BARDA may 
be stored for 20 years an d beyond.  This storage period begins when the last participant 
performed the last study visit, unless local rules, regulations or guidelines require different 
timeframes or procedures, which would then be in line with participant consent. These extra 
requi rements need to be communicated formally, discussed , and agreed to with GSK.  
8.2.1 Biological Samples  
A volume of 40  mL whole blood will be collected at Visit s 1, 3, 5 , and 6  to provide 
approximately  15 mL serum intended to be used for assay development/validation, 
protocol -mandated research and  for transfer of sera samples to BARDA for future use  (if 
consented by participant) . The protocol -specified testing will be performed at GSK and/or 
GSK designated la boratories.  
Prior to measurement of the immune response , collected blood samples will be used to enable 
the development and the validation of the assays used in this study (HI and MN).

8.2.4 Immunological Correlates of Protection  
Although there is no accepted correlate of protection against influenza virus, either seasonal or 
pandemic, the protecti ve role of antibodies against HA and, to a lesser extent, neuraminidase, 
is well established and has been demonstrated both in experimentally infected animals and 
humans .15  
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol  219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
45 For this reason, the induction of HA-specific antibodies is used as a marker of potential 
vaccine efficacy and the serum HI assay is used to demonstrate this humoral response. 
Hemagglutination inhibition titers of 1:40 or greater have been associated with protection 
from influenza illness in at least 50% of participants in challenge studies and correlate with 
vaccine effectiveness.16,17 
8.3 Pre- and Post - Vaccination Procedures  
8.3.1 Check Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
All inclusion and  exclusion criteria will be re-checked as described in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 
before dosing on Visit 1 and Visit 3. 
8.3.2 Body Temperature  
Body temperature must be assessed  prior to study intervention administration and/or blood 
draw.  
If the participant has fever (fever is defined as temperature  ≥38.0°C [100.4°F ] regardless of 
the location of measurement) on the day of vaccination, the vaccination visit will be 
rescheduled within the allowed interval for this visit ( Table 2). 
If the investigator determines that the participant’s health on the day of vaccination 
temporarily precludes vaccination, the visit will be rescheduled.  
8.3.3 Pregnancy Testing  
Female participants of childbearing potential must perform a urine pregnancy test prior to any 
study vaccine administration. Pregnancy testing must be performed even if the participant is 
menstruating at the time of the study visit. The study intervention  may only be administered if 
the pregnancy test is negative.  
Refer to the Section 10.6.2  for the information on study continuation for participant w ho 
becomes pregnant during the study.  
8.3.4 Medical History  
Changes or updates to participant medical history since Screening Visit will be recorded in 
eCRF.  
8.3.5 Medication and Vaccine History  
Changes or updates to participant medical history since Screening Visit will be recorded in 
eCRF.  
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol  219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
46 8.3.6 Post-Vaccination Observation Period  
Participants will undergo a 30 -minute observation period immediately following 
administration of each dose of study vaccine, where they will be assessed by a qualified 
healthcare professional f or any signs of any adverse events.  
8.4 Safety Assessments  
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE, SAE, or pIMD. The investigator and any designees 
remain responsibl e for following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study 
intervention or the study, or that caused the participant to discontinue the study.  
8.4.1 Safety Laboratory Assessments  
At Visits 2 and 4, a whole blood sample  of approximately 6  mL will be drawn from the first 
50% of participants of each age/dose group for the following laboratory assessments: 
Hematology: complete blood count with differential and platelet count; Chemistry/metabolic 
panel: Sodium, Potassium, ALT, A ST, Alkaline Phosphatase, total bilirubin, creatinine, and 
BUN . 
The post-vaccination clinical safety laboratory assessments will be performed by a central 
laboratory as detailed in the Laboratory Manual.  See Section  10.3 for the FDA Toxicity 
Grading Scale. See Section  10.4 for management of participants with abnormal laboratory 
values.  
8.4.2 Study Holding Rules and Safety Monitoring  
8.4.2.1  Internal Safety Review Committee  
The study will also include 2 planned iSRC reviews. The iSRC reviews will occur after the 
safety data for the 7 days post dose 1 of the first 50 participants have been recorded  and are  
available.  The second  iSRC  review  will occur  after the first 50 participants have completed 
7 days post  dose 2 , and the safety data is available . 
Enrollment  will be capped  to 20 participants  per day until the iSRC reviews  have  been 
completed. Following iSRC  recommendation, the enrollment will be opened with no 
limitations.  
8.4.2.2  Study Holding Rules  
Holding rules in Table 6 will be assessed by each investigator on a continuous basis. Meeting 
any of these holding rules will trigger a hold of vaccin ation irrespective of number of 
participants enrolled and/or timing of the event.  
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol  219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
47 Of note, no formal holding rules will be applied for other safety data. However, if available, 
these data will also be reviewed in order to allow an overall assessment of the  benefit/risk 
ratio of vaccination.  
If any investigator becomes aware of a holding rule being met, he/she will suspend 
vaccination and inform the medical monitor immediately.

8.5 Adverse Events , Serious Adverse Events, and Other Safety Reporting  
The definitions of AEs and SAEs can be found in Section  10.5. 
The definitions of unsolicited and solicited event s can be found in Section  10.5.1 . 
Adverse event s will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, 
surrogate).  
The investigat or and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for 
following up all AEs until the event has resolved, subsided, stabilized, disappeared, or unt il 
the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up, irrespective of 
seriousness or relatedness (see Section 7.0). 
This includes events reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, 
surrogate).  
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section 10.5 and 
10.5.3 .

protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to a 
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol  219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
48 GSK product (non -IMP) will be recorded from the time a participant consents to participate in 
the study.  
All SAEs  (not related to study participation) , pIMDs, medically att ended adverse events 
(MAEs ), and pregnancies  will be collected from the start of study intervention  until 6 months 
after the last vaccination  at the time  points specified in the SoA (Section  1.3). 
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study intervention but after obtaining 
informed consent will be recorded as medical history/current medical conditions, not as AEs.  
All SA Es and pIMDs  (pIMDs can be  serious or non -serious ) will be recorded and reported to 
the Sponsor  or designee immediately and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours  
of the investigator’s awareness of the event, as indicated in Section 10.5.5 . The investigator 
will submit any updated SAE  or pIMD  data to the Sponsor or designee within 24  hours of 
their awareness of the updated infor mation . 
All unsolicited AEs that occur within 21 days following administration of each dose of study 
intervention and MAEs that occur at any time during the study  must be recorded onto the 
appropriate section of the eCRF, irrespective of their intensity or  whether or not they are 
considered related to the study intervention.  
All solicited events that occur within 7 days following administration of each dose of study 
intervention must be recorded into the diary, irrespective of intensity. All other AEs occu rring 
within this time frame should be recorded on the appropriate section of the eCRF, irrespective 
of their intensity or whether or not they are considered related to the study intervention.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek information o n AEs or SAEs after conclusion 
of the study participation . However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at 
any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the 
event /cause of death  to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, 
the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor  or designee . 
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the 
procedures for completing and tran smitting safety  reports are provided in  Section s 10.5.3  and

CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol  219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
50 8.5.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE 
occurrences.  
Participants must be made aware of the requirement to report any new medical condition or 
worsening of any pre -existing medical condition requiring contact with a healthcare 
professional to the site staff.  
8.5.2.1  Clinically Significant Abnormal Laboratory Findings  
Post-vaccination c linical laboratory measurements (Section 8.4.1 ) are scheduled for the first 
50% of participants enrolled in each age /dose group. These  laboratory measurements  may also 
be performed , and the results obtained as part of  critical care or fol low-up due to the 
occurrence of MAEs, SAEs, or pIMDs during the study.  
The investigator must review the laboratory report, document that he/she did so, and  record 
any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the eCRF. Clinically  significan t 
abnormal laboratory findings are those which are associated with an  underlying disease 
judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the  participant's condition.  
These results  should be reported as an AE, MAE, SAE , or Adverse Events of Special Interest 
(AESI ) as applicable for the study.  
See Section  10.3 for the FDA Toxicity Grading Sc ale and Section  10.4 for the management of 
participants with abnormal laboratory values.  
 
8.5.3 Treatment of Adverse Events  
Any medication administered for the treatment of an SAE/pIMD should be recorded in the 
Expedited Adverse Events report of the participant’s eCRF screen.  
8.5.4 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs (Section 10.5) will be followed until 
resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up 
(as defined in Section 7.3). Further information on follow -up procedures is provided in 
Section  10.5. 
8.5.5 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  and Other Events  
Prompt notification by the investigator to the Sponsor  of an SAE or pIMD is essential so that 
legal obligations and ethical responsibilities toward the safety of participants and the safety of 
a study intervention under clinical investiga tion are met.  
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol  219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
51 The Sponsor  has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor  will comply with country -specific regulatory  requirements relating to safety reporting 
to the regulatory authority , IRBs/IECs , and investigators.  
For SAEs and pIMDs, the investigator must always provide an assessment of causality at the 
time of the initial report, as defined in the Section 10.5.3 . 
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific 
safety information ( e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor  will review and then 
file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local 
requirements.

‡ Paper AEs report may be submitted in the case that the electronic system is not functioning. The paper report 
will be dated and signed by the investigator (or designee) . For each SAE/pIMD, the investigator(s) must 
document in the medical notes that they have reviewed the SAE/pIMD  and have provided an assessment of 
causality.  
‡‡ The investigator will be required to confirm review of the SAE/pIMD causality by ticking the ‘reviewed’ box 
in the electronic Expedited Adverse Events Report within 72 hours of submission of the SAE/pIMD.  
 
8.5.6 Pregnancy  
Details of all pregnancies in  study participants will be collected after the start of study 
intervention and until the outcome of the pregnancy is known . Female participants who 
become pregnant after the first study intervention dose must not receive the s econd dose of the 
study intervention but may continue other study procedures at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol  219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
52 If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the 
appropriate form and submit it to  the Sponsor  or desig nee within 24 hours  of learning of the 
participant’s  pregnancy  and should follow the procedures outlined in Section  10.5.3  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported as an AE or SAE.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE ( i.e., 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [including if found in 
an aborted fetus, stillbirth, or neonatal death ]) the investigator will report according to the 
SAE reporting procedures described in Section 10.5.5 . 
The participant  will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The investigator 
will collect follow -up information on the participant  and t he neonate and the information will 
be forwarded to the Sponsor  or designee . 
Any post -study  pregnancy -related SAE considered reasonably related to the study intervention 
by the investigator will be reported to the Sponsor  as described in Section  8.5.5 . While the 
investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study participants , he 
or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.  
8.5.7 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
8.5.7.1  Potential Immune -Mediated Diseases  
Potenti al immune -mediated diseases are a subset of AESIs that include autoimmune diseases 
and other inflammatory and/or neurologic disorders of interest which may or may not have an 
autoimmune etiology. A dverse event s that need to be recorded and reported as pIMD s include 
those listed in  Table 16 and must be reported in  an expedited manner regardless of causality, 
seriousness, or medical opinion on etiology .  
The investigator(s) must exercise their medical/scientific judgment to determine whether other 
diseases have an autoimmune origin ( i.e., pathophysiology involving systemic or 
organ -specific pathogenic autoantibodies) and should also be recorded as a pIMD. In addition, 
the investigator  should categorize each pIMD as a new onset condition (if it start ed following 
vaccination) in the eCRF.

Amendment 3.0 
 
53  
8.5.8 Participant Card  
The investigator (or designee) must provide the participant/participant’s caregiver(s) with a 
“participant card” containing information about the clinical study. The 
participant/participant’s caregi ver(s) must be instructed to always keep the participant card in 
their possession for the duration of the study. In an emergency, this card serves to inform the 
responsible attending physician/caregiver/family member that the participant is in a clinical 
study and that relevant information may be obtained by contacting the investigator(s) or their 
back -up.

54 9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)  will be finalized prior to  first subject  first visit ( FSFV). 
9.1 Statistical Hypotheses  
The null hypotheses for vaccine -homologous HI titer at Day 43 in 18  to 64 years age or in 
65 years of age or above) are:  
for 18  to 64 years of age: H0 1: seroprotection rate ( SPR) < 70%  
for 65 years of age or abo ve: H0 2: SPR < 60%  
Null hypotheses will be assessed according to a hierarchical order of study groups as given 
below.  
1. 7.5 mcg antigen + AS03A  
2. 7.5 mcg antigen + AS03B  
3. 3.75 mcg antigen + AS03A  
4. 3.75 mcg antigen + AS03B  
No multiplicity adjustment is required  as the hypothesis for each study group will be tested if 
the success criteria will be met for the previous group in the hierarchy. Accordingly, a 
nominal type I error of  2.5% will be used for each dose group and the objective will be met 
for one dose group if all 2 null hypotheses are rejected simultaneously.  
Criteria for success to be met simultaneously  for a study group : 
• The lower limit ( LL) of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the SPR meets or exceeds 
70% for adults of 18  to 64 years of age.  
• The LL of the 95% CI for the SPR meets or exceeds 60% for adults ≥65 years of age.  
9.2 Sample Size Determination  
A total of 520 participants  are planned  to be enrolled,  with 65 participants  per age subgroup  in 
each of the 4 dose groups.  
A non -evaluable rate of  23% and 30% in 18 to 64 years of age and ≥65 years of age groups, 
respectively yield an approximate sample size of 95 evaluable participants per dose group 
(i.e., 50 participants between 18  to 64 years of age and  45 participants  above 65 years  of age 
in each dose group),  giving  77.8% overall  power to fulfil l the 2 SPR immunogenicity criteria 
in any in the first group that is 7.5  mcg antigen + AS03A . This assumes that the SPR are truly 
20% higher than the critical value (namely 90% for participants 18 to 64  years of age and 80% 
for participants ≥65  years of age, respectively).  
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol 219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
55 The statistical power in 7.5  mcg antigen + AS03A group will be 91.4% if the SPR is assumed 
as 85% in ≥65 years of age.

56 9.3.1 Criteria for Elimination from Analysis  
All c onditions leading to full or partial data elimination of a participant for the per protocol set 
(PPS) analysis will be classified as m ajor protocol deviations . These conditions are already 
mentioned in the PPS definition and will be further detailed in the  SAP and the Study 
Deviation Rules document which  will be finalized prior to the interim analysis defined in 
Section 9.5. 
Key major deviations include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Participants enrolled who did not meet eligibility criteria  
• Participants incorrectly vaccinated  
• Participants who did not  receive study vaccinations as planned in protocol  
• Participants who did not have serological blood draws as planned in protocol  
• Participants with a blood draw outside of allowed time window  
• Participants with a vaccination done outside of allowed time window . These key major 
deviations will be assessed based on the data collected in the eCRFs.  
• Occurrence of immunosuppressive or immunodeficient conditions before a blood draw 
visit. 
9.4 Statistical Analyses  
The SAP will be developed and finalized before FSFV and will include a more technical and 
detailed description of the statistical analyses including the supportive analyses and 
demographic  summaries. This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the 
primary and secondary endpoints.  
9.4.1 Genera l Considerations  
All analyses will be provided separately for each age subgroup.  
Derived and transformed data:  
• Immunogenicity at a visit (Note: The lower limit of quantitation ( LLOQ ) is defined by the 
laboratory before the analysis and will be specified in  the clinical study report).  
o A seronegative participant is a participant whose titer is below the LLOQ . 
o A seropositive participant is a participant whose titer is greater than or equal to the 
LLOQ . 
o Seroprotection is defined as an HI titer ≥1:40.  
o SPR is defined as the percentage of participants with an HI titer ≥1:40.  
o HI seroconversion is defined as a post -vaccination titer ≥1:40 in the serum of 
participants with pre -vaccination titer below 1:10 or as a ≥4-fold rise in 
post-vaccination HI titer with pre -vaccination titer ≥1:10.  
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol 219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
57 o SCR is defined as the percentage of participants who seroconvert post -vaccination.  
o MN v accine response  (VR)  is defined as titer ≥4× LLOQ for participants with

and GMFR  CIs will be derived from an Analysis of C ovariance ( ANCOVA ) model on 
log-transformed titer. The model will include the dose group effect ( i.e., 4 dose groups), as  a 
fixed effect and the log -transform ed titer pre -dose 1 (Day 1) as a covariable.  
SPR at Day 43  will be calculated for each study group  for vaccine -homologous H5N8 HI titer 
along with Clopper -Pearson exact two -sided 98.75% CIs . 
9.4.3.2  Safety  
The analysis of reactogenicity will be based on the DS while the analysis of other safety 
endpoints such as  unsolicited events will be based on the ES. The following analysis will be 
generated for each vaccine group.  
Solicited administration site and syste mic endpoints  
The following summaries will be generated for any grade  (Table 13), grade ≥2, grade ≥3, 
medically attended, ongoing after day 7 :  
• Occurre nce of at least one  solicited administration site event during a 7 -day follow -up 
period ( i.e., day of vaccination and 6  subsequent days ) after each vaccination  and overall.   
• Occurrence of at least one solicited systemic event during a 7 -day follow -up perio d (i.e., 
day of vaccination and 6  subsequent days ) after each vaccination and overall .  
• Duration of each solicited AE starting on the day of vaccination or on one of the 
6 subsequent days  will be summarized after each vaccination and overall . 
Frequencies and percentages of participants experiencing each event will be presented for 
each vaccination and across vaccinations with Clopper -Pearson exact 95% CIs.  
If a solicited event occurs more than once for a participant, it will be counted in the s ummary 
only once for each level of summarization, according to the maximal severity.  
Laboratory endpoints  
The percentage of participants with an increase in laboratory toxicity grading after each 
vaccination and across vaccinations will be provided with C lopper -Pearson exact 95% CIs.

analysis will provide treatment -level unblinded summaries for GSK, and BARDA, and no 
individual unblinding data will be provided. The details of the interim analysis are provided  in 
Section 9.5.1  and will be fully detailed in the SAP . 
9.5.1 Sequence of Analyses  
9.5.1.1  Interim Safety Analysis at Day 43  
An analysis will be performed on data collected through the Day 43 visit. Elements will 
include:  
• Analyses of cleaned solicited administration site events and solicited systemic events 
data collected during a 7 -day follow -up period ( i.e., day of vaccination and 
6 subsequent days ) after each vaccination . 
• Analyses of unsolicited AEs reported up to the Da y 43 visit ( i.e., day of vaccination 
and 20 subsequent days after each vaccine) and cleaned in so far as is possible.  
• Analyses of SAEs, pIMDs, MAEs, pregnancies , and withdrawals due to AEs, collected 
up to the Day 43 visit.  
• No study report will be prepared . Access to individual treatment codes will be 
restricted to the designated statisticians in charge of the analysis. No individual listings 
or data with the participants’ identifying information will be disseminated. Listings of 
final data will be provided  with the EOS report.  
9.5.1.2  Interim Immunogenicity Analysis at Day 43  
An analysis will be performed on data collected through the Day 43 visit. Elements will 
include:  
• Analyses of cleaned immunogenicity data, for analysis of vaccine -homologous HI 
antibody titers and MN titers, collected through the Day 43 visit.  
• Results will be presented in a Day 43 statistical report. Access to individual treatment 
codes will be restricted to the designated statisticians in charge of the analysis. No 
individual listings or data with the participants’ identifying information will be 
disseminated. Listings of final data will be provided with the EOS report.  
All analyses will be performed on data that has been cleaned and locked. The possibility of 
post-analysis changes to data  evaluated at Day 43 exists, since data collection and data entry 
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol 219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
62 may continue through 6 months post  dose 2 . All final data will be presented in the listings 
provided at 6 months post  dose 2 . 
9.5.1.3  Final Analysis ( 6 Month s Post Dose 2 ) 
A final data analysis will  be performed at the EOS  (6 months post  dose 2 ) of all primary and 
secondary endpoints based on the clean data, including evaluations of:  
• Immunogenicity at all measured time points.  
• Solicited administration site events and solicited systemic events data re ported within 
7 days after each vaccination ( day of vaccination and 6 subsequent days following each 
vaccination ). 
• Unsolicited AEs reported up to the Day 43 visit ( day of vaccination and 
20 subsequent  days after each vaccination).  
• Concomitant medications reported up to the Day 43 visit.  
• SAEs, pIMDs, MAEs, and withdrawals due to AEs collected throughout the entire study.  
• Pregnancies throughout the entire study. An integrated clinical study report containing all 
data will be written and made avai lable to the investigators.  
9.5.2 Statistical Consideration for Interim Analysis  
Since the primary endpoints for the study will be complete by the Day  43 visit (collection past 
Day 43 includes only assessments for SAEs, pIMDs , MAEs, and immunogenicity at 6 month s 
post dose 2 ), no statistical consideration for multiplicity will be given to account for changes 
in the results reported at the interim analysis compared to the final analysis. For the primary 
immunogenicity analysis, which will be reported at Day 43 the  overall type I error rate is fixed 
at 2.5% and a Bonferroni adjustment will be applied to allow simultaneous multiple 
comparisons of each antigen/adjuvant group  leading to 0.625% nominal type I error . For the 
primary safety analyses no adjustment for mult iple comparisons will be made in each 
antigen/adjuvant group.

70 10.2 Appendix 2: Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Hemagglutination  Inhibition Assay  
Hemagglutination inhibition titers are determined using the method derived from the WHO 
Manual on Animal Influenza Diagnosis and Surveillance, WH O/CDS/CSR/NCS/2002.5.  
Measurements are conducted on thawed frozen serum samples with a standardized and 
comprehensively validated micromethod. The standard operating procedure describes a HI test 
for detecting H 5N8 influenza A specific responses, such as t hose following influenza virus 
vaccinations. Briefly, serum samples are first adsorbed with RBCs to remove non -specific 
agglutinins and then  treated with receptor destroying enzyme overnight  to remove 
non-specific inhibitors of the hemagglutination , then diluted to 1:10, and serial diluted 2 -fold 
in duplicate from 1:10 to 1:10240. After addition of an equal volume of standardized virus 
(4 HAU/25 μL), antibodies that inhibit virus -mediated hemagglutination react with the virus 
for 1 hour at room temperature,  and then horse  red blood cells  (RBCs ) are added to the 
mixture . Plates are tilted and the titer is the reciprocal of the last dilution that fully inhibits 
hemagglutination as compared to a red blood cell control well. Each serum sample will be 
tested in duplicate within the same assay. The final result corresponds to th e GMT for the 
duplicate . 
Microneutralization Assay  
Microneutralization  titers are determined using the method derived from the WHO Manual for 
the laboratory diagnosis and virological surveillance of influenza .21 
Measurements are conducted on thawed frozen serum samples. Samples are heat -inactivated 
at 56°C. A standardized amount of virus is mixed with serial dilutions of serum and incubated  
at 37°C to allow binding of the antibodies to the virus. A cell suspension containing a def ined 
amount of Madin -Darby Canine Kidney cells is then added to the mixture of virus and 
antiserum and incubated  at 37°C . After overnight incubation, plates are fixed and the amount 
of virus per well is detected by enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay using a nti-nucleoprotein 
monoclonal antibodies. The virus neutralizing titer is determined using a formula that 
calculates the midpoint optical density of uninfected cells and virus infected (without 
neutralization) cells.

Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting  for Study 
Intervention  
10.5.1  Definition of AE  
AE Definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally 
associated with the use of a study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study 
intervention.  
NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with 
the use of a study intervention.  
 
Definition of Unsolicited  AEs, MAEs,  and Solicited Event s 
• An unsolicited AE is an AE that was not otherwise solicited in a participant diary and that is 
communicated by a participant/participant’s caregiver (s) who has signed the informed 
consent. Unsolicited AEs include serious and non -serious AEs.  
• An unsolicited AE is an AE that was eith er not included in the list of solicited events or 
could be included in the list of solicited events but with an onset outside the specified period 
of follow -up for solicited events. Unsolicited AEs must have been communicated by 
[participants/ participant ’s caregiver(s)] who has signed the informed consent. Unsolicited 
AEs include both serious and non -serious AEs.  
• Potential unsolicited AEs may be medically attended ( i.e., symptoms or illnesses requiring a 
hospitalization, emergency room visit, or visit to/by a healthcare provider). The 
participant/participant’s caregiver(s)  will be instructed to contact the study site as soon as 
possible to report MAEs , as well as any even ts that, though not medically attended, are of 
participant/participant’s caregiver(s)  concern. Detailed information about reported 
unsolicited AEs will be collected by qualified study site personnel and documented in the 
participant’s records.  
• Unsolicited AEs that are not medically attended nor perceived as a concern by the 
participant/participant’s caregiver(s)  will be collected during an interview with the 
participant/participant’s caregiver(s)  and by review of available medical records at the  next 
visit.  
• Solicited events  are predefined administration  site and systemic events for which the 
participant is specifically questioned, and which are noted by the participant in their diary.  
• Solicited Administration Site Events

Events Meeting the AE Definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other 
safety assessments ( e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those 
that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific 
judgment of the investigator ( i.e., not related to progression of underlying d isease) . 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition . 
• New condition detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study . 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected intervention -intervention 
interaction . 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medicatio n. Overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent. 
Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.  
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol 219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
77 • Significant failure of an expected pharmacologic or biolog ical action.  
• Events that occur as a result of protocol -mandated procedures ( i.e., invasive procedures, 
modification of participant’s previous therapeutic regimen).  
 
Events NOT  Meeting the AE D efinition  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments 
that are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more 
severe than expected for the participant’s condition . 
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected prog ression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s 
condition . 
• Medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE . 
• An elec tive surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an 
AE if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and the 
surgery/procedure has been pre -planned prior to study entry. However, if the pre -existing  
condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study ( e.g., surgery performed earlier than 
planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is 
being done will be considered an AE.   
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital, admission for routine examination.).  
• Anticipated day -to-day- fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen . Pre-existing diseases will be recorded in 
the medical history section of the eCRF.  
• Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition (known or diagnosed before 
signing the informed consent) that did not worsen from baseline.  
10.5.2  Definition of SAE  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, meets one or more 
of the criteria listed:  
a. Results in death  
• For SAEs with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be recorded on the 
appropriate CRF . 
b. Is life -threatening  
• The term life-threatening  in the definition of serious  refers to an event in which the participant 
was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically 
might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
c. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing  hospitalization  
• In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been admitted  (usually involving at 
least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment 
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol 219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
78 that would not have been appropriate in the phys ician’s office or outpatient setting. 
Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs 
hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to 
whether hospitalization occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
• Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE . 
d. Results in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity  
• The term disabilit y means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions.  
• This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance 
such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle) that may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not 
constitute a substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• The term congenital anomaly/birth defect means there is suspect that exposure to a medical 
product prior to conception or during pregnancy may have resulted in an adverse outcome in 
the child.  
f. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes ( e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) . 
g. Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via an authori zed medicinal product . 
h. Other situations:  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised by the  investigator in deciding whether 
SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as significant medical events that may 
jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the abo ve definition. These events should usually be considered 
serious.  
o Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias,  convulsions or development of intervention 
dependency or inter vention abuse.  
10.5.3  Recording and Follow -Up of AE , SAE , and/or pIMD  
AE, SAE , and pIMD  Recording  
• When an AE/SAE /pIMD  occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation ( e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event.  
• The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE /pIMD  information  in the eCRF . 
• It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical 
records to the Sponsor or designee  in lieu of completion of the applicable/required report 
form.  
• There may be instances when copies of medical records for c ertain cases are requested by the 
Sponsor or designee. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the 
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol 219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
79 participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to 
the Sponsor or designee.  
• The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual 
signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
10.5.3.1  Assessment of Intensity and Causality  
Assessment of Intensity  
The intensity of the following solicited AEs will be assessed as described:  
Table 13 Intensity Scales for Solicited Events in Adults 18 Years of Age or Older  
Adults (18 years)  
Event  Intensity grade  Parameter

Redness at administration site  Record greatest surface diameter in mm  
Swelling at administration site  Record greatest surface diameter in mm  
Temperature   Record temperature in °C/°F . Oral route is preferred . 
 
The maximum intensity of local injection site redness/swelling will be scored as follows:  
0: ≤20 mm  
1: >20 to 50 mm  
2: >50 to 100 mm  
3: >100 mm  
The maximum intensity of fever will be scored as follows:  
0: <38.0°C (<100.4°F)  
1: ≥38.0 – 38.4°C (≥100.4 – 101.2°F)  
2: ≥38.5 – 38.9°C (≥101.3 – 102.1°F)  
3: ≥39.0 – 40.0°C (≥102.2 – 104.0°F)  
4: >40.0°C (>104.0°F)  
The investigator will assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the event for 
all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded d uring the study. The assessment will be based on 
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol 219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
81 the investigator’s clinical judgement.  
The following definitions are to be used to rate the severity of an AE:  
• Mild: A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily 
living . 
• Moderate:  A type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but 
poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research participant.  
• Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may require i ntensive therapeutic intervention . 
An AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with an SAE. Grade 3 is a 
category used for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as 
Grade  3. An event is defined as ‘ser ious’ when it meets 1 of the predefined outcomes as described 
in the Section 10.5.2 . 
Assessment of Causality  
• The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE /pIMD . The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine 
the relationship.  
• A reasonable possibility  of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, 
as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration, will be 
considered and investigated.  
• For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being related 
to study intervention  will be consider ed "related." Events assessed as having no reasonable 
possibility of being related to study intervention will be considered "unrelated."  
• The investigator will also consult the IB and/or product information, for marketed products, in 
his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE /pIMD , the investigator must  document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE /pIMD  and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information t o include in the initial report to the Sponsor or designee . However, it is very 
important that the investigator always make s an assessment of causality for every event before 
the initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor or designee . 
• The investig ator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and 
send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.  
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol 219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
82 Causality should be assessed by the investigator using the following question:  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the unsolicited AE may have been caused by the study 
vaccine/product?  
YES  : There is a reasonable possibility that the study vaccine/product contributed to 
the AE.  
NO : There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is causally related to the 
administration of the study vaccine/product. There are other, more likely 
causes and administration of the study vaccine/product is not suspected to 
have contributed to the AE.  
If an event meets the criteria to be determined as ‘serious’ (see Section 10.5.2 ), additional 
examinations/tests will be performed by the investigator to determine ALL possible contributing 
factors for each SAE.  
Possible contributing factors include:  
• Medical history.  
• Other medication.  
• Protocol required proced ure. 
• Other procedure not required by the protocol.  
• Erroneous administration.  
• Other cause (specify).  
Assessment of Outcomes  
The investigator will assess the outcome of all serious and non -serious unsolicited AEs recorded during the 
study as:  
• Recovered/resolved  
• Recovering/resolving  
• Not recovered/not resolved  
• Recovered with sequelae/resolved with sequelae  
• Fatal (SAEs only).  
 
Follow -up of AEs , SAEs , or pIMDs  
• The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by the Sponsor or 
designee to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE , SAE , or pIMD  as fully as possible. 
This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, 
or consultation with other health care professionals.  
• If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized foll ow-up period, 
the investigator will provide the Sponsor or designee  with a copy of any postmortem findings 
including histopathology.  
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol 219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
83 • New or updated information will be recorded in the originally submitted documents.  
• The investigator will submit any updated  SAE and/or pIMD data to the Sponsor or designee 
within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the information.  
• After the initial AE/SAE/ pIMD/ pregnancy  or any other event of interest, the investigator is 
required to proactively follow each participant  at subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs will be 
followed until the event is resolved, subsided, stabilized, disappeared, otherwise explained, or 
the participant is lost to follow -up, irrespective of seriousness or relatedness . 
Follow -up during the study  
• AEs/ pIMD s documented at a previous visit/contact and defined as not recovered/not resolved 
or recovering/resolving will be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts until resolved, subsided, 
stabilized, disappeared, otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up. 
• If a participant dies during their participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up 
period, GSK will be provided with any available postmortem findings, including 
histopathology.  
Follow -up of pregnancies  
• Pregnant participants will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. At the end 
of the pregnancy, whether full -term or premature, information on the status of the mother and 
child will be forwarded to GSK using the electronic pregnancy report and the AE Report if 
applicable. Generally, the follow -up period does not need to be longer than 6 to 8 weeks after 
the estimated date of delivery.  
• Regardless of the reporting period for SAEs in this study, if the pregnancy outcome is an SAE, 
it should always be reported as suc h. 
• Furthermore, the investigator must report any SAE occurring as a result of a post -study 
pregnancy that is considered by the investigator to be reasonably related to the study 
intervention, to GSK as described in the Section 10.5.4 . 
10.5.4  Updating of SAE, pIMD, and Pregnancy Information after Removal of Write 
Access to the Participant’s eCRF  
Updating SA Es, pIMDs, and/or pregnancies after removal of write access to participant’s 
eCRF  
• When additional SAE, pIMD, or pregnancy information is received after write access to the 
participant’s eCRF is removed, new or updated information should be recorded on the 
appropriate paper report, with all changes signed and dated by the investigator.  The updated 
report should be sent to the Sponsor or designee.  
 
10.5.5  Reporting of SAEs  
SAE Reporting to the Sponsor or Designee via an Electronic Data Collection System  
• The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to the Sponsor or designee will be the 
electronic data collection system. The study site will enter the event into the electronic data 
collection system within 24 hours of  the investigator’s awareness of the event.  
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol 219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
84 • If the electronic system is unavailable, then the study site will use the paper SAE report form 
(see next section) to report the event and will enter the event into the electronic data 
collection system as soon as the system becomes available.  
• After the study is completed at a given  study  site, the electronic data collection system will be 
taken offline to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
• If a study site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated 
data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection system has been taken 
offline, then the study site can report this information on a paper SAE report for m (see next 
section) to the Sponsor or designee.  
• If the site during the course of the study or post -study  becomes aware of any serious, 
non-serious AEs, pregnancy exposure, related to any GSK non -IMP they will report these 
events to GSK or to the concerned  competent authority via the national spontaneous reporting 
system.  These will be classified as spontaneous individual case safety reports . 
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in study materials . 
 
SAE Reporting to the Sponsor or Designee via Paper SAE  Report Form  
• The back -up mechanism for reporting an SAE to the Sponsor or designee will be the paper 
SAE report form. The study site will submit the SAE report form, via email, within 24 hours 
of the investigator’s awareness of the event. Facsimile transmission may be utilized as an 
alternative mode of submission, if necessary.  
• Notification of SAE information via telephone does not  replace the need for the investigator 
to complete, sign and submit the paper SAE report form to the Sponsor or designee within 
24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the event.  
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in  study materials .

10.6.1  Definitions  
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
perman ently sterile (see below).  
Women in the Following Categories Are Not Considered WOCBP  
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
a) Documented hysterectomy.  
b) Documented bilateral salpingectomy.  
c) Documented bilateral oophorectomy.  
For permanently sterile individuals due to an alternate medical cause other than the above, 
(e.g., Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity, gonadal dysgenesis), investigator discretion 
should be applied to determining study entry. If reproductive status is questionable, additional 
evaluation should be considered.  
NOTE : Documentation can come from the study site personnel’s: review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
3. Postmenopausal female:  
a) A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal 
range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormona l replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 
12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
b) Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 1 of 
the non -estrogen hormonal highly effective contr aception methods if they wish to 
continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.  
10.6.2  Contraception Guidance  
Female Participant s 
Female participant s of childbearin g potential are eligible to participate if they agree to use a 
highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly as described in the table 
below.  Female participants of childbearing potential should have practice d effective 
contraception  methods as described below for  2 months prior to the first dose of the study 
vaccine, through  2 months after the second dose of the study vaccine.  
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol 219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
86 Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods  
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependenta  
Failu re rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.  
Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation  
• Oral.  
• Intravaginal.  
• Transdermal.  
Progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
• Oral.  
• Injectable.  
Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independenta  
• Implantable progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
• Intrauterine devic e. 
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system.  
• Bilateral procedural tubal occlusion , such as liga tion. 
Vasectomized partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that the partner is the sole male 
sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly 
effective method of contraception should be u sed.  
Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention . The reliability of sexual 
abstinence ne eds to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle 
of the participant .  
NOTES:  
a Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be 
consistent with local reg ulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participant s participating in 
clinical studies.   
 
Pregnancy Testing:  
• WOCBP should only be included after a confirmed menstrual period and a negative highly 
sensitive urine  pregnancy test.  
• Additional pregnancy testing at times specified in the SoA (Section 1.3) during the 
treatment period.  
Collection of Pregnancy Information  
Female Participants who become pregnant  
• The investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female participant who 
becomes pregnant while participating in this study. Information will be recorded on the 
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol 219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
87 appropriate form and submitted to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of learning of a 
participant’s pregnancy. The participant will be followed to determine the outc ome of the 
pregnancy. The investigator will collect follow -up information on the participant and the 
neonate and the information will be forwarded to the Sponsor or designee. Generally, 
follow -up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the  estimated delivery 
date. Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or 
absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication 
will be reported as an AE or SAE. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for 
immediate classification as an SAE ( i.e., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, 
or congenital anomaly [including that in an aborted fetus, stillbirth, or n eonatal death]), the 
investigator will report according to the SAE reporting procedures described in 
Section  10.5. 
• Any post -study  pregnancy -related SAE considered reasonably related to the study 
treatment by the investigator will be reported to the Sponsor or designee as described in 
Section  10.5.3 . While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in 
former participants , he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous repo rting.  
• Any female participant who becomes pregnant after the first study intervention dose must 
not receive the second dose of the study intervention but may continue other study 
procedures at the discretion of the investigator.

Adverse event:  Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation participant, temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to 
the medicinal product.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintende d 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with 
the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal 
products, this also includes failure to produce expected 
benefits ( i.e., lack of e fficacy), abuse or misuse.  
Blinding:  A procedure in which 1 or more parties to the trial are kept 
unaware of the intervention assignment in order to reduce 
the risk of biased study outcomes. The level of blinding is 
maintained throughout the conduct of th e trial, and only 
when the data are cleaned to an acceptable level of quality 
will appropriate personnel be unblinded or when required in 
case of a serious AEs  
In an open -label study, no blind is used. Both the 
investigator and the participant know the id entity of the 
intervention assigned.  
Caregiver:  A ‘caregiver’ is a person who has a continuous caring role 
for a participant or may be a person having substantial 
periods of contact with a participant and/or is engaged in 
his/her daily health care ( e.g., a relative of the participant 
including family members or friends).  
In the context of this study, a caregiver can be appointed by 
the participant to oversee and support the participant’s 
compliance with protocol -specific procedures (such as 
transcribing responses to diaries, receiving phone calls, 
planning study visits, etc.). However, at no time, the 
caregiver should evaluate the participant’s health status 
while answering diaries or make decisions on behalf of the 
participant.  
Eligible:  Qualified for e nrollment into the study based upon strict 
adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol 219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
92 Enrolled participant:  ‘Enrolled’ means a participant’s agreement to participate in 
a clinical study following completion of the informed 
consent process. Potential parti cipants who are screened for 
determining eligibility for the study, but do not participate 
in the study, are not considered enrolled, unless otherwise 
specified by the protocol.  
Refer to the Section 9.3 of the protocol for the definition of 
‘enrolled set’ applicable to the study.   
Evaluable:  Meeting all eligibility criteria, complying with the 
procedures defined in the protocol, and, therefore, inc luded 
in the per  protocol analysis.  
Immunological correlate of 
protection:  A correlate of risk that has been validated to predict a 
certain level of protection from the targeted endpoint.  
Intercurrent medical 
condition:  A condition that has the capability of altering the immune 
response to the study vaccine or is confirmed to have an 
alteration of the participant’s initial immune status.  
Intervention number:  A number identifying an intervention to a participant, 
according to intervention allocat ion. 
Intervention:  Term used throughout the clinical study to denote a set of 
investigational product(s) or marketed product(s) or 
placebo intended to be administered to a participant.  
Investigator:  A person responsible for the conduct of the clinical tr ial at a 
trial site. If a trial is conducted by a team of individuals at a 
trial site, the investigator is the responsible leader of the 
team and may be called the Principal Investigator.   
The investigator can delegate trial -related duties and 
functions conducted at the trial site to qualified individual 
or party to perform those trial -related duties and functions.  
Participant number:  A unique identification number assigned to each participant 
who consents to participate in the study.  
Particip ant: Term used throughout the protocol to denote an individual 
who has been contacted to participate or who participates in 
the clinical study as a recipient of the study intervention 
(vaccine(s)/product(s)/control).  
Synonym: subject.  
Protocol amendment:  The International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) defines 
a protocol amendment as: ‘A written description of a 
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol 219833  
Amendment 3.0 
 
93 change(s) to or formal clarification of a protocol.’ GSK 
further details this to include a change to an approved 
protocol that affects the safety of participants, scope of the 
investigation, study design, or scientific integrity of the 
study.  
Randomization:  Process of random attribution of intervention to participants 
to reduce selection bias.  
Site Monitor:  An individual assigned by the  Sponsor and responsible for 
assuring proper conduct of clinical studies at 1 or more 
investigational sites.  
Solicited event:  Events to be recorded as endpoints in the clinical study. The 
presence/occurrence/intensity of these events is actively 
solicited  from the participant or an observer during a 
specified follow -up period following study intervention 
administration.  
Source data:  All information in original records and certified copies of 
original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction 
and evaluation of the trial. Source data are contained in 
source documents (original records or certified copies).  
Source documents:  Original legible documents, data, and records ( e.g., hospita l 
records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, 
memoranda, participants' diaries or evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from 
automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified 
after verification as being accura te copies, microfiches, 
photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -
rays, participant files, and records kept at the pharmacy, 
laboratories and at medico -technical departments involved 
in the clinical trial).  
Study intervention:  Any investigati onal or marketed product(s) or placebo 
intended to be administered to a participant during the 
study.  
Unsolicited adverse event:  Any AE reported in addition to those solicited during the 
clinical study. Also, any ‘solicited’ symptom with onset 
outside the specified period of follow -up for solicited 
symptoms will be reported as an unsolicited adverse event.

110 Amendment 2.0 : 22 August 2023  
Overall Rationale for the Amendment 2 .0: 
This protocol ha s been amended to replace the table titled ‘List of potential Immune -Mediated 
Diseases (pIMDs)’ with an entire listing of pIMD terms, based on the GSK MedDRA query 
listing, as requested by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  
Added text in bold ital ic, deleted text in strikethrough .  
Section # and Name  Description of Changes from 
Amendment 1 .0 to Amendment 2 .0 Brief Rationale  
8.5.7.1 Potential Immune -
Mediated Diseases  Moved pIMD table to Appendix 8  To improve flow and readability as the 
pIMD table length has increased . 
9.3 Analysis Sets  Updated text in Table 9 Analysis 
Sets:  
• Results from a serological 
blood sample occurred after 
intercurrent conditions that may 
interfere with immunogenicity 
(i.e., immunosuppressive, or 
immunodeficient conditions , or 
malignancy ) or after a 
prohibited concomitant 
medication/vaccination  
 To impr ove clarity for investigator . 
9.4.5 Demography and 
Baseline Characteristic 
Analysis  Edited text:  
Demographic characteristics (age, 
gender, race, center, country, 
ethnicity, and occupation) will be 
tabulated per study group for each 
analysis set  ES and PPS , as 
described in the SAP.  Clarification  
10.1.7 Committees 
Structure  A SRT is in place for each GSK 
product. It comprises of a global 
cross -functional team responsible 
for the ongoing assessment of 
benefit -risk for a product. The SRT 
contribute to the con tinual 
assessment of incoming new 
efficacy and safety information.  Added GSK SRT template text . 
10.5.3.1 Assessment of 
Intensity and Causality  Deleted text in possible contributing 
factor for SAE:  
Lack of efficacy of the 
vaccine/product, if applicable  Removed text as efficacy assessment is 
not a primary objective .

Guidance  
Highly Effective 
Contraceptive Methods 
That Are User Dependent  Updated text:  
Bilateral procedural  tubal occlusion , 
such as ligation   Clarification

Amendment 3.0 
 
111 Section # and Name  Description of Changes from 
Amendment 1 .0 to Amendment 2 .0 Brief Rationale  
 Deleted footnote and corresponding 
superscript ‘b’:  
b Hormonal contraception may be 
susceptible to interaction with the 
study intervention, which may 
reduce the efficacy of the 
contraceptive method. In this case, 2 
highly effective methods of 
contraception should be utilized 
during the treatment period and for at 
least 2 months  after the last dose of 
study intervention.  The AS03 adjuvanted pandemic 
influenza vaccines have not been 
associated with reduced efficacy of 
hormonal contraception .  
10.8 Appendix 8: List of 
Potential Immune -
Medicated Disease  Added Appendix 8 and Table 16 
GSK List of pIMDs MedDRA Terms  To meet FDA request .

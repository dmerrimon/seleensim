Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 4 of 711.0 INTRODUCTION
This document is a clinical re search protocol and the descri bed study will be  conducted in 
compliance with the IRB approved protocol, as sociated Federal regulations and all applicable 
IRB requirements.
This is a randomized study in patie nts with intermediate/high gra de adult soft tissue sarcoma of
the extremity or chest wall wh ich will utilize a n oral angiogenesis inhibitor versus placebo 
followed by neoadjuvant chemother apy. The primary objective is to use FDG-PET to evaluate 
early response to antiangiogenic therapy with pazopanib. This will be correlated with 
pharmacokinetic analysi s of pazopanib. Standard RECIST response  to therapy will be measured 
and compared with FDG-PET results . The study will provide preli minary data on the relative 
contributions of pazopanib and che motherapy with doxorubicin an d ifosfamide as measured by 
changes in SUV by FDG-PET.  Sec ondary objectives include: analyz ing the safety of sequential 
pazopanib and neoadjuvant  chemotherapy; measuring histologic re sponse at the time of surgery 
as a surrogate marker of outcome ; and evaluating tumor and seru m biomarker response. The 
hypothesis is that the additi on of pazopanib to preoperative ch emotherapy with doxorubicin and 
ifosfamide will increase the overa ll response rate which could u ltimately translate into an 
improvement in outcome f or patients with resectable soft tissue  sarcoma. The results of this 
study will inform the design a nd feasibility of a larger trial which would incor porate pazopanib 
as neoadjuvant therapy.FDG-PET will be performed pre-treatment, after pazopanib, and a fter neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
to provide correlativ e, exploratory pharm acodynamic data on the  anti-tumor effect of adding 
antiangiogenic inhibition to chemo therapy. Biomarker studies will also be performed including 
plasma measurement of VEGF and s oluble VEGFR2 (sVEGFR2). Quanti tative enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for VEGF and sVEGFR2 will be performed on plasma and 
tumor extracts. Plasma will als o be collected for micro RNA.
This is a pilot study to test the hypothesis that antiangiogenic  therapy with pazopanib
will enhance the response rate of front line chemotherapy agent s as measured by radiologic 
response and tumor necrosis. This would provide the  rationale to  undertake a larger Phase II 
trial, randomizing patients to neoadjuvant c hemotherapy with or without pazopanib, with 
progression-free and overall survival as end points.
2.0 BACKGROUND
2.1 Soft Tissue Sarcoma Adjuvant and Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
Soft tissue sarcomas account for  less than 1% of all solid tumo rs in adults. They encompass a 
complex heterogeneous group of tumors likely arising from pluripotential mesenchymal stem cells. Although most patients pres ent with localized disease wh ich allows good local control 
by surgical resection and radi ation, approximately 50% die from  subsequent metastatic 
disease.[1,2]  There is a strong  need to develop new treatments which will improve outcome 
for this group o f patients.
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 5 of 71The role of neoadjuvant and/or a djuvant chemotherapy in adult soft tissue sarcomas is 
controversial.  A 1997 individual  patient meta-analysis publish ed in the Lancet of all 
randomized clinical trial data show ed a significant 10% improve ment in local and distant 
disease free survival at 9.4 years follow-up for patients who r eceived adjuvant chemotherapy 
versus those who underwent surgery alone. The meta-analysis fai led to show a significant 
benefit in terms of overall sur vival[3] but a subgroup analysis suggested that patients with 
extremity sarcomas had a 7% imp rovement in overall survival, wh ich was significant. It is 
possible that the benefits of chemotherapy were underestimated in this meta-analysis since 
patients with low grade lesions who would not be expected to be nefit from chemotherapy 
were included and less than 5% of patients re ceived ifosfamide, which was found to be an 
active agent in soft tissue sarc oma in later studies.  A subsequent Italian Phase III study 
involving 104 patients with high gra de, large (> 5 cm) resectable or recurrent extremity and 
limb girdle sarcomas evaluated a djuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin and ifosfamide versus 
observation.[4]  At 5 years follo w-up there was an absolute ove rall survival benefit of 19% 
favoring the chemotherapy arm w hich was significant. When the study was updated at 90 
months, the intent-to-treat ana lysis no longer showed a statist ically significant overall 
survival benefit.[5]  An updated m eta-analysis which included t he meta-analysis from 1997 
as well as 4 modern studies showe d a significant improvement in  overall survival benefit for 
chemotherapy, with an odds ra tio of 0.56 for anthracycline-ifos famide combination therapy. 
[6]  
The sole randomized trial conduc ted in the neoadjuvant setting showed no survival advantage 
in those patients treated with a doxorubicin/ifos famide based-r egimen versus no 
chemotherapy.[7] However, this tr ial was small and may have bee n underpowered to show a 
survival benefit. In additi on, lower doses of doxorubicin (50 mg/m2) and ifosfamide 
(5/gm/m2) for each cycle were administered, compared to what would now be considered 
optimal dosage of these drugs. There are practical and theore tical advantages to offering neoa djuvant chemotherapy for 
patients with large high-risk ext remity sarcomas.  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy may act in the 
early systemic treatment of mic rometastases and improve outcome  for subgroups of patients. 
In one retrospective study combin ing data from Dana Farber and Memorial Sloan Kettering, 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy wit h doxorubicin and ifosfamide provid ed a disease specific 
survival benefit for patients with tumors larger than 10 cm. [8 ] In some cases neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy can downsize tumo rs and improve resectability. Neo adjuvant chemotherapy 
allows the tumor to be used a s a measure of response in-vivo , by performing imaging studies 
before and after treatment.  Final ly, there is prognostic value  to treatment induced pathologic 
necrosis. A study by Eilber and c olleagues from UCLA utilizing neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
and radiation therapy showed that soft tissue sarcoma patients having 5% or less residual 
viable tumor (at least 95% tumor  necrosis) after therapy at the  time of surgery had a 
significantly lower risk for l ocal recurrence and improved over all survival.[9]
While chemotherapy in adult soft  tissue sarcoma may improve outcome for some patients 
with localized disease, there i s a compelling need to develop b etter control of soft tissue 
sarcoma dissemination by syste mic approaches. Even doxorubicin and ifosfamide, the two 
most active agents in soft tissu e sarcoma, result in frequent tu mor recurrence and progression 
after initial responsiveness.

Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 6 of 712.2 Antiangiogenic Therapy in Sarcoma
Angiogenesis, the growth of new vessels from pre-existing vasculature, is essential for tumor 
progression.  Since the time that tumor angiogenesis was initia lly postulated by Folkman in 
1971, several basic and clinical s tudies have shown that the gr owth, invasion and metastatic 
potential of solid tumors is de pendent on angiogenesis.[10-13] In the past two decades, 
inhibitors of angiogenesis have  been developed for clinical use  and recently have shown 
clinical benefit i n combination with che motherapy [14,15] and a s monotherapy in certain 
solid tumors [16-18].
Soft tissue sarcomas express vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which is a key 
mediator of angiogenesis.[19, 20]  In one study of 115 patients  with soft tissue sarcoma, the 
concentration of VEGF in the tumor tissue was found to be an in dependent prognostic factor 
for disease outcome.[21] Tumors associated with local recurrenc e or metastasis in this study 
showed a significantly higher tissue VEGF concentration than those without either. In 
addition, VEGF blood levels in patie nts with soft tissue sarcom as are elevated compared with 
healthy controls and correlate with outcome. [19,22-24]. Other angiogenic factors such as 
platelet-derived gro wth factor (PDGF) are likely involved in th e pathogenesis of soft tissue 
sarcoma.[25] Thus, there is a ra tionale for targeting angiogene sis in soft tissue sarcoma. 
Recent clinical trials have provided preliminary evidence to su pport this scientif ic rationale. 
Sunitinib malate and sorafeni b, both small molecule inhibitors whose targets include VEGF 
receptors and PDGF receptor, have shown activity in several sof t tissue sarcoma subtypes as 
monotherapy in Phase II studies.[26,27]  
2.3 Pazopanib in Sarcoma
Pazopanib is an oral angiogenesis inhibitor that potently inhib its the tyrosine kinase activity 
of VEGF, platelet-derived growt h factor receptor (PDGFR) and c- KIT. [28,29,30]  In 
murine studies, pazopanib inhibited VEGF-induced VEGFR2 phospho rylation, tumor 
angiogenesis and the growth of hum an tumor xenografts. In a Pha se I study, pazopanib was 
well tolerated which prompted further studies.  Recently, pazopa nib gained FDA approval 
for the treatment of patients wit h advanced renal cell carcinom a based on the results of a 
Phase III trial which demonstrat ed that the agent improved prog ression-free survival and 
tumor response compared with placebo in this population of patients.[31]
Promising results of a Phase II study conducted by the European  Organization for the 
Research and Treatment of Cancer  (EORTC) in advanced soft tissue  sarcoma have been 
published.[32]  In this study 142 pa tients with intermediate- or  high-grade disease received 
pazopanib 800 mg orally daily. The  progression-free rate at 12 w eeks was 44% in 
leiomyosarcoma patients, 49% in synovial sarcoma patients, and 39% in other subtypes, 
which compares favorably with hi storical controls treated with second-line chemotherapy.  
The median duration of response was longer than 1 year. The most common toxicities were 
hype
rtension, fatigue, hypopigmentation, and nausea. Mild myelosuppression and liver 
enzyme elevations were encounter ed. In light of the anti-tumor a ctivity demonstrated in this 
trial, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III trial of pazopanib has been initiated in 
patients with angiogenesis-naïve , metastatic soft tissue sarcom a who had progressive disease 
after several lines of treatment . [57] Results showed a signifi cant improvement in median 
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 7 of 71progression-free survival for  pazopanib versus placebo, 12.6 mo nths versus 10.7 months, 
respectively.
Given the scientific r ationale for combini ng conventional chemo therapy with inhibitors of 
the VEGF receptor pathway [33] we are interested to evaluate further the potentia l benefit of 
adding pazopanib to standard front-line cytotoxic agents that h ave activity in sarcoma, 
doxorubicin and ifosfamide.
2.4 Study Agent - Pazopanib
Pazopanib is a potent and selec tive, orally bioa vailable, adeno sine triphosphate competitive, 
small molecule inhibitor of vasc ular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1, -2, and -
3, platelet-derived growth f actor receptor (PDGFR)- Į-ȕDQGF -KIT tyrosine kinases 
(TKs).[34] In human umbilical ve in endothelial cells (HUVECs), pazopanib inhibited 
VEGF-induced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation and was 3- to 400-fold sele ctive for VEGFRs 
compared to 23 other kinases test ed. Pazopanib showed significan t growth inhibition of a 
variety of human tumor xenograf ts in mice, and also inhibited a ngiogenesis in several 
different models of angiogenesi s.  Because angiogenesis is nece ssary for the growth and 
metastasis of solid tumors, and V EGF is believed to have a pivotal role in this process, 
pazopanib treatment may have broad-spectrum clinical utility.
Mechanism of Action
Pazopanib inhibits VEGFR-1, -2, a nd -3 with concentrations causi ng 50% inhibition (IC 50)
values of 10, 30, and 47 nM, respectively, and inhibits PDGFR- Į-ȕDQGF -KIT with IC 50
values of 71, 84, and 74 nM, respectively [34,35,36].Preclinical Pharmacology, Toxicology , Pharmacokinetics, and Dru g Metabolism
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure 2016.Clinical Experience
Approximately 8600 subjects with cancer have been enrolled in clinical studies of 
pazopanib as of September 2015.  In October 2009, the FDA approved pazopanib tablets for 
the treatment of subjects with adv anced renal cell carcinoma (RC C) and soft tissue sarcoma 
(STS).  In addition, several clini cal studies evaluating pazopa nib in non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer , breast cancer, cervical cancer, hepatocellular cancer 
(HCC), multiple myeloma (MM), a nd glioma are in progress or hav e been completed.  
Clinical Efficacy
In a randomized, parallel assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating 
safety, efficacy and PFS of subj ects with soft tissue sarcomas,  statistically significant 
improvements in PFS were observed in the pazopanib arm when com pared with subjects 
taking placebo.  The median PFS in the placebo arm was 7.0 week s and in the pazopanib 
arm was 20.0 weeks with corres ponding HR or 0.35 as assessed by independent radiology 
review.  Soft tissue sarcoma sub- types included in this trial included synovial (48.6%), 
adipocytic (26.3%) and “other” sarcomas (39%). [34]In a randomized, double-blind, place bo-controlled phase III stud y evaluating the efficacy 
and safety of pazopanib monothera py in treatment-naive and cyto kine-pretreated subjects 
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 8 of 71with advanced RCC, the median pr ogression-free-survival (PFS) w as significantly 
prolonged with pazopanib compare d with placebo in the overall s tudy population (9.2 vs. 
4.2 months). The objective respons e rate (RR) was 30% with pazo panib and only 3% with 
placebo [37].  In subjects with ova rian cancer, 31% of subjects experienced a CA-125
response to pazopanib, with a median time to response of 29 day s and median duration of 
response of 113 days (Investigat or’s Brochure, 2010). In a phase  II trial of subjects with 
early-stage NSCLC, 86% of subjects experienced a reduction in t umor volume after short-
term, preoperative use of pazopanib (~2-6 wee ks) as assessed by  high-resolution CT 
scanning [38].  Interim results from a phase II study of pazopanib in subjects with recurrent 
or metastatic breast invasive breast cancer showed that the cli nical benefit rate was 26% 
[39].  The median TTP was 3.7 months, and 50% of subjects with measurable target lesions 
had some decrease in size.  P FS at 3 and 6 months was 55% and 28%, respectively.  
Preliminary results from a randomized study in subjects with first-line advanced ErbB2-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer showed that a hig her response rate (36.2% vs. 
22.2%) was observed in subjec ts on combination lapatinib 1000 m g once daily + pazopanib 
400 mg once daily compared to monotherapy lapatanib 1500 mg onc e daily [40].  In a 
randomized phase II study of paz opanib vs. lapatinib vs. the com bination of 
pazopanib/lapatinib in advanced and recurrent cervical cancer, there was a 34% reduction in risk for progression in subjects receiving pazopanib relative t o lapatinib.  The median PFS 
was 17.1 weeks in the lapatini b group and 18.1 weeks in the paz opanib group [41].  Interim 
analysis of data from 26 subject s showed that pazopanib has bot h a favorable tox icity profile 
and promising clinical activity in subjects with advanced and p rogressive differentiated 
thyroid cancers [42].  Five confir med partial responses (PRs) ( 19%) were reported.  
Pazopanib has not shown efficacy  in phase II studies conducted i n MM or glioma.[34]
Safety 
The randomized, phase III study i n STS subjects provided a key comparison of safety with 
pazopanib compared to placebo.[34] The most common AEs reported in 20% of subjects 
in the pazopanib arm were fatigu e (65%), diarrhea (59%), nausea  (56%), weight decreased 
(51%), hypertension (42%), anorex ia (40%), hair color change (d epigmentation; 39%), and 
vomiting (34%), tumor pain (30%), dysguesia (28%), gastrointest inal pain (24%), headache 
(23%), musculoskeletal pain (23 %), myalgia (23%), and dyspnea ( 20%).  Most of the events 
were grade 1 or 2.  A higher numbe r of grade 3 AEs were reporte d in the pazopanib arm 
(63%) compared with the placebo arm (28%).  The most frequent g rade 3 AEs in the 
pazopanib arm were increased ala nine aminotransferase (ALT), in creased aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), hypertension, and diarrhea.  The freque ncy of grade 4 and grade 5 
AEs was similar between the pa zopanib and placebo arms:  grade 4 in 7% and 6%, 
respectively; grade 5 in 4% and 3%, respectively.
When pazopanib was compared w ith sunitinib in 1102 subjects (55 4 subjects taking 
pazopanib and 548 subjects taking s unitinib), the frequency of AEs was similar (>99% in 
both).  The safety profiles obser ved between the t reatment arms were different, with greater 
frequency of diarrhea (63% paz opanib, 57% sunitinib) and hypert ension (47% pazopanib, 
41% sunitinib).  Subjects who t ook pazopanib whe n compared with  subjects taking sunitinib 
experienced lower frequency of fatigue, nausea, dysguesia and p almar-plantar 
erythrodysesthesia (PPE) syndro me.  Grade 3 and 4 reported adve rse events were similar 
between treatment arms, adding no comparative risk.  However, grade 3 AEs of increased 
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 9 of 71ALT; increased ASP and headache occurred more frequently in the  pazopanib arm when 
compared with the sunitinib arm.  [34]
A comprehensive review of all completed and ongoing pazopanib c linical trials with a cut-
off date of September 2015, lists 15 most commonly occurring se rious AEs (SAEs).[34]
Vomiting and diarrhea are the most  commonly reported SAEs across all the pazopanib 
studies.  As a consequence of thi s, dehydration is also seen with pazopanib treatment.  For 
most reports, the AEs resolved after supportive treatment such as antiemetics, antidiarrheal 
agents, and IV fluids.  GI perforation is commonly associated w ith VEGF pathway 
inhibitors.  This may manifest a s abdominal pain which is not u ncommon in cancer subjects 
for many reasons.  Of the 42 subj ects in pazopanib trials with SAEs of abdominal pain, only 
three had a documented underlyi ng intestinal perforation.  In July 2006, the DCTD, NCI, 
issued an Action Letter to investigators using pazopanib descri bing the occurrence of bowel 
perforations in subjects on pazopanib clinical trials.7KHPRVWFRPPRQ$(VOHDGLQ JWRSHUPDQHQWGLVFRQWLQXDWLRQ RIVWXG\GUXJZHUH
increased ALT, increased AST, pr oteinuria, fatigue, and hepatot oxicity.  Of these AEs, 
increased ALT, increased AST a nd proteinuria occurred in a high er proportion of  subjects 
taking pazopanib.Dyspnea is also frequently see n in pazopanib-treated subjects a nd may reflect the underlying 
disease under treatment.  Anemia i s commonly seen in cancer sub jects in association with 
chemotherapy, hemorrhage, or in fection.  The SAEs of pyrexia were attributed to multiple 
causes:  concurrent infections , the underlying malignancy, hepa tic events, other concomitant 
medications, and unknown causes.  Hep atic events are thought to  be on-target tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor (TKI) class eff ects, as hepatic enzyme elevati ons have been seen with other 
agents of this class.  Careful c linical evaluation is, therefor e, warranted in subjects with 
hepatic abnormalities.  Pazopanib is not recommended in subject s with severe hepatic 
impairment (defined as total bilirubin >3 UULN regardless of any level of ALT) as there is 
insufficient data in these subjects. Pneumonia can be a complication of chemotherapy or 
can result from debilitation and a dvanced disease.  Review of t he 33 SAEs showed the 
presence of an underlying cau se other than pazopanib in 19 of the 30 subjects.  Fatigue and 
asthenia are commonly repor ted and have multiple causes.
Hypertension observed with pazopa nib is a known class effect.  There have been 30 SAEs 
of hypertension and 3 SAEs of hyp ertensive crisis in pazopanib clinical trials.  There were 
28 subjects who were effectively treated with antihypertensive medication initiation or dose 
adjustment, while 4 had no such tr eatment.  Although there were  29 SAEs of pleural 
effusion, the body of data does not suggest that any of these c ases were due to pazopanib.  
There have been 24 SAEs of pulmona ry embolism (PE) reported in pazopanib trials.  This is 
of particular relevance since othe r members of this class have been associated with PE and 
other venous throm boembolic events.
In 
addition, there have been repor ts of cardiac and cerebral is chemic events, GI perforation 
or hemorrhage, pulmonary hemorrhag e, cerebrovascular hemorrhage , QT prolongation, and 
Torsades de Pointes in pazopanib clinical trials.

Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 10 of 71Laboratory abnormalities
In both treatment arms (placebo vs. pazopanib), most on-therapy  hematology grade shifts 
were Grade 1 or Grade 2.  A higher proportion of subjects in th e pazopanib arm had grade 
shifts for neutrophils, platelet s and WBCs compared with the pl acebo arm. Chemistry grade 
shifts that occurred more freque ntly in the pazopanib arm inclu ded hyperglycemia, 
hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia and hyponatremia.  Transaminase elev ations were also more 
common on pazopanib than placebo.  Thi rteen subjects experience d ALT elevations of 
>8UULN, and of these, 5 subjects ex perienced ALT elevations of >20 UULN.  
Clinical Pharmacokinetics
The oral bioavailability of pazopanib reflects absorption that is limited by solubility above 
doses of 800 mg once daily [34,43] Increases in doses above 800 mg to 2000 mg, in the 
fasted state will not result in i ncreased systemic exposure.  G eometric mean pazopanib t ½
values ranged from 18.1-52.3 hours.  The mean t ½was 30.9 hours in the 800 mg once daily 
group, in phase 2 and 3 trials.  Oral absorption is significant ly enhanced when dosed with 
food; therefore, it is recomme nded to administe r pazopanib on a n empty stomach, at least 1 
hour before or 2 hours after a meal.  Age, body weight, gender, a nd race have no significant 
influence on pazopanib PK.

Pazopanib is metabolized primari ly by CYP3A4, and systemic expo sure to pazopanib is 
altered by inhibitors and inducer s of this enzyme.  The concomi tant use of strong CYP3A4
inhibitors should be avoided.  Grape fruit may also increase pla sma concentrations of 
pazopanib and should be avoided.  CYP 3A4 inducers such as rifam picin may decrease 
plasma concentrations; therefore , an alternative concurrent med ication with none or minimal 
enzyme induction should be used.  Concommitant medications that ha ve narrow thera peutic windows and are substrates of 
CYP3A4, CYP2D6 or CYP2C8 shoul d be used with caution.  If possi ble, medications that 
are not substrates for these enzymes and/or do not have narrow therapeutic windows should 
be substituted. Pazopanib is a substrate for P- glycoprotein (P-gp) and BCRP tra nsporters.
Dose Selection
Pharmacodynamic data indicate th at pazopanib, at a monotherapy dose of 800 mg once 
daily, results in effects consis tent with inhibition of the VEG F receptors and angiogenic 
factors.[34]  Concentration-effect  relationships were observed between trough plasma 
pazopanib concentrations and the  development of hypertension as  well as the percent 
change from baseline to the nadi r of soluble VEGFR2 (sVEGFR2), a marker of VEGFR 
inhibition.  Decreases in sVEGFR 2 have been correlated with inc reased clinical benefit in 
RCC with other small molecule TKIs.[44] The trough plasma pazopa nib concentrations 
associated with the EC 50in both concentration-effect rel ationships were similar (15.3 
mcg/mL for hypertension and 21.3 mcg/mL for sVEGFR2). Pazopanib monotherapy has 
been approved as a n 800 mg once daily dose for the treatment of  advanced RCC in the US .

Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 11 of 712.5 Dose Rationale
In this study, subjects will r eceive pazopanib 800 mg or placeb o orally daily for 14 days (the 
“Run-in” period) followed by pre operative chemotherapy. Doses wi ll be taken fasting (at 
least one hour before and/or 2 hours after dose).
Subjects who respond to pazopani b during the Run-in period will have the option to 
continue pazopanib 800 mg orally da ily for one year following s urgery and completion of 
any adjuvant chemotherapy. Refer to Section 11.3 for details.
2.6 Chemotherapy
Pre-operative chemotherapy will consist of doxorubicin and ifos famide administered on an 
inpatient basis.  The regime n will consist of doxorubicin 75 mg /m2 administered by 
continuous intravenous infusion ove r 3 days with ifosfamide 2 g m/m2administered 
intravenously over 4 hours daily for 5 days with IV fluid and Me sna, every 21 days for 2 to 
4 cycles, depending on clinical a nd radiologic response.  Patie nts may also receive 2 to 4 
cycles of post-operative chemot herapy, (up to 6 cycles total of  neoadjuvant plus adjuvant 
chemotherapy).
2.7   Imaging Studies to Determine Early Response to Therapy in  Soft Tissue Sarcoma
Chemotherapy may improve the c hance for a cure in patients with  high risk sarcomas 
(intermediate to high grade, > 5 cm), but does not benefit every  patient and is  associated 
with toxicities.[3,4]  Identifyi ng sarcoma patients who are lik ely to benefit from 
neoadjuvant and/or adj uvant systemic treatme nt has been challen ging.  In most current trials 
of anticancer drugs, the objec tive radiographic response of tum or to treatment, as defined by 
the international Response Eval uation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), is used as a 
surrogate measure for therapeutic benefit.[45]  T he assessment of soft tissue sarcoma 
response to chemotherapy is diffi cult, however, because sarcoma s are heterogeneous tumors 
and consist of varying degrees of  cellularity, fibrous septa, s troma, and necrosis. The 
beneficial effects of a therapy w hich is successful at eradicat ing neoplastic cells may be 
masked by a tumor mass that doe s not shrink or even grows due to necrosis or intratumoral 
hemorrhage.[46]  Standard radiologic response defined by a chan ge in the size of the tumor 
to preoperative chemotherapy has  not correlated consistently with histologic results at 
surgery or with survival.[47-49]FDG-PET: Positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose  (FDG), is a 
tool for evaluation of  treatment response in sarcoma. In neoadj uvant therapy for high grade
localized sarcomas, serial FDG- PET is a sensitive method to asse ss early response to 
therapy; pretreatment standardized uptake value (SUV) and chang e in SUV predict 
outcome.[50,51] Eary and colleagues first used FDG-PET in sarcomas and demonstrated the 
relationship between the quantita tive value of the FDG metaboli c rate of tumor and the 
semi-quantitative measure of tumor uptake, the SUV.[52]  Eary a nd colleagues  showed that 
a higher tumor maximum SUV at diagnosis correlated with a greater risk for disease progression and death from disease in patients with soft tissue  or bone sarcomas.[50]  In a 
later study, Schuetze and colle agues found that the pretreatmen t tumor maximum SUV and 
change in maximum SUV after neoa djuvant chemotherapy independen tly identified 
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 12 of 71sarcoma patients at high risk of t umor recurrence.[51]  Forty-si x patients with high-grade 
localized extremity sarcomas wer e studied. Those with a baselin e tumor maximum SUV of 
6 or greater and less than a 40% de crease in FDG uptake after c hemotherapy were at high 
risk for systemic disease recu rrence, estimated to be 90% at 4 years. In contrast, those 
whose tumors had a 40% or more dec line in the tumor maximum SUV  after chemotherapy, 
were at significantly lower ri sk of recurrent disease and death  following surgery and 
radiation.  Interestingly, in this study the histologic respons e to chemotherapy did not 
correlate with patient outcome.  
In this randomized study subjects will undergo baseline staging  scans including FDG-PET. 
After the 14 day Run-in period of  pazopanib versus placebo, and prior to commencement of 
preoperative chemotherapy, subj ects will undergo repeat FDG-PET. After 2 cycles of 
chemotherapy FDG-PET will be repeated.
If results of this trial can be confirmed in larger trials, the n this could establish that changes
in tumor SUV in response to antia ngiogenic therapy and to chemo therapy may distinguish 
those patients who are likely t o benefit from these systemic th erapies from those who will 
not.
2.8 Risks/Benefits
Subjects will have a 2:1 chance of being randomized to receive pre-operative pazopanib
during a Run-in period. The potentia l benefits include early ass essment of response to 
antiangiogenic therapy and possibl e enhanced tumor cell kill. S ubjects who respond to 
pazopanib during the Ru n-in period (defined in Section 11.3) will have the option to 
continue pazopanib for one year, following surgical resection o f their tumor.   
Antiangiogenic therapy may improve outcome for patients with hi gh risk resectable soft 
tissue sarcoma, but this remain s unproven. Benefits of chemothe rapy include a potential 
improvement in disease free surv ival and overall survival compared to no systemic therapy.  
Risks of the study include side effects associated with pazopan ib and with chemotherapy as 
described in Section 10 .

4.3 Study Procedures
The study procedures outlined in Appendix A are discussed in thi s section, with the
exception of Treatment (Section 7) .  Screening will occur with in approximately 14 days prior 
(unless otherwise noted) to the first day of dosing (pazopanib versus placebo, Run-in period, 
Day 1). For procedures performed at Screening and repeated, the later procedure performed 
prior to dosing will serve as a ba seline for clinical assessment .
Informed Consent
Signed informed consent will be obtained from the subject or th e subject's legally acceptable 
representative by the principal investigator or a co-investigat or (the “Investigator”) before 
any study-specific procedures are undertaken. 
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 14 of 71The Investigator or his/her representative will explain the natu re of the study to the subject, 
and answer all questions regarding this study. Prior to any stu dy-related screening procedures 
being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will be reviewed, signed, and 
dated by the subject and by the person who administered the informed consent. A copy of the 
informed consent form will be given to the subject and the origi nal will be placed in the 
subject's research chart.
Research analysis of plasma samp les and surgical tumor tissue w ill be performed once the 
subject has signed and dated th e informed consent, approved by the IRB of record, after the 
nature of the testing has been exp lained and the subject has had  the opportunity to ask 
questions. The informed consent mu s t  b e  s i g n e d b e f o r e  t h e  t e s t i n g  is performed or tumor 
tissue and plasma samples  are used for analysis.
Medical History
The following information will be  collected during the Screenin g Visit:
ƔComplete medical history, incl uding documentation of any clinica lly
significant medical condition
ƔOncology history, including primary cancer diagnosis
o Pathology of primary tumoro Stage of tumor  (locatio n, size, grade and depth)
At each visit, the subject's medical history will be reviewed a nd any changes from baseline 
will be recorded. On Run-in period, Day 1 any changes observed fr om the screening 
assessments, prior to dosing, will be recorded in the subject's medical history. All medication 
(prescription or over-the-counter, including vitamins and/or her bal supplements) will be 
recorded beginning with the Screen ing Visit and continued for th e duration of the study.
Physical Examination
A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening,  i n c l u d i n g  h e i g h t .  A
symptom-directed physical examination including weight will be performed at all other visits 
unless indicated otherwise. Clinically significant physical exa mination findings after the
administration of the first day of dosing will be recorded as ad verse events.
12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
A resting 12-lead ECG will be performed at the Screening Visit, u nless performed for 
standard of care within 14 days. The investigator or a designee will sign and date the ECGs, 
determine if any findings outside normal physiological variation  are clinically significant (in 
consultation with a cardiologist if necessary), and document thi s on the ECG report. ECGs 
will also be performed at the initiation of pazopanib maintenan ce therapy, Cycle 1 Day 1 and 
Cycle 2 Day 2.   
Vital Signs
Vital sign determinations of  heart rate, blood pressure and bod y temperature will be 
measured at all visits unl ess indicated otherwise. 
Pregnancy Test
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 15 of 71For female subjects of childb earing potential, a serum pregnanc y test will be performed at the 
Screening Visit and a urine pr egnancy test will be done at the Run-in period Day 1 visit prior 
to the first dose of pazopanib ve rsus placebo. Subjects consider ed not of childbearing
potential must be documented as being surgically sterile or pos t-menopausal (for at least 1
year). The test results must be r eviewed and determined to be ne gative prior to dosing. If the
urine pregnancy test is positive at Cycle 1 Day 1, it should be  confirmed by a serum
pregnancy test. The test may be repeated at the discretion of t he Investigator at any time
during the study. Should the subj ect become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while 
participating in this study, she should inform the Investigator i mmediately. The Principal 
Investigator should be notified and will be responsible for con tacting the representative at 
Novartis.
Clinical Laboratory Tests
All subjects will undergo the laboratory assessments outlined in Appendix A . After Cycle 1 
Day 1, clinical laboratory tests should be performed within 72 h ours surrounding the 
scheduled study visit date. Any l aboratory value outside the ref erence range that is 
considered clinically significant by the investigator will be fo llowed as appropriate. 
Clinically significant laboratory values will be recorded as adv erse events if they meet the 
criteria as specified in Section 7.7 .
Tumor Assessments (Radiologic)Baseline staging scans including a positron emission tomograph with a built-in CT 
component (FDG-PET), MRI of the p rimary tumor, and diagnostic CT c hest are required at 
Screening (within approximately  14 days of the Run-in Period, D ay 1). After the 14-day 
Run-in period of pazopanib versus  placebo, and prior to commencement of preoperative 
chemotherapy, subjects will undergo repeat FDG-PET and MRI of the  primary tumor. After 
2 cycles of chemotherapy, FDG- PET and MRI of the primary tumor w ill be repeated.
CT of the chest without contrast will be performed approximatel y every 3 months for the first 
year following surgery and MRI  (or CT) of the  primary site of t he tumor will be performed 
every 6 months. 
ECOG Performance Status
The ECOG performance status wi ll be assessed at Sc reening, Run- in Period Day 1 and Day 1 
of each subsequent cycle, Final Visit, and at the 30-day Follow-u p Visit.  See Appendix B
for ECOG criteria. 
Pharmacokinetic Studies
Trough level (22-24 hrs after pa zopanib dosing): A blood sample  (4 mL K2EDTA purple top 
blood collection tube) will be dra wn to assess the trough plasm a pazopanib concentration 
during the 14 day Run-in period of pazopanib monotherapy, after  completion of adjuvant 
chemotherapy, and every 3 months thereafter until completion of pazopanib maintenance 
therapy. During the Run-in period, the trough level will be dra wn twice during Days 10 
through 14: 1) one trough on any of Days 10-14 and 2) on the da y of the FDG PET after the 
Run-in period, 22-24 hours after the patient’s last dose of pazopanib versus placebo.  After 
completion of surgery/adjuvant chemotherapy, the trough will be  drawn once during each of 
the following periods: 1) Week 2 (Days 10-15 after restarting p azopanib),  
 Weeks 3-4 after 
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 16 of 71restarting pazopanib, and then every 3 months for 1 year).  If all trough levels are drawn, a 
total of 8 samples are possible in a single subject.
An optional full intensive pharm acokinetic visit will be performed in consenting patients 
during Weeks 2-4 in subjects following surgery/adjuvant chemoth erapy. Blood (4 mL 
K2EDTA purple top blood collec tion tube) will be obtained at th e following timepoints: 
immediately before pazopanib dos ing (within 5 minutes before giving pazopanib on the day 
of PK dosing) and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 hour timepoints (+/- 10 minute s) , and 24 hrs (range 22 to 
24 hours) after dosing (a total of 8 samples/subject).
Biomarker Studies
Plasma will be collected for measurement of VEGF and soluble VEGFR2 (sVEGFR2) at 
baseline, after the 14 day Run-in period of pazopanib, after co mpletion of neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy and approximately ev ery 3 months thereafter until co mpletion of pazopanib 
maintenance therapy, when indi cated.   Quantitative enzyme-link ed immunosorbent assays 
(ELISA) for VEGF and sVEGFR2 will be performed on plasma and tu mor extracts.
Plasma will also be collected for  micro RNA at baseline, after the 14 day Run-in period of 
pazopanib, following neoadjuvant  chemotherapy and every 3 month s thereafter until 
completion of pazopanib mainten ance therapy, when indicated.

chemotherapy should be initiated only after adequate wound heal ing has been achieved.   Patients who require a delay of 
greater than 10 weeks from the initial surgery due to inadequat e wound healing will be removed from further protocol 
therapy.
FPost-operative radiation administration, when given, will consi st of external beam 50 Gy in 25 fractions of 2 Gy/fraction over 5 
weeks, followed by 10 Gy boost (in 5 fractions) to a reduced, o r boost, volume. For contaminated or close margins, the 
boost dose will be 10 - 16 Gy; for microscopically positive marg ins, 16 - 20 Gy, and for grossly positive margins, 20 – 26 
Gy. 
For patients who received pre-operative radiation, but have pos itive surgical margins, 16 – 20 Gy (2Gy x 8 - 10 fractions) will be 
given by external beam following any planned adjuvant chemother apy.  
GPazopanib may be resumed 1 week after completion of post-operati ve therapy (chemotherapy +/- radiation) for those randomized 
to the treatment who had a response by imaging, to be continued  for 1 year.  Unblinding occurs during the first post-op visit after 
surgery.
HPEG-Filgrastim should be administered approximately 24-48 hours after completing chemotherapy.  10 days of filgrastim may be 
substituted.
I Mesna will be given at 400 mg/m2.  Post IFOS doses will be at 4 hours and 8 hours (+/- standard clinical dosing windows)
7.1 Agent Administration
7.1.1 Pazopanib Administration
Subjects will be randomized t o receive either pazopanib 800 mg orally daily or 
placebo for 14 days as a Run-in pe riod, prior to beginning neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
with doxorubicin and ifosfamide. Doses of pazopanib/placebo will be taken fasting 
(at least 1 hour prior and/or 2 hours after).
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 22 of 71Subjects deemed to be responders to pazopanib preoperative ther apy (defined in 
Section 11.3), will have the option to receive  one year of therapy with paz opanib 800 
mg orally daily following compl etion of surgery and post-operat ive adjuvant 
treatments. 
Treatment Regimen
Treatment will be administere d on an outpatient basis.  Subjects  receive pazopanib 
versus placebo at a dose of 800 mg/day (four 200-mg tablets or t wo 400 mg tablets;
dose modification will be accomp lished by combining 200-mg tablets as necessary).  
Subjects are instructed to swallow tablets once a day (preferab ly in the morning) on 
an empty stomach, either 1 hour  before or 2 hours after food wi th about 1 cup (240 
mL) water. Tablets should be swallowed whole; they must not be c hewed, broken, or 
crushed.  Treatment continues  until one of the criteria in Section 7.3 applies.
For the subjects who will have intensive pharmacokinetic analys es performed during 
pazopanib maintenance, subjects s hould wait to take the pazopan ib on-site (observed 
dose by study personnel).  Subject s should either wait to eat o n-site (1 hour after 
pazopanib dosing) or make sure to eat at least 2 hours before the planned time of 
pazopanib dosing for that day.
Subjects will be provided with a M edication Diary for pazopanib , instructed in its 
use, and asked to bring the diary with them to each appointment.  A new copy of the 
Medication Diary will be given t o subjects whose dose is reduce d due to AEs. Prior 
to the scheduled study visit , subjects will be reminded to document the exact time of 
pazopanib dosing the day before blood is drawn for measurement of trough 
concentrations.  Subjects will also be reminded not to take the ir morning pazopanib 
dose until after the blood draw for trough concentrations has b een completed.
All prescription and over-the-counter medications as well as alternative medicines 
that have been taken within 4 wee ks prior to the first dose of pazopanib must be fully 
documented in the Case Report Fo rm (CRF; indication, dose infor mation and dates of 
administration).  The Investigator  or a designee must be inform ed as soon as possible 
about any new medication taken from the time of screening until  the end the study;
these new medications will be f ully documented in the CRF (indi cation, dose 
information, and dates of  administration).  
All concomitant medications tak en during the study will be recorded in the CRF with 
indication, dose information, a nd dates of ad ministration.
Precautions/Warnings
Certain drugs which induce or inhi bit cytochrome P450 enzymes a re prohibited.
Medical personnel must refer to t he list of prohibited agents in  Section 7.4 prior 
to administering treatment.
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 23 of 71Certain drugs which are listed as “use with caution” should be avoided if possible, but 
if necessary, subjects who receive  these medications should be closely monitored for 
AEs.  Medical personnel must refer to t he list of “use with caution” agents in 
Section 7.4_ prior to ad ministering treatment.
Hypertension is an important A E associated with pazopanib.  Fre quent blood 
pressure (BP) monitoring is important in subjects receiving pazopanib versus 
placebo starting on day 8 and continuing until the subject is o ff study.  Experience to 
date suggests that increases in BP may occur following dosing with pazopanib for a 
number of weeks and that these in creases may occur relatively quickly. Section 7.7
includes specific guidelines on the  management of treatment-eme rgent hypertension.  
Recommendations for hypertension monitoring and management are p resented in 
Appendix F .
QTc prolongation and Torsades de P ointes is a rare but serious adverse event 
associated with pazopanib.  There fore, the following is require d:
xIntensive QTc monitoring.  A baseline ECG is required prior to study
registration, and subjects with QTc 480 msec are excluded . Repeat 
ECG must be performed during the w eek 2.  After surgery, for those 
subjects continuing on maintenan ce pazopanib, if the QTc interv al at 4 
weeks is 500 msec, the ECG should be repea ted within 7 days and, if the 
QTc interval remains 500 msec, the subject sho uld be removed from the 
study.  Additionally, if the QTc interval is increased by 60 ms ec or more 
from baseline but the QTc interva l remains at <500 msec, an ECG  should

increase in the QTc interval from baseline, consideration should be given 
to removing the subject from the  study or increasing monitoring , after 
discussion with the Principal Investigator.
xSubjects must be quest ioned about family history of prolonged Q Tc, 
personal history of p rolonged QTc, relevan t cardiac disease, an d 
concomitant medications which ar e associated with a high risk of  
causing QTc prolongation prior to study registration .
xConcomitant treatment with drugs  that are associated with a hig h risk 
of causing QTc prolongation should be changed to similar agents  that 
do not pose such a risk, if poss ible, prior to a subject receiving the first 
dose of pazopanib. A comprehensive list of agents that are associated 
with a risk of prolonging the Q Tc interval is provided in Appendix E.  
xPotassium, calcium, phosphate, and magnesium levels must be obtained before admini stration of the first  dose of pazopanib a nd 
frequently thereafter (as described in the Study Calendar, Appen dix 
A).  
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 24 of 71xAbnormalities that occur after enrollment in potassium, calcium , 
phosphate, and magnesium levels should be managed as follows:

allowed at these lower grades, e very effort should be made to c orrect the 
abnormal lab values to n ormal if possible.  
If an ECG, obtained because of these lab values, reveals an inc rease in the 
QTc to >500 msec or an increase in the QTc by at least 60 msec f rom 
baseline, the ECG shoul d be repeated before re-administration o f 
pazopanib.  If the QTc interva l, on the repeat ECG, is still >5 00 msec, the 
subject should be removed from th e study.  If the QTc, on the r epeat ECG, 
remains increased in the QTc by at least 60 msec from baseline b ut is less 
than 500 msec, consideration shoul d be given to removing the subject 
from the study.
Renal function (creatinine and urinary protein)  should be frequently monitored  as 
suggested by the pathologic changes noted in animal studies and  evidence from 
studies of other antiangiogenic agents.  Specific guidelines fo r management of 
proteinuria and elevated creatinine are presented in Section 7.7.
Hepatic Function monitoring include ALT, AST , GGT, alkaline phosphotase and 
total bilirubin at the following visits:
xat screening; 
xbefore initiation of pa zopanib treatment;
xend of week 2;
xprior to Day 1 of each cycle;
xat post-treatment visit;
xfinal visit;
x30-day follow-up
Periodic monitoring should con tinue monthly if pazopanib monoth erapy is continued. 
Pazopanib is not reco mmended for subjects with severe hepatic i mpairment (defined 
as >3UULN, regardless of any level of ALT).
7.1.2 Chemotherapy Administration
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 25 of 71Pre-operative chemotherapy will consist of doxorubicin and ifos famide administered 
on an inpatient basis. Subjects may  also receive 2 to 4 cycles of  post-operative 
chemotherapy, (up to 6 cycles tota l of neoadjuvant plus adjuvan t chemotherapy).  
Doxorubicin: 75 mg/m2by continuous IV infusion days 1 through 3 of each cycle. 
Ifosfamide: 2.0 g/m2  over 4 hours IV, days 1 through 5 of each cycle.
Mesna: 400 mg/m2IV pre, 4 hours post, and 8 hours post each dose of ifosfamide.
Hydration:   D5W with 100 meq/L sodium acetate, 20 meq/L potass ium acetate, 4 
meq/L magnesium sulfate continuous IV infusion at a rate of 83 mL/hour, begun 
approximately 2 hours prior to che motherapy and discontinued after completion of 
chemotherapy and Mesna. 
Cycle 1 of chemotherapy may only commence after a minimum 6-day  washout 
period of pazopanib.
7.2 Radiation Therapy
Radiation treatment ( XRT) will be administe red using standard of care delivery and 
quality assurance techniques, using mega-voltage photons. Elect rons may be used if 
dosimetrically appropriate, but no other particle therapy such as neutrons or protons may
be used.  Brachytherapy and IORT  may be used for boost volumes to sites of residual 
disease, when appropr iate. Simulation must  be CT-based, using c ontrast if possible, and 
appropriate immobiliz ation devices. Target delineation for preo perative XRT must 
include the GTV, CTV, PTV and orga ns at risk, with identified d ose constraints, and for 
postoperative XRT, delineation mus t include the pre-operative G TV, CTV (i.e., surgical 
bed), PTV and organs a t risk, also with ide ntified dose constra ints. Treatment planning 
must generate dosimetry with no m ore than plus or minus 5% hete rogeneity, while 
sparing an adequate strip of circumferential tissue to allow on going lymphatic drainage, 
and utilizing external beam deliver y techniques, such as IMRT and 3-D conformal 
approaches when necessary, to ach ieve this aim . The use of bolus is at the discretion of 
the radiation oncologist, but is ra rely indicated in the preoper ative setting. 
For preoperative XRT, the pres cribed dose to the PTV should be 50 Gy in 25 fractions of 
2 Gy/fraction over 5 weeks. If the  target volume encompasses se nsitive structures such as 
bowel or lung, the dose can be r educed to 45 Gy in 25 fractions  of 1.8 Gy without 
protocol violation.
For postoperative XRT, the pres cribed dose to the PTV should be  50 Gy in 25 fractions 
of 2 Gy/fraction over 5 weeks, followed by 10 Gy boost (in 5 fr actions) to a reduced 
volume.   For contaminated or clo se margins, the boost dose will  be 10 - 16 Gy; for 
microscopically positive margins, 16 - 20 Gy, and for grossly po sitive margins, 20– 26
Gy. Verification must include initial and weekly isocenter imaging checks with image 
guidance with cone beam CT as appropriate to the technique, as well as weekly on-
treatment patient review visits. D iode checks and physics revie w must be completed as 
standard procedure.  
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 26 of 71Maintenance pazopanib for those who respond to therapy during t he Run-in period, may 
not commence until one  week following completion of radiation. 
7.3 Surgery
The goal of surgical treatment is to resect the tumor with negati ve margins.  All lesions of 
the trunk and extremitie s will be treated with conservative res ection (minimal wide 
excision) after pre-operative t herapy.  Surgical resection shou ld remove as wide a margin 
of tissue around the tumor as pos sible without compromising fun ction.  If postoperative 
pathology evaluation reveals positive soft-tissue margins other  than bone, nerve, or large 
blood vessels, this margin should be re-resected if possible.  If bone, major blood vessel 
or nerve is microscopically positiv e additional radiation should  be given as noted in the 
protocol.  Resectability will depend upon the judgment of the operating surgeon.  For the
extremities, limb salvage procedure is standard of care if achiev able.  For other anatomic 
areas, it must be the judgment of  the operating surgeon that he /she may reasonably expect 
to obtain negative margins. Ext remity patients who are not rese ctable without amputation 
may be amputated, and should compl ete chemotherapy per protocol .
7.4 Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines
7.4.1 Potential Drug Interactions
Pazopanib is primarily metaboliz ed by the human CYP3A4 isoenzyme.  Potent CYP3A4 
inhibitors and inducers are prohibited on the trial.
Medications prohibited during paz opanib therapy that strongly i nhibit CYP3A4 
include (but are not limited to) :
xAntibiotics:  clarithromycin, telithromycin, troleandomycin, er ythromycin
xHIV:  protease inhibitors (ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, ne lfinavir, amprenavir,
lopinavir)
xAntifungals:  itraconzaole , ketoconazole, voriconazole
xAntidepressants:  nefazodone
xAntiarrythmics: ditiazem, felodi pine, nicardipine, quinidine, v erapamil
Medications prohibited during paz opanib therapy that strongly in duce CYP3A4 
include (but are not limited to) :
xGlucocorticoids:  cortisone (> 50 mg), hydrocortisone (>40 mg), prednisone (>10 mg), 
methylprednisolone (>8 m g), dexamethasone (>1.5 mg)
xAnticonvulsants:  phenytoin, carba mezepine, phenobarbital, oxca rbazepine
xHIV antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine
xAntibiotics:  rifampin (rifampic in), rifabutin, rifapentene
xMiscellaneous:  St. John’s Wort , modafinil, pioglitazone, troglitazone, canertinib, 
erlotinib, lapatinib
Pazopanib is a weak inhibito r of CYP3A4, CYP 2C8, and CYP2D6.  D rugs that have narrow 
therapeutic windows and are substrates for these enzymes should be administered with 
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 27 of 71extreme caution.  Because of pazopanib’s long ha lf-life, caution should continue to be
exercised for at least 14 days aft er the last dose of pazopanib wh en administering these 
medications.
Medications to use with caution th at are substrates for these en zymes and have narrow 
therapeutic windows medications include (but are not limited to ):
xErgot derivatives:  dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine 
(potential increased risk for deve loping ergot toxicity that in cludes severe vasospasm 
leading to peripheral as well as cerebral ischemia)
xNeuroleptics: pimozide (potential i ncreased risk for QT interval  prolongation, ventricular 
arrhythmia, and sudden death)
xAntiarrhythmics:  bepridil, fleca inide, lidocaine, mexiletine, amiodarone, quinidine, 
propafenone (potential increase d risk for QT interval prolongat ion and Torsade de 
Pointes)
xImmune modulators:  cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus (potent ial increased risk for 
nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity)
xMiscellaneous:  quetiapine, risperidone, clozapine, atomoxetine , simvastatin, 
bevacizumab, topotecan, short- acting antacids and PPIs.
Pazopanib can prolong the QTc interval.  Drugs that are generally accepted to have a risk of 
causing Torsades de Pointes ( see Appendix E ) should be discontinued o r replaced with drugs 
that do not carry this risk, if at all possible.  Subjects who receive potential QTc-prolonging 
medications ( see Appendix E ) should be monitored closely. 
Pazopanib may increase bleeding .  Subjects, receiving pazopanib  and anticoagulation, should 
be monitored for bleeding.
Pazopanib may cause decreased glucose.  Subjects, receiving pazo panib and hypoglycemia 
agents, should be monitored for hypoglycemia.
7.4.2 Supportive Care 
Anti-Emetics
Routine use of anti-emetics is  recommended for subjects due to the highly emetogenic nature
of the chemotherapy regimen.  S election of anti- emetics is base d on the institution’s standard 
and is at the Investigator’s discretion.  
Prophylactic Antibiotics
Prophylactic antibiotics for prevention of neutropenic fever ma y be used at the discretion of
the Investigator.  Use of proph ylactic antibiotics must be reco rded in the case report forms.
Growth Factors
Administration of growth factor is required after all chemother apy cycles:
PEG-filgrastim 6 mg administered as a subcutaneous injection st arting 24-48 hours after 
completion of chemotherapy (may substitute filgrastim 5 mcg/kg/ day (rounded to nearest vial 
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 28 of 71size) administered as a subcutan eous injection starting 24-48 h ours after completion of 
chemotherapy for 10 days, or until white blood count has recove red after nadir (ANC > 
10,000)
Transfusion of Blood Products
Depending on the particular se tting, red blood cell and platele t transfusions may be 
appropriate, at the Investigat or’s discretion and with the subj ect’s consent.
7.5 Duration of Therapy
Treatment should continue until th e end of protocol therapy, de fined as the completion of all 
adjuvant treatments following s urgical resection of the primary  tumor, or until one of the 
following criteria applies:
xDisease progression,
xIntercurrent illness that preve nts further administration of tr eatment,
xUnacceptable adverse events(s),
xGreater than 3-week delay in therapy due to adverse event
xThe subject or legal representativ e requests to withdraw from the  study, or
xChanges in the subject's conditi on render the subject unacceptable for further 
treatment in the judgment  of the Investigator.
7.6 Duration of Follow-Up
When a subject discontinues the study, a Final Visit will be co nducted. All subjects will 
have one Follow-up Visit approxima tely 30 days after the Final Visit. This Follow-up Visit 
does not need to be performed for subjects who have had a Final  Visit conducted 30 days 
after discontinuation of maint enance pazopanib therapy.
Study visits and evaluations will  be performed in clinic at Scr eening and within 
approximately 72 hours prior to hospital admission for each che motherapy cycle 
(neoadjuvant as well as adjuvant). Assessments will include inte rval history, physical 
examination, blood counts and chemistries. Rad iological assessm ents including FDG-PET
CT, MRI of the primary tumor, and diagnostic CT chest will be perf ormed prior to the 14 day 
Run-in period of pazopanib versus  placebo. After the Run-in per iod, and prior to 
commencement of preoperative ch emotherapy, subjects will undergo  repeat FDG-PET CT 
and MRI of the primary tumor. Aft er 2 cycles of chemotherapy, FD G-PET CT and MRI of 
the primary tumor w ill be repeated. ( Refer to Section 4.3 and Appendix A ). Study 
procedures may be performe d up to approximately 72 hours before  or after the scheduled 
visit date.
Subjects will be evaluated daily  during radiation therapy.  Fol lowing surgery, subjects who 
remain on pazopanib monotherapy will have study visits and evaluations monthly for the one 
year duration of therapy, and f ollow-up visits will be every 3 months for those not on 
pazopanib.  CT of the chest wit hout contrast will be performed every 3 months for the first 
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 29 of 71year following surgery and MRI  (or CT) of the  primary site of t he tumor will be performed 
every 6 months.
Following the Final Visit and/or  30-day Follow-up Visit, follow -up will proceed as described 
in the study calendar (Appendix A) until recurrence or progress ion.  Patients experiencing 
recurrence or progression will be contacted every 4 months for overall survival, unless the patient has withdrawn consen t for the study has ended.
7.7 Dosing Delays/Dos e Modifications
Recommendations for pazopanib dose interruptions/modifications i n case of specific 
treatment-emergent AEs are provi ded in the following sections. 
As a general rule, if dose re duction of pazopanib is necessary, the dose should be reduced 
stepwise by 200 mg at each ste p, and the subject should be moni tored for approximately 10 
to 14 days at each dose level.  If toxicity does not abate duri ng this monitoring time, the IP 
may need to be interrupted and/or  the dose further decreased wi th continued monitoring for 
an additional 10-14 days at each dose level, and so on. 
If the toxicity has abated with reduction of the dose and dose re-escalation is considered safe 
by the Investigator, the pazopani b dose can then be increased st ep-wise back to the pre-event 
dose (in 200 mg increments, after monitoring for 10-14 days at each dose level to ensure that 
toxicity did not recur or worsen). 
General: Pazopanib dosing will be modifie d for adverse events according t o the following 
sections.  Reference the following Dose Level table:
*Patients will be removed from pr otocol treatment if dose reduc tion below this level is 
indicated.

If the potential benefit of  reinitiating pazopanib
treatment is considere d to outweigh the risk for 
hepatotoxicity, then c onsider reintroducing  
pazopanib at a reduced dose of 400 mg once 
daily and measure serum liver tests weekly for 8 weeks only after discussion with the PI.
If AST/ALT elevations  >3 X ULN recur, then 
pazopanib should be perman ently discontinued.
AST/ALT >3 X ULN and concurrent bilirubin
elevations >2 X ULNPermanently discontinue pazopanib.
Mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia, known or 
suspected Gilbert’s sy ndrome, and elevation in

7.7.3 Chemotherapy Dos e Modifications
A treatment cycle may not begin unless the patient's absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 
is t1500/PL and platelet count is t 100,000/PL (without transfusion).
Patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 hematologic or non-hematol ogic toxicity that is 
attributable to chemotherapy a nd not to the underlying disease should have 
chemotherapy held until the toxicity UHVROYHVWR*UDGH .Dose modifications for 
doxorubicin and ifosfamide-related toxicity will be based on th e Investigator’s 
discretion.
Patients who are delayed greater  than 3 weeks due to non-resolu tion of such toxicity 
will be taken off study. 
7.8 Criteria for Evaluability and Re moval/Withdrawal from Treatm ent
Criteria for evalua bility of the Trial
xPatients must have received a total of at least 80% of the inte nded dose of 
doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and pazo panib to be evaluable for the trial. If less
than this amount is received, the patient may remain on the stu dy, but will 
not be evaluated for primary endpoints.
Criteria for stopping therapy:
xSubstantial non-compliance with t he requirements of the study.
xAny adverse event which, in the Investigator’s opinion, require s termination of 
the study medication.
xDisease progression, unless at the discretion of the Investigat or (in 
collaboration with Novartis) continued treatment with study drug is 
appropriate.
xThe patient would benefit from a dditional radiation therapy bey ond that 
specified in the protocol.
xRequest by the patient or a legal representative/relative to st op the treatment.
xThe patient presents with a beta- HCG test consistent with pregn ancy.  
Pregnancy will be reported along the same timelines as a serious adverse event.
xThe patient uses illicit drugs or ot her substances that may, in  the opinion of the
xInvestigator, have a reasonable chance of contributing to toxic ity or otherwise 
interfering with results.
xThe development of a second malig nancy that requires treatment,  which would 
interfere with this study.
xThe patient is lost to follow-up.
xInterruption in administration of  pazopanib or chemotherapy for  greater than 3-
week delay.
xDevelopment of an intercurrent illness or situation which would, in the 
judgment of the Investigator, aff ect assessments of clinical st atus and study 
endpoints to a significant degree.
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 34 of 71Criteria for study withdrawal:
xStudy closure.
xPatient decision to withdraw from  both study therapy and follow-u p.
The Investigator will make every reasonable effort to keep each  patient in the study unless it is 
in the patient’s best interest  to discontinue participation.  I f a patient is removed from the study 
or declines further participati on, all End of Treatment evaluat ions should be performed if the 
patient is willing and able to be assessed.  A description of t he reason(s) for withdrawal from 
the study will be recorded on the case report form (CRF).  The Investigator should also ensure 
that all patients are followed up f or survival and recurrence a fter the Final Visit.
Relevant visit data should be entered on the CRF and any unused  study medication will be 
accounted for and returned for all patients partic ipating in th e study, even for a brief period of 
time.  Patients who discontinue following entry will have relevant information completed and 
recorded on the CRF.  All patients who discontinue because of a dverse events or clinically 
significant laboratory abnormalities should be followed up until they recover or stabilize, and the subsequent outcome will be recorded.  If any patient should die during the trial or within 30 days of stopping study treatment, the Investigator will inform the IRB and the Novartis 
representative.  The cause of death should be recorded in detai l, within 24 hours, on a serious 
adverse event (SAE) form and r eported to the IRB and Novartis.
Subjects who are withdrawn from th e study prior to surgery will  be replaced and randomized to 
treatment with pazopa nib versus placebo according to the 2:1 de sign.
8.0 GUIDELINES FOR ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
8.1 Adverse Event Reportin g/ Institutional Policy
In accordance with institutional policy, all adverse events whi ch in the opinion of the Principal
Investigator are unexpected andrelated or possibly rela ted to the research andserious or suggest 
that the research places researc h participants or others at gre ater risk of physical or psychological 
harm than was previously known o r recognized be reported to the  IRB within 10 calendar days 
of learning of the problem.
Definitions:
Adverse Event : - Any untoward medical occurren ce in a patient or clinical inve stigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical produc t, medical treatment or pro cedure and which does not 
necessarily have to have a causa l relationship with this treatm ent.  An adverse event can 
therefore be any unfavorable a nd unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for 
example), symptom, or disease te mporally associated with the us e of a medicinal product, 
medical treatment or procedure wh ether or not considered relate d to the medicinal product. 
Life-threatening Adverse Event: – Any adverse event that places  the patient or subject, in view 
of the Investigator, at immediat e risk of death from the reaction.  
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 35 of 71Unexpected Adverse Event: – An adverse event is “unexpected ” when its nature (specificity) , 
severity, or frequency are not  consistent with (a) the known or  foreseeable risk of adverse events 
associated with the research proc edures described in the Protocol-related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol , informed consent document and o ther relevant sources of 
information such as product la beling and package inserts; and a re also not consistent with (b) the 
characteristics of the subject  population being studied includi ng the expected natural progression 
of any underlying disease, disorder or condition any predisposi ng risk factor profile for the 
adverse event.
Serious Adverse Event (SAE): – Any adverse event occurring that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
¾ death; 
¾ a life-threatening adverse event (real risk of dying);
¾ inpatient hospitalization or pr olongation of existing hospitali zation (for 
reasons other than planned chemo therapy or post-surgical care)
¾ a persistent or significant disability/incapacity;
¾ a congenital anomaly;
¾ requires intervention to prevent  permanent impairment of damage .
Attribution: - The following are definitions f or determining whether an adverse event is related 
to a medical product, t reatment or procedure:
An adverse event is “ related or possibly related to the research procedures” if in the 
opinion of the Principal Investigator, it was more likely than not caused by the research 
procedures.Adverse events that are solely caused by an underlying disease , disorder or condition of the 
subject or by other circumstan ces unrelated to either the resea rch or any underlying disease, 
disorder or condition of the subject are not “related or p ossibly related.”
If there is any question whether or not an adverse event is rel ated or possibly related, the 
adverse event should be reported.
The Cancer Consortium Expedited Reporting Form should be comple ted for all adverse events 
that meet the expedited reporting requirements.  The AE form sh ould be faxed to the IRO at 
(206) 667-6831.  All available in formation should be submitted.
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator and/or a  designated staff member to notify 
Novartis, NIH, and the  FDA of adverse events that meet expedite d reporting (such as Serious 
Adverse Events) as required in the protocol.Also considered serious for  the purposes of this study:
xALT >3.0 x ULN with concomitant  elevation in bilir ubin (defined as total bilirubin <2.0 
x ULN or direct bilirubin 35%) or with hypersensitivity symptom s (e.g., fever, rash) –
bilirubin fractionation should be pe rformed in testing availabl e.
xALT >8.0 x ULN without bilirubin e levation (define d as total bi lirubin <2.0 x ULN or 
direct bilirubin 35%) and without hypersensitivity symptoms (e.g ., fever, ra
 sh) – bilirubin

Serious Adverse Events
For Open Label Portion of Study:
All SAEs arising during the st udy in subjects exposed to pazopa nib will be reported to Novartis 
using copies of the original C ase Report Form pages and within 24 hours of first becoming aware 
of the event, regardless  of causality assessments.
For Blinded Portion of Study:
Study conduct procedures will be  ensured and in place to allow for the expedited reporting of 
relevant SAEs to the appropriate regulatory authorities, IEC(s)  or IRB(s) as required, during the 
course of the study.
SAEs will be sent to Novartis a s they arise in subjects exposed  to pazobanib using copies of the 
original Case Report Form pages and within 24 hour s of first be coming aware of the event, 
regardless of causality assessments.
Pregnancy Reports
Reports of pregnancy informati on on any female subjects who bec omes pregnant while 
participating in the s tudy and following exposure to the study product will be sent to Novartis
using copies of the original C ase Report Form pages and within two weeks of the pregnancy 
(including premature ter mination of the pregnancy).  
Information on the status of the  mother and child will be repor ted to the coordinating center.  
Generally, follow-up will be re quested by Novartis no longer tha n 8 weeks following the 
estimated delivery date.8.2 Study-Specific Adverse Event Capture
8.2.1 Duration and Grade of  Adverse Event Capture
All grade 3 and 4 adverse events occurring after the subject has  t a k e n  t h e  f i r s t  
dose of study drug until the end of study will be recorded in the  subject’s case 
record form.
Documentation must be supported by an entry in the subject’s fi le.  A laboratory 
test abnormality considered clinically relevant, e.g., causing t he subject to 
withdraw from the study, requiring treatment or causing apparen t clinical 
manifestations, or judged releva nt by the Investigator, should be reported as an 
adverse event.  Each grade 3 or 4 event should be described in d etail along with 
start and stop dates, severity, r elationship to investigational  product, action taken 
and outcome.
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 37 of 718.2.2 Adverse Event Grading

9.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN
9.1 Data Monitoring
Data and safety monitoring for the study will be performed by t he Clinical Research Support 
Office of the Fred Hutchinson/University of Washington Cancer Co nsortium (the 
“Consortium”). The purpose of the monitoring is to verify the ac curacy of the study data, assess 
compliance with the protocol a nd with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations, and assure the 
timely and complete reporting of s afety (adverse event) data. To  facilitate the monitoring, 
medical records for subjects enr olled by the University of Washi ngton/Seattle Cancer Care 
Alliance (the coordinating center) and Oregon Health & Science University will be reviewed by
the Clinical Research Support Offi ce. The records will be made a vailable for monitoring by 
study staff.
Monitoring for this study will be  scheduled in accordance with t he Cancer Consortium Data and 
Safety Monitoring Plan. The inte rvals and scope  are detailed in the monitoring plan.
9.2 Safety Monitoring
Investigators will conduct con tinuous review of  data and patien t safety.  Bi-monthly review 
meetings will include Principal I nvestigators and study coordin ators.  Other study staff may be 
included per the PI’s discretion.  A  summary of the following w ill be presented at each meeting:
xTotal subject accrual
xSignificant toxicities experienced by enrolled subjects
xDose modifications and responses
The Principal Investigators a nd co-Investigators will provide study oversight and will review 
adverse events for trends that indicate a change in the known r isks to the study participant. The
Principal Investigator will m eet with these individuals on a re gular basis to review recently 
acquired data, and adverse even ts. If it is the opinion of any in vestigator that the risks or benefits 
to a patient warrant suspension or termination of study activit y, the recommendation must be 
submitted in writing to the Principal Investigator for safety c ommittee review.  The safety 
committee will include John Thompson, MD, and Bojana Askovich, Ph.D in addition to the 
Principal Investigators and pr imary study staff.  Suspension or termination of study activities 
may also be initiated base d on the bi-monthly review.

10.2 Ifosfamide (Isophosphamide, Iphosphamide, Z4942, Ifex®) NSC #109724 (12200 4)
Source and Pharmacology: Ifosfamide is a structural analogue of cyclophosphamide. 
Ifosfamide requires hepatic microsomal activation (P-450 3A isoe nzymes) for the production of 
the reactive 4-hydroxyoxazaphorin e intermediate which serves as a carrier molecule for the 
ultimate intracellular libera tion of acrolein and phosphoramide mustard which is an active 
bifunctional alkylating species. Acrolein is thought to be the c ause of the hemorrhagic cystitis as 
seen with cyclophosphamide. Ifosfamide demonstrates dose-depende nt pharmacokinetics 
whereby the terminal half-life ranges from 7 to 16 hours at dose s of 1.6-2.4g/m² to 3.8-5 g/m², 
respectively. At 1.6-2.4g/m²/d, 12 to 18% of the dose was excreted as unchanged drug in the 
urine, whereas at a 5g/m² singl e-dose, 61% was excreted in the u rine as the parent drug. 
Evidence also exists to suggest that ifosfamide metabolism is i nducible, with more rapid 
clearance occurring i n the second and later doses when a course  of therapy is given as
fractionated doses over 3 to 5 days. T here is more chloroethyl side chain oxidation of ifosfamide 
(up to 50%) than of cyclophospha mide (<10%), and the degree of s uch metabolism is more 
variable than with cyclophosphamid e. Oxidation of the chloroethy l groups produces 
chloroacetaldehyde, which is thoug ht to be responsible for the n eurotoxicity and renal toxicity 
that have been seen with ifosfamide therapy.
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 43 of 71Formulation and Stability: Available in 1 g and 3 g single  dose vials of lyophilized white  
powder without preservatives. R econstitute with sterile water f or injection or bacteriostatic water 
for injection, 20ml for the 1gm vial or with 60mL for the 3gm v ial to produce a final 
concentration of 50mg/ml ifosfa mide. Although the reconstituted  product is stable for 7 days at 
room temperature and up to 6 week s under refrigeration, the manufacturer recommends 
refrigeration and use within 24 hours to reduce the possibility  of microbial contamination. Store 
unreconstituted vials at room temperature 20°-25°C (68°-77° F). Pro tect from temperatures 
above 30°C (86° F). Ifosfamide ma y liquefy at temperatures > 35 °C.
Guidelines for Administration: Solutions of ifosfamide ma y be diluted further to 
concentrations of 0.6 to 20 mg/ml i n dextrose or saline containi ng solutions. Such admixtures, 
when stored in large volume parenteral glass bottles, Viaflex b ags or PAB bags, are physically 
and chemically stable for 1 wee k at 30°C (86°F) or 6 weeks at 5 °C (41°F). The manufacturer 
recommends refrigeration and use within 24 hours to reduce the possibility of microbial 
contamination.
Supplier: Commercially available from various manufacturers. 
Pregnancy: Women should avoid becoming pregna nt while on therapy.  Breastf eeding should 
be discontinued during therapy.
Expected adverse events:
Central nervous system: Somnol ence, confusion, hallucinations i n 12% and coma (rare) 
have occurred and are usually reve rsible; usually occur with hi gher doses or in patients with 
reduced renal function; depressi ve psychoses, polyneuropathy. Note: CNS depression can 
be reversed with methylene blue  (50 mg intravenously) and methylene blue is recommended 
for prophylaxis for subsequent dos es if the patient has CNS man ifestations with the first 
dose. 
Dermatologic: Alopecia occurs  in 50% to 83% of patients 2-4 weeks after initiation of 
therapy; may be as high as 100% in combination therapy. Phlebit is, dermatitis, nail ridging, 
skin hyperpigmentation, impaired wound healing.
Gastrointestinal: Nausea a nd vomiting in 58% of patients is dose and schedule related (more 
common with higher doses and after bolus regimens); nausea and vomiting can persist up to 
3 days after therapy; also anor exia, diarrhea, constipation, tr ansient increase in LFTs and 
stomatitis noted. Genitourinary: Hemorrhagic cystitis has been frequently associa ted with the use of 
ifosfamide; a urinalysis prior to each dose should be obtained;  ifosfamide should never be 
administered without a ur oprotective agent (MESNA) ; hematuria has b een reported in 
6% to 92% of patients; renal toxic ity occurs in 6% of patients a nd is manifested as an 
increase in BUN or serum creatin ine and is most likely related to tubular damage; renal 
toxicity, including ARF, may occur more frequently with high-do se ifosfamide; metabolic 
acidosis may occur in up to 31% of patients.

10.3 Doxorubicin (Adriamycin®) NSC #123127 (042006)
Source and Pharmacology: An anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of Strepto myces
peucetius. The cytotoxic effe ct of doxorubicin on malignant cells and its toxic effects on various 
organs are thought to be relate d to nucleotide base intercalatio n and cell membrane lipid binding 
activities of doxorubicin. Intercalation inhibits nucleotide re plication and action of DNA and 
RNA polymerases. The interaction of doxorubicin with topoisomera se II to form DNA-cleavable 
complexes appears to be an impor tant mechanism of doxorubicin cy tocidal activity. Doxorubicin 
cellular membrane binding may aff ect a variety of cellular func tions. Enzymatic electron 
reduction of doxorubicin by a vari ety of oxidases, reductases an d dehydrogenases generate 
highly reactive species including the hydroxyl free radical OH• . Free radical formation has been 
implicated in doxorubicin cardiotox icity by means of Cu (II) an d Fe (III) reduction at the cellular 
level. Cells treated with dox orubicin have been shown to manife st the characteristic morphologic 
changes associated with apoptosis or programmed cell death. Doxo rubicin induced apoptosis 
may be an integral component of t he cellular mechanism of actio n relating to therapeutic effects, 
toxicities, or both. Doxorubicin serum decay pattern is multiph asic. The initial distributive t½ is 
approximately 5 minutes suggestin g rapid tissue uptake of doxor ubicin. The terminal t½ of 20 to 
48 hours reflects a slow eliminatio n from tissues. Steady-state distribution volumes exceed 20 to 
30 L/kg and are indicative of extensive drug uptake into tissues . Plasma clearance i s in the range 
of 8 to 20 ml/min/kg and is predominately by metabolism and biliary excretion. The P450 
Cytochromes which appear to be i nvolved with doxorubicin metabolism are CYP2D6 and
CYP3A4. Approximately 40% of the dose appears in the bile in 5 d ays, while only 5 to 12% of 
the drug and its metabolites appear in the urine during the sam e time period. Binding of
doxorubicin and its major meta bolite, doxorubicinol to plasma p roteins is about 74 to 76% and is 
independent of plasma concentration of doxorubicin.
Formulation and Stability: Doxorubicin is available as red-orange lyophilized powder for 
injection in 10mg, 20mg, 50mg, 150mg vials and a preservative fr ee 2mg/ml solution in 10mg, 
20mg, 50mg, 75mg, 200mg vials. Aqueous  Solution: Store refrigerat ed 2° to 8°C, (36° to 46°F). 
Protect from light. Retain in carton until contents are used. Pow der for injection: Store 
unreconstituted vial at room tem perature 15° to 30°C (59° to 86 °F). Retain in carton until 
contents are used. Reconstitute with preservative free normal sa line to a final concentration of 
2mg/ml. After adding the diluen t, the vial should be shaken and  the contents allowed to dissolve.  
The reconstituted solution is stable for 7 days at room tempera ture under normal room light and 
15 days under refrigeration 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F). Protect fro m exposure to sunlight.

Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 45 of 71Guidelines for Administration: Administer by IV push; by IV side arm into a running infusion; 
or doxorubicin may be further dilu ted in saline or dextrose cont aining solutions and administered 
by infusion. Protect final preparation from light. Avoid extravasation.
Supplier: Commercially available fr om various manufacturers.
Pregnancy: Women should avoid becoming pregna nt while on therapy.  Breastf eeding should 
be discontinued during therapy.
Expected adverse events:
Hematologic: Hematologic side e ffects have been reported in 60% to 80% of patients and 
they may be profound (depending  entirely on dose). While myelosuppression can affect all 
cell lines, leukopenia is mos t common, appearing in 60% to 75% of all treate d patients. 
Absolute white blood cell count s of less than 1,000/mm3 are not  uncommon after 
recommended therapeutic doses. Severe thrombocytopenia and anemi a may also occur.
Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal side effects have included ac ute nausea and vomiting in 
20% to 85% of patients. Stomatitis has been reported in up to 80% of patients, and is dose 
and schedule-related. Ulceration of the esophagus and the colon  (particularly the cecum) 
have also been reported. Anorex ia and diarrhea have been report ed in approximately 15% of 
patients. Rare cases of tongue hyperpigmentation have also been  associated with the use of 
doxorubicin.
Dermatologic: Alopecia, flushes, skin and nail hyperpigmentatio n, oncholysis (nail loss),
photosensitivity, hypersensitivity to irradiated skin.
Extravasation: Infiltration can cause severe inflammation, tissue necrosis, and ulceration.   If 
the drug is infiltrated, consult institutional policy, apply ic e to area, and elevate the limb .   
May require debridement.
Hypersensitivity:  Hypersensitivity reactions have occasionally  been reported, and may 
include fever, chills, urticaria, angioneurotic edema or anaphy laxis.  Local IV site "flares" 
can be confused with extravasa tion, but are probably due to all ergy to this drug. Flare 
reactions were reported in 3% t o 18% of patients, but are now ra re since the vehicle in 
which doxorubicin is carried has c hanged. Flare reactions are c haracterized by erythema, 
appear proximally along the af fected vein, and typically resolv e within 45 minutes. Pain, 
burning and adverse sequelae are in frequent or absent. Extravas ation, on the other hand, 
appears at the injection site and resolves slowly over days to weeks. As opposed to flare 
reactions, pain, burning, and ede ma are common, and adverse sequelae are variable and may
be serious.  Allergic reactions  have also been reported after t he intravesical administration 
of doxorubicin.
Renal: Renal insufficiency has  been associated with doxorubicin -induced hyperuricemia 
(secondary to cell lysis). Anima l data suggest that doxorubicin  may cause glomerular 
basement membrane injury via production of reactive oxygen spec ies. Renal side effects 
have included rare cases of new  or worsened renal insufficiency . A single case of rapidly 
progressive glomerulonephritis w ithout evidence of a secondary cause or immunologic 
mechanism has been reported.
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 46 of 71Ocular: Ocular side effects have  included rare cases of conjunct ivitis, periorbital edema, 
lacrimation, blepharospasm, ke ratitis, and decreased visual acu ity.
Genitourinary: Genitourinary side  effects including rare cases o f bladder contracture have 
been reported.
Musculoskeletal: Muscul oskeletal side effect s have been extremely rare. In one case, 
administration of doxorubicin was associated with a clinically significant flare of ankylosing 
spondylitis.
Cardiac: Anthracycline-induced cardiac toxicity may be manifeste d by early or late events.
Early cardiac toxicity consists mainly of sinus tachycardia and /or ECG abnormalities such 
as non-specific ST-T wave change s, but tachyarrhythmias, bradyc ardia, as well as 
atrioventricular and bundle-bra nch block have also been reporte d.  Although rhythm 
disturbances are common after acu te administration they are rar ely of clinical importance. 
Early effects of anthracyclines also include extremely rare cas es of pericarditis-myocarditis 
(which can affect patients wit h no prior history of cardiac disease and which carries a high 
mortality rate of about 20%),  and l eft ventricular dysfunction  (which may lead to clinically 
significant heart failure in pa tients with limited cardiac rese rve). Isolated cases of 
symptomatic supraventricular t achycardia, heart block, and vent ricular arrhythmias (some 
sudden and fatal) have also been r eported.  Cardiovascular side  effects have included 
congestive heart failure due to the developm ent of left ventricu lar (LV) systolic dysfunction 
in 1% to 2% of patients. Retrospec tive data have shown that the  incidence of clinical heart 
failure in patients with preexistin g LV systolic dysfunction (e jection fraction [LVEF] <
50%), who experienced a decline  of 10% or more in absolute LVEF , and who received at 
least 450 mg/m2 cumulative dose, i s approximately 16%. (Data ha ve shown right 
ventricular septal wall motion may also be affected and that LV  diastolic dysfunction may 
precede the development of doxorubi cin-induced LV systolic dysfunction.).
Secondary Leukemia:  The occurrence of secondary acute myelogen ous leukemia has been 
reported in patients treated with anthracyclines. 
Other: Radiation pneumonitis or es ophagitis may be more likely w ith the combination of 
doxorubicin and XRT than with XRT a lone. Prior cardiac or mediastinal XRT appears to 
portend a higher risk of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. Ot her side effects of 
doxorubicin have included the pr edisposition of patients who have previously received 
radiation therapy (XRT) to demons trate the so-called "recall" p henomenon
10.4 Mesna (sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulf onate,UCB 3983, Mesnex®) NSC #1138 91 
(012006)
Source and Pharmacology: Mesna was developed as a prophylactic agent to reduce the ris k of
hemorrhagic cystitis induced by if osfamide. Mesna is rapidly ox idized to its major metabolite, 
mesna disulfide (dimesna). Mesna di sulfide remains in the intrav ascular compartment and is 
rapidly eliminated by the kidneys. In the kidney, the mesna disu lfide is reduced to the free thiol 
compound, mesna, which reacts chemi cally with the urotoxic ifos famide metabolites (acrolein 
and 4-hydroxy-ifosfamide) resu lting in their detoxification. The  first step in th e detoxification 
process is the binding of mesna to 4-hydroxyifosfamide forming a nonurotoxic 4-
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 47 of 71sulfoethylthioifosfamide. Mesna also binds to the double bonds of acrolein and to other urotoxic 
metabolites. In multiple human xenograft or rodent tumor model studies, mesna in combination 
with ifosfamide (at dose ratio s of up to 20-fold as single or m ultiple courses) failed to 
demonstrate interference with a ntitumor efficacy.  After an 800 mg dose the half lives for Mesna 
and DiMesna are 0.36 hours and 1.17 hour s, respectively. Approxi mately 32% and 33% of the 
administered dose was eliminate d in the urine in 24 hours as mes na and dimesna, respectively. 
The majority of the dose recovered was eliminated within 4 hour s. Mesna tablets have an oral 
bioavailability of 45- 79% and a urinary bioavailability which r anged from 45-79% of
intravenously administered mesna . The oral bioavailability is u naffected by food. When 
compared to intravenously admin istered mesna, the intravenous pl us oral dosing regimen 
increases systemic exposures (150% ) and provides more sustained excretion of mesna in the 
urine over a 24-hour period.
Unknown Frequency and Timing : **Fetal toxicities and teratogen ic effects of mesna have not 
been noted in animals fed 10 time s the recommended human doses. T here are however no 
adequate and well controlled studi es in pregnant women. It is not known if mesna or dimesna is 
excreted into human milk.Guidelines for Administration: For IV administration, dilute  to 20 mg/mL with dextrose or 
saline containing solutions. Mes na may be mixed with ifosfamide  or cyclophosphamide. After 
dilution for administration, mesna  is physically and chemically  stable for 24 hours at 25ºC 
(77ºF).  Carefully expel air in syringes prepacked for use to a void oxidation to dimesna. Mesna
may cause false positive te st for urinary ketones.
Supplier: Commercially available from various manufacturers.
Pregnancy: Women should avoid becoming pregna nt while on therapy.  Breastf eeding should 
be discontinued during therapy.
Expected adverse events: 
Cardiovascular: Hypotension 
Central nervous system: Malaise, headache 
Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, na usea, vomiting, bad taste in mout h, soft stools 
Neuromuscular & skeletal: Limb pain 
Dermatologic: Skin rash, itching
10.5 Pegfilgrastim (pegylated filgrastim, PEG filgrastim, SD/01, Neulasta®) (072006)
Source and Pharmacology: Pegfilgrastim is the pegylated form of recombinant methionyl 
human G-CSF (filgrastim). Pegfilgrastim is produced by covalentl y binding a 20-kilodalton (kD) 
monomethoxypolyethylene glycol m olecule to the N-terminal methi onyl residue of filgrastim. 
The molecular weight of pegfilgrastim is 39 kD. G-CSF is a line age specific colony-stimulating 
factor which regulates the pr oduction of neutrophils within the bone marrow and affects 
neutrophil progenitor prolifer ation, differentiation, and selec ted end-cell functional activation 
(including enhanced phagocytic a bility, priming of the cellular  metabolism associated with 
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 48 of 71respiratory burst, antibody dep endent killing, and the increased expression of some functions 
associated with cell surface antigens). After subcutaneous injec tion the eliminati on half-life of 
pegfilgrastim ranges from 15 to 80 hours and the time to peak c oncentration ranges from 24 to 
72 hours. Serum levels are sustai ned in most patients during th e neutropenic period 
postchemotherapy, and begin to dec line after the start of neutr ophil recovery, consistent with 
neutrophil-dependent elimination.
Formulation and Stability: Supplied as a preservative-free solution containing 6 mg (0.6ml ) of
pegfilgrastim (10mg/ml) in a s ingle-dose syringe with 27 g, ½ i nch needle with an UltraSafe® 
Needle Guard. Store refrigerate d at 2-8º C (36-46ºF) and in the  carton to protect from light. Prior 
to injection, pegfilgrastim may  be allowed to reach room temper ature protected from light for a 
maximum of 48 hours. Avoid freezing.Guidelines for Administration: Pegfilgrastim should not be administered in the period 
between 2 weeks before and 24 hours after chemotherapy. Do not s hake.
Supplier: Commercially available from various manufacturers
Pregnancy: Women should avoid becoming pregna nt while on therapy.  Breastf eeding should 
be discontinued during therapy.
Expected Adverse Events:
Bone pain was the most frequent  adverse event attributable to p egfilgrastim in clinical trials.  
Hypoxia was observed in one patie nt. Toxicities associated with  the parent compound, filgrastim 
include:
Central nervous system: N eutropenic fever, fever.
Dermatologic: Alopecia.
Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, spleno megaly (this occurs more 
commonly in patients with cycli c neutropenia/congenital agranul ocytosis who received S.C. 
injections for a prolonged (>14 days) period of time; ~33% of t hese patients experience 
subclinical splenomegaly; ~3% of  these patients experience clin ical splenomegaly).
Neuromuscular & skeletal: Medu llary bone pain (24% incidence--t his occurs most 
commonly in lower back pain, posterior iliac crest, and sternum  and is controlled with non-
narcotic analges ics), weakness.
Cardiovascular: Chest pain, fluid retention, transient supravent ricular arrhythmia, 
pericarditis.
Central nervous system: Headache.
Dermatologic: Skin rash.
Gastrointestinal: Anorexia, stomatitis, constipation.
Hematologic: Leukocytosis.
Local: Pain at injec tion site, thrombophlebitis.
Respiratory: Dyspnea, cough, sore throat.
Miscellaneous: Anaphylactic reaction .

Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 49 of 7111.0 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY
Evaluability: In order for a pat ient to be evaluable, 80% of th e intended dose of all three 
drugs must be delivered in the first 2 cycles of chemotherapy.
11.1 Pharmacodynamic Studies
The primary endpoint of the study i s to evaluate the absolute va lues and changes in maximum 
standardized uptake values of tum ors measured by FDG-PET pre- an d post receipt of pazopanib
versus placebo, and post receipt of 2 cycles of preoperative ch emotherapy. This will be 
compared to tumor response by RECIST criteria.
FDG PET
PET imaging will be performed at  baseline, after the 14 day Run-in Period with pazopanib 
versus placebo and after 2 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  Imaging studies will be 
performed on the SCCA GE discovery  LS PET/CT imaging device oper ating in a two-
dimensional high-sensitivity  mode with 35 imaging planes per ax ial field of view of 15 cm 
(plane thickness 4.25 mm) and a n in-plane resolution of 4 to 5 mm.
The UW/SCCA will follow FDG-PET protocol consensus recommendatio ns[53] and PET 
Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST), version 1.0.[54]
Key elements of PERCIST include  performance of PET scans in a m ethod consistent with the
National Cancer Institute recommendations. Patients will fast for  at least 4–6 h before 
undergoing scanning, and the measur ed serum glucose level (no cor rection) must be less than 
200 mg/dL. The patients may be on oral hypoglycemics but not on  insulin. A baseline PET scan 
will be obtained at 50–70 min after  tracer injection. The follow-u p scan should be obtained 
within 15 min (but always 50 min or  later) of the baseline scan . All scans will be performed on 
the same PET scanner with the same injected dose +/- 20% of radioa ctivity. 
Appropriate atte nuation correction along w ith evaluation for proper PET and CT registration of 
the quantitated areas w ill be performed. SUV will be corrected for  lean body 
mass (SUL) and should not be correct ed for serum glucose levels (glucose corrections have been 
variably useful, and errors in glu cometer measurements are well known and may add 
errors). The SUL will be dete rmined for up to 5 tumors (up to 2 per organ) with the most 
intense18F-FDG uptake.  The SUV peak (this is a sphere with a diameter o f approximately 1.2 
cm—to produce a 1-cm3-volume spheric ROI) centering  around the hottest point in the t umor 
foci will be determined, and the image planes  and coordinates wi ll be noted (SUL peak). This 
SUL peak ROI will typically include the maximal SUL pixel (whic h should also be recorded) but 
is not necessarily centered on the maximal SUL pixel. Automated methods for searching for this 
peak region will be used. Tumor sizes will be noted and should be  2 cm or larger in diameter for 
accurate measurement, though smaller lesions of sufficient 18F-F DG uptake, including those not 
well seen anatomically, can be  assessed. Each baseline (pretrea tment) tumor SUL peak must be 
1.5 x mean liver SUL + 2 SDs of mean S UL. If the liver is diseased,  2.0 x blood-pool 18F-FDG 
activity + 2 SDs in the mediastinum will be used as minimal metabol ically measurable tumor 
activity.[54]
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 50 of 71Serial PET will measure the SUV (SUV lean or SUL) peak for up to 5 target lesions in order to 
assess FDG uptake pre-therapy , after a 14 day Run-in period of p azopanib versus placebo, and 
after 2 cycles of chemotherapy. Analysis of changes in SUV from baseline and after treatment 
with pazopanib versus placebo and t hen again after chemotherapy  will test whether 
antiangiogenic therapy has anti-tumor efficacy as monotherapy a nd if so, what is its relative 
contribution to a decline in tumor  metabolism compared to chemo therapy.
RECIST
The radiographic response of the primary tumor to preoperative therapy will be evaluated.  For 
subjects with stage II (T2a) or III disease, the primary lesion  will serve as the sole target lesion 
and will be recorded and measured at baseline.  RECIST measurem ents will be performed on 
serial MRIs to evaluate th e correlation with FDG-PET.
For patients with stage IV disease, target lesions will be chos en according to RECIST 
procedure. The longest diameter (LD) of the target lesions will  be measured and reported as the 
baseline LD. The baseline LD will be used as reference to furth er characterize the objective 
tumor response of the measurable  dimension of the disease. This will be compared to changes in 
SUV on FDG PET.  Response and progression will be evaluated in this  study  using  the new 
international criteria proposed  by the Response Evaluation Crit eria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 
Committee.[55] Changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensio nal measurement) of the 
tumor lesions are used in the RECIST 1.1 criteria.
11.2 Pharmacokinetic Studies
Trough level (22-24 hrs after pa zopanib dosing): A blood sample  will be drawn to assess the 
trough plasma pazopanib concentr ation during the 14 day Run-in period of pazopanib 
monotherapy (2 samples), after c ompletion of adjuvant chemother apy (2 samples), and every 3 
months thereafter until comple tion of pazopanib maintenance the rapy (4 samples).  If all trough 
levels are drawn, a total of 8 samples are possible in a single  subject. The trough levels will be 
compared for any differences  over time and will be  correlated w ith the change in SUV from 
FDG PET and with the change in R ECIST measurements on MRIs. 
In subjects consenting to the op tional full intensive pharmacokinetic visit during Weeks 2-4
following surgery/adjuvant che motherapy, blood will be obtained at the following timepoints: 
immediately before pazopanib dosing (within 5 minutes before gi ving pazopanib on the day of 
PK dosing) and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 hour timepoints (+/- 10 minutes) , and 24 hrs (range 22 to 24 
hours) after dosing (a total of 8 samples/subject).
Pazopanib pharmacokine tic parameters of max imum observed plasma  concentration (Cmax), 
the time to Cmax (peak time, Tma x), the area under the plasma con centration-time curve 
(AUC0-24hr), concentration at th e end of the dosing interval (C tr), oral clearance (CL/F), 
volume of distribution (Vd/F), and half-life (t 1/2) will be determined usin g noncompartmental 
methods. The correlatio n between trough concentrations and AUC will also be evaluated.
11.3 Efficacy Variables
11.3.1 FDG Criteria for Tumor Response
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 51 of 71Determination of SUV (SUV lean or  SUL) of the primary tumor and metastases will be 
performed, for up up to 5 target lesions, and for non-target le sions.  FDG changes of 
more than 25% from baseline cannot be attributed to the impreci sion of the technique and 
are therefore regarded as true c hanges in tumor glucose metabol ism.[54] FDG criteria for 
tumor response will be as per th e PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) 
criteria.[54] PERCIST includes a specific percentage reduction i n the SUV (SUV lean, 
or SUL) from baseline.  Response to therapy is assessed as a co ntinuous variable and 
expressed as percentage change in SUL peak (or sum of lesion SU Ls) between the pre-
and post treatment scans.  A complete metabolic response is def ined as visual 
disappearance of all metabolically active tumor. A partial resp onse is considered more 
than a 30% and a 0.8-unit decline in SUL peak between the most intense lesion before 
treatment and the most intense lesion  after treatment, althoug h not necessarily the same 
lesion.  More than a 30% and 0.8-unit increase is SUL peak or new lesions is classified as 
progressive disease.
11.3.2 RECIST Criteria for Tumor Response
Response criteria will be asse ssed using RECIST (version 1.1).[ 55]
Evaluation of target lesions:
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the  longest 
diameter (LD) of target lesions , taking as reference the baseli ne sum LD
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since  the treatment started or 
the appearance of one  or more new lesions
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest su m LD since the treatment 
started
Evaluation of best overall response:
The best overall response is the best response achieved prior t o surgical resection of the 
target lesion.
Target Lesions New Lesions Overall Response
CR No CR
PR No PR
SD No SD
PD Yes or No PD
Any Yes PD
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 52 of 71Note:
In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish resid ual disease from normal 
tissue.  When the evaluation of c omplete response depends upon this determination, 
this will be determined at the time of surgical resection.
11.3.3 Pathologic Response at Surgery
All specimens of primary  tumor will be examin ed for pathologic response at the time of 
surgery.  The study pathologist will estimate the amount of via ble tumor, and report the 
percentage of necrosis.  For purpos e of analysis, tumors will b e classified as either 
t95% necrosis or <95% necrosis.
11.3.4 Duration of Response/Stable Disease
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or 
progressive disease is objectivel y documented (taking as refere nce for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements  recorded since the treatment started).
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measuremen t criteria are first 
met for CR until the first date t hat recurrent disease is objec tively documented.
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment unti l the criteria for 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measureme nts recorded since the 
treatment started. 
11.3.5 Definition of Disease Progression
Disease progression will be defined as:
xRadiologic progression of disease by FDG PET PERCIST 1.0 criter ia
xRadiologic progression of disease by RECIST (version 1.1) criteri a.
11.3.6 Time-to-Event Measures
Time to Local Recurrence- Defined as the duration of time from s urgical resection of 
the primary tumor until local rec urrence (amputated patients excluded).
Local Disease-Free Survival- Defined as the duration of time fro m surgical resection of 
the primary tumor until local rec urrence or death, whichever occurs first.
Distant Disease-Free Survival - Defined as the duration of time f rom randomization
until development of distant metastatic disease or death, which ever occurs first.  
Subjects with stage IV disease will be censored from this analy sis.
Disease-Free Survival - Defined as the duration of time from surg ical resection to local 
recurrence, distant metastatic disease, or death, whichever occ urs first.  Subjects with 
stage IV disease will be censored from this analysis.
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 53 of 71Progression-Free Survival - Defined as the duration of time from randomization to 
progressive disease (per RECIST), local recurrence, distant met astatic disease 
(exclusive of stage IV subject s), or death, whichever occurs first.
Overall Survival - Defined as the interval of time from randomiza tion until death from 
any cause.
11.4 Determining Response to Pazop anib for Continuing on Mainten ance
Subjects who have a partial re sponse by either RECIST 1.1 crite ria on CT or MRI, 
and/or PERCIST 1.0 criteria by FDG PET after the 14 day Run-in period on pazopanib 
will have the option to remain on pazopanib for one year of the rapy following surgery 
and adjuvant chemoth erapy/radiation.
12.0 DATA MANAGEMENT/CONFIDENTIALITY
The Investigator will ensure that data collected conform to all  established guidelines.  Each subject is 
assigned a unique patient numbe r to assure subject confidential ity.  Subjects will not be referred to by 
this number, by name, or by any other individual identifier in any publication or external presentation.
The licensed medical records department, affiliated with the in stitution where the subject receives 
medical care, maintains all or iginal inpatient and outpatient c hart documents.  
Subject research files including  paper and electronic case repor t forms, diagnostic pathology reports, and 
lab tests will be stored in a secure location that protects conf idential information.
13.0 CORRELATIVE STUDIESPlasma will be collected for measurement of VEGF and soluble VEGFR2 (sVEGFR2) at baseline, after 
the 14 day Run-in period of paz opanib, after completion of neoa djuvant chemotherapy and every 3 
months thereafter until comple tion of pazopanib maintenance the rapy, when indicated.  
Quantitative enzyme-linked immunosor bent assays (ELISA) for VEG F and sVEGFR2 will be
performed on plasma and tumor extracts.
MicroRNAs have been shown to be pr omising blood and tissue-base d markers for cancer detection.[56]
An extension of this is that suc h markers may also be excellent  candidates for measuring response to 
therapy.  There are currently  no validated biomarkers to predict response to antiangiogenic therapy.
Consequently, the ability to test candidate microRNA biomarkers before, during and after neoadjuavnt 
systemic therapy offers an ideal setting to assess potential bi omarkers. Blood samples  will be collected 
for micro RNA at baseline, a fter the 14 day Run-in period of pazopanib, following neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy and every 3 months  thereafter until completion of pazopanib maintenance therapy, when 
indicated.Samples to be teste d will be an additional  3 tablespoons of whole  blood (23cc) at each time of clinical 
lab draw, collected as 10cc int o EDTA tubes (plasma), 10cc into  serum separator tubes, and 3cc into 
Tempus tubes (containing an RNA stabilizer).
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 54 of 71There may also be evaluation of other potential predictive and prognostic markers using analysis of 
protein, DNA and RNA from s urgical tumor tissue.
14.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
14.1 Analysis plan
The primary objective is to compare  FDG SUV (SUV lean, SUL) meas ures for patients receiving 
pazopanib and placebo.  Th e primary endpoint is the percent cha nge in SUV between baseline 
and the end of the 14-day Run- in period of pazopanib or placebo .  The comparison will likely be 
conducted using a two-sided Wilc oxon rank sum test, often used a s a nonparametric alternative 
to the two-sample t-test for st udies with a small sample size.  Additional endpoints will include 
SUV percentage change between b aseline and the end of preoperat ive therapy, absolute post-
treatment SUV (at 14 days and fo llowing preoperative chemothera py), and absolute difference in 
SUV.  
The analysis sample for the pr imary pharmacodynamic analysis is  expected to e xclude patients 
who have incomplete data due to missed PET scans or due to stud y withdrawal for toxicity.   
However, reasons for missing  data will be exa mined, and multiple imputation will be considered 
if patients with incomplete data would be c onsidered as part of  the target population for future 
development of pazopanib in sarco ma.  However, insofar as sarcoma is heterogeneous, the 
sample size is sma ll, and covariates are  limited – multiple impu tation may not be applicable.
These pharmacodynamic response m easures will be compared to tum or response by RECIST 
criteria, using graphical displ ays.  Continuous measures of pha rmacodynamic response 
(percentage change in SUL; response assessed using MRI) will also be compared to the trough 
plasma pazopanib, using graphical displays and correlation coef ficients to investigate dose-
response relationships relate d to patients’ differing metabolis m of pazopanib.
Descriptive displays of preliminar y clinical endpoints (patholo gic response, progression-free 
survival, overall survival) will compare response for the pazop anib and placebo groups, and will 
investigate the relationship betw een early pharmacodynamic resp onse (by PET) and clinical 
endpoints.  Response of high-ris k soft tissue sarcoma to neoadj uvant chemoradiation therapy was 
estimated as 52% (38% no residua l tumor, 14% >=95 pathologic ne crosis) in a series of 496 
patients.[9] A smaller seri es found only 13/46 (28%) with <10% viable tumor in surgical 
specimens following a variety of neoadjuvant regimens.[51] To direct planning of future studies,we will measure the rate of comp lete pathological response defi ned as greater than 95% necrosis 
in the surgical excision spec imen. A 90% Wilson ( score) binomial  confidence interval will be 
computed for the rate of com plete pathological response.
There are no stopping rules planne d for toxicity, but safety wi ll be monitored continuously. All 
subjects who are registered and receive at least one dose of st udy drug will be included in the 
safety analysis.

Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 55 of 71All reported adverse e vents will be coded usin g the Cancer Ther apy Evaluation Program (CTEP) 
Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0.  The number and percent of  subjects reporting adverse 
events (all, severe or worse, serious and related) will be quan tified.  Listings w ill be provided for 
all on-study deaths and adverse ev ents that lead to withdrawal from study.  Narratives of all 
serious adverse events and d eaths on-study will be provided.  
Correlative study assays will be a nalyzed using descriptive sta tistics, generally comparing 
pazopanib and placebo groups. Corre lation will also be evaluate d between pazopanib trough 
concentrations and drug exposure  over the dosing interval (area -under-the-concentration-curve, 
AUC) in subjects consenting to the  full intensive pharmacokinet ic visits.
14.2 Sample size justification
If the standard deviation for pe rcent change in is 20% and the average change is 0% for placebo 
and a 30% decrease for pazopanib, t here will be approximately 90%  power to detect a difference 
between the placebo and pazopani b group in average percent chan ge for n=21 and a 2:1 
randomization.

When drugs classified as ‘substrates’ are co-administered with (Study Agent) , there is the potential for higher concentrations of the ‘subs trate’. When  (Study 
Agent) is co-administered with compounds classified as ‘inhibitors’, i ncreased plasma concentrations of  (Study Agent) is the potential outcome. The 
coadministration of ‘inducers’ would potentially lower plasma   (Study Agent) concentrations.

When drugs classified as ‘substrates’ are co-administered with (Study Agent) , there is the potential for higher concentrations of the ‘subs trate’.  When  (Study 
Agent) is co-administered with compounds classified as ‘inhibitors’, i ncreased plasma concentrations of  (Study Agent) is the potential outcome.  The 
coadministration of ‘inducers’ would potentially lower plasma   (Study Agent) concentrations.

Blood Pressure – Recommendations
for Data Collection/Recording and Event Management
Collection/Recording of B lood Pressure Information
1.0 General Guidelines
1.1          Frequency of monitoring. Blood pressure (BP) should  be monitored at least every 2 weeks for the duration of 
treatment.  More frequent monitoring should be considered on a study by study basis, particularly during the 
first two cycles of pazopanib therapy.
1.2          Data recording. All requ ired data should be recorde d in the appropriate CRF or on the subject’s blood pressure 
monitoring diary, as appropriate.  The following data are required at baseline and at each subsequ ent 
assessment :
xAssessment date and time
xPulse
xSystolic and diastolic BP (2 readings/assessment taken 5 minutes  apart while subject sitting)
1.3          Risk factors for hypertension (assess and record da ta in baseline history/physical CRF)
xDiabetes (type 1 or type 2)
xRenal disease (specify on CRF)
xEndocrine condition associated with HTN (specify on CRF)
xUse of steroids or NSAIDs (specify all concomitant meds)
xUnderlying cardiovascular condition – specify ( i.e., ischemic heart disease)
2.0         Baseline data col lection (at study entry)
2.1 All subjects
xCurrent BP
xProteinuria, if present
2.2 Subjects with preexisting hypertension ( i.e., those for whom “hypertension” is entered as a concomitant 
condition at study entry, or those who are currently receiving therapy with antihypertensive medication) – also 
record:
xDate of HTN diagnosis (original)
xType HTN (essential or secondary)
xCTCAE grade of HTN (at time of study entry)
xTrade name, drug class*, dose, dose frequency, start/stop dates /ongoing of the following:
Antihypertensive agents taken at study entry
Antihypertensive agents taken in past ( e.g., discontinued for toxicity, lack of efficacy)
3.0         Follow up BP data collection (during study)
3.1 All subjects (at each clinic visit)
xCurrent BP
xProteinuria, if present
3.2 Subjects with treatment-emergent hypertension [defined as BP increase of >20 mmHg (diastolic) OR BP 
>150/100 (if previously within normal limits)] – record at time of hypertension diagnosis and at all subsequent 
clinic visits:
xBP changes from baseline (or from previous assessment) (specify  CTCAE grade changes)
xHypertension-related symptoms as reported by subject ( e.g., headache)
xOther relevant changes associated with development of hypertens ion (e.g., ECG abnormalities)
xTrade name, drug class*, dose, dose frequency, start/stop dates/ongoing of currently prescribed 
antihypertensive agents
7487
Version 8.0 02Mar2016 Page 71 of 713.3 Subjects with preexisting hyp ertension at study entry – record  at each clinic visit
xBP changes from previous clinic visit (specify CTCAE grade chan ges)
xHypertension-related symptoms reported by subject ( e.g., headache)
xOther relevant changes associated with development of hypertens ion (e.g., ECG abnormalities)
xChanges in antihypertensive medications since last assessment ( e.g., dose change, add/discontinue 
drug)
Classes of antihypertensive drugs include ACE inhibitors, calci um channel blockers, alpha block ers, beta blockers, diuretics, 
and angiotension II receptor antagonists.

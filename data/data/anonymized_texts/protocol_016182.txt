CDAI scores and/or inflammatory markers  
 To assess the effects of V565 based on changes in Abdominal Pain and Stool Frequency instrument 
(PRO -2) scores  
 To assess safety and tolerability of V5 65 
Pharmacokinetic Objectives : 
 To determine  the concentration of V565 in serum  and urine  
Exploratory Objectives : 
 To assess the proportion of subjects achieving CRP  or FCP levels  within normal limits  
 To assess changes in CDAI scores and CRP  or FCP levels  over time  
 To determine change s in anti -V565 antibody titre  
 To evaluate the frequency of loose or watery stools, assessed using the Bristol Stool Form Scale 
(BSFS)  
 To evaluate changes in abdominal pain using the Numeric Pain Scale (NPS)  
 To evaluate changes in faecal urgency  
Exploratory Endoscopy Substudy  Objectives : 
 To investigate the effect of V565 on changes in endoscopic mucosal appearance, evaluated with an 
overall assessment and the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES -CD), as determined 
by a central reader

02 December 2016   Confidential  Methodology:  This study will be a multiple -site, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group 
proof -of-concept study in approximately 126 subjects with active CD. This study will include subjects who 
have a confirmed diagnosis of CD for at least three  months and have CD involving the ileum and/or colon . 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in detail in subsequent sections .  
The duration of treatment will be 42 days ( six weeks ); each subject’s participation in the study will be 
approximately 12 weeks . This includ es a screening period of up to 28 days , a treatment period of 42 days  and 
a follow -up period of 14 days after the last dose of study drug .  
Subjects will be randomised in to two treatment arms : either V565 or placebo us ing a 2:1 active:  placebo 
ratio. Randomisation will be stratified  to ensure treatment groups have similar rates of prior anti -tumour 
necrosis factor alpha ( TNF α) therapy .  
Subjects will receive three V565  185 mg capsules three times daily or  matching placebo , for 42 days . The 
total daily  V565 dose is 1665 mg.  
Subjects will be treated with study drug as an add -on to any  permitted  stable medications already being taken 
for CD. No alteration of background CD medication will be permitted for the duration of the study .  
There are six study visits . Two screening visits to assess  eligibility will occur during Days -28 to Day -1; 
these are Visit  1 (start of screening), and Visit 2 (eligibility ileocolonoscopy ). Additional study visits will 
occur on Day 1 (randomisation and initiation of treatment), Day 14 (Interim Visit), Day 42  (End of 
Treatment  Visit ), and Day 56  (Follow up  Visit ).  
Collection of subject -reported variab les of the CDAI will be via diaries given to the subject at Visit  1. Prior 
to Visit 2, the subject -reported variables will be combined with the variables collected at the site on Visit 1 
and the CDAI score will be calculated. In order to have an ileocolono scopy, e ligible subjects must have 
sufficient diary entries to cal culate a CDAI score, a CDAI score ≥220 to ≤450 and a CRP ≥5  mg/L (or if CRP 
is normal, FCP ≥250  µg/g) prior to Visit 2 .  
A previous ileocolonoscopy conducted within 12 weeks before Visit 1 may be substituted for the Visit 2 
ileocolonoscopy provided it is forwarded to the central reader and was performed in such a way as to enable 
evaluation by the central reader .  
The Visit 2 ileocolonoscopy will be  evaluated by a central reader for to assess the overall appearance of the 
mucosa for the presence of active d isease and scored using the SES -CD. Active disease must be confirmed 
by the central reader for the subject to proceed to Visit 3 and to be randomi sed on Day 1 .   
The efficacy of V565 will be evaluated by assessing CDAI  scores , biomarkers ( CRP  or FCP), and  the 
PRO -2.  
Exploratory efficacy measures include changes in CDAI scores , changes in CRP  (or FCP) values  over time , 
the frequency of loose or watery stools  as measured by the BS FS, the degree of abdominal pain as measured 
by the NPS, and changes in faecal  urgency . This study will also evaluate the immunogenicity of V565 .  
In an exploratory endoscopy substudy, subjects with more severe disease at the Visit 2 ileocolonoscopy 
(a SES-CD ≥7, if ileum and colon are involved or ≥4 if only the ileum is involved) will undergo a second 
ileocolonoscopy at the end of treatment (Day 42)  to evaluate changes in the mucosa . 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluations will be based on concentrations of V5 65 measured  in serum and urine .   
Safety will be assessed through evaluations of adverse events ( AEs), clinical laboratory results, vital signs, 
physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and concomitant medications.  
Planned n umber of subjects:  Approximately 126 randomised to receive study drug in a 
2:1 active:placebo ratio (84:42)   
Approx imately 114 to complete ( 76:38)  based on an estimated dropout  
rate of 10% during treatment

throughout the study  
Pharmacokinetic Endpoint : 
 Serum and urine concentration of V565  prior to firs t administration of study drug and at Day 14, 
Day 42 , and Day 56 . In addition, On Day 1, a post -dose urine sample will be obtained at the site 
4 to 8 hours after the first dose of study drug .   
Explorator y Endpoints : 
 Proportion of subjects achieving CRP or FCP  levels within normal limits at Day 14 and Day 42  
 Changes from Baseline in CDAI score over time  
 Changes from Baseline in CRP or FCP levels over time  
 Change from Baseline in anti -V565 antibody titre at Day 14, Day 42, and Day 56  
 Changes from Baseline in the frequency of loose or watery stools (Type 6 or Type 7) as measured 
by the BSFS  
 Changes from Baseline in the abdominal NPS  
 Changes from Baseline in faecal urgency  
Exploratory Endoscopy Substudy Endpoints:  
 Changes from Baseline in endoscopic mucosal appearance after 42 days treatment  evaluated by 
changes in overall mucosal appearance and changes in SES-CD as determined by a central reader . 
Note: t his substudy will be limited to subjects with a base line SES -CD ≥7 (if ileum and colon are 
involved) or  ≥4 (if only ileum is involved ).  
Statistical methods:  
Determination of sample size : 
The sample size is based on being able to claim superiority of V565 over placebo; the primary endpoint is 
defined as a response ra te, based on CDAI reduction/remission and CRP  or FCP results.  
It is assumed that the proportion of subjects assigned to placebo treatment who respond is 0.15. A clinically 
important response rate on V565 is defined as 0.4. A 2:1 (V565:placebo) allocation,  80% power and 5% 
statistical significance rate estimate 76:38 evaluable subjects will be required for this study. With a 10% 
estimated non -evaluable rate, it is planned to assign 126 subjects (84:42) to randomised treatment.  
Sample size estimates are base d on a Pearson chi -square test for two proportions and  generated using SAS 
Power and Sample Size v13.2.  
A subgroup of subjects will be assessed by endoscopy for changes in overall mucosal appearance and 
changes in SES-CD. However, the study is not powered to show a difference in these  endpoint s. 
Statistical Analysis : 
As appropriate, variables will be summarised descriptively (frequency and percent age will be summarised for 
categorical variables; mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum, and maximum wi ll be presented for 
continuous variables) by study visit and by treatment group. All study data will be listed by subject.  
A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) including dictionaries used for coding and software used will be 
finalised prior to the in itial unblinding of the study.

Drug Name: V565  
02 December 2016   Confidential  Efficacy  
The primary endpoint will be analysed using a logistic regression model with treatment as the fixed effect 
and prior anti -TNFα  therapy , baseline CDAI score, baseline CRP and baseline FCP values as covariates. For 
the active treatment versus placebo compari son, the results will be presented in terms of an odds ratio 
together with its associated 95% confidence interval ( CI) and 2 -sided p -value. Two -sided 95% CIs for the 
odds ratio will be provided . 
Unless otherwise specified, the proportions of subjects fulfi lling the relevant requirements will be presented 
with 95% CIs for all the primary and secondary endpoints.  
Safety  
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and will be tabulated 
in incidence tables by System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term.  
AEs will be summarised by SOC, Preferred Term, and treatment  group . AEs will be further summarised by 
maximum severity and relationship to study medication. Prior and concomitant medications will be 
summarised by treatment. Other routine safety assessments such as vital signs, ECG and safety laboratory 
tests will be summarised by treatment group using statistics for continuous or categorical data, as appropriate.  
Pharmacokinetics  
The drug concentration results in serum  and urine will be summarised by planned sampling time and 
treatment group.

2.1 Background Information  
Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) includes both Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis 
as well as  other less prevalent, destructive diseases of the gastrointestinal ( GI) tract. Crohn’s 
disease is characterised by a chronic, relapsing, progressive course of intestinal inflammation 
and damage and generally begins in young adulthood. The incidence and pre valence of CD is 
increasing worldwide with current incidence of 6 to 15/100,000 and prevalence estimated at 
50 to 200/100,000 [1]. The highest incidences of CD have been reported in northern Europe, 
the UK and N orth America suggesting common etiological factors, but the rate of growth is 
increasing rapidly  in other parts of the world [2].  
The aetio -pathogenesis of CD is not fully understood but genetic and environment al factors 
interact to promote an excessive and poorly controlled mucosal inflammatory response 
against components of gut micro -flora. The excessive production of proinflammatory 
cytokines within mucosal and sub -mucosal tissues drives chronic inflammatory processes 
within the gut wall that are responsible for development of the disease immunopathology. 
Evidence from clinical studies with systemically delivered anti -tumour  necrosis factor alpha 
(TNFα ) antibodies has clearly established that blocking the biological effects of TNFα is 
beneficial in the treatment of CD and has confirmed the central importance of this master 
proinflammatory cytokine as a mediator of disease pathogenesis.  
If disease co ntrol is inadequate, the chronic inflammation leads to significant inflammatory, 
infectious and structural complications. The complications result in an increased need for 
hospitalisation and surgery, impaired quality of life , and disease -related mortality . For 
example , in CD approximately half of all patients will experience an intestinal complication 
within 20 years, often leading to the need for surgical intervention [3]. Moreover, persistent 
and extensive int estinal inflammation increases the risk of developing small bowel and 
colorectal carcinoma [4].  
The traditional goal of treatment in IBD is to first induce, and then to maintain, clinical 
remission. Therapeutic  decisions tend to be driven by the absence of clinical symptoms but 
accumulating data show that achieving this goal does not necessarily determine the 
subsequent clinical course of the disease or prevent the damaging long-term sequelae [5, 6]. 
The goal for therapy has thus shifted to include achieving healing of the gut mucosa with a 
view to reducing disability and bowel damage. The conventional strategy adopted for 
treatment  (stepwise, sequential introduction of therapies starting with the least expensive and 
least systemically active medications and then gradually intensifying therapy ) is being 
challenged because it is associated with lower efficacy, disease progress ion, a potentially 
higher risk of infections and, in moderate to severe disease, increased mortality. The use of 
VHsquared Ltd   16 
Protocol V56502  
Drug Name: V565  
02 December 2016   Confidential  this conventional treatment strategy increases  the likelihood that structural complications will 
develop before therapies proven to prevent suc h complications are introduced.  
Parenterally administered TNFα monoclonal antibodies such as infliximab, adalimumab and 
certolizumab pegol have been validated as transformative CD therapies that can affect  disease 
progression and improve long-term outcomes . They are utilised for inductio n of a clinical 
response, remission, prevention of relapse, corticosteroid sparing and mucosal healing in 
patients with moderate to severely active CD. Data have accumulated to support the case for 
earlier intervention with these systemic TNFα biologics. O bservational, subgroup analyses 
and randomised control trial data, both in adults and in paediatric populations, indicate that 
TNFα antagonists are much more effective when given to patients within 1 to 2 years of 
initial diagnosis and that early intervent ion prior to prolonged steroid administration 
improves clinical outcomes [6, 7, 8].  
Therefore, t he goal of therapy has expanded  from just the control of symptoms to include the 
prevention of disease . Further, the  indications are that the earlier a potent, safe, disease 
modifying TNFα antagonist therapy can be provided to patients, the better the outcomes. 
However, the only biological agents to date that have been shown to be capable of achieving 
this goal are severely restricted to patients who have either failed  or not responded to 
conventional therapy. Only a minority of patients  with CD currently receive systemic 
anti-TNF α therapy  and they are generally used as second or third line agents. Two major 
barriers to expanded use across a wider spectrum of patients with CD are cost and safety 
concerns. In addition, immunogenicity is a major issue that affects  the durability of r esponse 
seen with systemic anti -TNFα biologics . This may result  in both primary and secondary loss 
of response and lead to cycling between different products.  
VHsquared Ltd. (hereinafter, the “Sponsor”) is developing an orally active, protease 
stabilised, engineered domain antibody against TNFα that may deliver significant advantages 
over current systemically administered anti -TNFα agents. The enhanced safety profile 
provided by local targeting and minimal systemic exposure and the expected low 
immunogenici ty has the potential to provide the proven efficacy benefits of anti -TNFα 
therapy to a wider spectrum of patients. It may allow earlier intervention in the disease 
course , thus potentially maximising the clinical benefit of TNFα inhibit ion. The minimal 
systemic exposure would promote use in paediatrics and pregnancy, areas where parenteral 
administration and lack of a safe potent oral formulation are currently problematic.  
The multi -particulate V565 oral formulation planned for further clinical use has bee n 
evaluated in a toxicology programme with dosing up to six weeks, and a Phase 1 clinical 
study including 49 healthy volunteers and subject s with dosing up to 14 days. Results from 
these studies support further investigation of V565 as a potential therapy for CD. 
The Phase 1 study was conducted in four parts:  
VHsquared Ltd   17 
Protocol V56502  
Drug Name: V565  
02 December 2016   Confidential  In Part 1 (n=29) 19 healthy volunteers received a single dose of V565 at a dose of either 
62 mg (n=4), 185  mg (n=4), 555  mg (n=3), 1665  mg (n=4), 4995  mg (n=4), or placebo 
(n=10) in a conventional sing le ascending dose design.  
In Part 2 (n=10) eight healthy volunteers received multiple doses of V565 (1665 mg three 
times a day [ TID]) and two received placebo TID for 14 days. The objectives were to assess 
safety and tolerability of multiple doses of V565,  and to investigate potential immunogenicity 
following multiple dosing.  
In Part 3 (n=4) otherwise healthy subjects with a terminal ileostomy received a single dose of 
V565 1665  mg to evaluate V565 luminal concentrations at the terminal ileum.  
Part 4 (n=6) was a single ascending dose study that investigated systemic exposure in 
subject s with mild to moderate CD. Two subject s received a single 555 mg dose and, 
following review by the Safety Review Committee, a further four subject s received a single 
1665 mg d ose. This was considered important as patients with CD have increased intestinal 
permeability compared to healthy volunteers, which could potentially lead to increased 
systemic exposure. In addition, in this part of the study, urine collections were schedu led as 
an indirect method of assessing systemic exposure in case V565 was not detectable in serum 
samples.  
The results of the Phase 1 study are summari sed below : 
 V565 has been administered to 37 human subjects in single  doses up to 4995 mg 
and in multiple  doses up to 1665 mg TID for 14 days. V565 was safe and well 
tolerated. There were no deaths, no serious adverse events (SAEs) and no adverse 
events (AEs) leading to withdrawal or change of dose. Almost all AEs were mild, 
with the only severe AE being a re port of tonsillitis with initial symptoms starting 
approximately three hours after a 62 mg dose .   
 V565 was not detectable in any serum sample in any part of the study.  
 V565 was detected in the urine collection taken four to eight hours after dosing of 
one subject with CD  in Part 4, confirming that active V565 passes across the 
lamina propria.  
 No neutralising anti -drug antibodies were detected in any subject.  
 High concentrations of a ctive V565 were detected in ileal fluid and faeces .  
Additional non -clinic al information is provided in the current version of the V565 
Investigator's Brochure (IB) .  
2.2 Rationale  
There is a medical  need for a targeted anti -TNF α therapy that would minimise systemic 
exposure  (and the side effects associated with systemic exposure) , while providing effective 
treatment to the affected portions of the GI tract. Data from the Phase 1 study suggest that , 
relative to other anti -TNF α products  (which are given parentera lly and result in systemic 
VHsquared Ltd   18 
Protocol V56502  
Drug Name: V565  
02 December 2016   Confidential  exposure), orally administered V565 results in a very low level of systemic exposure . 
Therefore,  V565 may be expected to have a better s afety profile  than other anti -TNFα 
products . In addition, or ally administered V565 provides a more convenient route of 
administration  than the parenteral  route  used for other anti -TNFα  products . This proof -of-
concept Phase  2 study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics ( PK), and 
immunogenicity in subjects who receive V565 in combination with  any ongoing , permitted  
background treatment for CD. Permitted background treatments (those that will not interfere 
with the evaluation of the efficacy of V565) are described  in Section  5.10.2 . 
2.3 Hypothesis  
The hypothesis of this study is that  the proportion  of subjects at Day 42  achieving both  
 Crohn’s Disease  Activity Index [CDAI] ≥70 -point reduction from Baseline  OR a 
CDAI score <150  
AND  
 A reduction of ≥40% from baseline value of C-reactive protein [ CRP ] or faecal 
calprotectin [FCP] )  
will be higher in subjects who receive V565 than in subjects who receive p lacebo when used 
in combination with  their permitted  background CD medications.  
2.4 Risk Assessment  and Management of Risk  
2.4.1 Potential Risks Associated with V565  
The safety profile of parenteral anti-TNFα therapy is well-established  [9]. Because of the low 
level of systemic exposure associated with V565, it is anticipated that the potential adverse 
effects of anti-TNFα therapy will be minim ised.  
V565 was not associated with any treatment -related adverse effects in non -clinical toxicology 
studies . V565 was safe and well t olerated in the Phase 1 study  and there were no deaths, no 
SAEs  and no AEs leading to withdrawal . Most AEs were mild .  
Based on the mode of action of anti -TNFα therapy there may be an increased risk of GI and 
other  infections . This risk is being mitigated  by excluding subjects with a high risk of 
infections (such as those with tuberculosis [TB], infection with GI pathogen s, current 
infection, or history of recurrent infections). During the study, subject s will be closely 
monitored for the occurrence of GI and other infections.  
No reproductive toxicity studies have been carried out to date . While there is post -marketing 
data on the outcome of pregnancies in women taking TNFα inhibitors, women of 
childbearing potential must not enter this study if they are pregnant or breastfeeding, and both 
male and female study subjects must take adequate pr ecautions to prevent pregnancy.

02 December 2016   Confidential  No data exist on the effect s of overdose with V565 . Preclinical assessment has revealed no 
adverse effects at hig h levels of systemic exposure . The No Observed Adverse Effect Level 
(NOAEL) is defined as at least 75 mg/kg/da y when administered by intravenous ( IV) 
infusion  to monkeys for 6 weeks . This resulted in a maximum concentration ( Cmax) of 317 
µg/mL  after 6 weeks treatment . To date , 37 human subjects have received oral doses of V565 
up to 4995  mg in a single dose and 16 65 mg TID for 14 days.  V565 was not detectable in any 
serum sample . No subject has had a serum concentration above the lower limit of 
quantification  (62.5  ng/mL) at any dose administered.  
In the unlikely event of overdose,  it is recommended that supportive  measures are taken and 
further doses are withheld .  
2.4.2 2.3.1 Potential Risks Associated with Underlying Disease and  Study Design  
Lack of Efficacy : The subjects in this study will remain on their allowed  background therapy 
for the treatment of CD. Therefore, using V565 or placebo as an “add -on” therapy to the 
subject’s pre -existing CD treatment regimen  provides the subject with their minimal therapy.  
A rescue strategy has not been implemented because the study is only 6 weeks treatment 
duration, which  is a short time from a  CD perspective . However, if there are any concerns, 
the subjects are free to discontinue treatment at any time.  
There is no guarantee that the study drug will have the expected efficacy; however, the 
relatively short duration of treatment ( six weeks) minimi ses the amount of time the subject 
might be at risk of treatment with an ineffective study drug . All subjects will be closely 
monitored during the study . If a subject’s condition  worsens, and/or they require prohibited 
medications for the contr ol of CD, they will be withdrawn from the study  and treated as 
considered appropriate by their physician . Finally, the study excludes individuals who have 
failed to respond to anti -TNF α therapy  in the past  and who therefore might be a t risk of 
failing to respond to  oral V565 .  
Study -related Procedures : The procedures  used in this study are consistent with those used in 
the evaluation of CD as part of the Committee for Medicinal Products  for Human Use 
(CHMP ) guideline  [10]. While ileocolonoscopy is an invasive procedure , it is routinely 
conducted in patients with CD to inform decision making for the appropriate therapy for the 
patient . The risk s associated with all procedures will be explained to subject s as part of the 
informed consent process .  
2.4.3 2.3.2 Risk -benefit  Analysis  
Crohn’s disease is a serious, progressive,  and lifelong disease for whi ch there is an unmet 
medical  need for effective therapy . Anti-TNFα therapies are recognised as effective and 
important  treatments for patients with CD, but they are given by parenteral administration . 
Therefore, treatment with these products  results  in systemic suppression of the activity of 
TNFα throughout the b ody for prolonged periods .

Drug Name: V565  
02 December 2016   Confidential  V565 is a n engineered  domain antibody to TNFα selected to be resistant to GI proteases,  and 
formulated for oral administration . The formulation is designed to release active compound 
such that it is available to the ileum and c olon, the regions of the GI tract most commonly 
affected by CD. In addition, preclinical and clinical data show  that when administered orally, 
minimal V565 reaches the systemic circulation . This profile represents a potential benefit for 
the treatment of p atients with CD, maximising delivery to the site of TNFα production  in the 
lamina propria , and minimising anti-TNFα exposure to other parts of the body .  
This study has been designed to minimi se potential risks to subjects . The exclusion criteria 
and screening procedures were designed to exclude subjects  who may be at undue risk if they 
participate in the study .  
As this is a proof -of-concept study, there may be no benefit from participation in the s tudy to 
an individual subject . However, there is the expectation that subjects treated with V565 will 
exper ience improvements in the symptoms of their underlying disease .  
In summary, the assessment of potential risks associated with V565 in non -clinical  and 
clinical studies conducted to date support further evaluation in humans.  
This study will be performed in  compliance with the protocol, International Council for  
Harmonisation ( ICH), Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ), and applicable regulatory requirements.

4.1 Summary of Study Design  
This study will be a  multiple -site, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group 
proof -of-concept study in approximately 126 subject s with active CD. This study will include 
subjects who have a confirmed diagnosis of CD for at least three months and have CD 
involving the ileum and/or colon . Inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in detail in 
Section  4.4.  
The duration of treatment will be 42 days (six weeks); each subject’s participation in the 
study will be approximately 12 weeks. This includes a screening period of up to 28 days, a 
treatment period of 42 days and a follow -up period of 14 days after the last dose of study 
drug.  
Subjects will be randomised into two treatment arms : either V565 or placebo using a 2:1 
active:placebo ratio. Randomisation will be stratified to ensure treatment groups have similar 
rates of prior anti -TNFα t herapy.   
Subjects will receive three V565 185 mg capsules three times daily or matching placebo , for 
42 days (six weeks). The total daily V565 dose is 1665 mg.  
Subjects will be treated with study drug as an add -on to any permitted stable medications 
alread y being taken for CD. Permitted CD medications are described in Section 5.10.2 . No 
alteration of background CD medication will be permitted for the duration of the study.   
There are six study visits . Two screeni ng visits to assess  eligibility will occur during Days -
28 to Day -1; these are Visit 1 (start of screening), and Visit 2 ( eligibility ileocolonoscopy ). 
Additional study visits will occur on Day 1 (randomisation and initiation of treatment), Day 
14 (Interi m Visit), Day 42 (End of Treatment  Visit ), and Day 56 (Follow up  Visit ). 
Collection of subject -reported variables of the CDAI will be via the diaries given to subjects 
at Visit 1. Prior to Visit 2, the subject -reported variables will be combined with the v ariables 
collected at the site on Visit 1 and the CDAI score will be calculated. In order to have an 
ileocolonoscopy, eligible subjects must have sufficient diary entries to calculate a CDAI 
score, a CDAI score ≥220 to ≤450 and a CRP ≥5 mg/L (or if CRP is normal, FCP ≥250 µg/g) 
prior to Visit 2.  
A previous ileocolonoscopy conducted wi thin 12 weeks before Visit 1 may be substituted for 
the Visit 2 ileocolonoscopy provided it is forwarded to the central reader and was performed 
in such a way as to enable evaluation by the central reader .   
The Visit 2 ileocolonoscopy will be evaluated by  a central reader for to assess the overall 
appearance of the mucosa for the presence of active disease and scored using the SES -CD.

The efficacy of V565 will be evaluated throughout the study by assessing changes in CDAI 
scores and changes in inflammatory markers (CRP or FCP). Efficacy will also be evaluated 
with the PRO -2.  
Exploratory efficacy measures include changes in CDAI score s, changes in CRP (or FCP) 
values over time, the frequency of loose or watery stools as measured by the BSFS, the 
degree of abdominal pain as measured by the NPS , and changes in faecal urgency . This study 
will also assess the immunogenicity of V565 .  
In an  exploratory endoscopy substudy, subjects with more severe disease at the Visit 2 
ileocolonoscopy (a SES -CD ≥7, if ileum and colon are involved or ≥4 if only the ileum is 
involved ) will undergo a second ileocolonoscopy at the end of treatment (Day 42)  to evaluate 
changes in mucosal appearance . 
The PK evaluations will be based on V565 concentrations measured in serum and urine to 
evaluate systemic exposure (serum) and determine the levels of active V565 in urine samples.  
Safety will be assessed through evalu ations of AEs, clinical laboratory results, vital signs , 
physical examinations, ECGs  and concomitant medications .

a) The t iming of Visit 2 is flexible but ileocolonoscopy  must not occur  until the subject has sufficient diary entries to calculate the CDAI  score , meets the criteria for CDAI score and meets the criteria for CRP  (or 
FCP)  levels. The Visit 2 ileocolonoscopy must be evaluated by a central reader  and active disease must be confirmed before randomisation  on Day 1 .   
b) All assessments scheduled for Visit 2  should be done prior to the ileocolonoscopy .  
c) All baseline  procedures on Day 1 must occur prior to taking the first dose of study drug  (except for post -dose urine sample).   
d) The a ssessments indicated for unscheduled visits are for subjects who return to the site for safety reasons. Other safety assessments may be done at the Invest igator’s discretion. These assessments are not 
required for subjects who return to the site for administrative reasons (e.g., to pick up additional study drug) .   
e) Subjects will complete  the diary daily throughout the study . The diary will contain the subje ct-reported entries  of the CDAI, as well as the BS FS and the NPS .

02 December 2016   Confidential  4.2 Description  of Study Periods  
4.2.1 Screening: Visit 1 and Visit 2 ( Ileocolonoscopy ) (Day -28 to Day -1) 
The subjects will be screened during the 28 -day period prior to randomisation using the 
procedures outlined in  to ensur e that all eligibility criteria are fulfilled. Screening may be a 
maximum of 28 days but may be shorter depending on the amount of time required to 
determine that the subject is eligible for the study.   
In order to have an ileocolonoscopy, eligible subjec ts must have sufficient diary entries to 
calculate a CDAI score, a CDAI score ≥220 to ≤450 and a CRP ≥5 mg/L (or if CRP is 
normal, FCP ≥250 µg/g) prior to Visit 2.  
When it is determined that the subject is eligible for the Visit 2 ileocolonoscopy, the site  will 
contact the subject, confirm the date and instruct the subject in the use of the preparation for 
the ileocolonoscopy according to local practice. All assessments scheduled for Visit 2 should 
be done prior to the ileocolonoscopy.  
A previous ileocolono scopy conducted within 12 weeks before Visit 1 may be substituted for 
the Visit 2 ileocolonoscopy provided it is forwarded to the central reader and was performed 
in such a way as to enable evaluation by the central reader .  
Active disease must be confirme d by the central reader in order for the subject to proceed to 
Visit 3 and to be randomi sed on Day 1 . 
Assessments conducted at Visits 1 and 2 may be repeated once if they are out of range or 
unacceptable , providing that they are completed  and that the results known within the 
screening period. The re -test value(s) will supersede the original values for the evaluation of 
the subject’s eligibility.  
If a subject cannot be declared eligible within the 28-day screening  period  and the 
Investigator  wishes to re -screen the subject , the Investigator must contact the Quintile’s 
Medical Advisor for permission to re-screen . Requests for re -screening will be handled on a 
case-by-case basis. A re -screening can be allowed once only  for an individual subject , 
regardless o f the reason . The subject will be allocated a new screening number.  
4.2.2 Treatment Period   
During the treatment period , the subject will attend three site visits  (Day  1, Day 14 and 
Day 42). If possible, site visits will be scheduled for the morning . The window  for the Day 14 
and Day 42 visits is -3 days to +1 day.  
On Day 1, subject compliance with diary completion will be reviewed to confirm that diary 
compliance is still acceptable. If all eligibility requirements have been met (including those 
based on the r esults of the ileocolonoscopy), the subject will be  randomised. If not, the 
subject will be considered a screen failure and the reason for the screen fail will be recorded.

 Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive one of two oral regimens: V5 65 555  
mg TID or placebo .  
The Day 1 assessments and procedures presented in  will be completed prior to starting 
treatment with study drug.  Treatment will begin on Day 1  at the site and continue to Day 42.  
Additional information on dosing is available in Section  5.8. 
Subjects will continue to fill out their diaries daily throughout the treatment period . At each 
visit, site personnel will review the diaries and ass ess compliance with study drug 
administration and with the use of the diary .  
Pharmacokinetic samples (blood and urine) will be collected at each study visit . On Day 1, 
subjects will be asked to provide a pre -treatment sample and an additional sample 4 to 8 
hours after the first dose of study drug .  
The subjects take their last dose of study drug on Day 42. The subjects will return to the site 
on Day 42 for the assessments and procedures indicated in . The su bject diaries w ill be 
collected at this time. Subjects participating in the endoscopy substudy will have their second  
ileoc olonoscopy performed on Day 42.   
4.2.3 Follow -up: Day 56  
The subject will return to the site for a follow -up visit at Day 56 , approximately  two weeks 
after the last dose of study drug . The procedures performed during the follow -up visit  are 
presented in .  
4.2.4 30-day Post -treatment  
Serious adverse events reported spontaneously will be collected fo r 30 days after the last dose 
of study drug .  
4.2.5 Early Termination Visit  
A subject will have an Early Termination Visit if they discontinue treatment with study drug 
or withdraw from the study. If a subject withdraws  from the study , or is discontinued from 
treatment with study drug , every effort should be made to complete an Early Termination 
Visit with the same assessments as scheduled for Day 42 . The Early Termination Visit should 
be sched uled as soon as possible after it has been decided that the subject wi ll be permanently 
discontinue d from treatment with study drug. In addition to the Early Termination Visit , the 
Follow -up Visit should be performed on Day 56 if possible. Details describing subject 
withdrawal are presented in Section  4.5. 
4.2.6 Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visits, if needed, may occur at any time  as deemed necessary by the Investigator 
or site staff . If a subject returns to the site for an unscheduled visit  due to a safety reason , 
assessments indicate d in  should be performed . In addition , the Investigator  may do other

 safety assessments as deemed necessary.  These assessments are not required for subjects who 
return to the site for administrative reasons  (e.g., to pick up additional study drug).  
4.3 Discussion of Study Design  
This study has been designed to provide an initial evaluation of the clinical efficacy of V565 
in subjects with active CD. In this proof -of-concept study, the effect of V565 (555  mg TID 
for 6 weeks) will be compared to placebo . A double -blind, parallel -group, placebo -controlled, 
randomised design was chosen to minimise bias . Concurrent therapies for the treatment of 
CD are permitted at stable doses during the study .  
The dose selected for  this clinical proof -of-concept study is based on the 
safety/tolerability/PK profile elicited from the previous non -clinical and Phase 1 clinical 
studies, the known extensive safety database of systemic anti -TNFα therapy, and the 
necessity to provide doses likely to be therapeutically useful to patients with CD.  
V565 was not detected in the serum of any subject in the Phase 1 study given a single dose of 
either 555 mg or 1665 mg, including six subjects with CD who likely  have greater GI 
permeability than that of healthy volunteers. Dose selection was therefore based not on 
systemic exposure, but on the requirement to use a feasible dose which would be expec ted to 
deliver potentially therapeutically useful concentrations and which is not associated with 
adverse findings. Preclinical modelling has predicted that a dose around 500 mg TID would 
provide the required luminal concentration of V565 to provide potent ial benefit in CD. In 
addition, 555  mg delivered suitable faecal concentrations of V565 in both healthy volunteers 
and subjects with CD in the Phase 1 study , and did not present adverse safety or tolerability 
findings. Therefore, the proposed dose for clin ical testing is 555 mg TID, a total daily dose of 
1665 mg.  
The primary endpoint is based on changes in  CDAI score  and CRP (or FCP) biomarkers . The 
CDAI is well established as a standard scale for the evaluation of clinical outcome in CD. 
Published data do not explicitly clarify the relevant reduction in CRP associated with a 
clinical response in CD . However, in  2012,  Reinisch reported that the mean % reduction from 
baseline CRP associated with maintenance of a clinical response was 40% [11]. In this proof 
of concept study , a 40% reduction from Baseline has therefore been defined as a CRP 
response. The same definition will be applied to reduction in FCP. While a number of studies 
use normalisation of CRP as a crite rion, given the wide range of potential elevated CRP 
values in active CD patients this results in an unrealistically high hurdle for “relevant 
improvement” for inclusion in the primary endpoint in those patients with higher baseline 
values. Normalisation o f CRP will, however, be investigated as an exploratory endpoint in 
this study.  
The 6-week treatment period is considered sufficient to evaluate clinical efficacy  in this 
proof -of-concept study . The CHMP guidelines for new products for the treatment of CD 
describe  4 to 8 weeks of therapy as sufficient for the evaluation of CD  [10].

4.5 Subject Withdrawal  
All subjects are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time, for any reason, 
specified or unspecified, and without prejudice to further treatment . In addition, subjects will 
be withdrawn fr om study drug and from the study in the following circumstances:  
 The Investigator decides that the subject should be withdrawn . If this decision is 
made because of an intolerable AE or a clinically significant laboratory value, the 
study drug is to be disc ontinued and appropriate measures are to be taken . The 
Medical Monitor  is to be notified immediately .  
 The subject is unw illing to continue in the study .  
 Noncompliance or protocol violations that in the opinion of the Investigator or 
Sponsor /designee  necessitates the subject being removed . The decision to 
withdraw the subject should be taken in consultation with the Medical Monitor . 
 Pregnancy  
 Events that require emergency unblinding  
 Has infectious complications that require stopping or reduction of 
immunos uppressive therapy

  Requires any abdominal surgery  or surgery for fistula or abscesses ; the decision to 
withdraw the subject should be taken in consultation with the Medical Monitor.  
 The Investigator or the Sponsor, for any reason, stops the study .  
In gen eral, before the decision is made to withdraw the subject , consult ation with the Medical 
Monitor is recommended.  
If a subject chooses to withdraw from the study  (permanently stop taking the study drug ), 
they will be encouraged to return to the site for saf ety reasons to complete the assessments 
planned for Visit 5 ( Day 42 ) during an Early Termination Visit  and for the F ollow -up Visit 
(Day 56) . 
The Investigator should ensure that all reasonable attempts (telephone calls, contact with 
primary care physician, certified letter) are made to obtain follow -up safety information on 
subjects who do not return to the site for study visits or are lost to follow -up. 
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study after randomi sation and who receive at least one 
dose of study drug will not be replaced. These subjects cannot be rescreened.  
Subjects who withdraw from the study  after dosing  should be advised by the Investigator to 
continue contraception restrictions for 90 days after the last administration of study drug.  
The Inv estigator will ensure that the reasons for withdrawal are documented on the subject’s 
medical records (source documents) and in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) . If the 
subject withdraws due to an AE, the details of the AE must be entered on the AE s ection of 
the eCRF . If the reason for subject withdrawal is not known,  every effort must be made to 
contact the subject to establish the reason for withdrawal . 
4.6 Lost to Follow -up 
Subjects will be considered lost to follow -up when they fail to attend study v isits without 
stating an intention to withdraw from the study . The Investigator should show due diligence 
by documenting in the source documents the steps taken to contact the subject through at 
least three  telephone calls and/or emails and one registered letter . The subject should be 
recorded as “lost to follow -up” in the eCRF  if all reasonable attempts made to contact the 
subject have failed .

 5.0 STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1 Treatments Administered  
The subjects in this study will receive either V565 ( three 185 -mg capsule s for a dose of 
555 mg TID, for a total daily dose of 1665 mg ) or an equal number of matching placebo 
capsules (TID) for 42 days ( six weeks ).  
5.2 Identity of Investigational Product(s)  
V565 is a 115 amino acid 12.6 kDa single domain variable heavy chain antib ody ( VHH), 
active against human TNFα. The antibody is manufactured in Saccharomyces cerevisiae .  
The drug substance is formulated into 3 mm round mini -tablets . The mini -tablets are coated 
with a polymer s ub-coat and a Eudragit® enteric coat is applied to e ngender release in the 
required area of the GI tract. Once coated, the mini -tablets are encapsulated in  hydroxypropyl 
methylcellulose ( HPMC ) capsules .  
The formulation is engineered to release the mini -tablets from the capsules in the stomach . 
The size of the mini -tablets enables them to escape through the pylorus and migrate through 
the GI tract . The mini -tablet coating releases active molecule at a pH designed to ensure 
delivery of high concentrations of V565 to the ileum and distal parts of the GI tract.  
The components of the V565 drug product  are presented in Table 1.  
There is one dose strength for V565 active capsules. The V565 dose per capsule is 185 mg. 
Each 185 mg Size 00 pink opaque HPMC capsule contains 15  mini-tablets. Placebo HPMC 
capsules are identical to capsules containing V565  and contain  an equivalent number of 
mini-tablets of identical si ze, shape, and colour. The placebo mini-tablets are made of the 
same components as in Table 1 but contain no active V565.

 5.3 Storage  
All study drug  will be stored below 25 °C in an adequate  storage area , which is a secure, 
temperature controlled, locked envi ronment with restricted access . Study drug  must not be 
refrigerated or frozen.  
No special procedures for the safe handling  of V565/placebo are required .  
The Sponsor and their authorised representatives such as study monitors or auditors as well as 
regulatory inspectors will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, storage and 
dispensing procedures and records in ac cordance with applicable regulatory requirements , 
provided that the blind of the study is not compromised . 
Once study drug  has been dispensed to study subjects, it should be stored in accordance with 
the instructions on the label.  
5.4 Supply, Packaging and Lab elling  
Bulk V565/placebo will be manufactured and supplied by Quay Pharmaceuticals Ltd .  
Capsules will be packed into Duma special high -density polyethylene (HDPE) containers 
fitted with a low -density polyethylene tamper evident cap in compliance with EU Good 
Manufacturing Practice ( GMP ) conditions and labelled in accordance with local regulations 
(Duma Handycap manufactured b y Gerresheimer Pharmasystems) . Matching placebo will 
also be supplied .  
Study drug  will be labelled with multi -language booklets in accordance with GMP and 
country -specific regulations as required by the regulatory bodies in the countries where the 
study is conducted .  
5.5 Accountability  
In accord ance with GCP , the Investigational Site will account for  all supplies of 
V565/placebo . Details  of receipt, storage, assembly,  and return will be recorded .  
All unused supplies of V565/placebo will  be returned to the Sponsor at the end of the study in 
accordance with instruction by the Sponsor.  The study drug may be destroyed at the site with 
the co nsent of the Sponsor.  
5.6 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Group  
Once the subject  provides  an informed consent and  meets inclusion and exclusion criteria , the 
study site will request the study drug  assignment using the Interactive Web  Activated 
Respo nse System (I WRS). Approximately  126 subjects will be randomi sed in a 2:1 ratio 
(84 subjects in the V565  arm and 42 subjects in the placebo arm) . Randomisation will be 
stratified  to ensure treatment groups have similar rates of prior anti -TNFα therapy.

 5.7 Selection of D oses in the Study  
Dose selection is discussed in Section  4.3.  
5.8 Selection and Timing of Dose  for Each Subject  
Each dose will consist of  three  capsules of V565 ( three 185-mg capsules , total dose 555  mg) 
or pla cebo . Study drug will be  administered orally TID . The subject s will be instructed to 
take the capsules with sufficient fluid one hour before meals and at least two hours after the 
previous meal .  
No dose adjustments are permitted .  
5.9 Blinding  
This is a randomi sed, double -blind, placebo -controlled study with limited access to the 
randomi sation code . Study drug  and placebo capsules  will be identical in physical 
appearance . The treatment each subject  will receive will not be disclosed to the Investigator , 
study site staff, subject , Sponsor,  designee or contracting clinical  safety laboratories .  
Investigator s are strongly discouraged from requesting the blind be broken for an individual 
subject , unless there is a subject  safety issue that requires unblindin g and would change 
subject  management .  
The decision to break the blind in an emergency situation remains the responsibility of the 
treating physician, which will not be delayed or refused by the Sponsor . However, the 
Investigator may contact the Medical M onitor prior to breaking the blind to discuss 
unblinding. The Investigator should promptly notify the Medical Monitor of the emergency 
unblinding and the reason for breaking the blind, which should be clearly documented. 
Emergency unblinding should only be  performed by the Investigator through the IWRS. In 
case of unblinding , the subject should be withdrawn from the study (permanently stops the 
study drug , but attends the Early Termination Visit and Follo w-up Visit if possible).  
5.10 Prior and Concomitant Treatm ents 
All medications (prescription and non -prescription), treatments, and therapies taken by the 
subject from the time consent is signed throughout their entire participation in the study, 
including those initiated prior  to the start of the study, must be recorded on the subject’s 
source document and on the appropriate page of th e eCRF . The dose, unit, frequency, route, 
indication, date the medication was started, and date the medication was stopped (if not 
ongoing) must be recorded.  
5.10.1  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
The use of medications in the 12 weeks prior  to Visit 1  should be reported in the eCRF, 
indicating the dose , frequency, indication and start and stop dates . The use of some prior

 Vaccination with live, attenuated , or recombinant vaccines.  
Note :  Subjects should not  discontinue prohibited pre-existing background CD medications 
prior to Visit 1 in order to qualify for  the study .  
The use of any prohibited medication is considered a protocol  deviation and the details 
including the starting date and its dosage should be recorded in the eCRF . Subjects should be 
withdrawn  from the study  if any prohibited  medications are ta ken or if background CD 
therapy is changed during the study . 
5.11 Medical Care of Subjects after End of Study  
The Sponsor will not provide any additional care to subjects after they leave the study . 
Subjects will return to the care of their personal physician .  
5.12 Treatment Compliance  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that subject s are instructed in the proper  use of 
study drug and that the subjects are fully compliant with their assigned dosage regimen , as 
well as the timing for taking the study d rug relative  to meals  (see Section  5.8). 
The prescribed dosage, timing, and mode of study drug administration may not be changed . 
Any departures from the intended regimen must be recorded in the eCRF .  
At Day 14  and Day 42 , previously dispensed study drug  will be retrieved by the Investigator  
and compliance assessed . Subjects will be asked to return all unused medication at  each visit.   
Adequate compliance is defined as taking between 80% and 120% of dispensed st udy drug. 
Compliance problems (e.g., missing 2 or more consecutive full days [at least 6 doses] or 
taking less than 80% or more than 120% of the doses between study visits) should be 
discussed with the Medical Monitor to determine if the subject may contin ue in the study.

 6.0 EFFICACY, PHARMACOKINETIC , SAFETY , HEALTH 
OUTCOME , AND PHARMACOGENOMIC  
ASSESSMENTS  
6.1 Efficacy  Assessment  
6.1.1 Subject Dia ry 
During Visit  1, a diary will be given to each subject . Subjects  will be trained how to complete  
the diary  and instructed in the use  of the diary . The importance of completing t he diary daily 
throughout the study  will be stressed . The subject will compl ete the diary daily  throughout 
the study until Day 42 (the End of Treatment Visit). The diary will be used to record the 
subject -reported variables of the CDAI, the BSFS, and the NPS.  
Site personnel will assess the subject’s compliance with the use of the  diary throughout the 
study.  
During the screening period , subjects must have entered sufficient diary data to allow 
calculation of the CDAI score  (see Section 6.1.2 ). Subjects with poor compliance completing  
the diary during screening will be considered screen failures. Subjects with poor compliance 
completing the diary during the treatment period may be withdrawn from the study . 
The data obtained from the subject diary will be  used for calculation of the subject-reported 
variables  of the CDAI  and other efficacy outcomes measures  such as the PRO -2, BSFS and 
NPS.  
The subject will record the following information in the subject diary to assess CD activity : 
1. Number of liquid or very soft stools  
2. Abdominal pain/cra mps 
3. General well -being  
4. Fever over 100°F (37.8°C)  
5. Use of anti-diarrhea l drugs  (e.g., loperamide, diphenoxylate, or opiates)  
6.1.2 Crohn’s Disease Activity Index   
Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is the most commonly used measure of clinical 
activity in patients with CD  [12, 13, 14]. Some of the data used to calculate the CDAI is 
obtained from the subject diary (see Section  6.1.1 ) and some is obtained at site visits. The 
CDAI will be calculated  at the time points identified in . 
The CDAI consists of eight  variables:  
1.  Total number of li quid or very soft stools (total for previous 7 days)  
2. Abdominal pain/cramps rating (total for previous 7 days)  
VHsquared Ltd   43 
Protocol V56502  
Drug Name: V565  
02 December 2016   Confidential  
 3. Subjective g eneral well -being rating (total for previous 7 days)  
4. Total number of listed categories the subject has experienced during the last 7 d ays 
(Note: all of these are assessed by the Investigator  with the exception of fever, which  
is obtained from the subject diary .) 
a. Arthritis or arthralgias  
b. Iritis/uveitis, erythema nodosum, or pyoderma gangrenosum  
c. Aphthous ulcers  
d. Anal fissures, fistulae, or  abscess  
e. Other fistula (specified by site personnel)  
f. Fever higher than 100°F or 37.8°C during previous week  
5. Use of anti -diarrheal drugs (e.g., loperamide, diphenoxylate, or opiates)  
6. Presence of a bdominal mass  
7. Anaemia  based on haematocrit  (HCT)  value ent ered into formula:  
a. For men = 47 – HCT  value  
b. For women = 42 – HCT  value  
8. Body weight in kilograms (kg) entered into formula:  
a. ([standard weight in kg – actual weight kg] / [standard weight in kg]) x 100%  
The responses are scored numerically and weighted . Total CDAI scores range from 
0 to approximately 600 points ; a higher score indicates a more active disease . A CDAI score 
of <150 points denotes remission, a score between 150 to 219 points denotes mildly active 
disease, a score of  ≥220 to ≤450 points denotes m oderately active disease, and a score of 
>450 points denotes severe disease.  
During the study, the CDAI will be calculated from the scores obtained from the 
subject -reported variables  of the CDAI and the result s recorded  at the site . Haematocrit 
values wil l be extracted from the central laboratory results and used for the calculation of the 
CDAI score.  
Subject s who prematurely discontinue treatment prior to Day 42 will be asked  to continue to 
record CDAI data until the Early Termination  Visit. 
Instructions for recording the CDAI score will be given at Visit 1  (see Section  6.1.1 ). Data 
should be reviewed at each study visit, including unscheduled visits.  
A sample of a CDAI score worksheet  is provided in the Appendi x (Section  12.1) 
6.1.3 Biomarkers of Inflammation  
The collection of CRP and/or FCP will occur at the time points indicated in . 
C-reactive protein is an acute -phase rea ctant produced in the liver and is an easily measured 
non-specific marker of inflammation . It is a widely used marker of inflammation in CD and 
elevations in CRP have been associated with endoscopic inflammation in CD [15, 16]. 
VHsquared Ltd   44 
Protocol V56502  
Drug Name: V565  
02 December 2016   Confidential  
 C-reactive protein will be analysed in blood samples . If CRP values are normal, FCP will be 
assessed in the faecal samples . FCP will be used as the eligibility test if CRP results are 
<5 mg/L. D uring the treatment and follow up phase of the study, FCP will only be evaluated 
in subjects whose screening CRP was <5  mg/L, and who qualified for the study based on 
their screening FCP value.  
Calprotectin is abundant in the cytosol of activated neutrophi ls. The amount of FCP is 
directly proportional to neutrophil influx into the intestinal tract and is a reliable non -specific 
marker of intestinal inflammation [ 17, 18, 19]. While currently endoscopy with biopsy is 
considered the gold standard for evaluating the extent and location of inflammatory mucosal 
lesions, studies have shown that FCP may also be a useful marker of int estinal inflammation.  
On Day 1, the faecal  sample for FCP should be collected prior to administration of the first 
dose of study drug . The subject may also provide a sample from faeces  passed one day prior 
to the scheduled visits . These samples will be co llected in sterile containers  (to be provided to 
the subjects ) and refrigerated  at home . At each sampling time point, approximately 2  g to 5  g 
of faeces will be collected .  
6.1.4 Abdominal Pain and Stool Frequency Instrument (PRO -2) 
PRO -2 will be calculated at t he time points indicated in . 
The PRO -2 is a composite score that measures abdominal pain and soft stool frequency 
averaged over seven days [ 20]. The data for the  total PRO -2 score is extracted from selected  
subject -reported variables of the CDAI included in the subject diary . These data are the 
entries for the number of liquid or soft stools/day and abdominal pain (rated on a scale of 0 -3) 
assessed over the course  of seven  days.  
6.1.5 Ileocolonoscopy  
It is important to confirm that subject s are  eligible for the ileocolonoscopy  prior to Visit 2 . 
During the screening period, subjects must have entered sufficient diary data to allow 
calculation of the CDAI score, have CDA I scores ≥220 to ≤450  and CRP level ≥5  mg/L [or if 
CRP is normal, FCP level ≥250  µg/g] ). The timing of the Visit 2 is flexible but the 
ileocolonoscopy must not be done until it has been documented that the subject is eligible for 
the ileocolonoscopy .  
It should be noted that subjects who have had an ileocolonoscopy within 12 weeks of Visit 1 
do not require an ileocolonoscopy at Visit 2 provided it is forwarded to the central reader 
and was performed in such a way as to enable evaluation by the central reade r.  
Video images of all endoscopic procedures will be captured and sent to a qualified central 
reader .  
The images will be examined to determine the central reader’s overall impression of the state 
of mucosa  to assess eligibility for randomi sation and to c alculate the SES-CD (see 
VHsquared Ltd   45 
Protocol V56502  
Drug Name: V565  
02 December 2016   Confidential  
 Section  6.1.6 ). Active disease must be confirmed by the central reader in order for the subject 
to proceed to Visit 3 and randomisation  on Day 1 .  
6.1.6 SES-CD 
The SES -CD assesses the mucosal appearance of the intestine in subjects with CD [21]. It 
includes four variables: ulcer size, the extent of ulcerated surface, extent of affected surface, 
and stenosis .   
Each of these four components are assess ed in the five segments of the ileum and colon: 
ileum, right  colon , transverse  colon , left colon (descending and sigmoid), and rectum . The 
SES-CD is the sum of the individual scores of each of the components across the five 
segments . For the SES-CD, a high er score i ndicates  more severe disease.  
In addition  to obtaining baseline information  on the condition of the mucosa , changes in 
overall mucosal appearance and changes in the SES-CD in response to treatment will be 
evaluated in an exploratory endoscopy substudy . This substudy will include subjects with a 
baseline SES -CD  ≥7 (if ileum and colon are involved) or ≥4 (if the lesions are confined to 
the ileum ). These subjects will have an additional ileocolonoscopy  at Day 42 .  
6.1.7 Exploratory Efficacy Measures  
6.1.7.1  Bristol Stool Form Scale  
The BS FS [22, 23] is used to monitor change in intestinal function and transit time, by 
classifying the form of faeces into 7  categories : 
 Type 1 : Separate hard lumps, like nuts (hard to pass)  
 Type 2: Sausage -shaped, but lumpy  
 Type 3: Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface  
 Type 4: Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft  
 Type 5: Soft blobs with clear -cut edges (passed easily)  
 Type 6: Fl uffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool  
 Type 7: Watery, no solid pieces , entirely liquid  
This scale will be included  in the subject diary and will be completed  daily . The Bristol Stool 
Chart  is included in the Appendix ( Section  12.2).  
6.1.7.2  Numeric Pain Scale  
Abdominal pain will be evaluated with an 11 -point NPS.  
The NPS is an 11 -point numeric scale ranging from 0 to 10, with 0 as no pain and 10 as worst 
pain imaginable [24, 25]. 
VHsquared Ltd   46 
Protocol V56502  
Drug Name: V565  
02 December 2016   Confidential  
 The subjects are asked to rate their abdominal pain by recording the number that best 
describes their pain, on average, in the preceding 24 hours. Subjects will record the score 
daily in the subje ct diary.  
6.1.7.3  Faecal Urgency  
The degree of faecal urgency will be evaluated by asking the subject if they experienced 
faecal urgency in the 24 hours prior the site visits on  Day 1  (Baseline) , Day 14 and Day  42. 
Faecal urgency evaluates the subjects need to ru sh to the toilet for a bowel movement.  Faecal 
urgency will be scored using the following scale:  
 0 = No urgency  
 1 = Mild urgency  
 2 = Moderate urgency  
 3 = Severe urgency  
 4 = Very severe urgency/didn’t make it to toilet on time  
If the subject had more than one bowel movement in the 24 hours prior to the study visit, the 
event with the most urgency will be recorded.  
6.2 Safety  Assessments  
Safety will be monitored during the study as detailed in . Safety variables include evaluations 
of AEs, laboratory evaluations, vital signs, physical examinations , ECGs  and concomitant 
medications .  
6.2.1 Adverse Events   
Definition of AE : An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  enrolled in this 
study (i.e., that occurs aft er the informed consent form [ ICF] is signed), regardless of its 
causal relationship to study drug.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable  and unintended sign (including a clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease.  
An AE inc ludes a/an:  
 Exacerbation of a pre -existing condition or disease.  
 Increase in frequency or intensity of a pre -existing condition.  
 Continuous persistent pre -existing disease or symptoms that worsen after the 
subject provides informed consent.  
If a clinically  significant abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal test result meets the 
definition of an AE or SAE, then the AE eCRF page or SAE eCRF page must be completed, 
as appropriate . Clinically  significant laboratory results include those that:  
 Result in d iscontinuation from the study.  
VHsquared Ltd   47 
Protocol V56502  
Drug Name: V565  
02 December 2016   Confidential  
  Require treatment or any other therapeutic intervention.  
 Require further diagnostic evaluation (excluding a repetition of the same 
procedure to confirm the abnormality).  
 Are associated with clinical signs or symptoms judged b y the Investigator to have 
a clinically significant impact.  
A diagnosis (if known), or clinical signs and symptoms (if diagnosis is unknown), rather than 
the clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding or test result, should be entered on the 
AE or SAE eCRF page . If no diagnosis is known and clinical signs and symptoms are not 
present, then the clinically significant abnormal finding should be recorded  as an AE . 
An AE does not include a/an:  
 Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, too th extraction, 
transfusion); the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE . Any complication 
of the procedure is also considered to be an AE. 
 Pre-existing disease or conditions present or detected at the start of the study that 
do not worsen.  
 Situatio ns where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g., 
hospitali sations for cosmetic elective surgery, social and/or convenience 
admissions).  
 The disease or disorder being studied or sign or symptom associated with the 
disease or disorder, unless more severe or frequent than expected for the subject’s 
condition.  
Any medical condition that is present prior to informed consent should be recorded as 
medical history and not be reported as an AE . 
Treatment -emergent Adverse Event : A TEAE is defined as  
1. A new event that occurs during or after treatment with study drug or  
2. Any event present at Baseline  that worsens in either intensity or frequency after 
exposure to study drug .  
Definition of Serious Adverse Event :  
An SAE, experience or reaction, is any unt oward medical occurrence (whether considered to 
be related to study drug or not) , that, at any dose:  
 Results in death  – the death was an outcome of an AE. 
 Is life -threatening (the subject  is at a risk of death at the time of the event; it does 
not refer to  an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe) . 
 Requires in patient  hospitali sation or prolongation of existing hospitali sation: 
Hospital admissions and/or surgical operations planned before or during a study 
VHsquared Ltd   48 
Protocol V56502  
Drug Name: V565  
02 December 2016   Confidential  
 are not consider ed AEs if the illness or disease existed before the subject  was 
enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way 
during the study . 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity , i.e., the AE resulted in a 
substa ntial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions, i.e., 
the AE resulted in a significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment , 
damage or disruption in the subject’s body function/structure, physical activities 
and/or quality o f life   
 Is a congenital abnormality/birth defect  in the offspring of a subject who received 
drug – it is suspected that exposure to study drug prior to conception or during 
pregnancy may have resulted in an adverse outcome in the child . 
 Other:  Medically s ignificant events, which do not meet any of the criteria above, 
but may jeopardi se the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the other serious outcome s listed in the definition above . Examples 
of such events are blood d yscrasias ( e.g., neutropenia or anaemia  requiring blood 
transfusion, etc.) or convulsions that do not result in hospitali sation.  
Other Adverse Event Definitions : 
An Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) is defined as all noxious and unintended responses to a 
medicin al product related to any dose .  
An Unexpected ADR  is defined as any adverse reaction, the nature of which is not consistent 
with the  applicable product information and is unexpected . An adverse reaction is 
‘unexpected’ if its nature and severity are not c onsistent with the information about the 
medicinal product in question set out in Section 7 of the  IB.  
A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) is an adverse reaction, the 
nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable pr oduct information (e.g., for 
applicable product information, include the IB for an unapproved investigational product or 
the package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product) . Therefore, if 
a treatment -related SAE occurs and it was  not mentioned in the applicable product 
information, then it will be reported as a SUSAR .  
Definitions of Severity  
The severity of the AE will be characteri sed as “mild, moderate or severe” according to the 
following definitions:  
 Mild  events are usually t ransient and do not interfere with the subject’s daily 
activities.  
 Moderate  events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject 
and may interfere with daily activities.  
 Severe  events interrupt the subject’s usual daily activity.

 Definit ions of Relationship  
Causal relationship must be assessed by the Investigator answering the following question:  
‘Is there a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event?’  
Yes There is a reasonable or strong temporal relationship, and the events ar e unlikely 
attributed to other drugs, underlying diseases or other factors.  
No There is no st rong temporal relationship, and /or use of other drugs, underlying 
diseases, or other factors provide plausible explanations for the occurrence of the 
event.  
6.2.1.1  Monito ring of Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for recording all AEs observed during the study ( screening , 
treatment, and follow -up period s). At each visit, the subject will be asked if they have 
experienced any untoward occurrence since the last t rial visit . In addition, subjects will be 
instructed to contact the study site at any time after the ICF is signed if any symptoms 
develop.  
All AEs/SAEs should be recorded individually in the study subject’s own words (verbatim) 
unless, in the opinion of t he Investigator, the AEs/SAEs constitute components of a 
recogni sed condition, disease, or symptom . The Investigator should attempt to establish a 
diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information . In such 
cases, the diagno sis should be documented as the AE and/or SAE rather than the individual 
signs/symptoms.  
All AEs will be recorded on the eCRFs and include a description of the event, severity, tim e 
of occurrence, and duration . In addition, any action (e.g ., treatment and follow -up tests) and 
the outcome should be provided along with the Investigator’s assessment of the relationship 
to the investigational drug.  
In cases of surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition/illness leading to such a procedure 
is considered as the AE rather than the procedure itself.  
In cases in which the subject dies, the cause of death should be recorded as an SAE; death is 
considered the outcome of the SAE .  
Adverse events should be followed until recovery to the normal state has been achieve d. In 
the event of a subject not returning to the study site, the outcome of this event will be 
recorded as unknown . 
6.2.1.2  Recording of Adverse Events  
All AEs  that occur after the subject has signed consent ( regardless of severity and /or 
perceived relationship t o study drug) are to be recorded on the appropriate AE sections  (either 
VHsquared Ltd   50 
Protocol V56502  
Drug Name: V565  
02 December 2016   Confidential  
 ‘serious’ or ‘non -serious’) in the eCRF . Spontaneously reported SAEs that occur for up to 30 
days after the last dose of study drug will also be recorded. The Investigator  should compl ete 
all the details requested including dates of onset, severity, action taken , outcome , relationship 
to study drug. Each event should be recorded separately.  
6.2.1.3  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
In the case of a n SAE  (including SUSARs ), the Investigator  must complete, sign and date the 
SAE pages from the eCRF , and check that the data are consistent .  
Any SAE, including death due to any cause, which occurs during this study, whether or not 
related to the study drug, must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of the study site’s 
knowledge of the event) by sending a completed, separate SAE Report Form by fax or email 
to Emas Pharma as displayed below: : 
Contact Method  
Fax +44(0)1462 600 456  
Email  drug.safe ty@emaspharma.com  
The report will contain all available information concerning the SAE to enable the Sponsor 
(or an authori sed representative) to file a report, which satisfies regulatory reporting 
requirements . These timelines apply to initial reports o f SAEs and to all follow -up reports .  
All SAEs will be recorded on the SAE Report Form, the Adverse Events Form in the eCRF , 
and source documents . Criteria for documenting the relationship to study drug as well as 
severity and outcome will be the same as t hose previously described .  
SAEs considered causally related to study treatment that are spontaneously reported to the 
Investigator more than 30 days after a subject’s last dose of study drug should also be 
collected and reported as described previously, r egardless of the time after the trial.  
The information must include at least the following:  
 Name, address,  and telephone number of the reporting Investigator  
 Invest igational product and study cod e. 
 Subject  identification number, sex, and date of birth  (recorded as permitted by 
local authorities ). 
 Description of the AE, measures taken and outcome . 
 Preliminary classification of causal relationship by the Investigator   
Additional follow -up information should be completed on an SAE Form with a copy sent to 
Emas Pharma and the original included in the SAE section of the eCRF.

 6.2.1.4  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Authorities and 
Investigator s 
Investigators will be notified of all SAEs that require prompt submission to their Institutional 
Review Bo ard (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC). Investigators should provide 
written documentation of IRB/IEC notification for each report to the Sponsor or Quintiles. 
Emas Pharma will ensure that all applicable SAEs are reported to the appropriate regula tory 
authorities on behalf of the Sponsor . In countries where the sponsor is responsible for IEC 
submissions of applicable SAEs,  this will be performed by Emas Pharma.   
6.2.1.5  Follow -Up of Adverse Events  
Any AEs observed from Screening /randomi sation up to the final study visit  will be followed 
up to resolution . Resolution means that the subject  has returned to a baseline state of health or 
the Investigator  does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the AE.  
6.2.1.6  Pregnancy  
Females of childbearing potential will have a serum pregnancy test performed at Screening  
and a urine pregnancy test at Day 1 to ensure the exclusion of pregnant women from the 
study.  Female subjects will be instructed to inform the site if they become pregnant during 
the study. Male subje cts will be instructed to inform the site if their partner becomes pregnant 
during the study.  
Female subjects of childbearing potential will have an additional test for pregnancy at Day 42 
(the end of the study ) and at Day 56 ( the Follow -up Visit ). In addi tion, a pregnancy test will 
be performed at the Early Termination Visit, if a female of childbearing potential 
discontinues the study prior to Day 42 .  
Any known or suspected pregnancy that occurs during the study (either in female subjects or 
female part ners of male subjects) must be reported to Emas Pharma within 24 hours of the 
time the Investigator becomes aware of the event, using the Pregnancy Report Form. 
Suspected pregnancies in subjects will be confirmed with a pregnancy test. Pregnant females 
will be discontinued from the study.  
The Sponsor /designee  has a responsibility to monitor the outcome of all pregnancies reported 
during the study. The Investigator must follow up and document the course and the outcome 
of all pregnancies even if the subject  withdraws consent or the study has finished.  
Pregnancy alone is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the study drug may 
have interfered with the effectiveness of contraceptive medications or a suspected AE is 
associated with pregnancy.  
Elective abortions without complications should not be regarded as AEs, unless they were 
therapeutic abortions (see below) . Hospitali sation for normal delivery of a healthy new-born 
should not be considered an SAE.  
VHsquared Ltd   52 
Protocol V56502  
Drug Name: V565  
02 December 2016   Confidential  
 All outcomes of pregnancy must be reporte d by the Inve stigator to Emas Pharma  on the 
Pregnancy Outcome Report Form within 30 days after he/she has gained knowledge of the 
normal delivery or elective abortion . The Investigator must follow up and document the 
course and the outcome of all pregnanci es even if the subject was withdrawn from the study 
or if the study has finished . The pregnancy  will be followed up to delivery; the Investigator 
must report any complications that occur even though the study has finished.  
Any SAE that occurs during pregna ncy must be recorded on the SAE Report Form 
(e.g.,  maternal serious complications, therapeutic abortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, 
neonatal death, congenital anomaly, birth defect) and reported within 24 hours in accordance 
with the procedure for repo rting SAEs  (see Section  6.2.1.3 ).  
6.2.2 Contraception  
The need to avoid pregnancy and acceptable methods of contraception should be discussed 
with male subjects and female subjects of childbearing potential prior to the administration of 
study drug.  
Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Visit 1 , a 
negative urine test at Day 1,  and agree to use effective contraception from signing informed 
consent and for at least 90 days after the last dose of study drug. Males who are sexually 
active with a female partner of childbearing potential must be willing to use effective 
contraception from signing informed consent  and for 90 days after the study .  
1. Females of childbearing potential  include any female who has experienced menarche 
and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilisation (hysterectomy, bilateral 
tubal ligation, salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal. 
Postmenopausal is defined as no menses for ≥12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. Females with questionable menopausal history (e.g., irregular 
menstrual periods and age >40 years) are considered to be of childbearing potential.  
2. Females of childbearing potential  must use acceptable highl y effective (according to 
Clinical Trial Facilitation Group [CTFG] recommendations)  methods of birth control 
in this study . These include :  
 Combined ( oestrogen  and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception 
associat ed with inhibition of ovulation  
o oral 
o intravaginal  
o transdermal  
 Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associat ed with inhibition of ovulation  
o oral 
o injectable  
VHsquared Ltd   53 
Protocol V56502  
Drug Name: V565  
02 December 2016   Confidential  
 o implantable  
 Intrauterine device  
 Intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
 Bilateral tubal occlusion  
 Vasectomised partner (provided that  partner is the sole sexual partner of the 
female of childbearing potential  trial participant and that the vasectomised partner 
has received medical assessment of the surgical success.)  
 Sexual abstinence must be true sexual abstinence defined as refraining  from 
heterosexual intercourse as part of the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject . 
This behavior must cover the entire period of risk associated with the study 
treatment , which includes at least the time of screening up to at least 90 days after 
the end of treatment . The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in 
relation to the duration of the study . Periodic abstinence ( e.g., calendar ovulation, 
symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the 
duration of e xposure to study drug , and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception . 
3. Fertile males  who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential 
must agree to use contraception (condom plus spermicide or partner using acceptable 
highly effective method) from signing informed consent and for 90 days after last 
dose.  
4. Fertile males  should be instructed that they are not to donate sperm during the study 
or up to 90 days the last dose of study drug.  
5. Subject s must follow the strictest ap plicable local requirement in regards to 
contraception as specified by the Regulatory Agency or Ethics Committee approving 
the trial.  
6.2.3 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Blood will be drawn and u rine samples will be collected from each subject at each study vi sit. 
The clinical laboratory parameters used as screening tests , efficacy outcomes  or for safety 
monitoring are presented in Table 2. 
Clinical laboratory tests will be reviewed for results of potential clinical sig nificance 
throughout the study  (see Section  6.2.1  for definition of clinically significant laboratory 
results) . If the Investigator determines a laboratory abnormality to be clinically significant, it 
is conside red a laboratory AE . However, if possible, the underlying condition causing the 
laboratory abnormality, rather than the abnormality itself, should be reported as the AE . 
Clinically significant laboratory results will be followed to resolution or until the Investigator 
considers the abnormality chronic and/or the subject to be stable.

 A central laboratory designated by the Sponsor will be used for all laboratory assessments 
during the trial . Urine pregnancy testing will be done by dipsticks (supplied by the central 
laboratory).  
If an immediate result is required, a sample should be sent to both the local and central 
laboratory.

 6.5.1 Blood 
Samples will be obtained for the determination of V565 in serum . The following information 
will be captured for blood sample collection in each subject’s eCRF:  
1. Subject’s study number and initials  
2. Time and date of first V565 dose administration on Day 1 and time and date of the 
most recent V565 dose prior to PK sampling on Day 14 and 42.  
3. Time and date of each blood sample collected for PK analysis  
4. Time and date of subject’s most recent ingestion of food prior to dose administration 
Samples will be collect ed, processed, labelled, stored, and shipped as detailed in the 
Central Laboratory Manual.  
6.5.2 Urine  
Urine samples for analysis of V565 in urine will be collected as follows:  
1. Prior to administration of the first dose of V565 on Day 1. Date/time of urine 
collec tions will be captured in each subject’s eCRF.  
2. Post-dose on Day 1, 4 to 8 hours after the first dose of study drug , prior to leaving the 
clinic  
3. During the Day 14 and Day 42 visits, complete urine voids will be collected prior to 
the subject leaving the cli nic. The weight (g) or volume (mL) and pH of the urine void 
along with the date/time of urine collections will be captured in each subject’s eCRF. 
Date and time of the last dose prior to urine collection will also be captured in the 
eCRF.  
Aliquots of the r espective urine sample will be frozen and stored until determination of V565 
concentration as outlined in the Central Laboratory Manual . 
6.6 Pharmacogenetic s 
A blood sample for exploratory genetic research will be obtained from consenting subjects 
pre-dose, at  Visit 3  (Day 1) . Although genotype is a stable parameter, sample collection prior 
to the first dose on Day 1  is preferred to avoid introducing bias through excluding subjects 
who may withdraw due to an AE; it is important to include such subjects in any g enetic 
analysis . If the sample is not drawn at Visit 3  (Day 1) , it may be taken at any visit until the 
last study visit . Only one sample should be collected per subject for possible genetic analysis . 
Samples will be collected, labelled, stored,  and shipped  as detailed in the Central Laboratory 
Manual.  
Participation in this optional genetic research is voluntary . A separate ICF will be used for 
subjects who elect to contribute samples for pharmacogenetic analyses. This sample may be 
VHsquared Ltd   58 
Protocol V56502  
Drug Name: V565

 analysed only for genes i nvolved in the drug metabolism, safety,  and clinical efficacy of 
V565 . These samples may pro vide information on how individuals metabolise and react to 
the study drug .  
The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genetic analysis are  
important to maintain subject confidentiality. Samples will be stored for a maximum of  15 
years from the date of the last subject’s last visit, after which they will be  destroyed. Samples 
will be  stored and used until no further analyses are possible or the maximum storage time 
has been  reached.  
For all samples, irrespective of the type of coding used, the DNA will be extracted from the  
blood sample. The DNA sample will be assigned a unique number replacing the information  
on the sample tube. Thereafter, the DNA sample will be identifiable by the unique DNA  
number only. No personal details identifying the individual will be available to any person.  
6.7 Appropriateness of Measurements  
All efficacy, safety,  and tolerability assessments used in this study are standa rd and generally 
accepted as appropriate for this type of study.

 7.0 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
According to the Guidelines of Good Clinical Practice (CPMP/ICH/135/95), the Sponsor is 
responsible for study drug documentation and maintaining quality assurance and quality 
control systems with written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) .  
Quality control will be applied to each stage of data handling .  
The following steps will be taken to ensure the accuracy, consistency, completeness, and 
reliability of the data:  
 Investigator  meeting(s)  
 Central laboratories for clinical laboratory parameters  
 Site Initiation visit  
 Early site visits post -enrolment  
 Routine site monitoring  
 Ongoing site communication and training  
 Data management quality control checks  
 Conti nuous data acquisition and cleaning  
 Internal review of data  
 Quality control check of the final clinical study report  
In addition, the Sponsor and/or Quintiles Clinical Quality Assurance Department may 
conduct periodic audits of the study processes, includi ng, but not limited to study site, site 
visits, central laboratories, vendors, clinical database, and final clinical study report . When 
audits are conducted, access must be authori sed for all study related documents including 
medical history and concomitan t medication documentation to authori sed Sponsor’s 
representatives and regulatory authorities.  
7.1 Monitoring  
The Sponsor has engaged the services of a contract research organi sation ( CRO ), Quintiles , 
to perform all monitoring functions within this clinical  study . Quintiles’  monitors will work 
in accordance with Quintiles ’ SOPs . Monitors will establish and maintain regular contact 
between the Investigator  and the Sponsor.  
Monitors will evaluate the competence of each study site, informing the Sponsor about a ny 
problems relating to facilities, technical equipment,  or medical staff . During the study, 
monitors will check that written informed consent has been obtained from all subject s 
correctly and that data are recorded correctly and completely . Monitors are a lso entitled to 
compare entries in eCRF s with corresponding source data and to inform the Investigator  of 
any errors or omissions . Monitors will also control adherence to the protocol at the study  site.

 Monitoring visits will be conducted according to all applicable regulatory requirements and 
standards . Regular monitoring visits will be made to each site while  subject s are enrolled  in 
the study . The monitor will make written reports to the Sponsor on each occasion contact 
with the Investigator  is made, re gardless of whether it is by phone or in person.  
During monitoring visits, entries in the eCRF s will be compared with the original source 
documents (source data verification) . 
7.2 Data Management/Coding  
Data generated within this clinical study  will be handle d accordi ng to the relevant SOPs of 
the Data M anagem ent and B iostatistics departments of Quintiles .  
Electronic Data Capture (EDC) will be used for this study , meaning that all eCRF  data will 
be entered in electronic form s at the study  site. Data collectio n will be completed by 
authori sed study site staff designated by the Investigator . Appropriate training and security 
measures will be completed with the Investigator  and all authori sed study site staff prior to 
the study being initiated and prior to any da ta being entered into the system for any study 
subjects.  
All data must be entered in English . The eCRF s should always reflect the latest observations 
on the subjects participating in the study . Therefore, the eCRFs are to be completed as soon 
as possible d uring or after the subject’s visit . To avoid inter -observer variability, every effort 
should be made to ensure that the same individual who made the initial baseline 
determinations completes all efficacy and safety evaluations . The Investigator  must verify  
that all data entries in the eCRFs are accurate and correct . If some assessments are not done, 
or if certain information is not available or not applicable or unknown, the Investigator  
should indicate this in the eCRF . The Investigator  will be required to  sign off electronically 
on the clinical data .  
The monitor will review the eCRFs and evaluate them for completeness and consistency . The 
eCRF will be compared with the source documents to ensure that there are no discrepancies 
between critical data . All e ntries, corrections,  and alterations are to be made by the 
responsible Investigator  or his/her designee . The monitor cannot enter data in the eCRFs . 
Once clinical data of the eCRF have been submitted to the central server, corrections to the 
data fields wi ll be audit trailed, meaning that the reason for change, the name of the person 
who performed the change, and the  time and date of the change will be logged . Roles and 
rights of the site staff responsible for entering the clinical data into the eCRF will b e 
determined in advance . If additional corrections are needed, the responsible monitor or Data 
Manager will raise a query in the EDC application . The appropriate study site staff will 
answer queries sent to the Investigator . This will be audit trailed by t he EDC application , 
meaning that the name of investigational staff, time and date stamp are captured.  
The eCRF is essentially considered a data entry form and should not constitute the original 
(or source) medical records unless otherwise specified . Source  documents are all documents 
VHsquared Ltd   61 
Protocol V56502  
Drug Name: V565  
02 December 2016   Confidential  
 and sources of information used by the Investigator  or hospital that relate to the subject’s 
medical history, that verify the existence of the subject, the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
and all records covering the subject’s  participation in the study . They include laboratory 
notes, ECG results, memoranda, pharmacy dispensing records, subject files, etc.  
The Investigator  is responsible for maintaining source documents . These will be made 
available for inspection by the study monitor at each monitoring visit . The Investigator  must 
submit a completed eCRF for each subject who receives study drug , regardless of duration . 
All supportive documentation submitted with the eCRF, such as laboratory or hospital 
records, should be clearl y identified with the study and subject number . Any personal 
information, including subject name, should be removed or rendered illegible to preserve 
individual confidentiality.  
eCRF  records will be automatically appended with th e identification of the cre ator by means 
of their unique UserID . Specified records will be electronically signed by the Investigator  to 
document his/her review of the data and acknowledgement that the data are accurate . This 
will be facilitated by means of the Investigator ’s unique UserID and password; date and time 
stamps will be added automatically at time of electronic signature . If an entry on an eCRF 
requires change, the correction should be made in accordance with the relevant software 
procedures . All changes will be fully reco rded in a protected audit trail, and a reason for the 
change will be required.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA ). Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization 
(WHO ) Drug Dictionary and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) system . Concomitant 
diseases /medical history  will be coded using MedDRA .  
7.3 Quality Assurance  Audit  
Study  sites, the study database and study documentation may be subject to Quality Assurance 
audit duri ng the course of the study by the Sponsor or Quintiles  on behalf of the Sponsor . In 
addition, inspections may be conducted by regulatory bodies at their discretion .

 8.0 STATISTICS  
8.1 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size is based on being able to claim su periority of V565 over placebo; the 
primary endpoint is defined as a response rate, based on CDAI reduction/remission and CRP  
or FCP results.  
It is assumed that the proportion of subjects assigned to placebo treatment who respond is 
0.15. A clinically imp ortant response rate on V565 is defined as 0.4.  
A 2:1 (V565:placebo) allocation, 80% power and 5% statistical significance rate estimate 
76:38 evaluable subjects will be required for this study. With a 10% estimated non -evaluable 
rate, a total of 126 subje cts (84:42) are planned to be randomised to treatment . 
Sample size estimates are based on a Pearson chi -square test for two proportions and are 
generated using SAS Power and Sample Size v13.2.   
A subgroup of subjects will be assessed by endoscopy for change s in overall mucosal 
appearance and changes in SES -CD. However, the study is not powered to show a difference 
in these  endpoint.  
8.2 Statistical Methods  
The default summary statistics for continuous variables include number of contributing 
observations [n], me an, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum , and maximum .  
For categorical variables, the number and percentage (the percentage of subjects in each 
category relative to the total number of subjects in the relevant analysis population or relative 
to the to tal number of subjects in the relevant analysis population, with assessments available 
[where appropriate]) in each category will be the default summary presentation.  
Unless otherwise specified, “Baseline” is defined as the last observed value of the para meter 
of interest prior to the first intake of study medication (this includes unscheduled visits). For 
numerical variables, change from Baseline  will be calculated as the difference between the 
value of interest and the corresponding baseline value.  
Unles s otherwise specified, all formal statistical tests will be two -sided at the 5% significance 
level. Point estimates of treatment differences will be accompanied with two -sided 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) where applicable .  
In the case of normality assum ption violation s, appropriate non -parametric methods  will be 
used for analysis .  
All data will be presented in by -subject listings . 
The statistical analysis will be performed using SAS® Version 9.2 or higher.

 8.2.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary clinical efficacy endpoint of the study is the proportion of subjects at Day 42  
that have both CDAI ≥70 -point reduction from Baseline  or CDAI <150 , and a reduction of 
≥40% from the baseline value of CRP or FCP.  
The primary endpoint will be analy sed using a logistic regression model with treatment as the 
fixed effect and prior anti -TNF α therapy , baseline CDAI score, baseline CRP and baseline 
FCP values as covariates . For the active treatment versus placebo comparison, the results will 
be presented in terms of an odds ratio together with its associated 95% CI and 2 -sided p -
value.  Two-sided 95% CIs  for the odds ratio will be provided.  
Possible effects of any other covariates may also be investigated . Details of such analyses 
will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP). Missing data handling and possible 
sensitivity analysis will be desc ribed in the SAP.  Details of specific alternative  statistical  
methods  in the event model assumptions are violated  will be documented in the SAP.  
8.2.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
The secondary endpoints below  will be analy sed using the same model as used in the  primary 
endpoint analysis.  
 Proportion of subjects achieving a ≥100 -point reduction in CDAI score and a 
concomitant reduction of 50% in CRP or FCP at Day 42  
 Proportion of subjects achieving a ≥70 -point reduction in CDAI score at Day 42  
 Proportion of subjects achieving a ≥100 -point re duction in CDAI score at Day 42  
 Proportion of subjects achieving a CDAI score of <150 CDAI at Day 42  
For the PRO -2 score assessments, the changes in total scores from Baseline to Day 14 and 
Day 42 will be analysed using a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures  (MMRM) with 
treatment as the fixed effect, prior anti -TNFα and baseline scores as covariates.  
8.2.3 Exploratory Analyses  
The exploratory endpoint evaluating the proportion of subjects achieving CRP (or FCP) 
levels within normal limits at Day 14 and Day 42 will be summarised using frequency and 
percentage .  
The endpoints evaluating changes in CDAI score over time and changes in CRP (or FCP ) 
results over time will be summarised using descriptive statistics.  
The anti -V565 antibody responses will be summarised and  listed for the safety ( SAF) 
population.  
Changes from Baseline in the frequency of loose or watery stools ( BSFS Type 6 and Type 7 ) 
and changes in NPS scores (both averaged over 7 consecutive days) will be summari sed

4. INTRODUCTION  
 
The algorithm- based treatment study with staphylococcal blood stream infection evaluates 
the safety and efficacy of a treatment algorithm to reduce the use of vanco mycin in adult 
patients with blood stream infections due to staphylococci. This statistical analysis plan was 
developed based on the information contained in the study protocol DMID 09-0080. Tables, 
Figures and Listings  of DSMB and final study report s are displayed in separate document s. 
The purpose of this analysis plan is to provide a detailed description of the planned statistical analysis of the safety and efficacy  endpoints presented for monthly safety monitoring , 
DSMB , and final study reports.  
4.1 Study Design  
This is a phase 2, multi -center, randomized, open- label comparative study to assess the safety 
and efficacy of a treatment algorithm to reduce the use of vancomycin in adult patients with blood stream infections due to staphylococci. It is a multice nter trial conducted in 16 sites - 15 
sites in the United States (US) and 1 site in Spain. The study will last about six years . The 
total enrollment is of approximately 500 patients at least 18 years of age who have a blood stream infection with staphylococ ci (see details in Sample size and Power section). 
Randomization will be 1:1 Algorithm vs SOC in permuted randomized blocks by site using an interactive voice randomization system (IVRS). As the primary safety and efficacy endpoint, cure rate will be recorded at Final Test of Cure (T OC) evaluation  following last 
dose of antibiotic , which will be evaluated at 28 ± 4 days  for CoNS infections  and at  42 
± 4 days  for S. aureus infections  by telephone call or  clinic visit. Early TOC , by telephone 
call or  clinic v isit, will be recorded between [10, 24] days for CoNS and [17, 31] days for 
S.aureus infections. If patient terminates study early for any reason, TOC assessment should be performed at the time of termination . 
 Safety analysis will include analysis of all AEs leading to study  drug withdrawal and all  
SAEs  recorded on case report form , and t he incidence rates of change from vancomycin or a 
protocol- approved study antibiotic to another protocol -approved study antibiotic due to AE 
associated with study drug . In order to demonstrate that algorithm- based treatment  of patients 
with blood stream infection can decrease antimicrobial usage when compared to current SOC,  duration of treatments will be compared as our secondary efficacy endpoint.

In addition to the investigator evaluation of clinical outcomes, a Clinical Event 
Committee ( CEC ) will adjudicate the following events  for at least 5 0 patients or 
~ 12 patients per year for the 4 years of study enrollment :  1) establishing the presence 
and significance of PENS antibiotics; 2) evaluating patient outcome in a randomly 
selected cohort of study patients; and 3) adjudicate death for attribution.  We will use 
the adjudicated outcomes if they are available.   
4.2 Sample Size and Power  
Sample size calculation (N=500) will be performed based on primary efficacy endpoint, 
which is the cure rate at final TOC. We assume that both treatments have an equal cure rate 
of 75%. Under a non-inferiority margin of 15% and a consideration of 28% drop out rate, 
with approximately 250 subjects per treatment, the study will have at least 90% power for 
establishing non- inferiority at a significance level of 5% (2 -sided). See reference [1] chapter 
4 for details about sample size calculation for testing non- inferiority .In order to validate these 
assumptions, and to confirm the appropriate target number of patients, a blinded sample size 
re-estimation will be performed after 250 patients have been enrolled and completed the final 
TOC visit, and also after 350 patients have been enrolled and completed the final TOC visit.  
The sample size re- estimation will be reviewed by the DSMB  and the DSMB will provide 
recommendations. The Executive Committee will  determine an appropriate course of action. 
If the sample size re- estimation performed at 350 patients enrolled confirms that at least 80% 
power can be achieved by enrolling 400 patients as indicated in Table 3  in the protocol, the 
total patient target will be reduced to 400 enrolled patients.  
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  PLAN

Patients who discontinue after beginning treatment will not be replaced; Patients who 
discontinue after randomization and before starting treatment will be replaced.     
4.3 Randomization 
 
Approximately 500 subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment arms (Algorithm and 
SOC) using an interactive voice randomization system (IVRS) . Randomization will be 1:1 
Algorithm vs SOC in permuted randomized blocks by site. The randomization code will be 
generated by statistician (s) at DCRI.  
 
5. OBJECTIVES  
5.1 Primary   
 
The primary object of this trial is to  (1) demonstrate that the clinical efficacy of algorithm -
based treatment  of patients with  staphylococcal blood stream infection is noninferior to 
current standard of care (SOC); ( 2) evaluate the safety of algorithm- based treatment  as an 
alternative to current SOC.  
 
5.2 Secondary  
 
The secondary object of this trial is to demonstrate that algorithm- based treatment of patients 
with staphylococcal blood stream infection can decrease antimicrobial usage  when compared 
to current SOC . 
 
6. SAFETY AND EFFICACY ENDPOINTS 
6.1   Primary Endpoint s 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the cure rate of subjects who were classified as either 
“Success” (see Protocol  sections 3.2.3.1 and  3.2.3.8) , “Failure” (see Protocol section 
3.2.3.1), or “Non-Evaluable” (see Protocol section 3.2.3.1) at final TOC .

Non-Evaluable  [Protocol 3.2.3.1]  Failure  [Protocol 3.2.3.1]  
Meet  the following Criteria : Failure  
for Administrative Reasons (e.g., 
patient withdraws consent for study participation; patient discontinues medical treatment against medical advice; patient withdrawn from the study; patient lost to follow -up) in 
patients who do not fail for other reasons . 
  Patients will be classified as “Failure” at or before final TOC if they meet any of the following Criteria*:  
a.   Were judged “Failure” at early or final TOC by the Site PI or designated SI  
b. Treatment was changed due to Uns atisfactory 
Clinical Response defined as failure to resolve clinical manifestations of infection (e.g. fever, elevated WBC count).  
c. Had persisting or relapsing infection (Section 
3.2.3.2 and Section 3.2.3.3,   respectively). 
d. Identification of a New Complicated 
Staphylococcal Infection (Section 3.2.3.5) not known to be present at either randomization or after completion of study treatment for their baseline clinical classification of bacteremia.  These patients will be retained in their original group a nd counted as treatment failures.  
e. Died prior to early or final TOC evaluation. 
 * if patients fail prior to the  final TOC visit, final TOC assessments can be conducted at the time of failure and the patient can be classified as completing the study at that time.

Safety analysis will also include analysis of all AEs leading to study drug withdrawal and a ll 
SAEs recorded on case report form, and the incidence rates of change from vancomycin or a 
protocol-approved study antibiotic to another protocol-approved study antibiotic due to AE 
associated with study drug.  
 
6.2   Secondary Endpoint  
 
The secondary endpoint (see Protocol 3.2.1)  is antibiotic days in support of the secondary 
objective for the Per protocol population after excluding the patients with  a complicated 
staphylococcal infection  after randomization but prior to the completion of study treatment 
for their baseline clinical classification of bacteremia  (i.e., on PPE population).  
 
 
 
6.3 Endpoints for Sensitivity Analyses  
 
For assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint, missing values at final TOC assessment will 
be counted as missing, or imputed by early TOC  for the sensitivity analysis.

6.4 Endpoints for Exploratory Analyses  
 
The exploratory outcome measures include:  (a) Cure rate, the days of antibiotic , and days to discontinuation (using survival analysis 
methods) for the following diagnostics subgroups in the ITT and PP populations, 
respectively:  
1.  Cohort of CoNS  
2.  Sub-cohort of simple CoNS 
3.  Sub-cohort of Uncomplicated CoNS  
4. Cohort of S. aureus Bacteremia 
5. Sub-Cohort within uncomplicated S. aureus Bacteremia; (b) Vancomycin  MIC values to investigate potential associations to clinical outcomes (e.g., 
cure rates, duration of bacteremia on  treatment , and incidence of development of new 
complicated staphylococcal infection).   
 The above cohorts recorded in INFORM, that were evaluated by site PIs , will also be 
compared by  the derived cohort (defined in protocol Table 1). 
 
7. STUDY POPULATION  
 
● Intent- To-Treat (ITT) Population: All patients who are randomized in the study.   
 ●Per Protocol Population (PP):  Patients  from ITT population meeting any of the following 
criteria will be EXCLUDED from PP analysis:  
a) Received a PENS antibiotic 
b) Did not undergo removal of intravascular catheter suspected to be infected . Note that 
patients with simple CoNS bacteremia may retain the catheter; all other patients 
should have their catheter(s) removed 
c) Had blood stream infection with a vancomycin- resistant staphy lococcus; or a 
staphylococcus resistant to protocol- identified alternative drugs if these were used  
d) Discontinued study medication prematurely for reasons other than clinical failure  
e) Did not undergo final TOC assessment

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  PLAN    
  
  11 
●Per Protocol Population after excluding the patients with  complicated staphylococcal  
infection  (PPE): Patients  from PP population who did not have a complicated staphylococcal 
infection . 
● MITT Population: Subjects in ITT population and who either completed the study, or 
discontinued the study.  This population is used for DSMB only  if ITT and MITT are 
different . 
 
 
8. HALTING RULES  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will define halting rules in their charter. The 
DSMB will consider stopping the trial if one or more of the following conditions occur:  
 
1. In the patients with simple or uncomplic ated bacteremia, there is evidence that the 
incidence of SAEs in the algorithm group is >= 20% higher than the standard of care  group 
(SOC) and is not by chance alone (defined as P -value <0.05). 
 2. In patients with simple or uncomplicated infections, the incidence of persisting and/or  
relapsing infections is >= 20% higher in the algorithm group than the SOC group and is  not 
by chance alone (defined as P -value <0.05). See protocol section s 3.2.3.2 and 3.2.3.3 for 
definitions of persisting and relapsing infection.  3. In all randomized patients, there is >= 20% difference in the death rate between the SOC 
and algorithm group and is not by chance alone (defined as P-value <0.05).  To assure adequate data is available, halting rule analysis will be performed pr ior to  DSMB 
meetings after 125, 250 and 350 patients have enrolled and completed the Test  of Cure visit. 
The DSMB will evaluate the halting rule results during regularly scheduled DSMB meetings 
and will decide if the trial may proceed or should be stopped during each meeting.  
 
9. STATISTICAL METHODS  
9.1   General Analysis Conventions/Rules 
 
● Continuous variables: Descriptive statistics for continuous variables will be displayed as the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum within the subjects with non- missing values. Efficacy data will be tabulated to count 3 
categories:  total number of subjects, success responders, number of subjects who had non -
missing assessments.   
 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  PLAN    
  
  12 
● Discrete variables: Categorical variables will be provided with the counts and percentages 
in each category, within the subjects with non-missing values.  
 
● Level of statistical significance: Unless specified otherwise, any tests of hypotheses are 
two-sided and the nominal level of significance will be 5%; and p- values will be obtained 
based on two- sided tests. No intra -block correlat ion will be assumed in statistical analysis of 
the collected data.  
● Computer software: SAS statistical analysis software version 9. 2 (or newer version), (SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC) , will be used for statistical analyses on a UNIX operating system at 
DCRI.  
9.2 Baseline Comparability  
 
Patient disposition in terms of the number and percent of patients enrolled by site will be 
tabulated. The number of patients randomized, number completing the study, and reasons for discontinuation, reasons for exclusion from the PP population will b e summarized by 
treatment group within each cohort. Patient demographics and baseline characteristics such as age, weight, route of a cquisition of infe ction (nosoc omial, health -care asso ciated and 
community-acquired), and comorbid condit ion(s)  will be tabulated and compared across 
treatment groups within each cohort. All comparisons will be performed by use of the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel ( CMH ) test for categorical variables and two -way analysis of 
variance ( ANOVA) for continuous variables . If statistically significant difference s in 
demographic or patient  characteristics (potential confounding risk factors) of the enrolled 
patients between treatments are detected,  they will be used as the covariates adjusted in a 
logistic  regression model  (SAS LOGISTIC procedure) model for the primary endpoint. The 
odds ratios for  ABT v ersus SOC  together with the two -side 95% confidence intervals and 
corresponding p- values will be summarized. Similarly, i f statistically significant differences 
for the parameters among the sites are detected, analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA) will be 
performed to compare the days of antibiotic use between treatments with the confounding factor of site and the above parameters that have significant differences among sites.  
   
9.3 Handling of Missing Data  
 
Missing efficacy data will be handled as follows : subjects who had infection and missing 
values in efficacy variable at final TOC will be considered as treatment failure for the 
primary analys es. If a subject was randomized without  infection, the efficacy variable will be 
missing, and will not be included in efficacy analysis.  For assessment of the primary endpoint, missing values will be counted as missing, and imputed by early TOC for the sensitivity analysis.  
 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  PLAN    
  
  13 
 
9.4 Handling of Dupli cate Lab and E KG Data  
Handling of duplicate lab and ECG records from 2 samples drawn at the same date is  shown 
as follows: 
If one of the duplicate records can be identified as the unscheduled one from source document, only the scheduled record will be incl uded in the analyses.  
If duplicate records are collected all for the scheduled visit for some reason, worst case scenario will be applied in the analyses.  
All records will be included in the listings.  
  
9.5 Patient Disposition, Discontinuation and Baseline Da ta 
9.5.1    Patient Disposition, Discontinuation  
Number of subjects randomized, treated, completing the study and reasons for discontinuation will be summarized by treatment group.  
 
 
9.5.2    Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
In order to assess the baseline comp arability of the treatment groups, relevant data on the 
following demographic and baseline characteristics will be tabulated by treatment and overall 
for the ITT and per protocol population.   Demographics and Baseline Characteristics: Age (years), Race, E thnicity, Weight , BMI,  
route of a cquisition of infe ction (nosoc omial, health -care asso ciated and community-
acquired) and comorbid condition(s). 
     
9.6 Concomitant Medications  
 
Empiric treatment for Gram -negative pathogens is allowable; these agents will not be 
counted when calculating antibiotic days unless : 1) susceptibility testing of the bloodstream 
staphylococcal isolate reveals that the staphylococcus is susceptible to the antibiotic, and 2) 
the patient is not receiving other  protocol approved antistaphy lococcal treatment (e.g., 
methicillin -susceptible staphylococcal bloodstream isolate from a patient receiving empiric 
beta- lactam therapy for gram -negative infection ).  
 
A Medical Coder will code concomitant medications using a current version of the WHODR L dictionary. The number and percent of patients taking concomitant medications 
will be tabulated by treatment group.  
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  PLAN    
  
  14 
9.7 Statistical  Analyses 
9.7.1    Primary  Analyses 
 
The primary efficacy analysis is to compare cure rate between algorithm- based treatment  and 
SOC  treatment .  
 
Point estimates and the corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals for the  difference 
of cure rate in each treatment will be calculated. The large sample z -test for comparing the 
two proportions will be performed to test the inferiority with the pre -specified non- inferiority 
margin. The CMH test and ANOVA or ANCOVA will also be performed to compare the difference of the intrinsic differences in the clinical experiences and practices at each site, characteristics of enrolled patients (inclu ding route of a cquisition of infe ction), and variations 
in administering antibiotic dosing schemas  as appropriate.  If there is statistically significant 
difference for the above parameters among the sites detected, the logistic regression model with the c onfounding factor (s), which had significant difference among sites, will be used to 
comparing the cure rate between treatments.  The odds ratios of cure rate of  algorithm- based 
treatment  versus SOC therapy  together with the 95% confidence intervals , corresp onding p-
value will be summarized.  
Because safety will also be assessed as a primary endpoint in this trial, safety will be 
evaluated by comparing all SAEs in the algorithm -based treatment  and SOC treatment .   
 
9.7.2    Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
 The secondary analysis is to compare the days of antibiotic use between the algorithm- based 
treatment  and SOC treatment for the PP E population, which includes subjects having simple 
CoNS, or uncomplicated CoNS, or uncomplicated S. aureus .  For DSMB, compliance with 
study antibiotic days per protocol will be evaluated and compared by treatment. 
 
Patients in the simple or uncomplicated cohort who develop new complicated staphylococcal  
infection after the completion of study treatment for their baseline clinical classification of 
bacteremia will be remain ed in their original group and counted as failure.  They will be 
included in the PP analyses as treatment failures and their antibiotic days for their original grouping (e.g., the clinical group to which they had been assigned before being defined as 
having complicated infection) will be included in the Secondary analysis. 
 Patients in the simple or uncomplicated cohort who develop complicated staphylococ cal 
infection after randomization but prior to the completion of effecti ve treatment for their 
baseline clinical classification of bacteremia should remain in the PP analysis. Cure will be 
determined at their TOC visits.  These patients will be regrouped in the complicated bacteremia population of the algorithm.  
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  PLAN    
  
  15 
Point estimates and the corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals for the difference  
in the days of antibiotic use between the algorithm- based treatment  and SOC will be 
calculated. ANCOVA will be performed to compare the days of antibiotic use between 
treatments  after adjusting the organism and type of infections, and any significant  
confounding factor (s).  
 
Extent of exposure to study medication will be presented in terms of treatment duration  and 
mean daily dose.  A summary table will be provided for dose compl iance.  
 
9.7.3    Sensitivity Analyses  
  
Sensitivity analysis with respect to missing data imputation will be performed. More 
specifically, for the first step, we will construct the primary estimates and corresponding two-
sided 95% confidence intervals denoted as (L, U) of cure rate by imputing method specified 
in Section 11.3.6; for the second step, we will construct the secondary estimates  and 
corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals of cure rate without imputing the missing 
values, that is, treating miss ing as missing. If the secondary estimates drop in the 
corresponding (L, U), or their confidence intervals do overlay with the primary ones, then we 
can conclude that our primary analysis is robust. Otherwise, our conclusion based on the primary analysis w ill have limitations.  
9.7.4    Exploratory Analyses  
 
The exploratory analyses include compar isons of the treatment effects for the endpoints cure 
rate and the days of antibiotic for the following diagnostics subgroups in the ITT and PP 
populations, respectively: 
1.  Cohort of CoNS 
2.  Sub-cohort of simple CoNS 3.  Sub-cohort of Uncomplicated CoNS  
4. Cohort of S. aureus Bacteremia 
5. Sub-Cohort within uncomplicated S. aureus Bacteremia

In addition, potential associations between vancomycin MIC values and clinical outcomes 
(e.g., cure rates, duration of bacteremia on treatment , and incidence of development of new 
complicated staphylococcal infection) will be assessed as part  of exploratory efficacy 
analyses.   
 
9.8 Safety Analyses  
 
The safety analyses will be performed within the ITT population. All AEs leading to study 
drug withdrawal  and all  SAEs  will be collected and tabulated.  The incidence rates of change 
vancomycin or a protocol- approved study antibiotic to another protocol -approved study 
antibiotic due to AE associated  with study drug  will also be tabulated by each treatment 
group. Separate tabulations will list events according to seriousness, maximum severity, and 
worst possible association with study drug.  Other safety parameters, such as l aboratory data , 
will also be listed and summarized. 
 
 
9.8.1  Adverse Events  
The number of subjects who have or report at least one adverse event (AE) during the study will be tabulated for ea ch treatment group. The number of AEs reported by subject will be 
summarized for each treatment group. Subject  frequency counts and percentages by 
MedDRA current version 14.0 and update version lock will be presented by maximum 
severity for each treatment group.  
  
9.8.2  Laboratory Data 
Summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) for baseline values, actual values, changes from baseline, and percentage changes from baseline will be presented as appropriate by last visit, worst v alues (either minimum or maximum)  
among post- baseline visits , and  treatment group for the following 16 tests -- hemoglobin, 
hematocrit, WBC,  Platelet, A lkaline phosphatase, ALT (SGPT),  AST (SGOT),  Total 
bilirubin, BUN, C reatinine,  Calcium, Glucose, P otass ium, Sodium.  
 Echocardiography will be performed on all algorithm subjects  with a baseline blood culture 
positive for S. aureus  . The TEE is preferred over the TTE. The echocardiogram  will be 
interpreted by both the site ’s echocardiographer and an experie nced echocardiographer at the 
DCRI Echocardiography Core Laboratory .  A comparison between the site and central 
echocardiogram readings will be performed.  If there are discrepancies, then only the site 
interpretation will be reported on the eCRF and used for clinical decision -making at the study 
site.  Patient outcome at final TOC for those patients randomly selected for CEC adjudication 
of outcome will also be assessed by the CEC using the interpretation of the 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  PLAN    
  
  18 
Echocardiography Core Laboratory to ensure that no bias is introduced by the fact that the 
onsite clinicians interpreting the echocardiogram know the clinical condition of the patient. 
 
9.8.3  Vital Signs  
Summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) for 
baseline values, act ual values, changes from baseline, and percentage changes from baseline 
will be presented as appropriate by treatment group for vital signs data, including systolic 
blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature.  
 
10. MONTHLY SAFETY REP ORT  
The DSMB charter requests the DCRI to monitor the following event rates on a monthly 
basis:  
  
1. In the patients with simple or uncomplicated bacteremia, compare the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) between the algorithm and standard of care arm  
2. In patients with simple or uncomplicated infections, compare the incidence of persisting and/or relapsing infections between the algorithm and standard of care arm  
3. In all randomized patients, compare the death rate between the algorithm and stand ard of 
care arms  
  DCRI will also calculate the Fisher’s exact test comparing incidence rates between the two 
treatment groups, and send an e -mail alerting the study medical monitor if the test is 
significant at the 0.01 level. Table and listings shells ar e shown in Table 5, and listing 1- 1 
and listing 1 -2, respectively.  
   The medical monitor will inform the DSMB chair, who will determine whether an unplanned DSMB meeting(s) should be convened to study and review the event(s) in more detail.

5.2 Purpose of the Study  
This study will compare the clinical performance of  and DT1 lenses, both made of 
delefilcon A core material but with different manufacturing processes.  The primary endpoint 
was selected to fulfill the primary objective of the study. Procedures for meas urement of 
these endpoints were selected based on common practice for these assessments . The design 
of this study is justified based upon preclinical and clinical testing, as described within the 
Investigator’s Brochure.  DT1 lenses were chosen as the compa rator  product because these 
lenses have the same wear modality  and are made of the same core materia l. 
At the end of the study, a clinical study report will be prepared in accordance with applicable 
regulatory requirements and standards.  
There are no immed iate plans to submit the results of this study for publication; however, the 
results may be offered for publication if they are of scientific interest, or if the results relate to 
a product that is subsequently approved or cleared for marketing.  
5.3 Risks and Benefits  
The clinical investigation process risks are managed through appropriate training and 
monitoring according to the protocol -specific monitoring plan . Investigational device risks , 
including risks associated with use of device and methods and procedures for application of 
device , are defined in the investigator ’s brochure and/or product labeling and are managed 
through review of safety assessments outlined in this protocol.  
Contact lenses may offer improved peripheral vision and the convenienc e of not wearing 
spectacles. Material properties and design characteristics of the contact lens in development 
are features consi stent with successful contact lens wear.  
Based upon nonclinical testing, the new contact lens in development  is assessed to be 
nontoxic and biocompatible for on -eye use.  
The DT1 lenses a re for daily wear  use under a daily disposable wear  modality; further details 
on any known potential risks and benefits can be found in the package insert .

7 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1 Study Design  
This is a multi -site, prospective, randomized, 
 double -masked , contralateral  study comparing 2  contact lenses. The expected duration 
of subject participation in the study is approximately 4 days with 2 scheduled  visits. The 
study is expected to be completed in approximately 4 weeks.  
Figure  7-1 Study Design  
 
 
7.2 Rationale for Study Design  
This study design is justified based upon an evaluation of the results of releva nt preclinical 
and clinical testing, as described within the IB.   
The contralateral design will ensure that the same subject is exposed to both the test and 
comparator lenses at the same time; therefore,  
responses will be obtained for both lenses from the same subject.

Alcon – Business Use Only  7.3 Rationale for Duration of Treatment/ Follow -Up 
Subjects will wear test and comparator lenses contralaterally for approximately 4 days. The 
lenses will be provided by a qualified unmasked stud y staff member in such a manner that the 
subject and the investigator remain masked to the lens type. The primary  
 will be assessed on approximately the 4th day of wearing both lenses. The duration 
of using each study product is in  accordance with the respective product labeling (see 
package insert and IB).  
7.4 Rationale for Choice of Comparator  Product  
DT1 lenses were chosen as the comparator  product because these soft contact lenses have the 
same wear modality  and are made of the same core material . 
7.5 Data Monitoring Committee  
Not applicable . 
8 STUDY POPULATION  
The study population consists of male and female subjects age s 18 and older  with normal 
eyes (other than the need for  optical correction for  myopia ) and who are successful  spherical 
soft contact lens wearers in both eyes  for a minimum of 5 days per week and 10 hours per 
day during the past 3 months . The eligible study population will be representative of the 
investigational product target population.  
The aim is  to enroll  (consent)  approximately 110 subjects at approximately 7 sites in the US , 
with 14 (intended minimum) to 16  (intended maximum) subjects per site , and a target of 100 
total subjects completed . Site -specific targets may  vary based upon  individual site 
capabilities.

Study  
No other medical devices or medications are required to be used in conjunction with the 
treatments during the clinical study.  
9.3 Treatment Assignment / Randomization  
Qualifying subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment (lens es) in a 
contralateral sequence.   
Sequence  EDC/randomization integration system  
Sequence 1  LID220365 (OD)/LID006961 (OS) 
Sequence 2  LID006961(OD)/ LID220365 (OS)  
 
  
Only after signing the ICF, a subject will be assigned a subject number by the electronic data 
capture system.  
A randomization list will be generated using a validat ed system that automates the random 
assignment of treatment (lens sequence)  to randomization numbers in the specified ratio.  
Subjects will be assigned treatment (lens sequence) according to the randomization list 
uploaded in the EDC/ randomization integration system . The randomization list will be 
generated and maintained by  the study sponsor . 
At Visit 1, all eligible subjects will be randomized via the EDC/ randomization  integration  
system to one of the treatment s (lens sequence s). The investigator  or delegate will access the 
respective system after confirming that the subject meets all the eligibility criteria. A 
randomization number will be automatically assigned to the subject according to the subject 
randomization list but will not be communicate d to the site user. The EDC/ randomization  
integration  system will inform the site user of the treatment (lens sequence) assignment to be 
dispensed to the subject.  
9.4 Treatment masking

will occur only after all planned study data have been validated, and the database locked.  
Masked study personnel must avoid seeking information that may compromise mask ing. 
Unmasked study personnel must not disseminate information that is potentially unmasking to 
any masked personnel. The masked and unmasked site personnel must coordinate all study 
activities as necessary to protect masking and minimize bias during the s tudy.  
In the event of a medical emergency where the knowledge of subject treatment is required, an 
individual investigator  will have the ability to unmask the treatment assignment for a specific 
subject after contacting an appropriate study sponsor  represe ntative if time allows.  
9.5 Accountability Procedures  
Upon receipt of the IPs, the investigator  or delegate must conduct an inventory. During the 
study, unmasked  delegate s must provide the IPs to the subjects in accordance with their 
randomization assignment.  Throughout the study, the investigator  or delegate must maintain 
records of IP dispensation and collection for each subject. This record must be made available 
to the study monitor for the purposes of verifying the accounting of IP supplies. Any 
discrepan cies and/or deficiencies between the observed disposition and the written account 
must be recorded along with an explanation. All IPs sent to the investigator  must be 
accounted for by study sponsor  personnel, and in no case be used in an unauthorized 
situation.  
The investigator should make every effort to collect unused lenses, foils , and supplies from 
subjects.  
It is the investigator ’s responsibility to ensure that:

If a subject visit occurs between any regularly sch eduled visit  and the visit is conducted by 
study personnel , this visit must be documented as an unscheduled visit. If the subject seeks 
medical attention outside the clinic (for example, at an emergency room) or at the clinic but is 
seen by nonstudy person nel, the investigator is to capture adverse event -related information 
on the adverse event form upon becoming aware . 
During all unscheduled visits, the investigator  must conduct the following procedures:  
• Collect adverse event information , as applicable  
• Collect device deficiency information, as applicable  
• Record changes in medical condition or concomitant medication  
The investigator  may perform additional procedures for proper diagnosis and treatment of the 
subject. The investigator  must document this infor mation in the subject ’s case history source 
documents.  
If during an unscheduled visit the subject is discontinuing the IP or discontinuing from the 
study, the investigator  must conduct Exit procedures according to Table 3-1 Schedule of 
Study Procedures and Assessments and Section 10. 4.3, as possible . 
A subject may come in for an unplanned lens replacement if needed. Unplanned lens 
replacement is to be used in the event that the subject has no additional spare study lenses and 
in the e vent of a device deficiency or if a lens is lost or damaged, so as to maintain study lens 
wear until the follow -up visit .

Discontinued subjects are individuals who volun tarily withdraw or are withdrawn from the 
study by the investigator  after signing informed consent and after randomization to 
product/dispense of study product.  
Subject numbers of discontinued subjects must not be re -used (i.e., subject replacement is not 
allowed).  
Subjects may discontinue from study or study treatment at any time for any reason. Subjects 
may also be discontinued from study treatment at any time if, in the opinion of the 
investigator , continued treatment poses a risk to their health.  
If a subject discontinues from study treatment, every effort must be made to keep the subject 
in the study and to continue with the study assessments as specified in the schedule of study 
procedures and assessments until the final visit.  
For subjects discontinu ing from the study, the investigator  must complete all Exit procedures 
according to Table 3-1 Schedule of Study Procedures and Assessments and Section  10.4.3, if 
the subject is willing and able, and if in the opinion of the investigator  it is safe for the 
subject to do so.  
The investigator  must document the reason for study or treatment discontinuation in the 
subject ’s case history source documents.  
To ensure the safety of all subjects who discontinue early, investigator s must assess eac h 
subject and, if necessary, advise them of any therapies and/or medical procedures that may be 
needed to maintain their health.  
10.4.3  Schedule of Procedures and Assessments for Subjects Discontinued 
from Investigational Product  
Other than screen failures, if a  subject discontinues from the study, the subject should 
undergo an Early Exit Visit, as possible. Refer to Table 3 -1 for the required Early Exit

Device Deficiencies  
A device deficiency is inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety, or performance. A device deficiency may or may not be 
associated with patient harm  (i.e., ADE or SADE); however, not all ADEs or SADEs are due 
to a device deficiency. The Investigator should determine the applicable category listed in the 
device deficiency eCRF for the identified or suspect device deficiency and report any patient 
harm separately. Examples of device deficiencies include the following:  
• Failure to meet product specifications ( e.g., incorrect lens power/diameter/base 
curve/color)  
• Lens/solution cloudy  
• Lens surface/edge defect  
• Torn lens during handling/in pack  
• Packaging de ficit ( e.g., mislabeled product, tampered seal, leaking bottle/container)  
• Suspect product contamination  
• Lack of performance  
11.2 Monitoring for Adverse Events   
At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity to spontaneously mention any 
problems, the Investigator should inquire about AEs by asking the standard questions  shown 
below and report as applicable : 
• “Have you had any health problems since your last study visit? ” 
• “Have there been any changes in the medicines you take because of a new health issu e 
since your last study visit? ” 
In addition, c hanges  in any protocol -specific parameters and/or questionnaires evaluated 
during the study are to be reviewed by the Investigator. Any untoward (unfavorable and 
unintended) change in a protocol -specific parame ter or questionnaire response  that is

Alcon – Business Use Only  clinically relevant, in the opinion of the Investigator, is to be reported as an AE. These 
clinically relevant changes will be reported regardless of causality.   
11.3 Procedures for Recording and Reporting  
AEs are collected  from the time of informed consent . Any preexisting medical conditions or 
signs/symptoms present in a subject prior to the start of the study (i.e., before informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study and should be recorded in the medica l 
history section of the eCRF.  
In addition, temporary lens awareness or visual changes during the fitting process are not 
considered AEs if the Investigator assesses that the symptom(s) can reasonably resolve within 
the anticipated adaptation period.   
For each recorded event, the ADEs and SAEs documentation must include: date of 
occurrence, severity, treatment (if applicable), outcome, and assessments of the seriousness 
and causality. In addition, the Investigator must document all device deficiencies repor ted or 
observed with test and control product s on the device deficiency eCRF. The site must submit 
all available information on ADEs, SAEs, and device deficiencies to the study sponsor 
immediately as follows:  
• ADEs or SAEs  are documented on the Serious Adve rse Event and Adverse Device 
Effect eCRF within 24 hours of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness .  
• Device deficiencies are documented on the Device Deficiency eCRF within 24 hours 
of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness .  
• Additional relevant information after initial reporting must be entered into the eCRF as 
soon as the data become available.   
• Document any changes to concomitant medications on the appropriate eCRFs.  
• Document all relevant information from Discharge Summary , Autopsy Report,  
• Certificate of Death etc., if applicable, in narrative section of the Serious Adverse 
Event  and Adverse Device Effect eCRF.  
Note:  Should the EDC system become non -operational, the site must complete the 
appropriate paper Serious Adverse E vent and Adverse Device Effect  and/or Device Deficiency  
Form. The completed form is emailed to the Study Sponsor at msus.safety@Alcon.com  
according to the timelines outlined above; however, the reported informat ion must be entered 
into the EDC system once it becomes operational.

Alcon – Business Use Only  Study Sponsor representatives may be contacted for any protocol related question and their 
contact information is provided in the Manual of Procedures that accompanies this protocol.  
Further, depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency being reported, the Study 
Sponsor may request copies of applicable portions of the subject ’s medical records. The 
Investigator must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could have le d to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regulatory authorities or IRB/IEC.  
Intensity and Causality Assessments  
Where appropriate, the Investigator must assess the intensity (severity) of the AE based on 
medical judgment with consideration of any subje ctive symptom(s), as defined below:  
Intensity (Severity)  
Mild  An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily tolerate the sign or 
symptom.  
Moderate  An AE is moderate if the sign or symptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interf erence with the subject ’s usual activities.  
Severe  An AE is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject ’s inability to work or engage in their usual activities.  
 
For every AE in the study, the Investigator must assess the ca usality (Related or Not Related 
to the medical device or study procedure). An assessment of causality will also be performed 
by Study Sponsor utilizing the same definitions, as shown below:  
Causality  
Related  An AE classified as related may be either definitely related or possibly 
related where a direct cause and effect relationship with the medical 
device or study procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a 
reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the medical device or 
study procedure.  
Not Related  An AE classified as not related may either be definitely unrelated or 
simply unlikely to be related ( i.e., there are other more likely causes for 
the AE).  
The Study Sponsor will assess the AEs and may upgrade the Investigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality. The Study Sponsor will notify the Investigator of any AEs that is 
upgraded from nonserious to serious or from unrelated to related .

be returned and may include a PR# (if applicable ), which will be provided by Study Sponsor 
after the case is entered in the Study Sponsor ’s Global Product Complaint Management 
System (GPCMS). Refer to the MOP for details IP return.  
11.5 Unmasking of the Study Treatment  
Masked information on the identity of the assigned medical device should not be disclosed 
during the study (refer to Section 9.4).  If the treatment code needs to be broken in the interest 
of subject safety, the Investigator is encouraged to contact an appropriate Study Sponsor 
representative p rior to unmasking the information if there is sufficient time. Dependent upon 
the individual circumstances (i.e., medical emergency), the code may be broken prior to 
contact with the Study Sponsor. The Study Sponsor must be informed of all cases in which 
the code was broken and of the circumstances involved. Additionally, the Study Sponsor may 
be required to unmask the information in order to fulfill expedited regulatory  reporting 
requirements.  
11.6 Follow -Up of Subjects with Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the 
study and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the study.  
The Investigator should provide the Study Sponsor with any new saf ety information (which 
includes new AEs and changes to previously reported AEs) that may affect the safety 
evaluation of the device. For AEs that are unresolved/ ongoing at time of discontinuation , any 
additional information received at follow -up should be  documented in the eCRFs up to study 
completion (i .e., database lock).   Any additional data received up to 3 months after subject 
completed the study should be documented and available upon the Study Sponsor ’s request.  
All complaints received after this time period will be considered and processed as 
spontaneous (following the postmarket  vigilance procedures) and should be communicated to 
the medical device ’s manufacturer as per local requirements.

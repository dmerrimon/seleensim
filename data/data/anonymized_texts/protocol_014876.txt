Lay Summary
In this study, we investigate the effect of topically-applied latanoprostene bunod (LTB) on the blood flow at the nail
 fold of the 4th finger in patients with primary open angle glaucoma. LTB is a new anti-glaucoma eye drop which
 received FDA clearance in early November 2017. It has two components: the prostaglandin analog (PGA) which
 decreases intraocular pressure (IOP) by enhancing the drainage of the aqueous (the fluid in the front part of the eye)
 from the eye, and the nitric oxide (NO) moiety which naturally dilates arteries in the body. The capillaries at the nail
 fold are comparable to those of the optic nerve head, which makes them a reasonable surrogate for evaluation of the
 effect of LTB on the blood flow. Therefore, this study may provide indirect evidence for the beneficial effect of LTB on
 blood flow to optic nerve which can potentially save the optic nerve from glaucomatous damage.
Primary open angle glaucoma is a progressive condition and is the most common cause of irreversible blindness
 worldwide. Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a subset of the glaucomas defined by an open, normal
 appearing anterior chamber angle and raised intraocular pressure (IOP), with no other underlying disease.
In addition to LTB, we will use latanoprost (L), an-FDA approved PGA anti-glaucoma eye drop and normal saline (NS:
 the physiologic solution composed of 0.9% salt and water), as controls to make sure the effects of LPB on nail fold
 capillary blood flow is not due to its PGA (as L is) or due to the placebo effect (as NS is).
This study may also serve as background information for the development of new anti-glaucoma medications which
 can be injected into the eye to facilitate blood flow to the optic nerve.
We will recruit 120 subjects with POAG at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai.  Participation in this study
 will take approximately 60 minutes in one visit, and entails having NFC videos recorded after application of cedar oil
 and again after application of glaucoma drops, as well as having basic medical information recorded, such as height,
 weight, BMI, pulse and blood pressure.

3. Summary - Background
Objectives
The objective of this study is to assess changes in the nail fold capillary (NFC) blood flow after nailfold (NF)
 application of Iantanoprostene bunod (LTB) in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) patients compared to change
 in NFC blood flow after NF application of latanoprost 0.005% or saline.
Background
Nitric Oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilation in response to vascular shear stress operates via the intracellular receptor
 soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) stimulating production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) (1). Impaired NO
 signaling plays an important role in POAG. Impaired retinal arteriole (2) and brachial (3) artery autoregulation has
 been demonstrated in POAG after increased shear stress. Furthermore, reduced resting blood flow in the retina,
 choroid, and extraocular vessels exists in POAG (4-6). 
NF capillaroscopy is a noninvasive technique for in vivo imaging of capillaries near the fingernail and has a role
 in diagnosis of rheumatic conditions (7).  NFC morphological (8) and hemodynamic (9) abnormalities have been
 demonstrated in POAG. These abnormalities may be mediated in part by impaired NO signaling. LTB is a dual acting
 antiglaucoma agent that contains a PGA and a NO donator. 
Improving optic nerve head microcirculation may protect the optic nerve from glaucomatous degeneration. The
 NF microcirculation has layers of hairpin looped capillaries that are comparable to the optic nerve circulation (10).
  NF application of LTB may result in increased levels of cGMP (11) or S-nitrosylation of hemoglobin which may
 enhance conductive vasodilation (12).  We do not expect LTB applied to the NF to have an effect on optic nerve
 microcirculation; however, should intracameral delivery of LTB be developed, the data generated here may be useful
 background information for optic nerve microcirculatory studies that would ensue.

Primary and Secondary Study Endpoints
We will assess change in NFC blood flow after NF application of LTB in POAG patients. This is a parallel, masked
 3-arm randomized trial consisting of normal saline, latanaprost 0.005% and LTB 0.024%. Patients will have
 baseline NFC blood flow measurements after application of cedar oil.  Then we will use NF application of either
 normal saline, latanoprost 0.005% or LTB 0.024% in random sequence.  The patient and imager will know which
 study drug is applied.  NFC blood flow will be remeasured after 15 minutes.  NF article application will occur on a
 specially designed well applied to the 4th digit of the nondominant hand.  The readers will make all NFC blood flow
 measurements in masked fashion.  
The endpoint of the study is to measure the change in NFC blood flow 15 minutes after NF application to the 4th digit
 of the nondominant hand.
The secondary endpoint is to determine if the change in NFC blood flow after LTB will be greater than the change
 seen with either normal saline or latanoprost.

10. Subjects - Risk and Benefits
Risks to Subjects
There are no essential risks to the subjects. LTB is an FDA-approved drug with essentially no systemic side effects.
 NF capillary drug application is equivalent to taking a single ocular dose of medicine that delivers 0.76 micrograms of
 drug to a volume of circulation of 70 liters. 
Risks of application of cedarwood oil:  A very rare but potential effect of mild irritation when applying cedar essential
 oil to the skin has been reported.
Risks of LTB and Latanoprost:  There is also the remote possibility that the glaucoma drops could cause an allergic
 reaction or cause irritation to the nailfold, both of which would result in redness and itching and would be easily
 treated by washing the affected area with soap and water.
Description of Procedures Taken to Lessen the Probability or Magnitude of Risks 
The research team that has been assembled has sufficient expertise and experience to conduct the research.  The
 inclusion/exclusion criteria will allow us to enroll only the desired population of interest. The experimental procedure
 will take place while the subject is here for their standard of care examination.  Data will be stored in such a way that
 it is impossible to connect research data directly to the
individuals from whom or about the data pertain. Access to key codes will be limited and stored separately from the
 data.
Provisions for Research Related Harm / Injury
In case of injury due to the study, the investigator will be alerted and medical care will be provided.  Care for such
 injury will be billed in the ordinary manner to the subject.
Expected Direct Benefit to Subjects
There are no expected direct benefits to subjects. This is a proof of principle study to demonstrate that LTB may have
 acute microculatory effects.
Benefit to Society
The benefit from the data obtained may be useful scientifically and we hope to learn from this study which will
 potentially benefit the patients in the future
Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects
The investigator will establish ahead of time what de-identified information will be revealed to whom and under what
 circumstances, and will communicate these provisions to protect the privacy interests of the subjects in a clear
 language through the informed consent process. 
Authorized medical release forms will be requested from the subject should they decide to dictate whom is allowed to
 view their results.
In all disclosures outside of Mount Sinai, subjects will not be identified by name, social security number, address,
 telephone number, or any other direct personal identifier unless disclosure of the direct identifier is required by law.
 Some records and information disclosed may be identified with a unique code number.
Economic Impact on Subjects
All research procedures will be paid for by the study.  Being in this research study will not lead to extra costs for the
 subject.

11. Procedures - Narrative
Description of the Study Design
We will assess change in NFC blood flow after NF application of LTB in POAG patients. This is a parallel, masked 3-
arm randomized trial consisting of normal saline, latanaprost 0.005% and LTB 0.024%. 
Description of Procedures Being Performed
Patients will be consented prior to any study-related interventions. Patients will have baseline NFC blood flow
 measurements after application of cedar oil.  Then we will use NF application of either normal saline, latanoprost
 0.005% or LTB 0.024% in random sequence.  The patient and imager will know which study article is applied.  NFC
 blood flow will be remeasured after 15 minutes.  NF article application will occur on a specially designed well applied
 to the 4th digit of the non-dominant hand.   
We believe that the same capillaries will be visualized before and after treatment, due to the limited width of the
 fingertip. The procedure for NFC videography is to sample consecutive capillaries, pausing on each capillary until
 blood flow was visualized. If no blood flow is visualized after 10 seconds in focus, the immediate medial capillary
 is assessed in similar fashion. Blood flow for 10 seconds on each of the first five visible capillaries is captured. We
 believe that this method will allow us to capture flow in the same capillaries pre- and post-treatment.
We will measure pulse and blood pressure at baseline and after NF drug application for safety purposes. We will also
 collect height and weight in order to adjust for body mass index in our analyses.
The readers will make all NFC blood flow measurements in masked fashion. 
We will assess change in NFC blood flow after NF application of LTB in POAG patients. This is a parallel, masked 3-
arm randomized trial consisting of normal saline, latanaprost 0.005% and LTB 0.024%. Patients will have baseline
 NFC blood flow measurements after application of cedar oil.  Then we will use NF application of either normal saline,
 latanoprost 0.005% or LTB 0.024% in random sequence.  The patient and imager will know which study article is
 applied.  NFC blood flow will be remeasured after 15 minutes.  Preliminary data on controls suggests that 15 minutes
 is sufficient time to see a change in blood flow.   NF article application will occur on a specially designed well applied
 to the 4th digit of the non-dominant hand.  Two masked observers will evaluate NFC blood flow using the method
 described below.
Description of Nailfold Video Capillaroscopy:
A BK-XW880 nailfold video capillaroscope at 300x magnification (Biobase Meihua Trading Co., Jinan, Shandong,
 China) will be used to image nailfold capillaries. Cedarwood oil is applied to the finger skin to achieve adequate
 focus. The subject orients their hand in the prone position and the lateral-most edge of the nailfold of the fourth
 finger of the non-dominant hand is imaged. We chose this sampling protocol to minimize the effect of local trauma
 on nailfold capillary hemodynamics.  Consecutive capillaries are sampled, pausing on each capillary until blood flow
 is visualized. If no blood flow is visualized after 10 seconds in focus, the immediate medial capillary is assessed
 in similar fashion. Blood flow for 10 seconds on each of the first five visible capillaries is captured. This method is
 repeated pre- and post-NF article application. 
Nailfold videos are converted to image sequences and imported into ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health,
 Bethesda, MD) to measure blood speed, diameter, and flow. Each capillary is cropped out of the image sequence
 spanning the duration of visible blood flow for the given capillary. The cropped image sequence is registered using
 StackReg, an open-source ImageJ plugin. Two readers masked to case status will validate the measurement
 methods. Because morphological abnormalities such as tortuosity and hemorrhaged capillaries are present in POAG
 and morphology may affect resistance to blood flow within the vessel, a straight segment of the capillary is used for
 analysis. Each reader will track the first visible void in the blood column between the first pair of consecutive frames
 in which the blood column void is clearly defined in both frames as performed in other studies. The time elapsed
 between consecutive frames is calculated based on the frame per second rate of the video (25 frames per second).
 The distance in microns covered by the blood column void is divided by the reciprocal of the frames per second rate
 to generate blood speed in microns per second. Each reader will also measure diameter of the vessel in the vicinity
 of the blood column void. Assuming a circular geometry for the lumen on the vessel, the cross-sectional area of the
 vessel is then calculated. Capillary blood flow is calculated by multiplying blood speed by cross-sectional area of the
 vessel.
Description of the Source Records that Will Be Used to Collect Data About Subjects 
All data collected will be primary source data.  We will collect the diagnosis of POAG from the subject's electronic
 medical record. We will obtain medical history data from electronic charts as well.  Interventional data that will be
 collected specifically for this project include NF capillaroscopy, blood pressure and pulse readings, which will be
 performed by the imager and recorded in an electronic data file using de-identified subject id numbers.
Description of Data that Will Be Collected Including Long-Term Follow-Up
1. Obtain baseline height, weight, blood pressure, pulse.  
2. Perform NF capillaroscopy (including placing a drop of cedarwood oil on the patient's cuticle) pre-intervention. 
3. Obtain blood pressure, pulse, and NF capillaroscopy 15 minutes after intervention.
4.     Obtain medical history from electronic chart after visit: age, sex, ancestry, body mass index, baseline blood
 pressure, baseline pulse, hypertension (yes/no), diabetes mellitus (yes/no), current smoker (yes/no), use of
 antiplatelet or anticoagulant, maximum known IOP, current IOP, current cup-disc ratio, current mean deviation and
 pattern standard deviation from worse eye from the latest reliable Humphrey visual field test.
There will not be any long-term followup for this study.

The study will be verbally explained to the potential subject by the participating physicians and study staff after their
 standard of care visit, who will provide all pertinent information (purpose, procedures, risks, benefits, alternatives
 to participation, etc.), and will allow the potential subject ample opportunity to ask questions.  Following this verbal
 explanation, the potential subject will be provided with a consent form and will be afforded sufficient time to consider
 whether or not to participate in the research. After allowing the potential subject time to read the consent form, the
 investigator or study staff will answer any additional questions the potential subject may have and will obtain verbal
 agreement and written agreement to participate in the research, by signing the informed consent form.  The entire
 informed consent process will take place in a private room at the study site, Suite 500 of the South Building of the
 New York Eye and Ear Infirmary,
Waiting Period for Obtaining Consent
The subject will be afforded sufficient time to consider whether or not to participate in the research. Sufficient time in
 this study should be minutes, which should be how long it would reasonably take to evaluate the procedures, risks,
 potential benefits, and potential alternatives.

This is a study to measure the NFC blood flow after NF application of LTB in 120 POAG patients compared to change
 in NFC blood flow after NF application. The study is powered to assess the hemodynamic effects for pre- vs. post-
nailfold application of LTB. We do not have resources to generate consents in different languages or to employ
 interpreters. There is no therapeutic benefit for study participation.

Duration Data Will Be Stored
Study records will be maintained for approximately 6 years, for the purpose of analysis, published reports and
 followup. Although the study will consist of a single visit for each subject, the subjects will be asked for permission to
 be contacted at a
future date.
Steps That Will Be Taken to Secure the Data During Storage, Use, and Transmission
During the informed consent process, subjects will be informed of the precautions that will be taken to protect the
 confidentiality of the data and be informed of the parties who will or may have access (e.g., research team, FDA,
 OHRP). This will allow subjects to decide about the adequacy of the protections and the acceptability of the possible
 release of private information to the interested parties. 
Provisions for protecting privacy and/or confidentiality are relevant at all stages of research, including subject
 identification and recruitment, research participation, and analysis of individually identifiable data. 
To minimize potential risks, observations would be recorded whenever possible in a manner that does not allow
 participants to be identified, either directly or through identifiers linked to them. When identifiers are necessary for the
 research, adequate provisions for maintaining the confidentiality of the data are required.
Power Analysis/Data Analysis Plan (Including Any Statistical Procedures)
Chi squared and unpaired t-tests will be used for between group comparisons.  Paired t-tests will be used for pre- to
 post-NF drug application comparisons. Multivariable analysis will be performed to determine if NFC LTB application
 is an independent predictor of change in NFC blood flow from baseline to after drug application. 
Power calculations indicate that with our sample size of 120 we have 90% power to detect changes in blood flow
 difference between baseline and after NF application  in the latanoprost group versus normal saline group and  in
 the LTB group versus the normal saline controls.  We have 80% power to detect changes in blood flow difference
 between baseline and after NF application in the LTB group versus latanoprost group. These calculations are based
 on a 1:2:2 sampling ratio, a type 1 error rate of 5% and 30% variance in measurement of NFC blood flow.  We
 assume that because latanoprost itself will upregulate NO, that LTB will enhance NO donation by another 50%.

20. Data - Safety Monitoring
More Than the Minimum Data
 Safety Monitoring Will Be DoneNo
  
  The following minimum requirements apply to all projects, including retrospective
 reviews of medical records, use of tissue samples, and many minimal risk studies, such
 as observational and survey research. Because these minimum requirements apply to
 all studies, a specific written DSMP will not usually be required for projects that do not
 pose greater than minimal risk to subjects. The MSSM PPHS may alter the required level of
 monitoring if appropriate. 
  For all projects, the principal investigator must have a plan to assure that data integrity
 will be maintained during its collection, storage and analysis. All research projects
 must adhere to MSSM recommendations on the storage of research data. Loss of data
 containing identifiable information is reportable to the IRB within 5 business days.
  Any problems concerning the consent process and any subject complaints should be
 monitored by the investigator. Reports of such problems must be made at least annually.
 The discretion of the protocol director will guide the need to report these problems
 immediately or more frequently.
  The principal investigator is, typically, the monitoring entity for the minimum DSMP. When
 a principal investigator is not a faculty member, the supervising faculty member must be
 responsible for the data and safety monitoring aspect of the protocol.

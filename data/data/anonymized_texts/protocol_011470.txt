  opioids  
• Evaluate the efficacy  and safety  of CAM2038 q1w and CAM2038 q4w administration for 
up to 52  weeks in the treatment of subjects with moderate to severe chronic pain requiring 
daily treatment with opioids.  
Methodology: 
This is a Phase III, placebo -controlled, multicenter study with an enriched- enrollment withdrawal 
(EEW) design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CAM2038 in opioid- experienced subjects 
with moderate to severe CLBP that requires continuous, around-the-clock (ATC) opioid treatment 
≥ 40 mg morphine equivalent dose (MED). The study includes 5 phases: A Screening Phase (up 
to 2 weeks), a Transition Phase (up to 2 weeks),  an Open -Label Titration  Phase  (up to 10 weeks),  a 
Double- Blind  Treatment Phase including a Final Study Visit (12 weeks), and a Follow-up Phase 
(4 weeks). The overall duration of participation in the core phase of the study (randomized 
Double- Blind  Phase) is up to 30 weeks, from the Screening Phase through the Follow-up Phase.  
 
Subjects will record their API at Screening and prior to the test dose on a paper diary at the site. 
Throughout the study, after subjects receive their first CAM2038 injection, they will record their 
WPI and API using the NRS-11 in an electronic diary. Subjects will be instructed to record their 
WPI and API once daily between 18:00 and 23:59 (i.e., 6:00 pm and 11:59 pm). Subjects will be 
instructed to make all attempts to rec ord their pain scores at the same time of day throughout the 
study. In addition, subjects will be instructed to record their pain intensity in the electronic diary 
on the NRS- 11 “at that moment” prior to taking rescue medication. Rescue medication use will  
also be recorded in the electronic diary.  
 
Following screening and confirmation of eligibility, subjects will enter a Transition Phase of up 
to 2 weeks during which their current opioid dose will be down-titrated by approximately 25% per day to:  
• ≤80 mg/day MED (for subjects whose opioid dose at screening is > 80 mg/day  MED)  
• or to ≤40mg/day MED (for subjects whose opioid dose at screening is between 40 mg/day and 79 mg/day MED).  
 
Following the down titration, subjects will be transitioned to an immediate -release (IR) morphine 
for at leas t 2 days before they enter the Open-L abel Titration Phase, as follows:  
• 15 mg 4 times daily [QID] for subjects whose MED at screening was ≥ 80 mg/day 
• 15 mg 3 times daily (TID) for subjects whose MED at screening was 40-79 mg/day. 
 
Subjects who were previously on BPN prior to Screening will not need to participate in the morphine IR phase. However, subjects who were previously on BPN will be required to refrain 
from taking BPN for 12- 24 hours as a washout prior to st arting open label titration on CAM2038. 
 
Following the morphine IR treatment, subjects will enter the Titration Phase. On Day 1 of the 
Titration Phase, subjects will return to the clin ic after a washout of at least  12 hours from their last 
morphine IR dose, or 12- 24 hours from their last BPN dose. Subjects who report a CLBP of ≥ 5 on 
the API scale and have a Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score of ≥5, will receive a 
BPN test dose (Buprenex®0.30 mg intramuscular [IM] injection) at the clinical site. After the 
Buprenex test dose, subjects will be assessed for any changes in QTcF (Fri dericia ’s corrected 
QTc) and withdrawal. Subjects who tolerate the BPN test dose, do not show an increase >30 ms in

  QTcF within 1 hour after the test dose, and have a COWS score of <5 within 15 minutes after the 
test dose will receive the first dose of SC CAM2038 q1w within 4 hours (+30 minutes) after the 
test dose (4 mg CAM2038 for subjects whose screening MED was betw een 40 mg/day and 79 
mg/day; and 8 mg CAM2038 for subjects whose screening MED was ≥80 mg/day).  
 
During the first week of the Titration Phase, subjects who experience significant pain may, at the 
discretion of the investigator, receive an additional dose at their corresponding CAM2038 q1w 
dosing level (4 mg or 8 mg respectively) on Day 3, 4 or 5. Subj ects will then attend clinic visits 
every week for dosage adjustment. Dose adjustments will be made by increasing the dose level of 
CAM2038 q1w at the scheduled weekly visits (doses of 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg, 16 mg, 24 mg, or 32 
mg per week). Subjects who require doses >32 mg/week will be discontinued from the study.  
 
Rescue medication, consisting of hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5 mg/325 mg every 4 to 6 hours 
(q4-6h), may be taken during the Titration Phase as needed (prn), up to 15 mg/975 mg/day (3 
tablets) for subjects whose MED at screening was 40 -79 mg/ day or  up to 30 mg/1950 mg/day (6 
tablets) for subjects whose MED at screening was ≥80 mg/day). The goal of the Titration Phase is to reach a stable dose of CAM2038 q1w that produces analgesia, by the end of the 10–week 
period.  
 
Eligible subjects will receive CAM2038 titrated to a dose that meets the following criteria:  
• Provides analgesia (i.e., 7- day mean API  ≤4) 
• The API is at least 2 points below the value at the start of CAM2038     titration  
• The dose of CAM2038 i s well -tolerated for 7 days before randomization (no adverse 
effects that require a change in study dosing or interruption) 
• Subject does not require, on average, more than one dose of rescue medication per day 
over the 7 days before randomization. 
 
Subjects who are stabilized and responding to their CAM2038 q1w dose (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, or 32 
mg) at the end of the Titration Phase and who fulfill the pre- defined randomization criteria will be 
randomized to one of two treatment groups in the 12-week Doub le-Blind Phase: 
• Group 1: CAM2038 (q1w or q4w) SC injections  
• Group 2: Placebo (q1w or q4w) SC injections  
 
During the Double -Blind Phase, all subjects who are receiving 4, 8 or 12 mg CAM2038 q1w at the 
end of  the Titration  Phase  will be randomized to continue their respective  CAM2038 q1w dosing (4 
mg, 8 mg  or 12 mg) or matching placebo q1w for a total treatment duration of 12 weeks. Subjects 
who are receiving 16 mg, 24 mg or 32 mg CAM2038 q1w at the end of the Titration Phase will be 
randomized to CAM2038 q4w 64 mg, 96 mg or 128 mg, respectively or to matching placebo q4w 
for a total treatment duration of 12 weeks.

Rescue medication, hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5 mg/325 mg q4-6h prn, will be allowed during the 
Double- Blind Phase (up to three tablets or 15 mg/975 mg/day for subjects whose MED at screening 
was between 40 -79 mg/day and up to six tablets or 30 mg/1950 mg/day for subjects whose MED at 
screening was ≥80 mg/day). Whenever subjects take rescue medication, they must record their pain 
intensity “at that moment” prior to taking rescue medication in the electronic diary. A Final Study Visit will take place 1 week after the last CAM2038/placebo q1w dose or 4 weeks after the last CAM2038/placebo q4w dose.  
 
At the Final Study Visit (or early termination), subjects will be transitioned back to standard care or to 
their treatment prior to study entry. Subjects will then be contacted at Follow-up, within 4 weeks after 
the Final Study Visit,  to assess adverse events (AE)  and concomitant medications.  
 
Open Label Safety Extension  
Subjects who complete the Double -Blind Treatment Study Phase will be offered  an opportunity to 
continue treatment in an open label safety extension for up to 60 weeks. Enrollment in the open label 
safety extension will continue until a sufficient number of subjects have been recruited to obtain at least 
52 weeks of safety informat ion in approximately 100 subjects. Subjects who sign the informed consent 
for the safety extension will not be required to participate in the post -Double- Blind follow -up period 
and may proceed directly into the safety extension phase.  
 
Once the required n umber of subjects for the Double-Blind phase of the trial has been recruited , 
enrollment  for the Double -Blind phase will be closed,  and remaining subjects offered the opportunity 
to proceed directly to the long-term safety extension without having to participate in a double-blind 
treatment phase. However, to be eligible to proceed to the safety extension, subjects must meet the 
following criteria:  
• Have CAM2038 titrated to a dose that provides analgesia (i.e., 7- day mean API  ≤4) 
• The dose of CAM2038 is well-t olerated for 7 days before randomization (no adverse effects 
that require a change in study dosing or interruption)  
• Subject does not require, on average, more than one dose of rescue medication per day over the previous 7 days  
The opening of recruitment of subjects for the safety extension is to ensure that a sufficient number of subjects are enrolled to provide required long- term safety data to support the clinical development of 
CAM2038 for the indication of chronic pain requiring daily treatment with opi oids.  
 
These so called “de novo” subject s may have CLBP or other severe chronic pain disorders (such as 
osteoarthritis)  and will not be required to participate in the Double-Blind Phase. The de novo subjects 
will undergo the same screening procedures, down titration, morphine IR, and CAM2038 up- titration 
as required for subjects going through the Double-Blind phase of the study. The CAM2038 dosing 
titration and rescue medication requirements for the safety ex tension for subjects whose opioid doses 
at screening are ≥ 80 mg/day MED, and 40- 79 mg/day MED respectively shall be the same as 
described for the subjects participating in the Double-Blind Randomization phase.  
Pharmacokinetics: Subjects  in the safety extension will return to the study clinic for their regular 
weekly or monthly CAM2038 injections until the end of the study. Starting at the Month- 4 safety 
extension visit (Visit Week 23 for De Novo subjects and Visit Weeks 35 -36 for subject s transitioned

  from randomized Double -Blind Phase), PK sampling for CAM2038 steady state pharmacokinetics will 
be performed  on all subjects who provide additional consent for the pharmacokinetic sampling. PK 
sample can be done at any visit timepoint after the subject has stabilized  but no later than 4 week prior 
to EOT . Blood samples will be collected  prior to administration (within 45 minutes); and at 
approximately 2 hours, 6 hours, 24 hours, 72 hours, 168 hours, 336 hours, and 672 hours post 
administratio n to measure plasma levels of BPN and norbuprenorphine (norBPN) for subjects 
receiving both CAM2038 qlw  and CAM2038 q4w treatments. Actual dates and times of dosing of IMP 
during the safety extension phase as well as blood sampling for PK measurement will be recorded.  
Number of Subjects (Planned):  
Approximately 875 subjects will be screened in order to obtain approximately 340 randomized  subjects 
(170 subjects per treatment group) in the core study. The core study comprises two treatment arms: a 
group of approximately 170 subjects receiving SC CAM2038 q1w or CAM2038 q4w and a group of 
approximately 170 subjects receiving SC placebo q1w or q4w. Approximately 85 study sites in the 
United States will be utilized.  
 
Subjects who discontinue prematurely may be replaced at the discretion of the Medical Monitor and the Principal Investigator, in order to maintain study power.  Enrollment in the open label safety extension will continue until a sufficient number of subjects have been recruited to obtain at least 52 
weeks of exposure safety information in approximately 100 subjects.

• Subjects on BPN at Screening are required to participate in the down titration and will undergo 
a washout period prior to the test dose and first on- study treatment.   Subjects entering the study 
on BPN will not transition to IR Morphine, but will refrain f rom taking their BPN for 12 -24 
hours prior to the test dose to achieve the desired washout period.

1. Been on a stable dose of CAM2038 q1w for at least 2 consecutive weeks.  
2. CAM2038 titrated to a dose that provides analgesia (i.e., 7- day API score of ≤ 4 and at least 2 points 
below the value at the start of Titration  Phase)  and is well tolerated  for 7 days before  randomization. 
3. Requires no more than an average of one hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5 mg/325 mg/day during the 
last 7 days prior to randomization. 
 
Investigational Product, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:  
CAM2038 in the Titration Phase: 
CAM2038 6.25 mg/mL q1w (BPN FluidCrystal (FC) q1w SC injection depot) at a dose of 4 mg (0.64

mg, or 32 mg (0.16, 0.24, 0.32, 0.48, and 0.64 mL). 
 During the first week of the Titration Phase, subjects may receive one titration dose of 4 or 8 mg 
CAM2038 q1w on Day 1. During the first week of the Titration Phase, subjects who experience significant pain may, at the discretion of the investigator, receive a second dose of their CAM2038 on 
Day 3, 4, or 5 (4 mg CAM2038 q1w for subjects whose screening MED was 40 -79 mg/day; 8 mg 
CAM2038 q1w for subjects whose screening MED was ≥80 mg/day).  
 
CAM2038 in the Double-Blind Phase and Open Label Extension Phase: 
CAM2038 6.25 mg/mL q1w (BPN FC q1w SC injection depot) at a dose of 4 mg (0.64 mL). 
CAM2038 50 mg/mL q1w (BPN FC q1w SC injection depot) at doses of 8 mg, 12 mg, 16 mg, 24 mg, 
or 32 mg (0.16, 0.24, 0.32, 0.48, and 0.64 mL).  
CAM2038 356 mg/mL q4w (BPN FC q4w SC injection depot) at doses of 64 mg, 96 mg, or 128 mg 
(0.18, 0.27, or 0.36 mL). 
Subjects who are receiving either 4 mg, 8 mg, or 12 mg CAM2038 q1w at the end of the Titration Phase 
will be randomized to continue their respective CAM2038 q1w SC dosing (4 mg, 8 mg, or 12 mg), or to 
corresponding placebo q1w for a total treatment duration of 12 weeks (12 injections in the Double-Blind 
Phase). Subjects who are receiving 16 mg, 24 mg or 32 mg CAM2038 q1w SC at the end of the Titration 
Phase will be randomized to CAM2038 q4w (64 mg, 96 mg or 128 mg, respectively) or to 
corresponding placebo q4w for a total treatment duration of 12 weeks (3 injections in the Double-Blind Phase).  
Reference Therapy, Dosage and Mode of Administration:  
 
Placebo in the Double-Blind Phase: 
Subjects randomized to Group 1 who are on 4 mg, 8 mg, or 12 mg CAM2038 q1w aft er the Titration 
Phase will receive 12 weekly SC CAM2038 placebo injections with matching or near -matching 
volumes to CAM2038 (0.64 mL) or CAM2038 q1w (0.16, 0.24 mL).  Subjects randomized to Group 
2 who are on 16 mg, 24 mg, or 32 mg CAM2038 q1w after the Titration Phase will receive 3 
monthly SC CAM2038 placebo injections with matching or near-matching volumes to CAM2038

  q4w (0.18, 0.27,  or 0.36 mL).  
 
Buprenex Test Dose in the Titration Phase 
On Day 1 of the Titration Phase, subjects will receive a test dose consisting of an IM injection of 
Buprenex 0.30 mg (1.0 mL).  
Rescue Medication in the Titration and Double-Blind Phases and Open Label Extension Phase: 
Oral hydrocodone/acetaminophen, 5 mg/325 mg tablets, q4-6 h prn. The maximum daily dose is 15 
mg/975 mg/day (three tablets) for subjects whose screening MED was 40 -79 mg/day or 30 mg/1950 
mg/day (six tablets) for subjects whose screening MED was ≥ 80 mg/day. Subjects cannot take more than an average of one rescue tablet per day, in the week prior to randomization. 
Criteria for Evaluation: 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in WAAPI and the primary timepoint will be 
Week 12 of the  Double-Blind Phase.   
 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: 
The secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows:  
▪ Change from baseline in the WAWPI scores at Week 12 of the Double-Blind Phase, based on 
an NRS -11. 
▪ Percentage of subjects with a 30% or greater decrease in API from baseline to  Week 12 of the 
Double- Blind  Phase.  
▪ Rescue medication usage (number of days used and total dose) during the Double- Blind  Phase.

Impairment (WPAI)  score.  
▪ Time to loss of efficacy, defined as discontinuation of study drug for lack of efficacy.  
Safety Endpoints: 
• Occurrence of AEs throughout the study. 
• Concomitant medication usage throughout the study.  
Exploratory Endpoints: 
• Change from baseline to Week 12 of the Double -Blind Phase in Clinical Global Impression of 
Improvement (CGI -I) scale (as assessed by the Investigator).  
• Change from baseline to Week 12 of the Double-Blind Phase in Patient Global Impression of 
Improvement (PGI -I) scale (as assessed by the subject

  4. INTRODUCTION 
4.1. Background  
Opioids are recommended for the management of moderate to severe pain that cannot be well -controlled 
using non-opioid analgesics or other interventions ( American Academy of Pain Medicine, 2013; Chou et 
al, 2009). Buprenorphine (BPN) is an opioid with mixed agonist- antagonist properties that is currently 
available in injectable and buccal f ormulations to treat moderate to severe (acute) pain (e.g., Buprenex) and 
transdermal and buccal formulations to treat chronic pain (e.g., BuTrans®  and Belbuca™). 
CAM2038 (buprenorphine FluidCrystal [FC] subcutaneous [SC] injection depot) once weekly (q1w) and 
once monthly (q4w), hereafter referred to as CAM2038 q1w and CAM2038 q4w, respectively, are ready-
to-use, extended-release BPN products with a target of q1w or q4w SC dosing posology, respectively. 
CAM2038 q1w and CAM2038 q4w were developed using the proprietary lipid -based and ambient 
responsive FC Injection depot technology. The principle behind the FC Injection depot is a liquid- to-gel 
phase transition, occurring immediately as the lipid -based FC system is exposed to in vivo conditions of 
SC tissue.  The phase transition proceeds from the outside towards the center of the injected FC by 
absorption of minute quantities of water. Thus, injection of CAM2038 q1w or CAM2038 q4w into SC 
tissue results in an immediate and spontaneous formation of controlled BPN release matrix providing long-
acting release in vivo with a minimum initial burst release. The dual nature of the FC system (i.e., a true 
liquid drug product  in vitro before injection and stable gel in vivo after injection) enables a ready -to-use 
drug product in a prefilled syringe. 
CAM2038 q1w and q4w are designed for convenient and safe SC injection using a prefilled syringe 
including a needle safety device and with no need for mixing or temperature adjustment from ambient temperature prior to adminis tration. In addition, the injection volumes for CAM2038 q1w and q4w are 
relatively low (from 0.15 to 0.64 mL volume, depending on dose and product) and can be administered using a fine gauge needle (23 G). Overall, CAM2038 depots have been designed with a focus on enabling 
easy administration, dosing flexibility, and, importantly, minimizing risks of misuse, diversion, and poor 
patient compliance.
 
 
4.1.1.  CAM2038 q1w (Once Weekly)  
SC CAM2038 q1w has so far been investigated after single and repeated doses in 7 clinical trials in 
opioid-dependent subjects and healthy volunteers. An initial Phase 1/2 study assessed pharmacokinetics 
(PK), pharmacodynamics, and safety in opioid-dependent subjects (Study HS-07-307). The results 
showed that CAM2038 q1w was well tolerated, both locally and systemically. Importantly, no treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed and drug- related local tolerability findings were 
limited to 4  of 42 subjects (9.5%). Three subjects  experienced mild injection site pain and 1 patient 
exhibited transient injection site inflammation (mild) and injection site pruritus (moderate).  
 
Two additional clinical Phase 1  studies were subsequently performed in  healthy volunteers (under 
naltrexone blockade) to assess the PK and bioavailability of single and repeat doses of CAM2038 q1w 
versus repeated doses of sublingual (SL) BPN (i.e., at steady state) and single dose of intravenous (IV) BPN (Studies HS -11-426 and HS-13- 487). These two studies demonstrated that after administration of 
the studied doses of CAM2038 q1w, the plasma concentrations corresponded to those obtained after administration of SL BPN at approved doses (i.e., 8 mg, 16 mg, or 24 mg doses). The BPN levels after 
administration of CAM2038 q1w were furthermore similar in healthy volunteers and subjects with opioid 
dependence. The systemic tolerability of CAM2038 q1w was good in both studies and similar to the reference products, IV and SL BPN. Local tolerability was very good with no adverse events (AEs)

  reported in  Study HS-11-426 (N safety =60) related to injection site tolerability. Similarly, local 
tolerability of CAM2038 q1w was also very good in Study HS-13-487, featuring 4 repeat injections of 
CAM2038 q1w into the buttock site (1 subject reported 1 AE of injection site pain). 
Based on these studies, the following main conclusions were drawn regarding the clinical properties of 
CAM2038 q1w: 
▪ Extended BPN release over one week  
▪ Dose proportionality and flexible/multiple dosing  options  
▪ Six- to 8-fold higher bioavailability versus SL BPN 
▪ BPN plasma concentrations over 7 days within ranges of those produced by corresponding SL BPN doses at steady state (i.e., approved 8 mg, 16 mg or 24 mg doses)  
▪ Less peak/trough fluctuation compared to SL  BPN 
▪ Repeated -dose administration suggest time -independent PK 
▪ Good safety and systemic tolerability in subjects  
▪ Safety in healthy volunteers comparable to IV and SL BPN treatments  
▪ Good local tolerability in subjects  and healthy volunteers  
 
The clinical PK profile and good systemic and local tolerability of CAM2038 q1w evidenced in subjects 
in these 3 studies is also supported by a large body of data generated in non- clinical PK and toxicology 
studies in th e dog, mini -pig, and rat of single and repeat SC doses of CAM2038 q1w, including repeat 
weekly doses of the FC vehicle formul ation for 6 months. SC  administration of CAM2038 q1w has been 
shown to be well tolerated both systemically and locally in the non- clinical studies. The treatment- related 
findings have been limited to clinical observations in agreement with, and considered related to, known pharmacological effects of the drug substance BPN, and to reversible, local inflammatory reactions at the 
SC site of injection. The latter findings were similar to the physiological response to a foreign body. The FC-related injection site findings appeared to be reversible and self -limiting, and only apparent at the 
immediate vicinity of test article deposition. In summary, non- clinical data have indicated no systemic 
toxicity associated with CAM2038 q1w or the FC injection depot vehicle. 
4.1.2.  CAM2038 q4w (Once Mon thly) 
SC CAM2038 q4w has been investigated in 5 studies, including one bridging clinical Phase 1 PK study in 
healthy volunteers versus repeat dose CAM2038 q1w (i.e., at steady state), repeat dose SL BPN (i.e., at 
steady state), and a single dose of IV BPN (Study HS-13-487). The following conclusions can be drawn 
regarding the clinical properties of CAM2038 q4w: 
▪ Extended BPN release over 4  weeks  
▪ Six- to 8-fold higher bioavailability versus SL BPN, comparable to CAM2038 q1w  
▪ BPN plasma concentrations over 4 weeks comparable to CAM2038 q1w over one week, and to SL BPN over 24 hours at steady state (i.e., for approved 8 mg, 16 mg, or 24 mg doses)  
▪ Predicted average concentration during a dosage interval at steady state (C ss,av ) and trough 
concentration during a dosage interval at steady state (C ss,trough ) values for CAM2038 q4w  similar to 
CAM2038 q1w  
▪ Safety profile comparable to IV and SL BPN treatments  
▪ Good local tolerability

  The most commonly reported drug-related AEs after CAM2038 q1w and CAM2038 q4w administration 
in Study HS-13-487 were nausea (63% of subjects), dizziness (54% of subjects), and vomiting (39% of 
subjects). The local tolerability was good, with 9 subjects experiencing 10 AEs that were assessed as related to CAM2038 q4w (injection site reactions, injection site pain, injection site induration, and 
application site bruise). Two SAEs were reported by 2 subjects after treatment with 192 mg CAM2038 
q4w. The first SAE was an event of withdrawal reaction and the second SAE was an event of dehydration due to nausea and vomiting. Both SAEs were assessed as related to CAM2038 q4w (withdrawal reaction 
was also assessed as related to the concomitant treatment with naltrexo ne) and the event of withdrawal 
reaction qualified for reporting as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction. There were no deaths or any other significant AEs, and most of the AEs were mild and transient. Analysis of clinical chemistry, 
hematology, and urinalysis parameters did not suggest any significant safety issues for CAM2038 q4w. 
The non-clinical assessment of CAM2038 q4w and the FC vehicle, supported by publicly available data 
for the drug substance BPN, and for the components of the vehicle, suggests safe use of CAM2038 q4w 
for the proposed clinical development. This conclusion is further supported by results from non- clinical 
and clinical studies of CAM2038 q1w, comprising the same active substance and functional lipid components.

Brochure. 
4.1.3.  Completed  CAM2038 Phase 2 and Phase 3 Studies  
There are four completed Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies of CAM2038, HS- 11-421, HS -13-478, HS -
15-549 and HS -14-499. Please refer to the I nvestigator ’s Brochure for more detailed investigative study

HS-11-421 (completed) 
This was  a randomized, double -blind, double -dummy, active- controlled, parallel group, multicenter study, 
designed to evaluate the non -inferiority of CAM2038 compared to an existing standard of care (SL 
BPN/ naloxone [ NX]) in initiation and maintenance treatment with  BPN in subjects with opioid use 
disorder. The study  involve d 4 phases: Screening, Phase 1 (weekly visits, for 12 w eeks), Phase 2 (monthly 
visits, for 3 months), and Follow-up. 
 
A total of 428 subjects were  randomized in the study, whereof 213 subjects wer e treated with CAM2038 
and 215 subjects with SL BPN/NX. The study has been completed with no significant unusual or 
unexpected safe ty signals or concerns reported.  
 
HS-15-549 (completed)  
This was  a Phase 2, open-label, partially randomized, 3- treatment gro up study designed to evaluate the 
steady state PK of BPN and norbuprenorphine ( norBPN ) following multiple weekly SC administrations of 
CAM2038 q1w at different injection sites (Group 1), following multiple monthly SC administrations of 
CAM2038 q4w (Group 2) in opioid-dependent subjects with a history of chronic non-cancer pain and 
following multiple monthly SC administrations of C AM2038 q4w (Group 3) in opioid- dependent subjects 
with a history of chronic non-cancer pain who were  currently taking 24 mg of SL BPN daily. The trial 
involved up to 4 phases: Screening, Treatment, Follow- up and Open Label Safety Extension. Approximately 55 subjects were to  be enrolled. The study has been completed  and there were  no unusual 
safety signals or concerns identified.

  This was  a Phase 2 multi -site, randomized, double -blind, repeat- dose Phase 2 study to evaluate the degree 
and duration of action of multiple doses of CAM2038 q1w in blocking the effe cts of a mu opioid receptor 
agonist (hydromorphone) in subjects with moderate or severe opioid use disorder. The study involved 4 
phases: Screening, Qualification, Treatment, and Follow-up. In the treatment Phase, subjects received one 
of the following treatments (based on a randomization in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by gender and blinded): 
Group A received CAM2038 q1w 24 mg SC injection (22 subjects) and Group B received CAM2038 q1w 32 mg SC injection (25 subjects). 
Each of the Hydromorphone Challenge Sessions in the Qualification Phase and Treatment Phase consisted 
of the injection of 3 doses of IM hydromorphone (0 mg [placebo], 6 mg and 18 mg) administered once 
daily over 3 consecutive days in randomized blinded order. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio 
to 1 of 6 treatment sequences according to two 3 × 3 William squares. 
 
HS-14-499 (completed)  
This was  a Phase 3, open- label, multicenter, 12 -month (48- week) safety study in subjects  with  opioid use 
disorder, consistent with standard practice for long- term safety studies . This safety study  utilize d 
CAM2038 q1w and CAM2038 q4w and had 3 phases: Screening, Treatment, and Follow -up. The trial is 
completed  and ended  when at least 100 subjects h ave been exposed to CAM2038 for 48 weeks.  There 
were no unusual safety signals or concerns  identified  in the study .  
4.2. Study  Rationale  
Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a significant cause of pain and disability costs worldwide ( Volinn et al, 
2009; Vos et al, 2012 ). While most subjects with CLBP show significant improvements within 3 months, a 
proportion of subjects  experience persistent pain (≥ 3 months) and may have limited quality of life and 
physical function ( Shekelle et al, 1995; Thomas et al, 1999). M anagement of CLBP may be achieved 
through several modalities, including opioid pharmacotherapy. Despite their proven efficacy, the use of 
opioids is often limited due to concerns regarding safety and tolerability and concerns pertaining to drug abuse and d iversion that may arise with long-term therapy for treatment of persistent pain. However, for 
many subjects with CLBP, opioid therapy may be the only effective treatment.  BPN  is an effective 
analgesic with a potency 25 to 50 times that of morphine ( Jasins ki et al, 1978 ; Cowan et al, 1977). Dose -
dependent analgesia has been observed with intramuscular ( IM) doses up to 10 mg. Respiratory depression 
is minimized due to the well- characterized ceiling effect at higher doses ( Hans and Robert, 2009 ). 
Clinically, there is also a less marked effect of BPN on gastrointestinal transit times, with a lower 
incidence of constipation relative to full mu -opioid receptor agonists ( Mercadente, 2009). In addition, the 
slow dissociation of BPN from receptors results in a long duration of effect and minimizes withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation ( Sittl et al, 2005 ). Transdermal BPN has proven effective in subjects with 
chronic cancer and  non- cancer pain, with a reduction in the need for additional oral analgesics and 
improved quality of life ( Mercadente, 2009; Dahan et al, 2005 ; and Griessinger et al, 2005).  
 
A number of treatment goals have been proposed for improved patient therapy, many of which are based 
on World Health Organization (WHO)  recommendations, including  providing a stable plasma drug 
concentration to ensure long lasting and effective pain relief, formulations that provide a long duration of 
action, and an improved quality of life. By using the transdermal formulation of BPN, the rate of drug 
delivery can be controlled and stable plasma concentrations achieved. However, transdermal BPN may 
still be subject to abuse and diversion, as the patches may be swallowed or the BPN may be extracted 
from the patches and injected or ingested, including improperly disp osed patches ( Tompkins et al, 2014 ; 
Belbuca™ Prescribing Information, October 2015). Transdermal systems may also be accidently ingested, particularly by children. Traditional opioid therapies intended for the treatment of chronic pain 
(e.g., modified or e xtended- release formulations of full µ -opioid receptor agonists such as morphine,

  oxycodone, hydrocodone, and hydromorphone) are even more subject to diversion and abuse, resulting in 
significant public health concerns (Sittl et al, 2005 and Likar et al, 2003 ). 
 
The sustained and stable BPN plasma concentration associated with administration of CAM2038 q1w and 
q4w may provide an ideal treatment modality for many CLBP subjects. The PK profile of CAM2038 q1w 
indicates that a rapid and long- acting release of B PN should lead to rapid and smooth onset of action, in 
combination with a prolonged and stable treatment effect for at least 7 days following a single dose of CAM2038 q1w or up to 4 weeks following a single dose of CAM2038 q4w. Thus, the PK profiles of 
CAM 2038 q1w may help to improve tolerability during initiation of treatment. Like transdermal 
formulations, CAM2038 may also be suitable for those subjects with difficulty swallowing.
 
The profiles of CAM2038 provide an alternative to existing oral opioid medi cations, with the potential 
added benefit of obtaining consistent and stable plasma levels of BPN. This profile removes the need to 
take daily medications and helps to prevent diversion and accidental pediatric exposures, which continue 
to be important public health goals of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Center for Disease 
Control and Prevention ( Frieden and Houry, 2016 ). Furthermore, the route of administration (i.e., depot 
injection) of CAM2038 may reduce the risks of diversion and abuse, eve n when compared to transdermal 
opioid formulations. 
While the efficacy of transdermal and transmucosal BPN in managing pain  and improving function has 
previously been demonstrated in subjects with CLBP ( Salinas et al, 2012; Rauck et al, 2016 ), the 
anesthet ic efficacy of BPN administered as CAM2038 q1w or CAM2038 q4w SC injections has not yet 
been evaluated. The present study will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CAM2038 
compared to placebo in subjects with moderate to severe CLBP over a period of 12 weeks during the 
Double-Blind Phase. In addition, the safety of CAM2038 will be evaluated from  the Open-Label Titration 
Phase and throughout the Open Label Safety Extension Phase. 
4.3. Dose  Rationale  
The 4 -mg weekly starting dose of CAM2038 q1w correspond to a daily morphine equivalent dose (MED) 
of 28.5 mg, using a more conservative conversion factor of 50 from BPN to morphine; thus, representing safe and suitable starting doses for subjects receiving  ≥30 mg of morphine daily. In this study, subjects 
will be titrated to effect. An indicative a priori transition from daily morphine dose to weekly CAM2038 doses and monthly CAM2038 dose is given in Table 1 and Table 2 below, respectively:

  4.3.1.  Rationale for repeat- site injections  
A 9-month study in beagle dogs has been  conducted to characterize the chronic systemic toxicity of 
CAM2038 q1w and CAM2038 q4w SC  administration in beagle dogs. Assessments included evaluation of 
local injection site tolerability and toxicokinetic evaluation at steady-state. Corresponding vehicle placebos 
and saline were used as controls. A total of 8 injection sites on the back were used. Injection sites were 
rotated as follows:  
• For the q1w: CAM2038 q1w (32 mg/injection), vehicle placebo and saline injections were 
administered once every week. The injection sites were rotated so that each site was re-used once 
every eighth week over the course of the study. 
• For the q4w: CAM2038 q4w (128, 160 or 192 mg/injection), vehicle placebo and saline. Injections 
were administered once every 4 weeks. The injection sites were rotated so that each site was used 
once, except for the last three -monthly  injections which were all administered at one  site. 
 
The beagle dogs toler ated 39 weekly SC  doses of CAM2038 q1w drug product at 32 mg/dose or the 
CAM2038 q1w placebo control, or 10 doses given once every 4-weeks of CAM2038 q4w drug products at 
128, 160, or 192 mg/dose or the CAM2038 q4w placebo control. The CAM2038 drug product s and 
placebo controls had no discernible effect on dermal irritation (erythema, or eschar), overall food 
consumption, ophthalmologic parameters, clinical pathology endpoints (hematology, coagulation, clinical 
chemistry, and urinalysis), or organ weights. 
 
Injection site reactions were limited to the presence of Grade 1 edema/swelling, which was considered to represent the injection depot matrix (IDM). Most animals given the BPN -containing CAM2038 drug 
product formulations or the corresponding placebo controls had Grade 1 (“very slight”) IDM at the sites of 
injection following dosing. There were no observed differences noted between the sites dosed with BPN-
containing CAM2038 drug products and placebo controls. 
 
Additionally, there was no apparent increase in the severity of IDM swelling with repeated injections at the 
same injection site. Discernable swelling associated with the IDM generally resolved between 60 and 144 days after dosing administration. 
 
This study demonstrated that repeat injectio ns could be safely performed at the same site every 4 weeks 
with the highest volumes and doses of CAM2038, without any associated deleterious effects.

  6. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
 
6.1. Overall Study Design and  Plan  
This is a Phase III, placebo -controlled, multicenter study with an enriched- enrollment withdrawal (EEW) 
design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CAM2038 in opioid- experienced subjects with moderate to 
severe CLBP that requires continuous, around- the-clock (ATC) opioid treatment ≥ 40 mg MED. An 
overview of the study design is provided in Figure 1 . The study includes 5 phases: A Screening Phase (up 
to 2 weeks), a Transition Phase (up to 2 weeks),  an Open Label Titration  Phase  (up to 10 weeks),  a Double-
Blind Treatment Phase including a Final Study Visit (12 weeks), and a Follow- up Phase (4 weeks)  The 
overall duration of participation of the core phase is up to 30 weeks, from the Screening Phase through the 
Follow- up Phase.  Subjects  who complete the Double-Blind Treatment Phase will be offered the 
opportunity to continue treatment in an Open L abel Safety E xtension Phase for up to 60 weeks.  In 
addition, so called “de novo” subjects may be enrolled in the Open Label Safety Extension Phase. These 
subjects may proceed directly from the Open Label Titration Phase to the Open Label Safety Extension Phase without participating in the Double- Blind Treatment Phase.  
Subjects will record their API at Screening and prior to the test dose on a paper diary at the site. Throughout the study, after subjects receive their first CAM2038 injection, they will record their WPI and 
API using the NRS-11 in an electronic diary. Subjects will be instructed to record their WPI and API once 
daily between 18:00 and 23:59 (i.e., 6:00 pm and 11:59 pm). Subjects will be instructed to make all attempts to record their pain scores at the same time of day throughout the study. In addition, subjects will 
be instructed to record their pain intensity in the electronic diary on the NRS- 11 “at that moment” prior to 
taking rescue medication. Rescue medication use will also be recorded in the electronic diary.  
Table 5, Table 6, and Table 7 provide additional information on the baseline, efficacy, and safety 
assessments included in the study. Efficacy endpoints and statistical analyses are described further in 
Section 9.6  and Section 11.3, respectively.  
 
6.1.1.  Transition Phase 
Following Screening and confirmation of eligibility, subjects will enter a Transition Phase of up to 2 weeks during which their current opioid dose will be down-titrated by approximately 25% per day to: 
• ≤80 mg/day MED (for subjects whose opioid dose  at screening i s > 80 mg MED)  
• or to ≤40 mg/day MED ( for subjects whose opioid dose at screening is between  40-79 mg/day 
MED).  
Following the down titration, subjects will be transitioned to an immediate -release (IR) morphine  for at 
least 2 days before they enter the Open-L abel Titration Phase, as follows:  
• 15 mg 4 times daily [QID] for subjects whose screening MED was ≥80 mg/day  
• 15 mg 3 times daily [ TID] for subjects whose screening MED was 40 -79 mg/day. 
 
Subjects who were previously on BPN prior to Screening will not need to participate in the morphine IR phase. However, subjects who were previously on BPN will be required to refrain from taking BPN for

  12-24 hours as a washout prior to starting open label titration on CAM2038.  
 
6.1.2.  Open  Label Titration Phase 
Following the morphine IR treatment, subjects will enter the Titration Phase.  On Day 1 of the Titration 
Phase, subjects will return to the clinic after a washout of at least a 12- hour from their last morphine IR 
dose, or 12-24 hou rs from their last BPN dose. Subjects who report a CLBP of ≥ 5 on the API scale and 
have a Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score of ≥5, will receive a BPN test dose (Buprenex  
0.30 mg IM injection) at the clinical site. After the Buprenex test dose, subjects will be assessed for any 
changes in QTcF (Fri derici a’s corrected QTc) and withdrawal. Subjects who tolerate the BPN test dose, do 
not show an increase >30 ms in QTcF within 1 hour after the test dose, and have a COWS score of < 5 
within 15 minutes after the test dose will receive the first dose of SC CAM203 8 q1w within 4 hours (+30 
minutes) after the test dose (4 mg CAM2038 for subjects whose screening MED was between 40 mg/day and 79 mg/day; and 8 mg CAM2038 for subjects whose screening MED was ≥80 mg/day).  
During the first week of the Titration Phase, subj ects who experience significant pain may, at the 
discretion of the investigator, receive an additional 4 mg (for subjects whose screening MED was 40-79 
mg/day) or 8 mg CAM2038 (for subjects whose screening MED was ≥80 mg/day), on Day 3, 4 or 5. Dose 
adjustments will be made by increasing or decreasing the dose level of CAM2038 q1w at the scheduled 
weekly visits (doses of 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg, 16 mg, 24 mg, or 32 mg per week). Subjects who require doses >32 mg/week will be discontinued from the study. 
Rescue me dication, consisting of hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5 mg/325 mg every 4 to 6 hours (q4-6h), 
may be taken as needed (prn) up to 15 mg/975 mg/day (three tablets) for subjects whose screening opioid 
dose was between 40 and 79 mg/day MED or 30 mg/1950 mg/day (si x tablets) for subjects whose 
screening opioid dose was ≥80 mg/day MED. The goal of the Titration Phase is to achieve a stable dose of 
CAM2038 q1w
 that produces analgesia,  by the end of the 10–week period.   
Eligible subjects will receive CAM2038 titrated to a dose that meets the following criteria  (see also 
Section 7.4): 
• Provides analgesia (i.e., 7- day mean API  ≤4) 
• The API is at least 2 points below the value at the start of  CAM2038 titration  
• The dose of CAM2038 i s well-tolerated for 7 days before  randomization (no adverse effects that 
require a change in study dosing or interruption) 
• Subject does not require, on average, more than one dose of rescue medication per day over the 7 
days before randomization 
 
6.1.3.  Double -Blind Phase  
Subjects who are stabilized and responding to their CAM2038 q1w dose (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, or 32 mg/week) 
at the end of the Titration Phase and who fulfill the pre-defined randomization criteria will be randomized to one of two treatment groups in the 12- week  Double-Blind Phase: 
▪ Group 1: CAM2038 q1w or CAM2038 q4w SC injections  
▪ Group 2: placebo q1w or placebo q4w SC injections

  During the Double -Blind Phase, all subjects who are receiving 4, 8 or 12 mg CAM2038 q1w at the end of 
the Titration Phase will be randomized to continue their respective CAM2038 q1w dosing of 4 mg, 8 mg 
or 12 mg CAM2038, or to matching placebo q1w for a total treatment duration of 12 weeks. Subjects who 
are receiving 16 mg, 24 mg or 32 mg CAM2038 q1w at the end of the Titration Phase will be randomized 
to CAM2038 q4w (64 mg, 96 mg or 128 mg, respectively) or to matching  placebo q4w for a total 
treatment duration of 12 weeks.

1One booster is allowed on Day 3 -5 after the first CAM2038, 4 or 8 mg injection. If booster is taken, the next dose on week 2 will 
be 8 or 12 mg, otherwise stay at 8 mg. Then titration is weekly up to 10 weeks. Final Study Visit is 1 week after the last CA M2038 
q1w dose for q1w subjects and 4 weeks after the last q4w dose for q4w subjects. Follow -up is within 4 weeks after the Final study 
visit.  
IR = immediate release; MED=morphine equivalent dose; q1w=once weekly; q4w=once monthly; R= randomization. There will 
be a Final Study Visit or Early Termination and one Follow -up Call. 
 
Rescue medication, hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5 mg/325 mg q4-6h prn, will be allowed during the 
Double- Blind Phase (up to three tablets or 15 mg/975 mg/day for subjects whose MED at screening was 
between 40-79 mg/day and up to six tablets or 30 mg/1950 mg/day for subjects whose MED at screening 
was ≥80 mg/day). Whenever subjects take rescue medication, they must record their pain intensity “at that 
moment” prior to taking rescue medication in the electronic diary.  
 
6.1.4.  Follow- up Phase  for Subjects Not Transitioning to the Open Label Safety Extension 
Phase  
A Final Study Visit will take place 1 week after the last CAM2038/placebo q1w dose or 4 weeks after the 
last CAM2038/placebo q4w dose. At the Final Study Visit (or early termination), subjects will be transitioned back to standard care or to their treatment prior to study entry. Subjects will then be contacted

  at Follow -up, within 4 weeks after the Final Study Visit, to assess AEs and concomitant medications. 
 
Subjects transitioning  from the Randomized Double-Blind Phase to the Open La bel Safety Extension 
Phase are encouraged to d o so at the Final Study Visit of the randomized Double-Blind Phase or as soon as 
possible thereafter.  
 
6.1.5.  Open  Label Safety Extension  
Subjects who complete the Double-Blind Phase will be offered the opportunity to continue treatment in an 
open label safety e xtension for  a total duration of  up to 60 weeks. Subjects who consent to the Open Label 
Extension will not be required to participate in the post-double-blind Follow -up Phase but will be 
transitioned at their Final Study Visit or as soon as possible thereafter, to open label active treatment, in the Open Label Extension. With the  Open L abel S afety E xtension Phase , total duration of exposure to 
CAM2038 is up to 60 weeks. Enrollment in the Open L abel S afety E xtension Phase will continue until a 
sufficient number of subjects have been recruited to obtain at least 52 weeks of safety information in 
approximately 100 subjects . Due to the double -blind design, all subje cts will need to receive at least 1 
week of CAM2038 q1w before proceeding to the Open Label Safety Extension Phase.  
 Subjects completing the Double -Blind Phase on 4 mg, 8 mg or 12 mg CAM2038/placebo q1w will 
continue on the same  dose of active treatment (open-label CAM2038) without need for titration. Subjects 
completing the Double -Blind Phase on 64 mg, 96 mg or 128mg CAM2038/placebo q4w will begin open-
label treatment at the corresponding equivalent weekly dose last received by the subject prior to transition 
to the monthly dosing regimen. The subject may transition to monthly dosing upon return to the clinic in 1 
week following the initial dose. At the Investigator’s discretion, the transition period may be extended or the patient down- titrated, in case of poor tolerability. The subjects will continue in the O pen L abel S afety 
Extension Phase until the total exposure to CAM2038 (including the Titration and Double- Blind Phases) is 
at least  52 weeks.  
 
Once the required number of subjects for the Double-Blind phase of the trial has been recruited , 
enrollment  for the Double -Blind phase will be closed,  and remaining subjects offered the opportunity to 
proceed directly to the long- term safety extension with out having to participate in a double- blind treatment 
phase. However, to be eligible to proceed to the safety extension, subjects must meet the following 
criteria:  
• Have CAM2038 titrated to a dose that provides analgesia (i.e., 7- day mean API  ≤4) 
• The dose of CAM2038 is well- tolerated for 7 days before randomization (no adverse effects that 
require a change in study dosing or interruption) 
• Subject does not require, on average, more than one dose of rescue medication per day over the 
previous 7 days  
The opening of recruitment of subjects for the safety extension is to ensure that a sufficient number of subjects are enrolled to provide required long- term safety data to support the clinical development of 
CAM2038 for the indication of chronic pain requiring daily treatment with opioids.  
 
These so called “de novo” subject s may have CLBP or other severe chronic pain disorders (such as 
osteoarthritis)  and will not be required to participate in the Double-Blind Phase. The de novo subjects will 
undergo the same screeni ng procedures, down titration, morphine IR and CAM2038 up- titration as 
required for subjects going through the Double- Blind  Phase of the study. The CAM2038 dosing titration 
and rescue medication requirements for the safety extension for subjects whose opio id doses at screening

  are > 80 mg/day MED, and 40-79 mg/day MED , respectively , shall be the same as described for the 
subjects participating in the Double-Blind P hase.  De novo subjects may also be subjects who have 
completed the core  study more than 28 days ago or newly identified subjects with a chronic pain indication 
treated with daily opioids. 
 
Subjects in the Open Label S afety Extension Phase will return to the stud y clinic for their regular weekly 
or monthly CAM2038 injections until the end of the study. At the Month- 4 safety extension visit  (Visit 
Week 23 for de novo subjects and Visit Weeks 35-36 for subjects transitioned from randomized Double-
Blind Phase) , PK sa mpling for CAM2038 steady state PK will be performed on all subjects who provide 
additional consent for the PK  sampling. Blood samples will be collected prior to administration (within 
45 minutes); and at approximately 2 hours, 6 hours, 24 hours, 72 hours, 168 hours, 336 hours, and 672 
hours after administration to measure plasma levels of BPN and norBPN for subjects receiving both 
CAM2038 qlw  and CAM2038 q4w treatments. Actual dates and times of dosing of IMP during the safety 
extension phase, as well as , blood sampling for PK measurement will be recorded.

6.2. Discussion of Study  Design  
Chronic pain may result from a number of different conditions with different underlying etiologies; 
however, to increase sensitivity of the study, eligible subjects will be subjects with moderate to severe 
CLBP who require ATC opioid treatment. The design selected to meet the objectives of the study is a 12-
week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, EEW study in subjects with moderate to severe 
CLBP that requires continuous, ATC opioid treatment and, despite prior dose escalation, did not receive 
adequate pain relief.  
The overall design is consistent with previous studies of modified- release opioid analgesics, Initiative on 
Methods, Mea surement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) recommendations (Weaver 
and Schnoll, 2002 ; Yarlas et al, 2013 and Dworkin et al, 2005 ), and the FDA Guidance for Industry – 
Analgesic Indications: Developing Drug and Biological Products ( 2014) ( Dworkin et al, 2008 ). The 
Double-Blind Phase will be 12 weeks in duration, which is consistent with FDA guidance and previous studies demonstrating efficacy of opioid formulations. The frequency of visits is considered to be 
adequate for dosing, monitoring s ubject’s compliance with study requirements, and not overly 
burdensome for subjects.  
1One booster is allowed at the discretion of the investigator, on Day 3 -5 after the first 4 or 8 mg injection CAM2038 for subjects experiencing 
significant pain. Then titration is weekly up to 10 weeks.  Follow up is within 4 weeks after the Open Label Treatment Phase.  Up to 50  weeks

  CAM2038 is being evaluated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, ATC, long- term 
opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inade quate. Two dosage formulations are 
being studied (4 mg, 8 mg and 12 mg q1w) and (16 mg, 24 mg and 32 mg q4w). 
The study will utilize an EEW approach as an enrichment strategy to enhance the probability of including 
“responders” and to minimize early discontinuations due to AEs ( Dworkin et al, 2012 and FDA CDER, 
2014). According to FDA guidance ( 2014 ), an enrichment design may be particularly well suited for 
demonstrating efficacy of alternative dosage forms of an established analgesic. In addition, accordin g to 
FDA guidance, the titrate- to-effect design may improve subject retention and provide a more realistic 
picture of efficacy and safety ( Dworkin et al, 2012 ). The use of fixed opioid doses may permit a more 
rigorous assessment of dose -response, but the l imited number of doses may reduce success of the trial, as 
they are not optimized to meet the subjects’ needs.  
During the Titration Phase, subjects will be dosed with CAM2038 q1w until a stabilized dose and adequate analgesic effect has been achieved for at least 2 consecutive weeks prior to randomization to the Double-Blind Phase, in accordance with pre-defined randomization criteria. Subjects whose pain is 
controlled on 4 mg, 8 mg or 12 mg CAM2038 q1w during the Titration Phase, will be maintained on 4 mg, 8 or 12 mg CAM2038 q1w, or corresponding placebo during the Double- Blind Phase. Subjects 
whose pain is controlled on 16 mg CAM2038 q1w or higher during the Titration Phase will be transitioned to CAM2038 q4w/placebo during the Double- Blind  Phase.  
Although there are inherent differences in the PK profiles for weekly and monthly administered products, the CAM2038 q1w and q4w formulations are similar with respect to steady state maximum plasma 
concentration and trough plasma concentration of BPN. Based on t hese similarities, the CAM2038 
products are expected to be interchangeable when subjects go from weekly to monthly dosing regimens. 
Rescue medication, hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5 mg/325 mg, will be provided to help minimize opioid 
withdrawal symptoms in su bjects during the Titration Phase and the Double- Blind Phase (particularly in 
subjects randomized to placebo). Randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects 
to treatment, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown subject at tributes (e.g., demographics 
and baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of 
statistical comparisons across treatment groups.  
A placebo control will be used to establish the frequency and magnitude of changes in clinical endpoints that may occur in the absence of active treatment, as w ell as to minimize subject and investigator bias. 
Double-blinded treatment in the Double- Blind Phase will be used to reduce potential bias  of subjects and 
investigators during data collection and evaluation of clinical endpoints. 
During the Double -Blind Phase, the pharmacist will be unblinded to the randomization code to permit 
dispensation of the CAM2038 or placebo q1w and CAM2038 or placebo q4w syringes to an unblinded 
staff member who will perform the injections. All other site study personnel, including the investigator and 
study coordinator, as well as the subjects, will remain blinded to treatment during the Double-Blind Phase of the study. The unblinded s taff member will be instructed not to discuss the trial with the blinded staff to 
ensure the blind is maintained.  
The opening of recruitment of subjects for the safety extension is to ensure that a sufficient number of 
subjects are enrolled to provide required long- term safety data to support the clinical development of 
CAM2038 for the indication of chronic pain requiring daily treatment with opioids.

Note:  
• Subjects on BPN at Screening are required to participate in the down titration and will undergo a 
washout period prior to the test dose and first on- study treatment.   Subjects entering the study on 
BPN will not transition to IR Morphine, but will refrain from taking their BPN for 12 -24 hours 
prior to the test dose to achieve the desired washout period.       
• Subjects on BPN at Screening are still required to follow the same Day 1  procedures (e.g., 
confirmation of pain scores, COWS assessment and Buprenex test dose) as non -BPN subjects.  
7.4. Criteria for Randomization into the Double -Blind  Phase  
For randomization into the Double -Blind Phase, subjects must meet the following criteria at the 
completion of the Open Label Titration Phase:

• Subjects on BPN at Screening are required to participate in the down titration and will undergo a 
washout period prior to the test dose and first on- study treatment.   Subjects entering the study on 
BPN will not transition to IR Morphine, but will refrain from taking their BPN for 12 -24 hours 
prior to the test dose to achieve the desired washout period.       
• Subjects on BPN at Screening are still required to follow the same Day 1  procedures (e.g., 
confirmation of pain scores, COWS assessment and Buprenex test dose) as non -BPN subjects.  
  
7.6.4. Criteria for Enrol lment  into the O pen Label Treatment Phase (for De Novo 
subjects)  
1. Been on a stable dose of CAM2038 q1w for at least 2 consecutive weeks.  
2. CAM2038 titrated to a dose that provides ana lgesia (i.e., 7- day API score of ≤ 4 and at least 2 points 
below the value at the start of Titration  Phase)  and is well tolerated  for 7 days before  randomization. 
3. Requires no more than an average of one hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5 mg/325 mg/day during the 
last 7 days prior to randomization. 
  
7.7. Removal of Subjects from Therapy or  Assessment  
A subject is free to withdraw his/her consent and discontinue participation in the study at  any time for any 
reason. A subject’s participation must therefore be termin ated immediately upon his/her request, and the 
reason(s) for discontinuation appropriately documented.  
A subject must be discontinued from the study, including the Titration, Double-Blind Phases, and Open -
Label Safety Extension Phase, for any of the following reasons:  
▪ Safety reasons, including AEs or significant concomitant illness, injury or urgent surgeries/procedures 
that would, in the judgment  of the investigator, affect  assessments of clinical status to a significant 
extent, require discontinuati on of study drug, or both 
o Every attempt should be made to collect samples for a urine toxicology test and BPN blood 
concentration if a subject experiences a  SAE or is discontinued fr om the study due to an AE. 
The i nvestigator will remain blinded to the results until the study blind is broken.

  ▪ At the request of the Sponsor, regulatory agency, or Institutional Review Board (IRB)  
▪ Subject is lost to  follow-up 
▪ Subject treatment allocation is  unblinded  
▪ Death of  subject  
A subject may also be discontinued from the study, at the discretion of the i nvestigator and/or Sponsor, for 
any of the following reasons:  
▪ Lack of  efficacy  
▪ Subject refuses or is unable to adhere to the study protocol visits and procedure  
▪ Major protocol  violation  
▪ Pregnancy  
▪ Use of unacceptable concomitant medication(s)  
▪ It is not considered in the best interest of the subject to  continue  
▪ Administrative reasons (e.g., termination of enrollment or  study)  
The i nvestigator must maintain a record of all subjects who discontinue from the study prior to completion. 
The reason(s) for study discontinuation will be documented. In the event that a subject chooses to 
withdraw from the study, the Investigator should make a reasonable attempt to obtain and record the 
reason(s)  for withdrawal in as much detail as possible, although the subject is not obligated to provide such 
reason(s).  
In the event that a subject is discontinued while at the clinical site, the early termination procedures shown in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 6  , Table 7, Table 8, and Table 10) should be performed prior to 
discharge from the clinical site. For any case of early discontinuation, whether or not the subjec t is at the 
clinical site, the i nvestigator should ask the subject to return for the early termination procedures, provided 
that the subject has not withdrawn consent for those procedures. If the subject has not withdrawn consent for procedures , the sponsor can hire a  third -party vendor to locate the subject so that the early termination 
procedures can be performed. If subject refuses to complete early termination procedures, this information will be recorded.

8. TREATMENTS 
 
8.1. Treatment Administration  
 
8.1.1. Transition Phase ( after Screening to test dose/Day  1) 
 
Following Screening and confirmation of eligibility, subjects will enter a Transition Phase of up to 2 
weeks during which their current opioid dose will be down-titrated by approximately 25% per day to ≤ 80 
mg/day MED for subject whose screening MED was ≥80 mg/day; or to  ≤40 mg/day MED for subject 
whose screening MED was between 40 mg and 79 mg/day. With exception to subjects down- titrating their 
BPN dosing, s ubjects will be transitioned to an IR morphine (15 mg QID or 15 mg TID, respectively) for 
at least 2 days before they enter the Open Label Titration Phase. Following the morphine IR treatment, 
subjects will enter the Titration Phase. Subjects who were previously on BPN prior to Screening will not 
need to participate in the morphine-IR phase, but will refrain from taking BPN for 12-24 hours as a washout phase.
 
 
8.1.2. Test Dose (Day 1 of Titration)  
Subjects are required to refrain from their previous IR morphine treatment for at least 12 hours in order to receive the Buprenex test dos e at the clinical site (i.e., Day 1 of the Titration Phase).  Subjects will be 
required to have an API score over the previous 24 hours ≥ 5, recorded on a paper diary and a COWS 
score ≥  5 in order to receive the test dose of Buprenex. The COWS assessment ca n be performed up to 48 
hours after the initial COWS assessment. At that time, subjects will receive an IM injection of 0.30 mg (1.0 mL) Buprenex and will be assessed for any changes in QTcF or withdrawal. ECG s will be taken 15 
minutes before and 15 minute s and 1 hour after the test dose. COWS will be assessed at 15 minutes after 
the test dose.  
 
8.1.3. Titration  Phase  
After administration of the Buprenex test dose on Day 1, subjects who tolerate the test dose, do not show an increase of > 30 ms in QTcF within 1 hour, and have a COWS score of < 5 within  15 minutes after the 
test dose will receive their first dose of CAM2038 q1w within 4 hours (+ 30 minutes) after the test dose. Subjects whose screening opioid dose was between 40 mg and 79 mg/day MED will be started on 4 mg CAM2038 q1w. Subjects whose screening opioid dose was ≥80 mg/day MED will be started on 8 mg 
CAM2038 q1w. During the first week of the Titration Phase, subjects who experience significant pain 
may, at the discretion of the investigator  receive a second  dose of CAM2038 at their respective dose (4 mg 
for subjects whose screening MED was 40 -79 mg/day; 4 or 8 mg CAM2038 q1w for subjects whose 
screening Med was ≥80 mg/day) on D ay 3, 4, or 5. Subjects will then attend clinic visits every week for 
dosage a djustment. Dose adjustments will be made by increasing or decreasing the dose level of 
CAM2038 q1w at the scheduled weekly visits (doses of 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg, 16 mg, 24 mg, or 32 mg per week).  
 
The maximum dose within a 7-day period cannot exceed 32 mg.  Subjects who require doses higher than 32 mg/week will be discontinued from the study. The dosing of CAM2038 q1w will be titrated with the purpose of achieving a stable dose of CAM2038 q1w by the end of the  10-week Titration Phase.

  8.1.4. Double -Blind  Phase  
Subjects who are receiving 4, 8 or 12 mg CAM2038 q1w at the end of the Titration Phase will be 
randomized to continue their respective 4 mg, 8 mg or 12 mg CAM2038 q1w dosing, or to corresponding  
placebo q1w for a total treatment duration of 12 weeks (12 injections in the Double-Blind Phase). Subjects 
who are receiving 16 mg, 24 mg or 32 mg CAM2038 q1w at the end of the Titration Phase will be 
randomized to CAM2038 q4w (64 mg, 96 mg or 128 mg, respecti vely) or to corresponding placebo q4w 
for a total treatment duration of 12 weeks (3 injections in the Double-Blind Phase). 
The dose conversions between CAM2038 q1w and CAM2038 q4w are shown below. 
▪ 4 mg CAM2038 q1w = 4 mg CAM2038 q1w or placebo q1w  
▪ 8 mg CAM2038 q1w = 8 mg CAM2038 q1w or placebo q1w  
▪ 12 mg CAM2038 q1w = 12 mg CAM2038 q1w or placebo q1w  
▪ 16 mg CAM2038 q1w = 64 mg CAM2038 q4w or placebo q4w  
▪ 24 mg CAM2038 q1w = 96 mg CAM2038 q4w or placebo q4w  
▪ 32 mg CAM2038 q1w = 128 mg CAM2038 q4w or placebo q4w  
 
 
CAM2038/placebo q1w must not be administered into a previously injected site for at least 4 weeks. 
CAM2038/placebo q4w must not be administered in a site previously injected with CAM2038/placebo 
q4w or with CAM2038/placebo q1w. 
During the entire Double -Blind Phase, subjects will be instructed to record their pain intensity  ratings 
before taking rescue medication. Rescue medication will consist of hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5 mg/325 mg tablets, q4-6h prn, not to exceed a total of 6 tablets or a total dosage of hydrocodone/acetaminophen 30 
mg/1950 mg/day for subjects whose screening opioid dose was ≥80 mg/day. For subjects whose screening opioid dose was between 40 and 79 mg/day MED, the maximum allowable rescue medication will be 15 
mg/975 mg/day (three tablets). This dosage limit will provide analgesic rescue medication at a maximum 
dose to prevent liver toxicity. 
In addition, at any time during the Double-Blind Phase, if the subject requires rescue medication above the 
maximum allo wable (hydrocodone/acetaminophen 30 mg/1950 mg/day (six tablets) for subjects whose 
screening MED was ≥80 mg/day; or 15mg/975 mg/day (three tablets) for subjects whose screening MED was between 40 and 79 mg/day), the subject should be asked if they want to continue with the maximum 
dose of rescue medication or would like to withdraw from the study. If circumstances surrounding 
discontinuation or withdrawal are unclear, the Medical Monitor should be consulted. If the subject decides 
to withdraw, the subject should have a final on- treatment visit and then have procedures and assessments 
completed for any remaining study visits, as specified in the protocol.  
Telephone or other contacts made by the site are allowed throughout the course of the study. Subjects 
should return to the study center according to the schedule specified in this protocol. 
One week after the last dose of CAM2038/placebo q1w or 4 weeks after the last dose of 
CAM2038/placebo q4w, the subjects will attend a Final Study Visit. At the Final Study Visit (or early 
termination), subjects will be transitioned back to standard care or their treatment prior to study entry. 
Within 4 weeks after the Final Study Visit, subjects will be contacted by phone to assess AEs and review 
concomitant med ications .

  8.1.5. Subjects Randomized to Placebo in the Double -Blind  Phase  
At the start of the Double-Blind Phase , approximately half of the subjects (170) will be randomized to 
placebo. These subjects may experience increases in their pain scores and require rescue medication. Sites 
are encouraged to keep these subjects in the study as long as possible.  However, subjects may withdraw 
consent for participation at any time and for any reason. Subjects who discontinue prematurely may be replaced at the discretion of the Med ical Monitor and the Principal i nvestigator, in order to maintain study 
power. 
 
8.1.6. Rescue Medications  
Hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5 mg/325 mg will be used as a rescue medication throughout the study. 
Rescue medication will be allowed prn duri ng the Open  Label Titration Phase and the Double- Blind Phase 
up to 30 mg/1950 mg/day of hydrocodone (5 mg)/acetaminophen (325 mg). However, the subject may not use, on average, more than one dose of rescue medication per day over the 7 days before randomiz ation. 
Throughout the study, subjects will be instructed to record their pain intensity “at that moment” on the 
electronic diary prior to taking rescue medication.  
8.1.7. Open Label Safety Extension 
Once the required number of subjects for the D ouble- Blind  phase of the trial has been recruited 
(approximately 340) , enrollment for the D ouble- Blind  Phase will be closed and remaining subjects with 
CLBP will be  offered the opportunity to proceed directly to the Open Label S afety E xtension Phase 
without having to participate in the Double-Blind P hase. However, to be eligible to proceed to the  Open  
Label Safety E xtension  Phase , subjects must meet the following criteria:  
• The analgesic dose of CAM2038 is well- tolerated for 7 days before entry into open label study (no 
adverse effects that require a change in study dosing or interruption) 
The opening of recruitment for subjects with CLBP  for the safety extension only  after enrol lment for the  
randomized Double-Blind Phase of the study is complete, is to ensure that eligible subjects with CLBP  are 
enrolled into the pivotal randomized Double-blind phase first. However, other subjects with chronic pain 
requiring daily treatment with opioids , who do not qualify for the randomized Double-Blind P hase of the 
study but are eligibl e for the safety extension phase may be enrolled directly into the safety extension 
phase (so called de novo subjects). These subjects will not be required to wait for recruitment for the 
randomized Double -Blind P hase to be completed prior to enrolling into the safety extension. The purpose 
of the safety extension is to ensure that sufficient data is obtained, to provide at least 52 weeks of exposure 
safety infor mation in at least 100 subjects.  These long long- term safety data  are required to support the 
clinical development of CAM2038 for the indication of chronic pain requiring daily treatment with 
opioids. 
 De novo s ubjects proceeding directly to the open label extension, will undergo the same screening 
procedures, down titration, morphine IR , Buprenex test dose, and CAM2038 up- titration similar  to the 
requirement  for subjects enrolling into  the randomized Double-B lind Phase of the study. The CAM2038 
dosing titration and rescue medication requirements for the safety extension for subjects whose opioid 
doses at screening are > 80 mg/day  MED, and 40-79 mg/day MED , respectively , shall be the same as 
described for the subjects participating in the Double-Blind P hase.  
 Subjects in the safety extension will return to the st udy clinic for their regular weekly or monthly 
CAM2038 injections until the end of the study.

  Starting at the fourth monthly safety extension visit, PK sampling for CAM2038 steady state PK  will 
be performed in subjects who have provided additional consent for the PK  sampling. PK sample can 
be done at any visit timepoint after the subject has stabilized but no later than 4 week prior to EOT 
visit.  Effort will be made to ensure that a sufficient number of subjects are included to cover the range 
of CAM2038 doses in the safety extension phase. 
Blood samples will be collected prior to administration (within 45 minutes); and at approximately 2 hours, 6 hours, 24 hours, 72 hours, 168 hours, 336 hours, and 672 hours to measure plasma levels of 
BPN and norBPN for subjects receiving both CAM2038 qlw and CAM2038 q4w treatments. Actual 
dates and times of dosing of IMP during the safety extension phase as well as blood sampling for PK 
measurement will be recorded. 
 
8.1.7.1. Dosing Schedule  
 
The dose titration schedule below provides guidance regarding titration of subject dosing upon enrollment into the open label extension portion of the study following participation in the double -blind 
randomization.     
• All sub jects will be started on the weekly CAM2038 regimen during the open label extension.  
• Subjects completing the randomized double -blind phase on 4 mg, 8 mg, or 12mg 
CAM2038/placebo q1w will continue the same dose of active treatment (open label CAM2038) 
without need for titration.  
• Subjects completing the randomized double -blind phase on 64 mg, 96mg, or 128mg 
CAM2038/placebo q4w will begin open label treatment at the corresponding equivalent weekly dose last received by the subject prior to transition to the monthly dosing regimen. T he subject 
may transition to monthly dosing upon return to the clinic in 1 week following the initial dose. At 
the investigator’s discretion, the transition period may be extended or the patient down- titrated, in 
case of poor tolerability.   
• Additional det ails are presented in

  8.2.5. Handling, Storage, and Accountability  
All study drugs will be transported, received, stored, and handled strictly in accordance with the container 
or product label, the instructions provided to the research site and applicable regulations. 
The CAM2038 drug products, IR morphine, Buprenex, and hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5 mg/325 mg as 
rescue medication should be stored in a secured area at room temperature (59° to 77° F or 15° to 25° C) and 
in accordance with the product labeling and all applicable laws, regulations and local/institutional 
requirements.  
 Detailed drug accountability records m ust be maintained, including the dates shipments are received, the 
quantity of material received, the dates dispensed and the running inventory. The unused quantities will be 
returned to the Sponsor’s drug supply vendor at the end of the trial. All unused supplies will be checked 
against the drug accountability records during the study and/or at the end of the study. Subjects will be 
instructed to return all unused study drugs to the clinical site. The i nvestigator  or designee must maintain an 
inventory rec ord of all rescue medications dispensed to subjects.  
Mishandling, potential theft, significant loss of clinical supplies at the site, or other suspected diversion must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of first knowledge of the issue. If diversion is confirmed or suspected (e.g., excessive use of rescue medications), the study staff will be required to complete a clinical 
supply product complaint form, including documenting if a subject sold drug or gave drug to a friend or 
relative, if there was a discrepancy in drug accountability and suspected diversion, if a subject had drug stolen, or if there was diversion or theft by site staff or others.  
BPN (Schedule III), morphine sulfate (Schedule II), and hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5 mg/325 mg (Schedule 
II) are controlled substances and must be handled and stored strictly in accordance with restrictions related to controlled substances. Study drugs must be  kept securely locked with access limited to appropriate study 
personnel, according to applicable regulations.  
 
8.2.6. Dispensing and Administration  
Only eligible subjects participating in the study will receive the study drug. Only authorized research site 
staff may supply or administer the study drugs. Once dispensed, study drug may not be relabeled or 
reassigned for use by other subjects.  
During the Double -Blind Phase, the pharmacist will be unblinded to the randomization code to permit 
dispensation of the CAM2038/placebo q1w and CAM2038/placebo q4w syringes to an unblinded staff 
member who will perform the injections. All other site study personnel, including the investigator  and study 
coordinator, as well as the subjects, will remain blinded to treatment until the study is unblinded by the study sponsor. The unblinded staff member will be instructed not to discuss the trial with the blinded staff 
to ensure the blind is maintained. 
Injections will be administered in different SC sites, to avoid injecting into th e same exact site (Appendix 
2). Detailed instructions for use will be provided in the IFU. 
 
8.3. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment  Groups  
Randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects to treatments, to increase the 
likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes (e.g., demographics, baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across 
Clinical Trial Protocol

  treatment groups. 
Subjects who provide written informed consent will be assigned a unique number in the screening process. 
This number will be used to identify the subject throughout the study. 
Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (Group 1: active CAM2038 SC 
injections or Group 2: placebo SC injections). Randomization will be stratified based on double blind dosing regimen. Subjects  randomized at a titration dose of either 4, 8 or 12 mg will remain on weekly 
doses. Subjects  randomized at a titration dose of 16, 24, or 32 mg will transition to monthly dosing. 
Therefore, there will be four different dose types.  
• A1 – Active  weekly  
• B1 – Placebo  weekly  
• A4 – Active  monthly 
• B4 – placebo monthly 
Due to the size of the study, it is expected that subjects will be balanced for various other baseline factors, including age. 
Once any subject number or randomization number is assigned, it cannot be reassigned to any other subject. 
This study will use central randomization, as described in Section 9.2. 
 
8.4. Selection of Dose  
The study will include the following doses based on each subject’s individual analgesia needs and tolerability: 
• CAM2038 q1w 6.25 mg/mL: 4 mg (BPN base); 0.64 mL SC injection 
• CAM2038 q1w 50 mg/mL: 8 mg, 12 mg, 16 mg, 24 mg, and 32 mg (BPN base); 0.16, 
0.24, 0.32, 0.48, and 0.64 mL SC injection 
• CAM2038 q4w, 356 mg/mL: 64 mg, 96 mg, and 128 mg (BPN base); 0.18, 0.27, and 
0.36 mL SC injection. 
Dose adjustments will be allowed during the Open L abel Titration Phase only.  
Rescue medication is oral hydrocodone/acetaminophen, 5 mg/325 mg tablets, q4- 6 h prn. The maximum daily 
dose is 30 mg/1950 mg/day. Subjects cannot take more than one rescue tablet per day, on average, in the 
week prior to randomization. 
On Day 1 of the Titration Phase, subjects will receive a test dose consisting of a single IM injection of 0.30 
mg (1.0 mL) Buprenex and will be assessed for any changes in QTcF or withdrawal prior to any 
administration of CAM2038. 
 
8.5. Selection and Timing of  Dose  
Subjects will be randomized to receive either CAM2038 or placebo at individualized doses. No fasting or special dietary requirements are required for the study.

  In order to reduce the potential for bias in the study, treatment group assignments will be double-blinded 
during the Double-Blind Phase. The subject, investigational site personnel, Sponsor, and Sponsor designees 
directly involved in the conduct and/or monitoring of this study will not be aware of the treatment group 
assignments.  
 
There is a slight difference in color and fill volume between the placebo and active CAM2038 q4w; however, 
the viscosity is the same. In order to maintain the blind given the differences  in color and fill volume, the 
following will be implemented during the Double- Blind  Phase:  
▪ The Injecting Clinician and any other staff involved in the injection process will not participate in subject evaluations, nor discuss any information regarding the inj ections  with the subjects or other 
study staff.  
▪ To keep the subjects blinded, appropriate steps will be taken to ensure that the subject is unable to 
view the syringe at any time.  
▪ The study staff will not ask the Injecting Clinician or any other staff invo lved in the  injection process for 
information regarding subject group assignment that might inadvertently unblind the study staff.  
Under normal circumstances, the blind will not be broken until all participants have completed treatment. In 
case of emergency, and only if the information is required by the i nvestigator  to ensure subject’s safety in 
managing a medical condition, the treatment may be unblinded at the site by using a code break module. The code break module will be provided by the Sponsor or designee. If possible, the i nvestigator  should 
contact the Sponsor prior to unblinding and after any actions have been taken. Whenever a treatment 
sequence is prematurely unblinded, the reason, date, and time of the unblinding and the individual who 
broke the blind must be documented. Individual code breaks will result in withdrawal of the subject from 
the study. 
 
8.7. Prior and Concomitant M edications and  Therapy  
All non- study medications, including prescription, over -the-counter, or herbal therapies, used by the 
subject will be documented for the 30 days prior to Screening and throughout the study. The i nvestigator  
will determine if the prior/concomitant medicatio n(s) affect the subject’s eligibility to participate or 
continue to participate in the study. The following restrictions on concomitant medications will be in place during the study: 
▪ Opioid receptors are likely to be occupied by BPN, which may reduce the a nalgesic effects of an 
opioid. The dissociation of BPN from the receptors may take up to 2 weeks (for CAM2038 q1w) or at least 2 months (for CAM2038 q4w) following the last CAM2038 injection. Therefore, subjects requiring analgesic emergency treatment or a nesthesia for surgery should ideally be treated with a 
non-opioid analgesic. Opioids may be used with caution, but as higher doses may be required for analgesic effect, there may be a higher potential for toxicity with opioid administration. The clinical 
course should be carefully evaluated and fully documented for subjects who have a requirement for 
any opioid analgesic for >7 days continually or general anesthesia for surgery. 
BPN is metabolized via CYP3A4. Because CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase plasma co ncentrations 
of BPN, CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole), macrolide antibiotics (e.g., 
erythromycin), and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir) are prohibited 
for at least 30 days prior to Screening. Interactions with CYP3A4 inducers have not been 
investigated; therefore, CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and 
rifampicin) are prohibited for at least 30 days prior to Screening.

  ▪ Concomitant use of other narcotic anestheti cs, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, 
or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (including alcohol and sedative/hypnotics) may 
cause respiratory and CNS depression. Use of these substances should be minimized during treatment 
with CAM2038. If these sedatives are required during the study, the Medical Monitor must be 
consulted. Subjects should be advised of the danger of concomitant use of sedatives while participating in the study. Subjects should be explicitly advised of the danger of IV abuse of 
benzodiazepines and abuse of alcohol while under treatment with CAM2038. 
The following concomitant medications and therapies may be permitted during the study: 
▪ Nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs will be permitted occasionally for headache, 
fever,  or other indications, aside from CLBP, for no more than 3 consecutive days and 
no more than the maximum daily recommended dose 
▪ Other non-opioid analgesics are permitted, but subjects must be on a stable dose (±20% dose and timing of administration) for at least 30 days prior to enrollment  
▪ Rescue medication  
▪ Anti-constipation medications  
▪ Aspirin at doses ≤325 mg/day for cardiovascular prophylaxis  
The following medications and therapies are permitted, but must remain stable (±20% dose 
and timing of administration) throughout the duration of the subject’s participation in the study: 
▪ Muscle  relaxants  
▪ Hypnotics (eszopiclone, zolpidem, zaleplon)  
▪ Antidepressants 
▪ Anticonvulsants  
▪ Physical  therapy 
▪ Biofeedback therapy 
▪ Acupuncture therapy 
▪ Herbal remedies (except products that can affect CYP3A4, such as St. John’s Wort)  
On a case-by- case basis, the investigator  is permitted to allow the use of some concomitant 
medications, for example, to treat an AE, as long as the i nvestigator  determines that the 
medication will not affect the subject’s safety or study integrity (e.g., topical medications). Wherever possible, the investigator should obtain approval from the Sponsor’s Medical 
Monitor prior to administering the medication.  
 
8.8. Treatment Compliance and Monitoring Diversion  
Because CAM2038 is administered by study personnel, no compliance procedures are necessary. Diversion will be monitored and recorded by reconciling the number of tablets of rescue medication dispensed against 
the number of tablets returned at each visit and diary entries. Any suspected or confirmed diversion will be 
documented and reported.

9.1. Demographics and Other Baseline  Characteristics  
9.1.1. Informed  Consent  
The nature of the study and its risks and benefits will be explained to the subject by the investigator or 
designated study personnel. The subject must voluntarily provide written informed consent on an ethics-
approved informed consent form (ICF), prior to performing any study- related procedures. The subject’s 
medical records must document that the consent process has been completed and that written informed consent has been obtained from the subject prior to the initiation of any study- specific procedures.  
Documentation that the subject was given adequate time to ask the investigator (or designee) questions 
about their participation in the study and that a signed and dated copy of the ICF was provided to the subject should also be included in the medical re cords or clinical  chart.  
 
9.1.2. Demographics  
The following demographics will be recorded: age (birth date), sex, race, and ethnicity. A complete 
psychosocial history will be obtained including education, employment status, marital/significant other 
status, resid ential status, and legal status/arrest history.  
 
9.1.3. Medical  History  
The complete medical history, up to the previous 5 years, will include histories of acute, chronic, or 
infectious disease; surgical or oncologic histories; and any reported conditions affecti ng major body systems 
or are the source of the subjects’ chronic pain. All findings on medical history will be evaluated by the investigator for clinical  significance.  
 
9.1.4. Medication  History  
All medications (prescription and non -prescription, herbal medications/natural health products, or 
investigational drugs) taken by the subjects during the 30 days prior to Screening will be recorded in the 
source documentation as medication history. A brief substance abuse history will also be collected. 
 
9.1.5. Contraceptive  Requirements  
Female subjects of childbearing potential must be using and willing to continue using medically 
acceptable contraception during the study from Screening through study completion. Examples of 
medically acceptable forms of contraception:  
▪ True abstinence (at the discretion of the investigator.  
▪ Intrauterine device in place for at least 3  months. 
▪ Non-surgical permanent sterilization (e.g., Essure procedure) at least 3 months prior to 
dosing.  
▪ Barrier method (condom or diaphragm) with spermicide for at least 14 days before Screening and 
through study completion.  
▪ Stable hormonal contraceptive use for at least 3 months prior to dosing and through study completion.  
Female subjects of non -childbearing potential are not required to use contraception or undergo pregnancy

  tests; however, they must have been surgically sterile (hysterectomy and/or bilateral 
oophorectomy/salpingo- oophorectomy, as determined by subject medical hi story) or congenitally sterile or  
must be post -menopausal. Post -menopausal is defined as being amenorrhoeic for at least 2 years without 
another cause or amenorrhoeic for at least 1 year without another cause and a documented follicle 
stimulating hormone level ≥50 mIU/mL.  
 
9.2. Eligibility Review and  Randomization  
At the Screening Visit, the investigator or designee must document that the subject meets all inclusion 
and no exclusion criteria via a signed note or eligibility and clinical stability checklist. In addition, subjects must fulfill the criteria for entry into the Transition Phase, the Titration Phase, the Double-Blind 
Phase and the Open Label Safety Extension Phase. Randomization will be accomplished centrally using an Interactive Response Technology managed by the Sponsor. 
 
9.3. Efficacy Assessments 
Details regarding primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints are provided in Section 9.6 and discussed 
further in Section 11.3 (Statistical Analysis). The following sections provide an overview of the efficacy 
assessments included in the study.  
 
9.3.1. Numerical Rating Scale (NRS -11) 
The NRS -11 is an 11-point scale with anchors at 0 (no pain) and 10 (worst pain imaginable). Subjects 
will record their API at Screening and test dose Day 1 on paper and their WPI and API scores over the 
past 24 hours daily in an electronic diary. Subjects should record their “pain at that moment” on their electronic diary immediately prior to taking rescue medication. Study personnel and subjects will 
undergo training on how to complete this assessment. 
 
9.3.2. Rescue Medications  
The number of rescue doses taken per day and proportion of days rescue medication was taken will be 
recorded using an electronic diary. Subjects will be ins tructed on the proper use and timing of rescue 
medication. Subject’s pain intensity will be recorded in the electronic diary whenever the subject takes rescue medication.  
 
9.3.3. EuroQoL Group 5- Dimension 5 -Level Self -Report Questionnaire (EQ -5D-
5L): Descriptive  System  
The EuroQoL Group 5- dimension 5- level self -report questionnaire (EQ -5D-5L) descriptive system is 
a generic, multidimensional, health- related, quality-of- life instrument. The  profile allows participants 
to rate their health state in 5 health domains:  mobility, self-care,  usual  activities, pain/discomfort, and 
mood using a 5- level  scale. These combinations of attributes will be converted into a weighted health -
state Index Score according to the United States  population -based algorithm, with higher scor es 
indicating better quality of life . 
 
9.3.4. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI)  
The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) is a self -administered instrument used to 
measure the effect of general health and symptom severity on work productivity and regular activities, and yields 4 types of scores: Absenteeism (work time missed)=Question  (Q)2/(Q2+4))*100); 
Clinical Trial Protocol 
HS-16-555 Braeburn Pharmaceuticals 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 69 of 99  Protocol Amendment 9 / Version: 10.0 
12-APR -2018 
  
  Presenteeism (impairment at work/reduced on -the-job effectiveness)=(Q5/10)*100); Work Productivity 
Loss (overall work impairment/absenteeism plus presenteeism)=(Q2/(Q2+Q4)+[(1 -
Q2/(Q2+Q4))x(Q5/10)])*100); and Activity Impairment=(Q6/10)*100. Scores range from 0 to 1 for each 
of the above 4 types; higher scores indicate greater impairment.  
 
9.3.5. Clinician Global Impression of Improvement (CGI -I) Scale 
The Clinician Global Impression of Improvement (CGI- I) scale is a 7 -point scale that requires the 
clinician to assess how much the subject's CLBP has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at 
the beginning of the intervention and rated as: 1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally 
improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse ( Guy, 1976 ). 
 
9.3.6. Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI- I) Scale  
The Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI- I) scale is a 7 -point scale that requires the subject to 
assess how much the his/her CLBP has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention and rated as: 1, much worse; 2, worse; 3, a little worse; 4, no change; 5, a little better; 
6, better; or 7, much better. 
 
9.4. Pharmacokinetic assessments  
 Venous blood samples (6 mL each) will be collected, as indicated in Tables 8  and 10. Samples will be 
collected, processed, and shipped according to instructions provided in the Study MOP. The actual date and time of each blood sample collection will be recorded. 
 The plasma concentrations of BPN and norBPN will be summarized descriptively. PK parameters of BPN 
will be evaluated and reported separately.  
 
9.5. Safety Asse ssments  
Safety monitoring will be performed throughout the study for all subjects. All AEs, regardless of causality or severity, will be recorded on the AE case report form (CRF). CAM2038/placebo injections may be 
discontinued as clinically indicated.  
Opio id-naïve subjects will not be permitted into this study, as the study drug is very potent and the doses 
for this study have been selected for opioid-experienced subjects. Opioid- experienced subjects are defined 
as taking ≥40 mg/day of oral morphine or MED, including ATC and rescue medication, for the management of their CLBP for the 14 days prior to Screening. 
 
9.5.1. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The following definitions, developed in accordance with the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and 
the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) Clinical Safety Data Management Guidance for 
Industry, E2A, will be used for the purpose of identifying AEs in this clinical study. 
 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigatio n subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE 
can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease tempor ally associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product, whether 
or not related to the investigational medicinal product. All AEs, including observed or volunteered 
Clinical Trial Protocol

Page 70 of 99  Protocol Amendment 9 / Version: 10.0 
12-APR -2018 
  
  problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate CRF. 
AEs, will be monitored and documented from the time of informed consent until the final Follow-up. AEs  
that have been designated as possibly related to study drug will be followed until resolution or stabilization. 
Subjects should be instructed to report any AE that they experience to the investigator . Investigators should 
make an assessment of AEs at each  visit and record the event on the appropriate AE CRF. 
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome, rather than individual associated signs and symptoms, 
should be identified by the i nvestigator and recorded on the CRF. However, if an observed or reported 
sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or syndrome by the i nvestigator , it 
should be recorded as a separate AE on the CRF. Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, or transfusion) should be recorded as an 
AE, not the procedure. 
Any medical condition already present at Screening should not be reported as an AE, unless  the medical 
condition or signs or symptoms present at Screening changes in severity or seriousness at any time during 
the study. In this case, it should be reported as an AE. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination (e.g., ECG) findings that are de tected 
during the study or are present at Screening and significantly worsen during the study should be 
reported as AEs. The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other a bnormal assessment is clinically significant. Clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory values occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant. Any abnormal test that is 
determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE. 
 
 
9.5.2. Adverse Drug  Reaction  
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considered an 
adverse drug reaction. “Responses” to a medicinal product means that a causal relationship between a 
medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out. 
 
9.5.3. Unexpected Adverse Drug  Reaction  
An Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction is defined as an adverse reactio n, the nature or severity of which is 
not consistent with the applicable product information.  
9.5.4. Assessment of Adverse Events by the Investigator 
The investigator will assess the severity (intensity) of each AE as mild, moderate, or severe,  and will also 
categorize each AE as to its potential relationship to study drug using the categories of related, possibly 
related, or not related.  
Assessment of Severity:  
Mild – An event that is easily tolerated and generally not interfering with normal daily activities.  
Moderate – An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal daily activities.  
Severe – An event that is incapacitating with inability to work or perform normal daily activities.  
Causality Assessment:  
The relationship of an AE to the administration of the study drug is to be assessed according to the following definitions: 
Clinical Trial Protocol 
HS-16-555 Braeburn Pharmaceuticals 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 71 of 99  Protocol Amendment 9 / Version: 10.0 
12-APR -2018 
  
  No (unrelated, not related, no relation) – The time course between the administration of study drug and the 
occurrence or worsening of the AE rules out a causal relat ionship and another cause (concomitant drugs, 
therapies, complications, etc.) is suspected.  
Possibly related – An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study 
drug, but that may be due to another cause and could also be reasonably explained by the subject’s clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. 
Yes (related) – The time course between the administration of study drug and the occurrence or worsening 
of the AE  is consistent with a causal rel ationship and no other cause (concomitant drugs, therapies, 
complications, etc.) can be identified.  
The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the study 
drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  
The following factors should also be considered: 
▪ The temporal sequence from study drug administration - 
o The event should occur after the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug 
exposure to event s hould be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
▪ Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases-  
o Each report should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the CLBP 
being treated and any other disease the subject may  have.  
▪ Concomitant drug- 
▪ The other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject receives should be examined to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in question.  
▪ Known response pattern for this class of study drug- 
o Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate whether a particular response is likely  to be a 
class effect.  
▪ Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses-  
o The exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the recipient and provide a 
logical and better  explanation for the  event.  
▪ The pharmacology and PK of the study drug-  
o The known pharmacologic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion) of the study drug should be considered.  
 
9.5.5. Serious Adverse Event   
An AE or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the i nvestigator  or Sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes: 
▪ Death  
▪ A life -threatening  AE 
o NOTE: An AE or adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening” if, in view of  the 
Clinical Trial Protocol 
HS-16-555 Braeburn Pharmaceuticals 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 72 of 99  Protocol Amendment 9 / Version: 10.0 
12-APR -2018 
  
  investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does 
not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
▪ Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalizati on 
o NOTE: Any hospital admission with at least one overnight stay will be considered an 
inpatient hospitalization. An emergency room visit without hospital admission will not be recorded as a SAE under this criterion, nor will hospitalization for a procedur e scheduled or 
planned before signing of informed consent. However, unexpected complications and/or 
prolongation of hospitalization that occur during elective surgery should be recorded as AEs 
and assessed for seriousness. Admission to the hospital for social or situational reasons (i.e., no place to stay, live too far away to come for hospital visits) will not be considered 
inpatient hospitalizations.  
▪ A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability  to 
conduct normal life  functions  
▪ A congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
▪ An important medical event  
NOTE : Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate me dical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room o r at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalizations, or the development of drug  dependency. 
All AEs requiring hospitalization or prolongation of a pre-existing hospitalization should be reported as SAEs, unless they occur after the final Follow-up or 30 days after early termination AND are not considered to be drug-related by the investigator. 
Hospitalizations meeting the following criteria will not be reported as an SAE but must be recorded 
on the appropriate CRF: study specified hospitalization, short- term administrative hospitalization for 
procedures, tests or treatments of conditions that would not otherwise constitute an SAE, or elective 
hospitalizations. 
 
9.5.6. Serious Adverse Event Reporting – Procedures for Investigators 
Initial Reports  
All SAEs occurring from the time of informed consent through Follow-up (or 30 days following early 
termination)  must be reported to Medpace Clinical Safety within 24 hours of the knowledge of the 
occurrence (this refers to any AE that meets any of the aforementioned serious criteria). Serious AEs that have been designated as possibly related to study drug will be f ollowed until resolution or stabilization.  
To report the SAE, complete the SAE form electronically in the electronic data capture (EDC) system for the study. When the form is completed, Medpace Safety personnel will be notified electronically and will retrieve the form. If the event meets serious criteria and it is not possible to access the EDC system, send  
an email to Medpace Safety at MedP ace-safetynotification@medpace.com  or call the Medpace SAE 
hotline (phone number listed below), and fax the completed paper SAE form to Medpace (fax number listed below) within 24 hours of awareness. When the EDC system becomes available, the SAE 
information must be entered within 24 hours of the system becoming available.

Follow-Up Reports 
The i nvestigator  must continue to follow the subject until the SAE has subsided or until the condition 
becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment), or  the subject  dies. 
Within 24 hours of re ceipt of follow -up information, the i nvestigator  must update the SAE form 
electronically in the EDC system for the study and submit any supporting documentation (e.g., subject discharge summary or autopsy reports) to Medpace Clinical Safety via fax or e- mail. If it is not possible to 
access the EDC system, refer to the procedures outlined above for initial reporting of SAEs.  
 
9.5.7. Pregnancy  
If the subject becomes pregnant during the study or within 30 days of discontinuing study drug, the 
investigator should report the pregnancy to Medpace Clinical Safety within 24 hours of being notified. 
Medpace Clinical Safety will then forward the Exposur e In Utero form to the i nvestigator  for completion. 
A subject becoming pregnant while on study drug will immediately be withdrawn from the study and early termination study procedures will be performed. 
The subject should be followed by the investigator until completion of the pregnancy. If the pregnancy 
ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the investigator should notify Medpace Clinical Safety. At 
the completion of the pregnancy, the investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the 
outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (i.e., postpartum 
complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 
 
9.5.8. Expedited  Reporting  
The Sponsor will report all relevant information about suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions that are fatal or life-threatening as soon as possible to the FDA, and in any ca se no later than 7 days after 
knowledge by the Sponsor of such a case, and that relevant follow- up information will subsequently be 
communicated within an additional 8 days. 
All other suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported to the FDA as soon as possible, 
but within a maximum of 15 days of first knowledge by the Sponsor. 
The Sponsor will also inform all investigator s as required.  
 
9.5.9. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
All protocol-specified laboratory tests on blood and urine samples will be performed at a selected 
central laboratory, with the exception of urine pregnancy tests that are conducted at the study site. The central laboratory will generate laboratory reports and forward them to the clinical site in a timely manner. It is the res ponsibility of the 
investigator  to review and sign all laboratory reports 
expeditiously, in order to document appropriate safety monitoring of study subjects. The 
investigator  should sign and date each laboratory report concurrent with her or his review an d 
should indicate the clinical significance of each abnormal/flagged value by noting “NCS” (not

  clinically significant) or “CS” (clinically significant), for example. Notations indicating that a 
value is clinically significant should also include a brief description of the underlying disease or condition that is associated with the value, e.g., “CS/mild anemia.” In general, abnormal, clinically significant laboratory values are expected to be associated with an item recorded in medical history or with an  AE. 
Blood and urine samples will be collected, processed, and shipped according to instructions from the safety laboratory. Additional laboratory samples may be taken at the discretion of the 
investigator  if the results of any tests fall outside reference ranges or clinical symptoms  necessitate 
testing to ensure safety. Specific hematology, coagulation, biochemistry, and urinalysis assessments are listed in Table 11.

12-APR -2018 
  
  A blood sample for a serology panel testing for hepatitis B surface antigen , hepatitis C RNA, and HIV 
will be performed for all subjects, unless a site’s IRB prohibits such testing. It is the i nvestigator ’s 
responsibility to understand and comply with all laws and regulations that apply to the testing of blood for 
HIV and hepatitis B and C. These laws and regulations may include state laws related to written consent, 
separate from the ICF for this study, and pre- and post- test counseling.  
 
The total blood volume to be taken per subject will be approximately 75 mL, as each blood 
collection will be approximately 15 mL.  
Every attempt should be made to collect samples for a urine toxicology test and BPN blood concentration if a subject experience an SAE or is discontinued from the study due to an AE.  
 
9.5.10. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will consist of temperature, blood pressure (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mmHg), pulse rate (beats per minute), pulse oximetry and respiratory rate (breaths/min) collected while sitting, following a rest period of at least 3 minutes.  
 
9.5.11. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram  (ECG) 
12-lead ECGs will be performed after the subject has been resting in a recumbent/supine position for at 
least 3 minutes. The ECG variables will include ventricular heart rate and the PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF intervals. The ECGs will be signed and dated by a medically -qualified individual to confirm review of the 
ECG and verify whether any abnormalities are clinically significant. In general, abnormal, clinically 
significant ECGs are expected to be associated wi th an item recorded in the medical history or with an 
AE. E CGs will be performed at the Screening Visit, 15 minutes before and 15 minutes and 1 hour after the 
Buprenex test dose, 1 and 24 hours, ± 3 hours, after the first CAM2038 q1w dose and then weekly during 
the Titration Phase Double-Blind Phase. For q1w subjects, ECGs will be performed monthly during the 
Double-Blind Phase.  For q4w subjects, ECGs will be performed at 6-10 hours (t max) after the first 
CAM2038/placebo q4w injection in the Double- Blind P hase, then monthly thereafter,  quarterly in the 
Open Label Safety Extension, and at the Final Study Visit/Early Termination.  
Male subjects who have a QTcF >450 ms or post- baseline increases ≥60 ms and female subjects who have 
a QTcF >470 ms or post- baselin e increases ≥ 60 ms will be monitored closely with repeated ECGs until 
their ECGs return to baseline. Any subjects with QTcF ≥ 500 ms will have their dose withheld and repeat 
ECGs until their ECG values return to baseline. In some cases, the subject will need to be discontinued 
from the study and will not receive any more injections of CAM2038/placebo. The investigator can refer 
the subject to a cardiologist, if necessary. 
 
9.5.12. Physical Examination 
A complete physical examination, including all major body systems (and height, weight, and BMI) will be performed at Screening and at the Final Study Visit/Early Termination.  
 
9.5.13. Injection Site  Examination 
CAM2038 or placebo injection sites will be examined during each scheduled visit for any signs of adverse 
site reactions, including erythema, pruritus, edema, pain, etc. The pain scale will be completed by the 
subjects within 10 minutes after each injection . The new injection site will also be examined within 15 
minutes after each injection to determine if any site related AEs have occurred. Additionally, the previous injection site will be examined in the similar fashion as the current injection site.  Subj ects will also be 
queried specifically about local tolerability AEs in  connection to the examinations. Injection site

  examination can only be performed by the blinded site personnel. If an injection site reaction is observed, 
non-identifying pictures of the injection site, accompanied by a ruler adjacent to the injection site, will be 
taken and placed in the subject’s files.  
 
9.5.14. Treatment Identification  Card  
Subjects will receive a wallet card indicating that they are receiving BPN as part of the study. This card 
should be presented to health care providers by the subject in the event of an emergency or if medications such as opioid analgesics are required. Sample wallet cards will be provided for IRB 
submission. 
 
9.5.15. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) will be used to assess both behavior and ideation 
that tracks all suicidal events and  provides a summary of suicidal ideation and behavior. It assesses the 
lethality of attempts and other features of ideation (frequency, duration, controllability, reasons for 
ideation, and deterrents), all of which are significantly predictive of completed suicide.  
Two versions of the C-SSRS will be used in this study: the Screening version (6 months and lifetime history) and the Since Last Visit version. The Screening version of the C- SSRS will be administered at 
Screening. The Since Last Visit version of the C -SSRS will be administered at all subsequent assessment 
times.  
The C -SSRS is to be administered by the investigator or his/her qualified designee at every visit as 
indicated in the Schedule of Assessments. Note: Qualified designee is defined as an individual who has 
completed the C -SSRS training within the last 2 years. The survey should be administered by the same 
assessor, where possible, throughout the study. 
 
9.5.16. Urine Drug  Screen  
A 12 -panel urine drug screen will test for the following drugs of abuse: 
tetrahydrocannabinol/marijuana, cocaine, phencyclidine, morphine, methamphetamines, methadone, 
amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, oxycodone and 
tricyclic antidepressants.  
 
9.5.17. Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale  (COWS) 
The study personnel will assess clinical observations indicative of withdrawal using the COWS. This scale 
consists of 11 common opiate withdrawal signs or symptoms, rated on a numeric scale and based on a timed period of observation of the subject by the rat er. 
 
9.5.18. Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale  (SOWS)  
Subjects will complete a self -assessment of withdrawal symptoms using the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal 
Scale (SOWS). This form contains 16 questions that rate the intensity of withdrawal from 0 (“Not at all”) 
to 4 (“Extremely”) . 
 
9.5.19. Other Safety  Considerations  
BPN may impair the mental and physical abilities required for performance of potentially dangerous 
tasks. Subjects will be instructed to avoid operating heavy machinery during induction and to exercise caution in performing activities requiring alertness, such as driving a car during the first few days after

  the beginning of the clinical trial or until such time that they are reasonably certain that their ability to 
engage in such activities is not adversely affected.  
 
9.6. Efficacy and Safety  Variables  
9.6.1. Primary Efficacy  Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in WAAPI and the primary timepoint will be  
Week 12 of the  Double-Blind Phase.   
 
9.6.2. Secondary Efficacy  Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows:  
▪ Change from baseline in the WAWPI scores at Week 12 of the Double- Blind Phase, based on an 
NRS -11. 
▪ Percentage of subjects with a 30% or greater decrease in API from baseline to Week 12 of the 
Double- Blind  Phase.  
▪ Rescue medication usage (number of days used and total dose) during the Double-Blind Phase.  
▪ Change from baseline to Week 12 of the Double- Blind  Phase in EQ -5D-5L score.  
▪ Change from baseline to Week 12 of the Double- Blind Phase in Work Produ ctivity and WPAI  
score.   
▪ Time to loss of efficacy, defined as discontinuation of study drug for lack of efficacy. 
 
9.6.3. Safety  Endpoints  
The saf ety endpoint are as follows:  
▪ Occurrence of AEs throughout the study. 
▪ Concomitant medication usage throughout the study. 
 
9.6.4. Exploratory Endpoints  
The saf ety endpoint are as follows: 
▪ Change from baseline to Week 12 of the Double- Blind Phase in Clinical Global Impression of 
Improvement (CGI -I) scale (as assessed by the Investigator).  
▪ Change from baseline to Week 12 of the Double- Blind Phase in Patient Global Impression of 
Improvement (P GI-I) scale (as assessed by the subject

10. DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE  
This study will be conducted under Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and all applicable regulatory 
requirements. To ensure compliance, the Sponsor or designee may conduct a quality assurance audit, as outlined in Section 10.2. 
Actions to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified investigator s 
and appropriate study centers; the review of protocol procedures with the investigator and study 
personnel prior to study start; the design of suitable source documents with appropriate instructions for 
use (where applicable); the internal audit of source data according to GCP and internal procedures to 
ensure their accuracy, completeness, and verifiability; as well as periodic site monitoring by the Sponsor. The Sponsor or designee will review source documents for accuracy and completeness during 
on-site monitoring visits and after their return to the Sponsor; any discrepancies will be resolved with the investigator , as appropriate.  
Significant and/or re peated non-compliance will be investigated and remedial action instituted when 
appropriate. Failure to comply with remedial actions may result in investigational site termination and regulatory authority notification.  
 
10.1. Data  Collection  
Source documents include, but are not limited to, original documents, data and records such as hospital/medical records (including electronic health records), clinic charts, lab results, participant 
diaries, data recorded in automated instruments, microfilm or magnetic media, and pharmacy records. 
This study will use an EDC system. At a minimum, all data required by the protocol should have supporting source documentation for entries in the EDC system.  
All CRFs will be completed by the site staff prior to review by the Sponsor’s monitor or designated representative. The Sponsor’s monitor or designated representative will review all source records on- site 
and compare them to the data collected on the CRF. All entries, corrections, and alterations will be made 
by the i nvestigator  or other authorized study personnel. All data entries will be verified for accuracy and 
correctness by independent monitors. The EDC system maintains a full audit trail. 
 
10.2. Study Auditing and  Monitoring  
Monitoring of the study site (including, but not limite d to, reviewing CRFs for accuracy and completeness) 
will be performed by the Sponsor’s designated monitor(s). The extent, nature, and frequency of on- site 
visits will be based on such considerations as the study objectives and/or endpoints, the purpose of the 
study, study design complexity, and enrollment rate. By signing the protocol, the investigator agrees that, 
within local regulatory restrictions and institutional and ethical considerations, authorized representatives 
of the Sponsor, a regulatory authority and/or an IRB may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, including the drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug accountability records, participant charts, and 
source documents, as well as other records related to study conduct. The purpose of the Sponsor audit or 
inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study- related activities and documents to 
determine whether the study- related activities were conducted, and data recorded, analyzed, and accurately 
reported according to the protocol, the site’s standard operating procedures, GCP guidelines of the ICH, and any applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator should contact the Sponsor immediately if 
contacted by a regulatory agency regarding an inspection
.

  11. STATISTI CAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF 
SAMPLE  SIZE 
 
11.1. Statistical and Analytical Plans 
Complete details of the statistical analyses to be performed will be documented in a statistical analysis plan 
(SAP), which will be completed prior to unblinding of the study data from the core study . This document 
will include more detail of analysis populations, summary strategies, and any amendments to the proposed 
analyses listed here, if necessary. A separate SAP will describe the analyses to be performed for the Open 
Label Safety Extension Phase. Any changes to the SAP will be outlined in the final study report. 
 
11.2. Analysis Populations 
Four analysis populat ions will be considered for the randomized Double-Blind Phase of the study: 
• Randomized Population: The Randomized Population will consist of all subjects who 
have been assigned random treatment.  
• Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population: The ITT Population will include all randomized  subjects. The 
primary efficacy analyses will be based on the ITT  Population.  
• Safety Population : The Safety Population will include all subjects who have received any study 
medication  (CAM2038). Analysis based  on this population will group subjects  according to the 
treatment they actually received, regardless of the treatment they were randomized to receive. All 
safety analyses will be based on the Safety  Population. 
• Per-Protocol Population: The Per -Protocol Population will include all ITT subjects  with no 
major protocol violations. Major protocol violation criteria will be established p rior to the 
database  lock and included in the protocol deviation plan.  Protocol deviations will be presented 
in the clinical study report.  Efficacy analyses may also be performed based on the per protocol 
population.   
Analysis populations for the Open L abel Safety Extension Phase will include:  
 
• Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population: The ITT Population will include all subjects enrolled into the 
Open Label Safety Extension. Efficacy analyses will be based on the ITT Population.

  11.3.1. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
A summary of demographics and baseline characteristics will be presented by treatment arm  and overall 
for the ITT , Safety and PK Populations. 
Demographic data and baseline clinical characteristics will be summarized.  
Tabular summaries and/or listings will be provided for baseline clinical characteristics, such as BMI, type 
of primary opioid use (e.g., prescription opioid pain relievers, other), medical history, inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, and medication history. 
 
11.3.2. Primary Efficacy  Analysis 
The primary analysis will be performed based on the ITT population.  The primary efficacy endpoint 
is the change from baseline in WAAPI and the primary timepoint will be Week 12 of the Double- Blind 
Phase.   
 
11.3.3. Missing Value  Imputation  
Unless otherwise stated, all other missing values will not be imputed. 
 
11.3.4. Sensitivity  Analysis 
Additional sensitivity analyses may be performed as appropriate.  
 
11.3.5. Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints include: 
▪ Change from baseline in the WAWPI s cores at Week 12 of the Double-Blind Phase based on an NRS -
11. 
▪ Percentage of subjects with a 30% or greater decrease in API from baseline to Week 12 of the 
Double- Blind  Phase.  
▪ Rescue medication usage (number of days used and total dose) during the Double-Blind Phase.  
▪ Change from baseline to Week 12 of the Double- Blind Phase in EQ -5D-5L score.  
▪ Change from baseline to Week 12 of the Double- Blind Phase in WPAI  score.  
▪ Time to loss of efficacy, defined as discontinuation of study drug for lack of efficacy.  
 
Change from Baseline in Weekly Average of Daily Worst Pain Intensity (WAWPI) over 
Time  
This variable will be analyzed via methods similar to those used to analyze the primary efficacy variable.  
 
Use of Rescue Medication  
Percentage of days in the study that rescue medication is used will be calculated for both treatment groups. 
This variable will be analyzed via an analysis of variance model with treatment effects. The estimated 
treatment effects, treatment difference and the two -sided 95% CI of the treatment differ ence will be 
presented. 
Percent of subjects who used rescue medication will also be calculated for both treatment groups. This 
variable will be analyzed using the Chi -square test. The percentages, the difference of the percentages, and

  the two -sided 95% CI of the treatment difference will be presented. The 95% CIs of the treatment 
difference will be calculated using normal approximation. 
 
Change from Baseline to Week 12 of the Double- Blind Phase in EQ -5D- 5L score  
This variable will be analyzed via methods s imilar to those used to analyze the primary efficacy variable. 
 
Change from Baseline to Week 12 of the Double- Blind Phase in WPAI score  
This variable will be analyzed via methods similar to those used to analyze the primary efficacy variable.  
 
Time to Loss of Efficacy  
Time to loss of efficacy is defined as discontinuation of study drug for lack of efficacy. Time to loss of 
efficacy will be analyzed via log -rank model with treatment effects. Time to event “survival” curves will 
be presented using the Kaplan -Meier method. Median time to event and the 95% CI of the median times 
will be presented, if estimable. In this time to event analyses, subjects who discontinue the study due to any reason other than “lack of efficacy” will be censored at the time th ey discontinued and subjects who 
completed the study will be censored at the time they completed the study. 
 
11.3.6. Analysis of Pharmacokinetics 
 
Plasma concentration data of BPN and norbuprenorphine (norBPN) will be listed for the PK Population by analyte, subje ct and actual time after last dose. Concentrations below the lower limit of quantification (BLQ) 
will be indicated by BLQ<0.0125 for BPN and BLQ<0.0200 for norBPN in the listings. Individual BPN and norBPN plasma concentration- time data will be displayed g raphically on linear and semi -logarithmic scales 
by analyte and dose.   Plasma concentrations of BPN and norBPN will be summarized descriptively (n, arithmetic mean, standard 
deviation [SD], geometric mean, geometric CV%, minimum, median and maximum) for t he PK Population 
by analyte, dose and scheduled time after last dose. Mean plasma concentration -time data will be displayed 
graphically on linear and semi -logarithmic scales by analyte.  
 Trough concentration during a dosage interval at steady state (C
ss,trough) of BPN and norBPN will be 
summarized (n, arithmetic mean, standard deviation [SD], geometric mean, geometric CV%, minimum, 
median and maximum) for  the PK Population by analyte, dose and scheduled time after last dose.  
 Model predicted PK parameters of BPN will be evaluated by population PK modeling and reported 
separately.  
 
 
11.3.7. Analysis of Safety 
Exposure will be summarized by treatment group. 
AEs will be coded by primary system organ class (SOC) and preferred term according to the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and summarized by number and percent of subjects in each primary 
SOC and preferred term. Summaries of these AE subsets will be presented for relationship to study drug, 
intensity, seriousness, AEs or SAEs leading to discontinuation, and AEs occurring in 5% or greater of any 
treatment group (by preferred term). Frequencies for deaths and hospitalizations will also be summarized

  by treatment group and overall. 
Data for clinical laboratory tests, ECG, COWS/SOWS, vital signs, injection site reactions, and physical 
examinations will be summarized using standard descriptive and change from baseline statistics. Shift 
tables and tabular  summaries of abnormalities will be provided, where appropriate. 
Medications will be coded using  the WHO  Drug Dictionary and summarized using descriptive 
statistics.  
By-subject listings will be provided for all safety data. 
 
11.4. Determination of Sample Size 
It is estimated that 170 subjects per treatment group will provide 90% power with a 2- sided test at a 5% 
significance level and standard deviation of API at Week 12 of 2.0 to detect a treatment effect of 0.7 unit (or a standardized effect of 0.35) in change from baseline in the WAAPI scores at Week 12 (Double-Blind Phase). Considering a titration success rate of 60%, this study will enroll approximately 
875 subjects to obtain 340 subjects achieving a successful dose in order to be randomly assigned to 
study drug treatment in the Double -Blind Phase. 
Additional statistical details will be outlined in the SAP.  
 
12. STUDY ADMINISTRATION AND INVESTIGATOR 
RESPONSIBILITIES  
 
12.1. Regulatory and Ethical  Considerations

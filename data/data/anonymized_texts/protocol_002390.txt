TITLE:  A randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study to as sess the safety , 
pharmacokinetics  and efficacy of MAU868 for the treatment of BK viremia in kidney transplant 
recipients  
PROTOCOL NUMBER:  MAU868 -201 
INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT:  MAU868 
PHASE: 2 
INDICATION:  Treatment of BK viremia  
OBJECTIVES:  
The primary o bjective of this study is:  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of MAU868  
Secondary objectives of this study are:  
• To assess the impact of MAU868 on BK virus related outcomes including viruria, 
viremia, BK virus nephropathy, graft function and rejection am ong renal transplant 
recipients  with BK viremia  
• To assess the pharmacokinetics of MAU868  
BACKGROUND:  
Infection wit h BK virus (BKV) is essentially ubiquitous, with estimates ranging between 80 and 
90% of the population globally. Primary infection occurs in  childhood (usually by 10 years of 
age) and is either a mild, non -specific, self -limited illness or asymptomatic. P ersistent infection 
is established in the epithelial cells of the renal tubules, ureters, and bladder, and is effectively 
controlled, though never eliminated by the immune system. Compromised immune function can 
lead to uncontrolled viral replication and d evelopment of disease. The two  best-characterized 
BKV-associated diseases are a nephropathy that affects kidney transplant recipients  
(i.e., a disease of the allograft) and hemorrhagic cystitis , with or without renal involvement , that 
affects hematopoieti c stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. BKV nephropathy (BKVN) is a 
leading cause of premature allograft loss, second only to allograft rej ection. Patients who 
develop BK viremia irrespective of whether biopsy confirms BKVN have been reported to have 
significantly lower allograft survival at 10  years (24.8% vs 85.6%, P <0.001; Moura et al 2017). 
BKV-associated hemorr hagic cystitis prolongs hospitalizations, often requires administration of 
blood products and urologic intervention, can involve the native kidneys  and can lead to death 
in the most severe cases. BKV has four major genotypes , but genotype is not linked wit h the 
risk or severity of disease.  
MAU868 is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) that binds the viral capsid protein, VP1, that 
is responsible for binding to the surface of host cells (i.e., the first step in the infection of new 
cells; Tsai and Qian 2010). MAU868 neutralizes all four BKV genotypes at sub -nanomolar

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 concentrations in vitro. It binds to an epitope on VP1 that is highly conserved . Resistance -
associated BKV variants were not identified in two ind ependent long -term in vitro selection 
studies, demonstrating that MAU868 has a high in vitro barrier-to-resistance. It is being 
developed for the treatment  of clinically significant BKV infection in immunosuppressed 
populations, notably solid organ and hem opoietic stem cell trans plant (HSCT) recipients.  
The results of the non -clinical studies identify no specific risk for investigation of MAU868 in 
human subjects, as expected for a human monoclonal antibody that recognizes a foreign 
(i.e., non-human) antigen. No MAU868 -related eff ects were observed in rats after once weekly 
dosing (5 doses total) of MAU868 up to 750 mg/kg IV and 150 mg/kg S C. In addition, MAU868 
did not bind human tissues (42 normal tissues) or blood smears as assessed by 
immunohistochemistry.  
To date, a total of 27 subjects (26 healthy volunteers and 1 subject with BKV nephropathy) have 
received MAU868. A first -in-human, randomized, blinded, placebo -controlled, single 
ascending dose study to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of MAU868 
following IV or SC administration to healthy adult subjects was performed. Twenty-six subject s 
received doses of MAU868 up to 100 mg/kg IV or 3 mg/kg S C; all doses were safe and well 
tolerated. No deaths or SAEs were reported , and there were no AEs that led to the 
discontinuation of dosing or the study. After single doses, serum concentrations of MAU868 
declined in a biphasic manner with a terminal half -life of 23 to 30 days. The estimated relative 
bioavailability of MAU868 fo llowing S C administration was 57.6%. Admi nistration of 
MAU868 increased anti -BKV antibody titers and the neutralizing potency of the serum, while 
administration of placebo had no effect.  
One adult female kidney transplant recipient was treated with MAU868 1350 mg IV for 
refractory BKV nephropathy  (i.e., preceding persistent BK viremia for ~7 months with biopsy 
confirmation) as part of an individual patient managed access program requested and initiated 
by the treating physician. She received a total of 11 d oses over 6 months, most of which were 
administered every two weeks. The treating physician elected to pre -treat the patient with 
steroids, antihistamines, and acetaminophen for each infusion. MAU868 was considered safe 
and well tolerated by the patient wi th no adverse events related to MAU868 or  the infusion.  
Further details of non -clinical and clinical studies conducted to date with MAU868 can be found 
in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
To date, there are no effective antiviral therapies directed at BKV . MAU868 has the potential to 
be a safe a nd well-tolerated therapy that can eliminate a threat to the survival of the renal 
allograft and greatly simplify the post -transplantation care of kidney transplant recipients.

STUDY D ESIGN AND DURATION:  
This is a randomized, placebo -controlled, double-blinded, proof -of-concept study in kidney 
transplant recipients. Up to 36 subjects with BK viremia will participate in 1 of 3 sequential 
cohorts.  Each cohort will randomize approximately  12 subjects (8 MAU868 and 4 placebo).  
The study will consist of a screening period, a 12-week treatment period and a 24-week 
follow-up period.  
Protocol-specific procedures should not be performed until the patient has consented to 
participation in the s tudy.  However, assessments and procedures performed as part of standard 
of care prior to informed consent, including determination of BK vir al load in plasma may be 
used to qualify a patient for the study.  Once qualifying BK viremia has been confirmed, s ubjects 
should be randomized as soon as possible and no more than 10 days after the sample 
documenting the viremia was collected.   
During th e treatment per iod, subjects will receive MAU868 or placebo approximately every 
28 days (every 4 weeks) for 12 week s (4 doses total). Urine and blood will be monitored for 
BKV DNA by PCR weekly for the first 6 weeks after initiation of treatment. For the r emainder 
of the treatment period, urine and blood must be collected for BKV DNA by PCR at least every 
other week. H owever, the Investigator may also request testing more frequently (i.e., weekly) 
than mandated by the protocol after the first 6 weeks of tre atment and when clinically indicated. 
During the study, BKV DNA by PCR will be tested at the central laboratory.  P harmacokinetics 
(PK), viral resistance, and anti -drug antibodies (ADA) will also be monitored. Subjects should 
continue study drug until the last scheduled dose, regardless of changes in plasma BK viral load, 
use of rescue therapy, and/or need for change i n immunosuppressive regimen for any reason.  
During the 24 -week follow -up period, 3 follow -up visits will be scheduled. At each visit, urine 
and blood samples for BKV DNA and samples for PK will be collected. Investigators may 
collect samples for BKV DNA m ore often as clinically indicated. During the follow -up period, 
BKV DNA by PCR will be tested at the central laboratory.

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 Routine post -transplantation care is to be guided by the Investigator ’s discretion and site 
standard of care.  This includes decisions to change the immunosuppressive regimen for a 
subject for any reason except for changes in immunosuppression in response to BK viremia . 
In order to treat BK viremia, prior to randomization, (i .e., prior to screening, during the 
screening period and at the Baseline Visit) Investigators are permitted to decrease or alter 
immunosuppressive therapy at their discretion and/or per standard of care  at their site.   
However, in the fir st 4 weeks after randomization, Investigators should refrain from additional 
changes in immunosuppressive regimen in response to BKV unless the viral load has increased 
by >1 log and the Investigator determines that a c hange is in the best interest of the subject. 
Use of other antiviral agents including cidofovir and leflunomide as well as IVIG are not 
permitted during the first 4 weeks of therapy and are strongly discouraged thereafter.   
Use of fluoroquinolones for rea sons other than treatment of BK V is permitted.  
Between screening and the last visit, subjects will attend a total of 14 planned visits. 
Unscheduled visits are permitted  at the Investigator’s discretion.  
A schematic representing the study’s design is inclu ded below:  
 
 
 
Progression from Cohor t 1 to Cohort 2  
Approximately 12 weeks after the 9th subject in Cohort 1 has been randomized, blinded safety 
data will be reviewed by the Sponsor Study Review Committee ( SSRC). Members of this 
committee will include a Sponsor medical representative, the M edical Monitor and the study’s 
Principal Investigator.   Cohort 2 will be opened for screening once the following criteria have 
been met:  
1. All 12 subjects from Cohort 1 have been randomized,

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 2. No significant safety issues r elated to the administration of MAU86 8 have been 
identified by the SSRC based on the blinded safety review described above as well as an 
assessment of any new SAEs reported after the SSRC review and before randomization 
of the 12th subject in Cohort 1.  
3. No significant safety issues related to the administration of MAU868 have been 
identified by t he independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) (see below) . 
The Chair of the DSMB will be notified of the SSRC’s decision to open Cohort 2.  
Accordingly,  some subjects enrolled in Cohort 1  will continue participation in the study 
through the 24 -week follow -up period while new subjects are screened and enrolled into 
Cohort 2.  
Progression from Cohort 2 to Cohort 3  
Cohort 3 will not be opened for screening and enrol lment until an evaluation o f unblinded safety, 
efficacy and pharmacokinetics findings from both Cohorts 1 and 2 through the 12 -week 
treatment period has been completed by the  SSRC. 
DOSAGE FORMS AND DOSE REGIMEN : 
The following treatment arms and dosing reg imens are planned.

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 RATIONALE FOR DOSE AND SCHEDULE SELECTION:  
In Cohort 1, MAU868 will be administered as an IV infusion of 1350 mg in 250 mL D5W over 
a period of at least  60 minutes. In Cohort 2, MAU868 will be administered as an IV infusion of  
6750 mg in 250 mL D5W over a period of at least 180 minutes on Study Day 1 and at 1350 mg 
in 250 mL D5W over a period of at least 60 minutes for subsequent doses. In Cohort 3, MAU868 
will be adm inistered as an IV infusion of 6750 mg in 250 mL D5W over a p eriod of at least 
180 minutes. All infusions will be followed by at least a 25 mL D5W flush to run at the same 
infusion rate as the dose of IP.  
There are no rigorous clinical studies that identif y target exposures required for BKV antiviral 
efficacy and no robust animal model of BKV infection or disease ; therefore, the most robust 
estimate of the clinical dose considers the following parameters  1) MAU868 BKV neutralizing 
activity in vitro, 2) simulation of serum concentrations based on a model created from Phase 1 
data in healthy volunteers , and 3) published literature on the extravascular distribution of 
immunoglobulin (renal 13.7%) . For clinical efficacy, our therapeutic approach is  to maintain the 
Ctrough in target tissues ≥10 -fold the 50% effective conce ntration (EC50) of the least su sceptible 
BKV genotype (genotype III).  A review of the information is as follows:  
A high-content imaging -based in vitro neutralization assay in RPTE cell s was used to 
characterize the antiviral activity of MAU868 determined against representative isolates from 
the four major genotypes of BKV (genotypes I, II, III, and IV, respectively); genotypes I and IV 
account for approximately 95% of the global seropre valence, while genotypes II and III account 
for the remaining 5% ( Zheng et al 2007; Zhong et al 2009 ).  
Table 1. MAU868 In Vitro Neutralization Activity  
Genotype  EC50 (µg/mL) EC90 (µg/mL) 
BKV Genotype I  0.009 + 0.010 0.102 + 0.028 
BKV Genotype II  0.040 + 0.025 4.160 + 6.076 
BKV Genotype III  0.093 + 0.057 2.662 + 2.805 
BKV Genotype IV  0.020 + 0.020 0.465 + 0.318 
 
A first-in-human study explored single ascending doses of MAU868 (1, 3, 10, 30, and 
100 mg/kg IV) and the serum concentration data was used to develop a PK model.  The model 
was then used to estimate C trough concentrations for a series of 3 treatment regimens . To have a 
treatment  effect on BK viremia, MAU868 would need to curtail BKV replication  in the target 
tissue (i.e., kidney). Based on an in vivo radiolabeled s tudy in animals and physiologically based  
pharmacokinetic ( PBPK) modeling estimates, the antibody biodistribution coefficient in kidney 
is 13.7% ( Shah and Betts 2013 ). The estimated trough levels for each treatment arm were 
compared directly to in vitro-determined antiviral activity (EC 50 and EC 90) for each BKV 
genotype and corrected for the assumed antibody distributions in kidney.

Page 11 of 91 
Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 These data s how that the planned dose regimens of MAU868 for each treatment arm provides 
high virus  neutralizing tissue levels with kidney exposures at Ctrough ≥10-fold the EC 50 of the 
least susceptible BKV genotype (III). Specifically, k idney exposures at Ctrough range from 253 to 
2618-fold (Cohort 1), 365  to 3775-fold (Cohort 2), and 1264 to 13,061 -fold (Cohort 3)  above 
the EC 50 at the end of treatment (12 wee ks, range = least to most susceptible BKV genotype). 
Using EC 90 determinations, k idney exposures at Ctrough range from 6 to 231-fold (Cohort 1), 
8 to 33-fold (Cohort 2), and 28 to 1152 -fold (Cohort 3)  above the EC 90 at the end of treatment.   
A 12-week trea tment period was selected to ensure sustained levels of MAU868 to inhibit virus 
replication and promote virus clearance.  The subsequent 24-week follow-up period will allow 
evaluation  of the durability of effect and additional safety and PK observations . 
From a safety perspective, the highest administered dose of MAU868 expected in this  study 
(6750 mg =  100 mg/kg for a 67.5 kg patient ) was also the highest administered dose (MAU868 
100 mg/kg) investigated in the first -in-human study and below the no observed  adverse effect 
level (NOAEL) exposure (750 mg/kg) in the 4 -week repeat -dose toxicity study in rats. 
Specifically, human steady -state AUC ex posure at the proposed dose of MAU868 1350 mg 
(20 mg/kg for a 67.5 kg patient) once monthly (206231 µg·hr/mL) provid es safety margins of 
6.9X and 5.0X, respectively, compared to the NOAEL (750 mg/kg; 1420000 µg·hr/mL) in the 
4-week rat study and to the AUC  at the highest human dose (100 mg/kg; 1031155 µg·hr/mL) 
tested to date. Likewise, human steady -state AUC exposure a t the proposed dose of MAU868 
6750 mg once monthly (1031155 µg·hr/mL) provides a safety margin of 1.4X compared to the 
NOAEL (750 mg/kg; 142 0000 µg·hr/mL) in the 4 -week rat study.

o Serum sickness determined to be Grade 2 or higher based on CTCAE version 5.  
Changes in  BKV plasma  viral load, use of rescue therapy , and/or need for change in 
immunosuppressive regimen for any reason should not prompt early discontinuation of therapy.  
If a subject is discontinued from study drug treatment administration the subject will still be 
encouraged to complete follow -up visits and assessments necessary for appropriate safety 
follow-up. 
Study participation by an indivi dual subject must be prematurely discontinued for any of the 
following reasons:  
• The subject withdraws consent or requests discontinuation for any reason.  
• Occurrenc e of any medical condition or circumstance that exposes the subject to 
substantial risk and/o r does not allow the subject to adhere to the requirements of the 
protocol. 
• Any SAE, clinically significant adverse event, severe laboratory abnormality, 
intercurrent illness, or other medical condition which indicates to the Investigator or 
Sponsor that continued participation is not in the best interest of the subject.  
• Subject failure to comply with protocol requirements or study -related procedures.  
If a subject withdraws prematurely from the study, study staff should make every effort to 
contact the Sponsor prior to discontinuation, if possible, and to complete the full panel of 
assessments scheduled for the Early Termination  Visit. The reason for subject withdrawal must 
be documented in the electronic Case Report Form.  
In the case of subjects lost to follow -up, attempts to contact the subject must be made and 
documented in the subject’s medical records.

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 STUDY STOPPING RULES:  
The study may be discontinued , or paused, for reasons that may include (but are not limited to): 
reasons of safety, lack of study drug availability, inability to enroll the study, or decision by a 
regulatory authority or the Sponsor  (see Appendix D) . 
In the event that a dosing cohort shows  efficacy and it is not anticipated that additional dosing 
would show added efficacy, the sponsor may choose to stop and not complete the study.  
Further, in the instance of 2 or more treatment -related SAEs, 2 or more treatment related AEs 
Grade 3 or highe r or 2 or more clinically significant treatment -related Grade 3 or higher 
laboratory abnormalities, the study will be paused pending an SSRC review of the safety events. 
The Sponsor will inform the applicable regulatory authorit y(ies) of any safety -related pause in 
the study.     
 In the case that the study is discontinued, the Sponsor will promptly inform the Investigators 
and applicable regulatory authority(ies) of the termination of the study and the reason(s) for the 
termination. The Investigators are re sponsible for promptly informing subjects that they must 
discontinue study drug. The Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC) will also be informed promptly and provided the reason(s) for the termination, as specified 
by the appl icable regulatory requirement(s).  
DATA SAFETY MONITORING BOARD : 
An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB ) will review cumulative unblinded safety 
data as outlined in the DSMB  charter. 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS : 
Analysis Populations : 
The primary e fficacy analysis will be performed in the modified ITT (MITT) analysis 
population . The MITT includes subjects who meet all of the following criteria:  
• Received at least 1 dose of study drug   
• Has at least 1 post -baseline plasma BK viral load result available  
Additional analyses will be performed in the Intent -To-Treat (ITT) analysis population 
(all subjects randomized) . 
The safety population will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
The PK population will include all subjects with  at least 1 post -baseline PK sample available.

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 Efficacy Analyses  
In all efficacy analyses, the placebo subjects from the cohorts will be combined. Thus, the 
analysis models will include treatment group (four levels: placebo, low dose, medium dose, high 
dose) as a factor. Time -to-event endpoints will be analyzed using Co x proportional hazards 
regression models. Proportion endpoints will be analyzed using logistic regression models.  
Quantitative endpoints will be analyzed using one-way analysis of varianc e (ANOVA) models . 
In all analyses, pairwise contrasts comparing each  of the three active groups to the combined 
placebo group will be tested.  All efficacy and  exploratory analyses will be conducted using 
two-sided tests at the alpha=0.05 level of significa nce, with no adjustment for multiplicity.  
Additional efficacy analys es will be conducted using the data from each cohort.  Quantitative 
endpoints will be analysed using the two -sample t test and proportion endpoints will be analysed 
using Fisher’s exact te st. Due to the small sample sizes, time -to-event variables will be 
summarized descriptively.  
Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses will be performed on data from the Safety Analysis Population. Adverse 
events (AEs), vital signs, ECGs and clinical laboratory evaluations will be summarized by 
appropriate descriptive statistic s.  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
MAU868 levels in serum will be determined by a validated ELISA -based method. A  detailed 
description of the method used will be included in the PK bioanalytical data report. 
The anticipated Lower Limit of Quantification (LLOQ) i s 50.0 ng/mL. Concentrations will be 
expressed in mass per volume units (e.g., ng/mL). Missing values or those concentrations below 
the LLOQ will be labeled as such in the data listings and  reported as “zero” in data presentations 
and calculations.  
MAU868 serum concentration data will be listed by subject and visit/sampling time point. 
Descriptive summary statistics of trough levels will be provided by visit/sampling time point, 
including th e frequency (n, %) of concentrations below the LLOQ and reported as  zero. 
Summary statistics will include mean (arithmetic and geometric), SD, CV (arithmetic and 
geometric), median, minimum and maximum. Concentrations below LLOQ will be treated as 
zero in summary statistics.  
Summary statistics (e.g., mean, standard devia tion) and individual subject listing of serum 
concentration measurements of MAU868 at the assigned time points will be provided as 
surrogates of systemic exposure.  
Interim Analyses  
Separate from the blinded safety review by the SSRC which will  enable enrol lment of subjects 
into Cohort 2, unblinded safety and tolerability data (adverse events, clinical laboratories, 
vitals/physical exams and ECGs), efficacy data (BK viral load in the plasma) and PK (MAU868 
plasma levels) will be reviewed by the SSRC once all 12 subjects in Cohort 1 have completed 
the treatment period . The treatment assignment in Cohort 1 will be unblinded; however, these 
data will not include associated subject or site identif iers. The objectives of this interim analysis

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 are to evaluate wheth er four doses MAU868 1350 mg IV administered every 28 days for a total 
of 4 doses demonstrate:  
• safety and tolerability signals compared to placebo  
• a decrease in BK viral load in plasma compared to placebo  
• predicted MAU868 plasma levels  
The conclusions from this first analysis will be used by the Sponsor to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of MAU868 early -on in this first -in-patient study. Unless a significant safety issue 
related to administ ration of MAU868 has been identified, the conclusio ns will have no impact 
on Cohort 2 or the study’s design.  
Following completion of the 12 -week treatment periods for Cohorts 1 and 2, cumulative 
unblinded data from both cohorts will be reviewed for safety and tolerability (adverse events, 
clinical laborato ries, vitals/physical exams and ECGs), efficacy (BK viral load in the plasma) 
and PK (MAU868 plasma levels). The treatment assignments will be unblinded; however, these 
data will not include associated sub ject or site identifiers. The objectives of this second interim 
analysis are to evaluate whether four doses MAU868 1350 mg IV administered every 28 days 
or MAU868 6750 mg IV administered as a first dose followed by 3 more doses of MAU868 
1350 mg IV adminis tered every 28 days demonstrate:  
• safety and  tolerability signals compared to placebo  
• a decrease in BK viral load compared to placebo  
• predicted MAU868 plasma levels  
Based on the SSRC’s safety, efficacy and PK conclusions for Cohorts 1 and 2, the dosing 
regimen for Cohort 3 may be adjusted in dosage and/or duration; however, the dosage and 
duration for Cohort 3 will not exceed the dose already specified in the protocol. Cohort 3 will 
not be opened for screening and enrollment until this evaluation has been co mpleted. 
Sample Size Determinations : 
This study will randomize  approximately 36 subjects (12 per cohort) to  MAU868 and placebo 
in a 2:1 ratio (24 MAU868 and 12 placebo; 8 MAU868 and 4 placebo per cohort).  This study 
is not powered to an efficacy endpoint.   The number of subjects chosen will prov ide data useful 
in determining proof of concept.

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
1.1 BKV Infection and Nephropathy  
The human polyomavirus BK (BK viru s or BKV) is a DNA virus that infects 80 -90% of the world's 
population ( Kean 2009;  Boothpur  and Brennan 2010; Egli et al 2009). It is generally acquired 
during chi ldhood and, subsequently, establishes a lifelong infection in renal tubular  and 
uroepithelial cells ( Antonsson 2010 ).  Although the primary and persistent infections are generally 
clinically silent, BKV reactivation may occur  in the setting of organ transplantation  when innate 
immune T cell immunity  is compromised by immunosuppressive drugs ( Ambalathingal 2017 ). 
In particular, recipients of kidney transplant may develop nephropathy and recipients  of 
hematopoietic stem cell transplants may develop hemorrhagic cystitis.  
BKV replication in immunosuppressed kidney transplant recipients follows a well -established 
clinical course from viruria (~ 35% of all kidney transplant recipients) to viremia (~11%) to 
nephropathy (3 -5%; Sawinski and Goral 2015;  Hirsch et al 2013;  Dharnidharka et al 2011 ). 
The median onset of detectable viruria is 5  weeks post -transplantation (rang e 2 to 41 weeks), and 
the median onset of viremia is 10 weeks (range 5  to 51 weeks; Babel et al 2009 ). The median onset 
of BKV nephropathy is 42 weeks post -transplantation (range 7  to 113 weeks;  
Hirsch and Steiger 2003).  
Patients who develop BK viremia irrespective of  whether biopsy confirms BKV  nephropathy  have 
been reported to have significantly lower allograft survival at 10  years (24.8% vs 85.6%, P <0.001; 
Moura et al 2017). By contrast, patients w ithout viruria do not develop viremia; lik ewise, patients 
without viremia do not develop nephropathy (Babel et al 2009 ).  
The main risk factor for BKV replication and the development of diseas e is the level of 
immunosuppression, including the type of induction therap y used prior to transplantation. 
A number of other risk factors including recipient age, male sex, allograft rejection, degree of 
human leukocyte antigen mismatching, length of cold  ischemia time, an d recipient and donor BKV 
serostatus (e.g., donor positiv e-recipient negative) have also been implicated 
(Sawinski and Goral 2015). No single risk factor is reliably predictive . 
Current treatment guidelines recom mend reduction of immunosuppression to control the infection, 
typically whe n BK viremia is >104 copies/mL  (KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline 2009 ). Clearance 
of the viremia takes months and often requires multiple stepwise re ductions in the 
immunosuppression. Subjects for whom immunosuppression is r educed have an increased risk of 
acute allograft rejection (Bohl and Brennan 2007;  Sood et al 2012 ).  
There are no specific or effective anti -BKV therapies.  These data underscore the need for more 
effective means to control or prevent BKV reactivation.  MAU868 has the potential to be a safe 
and well-tolerated therapy that can eliminate a threat to the survival of the renal allog raft and 
greatly simplify the post -transplantation care of kidney transplan t recipients.

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 1.2 MAU868  
BKV encodes only seven proteins and lacks the traditional targets for antiviral drugs 
(e.g., protease, polymerase). The non -enveloped icosahedral virion of BKV is composed of three 
different viral proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3), but only VP1  (the major viral capsid protein) is exposed 
on the virion surface.  
MAU868 is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) that binds the viral capsid protein, VP1, that is 
responsible for b inding to the surface of host cells (i.e., the first step in the infection of new cells; 
Tsai and Qian 2010). MAU868 neutralizes all four BKV genotypes  at sub-nanomolar 
concentrations in vitro. It recognizes a conformational epito pe on VP1 that is highly conserved, 
resulting in a high barrier to resistan ce in vitro. It is being developed for the prevention of clinically 
significant BKV infection in immunosuppressed populations, notably solid or gan and HCT 
recipients.  
The most relev ant data for the present study are summarized in the sections below. For  detailed 
information, please refer to the MAU868 Investigator's Brochure.  
1.3 Non-clinical Data  
The non-clinical evaluation of MAU868, a human monocl onal antibody recognizing a non -human 
antigen, was performed according to the ICH S6(R1) guidelines. Details rega rding all non -clinical 
studies conducted to date with MAU868 are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
No genotoxicity or reproductive toxic ology studies were conducted because M AU868 1) is a fully 
human monoclonal IgG1 antibody comprising native non -modified amino acids, 2) does not 
contain any chemical linkers or chelators, 3) is highly specific for an epitope unique to human 
polyomaviruses BK and JC, and 4) there are no pharmac ologically relevant animal models.  
Because MAU868 is a protein comprised of  native amino acids and because if its pharmacological 
mechanism of action it is considered to be non -genotoxic.  
BKV VP1 is the major viral ca psid protein and the only protein expo sed on the virion surface. 
Binding of VP1 to ganglioside receptors on the h ost cell surface initiates internalization of the 
virus (Tsai and Qian 2010 ). Binding of MAU868 to VP1 blocks these i nteractions and prevents 
infection of new cells.  
MAU868 has picomolar affinity for BKV VP1 and sub -nanomolar neut ralization potency against 
all four BKV genotypes.

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 MAU868 binds to a conformation -dependent e pitope on VP1. T he key contact residues (Y169, 
R170, and K172), all located within the VP1 EF loop, are 100% conserved among reference 
isolates and 156 ( genotype I) and 66 ( genotype IV) GenBank sequences analyzed. Mutations at 
these locations confer either  a loss of viral  fitness (i.e., inability to replicate) or no change in 
susceptibility to MAU868.  
Resistance selection experiments in renal proximal tubule epithelial cells infected  with BKV 
genotype I and genotype IV, which comprise 95% of global seroprev alence, failed t o generate 
virus with genotypic resistance to MAU868 after six serial passages (>84 days in cell culture). 
Mutant BK viruses harboring a series of VP1 polymorphisms at other locations in VP1 that were 
identified through analyses of availabl e sequences in G enBank also confer no reduced 
susceptibility to MAU868  in vitro. The available non -clinical data demonstrate a high barrier to 
the development of resistance to MAU86 8 in vitro. 
Repeated dose -toxicity studies were conducted in rats. O nce weekly IV or SC administration for 
4-weeks (5 doses total) of MAU868 up to 750  mg/kg IV and 150 mg/kg SC to rats was well 
tolerated. The NOAEL for IV administration was 750  mg/kg/week;  the NOAEL for SC 
administration was 150 mg/kg/week.  
1.4 Clinical Data  
To date, a total of 27 s ubjects (26 healthy volunteers and 1 subject with BKV nephropathy) have 
received MAU868.  
A first-in-human, randomized, blinded, placebo -controlled, single ascending dose study to assess 
the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of MAU8 68 following IV or SC administration to 
healthy adult subjects was performed. A total of 33 subjects parti cipated in the study; 26 subjects 
received MAU868 and 7 received placebo.  MAU868 doses of 1, 3, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg 
(4 subjects received each dose)  were administered  IV as 1-hr infusions. S ix subjects received 
MAU868 3  mg/kg as a bolus S C injection. Administration of study drug was followed by 
assessments for safety, pharmacokinetics, and testing for anti -drug antibodies up to 105 days 
post-dose. Ex vi vo assessments o f neutralizing serostatus were also performed prior to and 28 days 
after administration of  MAU868 or placebo.  No deaths or SAEs were reported, and there were no 
AEs that led to the discontinuation of the infusion or the study.  
One adult fem ale kidney trans plant recipient was treated with MAU868 1350 mg IV for refractory 
BKV nephropathy (i.e., p receding persistent BK viremia for ~6 months with biopsy confirmation) 
as part of an individual patient managed access program requested and initiated  by the treating  
physician. She received a total of 11 doses over 7 months, most of which were administere d every 
two weeks. The treating physician elected to pretreat the patient with steroids, antihistamines, and 
acetaminophen for each infusion. MAU868 w as safe and well  tolerated by the patient with no 
adverse events considered related to MAU868 or the infus ion.

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 1.4.1 Human Safety and Tolerability Data  
Single doses up to 100 mg/kg MAU868 were safe and well tolerated. Eleven (11) of 26 subjects 
exposed to MAU868  (42%) and one o f seven subjects exposed to placebo (14%) reported adverse 
events. Events occurring in mor e than one subject included nasal congestion (3), oropharyngeal 
pain (3), and injection site hemorrhage (2) - all in subjects who received MAU868.  
1.4.2 Human Pharmacokinet ic Data 
The time course of exposure to MAU868 following IV administration was consistent with that of 
a typical monoclonal IgG1 and therefore dose -proportional and predictable. The observed C28d 
("trough") concentrations of MAU868 (mean ± S D) were 4.9 ± 1. 4, 19.4 ± 5.0, 59.9 ± 11.0, 
171.3 ± 12.7 and 509.8 ± 145.9 ug/mL following adm inistration of 1, 3, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg 
doses, respectively. Consistent with predictions of population PK, these observed systemic 
exposures on Day 28 for all d oses of MAU868 w ere 50- to 5000-fold higher than the highest EC50 
of 0.093 ug/mL in vitro (versus BKV).  
1.4.3 Human Pharmacodynamic Data  
Administration of MAU868 increased the BKV neutralizing potency of the serum from 
participating subjects in a manner that was  proportional to  the dose. No increase was observed for 
the subjects who received placebo.  
1.5 Study Rationale  
The purpose of this study is to determine whether MAU868 warrants further clinical development 
for the treatment  of renal allograft threatening  BKV infection in kidn ey transplant recipients.  
1.6 Rationale for Dose and Schedule Selection  
In Cohort 1, MAU868 will be administered as an IV infusion of 1350 mg in 250 mL D5W over a 
period at least 60 minutes. In Cohort 2, MAU868 will be administered as an IV inf usion of 
6750 mg in 250 D5W over a period of at least 180 minutes on Study Day 1 and at 1350 m g in 
250 mL D5W over a period of at least 60 minutes for subsequent doses. In Cohort 3, MAU868 
will be administered as an IV infusion of 6750  mg in 250 mL D5W ove r a period of at least 
180 minutes. 
There are no rigorous clinical studies that identify targe t exposures required for BKV antiviral 
efficacy and no robust animal model of BKV infection or disease ; therefore, the most robust 
estimate of the clinical dose considers the fol lowing parameters 1) MAU868 BKV neutralizing 
activity in vitro, 2) simulation of serum concentrations based on a model created from Phase 1 data 
in healthy volunteers , and 3) p ublished literature on the extravascular distribution of 
immunoglobulin (renal 1 3.7%). For clinical efficacy, our therapeutic approach is  to maintain the 
Ctrough in target tissues ≥10 -fold the EC 50 of the least su sceptible BKV genotype (genotype III).  
A review of the information is as follows:

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 A high-content ima ging-based in vitro neutralization assay in RPTE cells was used to characterize 
the antiviral activity of MAU868 was determined against  representative isolates from the four 
major genotypes of BKV (genotypes I, II, III, and IV, respectively); genotypes I and IV account 
for approximately 95% of the global seroprevalence, while genotypes II and III account f or the 
remaining 5% ( Zheng et al 2007; Zhong et al 2009 ).  
Table 3. MAU868 In Vitro Neutralization Activity  
Genotype  EC50 (µg/mL) EC90 (µg/mL) 
BKV Genotype I  0.009 + 0.010 0.102 + 0.028 
BKV Genotype II  0.040 + 0.025 4.160 + 6.076 
BKV Genotype III  0.093 + 0.057 2.662 + 2.805 
BKV Genotype IV  0.020 + 0.020 0.465 + 0.318 
 
A first-in-human study explored single ascending doses o f MAU868 (1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg 
IV) and the serum concentration data was us ed to develop a PK model.  The model was then used 
to estimate C trough concentrations for a series of 3 treatment regimen s. To have a treatment  effect 
on BK viremia, MAU868 wo uld need to curtail BKV replication  in the target tissue (i.e., kidney). 
Based on  an in vivo radiolabeled study in animals and PBPK modeling estimates, the antibody 
biodistribution coefficient in kidney  is 13.7% ( Shah and Betts 201 3). The estimated trough levels 
for each treatment arm were compared directly to  in vitro-determined antiviral activity (EC 50 and 
EC90) for each BKV genotype and corrected for the assumed antibody dist ributions in kidney.  
These data show that the planned  dose regimens of MAU868 for each treatment arm provides high 
virus neutralizing tissue levels with kidney exposures at Ctrough ≥10-fold the EC 50 of the least 
susceptible BKV genotype (genotype III). Specifically, k idney exposures at Ctrough range from 
253 to 2618-fold (Cohort 1), 365  to 3775-fold (Cohort 2), and 1264 to 13,061 -fold (Cohort 3) 
above the EC 50 at the end of treatment (12 weeks , range = least to most susceptible BKV genotype). 
Using EC 90 determinations, k idney exposures at Ctrough range from 6 to 231-fold (Cohort 1), 
8 to 333-fold (Cohort 2), and 28 to 1152 -fold (Cohort 3)  above the EC 90 at the end of treatment.   
A 12-week treatment pe riod was selected to ensure sustained levels of MAU868 to inhibit virus 
replication and promote virus clearance . The subsequent 24-week follow-up period will allow 
evaluation  of the durability  of effect and additional safety  and PK observations . 
From a safety perspective, the highest administered dose of MAU868 expected in this study 
(6750 mg = 100 mg/kg for a 67.5 kg patient ) was also  the highest administered dose 
(MAU868  100 mg/kg) investigat ed in the first -in-human study and belo w the no observed adverse 
effect level (NOAEL) exposure (750 mg/kg) in the 4 -week repeat -dose toxicity study in rats. 
Specifically, huma n steady-state AUC exposure at the proposed dose of MAU868 1350 mg 
(20 mg/kg for a 67.5 kg patient) once monthly (206231  µg·hr/mL) provides safety margins of 6.9X 
and 5.0X, respectively, compared to the NOAEL (750 mg/kg; 1420000 µg·hr/mL) in the 4 -week 
rat study and to the AUC at the highest human dose (100 mg/kg; 1031155 µg·hr/mL) tes ted to 
date. Likewise, human steady -state AUC exposure at the proposed dose of MAU868 6750 mg 
once monthly (1031155 µg·hr/mL) provides a safety margin of 1.4X compared to the NOAEL 
(750 mg/kg; 1420000 µg·hr/mL) in the 4 -week rat study.

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 1.7 Rationale for Choice  of Comparator  and Background Therapy  
Placebo is the comparator because there are no therapies available for treating BKV reactivation 
following kidney transplantation.  
Induction and maintenance  immunosuppression is to be determined at the discretion of th e 
attending physician(s).  
1.8 Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits  
MAU868 may prevent progression of BKV infection to irreversible renal allograft injury. Since 
current mana gement of BKV reactivation involves reduction of immunosuppressive regimens 
(with accompanying increased ri sk for rejection), if MAU868 is effective in preventing BKV 
nephropathy in the post -kidney transplant setting, post -transplant care could be simplified with 
improved clinical outcomes.   
To date, n o MAU868 -specific risks have been  identified. The overall a dverse event profile from 
the first-in human study was quite satisfactory. Based on clinical data from pooled 
immunoglobulin preparations and a monoc lonal antibody active against respiratory syncytial 
virus, potential  risks of MAU 868 include infusion -related reactions, including allergic 
(e.g., hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis) and non -allergic (e.g., cytokine release syndrome) reactions, 
renal dysfunctio n, and thromboembolic events.  
The excipients and their respective concentrations  in the formulation of MAU 868 have been safely 
used in humans .  However, since this is the first study in which renal transplant recipients 
specifically will be exposed, there  may be unknown risks associated with either the excipients or 
the dosing of MAU8 68 that may be unanticipat ed and serious.  
Risks associated with participation in a clinical trial include risks associated with venipuncture and 
placement of intravenous cann ulas, including infection, erythema, and pain or tenderness at the 
site. The safe ty of MAU868 during pregna ncy has not been investigated and the potential risks of 
MAU868 during pregnancy are unknown. Women of child -bearing potential who may participate 
will be required to follow contraceptive measures to avoid becoming pregnant during  the study.  
Potential risk s to the study participants will be minimized by adherence to the eligibility criteria 
and protocol provisions, diligent clinical monitoring, and app ropriate management of participating 
subjects. In addition, the doses MAU868 used  in this study are well below doses of 
immunoglobulin typically associated with renal or thromboembolic risk.  
There are no specific or effective anti -BKV therapies. The risks of BKV reactivation and 
associated nephropathy in the post -renal transplant setti ng are potentially catastr ophic. Thus, there 
is a critical unmet need for  effective means to treat the consequences of BKV reactivation  in the 
post-transplant setting . MAU868 , a BKV-specific therapy , may be successful in treating clinically 
significant BKV  infection in those at ris k and, thus,  has the potential to greatly simplify post -
transplantation care and eliminate a threat to the survival of the renal allograft.

3 STUDY DESCRIPTION  
3.1 Summary of Study Design  
This is a randomize d, placebo -controlled, blinded, proof -of-concept study in kidney transplant 
recipients . Up to 36 subjects with BK viremia will participate in 1 of 3 sequential cohorts.  Each 
cohort will randomize approximately 12 subjects (8 MAU868 and 4 placebo). The study will 
consist of a Screening period (pre-treatment) of up to 10 days , a treatment period of 12 weeks and 
a follow-up period  of 24 weeks.  
Protocol specific procedures should  not be performed until the subject has consented to 
participation in the study.  However, assessments and procedures performed as part of standard of 
care prior to informed consent, including determination of BK viral load in plasma may be used to 
qualify a subject for the study.  Once qualifying BK viremia  has been confirmed, subjects should 
be randomized as soon as possible and no more than 10 days af ter the sample documenting the 
viremia was collected.   
MAU868 or placebo will be administered approximat ely every 28 days (every 4 weeks) for 
12 weeks (4 doses total).  Urine and blood will be monitored for BKV DNA by PCR weekly for 
the first 6 weeks afte r initiation of treatment. For the remainder of the treatment period, urine and 
blood must be collected f or BKV DNA by PCR at least every other week. PK, viral resistance and 
anti-drug antibodies will also be monitored.  However, the Investigator may also request testing 
more frequently (i.e., weekly) than mandated by the protocol after the first 4 weeks of t reatment 
when clinically indicated.  During the study, BKV DNA by PCR will be tes ted at the central 
laboratory.   Subjects should continue study drug until the last scheduled dose, regardless of 
changes in plasma BK viral load , use of rescue therapy  and/or need for change in 
immunosuppressive regimen for any reason.

Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 During the 24-week follow up period, 3 follow up visits will be scheduled  at 4, 8 and 24-weeks 
post-treatment .   At each visit, urine and blood samples for BKV DNA and samples for PK will be 
collected.  Investigators may collect samples for BKV DNA more often as clinically i ndicated. 
During the follow -up period, BKV DNA by PCR will be tested a t the central laboratory.   
Routine post -transplantation care is to be guided by the Investigator discret ion and site standard of 
care. This includes decisions to change the immunosuppre ssive regimen for a subject for any 
reason except for changes in immun osuppression in response to BK viremia . In order to treat BK 
viremia, prior to randomization, (ie, prior to screening, during the screening period and at the 
Baseline Visit) Investigator s are permitted to decrease or alter immunosuppressive therapy per 
their discretion and/or per standard of care at their site.   However, in the first 4 weeks after 
randomizat ion, Investigators should refrain from additional changes in im munosuppressive 
regimen in response to BKV unless the viral load has increased by >1 log and the Investigator 
determines that a change is in the best interest of the subject. Use of other antiv iral agents including 
cidofovir and leflunomide as well as IVIG  are not permitted  during the first 4 weeks of therapy 
and are strongly discouraged thereafter.  Use of fluoroquinolones for reasons other than treatment 
of BKV is permitted.   
Between screening  and the last visit, subjects will attend a total of 14 visits.

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 Progression from Cohort 1 to Cohort 2  
Approximately 12 weeks after the 9th subject in Cohort 1 has been randomized, blinded s afety data 
will be reviewed by the SSRC. Members of this commit tee will include a  Sponsor medical 
representative, the Medical Monitor and the study’s Principal Investigator.   Cohort 2 will be 
opened for screening once the following criteria have been met:  
1. All 12 subjects from Cohort 1 have been randomized,  
2. No significant safety issues related to the administration of MAU868 have been identified by 
the SSRC based the blinded safety review described above as well as an assessment of any 
new SAEs reported afte r the SSRC review and before randomization of the 12th subject in 
Cohort 1.  
3. No significant safety issues related to the administration of MAU868 have been identified by 
the independent DSMB.  
The Chair of the DSMB will be notified of the SSRC’s decision to open Cohort 2.  
Accordingly, some subjects enrolled in  Cohort 1 will continue pa rticipation in the study through 
the 24-week follow -up period while new subjects are screened and enrolled into Cohort 2.  
Progression from Cohort 2 to Cohort 3  
Cohort 3 will not be opened for screening and enrollment until an eva luation of unblinded safet y, 
efficacy and pharmacokinetics findings from both Cohorts 1 and 2 through the 12 -week treatment 
period has been completed by the Sponsor Study Review Committee SSRC.

Sponsor, would put the patient at unacceptable risk for participation in the study or would 
interfere with the assessme nts included in the study. 
3.3 Discontinuation Rules 
3.3.1 Study Stopping Rules 
The study may be discontinued or paused for reas ons that may include (but are not limited to): 
reasons of safety, lack of study drug availability , inability to enroll the study, or decision by a 
regulatory authority or the Sponsor (see Appendix D ). 
In the event that a dosing cohort shows efficacy and it is not anticipated that additional dosing 
would show added efficacy, the Sponsor may ch oose to stop and not complete the study.  
Further, in the instance of 2 or more treatment -related SAEs, 2 or more  treatment-related AEs 
Grade 3 or higher or 2 or more c linically significant treatment-related Grade 3 or higher laboratory 
abnormalities, the study will be pa used pending an SSRC review of the safety events. The Sponsor 
will inform the applicable regulatory authorities of any safety-related pause in the study.    
In the case that the study is discontinued, the Spons or will promptly inform  the Investigators and 
applicable regulatory authority( ies) of the termination of th e study and the reason(s) for the 
termination. The Investigators are responsible fo r promptly informing subjects that they must 
discontinue study drug. The Institutional Review  Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC) will also be informed promptly and provided the reason(s) for th e termination, as specified 
by the applicable regul atory requirement(s). 
3.3.2 Discontinuation from Study Drug 
Study drug dosing for an i ndividual subject must be discontin ued for any of th e following reasons: 
 The subject withdraws c onsent or requests discon tinuation for any reason. 
 Occurrence of any medical condition or circumstance that exposes the s ubject to substantial 
risk and/or does not allow the subject to a dhere to the requirements of the protocol. 
 Any SAE, clinically significan t adverse event, severe laborat ory abnormality, intercurrent 
illness, or other medical condition which indicat es to the Investigator or Sponsor that 
continued participation is not in the best interest of the subject. Specifically, study drug must be discontinued in subjects with development of a treatment-related SAE, a treatment-related 
AE Grade 3 or higher, or a clinically signi ficant treatment-related laboratory abnormality 
Grade 3 or higher.  
 Pregnancy during the study. 
 Subject failure to comply w ith protocol requirements or study-related procedures.

  Clinical Study Protocol MAU868-201 
Page 37 of 91 
Confidential & Proprietary 
Version 2.0, 15Apr2020  Subject experiences study drug related sympto ms that the Investigator determines are 
consistent with any of the following: 
o Anaphylaxis or severe allergic reaction.  
o An infusion reaction determined to be Grade 3 or higher based on Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5. 
o Cytokine release syndrome determined to be CTCAE version 5 Grade 2 or higher. 
o Serum sickness determined to be CT CAE version 5 Grade 2 or higher. 
Changes in plasma BK viral load, use of re scue therapy, and/or need for change in 
immune-suppressive regimen for any reason should not prompt early discontinuation of therapy. 
As long as the subject is tolera ting, study drug should be continued regardless of viremia (i.e., even 
if not responding). 
If a subject must be discontinued from study drug administration, the subject will still be 
encouraged to complete all follow-up visits an d assessments necessary for appropriate safety 
follow-up. Subjects who are found to be pregnant should continue to be monitored for safety 
following study treatment discontin uation and the outcome of the pregnancy should be reported. 
In the case of discontinua tion from study drug, subjec ts should be considered to have completed 
the treatment period and should complete the assessments required in the follow-up period 
(see Appendix A ).  Although the actual study days will vary between subjects and will not align 
with protocol-defined visit st udy days, time from last study dose remains the same (i.e., subjects 
will be seen approximately every 28 days for 2 follow up visits and then once again approximately 
24 weeks after the last study dose).  If the subject cannot be seen on the precise protocol-defined 
study day, the acceptable visit window is ±10 days. 
3.3.3 Discontinuation from Study Participation 
Study participation by an individual subject must  be prematurely discontinued for any of the 
following reasons: 
 The subject withdraws c onsent or requests discon tinuation for any reason. 
 Occurrence of any medical condition or circumstance that exposes the s ubject to substantial 
risk and/or does not allow the subject to a dhere to the requirements of the protocol. 
 Any SAE, clinically significan t adverse event, severe laborat ory abnormality, intercurrent 
illness, or other medical condition which indicat es to the Investigator or Sponsor that 
continued participation is not in th e best interest of the subject. 
 Subject failure to comply w ith protocol requirements or study-related procedures.

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 If a subject withdraws prematurely from the study, study staff should make every effort to contact 
the Sponsor prior to discontinuation, if possible, and to complete the full panel of assessments 
scheduled for th e Early Termination Visit. The reaso n for subject withdrawal must be documented 
in the electronic Case Report Form  (CRF).  
In the case of subjects lost to follow -up, attempts to contact the subject must be made and 
documented in the subject’s medical recor ds.  
The SSRC may recommend enrollin g more than 12 subjects into a cohort (Cohort 1, 2, and/or 3)  
to allow adequate data collection for assessment of cohort progression and/or study objectives . 
Expansion of a given cohort , if needed, will not affect the si ze of subsequent cohort (s). 
3.4 Early Termination Visit and Withdrawal Procedures  
For subjects who are withdrawn from the study prior to completion of the study, the subject should 
return for an Early Termination Visit . The reason for subject withdrawal from t he study must be 
documented in the eCRF.  
4 TREATMENTS  ARMS 
The following treatment arms and dosing regimens are planned.  
4.1 Treatment Groups  
Subjects entering Cohort  1will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms in a ratio of 2:1 
(MAU868:placebo) : 
• MAU868 1350 mg every 28 days f or a total of 4 doses 
• Placebo every 28 days for a total of 4 doses.   
Subjects entering Cohort  2 will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms in a ratio of 2:1 
(MAU868:placebo) : 
• MAU868 6750 once and 1350 mg every 28 days for a total of 4 doses 
• Placebo every 28 days for a total of 4 doses.   
Subjects entering Cohort  3 will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms in a ratio of 2:1 
(MAU868:placebo) : 
• MAU868 6750 mg every 28 days for a total of 4 doses 
• Placebo every 28 days for a total of 4 doses.   
Minimum duration of the infusion for 6750 mg is at least 180 minutes and for 1350  mg is at least 
60 minutes. All infusions will be followed by at least a 25 mL D5W flush to run at the same 
infusion rate as th e dose of study drug .

  Clinical Study Protocol MAU868 -201 
Page 39 of 91 
Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 A Pharmacy Manual will provide instructions for preparation of t he infusion. The  study drug  is 
prepared as a dilution of the 450 mg/3mL stock solution in a total volume of 250  mL D5W. 
The investigational product is to be stored at 2° to 8° Celsius, protected from light and not s haken.  
4.2 Randomization  
Study participants will be randomly assigned to their treatments. Two participants will be assigned 
to receive treatment with MAU868 for each participant assigned to receive treatment with placebo 
(2:1 randomization ). Randomization wi ll occur via an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). 
The Investigator or delegate will contact the IWRS after confirming that a potential study 
participant is e ligible. The  IWRS will assign a randomization number that will be used to link the 
subject to  a treatment arm.  
The randomization numb er is only used to identify which treatment study participants have been 
assigned to receive. The number assigned to a sub ject at screening remains the unique identifier 
for the subject throughout the study. For information on subject numbering, please see “Subject 
numbering ” section in the IWRS manual.  The randomization numbers will be generated using 
procedures that ensure  that treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from the Sponsor, 
subjects, and Investigator staff. A  subject randomization list will be produced by a CRO.  
The randomization  scheme for subjects will be reviewed and approved by the Sponsor. 
Follow the details outlined in the IWRS Manual  regarding the process and timing of treatment 
assignment and randomization of subjects.  
4.3 Treatment Arm Blinding 
This is a subject, Investigator , and Sponsor-blinded study. Subjects and Investigators will remain 
blinded to study  treatment arm (MAU868 or pla cebo) throughout the study . 
Drug product will be supplied in bulk, so an unblinded pharmacist, or a ppropriately designated 
study site staff who is independent of the study team , will be required in order to maintain the 
blind. This unblinded associate at the site will be notified by the IWRS that a subject is ran domized 
and to which treatment arm, which  will then enable and instruct them to prepare the study drug.  
4.3.1 Breaking the Treatment Blind 
Blinding is critical to the integrity of this clinical study. However, in the event of a  medical 
emergency or pregnancy in  an individual subject, in which knowledge  of the investigational 
product is critical to the subject’s management,  the Investigator should contact the Medical 
Monitor to review the situation prior to breaking the blind.  
Before breaking the blind of an indi vidual subject’s treatment, the Investigator should  have 
determined that the information is necessary  (i.e., that it will alter the subject’s immediate 
management ). In many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not  investigational 
product relat ed, the problem may be properly managed by  assuming that  the subject is receiving 
active product withou t the need for unblinding.

  Clinical Study Protocol MAU868 -201 
Page 40 of 91 
Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 When the Investigator contacts the system to break a treatment code for a subject, he/she must 
provide the requested subject i dentifying information and confirm the nec essity to break the 
treatment code for the subject. The Investigator will then receive details of the investigational drug 
treatment for the specified subject  via the IWRS.  The system will automatically inform the study 
monitor for the site and the Study T eam that the code has been broken.  
It is the Investigator’s r esponsibility to ensure that there is a dependable procedure in place to 
allow access to the IWRS /code break at any time in case of emergency.  
An assessment will be done by the appropriate site  personnel and Sponsor after an emergency 
unblinding to assess whether or not study drug should be discontinued for a given subject.  
In cases of accidental unblinding, contact the Medical Monitor and ensure  every attempt to 
preserve the blind is made.

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 For subjects who may requir e a hemodialysis , plasmaph eresis, or immunoadsorption treatment, 
it shall be assumed that th e study drug has been removed. A blood sam ple for PK analysis should 
be collected prior to and following these treatments. In the event that a subject requires 
hemodialysis, plasmapheresis, or immunoadsorption treatments; if <15 days since last 
MAU868/plac ebo treatment another  dose will be given as soon as possible,  and the next scheduled 
monthly dose skipped. Regular dosing will occur the following month. If the last dose was 15 days 
or greater no interim dose will be administered,  and the regular monthly schedule will be foll owed. 
No subject will  receive more than 4 doses.  Subjects anticipated to require hemodialysis, 
plasmapheresis or immunoadsorption treatment  at the time of randomization should not be 
randomized ( Exclusion Criterion 5). 
5.3.2 Study Drug  Complian ce 
All study drug will be administered at the clinical center, by qualified site staff, under the 
supervision of the Investigator or qualified designee. Any interruption to the IV infusion or 
changes to the infusio n rate and duration must be recorded in th e source documents and in the 
eCRF. 
All study drug must be recorded in the Drug Accountability Log.  
5.4 Storage and Accoun tability 
The recommended storage condition of the drug product is 2 -8°C, protected from light. T he drug 
product should not be shaken or frozen. Details on the requirements for storage and management 
of study drug, and instructions to be followed for subject numbering, prescribing/dispensing and 
administering the  study drug are outlined in the Pharmacy Manual . 
6 PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT MEDICATION S AND/OR PROCEDURES  
6.1 Excluded Medications and/or Procedures  
The following medications are excluded from use during this study  and patients anticipated to 
require these interventions should not be included : 
• Systemic mTOR inhibitors (e.g., rapamycin, sirolimu s, everolimus, temsirolimus, etc.)  
• IVIG 
• antibody-depleting therapies (e.g., hemodialysis, plasmapheresis, immunoadsorption, etc.)  
• any other investigational drug  
If, after randomization, it is determined that the se therapies are essential for the subject’s health 
and well-being and cannot be delayed until study completion, the subject should not be 
discontinued from study medication or  the study  due to receipt of these medications .  
See Section 5.3.1 and the Schedule of Events ( Appendix A) for more information regarding dosing 
and PK collection in the event a subject requires hemodialysis, plasmapheresis, or 
immunoadsorption treatments .

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 6.2 Rescue Me dication 
In order to treat BK v iremia, prior to randomization, (ie, prior to screening, during the screening 
period and at the Baseline Visit ), Investigators  are permitted to decrease or alter 
immunosuppressive therapy per their discretion and/or per standard of care at their site .   However, 
in the first 4 weeks after randomization, Investigators should refrain from additional changes in 
immunosuppressive regimen  in response to BKV  unless the viral load has increased by >1 log and 
the Investigator determin es that a change is in the best interest of  the patient .   
Additional rescue medication including cidofovir, leflunomide and IVIG is strongly discouraged.  
However, if 4 weeks after randomization, the Investigator feels the subject is failing study drug 
and the subject is at signifi cant risk of gra ft damage , and that additional medications are required 
for the subject’s care , the Investigator may add additional therapies at their discretion.   
Regardless of  the use of rescue medication (changes in immunosup pressive regiment or additi on 
of anti-viral medication) , all subjects should complete study infusion(s) as long as they are 
tolerating the study drug .    
6.3 Documentation of Prior and Concomitant Medication Use  
The Investigator must instruct the subject to n otify the study site about any new medicati ons he/she 
takes after the subject was enrolled into the study.  
All prescription medications ; including over-the-counter drugs and significant non -drug therapies 
(including blood transfusions) received by the subject within 10  days prior to the initial do se of 
study drug administration and any concomitant medications used through the Follow -Up Visit will 
be recorded in the source documents and on the appropriate eCRF.  In addition, all 
immunosuppressive  therapy rec eived since ki dney transplant ation (including the induction 
regimen) will be recorded.  
6.4 Infusion Reactions  
Although not previously reported following administration of MAU868, infusion  reactions and 
infusion associated symptoms  may occur following infus ion of a monoc lonal antibody due to 
sensitization due to the antibody or to the excipients in the infusion materials.  
Symptoms indicative of anaphylaxis, or (based on CTCAE version 5 classification) Grade 3 or 
higher infusion reaction, Grade 2 or higher cy tokine release syndrome , or Grade 2 or higher  serum 
sickness should result in immediate halting of the infusion and prompt initiation of appropriate 
therapy.  Subjects should not be re -challenged with study drug.  Study drug should be permanently 
discontinued, but the patient should remain in the stu dy for continued follow -up. Milder symptoms 
that do not meet criteria for immediate discontinuation from study drug may be managed by drug 
interruption and symptom management. The infusion should be temporarily stopped and the 
subject assessed.  Diphenhydr amine 50 mg and acetaminophen 650 mg should be administered. 
Ifsymptoms  improve after  30-60 minutes, the subject may be re -challenged with a reduced infusion 
rate of approximately 50% the initial rate.   Medica tion(s) to treat gastrointestinal symptoms may  
also be given if needed.  If the subject tolerates a re -challenge, they should receive pre -medication

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 with diphenhydramine 50 mg and acetaminophen 650 mg administered approximately 
30-60 minutes prior to start  of the next scheduled infusion.  Subsequent i nfusions should be 
administered at a slower rate.  For subsequent infusions of 1350 mg, study drug should be 
administered over approximately 120 minutes (2 hours).  For subsequent infusions of 6750 mg, 
study drug should be administered over approximately 2 40 minutes (4 hours).   
It is expected that the clinical site will have adequate facilities at the location of the study drug 
infusions to effectively manage and treat infusion reactions  promptly. 
7 STUDY PROCEDU RES 
7.1 Informed Consent  
Eligible subjects may onl y be included in the study after providing written (witnessed, where 
required by law or regulation), IRB/IEC -approved informed consent.  
Informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study -specific pr ocedures (i.e., all of 
the procedures describe d in the protocol). However, assessments  or procedures performed as 
standard of care may be used for the purposes of screening. The process of obtaining informed 
consent must be documented in the subject source  documents. 
Information about common side effe cts already known about the investigational drug can be found 
in the Investigator's Brochure (IB). This information will be included in the subject informed 
consent and should be discussed with the subject duri ng the study as needed. Any new information 
regarding the safety profile of the investigational drug that is identified between IB updates will 
be communicated as appropriate. New information might require an update to the informed 
consent and then must be  discussed with the subject.  
Once the subject has signed the informed consent, the subject may enter the Screening Period of 
the study.  
7.2 Screening Period  
Subjects who have had their renal transplant within the previous year may be considered for 
participati on and entrance into the Screening Period foll owing signing of the consent. S ubjects 
may, enter the Screening Period (pre -treatment period) of up to 10 days following signing of the 
consent. If a subject does not meet all criteria within the 10 -day window they will be considered a 
screen failure.  
No study-specific procedures or activities may be performed until the informed consent process 
has been completed and the subject has signed the Informed Consent Form.  However, assessments 
or procedures performed a s standard of care may be used for the purpose s of screening. Once a 
subject has signed the Informed Consent Form for study participation, the subject enters the 
Screening Period.  
See Section 8, Study Procedures and Assessments .

Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 During the Screening Period, the following ac tivities will be performed:  
• Review of Inclusion Criteria ( Section 3.2.1) and Exclusion Criteria ( Section 3.2.2). 
• Review and record medical and surgical hi story and current m edical conditions . 
• Review and record concomitant medications (see Section 6.1 Excluded Medications and/or 
Procedures, for a list of prohibited medications) . 
• Review and record subject demography . 
• Review and record Kidney  Donor Profile Index (KDPI) . 
• Perform urine or serum pregnancy test on women of childbearing potential only.  Note: either 
serum or urine must be documented as negative within 96 hours prior to Baseline.    
• Record vital signs, including temperature , blood pr essure, heart rate, respiratory rate , oxygen 
saturation  and height and weight . 
• Perform p hysical examination . 
• Review of local  and/or central  plasma BKV PCR results 
• Review of Adverse Events after informed consent is signed.  
If the subject meets all  inclusion and has no exclusion criteria  during the Screening Period, 
the subject may enter the randomization  portion of the study.  
7.3 Treatment Period (Day 1 to Day 84) 
If the subject meets all inclusion and exclusion criteria, the subject may then be rando mized to 
receive either MAU868  or placebo. Ran domization should occur as soon as possible, but not 
longer than 10 calendar days, after the local qualifying sample was collected.  
Subjects will be randomized to study drug  in the ratio of 2 :1 (MAU868 : placebo). 
During the treatment period, subjects will  receive MAU868 or placebo approximately every 
28 days (every 4 weeks) for 12 weeks (4 doses total).  Urine and blood will be monitored for BKV 
DNA weekly by PCR for the first 6 weeks of treatment and the n every other week until completion 
of treatment  and at each follow up visit .  During this time, BKV DNA by PCR will be tested at the 
central laboratory.   
During the treatment period, subjects should be seen approximately every 7 days (+/- 3 days) 
during the first 6 weeks and approximately every 14 days (+/-5 days) for the duration of treatment. 
Subjects may be seen more often at the Investigator’s discretion.  Visit dates are determined from 
the Baseline Visit. 
NOTE: 
• After the first 4 weeks of treatment, the In vestigator may request BK viral load (urine and  
blood) testing more frequently (e.g., weekly) than mandated by the protocol, if clinically 
indicated.

8 STUDY PROCEDURES AND ASSESSMENTS  
8.1 Schedule of Events  
Subjects should be seen for  all visits/assessments as outli ned in the assessment schedule or as close 
to the designated day/time as possible.  
Missed, late, or rescheduled visits should not lead to automatic discontinuation  from the study .  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug should remain in the study.   In the case of 
premature discontinuation from st udy drug, subjects should be considered to have completed the 
treatment period and should complete the assessments required in the follow -up period 
(see Appendix A).  Although the actual study days will vary between subjects and will not align 
with protocol -defined visit study days, time from last study dose remains the same (i.e., subjects 
will be seen approximately every 28 days for 2  follow up visits a nd then once again approximately 
24 weeks after the last of study dose received).  If the subject cannot be seen on the precise 
protocol-defined study day, the acceptable visit window is ±10 days. 
Subjects who prematurely discontinue the  study for any reason should be scheduled for a  final study  
visit as soon as possible, at which time all of the assessments listed for the Early Termination Visit  will 
be performed. At  this final visit, all investiga tional product should be reconciled, and  the adverse event 
and concomita nt medications recorded on the eCRF and the reason for discontinuation of study 
documented.  (See Appendix A, Schedule of Events) .

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 8.2 Subject Demographics/ Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and other baseline c haracteristics will be collected for all subjects. Relevant medical 
and surgical history, including the primary cause of end -stage renal disease and other past or 
ongoing conditions, shall be recorded. Investigators have the  discretion to determine the rel evance 
of the medical and surgical history for individual subjects.  
The Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) will be recorded for all subjects who receive a kidney 
from a deceased donor. The information necessary for determini ng the KDPI includes donor age, 
height, weight, ethnicity, history of hypertension, history of diabetes mellitus, cause of death, 
serum creatinine, hepatitis C serostatus, and whether donation occurred after circulatory death.  
More specific instructions a nd details regarding the baselin e characteristics of subjects are outlined 
in the eCRF completion guidelines . 
8.3 Efficacy / Pharmacodynamics  
The efficacy of MAU868 in treating BK viremia will be measured primarily by measuring the 
viral load in the plasma ove r time. 
Samples (plasma or urine ) will be collected for viral load assessment at the time points defined in 
the Assessment schedule . (See Appendix A, Schedule of Events.)  
Follow instructions outlined in the Laboratory Manual  regarding sample colle ction, numbering, 
processing and shipment. A centralized, validated quantitative PCR (qPCR) as say, targeting 
multiple conserved regions of the viral genome, will be utilized for quantification of BKV viral 
load. These result s of each subject’s testing will  be reported to the Investigator. It is recommended 
that these results be used by the Investig ator in the management of the subject during their 
participation in the study. The presence of MAU868 is not expected to affect th e results of the 
qPCR BKV viral load assay because viral nucleic acid will first be isolated from the sample for 
quantitation,  removing all antibodies and virus/host proteins. A detailed Virology Analysis Plan 
will be prepared separately.  
8.4 Clinical Outcome Assessments (COAs)  
Several clini cal outcome assessments will be evaluated . These include :  
• Graft function  as measured by eGFR  using the CK -EPI equation , 
• Graft survival  as determined by presence of a functioning graft that has not required a 
re-transplant or permanent renal replacement th erapy, 
• Subject survival ,   
• Graft rejection  based on kidney biopsy results and 2017 Banff Kidney Meeting Repor t,

results will be recorded in the eCRF.  The assessments are i ncorporated into  endpoints 
analyzed for efficacy. See Section 10.5, Efficacy Analysis. 
8.5 Safety 
Safety assessments are specified below . 
8.5.1 Pregnancy  
Pregnancy tests (urine or serum) of β -hCG are required of all female  study participants of 
childbearing  potential within 96 hours prior to Study Day 1. In addition, urine  or serum pregnancy 
testing for all fem ales of childbearing potential will  be performed before infusions #2 on Day 28, 
#3 on Day 56 and #4 on Day 84.  
8.5.2 Physical Examination  
Information from physical examinations will be kept at the clinical site as source d ata and will not 
be transferred to the Sponsor as part of the study analysis (i.e., recorded in the eCRF) unless 
findings are related to an adverse event or are otherwise significant (and so are reported as an 
adverse event  or medical history ). 
The eCRF manual  provides more details . 
8.5.3 Vital Signs 
Vital signs  will include temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen 
saturation . 
8.5.4 Laboratory Evaluations  
Clinically relevant deviations of laboratory test res ults occurring during or at completion o f the 
study should be evaluated for criteria defining an adverse event and reported as such if the criteria 
are met. See Section 9, Safety Assessments.  
Screening laboratory assessments to determine eligibility should be performed at the local 
laboratory and may be collected as standard of care within 10 days prior to Study Day 1 (Baseline) . 
Laboratory assessments collected after Screening will be sent to the central laboratory for analysis.  
Clinical laboratory assessments (serum  chemistry, hematology [includin g CBC with differential], 
and urinalysis) will occur at Screening , and on Days 1  (Baseline) , 14, 28, 56, 84, 112, 140 and 
252. These assessments will also occur at the Early Termination  Visit (if applicable).

identified, clinical laboratory assessments may be conducted at any time during the study and 
compared to Baseline. See Appendix B for a complete list of clinical laboratory analytes.  
8.5.5 Electrocardiogram  
Standard 12 -lead electrocardiograms ( ECGs) will be performed in a supine position. Interpretation 
of the tracing must be made by a qualified  physician and documented on the ECG / in the ECG 
section of the eCRF. Original ECG tracings, appropriately signed, will be archived at the study 
site. 
8.5.6 Pharmacokinetics  
PK samples will be collected at the timepoints defin ed in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix A). 
Follow instructions outlined in the Laboratory Manual. regarding sample collection, numbering, 
processing and shipment. See Section 8.3, Use of Residual Biological S amples. 
MAU868  levels in serum will be determined by a validated ELISA -based method. A detailed 
description of the method used will be included in the PK bioanalytical data report.  
Actual time of dosing and actual times of blood collecti on will be recorded on the  PK blood 
collection eCRF page. For a detailed description of blood sampling, handling, labeling and 
shipment instructions please refer to the Laboratory Manual.  
PK samples obtained after study drug infusion should be collected f rom a vein opposite the ar m 
into which the study drug  was infus ed.  
Results of PK samples will not be reported to the site. These samples will be analyzed , and the 
results reported by centralized  third-party specialty labs.  
8.5.7 BKV by PCR Sample Collection 
Plasma and urine for BKV by PCR samples will be collected at the timepoints defined in the 
Schedule of Events ( Appendix A). Follow the instructions outlined in the Laboratory  Manual, 
regarding sample collection, numbering, processing and shipment.  
8.5.8 Other Assessments : Viral Resistance and Immunogenicity  
To monitor for the possible development of resistance -associated variants (RAVs) to MAU 868, 
the BKV VP1 coding region will be sequenced and translated to the correspondi ng amino acid 
sequence. The VP1 amino acid sequences from subjects will be aligned to their corresponding 
baseline sequences (derived from BKV detected in the urine at  Baseline) and reference isolate 
sequences to determine if any change from -baseline or ch ange-from-reference RAVs are pre sent. 
The susceptibility of RAVs to MAU868 will be determined by cloning the subject  derived VP1 
gene into a BKV reference isolate vector, gen erating a chimeric virus for MAU868 phenotypic 
assessment. The EC50 and EC90 value s and fold change from baseline and reference values will 
be reported. If the resulting chimeric virus does not replicate, the individual RAV(s) may be 
engineered directly in to the BKV reference isolate vector through site -directed mutagenesis and

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 assessed for susceptibility to neutraliz ation by MAU868. The emergence of RAV(s) conferring 
reduced susceptibility will be correlated to the MAU868 exposure. For subjects with confir med 
RAV(s) displaying reduced MAU868 susceptibility, the persistence of the RAV(s)  will be 
monitored for at least 6 months following the end of MAU868 therapy by periodic BKV 
sequencing provided the virus remains detectable in either the blood or the urine . To date, no 
epitope-mutant BK viruses with both a significant loss of susceptibi lity to MAU868 and a 
preservatio n of replicative fitness have been identified.  
Details of viral resistance monitoring and detection will be described in the Virology Analysis  
Plan. 
Immunogenicity will be evaluated using a  validated ligand binding assay (EL ISA or MSD) for the 
detection of  potential anti -MAU868 antibodies.  
The detailed methods for immunogenicity assessment will be described in the Bioanalytical Data 
Report. 
Results of the viral resistance and immunogenicity  samples will not be reported to th e site. These 
samples will be an alyzed, and the results reported by centralized  third-party specialty labs.  
8.6 Other Samples 
8.6.1 Use of Residual Biological Samples  
Any residual blood or urine samples remaining  at the central laboratories  after the protocol -defined 
analyses have been performed may be used for additional exploratory analyses  and will be 
completed within 5 years after the protocol defined analyses are r eported.  These exploratory 
analyses may include, but are not necessarily limited to, investigatio ns of other biomarkers related 
to kidney disease or kidney function, other immunologic markers, other viral RNA or DNA, 
protein binding, metabolite profiling,  biomarkers of transporters or metabolic enzyme activity 
(such as 4 -beta-hydroxycholesterol levels ) or other bioanalytical purpose s (e.g., investigations 
related to individual infusion reactions or other adverse events). Given the exploratory nature of 
the work, the analytical methods used for these investigations may not be validated. The results 
from these exploratory analyses, if pursued, will not be included in the clinical study report.  
9 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
9.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharm aceutical product, which does no t necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore b e any unfavorable and/or 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated wit h the use of study drug , whether or not related to the study drug . All adverse events, 
including observed or volunteered probl ems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF.

  Clinical Study Protocol MAU868 -201 
Page 59 of 91 
Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 Adverse events, which include clinical laboratory test v ariables, will be monitored and 
documented from the time the subject signs consent  through the Follow Up Visit. Subjects should 
be instructed to report any adverse event that they experience to the Investigator, whether or not 
they think the event is due t o study drug. Beginning at Scree ning (following completion of an 
Informed Consent Form by the subject), Investigators should m ake an assessment for adverse 
events at each visit and record the event on the appropriate adverse event eCRF.  
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome r ather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by the Investigator a nd recorded on the eCRF. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease o r 
syndrome by the Investigator, it should be recorded as a separate adverse event on the eCRF. 
Additionally, the condition tha t led to a medical or surgical procedure (e .g., surgery, endoscopy, 
tooth extraction, or transfusion) should be recorded as an adv erse event, not the procedure it self.  
Any medical condition already present at consent should be recorded as medical history and not 
be reported as an adverse event unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at 
Baseline changes in severity,  frequency, or seriousness at an y time during the study. In this case, 
it should be reported as an adverse event.  
Subjects who  develop treatment-related SAEs, treatment-related Grade 3 or higher AEs, or 
clinically significant  treatment-related Grade 3 or  higher laboratory  abnormalities  should be 
followed until resolution  of the AE or laboratory  abnormality,  or, if the AE or laboratory  
abnormality  was present at  baseline, until the value returns to baseline level. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory o r other examination (e .g., ECG) findings that are 
detected during the study or are present at initial d osing and significantly worsen during the study 
should be reported as adverse events, as described below. The Investigator will exercise his or her 
medical and scientific judgment in de ciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other 
abnormal assessm ent is clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values 
occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or 
are no longer clinically significant. Abnormal test results that are de termined to be an error should 
not be reported as an adverse event. Laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal clinical findings 
(e.g., ECG abnormalities ) should be reported as an adver se event if any of the following are 
applicable:  
• If an intervention is required as a result of the abnormality  
• If action taken with the study drug is required as a result of the abnormality  
• Based on the clinical judgment of the Investigator  
9.1.1 Adverse (Drug)  Reaction  
All noxious and unintended responses to a study drug related to any dose should be considered an 
adverse drug reaction. “Responses” to a study drug means that a causal relationship between a 
study drug  and an adver se event is at least a reasonabl e possibility, i .e., the relationship cannot be 
ruled out.

Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 9.1.2 Unexpected A dverse Drug Reaction  
An Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of 
which is not consistent with the ap plicable product information. Fo r MAU868 the reference safety 
information is included in the IB current ly in force. The reference safety information will be 
reviewed yearly, and the periodicity of the review will be harmonized with the reporting period of 
the Development Safety Update Re port. 
9.1.3 Assessment of Adverse Events by the Investigator  
The Investigator  will assess the severity (intensity) of each adverse event and will also categorize 
each adverse event as to its potential relationship to study drug us ing the categories of “yes” or 
“no.” 
Assessment of Severity  
The severity of all adverse events should b e graded according to the CTCAE v5.0. For those 
adverse event terms not listed in the CTCAE, the following grading system should be used:  
• CTCAE Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild sympt oms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicat ed 
• CTCAE Grade 2: Moderate; minimal local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  
• CTCAE G rade 3: Severe or medically sign ificant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolon gation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care 
activities of daily living  
• CTCAE Grade 4: Life threatening consequences; urgent interv ention indicated  
CTCAE Grade 5: Death related to the adverse event  
Causality Assessment  
The relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug  is to be assessed 
according to the following definitions:  
No (not related, unlikely to be r elated) – The time course betwee n the administration of study drug 
and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event rules out a causal relationship and another 
cause (concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, etc) is suspected.  
Yes (possibly, probab ly, or definitely related)  – The time course between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal 
relationship and no other cause (concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, etc) can be  
identified. 
The definition impl ies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  
  Amplyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
  Clinical Study Protocol MAU868-201 
Page 61 of 91 
Confidential & Proprietary 
Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 The following factors should also be considered: 
 The temporal sequence from study drug administration 
The event should occur after the study drug is  given. The length of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be  evaluated in the clinical  context of the event. 
 Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases 
Each report should be evaluated in the context of  the natural history and course of the disease 
being treated and any other di sease the subject may have. 
 Concomitant drug 
The other drugs the subject is taking or the tr eatment the subject recei ves should be examined 
to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in question. 
 Known response pattern for th is class of study drug.  
Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate wh ether a particular respon se is likely to be a 
class effect. 
 Exposure to physical an d/or mental stresses 
The exposure to stress might i nduce adverse changes in the r ecipient and provide a logical 
and better explanation for the event. 
 The pharmacology and PK of the study drug.  
The known pharmacologic propertie s (absorption, distri bution, metabolism, an d excretion) of 
the study drug should be considered. 
9.1.4  AEs of Special Interest 
For subjects experiencing infusion -associated AEs, the Investigator, or designee, is responsible for 
determining if immediate discontinua tion of study thera py is required (see Section 3.3.2 ).  
In addition, for all cases of AEs associated with study infusion that occur during or within 2 hours 
after the completion of infusion require enhanced reporting using the specif ied Infusion-associated 
AE Report eCRF, regardless of whether drug discontinuation cr iteria are met. 
Note:  All treatment-related AEs of grade 3 or  higher and treatment-rel ated AEs of cytokine 
release syndrome and serum sickness of grate 2 or higher require discontinuation from study 
drug (see Section 3.3.2 ). 
9.2 Serious Adverse Events 
An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered se rious if, in the view of either the Investigator 
or Sponsor, it results in a ny of the following outcomes: 
 Death. 
  Amplyx Pharmace uticals, Inc.  
  Clinical Study Protocol MAU868 -201 
Page 62 of 91 
Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 • A life-threatening adverse event. 
Note: An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in view of 
either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. 
It does not include an event that, had it occurr ed in a more severe form, might have caused 
death. 
• Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalizations.  
Note: Any hospital admission with at least one overnight stay will be considered an inpatient 
hospitalization. An emergency room or ur gent care visit without hospital admission will not 
be recorded as a SAE under this criterion, nor will hospitalization for a procedure scheduled 
or planned before signing of informed consent, or elective treatment of a pre -existing 
condition that did not worsen from Baseline. However, unexpected complications and/or 
prolongation of hospitalization that occur during elective surgery should be recorded as 
adverse events and assessed for seriousness. Admission to the hospital for social or situational 
reasons (i.e., no place to stay, live too far away to come for hospital visits, respite care) will 
not be considered inpatient hospitalizations.  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life fun ctions. 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• An important medical event.  
Note: Important medical events that do not meet any of the above criteria may be considered 
an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalizations, or the development of drug dependency.  
Note:  All treatment related  SAEs require discontinuation from study drug (see Section 3.3.2) 
9.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting − Procedures for Investigators  
9.3.1 Initial Reports  
All SAEs occu rring from the time of initial dosing until the Follow Up Visit must be reported to 
Medpace Clinical Safety within 24 hours of the knowledge of the occurrence (After the Follow 
Up Visit, any SAE that the Investigator considers relat ed to study  drug must be  reported to the 
Medpace Clinical Safety or the Sponsor/designee).  
To report the SAE, complete the SAE form electronically in the electronic data capture (EDC) 
system for the study. When the form is completed, Medpace Safety personn el will be notified 
electronically by the EDC system and will retrieve the form. If the event meets serious criteria and 
it is not possible to access the EDC system, send an email to Medpace Safety at Medpace 
safetynotification@medpace.com   or call the Med pace SAE re porting line (phone number listed

9.3.2 Follow-up Reports  
The Investigator must continue to follow the subject until the SAE has subsided or until the 
condition becomes chr onic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent  impairment), or the subject 
dies. 
Within 24 hours of receipt of follow -up information, the Investigator must update the SAE form 
electronically in the EDC system for the study and submit any supporting documentation 
(eg, patient discharge summary or autop sy reports) to Medpace C linical Safety via fax or email. 
If it is not possible to access the EDC system, refer to the procedures outlined above for initial 
reporting of SAEs.  
9.4 Pregnancy Reporting  
If a subject becomes pregnant during the  treatment period , the Investigator is to st op dosing with 
study drug immediately .  
A pregnancy is not considered to be an adverse event or SAE; however, it must be reported to 
Medpace Clinical Safety within 24 hours of kno wledge of the event. Medpace Clinical Safety will 
then provide the Investigat or/site the Exposure In Utero (EIU) form for completion. 
The Investigator/site must complete the EIU form and fax/email it back to Medpace Clinical 
Safety.  
If the female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant while the subject is receiving study drug  
or within the safety follow -up period defined in the protocol, the Investigator should notify 
Medpace Clinical Safety as described above.  
The pregnancy should be followed until t he outcome of the pregnancy, whenever possible. Once 
the outcome of the pregn ancy is known, the EIU form should be completed and faxed/emailed to 
Medpace Clinical Safety. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate 
classification as an  SAE (i.e., postpartum complication, spontaneous abor tion, stillbirth, neonat al 
death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE.

Efficacy Analyses  
In all efficacy analyses, the placebo subjects from the cohorts will be combined.   Thus, the analy sis 
models will include t reatment group (four levels: placebo, low dose, medium dose, high dose) as 
a factor. Time -to-event endpoints will be analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression 
models.  Proportion endpoints will be analyzed using logistic r egression models. Quantitative 
endpoints will be analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) models .  In all analyses, 
pairwise contrasts comparing e ach of the three active groups to the combined placebo group will 
be tested.   All efficacy analyses will be conducted using two-sided tests at the alpha=0.05 level of 
significance, with no adjustment for multiplicity.

summarized des criptively.  Details of the data and process for the interim analyses will be described 
in the Stati stical Analysis Plan and SSRC Charter. 
Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses will be performed on data from the Safety Analysis Population. Adverse events 
(AEs), vital signs, ECGs and clinical laboratory evaluations will be summarized by appropriate 
descriptive statistics.  
Pharmaco kinetic Analysis  
MAU868 levels  in serum will be determined by a validated ELISA -based method. A  detailed 
description of the method used will be included in the PK bioanalytical data report. The  anticipated 
LLOQ is 50.0  ng/mL. Conce ntrations will be express ed in mass per volume units (e .g., ng/mL). 
Missing values or those concentrations below the LLOQ will be labeled as such in the data listings 
and reported as “zero” in data presentations and calculations.  
MAU868 serum concentration  data will be listed by subject and visit/sampling time  point. 
Descriptive summary statistics of trough levels will be provided by visit/sampling time point, 
including the frequency (n, %) of concentrations below the LLOQ and reported as zero. Summary 
statistics will include mean (arithmetic and geometric), SD , CV (arithmetic and geometric), 
median, minimum and maximum. Concentrations below LLOQ will be treated as zero in summary 
statistics.  
10.6 Disposition , Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Enrollment  and randomization, proto col deviations, disposition an d demographic data will be 
summarized and listed by treatment group Continuous variables will be summarized by treatment 
group and combined using traditional statistics such as number of subjects, mean , median, standard 
deviation, minimum  and maximum. Cate gorical variables will be summarized using frequency 
counts and percentages.  
No inferential testing will be performed.

(TEAEs), related TEAEs, TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug or study and serious 
TEAEs will  be tabulated by System Organ Class  and preferred term with a br eakdown by 
treatment. A subject with multiple adverse events within a body system is only counted once 
towards the total of this body system.  
10.8.5 Pharmacokinetics  
Population PK will be performed on all subjects. The PK analysis of MAU8 68 plasma 
concentration d ata will be performed using validated software in order to derive the population 
mean (and variance) values of specific PK parameters. Plasma concentrations will be summarized 
descriptively by time point of collection.  
The PK endpo ints for MAU868  are: area under the c oncentration -time curve to the end of the 
dosing period (AUC 0-24), area under the concentration -time curve up to the last measurable 
concentration (AUC 0-last), concentration at the end of infusion (C eoi) and minimum con centration 
observed (C trough). Plasma samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluations will be collected at the 
time points described in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix A).

unblinded; however, these data will not include associated subject or s ite identifiers. The objectives 
of this interim analysis are  to evaluate whether four doses MAU868 1350 mg IV administered 
every 28 days for a total of 4 doses demonstrate:  
• safety and tolerability signals compared to placebo  
• a decrease in BK plasma viral l oad compared to placebo  
• predicted M AU868 plasma levels  
The conclusions from this first analysis will be used by the Sponsor to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of MAU868 early -on in this first -in-patient study. Unless a significant safety issue related 
to administration of MAU868 has been i dentified, the conclusion s will have no impact on Cohort  2 
or the study’s design.  
Following completion of the 12 -week treatment periods for Cohorts 1 and 2, cumulative unblinded 
data from both cohorts will be reviewed for  safety and tolerability (adverse e vents, clinical 
laboratories, vitals/physical exams and ECGs), efficacy (BKV viral load in the plasma) and PK 
(MAU868 plasma levels). The treatment assignments will be unblinded; however, these data will 
not include assoc iated subject or site identifiers. The objectives of this second interim analysis are 
to evaluate whether four doses MAU868 1350 mg IV administered every 28 days for a total of 
4 doses or MAU868 6750 mg IV administered as a first dose followed by 3 more doses of 
MAU868 1350 mg IV administer ed every 28 days demonstr ate: 
• safety and tolerability signals compared to placebo  
• a decrease in viral load compared to placebo  
• predicted MAU868 plasma levels  
Based on the SSRC’s safety, efficacy and PK conclusions for Cohorts 1 and 2, the dosing regimen 
for Cohort 3 may be adjusted in dosage and/or duration; however, the dosage and duration for 
Cohort 3 will not exceed the dose already specified in the protocol. Cohort 3 will not be opened 
for screening and enrollme nt this evaluation has been completed

1. Protocol specific procedures should not be performed until the subject has consen ted to participation in th e study.  However, assessments and procedures 
performed as part of standard of care prior to informed consent, including determination of BK viral lo ad in plasma may be used to qualify a subject for the 
study.   
2. During the treatme nt period, subjects should be seen approximately every 7 days (+/-3 days) during the first 6 weeks and approximately every 14 days   
(+/-5 days) for the duration of treatment. Subjects may be seen more often at the Investigator’s discretion.  Visit dates ar e determined from the Baseline Visit.  
3. During the follow -up period, i f the subject cannot be seen on the precise protocol -defined study day, the acceptable visit window is +/10 days.  
4. Study Day 1 is the calendar day on which the first dose of study drug  is administered.  Subsequent study days are based on calendar days.  
5. The information necessary for determining the KDPI includes donor age, height, weight, ethnicity, history of hypertension, history of diabetes mellitus, cause 
of death, serum creatinine, hep atitis C serostatus, and w hether donation occurred after circulatory death.  
6. Record any and all immunosuppressive  medication from induction to randomization as well as any other medications taken during the 10 days prior to 
randomization.  
7. Randomization sh ould occur as soon as poss ible after confirmation of qualifying viremia but not mo re than 10 days after the qualifying sample was collected. 
Dosing of study drug  should occur as soon as possible after randomization.  
8. In the event that a subject requires he modialysis, plasmapheresis , or immunoadsorption treatments; if <15 days since last  MAU868/placebo treatment another 
dose will be given as soon as possible,  and the next scheduled monthly dose skipped. Regular dosing will occur the following month. If the l ast dose was 15  days 
or greater no interim dose will be administered and the regular monthly scheduled will be followed. No subject will receive more than 4 doses.  
9. A sufficient amount of urine should be collected at each assessment  to accommodate three tes ts; one for BKV DNA PCR, o ne for possible genotypic resistance 
testing and a back up sample.  Refer to the study’s Laboratory Manual for volume requirements.  
10. On Study Day 1 collect samples for BK V PCR, anti drug antibodies, and safety labs prior to administr ation of first d ose of MAU 868.  Refer to the study’s 
Laboratory Manual for collection requirements.  
11. After screening, plasma samples should be collected and sent to the central laboratory at each assessment for BKV DNA PCR, possible genotypic resistance 
testing and a backup sample. During screening, only BKV PCR  is required  and may be performed by the laboratory used by the site for usual clinical care, or 
sent to the central lab for testing . Refer to the study’s Laboratory Manual for volume requirements.  
12. In the event subject undergoes hemodialysis, plasmapheresis, or immunoadsorption treatment, a PK sample should be collected prior to and following the 
respective treatment.

Version 2.0, 15APR2020  Appendix D: CTCAE 5 
Section 3.3.2 of the protocol  outlines criteria for discontinuation from study drug.  All treatment -
related SAEs and certain treatment -related AEs and treatment -related laboratory abnor malities 
should result in immediate discontinuation from study drug.  Re -challenge is not permitted.  
Determination of whether an individual treatment related non -serious A E and/or treatment related 
laboratory abnormality should prompt discontinuation of st udy drug depends on the severity of the 
AE and laboratory abnormality based on Common Terminology Cri teria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 5 grade.   
Note that the foll owing requires immediate discontinuation of study drug:  
• Treatment-related AEs of Grade 3 or higher (including infusion reactions) except for 
cytokine release syndrome and serum sickness where a severity grade of 2 or higher should 
prompt discontinuation . CTCAE criteria for infusion related reactions, cytokine release 
syndrome, and serum si ckness are below.  The complete CTCAE criteria for other 
treatment related AEs may be accessed at the  following website: 
(https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/elect ronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_
Quick_Reference_5x7.pdf ).  
• Clinically significant tr eatment-related laboratory abnormality Grade 3 or higher.

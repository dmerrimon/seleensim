treatments will be administered in a blinded fashion. A concomitant administration of vitamin 
K is to be administered, unless the patient requires resumption of VKA anticoagulation within 
24 hours after surgery . Vitamin K should be administered within 1 hour before or within 1 
hour after investigational medicinal product ( IMP) infusion at a dose of 2, 5, or 10 mg 
according to local clinical practice. The preferred route for vitamin K administration is by 
slow IV infusion.  If vitamin K is not administered, the reason must be documented .  
Study Outcome Parameters ( Efficacy and Safety   Endpoints):  
Efficacy:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the hemostatic efficacy rating at the end of the surgery.  
Efficacy will be r ated by the investigator at the end of the surgery in a blinded manner  based 
on a 4- point hemostatic efficacy scale  taking into account blood loss and transfusion 
requirements in the context of the surgery. 
The hemostatic efficacy rating will also be assessed  by an independent endpoint adjudication 
board (IEAB)  consisting of clinical experts. All adjudications will be conducted in a blinded 
manner and the IEAB  will be provided with all relevant details (e.g., duration of surgery, co-
medication, medical his tory, predicted and actual blood loss, and transfusion information) of 
the patient and the actual procedure performed1 covering the time period up to the end of the 
surgery, as documented in the anesthesia record. To ensure the effectiveness of blinding and avoid potential bias, the INR and prothrombin time values will not be provided to the IEAB . 
The dichotomized final adjudicated hemostatic efficacy rating  from the IEAB  
will serve as 
the primary efficacy variable for the statistical analysis. The concorda nce or discordance of 
the investigator and the IEAB ratings  will also be determined as part of the final analysis; the 
IEAB  will be kept blinded to the investigator’s rating.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints are:  
•Proportion of patients with an INR value of less than or equal to 1.5 at 30 (±  15)
minutes  after the end of infusion.
•Change in coagulation factor levels from baseline to 30 (±  15) minutes  after the end
of infusion:
oFactor FII
oFactor FVII
oFactor FIX
oFactor FX
•Proportion of patients receiving red blo od cells (RBC) during the surgery

Exploratory endpoints are: 
•Change in INR from baseline.
•Change in Protein C  (PC) , and Protein S  (PS) from baseline to 30 (±  15) minutes after
the end of infusion.
•Change in coagulation factor levels (FII, FVII, FIX, FX, PC, and PS) from baseline to
2, 4, 12, and 24 hours after end of infusion.
•Assessment of blood loss after end of surgery.
•Proportion of patients receiving plasma and platelets transfusions initiated during the
surgery.
•Total volume of RBC and other blood product transfusions initiated during the surgery
normalized by patient's BW.
•Change in hematological parameters (hemoglobin  (Hgb) , hematocrit, RBC, white
blood cells [ WBC], platelets) from the beginning to the end of the surgery.
•RBC transfusion corr ected c hange from baseline in Hgb at 12 and 24 hours after start
of surgery.
•Proportion of patients experiencing surgical wound hematoma requiring surgical
evacuation .
•Ratio of actual estimated blood loss as documented after surgery to the pre -operative
predicted  blood loss.
Safety:  
Clinical safety will be assessed using the following endpoints: 
•Occurrence of adverse events  (AEs).
•Occurrence of TEEs (overall, within 3, 21, and 45 days after end of surgery).
•Mortality (overall, within 3, 21, and 45 days after end of surgery).
•Monitoring vital signs, laboratory parameters.
•Viral safety (at baseline , and Day 9 (-2/+5 days) after administration of IMP  for
patients with negative baseline virology test ).
Summary of Study Procedures and Statistical Analysis Plan: 
Study P rocedures:  
A maximum of 370 patients will be enroll ed (185 patient s per treatment group). One group 
will receive OCTAPLEX and the o ther group will receive Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra) . 
Patients will be on oral anticoagulant therapy with VKA and will need to undergo an urgent 
surgery that bears a significant risk of bleeding (≥50 mL expected blood loss).

The intent of the physician performing the procedure is to start the surgery within 3 hours 
after the end of 4F -PCC administration.  
At least 40% of all patients  enrolled will be scheduled for an urgent surgery with expected 
blood loss of ≥200 mL. At least 20% of all patients enrolled will be scheduled for an urgent 
surgery with expected blood loss of ≥100 mL but <200 mL. At most 40% of all patients 
enrolled will be scheduled for an urgent  surger y with expected blood loss ≥50 mL but 
<100 mL . 
After determination of the acceptability for the study, patients have to give their written 
informed consent and must meet the inclusion criteria of the study. Written informed consent must be obtained from the patient.  
The qualifying INR (INR available at the time of decision to reverse the anticoagulation 
status)  should be used for the decision to enroll a patient into the study. Treatment allocation 
will then be performed by an Interactive Response Technolo gy (IRT) where the patient will 
be assigned to one of the 2 treatment groups with equal probability (i.e., 1:1). In order to 
achieve a balance between the 2 treatment groups with respect to the planned type of surgery and history of TEE, the treatment allo cation by the IRT  will be stratif
ied according to the 
parameter s ‘Expected blood loss  (“≥200 mL ”, “≥100 mL but <200 mL” or “≥50 mL but 
<100 mL ”)’,  ‘History of TEE ( “yes” or “no” )’ and ‘Type of planned surgery ( “orthopaedic 
surgery ”, “cardiothoracic surger y” or “other surger y”).  To ensure tha t the intended 
proportions of patients  enrolled are kept for subgroups of  expected blood loss ,  the IRT  will 
preclude enrollment into the subgroup once its targeted number of enrolled patients is reached . 
The same appl ies to the  population considered in the interim analysis. 
Details on the patient's medical history (especially occurrence of previous TEEs), the current  
clinical status, the  expected amount of blood loss (mL) due to the surgery, the reason for, 
duration a nd time of last administration  of anticoagulant therapy and details about 
concomitant medication should be recorded. Baseline measurements  will be performed for all 
relevant parameters within 3 hours before administration of study drug. 
The dose of study drug to be administered will be calculated by the responsible treating 
investigator based on the patient's BW and baseline INR according to the recommended 
dosing table. Based on the calculated  dose and the assigned treatment code, the IMP will be 
prepared  in a manner that will blind the investigator to the study treatment.  
After baseline measurements, blood samples and the administration of IMP, blood samples 
will be  taken for safety assessments, coagulation tests and for factor level measurements at 
pre-defined time points. All  relevant details of the surgery will be recorded. The time and

amount of all blood and plasma products given  during and after the surgery will be recorded 
in the C ase Report Form , as well as the reason and timing for their  administ ration. An 
assessment of the hemostatic efficacy of the study treatments based on the provided guidance  
document (see Section  7.2.1), including the 4-point hemostatic efficacy scale, will be recorded 
by the inve stigator after the surgery.  
Clinical safety will be assessed by monitoring vital signs, laboratory parameters, and by 
documenting AEs  and vital status . 
Statistical Analysis:  
The primary efficacy variable is the hemostatic efficacy as assessed by the IEAB . The 
hemostatic efficacy is to be assessed  based on objective criteria in the categories 'excellent', 
'good', 'moderate' or 'none'. Ratings of 'excellent' and 'good' will be considered as 'effective' 
hemostasis, while a rating of 'moderate' and 'none' wil l be considered as 'ineffective' 
hemostasis.  
The dichotom
ous 'hemostatic success' variable will be used in the analyses.  
To demonstrate that treatment  with OCTAPLEX is clinically not inf erior to treatment with 
Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  with respect to hemo static success, a two -sample, one -sided test of 
the pair of hypotheses: 
H0: p K – p O ≥ δ (inferiority)  
vs.  H 1: p K – p O < δ (non- inferiority)  
will be carried out with a type I error probability of α = 0.025 and clinical non- inferiority 
margin of δ = 0.15. Whereby pO and p K present the probabilities of hemostatic success of 
OCTAPLEX and Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra) , respectively . 
The study employs a sequential design that allows one pre -planned interim analysis using the 
data from the first 50% of randomized p atients. The interim analysis will be performed on the 
cohort of the first 185 randomized patients after documentation of the primary endpoint has 
been performed. See Section  9.4 for details.  
Farrington’s and M anning’s test for difference in proportions will be used to assess the 
primary hypothesis in the interim and final analys es. One -sided p- values and the 
corresponding nominal and repeated confidence intervals (CIs) for the difference in 
hemostatic success p robabilities will be presented.  
The primary analysis will be performed on the intent- to-treat (ITT)  population. Additional 
analys es will be performed for the modified intent- to-treat (mITT) and per-protocol ( PP) 
population.

In case of non -inferiority in the ITT, mITT and the PP population a  “tipping point” analysis 
will be done to determine the robustness of the result s. Iteratively p atients excluded from the 
mITT analysis assigned to the control arm will be considered as  treatment successes, and 
patients  excluded from the mITT analysis and assigned to the O CTAPLEX  arm will be 
considered as  treatment failures, to determine the number of such imputed outcomes required 
to “tip” the study result from positive to negative  in the randomized population. 
Farringt on’s and Manning’s test for difference in proportions will be used to test the secondary 
variables on proportions. Point estimates and two- sided 95% CIs will be presented in addition 
to descriptive statistics for these endpoints.  
Analysis of the secondary and further exploratory endpoints will be done on the ITT and 
mITT, and PP  populations unless indicated otherwise. These analyses will be exploratory, by 
presenting descriptive statistics.  
Safety analyses will be performed for the Safety Analysis Set . Anal yses will generally be 
descriptive. For TEEs and mortality, a possible difference between treatment groups will be 
estimated by a risk rat io with 95% CI and Kaplan -Meier estimates for time to event will be 
calculated and graphically presented.

xi 1  Time of surgery start is time of anesthesia initiation. Time of surgery end is surgical end time of principal procedure.  
2Assessments at D ays 1, 2,or 4 are done if patient remains hospitalized. Discharge assessments should be done at the day of discharge. If discharge fal ls on Days 1, 2 ,or 4, schedule 
of discharge assessments should be followed. 
3Baseline information includes collection of demographics, medical history, prior and concomitant medication use, determination of vitamin K administration details (s ee Section 7.1).
4If baseline INR value is not available when patient must be randomized to initiate preparation of IMP, qualifying INR (used for inclusion of the patient) can be used. Basel ine INR
test can be skipped if qualifying INR istaken within 3 hours before IMP infusion start and was analyzed by local laboratory participating in the study. If initial IMP dose calculation
was based on qualifying INR and later Baseline INR was performed it must be checked whether IMP dose requires adjustment due to INR change. If required, IMP dose must be 
adjusted to Baseline INR and revised INR and IMP dose registered using IRT.
5Results of hematology and coagulation factors blood tests performed as part of standard patient care should be documented in eCRF.
6  Prior OP/Post OP coagulation sample scan be skipped if one of the After the END of Infusion sampl es is scheduled within itstime window.
7Samples will not be done if patient has b een disc harged earlier. Discharge visit samples should be taken at the day of discharge.
8Urine or blood pregnancy test should be done only in wome n of childbearing poten tial ( WOCBP ).SeeSection 7.3.9 for definition of WOCBP status .
9Day 9 Virology tests should only be done in patients who had at least one negative result of Baseline Virology tests ( See Secti on7.3.7 )
10Vitamin K can be administered within timeframe ±1h of IMP infusion. For  patients with mechanical heart valve, LVAD or any other hypercoagulable/prothrombotic condition
administration of vitamin K is not mandatory.  
11If reconstit uted  IMP not used within 4 hours following reconstitution it should be discarded and new IMP assigned via IRT.
12Transfusions should be colle cted during hospitalization for the original admission.
13Only concomitant medication sre lated to ongoing AE shou ld be recorded .

10 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
Freeze -dried human prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) is a plasma protein fraction 
containing coagulation factor IX (FIX) and comparable quantities of coagulation factor II (FII), 
factor VII (FVII), and factor X (FX). It is prepared from human plasma by fractionation. 
PCC can be used for the substitutive therapy of patients with either inherited or acquired single 
or multiple defic iency in coagulation factors II, VII, IX, or X. Acquired deficiency of 
coagulation factors is seen in conjunction with a prophylactic, oral anticoagulant therapy using 
the coumadin or warfarin type drugs to prevent thrombosis/embolism in patients at high r isk 
(e.g. previous venous or arterial thrombosis, heart valvular lesions or atrial fibrillation). 
Patients treated with oral anticoagulants who need to undergo surgical interventions repres ent 
a special risk population. If anticoagulant therapy is not inte rrupted before the surgical 
intervention, the risk of bleeding is high. The desirable therapeutic range of the international 
normalized ratio (INR) for patients needing anticoagulation, appears to be 2- 3 for most clinical 
situations except perhaps for pros thetic heart valves, which appear to benefit from a slightly 
higher target range of 2.5-3.5. Nevertheless, the incidence of adverse bleeding on warfarin rises 
4 fold with INRs over 4.5 (1) and each 0.5 increase in the INR increases the risk of intracranial 
bleeding by 1.43 (2). Almost half of all warfarin -related bleeds occur with INRs less than 4 (3). 
In a recent study, mortality from all causes of death was strongly related to the INR level.  
Minimum risk of death was attained at 2.2 INR for all patients and 2.3 INR for patients with 
mechanical heart valve prostheses. A high INR was associated with an excess mortality: with an increase of 1 unit of INR above 2.5, the risk of death from cerebral bleeding (149 deaths) and from any cause was  about doubled (4). 
Special attention should be paid to emergency patients who ar e treated with anticoagulants. 
These patients need additional interventions for a rapid reversal of oral anticoagulant therapy to avoid major bleeding. 
Three approaches have been  recommended in cases where bleeding occurring peri -operatively 
need s to be treated.  One strategy in volves injection of vitamin K. However, vitamin K injection 
attains full effect after 12 to 24 hours, which might be too long for effective substitution. A 
second approach involves the administration of fresh frozen plasma ( FFP). A third approach 
involves the use of PCC. In the latter two cases, between 20 -50 International Units  (IU) of each 
factor/kg body weight (BW) should be administered but this is dependent on t he initial INR of 
the patient. It has been shown that individualized dosing dependent on the INR of the patient is 
a more effective way of dosing PCCs (5). FFP attains full effect shortly after the appropriate 
volume of infusion has been completed;  however, the thawing of FFP could add a significant 
time delay , especially in emergency situations. Another  major disadvantage with plasma is the 
large volume required to reduce a high INR to below 2.0, with the consequence that patients 
treated with this alternative may have a residual anticoagulant effect and the hemorrhage may progress (6). 
PCC administration is an effective treatment modality for the correction of warfarin 
anticoagulation in the urgent setting  (5, 7, 8) . Advantages over FFP include more timely 
correction, absence of volume overload and potentially more complete correction (9). The use 
of PCC provides a simple and convenient tool for a quick and predictive correction of the 
depleted coagulation factors.

11 These products contain all factors needed for quick reversal of VKA anticoagulant related 
bleeding in predefined activities. It is, therefore, possible to attain a full effect with an optima l 
reduced time to the correction of the coagulation deficit. 
OCTAPLEX is a four- factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) being developed by 
Octapharma. In the current study, the control will consist of Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra), a 4F-PCC 
developed and marketed by CSL Behring.  
1.1.1 OCTAPLEX  
1.1.1.1 Efficacy of OCTAPLEX  
Octapharma has carried out 6 clinical trials with OCTAPLEX in patients.  
Study LEX -201 included patients with single or multiple congenital deficiencies in coagulation 
factors II, VII, IX and X. The results of the clinical study have shown that OCTAPLEX is an 
efficient preparation for the chronic substitutive treatment of patients with congenital 
deficiencies of these coagulation factors. With respect to safety , OCTAPLEX was well 
tolerated. No viral seroconversion was observed. The very sensitive markers of 
thrombogenicity, which were tested, did not indicate any thrombogenicity of the product. No 
inhibitor development was observed, and recovery and terminal half -life measured in 10 
patients after 6 months of treatment did not suggest immunogenicity of the product. 
Study LEX -202 included patients either undergoing major surgery or having major bleeding 
during treatment with anticoagulants  of coumadin or warfarin type. The results indicate that 
OCTAPLEX, g iven as single dose, is a valuable, new alternative to achieve a profound r ise in 
prothrombin time (PT) associated with a profound decrease of the INR and having a g ood 
overall clinical efficacy. In this study, two patients seroconverted for Parvovirus B19, however,  
without any clinical symptoms.  Otherwise no safety concerns have been raised during the 
clinical testing.  
Study LEX -203 concluded that the clinical efficacy of OCTAPLEX administered in appropriate 
doses could be demonstrated conclusively: 51 of the 56 patients in the per protocol population 
(91.1%) showed an efficacy response, i.e., reached the efficacy endpoint of a post infusion PT 
value equal to or larger than the desired and corrected PT value pr e-defined by the investigator. 
In all responders these post infusion PT values could be measured within 10 minutes after administration of the calculated dosage. Even in five remaining patients the c linical response 
was adequate. The individual coagulation factor levels showed a sufficient rise from ba seline 
into the therapeutic ran ge. All patients showed an excellent clinical response, in particular, no 
complications caused by uncontrollable bleeding were obse rved after OCTAPLEX treatment. 
The clinical tolerability  of the product was excellent. In this  study OCTAPLEX appears to be 
an efficacious treatment for the prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding in acquired deficiency of the prothrombin complex coagulation factors. 
Study LEX -204 was an observational study in patients with prothrombin comple x factor  
deficiency in Germany and Study LEX -206 was conducted in in patients with intracranial 
hemorrhage related to oral anticoagulant therapy in France. Results for these studies are 
summarized in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) . 
Study LEX -205 was a randomized, open- label, efficacy and safety study of OCTAPLEX and 
fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in patients under vitamin K antagonist  (VKA) therapy with the need 
for urgent surgery or invasive procedures. Correction of IN R to a value below 1.5 within

12 15 minutes of the end of study infusion was achieved for 76% of the OCTAPLEX -treated 
patients and 30% of the FFP- treated patients.   
This new clinical study  (LEX -209) will be conducted to facilitate marketing authorization in 
the US ; the rationale for conducting this study is provided in S ection  1.2.  
1.1.1.2 Safety of OCTAPLEX 
OCTAPLEX has received marketing authoriz ation in 76 countries worldwide. Between 
March  2003 andSeptember 2017, more than  of OCTAPLEX have  been sol d. 
Assuming a mean single dose of about 30 IU/kg BW  and a mean patient weight of 70  kg, this 
figure represents about  of OCTAPLEX.  
OCTAPLEX is not to be administered to patients with: 
•Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to a ny of the excipients.
•Known allergy to heparin or history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
Patients receiving a VKA  may have an underlying hyper -coag ulation state and infusion of PCC  
may exacerbate this.  
If allergic or anaphylactic- type reactions occu r, the infusion should be stopped immediately. In 
case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. 
There is a risk of thrombosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation when patients, with 
either congenital or acquired deficienc y are treated with human prothrombin complex , 
particularly with repeated dosing. Patients given human prothrombin complex should be observed closely for signs or symptoms of intravascular coagulation or thrombosis. Because of the risk of thromboembolic complications, close monitoring should be exercised when administering human prothrombin complex to patients with a history of coronary heart disease, to patients with liver disease, to peri- or postoperative patients, to neonates, or to patients at risk 
of thromboembolic events (TEE) or disseminated intravascular coagulation. In each of these 
situations, the potential benefit of treatment should be weighed against the risk of these complications.  
The known risks of treatment with OCTAPLEX are consistent with the inclusion and exclusion criteria in this study, which minimize the risk to patients  enrol led in this study.

13 multicenter randomized controlled t rial in subjects who had been treated with VKA therapy and 
who required urgent replacement of their Vi tamin K -dependent clotting factors because of their 
need for an urgent surgery/invasive procedure.  
A total of 181 subjects with acquired coagulation factor deficiency due to oral  VKA therapy 
were randomized to a single dose of Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra) or plasma. One hundred seventy -
six (176) subjects received Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  or plasma because of their need for  an 
urgent surgery/ invasive procedure in the setting of a baseline INR ≥2.0 and recent  use of a VKA 
anticoagulant. The doses of Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  (25 IU/kg, 35 IU/kg, or 50 IU/kg) based 
on nominal Factor IX content and plasma (10 mL/kg, 12 mL/kg, or 15 mL/kg)  were calculated 
according to the subject’ s baseline INR (2‒< 4, 4‒6, > 6, respectively). The observation period 
lasted for 90 days after the infusion of Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  or plasma. The modified  
efficacy (ITT -E) population for Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  included 87 subjects and for plasma 
included 81 subjects. Additionally, oral or intravenous (IV)  Vitamin K was administered.  
The eff icacy endpoint was hemostatic efficacy for the time period from the start of infusion of 
Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  or plasma until the end of the urgent surgery/invasive procedure. 
Criteria for effective hemostasis were based upon the difference between predicted and actual 
blood losses, subjective hemostasis rating, and the need for additional blood products containing coagulation factors. The proportion of subjects with effective hemostasis was 89.7% in the Beriplex
® P/N (Kcentra)  group and 75.3% in the pla sma group. The lower limit of the 
95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in proportions of Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  
minus plasma was 2.8%, which exceeded -10% and thereby demonstrated the non- inferiority 
of Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  versus plasma (the study’s primary objective). Because the lower 
limit of the CI was greater than 0, the prospectively defined criterion for superiority of Beriplex
® P/N (Kcentra)  for hemostatic efficacy (a secondary objective) was also met.  
An additional endpoint was the reduction of INR to ≤1.3 at 30 minutes after the end of infusion 
of Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  or plasma for all subjects that received study product. The 
proportion of subjects with this decrease in INR was 55.2% in the Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  
group and 9.9%  in the plasma group. The 95% CI for the difference in proportions of 
Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  minus plasma was 31.9% to 56.4%. The lower limit of the 95% CI of 
31.9% demonstrated superiority of Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  versus plasma for this endpoint. 
The r elationship between a decrease in INR to less than or equal to 1.3 and clinical hemostatic 
efficacy was not established.  
A summary of this study, including key safety findings, is provided in the Beriplex® P/N 
(Kcentra)  US Prescribing Information  and local  labeling , and the results have also been 
published (10). 
1.1.2.2 Safety of Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  
The following “black box warning” is included in the K centra US Prescribing Information: 
WARNING: ARTERIAL AND VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLIC COMPLICATIONS  
Patients being treated with VKA therapy have underlying disease states that predispose 
them to thromboembolic events. Potential benefits of reversing VKA should be weighed against the potential risks of thromboembolic events, espec ially in patients with the history 
of a thromboembolic event. Resumption of anticoagulation should be carefully considered as soon as the risk of TEE outweighs the risk of acute bleeding.

14 •Both fatal and non -fatal arterial and venous thromboembolic complica tions have been
reported with Kcentra in clinical trials and post marketing surveillance. Monitor patients
receiving Kcentra for signs and symptoms of thromboembolic events.
•Kcentra  was not studied in subjects who had a thromboembolic event, myocardial
infarction, disseminated intravascular coagulation, cerebral vascular accident, transient
ischemic attack  (TIA), unstable angina pectoris, or severe peripheral vascular disease
within the prior 3 months. Kcentra may not be suitable in patients with TEE in the  prior
3 months.
Kcentra is contraindicated in patients with:  
•Known anaphylactic or severe systemic reactions to K centra or any components in
Kcentra  including heparin, Factors II, VII, IX, X, Proteins C and S, Antithrombin III
and human albumin.
•Dissemin ated intravascular coagulation.
•Known hepa rin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) . Kcentra contains heparin.
These 
warnings and contraindications are consistent with the exclusion criteria in this study, 
which exclude such patients from enrollment in this study.  
Warnings and Precautions for K centra: 
•Hypersensitivity reactions may occur. If necessary, discontinue administration and
institute appropriate treatment.
•Arterial and venous thromboembolic complications have been reported in patientsreceiving K centr a. Monitor patients receiving K centra for signs and symptoms of
thromboembolic events. K centra was not studied in subjects who had a thrombotic or
TEE within the prior 3 months. Kcentra may not be suitable in patients with TEE in the
prior 3 months.
•Kcentra is made from human blood and may carry a risk of transmitting infectious
agents, e.g., viruses, the variant Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease agent, and theoretically, the
Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease agent.
Adverse Reactions with K centra  
•The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥2.8%) observed in subjects receivingKcentra were headache, nausea/vomiting, hypotension, and anemia.
•The most serious adverse reactions  were TEE including stroke, pulmonary embolism,
and deep vein thrombosis.
1.2 Rationale for Conducting the Study  
To evaluate the efficacy  and safety  of OCTAPLEX, th e Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) 
proposed a prospective, parallel, randomized, controlled trial in patient s needing urgent surgery 
and judged to carry significant risk of intraoperative/proc edural  hemorrhage. FDA advised that 
the control group should receive a product licensed for this indication. The trial should achieve 
greater  statistical power than LEX -205.  
This adequately powered study is intended to meet these requests by demonstrating  that the 
efficacy of OCTAPLEX is not clinically inferior to that of Beriplex
® P/N (Kcentra) . The 
efficacy and safety results will be compared with those of Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra) , the only

No. LEX -209 19-Jan-2018
15 currently FDA -approved PCC therapy indicated for the urgent reversal of acquired coagulation 
factor deficiency induced by VKA. 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, International Council on 
Harmonisation -Good Clinical Practice  (ICH-GCP ), and other regulatory requirements.  
1.3 Dose Rationale 
The dosa ge recommended  in the current US Prescribing Information  of Beriplex® P/N 
(Kcentra)  will be used  for both OCTAPLEX and Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  in this study. This 
dose allows blinding for both groups as the same amount of product would be injected.  
The dose of investigational medicinal product ( IMP) will depend on the BW and baseline INR 
(INR 0) of the patient and will be calculated by the responsible treating investigator according 
to the following dosing table. BW should be rounded to the  nearest whole ki logram  number for 
IMP dose calculation.  Baseline INR value should be rounded to the 1st decimal place.  
Baseline INR  2 to <4  4-6 >6
Dose (IU  of Factor IX/kg BW)  25 35 50 
Maximum dose ( IU of Factor IX)  2500  3500  5000  
IMP will be administered by IV infusion at a rate of 0.12 mL/kg/min (~3 units/kg/min), up to a 
maximum rate of 8.4 mL/min (~210 units/min) . The total volume of IMP used and time of 
infusion will be recorded. Batch numbers will be reported in the final clinical study report. 
1.4 Benefit -Risk Stat ement  
To date, 6 clinical trials with OCTAPLEX have been performed  resulting in marketing 
authorization in Europe and other non- US countries. The tolerability and efficacy of the product 
was good. The active control in this study, Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra) , is approved in the US for 
the indication under investigation. Demonstration of the efficacy of OCTAPLEX in the targeted 
indication would add another independent 4F-PCC treatment option, which is of particular 
importance for such medicinal products that are prepared from human blood or plasma.  
Currently available efficacy data indicate that treatment with OCTAPLEX should be non -
inferior to Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  in the targeted indication. To minimize the risk of treating 
patients with a non- efficacious tr eatment, the study will be conducted in 2 stages, with one un-
blinded interim analysis after enrollment of 50% of the planned sample size, allowing for an 
early stopping of the study for demonstrated non- inferiority of OCTAPLEX or futility to 
achieve this.  Any decision to prematurely terminate the study will be made in consultation with 
the relevant regulatory authorities . 
For both 4F-PCC preparations, the following adverse reactions may occur: 
1.Allergic or anaphylactic reactions in rare cases. Symptoms of  an increased sensitivity can
vary from fever, chills, nausea, urticaria, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and
hypotension up to anaphylactic shock.
2.There is a risk of thrombosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation when patients aretreated with P CC. Close monitoring should be exercised when administering
OCTAPLEXPCC to patients with a history of coronary heart disease, to patients with liverdisease, or to patients at risk of TEE or disseminated intravascular coagulation.

16 3.Very rarely, a sudden, al lergy induced reduction of the blood platelet count below
100,000/µL or 50% of the starting count may be observed ( HIT; thrombocytopenia type II).
In patients not previously hypersensitive to heparin, this decrease in platelets may occur 6
to 14 days after  the start of treatment. In patients with previous heparin hypersensitivity this
reduction may happen within a few hours. This severe form of blood platelet reduction maybe accompanied by, or result in, arterial thrombosis, thromboembolism, severe clottingdisorder (consumptive coagulopathy), skin necrosis at injection site, petechia, purpura ormelaena. Also, a reduction of the anticoagulant effect of heparin may occur (heparin -
tolerance). Patients with the specified allergic reactions must immediately stopadministration with the IMP and should not use medication containing heparin in the future.
4. Development of antibodies to one or more of the prothrombin complex factors.
5.As for all medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma, infectious diseas es
due to transmission of infective agents cannot be totally excluded. This applies also to
pathogens of hitherto unknown origin. However, in the current manufacturing process forboth OCTAPLEX and Beriplex
® P/N (Kcentra) , various steps are included that c ontribute
towards the reduction/inactivation of viruses.
The inclusion and exclusion criteria in this study have been selected to minimize the risk to patients enrol led in this study. Safety will be continuously monitored throughout the study  as it 
accrues , including monitoring of unblinded safety data by an Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (IDMC) . 
In conclusion, the benefit/risk analysis for this study is acceptable for the patient population to be enrol led.

18 3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
3.1 Primary and Secondary Endpoints  
3.1.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the hemostatic efficacy rating at the end of the surgery.  
Efficacy will be rated by the investigator at the end of the surgery in a blinded manner based 
on a 4- point hemostati c efficacy scale taking into account blood loss and transfusion 
requirement s in the context of the surgery. 
The hemostatic efficacy rating will also be assessed  by an independent endpoint adjudication 
board (IEAB) consisting of clinical experts. See Sectio n 7.2.1 for details . All adjudications will 
be conducted in a blinded manner and the IEAB  will be provided with all relevant details (e.g., 
duration of surgery, co -medication, medical history, predicted and actual blood loss, and 
transfusion information) of the patient and the actual procedure performed1 covering the time 
period up to the end of the surgery, as documented in the anesthesia record. To ensure the 
effectiveness of blinding and avoid potential bias, the INR and PT values will not be provided to the IEAB . The dichotomized final adjudicated hemostatic efficacy rating  from the IEAB  will 
serve as the primary efficacy variable for the statistical analysis. The concordance or discordance of the investigator  and the IEAB ratings  will also be determined as part of the final 
analysis; the IEAB  will be kept blinded to the investigator’s rating.  
3.1.2 Secondary Endpoint s 
•Proportion of patients with an INR value of less than or equal to 1.5 at 30  (± 15 )
minutes after the end of infusion.
•Change in coagulation factor levels from baseline to 30 (±  15 ) minutes  after the end of
infusion:
oFactor FII
oFactor FVII
oFactor FIX
oFactor FX
•Proportion of patients receiving red blood cells (RBC) during the surgery
3.1.3 Further Explorato ry Endpoints  
•Change in INR from baseline.
•Change in Protein C  (PC) , and Protein S  (PS) from baseline to 30 (±  15 min) after the
end of infusion.
•Change in coagulation factor levels (FII, FVII, FIX, FX, P CC, and PS) fr om baseline to
2 h, 4 h, 12 h, and 24 h after end of infusion.
•Assessment of blood loss after end of surgery.
•Proportion of patients receiving plasma and platelets transfusions initiated during the
surgery.

19 •Total volume of RBC and other blood product transfusions initiated during the surgery
normalized by patient's BW.
•Change in hematological parameters (hemoglobin (Hgb) , hematocrit  (Hct) , RBC, white
blood cell ( WBC ), platelets) from the beginning to the end of the surgery.
•RBC transfusion corr ected change from baseline in Hgb at 12 and 24 hours  after start
of surgery.
•Proportion of patients experiencing surgical wound hematoma requiring surgicalevacuation.
•Ratio of actual estimated blood loss as documented after surgery to the pre -operative
predicted blood loss for the type of planned surgery.
3.1.4 Clinical safety  
•Occurrence of AEs.
•Occurrence of TEEs (overall, within 3, 21, and 45 days after end of surgery).
•Mortality (overall, within 3, 21, and 45 days after end of surgery).
•Monitoring vital signs, laboratory parameters.
•Viral safety (at baseline a nd day 9 (-2/+5  day s) after administration of IMP).
3.2 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This study is a prospective, multi -center, randomized, double -blind, active -control, group-
sequential, non- inferiority  Phase III study. The study  is planned to start in Q4 2 016 and be 
completed by Q2 2021, and will be performed at sites in the US and  Europe. 
A maximum of 370  patients  (male and female patients at least 18  years of age)  will be enrol led 
(185 patients per treatment group). One group will receive OCTAPLEX and the  other group 
will receive Beriplex
® P/N (Kcentra) . Patients will be on oral anticoagulant therapy with VKAs  
and will need to undergo an urgent surgery that bears a  significant risk of bleeding (≥ 50 mL 
expected blood loss). The intent of the physician performing the procedure is to start the surgery 
within 3 hours after  the end of 4F- PCC administration.  
At least 40% of all patients enrolled will be scheduled for an urgent surgery with expected blood 
loss of ≥200 mL. At least 20% of all patients enrolled will be scheduled for an urgent surgery 
with expected blood loss of ≥100 mL but <200 mL. At most 40% of all patients enrolled will be scheduled for an urgent surgery with expected blood loss ≥50 mL but <100 mL.  
After determination of the acceptability for the study, patients have to give their written 
informed consent (see Section  10.3) and must meet the inclusion criteria of the study. Written 
informed consent must be obtained from the patient . The INR value availab le at the time of 
decision to reverse the anticoagulation status  (qualifying INR) should be used for the decision 
to enroll a patient into the study. Treatment allocation will then be performed by an Interactive 
Response Technology  (IRT), where the patient  will be assigned to one of the 2 treatment groups 
with equal probability (i.e., 1:1). In order to achieve a balance between the 2 treatment groups 
with respect to the planned type of surgery and history of TEE, the treatment allocation by the IRT will be stratified according to the parameters ‘Expected blood los s (“≥200  mL”, “≥100 mL 
but <200 mL” or “≥50 mL but <100 mL”)’,  ‘History of TEE (“yes” or “no”)’ and ‘Type of 
planned surgery (“ orthopaedic surgery ”, “cardiothoracic surgery ” or “other surgery ”).  To 
ensure that the intended proportions of patients enrolled are kept for subgroups of expected blood loss,  the IRT will preclude enrollment into the subgroup once its targeted number of

No. LEX -209 19-Jan-2018
20 enrolled patients is reached. The same applies to the population considered in the interim 
analysis.  
Details on the patient's medical history (especially occurrence of previous TEEs), the current  
clinical status, the expected amount of blood loss (mL) due to the surgery  (average and 
maximum blood loss and expected average and maximum transfusion requirements for non -
anticoagulated  patients under going the same type of surgical procedure), the reason for, 
duration and time of last administration of anticoagulant therapy and details about concomitant 
medication should be recorded. Baseline measurements will be performed for all releva nt 
parameters within 3 hours before administration of study drug. 
The dose of study drug to be administered will be calculated by the responsible treating investigator based on the patient's BW and baseline INR according to the recommended dosing 
table. Based on the calculated dose and the assigned treatment code, the IMP will be prepared  
and infused in a manner that will blind the investigator to the study treatment.  
A concomitant administration of vitamin K is to be administered, unless the patient requir es 
resumption of VKA anticoagulation within 24 hours after surgery . Patients not requiring 
concomitant vitamin K administration are those with:  
•Presence of a mechanical heart valve
•Presence of a Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)
•Presence of a hypercoag ulable/prothrombotic condition identified by the treating
physician and documented with audit trail prior to surgery as an indication for the
resumption of VKA treatment within 24 hours.
Vitamin K should be administered within 1 hour before IMP infusion or within 1 hour after 
IMP infusion, at a dose of 2, 5, or 10 mg according to local clinical practice. The preferred route for vitamin K administration is by slow IV infusion. If vitamin K is not administered, the reason 
must be documented.  
After baseline measurements, blood samples and the administration of IMP, blood samples will 
be taken for safety assessments, coagulation tests and for factor level measurements at pre-defined time points. All relevant details of the surgery will be recorded. The time , reason , and 
amount of all blood and plasma products given during the hospital stay for the primary procedure will be recorded. An assessment of the hemostatic efficacy of the study treatments 
based on the provided guidance  (see Section  7.2.1), including the 4-point hemostatic efficacy 
scale, will be recorded by the investigator after the surgery.  
Clinical safety will be assessed by monitoring vital signs, laboratory parameters, and by documenting AE s. 
An IDMC will continually monitor safety during the study (see S ection  8.6). 
An IEAB  will be established  to determine the primary efficacy outcome for the  study (see 
Section 3.3.11).  
One un-blinded interim analysis will be conducted after enrollment of 50% of the planned 
sample size. The critical values of the chosen group sequential meth od (11) will protect the 
overall type I error but allow an early stopping of the study for demonstrated non- inferiority of 
OCTAPLEX or futility to achieve this.

21 3.3 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Group 
3.3.1 Study Design  
Octapharma desi gned the study to use  a randomized double -blind non- inferiority design 
comparing OCTAPLEX with Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra). A further consideration was to have a 
study design and patient population that would allow comparison with the Beriplex® P/N 
(Kcentra)  confirmatory trial, which demonstrated that Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  is non -inferior 
and superior to plasma for rapid INR reversal and effective h emostasis  (10); this  is the only 
published confirmatory trial comparing 4F -PCC with plasma (the standard agent for rapid 
reversal of VKA- induced anticoagulation). There are no published confirmatory trials 
comparing 4F- PCC with placebo.  
3.3.2 Control G roup  
The FDA advised that the control group in this study should receive a product licensed for this 
indication  in the US . Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  is the only currently FDA -approved 4F-PCC 
therapy indicated for the urgent reversal of acquired coagulation factor deficiency induced by 
VKA and is therefore used as the control in this study. 
3.3.3 Patient Population  
Patients  requiring rapid reversal of  VKA- induced anticoagulation needing urgent surgery 
associated with  significant bleeding risk are to be enrolled  in this study. At least 40% of all  
patients enrolled will be scheduled for an urgent surgery with expected blood loss of ≥200 mL. 
At least 20% of all patients enrolled will be scheduled for an urgent surgery with expected blood loss of ≥100 mL but <200 mL. At most 40% of all patients enrol led will be scheduled for an 
urgent surgery with expected blood loss ≥50 mL but <100 mL.  This patient population should 
also be comparable to that described for the Beriplex
® P/N (Kcentra)  confirmatory study (10). 
In the selected clinical setting, patients may  require resumption of VKA anticoagulation within 
24 hours after surgery. To facilitate inclusion of such patients into this study, criteria to waive concomitant vitamin K administration were include d in the st udy, with the stipulation that the 
reason(s) must be documented in  the Case Report Form ( CRF ).  
3.3.4 Primary Endpoint  
The chosen hemostatic efficacy endpoint with blinded, perioperative hemostatic efficacy rating by an independent adjudication board captures al l clinical aspects of the restoration of 
hemostasis . See Section  7.2.1 for details.  
3.3.5 Rationale for Choice of Non- Inferiority Margin  
In the publication of Goldstein et al. (10), an absolute difference in hemostatic efficacy of 15% 
of the planned control drug ( Beriplex® P/N [Kcentra] ) over FFP was reported (90% versus 
75%). Therefore, demonstrating non- inferiority to Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  based on a 15% 
non-inferiority mar gin would necessarily imply a hemostatic efficacy that is not less than that 
of FFP, which is another FDA approved agent for this indication. The positive demonstration of non- inferiority to the control drug ( Beriplex
® P/N [Kcentra] ) will, of course, requi re that the 
point estimate for the difference in success rates between Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  and 
OCTAPLEX be substantially below the non- inferiority margin.  When assuming a success rate 
for Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  comparable to the one cited in the publi cation of Goldstein et al.  
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 04 
No. LEX -209 19-Jan-2018
22 (10), the point estimate for the success rate with OCTAPLEX will be substantially higher than 
the point estimate for FFP. Finally, the current clinical use of both the control drug 
(Berip lex® P/N [Kcentra] ) and FFP for the reversal of VKA anticoagulation in the U S, given 
the observed 15% higher efficacy with Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra) , demonstrates that a 15% 
difference in clinical success rates lies within a range that is clinically similar.  
3.3.6 Study Procedures  
The study procedures were selected based on standards for the clinical setting, the procedures used in the OCTAPLEX LEX -205 study and Beriplex
® P/N (Kcentra)  confirmatory study (10), 
and to provide the data required to allow assessment of the selected efficacy and safety endpoints. 
A foll ow-up sample will be taken for Parvovirus B19 PCR and a nti-Parvovirus B19 IgM Ab 
assessments at 9 days ( -2/+5 days ) following administration of IMP for patients se ronegative at 
baseline. This time point was chosen as it has been shown that at this time post -infection, 
significant concentrations of both virus and IgM antibodies directed against the virus can be 
detected in blood. P atients seropositive at basel ine do not need to have repeat P arvovirus B19 
serology performed.  
3.3.7 Dose J ustification   
The dose justification is provided in S ection  5.4. 
The maximum infusion rate (8.4 mL per minute) is consistent with th at recommende d in the 
Kcentra US Prescri bing Information. 
3.3.8 Sample Size J ustification  
See Section  9.1. 
3.3.9 Use of an Interim Analysis 
One un- blinded interim analysis will be conducted after enrollment of 50% of the planned 
sample size, to allow for an early stopping of the study for demonstrated non- inferiority of 
OCTAPLEX or for an early stopping for futility. Any decision to prematurely terminate the 
study will be made in consultation with the relevant regulatory authorities . The  interim analysis 
is detailed in Section  9.4. 
3.3.10 Stratification of Randomization 
Patients receiving a VKA generally have an underlying higher risk of TEEs, the reason for 
administration of the antagonist. Withdrawal of the antagonist and restoration of coagul ation 
via administration of PCC can therefore raise the risk of TEEs, with the risk being more pronounced in those patients who have experienced TEEs in the past. To balance this factor that may impact on safety comparisons between the treatment groups, ra ndomization will be 
stratified by ‘History of TEE (yes/no)’. 
As the type of surgery and expected blood los s volume may impact on  efficacy comparisons   
‘Expected blood loss (“≥200 mL”, “≥100 mL but <200 mL” or “≥50 mL but <100 mL”)’  and 
‘Type of planned sur gery (“ orthopaedic surgery ”, “cardiothoracic surgery ” or “other surgery ”)’ 
will be a further stratification factor s.

23 3.3.11 Independent Committee s 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the assessment of clinical hemostasis as assessed by the 
blinded IEAB . In order to adjudicate the primary efficacy endpoint, the IEAB  will receive the 
pre-operative documented expected average and maximum blood loss (both recorded 
irreversibly prior to randomization ), the estimated actual blood loss, and all information on any 
transfusions and administration of “rescue” clotting factor -containing products. Additionally 
the IEAB  will be provided with all available Hgb and Hct values  and information on volume of 
hemorrhagic would drainage. INR and PT values will not be provided to help ensure the effectiveness of blinding and avoid potential bias. IEAB will be blinded to Investigator’s 
clinical hemostasis rating. A detailed description of the information to be provided to the IEAB  
will be developed with the clinical experts and will be included in an IEAB  charter.  
An IDMC will be established by the Sponsor  and will routinely monitor safety in the study.  The 
IDMC will also advise on the further conduct/stopping of the study once the interim analysis 
has been performed. Details are provi ded in S ection  8.6 and S ection  9.4.

24 4 STUDY POPULATION  
4.1 Population Base 
Patients under VKA therapy who need urgent surgery associated with significant bleeding risk 
will be eligible for study inclusion.  
The studied patient population is appropriate since these patients have an acquired prothrombin complex factor deficiency caused by anticoagulant therapy. This puts them at risk of excessive bleeding either spontaneously, due to trauma, or during surgery. The population to be studied would be most vulnerable since they would not have time to have their anticoagulation therapy reversed by administration of vitamin K in order to prevent the possibility of excessive bleeding during surgery. Patients needing urgent surgery can be defined as those that cannot be postponed until reversal of anticoagulation can be safely performed by vitamin K administration.  
Sites will identify  patients for enrollment in this active -controlled prospective study. 
Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) / Institutional Review Board (IRB)  approval will be 
obtained at all participating sites  before start of enrollment.  
4.1.1 Inclusion Criteria  
Patient s who meet all of the following criteria are eligible for the s tudy:  
1.Male or female patients at least 18 years of age.
2.Patients currently on oral anticoagulation treatment with VKA of coumadin or warfarin

4.2.3 Forbidden Concomitant Therapy  
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 04 
No. LEX -209 19-Jan-2018
26 Patient taking P2Y12 platelet inhibitors (e.g. Clopidogrel, Prasugrel, Ticagrelor ) concomitantly 
with VKA are not eligible for the study. P2Y12 platelet inhibitors must not be used until 
completion of hemostasis evaluation at the end of surgery.  
UFH  in dose above 5000 units, LMWH and/or  non- VKA anticoagulant (i.e. direct ora l 
anticoagulant) in any dose, must not be used from the time 24 hours before enrollment into the 
study and until completion of hemostasis evaluation at the end of surgery. The reconstituted 
IMP should not be mixed with other drugs. This could lead to an activation or inactivation of 
coagulation factor(s). 
Generally, administration of blood products should be avoided if possible. However, it is up to 
the treating physician to decide whether a surgical procedure can start or if additional pre -
operative administration of coagulation treatment is required per standard of care (eg , PCC, 
single coagulation factors, plasma). If used, all details must be documented (eg, product name, reason for administration, dose etc.). 
4.3 Withdrawal and Replacement of Patients  
4.3.1 Premat ure Patient Withdrawal 
Patient s have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason, without the need 
to justify their decision. The investigator also has the right to withdraw patients in case of AEs, 
poor compliance , or other reasons. Si nce an excessive rate of withdrawal can render the study 
non-interpretable, the unnecessary withdrawal of patients must be avoided. 
For any discontinuation after study entry, t he investigator will obtain all the required details 
and document the reason(s) for discontinuation. If the reason for withdrawal of a patient is an 
AE, the main specific event or laboratory test will be recorded and the investigator will make 
thorough efforts to clearly document the outcome. 
4.3.2 Patient Replacement Policy  
Patient s withdr awn from the study because of safet y or efficacy  reasons will not be replaced. 
4.4 Assignment of Patients to Treatment Groups  
Each patient will receive a patient number (in numeric order per center) after having signed a 
written informed consent form. The site  will enter the patient number and the initials of each 
patient in the CRF and in the confidential patient identification list.  
Each patient will be randomized to receive IMP (either OCTAPLEX or Beriplex
® P/N 
[Kcentra] ). In order to achieve a balance between the 2 treatment groups with respect to the 
planned type of surgery and history of TEE, the treatment allocation by the IRT will be stratified 
according to the parameters ‘Expected blood loss (“≥200 mL”, “≥100 mL but <200 mL” or “≥50  mL but <100 mL”)’,  ‘History of TEE (“yes” or “no”)’ and ‘Type of planned surgery 
(“orthopaedic surgery ”, “cardiothoracic surgery ” or “other surgery ”).  To ensure that the 
intended proportions of patients enrolled are kept for subgroups of expected blood loss, the IRT will preclude enrollment into the subgroup once its targeted number of enrolled patients is reached.

27 4.5 Relevant Protocol Deviations 
In the case of any major protocol deviation the investigator and Octapharma will decide on the 
furth er participation of the patient in this study, after having discussed all relevant aspects.  All 
major protocol deviations  should be  notified to IEC/IRBs or regulatory aut horities if required 
by local regulation.  
Each patient who has received IMP will be included in the safety population. With respect to 
the Per -Protocol efficacy analysis , protocol deviations will be handled on an individual basis. 
After each study part the decision on membership of the patients in a particular analysis population will be made at a blinded data review meeting, prior to database lock. 
4.6 Subsequent Therapy  
Any patient who discontinues from the study should continue medical treatment according to 
local standards.

5.2 Packaging and Labeling  
Commercially available IMPs will be re-packed  and additionally labeled according to local 
regulations. 
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 04 
No. LEX -209 19-Jan-2018
30 5.3 Conditions for Storage and Use 
IMP should be stored at ≥ 2°C (35°F)  and ≤25°C (77°F)  protected from light and must not be 
frozen . The investigator must ensure that the IMP is stored under appropriate temperature 
conditions and in a reasonably secure area of restricted access.  
Reconstituted product must be used within 4 hours following reconstitution. Re constituted 
product can be stored at 2-25°C (35°F -77°F). If cooled, the solution should be warmed to 20-
25°C prior to administration. Do not freeze the reconstituted product. Discard partially used 
vials.  
5.4 Dose and Dosing Schedule  
The d ose of IMP to be administered should be determined based on BW and baseline INR.  BW 
should be rounded to the  nearest whole kilogram number for IMP dose calculation.  Baseline 
INR value should be rounded to the 1st decimal place.  If the baseline INR value is not available 
at the time when patient must be randomized to initiate preparation of IMP, qualifying INR 
(used for inclusion of the patient) can be used. If the qualifying INR is within 3 hours of IMP 
infusion start and was analyzed by the laboratory participating in the s tudy it can serve as the 
baseline INR and additional baseline INR testing is not mandatory. Otherwise baseline INR 
must be obtained. If the baseline INR value compared to qualifying INR value used for initial 
IMP dose calculation falls within different IMP  dosing range s, the dose of IMP should be 
adjusted to baseline INR using IRT.  
The dose of IMP will depend on the BW  and baseline INR  of the patient and will be calculated 
by the responsible treating investigator according to the following dosing table. 
Baseline INR  2 to <4  4-6 >6
Dose (IU  of Factor IX/kg BW)  25 35 50 
Maximum dose ( IU of Factor IX)  2500  3500  5000  
The n ominal IMP potency of  25 IU/mL of factor IX will be used for volume calculation  (each 
vial has ~500 IU of OCTAPLEX or Beriplex® P/N (Kc entra)  and is reconstituted in 20 mL of 
Water for Injection).   
IMP will be administered by IV infusion at a rate of 0.12 mL/kg/min (~3 units/kg/min), up to a 
maximum rate of 8.4 mL/min (~210 units/min) . The total volume of IMP used and time of 
infusion wil l be recorded.  
One infusion of IMP will be given according to the table above. 
5.5 Prepa
ration and Method of Administration 
The preparation is dissolved with water for injection, by transferring it  into the vial containing 
the concentrate using  the Mix2Vial™ transfer set . 
Before the IMP is infused , the solution must be warmed up to room temperature. The 
preparation must be used immediately after dissolution, and any unused solution must be discarded. If reconstituted IMP is not used within 4 hours following reconstitution, it should be 
discarded and new IMP assigned via IRT. Usually, the solution is clear or slightly opalescent. 
Do not use solutions that are cloudy or have deposits. The reconstitution time is less than 10 
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 04 
No. LEX -209 19-Jan-2018
31 minutes at room temperature. During the procedure described, aseptic technique must be 
maintained.  
The total volume used and time of start and end of infusion will be recorded. 
Infusion line should be flushed with 0.9% sodium chloride.  
5.6 Blinding and Breaking the Study Blind  
Following randomiz ation , IMP will be assigned using IRT and will be prepared for infusion by 
unblinded site personnel. IMP will be prepared and infused in a manner that will blind the 
investigator and other blinded site personnel to the study treatment.  Unblinded site personnel 
must not communicate to the investigator or other blinded site personnel which product was 
assigned to the patient.  
Breaking of blinding in individual patients is only permitted in case of a SAE  or unexpected 
adverse drug reaction ( ADR ), when knowledge of the type of the administered IMP is required 
for therapeutic decisions regarding this event. Emergency patient unblinding will be managed in a dedicated IRT system . In the event an 
investigator needs to unblind a study patient, authorized study personnel at the site will log into 
IRT to request access to the unblinded randomization code for the patient in question. In order 
to do so, the investigator will have to acknowledge the serious nature of unblinding. Upon taking these steps, the dedicated web -based system  will then provide the investigator the 
specific treatment arm for that patient. Upon exiting the dedicated web -based system, an email 
notification of this action will automatically be sent to appropriate management and safety officials acknowl edging the patient unblinding without providing the specific treatment arm. 
This information will also be captured in the study audit trail.  
5.7 Treatment Compliance  
5.7.1 Drug Dispensing and Accountability  
IMP will be delivered to all sites by a central distributio n facility  or local depot. A drug 
dispensing log will be kept up- to-date by each investigator, detailing the dates and quantities of 
the IMP administered to each patient. The inventory will be available to the monitor to verify drug accountability during the study. Any unused IMP and empty bottles will be disposed 
locally if allowed by local regulation or returned to Sponsor’s designee for disposal. 
5.7.2 Assessment of Treatment Compliance  
IMP will be infused at the study site under the guidance of the investigator. The number of vials  
used will be documented together with IMP batch numbers.

35 6.2 Duration of Study  
6.2.1 Planned Duration for an Individual Patient  
The duration of the entire study for each patient will be approximately 45 days . Patients 
randomized, but given no IMP , will be withdrawn from the study. All patients  who received 
IMP, but whose surgery was cancelled due to any reason , should complete all protocol 
procedures with the exception of OP procedures  (prior OP, post OP, 12h after START and 24h 
after START), which will be skipped. Post operative time points (Day 2, Day 4, a nd Discharge) 
will be calculated from the day of IMP infusion. 
6.2.2 Planned Duration for the Study as a Whole 
The study will be considered completed, when all patients have complete d the final examination  
(Day 45 follow-up). 
The estimated start of the study ( enrollment of first patient ) is Q4 2016, and the estimated end 
of the st udy (last visit of last patient) is Q2 2021. As one un- blinded interim analysis  will be 
performed  after enrollment of 50% of the planned sample size, early stopping of the study for 
demo nstrated non- inferiority of OCTAPLEX or futility to achieve this  could occur. 
6.2.3 Premature Termination of the Study  
Both the investigator and the Sponsor reserve the right to terminate the study at any time. Should 
this be necessary, the procedures will be ar ranged on an individual study basis after review and 
consultation by both parties. In terminating the study, the Sponsor and the investigator will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patients' interests.  
Regulatory authorit ies and IECs/IRBs  will be informed according to national regulations. 
Should the study be prematurely terminated, all study materials (IMPs , laboratory kits  etc.) 
must be returned to the Sponsor or disposed at the study site if approved by the Sponsor.

36 7 ASSESSMENTS AND METHODS 
7.1 Background / Baseline Information  
The following information will be captured at Screening and upon enrollment: 
Demographics : including sex, age, weight and height (calculated Body Mass Index), and ethnic 
origin . Weight must be measured  using weighing scales, estimating or asking the patients for 
their weight is not acceptable.  
Medical history : obtained by interviewing the patient . Records of past diseases and treatments 
(e.g., hospital discharge letters) will b e obtained for the study f iles if available.  As history of 
TEEs , estimated blood loss, and type of surgery are stratification factor s for randomization in 
this study, this information must be carefully checked and entered in the CRF. 
Previous and concomitant medication: obtained by interviewing the patient  
Vitamin K administration : documentation of time and dose. If vitamin K is not administered, 
the clinical reason for non-administration must be documented in the CRF. 
7.2 Efficacy Assessments

During screening , an initial hemostatic assessment  will be conducted and documented with an 
audit trail before randomization. This evaluation will include determination of the  nature of the 
operation and the  predicted estimated blood loss and anticipated transfusion requirements . 
Details to be documented include the expected average and maximum blood loss and expected 
average and maximum transfusion requirements for non- anticoagulated patients undergoing the 
same type of surgical procedure. Cell saver blood  is to be accounted for when assessing the 
predicted volume of transfusions . The surgeon will also note any extenuating circumstances 
that may affect the estimated blood loss  or transfusion requirements (e.g.,  prior surgery with 
resulting adhesions, limite d or extensive surgery). Any planned adjunct therapy should also be 
recorded prior to surgery.  
At the  conclusion of the surgical procedure the actual estimated blood loss  (by local practice) 
and transfusion requirements will be documented.  Efficacy will b e rated by the investigator at 
the end of the surgery in a blinded manner based on a 4- point hemostatic efficacy scale. 
The hemostatic efficacy rating will also be assessed  by an IEAB  consisting of clinical experts.  
All adjudications will be conducted in a  blinded manner and the IEAB  will be provided with 
all relevant details (e.g. duration of surgery, co -medication, medical history, predicted and 
actual blood loss, transfusion information, details of hemorrhagic wound drainage ) of the 
patient and the actual procedure performed covering the time period up to the end of the surgery, 
as documented in the anesthesia record. To ensure the effectiveness of blinding and avoid potential bias, the INR and PT values will not be provided to the IEAB . The IEAB will also be 
blinded to Investigator’s clinical hemostasis rating.  
The hemostatic efficacy of the study treatments is to be assessed in the categories 'excellent', 'good', 'moderate' or 'none'. Ratings of 'excellent' and 'good' will be considered as 'effective' hemostasis, while a rating of 'moderate' and 'none' will be considered as 'ineffective' hemostasis.

37 Assessment should be guided by clinical experience, the specifics of the surgery actually 
performed, additional transfusion requirements and blood loss occurred during the surgery. The criteria below involve aspects of intraoperative blood loss and transfusions. 
Hemostatic Efficacy Scale (assessment at the end of the surgery – as documented in the 
anesthesia record)*:  
•Excellent : Intra -operative blood loss and transfusion requirements were lower than or
equal to the average expected ones for the type of procedure performed in a patient  with
normal hemostasis and of the same sex, age, and stature.
•Good : Intra -operative blood loss and transfusion requirements were higher than the
average expected ones but lower or equal to the maximal expected blood loss and
transfusion requirements for the type of procedure in a patient  with normal hemostasis.
•Moderate: Intra -operative blood loss and transfusion requirements were higher than the
maximal expected ones for the type of procedure performed in a patient  with normal
hemostasis, but hemostasis was controlled.
•None : Hemostasis was uncontrolled necessitating a change in clotting factor
replacement regimen.
* For all ratings (excellent, good, moderate and none), unexpected blood loss due to surgical
complications will not  be taken into consideration when assessing intra -operative efficacy.
These include:
1. Direct injury to a vessel (artery or vein).
2. Vessel injury not adequately responding to routine surgical procedures achieving
hemostasis.
3. Accidental injury of parenchymatous tissue (e.g.  liver, lung).
When quantifying the deviation between average and actual intra -operative blood loss and 
transfusions, unexpected  transf usions of plasma, red cells, platelets and coagulation factor 
products due to surgical complications should be excluded. For example: 
1. Direct injury to a vessel (artery or vein),2. Vessel injury not adequately responding to routine surgical procedures achieving
hemostasis,
3. Accidental injury of parenchymatous tissue (e.g. liver, lung),4. Treatment of pre-existing conditions like anemia.
Transfusions for pre -existing anemia will be excluded only if the number of units of red cells 
to be transfused for this purpose is clearly documented prior to administration of the IMP and 
before the start of surgery.  
7.2.2 Assessments for Secondary  and Further Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints  
7.2.2.1 Measurement of INR  
INR will be calculated from the PT results. The INR system is use d to standardize variability 
of response of different thromboplastin reagents to warfarin. The INR is calculated from the PT ratio of test plasma to the geometric mean normal PT, to the power of the international

No. LEX -209 19-Jan-2018
38 sensitivity index of the thromboplastin, us ing the following formula: INR = (patient 
PT/GMNPT)ISI. 
Baseline INR will be determined within 3 hours prior  to the start of the first infusion of IMP. 
Samples will also be d rawn for INR determination at 30 minutes  (±15 minutes), 2 hours ( ±30 
minutes ), 4 hours (±30 minutes), 12 hours ( ±1 hour) , and 24 hours (±2 hours) after the end of 
IMP infusion, prior OP (within 1 hour prior surgery start)  and post OP (within 1 hour after 
surgery end) and  at any point considered necessary by the investigator. All tests p erformed per 
standard of care should be documented in CRF. 
Certified portable INR monitoring devices may only be used for qualifying INR measurements.  
All study specific INR measurements must be tested in local laboratory.  
7.2.2.2 Measurement of Coagulation Factor Levels (FII:C, FVII:C, FIX:C, FX:C, PC, 
and PS)  
Baseline will be deter mined within 3 hours prior to the start of the first infusion of IMP. Samples 
will also be draw n for these determinations at 30 minutes (±15 minutes ), 2 hours (±  30 minutes), 
4 hours (±  30 minutes), 12 hours (±  1 hour), and 24 hours (± 2 hours) after the end of infusion 
or at any point considered necessary by the investigator.  
7.2.2.3 Red Blood Cell, Plasma and Platelets Transfusions Initiated During the Surgery  
The time, amount  (units and mL)  and reason of all intra -operative RBC, plasma, and platelet  
transfusions during surgery will be recorded and analyzed. All blood and plasma products given 
throughout the hospitalization for the original admission and the reason for their administration will be captured on a CRF page designed specifically for this purpose. This will include any 
blood product and/or volume expanders. Blood products will be defined as autologous blood, allogenic whole blood, whole blood, RBC , FFP, platelets, and cryoprecipitat e (14)  (American 
Society of Anesthesiologists 2006).  
Cell saver blood is to  be accounted for when assessing the volume of transfusions. 
The ASA (American Society of A nesthesiologists) recommendations for triggering a RBC 
transfusion will be used to assess the need for RBC transfusions. These guidelines recommend 
RBC transfusion when Hg levels fall acutely below 6 g/dL and no transfus ion when Hg levels 
are above 10 g/dL  (14) (ASA 2006) . The determination of whether intermediate Hgb 
concentrations (i.e., 6–10 g/dL) justify or require red blood cell transfusion should be based on any on going indication of organ ischemia, potential or actual ongoing bleeding (rate and 
magnitude), the patient’s intravascular volume status, and the patient’s risk factors for complications of inadequate oxygenation. These risk factors include a low cardiopul monary 
reserve and high oxygen consumption indicated by decreased urine output, unstable vital signs, evidence of myocardial ischemia, increased lactate or base deficit, change in level of consciousness, orthostatic signs (dizziness or decreased blood pressure with standing), or with impending blood loss (expected for the scheduled surgery). If there is a deviation from this 
guideline the physician/surgeon will be asked to document the justification for any transfusion outside of these guidelines.

39 7.2.2.4 Change in hematological parameters 
Hematological parameters (Hgb, Hct, RBC, WBC, platelets ) will be determined  at the local 
laboratory within 3 hours prior  to the start of the first infusion of IMP. Samples will also be 
drawn for determination of these parameters at 30  minutes (±15 minutes) and 24 hours (±2 
hours) after the end of IMP  infusion, prior OP (within 1 hours prior surgery start) and post OP 
(within 1 hours after surgery end) , at 12 and 24 hours after start of operation and at Day  2, 
Discharge, or at any point considered necessary by the investigator.  
7.2.2.5 Incidence of Hematoma and Proportion of Patients with Surgical Wound 
Hematomas That Need Evacuation 
The patient will be initially assessed for the presence of hematoma. The extent of hematomas 
after surgery will be evaluated. The need for evacuation of any hematoma post-surgery will be 
evaluated and recorded. 
7.3 Safety Assessments 
The following drug safety information shall be collected: 
•AEs and SAEs temporally associated with administration of IMP, or comparato r
(definitions and reporting requirements see Section 7.3.1)
•Pregnanci es, drug overdose, interaction, medication error, lack of efficacy , post study
SAEs  (see Section 7.3.9).
•Occurrence of TEEs
•Vital status (alive vs dead)
•Physical exam ination
•Vital signs
•Clinical laboratory tests
•Viral markers
7.3.1 Adverse Events  
7.3.1.1 Definitions  
Adverse event (AE): An AE is any untoward medic al occurrence in a study patient  receiving 
an IMP an d which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE 
can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IMP, whether or  not 
related to the IMP . 
Adverse drug reaction (ADR) : An ADR is any noxious and unintended response to an IMP 
related to any dose. The phrase “response to an IMP” means that a causal relationship between 
the IMP and an AE carries at least a reasonable poss ibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled 
out. 
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 04 
No. LEX -209 19-Jan-2018
40 Other significant AEs : Any marked laboratory abnormalities or any AEs that lead to an 
intervention, including withdrawal of drug treatment, dose reduction or significant additional 
concomitant therapy.  
Withdrawal due to AE/ADR : AE/ADR leading to discontinuation of  treatment with IMP . Any 
such events will be followed up by the investigator until the event is resolved or until the 
medical condition of the patient  is stable. All follow -up information collect ed will be made 
available to the Sponsor. 
7.3.1.2 Collection  
The condition of the patient  will be monitored throughout the study. At each visit, whether 
scheduled or unscheduled, AEs will be elicited using a standard non- leading question such as  
“How have you been since the last visit / during the previous study period?”. 
Any AE or ADR which occurs during the study will be noted in detail on the appropriate pages 
of the CRF. If the patient  reports several signs or symptoms, representing one  syndrome or 
diagnosis, t he diagnosis should be recorded in the CRF. The investigator will grade the severity 
of all AEs or ADRs (mild, moderate or severe), the seriousness (non- serious or serious) and 
causality, as defined below  (Section s 7.3.1.3, 7.3.1.4 and 7.3.2 ). The Sponsor is responsible to 
assess the expectedness of each ADR (expected or unexpected), as defined below  
(Section  7.3.1.4). 
In the event of clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings, the tests will be confirmed 
and followed- up until they have returned to normal and/or an adequate explanation is available . 
Diseases, signs and sym ptoms and/or laboratory abnormalities already existing before the first 
administration of IMP are not considered as AEs when observed at a later stage unless they 
represent an exacerbation in intensity or frequency (worsening). 
The investigator should always provide detailed information concerning any abnormalities and 
the nature of, and reasons for any necessary action(s), as well as any other observations or 
comments, which are useful for the interpretation and understanding of the patients’  AEs or 
ADRs.  
7.3.1.3 Severity  
The intensity/severity of all AEs will be graded  as follows: 
•mild: an AE, usually transient , which causes discomfort but does not interfere with the
patient’s routine activities ;
•moderate: an AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with the patient’s
routine activities ;
•severe: an AE which is incapacitating and prevents the pursuit of  the patient’s routine
activities .
Grading of an AE is up to the medical judgment of the investigator and will be decided on a 
case by case basis.  
7.3.1.4 Causality 
The relationship of AEs to the administered IMP will be assessed by the investigator : 
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 04 
No. LEX -209 19-Jan-2018
41 •probable : reports including good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a
causal relationship, in the sense of plausible, conceivable, likely, but not necessari ly
highly probable. A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from
administration of the IMP; or that follows a known or expected response pattern to the
suspected medicine; or that is confirmed by stopping or reducing the dosage of themedici ne and that could not reasonably be explained by known characteristics of the
patient’s  clinical state.
•possible : reports containing sufficient information to accept the possibility of a causal
relationship, in the sense of not impossible and not unlikely, although the connection isuncertain or doubtful, for example because of missing data or insufficient evidence. Areaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP;
that follows a known or expected response pattern to the  suspected medicine; but that
could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.
•unlikely : reports not following a reasonable temporal sequence from IMP
administration. An event which may have been produced by the patient’s  clinical state
or by  environmental factors or other therapies administered.
•not related (unrelated) : events for which sufficient information exists to conclude that
the etiology  is unrelated to the IMP.
•unclassified : reports which for one reason or another are not yet assessable, e .g., because
of outstanding information (can only be a temporary assessment).
Classification of A DRs: 
ADRs will be classified by the Sponsor as either expected or unexpected : 
•expected: an A DR that is listed in the current edition of the Investigator' s Brochure.
•unexpected : an A DR that is not listed in the current edition of the Investigator's
Brochure, or that differs because of greater severity or greater specificity.
7.3.1.5 Outcome  
The outcome of all reported AEs has to be documented as follows: 
1. recovered, resolved
2. recovering, resolving3. not recovered, not resolved4. recovered, resolved with sequelae
5. fatal
6. unknown
NOTE:  A patient’s  death  per se is not an event,  but an outcome. The event that resulted in  a 
patient’s  death must be fully documented and reported, even in case the death occurs within 45 
days after IMP treatment end, and without respect of being considered treatment -related or not.  
7.3.1.6 Action(s) taken  
AEs requiring action or therapy must be treated with recognized standards of medical car e to 
protect the health and well -being of the patient . Appropriate resuscitation equipment and 
medicines must be available to ensure the best possible treatment in an emergency situation. 
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 04 
No. LEX -209 19-Jan-2018
42 The action taken by the investigator must be documented: 
a) in general
- none
-medication (other than IMP) or other (e .g., physical) therapy started
-test performed
- other (to be specified)
b) on IMP
- none- product withdrawn- dose reduced-dose increased
The investigator will follow -up each AE until it is resolved or until the medical condition of the 
patient  is stable, and all relevant follow -up information will be reported to the Sponsor. 
7.3.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
•results in death,
•is life -threatening,
•requires hospitalization  (with the exception of hospitalizations for surgeries that were
planned prior to study enrollment) or prolongation of existing hospitalization,
•results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,
•is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,
•is another important medical event.
NOTE:  The term "life -threatening" refers to an event in which the patient  was — in the view 
of the reporting investigator — at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. Medical judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an AE/reaction is serious in other 
situations: Important AEs/ADRs that are not immediately life -threatening or do not result in 
death or  hospitalization but may jeopa rdize the patient  or may require intervention to prevent 
one of the other outcomes listed in the definitions above, should also be considered serious.  In addition, although not classified under the seriousness criteria, all suspected transmissions 
of an infectious agent should be reported as SAE.  A suspected virus transmission means that 
virus antigen has been detected in the patient. A passive transmission of antibodies alone does not constitute a suspected virus transmission. 
SAE reporting timelines  
All SAEs, whether suspected to be related to study treatment or not, are to be reported by telephone, fax or e -mail immediately to  the Sponsor and the Sponsor’s designee . An SAE form  
must be completed and submitted to the Sponsor and the Sponsor’s designee within 24 hours 
after recognition of the event.

These exceptions/waivers include surgeries that are elective or planned before study entry , and 
prolongation of the existing hospitalizations due to economic or social reasons , but not m edical 
reasons. These should not be considered as SAEs. 
7.3.3 Occurrence of TEEs  
As a component of the assessment of AE, the investigator will be questioned regarding the 
occurrence of TEEs. These are defined according to the Standardized Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA ) query (SMQ) “ Embolic and thrombotic events ”. TEEs will 
be captured on a specific page of the CRF. All TEEs must also be recorded on the AE page of 
the CRF.  If TEEs  is suspected at any time during the study, appropriate examin ations according 
to local standards should be performed (e.g. Doppler scan using color duplex, X -ray) and the 
results documented. 
7.3.4 Vital Status  
Vital status (alive or dead) will be documented from consent through the 45- day follow -up or 
discontinuation of t he patient  to allow determination of all- cause mortality . 
7.3.5 Physical Exam 
A standard physical exam will be per formed at baseline, and at post -operative day  2 or 
discharge (whichever comes first).  
7.3.6 Laboratory Tests  
The actual  time of blood sampling must be documented and recorded in the CRF. 
Details of test parameters to be collected are listed in Table 5. 
Coagulation, hematology, electrolytes, liver enzymes, Blood Urea Nitrogen ( BUN) (or Urea), 
and creatinine tests will be performed at the respective local laboratories.   
Tests for coagulation parameters  and virology will be performed at a central laboratory .

7.3.7 Viral Safety Tests  
Viral marker samples are taken at the baseline visit and at Day 9 (-2/+5 days) after the last 
administration of IMP. 
At the b aseline visit, all patients will undergo serologic testing for Parvovirus B19 (anti-
Parvovirus B19 IgM Ab) , as well as PCR for Parvo virus B19.   
At Day 9 (-2/+5 days) following the study infusion of IMP, a foll ow-up sample will be taken 
for P arvovirus B19 PCR and a nti-Parvovirus B19 IgM Ab assessments in patients who had 
negative result s of one or both Parvovirus B19 tests at baseline . Patient s with positive results 
of both baseline tests do not need to have Parvovirus B19 testing  repeated on Day 9.

45 The virus safety  samples will be analyzed in the central laboratory.  In case there is a change 
from baseline of the viral status of a patient and a suspected seroconversion, the viral tests will 
be repeated by the laboratory on back up aliquots of the Baseline and Day 9 samples.  
7.3.8 Vital Signs  
Safety evaluation will include monitoring of vital signs, i.e. , body temperature, heart rate, blood 
pressure, and respiratory rate. Measurements will be carried out at baseline (just prior to 
infusion), and at the time points  specified in  the Flow C hart. Hemodynamic changes are 
frequently observed during surgery. For this reason, only alterations in heart rate or blood 
pressure not coinciding with periods of rapid blood loss and/or dee med significant by the 
physician will be recorded as AEs. In case fever occurs, temperature will be measured every morning until normalized. Fever will be defined as a body temperature >37.8°C orally (or >38.2°C rectally or >38.0 °C axillary) and will be documented as an AE.
7.3.9 Other Relevant Safety Information 
Post-study related safety reports:  
Any SAE  that occurs up to 4 weeks after the completion of the study should be reported by the 
investigator to the Sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of it. Proac tive monitoring for 
post study SAEs is not required. 
If a post study SAE is identified, the investigator should complete an SAE form. Relation to the 
clinical study should be stated on the report. If a patient  dies within up to 45 days  after the last IMP a dministration, this should be reported 
as well, regardless  of being considered treatment -related or not. 
Pregnancies 
Every effort will be made to avoid a pregnancy during the use of an IMP . A pregnancy test will 
be done for all WOCBP to exclude pregnant patients .  
WOCBP is defined as  fertile  woman , following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal 
unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization  methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy . A postmenopausal state  is defined as no menses 
for 12 months without an alternative medical cause.  
Pregnancies occurring during the study ( fetal exposure to the IMP) need to be reported by the 
investigator using  a pregnancy notification form . The form  must be  submit ted to Sponsor and 
Sponsor’s designee following SAE reporting instructions provided in Section 7.3.2. Follow- up information on the outcome of both mother and fetus  will be request ed by a Sponsor 
representative.  
Overdose, interaction, medication error and lack of efficacy : 
The following safety relevant information should be reported as AE or, if the reaction fulfils 
one of the criteri a for seriousness , as SAE.  
Drug overdose:  
An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a tr eatment at a dose higher than 
specified in the protocol and higher than the known therapeutic dose and of clinical relevance. 
The reaction must be clearly identified as an overdose.  
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 04 
No. LEX -209 19-Jan-2018
46 Interaction:  
A drug interaction is a situation in which a substance/medici nal product affects the activity of 
an IMP, i .e., the effects are increased or decreased, or they produce an effect that none of the 
products exhibits on its own. The reaction must be clearly identified as drug interaction. 
Medication error:  
Medication err or involves the inadvertent administration or unintended use of a medicinal 
product which may be caused by the naming, presentation of pharmaceutical form/packaging, 
instructions for use/ labeling . The reaction must be clearly identified as a medication err or. 
7.4 Appropriateness of Measurements  
Since the ultimate goal of the administered treatments is to restore a clinically satisfactory  
hemostasis for the duration of the surgery/invasive procedure, the clinical  assessment of  
hemostatic efficacy provide s the ke y clinical information on  treatment efficacy.  Blinded 
assessment of hemostatic efficacy has therefore been chosen as the primary endpoint. The 
secondary and further exploratory endpoints will provide further information on the clinical comparability of OCT APLEX and Beriplex
® P/N (Kcentra) .

47 8 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING 
8.1 Documentation of Data 
8.1.1 Source Data and Records  
Source data are defined as all the information related to clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in the study, provided in original records or certified copies of original records 
allowing reconstruction and evaluation of the clinical study. 
The investigator will maintain adequate source records (e .g. case histories or patient files for 
each patient enrol led). Source records should be preserved for the maximum period of time 
required by local regulations. For each patient enrol led, the investigator will indicate in the so urce records that the patient 
participates in this study.  
All data entered in the CRF must be supported by source data in the patient records . 
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audit(s), IEC /IRB  review(s) and 
regulatory inspection(s), by providing direct access to source data/records. The investigator may authorize site staff (e .g. sub- investigators, nurses) to enter study data into 
the CRF. This must be documented in the “Delegation of Authority Log” , signed by the 
investigator . 
8.1.2 Case Report Forms  
For each patient enrol led, an electronic CRF (eCRF) will be completed within the Electronic 
Data Capt ure (EDC) system and approved by the investigator or an authorized sub-investigator. 
Study site staff (e .g. research nurse) will be responsible for entering patient data into the 
validated EDC system. All site personnel will be trained on the EDC system a nd study specific 
eCRFs prior to receiving access to the live database for data entr y. The site is also provided 
with the approved eCRF Completion Guidelines which will assist in data entry and data 
issues/questions. The site will be notified once the data base is active to begin data entry. 
Additional site training may be provided as refreshers throughout the study, if needed. All persons allowed to enter or change eCRF data must appear on the delegation of authority log. 
If any errors in the eCRFs are found during the data review process discrepancies will be 
generated programmatically within the EDC system, and ‘manual’ queries will be generated by either a monitor or Data Management. The programmed checks fire automatically once an eCRF page is saved with in the system. The outputs of the programmed checks are  referred to 
as ‘discrepancies’. Discrepancies are generated by the input of illogical eCRF data with the 
purpose to clarify the context  or insertion of illogical or missing data with the site or desig nee. 
All discrepancies (programmed and manual) will be submitted to the site personnel or monitor for the site within the EDC system. Once the site responds to a discrepancy, Data Management or the monitor will review the new or changed data to ensure an appropriate response and close the discrepancy within the system.

No. LEX -209 19-Jan-2018
48 8.1.3 Changes to Case Report Form Data 
Monitors will perform source data verification (SDV) as defined for the study. 
Errors occurring on the EDC system can only be corrected by the investigator(s)  or other 
authoriz ed site personnel. An audit trail documents all changes to the data over the entire study 
period. If data is changed as a result of a query, a comment must be supplied within the query’s 
text, stating the reason for the change, prior to closing. The study monitor should provide guidance to investigators and the investigators' designated representatives on making such corrections. In addition, any changes to a previously saved eCRF page that has not had a query generated will need to have a reason specified for the data change. This is handled within the 
EDC system and relevant prompts appear once any changes are made.  
Once queries have been resolved by the site staff, the resolutions are assessed by Data 
Management . If the query response pr ovided confirms the data as correct, the discrepancy will 
be cl osed. If the response does not adequately address the question raised, a new query will be 
issued for further clarification.  
Manual checks are performed and programs are run throughout the stud y until the data is clean 
and the database is ready for lock. All discrepancies will be resolved prior to database lock. There will be a final run of the programmed checks to ensure all discrepancies are closed out, SDV will be confirmed as complete by the  monitor, and all eCRFs will be approved by the 
investigator prior to database lock. 
8.2 Information of Investigators 
An IB will be handed out to the investigator before the start of the study. This Brochure contains 
all information in the Sponsor’s possession necessary for the investigator to be fully and 
accurately informed about the safety of the IMP under evaluation and the respective benefit -
risk ratio.  
The IB will be updated by the Sponsor at regular intervals and in case new information 
concerning the IMP becomes available.  
The investigators will be informed about the methods for rating relevant study outcomes and 
for completing CRFs in order to reduce discrepancies between participating investigators and study sites.

49 8.4 Investigator ’s Site File 
At each s tudy site, the investigator is responsible for maintaining all records to enable the 
conduct of the study to be fully documented. Essential documents as required by GCP 
guidelines and regulations (e .g., copies of the protocol, study approval letters, all original 
informed consent forms, site copies of all CRFs, drug dispensing and accountability logs, correspondence pertaining to the study, etc.) should be filed accurately and kept by the 
investigator for the maximum period of time required by local regulations. 
The investigator is responsible for maintaining a confidential patient identification code list, 
which provides the unique link between named source records and CRF data for the Sponsor. 
The investigator must arrange for the retention of this confide ntial list for the maximum period 
of time required by local regulations.  
No study document should be destroyed without prior written agreement between the investigator and the Sponsor. Should the investigator elect to assign the study documents to another party, or move them to another location, the Sponsor must be notified in writing. 
8.5 Provision of Additional Information 
On request, the investigator will supply the Sponsor with additional data relating to the study, 
or copies of relevant source recor ds, ensuring that the patient’s confidentiality is maintained. 
This is particularly important when CRFs are illegible or when errors in data transcription are encountered. In case of particular issues or governmental queries, it is also necessary to have access to the complete study recor ds, provided that the patient’s confidentiality is protected in 
accordance with applicable regulations.  
8.6 Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An IDMC will be established by the Sponsor. The IDMC will be composed of recognized experts in the field of clinical care who are not actively recruiting patients  and an independent 
statistician . 
A study specific IDMC charter  will define in detail the composition, responsibilities and 
procedures of the IDMC. 
This Committee will have the follo wing tasks: 
•To review all serious AEs  in a timely manner;
•To review all non- serious AEs  on a regular basis;
•Review interim analysis results and give recommendations whether to continue the study
or not;
•To give advice on the continuation, modification or termination of the study.
The IDMC will have access to the Investigator's Brochure  for Octaplex and the current package 
insert for Beriplex
® P/N (Kcentra) , which includes all the ADRs that have been observed with 
the investigational product.

50 9 STATISTICAL METHODS AND SAMPLE SIZE 
9.1 Determination of Sample Si ze 
The statistical analysis of the primary variable hemostatic success will be based on the 
probabilities of hemostatic success (derived from the blinded rating by the IEAB  of 
OCTAPLEX and  Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  (pO and p K). 
To demonstrate that the treatment with OCTAPLEX is clinically not inferior to the treatment with Beriplex
® P/N (Kcentra)  with respect to hemostatic success, a two -sample, one -sided test 
of the pair of hypotheses: 
H0: p K – p O ≥ δ vs.  H 1: p K – p O < δ 
will be carried out with a type I error probability of α  = 0.025 and clini cal non -inferiority margin 
of δ = 0.15.  
Farrington’s and Manning’s test for difference in proportions will be used to assess the primary 
hypothesis in an interim and in the final analysis.  
Based on this method and a one -sided overall type I error pro bability α  = 0.025, 
power 1 - β = 0.8, and a non- inferiority margin of δ = 0.15, the table below presents the 
estimated sample sizes per treatment group for the one -sided testing problem taking into 
account one planned i nterim analysis after half of the planned patients are enrol led for different 
constel lations of OCTAPLEX and Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  hemostatic success probabilities. 
The calculations are based on the following additional assumptions: 
•A multiple one -sided significance level (family -wise error rate) of 0.025 for the
interim and final analysis
•An α-spending function according to Hwang, Shi and Cani (11)  with parameter γ= -
0.8 which allows an early efficacy stop if p <0.01.
•A β-spending function according to Hwang, Shi and Cani (11) with parameter γ= -
4.584 which allows a non-binding futility stop if p> 0.5.

Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  hemostatic su ccess probability of at most 89%, it is planned to enrol 
185 patients in each treatment arm, i.e. 370 patients in total.  
Assuming a proportion of about 10% randomized patients who were not treated or did not 
undergo the surgical procedure for administrative reasons;  this would ensure that data on at

No. LEX -209 19-Jan-2018
51 least 166 patients per treatment group in the modified ITT  (mITT)  population will be available 
for the final statistical analysis as derived from the sample size calculation.  
9.2 Statistical Analysis  
A formal statistical analysis plan  (SAP)  describi ng all details of the analyses to be performed 
will be prepared by the study statistician and approved by the Sponsor prior to the start of the 
statistical analysis.  
9.2.1 Population for Analysis 
The randomized population (RAND) will include all randomized patients irrespective of whether they received treatment.  This is the intent- to-treat (ITT) population according to the 
most rigid definition of ITT.   
The safety analysis population (SAF) will include all randomized patients who received at least 
one dose of IM P. Patients receiving different study treatments than originally randomized will 
be considered according to the treatment actually received (rather than that of the original randomization). 
For further statistical analysis of the efficacy parameters, a mod ified Intention -to-Treat 
population (mITT) is defined: All randomized patients who received at least one infusion of 
IMP, and who had the surgery initiated or for whom the surgery was not initiated for medical reasons related to insufficient coagulation . Patients in whom the surgery was not initiated due 
to technical reasons /aesthesia/etc (i.e., not related to insufficient coagulation) will be excluded 
from the mITT, whereas patients in whom the surgery was not initiated for coagulation- related  
reasons will  be considered as treatment failures.  
The Per-protocol (PP) population: This analysis population will consist of all patients in the 
mITT population, excluding patients  with major protocol deviations potentially affecting the 
primary endpoint. The following patients will be excluded:  
•Patients who receive an IMP different to the IMP assigned by randomization
•Patients who receive less than 70% of the planned dose
•Patients who significantly violate inclusion/exclusion criteria
•Patients with missing primary eff icacy assessment
•Start of surgery more than 5 hours after end of infusion of IMP
A final decision about the classification of protocol deviations as major and minor and their consequences regarding assignment of patients to analysis populations will be made during the blinded data review meetings prior to unblinding  of patient cohorts for the interim and final 
analyses. Decisions and outcome will be approved by the Sponsor.  
The analysis of safety will be based on the SAF . 
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on all randomized subjects (RAND=ITT).

No. LEX -209 19-Jan-2018
52 9.2.2 In addition the primary endpoint will also be analysed using  the mITT and the PP 
population. Efficacy Analysis Plan 
9.2.2.1 Primary Endpoint: Hemostatic Efficacy  
The primary efficacy variable is the hemostatic efficacy as assessed by the IEAB . The 
hemostatic efficacy is to be assessed  based on objective criteria in the categories 'excellent', 
'good', 'moderate' or 'none'. Ratings of 'excellent' and 'good' will be considered as 'effective' 
hemostasis, while a rating o f 'moderate' and 'none' will be considered as 'ineffective' hemostasis. 
The dichotomous 'hemostatic success' variable will be used in the analyses.   This variable will 
be imputed as ‘ineffective’ under the following two circumstances: 
•If hemostatic efficac y value is missing, then hemostatic efficacy  will be considered
‘none’ for the analysis.  This can occur in the RAND population if the patient is
randomized and not treated (or does not undergo surgery), also in the mITT populationif the patient is treate d but does not undergo surgery due to insufficient coagulation.
•If patient receives  additional coagulation treatment (e.g. PCC, single coagulation
factors, plasma) after initial IMP infusion, then hemostatic efficacy  will be considered
‘none’ for the anal ysis.
To demonstrate that treatment with OCTAPLEX is clinically not inferior to treatment with 
Beriplex
® P/N (Kcentra)  with respect to hemostatic success, a two -sample, one -sided test of the 
pair of hypotheses: 
H0: p K – p O ≥ δ (inferiority)  
vs.  H 1: p K – p O < δ (non- inferiority)  
will be carried out with a type I error probability of α  = 0.025 and clinical non- inferiority margin 
of δ = 0.15. Whereby pO and p K present the probabilities of hemostatic success of OCTAPLEX 
and B eriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  respectively . 
Farrington’s and Manning’s test for difference in proportions will be used to assess the primary hypothesis in an interim and in the final analysis. One -sided p- values and the corresponding 
nominal and repeated CIs for the difference in hemostatic success probabilities will be 
presented.  
The primary analysis will be performed on the RAND population. Additional analyses will be 
performed for the mITT and the PP population. 
In case of non- inferiority in the RAND, mITT and the PP population a  “tipping point” analysis 
will be done to determine the robustness of the result s. Iteratively p atients excluded from the 
RAND/ mITT /PP analysis assigned to the control arm will be considered as  treatment successes, 
and patients excluded from the RAND/ mITT /PP analysis and assigned to the O CTAPLEX  arm 
will be considered as  treatment failures, to determine the number of such imputed outcomes 
required to “tip” the study result from positive to negative in the randomized population. 
A sensitiv ity analysis  will be conducted in the RAND, m ITT, and PP populations based on the 
hemostatic efficacy rating by  the investigators at the end of surgery.  
A concordance analysis will be done to assess the agreement between the assessment by the IEAB  and the investigator assessment.

No. LEX -209 19-Jan-2018
53 9.2.2.2 Secondary Endpoints  
The following measurements will be considered as exploratory secondary endpoints in the 
analysis of the efficacy of the study treatments:  
•Proportion of patients with an INR value of less or equal to 1.5 to 30 minutes
(± 15 minutes) after the end of infusion.
•Chang e in coagulation factor levels  from baseline to 30 minutes (± 15 minutes) after the
end of infusion:
oFactor FII
oFactor FVII
oFactor FIX
oFactor FX
•Proportion of patients receiving RBC during the surgery
The primary analysis of secondary endpoints will be based on the ITT population, except for 
the proportion of patients receiving RBC  during surgery, this will be based on subset of patients 
undergoing surgery. Additionally the same analyses will be done on the mITT and PP 
populations. 
Farrington’s and Manning’s test for difference in proportions will be used to test the secondary 
variables on proportions. Point estimates and two- sided 95% CIs will be presented in addition 
to descriptive statistics for these  endpoints.  
The change in the individual coagulation factors from baseline to end of infusion will be tested with the Wilcoxon rank- sum test between OCTAPLEX and Beriplex
® P/N (Kcentra) . The 
Hodges- Lehmann estimat or of the median difference of the intra -individual change in the 
individual coagulation factors from baseline to end of infusion between OCTAPLEX and 
Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra)  and the corresponding 95% CI will be calculated.  
9.2.2.3 Further Exploratory E ndpoints  
Analysis of the further exploratory endpoints  will be done on the ITT, mITT, and PP  population 
unless indicated otherwise. All analyses will be exploratory, by presenting descriptive statistics.  
•Change in INR from baseline.
•Change in PC, and PS from baseline to the end of infusion.
•Change in coagulat ion factor levels (FII, FVII, FIX, FX, PC, and PS) from baseline to
2 h, 4 h, 12 h and 24 h after end of infusion
•Assessment of blood loss after end of surgery.
•Proportion of patients receiving plasma and platelets transfusions initiated during the
surgery.
•Total volume  of RBC and other blood product  transfusions initiated during the surgery
normalized by patient's BW.
•Change in hematological parameters ( Hgb, Hct, RBC, WBC, platelets) from the
beginning to the end of the surgery.
•RBC transfusion corrected c hange from baseline in Hgb at 12 and 24 hours after start
of surgery
•Proportion of patients experiencing surgical wound hematoma requiring surgicalevacuation

54 •Ratio of actual estimated blood loss as documented after surgery to the pre -operative
predicted  blood loss for the type of planned surgery
9.2.2.4 Subgroup Analyses for Efficacy  
To study the sensitivity of the efficacy results subgroup analysis will be performed for the 
primary and the secondary efficacy endpoints based on the following characteristics: 
•expected blood loss (“≥200 mL”, “≥100 mL but <200 mL” or “≥50 mL but
<100 mL”)  according to information provided at randomisation
•type of planned surgery (“ orthopaedic surgery ”, “cardiothoracic surgery ” or “other
surgery ”)gender (male/female)
•age in years (<=6 0, 60+)
•race
•history of TEE (yes/no)
•baseline INR (2 to <4 / 4 to <6 / ≥6)
•concomitant treatment with Vitamin K (yes/no)
These subgroup analyses are considered to be exploratory and will involve no type I error 
adjustment. The subgroup analyses will be based on the primary analysis  population for 
efficacy . 
9.2.3 Safety Analysis Plan 
Safety analyses will be performed for the SAF.  
9.2.3.1 Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded according to the latest MedDRA version as specified in the Data 
Management Plan . The analysis will focus on treatment emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ), i.e., 
AEs that started or worsened after start of infusion with IMP. All TEAEs, related TEAEs  (i.e. 
AEs probably or possibly related to the IMP ), and serious TEAEs will be summar ized and 
tabulated according to primary system organ class and preferred term. TEAEs leading to death and TEAEs resulting in withdrawal from the study , respectively, will be tabulated using 
frequency tables if a reasonable number of events of this type are observed. 
Patient listings will be provided for patients with SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal from study , 
and AEs leading to death. The listings will also include patients enrol led but not randomized. 
9.2.3.2 Thromboembolic E vents 
The number of patients with TEE s overall and  within 3, 21 and 45 days after end of surgery  
will be summarized. A possible difference between treatment groups will be estimated by a risk 
ratio with 95% CI. Kaplan- Meier estimates for time to first occurrence of a TEE event will be 
calculated and graphically presented.  
9.2.3.3 Mortality  
The number of patients who died overall and within 3, 21 and 45 days after end of surgery  will 
be summarized. A possible difference between treatment groups will be estimated by a risk

No. LEX -209 19-Jan-2018
55 ratio with 95% CI. Kaplan -Meier estimates for time to death will be calculated and graphically 
presented.  
9.2.3.4 Routine Laboratory D ata 
All laboratory values will be classified as normal or abnormal according to the laboratories’ 
normal ranges and indicated as clinically significant or not clinically significant by the investigator. The following approaches will be taken for each laboratory parameter for the 
statistical analysis:  
•Quantitative data will be examined for trends using descriptive analysis (number ofpatients, number of missing values, mean, SD, median, quarti les, minimum, maximum) of
actual values at each visit and changes from baseline to each visit over time
•Qualitative data based on reference ranges will be described according to the categories
(i.e., low, normal, high)
•Shift tables illustrating changes with respect to the laboratories’ normal ranges betweenbaseline and a defined visit
•Number and frequency of patients with clinically significant laboratory values. A separatepatient listing will be provided
9.2.3.5 Vital Signs 
Blood pressure (systolic/diastolic), pulse rate, and body temperature will be presented by time 
point. 
9.2.3.6 Viral Safety  
The incidence of Parvovirus B19 seroconversion will be calculated. Parvovirus B19 
seroconversion is defined as the percentage of patients who have a positive post -baseline value 
but were negative at baseline. Seroconversion rates will be by treatment group both for s erology 
and nucleic acid tests . 
9.2.3.7 Subgroup Analyses for Safety  
Subgroup analysis will be performed for overall number of TEAEs, related TEAEs and serious 
TEAEs, overall TEE and mortality rates based on the following characteristics:  
•any TEE in medical history
•occurrence of any TEE within  1 year prior to surgery (yes/no),
•gender (male/female),
•baseline INR (2 to <4 / 4 to <6 / ≥ 6),
•concomitant treatment with vitamin K (yes /no)
These subgroup analyses are considered to be exploratory and will involve no type I error 
adjustment.

No. LEX -209 19-Jan-2018
56 9.2.4 Handling of Missing Data 
In general, missing data will not be imputed. 
Patients for whom the primary efficacy endpoint ‘hemostatic success’ can’t be assessed will be 
considered as having clinical hemostasis rated as “none”.   This efficacy analysis is perform ed 
with the RAND population (as primary), and additionally with the mITT and PP. 
9.3 Randomization / Stratification  / Code Release  
The IMPs will be administered only to patients for whom a signed written IC form is available . 
Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive either OCTAPLEX or Beriplex® P/N 
(Kcentra) . To ensure balance between the two treatment groups with respect to type of surge ry, 
estimated blood loss  and history of TEE, randomization will be stratified by type of surgery , 
estimated blood loss and presence or absence of TEE in the medical history. 
Randomization will be implemented by site staff using a n IRT system. Randomization allocation 
will be 1:1 to OCTAPLEX or Beriplex® P/N (Kcentra) , respectively.  
Patients will be identified using a sequential numbering system. 
9.4 Interim Analysis 
The study employs a sequential design that allows one pre -planned interim analysis using the 
data from the first 50% of randomized patients. The interim analysis will be performed on the 
cohort of the first 185 randomized patients after documentation of the primary endpoint has 
been  performed.  
The interim analysis will focus on the analysis of hemostatic success probabilities based on the independent adjudication in the ITT population. The allocation of patients in the ITT population  
will be done in a blinded  data review meeting prior to unblinding. 
After the interim analysis, a positive outcome for non- inferiority test may be claimed and 
enrollment  may be stopped if the primary test statistic in the ITT population is greater than the 
adjusted critical value z
1 = 2.33 corresponding to an adjusted significance level of α 1 = 0.01 
(efficacy stop). If a p -value > 0.5 is observed, the study may be stopped for futility (non-binding 
futility stop). The worst effect of a possible overrunning on the final result will be assessed if the result suggests a termination of the study. Individual patient data relevant to the interpretation of interim results will be listed.  
The interim analysis will be performed by a statistical team which is independent from the study team. An IDMC will be established to review the interim analysis results and give recommendations whether to continue the study or not. 
Details on the composition and charter of the IDMC will be provided before study start. A final 
analysis including all study data will be performed  and reported if enrollment  is stopped after 
the interim analysis. Otherwise, the study will continue until the maximum sample size is reached, and the final analysis will be performed as described above.  
Further details of the interim analysis will be des cribed in the respective sections of the SAP.

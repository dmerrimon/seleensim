ABSTRACT  
 
HIV-associated neuropathic pain (HIV -NP) affects a significant proportion of people living with 
HIV (PLWH) and has a major impact on everyday functioning and quality of life in this 
population. Over the past decade a growing number of preclinical studies a nd clinical trials have 
indicated that cannabis administration and manipulation of the endocannabinoid (EC) system 
may have therapeutic utility in addressing HIV -NP. EC CB2 receptor activation and inhibition of 
the EC deactivation enzymes fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacyglycerol lipase 
(MAGL) have been shown to decrease pain in rodent models of HIV -NP, while acute exposure 
to cannabis reduces self -reported pain in PLWH with neuropathy. However, little work has been 
conducted to elucidate the ef fects of the two primary cannabinoids (delta -9-
tetrahydrocannabinol, THC and cannabidiol, CBD) on the EC system or to assess EC function 
in PLWH. The objective of this application is to address these fundamental gaps in our 
knowledge by: 1) examining the a cute effect of administering NIDA -prepared THC/CBD 
products on HIV -NP; 2) utilizing mHealth text messaging to monitor daily real -world self -
administered cannabis effects on pain; 3) assessing the relationship between cannabinoids and 
EC biomarkers, includi ng ligands, enzymes, and receptor expression; and 4) conducting 
exploratory analyses to evaluate the effect of longitudinal cannabinoid use on changes in HIV -
NP over time. We will  examine the ef fect of low (0.01%), medium (one vial of 5.1 %), and high 
dose (two vials of 5.1% ) CBD -containing cannabis on NP, the EC system , and heart rate 
variability (as a proposed objective b iological measure of pain) in 10 0 PLWH who use cannabis 
to treat neuropathic pain. We will subsequently employ a mobile phone text messaging system, 
the Individual Monitoring of Pain And Cannabis Taken (IMPACT), to track cannabis exposure, 
CBD and THC consumption, and pain over a period of 6 months in these same PLWH 
participants. IMPACT will be used quantify the real -time effects of acute CBD/THC exposure on 
pain before and after cannabis self -administ ration, the real -time relationship between self -
reported pain and changes in HRV, and to assess any longitudinal changes in NP, HIV clinical 
outcomes (viral load, CD4) and cognition during the 6 -month period. This plan allows us to 
acquire data and compare  the effects of cannabis product obtained from NIDA and self -
administered cannabis obtained from local medicinal dispensaries. The overarching hypothesis 
is that CBD exposure and a higher CBD/THC ratio will exert beneficial effects both in the 
laboratory a nd during the observational study, including increasing EC biomarkers and reducing 
NP. In summary, this approach will advance our understanding about several key issues, 
including the interaction between cannabis constituents, the EC system and pain, the b iological 
mechanisms that underlie these effects (EC enzymes, receptor), and the longer -term effects of 
cannabis use on health -related outcomes in HIV, including predictors of mortality (HRV, CD4, 
viral load) and neurocognition.

Effect of Cannabis Administration and Endocannabinoids on HIV Neuropathic Pain  
 
 
DESIGN : Our objective is to assess PLWH who have neuropathic pain and are currently using 
cannabis, including light use (1 -4 times per month) and heavy use (5+ times per month). These 
participants will be enrolled in a study that consists of two stages : Stage 1 ) PLWH will 
participate in a 6 -month  mHealth text messaging program  (Individual Monitoring of Pain and 
Cannabis Taken, or IMPACT) that will examine the association between cannabis  obtained from 
local dispensaries and changes in daily pain. Participants will return for a visit after 6 months for 
follow -up testing so we can examine longitudinal changes in neuropathic pain,  
neuropsychological performance and EC function. Stage  2) A double blind cross over study 
where we  administer three different doses of vaporized cannabis to each participant that contain 
THC and varying concentrat ions of CBD (low, medium, high) , including : a) 2 vials of 0.01% CBD  
+ 1.9% THC , b) 1 vial of 0.01% CBD  + 1.9% THC and 1 vial of 5.1 % CBD  + 1.4% THC, and c)  2 
vials of 5.1% CBD  + 1.4% THC . Here we will examine the acute effects of cannabis obtained 
from NIDA on pain intensity, blood endocannabinoid (EC) levels, and the relationship of pain 
with heart rate variability (HRV).

1.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
HIV-associated neuropathic pain (HIV -NP) affects a significant proportion of people living with 
HIV (PLWH) and is one of the leading causes of disability in this population. Acute cannabis 
administration is reported to alleviate HIV -NP, but we have limited knowledge about the effects 
of cannabis constituents (THC and cannabidiol/CBD), the consequences of long -term cannabis 
use, and the impact of cannabis on endocannabinoid (EC) function in PLWH. Our objective is to 
address these three fundamenta l gaps in our knowledge by: 1) examining the acute effects of 
various CBD/THC products on HIV -NP, 2) utilizing a mHealth text messaging protocol 
(Individual Monitoring of Pain and Cannabis Taken or IMPACT) to monitor daily real -world 
cannabis use and chang es in pain; 3) studying the relationship between cannabinoids, EC 
biomarkers, and chronic neuropathic pain.  
 
1.1 Background  
 
HIV-related neuropathic pain (HIV -NP) represents a significant problem for PLWH.  HIV sensory 
neuropathy (HIV -SN), typically characterized by sensory deficits, numbness, tingling, or pain in 
feet or hands, is a common health concern in people living with HIV (PLWH)1. HIV -SN is often 
associated with neuropathic pain (NP) described as “stabbing”, “burning” or “aching” that is the 
most frequent source of HIV -SN disability2, while the prevalence of reported pain in PLWH 
ranges from 27 to 97%3. A large scale study by our group indicated that 57% (881 out of 1539 
PLWH) exhibited HIV -SN and 38% reported HIV -NP4. Treatment of HIV -NP remains difficult; a 
2010 review indicated that only capsaicin, human nerve growth factor, and smoked cannabis 
showed superior pain reduction compared to placebo5. Studies at the University of California 
Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research (CMCR) indicate that 34 -40% of patients exposed to 
cannabis cigarettes with delta -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) exhibited significant pain reduction 
compared to 17 -20% on place bo6-8. While THC doses in the 1.3% to 3.5% range alleviate pain 
for some participants, higher doses of THC (7 -8%) did not provide additional benefit for pain 
reduction8 or actually increased capsaicin -induced pain in healthy volunteers9. Importantly, 
combined cannabidiol (CBD)/THC extracts are reported to be more effective at treating pain 
compared to THC alone in human cancer -related pain and in rodents10, 11. CBD exhibits 
antioxidant and neuroprotective properties, inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines such 
as TNFα12. However, the optimal THC/CBD ratio for effective pain treatment is not yet known. 
There may also be discrepancies between data obtained from controlled clinical trials and the 
use of unregulated cannabis obtained from dispensaries. There is thus a clear need to close the 
gap between existing clinical data and real -life cannabis use from public sources, including the 
effects on the endocannabinoid (EC) system and NP.  
 
Endocannabinoids reduce pain and modulate neuronal activity at synapses throughout pain 
processing pathways , but the effect of cannabis on the EC system is understudied  13. The EC 
system includes two receptors, CB1 and CB2, and two primary ligands, N -
arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) and 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG), which are deactivated by 
the enzymes fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), 
respectively14, 15. EC ligands act as a negative feedback system that inhibits the release of pro -
inflammatory cytokines and reduces neuronal signaling in response to pain13, 15, 16. Elevated 
 7  
  
  
   
 
peripheral levels of AEA and 2 -AG occur in preclinical pain models13 and FAAH and MAGL 
inhibitors produce antinociceptive effects in rodent models of acute and chronic pain17, 18. Mice 
lacking CB2 receptors also show enhanced pain responses to sciatic nerve ligation19. Despite 
the reported benefits of acute cannabis treatment for pain, chronic cannabis use may disrupt EC 
function20. Heavy cannabis use (several days per week) reduces EC ligand levels21 and CB1 
and CB2 expression in both humans and mice22-25. Psychotic patients with heavy cannabis use 
exhibited decreased CB2 and increased FAAH in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) 
compared to healthy controls22, while  increased AEA in cannabis -naïve schizophrenia patients 
was completely blocked by cannabis use20. Cannabis use may disrupt EC function, but little is 
known about the specific effects of THC and CBD. One study in schizophrenia patients reported 
that 4 weeks of administered CBD increased plasma AEA and reduced FAAH26. Preclinical and 
in vitro  data show that CBD may increase AEA expression by inhibiting both neuronal uptake 
and FAAH activity27. In contrast, THC, but not CBD, is a strong CB1 and CB2 receptor agonist28, 
29 and could represent the primary cannabis constituent that disrupts EC function. Overall, these 
data suggest that THC and CBD may have differential effects on EC activity, a question that 
requires investigation in a real -world setting of chronic cannabis u se. 
 
Pain is typically assessed by self -report, but the field would benefit from the use of biological 
measures sensitive to HIV -NP. Common pain measures include the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), 
where individuals mark their level of pain on a 10 cm line from “no pain” to “worst pain” and the 
Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), a 0 -10 scale with similar endpoints5. In contrast to self -
report, suggested metrics of objective pain such as fMRI neuroimaging remain in 
development30. Another proposed option, heart rate variability (HRV), is a measure of 
autonomic function closely related to pain self -report and analgesic efficacy31-34. HRV quantifies 
the beat -to-beat variation in heart rate and provides a measure of sympathetic and 
parasympathetic tone. Healthy individuals exhibit higher HRV, but HRV is significantly lower in 
PLWH35-37, correlates with the level of pain intensity in chronic fibromyalgia38, and improved 
HRV after biofeedback is associated with less pain on VAS39. Persons with effective analgesic 
treatment of chronic pain exhibited improved HRV relative to pain sufferers with ineffective 
treatment32, suggesting HRV may serve as a pain biomarker.  
 
The effects of cannabis on health outcomes and cognition in HIV remain unclear.  Despite 
prevalent cannabis use, there are significant concerns that drug exposure may impair cognition 
and affect everyday functioning40-42. Chronic cannabis use is associated with cognitive deficits 
across a wide range of domains (memory, attention, executive function)43-45, but little is known 
about the potential neuropathology46. Preclinical studies indicate that CBD may have beneficial 
effects on cognition, including rescuing memory impairment in a mouse model of malaria47, 
improving object recognition in a model of Alzheimer’s disease48, and attenuating visuospatial 
deficits induced by THC in rhesus monkeys49, but CBD exposure effects in PLWH are not 
known. Similarly, the effects of CBD and THC on measures of disease state, such as CD4 level 
and viral load, are not well understood. Rhesus macaques exposed to THC for 6 months 
exhibited lower viral load after infection with simian immunodeficiency virus50, while daily 
cannabis use was associated with lower viral load among recently seroconverted PLWH when 
compared to less frequent use51. However, THC and CBD exposure was not reported in this 
study and remains an important and understudied issue in this field.  
 
mHealth text messaging will serve as a useful tool to monitor the relationship between pain and 
 8  
  
  
   
 
cannabis use.  Text messaging is an effective method to modify health behaviors, monitor 
substance use, and track pain52. Our group has recently demonstrated the feasibility of using 
short message service (SMS) texting to promote ART adherence and monitor daily 
methamphetamine (METH) use in PLWH with bipolar disorder or METH dependence, but SMS 
has not been used to assess c annabis exposure in this population53, 54. There are a variety of 
cannabis mobile apps providing information on strain and dispensary information, but none that 
address abuse, addiction, or treatment55. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA), the 
technique of gathering data within a participant’s environment using multiple assessments56, 
has been applied to alcohol and cigarette use57, but few studies have examined cannabis. We 
will utilize a novel text messaging protocol, Individual Monitoring of Pain And Cannabis Taken 
(IMPACT), to assess the relationship between real -world self -administered cannabis and 
changes in pain symptoms that precede and follow drug exposure.  
 
 
2.0 STUDY DESIGN   
 
Our objective is to assess 100  community -dwelling PLWH with neuropathic pain (PLWH -NP) 
who are recruited and tested at the HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program (HNRP)/Center for 
Medicinal Cannabis Research (CMCR) facilities located at the UCSD Medical Center. These 
participants will be  enrolled in a study that consists of two stages : 1) administration of three 
different doses of vaporized cannabis obtained from NIDA (one dose per day on three separate 
days) that contain THC and varying concentrations of CBD,  including : a) 2 vials of 0.01% CBD  + 
1.9% THC , b) 1 vial of 0.01% CBD  + 1.9% THC and 1 vial of 5.1 % CBD  + 1.4% THC, and c)  2 
vials of 5.1 % CBD  + 1.4% THC ; 2) participation in a 6 -month text message monitoring study, 
the Individual Monitoring of Pain and Cannabis Taken (IMPACT), where pain and cannabis use 
from local dispensaries is tracked.  We will use a randomized cross over design where all 
participants receive each of the three cannabis doses at the HNRP and then are subsequently 
enrolled into IMPACT. We will recruit individuals who are currently using cannabis at least once 
a month to treat pain. The primary outcome me asures of the study will examine: 1) the acute 
effects of NIDA -obtained cannabis on pain, EC levels, and the relationship with HRV (Aim 1); 2) 
the assoc iation between dispensary -obtained cannabis and changes in pain reported via 
IMPACT (Aim 2); 3) the effect of chronic THC and CBD exposure on longitudinal changes in 
pain, EC measures, and neurocognitive performance  (Aim 3) . Secondary and exploratory 
analyses will compare NIDA -obtained and dispensary -obtained cannabis effects on neuropathic 
pain and evaluate if there are different effects of reported cannabis stra in (Sativa, Indica), specific 
cannabis products  (e.g., OG Kush, Sour Lemon, etc.), or mode (smo king, vaporizing, ingesting 
food product) on pre -post drug exposure changes  in pain

We will be administering three cannabis doses to each participant using the vaporizer, including 
varying concentrat ions of CBD (low, medium, high):  a) 2 vials of 0.01% CBD  + 1.9% THC , b) 1 
vial of 0.01% CBD  + 1.9% THC and 1 vial of 5.1 % CBD  + 1.4% THC, and c)  2 vials of 5.1% 
CBD  + 1.4% THC . 
 
 10  
  
  
   
 
4.2 Cannabis Administration Protocol  
 
Participants will receive vaporized cannabis using Volcano vaporizers (Storz and  Bickel ) with 
the aforementioned concentrations of CBD and THC at each of three visits. Allocation 
assignment of visits will be assigned using randomization schedule prepared by our statistician . 
The allocation schedule will be kept in the pharmacy and concealed from other study personnel. 
The cannabis will be stored in a freezer at 20°C until the day before use. At least  12 hours 
before each session, 8 00 mg of study cannabis will be thawed. The vaporization session will be 
performed in a HNRP negative pressure  room designed to prevent the vapor from being 
transferred to rooms in which other occupants of the 
building are working. Puffs from the vaporizer balloon will 
be standardized so that a cons istent amount is inhaled. 
This will be done according to a cued -smoking procedure 
shown to produce r eliable increases in plasma THC 
levels65. A nurse will provide instructions to participants to 
‘inhale’ (5 seconds), ‘hold smoke in lungs’ (10 seconds), 
and ‘exhale’ and to wait before repeating the puff cycle (40 seconds). Each participant will 
inhale 4 puffs at each session, an amount that was well tolerated during our previous human 
laboratory experiments 60. We will measure vital signs (heart rate, respiration), pain intensity 
measured by a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale, and HRV at baseline (30 minutes before 
cannabis administration), at time zero (immediately after cannabis administration), and at 60, 
120, a nd 180 minutes after drug administration. As a secondary measu re of pain relief, we will 
use the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) that will be measured hourly following 
administration of study medications. We will also conduct a von Frey assessment. The von Frey 
tool consists of monofilaments that are applied to the skin until bending of the filament occurs, 
calibrated to a specific pressure and designed to minimize movement artifacts66. Increased pain 
to von Frey stimulation occurs in NP and clinical trials indicate that cannabis treatment can 
reduce allodynia on this test67. We will include this measure in our battery and assess pain 
using the VAS as previously reported67; the von Frey filament will be applied on the dorsum of 
the more painful foot until bending is observed for 3 seconds, followed by a VAS pain rating.  
 
To assess participant perception of drug effects, the Marijuana subscale (M -scale) of the 
Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI) will be administered68. The M -scale has 12 
true/false statements describing the subjective effects of marijuana (see attached ARCI 
Marijuana subscale). We have elected not to include a placebo in the current design because 
participants with prior cannabis use are likely to be a ware they are not receiving the drug, given 
the lack of psychoactive/physiological effects, and this may confound their report of pain. We 
have also chosen  to administer one fixed dose (8  puffs) to all participants to avoid the confound 
of varying levels of drug intake. Participants will be allowed to engage in normal activities, such 
as reading or listening to music between assessments.  Participants will remain in the laboratory 
under direct observation by nursing staff for 3.5 hours after the vaporization  inhalations are 
completed (30 minutes aft er the 180 -minute sample collection). At that time a final vital sign 
status check will be made and upon satisfactory readings, the subject will be released and 
driven back to his/her domicile by taxicab or prearranged transportation.

4.3.   IMPACT  
 
All participants will be instructed on how to use the IMPACT text messaging/website survey 
program, practice the SMS interface with study staff, and set up personalized preferences (e.g., 
optimal times to receive messages). If they do not have a cell phone capable of receiving and 
sending text and picture messages, one will be provided to them at the baseline session  and we 
will purchase  bulk ‘minutes’ in order to provide the text message intervention. Participants will 
also receive digital milligram scales that they can use to weigh out cannabis products, including 
joints, blunts, and bowls. Participants will not be required to use the scales, but they will be 
provided as an optional tool to improve the accuracy of reporting cannabis quantity. Participants 
will not be responsible should they lose or break the devices. We will also ask participants to 
identify the source of their cannabis products, including the name of the medical dispensary 
where the product was obtained. If the participant obtained cannabis  from another source, such 
as a neighbor or friend, this source will be anonymously identified as “friend”. We will not collect 
any names or any identifying information about any specific individuals who provide cannabis to 
the participant; only the names of medical dispensaries in San Diego will be collected. 
Participants will also not be required to disclose the source of the cannabis and may select an 
option of “decline to provide” or “I do not know” or “unknown” when asked about this information. 
(45 mi nutes) . After the 6 -month IMPACT is completed, participants will return for a visit that will 
include the same assessments during the pre -entry visit, including a medical exam with 
neuropathy testing, assessment of substance use, administration of pain rating scal es, 
neurocognitive testing, and a blood draw to repeat baseline evaluations including THC, CBD, 
and EC biomarkers and check hepatic/renal function. We will not administer cannabis at this 
session, and similar to the pre -entry visit, request that participan ts abstain from cannabis for 24 
hours before this visit.  
 
 
5.0 CLINICAL MANAGEMENT ISSUES  
 
5.1 Adverse Events   
 
The medical response to adverse events (AE) or serious adverse events (SAE)  will be managed 
and assessed under the on -site direction of our medical team . An AE is defined as any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure regardless of 
whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure.  An SAE is defined as the 
following: a n AE that results in death, is life -threatening (even if temporary in nature), results in 
a permanent impairment of body function or permanent damage to body structure, 
hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, or medical or surgi cal intervention to preclude 
permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure, or 
represent s a serious medical event.  
 
AE associated with acute cannabis exposure may include the following: 1) l ikely effects: 
difficulty with balance, eye irritation, throat irritation, increased heart rate, possible low blood 
pressure , reversible problems with appetite ; 2) less likely effects: changes in mood (euphoria or 
dysphoria ), loss of memory, decreased ability to concentrate or think properly ; 3) rare but 
 12  
  
  
   
 
serious effects: dizziness, head and chest pressure, disorientation, agitation, combativeness, 
incoherence, or visual hallucinations.  
If requested by the research team , a personal assessment of the participant will be performed.  
Participants will be followed by the research team until such time as the adverse event resolves.  
A Registered Nurse and/or research associate will consult with study PIs to discuss each 
adverse event. In the event of any uncertainty, the decision as to whether or not the adverse 
event is to be labeled a SAE will be made by a Medical Officer . If deemed not to be a SAE, the 
AE will be reported at the time of the UCSD IRB continuing review or annual review by the FDA 
and NIDA.   
 
All AEs will be collected on an Adverse Event log which will include the Patient ID, date, visit 
number, time in 24-hour format, description of adverse event, date of resolution if applicable, 
determination if related to the study, and date reported to UCSD IRB and study sponsor (NIDA). 
All AEs experienced by the participant, i.e., from the time of study drug administration through 
the end of the study, will be reported on this log. Any AE or SAE so recorded will be reported 
annually to the Human Research P rotection Program (HRPP) at UCSD. In the event of an SAE,  
the PIs will report SAE to the UCSD IRB within 10 days as required by the HRPP . Such data will 
also be promptly reported to NIDA . Any AE and SAE reported may result in revisions to the study 
protocol. If so, these revisions will be submitted to the UCSD IRB for review. Any unexpected fatal  
or life threatening experiences associated with the use of the drug (21 CFR  312[.32[c] [ii] [2]) will 
be reported to the FDA via telephone or facsimile transmission within 7 calendar days after 
NIDA’s initial receipt of the information. In accordance with FDA Code of Federal Regulations, 
the investigators will be responsible for reporting of SAE's directly to the FDA using the 
mandatory reporting form FDA 3500A.  
 
 
5.2 Toxicity   
 
Our group  has previously administered  a similar  dose of THC (3.5%) to participants in prior 
studies using both cigarettes (Wilsey B, Marcotte T, Tsodikov A, et al. A randomized, placebo -
controlled, crossover trial of cannabis cigarettes in neuropathic pain. J Pain. Jun 2008;9(6):506 -
521) and vaporized cannabis (Wilsey B, Marcotte T, Deutsch R, Gouaux B, Sakai S, Donaghe 
H. Low -dose vaporized cannabis significantly improves neuropathic pain. J Pain. Feb 
2013;14(2):136 -148). In both studies his findings indicated that none of the participants 
receiving 3.5% THC exhibited any  AE or SAE  due to drug exposure.   Based  on the data he has 
collected, we do not anticipate AE or SAE due to acute THC exposure in the current study 
(1.4% to 1.9%). In addition, we will be recruiting participants with a history of cannabis use 
rather than cannabis -naïve individ uals; therefore, there is also lower  risk of a novel AE or SAE 
occurring in these participants.  
 
CBD does not bind to the known cannabinoid receptors and its mechanism of action is yet 
unknown86. The administration of CBD appears to be much less problematic compared to THC. 
In a recent study comparing oral THC, CBD, and placebo in healthy volunteers87, CBD was well 
tolerated and there were no differences between oral CBD and placebo on symptomatic or 
physiological variables. Other work suggest s that CBD may in fact attenuate some of the 
psychoactive effects of THC88-90. After an extensive literature review, Bergamaschi and 
 13  
  
  
   
 
colleagues concluded that CBD is a substance with low toxicity91. Based on these findings, we 
do not anticipate that there will be AE or SAE due to acute CBD administration in the study. 
However, no specific research on vaporized combinations of THC/CBD has been performed  
and we will collect data at every visit on any adverse effects that occur.  
 
5.3 Monitoring Participant Safety  
 
Ongoing medical treatment for HIV will not be altered or modified in any way for research 
purposes.  During the initial enrollment and screening process, participants will be informed 
about potential events that may occur as a result of cannabis exposure and will be asked to 
contact the staff if any adverse events occur during study participation. Vital signs will be 
monitored during the cannabis administration procedure at hourly intervals to monitor the 
participant’s health status . At any sign of an adverse reaction (e.g. a change in blood pressure 
or heart  rate or development of psych ological distress), medical s taff will be contacted. 
Participants will be monitored by medical staff until such time as the adverse event resolves.  In 
the event of a medical emergency, participants can be transported to the UCSD Medical Center 
Emergency Room . Participants will remain in the laboratory under direct observation by nursing 
staff for 3.5 hours after the cannabis vaporization inhalations are completed. At that time a final 
vital sign and self -report status check will be made and upon satisfactory readings, the subject 
will be released and driven back to his/her domicile by taxicab or prearranged transportation. 
The return transport procedure also will be observed directly by staff to ensure compliance. In 
an emergency situation that occurs outside of the university where participants are in need of 
immediate help as a result of an adverse event, the participants will be informed that they 
should first call 911 and then report the incident to the study staff as soon as possible. During 
IMPACT partici pants will also receive regular text messages that will solicit information about 
any adverse events associated with their self -administered cannabis use. Participant text logs 
will be monitored on a daily basis to ensure that no serious problems have occu rred and to 
supervise each individual’s continuing participation in the study. Participants are informed that 
they may withdraw from the research at any time if they find any aspect objectionable.  
 
 
6.0 CRITERIA FOR DISCONTINUATION  
 
6.1 Criteria for Discontinuation of Cannabis Administration  
 
All participants will be informed of the risks of the study and the anticipated and potential effects 
of exposure to vaporized cannabis. We will monitor participant status throughout the day of the 
cannabis administration sessions, including assessing bloo d pressure at regular intervals (60, 
120, 180 minutes after drug administration).  
 
Stopping rules for study subject discontinuation include:  
Pulse:          pulse rate > 130 beats per minute or < 50 beats per minute  
Blood Pressure:     systolic blood pressure > 160 mmHg or < 80 mmHg,  
         diastolic blood pressure > 100 mmHg or < 40 mmHg  
Respiratory: shortness of breath, respiratory rate > 22 breaths per minute, or 
oxygen saturation less than 92%  
Cardiac: chest pain  
 14  
  
  
   
 
Neuro: confusion, loss of coordination, falling down, fainting  
Psych: panic attack, psychotic reaction (hallucinations, psychotic depression)  
 
6.2 Premature  Study Discontinuation  
 
8.2.1    Pregnancy or breast feeding.  
 
8.2.2    Request by the subject to withdraw.  
 
8.2.3    At the discretion of the investigators, UCSD IRB, NIDA, or other agencies 
providing oversight, i.e., Research Advisory Panel of California.  
 
8.2.4 .   Rare but serious side effects of cannabis administration as listed in Section 6.1. 
 
 
7.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN   
 
 
7.1  Aim 1 Measures and Analyses   
 
Data will be assessed for normality and transformations applied as needed (e.g., log). 
Neuropathic pain before and after acute cannabis administration will be assessed by NPRS and 
the von Frey test. Plasma AEA and 2 -AG will be measured with LC/MS. Flow cytometry will 
quantify the percentage of PBMC that express CB2, FAAH, and MAGL, including monocytes, 
CD4+ T -cells, and CD8+ T -cells.  To examine the effect of different CBD/THC products on NP 
and EC biomarkers, we will use a linear mixed model with subjects treated as a random effect to 
model the response measures. This methodology takes into account the repeated measures 
aspect of the within -subjects crossover study design, incorporating information from 
observations for each subject at different treatment doses and multiple time points within each 
dose. For initial  modelin g, terms will include dose (0.01 %, 5.1% - 4 puffs,  and 5.1% - 8 puffs) 
CBD treated as a categorical variable), time (0, 60, 120 and 180 minutes after exposure treated 
as a continuous variable), and dose x time interaction. Additional terms will also be included for 
the sequence in which the treatments were administered (e.g.,  low CBD vs. medium CBD) and 
for second -order time (time2). The quadratic term is intended to model a U -shaped response 
curve if responses initially increase (or decrease), reach a maximum (or minimum), then 
decrease (or increase) back to baseline le vels. For each outcome measure, each of these last 2 
terms will be omitted from subsequent models and not reported if nonsignificant. Any potential 
factors that associate with outcome variables at the α = 0.20 level in single -predictor analyses  
(history of light vs. heavy cannabis use, mode of prior cannabis use – i.e., engaging in smoking, 
or vaporizing, or both), time since last cannabis use before baseline, duration of cannabis use 
over lifetime, presence of adolescent cannabis use,  duration of HIV infec tion, nadir CD4, viral 
load, gender, the presence of other non -cannabis analgesic medications, history of non -cannabis 
substance use disorders) will be included in the linear model. Dose effects at each time point will 
be assessed with mixed modeling after re -coding time as a categorical factor and including dose 
and dose x time terms (plus a term for sequence if this is significant in the initial model). 
Differences among doses will be evaluated using the Tukey honestly significant difference 
(HSD) compari son tests for differences of effects over all time points and contrasts within each 
 15  
  
  
   
 
time point.  All response observations, including information from subjects who do not complete 
all experimental sessions, will be included in the analyses. Similar mixed -model analyses will be 
performed on the primary pain outcome after adjustment for psychomimetic si de effects 
(measured with the ARCI scale) to assess for effects of the study drug on pain independent of 
subjective responses. The proportion of subjects with a 30% pain reduction, a standard for 
effective pain reduction60 will be compared between each of the doses with chi -square tests; we 
will also calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) for a 30% pain reduction rate. We will also 
conduct analyses to examine the association between pain and EC biomarkers, including AEA, 
2-AG, FAAH, and MAGL expression. A 5% significance level will be used for all testing.  The 
association of pain levels with HRV will use a linear mixed -effects model, adjusting for potential 
confounders as above. Within -subject correlation will be accounted for using subject -specific 
random intercepts and slopes.  
 
7.2  Aim 2 Measures and Analyses  
 
Based on our existing data for PLWH SMS compliance, we anticipate that participants will 
respond to 80 -90% of the daily text messages during IMPACT. To address the issue of missing 
data, we will incorporate questions that allow participants to indicate the ir pain and cannabis use 
for the prior day if they did not respond to the earlier message. For days that have completely 
missing data, we will treat the intermittently missing data as missing completely at random.  
However, this assumption will be checked in sensitivity analyses by comparing the outcomes of 
participants based on the amount of missing data.  Study dropout will be examined separately 
using statistical methods in current use [Diggle, Heagerty, Liang, and Zeger, Analysis of 
Longitudinal Data, 2nd ed., Oxford University Press, 2013]:  The relationship between CBD, 
THC, and the CBD/THC ratio during a cannabis exposure event to changes in pain before and 
after the event will be examined using longitudinal data methods – e.g., mixed -effects linear 
models , controlling for potential confounders including baseline pain , in addition to those listed 
under Aim 1. The total CBD and THC consumed during the exposure will be calculated using the 
SUI method, estimating total grams of cannabis consumed multiplied by the percentages of CBD 
and THC content. Subject -specific random intercepts will be included in the model in order to 
account for the within -subject correlation of the outcome. Exploratory analyses will examine if 
there are d ifferent effects of reported cannabis strain (Sativa, Indica), individual types (e.g., OG 
Kush, Sour Lemon, etc.), or mode (smoking, vaporizing, ingesting food product) on pre -post 
changes in NP. We will also conduct exploratory analyses to examine if ther e is an interaction 
between reported level s of THC (low, < 1%, medium, 1 -6%, high, > 10%)  and CBD (low, < 1%, 
medium, 1 -6%, high, > 10%) on pain change after drug use. The association of daily measures of 
pain levels with HRV will use a linear mixed -effects model, adjusting for potential confounders.  
The within -subject correlation will be accounted for using subject -specific random intercepts.  
Longitudinal changes in HRV between the first and last week will be assessed with a linear 
model that includes  cannabis use (light vs. heavy) and CBD/THC intake, as predictors. 
Regression analyses will also examine the association between HRV and self -report pain 
measures quantifie d at the baseline and final visits.  
 
Comparison of NIDA -obtained and dispensary -obtained cannabis effects on NP.  We will 
compare the effect of laboratory cannabis administration and IMPACT self -report data on 
changes in pain (both measured with NPRS) before and after drug exposure. We will assess 
pain change scores for the laboratory study and IMPACT measured as the  difference between 
 16  
  
  
   
 
baseline (before drug) and 60 and 120 minutes after drug, time points that correspond with pain 
reduction in our prior THC work60. We will use the following analyses:  1) plot the distribution of 
the CBD/THC ratio (x - axis) against pain change (y -axis), calculate the slope of pain change 
scores for both the lab data and IMPACT, a nd determine if the slopes are similar or significantly 
different (a mixed effect model that will estimate changes in outcomes/slopes). 2) If the slopes 
are nonlinear, we will calculate the area under the curve (AUC) – a measure of total pain 
change – up to a CBD/THC ratio of 10 (our high CBD dose in the lab). 3) It is possible that our 
IMPACT data show that many participants only use one or two types of cannabis (e.g., with only 
a single CBD/THC ratio), thus it might be difficult to plot a CBD/THC ratio di stribution. In that 
event, we will classify IMPACT cannabis use into 3 categories (low CBD/THC ratio, < 1; 
matched CBD/THC 1:1; high CBD/THC ratio, >1, and examine the correlation between the pain 
change in each category (averaged over the IMPACT study) wi th the pain change scores we 
observe for our low, medium, and high CBD laboratory doses. If our findings indicate a higher 
slope or greater AUC for NIDA cannabis vs. dispensary cannabis, this would suggest less 
efficacious pain relief from the local cannab is sources. In contrast, a strong correlation between 
CBD pain change scores for NIDA and dispensary product in one or more CBD/THC ratio 
categories would support a consistent finding for the effectiveness of different CBD amounts. In 
summary, either agree ment or discrepancy between NIDA and dispensary data would be highly 
informative and would help guide future policy recommendations for cannabis -based pain 
treatment.  
 
7.3 Aim 3 Measures and Analyses  
 
We will use a linear model to examine the association between the total CBD, THC, and 
CBD/THC ratio during IMPACT and the change in NP, disease markers (CD4, viral load, Total 
Neuropathy Score, and neurocognitive global T -score), and EC biomarkers (AEA, 2 -AG, FAAH, 
MAGL, CB2) from baseline to the final visit after month 6. We will control for confounders as in 
Aims 1 and 2, including any C BD and THC levels recorded at the baseline and final sessions. 
Linear models will compare the month 6 – baseline change in pain and in EC biomarkers 
between the heavy - and light -cannabis groups. One exploratory analysis will test for an 
interaction between  group (light vs. heavy) and CBD and THC levels on change in NP and EC 
biomarkers. We will assess if exposure mode (smoking/vaporizing/ingestion) predicts pain 
outcome. We will examine if there is an association between pain change over time and 
changes in  EC biomarkers. During the 6 -month IMPACT, alterations may occur in cannabis use 
or pain medication (e.g., a person enrolled as a light cannabis user may start to engage in 
heavy use or begin using non -cannabis medication for pain, i.e., an opiate, which w e will record 
with IMPACT). To address these issues we will conduct light vs. heavy use analyses based both 
on the baseline group classification and the actual use during IMPACT, include a cannabis use 
‘change’ factor in the analyses (going from light to h eavy use, or vice versa), and include the 
initiation of any non -cannabis pain medication as a factor in the model.  
 
 
7.4  Power Analyses  
 
A recent study indicated a medium effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.46) for CBD treatment that 
increased plasma AEA levels compared to an antipsychotic drug control condition26. Preclinical 
models of neuropathic pain in mice demonstrate that FAAH inhibitors decrease hyperalgesia 
 17  
  
  
   
 
and allodynia with large effect sizes (Cohen’s d = 4 -5)18. Our pilot HRV data indicate a medium 
to large effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.8) for reduced RMSSD in PLWH with neuropathic pain 
compared to PLWH without neuropathy. We conducted power calculations with the G*POWER 
software92 comparing the area under the curve (AUC) of the change from baseline in pain levels 
between the three doses of cannabis.  The actual analyses will have higher power, since they 
rely on a lon gitudinal mixed -effects model. With n=100  participants completing the cross -
sectional baseline visits, and measured in a within -participant design, as described above, we 
have 80% power to detect an effect size Cohen’s f=0.180 .  This Cohen’s f corresponds to a 
range of group means for the three groups corresponding to a small -to-medium Cohen’s d = 
0.382 -0.441 .  We have 0.61 -0.76 power to detect such a pairwise difference as statistically 
significant in post -hoc analyses (e.g., with Bonferroni correction for post -hoc comparisons).  If 
the completio n rate at this stage is 95% (90%) of the initial enrollment of n=100, the detectable 
effect size is Cohen’s f=0.185 (0.190).  These correspond to a range of group means for the 
three groups corresponding to small -medium Cohen’s d = 0.403 -0.465 . 
 
For Aim 2, with 20% attrition over the 6 months of IMPACT we have n= 80 participants with 6 
months (26 weeks) of data.  We conservatively ignore the drop -out participants (who 
nonetheless contribute partial data).  Assume, conservatively, that participants  will use cannabis 
on average 2 times/week.  This gives n=80 and k=52 observations/participant.  If ICC is the 
intra-class, or within -participant correlation, the effective sample size (number of equivalent 
independent observations) is n eff = n/(ICC+(1-ICC)/k) ≈ n/ICC [e.g., Killip, Mahfoud, Pearce.  
What is an intracluster correlation coefficient?  Crucial concepts for primary care researchers, 
Ann Fam Med, 2004; 2:204 -208.] .  Assuming conservatively =0.5 (or lower), we get neff = 2n = 
200 [ neff = 160].  We have 80% power to detect a (partial) correlation R between the individual 
predictors (Hypothesis 1: CBD, THC, and the CBD/THC ratio ; Hypothesis 2: pain levels and 
HRV) and change in pain of R = 0.218 (or semi -partial R2 = 0.0475) , after adjusting for 
confounders.  Calculations used G*Power.  
 
For Aim 3, assuming n = 80  participants complete the 6 -month follow -up, we have 80% power 
to detect an association between an individual predictor and response (e.g., total CBD and 
changes in neuropathic pain levels) of R = 0.302 (or semi -partial R2 = 0.092) , after adjusting for 
confounders.  The calculations used G*Power.

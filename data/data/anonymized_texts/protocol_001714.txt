1.0 BACKGROUND, RATIONALE  
Evidence -based weight management programs are effective when individuals adhere  to 
treatment recommendations.4 However, a majority of individuals are unable to engage and/or 
sustain a healthy diet5-8 because of the interaction betwee n powerful biological drives and 
omnipresent obesogenic environmental factors.31  
A promising  framework to address weight management challenges is premised on the reality that 
environmental cues can never be fully eliminated or prevented, so it may be valu able for 
Page 4 of 18 
HRP -652-Protocol Template_Investigator -Initiated Clinical Research_05 -17-19 
 individuals to strengthen their self -regulatory control in order to inhibit their impulses when  
confronted with temptations. In this view, self -control is like a muscle, and although it fatigues, 
people can be trained to increase its strength.1-3 This is consistent with Dr. Salvy’s4,5 and others’ 
findings linking deficits in executive functioning  and obesity,6-15 and with the use of  impulse 
control training to regulate food -related impulsivity.16-19 Interventions based on the “Go/No -Go 
task,” a paradigm for studying and training inhibitory control by challenging subjects to withhold 
impulsive responses, are particularly promising.18 Go/No -Go training has been shown to increas e 
short -term eating regulation and produce modest  weight -loss.18,19 However, previous studies 
include key limitations: limited dosage or training duration, exposure to a small set of stimuli and 
lack of tailoring to participants’ proficiency. Furthermore, Go/No -Go impulse control programs 
primarily target single processes involved in inhibiting or suppressing motor responses rather 
than cognitive processes involved in inhibiting  cue-response mappings. Resisting food cues not 
only requires inhibition of impulsive behaviors, but also inhibition of the reinforcing food task 
set.20 The efficacy of these interventions in improving daily self -regulation is also controversial, 
with some broad claims based on thin, and often irrelevant, scientific evidence.21-24  
To address the rigor of pr evious research, we draw upon recent developments in cognitive 
training with promising functional improvements in several areas (ADHD,25 chemo brain,26 age-
related cognitive decline,27 dyslexia,28 schizophrenia,29 sensory deficits,30 brain injury,31 in 
promoting mental fitness27). Novel inhibitory control training  (PolyRules!)  incorporates stimuli 
and task structures previously applied in visual perceptual learning and working memory 
training.32,33 PolyRules! adjusts to the users’ impulse control proficiency ,34-36 and gains have been 
found to generalize to other tasks37-40 and transfer beyond the training con text to complex 
activities.33,41 -43  Poly Rules! incorporates four  guiding principles of gamification44-47  to reinforce 
interactions with the app and promote adherence.  Gamification, if applied properly, may 
promote positive behavioral health changes  such as weight loss.   
In a recent pilot study,  we documented the acceptability and feasibility of PolyRules! training  
among middle -age adults (M age 59±9.4) who were receiving care at Cedars -Sinai Medical 
Center. We met our enrollment target (n=40)  within three hours of emailing the study flyer . This 
enthusiastic response speaks to the need fulfilled by the proposed lifestyle and cognitive 
inter vention components . Over 85% of 
respondents had attempted  to lose weight in 
the last 5 years and 58% had tried to lose  
weight 5 -10+ times. A majority of respondent 
(79%) said they knew what to eat but struggled 
keeping a healthy weight and adhering to 
healthy dietary recommendations. Over 90% of 
respondents reported that difficulty in resisting 
tempting foods and self -motivation were  
barriers  to behavior change and weight loss. All 
components received mean scores >4 (1 = not 
at all useful, 5 = very useful) in terms of their 
usefulness in increasing adherence to dietary 
recommendations  (Figure 1 ). All p articipants 0102030405060708090100

 reported  they would be likely or extremely likely to participate in a n intervention combining 
inhibitory control training  and weight management if it was  offered . 
A subset of ten participants  further completed 
10 days of PolyRul es! training. All participants 
completed the daily 30 -min training sessions and 
increased in proficiency over the 10 -day training. 
Figure 2 illustrates average improvement ( •••• ) in 
inhibitory control, as well as participants with 
minimal ( ID09 ) and steep ( ID03 ) gains in 
performance over the 10 training sessions. 
Participants described the training as meditative, 
with the right balance of simplicity in navigating 
the app and cognitive challenge (e.g., “I can feel 
my brain working”; “It’s simple but ch allenging”; 
“Your brain is engaged ”). All participants enjoyed PolyRules! and asked if they could continue 
using the app . Most frequently cited immediate perceived benefits from using the app were in 
terms of improved focus, attention  and memory  (“I paid more attention than I normally would”; 
“I was able to recall the details about what I read, and this is not how I normally am” ) and in 
terms of overall thinking and cognition (“The app is making me smarter!”; “I feel more alert”; “I’m 
sharper”).   
This formative work supports the appeal and feasibility of gamified inhibitory control training as 
a stand -alone component. Additional data is needed to document inhibitory control training in 
combination to evidence -based weight management program. The propos ed two-arm pilot study 
aims to estimate the effect size  in weight loss of supplementing the WW (formerly Weight 
Watchers) online program with gamified inhibitory control training (PolyRules!) among adults 
with overweight or obesity . WW is a commercially available structured behavioral weight 
management program focusing  on diet, physical activity and mindset skills. WW was selected for 
this study because it is the most used commercial program, and the #1  doctor recommended 
program  based on a 2 019 survey by Kantar Health of 500 doctors who recommend weight loss 
programs to patients .48-52

team  via email , phone, or text message for more information .  
 
4.0  STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
 4.1 OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND PROCEDURES  
 
Participants (n= 30) will be randomly assigned to one of two arms : (1) WW (formerly 
weight watchers) only or (2) WW + Gamified inhibitory control training (PolyRules!) . All 
participants will complete demographic, medical history questionnaires and cognitive 
assessment battery at baseline/enrollment and after completing the 3-month  
intervention protocol. As compensation for completing all study procedures, participants 
will receive a $30 gift card.  
 
 4.2 STUDY ARMS  
 
WW (all participants; n = 30) : All participants will receive pre -loaded computer tablets and 3-
month  access to the WW digital program. WW is a structured behavioral weight management 
program that focuses on diet, physical activity and mindset skills. The dietary approach is 
based on creating an energy d eficit diet to produce weight loss while also being attentive 
to the quality of the calories. Specifically, the WW program assigns SmartPoints values to 
foods based on calories, sugar, saturated fat and protein. In addition, particular foods are 
assigned a  points value of zero (0) to encourage a healthier eating pattern (e.g. fruits, 
vegetables, non -fat yogurt, fish). Upon sign -up, an individualized SmartPoints budget 
consisting of a daily SmartPoints target and weekly SmartPoints allowance is calculated 
based on height, weight, age and sex. The fitness component assigns FitPoints values to 
physical activities based on the type, duration, intensity and the participant’s body 
weight. Participants receive 24/7 access to coaches, automatic enrollment in a rewar ds 
program based on behaviors, weekly emails motivating lifestyle  changes and a closed 
social network for WW members.  
 
WW + PolyRules!  (50% of participants, n = 15) : Participants assigned to the WW+ 
Polyrules arm will receive access to the WW online program (as described above) and to 
the PolyRules! app for three months . Participants will be trained on how to use PolyRules! 
via Zoom or Team Meeting platforms. Participa nts will be asked to engage in daily 
Page 8 of 18 
HRP -652-Protocol Template_Investigator -Initiated Clinical Research_05 -17-19 
 cognitive training using the PolyRules! app for three months . They will be instructed to 
start with 20 -min of daily cognitive training and to progressively increase their training 
time to 30 -min. All interactions with P olyRules! will be passively recorded to monitor 
whether participants engage in cognitive training.  
 
4.3 MEASUREMENTS  
 
Demographics  
 
Participants will complete a questionnaire surveying: date of birth, sex, ethnicity, 
socioeconomic status (SES: education le vel, household income, marital status, 
employment status), household composition (multigenerational, single, married, 
cohabitating, children) and medical history.  
 
Shared weight, dietary and physical activity data  
 
As part of the WW experience, participants are instructed to track their weight, daily food 
intake and physical activity via the WW mobile app or online website. As a secondary 
objective, we will explore  weight loss, dietary intake and physical activity over the course 
of the study and across study  arms.   
 
Cognitive Functioning  
 
As a secondary objective, we will explore changes in attention, inhibitory control and 
working memory over the course of the study across study arms.   
 
Executive Functioning  
 
The Behavior  Rating  Inventory  of Executive  Function®- Adult  Version  (BRIEF -A) is a 
standardized measure of executive functions or self -regulation in everyday environment. 
The BRIEF -A assesses nine nonoverlapping theoretically and empirically d erived clinical 
scales: Inhibit, Self -Monitor, Plan/Organize, Shift, Initiate, Task Monitor, Emotional 
Control, Working Memory, and Organization of Materials.  BRIEF -A is available in English 
and Spanish and can be computer -administered.  
 
Attention and Inh ibitory Control  Tasks  
  
The Cancellation Task  is a timed, tablet -based test of selective attention and inhibitory 
control, akin to D2 (Brickenkamp & Zilmer, 1998). There are two versions that can be used 
interchangeably: Cancellation Letters and Cancellation Pictures.  Cancellation - Letters 
resembles  the D2 in that it consists of similar stimuli: characters “d” and “p” with one to 
four dashes, arranged either individually or in pairs above or below the letters. For Letters, 
the participant must scan the items from left to right and select all “d”s wit h two dashes 
Page 9 of 18 
HRP -652-Protocol Template_Investigator -Initiated Clinical Research_05 -17-19 
 (targets). In Cancellation - Pictures, letters are replaced with pictures of dogs and 
monkeys, some of which are rotated along the vertical axis or are presented upside down. 
For Pictures, the participant must select the upright dog (tail on t he left) and the upside -
down monkey (tail on right) separately in single blocks and together in a mixed block.  
 
The Countermanding  task is a relatively fast and easy task that is appropriate for all age 
levels, including children. The participant is instr ucted to tap on one of two green buttons 
in response to a visual stimulus - a picture of a dog or a monkey. For dogs, the participant 
must tap on the button that is on the same side of the screen (congruent trial); however, 
when the participant sees a monk ey, they must tap on the button that is on the opposite 
side (incongruent trial). Note that the visual stimuli appear on the left or on the right 
interchangeably. On incongruent trials, the participant must inhibit a prepotent response 
to respond on the sa me side as the visual stimulus. There are 3 blocks of trials, each 
preceded by a practice session. The stimuli are presented on the screen until the 
participant responds, with an upper time limit of 15 seconds. Accuracy is typically very 
high in this task thus the main dependent measure is reaction time for correct responses 
on congruent and incongruent trials.   
 
Working Memory  Tasks  
 
In the N-Back  task, participants are  presented with a co nsecutive stream of pictures, and 
the objective is to tap on the pictures that match those presented N items earlier. Higher 
levels of N levels increase WM load and make the task more difficult. All participants 
complete 1 -back (Figure 4), 2 -back, and 3 -back (in that order). Before each level starts, 
there is a practice session consisting of 10 trials during which performance feedback is 
provided. The test phase for each N -level consists of 30 trials with 9 targets. Progression 
to 4-back (and beyond) is all owed if the participant made no more than 2 errors on the 
previous level. Stimuli are presented for 2500 ms (participant can respond during this 
period) with an ISI of 500 ms.  
 
In the Letter -Number task , participants are presented with a mixed order of le tters and 
numbers , which they must remember and sort them numerically and alphabetically. For 
example, the sequence ‘H8T3K5’ would be sorted into ‘358’ and ‘HKT’. The mixed orders 
of letter and numbers ranges from 2 to 15. After a short tutorial, the parti cipant practices 
the task and must get three out of the five trials correct to proceed to the test. The Letter 
Number Task is split into two parts: The first is a method of limits to find the participants 
threshold, whereas the second provides additional t rials around that threshold. 
Characters that could be confused with other letters or numbers are excluded (0, I, O, U, 
X). Moreover, a given sequence does not include any of the characters in the previous 
trial and it does not contain consecutive numbers a nd letters .   
 
Visuo -spatial working memory  will be measured with  a modified  Corsi  Tasks, a collection 
of 4 types of tasks (i.e. classic - blocks, simple, complex, sequencing) that are customizable 
Page 10 of 18 
HRP -652-Protocol Template_Investigator -Initiated Clinical Research_05 -17-19 
 where an experimenter can select which task mode, stimulus type, and algorithm they 
want to use. In all versions of the task, the participan t is shown instructions and then 
practices the task. Corsi Blocks Classic : The participant first completes Corsi Blocks 
Forward  (tap in same order), followed by Corsi Blocks Reverse (tap in reverse order). The 
Corsi Blocks Forward  task is split into two pa rts: the first is a method of limits to find the 
participants threshold, whereas the second provides additional trials around that 
threshold. Complex Corsi : Combines Simple Corsi with a secondary sorting task in 
between each trial. In the sorting task, the  participant must drag a dog to a bone or a 
monkey to a banana. The location of the bone and banana are randomized to prevent 
mnemonic strategies like chunking.

7.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 7.1 STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES  
 
Page 14 of 18 
HRP -652-Protocol Template_Investigator -Initiated Clinical Research_05 -17-19 
 The primary objective of this study is to estimate the effect size  in weight loss of 
supplementing the WW online program with gamified inhibitory control training 
(PolyRules!) among adults with overweight or obesity .  
 
As a secondary objective, we will exp lore changes in dietary intake, physical activity, 
attention, inhibitory control and working memory over the course of study across study 
arms.   
 
Primary endpoin ts 
• Weight loss from baseline to 3 months . 
 
Secondary endpoints  
• As a secondary objective, we will explore dietary intake, physical activity, 
attention, inhibitory control and working memory  over the course of the study 
and across study arms. We acknowledge that we are not powered to detect 
between -group difference on these outcomes.  However , inasmuch as participants 
assigned to the WW only group do not engage in inhibitory control training, we 
expect no change in attention, inhibitory control and working memory over the 
course of the study among participa nts randomized to WW only.   
 
• Qualitative outcomes measures will include participant’s satisfaction with WW 
and PolyRules! (if applicable)  and perceived benefits . Perceived 
satisfaction/dissatisfaction and preferred features of the WW and PolyRules! app 
will be qualitatively assessed and data obtained in semi -structured interviews  will 
be summarized .  
 
 7.2 SAMPLE CONSIDERATIONS  
 
• Sample size was defined based on available funding such that we expect drop -
out over 3 months given the study is longitudinal. Therefore, a sample size of 30 
will provide us a reasonable sample size to estimate the effect size.  
 
 7.3 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
Descriptive analysis will be presented with mean ± standard deviation for quantitative 
variables, and frequency (percentages) for qualitative variables.  A 95% confidence 
interval for the difference in weight loss between WW and WW + Po lyRules ! will be 
calculated. Cognitive test scores ( inhibitory control, attention, verbal working memory 
tasks, visuo -spatial working memory tasks, and working memory capacity tasks ),  
executive function,  and physical activity questionnaires will be scored  and summarized 
(Mean and SD) by group and used to inform the design of a larger randomized controlled 
trial. Calculations will be performed using R -package, version 4.0.53

We are seeking your consent to take part in this research study. Your participation in this research 
is voluntary. If you choose to participate, you can stop at any time. Please consider the following summary, along with the more detailed information provided throughout this consent form.
1. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH STUDY?
The purpose of this pilot study is to explore the benefits of supplementing the WW (formerly 
Weight Watchers) online program with a cognitive training game (PolyRules!) among adults with overweight or obesity.
You are being asked to take part in this research study because you showed interest in the study 
and are 18 years old or older. 
The study will enroll up to 30 people total.
2. WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE STUDY?
This section provides a general overview of what will happen during your participation in the 
study. Information included below should be considered before deciding to participate. Research-related procedures are those performed solely for the research. They would not be performed if you did not take part in the study. 
Overview of study:
If you agree to participate in the study, you will be randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) 
to one of two groups: 
Group 1: WW (formerly Weight Watchers) only
Group 2: WW + Cognitive training game (PolyRules!)
CSMC IRB No: STUDY00001164
CSMC Date Effective: 1/15/2021
You will be asked to complete demographic, and medical history questionnaires and a 
computer-administered cognitive test at baseline/enrollment and after completing the 
three-month intervention protocol (described below). 
After the three-month intervention, you will be asked to participate in a one-on-one 
interview (conducted remotely) to share your experience in the study.
As compensation for completing all study procedures, you will receive a $30 gift card. 
Description of Study Arms:
If you agree to participate you will be randomly placed into one of the two groups. The study team 
has no control over which intervention you receive. 
Group 1: WW ((50% of participants, n = 15): Participants assigned to the WW arm will 
receive pre-loaded computer tablets and 3-month access to the WW digital program. The computer 
tablets will need to be returned to study staff after the intervention is completed. Participants will be provided a prepaid return box to mail the computer tablets to study staff. WW is a structured behavioral weight management program that focuses on diet, physical activity and mindset skills. The dietary approach is based on creating an energy deficit diet to produce weight loss while also being attentive to the quality of the calories. Specifically, the WW program assigns SmartPoints values to foods based on calories, sugar, saturated fat and protein. In addition, particular foods are assigned a points value of zero (0) to encourage a healthier eating pattern (e.g. fruits, vegetables, non-fat yogurt, fish). Upon sign-up, an individualized SmartPoints budget consisting of a daily SmartPoints target and weekly SmartPoints allowance is calculated based on height, weight, age and sex. The fitness component assigns FitPoints values to physical activities based on the type, duration, intensity and the participant’s body weight. Participants receive 24/7 access to coaches, automatic enrollment in a rewards program based on behaviors, weekly emails motivating lifestyle changes and a closed social network, in which WW members can interact with other members (if they choose to) via the WW app.
Group 2: WW + PolyRules! (50% of participants, n = 15): Participants assigned to the WW+ 
Polyrules! arm will receive access to the WW online program (as described above) and to the 
PolyRules! app for three months. Participants will be trained on how to use PolyRules! via Zoom or Team Meeting platforms. Participants will be asked to engage in daily cognitive training using the PolyRules! app for three months. They will be instructed to start with 20-min of daily cognitive training and to progressively increase their training time to 30-min. All interactions with PolyRules! will be passively recorded to monitor whether participants engage in cognitive training.
Semi-Structured Interview: After you complete the three-week intervention, you will be asked 
to take part in a one-on-one interview (conducted remotely over Zoom or Team Meeting) to obtain your feedback regarding your experience with the study. This interview will be audio recorded for accuracy and transcription purposes. Audio recordings will be confidential, and we will do our best to make sure that your identity is kept private, but we cannot guarantee total privacy. The audio files will be accessed only by verified members of the study team and will be kept until they have been analyzed. After analysis and completion of the study, all audio recordings will be destroyed.
CSMC IRB No: STUDY00001164
CSMC Date Effective: 1/15/2021
How long will you be in the study?
You will be in the study for approximately 12 months. This will involve 2 e-visits 
(baseline/enrollment, at completion of the intervention) 3 months apart and several interactions with the research staff throughout the study duration. Additionally, you will be asked to participate in a semi-structured interview to share your experience in the study.

3. WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS?
This section describes the possible risks and/or discomforts we anticipate you could experience 
that are related to the study procedures.
Although risks and discomfort are unlikely in this study, you may feel uncomfortable answering 
some of the questions. You do not have to answer any questions if you are not comfortable and can withdraw from the study at any time. 
This research involves the potential risk of accidental release of confidential information.  We will 
do our best to make sure that the personal information collected as part of this study is kept private. However, we cannot guarantee total privacy. Data will be stored in password-protected files accessible only to the investigators and staff under their supervision. In the database, only an ID code number will identify subjects. If information from this study is published or presented at scientific meetings, your name and other identifiable personal information will not be used.
Other risks include disclosure of your IP address when connecting the study provided your iPad to 
the internet. An IP address is a unique identifying number used to identify computers/devices 
connected to the Internet. An IP address might be static (i.e., always refer to one institution's server), dynamic (assigned upon connection), or pooled (a group of servers share one or more IP 
CSMC IRB No: STUDY00001164
CSMC Date Effective: 1/15/2021
addresses). IP addresses represent a form of potentially indirect identifying information such as 
city geolocation. An IP address is less of a threat to confidentiality than handwriting, fingerprints, 
postal-addresses, email addresses, handwritten signatures, or being observed completing a paper 
survey. We will not collect or use your IP address for any research purposes.
4. ARE THERE BENEFITS IN TAKING PART IN THE STUDY?

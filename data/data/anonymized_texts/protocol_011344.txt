 1. Study Scop e 
This study is a prospective, multi- center, randomized, placebo -controlled study.  A minimum of 
68 subjects who suffer from acute migraine headaches and who provide written informed 
consent will be enrolled at a minimu m of 3 clinical sites.  Subjects will be randomized into one 
of two treatment groups ( i.e. Avulux® device vs. control/sham device) in a one -to-one ratio.    
Subjects will participate in the study for a maximum of four (4) weeks after enrollment .  
Subjects will be directed to apply the study device  specific to their study arm  as soon as 
possible once they experience symptoms consistent with the onset of a migraine attack.  
Subjects will be asked to assess the severity of each headache using a pain score just prior to 
the application of the study dev ice, and 2 - and 4 -hours  following application of the device, for 
all severe or very severe migraine headaches that they experience while enrolled in the study .   
 
This study will be conducted upon execution of a clinical study agreement and receipt of 
Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) approval from each participating site.   
 
2. Principle of the Device  
Avulux® is intended to reduce the severity of headache  pain in adult patients diagnosed with 
episodic migraine headache .  In this study, th e investigative Avulux® device shall consist of a 
pair of optical filters in the form of s pectacle lenses, provided in a standard spectacle frame; the 
lenses contain a dye  that effectively blocks light at specified wavelength ranges while 
minimizing distor tion of the visible spectrum. The optical filters block a portion of the optical 
spectrum that is suspected to stimulate photophobic responses that trigger some, and 
exacerbate most, migraines.  
 
The control/sham device for this study shall be a pair of plastic lenses provided in a standard 
spectacle frame , which will have negligible light -bloc king properties at the optical wavelengths 
which are blocked by the Avulux® device.  
  
3. Study Objectives  
3.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Avulux® device in reducing 
the impact of migraine headaches,  as measured by improvement in an 11 -point pain scale  after 
2 hours of device application, when compared to a control/sham device.  
 
3.2 Secondary Objective  
The secondary  objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Avulux® device in 
reducing  the impact of migraine headaches, as measured by improvement in an 11 -point pain 
scale  after 4 hours of device application , when compared to a control/sham devi ce.  
 
6 
 3.3 Exploratory Objectives  
Exploratory  objectives for this study are:  
• To compare the prop ortion of subjects who show quantifiable improvement in overall 
migraine impact (as measured by a change in migraine pain from severe to mild/no 
pain) when using  the Avulux®  device vs. a control/sham device;  
• To compare the proportion of subjects who requir e adjunctive medication to control 
their migraine headache when using the Avulux® device vs. a control/sham device; and  
• To compare the proportion of subjects suffering from light sensitivity as a result of their 
migraine headache when using the Avulux® device vs. a control/sham device.    
 
4. Study Endpoints  
4.1 Primary Endpoint   
The primary endpoint variable is the change in migraine pain as measured on an eleven -point 
pain scale, defined as the pain score after an elapsed time of 2 hours following applic ation of 
the device minus the pain score at onset of migraine symptoms, with respect to the first severe 
or very severe migraine headache (defined as a pain score of 6 or greater at onset of migraine 
symptoms) experienced by an enrolled subject.  
 
4.2 Secon dary Endpoint  
The secondary endpoint variable is the change in migraine pain as measured on an eleven -point 
pain scale, defined as the pain score after an elapsed time of 4  hours following application of 
the device minus the pain score at onset of migraine  symptoms, with respect to the first severe 
or very severe migraine headache (defined as a pain score of 6 or greater at onset of migraine 
symptoms) experienced by an enrolled subject.  
 
4.3 Exploratory Endpoints  
Exploratory  endpoint variables are:  
• The pro portion of subjects who report mild  or no symptoms (defined as a pain score of 
3 or less) after an elapsed time of 2 hours following application of the device, with 
respect to their first severe or very severe migraine headache ;  
• The proportion of subjects  who require abortive medication to  control their first severe 
or very severe migraine headache within 8 hours following application of the device ; 
and 
• The proportion of subjects who report sensitivity to light after elapsed times of 2 hours 
and 4 hours fo llowing application of the device, with respect to their first severe or very 
severe migraine headache.

6. Study Pr ocedures  
6.1 Consent Procedures  
After Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committ ee (IRB/EC) approval for the study is obtained 
at a given clinical site, the investigator (or appropriate designee) at the site will identify 
8 
 potential subjects for the study, based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria outlined in Section 4.  
Eligible subje cts will be asked to provide written informed consent. The informed consent 
process will be documented for each subject and will include a thorough discussion of study 
procedure s involved.  Each subject participating in the study shall  sign and date the co nsent 
form prior to the initiation of any study procedures.   
6.2 Enrollment and Randomization of Study Subjects  
Subjects will be asked to provide demographic information (date of birth, gender, 
race/ethnicity) and relevant medical history related to migraine headaches.  Subjects who meet 
all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, and who provide writt en informed 
consent, will be enrolled in the study.  Enrolled subjects will then be randomized to the Avulux® 
study glasses vs. control/sham  study arm , with allocation on a 1:1 basis; subjects  will be 
provided with the device specific to the ir assigned  study arm.  Subj ects will be blinded to the 
type of device being assessed (both the blocking abilities when worn).   
 
6.3 Pain Scale  
Subjects will be  asked to rate their headache pain using an 11 -point scale, i.e . on an integer 
scale from 0 to 10 inclusive, with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating the worst pain 
imaginable.  The scale can be interpreted clinically as follows:   
• 10:   worst pain imag inable;  
• 8-9:  very severe pain;  
• 6-7:  severe pain;  
• 4-5:  moderate pain;  
• 1-3:  mild pain;  
• 0:      no pain.  
The 11- point pain s cale has been validated for use in migraine headache evaluations.1 
 
6.4 Procedures and Assessments  
Subjects will be directed to : 
• apply the study glasses at the first onset of aura, or as soon as possible once they 
experience symptoms consistent with the onset of a migraine attack.    
• avoid taking  abortive medication for the first four hours of a migraine attack. If abortive 
medicatio ns cannot be avoided, the subject should document use.  
• record the following information for the first (and all subsequent) se vere or very severe 
migraine headaches that they experience while enrolled in the study:  
o The date and time of symptom onset;  
 
1 Kwong W J and Pathak DS. Validation of the eleven- point pain scale in the measurement of migraine headache 
pain.  Cephalgia 2007; 27:  336- 342. 
9 
 o The p ain score (as assessed on the  11-point pain scale) just prior to the 
application of the study glasses (score needs to be grea ter than or equal to 6 to 
qualify as a severe or very severe headache);  
o The time at which the study glasses are applied;  
o Whether t he subject was wearing prescription eyewear in addition to the study 
glasses, or whether the study glasses alone were worn;  
o The pain score (as assessed on the eleven -point pain scale) 2 hours after the 
study glasses are applied;  
o The pain score (as assesse d on the eleven- point pain scale) 4 hours after the 
study glasses are applied;  
o The type of abortive medication taken (if any ) to control headache symptoms, 
the dosage taken, and the time at which the medication is taken; and  
o Any experience of light sensi tivity within 4 hours after the study glasses are 
applied, and the time at which light sensitivity is first experienced.  
Subj ects will participate in the study for a maximum of four (4) weeks  ± 3 days  after enrollment; 
if a given subject does not experienc e a severe or very severe migraine headache within four (4) 
weeks, that subject will not be included in the evaluable study population.  
 
Study coordinators will contact subjects once per week to e nsure they are wearing the study device 
as instructed, and that they are recording the requested information related to their headaches.  
These weekly contacts will also enable coordinators to identify and address any barriers to 
adherence with the protocol.  
 
After completion of study activities, subjects will return the glasses specific to their study arm, 
and be asked to complete a study  questionnaire, to provide feedback regarding the wearability 
and ease of use of the glasses.   Subjects will also be asked to provide an opinion as to which 
type of device they believe they were assigned to ( Avulux®  vs. control/sham vs. do not know).  
 
7. Safety Reporting  
7.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as an  undesirable physical, psychological, or behavioral effect 
experienced by a subject  related to headaches  in conjunction with his/her participation in the 
clinical study, whether or not  device  related .  Any subject may experience adverse events or 
complications while enrolled in the study .  Should they occur, these events will be reported to 
the sponsor  as detailed in section 7.3.1.

are protected, that the reported study  data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, and that the 
conduct of the trial is compliant with federal regulations, ag reements with the sponsor, the 
currently approved protocol, and with any requirements imp osed by the IRB /EC.  
 
Site monitoring will be performed by a third -party  contract research organization ( CRO ) 
working on behalf of the sponsor.  A Clinical Monitoring Plan (CMP) will be developed to 
establish the plan for study oversight.  
14 
 On-site monitoring is anticipated throughout the course of the study. The sponsor will be 
provided with written reports of these visits, and the sites will be provided with a follow -up 
letter describing the findings and defining any outstanding issues or action items requ ired.   
 
10.1 1  Retention of Study Records  
The investigator will maintain adequate records for the study including informed consent 
forms , source documents (as applic able) , medical records, safety reports (as applicable), and 
other pertinent study data.   
For participating U.S. study sites, all records for this study must be retained by the Investigator 
for a minimum period of:  
• two (2) years after the FDA approves the marketing notification for the product, or  
 
• two (2) years following termination of the st udy if no marketing notification is ever 
sought or approved,  
whichever is the longer elapsed time.     
To avoid any possible m isunderstandings, the investigator will contact the sponsor prior to the 
planned destruction of any study records, or if the inves tigator leaves the institution where the 
study was conducted.  The investigator will notify the sponsor in the event of accide ntal loss or 
destruction of any study records.  
10.1 2 Protocol Termination 
Both the sponsor and the investigator have the right to terminate the study at their discretion, 
with written notice to the other party.  This action should be taken only after appropriate 
consultation between the sponsor and investigator or institution.  Termination of the study 
shall not affect the rights and  obligations of either of the parties prior to the date of 
termination.  
 
11.  Data Analysis  
11.1 Sample Size Justification  
A pilot  evaluation of the Avulux® and control/sham  devices (n = 10 subjects using each type of 
device) demonstrated that users of the Avulux® device reported a mean decrease of 4.1 points 
in pain score (standard deviation = 1.9 points) after an elapsed time of 2 hours, and users of the 
placebo device reported a mean decrease of 1.9 points in pain score (standard deviation = 1.5 
points) after an elapsed time of 2 hours.  The difference between the performance of the two 
devices was statistically significant ( p = 0.004).   
 
Assuming that subjects with severe or very severe migraine headaches achieve a mean 4 -point 
improvement in pain score when usi ng the investigative device and at most a mean 2 -point 
improvement when using the control/sham device, and assuming a sta ndard deviation of at 
15 
 most 2.0 points when estimating the mean difference in pain scores in individual study subjects 
after application  of either device, a sample size of 27 subjects per study arm provides a 
minimum statistical power of 95% to detect a sig nificant difference in mean results for the 
primary endpoint variable between the two (2) device types, at a significance level of α = 0.05. 
Given an estimated dropout rate of up to 20% in each study arm, a minimum of 34 subjects per 
arm (or 68 total subje cts) are required to be enrolled in this study.   
 
The above assumptions imply that the mean improvement in pain score after 2 hours wi ll be at 
least 2 points higher for the Avulux® device than for the control/sham device.  Meta -analyses 
have shown that th e minimal clinically important difference (MCID) to detect changes in acute 
pain as measured on the 11 -point pain scale is 1.7 points ;2,3 therefore, a 2 -point difference in 
mean improvement between study devices is considered to be clinically meaningful.   
 
11.2 Proposed Analyses  
A statistical analysis plan, containing detailed information regarding the proposed statistical 
analyses of study data , will be created and approved prior to database lock.  
 
Unless otherwise stated, all statistical testing will be two -sided and will be performed using a 
significance level of α = 0.05.  
 
11.2.1  Analysis Populations  
The intention- to-treat  (ITT) population shall be defined as the population of all enrolled subjects 
who were assigned to a study group and who experienced a minimum of one severe or very 
severe headache within 4 weeks of enrollment. This population shall include subjects who were 
non-compliant with study procedures, and subjects who were assigned to the incorrect device 
specific to their study group.   
 
The per-protocol  population shall be defin ed as the population of all enrolled subjects who 
were assigned to the correct device specific to their study  group,  who experienced a minimum 
of one severe or very severe headache within 4 weeks of enrollment , and who were compliant 
with study procedures throughout the duration of their enrollment in the study.    
 
Analyses of the primary and secondary endpoint s shall be conducted using data from intention -
to-treat population.  Analyses of exploratory  endpoints shall be conducted using data from the 
per-protocol population.

 11.2.2  Subject Accountability  
All subjects who provided informed consent ( screened subjects)  will be included in a summary 
of subject accountability. The number of subjects screened, the number and percentage of 
subjects who were screen failures, and the number and percentage of subjects who were 
enrolled in the study will be summarized by investiga tional site and overall. The reasons for 
screen failure will also be tabulated.  
 
11.2.3  Handling of Missing Data 
In the intention -to-treat population, any missing pain scores at time points of 2 and 4 hours 
after application of the device shall be imputed  using a multiple imputation procedure, with 
study arm, age, sex, baseline pain score, number of severe or very severe headaches 
experienced while enrolled in the study, and pain scores at 2 and 4 hours after application of 
the device for subsequent severe or ver y severe headaches experienced while enrolled in the 
study as predictors.  Imputation procedures shall utilize predictive mean matchin g.4  A total of 
50 sets of multiple imputations shall be generated; the analysis of the primary endpoint shall be 
conducte d for each set, and a pooled estimate of the difference in mean improvement between 
the two devices will be computed, along with a 95% inte rval estimate and p -value associated 
with the null hypothesis.   
 
In the per -protocol population, subjects with a mis sing value of an exploratory endpoint will not 
be included in the evaluable population for that endpoint .  
 
11.2.4  Demographic and Baseline Charac teristics  
Descriptive statistics of demographic variables (sex, age, race/ethnicity) will be presented for all 
enrolled study subjects, and for subjects stratified by study site and by assigned study arm.  
 
Continuous variables as a minimum will be described by number of non -missing observations 
(n), arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum, median, and maximum. Categorical 
variables will be presented using the number of observations in each category , and 
corresponding proportions (expressed as percentages).  
 
11.2.5  Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The null hypothesis to be tested is  
Ho:  D A – DC/S = 0,  
where D A is the ch ange in pain score after an elapsed time of 2 hours using the active device, 
and D C/S is the change in pain score after an elapsed time of 2 hours using the control/sham 
device.

 In order to assess whether there is a possible baseline effect, the mean ba seline pain score ( i.e. 
mean pain score at symptom onset) using the active device shall be statistically compared to 
the mean baseline pain score using the active/sham device, using a two -sample t-test at a 
significance level of α = 0.05.  
 
In order to assess whether there is a possible effect of rescue medications on the primary 
endpoint, the proportion of subjects using rescue medications within 2 hours of symptom onset 
will be statistically comp ared between the two study arms, using Fisher ’s exact test at a 
significance level of α = 0.05.  
 
If there is no significant difference in baseline pain scores and no significant difference in early 
use of rescue medications between the two device types, t he null hypothesis will be tested 
using the difference between the change in pain scores after 2 hours using the active device 
and the change in pain scores after 2 hours using the control/sham device.   
 
The distributions of these differences will be test ed for normality using the Shapiro -Wilk test at 
a significance level of α = 0.05. If the distributions are consistent with a hypothesis of normality, 
the above null hypothesis will be tested using a two -sample t-test; otherwise, the null 
hypothesis will be tested using a non -parametric Mann -Whitney test .  The mean and associated 
95% confidence interval for the true difference between the two devices will be computed, 
along with the p-value associated with the null hypothesis.   
 
If there is a significant difference in baseline pain scores and/or early  use of rescue medications 
between the two study arms, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model shall be fitted to the 
data, relating the difference in pain scores after 2 hours to the device type (active vs . 
control/sham), while controlling for any signif icant covariates .  A p-value associated with the 
test of the hypothesis of no effect of the active device on change in pain score after 2 hours will 
be computed.  
 
11.2.6  Analysis of Secondary Endpoint  
In order to compare the mean change in pain score after an elapsed time of 4 hours using the 
active device to the mean change in pain score after an elapsed time of 4 hours using the 
control/sham device, the analyses as described in section 10.2.5  for the primary endpoint shall 
be fol lowed.   
 
11.2.7  Analysis of Exploratory  Endpoints  
In order to compare the proportion of subjects who report mild or no symptoms after an 
elapsed time of 2 hours using the active device to the corresponding proportion using the 
control/sham device , subjects will be stratified into two categories  within each study arm, using 
the baseline pain score (6 -7 vs. 8-10) as the basis for stratification.  Within each of the two 
strata, the number of subjects with a pain score of ≤ 3 after 2 hours and the number of subjects 
with a pain score of > 3 after 2 hours shall be tabulated for both the active device and for t he 
18 
 control/sham device; results for each stratum shall be displayed in a 2 x 2 table. A Cochran -
Mantel -Haenszel test shall be conducted to test the hypothesis of lack of association between 
the proportion of subjects reporting mild or no symptoms after 2 hours and the type of device, 
across all strata. An estimate of the pooled odds ratio and the associated exact 95% confidence 
interval will be computed, along with  the p-value associated with the test of the null 
hypothesis.  
 
The procedures described above shall also be conducted in order to compare the proportion of 
subjects who require abortive medication to control their migraine headache within 8 hours 
between the two device types, and to compare the proportion of subjects who report 
sensitivity to light  after elapsed times of 2 hours and 4 hours between the two device types.  
 
11.2.8  Blinding Assessment  
As described in section 5.4, subjects who complete all study procedures will be asked at the 
final s ite visit to provide an opinion as to which type of device they believe they were assigned 
to (Avulux® vs. control/sham vs. do not know).   Blinding assessments shall be performed on the 
resulting data, following proce dures  as described in James et al .5 and in Bang e t al.6 
 
11.2.9  Adverse Event Data  
Analyses of adverse event data shall be conducted with respect to all enrolled subjects who 
participated in the use of either the active device or the control/sham device during study 
procedures.  
 
For each study device, the numbe r of adverse events (AEs) shall be tabulated, and descriptive 
statistics shall be utilized to summarize the severity of AEs and their relationship to study 
procedures for each device.   
 
All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be listed individually.
